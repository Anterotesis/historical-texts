<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS POEM was published by the Author in 1746. The Sub∣ject is important; the Sentiments just, and strong; the Images beautiful, and natural. Yet, in the Train of Reasoning, a certain Connection seemed to be wanting: In the Sentiments, <HI>clearness</HI>, and <HI>perspicuity</HI>; and in the Images, <HI>sameness</HI>, and <HI>simplicity</HI>. Mixt Metaphor also was sometimes admitted; and the Style, tho' strong, yet in some Places appeared too harsh and rough. These small Imperfections, in a WORK of such Genius and Spirit, and so worthy of Esteem, seemed to require Amend∣ment. This is now attempted, in a Manner,

<NOTE PLACE="foot">The Poem begins with a solemn Address and Invocation of the DEITY; and after acknowledging the Incapacity of MAN to comprehend the Nature of GOD, as he is in himself, the Au∣thor refers to his WORKS, which exhibit a Representation of his Power, Wisdom, and Goodness: from which Manifestation, or Revelation, we derive all that we believe, or know with Cer∣tainty concerning him. This Attempt to explain our Belief, or Knowledge of GOD, he begins with that Humility, Reverence, and Resignation, which becomes Man, when he seeks to know, or endeavours to explain the WILL, or LAW of his MAKER.</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="23">(23.) He next proceeds to censure those Notions as chime∣rical, which are built on any other Foundation, than on NA∣TURE. These Notions have been woven into artificial Systems, no ways conformable to the Order of NATURE; conse∣quently, instead of a true and faithful Representation of the WILL, or LAW of GOD, they exhibit only the chimerical and arbitrary WILL of MAN. They are derived either from Pride and Arrogance, which are the Sources of FANATICISM, and false ENTHUSIASM; or from Fear and Ignorance, which are the Sources of Superstition; or from a Mixture of all these with a LITTLE TRUTH, which produces Bigotry. The Conse∣quence is, that Mankind, under this ill Direction, acquires a false Humility, and unnatural Debasement, to fear without Cause of Fear, to hope without Cause of Hope, and to love and hate without Regard of Truth and Falshood, of Virtue and Vice, those natural marks which God has fixed on Things, to make them lovely or hateful.</P>
<P>"SNAKY ROD." This Epithet comprehends a great deal. It perfectly characterises the Genius of Imposture, by which Superstition has been woven into a System so mysterious, that even MOSES, the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Lawgiver, whose Design was to re∣veal that Mystery, and to counteract its Influence, hath yet been drawn to co-operate with it. His Design was evidently directed to establish a System of pure THEISM, and with that, a State of rational, or perfect FREEDOM, as a Consequence of TRUTH, in Opposition to Superstition and the Consequences of it, Ty∣ranny and Bondage. The great OUTLINES of his Plan prove this noble Truth most evidently. These, it must be confess'd some Way or other, have been fill'd up grossly enough. They have escap'd however, the Touch of Corruption. This is in∣deed a great, and real Blessing: how they have escaped, is a great, and real Miracle. But Fraud, in concealing itself, al∣ways leaves some Part uncover'd; like the Ostrich, who, when he is pursued, by hiding his Head only, thinks he conceals his Body. The Absurdities, the Inconsistencies, and the Contra∣dictions, which have been added to his Plan, are also plain. They are easily separated and rejected: since it is impossible that both cou'd be designed, or dictated by the same Person: and that, in the noblest Design, either a good Man shou'd use Imposture, or a wise Man admit such Contradictions, as wou'd not only corrupt, but in Effect, absolutely destroy it. All Objections therefore against these Contradictions are admitted; but when these are removed, the Objections are removed too. But Ob∣jections yet remain against the very Plan and real Design of <HI>Moses</HI>. These Objections, and the Defense made by Reli∣gionists, are both founded in the same Mistake. The FALL of MAN seems to be entirely misunderstood by both; according to which fundamental Mistake, the Objections are undoubtedly unanswerable. I shall endeavour, therefore, to explain this important Subject in a Treatise concerning the Life of MOSES. Mean time the following Hint,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. See p. 12 and 16. Notes.</NOTE> perhaps may assist those, who are willing to try their own Conjectures. There is no Difficulty, no Obscurity; the whole Process is plain and obvious: he can scarce miss seeing it, whoever understands the Genius of My∣thology, the Similitudes, and Analogies of NATURE, and the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Art of Application. These Similitudes are applied by MOSES with a beautiful Plainness and Simplicity; and this very Plainness, perhaps, has conceal'd his Design: while some in all the Pride of false Knowledge, and vain Philosophy, can see No∣thing but supernatural Mystery, and others, intangled in their own Cunning, Nothing which does not promote their Interest. And ev'n Writers of the freest Genius, and greatest Capacity, seem not wholly to have comprehended this Mystery. Dr. MIDDLETON saw it was an Allegory: Lord BOLING∣BROKE calls it a moral, philosophical, <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Allegory: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The honest and learned M. BUNCLE calls the <HI>Mosaical</HI> In∣stitution, Christianity in Hieroglyphicks. This approaches still nearer to Truth; but wants yet a more full Explication.</NOTE> but they saw no more.</P>
<P>Divines have run the ERROR of the FALL into Christia∣nity. Mystery is employ'd to explain Mystery; and the Re∣velation of a Mystery, and the Explanation of that Revelation become yet more mysterious: till by these Means natural Theo∣logy is quite absorbed in artificial; the WORKS, the WILL, the LAW of GOD unseen, and the WILL of MAN arbitrarily substi∣tuted. The Consequence is plain: VICE, SUPERSTITION, ATHEISM, TYRANNY.</P></NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(55.) <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> is stiled by the Satirist—<HI>Felix Terra∣rum</HI> PRAEDO.—In Religion the same Species of Madness, or er∣rant Heroism has prevailed.—When Men, under Pretence of FAITH in imputed Righteousness, are made to believe that Hap∣piness is insur'd to Vice, they run blindly into a Sort of arrogant Pride, Scorn, and Abhorrence of VIRTUE, when it is express'd in the Characters of Men, whose FAITH (as they call it) is not orthodox. This unnatural Passion of religious Malevolence is noted by the Word Bigotry; and constitutes a Character the most opposite to Truth, Virtue and Christianity. It was that very Species of Madness, which prevailed among the Jews, when they are said "to take the Kingdom of Heaven by Force;" that very Madness, which made them hate, vilify and murder their great Reformer: and that very Species of Madness, which makes ev'n those, who pretend to be his Dis∣ciples, counteract his Doctrine, and hate, vilify and persecute all who are his real Disciples; all, who, like him, are Lovers of TRUTH and VIRTUE, that is, perfect THEISTS.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(63) When Religionists absurdly misplead the WILL of GOD in Defence of Actions unjust, cruel and malevolent, they absolutely destroy the Idea or Notion of a DEITY; and while they pretend to reveal his WILL, act in plain Confederacy with Atheists, who deny it. It seems probable that this latter Species of Madness is only the former a little extended, and that ATHEISM is Supersti∣tion at full growth.</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(71.) TRUTH, 'tis presum'd, is the COMMON RIGHT of Mankind; how then dares any Man pretend a sole Right, or Commission to understand, or teach it? They who understand it best, and are therefore best qualified to teach it, are certainly least apt to make a claim so foolishly arrogant, and at the same time so pernicious to the Freedom, Peace and Happiness of Mankind.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(73—75.) And why, if any are indeed commission'd to reveal the WILL of GOD to guide Mankind in Truth, Virtue and Happiness, do they yet conceal that WILL by revealing it so darkly, that the Revelation itself is a Mystery? Certainly a wise Man for his own Sake, and a good Man for the Sake of others, wou'd act more generously. If they wou'd teach the Art of seeing and recog∣nizing the WILL of GOD from his Works, without Imposture or Falsification, they wou'd be wise and good indeed, while they thus acted a Part truly honourable to themselves and beneficial to Mankind. It was the Objection of PORPHIRY to MOSES, that he
<Q>“represented GOD as a Being, who envied Mankind the ”Knowledge of Truth:</Q>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—That famous Philosopher, if he pleased, might have objected this to his own Religion. It is said of APOLLO, and of his Priests, (who yet, more than the rest of that Sort, favour'd, and indulg'd the Free∣dom of WIT and REASON)
<Q>“that they neither told, nor con∣”ceal'd their Meaning; but made SIGNS.</Q>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. In the earliest Times, before Lan∣guage was completely form'd by Use, and extended to compre∣hend and express all external Impressions, or Ideas of Things, the Things themselves were frequently employ'd, either by Action or Representation, and according to their various Agree∣ments, and Similitudes, substituted for each other. This Sub∣stitution was a SIGN. Afterwards, when Language was form'd, the Use and Application of it was yet, even among the few, who understood it, deem'd an Accomplishment little inferior to Inspi∣ration; and still more, when by the Invention and Use of Let∣ters, those Sounds or Words were express'd, was it esteem'd a Sort of MIRACLE. Hence WORD and REASON became Equi∣valents in the <HI>Greek</HI> Language, among a People ever curious and inquisitive, who under the Influence of Freedom, and a happy Genius, made such a Progress in Arts and Sciences, as even at this Time is beheld with Admiration. Yet even among them there was a Time, when Language was reckon'd among the greatest Accomplishments, and writing was a sacred Thing. And indeed this latter notion extends even to our own Times, among whom, tho' Books are so common, that the Impressions of Novelty, wonder and Authority, are now no longer connected with them, yet by the Vulgar these Impressions and Connexions are yet retained, in whose Opinion nothing more is wanted to realize and verify a Fact, than to find it written in a Book.— Such however was the slow Progression of Knowledge, both by SIGNS and WORDS, that while it depended on the Veracity and Ability of those, who used them, either to instruct, or to be in∣structed, both ways of advancing it have been always liable to Obstructions and Impediments from Obscurity, Ambiguity and Error. As to SIGNS, though among the Antients, as well as now, there were Men of mean Genius, and selfish Passions, who wou'd sometimes abuse them, either insignificantly, or de∣ceitfully, yet by the great Legislators, and in capital Points, they are always employ'd to convey a wise and good Meaning: for this is a great Truth, that the Antients were no FOOLS. Signs in some Cases may be used with equal Exactness and Preci∣sion, and even with greater Propriety, Force and Vivacity of Impression, than Words. They have moreover this Advantage, that by seeming to conceal Truth, or rather by a middle Way between hiding and revealing, and either by a modest Reserve, or by a graceful manner of Discovery, they excite Curiosity, en∣gage Attention, and establish and preserve, from the Indifference of too much Familiarity, those original Impressions, which be∣long to it, of Novelty, Admiration, and Authority. And hence by the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> they were appropriated to Religion, and termed SACRED LETTERS. We ought not therefore in our Interpre∣tations of those mythical Allegories, or HOLY WRIT, to be too hasty in dogmatizing, or in fixing and restraining them to a sin∣gle determinate Meaning; for though even that may sometimes be done with great Beauty and Propriety, yet as they are of a copious Invention, and fruitful of various Meanings, such a Re∣straint, and precision, seems rather to be a Retrenchment of their Abundance, than an Addition to their Strength. Here the Imagination and Reason should be left free and unrestrain'd: the more they are exercised, the greater and better will be the Entertainment, and Instruction; especially if sufficient Caution be applied in excluding all Absurdity, Inconsistency and Contra∣diction. The Antients drew immediately from NATURE. They did not attempt to form, connect and harmonize chimerical, fan∣tastical, and supernatural Imaginations, which, like Dreams, or fleeting Clouds, are too slippery and evanescent, to be reduc'd to a stable Form, or to preserve Connexion, and Proportion. This is said only of those, who had Genius and Ability. It is said, and may be prov'd of <HI>Moses</HI>. That Lawgiver did not conceal his "ART to KNOW." It was his Design, in reforming from <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Superstition to reveal, that which they affected to con∣ceal; and to reject that, which they affected to publish. But when afterwards, false Knowledge and chimerical Notions were employ'd to interpret and explain his Design, which was wholly drawn from the Agreements and Similarities of Nature, the Con∣sequence has been seen in a System deform'd with Absurdity, Inconsistency and Contradiction, and felt in the Effects of Su∣perstition, Fanaticism, and Bigotry; by which that Design hath not only been corrupted, but even subverted, and destroyed. There is no other Way to attain a real Knowledge, and true Feeling of the WILL or Law of GOD, than by a modest, sober, and careful Examination of his WORKS, a diligent Attention, and Observation of NATURE, and a faithful Report, or Repre∣sentation of it. The Mind of Man will gradually conform, and harmonize itself to this Knowledge, by customary Impressions; and the Opinions, Sentiments, and Manners will all follow in a natural Order, and regular Progression, agreeable to the provi∣dential State and Course of Things, and to the various Relations and Connexions of human Dependence. They who seek the WILL of GOD in any other Way, will for ever wander in Er∣ror, deceiving and deceived: and they who pretend to teach it in any other Way, are "BLIND LEADERS of the BLIND." NATURE only points the Way, and marks the Road, which leads to Truth, to Virtue, and to Happiness, according to that common Doctrine of the old Philosophy: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. This Rule is now inverted: and how can we be said to go right, when we don't even aim right? I think it was BOILEAU, who observing NA∣TURE to be well understood, and faithfully imitated by MO∣LIERE, desir'd (as he said) to learn of him, "L'ART de la TROVER.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(77.) If these authorised or commissioned Teachers of TRUTH drew their Explanations from NATURE, such Explanations wou'd be proportion'd to human REASON, and the Sense of Duty or Obligation wou'd arise from the noblest Motives, and from that, which by the constitution of NATURE, and Ap∣pointment of GOD, is the RULER, or REGULATOR of them; whereas, according to the System of artificial Religion, those Mo∣tives are derived either from HOPE and PRIDE, the vainest and most delusive, or from FEAR and CREDULITY, the basest and most servile Parts of human Nature. Hence the Effect, on one Hand, will always be IMPLICIT FAITH, not in GOD, (of whom by these Means, nothing can be known, but what wou'd unworthily be attributed even to MAN) but in those who pretend to be his inspir'd, or commission'd LEGATES, and EMBASSA∣DORS. For HOPE and PRIDE, with Ignorance, are the Sources of FANATICISM, and FEAR and CREDULITY, with Ignorance, are the Sources of SUPERSTITION; while a Mixture of all to∣gether produces BIGOTRY, the very worst and most poisonous Composition that ever was invented and prepar'd in the eccle∣siastical College.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> The Effects of it are described l. 87—91.</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="85">(85.) "Imperious REASON," a proper Epithet for that Fa∣culty which is the RULER, or REGULATOR, in the human Constitution. REASON is assur'd without Pride; conscious, with∣out Affectation, and constant without Obstinacy: it claims Em∣pire, not over other Minds, but over our own.</P>

<P>I believe this ruling Principle, or Faculty of the Mind, which seems to distinguish Man from Man, as much as Man from Beast, whenever by Exercise and Discipline it rises to any Degree of Maturity and Perfection, is always accompanied with Modesty, and in searching the most sublime Truths relating to DEITY, with Humility and Resignation. To every ingenuous Mind therefore it must be equally grievous either to compell, or be compell'd. FAITH, when it signifies Belief, is either ac∣quir'd by CUSTOM, or by REASON. When it is acquir'd by Custom, it arises from a frequent Repetition, or Continuation of the same, or similar Impressions made on the Mind, either by NATURE, or by ART. Both these Sorts of Belief are implicit, the first in GOD, the second in MAN. They both equally avoid and abhor Doubt, and Enquiry. Hence in the first Sort it hap∣pens that various Species of DEITY are exhibited to the Mind, according to its Capacity, and the Temperament of its Affections, and Passions; while the second receives Form and Fashion in∣tirely from Authority, positive Institution, and arbitrary WILL. The former therefore is natural Superstition, the latter artificial; and while the one may be consider'd as the first rude Efforts of the Mind in Pursuit of TRUTH, the other is a false Direction of it. In one it fails through Weakness; in the other through De∣sign. The first is MERE Superstition, the last MERE Imposture. It is plain therefore that both these Sorts of Belief are liable to much Error: the first by the Imperfection of our Minds; the second by a wrong Direction or Application of those Imperfections, when by Craft they are woven into artificial Systems, and establish'd by Power and Force. When external Impressions, or Matters of Fact, are regulated and corrected according to the constant Course of Things, or Standard of NATURE, from whence they are derived; the Belief, which before was merely customary and impli∣cit, now becomes rational. The Proof rises above Doubt, and the Conclusion is Truth. This Regulation is made by an exact and careful Examination, and Recognition, of the true Power, or Moment of all those Faculties or Senses, which receive and con∣vey natural Impressions to the Imagnation. This Recognition is effected by Reason, the Corrector and Regulator of all the other Powers or Faculties of the Mind. Rational Belief there∣fore is founded in Evidence, and Evidence in NATURE. When this Evidence is seen, we assent consequently and neces∣sarily. But if NATURE cannot be compell'd, neither can such Belief. Force may produce Hypocrisy, or Simulation; Be∣lief it cannot produce. And how can that therefore be deem'd fit to be done, which GOD has made impossible to be done? It may be said, perhaps, that by a continual Effort even Impos∣sibility may be surmounted. I believe, (saith St. AUSTIN) because it is IMPOSSIBLE." This indeed is a supernatural Rea∣son; he who can thus believe, may remove Mountains. The Mind thus strain'd becomes dissolute. When Force is thus of∣fer'd to itself, the Transition is easy from the lowest Degree of servile Abasement to the highest Pitch of arrogant Pride. The Distance immediately vanishes between IMPLICIT FAITH and arbitrary Command; and between arbitrary Command and per∣secuting RAGE. In reality they concur, and run into each other. He who can believe with <HI>Austin</HI>, will damn with <HI>Athanasius</HI>. Such it seems is the Genius of that FAITH, that whosoever believeth not, without Doubt he shall perish everlastingly." Is not this an amiable Picture of human NATURE; No: 'Tis a Picture only of priestly Genius. It is that very Genius which hath corrupted human NATURE. It is that very SERPENTINE Genius which MOSES symbolically characteriz'd, and which JESUS condemn'd. Our Poet hath describ'd it again l. 81—91. If it be truly design'd, let them own it to whom it belongs. That Confession (more just than ever St. <HI>Austin</HI> made) wou'd make even SHAME meritorious. Mean time I ask leave to hope that a better Genius may prevail among those, who are au∣thoris'd to instruct Mankind; and to wish, with a noble PHI∣LOSOPHER,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LORD SHAFTESBURY.</NOTE> whom yet, while they hate, they vainly attempt to imitate; that
<Q>“it may be far, and far surely it will ever be, from any worthy Genius to be consenting to such a treache∣”rous Language, and ABUSE of WORDS,</Q>
which makes Men hate each other for what they cannot understand, and builds FAITH on the Destruction of REASON and VIRTUE.</P>
<P>If it be said that NATURE may be compell'd; This is an Appeal to the almighty Power of GOD, of which we can form no judgment but by Experience. But this Appeal implies either a great Fallacy, or an absolute Contradiction. It is a Contra∣diction to suppose the Supreme BEING acts against himself; since if Wisdom and Goodness be Attributes, which are suppos'd ne∣cessary to belong to him, such Action must annihilate those Attri∣butes, or which is the same Thing with regard to us, must render it impossible for us to form any Conception, or Notion of them. Now these Propositions are equivalent: "NATURE is the WHOLE WORK of GOD," or "the WHOLE WORK of GOD is called NATURE." To deny this is ATHEISM; and to suppose this WORK violated by the WORKER, if he be suppos'd infi∣nitely wise, good, and powerful, is to suppose him acting against himself. But if the WORKER be perfect, nothing can be vio∣lated. ALL IS RIGHT. What seems to be wrong, is only in ourselves; and then only, when by following our own fond and chimerical Imaginations, we falsify his Operations, and at∣tribute to him Things, which have no Connexion or Correspon∣dence with NATURE. This Falsification of NATURE, or Sub∣stitution of chimerical and supernatural Notions, and Operations, in Place of real and NATURAL, arises either first, from our Weakness in judging of natural Impressions, and Matters of Fact, and afterwards in mistaking the Effect, which those Im∣pressions make on the Imagination, for the Things themselves which cause them; from whence Superstition is derived: or secondly, from a wrong Direction, and Application of that Weak∣ness, when these Seeds of Superstition, are cultivated, and as they grow up, transplanted into various Plots and Labyrinths, according to the Genius of those, who in all ages have thought WORDS make VIRTUE, as WOOD makes a GROVE. And from hence those Materials are supplied, which have been used in building the several Fabrics of artificial Religion; which, when it differs from NATURAL, (and it is always different in its Foun∣dation, and often contrary to NATURAL RELIGION in its De∣sign) so far co-operates with ATHEISM, that without Aid from the former, the very Notion of the latter cou'd NEVER have prevail'd, or forc'd itself on the IMAGINATION of Mankind.</P>
<P>But besides a Contradiction, the Appeal to Almighty Power concerning a Violation of NATURE, implies the greatest Fal∣lacy; since it supposes that to be provable, which if it cou'd be prov'd, and were so admitted and universally employ'd, wou'd effectually destroy the Foundation of all other Proof with Regard to every Thing NATURAL, or REAL. And this again wou'd throw us into ATHEISM.</P>
<P>All Inferences, or Concessions drawn from Experience, Ha∣bit, or Custom, though they create Assurance, and we usually think and act, as if they were certain, yet are only probable; because we see not, nor can see in fact, the secret Principle which connects Cause and Effect.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See HUME Philosoph. Ess.</NOTE> But Inferences from Reason are demonstrative: because we see in the Relation of abstract Ideas, the necessary Connexion of one Idea with another. In the latter Case we conclude with Certainty from one Instance, the Truth of all of the same Kind; in the former we conclude only with Probability from many Instances that similar Causes will produce in Succession similar Effects. Custom therefore, when consider'd with relation to external Things, is the continual, and regular Impression made upon our Senses by the Course of NA∣TURE; which, if it was irregular, inconstant, or violable, there wou'd remain no Rule or Measure of human Action. If the Ratio, or Order of NATURE were destroy'd, the correspondent Ratios of the human Mind must necessarily be destroyed also, and it wou'd be absolutely impossible for Man to become rational, civil, or religious. Without it he cou'd never become rational; for the Increments of human Reason being dervied from the Ra∣tio of NATUE, which thro' the Senses by customary Progression im∣prints Ideas on the Imagination, the Mind by observing and retain∣ing them, gradually acquires a Habit of applying them to the several Uses and Purposes of Life. But if these Impressions were with∣out Order, Agreement, or Connexion, that habitual or customary Perception or Belief, by which they are so applied, cou'd not be excited. If Fire was experimentally seen to produce in alternate Turns, contrary Effects in the same Objects, it wou'd be im∣possible to render it useful, or subservient to the Wants of human Life. In like Manner, if the Behaviour of Man to Man pro∣ceeded from such changeable and arbitrary Principles, all Peace, Order and Concord wou'd be subverted: he wou'd for ever re∣main in a State of savage Barbarity, and in a Condition much worse ev'n than Wolves and Bears. Legal therefore, or civil, Man cou'd not be. And religious he cou'd not be; since, hav∣ing no Notion of a DEITY but what is formed from the Idea of his Works exhibited in Nature, and this Idea being imprinted on the Mind by a gradual Series, and progressive Increment, by Use and Custom, becomes Belief; which again being regulated by Reason, confirms and establishes the Notion of a SUPREME BEING, infinitely wise, good, and powerful. Hence also, by a Review, or Recognition of this Process, he discovers FAITH, LOYALTY and ALLEGIANCE to be a perfect Duty to this SU∣PREME BEING, or the Perfection of his OWN. But if the Order of Things, and RATIO of NATURE did not generate and harmonize the progressive Growth and Order of his own Na∣ture, his Ideas wou'd be nothing but an infinite Number of Con∣ceptions without Band, or Connexion; without Order or Pro∣portion. In such Condition, Man cou'd acquire no Idea of Wisdom and Design, no Sense or Feeling of Beauty, Virtue and Goodness; no Notion of a DEITY. Every Thing arbitrary, uncertain, and precarious. Hopeless, comfortless, faithless, he wou'd wander for ever in a forlorn and fatherless World, hating, and hated; deceiving and deceived. Incapable of that calm and regular Happiness, which flows from TRUTH and VIRTUE; with sudden Starts, perhaps, and transient Flashes of Imagina∣tion, which wou'd only discover the frightful Night, which sur∣rounded him, and in which he must remain for ever subject to perpetual Fear, Horror and Amazement. Such would seem to be the Condition of Man, and such the universal confusion which wou'd follow, if the regular Operations, and Constitution of Things were violated; and such in Fact is his present Condi∣tion in Proportion as Superstition prevails, and he departs from NATURE. The Course of NATURE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ipsa NATURAE RATIO, quae est LEX DIVINA &amp; HU∣MANA. CIC.</NOTE> therefore is the GREAT STANDING REVELATION of the WILL or LAW of GOD. W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cannot avoid the natural Impressions of WILL or LAW, which by customary Succession create Belief: which is Nothing but a Progression of the Mind or Reason, corresponding with NA∣TURE. Belief then is gradual, or customary Instinct, or pro∣gressive Nature in Man, by which the Mind advances to the Knowledge of Truth, and Love of Virtue. It can neither be produced, nor prevented by any Forms of Reasoning, or arti∣ficial Method of Argumentation: neither can it be compell'd by Force; Force can only produce Simulation; and Reason can only direct and regulate this natural INSTINCT. And as this na∣tural Progression is the same in all, as in each Man particularly, so the Direction or Regulation is the same. Hence political, religious, and moral Regulations have all the same Source and Origin, the same Standard and common Measure, in the Or∣der, the Constancy, and Ratio of NATURE. The same custo∣mary Instinct, when review'd and recogniz'd, becomes CON∣SCIENCE; which also, in Turn, when it becomes customary by the same Progression, becomes also a perfect LAW or Obli∣gation. Hence it appears, that to establish and preserve the Order and Peace of Society, it is not sufficient that good Laws be written or taught, unless the same become customary. But if the Laws written or taught be bad, and do not correspond with NATURE, they may yet become customary, and so prevail. And this is the Effect of natural INSTINCT wrong directed, and when it supplies Craft with the Materials of Superstition. This is the Source of that Pretence (for it is a Pretence only) that NATURE is corrupted. Thus NATURE is condemn'd for a Corruption introduc'd, habituated, and naturaliz'd, by the customary Influence and Prevalence of superstitious Systems; while by a strange Deception the necessary Use and Application of those Systems is proved, from that Corruption; and they are in Fact applied, or pretended to be applied, to correct, and cure that very Disorder which they produce.</P></NOTE>

The Doctrine of Immortality, or, (as it is call'd,) of SALVATION, was <HI>Aegyptian</HI>, but rejected by MOSES, for Reasons too long to be here enumerated. It hath been grafted however upon his System, tho' contrary to it. It is also pretended to be laid open to all: tho' so guarded, that without License from the Keepers none may hope to attain it. Mean time those Keepers and their Followers are divided into so many different Sects, who generally hate each other, that whatever Reasons are employed by any one of them to reject the rest, may with greater pro∣priety be employed to reject all, since that in which they place their chief Strength, and characteristical Excellency, is really in∣consistent with NATURE.

There is also another Sort, derived from metaphysical Fanaticism; which, tho' founded in Pride, yet associates with the rest, at the same Time that it wou'd seem to despise them. This metaphy∣sical Bigotry grew up apace, when Heathen Sophistry was grafted on Christian Simplicity. The Spirit of CREED-MAKING then began. Phantastical Chimaeras receiv'd the falsified Seal or Mark of Truth; while none were allowed to enquire or doubt, but all took Tickets of Salvation for so small a Price as IMPLICIT FAITH.</NOTE>

The <HI>Chinese</HI> reckon back¦ward thro' an immense Length of Time, in which it kept the same Channel. Yet their MANDERINES, or learned Men, are said to be all ATHEISTS; which supplies a new Proof of that Confederacy, noted before, between Superstition and ATHEISM. AEGYPT marked by the River NILE is justly esteemed the Pa∣rent of Superstition. The <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Priests also pretended to shew very ancient Records, in which they preserved the Cal∣culations of <HI>Eclypses</HI>, and the Successions of Time. The Empe∣ror CONSTANTINE made (as is pretended) a Donation of ROME to Pope SYLVESTER, which with the adjoining <HI>Campania</HI> has since been named St. PETER's Patrimony. That Emperor while he was yet an Heathen, had been guilty ('tis said) of such Crimes, that when he sought Expiation, his Priests, less com∣plaisant than might be expected, absolutely refused; pretending their Religion had provided no Expiation for such enormous Guilt. So he applied to the <HI>Christian</HI> Priests, and receiv'd from them that Absolution which had been denied by his own. Being thus suddenly converted, and sanctified, the Consequence must needs be some extraordinary Act of Zeal. Accordingly he settled on the <HI>Christian</HI> all the immense Wealth of the Heathen Hierar∣chy; a Deed which from the Motive and Manner of Execution, and especially from the Consequences, might well be deemed an Effect of Dotage. 'Tis now about 1500 Years since this re∣markable Donation; so that the Superstition, Fanaticism, Ty∣ranny and Bigotry, which have been derived from it, may be truly pictur'd as "grey with Dotage."</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(169.) If we consider the Weakness of Men, how apt they are to deceive, and to be deceived; to invent, and to believe a LYE; their whole Pursuit of TRUTH may seem to terminate in certain Degrees of Probability, or Verisimilitude. And this perhaps wou'd serve their Turn well enough, if they did not va∣lue the Name more than the Thing, and the Praise of it more than the Use. But while in this Pursuit they stoop to take up the gilded BALL of Profit, and Honour, Envy and Discord im∣mediately arise, and prevail in Proportion to the Eagerness of Hope in gaining, or to the Violence of Fear in losing those dar∣ling Objects: under the Deception and Inchantment of these Passions, they are forcibly driven another Way; they depart from their first Aim, and soon lose sight of Truth; while PRIDE assuming the Name of Zeal, by covering the Deception, sancti∣fies the Violence of Opposition, and pretending to blow the Sparks of Truth, kindles the Flame of Persecution. This out∣rageous Spirit of Bigotry, if it did not first arise, undoubtedly receiv'd Growth, and Force from that metaphysical Jargon, and chimaerical Science, which the Heathen Sophists introduc'd into the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, deforming its Simplicity, and corrupting the Truth. These, on the Conversion of <HI>Constantine</HI>, run like a Torrent into the fashionable System, and brought with them all the mud, and filth of Heathenism. In this rich Glebe Weeds grew luxuriantly, and among the rest, false ZEAL acquir'd, now, such a poisonous Quality, that it destroy'd CHARITY, the most essential Part of that Religion, which it pretended to support. Thus it hath ever since continued to disturb Mankind, from that Time to the present; with Fits however of Remission, and Abate∣ment, in our own Country at least, where it hath been check'd by the FREEDOM of WIT and HUMOUR: which, as our NO∣BLE BRITISH PHILOSOPHER teaches, and by his Example shews, hath proved the only specific Cure of religious Madness. We are pleas'd to see the Disguise of Falshood removed, and we embrace Truth more sincerely, when the Deformity of Error is discover'd; while, as COMMON SENSE and EQUAL TASTE pre∣vail, we tolerate with Ease, and even indulge in each other that Difference of Opinion which seems unavoidable.

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(180, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) Amidst this rage of Bigotry, and Confusion of Belief, the Poet enquires next how the sober FREE-THINKER may avoid that Error, which Pride hath sanctified with the Name of FAITH.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="194">(194, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) If MIRACLES are requir'd in Proof of Truth; neither the present Taste of the Times, nor the watchful Cau∣tion of the Hierarchy, will allow, it seems, the Experiment; tho' some attempts, it must be own'd, even in our own Country, and more, and greater Efforts, as might be expected, have been made in a neighbouring Nation, to restore this EYESIGHT PROOF. We must recur therefore to former Times, more pro∣per for such extraordinary Operations, and, as it should seem, before the Order and Constancy of NATURE was understood. Here then we are guided only by Record, Report, or Tradition. But the Impressions made by these Reports, being either con∣trary to NATURE, or at least not confirmed by the consequent Order and Constitution of Things, when it was afterwards ob∣served to be more regular and constant, like Objects seen at a Distance, become gradually more weak by Time, and eva∣nescent. On the other hand, natural Impressions, or Matters of Fact, receive continual Increments from Repetition, and be∣come by custom more strong, clear and vivid. To repair there∣fore the gradual Decay, to which the former are subject, the Managers of Miracles have contrived, by frequent Repetitions, to give them Form, and Semblance at least, if not the Sub∣stance, of real Facts. But in this Attempt, by bringing them too near the Sight, the Fallacy has been discover'd, and the Pur∣pose defeated, by those very Means which were intended to esta∣blish it. The wisest therefore, and most judicious of those <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MIDDLETON, FREE ENQUIRY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Ma∣nagers, have corrected this Mistake. They have retrench'd the Number of these specious, or artificial Miracles, limited the Times of Operation, and appropriated their Purpose, not to private, but to public Utility. And this seems to be the only legitimate Purpose in which they can be properly employ'd. But even here too the greatest Caution in using them is necessary, as they are much more apt to associate with Error and Vice, than with Truth and Virtue. They are indeed so far from proving themselves, and even from adding Strength by their Association to Truth and Virtue, that even their own Proof depends on the Worth and Value which they receive from that Association. Nothing then can be proved with them, but what must be first proved, and therefore better proved without them: so that while we see their bad Influence insensibly decay, and vanish, we need be the less sollicitous about losing the good Effects, which some have supposed them capable of producing: and that (as the great ROMAN PHILOSOPHER observes with his usual Sagacity)

A noble and lately flourishing City lies now in Ruins, which hath been a frequent Scene of this unnatural Joy; and what seems indeed re∣markable, the Desolation was poured out on that very Day, on which, according to annual Custom, this inhuman TRAGEDY should have been acted. But GOD, the supreme Conductor of the Machinery, and of the universal System of NATURE, was pleased to change the Scene, and represent a far different Spec∣tacle, less horrible indeed than the other, but much more dread∣ful and terrible! dreadful above the Power of Description; and terrible beyond the power of Imagination! and what now will the dogmatizing Zealot assert concerning this vast Cala∣mity? he who pretends a Commission to understand, and to re∣veal the SECRETS of PROVIDENCE? he who loves to turn Error into SIN, and Destruction into VENGEANCE? Was it a Punish∣ment inflicted on ORTHODOXY, or on INFIDELITY? or shall we rather affirm, with more Sobriety, and without affecting to know the SECRETS of PROVIDENCE, that in all Circumstances, Benevolence is due from MAN to MAN, and in all Events perfect Submission and Resignation from MAN to his MAKER? Such Belief would check the Rage of ZEAL, when it kindles into Per∣secution; and when it executes Vengeance on Man, in Pretence of executing the WILL of GOD.— Mean Time this ZEAL is found to agree very well with the greatest VICE and WICKED∣NESS. That royal SAINT, ADULTERER, and MURDERER, according to his own Account, was "devoured with ZEAL:" while, like NERO, he tuned his Harp, inspired with Passions, which have set the World on fire; his pious Hymns and sancti∣fied Execrations are promiscuously blended together, and too often, by modern Zealots, sung with the same Intention.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(234.) This is an Allusion, as is usual with Poets, to the old Heathenish Story of PHAETON; he was a King, and reputed Son of PHOEBUS, or the SUN. The Reality of this celestial Li∣neage being doubted, it seems, by some Freethinker in those early Ages, in Order to vindicate his Birth, and avoid the Ridicule of a false Claim, he begs of his father to allow him, for one Day, to drive his Chariot. APOLLO consents, though with much Re∣luctance. Accordingly he mounted the Chariot, and perished in the Flames; which, by his ill Management, set the World on fire. This Fable hath a great Meaning; but too long for this Place.</NOTE>

<P>But INFALLIBILITY it seems stands in the Way; and like a Rock opposed to the Fury of Winds and Waves, resists the whole Force of REASON and FREE-THINKING; This is the Summit, or highest Point of the Pyramid of ecclesiastical Polity, a grand Fabric! which an illustrious CARDINAL <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CORPO POLITICO PIU FELICE CHE SIA in Terra. So also he says, CHRISTO ERA GRANDE POLITICO. PALLAVICINI Hist. Trent.</NOTE> calls
<Q>“the most perfect political Constitution that ever was established in ”the World.</Q>
Here we see, as a learned Writer expresses it, a Concatenation of MIRACLES, deduced in a long Series, from
<Q>“the Beginning to the present Time, ALL united in ONE POINT, which afford a Proof SIMILAR to THAT, which is deduced ”from NATURE to prove a DEITY.</Q>
The MIRACLES of NATURE do indeed prove a DEITY; but artificial MIRACLES have no other Effect, and perhaps no other Purpose, than to drive Men, either through Despair, into Atheism, or through Fear, into Superstition. The latter Part of this is apparent; the former corresponds with a fine Reflection of Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI>: "We often find the Truth, but either don't know it; or can't prove that we have found it."
<Q>“It is but too plain then (quoth the Impostor) that it was not made for us; and you'll see at last, People won't so much as think of finding it. They'll lose ”their Courage and throw up the Game.</Q>
FONTENELLE DIALOGUES. The Papists are not agreed in whom to place In∣fallibility. Some, as the Jesuits, place it in the POPE; others in a General Council; others in the CHURCH. It must be owned however, that if we view this papal Doctrine of Infalli∣bility, as softened with the curious Pen of one of their greatest Writers, it seems very little different from that which prevails in every Sect of Protestants, who, if they are not infallible, yet are never deceived.<NOTE PLACE="marg">☞</NOTE> The POPE allows no Enquiry, no Doubt. This is consistent. The Protestant allows, encourages and even provokes Enquiry, yet condemns Doubt as impious.
<Q>“When a Man depends either entirely on FAITH, as the PAPIST, or entirely on Reason, as the THEIST, it is easy to form a con∣sistent Scheme of Doctrine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">☞</NOTE> But when once he attempts to compound their different Powers, he presently falls into Opi∣nions, of which the sole Contrariety is a manifest Proof of their ”Falshood.</Q>
This is the Observation of that great Writer, above-mentioned, the famous Bishop of MEAUX; whose Expo∣sition was said to have converted to Popery the great TURENNE. That illustrious Prelate saw very well the Inconsistency of ad∣mitting REASON, as a Principle of NATURE, to co-operate with religious, political, or artificial FAITH, which wholly excludes NATURE. So then, it seems, the Papist and the THEIST, each in his own Way, may both form a consistent Scheme of Doctrine. The Consistence of the former depends on AUTHO∣RITY. It turns on a single Point, Obedience to the CHURCH. The Consistence of the latter is founded in NATURE. It is a cer∣tain and necessary Correspondence of SENSE, REASON and Ex∣perience, with the certain and necessary Order of Things. In the former, artificial Objects of Passion are substituted for natural; and on this Substitution the Calculation proceeds of all the several Orders and Proportions of this mighty Fabric. These Orders and Proportions being only apparent, or imaginary, easily slide into each other, and like the Visions of a Dream, vanish and disappear; while from the same fruitful Source new Orders arise, and are again dissolved with the same Ease, and without Ruin, or even Disturbance. The WHOLE is indeed arbitrary, fantasti¦cal, and chimerical; and the several Parts, like a Heap of Sand, are contiguous, but not connected; without Beauty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> without Convenience, without Strength; yet as the Eye is wholly fix'd, and the Attention engaged on one single Point of Obedience, or Infallibity; all these Minutenesses disappear to the customary Religionist, and sometimes ev'n to a judicious Eye <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir EDWIN SANDYS View, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> CHARACTERISTICKS. Vol. III. p. 93.</NOTE> the Magic Structure appears with Marks of just Design, conve∣nient, graceful, and grand.</P>
<P>The Scheme of THEISM is that in Reality, which the Scheme of Papistry is only in Appearance. In the latter the ART of Man assumes and exercises almighty Power and Infallibility; while ac∣cording to the Nature of its Subject, which is merely imaginary, it arbitrarily and at Pleasure, forms and unforms its several Or∣ders, without the least Disturbance. In the latter, the Mind hath even a larger Scope, and Exercise, but in a different Way; for here it is wholly employed in observing, in reporting, in re∣cognizing the ART of GOD, exhibited in NATURE, or the SYSTEM of the UNIVERSE. The System of THEISM therefore, is a Picture copied, or imitated, from NATURE. If then there be Consistence in NATURE; If in the universal Frame and Sy∣stem of Things, there be Convenience, Beauty, and Grandeur; if in the Works of God there be Perfection; then the System of THEISM is consistent, convenient, beautiful, great and perfect.</P>
<P>FAITH, in the papal Scheme, being founded on Authority and Custom, is implicit, passive, or merely verbal. There is no Contradiction perceived in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ropositions, which have no Reference to Things; or if perceived, it is verbal only; and then a verbal FAITH is sufficient for a verbal Proposition. AUTHORITY, by exciting false Passions, begins the Circulation, Custom receives it, and it gains, as a Lye gains Belief, by Repetition. On the other Hand, FAITH, according to the System of THEISM, is indeed originally implicit, and passive, but not verbal. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t con∣sists in a Correspondence with NATURE; it is derived from natu∣ral Impressions, established by Experience and Custom; and in a gradual Progression being reviewed, and recognized by REASON, it becomes rational and free; while the Mind assents willingly, and deliberately, without Reluctance, without Compulsion, and without Authority. Reason indeed accrues from natural Im∣pressions, and customary Belief; which, in this Case, is truly progressive INSTINCT. It increases, as Reason with the Know∣ledge of NATURE increases; and improves, and is capable of Improvement, in an endless Progression. If therefore Reason be useful in human Affairs, if it be most useful in Things of most Importance, and lastly, if TRUTH, and VIRTUE, and RELI∣GION, be indeed Things of most Importance; then is FAITH according to the System of THEISM, most useful, most reasona∣ble, and most important. It is adapted to all Men, at all Times; it insinuates and ev'n forces itself on all Men, at all Times; and except only when disturbed, or perverted, or counteracted by artificial Schemes of FAITH, and Systems of Superstition; it is embraced and followed by all Men, at all Times. It is the per∣petual, continual and universal REVELATION of the WILL, or LAW of GOD, to all Men, at all Times, in different Degrees, and in a gradual Progression; strong even before REASON acquires Maturity, but clear and more strong when reviewed and recog∣niz'd by REASON. This FAITH therefore MAY, and THIS alone CAN, be truly called CATHOLIC.</P>
<P>It was said above, that either in Popery, or in THEISM, a consistent Scheme of FAITH may be formed. That Consistency is now mark'd, and characteris'd. It was also said, that a Mix∣ture, or Composition of both, produces a Scheme inconsistent.— Of papal Faith mere WORDS or SOUNDS are the immediate, though the ultimate Object is Authority, or INFALLIBILITY; which indeed, without Force, wou'd be mere Words too.— Now in all other Cases, Men being accustom'd to affix some Meaning to Words, ev'n in the Expression of Passions, when the Idea and Perception are most confus'd; the Imagination can ne∣ver rest, till it has try'd, in this Case too, to fix some Meaning. From this Curiosity it happens, that in all Systems of Superstition, Innovations and Reformations are gradualy formed, which, as they grow, either fall away, or are forced away, from the Pa∣rent Stock. In these Reformations, TRUTH at first seems to be the only Thing designed; the Freedom of Reason is sufficiently indulg'd; which goes as well, and as far as it can go, at a Time when it is but just out of Dading-strings. But the Priests, when once they find themselves settled, like a Hare in her Form, al∣ways look backwards; always jealous, without Cause, of those, who have most Cause to be jealous of them, they still fancy themselves hunted and pursued; and think their only Safety consists in doubling back again into the same Track, and re∣peating the same Ring <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Gyrum Rationis &amp; Doctrinae. <HI>CIC.</HI></NOTE>. All the Lines of their Hopes, of their Designs, and of their Actions, center in that Point, where Licence was first changed into Freedom, and REASON took the Seat of Authority; Reason therefore and Freedom they abhor, even when they pretend to indulge them; and they abhor because they fear them. Nothing makes them secure but IN∣FALLIBILITY; nothing agrees so well with Infallibility as MY∣STERY. Hence the Resemblance of Mysteries in all Systems of Superstition, and in all Changes, and Reformations of those Systems. This strong Hold, however, has not always been un∣derstood; and not being understood, has sometimes been be∣tray'd, ev'n by the Priests themselves. It has been betray'd when they have attempted to explain, and to measure by the Rule of Reason, Things which are inexplicable, and incommensu∣rable.</P>
<P>If a Mystery be said to be contained in certain Words, but not expressed, or revealed, the Imagination fatigues and confounds itself to no Purpose in pursuing a Hint which either points at NOTHING, or, which is the same, at Nothing which is the Object of human Understanding. Hence all that strange Confusion in the Explica∣tion of Mysteries supposed, but not expressed. But if, besides a Mystery, the Words also plainly imply a Contradiction; then Reason being clearly seen to be an improper Rule, or Measure of Mystery, nothing can be sufficient to establish the latter, but IN∣FALLIBILITY. But it is now too late to recur to Infallibility, which, by admiting Reason, had been before rejected. This In∣consistency belongs to those, who, without pretending to Infalli∣bility, admit the Co-operation of Reason with FAITH. It is indeed a great Inconsistency; for when a free Enquiry is per∣mitted, and Examination allowed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Mysteries of FAITH; and when, as a Consequence of such Enquiry, Dissent, in many Cases, seems unavoidable; if yet that Dissent is deemed impious, in like Manner as when Infallibility exacts implicit Belief: what is this but to use, without pretending Infallibility, and to compell under Pretence of Freedom? What is this but to tempt, to be∣tray, and even to insult Mankind, while they are invited to use their Reason freely, when yet they are punished for that Free∣dom? The Design, however, seems originally to have been ge∣nerous and humane, but perverted, as Religion hath always been perverted, by the Jealousy of those, who either foolishly fear that Men should know too much to be instructed; or who do not see that the Scheme of FAITH, which they have formed, is composed of Parts, which destroy each other, and that while they mix TRUTH with CHIMERAS, it resembles that visionary IMAGE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DAN. ii.32.</NOTE> "whose Head was of pure Gold, but the Feet were Clay."</P>
<P>Thus Infallibility is necessary in all Systems of Superstition, to render the several Forms consistent; but this Consistency extends no farther than the Form itself, by which the Faithful are com∣pelled, rather than united, with Regard to NATURE and COM∣MON SENSE, the whole FORM remains inconsistent, notwith∣standing; except only when sometimes perhaps it may seem to correspond with NATURE. The System of THEISM can alone be perfectly consistent, because it perfectly corresponds with NA∣TURE. The ONE rests on REAL INFALLIBILITY, the OTHER on PRETENDED; one is founded on the Authority of GOD, the other on the CRAFT of MAN; THEISM therefore is universal, it prevails more or less every where, and at all Times, wherever there are Creatures capable of perceiving and recognizing the Ef∣fects of infinite Power, Wisdom, and Goodness. The pre∣tended Infallibility of artificial FAITH imitates also these Charac∣ters, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oves, or attempts to prove, its Reality by Extent, and Duration. But if other precedent Systems of Superstition, of much larger Extent, and longer Duration have all failed, this Failure may seem to render probable the Opinion that even this too may fail,

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="281">(281—9.) The Roman Empire was founded in Su∣perstition supported by MIRACLES and PROPHECIES. In their religious System, the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Doctrine of a future State was imitated and proved, as the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> proved it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> by Fact: In this Contrivance a great Extent of Knowledge is vi∣sible. The Nature of Eclypses were then understood, and the Times calculated and applied, to excite Fear or Hope, Terror or Assurance, as might best serve the Purposes of mythological Legislature. On this Machinery <HI>Romulus</HI> was deified, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tempestas Solisque Defectio Consecrationis Speciem praebuére: cui mox Julius Proculus Fidem fecit. <HI>Flor.</HI></NOTE> the Go∣vernment established, and an Expectation raised and cherished of its eternal Duration. Hence VIRGIL, alluding to this Ex∣pectation, calls the CAPITOL IMMOVEABLE:—CAPITOLI IMMOBILE SAXUM.</P>
<P>And our Poet here, whose Design was, not to cherish, but to destroy such fond Expectations, represents that Eternity as a vain Dream, the Offspring of Superstition and the Parent of Pride. The real MERIT of the Roman Genius and Discipline (which indeed was very great) consisted in a Conformity with NATURE, as far as NATURE was then understood. COMMON SENSE was the Measure of COMMON GOOD; and Superstition was employ'd to the same Purpose; It was, however, always subservient, not supreme; because, as VARRO says,
<Q>“the State existed before ”the several Deities were instituted.</Q>
<Q>“Quia Civitates Diis, ”quos ipsae instituerant, ut Pictor Tabellâ, priores sunt.</Q>
This Method, which rendered Superstition subservient to the State, gave Room and Freedom to human Nature to exert itself. Ac∣cordingly the <HI>Romans</HI> were remarkable for Simplicity of Manners, for Frugality, Sobriety, Temperance, Fortitude, and for every Virtue private or public, useful or ornamental. These Virtues really made them great; but Superstition corrupted that Great∣ness, by swelling it into Pride, and an unnatural Lust of Domi∣nion. Thus, by depriving others of Liberty, they lost their own. Luxury followed Conquest, and Vice followed Luxury, while Superstition by these Means, became predominant, and instead of being subservient to the State, the State was sub∣servient to Superstition. And NOW Vice, which in other Cir∣cumstances, is only a Start or Deviation from NATURE, in this Conjuncture, and under the Influence of Superstition, became ge∣neral, habitual, and, as it were, naturaliz'd.</P></NOTE>

Yet I cannot but think, that in those many dreadful Persecutions raised against them (sometimes it must be owned through their own Fault) great Numbers of them suffered from true Conscience, and on a Principle of Resignation, FAITH and ALLEGIANCE to GOD.

After this Dissolution, some Reformation usually succeeds; in which the Force of Truth being NOW seen, and acknowledged, prevails at first, and thus Superstition, by means of Truth blended with it, becomes useful; or according to our Poet's al∣legorical Description,

<L>Whence then th' imperious, positive Disdain,</L>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="346">(346.) Having shewn the Weakness of IMPLICIT FAITH, and Superstition, the Question here rising from that Discovery is very proper, and equally important:
<Q>“Why should Men hate, vilify, and persecute each other for Difference of Opinion, in Things, which have no Certainty, nor even Existence in ”Truth and NATURE,</Q>
but only in the disordered Imagination "of those, who (as our Poet before noted l. 145.)</P>
<Q><L>"Hug their own DAY-DREAMS IDOLISED WITHIN,</L>
<L>And style them REVELATION?</L></Q>
<P>And indeed according to our noble PHILOSOPHER, unless we are capable of viewing and reviewing, on all Sides, and in every Light, our Fancies and Imaginations, and of judging and criti∣cising them with a clear and free Mind, we can never be sure of their TRUTH, REALITY, or CONFORMITY with NATURE.
<Q>“They may, perhaps, be MONSTERS, and not DIVINITIES, or SACRED TRUTHS, which are kept thus choicely conse∣”crated in some dark Corner of the Mind.</Q>
This solemn Con∣secration of chimerical Notions is the great Source of BIGOTRY, and especially, when by such WILL-WORSHIP, and blind Ido∣latry, men attribute, assume, or impute to themselves REAL MERIT: this Deception working and fermenting with Vanity and Vice, raises an excessive and unnatural PRIDE, or spiritual Arrogance, which, by rejecting and disdaining COMMON SENSE, GOOD-WILL and GOOD-HUMOUR, renders them intolerable to each other. VIRTUE is hated and virtuous Men persecuted, ac∣cording as they differ, or are supposed to differ, from certain FORMS of CREEDS, or SYMBOLS of FAITH. This Hatred of Virtue is strangely contrasted; Men become vicious out of Spite; while Pride, growing with Vice, by Means of imputed Merit, prompts them to indulge, under all this Deception, a fond HOPE of attaining Happiness in a miraculous or supernatural Way, and as our Poet has strongly expressed it,
<Q>—"Affect ev'n HEAV'N in SPITE."</Q>
Till at last, Virtue and Vice losing their Distinction, they rest in the latter as most agreeable to NATURE, though it be indeed most contrary to NATURE, and to the LAWS of GOD, which have this authentic Property, that they execute themselves. Hence it happens, that in this Pursuit of chimerical Happiness Men always find themselves disappointed.
<Q><L>—"ALL IS VANITY.</L>
<L>"MEN NEVER ARE, but always TO BE BLEST."</L></Q>
And hence also is derived another Observation of Fact, which would cease to be true, if Superstition and Bigotry were removed,
<Q>“That even with the Aid of Religion human Nature grows daily more corrupt: so hard it is in any State to find a MAN, who ”lives NATURALLY, and like a MAN.</Q></P></NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(356.) Our Poet here, as in some other Places, presumes to treat this serious Subject with some Strokes of WIT and HU∣MOUR. Nor can it be offensive, it is hoped, to the gravest, and most solemn Religionist to see a well-bred orthodox Mouse in∣troduced as refusing, from implicit Faith, and mere Reverence, to touch those miraculous Records, which may be deemed the sacred Reliques of old Eye-sight Proof. Nor can the Poet be thought to sin against his ART in characterizing, as a Sort of Proselyte, one of the NIBBLING RACE, when the Zeal of St. ANTHONY is canonised, who thought it not below the Dignity of his divine Legation to convert the MUTE RACE. Such, it seems, is the Effect of that FAITH, which conferred the Title of Saintship on him, who fulfilled the Command of preaching it to EVERY CREATURE.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(360-6.) Amidst all the various Mixtures of Superstition, by which TRUTH has been polluted, our Poet next inquires where it may be found pure and unpolluted.—These Verses contain several Hints, or Allusions to Passages in S. S. of a similar Design and Meaning. JER. ii.13. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> JOHN vi. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and innumerable other Places which clearly demonstrate that the Doctrine exhibited in those sacred Volumes was designed to overthrow Superstition; and that when we meet with Passages of a different or contrary Tendency, we may boldly pronounce them to be Corruptions and Additions of Fraud and Imposture. This just distinction ought to be made by all who would not deceive themselves or others. The capital Point is, to make S. S. consistent with itself and with Truth: if it be inconsistent with itself, the Authority is made void; if with Truth, instead of a RULE of FAITH pure, certain, and correspondent with NATURE, it exhibits that Scene of CHAOTIC Discord noted before at l. 179-193; and again l. 430-439.</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(368.) And here it should seem probable, that they, who LIVE WELL BELIEVE WELL, and that VIRTUE in Practice is a Mark of TRUTH in Opinion.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="373">(373.) Yet this Proof, in Fact, is insufficient. For though in Reality TRUTH and VIRTUE coincide, and mutually fit, or tally with each other, yet they are not the same. Truth is the Conformity of our Perceptions, Ideas and Notions with NATURE: Virtue is the Conformity of our Affections with NATURE. Their Difference therefore arises from the different Powers, or Fa∣culties, from which they are derived. The Sources of the for∣mer are in the Understanding, of the latter in the WILL. The Understanding is improved two Ways; by NATURE and by ART. The first proceeds by Experience and Custom, from which REASON advances by a gradual Progression; the second by Instruction and Discipline. In both these Ways, when the Process is regular, and according to NATURE, the Mind, either by this single, or united Influence, acquires TRUTH; and the Affections, following the same Order, correspond, or harmonize, with NATURE, and become virtuous and right. In this Case therefore the Proofs of Truth and Virtue are reciprocal; true Opinion would infer virtuous Action, and virtuous Action would prove true Opinion. In this Process NATURE seldom deviates; but Discipline and Instruction often counteract NATURE, accord∣ing to that Maxim of antient PHILOSOPHY: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HIEROCLES.</NOTE>. When this happens either through Mistake or Design, the Opinions derived from it become false, or fantastical, and the Affections, following the same Directions, become unnatural and vicious; and this always happens in some Degree proportionable to the Prevalence of Superstition, on which such Discipline and Instruction is founded. Neverthe∣less, as Superstition allows, licences, or indulges Truth and Virtue within certain Bounds, or limits, so far as the GRANT extends, they mutually prove each other, but no farther. Beyond the Limits of the GRANT, TRUTH and VIRTUE become negative Terms, or Signs, which destroy themselves. Thus, if Opinion or FAITH be contrary to the Religious GRANT, or Licence, VIRTUE immediately changes, and becomes VICE, while VICE assumes the NAME and PRAISE of VIRTUE in the orthodox Believer, whose FAITH is fashion'd RITELY, and according to the GRANT or LICENCE. This however is ALL, which Superstition or artificial Religion can effect by this Magical Notation. It can only change the NAME; not the THING. VIRTUE, and VICE still ARE, AS THEY ARE; the LAWS of GOD execute themselves notwithstanding: Tho' the Imposition of a false Title has been employed to procure a general Condem∣nation, while Mankind are doom'd to suffer Death as the punish∣ment of a voluntary Crime, which is only a necessary Condition of their Existence.</P>
<Q>—FALSO DAMNATI CRIMINE MORTIS.</Q>
<P>The illustrious Mr. FENELON, Archbishop and DUKE of CAMBRAY, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his Life by RAMSAY, <HI>p.</HI> 341-2.</NOTE> equally famous for Learning, Fine Taste, and Virtue, says,
<Q>“There are properly speaking but TWO ARTI∣CLES of Religion, THE LOVE OF GOD, AND OBEDIENCE ”TO THE CHURCH.</Q>
But JESUS CHRIST, without mentioning the CHURCH, had before recognis'd only TWO ARTICLES of Religion; "THE LOVE OF GOD, and THE LOVE OF MAN." In this FAITH the Agreement with TRUTH and NATURE is perfect; in the other Repugnance, and ev'n Contrariety are possible. The LAW OF GOD, or NATURE obliges us to see, and own a Difference between BLACK and WHITE, BITTER and SWEET, VICE and VIRTUE: But when the CHURCH commands, every Believer who is initiated, inlisted, and inroll'd, is obliged to see and own that BLACK is WHITE, that BITTER is SWEET, and that VICE is VIRTUE. For thus the Religious Accountant calculates, according to his artificial Method of Notation:
<Q>“MORE TRUTH and VIRTUE added to LESS FAITH, the Sum is LESS MERIT or WICKEDNESS; and LESS TRUTH and VIRTUE added to MORE FAITH, the Sum ”is MORE MERIT or RIGHTEOUSNESS.</Q>
And thus the Fol∣lowers of such artificial Religion often find themselves obliged to HATE MAN, whom they HAVE SEEN, under Pretence of LOV∣ING GOD, whom they HAVE NOT SEEN, and according to this Method, whom they NEVER CAN SEE. But this is the com∣mon and ev'n necessary Effect of CHURCH DISCIPLINE and IMPLICIT FAITH, or BLIND OBEDIENCE, when they counter∣act NATURE and the LAW of GOD! Nevertheless, the GOOD Archbishop, in the midst of contrary and opposite At∣tractions, always preserved the INTEGRITY and specific IDEN∣TITY of TRUE MANHOOD, by exercising universal LOVE and BENEVOLENCE to ALL MEN, and kept his FAITH, LOYALTY and ALLEGIANCE to GOD entire, tho' sworn to ANOTHER MASTER. Thus it appears the good Man's Deed doth not always, and necessarily prove the Truth of his Belief; since, when it extends beyond the Limits allow'd, that Connexion is broken, and the Deed becomes cognisable only in the Court of CONSCIENCE, and according to the LAW of NATURE, in which TRUTH and VIRTUE perfectly coincide. These singular ap∣pearances, and Characters of the Excess, or Superiority of GOODNESS above TRUTH, are noted by a noble Writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LORD DIGBY. Letters to Sir K. DIGBY.</NOTE>, who observes, that
<Q>“GOODNESS many times delights the Soul, in spite of TRUTH, and so proves a TRANSCENDENT above ”it,</Q>
or as PROCLUS: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>But this Transcendence of Goodness is rare; the contrary Effect is much more common. In great Souls the Native Force, or INSTINCT of Goodness is so predominant, that ev'n in the most unfavourable Circumstances, and under the Influence of the worst Institutions, it operates and prevails against all opposition. In this Case, it is the Effect of a great Genius only, that Good∣ness seems to operate IN SPITE of TRUTH; while others under the same Influence of Superstition are MALEVOLENT in SPITE of TRUTH. This contrary Effect of the same Cause deserves Ex∣planation, as the CONTRAST is conspicuous, and exhibits a moral Picture with the deepest Shades and strongest Expression.</P>
<P>It has been said above, that the Effect of Superstition in cor∣rupting the MORAL SENSE and NATURAL Affection, is NE∣CESSARY. This is certainly so, when the System of Superstition, as there supposed, is received with IMPLICIT FAITH. But in the Good Man, who alone can be properly called the truly GREAT, or HAPPY Genius, this Opposition between TRUTH and VIRTUE, and the Transcendency, or Superiority of the latter above the former, is Apparent only, not Real. He soars above the Clouds of Superstition, which do not hinder him from moving, but only conceal his Motives. He overlooks the dim Prospects of IMPLICIT FAITH; to him those Minutenesses va∣nish, and become invisible Points: He believes, and sees, and feels as Things are, truly, and according to NATURE: He is benevolent from Instinct, TASTE, or Temper, improv'd, and matur'd by Reason and Experience. He knows that TRUTH only can make us FREE; and tho' perhaps he doth not always speak, yet he always thinks and acts FREELY. Thus far, but no farther, a wise and good Man may submit to the Tyranny of Superstition. On the other hand, the very Capacity of perceiving Truth excites Malevolence and hatred in a bad Temper, against those especially, who think and speak, and act FREELY. This Freedom is not applicable to Vice, or Licenti∣ousness; which is indeed real Slavery; as it gives the Temper a Biass contrary to NATURE. It is a Freedom from the Bondage of Superstition; which Bondage coincides with Vice. For as Vice consists in a sort of a Serpentine KNOT, or Intertwining of wrong Opinion, wrong Affection, and wrong Action, which run into each other; so this Knot in most Cases is tied, and in all drawn faster, and closer, by the Force of Superstition. The Freedom therefore, which is derived from Truth, is an harmonious Correspondence, or Symphonising with NATURE thro' all the Powers or Faculties of the Mind; which accord∣ing to a certain Growth, or progressive Improvement of REASON, being review'd, and recognis'd, become the Sources of right Opinions, of natural Affections, and of reasonable Action. This produces a perfect Consistency, and Agreement in the Mind, when the Imagination, the Will, and the Judgment act in Concord and Harmony with each other; from which Con∣cord arises that Peace, Security and Acquiescence in the Order of Providence, which is both the Effect and Reward of VIRTUE, and is a State of perfect FREEDOM. This is the Summit, or highest Point of human Perfection and Happiness; and must necessarily, as we see in fact it doth, produce Envy and Hatred in those, who at the same time see it attain'd by others, and feel their own Inability of attaining it. Now tho' all Men, the Poor as well as the Rich, the Ignorant and the Wise, have the Ability of attaining it, and do indeed naturally tend to this Point, yet that Tendency is perverted, in some by the Predo∣minance of some particular Passion, and in all by the Prevalence of Superstition, which gives Force and Malignity to every Passion. When a Man is thus trammel'd, he is compell'd to draw. He frets; he rages; yet deserves to be pitied, ev'n when most outrageous. And he wou'd well deserve it, if that Rage only hurt himself, and if it were not often directed against the Innocent and Virtuous. Then what Disguisements! What Struggles! What Distortions! to conceal his Pain; to dissemble Truth; to recommend Falshood? Genius, Knowledge, Learn∣ing, if they are not strong enough to counteract the Venom, always render it more Powerful and Malignant. If a Writer; the Poison, not of Asps, but of the mad Dog "is under his Lips." He snaps and bites at all he meets. He is reduced at last to the lowest and most abject State of Slavery; to see Truth, which he dares not own, and to commend Virtue, which he cannot practice. He therefore hates FREE-THINKING; because "it belongs to a FREE MAN only to speak TRUTH." <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. MENANDER.</P></NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(373.) Thus the Proof of Truth from Virtue is sufficient. But if the Argument be converted, and False FAITH be inferr'd from vicious Action, here it seems to prove too much; since it proves the falshood ev'n of the most orthodox Christian FAITH. —It must be own'd however that this Excess of Proof is only apparent, and in this particular Case; for all Vice is owing to false Opinion, either implicit, or explicit, or else to unnatural Affection, or Passion, derived from false Opinion.—Our Poet uses the Argument ad Hominem; and the Christians, here characteris'd, are not REAL, but only NOMINAL.</NOTE>

<Q>“The ”FATHERS</Q>
(as they are called)
<Q>“are said sometimes to have mention'd the Earthquake which defeated the Attempt of JULIAN in rebuilding the Temple at <HI>Jerusalem</HI>, only to sup∣port some favourite Point of Doctrine. So AMBROSE, it seems, urged this Miracle to THEODOSIUS, to confirm the ”important Doctrine of Persecution.</Q>
It was well (says a certain great CHAMPION of IMPLICIT FAITH, from whom this Account is taken;) it was
<Q>“WELL THIS MIRACLE was ”performed by GOD, to DO HONOUR to HIMSELF.</Q>
for if it had been performed to do HONOUR to the Bishops of the CHURCH, they seem not to have deserved it; since one of them excited his Flock, (poor Lambs!) to burn a <HI>Jewish</HI> Synagogue. The Fact was justified by AMBROSE, on the Authority of this Miracle, with a modest HINT to THEODOSIUS, "TO REMEMBER THE FATE OF JULIAN." Now what may be suppos'd to be the Cause of the good FATHER'S Zeal? Why, Complaint being made to THEODOSIUS, that the Christians, by Instigation of their Bishop, had burnt a <HI>Jewish</HI> Synagogue, the Emperor punished their outrageous Violence, and decreed the Prelate to rebuild the CHURCH or TEMPLE, at his OWN EXPENCE. This mild Decree may seem, per∣haps partiality to the Bishop, rather than Justice to the Injur'd: Yet the good Bishop, (it seems) was offended; the good FATHER too was offended; ALL PRIESTS are offended; and, as if it was a mere Train of Gunpowder, the Resentment catches from one End of the HIERARCHY to the other. Nay ev'n our CHAMPION himself, Friend as he is of TRUTH and LIBERTY, seems offended: For (says he)
<Q>“THE IMPIETY ”OF THIS SENTENCE OFFENDED AMBROSE.</Q>
But the same accurate Writer says also, that THEODOSIUS by this Decree "SUPPORTED THE NATURAL RIGHTS of MAN∣KIND." How then cou'd the DECREE be IMPIOUS? But the learned Writer's Argument is wonderfully contrasted; for JULIAN (he says) VIOLATED those same NATURAL RIGHTS with IMPIETY, which THEODOSIUS with IMPIETY SUPPORTED. The latter is Impious because he punish'd the most outrageous Violation of NATURAL RIGHT; and the former, because he punish'd no religious SECT, but tolerated both CHRISTIAN and JEW; whom he exhorted to exercise their Religion peaceably, and only hinder'd them from persecuting each other. But this Toleration, it seems, was a Violation of these NATURAL RIGHTS which are supported by Toleration; or in plain Words, this TOLERATION was INTOLERATION. To allow the free Ex∣ercise of a Religion instituted by GOD himself (as this Writer may be supposed to believe) was Persecution; and to rebuild a Temple, of which the very Form, and Model, as well as the Worship, was appointed by GOD, and intended, and declar'd by that Appointment to last for EVER, was IMPIOUS RE∣BELLION against the SAME GOD, who also became his OWN SON in order not to destroy, but to fulfill his OWN WILL.
<Q>“But (he adds very justly) it has always been the TRICK, and has often prov'd the FOLLY, of INTOLERANTS to place their miserable Principles on such Foundations, as are ”found most of all to discredit it.</Q>
Whether this learned THEO∣LOGIST be a TOLERANT, or INTOLERANT, doth not plainly appear, while under the Magic of his wonder-working Art, and with a sort of wanton Protervity, he thus changes and transforms at Pleasure the FACE of NATURE, as well as his OWN.
<Q>ET VULTUS NIMIUM LUBRICUS ASPICI.</Q>
Meantime we may be allow'd, peradventure, to guess some mi∣serable Principle lies obscurely lurking between those two Ex∣tremes of Tolerance and Intolerance, of Christian CHARITY, and Priestly BIGOTRY. Is it DULLNESS, or SOPHISTRY, or FREE-THINKING? The ingenious Gentleman, it is presumed, will choose the second; for he loves WIT it seems, yet hates FREE-THINKING. And thus having ONCE reduced this PROTEUS to his original SERPENTINE FORM, he may now employ himself accord∣ing to his Kind, in licking the Dust of old Tombs and conse∣crated Bones, and in feeding on the Reliques of sepulchral Su∣perstition.

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="383-4">(383-4.) We have seen above (Note l. 360.) that one Effect of IMPLICIT FAITH and Superstition, is to change VIRTUE into VICE, and in the last Note, we have seen an Example of it. This indeed, in our own Country, and at this Time, may seem strange; but once there was a Time when this Effect was more common, and almost universal. That Time our Poet calls,
<Q>—the dead NIGHT of FAITH.</Q>
When ev'n the most active Passions became silent, Men were then in general too listless to affect ev'n SAINTSHIP, while the few who indulged that Vanity were disappointed. And as that is the Meridian of TRUTH and VIRTUE, in which <HI>Pope</HI> has fix'd the Height of human Felicity;
<Q>"The ONLY POINT where HUMAN BLISS STANDS STILL.'</Q>
So this was the opposite Point, or MIDNIGHT of Error and Vice, and consequently, of Misery and Wretchedness. And here one is tempted to wish that in this long Night BIGOTRY had slept for ever. But it always rises again at the DAWN of TRUTH, while as this advances, ENVY and SPITE attend its Progress, and Zeal and Persecution kindle their Flames at the LIGHT of HEAVEN. It is either in the Moonlight of Superstition, or in the Dawn of Knowledge, when these monstrous FORMS appear most terrible. Then it is, that jealous of the Growth of REA∣SON, and prevalence of TRUTH, the Managers of Superstition, under Pretence of restraining Heresy, Infidelity and Atheism, would willingly restraing also all FREE THOUGHT. With this Intention, their Discipline is extended to that early Age and weak State of human NATURE, which is incapable of Choice and Judgment. Here they lay the Foundation of IMPLICIT FAITH; here they lay their Leaven, their Poison, the vermi∣cular Egg, which grows with Nature, and like a worm in the Bud, consumes or corrupts the future Fruit; while even INFANTS are listed and sworn by Proxy into a CREED,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> and marked with an invisible SIGN, without which they are deemed unqualified for social Duties, and incapable of Happiness. So also the purest and most sincere Virtue, without a Licence, or TICKET from the Priest, is excommunicated from the Favour of GOD and MAN, while Vice, it seems, with that Passport, is duly quali∣fied to receive both.</P>
<P>There happened, it is said, a great Quarrel between the cele∣brated Mr. PRIOR and Dr. ATTERBUY, DEAN of <HI>Westminster</HI> and Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI>. They were walking together in the Abby, when an Occasion offered which produced the following Verses, <HI>ex tempore:</HI>

<L>"The Gossips are ready, the Cushions are laid:</L>
<L>"What! without my Consent, quoth the Bishop, inflamed,</L>
<L>"Go; shut up the Font: LET THE INFANT BE DAMN'D.</L></Q>
The Poet, we see, very freely, and very justly ridicules a Doc∣trine, priestly indeed, but not Christian, and equally CRUEL and CHIMERICAL. This illustrious Prelate, it seems, was a Realist in this Doctrine, though not in VIRTUE;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Sermon on 1 CORINTH. iv.19. and the Preface, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> he could not bear a jest on so serious a Subject as Damnation: which, if such Wit was allowed, would be denounced only against the Vicious, not against the Innocent and Virtuous. This would neither be agreeable to the Will, nor favourable to the Authority of those, who, for the Good of Mankind, assume the Power to damn or save. So the Bishop's Resentment was everlasting; and well it might, for the Ridicule here has all the Edge of WIT, and all the Weight of TRUTH, which no Mortal can bear, who, like the Bishop, has WIT without TRUTH, and nothing but the Armour of Superstition to defend him: though this, it must be owned, may sometimes save the Champion from being hit, as, in HOMER, the HERO was saved by the Inter∣position of a Cloud <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Iliad iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another Way, in which Superstition <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alsifies the LAWS of GOD, and assumes the Power of Damnation, or (which is the same) of Excommunication, is in the Case of FORNICATION. Here in the Interpretation of a Word, it often happens that the Law of NATURE, or Commandment of GOD is turned into a CRIME. Now the Law of NATURE, respecting the UNION of the Sexes in human Kind, is plainly this, That they be mu∣tually faithful to each other. This in the papal Scheme of Re∣ligion is called a SACRAMENT; and it is truly so called: being a Covenant or Oath of mutual Allegiance or Fidelity, of which GOD above and Conscience can be Witnesses. The Force or Ob∣ligation of this Covenant is founded in the Constitution of the hu∣man Mind, which being endued with great Sensibility with regard to the Causes, or Motives of Love, and Esteem, is rendered capa∣ble of greater Degrees of Pleasure or Pain, of Happiness or Mi∣sery, on this Account, than perhaps any other. This Sensibility is always seen more pure and simple, and therefore more delicate and refined, in Proportion as following NATURE backward we view Man in his original State, before he was corrupted by ar∣tificial Institutions, and arbitrary Restraints. This original Sen∣sibility is wonderfully express'd in MILTON. This is one of those universal Beauties in that divine Poet, which being founded in NATURE, not in CHIMAERA would deserve and gain the unanimous Admiration of Mankind.
<Q>“It is observable (says Mr. VOLTAIRE) that in all other Poems Love is represented as a VICE, in MILTON only it is a Virtue. The Pictures he draws of it are naked, as the Persons of whom he speaks and ”as venerable.</Q>
He removes with a chast Hand the Veil,
<Q>“which covers every where else the Enjoyments of that Passion▪ There is Softness, Tenderness, and Warmth, without Lasci∣viousness. The Poet transports us into that State of Innocence and Happiness, in which ADAM and EVE continued for a short Time; he soars not above human, but above corrupt Nature; and as there is no Instance of such Love, there is none of such ”Poetry.</Q>
Such is the Description of a Passion, which is the Origin of Society; and if there be indeed few who are capable of conceiving or expressing it in its original Purity and Simplicity, it is because they draw not from the Fountain, but from certain Reservoirs, which become stagnant and impure with the Mud and Filth of Superstition. The INDIANS, both Eastern and Western, were remarkable for their conjugal Fidelity, before they were corrupted by their Intercourse with the <HI>Europeans</HI>; so that it appears to be a natural Instinct implanted in Man by the Deity as the Source of social Happiness. Such then is the Law of NATURE concerning the Union of the Sexes, so clearly, so strongly, and so universally felt, that it may seem not only ab∣surd, but even impious in any Order of Men to assume an Autho∣rity to grant Licence of doing that, which contains in itself the Force of a natural or divine Law and Obligation. It is absurd to suppose Leave or Licence is necessary to perform or fulfill a per∣fect Right, and Duty; and it is impious to suppose a Power of Prohibition exists against a Duty, which if prohibited, Mankind could not exist. But where there is a Power to permit, there is a Power also to prohibit; neither of which can be properly ap∣plied in Duties, but only in Things indifferent, or criminal. NATURE in this Case is the only Security; and it arises from false Policy, and the busy Interposition of Priests, who are al∣ways crossing the Purposes of NATURE, and PROVIDENCE, that of all Parts of the World, the <HI>European</HI> Nations are the most dis∣solute and incontinent; and from this particular Corruption, which now is become general, arises many other Corruptions. The very Name of MATRIMONY includes all the Relations of FATHER, and MOTHER, of HUSBAND and WIFE, of CHIL∣DREN, of BROTHER, and SISTER; and of all the familiar CHA∣RITIES, and social Friendships, which arise from customary Ne∣cessitude. This is the first Link in that Chain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prima Societas in ipso est Conjugio. Id autem est Princi∣pium Urbis, &amp; quasi Seminarum Reipub. CIC.</NOTE> which holds to∣gether civil Society, which if it be broken by Incontinence and Infidelity, the whole Chain, which is composed of many such Links, is in Fact broken too. There can be no civil or public Union, where there is no private, familiar, or matrimonial Union. All other Laws <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">QUID LEGES SINE MORIBUS? HOR.</NOTE> are useless, and ineffectual. But MATRIMONY is not an external or artificial FORM, but a NA∣TURAL or substantial FORM. NATURE itself, or the LAW of GOD, bounds, or determines it. Where there is a MOTHER, there is always MATRIMONY; unless by human Artifice the na∣tural Connexion be broken: and if we take the pains to range together in Order, the Ideas and Sentiments, which arise on this Subject, the true Essence, or Definition of MATRIMONY may be thus expressed:
<Q>“It is the Union, or Communion of ONE MAN with ONE WOMAN, arising from natural Affection, certified and established by free Consent, confirmed by Tye, ”and sanctified by mutual Fidelity, for social Happiness.</Q>
The Priest therefore, who excommunicates, or damns a Person, who fulfills this Duty, without his LEAVE, denounces Damnation against a Virtue, the simplest, the purest, and most perfect, in∣tirely conformable to the Law of GOD, and to the Order and Welfare of civil Society. The Presumption, so strongly mark'd, according to his Manner, by the tragic Poet, in the Case of poor OPHELIA, is here much aggravated:
<Q><L>—Lay her i' th' Earth;</L>
<L>And from her pure and unpolluted Flesh</L>
<L>May Vi'lets spring! I tell thee, churlish Priest,</L>
<L>A min'string ANGEL shall my SISTER be,</L>
<L>When thou liest howling.
<BIBL>SHAKESPEAR.</BIBL></L></Q>
On the other hand the FORM or ESSENCE of FORNICATION is this:
<Q>“It is the promiscuous Commixture of many Men with one Woman, without natural Affection, without Fidelity, ”and without regard to the Care of Children, or of social Hap∣piness.</Q>
Fornication therefore can rarely be committed by one Man and one Woman only; since it supposes Prostitution either merely brutal, or, as the Word denotes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is derived from the Greek Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the Force of which will be understood from the following Observations.</NOTE> gainful; It dif∣fers from a Rape, because the one supposes Consent, the other Force. It differs also from Adultery, because the one supposes a Breach of conjugal Fidelity, the other not; it neither arises from pure Affection, nor produces it; and therefore is neither con∣formable to NATURE, nor to social or civil Happiness. Mere Lust is brutal; and in a Creature so constituted as MAN, while in a natural State he remained untaught, and uncorrupted, never did, and never could operate, without a Mixture of other Af∣fections, which purify and refine it. Since then the Nature of Man, and of civil Society in particular, seem to direct and to re∣quire a Purity and Integrity of Manners, in Opposition to In∣continence, and Prostitution, how comes it to pass that so general a Corruption should prevail, which in fact cuts off many of the natural Sources of human Happiness both private and public?</P>
<P>The Answer to this Question is not, perhaps, very obvious, It must be owned however that the Corruption, here noted, is confined to the <HI>European</HI> Provinces, where indeed it seems ge∣neral; unless it be extended also to those Regions, which have received the Infection from the Influence of <HI>European</HI> Manners; which NOW indeed is almost every where. The other Parts of the Globe remain free from this Corruption.</P>
<P>The <HI>European</HI> Climates have in all Ages bred a Race of Men more hardy and bold, more inquisitive and adventrous, and of a Genius more various and versatile, than the other Parts of the Globe. As their natural Disposition wou'd render them more sensible of Wants, so also more capable of contriving Ways to gratify them. Moreover a certain Inequality is observed in the Number of Births, in which the Males exceed the Females. This Inequality, if original and constant, as seems probable, affords a sufficient Answer to the Question. The same Genius, and together with it, the same Inequality, extended along the Coasts of <HI>Asia Minor</HI>, and so perhaps to <HI>Aegypt</HI>; while East∣ward thro' all the Regions of <HI>Asia</HI>, a contrary inequality seems to have prevailed: where a greater Number of Females gave Rise to the Custom of Polygamy, which always did, and doth yet to this Day prevail in the Eastern Countries. This reci∣procal Inequality gave rise also to a most remarkable Difference between the <HI>Europeans</HI>, and Eastern <HI>Asiatic</HI> Sages, Philosophers, or Legislators, in their Moral, Religious, or Mythological In∣stitutions, Descriptions and Representations. For in one Part the Females being too soft, and dissolute, and in the other the Males too fierce, and rough, hence it happened that, There, the Origin of the EVIL was derived from WOMAN, while Here, every GRACE and every VIRTUE was represented in a Female Form, and receiv'd a feminine Appellation. This Observation might be extended much farther; but this may seem sufficient to make us remember that Manners and Customs have often a deep Foundation in Nature, and that it belongs to Philo∣sophers and Legislators to observe that Foundation, when they attempt to describe or regulate the Order, the Connexions, and the Consequences of human Actions.</P>
<P>Let us now return to the Question. The Excess of Males, co-operating with their bold and adventrous Spirit, at first wou'd produce Rapes, but never Fornication, till the customary Necessi∣tudes of Neighbourhood, and mutual Intercourse of Friendships rendering odious by Degrees such Violation of natural Right and Freedom of Consent, as the frequent Quarrels and Slaughter of those who defended, and of those who reveng'd that Violation, wou'd render it dangerous; they were taught at last, or rather compell'd by necessity to relieve their Wants among Strangers. Thus Traffick begun, and Commerce with Foreigners; and the first Traffick was made with female Slaves, who were either bought, or stolen, or forc'd away from their native Country, exposed to sale in a strange Land, where they again prostituted themselves for hire, to supply the Want of Females. From this servile Condition, and mercenary Prostitution, the Name of Fornication is derived. And indeed every degree of Subjection, which excludes Freedom of choice, corrupts the Sanctity, and so destroys the Essence of Matrimony, and turns it into For∣nication. Matrimony, as was said before, receives its Sanction from the united Powers of natural Affection or free Choice, of Use, and of Fidelity. Where the first is wanting, the last, perhaps, is rarely found; and where the last is wanting, the Wife, however authoris'd, becomes a legal Strumpet.</P>
<P>Such then, was the Source of Fornication, derived, as it seems, from the Inequality of the Sexes. And in general it may be observed, that where the Number of the Males exceeds the Females, there Fornication is customary: where the contrary Order prevails, there Polygamy.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the same Causes, which in the Order of Nature, and by divine Providence, produced this partial Evil, have produced also a much greater and more general Good; for they extended Commerce, and mutual Exchange of Conveniences between the most distant Regions; and together with that, it is our own Fault, if, in the same gradual Progression, Knowledge and Virtue, and universal Benevolence be not equally extended; so that the whole Globe may become ONE Empire, and human Kind the Subjects and Citizens under the Dominion of ONE King, the SUPREME LORD and Governor of the UNIVERSE. But the fame Error, or Craft of political Superstition, and arti∣ficial Religon, which hath augmented this partial Evil into a general Corruption, have hitherto retarded the Progression of Knowledge and Virtue; while the former hath been chiefly ap∣plied in contriving Means to promote Luxury, and by converting the latter into a meer Name, hath substituted in its stead I know not what monstrous, and unnatural Form, or pretense of Reli∣gion, which hath turned Vice into a Trade, and sanctified Wars and Treasons, Tyranny, and Persecution.</P>
<P>Thus the Corruption, which at first may seem to have been necessary, by degrees became voluntary, and at length neces∣sary again, when it receiv'd Authority and Sanction from religious Institutions. For in the earliest Times as the Worship of dead Men deified prevaled, the Rites, and Ceremonies, and religious Festivals instituted to their Honour, consecrated Lewdness, and made it meritorious. And when the Merchant-Adventurers of this precious Commodity had brought from beyond Sea a beau∣tiful VIRGIN to the Island CYTHERA, she there received the Name of that Island; and because the People knew not her Birth, or Country, they were taught to believe that she arose in a miraculous Manner from the FOAM of the Sea, so she be∣came a Goddess, and was the vulgar or popular VENUS, the Patroness of Lewdness and Fornication. The Poets and Painters indeed, and after them the Virtuosi or Philosophers chastised and refined this Notion, till at last they converted it into a mythical, or allegorical Person, who was supposed to com∣municate to the Products of NATURE and to the Works of ART, their proper GRACE and BEAUTY. This Species of Vice however, notwithstanding these Refinements, became gene∣ral and extensive, and was the necessary Effect, and Consequence of that political Superstition, which introduced the Worship of deified Mortals, and will always prevail, in proportion as the same Superstition prevails; which being founded in Ignorance, and implicit FAITH, must necessarily check the Growth of Reason and Free-Thought, and cherish and indulge the grosser Passions. MOSES, the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Lawgiver, and the <HI>Jewish</HI> Pro∣phets, who alone seem to have understood, and follow'd his System, (for the Priests either did not understand, or corrupted it) have strongly mark'd this Connexion between MAN-Wor∣ship and Vice, and particularly with a just Severity have cha∣racterised that Lewdness, which is the Effect of it; insomuch that they denote by the same Term of Fornication or Whore∣dom, both the Worship itself; and the Debauchery, which attended it. The Christians, contrary to the Design of their Founder, have run into the same Corruption, by worshipping HIM as GOD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☞</NOTE> who always called himself a MAN; of which Truth indeed there needs no other Proof, than his Birth and Death. He rejected both the Priestly and Kingly Office: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: tho' he had, it seems, the indelible Character. This Obstinacy, or Constancy, drew upon him the Effects of a most inconsistent Hatred, and produced a Superstition equally inconsistent. He was punished as a SLAVE, and worship'd as a GOD. He was deified after his Death; which however was not intended before: For all that the Genius of <HI>Judaism</HI> al∣low'd, was, that having SEEN GOD, like MOSES, he became authorised, like <HI>Moses</HI> to be in PLACE of GOD. But this Principle being now extended, it happened, that whereas that Privilege belonged to the latter during Life only, it belonged to the former for ever. This great Change effectually deter∣mined the <HI>Jewish</HI> dispensation, and at the same time as effectu∣ally accommodated it to the Genius of Heathenism. The Heathens in Fact presently understood this Deification, and as readily admitted it. Accordingly they represented the Christians, in their MYSTERIES, as exercising the same abominable Lewdness which had been exercised in their OWN: For at this Time, partly by the Censure and Ridicule of the Free-Thinking Philosophers those Scenes of Lewdness, exhibited in the Heathen MYSTE∣RIES, had been restrained, and the MYSTERIES themselves, in consequence of this Refinement of Taste, and gradual Progression of Reason, and natural Politeness, some of them had been re∣formed, and others abolished, by the Authority of the Civil Ma∣gistrate. These Mysteries were acted in the Night; and the frequent Lewdness practised in these religious Masquerades gave occasion to the old Comic Poets to lay the Scene of their Plays, and form their Plots; which, as they imitated or represented by Action in a public Manner, and so render'd odious, or ridiculous, what was there acted privately, and under Pretence of Religion, seem to have fallen under the Penalties of Law, which made it Capital to revile what was transacted in those solemn Assemblies. Hence it happened, that being forbid to expose these Corruptions, they became more harmless and innocent (as we say) in their Draughts. This Restraint of the ancient Comedy is observed by HORACE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>—Chorusque</L>
<L>Turpiter oblicuit, sublato jure NOLENDI, ad PISONES.</L></NOTE>; and before him CICERO <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quid mihi displaceat, INNOCENTES Poetae indicant Comici. <BIBL>CIC. DE LEG. II.</BIBL></NOTE> had declared his Abhorrence of these MYSTERIES, since the Poets were com∣pelled to spare Vice now it was thus cherished and protected by Religion. Those faint and languid Descriptions, or rather Hints, of Vice, were very disagreeable to the free Genius of this won∣derful MAN, who was a most sincere and ardent Lover of VIR∣TUE, as derived from Liberty and the Exercise of Reason, and Free Thought. He exposed with a just abhorrence, and free Indignation, Vice of every kind, as appears in his character∣istic Draughts of the Manners of CATALINE, of CLODIUS, and of M. ANTHONY; for he lived in an Age when the <HI>Roman</HI> Nobility were degenerated from the Virtues of their Forefathers. This rendered him odious; and he fell at last a Sacrifice as much to the Cause of TRUTH and VIRTUE, as of LIBERTY and his Country. Nothing enrages Men of profligate Manners so much as free Censure of their Vices. They cannot bear Ridicule. Their Passions, their Opinions, their Manners, and their Actions, are all contrary to Truth and Nature. They hate those who discover that Contrariety; and wou'd hate themselves too, if Superstition did not supply means of Commu¦tation, and, which is yet a greater Comfort, of Recrimination. This double Comfort the Heathens found in their Superstition, and as Superstition supplied the Means, so these supported them in their Superstition against the Freedom and Ridicule of the first Christians. They did not dislike their Rites, their Cere∣monies, or their Mysteries; for many of them imitated their own. These then, when similar, they cou'd easily recognise; and when new, or dissimilar, as easily adopt, but they hated them for the Purity of their Manners, and the precise Reserved∣ness, and unsociable Singularity of their Behaviour: Nor was this Purity of Manners in the first Christians derived from those Rites, or Ceremonies, or Mysteries; but from that strong Renitence, or Resentment, which always succeeds, when the Force of bad Habit, or Custom, beginning to abate, Vice be∣comes odious, and natural Affection returns. For the great Difference between meer Custom, or vicious Custom and NA∣TURE, is apparent, and operates strongly in all religious Revo∣lutions. The former decays, and abates; the latter is strength∣ened, and confirmed by TIME. This Abatement of vicious Custom, at the Time here hinted, was derived from the gradual Progression of REASON, and Free-Thinking, which rising first from the inquisitive Genius of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Philosophers, was ex∣tended by Degrees to all Parts of the World, along the several Lines of Communication, which all centred in ROME. By this means People every where saw the Folly and Absurdities of their several ancient and established Superstitions; and when they saw the Absurdity, they soon grew tir'd of the customary Vices, which were connected with it. And hence they went with eagerness into a NEW Religion, which merely on Account of Novelty and Singularity, had yet gained no Connexion with Vice. But this Purity of Manners, or Virtue of the first Chris∣tians seemed rather to be a foreign Branch, adopted, or ingrafted, than a natural Shoot. For tho' Virtue was indeed inculcated, and commanded by the first Messengers, or Missonaries of the Gospel, yet it was <HI>never taught</HI>. The People were never made to see, and recognise those Principles, by which it is connected with NATURE. It was only an accidental Effect of Novelty co-operating with IMPLICIT FAITH. So the graft never took. There was indeed Contiguity; but not Connexion. The Prin∣ciple of Life, and growth was wanting. When therefore the Force of Novelty abated, the customary Virtue abated too, tho' IMPLICIT FAITH continually increased and augmented; and the Christians gradually reverted into all that Corruption and Lewdness, which they had before ridiculed and abhorr'd; of which among the Gentiles we have here attempted to shew the Source and Progress.</P>
<P>But as the Christians gradually reverted into those Corrupti∣ons, the Excess of which by exciting Aversion, Indignation and Abhorrence, prepar'd the Way for the Propagation of the Gos∣pel; so we find a particular Instance ev'n of a greater <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 CORINTH. v.</NOTE>Degree of Vice, which had prevailed among them, than had been common∣ly known among the Gentiles. It may seem strange, perhaps, that either of these shou'd happen at any Time among a People who believe, or who pretend to believe, the Doctrine of the <HI>Resurrection</HI>, and who accordingly live under the Hope and Fear of eternal Reward and Punishment; and stranger yet, that the latter shou'd happen, when the Force of Novelty was added, under the immediate Direction of an Inspired Missionary, and ev'n under the irresistible Conviction of Apostolical Miracles. But perhaps the guilty Person was only a nominal Christian, and associated with the true Believers with a malicious Design to disgrace and betray them. Or if he was indeed a Christian, the Crime might be derived from an erroneous Imitation of St. PAUL himself, who tho' he both dissuaded others, and himself abstained from the customary, or legal Forms of Marriage, yet had
<Q>“a ”SISTER, a WIFE,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 CORINT. ix.5.</NOTE> as well as the other Apostles.</Q>
By the Word SISTER he seems to mean a Believer; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>id.</HI> vi.6.vii.15, &amp; passim.</NOTE> which meaning I chuse rather than that which includes a natural Relation, and so wou'd infer Incest; and tho' it must be confessed, it is not impossible that even the latter might be the Case in fact, when we consider, that the Design of the Christian was only to ful∣fill the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Dispensation, by restoring Mankind to their na∣tural Freedom; and that PAUL, being a JEW, as well as all who believe the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Account of the Creation, cou'd not in∣deed esteem the Matrimonial Union of Brother and Sister to be incestuous, nor ever judge that to be sinful, which at the Begin∣ning was necessary. It must be own'd, however, that this Necessity, tho' (as I believe) it hath never been objected, yet is indeed the strongest Objection that can be made to the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Cosmogony, as it infers a manifest Inconsistency between That and the subsequent Institution, in which such Union is declared to be incestuous. And thus much concerning the Rise, the Pro∣gress and Essence of Fornication.</P>
<P>Now concerning the Remedies, which have been apply'd to this Corruption, it is plain they have all prov'd ineffectual. The Remedy exhibited, at the Beginning of the Christian Institution, did not in fact answer the Intention of Cure; and since that Time the Cure itself seems not to have been intended. In the first Case the Remedy did not correspond with the Intention, because it did not correspond with NATURE. It was found∣ed only in positive Command and Implicit Faith. But IMPLICIT FAITH, tho' it hath, as we see in the Effects of Bigotry and Persecution, great Force, when it co-operates with the Passions, in rendering them more Malignant, yet hath in fact very little, or no Moment in some Cases, when it acts, or is intended to act in a contrary Direction; and in other Cases when the Passions are excessive, or vehement, it ev'n co-operates with them, as before, and augments their Moment. And the Reason is plain; for when it intentionally co-operates with Passion, the Imagination, which is already corrupted, immediately suggests, without Conviction, the Opinion of Obedience to the Will of GOD; which Opinion by sanctifying the Passion, renders it more Malignant. And thus it always actuates Bigots, in whom it foments a greater Degree of furious and outrageous Malevo∣lence, than cou'd possibly be excited by a simple and compounded Passion, even in the fiercest Barbarian. But when Implicit Faith acts, or at least is intended to act, in a Direction contrary to Passion, being, as it always is, without Conviction, it produces no constant Sentiment, or Feeling, but only by a temporary and sudden Opposition of other Passions, either of HOPE or FEAR, the Mind or WILL, takes a certain BENT, or turn, in which the vicious Passion seems to receive a momentary Check, by the Force of implicit Faith, which seems also to act in a con∣trary Direction. But it only seems; for the Mind or Will, being thus forc'd without conviction, by a quick Return, pre∣sently exerts the morbid Passion, like an Arrow from a Bow, with greater Force and Violence.</P>
<P>If this Phaenomenon be here truly reported as experimental and verified in Fact, the following Observations will deserve to be consider'd, and established as fundamental Truths in Morality.</P>
<P N="1">1. That all Superstition founded in implicit Faith is directly opposite and contrary to Virtue; as it necessarily tends to foment and strengthen the vicious and unnatural Passions, and to render them more malignant. And hence it happens that in all In∣stitutions, Moral, Civil, or Religious, Vice is augmented by the very Means which are intended to cure it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That even the MORAL SENSE, and the NATURAL AF∣FECTIONS derived from it, tho' when considered as a System or Constitution of human Nature, they are manifestly intended by the Supreme Creator and Governor, to point the Way, and direct to Virtue and Happiness, yet singly, or without a Re∣gulator, are insufficient to preserve a due Balance necessary to that Purpose, and to give them Constancy, Stability and Security. For customary Virtue, or Obligation derived from the Moral Sense only, is indeed IMPLICIT FAITH; but It is IMPLICIT FAITH founded in NATURE; not as Superstition, in Chimera. The former therefore tends to the Perfection of Nature; the latter to the Corruption. But as the Implicit Faith, or customary Error of Superstition, renders the unnatural Passions more malig∣nant, so the Implicit Faith, or customary Enthusiasm of the Moral Sense, sometimes renders the natural Affections excessive. I say <HI>sometimes</HI>, but not <HI>always</HI>, nor often. Perhaps it would <HI>never</HI> produce that Effect, if the cross Operations of Superstition were totally removed. It wants therefore a Regulator, to balance the Movement ev'n in a natural State; and much more when it sinks under the unnatural Pressure of Superstition. This Regulator is REASON or FREE THOUGHT; which discovering in the Constitution of Things the means and the End, recog∣nises the LAW of NATURE, or WILL of GOD, and shews the Connexion between Truth, Virtue and Happiness, while Conscience arising from that Review and Recognition, becomes a voluntary Obligation, and MAN a free Subject of the LORD of NATURE.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it happens also, that the BIGOT, or superstitious Re∣ligionist, whose Religion is founded only in IMPLICIT FAITH, views and represents human Nature as corrupt, though the Cor∣ruption indeed either is not in NATURE, but in the Medium, through which it is view'd; or else is first introduced by Super∣stition, and then augmented by that which is pretended to be a Cure.</P>
<P N="4">4 Hence also may be discovered the Cause and Essence of that, which in S. S. is noted as a Secret under the Name of the
<Q>“MY∣”STERY of INIQUITY.</Q>
This Secret, or Mystery, is in Fact nothing more than the necessary Effect of Superstion, in corrupt∣ing Mankind, as here described, and of the Application of wrong Means in curing, which indeed increase and augment it.</P>
<P>MANDEVILLE, the Author of "the Fable of the Bees," in various Instances, characterizes truly, and ridicules this Corrup∣tion, which yet, by an habitual Mistake of implicit Faith, arising from the Corruption itself, he represents as natural. He felt the Force of this Possession in himself, and saw it in others; but saw not the Cause. He acknowledged it too: and this at least was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngenuous. Divines, however, with their usual undistinguishing Imputation, treat him as a Monster of Impiety; because it seems he has drawn a "FORM of GODLINESS without the SPIRIT." a Spectre of Religion without VIRTUE, and without Sub∣stance. This is the Imputation. Perhaps it is true; but it is certainly true, that he did not make, but discover it. It is not His, but their OWN: and this is His Impiety.
<Q><L>"—Ye holy Men</L>

The Poet,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Tragedy of GUSTAVUS VASA.</NOTE> we see, gives the Work to the proper Artificer. This was just; but though the Muse is sagacious as well as just; it would require all her Sagacity to unfold the Secrets of this Art.

The various Systems of Superstition, or artificial Religion, which have been employed to dress and adorn Nature, have at the same Time covered its Deformity, and concealed its Beauty. This sacred Garment hath been turned and cut in a thousand fan∣tastic Fashions, till now at last, Time and Use have worn it so thread-bare, that all but the Wearer see the Stuff and the Workmanship. 'Tis a Sort of regimental Coat made to fit all Shapes, and Sizes. Virtue, under this Disguise, becomes a Name only; a mere Pretence; the Effect of Pride, drawn out into a coarser, or finer Thread of Simulation. We all see this Truth; all complain of the general Corruption; yet still with one single Exception. MANDEVILLE attacks this Exception, and turns it into a Proof. We are pleased to find in his Pictures a Truth, and a Likeness, but angry to see our own Likeness: and he resembles the Painter who pleased every Body and Nobody. It is also objected to him that his Figures, though truly designed, are yet for the most Part drawn from low Life, and so unworthy of Description: but we ought also to consider, that, in order to acquire a real Knowledge, NATURE must be viewed in all her Works. Not only the vegetable, the animal, the rational Creatures display the Wisdom of their Creator, but even Stocks and Stones. And in the moral Science, which is indeed the proper Knowledge and Business of Man; not only the Learned, the Noble, and the Wise, but the Ignorant, the Base, and the Foolish, are also proper Objects of Consideration; since even "of these STONES GOD is able to raise up CHILDREN unto ABRAHAM."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. MATT. iii.</NOTE></P>
<P>If such as above described, be the necessary Effect of Su∣perstition, in propagating Vice and Corruption, all wise and good Men will sufficiently feel the Force of Duty and Obligation to unite their Endeavours, and exert their Power of opposing it. For
<Q>“if TIME (as Lord BACON says) alter Things to the worse; and Wisdom and Counsel shall not alter them to the better, what shall be the End? We see the Reign or Tyranny of CUSTOM, what it is. Superstition is now so well advanced, that Men ”of the first Blood are as firm as Butchers by Occupations.</Q>
And are not Men to be found of the whole Blood (to appropriate his Lordship's Expression) as staunch and sure in Truth and Vir∣tue, as the Hell-hounds of Superstition in Vice and Falshood? There is now an apparent Contrast, or Opposition of Character between those who, following Custom, are continually altering Things to the worse, and those, who keeping their Minds open to Conviction, are prepared to receive continual Amendment: In a Word, between the superstitious BIGOTS, and rational FREE-THINKERS. The Former indeed accuse the latter as Innovators:
<Q><L>"As if Religion was intended</L>
<L>"For nothing else but to be mended.</L></Q></P>
<P>They accuse them too of Impiety and ATHEISM. This Accu∣sation doth not deserve an Answer; as it is notoriously false. And as to the Business of Innovation; the Accusation perhaps were true,
<Q>“if TIME stood still; which contrariwise moveth so round, that a froward Retention of Custom is as turbulent a Thing as Innovation. TIME itself is the greatest Innova∣”tor;</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">BACON.</NOTE> yet so, that by such Innovation, the Wise and Virtuous are still rendered greater Slaves to the Foolish and Vicious. Add now to Time Experience, to Experience Wisdom, to Wisdom Benevolence and good Intention, the Conjunction, will produce a Reformation, which, by approaching still nearer to TRUTH, cannot fail, in some degree, of producing a good Effect in re∣deeming Mankind from the Bondage of Vice and Superstition, and in restoring to REASON it's natural Freedom, and just Au∣thority. Mankind is capable of Improvement in an endless Pro∣gression. This is plain from the present Order and Constitution of Things. They who neglect this Improvement in the present, and refer it wholly to a future State, blend together and confound certain with uncertain, known with unknown. They imitate the ignorant Rustic, who stood waiting on the Bank till the Stream should all be pass'd.
<Q><L>Rusticus expectat dum defluat Amnis; at ille</L>
<L>Labitur, &amp; labetur in omne volubilis Aevum.</L></Q>
By this Discipline they swell the Mind with an unnatural Pride, the Parent of false Virtue, which is indeed the worst Sort of Vice, and fill it with vain Hope and fond Expectation of future Perfection imaginary and unknown, while they neglect present Improvement, which is real and known. If some inspired Nurse should teach the next Generation to keep their Children swathed and bound till they were full grown, under Pretence that by the early Use of Legs and Arms men were assisted in the habitual Perpetration of Mischief, and that by stopping their Growth much Evil would be prevented, for which, in a future State they should be rewarded with Wings; moreover if the Clergy finding this Fondness tended to promote the Honour and Profit of their Office, should defend and propagate the Practice with all their Arts of Learning and Eloquence, and expatiating largely on the glorious Perfection of High-flying, should descend par∣ticularly to explain and illustrate the wonderful Strength, Pro∣portion and Activity of those Nerves and Muscles, which are adapted to perform all the various Motions of flying: doubtless we should soon see (at least in the Imagination of every Believer) Wings pullulating as fast as those of a Butterfly. It would be a pleasant Amusement for the Painter or Poet, to represent or describe the several Sorts of these atheriel Wingsters. A bulky Doctor, whose Weight and Power of Gravitation was great, would be seen to rise, or scarce perhaps to rise with Difficulty:
<Q><L>"As when a Dab-chick waddles through the Copse,</L>
<L>"On Feet and Wings, and flies, and wades, and hops.</L>
<L>"So lab'ring on with Shoulders, Hands and Head</L>
<L>"Wide as a Windmill, all his Figure spread,</L>
<L>"He tries, but tries in vain, th' aerial Race,</L>
<L>"And seems to emulate a Gander's Face.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Parody from POPE.</NOTE>"</L></Q>
The Flock of Curates, as being lighter, and less incumber'd with corporeal Weight, wou'd resemble Jack-Daws and Squeal∣ers, who are seen most about Churches and Steeples. More∣over, as every one during his State of Humanity or Probation, that is while his Wings were growing, and before his Conver∣sion, or Transformation, might be suppos'd to write with a Pen made with a Quill of that particular Fowl, whose Form he shou'd hereafter assume; hence the Harmless Composers of Devotional Tracts, of Calls, Meditations, Preparations, and the like, would imitate that Species of Pidgeons, which from the Manner of their Flight are denominated Tumblers. One yonder, though glorying in the Spoils of the Peacock, and even dazzled with the Splendor of his Plumage, upon a nearer View may be discovered to be a Jay. Another, who, having missed his Way to the upper Regions, may be seen wandering below in the Fields of <HI>Elysium</HI>, and hopping about with an Air of Impudence mixed with Malevolence, is heard to chatter hard Names, as Fool, Rogue, Infidel, Atheist, and the like: This Fowl, I say, party coloured as he is, and variegated with black and white, commonly passes for a Bird of Learning, and a great Critic. He is a strong Proof of the old Proverb "that Two of a Trade "can never agree: For though he hates Mathematicians, yet he affects Demonstration. From all these specifical Marks, or Characters of this Bird, one may easily know it to be a Chick of that Breed, which the MUSES heretofore are said to have trans∣formed into MAGPIES. Proctors, Apparitors, and the rest of the inferior Fry, who are retained as Spies and Informers, to cer∣tain ecclesiastical Inquisitors, may be changed into Crows, Ra∣vens, and Vultures; which though by Nature intended to feed on Carrion, yet too often devour Lambs. Rich Rectors, plural Incumbents, Prebends, Canons, Deans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who feasting on the Remnants of Loaves and Fishes, and on the Reliques of primitive Poverty, take a Pride in following the Rules and Ex∣amples of Christian Humility; all these assume the Forms and imitate the Flight of Kites, Gleads, and Buzzards. They mount aloft in the Sky, and expatiating in large Circles, look down with Contempt on all those Birds, which cannot soar so high as themselves. They are however, much more harmless than the last mentioned; though it must be confessed, they some∣times stoop to seize a Chicken. But the far greatest Number, ac∣cording to an old Observation, rise no higher than Bees, and never become Birds. These, it must be owned, are a very use∣ful little Creature, and seem to be endowed with a most exqui∣site Sense, or Tast of Happiness; since they spend their Time and find their Food among the most beautiful and fragrant Flow∣ers, from which they extract, and prepare a certain liquid Sweet, that may be esteemed both the Nectar and Ambrosia of Immor∣tality. One Circumstance, however, must needs impair their Fe∣licity. According to Naturalists they are frequently infested by a certain Insect, like a Spider, which breeds in their Hives, and makes them sick. This Insect, it seems, is known by the Name of CLERUS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLIN. N. H. xv.19.</NOTE>. If these little Creatures could foresee this Incon∣venience from the Beginning, certainly they would never desire Wings, but choose rather to remain for ever swathed, and bound up, in the imperfect State of Maggots. The ancient <HI>Aegyptians</HI> understood the swathing Practice; or rather perhaps were the first Inventors of it; since they were the first who seem to have cul∣tivated with Care, the Seeds of Superstition. They begun the swathing Discipline very early, and continued it after Death; for even their dead Bodies were swathed with a most religious Dili∣gence. This could hardly be done to prevent their walking, as that indeed hath been rarely seen; and they were too wise to provide so operose a Remedy to prevent a Fact which happened but seldom. It was therefore intended to promote the Growth of Wings; which Custom beginning in the earliest Age of In∣fancy, then towards the middle, and so to the latter End of Life, being interrupted, was now again renewed after Death, which completed the Operation. On the other Hand, they who are unassisted with this swathing Method, must be contented for ever to want Wings; and what is worse, are not only hated, but even condemned to the worst of Punishments, because they willfully reject, and seem to despise an Advantage which can only be acquired by this swathing Method. These therefore are Free-Thinkers. They pretend however that both the Reward and the Punishment are equally chimerical; that if they were real, yet the Method proposed can avail nothing, either to ob∣tain the one, or to avoid the other. They affirm, that as it is uncertain whether the swathing Method will hereafter produce Wings, so at present it must certainly contribute to make us lame. Man cannot be more wise, more happy, or more perfect than NATURE has intended: for NATURE is the WILL, or LAW of GOD. They choose therefore to walk on sure Ground, rather than to indulge a superstitious Fondness, and vain longing after unattainable Perfection: and instead of artificial, or miraculous Wings, are contented with the natural and free, as well as more secure Use of Legs and Feet. They acknowledge that this too is improveable. They see a Difference between the Gait of a Taylor and Dancing-Master; and between the Air of a Pea∣sant, and of a Gentleman. This Difference depends, in a great Degree, on Custom and Discipline. The same, or even greater Difference is observable in the Mind and Manners. And since a certain illustrious Prelate has asserted "that without HOPE "RELIGION is mere PHRENZY; and since this also seems to be intended as a Characteristical Description of those, who are promiscuously denominated Free-thinkers, Infidels and A∣theists, it may seem proper perhaps, in this Place, to explain what the Hope of a FREE-THINKER is; leaving, in the mean Time, the Account of INFIDEL and ATHEIST to those who claim the Title. The Hope of a Free-Thinker differs in gene∣ral from the Hope of a Superstitious or artificial Religionist. This is uncertain and chimerical; whereas That, if not certain, is yet probable, being founded in NATURE, and in the Course of Things. The Religionist hopes that Superstition, the Free-thinker that Reason and Truth may prevail. He sees, as before hinted, a gradual Progression of Knowledge and Manners, and that this Progression is improveable. And as he feels it to be his Happiness, so he really thinks it to be his Duty to assist this Improvement. And as in every preceding Revelation, or Re∣formation of Religion, he sees this gradual Progression still ap∣proaching nearer to Truth, and consequently the Means of Know∣ledge, and the Sense and Obligation of Virtue to be more and more extended; from this View he not only forms a pleasing, but fixes a probable Expectation, that one time or other, according to the stated Course and Order of Things, Truth and Virtue will universally prevail, and that all Mankind will become free Sub∣jects of that ROYAL LAW,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. II.8.</NOTE> which is truly the LAW of NATURE, and the WILL of GOD. Thus he hopes, and not only hopes, but prays continually, according to the Direction of a Great FREE-THINKER: "THY KINGDOM COME." This is the Point which terminates his Hope. To this capital Point the whole Order of Things seems to lead in a certain Progression, and by a clear and manifest Connexion. Here then he rests. Not as the superstitious Bigot in a Circle of Tales, unconnected among themselves, and contrary to Nature; nor as the artificial Bigot, who forms and reforms those Tales, till they obtain, as he thinks, a Connexion among themselves, and a Similarity, or Conformity with Nature; which vain Labour plainly shews the Necessity of referring Truth to a more certain Standard than mere Imagina∣tion. This Standard is the LAW of NATURE, or WILL of GOD; which exacts a perfect Allegiance to the MAKER. This LAW includes Obligation, Sanction and Reward: all which are known, and felt, in Proportion as the Law itself is known, and felt, and recognised. Every Part of it admits a clear and precise Definition, and is capable of being expressed in intelligible Propositions, connected and consistent, with Regard to the Motive, the Means, and the End; which cannot be truly affirmed of any Species of Superstition, or artificial Religion. As to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uturity, the Freethinker leaves it among the SECRET "THINGS which belong unto GOD;" having, in this Case, no sufficient Foundation on which may be built any thing more certain than Conjecture, which may perhaps, afford Means of wishing, but none of proving. These Proofs, whenever they shall be exhibited, must rise on a Foundation more strong, more stable, and more manifest than those which are derived from the mere Visions of the superstitious Bigot, or the mere Sophisms of the artificial Religionist. Religion therefore is nothing else but a Sense, or Conscience of Obligation arising from the LAW, or WILL of GOD, expressed, revealed, and commanded in the Constitution of NATURE. By how much more freely and dili∣gently we exercise and cultivate our REASON, by so much more clearly this LAW is perceived and understood. From this Re∣cognition, formed and confirmed by the united Powers of Custom, Experience, and Reason, arises that perfect Sense or Conscience of Duty and Obligation, which constitutes real VIRTUE, or MANHOOD. Thus MAN is, or certainly is constituted and im∣powered to be, capable of performing and fulfilling every Part of Duty to himself, to Mankind, and to his MAKER; being free from all those monstrous Growths of Vice, and Corruption, and from all that Mystery of INIQUITY, which having been intro∣duced, fomented and established by various artificial Systems of Superstition, hath almost totally corrupted human Nature; while under Pretence of Religion, all the unnatural Passions have been superinduced, and Man, instead of rational and pious, hath been rendered absurd and irrational in his Opinions, and in Prac∣tice selfish, unjust, and impious. Hence it hath happened, that MEN INDEED are BRED NO WHERE;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOLINGBROKE on Retirement, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 195.</NOTE> and that it is hard to find, any where,
<Q>“a MAN, who lives naturally, and as a ”MAN.</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">CHARACTERISTICS.</NOTE></P>
<P>And so much concerning the Causes of Corruption. We should next, according to the proposed Method, consider the Cure. But this in general may be gathered from precedent Ob∣servations. The Application belongs to public Authority, and therefore I presume not to meddle with it. But as to that parti∣cular Species of Vice, of which the Essence, the Cause and Pro∣gress have been explained, I may be allowed to observe farther, that after the first Efforts of Christianity failed in correcting it, the Cure, since that Time doth not even seem to have been intended; whether it be that the Attempt was thought to be vain and impracticable (as indeed it will always be found to be so, when the Cure of Vice is attempted by Means of Superstition, which still encreases and foments it); or that the Managers of ecclesiastical Polity thought it more advantageous to their Scheme, and more favourable to their Authority, to indulge Vice, and subdue the Pride of Virtue, by controlling, in some Cases, natu∣ral Right, and just Freedom: yet so it is, that either Fornication is never punished, or that which is vulgarly called so, and pu∣nished as such, is not really Fornication. What it is we have seen before, where we have given a precise Definition of it. But when it sometimes happens, that following the Impulse of a na∣tural Affection, some unexperienced young Man proceeds to in∣dulge, and gratify it, with Sincerity and Simplicity, though with∣out the Impudence of public Notice, or ecclesiastical Licence, this is not Fornication; there is no Prostitution. It is the Effect of pure Affection; which is the true Foundation of that Love and Faith which constitutes the sacred Union of the Sexes. Public No∣tice can only violate the Modesty and Delicacy of this Affection, where it is sincere; and where it is brutal, selfish, or insincere, nei∣ther that, nor Licence can give Sanctity to an impure Passion, or Security to one void of Faith. If Nature here may not be trusted, Art much less; if the former denies her Sanction, the latter can give none. It can give indeed, and this is all that it can give, safe indulgence to the vicious and profligate, and Leave to play the Strumpet with more Security. As therefore it seems unnecessary to ask leave to do that, which, when proceeding from a pure Mo∣tive, is not only lawful, but a Duty, and when derived from an impure Motive, Nothing can sanctify; so, for the same Reason, it is ridiculous. And certainly this whole Business of artificial Matrimony, which now, through long Time and Custom, is established, and makes so great a Part of civil and ecclesiastical Polity, had originally a very ridiculous, or perhaps a very im∣pure or selfish Motive. The Motive was selfish, when the In∣crease of Wealth, and the Distinction of Names and Fa∣milies was solely intended; the impure Motives may be better imagined,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. FONTENELLE, Dialogue VIII. CALLIRHEA. PAULINA.</NOTE> perhaps than described: and both, if repre∣sented truly, would be seen in a Light sufficiently ridiculous. Yet Time and Custom have turned the Perspective, and by dis∣guising the Motives, the artificial UNION is become honourable, and the natural is rendered disgraceful. This with the comic Poet, is, "the WAY of the WORLD:" with the Philosopher, "private Vices public Benefits:," and with the Divine, the MYSTERY of INIQUITY."—The only Way to cure this Evil, which is still encreasing, is first to turn the Perspective; to re∣present Things as they appeared at the Beginning, and to treat them accordingly. Let not MAN presume to forbid, much less to condemn THAT, which GOD at first commanded. Poli∣tical Art wou'd be usefully, and therefore properly employ'd, in finding Means to protect, to support and encourage this natural Liberty. The particular Case marks and distinguishes itself. Every Woman who bears a Child, can find a FATHER, who is a MAN; for there are NOW no GODFATHERS; and this FATHER is her HUSBAND. Perhaps the Choice was mutual, the Affection mutual; and if it was pure also, single and indi∣vidual, it must needs produce that FAITH which completes the natural Union of the Sexes, and by fulfilling the divine Com∣mand, and Order of NATURE, must therefore best answer the End of civil Society. In the Rise and Progress of that Passion which connects the Sexes, and from thence produces the strongest civil Connexions, there is something too nice and tender for com∣mon Touch, and artificial handling. The very Admission of Witnesses is a Sort of Prostitution, or Fornication. It must un∣fold itself gradually, as one of those Secrets of divine ART which admits not human Interposition. It seems to include a Sort of Sacramental Mystery; which needs not, and ev'n rejects the Force of public Restraint, and of public Notice. But when that natural Union is violated by artificial Force, either both Parties are compelled into legal ADULTERY, if new Connexions are formed: or if not, which is indeed more usual, and seen in daily Experience, they are let loose to rove at random, through all the senseless Grossness of brutal Debauchery and Fornication. And this is the genuine and real Effect of that Method, which de∣riving its Force from unnatural Affection, absurd Argument, and superstitious Motives, hath been vainly applied to cure an Evil, which by that Application hath continually increased. And this is so plain, that it may seem probable the Cure was either not understood, or never intended.</P>
<P>It is evident therefore, that if the Evil be deemed real, some other Method of Cure shou'd be intended. This can be no other than gradually to exhibit a right View of Nature, of Truth, and Virtue, and to shew their Connexion with human Happiness, both private and public. Next, as this particular Vice, accord∣ing to its Origin, and progress, as before described, seems more than any other, to be founded in the Constitution of Mankind, and in the Inequality of the Sexes, it may seem too to require and deserve some Indulgence and Privilege, and so become a proper Subject of Civil, or Political Licence. Be it therefore enacted, that no one presume to keep without Licence either private or public House of Fornication, in which the Female Modesty is prostituted, and that no one without Licence visit or frequent such House of Fornication. Also that both the Keepers and Frequenters of such Houses be for ever excluded from all Public Offices, Civil or Military: Provided nevertheless the said Keepers and Frequenters of such Houses be allowed or ad∣mitted in all Ecclesiastical Offices, any thing in this Act contain∣ed to the Contrary notwithstanding. And because every CHILD, which may happen to be born in such Houses, may be consider'd as a Birth extraordinary or MIRACULOUS, such Child ought to be deem'd a <HI>Deodand</HI>, if a Male, and consecrated from his Birth: and if a Female; (since Superstition is still likely to proceed on its old Principles) hence also we shou'd obtain a sacred Order of <HI>Palladian</HI> Virgins, who, according to the ancient, and original Design of their Institution, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See STRABO Geograph.</NOTE> might become a Nursery or Seminary for the CHURCH. And so much for the Cure of Fornication; which by this Method wou'd certainly be prevented, and where it could not be cured, the Evil wou'd be turned into Good.</P></NOTE>

<Q>“They are content with so little, that in so large a Country they have rather Superfluity than Scarceness. Among them the Land is common as Air, Light, or Water; so that they seem indeed to live in the Golden World, without Toil, in open Gardens not intrenched with Dykes, nor divided with Hedges, nor defended with Walls. Healthful by Temperance and Exercise, and honest by Nature, they deal truly one with another, without Laws, without Books, and without Judges. They esteem him a Monster, ”who takes Pleasure in doing Hurt to another.</Q>
Here indeed was a noble Field for Improvement; but falling under the Management of Bigots, this Scene of natural Beauty was presently changed into a Scene of Deformity and Horror: While under Pretence of Converting these innocent People to the Practice and Discipline of a more pure and divine Religion, all the grossest Corruptions of Fraud and Vice were introduced; and all the Cruelties of Avarice, Rapine and Superstition were superadded. The naked Inhabitants were hunted with Dogs; Wives and Daughters ravish'd before the Eyes of Husbands and Fathers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">☞</NOTE> and Children murder'd, and torn to Pieces in the Sight of helpless Parents. All this was done by Christians to Savages and Babarians; by holy Priests, who were Chris∣tians in Name only, to those, who tho' call'd Savage and Bar∣barous, were Christians indeed: For they were mild, just and benevolent! The same Fraud and Corruption, tho' not with equal Cruelty, have been introduced among the other <HI>Indian</HI> Nations by other <HI>European</HI> Strangers, who afterwards frequent∣ed those Western Regions; the honest Quakers only excepted, who settled in <HI>Pensylvania</HI>; the Effects of which are at this time particularly seen and felt by our Colonies in those Parts. The Missionaries of Superstition, it seems, have taught the <HI>Indians</HI> to esteem <HI>Britons</HI> as a Nation of Infidels and Atheists▪ Towards these, Cruelty is meritorious; and that Inhumanity, which ev'n in a State of War is monstrous, is now become ev'n among them, the Effect of Religion. The Practice indeed is horrible! and by destroying every Instinct of Morality and natural Affection, must at length introduce the worst Tyranny of Superstition in those fruitful Countries. This, no doubt, is chiefly intended by those Missionaries; it is their Trade. They are train'd and disciplin'd in Fraud and Cruelty. But in <HI>Britons</HI>, who are born and bred in a Land of Freedom; who are Friends and Guardians of Christian Liberty; as the Consequence can never be approv'd or intended, so the Practice is as contrary to their Genius, as to the Dignity and Honour of human Nature. It is really astonishing that such a Scene of Cruelty shou'd arise from a Religion founded on the Principle of UNIVERSAL BENEVOLENCE! The Astonishment however will cease, when we consider, which is true in fact, that as in all Civil Institu∣tions, founded in Common Sense, and common Right, the Progress is from Good to Better; so in all religious Systems, founded in Superstition, the Progress is from Good to Bad. The former are improv'd and perfected by Time and Experi∣ence; the latter corrupted. The former begin, as Necessity allows, with an imperfect Association of rude and ignorant Men; the latter always assumes, or pretends the most undisputed Maxims of NATURAL LAW, which easily gaining Authority, it slips gradually and unsuspected into those blind Engagements, which produce and establish Tyranny. This Progression of human Affairs, which never rest in a Point, is manifested by Experience. Is any thing, at this Day, more odious to a sin∣cere Protestant, or ev'n to some <HI>Romanists</HI>, than <HI>Jesuitism</HI>, or than the Founder of that Sect, IGNATIUS LOYOLA? And yet perhaps his Character is mistaken and misrepresented by both. A curious Passage in the Life of PADRE PAOLO the <HI>Venetian</HI>, will render this Opinion probable.
<Q>“PADRE BOBADIGLIA was one of the TEN Companions of IGNATIUS, and living when PAOLO flourish'd. One time he freely told PAOLO that it was never the Design of his Master, that his Company should follow those Maxims, which already had gained Au∣thority among them. That if he could return to life again, he wou'd not know his Disciples, since in so short a time, they had deviated so much from their original Institution, that ”they acted quite contrary to the Spirit and Design of it.</Q>
See here then an Instance of Corruption, which grew into an Institution so early, as immediately upon the Death of the Founder gave occasion to one of his Disciples to complain, and, as it seems, ev'n to separate himself from his Company. The Case of BOBADIGLIA seems very much to resemble that of MARK the EVANGELIST, who, by refusing the Bishopric of <HI>Alexandria</HI>, shew'd, that ev'n Then some Corruption had been introduc'd either into the History or Doctrine of his Master. And indeed, if we may be allow'd to judge, and to speak freely, there appears to be so great a Difference, and ev'n Contrariety, between the prime Principles, and the several Parts of that In∣stitution, that whereas the Great OUT-LINES are clearly drawn, and strongly mark'd, according to TRUTH and the LAW of NATURE, they are afterwards fill'd up by those, who writ the History, and manag'd the Design, in a Manner which counteracts, and destroys the original Intention. In the first appear the great∣est simplicity and plainness of pure THEISM; while the other is crouded and intricated with artificial Obscurity, Ambiguity, and Contradiction, which grew apace into that System of ob∣stinate Superstition, which for many Ages prevailed; till in the XVI Century by the Resurrection of Letters it was a little check'd and restrained. So that if <HI>Jesus</HI> shou'd return into the World, he wou'd hardly know his own History and Doctrine, not only as it is NOW understood, but neither thro' all the inter∣mediate Changes and Depravations, which have been introduced from his Death to the present Time.</P>
<P>These Corruptions grew at last into IMPLICIT FAITH, and INFALLIBILITY. And Padre PAOLO being at NAPLES when some Consultations were held among the CLERGY concerning the Means of supporting them; BELLARMIN, afterwards CAR∣DINAL, whisper'd in his Ear,

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(440.) The Poet having shew'd the Incertainty and Confu∣sion of Implicit FAITH, and artificial Creeds, and the universal Disorder of Superstition and Bigotry; proceeds to shew on what Foundation Belief and Knowledge may rest, one in probability, the other in certainty! This Foundation is NATURE. NA∣TURE is the WORK of GOD; and in his WORKS his WILL or LAW is revealed. From these therefore all real Knowledge is derived. And in Proportion as Knowledge is REAL, the SENSE of DUTY or Obligation becomes REAL also. For tho' the great CREATOR hath so constituted human Nature, that all Duty and Obligation begins from SENSE, and ultimately ends in it; yet they have not their full Force and Moment, till those SENSES, from which they arise, become the Objects of Know∣ledge, and are recognis'd by Reflexion. Before such Reflexion, Duty is attended with a sort of Obscurity something like that which attends Implicit Faith. In this only they differ, which is indeed a great Difference, that Here the Impression is made by the Artifice of MAN, There by the Wisdom of GOD. Hence it is that Brute Animals, whose Senses never become to them the Objects of Reason, or Reflexion, do yet act more uniformly, and consistently with Nature, than MAN, who tho' capable of such Reflexion, is yet trained by Custom and wrong Disciplin to counteract it. And hence too appears the Necessity of right Dis∣ciplin or Education, that no Tendencies or Inclinations may be superadded to the Mind, which in their Progress may counteract Nature, but only Culture and Improvement added to those, which in their Progress advance it to Perfection. Thus the MORAL SENSE is the first natural Tendency to VIRTUE, which by a slow Progression becomes CONSCIENCE; and when by Use and Discipline they Both become the Objects of Reflexion, they then constitute a full and perfect Obligation. This Obligation is felt and acknowledg'd in Proportion to the Strength and Clearness of the Sense from which it is originally derived, and to the Care and Diligence employ'd in recognising it. And hence by Repe∣tition and Custom, Conscience itself becomes a Natural IN∣STINCT, and so by a certain and necessary Power directs, controls, and regulates all the Sentiments, the Affections, and the Actions of MAN. Lastly, by these Steps the Mind ad∣vancing in a natural Progression, sees, and recognises the Great AUTHOR of NATURE; that FAITH, LOYALTY, or ALLE∣GIANCE to GOD is the first LAW, or Obligation, and the Second is CHARITY, or LOVE of MANKIND. All this our Poet proves by regular Deduction in the following Part of his Work; and concludes with our NOBLE BRITISH PHI∣LOSOPHER, who in his ENQUIRY hath demonstrated with the greatest Force of Reason, and Beauty of Expression, that PRIME TRUTH, "That ALL IS RIGHT;" and that the united Powers of PIETY and VIRTUE contain the whole Sum of human Duty and Happiness.</NOTE>

These in Reality are the only APES, that deserve to be shew'd; while by a certain scenical or mimetic Representation, they vainly exhibit DEITY, as it were in a Tragedy, and only to untie some Knot, which they themselves have made, and which after all their absurd Diligence remains as fast as before.</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="470">(470-1.) It was noted before that Conscience is founded on MORAL SENSE, and on Conscience, Obligation. And when the WILL, which is nothing more than a Tendency to Hap∣pines, agrees, and harmonises with Conscience, then we feel, and fulfill that First and perfect Duty of FAITH, Allegiance, or LOYALTY to GOD, mentioned before. This is perfect FREEDOM, agreeable to those sage Verses of CLEANTHES:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an Essay on Happiness, &amp;c. by — HARRIS.</NOTE>
<Q><L>"Conduct me THOU of Beings Cause divine,</L>
<L>"Where'er I'm destin'd in thy great Design;</L>
<L>"Active I follow on; for shou'd my WILL</L>
<L>"Resist, I'm Impious, but must follow still."</L></Q></P>
<P>There seems to be no other Freedom of WILL than This; which is the Consent, or Agreement of it with Conscience. That is, when the WILL, or Tendency to Happiness corres∣ponds with NATURE, or the WILL and LAW of GOD. The Resistance made against this Tendency is indeed an inert, impotent, or passive Power, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">IGNAVA RATIO,</NOTE> arising from Implicit FAITH, or receiving wrong Direction from Passion, or false Opinion, deriv'd either from partial and imperfect Views of NATURE, or from the artificial Impediments of Superstition, and Bigotry, which produce the same Effect, only in a greater Degree, and more malignant. To suppose the WILL, when VICE and VIRTUE are clearly seen, felt and recognised, free to chuse either, is agreeable to the Doctrine of those, who suppose VIRTUE and VICE to be founded only in CUSTOM, FASHION, or arbitrary Command. So LUCRETIUS:
<Q>—FATIS avolsa VOLUNTAS.</Q>
Custom and Education may strengthen, alter or corrupt the moral SENSE, but can no more create it, than the Sense of see∣ing. The Mind, by a continual Effort, may perhaps attain something like the Freedom of WILLING contrary to NATURE, but this Power, or rather Impotence, which may be properly called the Deception of VICE,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is called in S. S. the DECEIVABLENESS of SIN."</NOTE> is Nothing but our own Mistake, arising from imperfect Views of NATURE; by which we are im∣perceptibly led by a general Law, while we fancy ourselves to be guided by mere WILL; whereas our REAL FREEDOM is only a perceived Concord, or Harmony of our own WILL with the LAW of NATURE, WILL OF GOD, or divine NECESSITY. For the Desires all tend to natural Objects; or if otherwise, the unnatural Tendency must proceed either from Disease, of Vio∣lence. Now if the WILL be indeed Desire of Happiness, it can be only a Combination of single Desires, by custom complicated and connected, and regulated by Reason; from whence it should seem to follow, that as single Desires all tend to natural Objects, so the WILL also should tend to natural Objects, and not to Im∣possibilities. But, if seeing Vice to be, what it really is, the Disease of the Mind, we should yet chuse it as a Mean of Hap∣piness, the WILL would then tend to Impossibility; which is absurd. And this shews the Vanity of Superstition, and of every artificial Motive of the WILL, which must be either foolishly, or wickedly applied, when it doth not correspond with TRUTH and NATURE.</P></NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(475, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) There is UNITY of TRUTH, and UNITY of WILL. With Regard to the former, it may be observed, there are no Degrees of Perception. When the SAME TRUTH is perceived by many, it is alike perceived. There are many TRUTHS, to which all Mankind have EVER assented; and a Collection of these would form a CREED, which might properly be called CATHOLIC FAITH. But this UNITY is not the Purpose of ar∣tificial CREEDS. Such CREEDS are usually a Collection of IR∣REGULARS, or of Things, in which Mankind disagree most, and which agree least with NATURE. Hence they become Marks of Distinction, and Motives of Discord.—UNITY of WILL centers in those two great Principles, LOVE of GOD, and LOVE of MAN; Each of these may be considered either as Affection, or Duty. Affection is natural, and necessary: and when it becomes the Object of Reflection, the Duty, or Obli∣gation arising from it, is made perfect by Recognition. The more therefore we study, and understand the Works of GOD, Affection and consequential Obligation will arise more pure, strong and perfect. This, as was said before, is perfect FREEDOM. But perfect Freedom cannot be without FREE-THINKING, or a just Knowledge of NATURE, and of the WILL, or LAW of GOD, free from artificial Restraint, and mere arbitrary Imposition. And without such Freedom, no LAW, or Duty being felt, or under∣stood, nothing can be produced, but implicit FAITH, or Sub∣mission to mere arbitrary Command, with consequential Vice and Corruption. For whatever may be pretended, without such Knowledge of NATURE, Affection and consequent Obligation can be derived only from Dreams, and Chimeras of Imagination, which produces Superstition and Bigotry, and renders every Cor∣ruption of the Mind more dangerous and malignant. Hence in private Life, every Sort of Vice grows and prevails more and more: In Religion, Discord, Hatred, and Persecution; and in States, either Tyranny and Oppression with servile Subjection; or, where some Mixture of Freedom remains, there we find the most just and mild Government perplexed and disturbed by con∣tinual Seditions, Treasons, and Rebellions. He that is not true and faithful to GOD, can never be true and faithful to MAN; and the more there is of Justice and Truth in human Govern∣ment, that is, the more it approaches to the REASON and TRUTH of divine Government, so much the more these Cor∣ruptions prevail, in Proportion as Superstition was admitted in the original Plan of such Government, or was afterwards intro∣duced and adopted by a strange Sort of monstrous Mixture, called "An Alliance between CHURCH and State." Now UNITY of FAITH on such a fantastical Foundation, is a mere CHIMERA· All that can be done when Men affect to build such aërial Fabrics, is to give the same NAME to a THING which is continually changing, and to express and support, by the same Ceremonies, an implicit Belief of Doctrines, which either cannot be under∣stood, because mysterious, or cannot be believed, because incon∣sistent. And even this were tolerable, perhaps, if compulsion were not added; and if the Managers of such artificial Systems of FAITH and supernatural Meteorology, did not explain it so, as either to make it unintelligible, or to make us see, it can only serve their own Purposes; which indeed are plainly enough discovered in the Contrivance, and more plainly in the Execution, by gratifying PRIDE and Selfishness, and by promo∣ting VICE, ERROR and DISCORD.</NOTE>

The WILL, being only the Result, or complicated Power of various Desires, hence arise various and sometimes op∣posite Attractions; and while these often act instantaneously, the Mind perceives not their true Moment.

REASON, it must be confessed, has a hard Task, when in contending with so blind an Adversary, and being obliged to oppose Brute Force, it is re∣presented as contending with GOD. In answer therefore to the Zealot, who proves the Necessity of ONE Belief, or of UNITY of FAITH, from the WILL of GOD, our Poet joins Issue, by ap∣pealing to his WORKS; in which is plainly manifested a SAME∣NESS, or UNITY, amidst an infinite VARIETY.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See HUTCHESON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> But this Unity is not a Sameness of Names, or of FORMS and MODES of Belief, and Worship, but of Design expressed and executed by infinite Variety of Means; which in MAN, is UNITY of WILL and REASON, contending to one Point of Happiness, ALLEGIANCE to GOD, and BENEVOLENCE to MAN.—This is the Doctrine of our religious and philosophical BARD; and this the Answer which he supposes GOD makes by his Works in behalf of MAN; whom the Zealot blindly affecting to exalt him to Divinity by implicit FAITH, in reality degrades to the lowest Rank of Bru∣tality.</NOTE>

<Q>“there was NEVER MIRA∣CLE wrought to convert an ATHEIST, but to convert the ”IDOLATERS and Superstitious.</Q>
For MIRACLES being Part of Superstition, it has always been found more easy to drive out one Species of it by another, and to change, than to cure it. MIRACLES violate the Order and Union of NATURE; and are therefore apply'd by the Religionist as artificial Means to form an Unity of Belief not founded in NATURE, and as they do not correspond with NATURE, they overthrow, or corrupt, the genuin Proof, and Reve∣lation of DEITY, and so always introduce either ATHE∣ISM, or POLYTHEISM.
<Q>“The slow Progress of NATURE (says Bishop BERKLEY,) is the Way, in which GOD reveals his Wisdom and Goodness. Without that Uniformity, which we call NATURE, all human Design, Sagacity and ”REASON wou'd be Nothing.</Q>

From the former, REA∣SON acquires Assurance; and the latter, by exciting Curiosity and Admiration, becomes a perpetual Source of Knowledge and Satisfaction; while by the continual Power of Both, co-operating with the Mind, we gain insensibly an immediate, and as it were intuitive Knowledge of DEITY, who thus by a marvelous Connexion reveals himself in his Works. From this Instinct of a FIRST CAUSE, Almighty, Wise, and Good, arises that Noble and Original ENTHUSIASM, which, being imperfectly understood, has produced various Effects, according to the Prevalence of those three Qualities, or Attributes, of which it is composed. When in the Imagination Power alone prevail'd, the Impression produced Dread, Horror, and Super∣stition; when Wisdom, it excited thro' Weakness of Imitation, Craft, Artifice, and Imposture; and when the Notion of Good∣ness was most predominant in the Mind, it raised Hope, Love, Presumption, and Fanaticism. Most commonly a Mix∣ture of all These together wou'd be the Effect of this IN∣STINCT, whose blended Operations wou'd produce all those various Forms and Revolutions of Religion, which in the Course of Ages have appear'd in the World; but when at last it becomes the Object of Reason, and is recognis'd and regulated by a just View of NATURE, it then discovers the Source and Origin, and becomes the Rule, and Measure of all Truth and Virtue, and of all LAW and RELIGION. It may be truly called the PRIME PHILOSOPHY; or That to which all LAW and Religion, as to their first Principles, must be reduced. It hath been called LIGHT, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ΦΩΣ.</NOTE> VISION, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> WORD, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">ΑΟΓΟΣ.</NOTE> ineffable, and impossible to be revealed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

And tho' in an∣cient Times, while Reason was in a State of Infancy, it seems to have been scarce recognis'd ev'n by those great Genii, who assum'd the Office of Legislators, and effected an immediate Intercouse, and Communication with DEITY; yet in the Progression of Reason, as NATURE is more mi∣nutely explored, and new Scenes of Order, Wisdom and Goodness are discovered, this <HI>first</HI> Principle of TRUTH is more clearly seen and acknowledg'd; which affords ev'en a Proba∣ble Expectation, that at last ALL MANKIND shall be par∣takers of this great Universal LIGHT, or REASON, when the Darkness of Error, Superstition and BIGOTRY shall be dissi∣pated, and in the Language of MOSES, when, "ALL THE "LORD'S PEOPLE SHALL BE PROPHETS.</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(588.) We may apply, perhaps, with equal Propriety, and ev'n with more Force to this INSTINCT or NATURAL ENTHU∣SIASM the Observation of a great Critic, concerning the LOVE of ELOQUENCE, which in his Time, it seems, thro' the Ar∣dour of Youth and Inexperience, was noted sometimes to be excessive. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> — <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">D.

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(590, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) It is not here intended to be signified, that the Manner, the Time, or Place of Punishment is unknown to all but GOD; he who transgresses the LAW, feels the Punishment, either immediately, as it hurts Conscience, or consequentially, as it produces Effects, which hurt it. And this in the same Manner, (and unless human NATURE be much corrupted) the same Necessity as any Wound, Bruise, or Disease hurts us. The LAW of GOD executes itself. This Place is only intended against those who substituting themselves in Place of GOD, as∣sume a Power of distributing Reward or Punishment, in an arbi∣trary Manner, without Regard to TRUTH, and the LAW of NATURE.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="594">(594, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) In such a Creature as MAN, so complicated and variable, there is need of continual Caution.—The Motto of the wise Man is "CAVENDO." According to the Doctrine of the Stoics, the UNION of the WILL with TRUTH, was express'd by the Word CONSTANCY. By WILL, they meant rational Desire; by CAUTION, rational Aversion. These were those EUPATHIES, or RIGHT FEELINGS, which include all the NA∣TURAL REFLECTIONS, and having TRUTH for their Founda∣tion, were permanent and constant. And thus the WILL and CONSCIENCE harmonizing with NATURE, produced that per∣fect RESIGNATION to the WILL of GOD, which is the supreme Good and Happiness of Man. Whether this CONSTANCY, and perfect RESIGNATION doth not exceed the Power of the most happy Genius, especially in some dark Intervals, is more than I pretend to know, or dare affirm. The AIM however is certain∣ly right; but there is need of continual CAUTION, and above all things to avoid too much AFFECTATION and SE∣CURITY. Without this Caution, natural ENTHUSIASM is apt to run into PRIDE and PRESUMPTION, and either produces that high Species of FANATICISM, whose Effects are too irregu∣lar, and often dangerous, or into a State of rapturous INDOLENCE, and inactive QUIETISM. At present, indeed, the Genius of the Age seems little liable to these Disorders; the Current seems to set another Way, and we are running into a con∣trary Extreme, of Selfishness, Sensuality, and unmanly Vani∣ties. Virtue is always best when it aims not to exceed the bounds of Nature; but when ev'n the Aim falls below that Mark, the Practise must be proportionably wrong. We have been so long influenc'd by the Chimeras of Superstition to direct our Aim at something above NATURE, that it is no Wonder if in Practice we fall below it. 'Tis hard to keep the middle Point. In this there seems to be too much Sim∣plicity, too much Gravity, and ev'n too much Severity. All these are disagreeable; but they are only so, because we are not early accustom'd to them; or because, when we were accustom'd to them, we found them connected with incon∣sistent CREEDS, which violated Reason, and with Visions of Happiness, which disappointed Expectation. So a Fondness for Trifles succeeds a Fondness for Chimaeras; and the meer Trifle is certainly better than the solemn Trifle. In com∣mon Life many things seem grievous by our own Fault, many by the Fault of others; all which Grievances are either caused or promoted by Superstition, and then falsely attributed to a Corruption of Nature. For these Evils we seek a Re∣medy in vain from Superstition. It increases the Complaint. The Managers of that Craft are either too vain to be sin∣cere, or too selfish to be trusted. They absurdly pretend to guide without seeing, to teach without feeling, to persuade without Kindness, to exhort without Authority, and to damn without Justice. The Doctors of this Cast shew Heav'n to their Followers with a certain Insolence and Caprice, as Children shew their Gewgaws, only to set the simple a long∣ing, and to amaze them with the sole Power and Privilege, which they pretend to have, of opening or shutting those EVER∣LASTING GATES. That Moment, that awful Moment of DEATH, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Besides the Cruelties inflicted on the <HI>Americans</HI>, described afterwards, and for which (otherwise hardly credible) we have the Testimony of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Bishop; the present Practice of the <HI>French</HI> Clergy is here hinted, who refuse the Sacrament to those who die without signing a certain CREED, or Confession of FAITH.</NOTE> they watch with a spiteful Diligence, to traverse the natural Progression of the Mind, which at THAT Time especially seems by a certain Necessity to fix, and settle in perfect RESIGNATION to DEITY. How cruel must be the Practice of those solemn Impostors, who on their own Terms, and in their own FORMS of Belief, expose Heav'n and Hell, and give, or take away at Pleasure, the PEACE of GOD! while the helpless Patient, with equal Pain assents without Conviction, or rejects with threatn'd Damnation! This Point of View, in which BIGOTRY is seen in its utmost Malignity, wou'd deserve to be drawn by the Hand of a M. ANGELO, or of a DANTE. One wou'd hope indeed this Subject cou'd never be realis'd in fact; but the Case is otherwise. It was usual with those, who first conquer'd and converted the INDI∣ANS of AMERICA, to hunt those harmless People with Dogs, when they hid themselves from their Conquerors, and rejected, it seems, their Doctrine of Salvation. One of their Kings, or Caciques, had already delivered all his Gold to these divine Missionaries; who, yet, on pretence that he concealed some of that precious Metal, tied him to a Tree, tore his Body with Dogs, and surrounded him with Fagots, like one who suffers by the Sentence of the INQUISITION. Then, before the Fire was kindled, the holy Priest with Heav'n in his Mouth, and his GOD in his Hand, sanctifies this dreadful Scene of impious Cruelty.</P>

<P>This may either signify a Reverence for the SUPREME BEING which produces FAITH, LOYALTY, or ALLEGIANCE, and re∣strains that impious Arrogance and Presumption, which prompts the BIGOT to explain the WILL of GOD according to his OWN MERE WILL, and without regard to that great and conti∣nual Revelation of DEITY, made by himself in his WORKS, and exhibited in that Order, Beauty and Constancy of Things, which we call the WORLD: or it may signify those Works themselves, as containing the whole Sum of his PROVIDENCE; of which, though we are unable to comprehend, or describe the whole, yet by a sober and careful Search, REASON advances in an endless Progression of Improvement, and by the same Steps, TRUTH, VIRTUE and HAPPINESS are promoted.</P></NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="621">(621.) In the mean Time, if in this Search, we should at any Time be mistaken, of this, however, we may be sure, that VIRTUE will always be right. In the Exercise of REASON there seem to be various Degrees of ABILITY, many Opportunities of Improvement in some, and in others, many invincible Obstruc∣tions: In the Practice of VIRTUE, the ABILITY seems more equal, and the Opportunities and Obstructions, in different States and Conditions of Life, seem to ballance each other. This is indeed a comfortable Consideration, which cannot fail to make us submit, not only patiently, but even joyfully, to the wise and good Order of PROVIDENCE; when we reflect,
<Q>“that no external Circumstances of Fortune no involuntary Disadvan∣tages, can exclude any Mortal from the greatest Degree of ”VIRTUE and HAPPINESS.</Q>
(See on this Subject HUTCHESONE.)</P></NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(622.) Thus Peace of Mind is established amidst all that Con∣fusion, and Discord, which the mad Zeal of CREED-MAKERS, and the blind Zeal of CREED-BELIEVERS, have introduced into Religion</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="627">(627.) And thus also we are station'd again in that PRIME PHILOSOPHY, and in that wide Field of COMMON TRUTH and NATURE, as it originally lay open, before it was inclosed with the thorny Hedges of artificial SCIENCE; or, as our Poet says (l. 71.) before the Pride of Man
<Q>"Hedg'd in th' ETERNAL'S COMMON."</Q></P>
<P>To this at last all Disputes must be referred concerning VIR∣TUE, TRUTH, and LAW: and as all Institutions civil or reli∣gious, are derived from this Fountain, so when they want amend∣ment and Reformation, to this again they must all be reduced. When therefore we consider this grand Object of UNIVERSAL NATURE; how far a FREE ENQUIRY may extend; how im∣portant these Discoveries, which have been made; how many more, and perhaps greater Truths remain yet undiscovered; and lastly how all these most evidently tend to establish VIRTUE and PIETY, and therefore promote the Welfare and Happiness of Mankind; it should seem strange that any should be found, at this Time, and in this Country especially, who would restrain this natural Progression of TRUTH; and much more, that they should vilify the Use of REASON and FREE-THOUGHT as dan∣gerous, and even impious. Yet even among these, we may
<Q>“see sometimes the profounder Sort of WITS in handling some particular Argument, will now and then draw a Bucket of ”Water from this WELL, for their present USE:</Q>
But as others of a better Genius and more benevolent Temper, have visited the Spring-head, we may be allowed, perhaps, to examine and compare their different Accounts and Descriptions.</P>
<P>There are TWO Points of View, in which NATURE, or the WORKS of GOD may be seen or represented.</P>
<P N="1">1. That in the Beginning MAN was created perfect; yet fell from this original State. This FALL was followed by a general Corruption of Manners derived from it, through all succeeding Ge∣nerations. The Effect, or Consequence extended far; for though at first Man was made immortal, yet now he became both MOR∣TAL and IMMORTAL. He was first doomed to die, and then to live again; yet so as to be miserable for EVER. This doom was irrevocable and unavoidable. Nevertheless a SAVING Method was at last discovered, which even from the beginning was secretly designed, and reserved, as virtually, though not actually efficacious, The Method was THIS; that the SUPREME BEING who MADE MAN, should DIE for MAN; offering his LIEE, or BLOOD, as a SACRIFICE, PROPITIATION, or ATTONEMENT. That MAN by BELIEVING this SACRIFICE was made for him, should again become capable of EVERLASTING HAPPINESS. Thus GOD, by his OWN DEATH, satisfied his OWN JUSTICE; and MAN became HOLY by the RIGHTEOUSNESS of GOD IMPUTED. This is called REDEMPTION. Nevertheless, as some report the Case, everlasting Happiness still rests on a very precarious Foundation; since Man, besides BELIEVING WELL, must LIVE WELL: which is the only Circumstance, in this TRAGEDY which seems to be founded in NATURE. Others affirm this Circumstance of LIVING WELL is unnessary, and that BELIEF alone is sufficient; while ALL agree that without such BELIEF VIRTUE is useless, SALVATION impossible, and that ALL MANKIND yet remain under the CURSE, and subject to ETERNAL PUNISHMENT.</P>
<P N="2">2. According to the other Description, MAN was ORIGI∣NALLY, as NOW, formed IMPERFECT. TIME, Opportunity, Experience, and a right Use of all these are necessary to unfold the NATURE of THINGS, the LAW of GOD, and the Means of HAPPINESS. Many are the Efforts of REASON in such a Creature, in such a State, blended as it is with APPETITE and PASSION, and while it grows from SENSE, confined and incumbered with it. Till at last, by a NATURAL PROGRESSION it arrives at MATURITY, sees Things in a full and clear Light, and in their true Proportions; yet sees at the same Time, that ALL CAN∣NOT BE SEEN, but that Room is left for continual IMPROVE∣MENT in an endless Progression.</P>
<P>In this SCHEME the great WORK, with all its Movements, is progressive and NATURAL; in the other RETROGRADE; re∣sembling those CYCLES and EPICYCLES of the Planets, by which the harmonious Simplicity, and Proportion of their Motions were perplexed and intricated. It seems indeed to be a mere artificial, or scenical Representation; which being SUPERNA∣TURAL, or out of the Bounds of NATURE, and full of the false MARVELOUS, is therefore very well fitted to excite and establish IMPLICIT FAITH; which exacts more Pains to over∣look, and despise, than would be necessary to see, and recognize the REAL WORKS and MIRACLES of NATURE. It is there∣fore no way adapted to promote the KNOWLEDGE of TRUTH, the Love of VIRTUE, the HAPPINESS of MAN, or the GLORY of GOD. On the Contrary it is adapted to promote, and in Fact ALWAYS hath promoted, ERROR and VICE, with all the consequential Evils of BIGOTRY and Superstition. Yet ev'n to This, which is now at last become in reality a general Cor∣ruption, a wise and good Man might submit with Patience, if omitting the usual Methods of Compulsion, and Provocation, Belief were only recommended in the more easy Way of Per∣suasion, and free Manner of Invitation: While he might be allow'd to smile, perhaps, when in search of TRUTH only, and as a sincere Lover of VIRTUE, he shou'd see so many MYSTERIES REVEALED without being understood, so much Happiness procur'd, without being enjoy'd, and so many BI∣GOTS, who believe without understanding, yet damn all who do not understand, as well as believe. For my own Part, tho' I have a great and sincere Regard for all Government, in which the good of Mankind is intended, and for our own in particu∣lar, the Freedom and Excellence of which I gratefully acknow∣ledge, yet I cannot help thinking that this very Intention of promoting COMMON GOOD is defeated by the means employ'd to effect it; and that our public System, and established Form of Religion, which is consider'd as the first and chiefest of those Means, doth itself greatly want Amendment and Refor∣mation, that it may approach yet nearer to Truth; and corre∣spond better with the Constitution of NATURE. Whether this be so indeed, and if so, which is the best Way of Effecting such Reformation, I leave entirely to the Judgment of our Governors. Mean Time, as our POET agrees with a noble Philosopher <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOLINGBROKE.</NOTE> in directing the Means of Happiness more ac∣cording to NATURE, let us follow that Direction, while we repress with equal Diligence, the PRIDE of IGNORANCE and BIGOTRY, of all MONSTERS the most deformed, and the PRIDE of FALSE KNOWLDGE, of all Vices the most insnar∣ing.
<Q>“Let us pursue the Journey of Life contentedly; and learn that as the softest Pillow, on which we can lay our Heads, has been said by MONTAIGNE to be IGNORANCE, we may say more properly, that it is RESIGNATION. He alone is HAPPY, and HE is truly so, who can say, Welcome ”Life, whatever it brings; welcome DEATH, whatever it is!</Q>
It is the Want of real FAITH, LOYALTY and ALLEGIANCE, which makes us see and feel so much EVIL, while the sober FREE-THINKER, and TRUE BELIEVER, committing himself to the Disposal of GOD, views his WORKS with Reverence and Gratitude, and sees, that ev'n Now, as well as at the BE∣GINNING, they are ALL VERY GOOD!</P></NOTE>
