<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the very favourable reception
which the Four former Volumes of
my Sermons have met with, both at home
and abroad, I had resolved not to presume
on offering any more to the Publick. To
this publication of another Volume, my
present situation gave rise. Being now, by
the infirmity of very advanced age, laid
aside from all the labours of the pulpit,
and possessing, of course, more retirement
and leisure than formerly, it occurred to
me, sometimes, to look back into Sermons,
most of which had been composed a great
many years ago, with a view to observe
how far they agreed in the strain of
thought with those which I had written
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
at a later period. In reviewing them,
passages sometimes appeared which I ima∣gined
might be serviceable, either for ad∣monition
or consolation to various classes
of persons; and the thought began to arise
in my mind, that by employing my present
leisure, as long as health allowed, in preparing
some of those Discourses for the press, it might
be in my power to be still of some use in
the world. Encouraged by this idea, I
went on to revise and correct one Sermon
after another, often making alterations and
additions, till the present Volume arose.</P>
<P>THOUGH the subjects of these Sermons
be different from those which I formerly
published, some of the same sentiments and
expressions may occasionally be found to be
repeated in them. This is apt to happen,
partly from that similarity of thought and
style which will run through all the com∣positions
of an Author who is not copying
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
others, but writing from his own reflections;
and partly, from the coincidence of some
general topicks and allusions which recur
frequently in serious discourses of the prac∣tical
kind. Where any instances of this
nature presented themselves to my me∣mory,
I found, that without altering the
strain of the Sermon, I could not altogether
suppress and omit them; and as it is not
often they occur, I did not think it requisite
that they should be omitted. If the senti∣ment,
where first introduced, was in any
degree useful or important, the renewal of
it, when brought forth under some different
form, enlarged perhaps, or abridged, or
placed in connection with some other
topick, may be thought to strengthen and
confirm the impression of it.—With re∣gard
to errors or inaccuracies of any other
kind, the Author must trust to the indul∣gence
of the candid Reader.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>TTACHMENT to futurity has
a remarkable influence on the
operations of the human mind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. I.</NOTE>
The present, whatever it be, seldom en∣gages
our attention so much as what is to
come. Remembrance of the past may
sometimes occupy our thoughts; but what
for the most part fills them, is the antici∣pation
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
of the future. The present is apt
to be considered as an evanescent scene, just
about to pass away; and in the midst of
wishes and desires, of hopes and fears,
which all respect futurity, we may be said
to dwell. As on these the life of man is
so much suspended, it becomes a very ma∣terial
part both of wisdom and of duty to
attend to any regulations by which they
may be properly conducted. For if ex∣pectations
and hopes on one hand, and
fears and alarms on the other, are suffered
to arise with groundless precipitancy, and
to acquire an undue ascendant, it is evi∣dent
that they will produce much delusion
in conduct, and often will engender much
vice and guilt. As there is a <HI>hope of the
Righteous which shall be gladness,</HI> so there
is <HI>an expectation of the Wicked which shall
perish.</HI> The anticipations of the former,
conducted by prudence and regulated by
piety, mislead him not from his duty, and
afford him satisfaction in the end. While
the expectations of the latter, arising from
fantastic imaginary prospects, delude him
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
for a while with vanity, and terminate in
misery. It will therefore be an useful sub∣ject
of meditation, to consider, in a few
instances, of what we may, and of what we
may not, reasonably expect from the world,
when we look forward to what is most
likely to happen, in the ordinary course of
human affairs.</P>
<P>I. WE are not to expect the uninter∣rupted
continuance of any measure of
health, prosperity, or comfort which we
now enjoy. There is the greater reason
for beginning with this admonition, as there
is a strong propensity in human nature to
imagine that what we at present possess
is always to remain. When no warnings
of any approaching change appear, we are
all inclined to look forward to futurity
with a smile; and to indulge the hope that
<HI>to-morrow shall be as this day</HI> and even
<HI>more abundantly.</HI> Hence, in the lives of
thoughtless men, there breaks forth so much
folly and presumption, so much pride and
levity, and often so much impiety and con∣tempt
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
of religion. <HI>What is the Almighty that
we should serve him? Or what profit shall
we have, if we pray unto him? Our moun∣tain
stands strong; and shall never be moved.</HI></P>
<P>On the lot of some men Providence is
pleased to bestow a longer continuance of
prosperity than on that of others. But,
as the term of that continuance is hidden
from us, all flattering and confident ex∣pectations
are without foundation. At
one period or another, it is certain that the
calm is to be troubled, and the dark cloud
is to arise; and how soon that period is to
come, you cannot tell. In your health, or
your fortune, or among your connections
and friends, be assured that some trial
awaits you. For human life never stands
still for any long time. It is by no means
a fixed and steady object, like the mountain
or the rock which you always find in the
same srtuation; it is a river continually
moving and flowing. Neither is it the still
and smooth stream which glides along with
the same constant tenor; but a river which
for a time may hold a regular course
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
within its banks, till, being interrupted by
rocks, it foams into a torrent, or, swoln by
foreign currents, it lays waste the neigh∣bouring
plains. Amidst such vicissitudes
of time and life, who has any title to
reckon upon the future?—To faults, all are
subject; to troubles, all are exposed. As
that man is the most virtuous who can be
charged with the fewest faults, so that life
is the happiest which suffers the fewest
troubles. To look for entire exemption
from them is to court disappointment.</P>
<P>At the same time, I do not mean to hold
it forth as any precept of religion or wis∣dom,
that we ought always to sadden the
present hour by dwelling on the thoughts
of future disappointment. What is given
us, let us chearfully enjoy, and render thanks
to Him who bestows it. Virtue, con∣joined
with prudence, may reasonably af∣ford
the prospect of good days to come.
<HI>For God giveth to a man that is good in his
fight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecclef. ii. 26.</NOTE>. Such
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
a prospect therefore he may innocently in∣dulge,
if he preserve always that temper∣ance
and moderation, that modesty and
humility, which become one who knows
that his state is ever in hazard of changing.
But I mean to warn those who, giving
way to the elation of giddy hopes, lose the
command of themselves, that by this in∣toxication
of mind they are preparing the
way for an alteration of state; they are
pushing forward the wheels of advancing
change; they are accelerating their own
downfall. To them belongs that admoni∣tion
of the wise man, would they seriously
listen to it; <HI>If a man live many years and
rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the
days of darkness, for they shall be many:
all that cometh is vanity</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. xi. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. WE are not to expect, from our in∣tercourse
with others, all that satisfaction
which we fondly wish. What the indi∣vidual
either enjoys or suffers by himself,
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
exhibits only an imperfect view of his
condition. In the present state of human
affairs, we are all so closely interwoven
with one another, that a very material part
of our happiness or misery arises from the
connections which we have with those who
are around us, and the relations in which
we stand to them. These, therefore, open
a field within which our wishes and expec∣tations
find an ample range. One of the
first objects of wish to every one, is to main∣tain
a proper place and rank in society;
not to fall behind his equals; but rather,
if he can, to surpass them, so as to com∣mand
consideration and respect from his
neighbours. This, among the vain and
ambitious, is always the favourite aim.
With them it arises to immoderate expecta∣tions,
founded on their supposed talents
and imagined merits. But perhaps, in the
hearts of all men, some wish of this nature
lurks; some wish not to be overlooked in
the crowd, but to attain that degree of
distinction which they conceive they might
reasonably claim.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="19"/>
With respect to claims of this sort it is
to be apprehended that, among persons of
all characters and descriptions, many an
<HI>expectation must perish,</HI> and many a disap∣pointment
be endured. For such is the
power which the sophistry of self-love
exercises over us, that almost every one
may be assured that he measures himself
by a deceitful scale; that he places the
point of his own merit at a higher degree
than others will admit that it reaches. All
are jealous of the high pretensions of others.
He who suspects a rival in his neighbour,
will study every method of bringing him
down to what he takes to be his proper
level; nay, often of depreciating him be∣low
it. Hence the endless mortifications
which the vain and self-conceited suffer.
Hence the spleen and resentment which is
so often breaking forth, disturbing the peace
of society, and involving it in crimes and
miseries. Were expectations more mo∣derate,
they would be more favourably re∣ceived.
Did we more rarely attempt to
push ourselves into notice the world would
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
more readily allow us, nay sometimes assist
us, to come forward. Were we content
sometimes to remain in the shade, we
would with more advantage come forth
into sunshine, and find the brightness in∣terrupted
by fewer clouds.</P>
<P>In the closer connexions which men
form of intimate friendship and domestic
life, there is still more reason for due mo∣deration
in our expectations and hopes.
For the nearer that men approach to each
other, the more numerous the points of
contact are in which they touch, the greater
indeed will be the pleasure of perfect sym∣phony
and agreements of feelings; but, at
the same time, if any harsh and repulsive
sensations take place, the more grating and
pungent will be the pain.—If you look for
a friend, or a partner of your life, in whose
temper there is not to be found the least
inequality, who upon no occasion is to be
hurt or offended by any frailties you dis∣cover,
whose feelings are to harmonize in
every trifle with yours, whose countenance
is always to reflect the image of your own,
you look for a pleasing phantom, which is
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
never, or, at most, very rarely, to be found;
and if disappointment sour your mind, you
have your own folly to blame. You
ought to have considered that you live in
a region of human infirmity, where every
one has imperfections and failings. You
assuredly have your own. What reason had
you to imagine, that the person whom
you love and esteem was to be the only
exception from the common fate? Here,
if any where, it becomes you to overlook
and forbear; and never to allow small fail∣ings
to dwell on your attention so much as
to deface the whole of an amiable cha∣racter.
From trifling misunderstandings
arising from the most frivolous causes,
springs much of the misery of social and
domestic life. Hence is blasted many a
pleasing blossom of hope; and many an
<HI>expectation,</HI> which once promised unbroken
harmony, is left <HI>to perish.</HI> I shall only
mention,</P>
<P>III. ANOTHER instance of what we are
not to expect in the ordinary course of
human affairs; that is, constant gratitude
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>
from those whom we have most obliged
and served. I am far from saying that
gratitude is an unknown, or even a rare
virtue among mankind; I think not so
ill of human nature. On the contrary, it
is my belief, that grateful sensations for
favours received are very generally felt; and,
when no strong passion counteracts those
sensations, that grateful returns are gene∣rally
intended, and often are actually made.
But then, our expectations of proper re∣turns
must be kept within moderate
bounds. We must not carry them so far
as to imagine, that gratitude is to produce
unlimited compliance with every desire
which we chuse to indulge; or that they
whom we have obliged will altogether
desert their own interest for the sake of
their benefactors. Many circumstances, it
is to be remembered, tend to cool the grate∣ful
emotion. Time always deadens the
memory of benefits. Sometimes they are
considered as having been fully recom∣pensed,
and the debt of gratitude repaid.
As benefits conferred are often under-rated
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
by those who receive them, so they are
sometimes over-valued by those who con∣fer
them. On persons of light and careless
minds, no moral sentiment makes any deep
impression; with such, the remembrance
of both benefit and benefactor is apt to
pass speedily away. With the proud spirit,
which claims every thing as its due, gra∣titude
is in a great measure incompatible.
From persons of this character, we are
never to expect it; and indeed from per∣sons
of any character we are not to be
surprised, if, in the present state of the
world, it rises not so high as we thought
we had reason to hope.</P>
<P>HAVING thus shown in some material
instances what we have no reason to ex∣pect
in the ordinary course of human af∣fairs,
I turn next to the brighter side of
the subject, and shall show what a wise
and good man may reasonably expect from
human life. <HI>His hope shall be gladness,</HI> al∣though
<HI>the expectation of fools shall perish.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="24"/>
1. WHATEVER course the affairs of the
world take, he may justly hope to enjoy
peace of mind. I am sensible that by the
sceptic and the prosligate, this will be held
as a very inconsiderable object of expecta∣tion
or hope. To them every enjoyment
which is of mental and intellectual nature
appears of small value. Give them af∣fluent
fortune and flourishing health, and
they account themselves sure of felicity.
But to these very persons I appeal, whe∣ther
there have not been many occasions,
when the want of a peaceful and self∣approving
mind has not blasted all the en∣joyments
they possessed? In the midst of
the pomp and luxuries of life, have they
never experienced the pangs of a <HI>wounded
spirit?</HI> Have they never felt what it was
to be tormented by the sense of past follies,
and to be stung with the reproaches of an
angry conscience? Dare they say that in
the midst of those feelings they were happy?
Will they not be constrained to own, that
in such moments of inward pain, they
would willingly have exchanged conditions
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
with an innocent peasant? Let them then
learn the value of that object of hope
which they affect to contemn, by recol∣lecting
what they have suffered from the
want of it.—Assuredly, the peace of an
approving conscience is one of the chief
ingredients of human happiness; one of
the most grateful of all sensations to the
heart of man: provided always that this
self-approbation rest upon proper grounds;
that it be tempered with due humility, and
regulated by Christian faith; that it never
swell into an arrogant opinion of our vir∣tue,
or into confidence in our own merits,
as if they were sufficient, without any
higher intervention, to render us acceptable
to God.</P>
<P>He, whose study it is to preserve a con∣science
void of offence towards God and
man, who upon just principles can be sa∣tisfied
that he is walking in the path which
was appointed by God, will have, in every
state of fortune, a ground of hope which
may justly be denominated <HI>gladness;</HI> for
peace of mind will not forsake him. Let
<PB N="15" REF="26"/>
the world vibrate around him as it will,
and repeat all its vicissitudes, he will not
be shaken by them. He has always some∣what
to rest upon for comfort. Wrapped
up in his own integrity, he remains sound
and entire within himself; and with a
firm mind awaits the coming storm. <HI>He
is not afraid of evil tidings; for his heart
is fixed, trusting in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. cxii. 7.</NOTE>. As he can
look up to a Supreme Power with good
hope, so he can look every man in the face
without uneasiness, when he is conscious
that no man can reproach him with having
entrenched upon his neighbour's rights, or
having causelessly provoked and attacked
him. Hence, a calm mind by day, and
undisturbed slumbers by night. Hence,
the hope of that continued protection of
Heaven which watches over the righteous.
<HI>In the time of trouble He shall hide me in
his pavilion; in the secret of his tabernacle

II. A GOOD man has ground to expect
that any external condition into which, in
the course of human affairs, he may pass,
shall, by means of virtue and wisdom, be
rendered, if not perfectly agreeable, yet
tolerably easy to him. That distresses of
various kinds are scattered through the life
of every mortal man, there can be no
doubt. But it is also to be remembered,
that to many distresses there are remedies
which it is in our power to apply; and
that with all sorrows some comforts are
mixed. So many loud complaints we hear
of the inequalities of fortune in the world,
that one would imagine the rich and the
great to be the only persons who had the
privilege of being happy; and that the
mean and the poor were doomed, without
exception, to be miserable. Be assured,
my friends, that the inequality of real
happiness is not to be measured by the in∣equality
of outward estate. When you
see the peasant chearful in his cottage, and
the labourer singing in the fields, you may
discern that there is some power in the
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>
mind superiour to external condition; that
more depends on the man himself, than on
the situation in which the world has placed
him. Would you estimate justly the sum
of happiness that he enjoys, or the degree
of unhappiness that he feels? The ques∣tions
you are to put, if the man be in pros∣perity,
are not, How much wealth does such
a man possess? but, How does he enjoy it?
If he be in adversity, not, What is his dis∣tress?
but, How does he bear it?</P>
<P>Hence arises the hope to a wise and good
man of either finding, or making his state
tolerable to himself. If he be not wanting
to himself, he is never left without re∣sources
to assist those exertions which he
makes in his own behalf. Roses indeed
are not always strewed in his path; but
from fields that are seemingly waste, flowers
may be gathered by those who look care∣fully
around them. Seldom or never do
all good things forsake, and all evils beset
a man, at once. In some corner of our
lot there are always comforts that may be
found, if we be not so foolish as to over∣look
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
them. Even in the intervals of sick∣ness
and pain, satisfactions may be enjoyed.
Returns of relief are often felt with a more
lively sensation of pleasure, than what we
taste in unbroken health. It has been often
observed that what is very severe of any
kind, seldom lasts long; and the uneasiness
which lasts, we become accustomed to bear.
Time and continuance reconcile us gra∣dually
to many things that were at first
believed to be insupportable. Providence
has in mercy provided this gentle opiate
to assuage various sorrows of human life.
What we behold others around us bearing,
we learn to think may also be borne by us.
<HI>The spirit of man will long sustain his in∣firmities:</HI>
From the treasures of his own
mind in reflection and meditation, much
relief will arise to the virtuous; and at the
bottom of the most disconsolate estate, there
lies always a secret hope that better days may
come.—From such circumstances as these,
the expectation of passing through life
with some measure of comfort, may rea∣sonably
be entertained by such as are not
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
wanting to themselves in propriety of
conduct. In looking forward to futurity,
the prospect we are to take of the world
is not that which is sometimes gloomily
indulged, of a for orn region where nothing
is to be beheld but dreary and inhospitable
wastes, and no objects are to be met with
but serpents that hiss, and wild beasts that
devour. The prospect is rather that of a
mixed region, where indeed rugged rocks
are seen, and deserts extend, over which
the tempest sometimes scowls; but where
also many peaceful habitations and fruitful
fields occur to refresh the fight. Once
more,</P>
<P>III. We have ground to expect from
the ordinary course of human affairs, that
if we persevere in studying to do our duty
towards God and man, we shall meet with
the esteem, the love, and confidence of those
who are around us. I before observed, that
in our expectations of receiving what we
think due respect and consideration from
the world, we shall be often disappointed.
<PB N="20" REF="31"/>
But that observation was applied to the
claims we make on others, on account of
talents, abilities, and superiour merits. To
such claims the world is seldom disposed
to give a favourable reception. We live
amidst rivals and competitors whose self-estimation
prompts them to depreciate us,
and of course subjects us to many a morti∣fication.
The case is different with respect
to moral qualifications. There the world
is more ready to do justice to character.
No man is hurt, at least few are so, by
hearing his neighbour esteemed a worthy
and honourable man. This praise will be
bestowed without grudging, by many who
value themselves on the possession of quali∣ties,
which they conceive to be of superiour
importance in the judgment of the world.</P>
<P>But whatever they may think, it is cer∣tain
that the basis of all lasting reputation
is laid in moral worth. Great parts and en∣dowments
may sparkle for a while in the
public eye. The world looks up to them
with wonder, as to an extraordinary comet,
or a blazing star. Distinguished virtue and
<PB N="21" REF="32"/>
worth create less astonishment; but, like
the fixed luminaries of heaven, they shine
with more steady and permanent lustre.
Unaffected piety conjoined with inviolable
uprightness and integrity in conduct, com∣mand
a degree of respect which approaches
to veneration. Candour and fairness never
fail to attract esteem and trust. Kindness
and benevolence conciliate love, and create
warm friendships.—The best character may
indeed for a time be accidentally obscured
and misunderstood. But the world com∣monly
judges soundly in the end. After
a man has acted his part for a while among
his fellows, he is known upon trial to be
what he is; and if his worth be real and
genuine, <HI>his righteousness comes forth as the
light, and his judgment as the noon day.</HI></P>
<P>This is what a good man has always
ground to look for, even in evil times;
and surely, there are few things which he
can more desire than the prospect of being
valued and esteemed by those among whom
he lives. This counterbalances many a
disadvantage of outward fortune, and puts
<PB N="22" REF="33"/>
into his hand many opportunities of satis∣faction
and comfort. He is likely to pos∣sess
many friends and well-wishers, and to
have few enemies. The more he is known,
the more will the favour of those who sur∣round
him grow; and the prospect is before
him of having his <HI>hoary head crowned with
honour.</HI></P>
<P>THUS, in several instances, I have briefly
pointed out what may, or may not, be ex∣pected
from the world, when we look for∣ward
to the ordinary course of human af∣fairs:
Not an uninterrupted enjoyment of
all the comforts of prosperity; not undis∣turbed
satisfaction in our various inter∣courses
with society; not grateful returns
from all whom we have obliged or served:
But what we may expect, if we keep a
good conscience and study to do our duty,
is peace of mind; a tolerably easy and
comfortable state, amidst the vicissitudes of
life; and the love and esteem of those with
whom we are connected.—<HI>The hope of the
righteous shall be gladness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="34"/>
THE present subject has led me to con∣sider
only what the righteous man has to
hope for in the ordinary course of the
world. But I have now to observe, that
he has before him a much high<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> object
of hope than any which I have yet men∣tioned;
a hope which arises not from
the ordinary course of human affairs, but
from an extraordinary interposition of
divine grace and mercy conveyed to us
by the gospel; even the <HI>hope which is
laid up for him in heaven;</HI> the assured ex∣pectation
of a better life, in a higher and
better world. Put the case of the servant
of God being overwhelmed with all the
disappointments which the world can bring
upon him, here is an <HI>expectation</HI> which will
be always <HI>gladness;</HI> with which he can
perpetually solace himself. Through the
present state of existence he is no more
than a passenger. If he can render it in
any degree tolerable and easy to himself,
it is well; it is all that he expects. His
home, his place of rest is in those habita∣tions
to which, through the merits of his
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
Redeemer, he is taught and encouraged to
aspire. He knows that <HI>in due season, he
shall reap if he faint not</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galat. vi. 9.</NOTE>. That when
the <HI>earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved,
he shall have a building of God, an house
not made with hands, eternal in the heavens;</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Corinth. v. 1.</NOTE>;
for <HI>to them who, by patient continuance in
well-doing, seek for glory, honour, and im∣mortality,
God will render eternal life</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 7.</NOTE>.
Hence, whether you consider him in this
life, or consider him as looking forward to
another, his hope is perpetual <HI>gladness,
while the expectations of the wicked shall
perish.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is nothing which all nature
more loudly proclaims,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. II.</NOTE> than that some
Supreme Being has framed and rules this
universe. <HI>Day uttereth speech of it to day,
and night sheweth knowledge of it to night.</HI>
Our birth and our life, our sensations and
our actions, the objects which we behold,
and the pleasures which we enjoy, all con∣spire
to testify that some wonderful intelli∣gence
has disposed and arranged, and still
<PB N="26" REF="37"/>
supports and animates the whole frame of
nature. This is what scarcely any man of
sober mind ever called in question. It
was the dictate of nature to the most sa∣vage
and barbarous, as well as to the most
civilized nations. The American and the
Indian in his desert, as well as the Grecian
sage and the Roman conqueror, adored,
each after his own mode, a Sovereign of the
Universe.—The Psalmist observes, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pf. xiv. 1.</NOTE> <HI>the
fool hath said in his heart there is no God.</HI>
Among the follies, however, with which
the human race is chargeable, this is one
which, in the course of ages, seemed to
have made the smallest progress. It was
reserved for modern times and evil days,
to engender, in one region of the earth, a
system of false philosophy which should
revive the exploded principles of atheism,
and study to pour forth their poison among
the nations, not only to the extinction of
religion, but to the subversion of established
governments, and of good order among
mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="38"/>
Dismissing all delusions of this nature
as unworthy the attention of any reasonable
unperverted mind; holding it for certain
that nothing can be more real than the
existence of a Supreme Divinity, it follows
of course from this belief, that there are
dispositions correspondent to Him which
ought to be found in every human mind,
among the young and the old, among the
high and the low, the rich and the poor.
It is absurd to suppose, that while the re∣lations
in which we stand to our fellow-creatures,
whether as equals, superiours, or
inferiours, naturally call forth certain sen∣timents
and affections, there should be none
which properly correspond to the first and
greatest of all Beings; to Him, whom,
though we see him not, we all recognise;
to Him, <HI>in whom,</HI> as it is beautifully ex∣pressed
in my text, <HI>we live, and move, and
have our being.</HI></P>
<P>THE proper disposition of mind with
respect to God, is generally expressed by
the term of Love to him. This is very justly
<PB N="28" REF="39"/>
founded on the solemn injunction of our
blessed Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxii. 37.</NOTE>. <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind; this is the first
and great commandment.</HI> Hence, it is com∣mon
among religious writers to include
the whole of pious affections towards God
in Love. But when this term is applied
to the Almighty, we must be careful to
understand aright what it imports. We
all know what it is to love any of our
fellow-creatures; but such an affection as
we bear to them, cannot in a literal sense
be transferred to God. Among them it
is sometimes connected with the fervency
of passion; it commonly imports some simi∣larity
of nature, and some degree of fond
and intimate attachment; all which it were
highly improper in us to affect towards
the Supreme Being, <HI>whose ways are not as
our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts.</HI>
I am afraid that the application of Love
in a strict sense, and sometimes in too ser∣vent
<PB N="29" REF="40"/>
and passionate a strain towards God,
has, among some serious and well disposed
minds, given rise to no little enthusiasm in
religion.</P>
<P>When therefore we treat of Love as
applied to God, it must be analysed or
resolved into those sentiments which are
proper and suitable for us to encourage
towards the God whom we adore. That love
of him which religion requires, and which
our Saviour has so solemnly enjoined, is a
compounded affection, and the dispositions
which it includes are principally three;
reverence, gratitude, submission. Of the
nature and foundation of each of these I
am to treat in the sequel of this discourse,
and shall endeavour to illustrate them as
forming that temper and disposition of
mind which we ought always to preserve
towards the Great Author of our existence.</P>
<P>I. THE foundation of every proper dispo∣sition
towards God must be laid in Reve∣rence,
that is, admiration mixed with awe;
what, in its lower degrees among men, is
<PB N="30" REF="41"/>
called Respect; but carried to its highest
point with relation to God, may be termed
profound veneration. In this disposition
towards Him we ought habitually to be
found, not only in the exercises of imme∣diate
devotion, but amidst the ordinary oc∣currences
of life. Every thing indeed that
we see around us gives perpetual occasion
for it. We find ourselves in an immense
universe, where it is impossible for us,
without astonishment and awe, to contem∣plate
the glory and the power of Him who
hath created it. From the greatest to the
least object that we behold, from the star
that glitters in the heavens to the insect
that creeps upon the ground, from the
thunder that rolls in the skies to the flower
that blossoms in the fields, all things testify
a profound and mysterious wisdom, a
mighty and all powerful hand, before
which we must tremble and adore. Nei∣ther
the causes nor the issues of the events
which we behold, is it in our power to
trace: neither how we came into this
world, nor whither we go when we retire
<PB N="31" REF="42"/>
from it, are we able of ourselves to tell;
but in the meantime find ourselves sur∣rounded
with astonishing magnificence on
every hand. We walk through the earth,
as through the apartments of a vast palace,
which fill every attentive spectator with
wonder. All the works which our power
can erect, all the ornaments which our
art can contrive, are feeble and trifling in
comparison with those glories which nature
every where presents to our view. The
immense arch of the heavens, the splendor
of the sun in his meridian brightness, or
the beauty of his rising and setting hours,
the rich landscape of the fields, and the
boundless expanse of the ocean, are scenes
which mock every rival attempt of human
skill or labour. Nor is it only in the splendid
appearances of nature, but amidst its rudest
forms, that we trace the hand of the Divi∣nity.
In the solitary desert, and the high
mountain, in the hanging precipice, the
roaring torrent, and the aged forest, though
there be nothing to cheer, there is much
to strike the mind with awe, to give rise to
<PB N="32" REF="43"/>
those solemn and sublime sensations which
elevate the heart to an Almighty, all
Creating Power.</P>
<P>In short, we can no where cast our eyes
around us without meeting what is suffi∣cient
to awaken reverence of the Deity.
This reverence becomes the more profound
that the great Being who is the object of
it, is to us invisible and unknown. We
may seek to discover him, but he hides him∣self
from us; his footsteps we clearly trace,
but his face we can never behold. <HI>We go
forward, but he is not there, and backward,
but we cannot perceive him; on the left hand
where he worketh, but we cannot behold him;
he hideth himself on the right hand that we
cannot see him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job, xxiii. 8, 9.</NOTE>. We know that <HI>he is not
far from every one of us;</HI> yet he shrouds
himself in the darkness of his pavilion; <HI>he
answereth from the secret place of thunder</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ps. lxxxi. 7.</NOTE>.
Before this incomprehensible Being, this
God terrible and strong, we become in a
manner annihilated; we are sensible that
<PB N="33" REF="44"/>
in his sight we are only as the <HI>drop of the
bucket</HI> and the <HI>small dust in the balance;</HI> and
in his presence can only <HI>rejoice with trem∣bling.</HI>
For we know that the mighty arm
which upholds the universe, and which
surrounds us with wonders on every side,
can in a moment crush us to the dust, if
we become objects of displeasure to heaven.
Awful are the operations of the Divine
Power which we are constantly beholding
in the moral as well as in the natural world.
The Almighty rules among the nations,
as well as over individuals: on his pleasure
depend all the great revolutions of the
earth; the interpositions of his Providence
are frequently apparent to the world, in
bringing down the mighty, and raising up
the fallen. In the books of the law and
the prophets, we hear his threatenings
against rebellious sinners denounced with
a tremendous voice; and in the dispensation
of the gospel, a most striking instance is
exhibited to us of the strict justice of his
government, in the expiation that was re∣quired
for the apostacy of a guilty world.
<PB N="34" REF="45"/>
So that both the law and the gospel, the
works of nature and the conduct of Provi∣dence,
unite in uttering that solemn voice
which ought often to resound in our ears: <HI>Be
still, and know that I am God. I will be
exalted among the heathen; I will be exalted
in the earth. Fear before him, all ye nations:
Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his
name. For honour and majesty are before
him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
He alone doth great things and unfearachable;
marvellous things without number</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. xlvi. 10. Ps. xcvi. 6—8. Job, v. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On this head of discourse I have insisted
the more, because I apprehend that such
sentiments as I have now been inculcating
occur too rarely among many professed
Christians. Did an awful reverence for the
Supreme Being dwell on all our minds
with a properly impressive sense, its effects
would oftener appear in conduct. On
many occasions it would check a wanton
levity of spirits. It would infuse more so∣lemnity
into our religious acts. It would
<PB N="35" REF="46"/>
inspire greater respect for the temples of
God, and for all the forms of sacred wor∣ship.
It would banish that profanation of
the name of God which we so often hear
from unhallowed lips.—Let it be remem∣bered
that the <HI>fear of God</HI> is, throughout
much of the scripture, employed as the
term descriptive of the whole of religion.
It is not the fear which slaves are con∣strained
to feel for a tyrant, but the reve∣rence
which children have for the best
parent, or subjects for the best sovereign;
the veneration which necessarily enters into
the love we bear to a Being of superiour
order: it is to <HI>fear the Lord and his good∣ness,</HI>
as it is emphatically expressed by one
of the prophets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hosea, iii. 5.</NOTE>. This fear of God,
therefore, is not only consistent with the
love of him, but forms a material part of
it. The pretended love of God disjoined
from reverence of him, would no longer
be genuine loye, but would rise into ar∣rogant
presumption. I proceed to observe,</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="47"/>
II. THAT gratitude forms an essential
part of that disposition which we ought to
bear towards God. This implies an af∣fectionate
sense of God upon the mind,
and enters directly into love, understood
in its most common acceptation. It were
a gross mistake to imagine that the reve∣rence
of which I have discoursed has any
tendency to check gratitude: on the con∣trary
it heightens it, by uniting the sense
of our benefactor's condescension with the
benefits which he conveys. The more
eminent the qualities of a benefactor are,
and the higher the rank is in which he
stands, our hearts are warmed the more by
the feeling of his goodness.</P>
<P>It is impossible to think of God at all, with∣out
conceiving him as the benefactor of man∣kind.
Mysterious as this world is in many,
of its appearances, it nevertheless carries,
on the whole, a strongly marked charac∣ter
of goodness and benignity in its author.
We behold a vast system obviously con∣trived
to provide, not food and nourish∣ment
only, but comfort also and enjoyment
<PB N="37" REF="48"/>
to an infinite number of inhabitants. The
more that philosophy has enlarged our
views of nature, the more it has been dis∣covered
that, throughout the wide extent
of creation, there is no useless profusion of
magnificence, but that every thing has been
rendered subservient to the welfare of the
rational or sensible world; nay, that many
objects, which were once considered as not
only superfluous but noxious, hold an use∣ful
place in the general system. Such pro∣vision
has been made for our entertainment
on this earth, such care has been taken to
store the world with a variety of pleasures
to cheer our senses and enliven our ima∣gination,
that he whose eye opens on all
the beauty of nature, must be of insensible
heart indeed if he feels no gratitude to that
Being who has brought him forth to enjoy
this wonderful scene.</P>
<P>But the gratitude of a good man will
naturally go farther than this. He will
think not only of the benefits which he
enjoys in common with the rest of his
fellow-creatures, but of those which are
<PB N="38" REF="49"/>
appropriated particularly to himself.—Who
is there amongst us, my brethren, but in
fairly reviewing the events of his life from
infancy to this day, in thinking of the com∣forts
he enjoys, and recollecting the dangers
from which he has been delivered; who
is there, I say, that has not cause to ac∣knowledge
an invisible guardian, who has
all along watched over his frail estate, has
protected and blessed him?—Perhaps of
the blessings which you enjoy, or the de∣liverances
you have received, you are more
disposed to trace some human cause; one
favourable distinction you ascribe to your
birth, your parents, or your education; for
some other happy circumstance you think
yourself solely indebted to the kindness of
an earthly friend, or you refer it to the
exertions of your own dexterity and ta∣lents.
—Thoughtless and inconsiderate man!
Have you forgotten that there is a first
Cause of all, a Supreme Lord, who, from
the beginning, has arranged and prepared
the whole series of causes and effects, of
whose destination and agency men are no
<PB N="39" REF="50"/>
more than the secondary instruments? To
what but to the original plan of his good∣ness,
do you owe the favourable circum∣stances
of your birth or your education,
the kindness which he ordained to spring
up in the breast of your friend, or the ta∣lents
and abilities which he implanted
within you, in order to favour your success?</P>
<P>But an exhortation to gratitude you per∣haps
consider as coming unseasonably in
your present situation. The time was,
when the light of the divine countenance
shone upon you, and looking up to a Bene∣factor
in heaven, with a grateful heart you
acknowledged your blessings to be derived
from Him; but that time is now past; you
are left desolate and forsaken, bereaved of
the chief comforts on which you had set
your hearts.—And, because many of the
favours of heaven are past, ought they to
be gone from your remembrance? Are
there not still some others remaining for
which you have reason to give thanks?
Have you forgotten all the blessings you
have continued to enjoy ever since the day
<PB N="40" REF="51"/>
that you came forth a helpless infant into
the world? Be assured that a gratitude of
that sort, which dies away as soon as it
ceases to be fed by the usual stream of be∣nefits,
which has regard to present favours
only, and none to those that are past, is not
true gratitude, but the symptom of a selfish
and mercenary spirit. If you be disposed
to thank God only when he is giving you
all the desires of your hearts, what praise
have ye? Do not publicans and sinners
the same? men who have little either
of religion or sensibility of heart. But
when Providence shrouds itself in a dark
cloud, and some of your favourite enjoy∣ments
are carried away, if still, with calm
and patient mind, you continue to bless
the name of the Lord, and still retain a
thankful sense of the blessings you have so
long, and so far beyond your deserts, been
permitted to enjoy; this is to be truly
grateful; this is to show yourselves the du∣tiful
children of a Father in Heaven.</P>
<P>In reviewing the grounds which we
have for gratitude to God, it becomes us
<PB N="41" REF="52"/>
to attend, not only to those blessings which
appertain individually to each of us, but to
those also which we enjoy in common with
others of our brethren. How much reason
have we, for instance, to bless God for
having cast our lot in a land where we
enjoy all the advantages of mild and equal
government, and all the comforts of tran∣quillity
and peace, while many a nation
around us is oppressed by the hand of
tyrannical power, disturbed with the alarms
and terrors of war, or suffering from the
ravages of the hostile spoiler? What higher
reason still to be grateful for having our
lot cast where the joyful sound of the gos∣pel
is heard, where the glad tidings <HI>of
peace upon earth and good will to the sons
of men</HI> are announced to us by the Son
of God, who came to bring pardon and
salvation to a guilty world? What ever∣lasting
ground of thankfulness is afforded
by the blessed hope that is given us of life
immortal; of <HI>a house not made with hands
eternal in the heavens, when the earthly
house of this tabernacle shall be dissolved;
<PB N="42" REF="53"/>
of an inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, and
that fadeth not away,</HI> ascertained to all good
men by the death and the resurrection of
our blessed Redeemer! <HI>Bless the Lord, O
my soul! and all that is within me, bless his
holy name, and forget not all his benefits;
who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who
healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy
life from destruction; who crowneth thee
with loving kindness and tender mercies</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. ci. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>.
Let us now add,</P>
<P>III. ENTIRE and profound submission
as a disposition most necessary to be pre∣served
on our part towards God. This in∣cludes
submission of the understanding to
the discoveries which God has been pleased
to make; submission of the inclinations to
the laws which he has promulgated for our
conduct; submission of the will to the dis∣pensations
of his Providence, as they affect
the events of our life. It is not submission
constrained merely by a power against
<PB N="43" REF="54"/>
which we know that it is in vain to
struggle; it is submission arising from re∣verence
compounded with gratitude; sub∣mission
to One whose supreme perfection
entitles Him to absolute obedience, whose
experienced goodness affords ground for
implicit trust.</P>
<P>In the present imperfect state of human
nature, there will be often found no small
reluctance to that entire resignation to God
which religion requires. The pride of
human understanding will sometimes revolt
against the discoveries which God has
made in his word, as deficient and unsatis∣factory;
the struggles of passion will fre∣quently
rise against the restraints imposed
on us by his laws, and the severities in∣flicted
by his Providence. But in the heart
of a pious man all such opposition is
checked and borne down, by a steady faith
that, under the administration of the Al∣mighty,
all is ordered for the best, though
for several steps of that high administration
we are unable at present to account.
Hence that calm tranquillity he preserves,
<PB N="44" REF="55"/>
and that resolute and magnanimous submis∣sion
he maintains, amidst the most unpro∣mising
circumstances. He knows that in
this stupendous universe there must be
many things that lie beyond our compre∣hension.
—As yet thou feest no more than
the rise of the divine government, the be∣ginnings
of a great plan which is not to be
completed until the course of ages shall
end. Meanwhile darkness must be allowed,
for wise reasons, to remain upon many
things; severe restraints must be imposed
on conduct, and occasional sufferings must
be endured. If thou sufferest, sigh, and be
silent: wait, and be patient. Presume not
to exalt thy weak reason against the reve∣lations
of heaven, nor to give vent to thy
impatient complaints against the ordinations
of thy Supreme Governour. Think with
awe, and speak with caution, of what is so
much above thee. Wait till thy being
shall be unfolded; till it shall have passed
through the necessary steps that shall gra∣dually
prepare thee for beholding the se∣crets
of the universe; for understanding
<PB N="45" REF="56"/>
the counsels of the God who made it. In
the mean time, be content to submit and
to adore. Let no other voice be heard
from thee but this; “Thou hast made me,
O God! and I am thine, for <HI>in thee I live,
and move, and have my being.</HI> Where∣ever
thou commandest me to go, I fol∣low.
Whatever thou appointest me to
suffer, I bear without murmur. It is my
part to persevere in my duty; all the
rest I leave to Thee; to Thee, whose
wisdom I revere, whose goodness I have
so often experienced; in whom therefore
I repose implicit trust that all shall end
well, and the righteous be made finally
happy.”—<HI>Good is the word which the
Lord hath spoken. Not my will, but His be
done. Behold h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re I am. Let him do to
his servant as seemeth good to him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings, xx. 19. Luke, xxii. 4. 2 Sam. xv. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such are the principal dispositions which
it becomes us to preserve towards God; to
preserve towards Him at all times; not in
the solemn hours of devotion only, but
<PB N="46" REF="57"/>
when we act in the busy world, or when
we walk in retirement amidst the scenes of
nature. If this union of reverence, gra∣titude,
and submission, habitually possess our
minds, they will of course shoot forth into
what is termed <HI>delighting ourselves in
God;</HI> thinking of him with peculiar com∣placency
and warmth of affection; and
elevating us sometimes into a sacred trans∣port
when we draw nigh to him in acts of
immediate worship, in prayer and praise.
Then is the season when the fulness of the
soul gives rise to those sublime and pathetic
effusions of piety which are recorded of
saints in former times: <HI>My soul thirsteth for
God; for the living God: when shall I
come and appear before him? I will lift up
my hands in thy name; my soul shall be satis∣fied
as with marrow and with fatness, when
I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate
on thee in the night watches. Blessed is the
man whom thou choosest, and causest to ap∣proach
unto thee. O that I knew where to
find him, that I might come even to his seat</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. xlii. 2. Ps. lxiii. 5, 6. Ps. lxv. 4. Job, xxiii. 3.</NOTE>!</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="58"/>
When such sentiments as these, of ardent
affection towards God, chastened by re∣verence
and submission, as well as warmed
by gratitude, predominate in our hearts,
and when they exert their proper influence
in purifying and regulating our life, we
may then be truly said to <HI>love the Lord
our God, with all our heart, and soul, and
strength, and mind.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ACTS, x. 30.</BIBL>
<Q>Jesus of Nazareth—who went about doing
good.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are two great aspects under
which we may contemplate the appear∣ance
of our Blessed Lord on the earth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. III.</NOTE> One
is, his coming into the world in order to
make expiation to divine justice, by his
sufferings and death for the guilt of the
human race. The other is, his coming to
act as the enlightener and reformer of the
world, by his doctrine and his life. The
first of those views is the most sublime; as
<PB N="49" REF="60"/>
on the atonement which he made for us,
depend all our hopes of the pardon of sin,
and of life eternal. In the other view, it
is also of high importance that all chris∣tians
should frequently consider him, in
order to the proper regulation of their
conduct; the observation of his example
is no less necessary for this purpose, than
attention to his doctrine; as by his doc∣trine
he taught us what we are bound to
do, so in his example he showed us what
we ought to be.</P>
<P>Hence the example of our Blessed Lord
has been ever held up by serious writers
to christians for their instruction and imi∣tation.
It obviously possesses many ad∣vantages
above any other standard of con∣duct.
It carries peculiar obligations from
gratitude, interest, and duty, to enforce the
imitation of it; and it is the only example,
in following which, we are certain never
to err. It has also another peculiar ad∣vantage
attending it, which is not so com∣monly
thought of; that is, the universality
of its use. It evidently appears that our
<PB N="50" REF="61"/>
Lord himself had this benefit to his fol∣lowers
in view from the train of living
which he chose to adopt. Had he pitched
upon any one station of life, the influence
of his example would have been much
more limited. The integrity, for instance,
of Samuel as a judge, the devotion of
David on the throne, the fortitude of Daniel
in the midst of a corrupt court, hold forth
indeed splendid instances of virtue, but
they hold them out only to a few:
whereas when Christ appeared on earth,
he confined himself to no one state of for∣tune
or line of life; he did not addict himself
to any particular calling; he did not even
fix his residence in one place, but he gives
us opportunity of viewing him in different
places and situations, in all that variety of
lights which indiscriminately regard the
bulk of mankind: his life was divided be∣tween
the contemplative and the active;
devotion and business equally shared it.
We behold him in private life among his
disciples, like a father in the midst of his
family. We behold him in public life,
<PB N="51" REF="62"/>
acting with authority in the discharge of
his high commission, assuming the dignity
which belonged to his office, and boldly
reproving the great and the powerful.
We see him sometimes in poverty and ob∣scurity,
contemned and persecuted. We
see him at other times elevated into public
favour, followed by applauding crowds,
and entering Jerusalem in triumph. We
can challenge all history sacred or profane,
to show us any eminent personage, saint,
philosopher, or hero, whose character was
so thoroughly tried, and so fully exhibited
to admiration, as that of our Saviour. What
adds greatly to the lustre of his example,
it was marked by no affected singularities
nor peculiar austerities. He did not seclude
himself from ordinary society, but con∣versed
among men with that sort of modest
piety and virtue which suits itself to the
level of human infirmity, and is conspi∣cuous
for the discharge of the plain and
substantial duties of a good life.</P>
<P>It is not my intention at present to at∣tempt
a full survey of all the graces and
<PB N="52" REF="63"/>
virtues which distinguished our Lord's life,
and ennobled his sufferings and death; as
this would lead into a field too extensive
for one discourse: I mean to confine my∣self
to the manner in which he fulfilled the
social duties, and exercised his benevolence
as a man among men. This will afford an
instructive view of what may be termed
the moral character of Christ in his ordi∣nary
intercourse with the world, and will
point out a proper model of our behaviour
towards one another. The most studied
and laboured encomiums never drew a
more amiable character than what is con∣tained
in the few and plain words of the
text; <HI>Jesus of Nazareth went about, doing
good.</HI> Let us consider in what manner He
fulfilled this character.</P>
<P>I. WE are to attend to his assiduity and
alacrity in seeking out and embracing every
opportunity of doing good: this is the
most substantial part of the great virtue of
charity. There is a sort of negative good∣ness
with which most men are ready to be
<PB N="53" REF="64"/>
satisfied; they appland themselves if they
have kept their hands free from unjust
deeds, and no man can reproach them for
working mischief to their neighbour; but
with respect to his welfare they are totally
indifferent. They remain in a sort of
torpid apathy about the concerns of others,
without either rejoicing in their prosperity,
or being affected with their distresses: this
is far below what is required of a good
man. We were all designed by our Creator
to be parts of one body, members of one
great society, where every one was to con∣tribute
his part towards the common be∣nefit,
and to be made happy by studying
to make others so. In proportion indeed
as our ability and influence extend, the
obligation to be extensively beneficial also
grows; but hardly is there any sphere so
narrow and circumscribed, as not to afford
some opportunities of being useful.—In
thy humble and obscure station, thou
art apt to think thyself entirely insig∣nificant
and lost to the world. To thee,
indeed, it may not belong to heal the dis∣eased,
<PB N="54" REF="65"/>
to raise the fallen, to supply the in∣digent,
or to bring forward the deserving.
But is there none whose spirit thou canst
cheer, or whose infirmities thou canst help
to lighten? Hast thou no parent, no child,
no brother, no friend, to whom thou canst
speak the words of comfort in the hour of
sorrow, whose mistakes thou canst rectify,
or whose erring steps thou canst turn into
the right path?</P>
<P>Here let the example of Christ, as far
as thy sphere admits it, be before, thine
eyes to quicken thine activity and ani∣mate
thy zeal. The whole history of his
life is the history of active and diffu∣sive
benignity. Wherever he was pre∣sent,
we find him employed in doing
good; either relieving men from their dis∣tresses,
or making them wise and happy
by his instructions. The whole country
around him seemed to be his family, and if
in a literal sense he had been the father of
them all, they could not have exercised his
care, or shared his bounty more. The hun∣gry
were fed, and the sick were cured, the
<PB N="55" REF="66"/>
blind saw, and the lame walked, wherever he
came. His miracles never were mere often∣tations
of power, but always expressions of
goodness. Often he prevented the suppli∣cations
of the distressed, and, unasked, con∣ferred
his favours; but never did any person
apply to him for aid and relief without
receiving it, whether he was Jew or Hea∣then,
friend or foe. What is especially re∣markable
in his benesicence is, that it was
continued and persevering in the midst of
ingratitude. This is one of the hardest trials
of virtue, not to be soured by the perversity
of men, and which persons even of generous
spirits find it the most difficult to bear. But
though Christ had to deal with a most un∣toward
and stubborn generation, whom no
evidence could convince, and no goodness
could mollify; though of all the great num∣bers,
who had been objects of his benefi∣cence,
we read of few who thankfully ac∣knowledged
his kindness, fewer who be∣came
his followers, and none who rose up
to assert his cause when borne down by
unjust persecution; yet, seeking to do good
<PB N="56" REF="67"/>
only for its own sake, he persevered to the
last in unwearied beneficence. He <HI>overcame
evil with good:</HI> it had been his principle,
and, it would appear, a noted saying of his,
which his disciples remembered and quoted
after his death; <HI>it is more blessed to give,
than to receive</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. WE ought to propose for imitation
that humanity of manners, that gentleness
and affability which appeared in the whole
of our Lord's behaviour. This relates to
the manner of conferring benefits, which
is often as material as the benefits them∣selves
are. These are sometimes conferred
so ungraciously, as to carry the air of insults
rather than benefits; whereas, when they
bear the marks of proceeding from real
kindness, their value is heightened, and
they are received with double pleasure.
There are numberless occasions, when the
discovery of a humane temper, and the lesser
offices of obliging and courteous behaviour,
<PB N="57" REF="68"/>
contribute essentially to the happiness of
others, and supply the place of greater be∣nefits,
which may not be in our power to
bestow.—For this amiable spirit our Lord
was remarkably distinguished. He was open
and affable to all, and easier of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than
his own disciples. On different <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> casion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
we find him checking his disciples, when
they restrained the forwardness of the mul∣titude
who pressed upon him, seeking relief.
Nay, he rebuked them for forbidding little
children to come to him, whom the fond∣ness
of the parents sought to introduce to
his presence. He took the children into his
arms and blessed them, and propounded
them to his disciples as emblems of that
innocence and simplicity which are requisite
for our entering into the kingdom of
heaven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark, x. 14.</NOTE>.—He conversed familiarly with
all sorts of people, and readily answered
the questions they put to him. He had
nothing of that haughty and distant reserve
which we so often see maintained by men
<PB N="58" REF="69"/>
of the world, and which prevents them
from holding intercourse with any whom
they consider as their inferiours in repu∣tation
or in rank. On the contrary, as our
Lord was ready to do good to all, so he
disdained not to receive kindness from
others; complying chearfully with the de∣sire
of those who invited him to their
houses, and accepting in good part the
prossered tokens of their well-intended re∣spect.
For such instances of courtesy he
was reproached by the Jews as one who
wanted that external severity of manners
which they imagined to belong to a pro∣sessed
reformer of the world. But He,
who knew what was in the heart of man,
saw that gentleness and condescension were
more effectual methods of gaining men
over to goodness, than harshness and auste∣rity;
and therefore did not decline all con∣versation
with men of doubtful or ble∣mished
lives, as long as there was any hope
of making them better. It was indeed
true that he was, as they reproached him,
<HI>a friend to publicans and sinners;</HI> for he was
<PB N="59" REF="70"/>
a friend to every one to whom he could
do good.—At the same time, it is of im∣portance
to remark, that this benignity of
our Lord's manners never betrayed him
into the opposite extreme, never degene∣rated
into that easiness of good nature,
which too often leads men to slide into the
manners and habits of those with whom
they converse, though they cannot ap∣prove
of them. Wherever the interests of
virtue were concerned, our Saviour was
inflexibly firm. He boldly lifted up his
voice, and testified against vice and cor∣ruption
wherever he beheld them. He
freely reproved the greatest men of the
nation for their hypocritical and assumed
shews of sancity; and the civility, with
which he was entertained in the house of
a Pharisee, did not prevent him from in∣veighing
severely against the vices of that
sect in their own presence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke; xi. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>III. WE are to consider our Lord in the
light of a faithful and affectionate friend,
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>
and his example as the pattern of all the
offices that belong to virtuous friendship.
The Apostles whom he chose for his inti∣mate
companions and friends, were men
of honest and candid minds, and of great
plainness and simplicity of character; men
who, from real esteem, and from conviction
of the truth of his mission, had become his
followers, and who, notwithstanding the
disadvantages of his fortune in the world,
continued to follow him to the last. At the
same time, together with those essential
principles of worth, they had also great
defects. They were most of them of timid
and fearful disposition, of slow understand∣ing,
backward to apprehend spiritual things,
and still prepossessed with the favourite
prejudice of their nation, that the promised
Messiah was to be a great conqueror, who
was to rescue their country from foreign
subjection, and raise it to empire and gran∣deur.
—Among these men our Lord passed
all the hours of his private life, acting
every part of an affectionate and faithful
friend, commending, advising, and reprov∣ing
<PB N="61" REF="72"/>
with great sincerity, and at the same
time with great tenderness. In his manner
of living he put himself perfectly on a level
with them. Some of them he honoured
with greater intimacy than others; but like
a prudent father in his family, he allowed
none of them to affect superiority over the
rest, and checked all that tended to rivalry
among them. He never flattered them in
their failings. He never soothed them with
vain hopes. He never concealed the disa∣greeable
consequences that would sollow
from adherence to his cause. Again and
again he inculcated what they were back∣ward
and unwilling to believe concerning
himself; and though the questions they put
often discovered a degree of gross ignorance,
he answered them all without passion or
impatience, training them up by degrees
to the events that were to happen after his
decease, and to the high part they were des∣tined
then to act in the world.</P>
<P>How happy would it be for mankind if
more attention were given to this noble pat∣tern
of fidelity and complacency which
<PB N="62" REF="73"/>
ought to prevail among friends, and of the in∣dulgence
due to the failings of those who are,
in their general character, worthy and esti∣mable
persons! This amiable indulgence he
carried so far, that in one of the most critical
seasons of his life, during his agony in the
garden, when he had left his disciples for
a short time, with a strict charge to watch
till he should return, but upon his return∣ing
found them asleep, all the reproof which
their negligence at so important a juncture
drew from him, was no more than this,
<HI>What, could ye not watch with me for one
hour</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxvi. 40.</NOTE>?—Of the tenderness of our Lord's
affections, and the constancy of his friend∣ship,
we have a very memorable instance,
in that mixture of friendship and silial
piety which he discovered during the
cruelty of his last sufferings. It is recorded
that when he hung upon the cross, behold∣ing
John his beloved disciple, and Mary
his mother, standing as spectators below,
he said to John, <HI>Behold thy mother;</HI> and
to Mary, <HI>Behold thy son;</HI> thus, committing
<PB N="63" REF="74"/>
his forlorn mother to the charge of his
friend John, as the most sacred and honour∣able
pledge he could leave him of their
antient friendship. The heart of his friend
melted; and from that hour, we are told,
<HI>he took her home with him to his own house.</HI>
It is John himself who has recorded to us
this honourable testimony of his master's
friendship<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, xix, 26, 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IV. THE example of Christ holds forth
for our imitation his steady command of
temper amidst the highest provocations,
and his ready forgiveness of injuries.
Though he had revenge always in his
power, he constantly declined it. On one
occasion when his disciples wished him to
call down fire from heaven to punish the
inhospitality of the Samaritans, <HI>he turned
and rebuked them, saying, ye know not what
manner of spirit ye are of; for the Son of
Man is not come to destroy men's lives, but
to save them</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke, ix. 55.</NOTE>. When he was <HI>reviled, he
<PB N="64" REF="75"/>
reviled not again; when he suffered, he
threatened not.</HI> The insults, which he often
received from a brutal multitude, had no
power to alter the meekness and generosity
of his disposition: he continued to beseech
and intreat them, when they sought to
chase him away from amongst them. When
they accused him of being in confederacy
with evil spirits, he answered their injurious
defamation only with mild and calm rea∣soning,
that if he by means <HI>of Satan did
cast out Satan, his kingdom must be divided
against itself, and could not stand.</HI> At his
trial before the High Priest, when he was
most injuriously treated, and contrary to all
law was, in face of the court, struck by one
of the High Priest's officers, what could
be spoken more meekly and reasonably
than his return to this usage, at a time
when all circumstances concurred to exas∣perate
the spirit of an innocent man; <HI>if I
have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil;
but if well, why smitest thou me</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, xviii. 27.</NOTE>?—When
<PB N="65" REF="76"/>
his enemies were completing the last scene
of their cruelty in putting him to death,
all their barbarous usage and scurrilous
taunts on that occasion, provoked not one
revengeful thought in his breast, nor drew
from his lips one misbecoming expression;
but, on the contrary, the last accents of his
expiring breath went forth in that affec∣tionate
prayer for their forgiveness; <HI>Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they
do!</HI>—Shall we, my friends, who have before
our eyes such an example of generous
magnanimity, of continued self-command
amidst the most trying situations, not be
ashamed of giving vent to passion on every
trifling provocation, and siercely demand∣ing
reparation for the smallest injury; we,
who, from the remembrance of our own
failings, have so many motives for mutual
forbearance and forgiveness; while He,
on the other hand, had done no wrong,
had never given offence to any, but had
the justest title to expect friendship from
every human being?</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="77"/>
V. LET us attend to the sympathy and
compassion which our Lord discovered for
the sufferings of mankind. It was not with
a cold unfeeling disposition that he per∣formed
the office of relieving the distressed.
His manner of bestowing relief clearly
showed with what sensibility he entered
into the sorrows of others. How affecting,
for instance, is the account of his restoring
to life the son of the widow of Nain, as it
is related in the beautiful simplicity of the
evangelical historian? <HI>When be came nigh
to the gate of the city, behold there was a
dead man carried out, the only son of his
mother; and she was a widow; and much
people of the city was with her.</HI> All the
circumstances in this incident are moving
and affecting; and it presently appeared
with what tender sensibility our Lord was
touched at the fight of so mournful a pro∣cession.
<HI>And when the Lord saw her, he
had compassion on her, and said unto her,
Weep not; and he came and touched the
bier, (and they that bare him stood still,)
and he said, Young man, I say unto thee,
<PB N="67" REF="78"/>
arise. And he that was dead, sat up and
began to speak; and he delivered him to his
mother</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke, vii. 12—16.</NOTE>. The whole scene of raising La∣zarus
from the grave, places our Saviour's
sympathy in the strongest light. As soon
as he came among the mourning friends,
although he knew the cause of their
mourning was speedily to be removed,
he could not forbear partaking of their
sorrow; <HI>He groaned, and was troubled in
spirit;</HI> and when surrounded by a crowd
in tears, he approached to the grave of his
deceased friend, it is expressly recorded, to
the eternal honour of his feelings, <HI>Jesus
wept; and the Jews said, Behold how he
loved him</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John, xi. 35.</NOTE>!—In like manner, when, for
the last time, he was about to enter into
Jerusalem, though the certain knowledge
of all the cruelties which were prepared
for him there, would have filled the breast
of any ordinary person with indignation
and hatred, instead of such emotions, the
<PB N="68" REF="79"/>
foresight of the direful calamities which
hung over that devoted city melted his
heart; and when he drew near to it and
beheld it, <HI>he wept;</HI> pouring forth that pa∣thetic
lamentation; <HI>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
thou that killest the Prophets and stonest
them that are sent unto thee, how often would
I have gathered thy children together, as a
hen doth gather her brood under her wings,
and ye would not! If thou hadst known,
at least in this thy day, the things which
belong unto thy peace, but now they are
bid from thine eyes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiii. 31. Luke, xix. 42.</NOTE>!. Thus, as a man, he
indulged all the amiable feelings of
our nature, teaching us that it is our duty
to regulate our passions, not to extirpate
them.</P>
<P>SUCH was Jesus of Nazareth, the founder
of our religion. A part only of his cha∣racter
I have now attempted to delineate:
many other of his eminent graces and vir∣tues
<PB N="69" REF="80"/>
have been left in the shade. But in
what we have now contemplated of his
behaviour as a man among men, we behold
a perfect model of the conduct we ought
to hold in the ordinary intercourse of so∣ciety
with one another. We have seen
him attentive to every opportunity of being
beneficent and useful; in his behaviour to
all men, assable and obliging; to his friends,
faithful and indulgent; to his enemies,
generous and forgiving; to the distressed,
full of tenderness and compassion. I might
also have dwelt upon the peaceable spirit he
displayed on all occasions; his respect, as
a subject, to the civil laws and government
of his country; discouraging a factious and
mutinous spirit; paying tribute when de∣manded;
exhorting his followers to render
unto Cesar the things which are Cesar's,
as unto God those which are God's.
Enough has been said to show what a
blessing it would prove to the world, if
this illustrious example were generally fol∣lowed.
Men would then become happy
<PB N="70" REF="81"/>
in all their connexions with one another.
This world would be a blessed dwelling;
and the society of human beings on earth,
would approach to the joy and peace of the
societies of the just in heaven.</P>

<Q>The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;
but a wounded spirit who can bear?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are two classes of goods and
evils belonging to man;<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IV.</NOTE> those which
respect his corporeal, and those which re∣spect
his spiritual state. Whatever is of an
external nature, is sufficiently the object of
attention to all men. In the health and vi∣gour
of the body, and in the flourishing
state of worldly fortune, all rejoice; and
whatever diminishes the one or the other,
is immediately felt and lamented. These
<PB N="72" REF="83"/>
are visible and striking objects, on which
our senses and imagination are accustomed
to dwell. But to procure an equal atten∣tion
to what is inward and spiritual, is much
more difficult. It is not easy to convince
men that the soul hath interests of its own,
quite distinct from those of the body, and
is liable to diseases and wounds as real as
any which the body suffers, and often much
more grievous. What passes within the
hearts of men, is always invisible to the
public eye. If it be of the pleasing and
satisfactory kind, they have no occasion to
disclose it; and if it be of a painful nature,
it is often their intent to conceal it. In the
mean time, <HI>the heart knoweth its own bit∣terness:</HI>
and from its being secreted from
public observation and concentrated within
the breast, it is felt the more deeply.—<HI>The
spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;</HI>
the natural vigour and courage of his mind
may enable him to surmount the ordinary
distresses of life; to bear with patience
poverty, sickness, or pain, as long as he is
conscious that all is right and found within.
<PB N="73" REF="84"/>
But if within him, the disease rankles in
his mind and his heart; if that which
should sustain him serves only to gall and
torment him; to what quarter can he then
look for relief, or to what medicine apply,
when that which should have cured his other
wounds is itself diseased and wounded?
<HI>A wounded spirit who can bear?</HI></P>
<P>THE spirit or soul of man is wounded
chiefly by three causes; by Folly, by
Passion, by Guilt.</P>
<P>I. IT is wounded by Folly; that is, by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain, light, and improper pursuits; by a
conduct, which though it should not be
immediately criminal, yet is unsuitable to
one's age, character, or condition in the
world. Good sense is no less requisite in
our religious and moral behaviour, than it
is in our worldly affairs. Whoever de∣parts
far from the plain track of sober and
reasonable conduct, shall, sooner or later,
undergo the consequences of a diseased and
wounded spirit.—It often happens, that
under the notion of innocent pleasure and
amusement, of only following their hu∣mour
<PB N="74" REF="85"/>
and indulging their taste, while, as
they say, they hurt no man, and violate no
material duty, many go on, for a time, in
a course of the most egregious follies, and
all along conceive themselves to be, if not
very virtuous, at least very inoffensive men.
The case is the same with the diseases of
the mind, as with the diseases of the
body. They lurk for a time unperceived.
The seeds of them may be working
within, while the person affected imagines
himself to be in perfect health: but at
length a crisis comes, which brings the
secret venom forth, and makes all its ma∣lignity
be felt.</P>
<P>In this age of dissipation and luxury in
which we live, how many avenues are con∣stantly
open that lead to the Temple of
Folly? To how many temptations are all,
but especially the young and the gay, ex∣posed,
to squander their whole time amidst
the circles of levity, and haunts of pleasure?
By idleness and extravagance, and the vain
ambition of emulating others in the splendid
show of life, multitudes run into expence
beyond their fortune. The time which
<PB N="75" REF="86"/>
should be employed in training them for
future significance in the world, they lose
in frivolous amusements and pursuits; or,
in the midst of these, bury the fruits of any
good education they had already received.
Idle associates are ever at hand to aid them
in inventing new plans of destroying the
time. If that fatal engine of mischief, the
gaming table, then attracts and ensnares
them, their career of folly will soon be com∣pleted;
the gulph of destruction opens,
and ruin is at hand.</P>
<P>Supposing some incident to befal, as
befal at some time it must, which shall
awaken persons of this description from their
dreams of vanity; which shall open their
eyes to the time that they have mispent,
and the follies which they have committed;
then, alas! what mortifying and disquieting
views of themselves will arise? How many
galling remembrances will crowd upon
their minds? They see their youth thrown
away in dishonourable or trivial pursuits;
those valuable opportunities which they
once enjoyed, of coming forward with dis∣tinction
<PB N="76" REF="87"/>
in the world, now irretrievably lost;
their characters tarnished and sunk in the
public eye; and the fortune, perhaps,
which they had inherited from their an∣cestors,
wasted among idle companions.
They behold around them the countenances
of their friends, angry and displeased. To
the grave and the respectable, they dare
not look up. They, with whom they once
started in the race of life as their equals,
have now got far before them; they are
obliged to respect them as their superiours,
and with shame to view themselves left be∣hind,
disgraced and dishonoured.—Can any
situation be more humbling and mortifying
than this? Is not this to suffer in a high
degree the misery of a wounded spirit,
when a man sees that by mere thoughtless∣ness
and folly, he has exposed and degraded
himself; beholds his character, his health,
his interest, sinking in the world; and is
sensible that with his own hands, and by
his own blind and ill-judged conduct, he
has brought this ruin on himself?—Con∣science
now begins to exert its authority,
<PB N="77" REF="88"/>
and lift its scourge. At every stroke it in∣flicts,
the wounds of the heart open and
bleed: and though it exercise not the same
dread severity as when it upbraids us with
notorious crimes, yet still it is the voice
of God within, rebuking and punishing
reasonable creatures for folly as well as
for guilt; nor indeed are follies of such a
kind as have been described, ever free from
many stains of guilt.</P>
<P>II. IF by Folly the spirit is thus liable to
be wounded, it is exposed by Passion to
wounds still more severe. Passions are those
strong emotions of the mind which impel
it to desire, and to act, with vehemence.
When directed towards proper objects, and
kept within just bounds, they possess an
useful place in our frame; they add vigour
and energy to the mind, and enable it, on
great occasions, to act with uncommon
force and success; but they always require
the government and restraint of reason.
It is in the mind, just as it is in the body.
<PB N="78" REF="89"/>
Every member of the body is useful, and
serves some good purpose. But if any one
swell to an enormous size, it presently be∣comes
a disease. Thus, when a man's pas∣sions
go on in a calm and moderate train,
and no object has taken an inordinate
hold of any of them, his spirit is in this part
sound, and his life proceeds with tranquil∣lity.
But if any of them have been so far
indulged, and left without restraint, as to
run into excess, a dangerous blow will then
be given to the heart.—Supposing, for in∣stance,
that some passion, even of the nature
of those which are reckoned innocent, shall
so far seize a man as to conquer and over∣power
him, his tranquillity will be de∣stroyed.
The balance of his soul is lost;
he is no longer his own master, nor is
capable of attending properly to the offices
of life which are incumbent on him, or of
turning his thoughts into any other direc∣tion
than what passion points out. He may
be sensible of the wound. He feels the dart
that is fixed in his breast, but is unable to
extract it.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="90"/>
But the case becomes infinitely worse,
if the passion which has seized a man be
of the vicious and malignant kind. Let him
be placed in the most prosperous situation of
life; give him external ease and affluence to
the full; and let his character be high, and
applauded by the world: yet, if into the
heart of this man there has stolen some
dark jealous suspicion, some rankling envy,
some pining discontent, that instant his
temper is soured, and poison is scattered
over all his joys. He dwells in secret upon
his vexations and cares, and while the
crowd admires his prosperity, he envies
the more peaceful condition of the peasant
and the hind. If his passions chance to be
of the more fierce and outrageous nature,
the painful feelings they produce will be
still more intense and acute. By violent
passions the heart is not only wounded, but
torn and rent. As long as a man is under
the workings of raging ambition, disap∣pointed
pride, and keen thirst for revenge,
he remains under immediate torment. Over
his dark and scowling mind, gloomy ideas
<PB N="80" REF="91"/>
continually brood. His transient sits of
merriment and joy, are like beams of light
breaking, occasionally, from the black cloud
that carries the thunder.—What greatly
aggravates the misery of such persons is,
that they dare make no complaints. When
the body is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to our
friends we naturally fly; and from their
sympathy or assistance expect relief. But
the wounds given to the heart by ill-go∣verned
passions, are of an opprobrious na∣ture,
and must be stifled in secret. The slave
of passion can unbosom himself to no friend;
and, instead of sympathy, dreads meeting
with ridicule or contempt,—How intoler∣ably
wretched must the condition of Haman
have been, when, before all his assembled
friends, he was reduced to make this
humbling confession of his state; that, in
the height of royal favour, and in the
midst of the utmost magnificence and grandeur,
“all availed him nothing, so long as
he saw his rival, Mordecai the Jew, sit∣ting
at the King's gate!”</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="92"/>
III. THE wounds which the heart re∣ceives
from guilt, are productive of still
greater pain and misery, than any which
have been already mentioned. If beyond
being misled by folly, or overcome by pas∣sion,
a man be conscious to himself of hav∣ing
deliberately committed deeds of in∣justice
or cruelty; of having, perhaps, by
wicked arts, seduced the innocent and un∣wary,
to fall the miserable victims of his li∣centious
pleasures; of having ruined, by his
dishonesty, the unsuspicious trusting friend;
of having amassed wealth to himself, by
fraud and oppression, from the spoils of
the industrious: in such and similar cases,
deep and lasting is the sting which is sent
into the heart.</P>
<P>I am aware of the arts which have been
devised by criminal men to shelter them∣selves
from the attacks of conscience; of
the sceptical principles to which they have
recourse; and of the self-deceiving opinions
with which they flatter themselves concern∣ing
their own character, concerning the
goodness of God, and the allowances which
<PB N="82" REF="93"/>
they hope will be made for human in∣firmity
and strong temptations. But all
those palliatives of guilt are no other to
the soul, than the empirick medicines that
are applied to the diseases of the body;
which disguise the disease, without removing
it; which procure a little temporary ease,
and conceal from the patient the danger
of his state; but drive the distemper to the
vitals, and make it break forth in the end
with redoubled force. Thus may those
dangerous opiates of conscience soothe a
man for a while, in the days of his pros∣perity.
Amidst the bustle of active life,
and as long as the fluster of gay and youth∣ful
spirits lasts, he may go on in the com∣mission
of many crimes with smoothness
and seeming peace. But let the sober and
serious hour come, which, sooner or later,
must come to all; let the amusements of
life be withdrawn, and the man be left
alone to his own reflections; the power of
truth will soon prove too strong for all that
is opposed to it, and pierce into his heart.
—The voice of nature, of conscience,
<PB N="83" REF="94"/>
and of God, will make itself be heard
within him. He will feel that he is a
wretch. He will become despicable in his
own sight. He will become sensible that
all good men have reason to hate him, and
that the just governor of the world has
reason to punish him. Conscience, bring∣ing
to remembrance all his secret crimes,
will held them up to his view with this
fearful inscription written upon them, <HI>God
will bring every work into judgment.</HI>—
Hence the haggard look, and the restless
couch, days never free from bitterness, and
nights given up to remorse.</P>
<P>This remorse will prey the deeper on
the bad man's heart, if it shall happen, as
it sometimes does, that there was a period
in his life when he was a different man;
when, having been educated by virtuous
parents in sober and religious principles,
and being as yet uncorrupted by the world,
he passed his days without reproach or
blame. The recollection of what he then
felt, compared with the state into which
he has now brought himself by forfeited
<PB N="84" REF="95"/>
integrity and honour, will wring his heart
with sad remembrance. “Once I knew
what it was to enjoy all the comforts of
innocence, and to take pleasure in the
thoughts of heaven, when my hands
were unstained and my mind was pure.
Then I was ever cheerful, easy, and free.
Heaven and earth seemed to smile upon
me. My nights were peaceful, and my
days were pleasant. Innocent joys and
comfortable hopes were ever at hand to
entertain my solitary hours.—Where now
are these gone? Why am I thus so al∣tered
and changed from what I was, and
so uneasy to myself? What, alas! have I
gained by those worldly pursuits and am∣bitious
plans which seduced me from
the plain and safe paths of integrity and
virtue!”</P>
<P>SUCH are the wounds of the spirit, occa∣sioned
either by folly, by passion, or by guilt,
and too often by a complication of all the
three together. For though they be of sepa∣rate
consideration, and each of them may be
<PB N="85" REF="96"/>
felt in a different degree, yet they are seldom
parted wholly asunder from one another.
Folly gives rise to unrestrained and dis∣orderly
passions. These betray men into
atrocious crimes; and the wretched sinner
is stung as by a three-headed snake; at
once, reproached by reason for his folly,
agitated by some strong passion, and tor∣tured
with a conscious sense of guilt.—
When these disorders of the mind arise to
their height, they are, of all miseries, the most
dreadful. The vulgar misfortunes of life,
poverty, sickness, or the loss of friends, in
comparison with them, are trivial evils.
Under such misfortunes, a man of tolerable
spirit, or of a moderate share of virtue, will
be able to find some consolation. But
under the other, he can find none. What
is but too decisive as to the degree in which
they surpass all external evils, they are
those wounds of the spirit, the shame of
folly, the violence of passion, and the re∣morse
for guilt, which have so frequently
produced that fatal crime, so much the re∣proach
of our age and our country; which
<PB N="86" REF="97"/>
have driven men to the most abhorred of
all evils, to death by their own hand, in
order to seek relief from a life too embit∣tered
to be endured.—Far from each of
us be such desperate calamities!—But, if
it be the certain tendency of those
wounds of the heart, to introduce the
greatest disquietude and misery into the
life of man, then, from what has been said,
let us be taught,</P>
<P>IN the first place, to give the most
serious and vigilant attention to the go∣vernment
of our hearts. It may be
thought by some, that the formidable re∣presentation
I have given of the miserable
effects of a wounded spirit, attaches only
to them who have gone to the utmost
lengths in folly or passion; but that, by
some more temperate regulation of con∣duct,
indulgence may be given, without
harm, to the free gratification of certain
favourite desires.—Be assured, my brethren,
that, under ideas of this kind, there lies
much self-deception. Supposing it in your
<PB N="87" REF="98"/>
power to stop at some given point without
rushing into the greatest disorders, still you
would suffer from the licence you had taken
to drop the government of your hearts.
The lesser criminal never escapes without
his share of punishment. In proportion
to the quantity you have drunk out of the
poisoned cup of pleasure, you will feel
your inward health and foundness im∣paired;
or, to follow the metaphor of the
text, not by a deep wound only, but
by every slighter hurt given to the heart,
you will suffer in that peace and tranquil∣lity
which makes the comfort of life.</P>
<P>But besides this consideration, strict at∣tention
is the more requisite to the govern∣ment
of the heart, as the first introduction
to those disorders which spread their conse∣quences
so deep and wide, is for the most part
gradual and insensible, and made by latent
steps. Did all the evil clearly show itself
at the beginning, the danger would be less.
But we are imperceptibly betrayed, and
from one incautious attachment drawn on
to another, till the government of our hearts
<PB N="88" REF="99"/>
be at last utterly lost; and wounds in∣flicted
there, which are not to be healed
without much shame, penitence, and re∣morse.—How much does this call for the
attention of youth in particular, whose
raw and unexperienced minds are so apt
to be caught by every new and enticing
object that is held forth to their passions?
How much does it concern them to be∣ware
of the commencements of evil, and
to listen to the admonitions of the grave
and the wise, who have gone through
those dangerous paths on which they are
beginning to enter? Let them never give
up their hearts profusely to any attachment,
without the countenance of reason and
religion. Let them shut their ears to the
seductions of folly and vice, and look with
wary eye to those rocks on which so many
others have split.—Nor is it only to youth
that this admonition belongs. To the
levities and passions of youth succeed the
more sober follies of advancing years;
which, under a graver appearance, are no
less liable to seize and wound the heart.
<PB N="89" REF="100"/>
From the first to the last of man's abode
on earth, the disciplin is perpetually re∣quisite
of <HI>keeping the heart with all dili∣gence;</HI>
guarding it from whatever would
annoy its healthy and sound estate; <HI>as
out of the heart are the issues either of Life
or Death.</HI></P>
<P>IN the second place, it clearly appears,
from what has been said, how much reason
we all have to join prayer to Almighty
God, in addition to our own endeavours
of guarding and governing our spirits;
beseeching Him who made the heart, and
who knows all its errors and wanderings,
to aid and prosper us by his grace in this
difficult undertaking. Well must he who
knows any thing of himself at all, know
how greatly divine assistance is needed
here, and how little we can depend upon
ourselves without it. For <HI>deceitful,</HI> as well
as <HI>desperately wicked,</HI> are our hearts; and
after all our pretences to ability and wis∣dom,
how often, by the seductions of folly
and of passion, have the wise, the learned,
<PB N="90" REF="101"/>
and the admired, been shamefully carried
away?—Most earnestly to be desired is
that blessing promised in the Gospel, of a
new heart and a new spirit, which shall
render us superiour to the attacks of vanity
and vice. <HI>Who can understand his errors?
Cleanse me, O God, from secret faults: Create
in me a clean heart, and renew a right
spirit within me. That which I see not,
teach thou me; and lead me in thy way
everlasting.</HI></P>
<P>IN the last place, all that has been said
on the subject tends to impress us with a
sense of this awful truth, that the Great
God hath already begun to punish bad
men for their sins and vices. You see his
hand clearly marked in all that they are
made to suffer by the Wounded Spirit.
You see that he has not delayed all retri∣bution
to another world; but hath in this
world begun to act as a Governour and a
Judge; showing, by an established order
of things, that while he loves the righteous,
he <HI>hateth all the workers of iniquity.</HI> With
<PB N="91" REF="102"/>
a wisdom peculiar to himself, he hath made
the punishments due to sinners to arise di∣rectly
from their own behaviour, and to be
inflicted by their own hands. He hath no
occasion to send forth destroying angels
against them; the thunder which is ever
in his hands, needs not be pointed at the
heads of the guilty. He need only leave
them to themselves; and presently their
<HI>wickedness begins to reprove them, and their
backslidings to correct them,</HI> till they fully see
and feel what an <HI>evil thing and bitter it
was, to depart from the Lord their God.</HI>
Conscious, while their hearts are bleeding
within them, that they are only <HI>reaping
the fruit of their own doings,</HI> the sense of
deserving what they suffer, both aggravates
the suffering, and forces them to acknow∣ledge
the justice of it.</P>
<P>When we behold such plain marks of
wise and just government taking place
among men, who shall take upon him to
say that all things come alike to all men,
and that there is no more than a promis∣cuous
distribution of good and evil by Pro∣vidence
<PB N="92" REF="103"/>
on earth? However it may seem
in appearance, it is far from being so in
reality. We look to the outside of things.
We are dazzled with that tinsel glare which
prosperity sometimes throws around the
worthless and the wicked. But what is
that to true happiness and self-enjoyment?
often, how little connected with it? Could
you look into the hearts of men, another
scene would open. You would see many
a heart wounded and bleeding in secret,
from a guilty conscience and remembered
crimes, while gay looks were affectedly put
on before <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he world. Comparing this
galled and distressed state of mind, with
the free and easy, the light and disencum∣bered
spirit of a worthy and virtuous man,
even under the pressures of life, you would
forbear to charge Providence, and would
readily acknowledge, that though the exter∣nal
distribution of the world's goods be pro∣miscuous,
the internal allotment of happiness
is measured by the real characters of men.
—On the whole, let us hold fast by this
great truth, and by it govern our lives,
<PB N="93" REF="104"/>
that every man's real happiness or misery
is made, by the appointment of the Creator,
to depend more on himself, and on the
proper government of his mind and heart,
than upon any external thing, or than
upon all external things put together; that
for those who serve God, and study to keep
their conscience clear from guilt, God hath
provided peace and comfort on earth, as
well as rewards hereafter; but, <HI>saith my
God, there is no peace to the wicked.</HI></P>

<Q>We know that all Things work together for

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG many antient philosophers it
was a favourite tenet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. V.</NOTE> that all seeming
disorders in the world are rendered sub∣servient
to the order and perfection of the
universe; or, that all things work to∣gether
for the good of the whole: But to
this good of the whole, they conceived the
interest of individuals to be oft-times
<PB N="95" REF="106"/>
obliged to yield. The revelation of the
Gospel has opened to us a higher and more
comfortable prospect. For it assures us not
only of the direct tendency of all things to
general order, but to the consummate hap∣piness
of every individual who loves and
serves God. While the Deity is ever car∣rying
on the general system of things to its
proper perfection, the interest of no one
good man is sacrificed in any point to pro∣mote
this end▪ but his life is, at the same
time, a system complete within itself, where
all things are made to conspire for bringing
about his felicity. <HI>We know,</HI> says the
Apostle in my text, that is, we are assured,
not by doubtful reasonings with regard to
which the wisest might be perplexed, but
by a divine promise on which the simple
can firmly rely, that <HI>all things work together
for good to them that love God, to them who
are the called according to his purpose.</HI>—This
is that capital encouragement of re∣ligion,
which virtually contains in itself all
the other promises made in Scripture to
the righteous, and, like a full and exuberant
<PB N="96" REF="107"/>
fountain, divides itself into a thousand
streams to refresh the life of man with con∣solation
and joy. It will therefore deserve
our very full and particular consideration,
both as to the extent of encouragement
given, and the evidence on which our as∣surance
of it rests.</P>
<P>THE first thing which should here draw
our attention is, the character of those to
whom the encouragement of the text is
appropriated. For it is evidently not given
indiseriminately to all, but limited to such
as <HI>love God,</HI> and <HI>are the called according to
his purpose;</HI> that is, chosen by him to eternal
life. But left the latter part of this de∣scription
should appear too secret and mys∣terious
to afford the encouragement in∣tended,
it is cleared up by the first and ex∣planatory
character, <HI>them that love God.</HI>
Here is something plain and satisfactory on
which we can rest. We need not say, Who
shall ascend into heaven in order to bring us
down from thence any information, whe∣ther
our names be written in the book of
<PB N="97" REF="108"/>

and the state of our heart. <HI>The word is

<HI>love God,</HI> and they who are <HI>the called ac∣cording
to his purpose,</HI> are the same. Di∣vine
love is the sacred character which
marks those who are <HI>sealed unto the day
of redemption.</HI>—This love of God is not to
be understood as signifying merely some
occasional ardour of affection: it imports
that steady principle of goodness which
becomes the spring of a pure and virtuous
life. The same character is here meant,
which is described in other passages of
scripture, by <HI>fearing and serving God.</HI> They
who truly love God, are they who love and
imitate the divine perfections; they who
love and obey the divine laws; they who
love and pursue the divine approbation,
as the great aim of their life.—Keeping
this important article ever in view as a
necessary limitation of the gracious decla∣ration
<PB N="98" REF="109"/>
in the text, let us proceed to exa∣mine
the full extent of that encourage∣ment
which it affords.</P>
<P>WE begin with considering what the
<HI>good</HI> is, for which it is here said that all
things work in favour of the righteous.
It is a term susceptible of very different
acceptations. For many things appear good
to some, which do not appear so to others;
nay, the same things which have appeared
to ourselves good at one time, have been
far from appearing good at another. As∣suredly
that <HI>good</HI> which God promises as
the reward of his servants, must be some∣what
worthy of God to bestow; some∣what
that depends not on the fluctuation
of fancy and opinion, and that is not liable
to change with the change of times. It
must be some good of a fixed and perma∣nent
nature, which will be felt as such in
every situation and period of our existence.
But it is evident that such characters are
not applicable to the external advantages
of the world, riches, same, and honours.
<PB N="99" REF="110"/>
These may occasionally be desirable, and at
some times confer satisfaction on the pos∣sessor.
But besides their uncertain and tran∣sient
duration, they are far from conferring
satisfaction at all times, even when they last.
On the contrary, it is a certain fact, and ma∣nifest
to general observation, that a man may
possess all the external advantages of fortune,
and lead withal a very miserable life. Sup∣pose
him to be disquieted in his own mind
by envy, jealousy, revenge, or other violent
passions, and harassed with a guilty con∣science,
such a man cannot be said to have
attained what is <HI>good.</HI> Would it have been
worthy of the Supreme Being to have
flattered his servants with the hope only
of a good so fallacious, that in certain cir∣cumstances
it might be consistent with the
greatest misery?—No: that good, for the
sake of which he makes all things work to
those that love him, must be founded in
the improvement and perfection of their na∣ture
in wisdom, grace, and virtue; in their
good considered as rational and immortal
beings; productive of a felicity which is
within them, and shall abide with them
<PB N="100" REF="111"/>
for ever. While we look only to a pre∣sent
momentary satisfaction, the Divine
Being, in consulting our welfare, provides
for the whole of our existence in time and
eternity; connects the present with the
future; and by his beneficent decree, ordains
for each of his servants, that which, upon
the whole, is <HI>the best.</HI>—While <HI>to the sinner
he giveth sore travel, to gather and to heap
up; he giveth to a man that is good in his
sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. ii. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING ascertained the sense in which
we are to understand <HI>the good</HI> for which God
maketh all things to work, we proceed to
consider what is included in the extent of
the expression, of <HI>all things working for this
good.</HI> In general, it includes all that hap∣pens
to good men in this world; every
station and condition in which they are
placed; every circumstance in their lot,
from the beginning to the end of their
lives. Nothing besals them fortuitously,
nothing happens in vain or without a
<PB N="101" REF="112"/>
meaning; but every event possesses its
proper and destined place, and forms a link
in that great chain of causes which is ap∣pointed
to carry on their improvement
and felicity. As all the rivers upon the
face of the globe, however circuitous they
may be in their progress, and however
opposite in their course, yet meet at last in
the ocean, and there contribute to increase
the mass of waters; so all the seemingly
discordant events in the life of a good man
are made to preserve, upon the whole, an
unerring tendency to his good, and to
concur and conspire for promoting it at the
last. What a noble and sublime view does
this present of the supreme dominion of
Providence, and of its care exercised over
every righteous man!</P>
<P>When we descend to a more particular
examination of what is included in the ex∣pression
here used, of <HI>all things,</HI> we may
observe, first, that it includes a state of
worldly prosperity. For sometimes this is
appointed to fall to the share of God's ser∣vants;
nay, their worth and virtue have
<PB N="102" REF="113"/>
often been the means of bringing it about.
But it is not one of those things which
are good in their own nature, till God
makes it work for that purpose. What
numbers of men has it poisoned and de∣stroyed,
cherishing the growth of wanton∣ness
and folly; and implanting in their
breasts the seeds of those bad passions which
spring up into many a crime! From such
evils, the prosperity of good men is guarded
by God. The poison is extracted from
it, and the salutary part only left. It is
rendered to them a comfortable and useful
enjoyment of life, affording opportunity for
the exercise of many virtues, which other∣wise
would not have come within their
sphere.</P>
<P>But, <HI>among all things that work for good,</HI>
it is probable that the evils of this life were
particularly designed to be included, as
what we might have least expected to be
subservient to that purpose. It is never∣theless
certain, that from the discipline of
adversity, the most salutary improvements
of human nature have been often derived.
<PB N="103" REF="114"/>
In that severe school the predominant errors
of the mind have been corrected, the in∣temperance
of the giddy spirit has been
allayed and reformed, and that manly se∣riousness
acquired which is the foundation
of true wisdom. By the <HI>sadness of the
countenance, the heart</HI> of the sufferer <HI>has
been made better;</HI> he has been trained up to
fortitude of mind, improved in humanity
to men, and formed to the habits of de∣votion
and resignation to God.</P>
<P>At the same time, it is only <HI>if need be,</HI>
as the Apostle Peter speaks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 6.</NOTE>, that the
righteous <HI>are left for a season in heaviness.</HI>
If it be certain that all things work for their
good, it follows of course, that there is no
superfluous severity, no needless or unne∣cessary
trouble to them, in the constitution
of things. Their afflictions never befal
without a cause, nor are sent but upon a
proper errand. These storms are never al∣lowed
to rise, but in order to dispel some
noxious vapours, and to restore salubrity
<PB N="104" REF="115"/>
to the moral atmosphere.—Herein ap∣pears,
if we may be allowed so to speak,
the wonderful art and skill of the Supreme
Artificer, the profound depth of the divine
wisdom, in extracting, from distresses and
sorrows, the materials of peace and felicity.
Nor are only the external calamities of
good men subservient to this purpose; but
their internal in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irmiti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, their very failings
and errors, are made, by the powerful in∣fluence
of God's grace, to contribute ulti∣mately
to their good. They are thereby
instructed in the knowledge of themselves;
they are properly humbled by the disco∣very
of their own weakness; and trained
to that becoming spirit of contrition and
returning repentance, which is represented
as giving joy to the angels in heaven. He
who <HI>maketh the wrath of man to praise him,</HI> is
not deficient in wisdom and power, to make
even the failings of his servants, in this im∣perfect
state of human nature, redound at
last to his own glory, and to their good.</P>
<P>It must not escape observation, that the
text suggests, not merely that all things
<PB N="105" REF="116"/>
prove good in the issue, or eventually turn
out to the benefit of the righteous, but that
they <HI>work for it.</HI> This expression carries
particular energy. It imports that <HI>all
things</HI> are so formed by God, as to become
active causes of happiness to those who
love him. His infinite wisdom gives to
things in themselves most unapt, an apti∣tude
and fitness to fulfil his own great
ends; disposes and prepares them for their
proper effects; and makes dangers and evils
his instruments for accomplishing the fe∣licity
of his servants. There is a certain
operation and process always going on, by
which, though we are insensible of it, all
things are constantly advancing towards a
happy issue. In the same manner as the
operation of natural causes, though slow
and unperceived, is sure; as the seed
which is sown in the ground is every mo∣ment
unfolding itself; and though no eye
can trace the steps of its progress, yet, with
a silent growth, is ripening and shooting
forth its stalks; so in the moral world,
throughout all the dispensations of Provi∣dence,
<PB N="106" REF="117"/>
there is the same latent, but certain
progress of the seeds of virtue and holiness,
tending towards perfection in the end.
<HI>Light is s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn for the righteous,</HI> as the
Psalmist beautifully employs this metaphor,
<HI>and gladness for the upright in heart</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. xcvii. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is said in the text, not only that all
things thus work, but that they <HI>work toge∣ther
for good;</HI> intimating that they are
made to conspire and concur with one
another, for bringing about what is best
on the whole. Taken singly and indivi∣dually,
it might be difficult to conceive
how each event wrought for good. They
must be viewed in their consequences and
effects; considered in all their dependencies
and connections, as links hanging together
to form one extensive chain. It is by
adjusting into one consistent whole, the
various events that fill up human life;
arranging in the happiest succession all the
occurrences of that complicated seene; and
bending to his own purpose things which
<PB N="107" REF="118"/>
appear most opposite and contrary, that the
Almighty accomplishes his great plan in
behalf of those who <HI>love him, and are the
called according to his purpose.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH is that great edifice of encourage∣ment
and hope, which the gospel of Christ
hath reared for the consolation of those
who sincerely love and serve God. It re∣mains
now that we examine what the pil∣lars
are on which so mighty an edifice rests.
The Apostle speaks, you see, in a strain of
full assurance. He does not say, we be∣lieve,
or we hope, but <HI>we know,</HI> that all
things work together for good.—Let us
consider,</P>
<P>IN the first place, the evidence in sup∣port
of this doctrine, which arises from
the perfections of the divine nature. In
general, that God is good to all, and that
his goodness is especially exerted in behalf
of the righteous, is a principle of religion,
which none will dispute. The only ques∣tion
is, how far that goodness extends,
<PB N="108" REF="119"/>
and whether we can conceive it as ex∣tending
to all that is implied in the text.
Something, it must be confessed, there is
astonishing, and on first view almost incre∣dible
in the assertion, that amidst that in∣finite
combination of events which carry on
the general order of the universe, nothing
shall ever happen but what advances the hap∣piness
of each good man; and which shall
tend to his private interest, as much as if his
existence had formed a system by itself.
But how astonishing soever this may seem
to us, let us first reflect, that this supposes
no effort beyond the power of Him who
is Almighty, or beyond the skill of Him
who is infinite in wisdom. We must not
measure divine operations by the feeble
energies of man. God is the first cause of
all that exists and acts. All events are, at
every moment, in his hands. Nothing
can make any resistance to his purpose,
or fall out in any way beside, or beyond
his plan. At one glance he perceives how
all things are going on throughout his uni∣verse.
Not the minutest object is over∣looked
<PB N="109" REF="120"/>
by Him. No multiplicity of affairs
distracts Him: for to the supreme intelli∣gence,
all things are present at once; and to
the concerns of every good man, his ob∣servation
and attention reach as fully as if
there were no other object under his go∣vernment.</P>
<P>As there is nothing, therefore, in the pro∣mise
of the text, which divine power and
wisdom cannot effect, so neither is there
any thing in it but what divine goodness
gives us reason to believe shall be fulfilled.
The goodness of the Supreme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Being is
very different from that of men. Among
them, it is a principle occasionally operating,
but always limited, and always subject to
alteration and change. Their benefits,
though liberally bestowed at one time, will
at another time be stopped by the inter∣vention
of contrary passions. Their bene∣volence
decays; selfishness and indifference
succeed. But in the nature of the Deity,
there is no principle which can produce
alteration or change in his benevolent pur∣pose
once formed. <HI>Without variableness or
<PB N="110" REF="121"/>
shadow of turning,</HI> whom he hath once
<HI>loved he loveth to the end. The gifts and
calling of God are without repentance.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, xiii. 1. Rom, xi. 29.</NOTE>.
His goodness therefore consists, not in a
mere temporary effusion of blessings, but
is permanent and steady; leading him, not
simply to bestow some things that are
good, and then to stop, but to carry his
gracious purpose to the utmost; in every
instance to do what is best for his servants
on the whole, or in the words of the text,
to make <HI>all things work for their good.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now consider what it would im∣port,
if any single occurrence were to
happen in the course of human affairs,
which had not a good design; which did
not, in one form or other, promote the
benefit of the righteous. What would it
import, but that in such an instance, either
the divine power and wisdom had fallen
short of their effect, or the divine goodness
had neglected and forsaken the virtuous?
It were blasphemous to suppose that the
<PB N="111" REF="122"/>
nature of the Deity was changed; or that
there were, in his government of the
world, some vacant spaces, or neglected in∣tervals,
in which he suffered the reins of
administration to drop out of his hands,
and some evil principle to counteract his
general system. But as all such supposi∣tions
are manifestly inconsistent with the
nature of that God in whom Christians
believe, there appears to follow, from the
consideration of his perfections, evidence
next to demonstration, for the truth of that
doctrine which the text contains.</P>
<P>BUT that we may not rest its evidence
on our own reasonings only, let us next
consider what discovery of his high designs
God hath been pleased to make in the Re∣velation
of the Gospel. Here it is amply
sufficient to have recourse to one signal dis∣pensation
of his government, the redemp∣tion
of the world by Jesus Christ. Hence
arises an argument which carries the most
convincing force; and which accordingly,
in a few verses after the text, is employed
<PB N="112" REF="123"/>
by the Apostle in support of that doctrine
I have been illustrating. <HI>He that spared
not his own Son, but delivered him up for
us all, how shall be not with him also, freely
give us all things?</HI>—Can we in any in∣stance
distrust Him who hath given us
this highest proof of his love? If he
scrupled not to bestow this best gift, is
there any other blessing he will be inclined
to withhold? Having already done so much,
will he leave incomplete his own great
work?—By the death of Christ, we are
taught in scripture, that atonement was
made for sin. He underwent in his suf∣ferings
the punishment due to us. He is
said to have been <HI>wounded for our trans∣gressions,
and bruised for our iniquitics; to have
borne our sins in his own body on the tree.</HI>
From this view of the doctrine of redemp∣tion,
it naturally follows, that Christ having
purchased for his followers the pardon of
their sins, the afflictions they now undergo
are not properly to be considered as punish∣ments,
but as chastisements intended for
their good▪—Add to this, that it is the pe∣culiar
<PB N="113" REF="124"/>
province of our Lord in his present
exalted state, to administer all things for
the good of his church. For this end his
regal power is employed. To this end
his mediation and intercession are directed;
and either these must in some cases prove
ineffectual, or it must follow that all things
work for the good of them who love him.
As much evidence then as we have for
those capital truths on which the whole of
Christianity rests, the same we have for that
high encouragement afforded by the text.</P>
<P>It remains to take notice, in the last
place, of the express and multiplied pro∣mises
of the sacred Scripture to the same
purpose with that in the text. Though
the text alone might have appeared suf∣ficient
for our encouragement; yet, as re∣peated
assurances of the same thing come
home with greater weight to the mind,
it hath pleased God to make this full pro∣vision
for confirming the trust and hope
of his servants: and there can be no doubt
that the plain and explicit words of the di∣vine
promises have had the most comfort∣able
<PB N="114" REF="125"/>
influence on many who could not
so well have supported themselves under
the trials of life, either by reasonings taken
from the divine perfections, or by infer∣ences
drawn from the doctrine of redemp∣tion.
Accordingly, we are not left merely
to reason or to infer, but are in express
terms told by God himself, that <HI>godliness
shall be prositable unto all things; that God
the Lord is a sun and a shield, giving grace
and glory, and withholding no good thing
from them that walk uprightly; that no evil
shall happen to the just; for the Lord is their
keeper, who never slumbers nor sleeps; that
his eyes are ever on the rig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ous; that
when they pass through the waters, be
will be with them, and through the rivers
they shall not overflow them;</HI> and in fine
<HI>that all his paths are mercy and truth to
such as fear him, and keep his covenant</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tim. iv. 8. Ps. lxxxiv. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. Ps. c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xi. 3, 4, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
These promises, and many more to the
same effect, with which the Scripture
abounds, plainly express a particular care
<PB N="115" REF="126"/>
of Heaven exercised about every single
good man; they signify as real an interpo∣sition
of Providence, as if the laws of nature
had been suspended on his account.</P>
<P>The opinion entertained by some, that
the Providence of God ext<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds no farther
than to a general superintendance of the
laws of nature, without interposing in the
particular concerns of individuals, is con∣trary
both to reason and to scripture. It
renders the government of the Almighty
altogether loose and contingent, and would
leave no ground for reposing any trust
under its protection. For the majority of
human affairs would then be allowed to
fluctuate in a fortuitous course, without
moving in any regular direction, and
without tending to any one scope. The
uniform doctrine of the sacred writings is,
that throughout the universe nothing hap∣pens
without God; that his hand is ever
active, and his decree or permission inter∣venes
in all; that nothing is too great or
unwieldy for his management, and nothing
so minute and inconsiderable as to be below
<PB N="116" REF="127"/>
his inspection and care. While he is
guiding the sun and the moon in their
course through the Heavens; while in this
inferiour world he is ruling among empires,
<HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illing the ragings of the waters and the
tumults of the people,</HI> he is at the same time
watching over the humble good man, who,
in the obscurity of his cottage, is serving
and worshipping Him. In order to ex∣press
this vigilance of Providence in the
strongest terms, our Saviour himself has
said, that the very <HI>bairs of our head are all
numbered by God;</HI> and that <HI>while two spar∣rows
are sold for a farhing, not one of
them falls to the ground without his plea∣sure.</HI>
The consolation which this affords,
he applies to his disciples in what follows:
<HI>Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value
than many sparrows</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. x. 30, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.</NOTE>. It is on this doc∣trine
of a special and particular Providence
he grounds that exhortation against worldly
solicitude and anxiety, which accords so
fully with the argument we have been
<PB N="117" REF="128"/>
pursuing; <HI>your Heavenly Father knoweth
what things ye have need of; take therefore
no thought for the morrow; but seek first
the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and
all these things shall be added unto you</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi. 33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS it has been shown on what
grounds our assured belief rests of the de∣claration
in the text, that all things are
made to work for the good of the righteous.
It is not a promise which admits of ambi∣guity,
and which we might be afraid to
interpret to its full extent. It is on every
side confirmed by the most sober reasonings
we can form from the divine perfections;
by the whole tenour of the dispensation of
redemption; by many repeated assurances
given us in the sacred writings.</P>
<P>THE great objection, I am aware, that
will be started by many against the whole
of what has been advanced in this discourse,
is founded on the seeming prevalence of
<PB N="118" REF="129"/>
evil and disorder in the world. This, it
will be said, is so conspicuous, as to be
inconsistent with the representation that
has been given of a Supreme Being, who
attends, in every instance, to the welfare
of every good man. The present state of
the world may be suspected to carry more
the appearance of a conflict between two
opposite principles of good and evil, who
divide the empire of the world, and of
course create a mixture of some good things
with more that are evil. How often, it
will be said, are the best men insensible of
any such gradual improvement, or any such
tendency in the general course of things,
as has been represented, to promote their
interest; but on the contrary, left comfort∣less
and forlorn, in the midst of surround∣ing
prosperous vice, to mourn over disap∣pointed
hopes and bitter sorrows, without
receiving the least mark of favourable in∣tentions
from Heaven? Hence the excla∣mations
they have often uttered; “Where
is the Lord, and where the sceptre of
righteousness and truth? Doth God in∣deed
<PB N="119" REF="130"/>
see, and is there knowledge in the
Most High? Or hath He <HI>forgotten to be
gracious, and in anger shut up his tender
mercies?”</HI></P>
<P>Now, in answer to such objections, let us
consider how much reason there is for
ascribing those dark and doubtful appear∣ances,
to the narrow and confined views
which our state allows us to take. The
designs of the Almighty are enlarged and
vast. They comprehend not only the
whole of our present existence, but they
include worlds unknown, and stretch for∣wards
into eternity. Hence much dark∣ness
and mystery must of course rest at
present on the administration of God; and
we, who see only so small a portion of a
great and complicated system, must be
very inadequate judges, both of the ten∣dency
of each part, and of the issue of the
whole. We behold no more than the out∣side
of things. Our views glide over the
surface; and even along that surface, they
extend but a short way. But under the sur∣face
there lie hidden springs, that are set
<PB N="120" REF="131"/>
in motion by a superiour hand, and are
bringing forwards revolutions unforeseen
by us. There are <HI>wheels moving within
wheels,</HI> as the prophet Ez<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kiel beheld in
mysterious vision<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ez<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k. x. 10.</NOTE>.—We, measuring all
things by the shortness of our own dura∣tion,
are constantly accelerating our de∣signs
to their period. We are eager in
advancing rapidly towards the completion
of our wishes. But it is not so with God.
In his sight, <HI>a thousand years are as one day:</HI>
and while his infinitely wise plans are con∣tinually
advancing with sure progress, that
progress to our impatience appears slow.
Let us have patience for a while, and
these plans shall in due time be developed,
and will explain themselves. His language
to us is, <HI>What I do thou knowest not now;
but thou shalt know hereafter</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John, xiii. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Let us attend to the analogy of Nature.
We shall find it to hold very generally,
both in the moral and natural world, that
nothing arises suddenly to the perfection
<PB N="121" REF="132"/>
of its state; that all improvement is carried
on by leisurely gradations; and that most
frequently it is through harsh and unpro∣mising
beginnings, things are brought to a
favourable conclusion. This might be il∣lustrated
by many examples.—Take, for
one instance, the progress of the seasons.
Who that for the first time beheld the
earth, in midst of winter, bound up with
frost, or drenched in floods of rain, or
covered with snow, would have imagined
that Nature, in this dreary and torpid state,
was working towards its own renovation
in the spring? Yet we by experience know
that those vicissitudes of winter are neces∣sary
for fertilizing the earth; and that
under wintry rains and snows lie concealed
the seeds of those roses that are to blossom
in the spring; of those fruits that are to
ripen in summer; and of the corn and
wine, which are, in harvest, to make glad
the heart of man. We perhaps relish not
such disagreeable commencements of the
pleasing season. It would be more agree∣able
<PB N="122" REF="133"/>
to us, to be always entertained with a
fair and clear atmosphere, with cloudless
skies, and perpetual sunshine: while yet,
in such climates as we have most know∣ledge
of, the earth, were it always to re∣main
in such a state, would refuse to yield
its fruits; and in the midst of our imagined
scenes of beauty, the starved inhabitants
would pcrish for want of food.—Let us
therefore quietly submit to Nature and to
Providence. Let us conceive this life, of
whose evils we so often complain, to be
the winter of our existence. Then the
rains must fall, and the winds must roar
around us. But, sheltering ourselves, as we
can, under a good conscience, and under
faith and trust in God, let us wait till the
spring arrive. For a spring, an eternal
spring, awaits the people of God. In the
new heavens and the new earth no storms
shall any more arise, nor any unpleasing
vicissitudes of season return. It shall then
at last appear how former sufferings have
produced their proper effect; how the
<PB N="123" REF="134"/>
tempests of life have tended to bring on an
everlasting calm; in fine, how <HI>all things
have wrought together for good to them
that love God, and who are the called ac∣cording
to his purpose.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM cxxii. 6, 7, 8, 9.</BIBL>
<Q>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they shall
prosper that love thee. Peace be within
thy walls, and prosperity within thy pa∣laces.
For my brethren and companions'
sake, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
Because of the house of the Lord our God,
I will seek thy peace.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is one of the infirmities belonging to
human nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VI.</NOTE> that continued enjoy∣ment
of the highest blessings is apt to de∣preciate
<PB N="125" REF="136"/>
them in our esteem. This un∣happy
weakness shows itself, not only with
respect to the light of the sun, and the
beauties of nature, which we have been long
accustomed to behold, but also with re∣spect
to health, peace, religion, and liberty.
Let any one of those blessings have been
long familiar to us; let a tract of time
have effaced the remembrance of the dis∣tress
which we suffered from the want of
it; and it is surprising how lightly men
are ready to prize the degree of happiness
which they continue to possess.—In midst
of that peaceful and secure state which the
inhabitants of this land have long enjoyed;
surrounded with the chief blessings that
render life comfortable, how few have any
just sense of the gratitude they owe to
Heaven for such singular felicity? Nay,
is it not much to be lamented that there
should have sprung up among us an unac∣countable
spirit of discontent and disaf∣fection,
feeding itself with ideal grievances
and visionary projects of reformation, till
it has gone nigh to light up the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orch of
<PB N="126" REF="137"/>
sedition?—When government has now,
for wise and proper reasons, called us to∣gether
in a religious assembly, our thoughts
cannot be more suitably employed than in
reviewing the grounds on which, as good
Christians and faithful citizens, we have
reason to entertain the warmest affection
for our native country, and to put a just
value on that constitution of government,
civil and sacred, under which it is placed.
—In the words of the text, you see with
what zeal the heart of the pious Psalmist
glowed for the prosperity of his country.
By the accumulation of expressions which
he employs, and the variety of topics he
suggests, you see the fervour with which
this subject animated his heart.—It will be
proper to consider, first, the grounds on
which love for our country rests; and next,
the duties to which this affection naturally
gives rise.</P>
<P>BUT, before entering on any of those
topics, it may be proper to take notice of
the speculations of some pretended philo∣sophers,
<PB N="127" REF="138"/>
who represent the love of our
country as hardly entitled to any place
among the virtues. They affect to con∣sider
it as a mere prejudice of education;
a narrow attachment, which tends to ope∣rate
against more enlarged interests. We
ought, say they, to view ourselves as citi∣zens
of the world, and extend our benevo∣lence,
equally, to all nations and all man∣kind.
—Nothing can be more empty and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utile than such reasonings. The wisdom
of our Creator hath linked us by the ties
of natural affection, first to our families
and children; next to our brothers, rela∣tions,
and friends; then to our acquaint∣ance,
and to the several societies and com∣munities
to which we belong. By instincts
implanted in our nature, He has formed
our hearts to enter readily into their
interests; and has thus directed our
benevolence to act primarily within that
sphere, where its exertions can be most
powerful and most useful. It is evident,
that by acting on this plan, the general
welfare is promoted in a much higher de∣gree,
<PB N="128" REF="139"/>
than if our social affections had no
particular direction given them, but were
to float, as it were, in empty space, with∣out
any more determined object on which
to act than the whole human race, where
they never could act with any effect. He
who contends that he is not bound to have
any more concern for the interests of Great
Britain, than for those of France, or any
other country, ought to hold, on the same
grounds, that he is under no obligation to
consult the welfare of his children and
family, his brothers and friends, more than
that of the most distant stranger; being
equally connected, as he holds, with all, by
the common brotherhood of the human
race. It is much to be suspected, that this
wonderful extensive philanthropy is only
the language of those who have no affec∣tions
at all; or perhaps, that it is the
language assumed by some, who, bearing
in their hearts a secret preference to
the interests of another country above
their own, but a preference which they
choose not to avow, affect to cover it
<PB N="129" REF="140"/>
under this disguise, of a liberal, enlarged
spirit.</P>
<P>Let us, my friends, disclaiming all such
refinements of false philosophy, and fol∣lowing
the dictates of plain good sense, and
natural affection, resolve to love our native
country, and in every proper way to show
our attachment to it. This was the spirit
which so honourably distinguished patriots,
heroes, and legislators of old, and has trans∣mitted
their names with veneration to pos∣terity;
while they, who felt no affection
for the country to which they belonged, or
who were treacherous to its interests, have
been stigmatized with infamy among
all civilized nations. I admit that there
have been occasions, on which attachment
to a particular country has been pursued
to a very unjustifiable length. Wherever
it has led the natives of one country to
state themselves as enemies to the rest of
mankind, and to endeavour at aggrandizing
themselves by ruining all around them, the
pretended love of their country is then be∣come
no other than a conspiracy against all
<PB N="130" REF="141"/>
other nations, and instead of being a virtue is
the offspring of ambition, pride, and vanity.</P>
<P>I proceed now to show the just grounds
on which it becomes us to be zealous for
the welfare of that happy island, to which
we have the honour and the blessing to
belong. Let us consider our native coun∣try
in three lights; as the seat of private
enjoyment and happiness; as the seat of
true religion; as the seat of laws, liberty,
and good government.</P>
<P>I. As the seat of all our best enjoyments
in private life. There, my brethren, after
we first drew breath, was our tender in∣fancy
reared with care; there, our inno∣cent
childhood sported; there, our careless
youth grew up amidst companions and
friends; there, our dearest connexions were
formed; there, after having passed the
happiest years of our life, we look forward
for our old age to rest in peace.—These
are circumstances which endear, and ought
to endear a home, a native land, to every
human heart. If there be any names
<PB N="131" REF="142"/>
known among men that awaken tender
sentiments in the breast, the names of fa∣ther,
mother, spouse, child, brother, sister,
or friend, these all recall our thoughts to
our native land, and cannot, even in idea,
be separated from it. When we name our
own country, we name the spot of the
earth within which all that is most dear
to us lies. To be long absent from it, is
a circumstance of distress; but to be ex∣cluded
from the hope of ever returning to
it, sinks the spirits of the worthy and the
brave into extreme depression. Its very
dust appears to them to be precious. Its
well-known fields, and mountains, and
rivers, become, in their eyes, a sort of con∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crated
ground; the remembrance of
which often touches the heart with sensa∣tions
of more tender joy, than can be raised
by scenes more rich, and objects more
splendid, in any foreign land.</P>
<P>These are feelings, which nature, or ra∣ther
the God of nature, has implanted in
the mind of man; and base and vile is he
who studies to craze them, intimately con∣nected
<PB N="132" REF="143"/>
as they are with our very best af∣fections.—Can
we think, my friends, how
long we have fat <HI>under our vine and our
fig-tree,</HI> in peace and joy, encircled by our
families and friends, in that happy land we
possess; and, with this pleasing remembrance
dwelling on our minds, can we think with
indifference of any danger which threatens
the welfare of that country which has been
the mother, the nurse, the guardian of us
all? Can we think without horror, of fo∣reign
invasion laying waste our fruitful
and smiling fields, or of lawless anarchy
and tumultuary mobs attacking our peace∣ful
habitations?—No! <HI>Peace be within thy
walls, and prosperity within thy palaces,</HI> will
ever be the earnest prayer of every vir∣tuous
man; <HI>for my brethren and compa∣nions'
sake, I will ever say, Peace be within
thee!</HI></P>
<P>II. WE love our country as the seat
of true religion. Freed from the domi∣nion
of Popish superstition and darkness
which so long overspread the earth, here
<PB N="133" REF="144"/>
the light of the blessed reformation con∣tinues
to shine in its greatest splendour.
Here the forms of religious worship are
encumbered with no pageantry of vain
rites; but, agreeably to God's word, are
plain and simple, yet solemn and venerable.
Religion has among us neither been the
engine of ecclesiastical tyranny, nor the
instrument of princely despotism. It has
maintained a proper alliance with the re∣gular
government of the state, and the
order of public tranquillity. The church
that has been established by law, in the
two separate divisions of the island, is suited
to the genius and dispositions of the people
in each. While to the established church
is given that protection and support from
government, which both the interests of
religion and the welfare of the state render
proper and due; yet no rigid conformity
to it is exacted. All persecution for con∣science
sake, is unknown. They who, in
their modes of thinking, or in their religious
forms, differ from the established church,
are at full liberty, without reproach, to
<PB N="134" REF="145"/>
worship God according to their own opi∣nions
and the rites of their fathers, as long
as they infringe not the public tranquillity,
nor disturb the state.</P>
<P>I now ask, what establishment of religion
more friendly to public happiness<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could
be desired or framed? How zealous ought
we to be for its preservation? How much
on our guard against every danger which
threatens to trouble or overthrow it?—
Can there be any among us so infatuated
as to wish to exchange it for that new
form of things which has produced such
fatal effects on a neighbouring land? Were
it ever to be introduced among us, it is
not the return of antient superstition, it is
not the bondage of the church of Rome
we would have to dread; evils great in
themselves, but small in comparison of what
such a revolution would produce. As soon
as under the guise of philosophy, and with
the pretence of unlimited toleration, the
established forms of religion were demo∣lished
in France, the flood-gates were
opened to pour a torrent of avowed in∣fidelity,
<PB N="135" REF="146"/>
atheism, and all the grossest im∣moralities,
over that devoted country. We
have beheld the throne and the altar over∣thrown
together; and nothing but a
wretched ruin lest, where once a stately
sabric stood. We have seen the venerable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngion, stripped of their sub∣sistence,
torn from their churches, driven
from their homes, and forced to wander
as exiles, and beg their bread in a foreign
land.—We have seen the last consolation
of the wretched destroyed, and the grave
sealed against their hope, by the public de∣claration
that death is an eternal sleep.—Such
have been the blessed fruits of that new
order of things which boasted of being to
restore happiness to all the nations. Such
are the consequences we have to expect
among ourselves, if ever the like dangerous
opinions shall prevail in Britain.—With
horror let us turn away from the thought.
With earnestness let us <HI>pray for the peace
of our Jerusalem; and for the house of the
Lord our God, let us zealously seek its good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="147"/>
III. WE love our country as the seat of
liberty and laws; a mild, wise, and happy
government. This opens a much wider
field of discourse than the bounds of a
sermon admit. But on this part of the
subject being happily anticipated by so
many excellent publications which have
lately appeared, I shall content myself with
making a few leading observations.—The
ends for which men unite in society and
submit to government are, to enjoy security
to their property, and freedom to their
persons from all injustice or violence. The
more completely those ends are obtained,
with the least diminution of personal li∣berty,
the nearer such government ap∣proaches
to perfection: I say, approaches
to it; for a perfect government is a mere
chimera. Before we can expect it to take
place, we must wait till we see any one
thing whatever arrive at perfection on
earth. The two extremes to be guarded
against are, despotism, where all are slaves;
and anarchy, where all would rule, and
none obey.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="148"/>
The British government may appear at
different periods to have inclined sometimes
to the one, and sometimes to the other of
those extremes. In its present state, it may
justly be accounted to be removed to an
equal distance from either of those evils;
and therefore to have approached nearer
to the perfection of social order, than any
other government, antient or modern. To
this point it has arrived in the progress of
ages, not in consequence of theories formed
by speculative men, such as our modern
reformers, but in consequence of experi∣ments
made, and trials undergone. Expe∣rience,
that great parent of all, but espe∣cially
of political, wisdom, taught a brave,
generous, and high-spirited people, how to
correct, by degrees, preceding evils, and
to form the wisest plan for liberty and se∣curity.
In this state we now find the
British constitution. It stands among the
nations of the earth, like an antient oak in
the wood, which, after having overcome
many a blast, overtops the other trees of
the forest, and commands respect and vene∣ration.
<PB N="138" REF="149"/>
All foreigners look to it with
wonder, and with envy, as the happiest
system that ever was devised for uniting
dignity in the magistrate and liberty in the
subject, with protection and security to all.
Justly may we challenge those who attempt
to criticise it, to produce, from the annals
of history, any example of such a multitude
of men as the British subjects, held together
in the bonds of civil society, under so few
restraints, and with such full enjoyment of
freedom as we possess: blessed too for a
whole century past with a succession of
princes, who made the laws of the land the
rule of their government; blessed now with
a Sovereign at the head of the empire, to
whom faction itself cannot impute, through∣out
his long reign, any acts of tyranny,
cruelty, or oppression; whose personal vir∣tues
and whose domestic conduct hold forth
to the nation such a high example of piety,
decency, and good order, as, if generally fol∣lowed,
would render all his subjects happy.</P>
<P>In opposition to such sentiments as I
have now delivered in favour of the con∣stitution
<PB N="139" REF="150"/>
of our country, we are called
upon, by a certain set of men, to look to a
republic as the glory of all governments.
There, we are told, every man comes forth
to act his part with vigour; and by the
exertion of his talents, has opportunities of
rising to the highest distinction and power.
—In reply to this, let it be observed, first,
that there are no advantages claimed by a
republic, but what under the British con∣stitution
are enjoyed to the full. On the
exertion of any laudable and honourable
talent whatever, no restraint is laid; no
odious distinctions take place between the
nobility and the people; no severe ex∣clusive
privileges are possessed by the former
to the prejudice of the latter; but merit
in every rank has the freest scope, and
examples abound of persons rising by their
talents from ordinary rank and humble
birth to high distinction in the state.</P>
<P>But next, it may be boldly asserted, that
of all the forms of government which have
been established on the earth, the republican
is attended with the greatest disadvantages
<PB N="140" REF="151"/>
to those who live under it. In a small
state, where the people resemble the in∣habitants
of one family, the management
of their concerns can more safely be carried
on by their own joint counsels, without
any supreme magistrate. But if govern∣ment
be extended over a large territory,
and over numerous inhabitants of different
orders and fortunes, it has ever been found
impossible to preserve any well-regulated
balance of power under a republican con∣stitution.
It has ever been, and never
can be, any other, than a perpetual con∣test
between oligarchy and democracy;
between the rich and the poor; between
a few popular leaders who aspire to the
chief influence, and the unruly violence of
a turbulent multitude. In such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ates an
internal warfare of this kind has been al∣most
always carried on, with such vio∣lent
convulsions and party animos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties, as
have given rise to more miseries than have
been suffered under any other form of go∣vernment
whatever.—To no purpose are
quoted to us the heroes of Greece and
<PB N="141" REF="152"/>
Rome. Amidst the agitations of popular
government, occasions will sometimes be
afforded for eminent abilities to break forth
with peculiar lustre. But while public agi∣tations
allow a few individuals to be un∣commonly
distinguished, the general con∣dition
of the people remains calamitous
and wretched. Under despotic govern∣ments,
miserable indeed is the condition of
those who are near the throne. But while
they are often the sport, and the victims
of capricious cruelty, the ordinary mass of
the people, at a distance from the thunder
of power, are l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, for the most part, in
their inferiour situations, unmolested.
Whereas, under a multitude of popular
governours, oppression is more extensively
felt. It pen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rates into the interiour of
families; and by republican tyranny the
humble and obscure are liable to be as
much harassed and vexed as the great and
the wealthy.</P>
<P>If any one doubt of those facts, let him
look at the present state of the republic
established in that country to which we
<PB N="142" REF="153"/>
have so often been unfortunately obliged to
allude. He will there behold a memorable
example set forth to the world; but an
example, not for imitation, but for instruc∣tion
and caution; an example, not of ex∣ploits
to be copied, or of advantages to be
gained, but of all the evils against which men,
joined in society, ought to stand on their
guard. He will behold the republican
halls hung round with monuments of pro∣scriptions,
massacres, imprisonments, requi∣sitions,
domiciliary searches, and such other
trophies of the glorious victory of repub∣licanism
over monarchical power. <HI>O my
soul, come not thou into their secret; into their
assembly, mine honour, be not thou united;
for their anger was fierce, and their wrath
was cruel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Genesis, xlix. 6, 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ENOUGH has now been said to convince
every reasonable subject of the British go∣vernment,
that he has good grounds for
loving and respecting his country. It re∣mains
<PB N="143" REF="154"/>
to point out the duties to which the
love of our country gives rise. Though
these branch out into many particulars,
they may be comprised under two general
heads; the duties which are required of us
in our character as private men, and those
which belong to us in a political capacity
as subjects and citizens.</P>
<P>FIRST, as private men and Christians,
let us cultivate those virtues which are es∣sential
to the prosperity of our country.
The foundation of all public happiness
must be laid in the good conduct of indi∣viduals;
in their industry, sobriety, justice,
and regular attention to the duties of their
several stations. Such virtues are the
sinews and strength of the state; they are
the supports of its prosperity at home, and
of its reputation abroad; while luxury,
corruption, venality, and idleness, unnerve
the public vigour, disgrace the public cha∣racter,
and pave the way to general ruin.
Every vice, however fashionable, that be∣comes
prevalent, is the infusion of so much
<PB N="144" REF="155"/>
poison into the public cup; and in propor∣tion
to the degree of its prevalence, will the
health and strength of the nation be impaired.
Few of us by our arms, and fewer still by our
counsels, can have influence in promoting
that welfare of our country which all pro∣fess
to desire. But there is one sphere in
which all of us can act as benefactors to
it; by setting a good example, each in his
own line, and performing a worthy and
honourable part. <HI>Righteousness</HI> will <HI>ever
exalt a nation;</HI> and <HI>wickedness</HI> will be, first,
the reproach, and then the <HI>ruin of every
people.</HI></P>
<P>Among those virtues to which the love
of our country calls us, let us not forget
piety to God. Without a proper sense of
religion, and a due acknowledgment of that
supreme Power which rules among the
kingdoms, no nation was ever found to
prosper long. Let those sophistical rea∣soners,
who would teach us that philosophy
ought now to supersede the antient preju∣dices
of Religion, look to the history of
those republics which they so highly
<PB N="145" REF="156"/>
admire, especially to the history of the
Romans. They will there find, that,
during the freest and most flourishing
periods of the republic, the Romans were
the most religious of all nations. The
Senate at no time assembled, no Consul
entered on his office, no great public mea∣sure
was ever undertaken, without previous
religious services, without prayers and sa∣crifice.
After every victory, solemn thanks∣givings
were offered to the gods; and upon
any defeat that was sustained, public hu∣miliations
and processions were decreed, in
order to deprecate the displeasure of
Heaven. That much superstition and
folly entered into what they called reli∣gion,
will be readily admitted; but still it
implied reverence to a supreme Power in
Heaven, which ruled all the affairs of men,
and was entitled to their homage. Hence
that sacred respect to an oath, as an in∣violable
obligation, which long distin∣guished
the Romans; and historians have
remarked, that when the reverence for an
oath began to be diminished, and the loose
<PB N="146" REF="157"/>
epicurean system which discarded the belief
of Providence to be introduced, the Ro∣man
honour and prosperity from that
period began to decline.—These are
things that belong to our admonition, on
whom <HI>the ends of the world are come.</HI></P>
<P>IN the second place, as we would show
our love to our country, let us join to the
virtues of private men, those which belong
to us in a political capacity as subjects and
citizens. These must appear in loyalty to
our sovereign, in submission to the autho∣rity
of rulers and magistrates, and in rea∣diness
to support the measures that are
taken for public welfare and defence.
Without regard to such duties as these, it is
evident, not only that the state cannot
flourish, but even that it cannot subsist.
Accordingly they are strongly bound upon
us by the authority of scripture. Let every
sou! be subject to the higher powers; who∣soever
resisteth the power, resisteth the ordi∣nance
of God. For rulers are not a terror
to good works, but to the evil. Wherefore
<PB N="147" REF="158"/>
ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath,
but also for conscience sake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 1—6.</NOTE>. Such passages
as these, there is little danger of our misun∣derstanding
at present, as if they enjoined
a slavish submission to authority in things
unlawful. This is by no means the ex∣treme
to which the spirit of the times
points, or to which the nature of our civil
constitution leads. The full opportunity
that is given for the voice of the people
being at all times heard, the freedom of
discussion on all political matters that is al∣lowed
both in discourse and writing, is a
sufficient guard against all approaches to
unwarrantable stretches of power in the
ruler, and to unlimited submission in the
subject.</P>
<P>But while we duly value this high ad∣vantage
of the liberty of the press and the
freedom of political discussion, and when
we behold it perpetually acting as a cen∣sorial
check on all who are in power, let us
beware, lest, abusing our liberty, we suffer it
<PB N="148" REF="159"/>
to degenerate into licentiousness. The
multitude, we well know, are always prone
to find fault with those who are set over
them, and to arraign their conduct; and
too often this spirit appears when public
dangers ought to silence the voice of dis∣content,
and to unite every heart and hand
in the common cause.—The management
of a great empire, espccially in difficult
times, is the conduct of an unwieldy and
intricate machine, in directing the move∣ments
of which, where is the hand so steady
as never to err? Instead of the violent cen∣sures
which the giddy and presumptuous
are so ready to pour forth, moderation in
discussing matters of which they are very
incompetent judges, would be much more
wise and becoming. The art of govern∣ment
and legislation is undoubtedly the
most nice and difficult of all the arts in
which the human mind can be engaged;
and where the greatest preparation of know∣ledge,
experience, and ability are abso∣lutely
requisite to qualify men for the task.
But in times when legislation is considered
<PB N="149" REF="160"/>
as a trade which every man is qualified to
take up; when the manufacturer quits his
loom, and the artisan lays down his tools,
in order to contrive plans for reforming
the state, and to constitute societies for car∣rying
his plans into execution; what can
be expected to follow from such a spirit, if
it were to become prevalent, but the most
direful confusion?—Were the rashness of
some, whose intentions are innocent, the
only evil to be dreaded, the danger would
be less. But it is always to be apprehended
that the operations of such persons are di∣rected
by men who have deeper designs in
view; who seek to embroil the state in
order to bring forward themselves; whose
aim it is to rise into eminence, though it
were on the ruins of public tranquillity and
order. Let such men, if any such there
be, consider well what the consequences
may be of fomenting the spirit of presump∣tuous
innovation. It is a dangerous wea∣pon
which they attempt to wield. By the
agitation which they raise among a blind
multitude, they are giving impulse to the
<PB N="150" REF="161"/>
motions of a violent engine, which often
discharges its explosions on the heads of
those who first touched its springs.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, let us, my brethren, be
thankful that our grounds of discontent, whe∣ther
founded on real or imaginary grievances,
are so few; and that for so great a number
of public blessings, we have reason to bless
the God of Heaven. We live in a land
of pure religion, of liberty, and laws, and
under a just and mild government. How∣ever
the opinions of men may differ about
this or that political measure adopted by
government, it may with confidence be
said, that we have much reason to respect
those rulers, under whose administration
the empire, though engaged in a hazardous
and expensive war, has all along continued
to hold a high rank among the nations of
Europe, and has attained to that flou∣rishing
state of commerce, opulence, and
safety, in which we behold it at this day:
insomuch that perhaps the greatest dangers
we have to apprehend, arise from the jea∣lousy
<PB N="151" REF="162"/>
with which rival nations behold our
superiority at sea, and our wealth and
strength at home.—Let our prayers ascend
frequently to Heaven for the continuance
of those blessings; for <HI>the peace of our Je∣rusalem;
for peace within her walls, and
prosperity within her palaces;</HI> and let the
admonition of scripture never be forgotten;

<Q>Say now unto her, “Behold thou hast been
careful for us with all this care; what
is to be done for thee? Wouldst thou be
spoken for to the King, or to the Captain
of the Host?” And she answered, “I
dwell among mine own people.”</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A PIOUS and respectable woman of
Shunem had exercised great hospita∣lity
to the prophet Elisha.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VII.</NOTE> In order to ac∣commodate
him in his various journeyings,
she had caused a chamber to be built for
him, adjacent to her house, where he might
<PB N="153" REF="164"/>
be furnished with all that, according to the
simplicity of those times, was wanted for
his entertainment. In the text, the pro∣phet,
by his servant Gehazi, acknowledges
the obligations he lay under to this good
woman for her care and attention; and
being at that time in favour with the king of
Israel, desires to know, whether, in return
for her kindness, he should apply to the
king, or the captain of the host, in her be∣half,
and procure advancement to her in
rank and fortune. Her answer bespeaks all
the modesty of one who was satisfied and
contented with her present lot. Without
any affectation of uncommon virtue, or
any haughty contempt of the prophet's
offers, she mildly replies, “<HI>I dwell among
mine own people.</HI>” “I dwell in the con∣dition
to which I was born; in my native
land; among my original connections,
and persons of my own rank; and living
there in peace, I have no desires of aspir∣ing
to a higher rank.”</P>
<P>The temper of this worthy Shunamite,
who could so properly set bounds to her de∣sires,
<PB N="154" REF="165"/>
and enjoy her present condition with
contentment, is what I now propose to your
imitation. It stands in opposition to that
restless and discontented spirit which so
often sets men at variance with their
condition in the world, makes them
look with contempt on that state of life
and sphere of action which Providence
has allotted them; and encouraging every
real or supposed discouragement to prey
upon their minds, makes them pine for
some change of fortune.</P>
<P>It is proper, however, to observe, that
this moderation of spirit which I am now
recommending, is not inconsistent with our
having a sense of what is uneasy or dis∣tressing
in our lot, and endeavouring, by
fair means, to render our condition more
agreeable. Entire apathy, or passive indif∣ference
to all the circumstances of our
external state, is required by no precept
of religion. What a virtuous degree of
contentment requires and supposes, is, that
with a mind free from repining anxiety,
we make the best of our condition whatever
<PB N="155" REF="166"/>
it is; enjoying such good things as God
is pleased to bestow upon us, with a thank∣ful
and cheerful heart; without envy at
those who appear more prosperous than us;
without any attempt to alter our condition
by unfair means; and without any mur∣muring
against the Providence of Heaven.
—“In that state in which it pleased God
to place me at my birth, I am ready to
remain, as long as it shall be his pleasure
to continue me there. He has placed me
among my equals. Such comforts as he
saw meet for me to possess, he has be∣stowed.
These I shall study to improve;
and by his kind Providence favouring
my industry and application, I may hope
they will be increased. In the mean time,
I rest satisfied; and complain not. <HI>I
dwell among mine own people.</HI>”</P>
<P>But if this acquiescence in our condition
is to be considered as belonging to that
contentment which religion requires, what
becomes, it will be said, of that laudable
ambition, which has prompted many boldly
to aspire with honour and success far be∣yond
<PB N="156" REF="167"/>
their original state of life?—I readily
admit, that on some among the sons of men,
such high talents are bestowed, as mark
them out by the hand of God for superiour
elevation; by rising to which, many, both
in antient and modern times, have had the
opportunity of distinguishing themselves as
benefactors to their country and to man∣kind.
But these are only a few scattered
stars that shine in a wide hemisphere; such
rare examples afford no model for general
conduct.—It is not to persons of this descrip∣tion,
that I now speak. I address myself
to the multitude; to the great body of men
in all the various walks of ordinary life.
Them I warn of the danger of being misled,
by vanity and self-conceit, to think them∣selves
deserving of a much higher station
than they possess. I warn them, not to
nourish aspiring desires for objects beyond
their power of attaining, or capacity of
enjoying; and thereby to render themselves
unhappy in their present condition, and
dissatisfied with all that belongs to it.—By
this restless discontented temper, I shall pro∣ceed
<PB N="157" REF="168"/>
to show that they incur much guilt,
and involve themselves in great folly and
misery.</P>
<P>FIRST, discontent carries in its nature
much guilt and sin. With this considera∣tion
I begin, because I am afraid that dis∣contentment
is commonly treated, in a reli∣gious
view, more slightly than it deserves.
A contented temper, we are apt to say, is a
great happiness to those who have it; and
a discontented one, we call an unlucky turn
of mind; as if we were speaking of a
good or bad constitution of body, of some∣thing
that depended not at all on ourselves,
but was merely the gift of Nature.—
Ought this to be the sentiment, either of a
reasonable man, or a Christian; of one who
knows himself to be endowed with powers
for governing his own spirit, or who believes
in God and in a world to come? What, I
bese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch you, do all the risings of discontent
within you import, but so much concealed
rebellion against the government of that
supreme Being, who hath appointed your
<PB N="158" REF="169"/>
place in the world? When you repine at
your state, as below what you deserved, do
you not inwardly tax Him with injustice
and partiality, for conferring his favours on
others more unworthy of them, and leav∣ing
you neglected and humbled? By treat∣ing
with contempt the blessings he allows
to your state, do you not, in effect, tell him
that his blessings are not worthy of being
enjoyed, and merit no thanks, because he
does not give you more?—The outward
expressions of such sentiments, you may
suppress. You may affect to appear reli∣gious,
by shows of reverence and homage;
but such appearances deceive not God.
Every habitually discontented person is, and
must be, ill affected towards Him: nay,
though he would wish to conceal it from
himself, he is a secret blasphemer of the
Almighty.</P>
<P>Besides impiety, discontent carries along
with it, as its inseparable concomitants,
several other sinful passions. It implies
pride; or an unreasonable estimation of
our own merit, in comparison with others.
<PB N="159" REF="170"/>
It implies covetousness, or an inordinate
desire for the advantages of external for∣tune,
as the only real goods. It implies,
and always engenders, envy, or ill nature,
and hatred towards all whom we see rising
above us in the world. Dare we treat that
as a slight infirmity, or a constitutional
weakness merely, which imports some of
the worst dispositions and passions of the
human heart?—The discontented man
is never found without a great share of
malignity. His spleen irritates and sours
his temper, and leads him to discharge its
venom on all with whom he stands con∣nected.
He can act his part well, in no
relation of life. In public affairs, and in
private business, he is always given to fret∣fulness
and complaint. While the man of
contented mind, easy and happy in himself,
is disposed for living well with others, and
spreads around him that cheerfulness which
he possesses; the restless discontented person
is always a troubler of the world; neither
a good friend, nor a good neighbour, nor
a good subject or citizen.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="171"/>
IN the second place, as this disposition
infers much sin, so it argues great folly, and
involves men in many miseries. If there
be any first principle of wisdom, it is un∣doubtedly
this: the distresses that are re∣moveable,
endeavour to remove; those
which cannot be removed, bear with as
little disquiet as you can: in every situation
of life there are comforts; find them out
and enjoy them. But this maxim, in all
its parts, is disregarded by the man of dis∣content.
He is employed in aggravating
his own evils; while he neglects all his
own comforts.—What is it to you, though
others are supposed to be happier? Very
possibly they are not so; for wide is the
difference between being what the world
calls prosperous, and being happy. You
see no more than the imposing outside of
glittering fortune; while, under that gaudy
cover, there may be lurking many a bitter
sorrow.—But supposing others to be in
truth as happy as they seem to be, is there
any reason, except mere viciousness of dis∣position,
why their happiness should be a
<PB N="161" REF="172"/>
cause of your discontent and misery? Cannot
you be at your ease in the shade, because
others are basking in the sun? What is this
but the unhappy art of extracting from
objects that ought to be indifferent to you,
materials for your own torment?</P>
<P>“Such reasonings as these,” says one,
may be specious and plausible; but what
avail reasonings to set me at ease, who
every day feel myself hurt and sore from
the scorn of those above me; who am
condemned to behold them shining in all
the pomp and splendour of life; while I,
through the injustice of the world, am
left in obscurity of toil for a seanty sub∣sistence?”
—Accuse not the world, my
brother. Imagine not, that it is entirely
the injustice of the world which produces
your unhappiness. The discase lies within
yourself. It originates from your pride
and self-conceit, joined with the false opi∣nions
you have allowed yourself to enter∣tain
of the distinctions of fortune. Those
distinctions must take place in every estab∣lished
society. There must be inequality
<PB N="162" REF="173"/>
of ranks; and of course a diversity of
outward appearance among men. But it
is in the outward appearance that the diver∣sity
lies, far more than in what is intrinsic
to happiness and well-being.—You <HI>dwell
among your own people.</HI> In that rank where
Providence had placed you, you are living
among your friends and equals; and pur∣suing
that train of life to which you have
been bred. But you are eager and restless,
till from this quiety obscurity you can rise
to some higher elevation, to which you
fancy yourself entitled.—Are you aware of
the dangers and troubles that would await
you there? Supposing you to be in some
degree successful, yet, with your new rank
of life would not new burdens begin to
oppress you, and new and unknown cares
to vex you? How many rivals would you
have to encounter? how many slanderers to
decry you? how many enemies to combine
in opposing you? What mortification would
you endure on every disappointment you
met with? and on every small step of ad∣vancement,
what envy would still remain
<PB N="163" REF="174"/>
in looking up to those who continued above
you? till at last, tired with the vexations of
competition, you should be forced to regret
the day when discontent drove you away
from <HI>dwelling among your own people.</HI>—
Awake then, in time, from the dreams of
ambition and vanity. Instead of aspiring
beyond your proper level, bring down your
mind to your state; lest, by aiming too
high, you spend your life in a train of
fruitless pursuits, and bring yourself at last
to a state of entire insignificance and con∣tempt.</P>
<P>Let it be farther considered, in order to
show the folly of a discontented temper,
that the more it is indulged, it disqualifies
you the more from being freed from the
grounds of your discontent. First, you
have reason to apprehend that it will turn
the displeasure of God against you, and
make him your enemy. For what have
you to expect from that Providence towards
which you are so sullen and unthankful;
from that God, whose perfections you in∣jure
by your repining and accusing
<PB N="164" REF="175"/>
thoughts? How much is it in his power to
render you ten times more unhappy than
you are at present, by taking away those
remaining comforts, which, by your con∣tempt
of them, you show yourself unworthy
to enjoy?—Next, by your spleen and
discontent, you are certain of bringing your∣self
into variance with the world as well as
with God. Such a temper is likely to
create enemies; it can procure you no
friends. Proud, jealous, and dissatisfied
with those around you, you will, in return,
be avoided, disliked, and looked upon by
them with an evil eye; the discouragements
from the world, of which you complain,
will daily increase; while the humble, the
cheerful, and contented, will, on every oc∣casion,
get before you, and attract the good∣will
of all who can assist them.</P>
<P>SUCH being the mischiefs, such the guilt
and the folly of indulging a discontented
spirit, I shall now suggest some considera∣tions
which may assist us in checking it, and
in reconciling our minds to the state in
<PB N="165" REF="176"/>
which it has pleased Providence to place us.
Let us, for this purpose, attend to three great
objects; to God, to ourselves, and to the
world around us.</P>
<P>First, Let us speak of God, of his per∣fections,
and government of the world;
from which, to every person of reflection
who believes in God at all, there cannot
but arise some cure to the discontents and
griefs of the heart. For had it been left to
ourselves what to devise or wish, in order
to secure peace to us in every state, what
could we have invented so effectual as the
assurance of being under the government of
an Almighty Ruler, whose conduct to his
creatures can have no other object but their
good and welfare?—Above all, and inde∣pendent
of all, He can have no temptation
to injustice or partiality. Neither jealousy
nor envy can dwell with the Supreme
Being. He is a rival to none, he is an
enemy to none, except to such as, by re∣bellion
against his laws, seek enmity with
him. He is equally above envying the
<PB N="166" REF="177"/>
greatest, or despising the meanest, of his
subjects.—His dispensations, it is true, are
often dark and unaccountable to us; but
we know the reason of this to be, that we
see only a part of them, and are not yet
able to comprehend the whole. This we well
know, that we ourselves are often the very
worst judges of what is good or ill for us
in this life. We grasp at the present, with∣out
due regard to consequence<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and whe∣ther
these consequences are to carry the
advantages we had promised ourselves, or
be pregnant with future evils, is what we
cannot foresee. Experience has taught us
a thousand times, that God judges better
for us, than we judge for ourselves. Often
have we seen that what we considered at the
time as a sore disappointment, has proved
in the issue to be a merciful providence;
and that, if what we once eagerly wished
for had been obtained, it would have been
so far from making us happy, that it would
have produced our r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in.—The reflexion
of Solomon. <HI>who know<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th what is good for
man in this life, all the days of his vain life,
<PB N="167" REF="178"/>
which he spendeth as a shadow</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. vi. 12.</NOTE>? should often
occur to every one who is given to discon∣tent.
Placed as we are, in the midst of so
much ignorance with respect to the means
of happiness, and at the same time under
the government of a wise and gracious<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Being, who alone is able to effect our hap∣piness,
acquiescence in his disposal of our
lot, is the only disposition that becomes us
as rational creatures. To fret and repine
at every disappointment of our wishes, is
to discover the temper of froward children,
not of men, far less of christians. Chris∣tians,
amidst all their grievances, have ever
these promises to comfort them; that if they
<HI>cast their care<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon God, he will care for them;</HI>
that out of evil, he bringeth forth good;
nay, that at last <HI>he shall make all things
work together for good to them who love
him.</HI></P>
<P>IN the second place, in order to correct
discontent, let us attend to ourselves and our
<PB N="168" REF="179"/>
own state. Let us consider two things
there; how little we deserve, and how much
we enjoy. As to deserving, in the sight of
God, the Great Disposer of our lot, we
know that we have no claim. We are all
sinners; who are so far from having a title
to challenge favours as our due, that we
must acknowledge it to be of God's mercies
that we are not consumed. As to deserving
from the world, we are apt indeed some∣times
to make high and unreasonable pre∣tensions;
yet, surely, very conceited we
must be, if we be not disposed to admit,
that there are many of at least equal merit
with us, whose condition in the world is
no better, perhaps much worse than ours;
who yet make no complaints, whose dis∣contents
are not heard. How much splen∣did
genius is buried in forgotten neglect
and obscurity? How much real worth and
merit is driven forth to suffer all the hard∣ships
of a stormy life, while we <HI>dwell among
our own people?</HI>—Look into your state,
my brethren, and, before you give vent to
peevishness, make a fair and just estimate
<PB N="169" REF="180"/>
of all the blessings you enjoy, in comparison
with others. You would willingly, I know,
exchange your condition, in part, with
many. You would gladly have the wealth
of this man; you would have the high re∣putation
and honour of another; the health
perhaps, and firm vigour of a third. But
I ask, Who is there with whom you would
wish to make a total exchange? to forego
altogether your present self; and to be just
what he is, in mind, and in body, as well
as in outward estate? If this be an exchange,
which few, I apprehend, are willing to
make, does not this argue, that each man,
on the whole, is sufficiently pleased with
himself; that there are, in every situation,
certain comforts, and certain grounds of
self-complacency and satisfaction, which
ought in reason to be employed as remedies
against discontent?</P>
<P>IN the last place, consider the state of the
world around you.—You are not happy.
You <HI>dwell,</HI> you admit, <HI>among your own
people.</HI> But there, say you, “How many
<PB N="170" REF="181"/>
vexations do I occasionally experience?
Sometimes distressed for want of health;
sometimes disappointed in my plans, and
straitened in my circumstances; at other
times, afflicted with domestic troubles:
so that I am far from being as I would
wish to be.”—Pray, my brother, who
is there that lives in every respect just as he
would wish to live? First, find out such
a person; look through all conditions and
ranks, and try if you can discover one who
will tell you that he has no complaint or
uneasiness whatever, before you allow your∣self
to repine at your present situation.
Do you presume to indulge discontent,
merely because you are included in the
common lot; because you are not exempted
from bearing your share of the common
burden? What is human life to all, but a
mixture of some scattered joys and plea∣sures,
with various cares and troubles?</P>
<P>You have, perhaps, set your heart on
some one thing, which, if you could attain
it, you insist, would put an end to all your
complaints, and give you full contentment.
<PB N="171" REF="182"/>
—Vain man! will no experience teach you
wisdom? Have not you had the same opi∣nion
before this, of some other object of
your desire; and did you not find that you
was deceived in the enjoyment? Will you
not then at last be persuaded that <HI>all which
cometh,</HI> like all that is past, <HI>is vanity?</HI>—
Vanity, believe it, is the indelible character
imprinted on all human things. As far as
happiness is to be found on earth, you must
look for it, not in the world or the things
of the world, but within yourselves, in
your temper, and your heart. Let the
world change into one form or another as
it will, it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l be a vain world to the end;
and you, to the end, will be discontented.
It cannot give you what you seek. <HI>The
sea saith, it is not in me; and the earth saith,
it is not in me. Silver and gold are to no
purpose weighed for the price of it.</HI> The
decree of the Almighty hath past, and can∣not
be reversed, that man should find his
true contentment, under every condition,
only in a good conscience and a well re∣gulated
mind, in a holy life, and the hope
<PB N="172" REF="183"/>
of Heaven.—You call yourself a christ∣ian.
Does not that name import that you
consider yourself as a pilgrim and a passen∣ger
on earth; related in your expectations
and hopes to a better world? Are you not
ashamed to betray, by your discontent, a
spirit so inconsistent with such hopes and
expectations, and at the time when you
prosess to be looking towards the end of
your journey, to show so much uneasiness
about all the little circumstances of accom∣modation
by the way?—Live by faith,
my brethren, and you will live above this
world and its discouragements. Dwell with
God, and with things divine and immortal,
and you shall dwell with true wisdom.
You will find nothing so great in worldly
events, as either to clate or deject you.
Resting upon a principle superiour to the
world, you will possess your spirits in peace,
and will learn that great lesson of heavenly
philosophy, <HI>in whatever state you are, there∣with
to be content.</HI></P>

<P>IN this psalm the pious author describes
himself as suffering a great conflict within
his mind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VIII.</NOTE> His observation of the course
of Providence, did not present to him such
an order of things as was to have been
expected from the justice and goodness of
Heaven. The wicked appeared flourishing
and triumphant, while the worthy were
destitute and oppressed; and much disorder
<PB N="174" REF="185"/>
and darkness seemed to prevail in the course
of human affairs. Hence his mind fluctuated
for a while amidst doubts and fears. His
trust in the divine administration was even
so far shaken as to create a suspicion, that
in <HI>vain he had cleansed his heart, and washed
his hands in innocency:</HI> till at last he <HI>went

bad men appear to enjoy; and the happy
issue of all things at the last to the pious
and good. He saw the divine presence
ever surrounding them, and though with
invisible guidance, yet with unerring hand,
bringing them, in the end, to glory. His
mind returned to tranquillity; and, struck
with compunction for his past errors, he
rose into those high and memorable ex∣pressions

<P>To <HI>draw near to God,</HI> is an expression of
awful and mysterious import; in explain∣ing
which, we have much reason to be
sober and modest, and to guard with care
against every enthusiastic excess; remem∣bering
always, that rise as high as we can,
an immeasurable and infinite distance must
ever remain between us and the Supreme
Being. There are two senses in which
we may be said to <HI>draw near,</HI> in such a de∣gree
as mortality admits, <HI>to God:</HI> either by
<PB N="176" REF="187"/>
the general course of a pious and virtuous
life; or in solemn acts of immediate de∣votion.</P>
<P>I. By the practice of holiness and virtue
throughout the general tenor of life, we
may be said to <HI>draw near to God;</HI> for it is
such an approach as we can make to
the resemblance of his moral perfections.
After the image of God, man was created.
That image was defaced by our sin and
apostacy. By a return to God and our
duty, that image, through the intervention
of our Saviour, is renewed upon the soul;
man is said to be regenerated or born
again, and is in some degree restored to
that connexion with God which blessed
his primaeval state. He who lives in the
exercise of good affections, and in the re∣gular
discharge of the offices of virtue and
piety, maintains, as far as his infirmity al∣lows,
conformity with the nature of that per∣fect
Being, whose benevolence, whose purity
and rectitude, are conspicuous, both in his
works and his ways.—Worldly and corrupt
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>
men, on the contrary, estrange themselves
from all that is divine. They degrade
their nature by unworthy pursuits, and
are perpetually sinking in the scale of being.
By sensuality, they descend to the rank
of the brute creation; by malignity, envy,
and other bad passions, they connect them∣selves
with devils and infernal spirits.
Hence they are said in Scripture, to be
<HI>alienated from the life of God;</HI> to be <HI>without
God in the world.</HI> Though in one sense,
God is ever near them, as he surrounds
and encompasses them on all hands; yet,
in a spiritual sense, they are farther removed
from him than any distance of place can
separate bodies from one another.—
Whereas a virtuous man, whose pleasure
it is to do good, and his study to preserve
himself upright and pure, is in the course
of constant approach towards celestial na∣ture.
He is the lover of order, the fol∣lower
of that righteousness of which God
is the author and inspirer. He accords
with the great laws of the universe, and
seconds the designs of its Almighty Go∣vernour.
<PB N="178" REF="189"/>
He is, if we may so speak, in
unison with God. Hence piety and virtue
are described in Scripture as friendship with
God, as introducing us into his family,
and rendering us <HI>members of his household.</HI>
Strong expressions are used on this subject
by the sacred writers. A good man is said
<HI>to dwell in God, and God in him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> John, iii. 24.—iv. 13.</NOTE>. <HI>If a man
love me,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>he will keep my
words; and my Father will love him; and
we will come, and make our abode with him</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John, xiv. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These high and magnificent views of re∣ligion,
as an approach to God, may easily
satisfy us how much it must be <HI>good for us
to draw near to God,</HI> in this sense of the ex∣pression.
It is visibly the honour and dig∣nity
of man to resemble his Creator; and
surely his chief happiness will be ever found
to lie, where his highest dignity and honour
are found. <HI>With God is the fountain of life.</HI>
With him reside complete beatitude and per∣fection;
and from him are derived all the
<PB N="179" REF="190"/>
portions of happiness and comfort, which are
any where to be found among the creatures
he has made. In exact proportion, there∣fore,
as they approach to, or deviate from
him, must the happiness or misery of all
rational creatures be. As light and heat
flow from the sun as their centre, so bliss
and joy flow from the Deity; and as with
our distance from that glorious luminary,
darkness and cold increase; so, according as
by alienation of nature we are removed
from God, ruin and misery advance in the
same degree upon the soul.</P>
<P>Now consider, my brethren, that there is
one or other course which you must pursue.
If it be not your study to <HI>draw near to God</HI>
by a religious and virtuous life, be assured
that you are departing from him; for there
is no middle course between sin and right∣eousness;
and let every thinking being
seriously reflect what is included in this
state of being far from God, and cut off
from every kindly influence that descends
from heaven. With shadows of pleasure,
persons in this unhappy situation may be
<PB N="180" REF="191"/>
surrounded and amused; but shadows only,
and not realities, they must be, as long as
men have no connection with Him who is
the origin of all good. Can the stream
continue to flow when it is cut off from the
fountain? Can the branch flourish when
torn away from the stock which gave it nou∣rishment?
No more can dependent spirits
be happy, when parted from all union with
the Father of Spirits and the Fountain of
Happiness.</P>
<P>A good man, who is always endeavouring
to draw near to God, lives under the smiles
of the Almighty. He knows that he is
under the protection of that God towards
whom he aspires. He can look up to him
with pleasing hope; and trust that he shall
receive illumination and aid in his progress
to perfection. His virtues may as yet be
imperfect, and attended with many failings;
but his approach towards God is begun.
The steps by which he draws near to him
may be slow; but that progress is com∣menced,
which in a future state shall be
more successfully carried on, and which
<PB N="181" REF="192"/>
shall continue to advance through all eter∣nity.
<HI>They go on,</HI> says the Psalmist, <HI>from
strength to strength; every one of them ap∣peareth
before God in Zion.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. lxxxiv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 7.</NOTE>. Hence, by a
very beautiful and instructive metaphor, the
<HI>path of the just,</HI> is described in Scripture to be
<HI>as the shining light, that shineth more and
more unto the perfect day</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. iv. 18.</NOTE>. It is the dawn
of a glorious morning, which increases by
degrees to meridian splendour; and as the
morning dawn, though dim and feeble, is
nevertheless a ray of the same light which
forms the brightness of noon-day, we are
hereby taught to conceive, that the piety and
virtue of good men now, is a degree of ce∣lestial
nature already imparted to their souls,
and differs from its perfection in a higher
world, only as the twilight is inferiour to
noon. The path of the wicked man, is
directly the reverse of all this. Degraded
by his vices, he is constantly declining more
and more in a downward course. His path,
instead of being as the shining light, is the
<PB N="182" REF="193"/>
dusk of evening begun: that darkness of the
infer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l regions to which his nature is tend∣ing,
increases upon him gradually, till the
shadows of night close upon his head at last,
with endless and impenetrable gloom.—
Thus fully is verified what the Psalmist had
asserted in the verse preceding the text, <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they that are far from thee shall perish;</HI> while
his own fixed sentiment he immediately de∣clares—
<HI>but it is good for me to draw near to
God.</HI>—I proceed</P>
<P>II. To consider the other sense in which
we may be said to draw near to God; that
is, in acts of immediate devotion.</P>
<P>There are two ways by which these con∣tribute
to bring us near to God. The first
is, by their strengthening in the soul that
power of vital godliness and virtue, in which
consists our chief resemblance to God: for
it is never to be forgotten that all our devo∣tional
exercises are subservient to this great
end. Herein consists their, whole virtue
and efficacy, that they purify and improve
the soul, raise it above low passions, and
<PB N="183" REF="194"/>
thereby promote the elevation of the human
nature towards the divine. When they are
considered merely a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> external services which
we are obliged to perform, but to which we
address ourselves with cold and backward
hearts; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when the glow of affection which
they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is merely moment<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y and soon
forgotten, they cannot be held to have any
influence in bringing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> near to God. It is
only when they are the service of the heart,
when they are the genuine voice of the soul
to God, when they serve to kindle those
sacred aspirations which continue to breathe
throughout the rest of life, that they assist
us in using towards heaven, and alliance
with God.</P>
<P>When our acts of devotion are of this
nature, they form the other sense in which
the words of the text are to be understood.
We therein <HI>draw near to God,</HI> as we enter
into the most immediate intercourse with
him, which the nature of our state admits.
In one sense, we cannot be said to be nearer
to God at any one time than another; as at
all times his presence equally surrounds us;
<PB N="184" REF="195"/>
in the fields, as in the temple; in the midst
of the world, as much as in the retirement
of the closet. But when with serious and
devout affections we address ourselves to
God, in prayer, and praise, and solemn wor∣ship,
we then bring home that divine pre∣sence
to our feelings, and formally place
ourselves in it. We may then be truly said
to <HI>draw near to God;</HI> approaching to him
through a great Mediator and Intercessor;
sending up those prayers to which we are
encouraged to believe that the Almighty is
lending a gracious ear; resigning ourselves
to his conduct, and offering up our souls to
him; exercising, in short, all those acts of
faith, love, and trust, which become de∣pendent
creatures towards their Sovereign
and Father.</P>
<P>This intellectual correspondence of the
heart with our Maker and Redeemer, is
termed, in the language of divines, com∣munion
with God. And, if there be truth
in religion at all; if a Supreme Being exist,
who is in any degree accessible to his
creatures, and who is gracious to the good,
<PB N="185" REF="196"/>
it must be admitted to have a foundation
in reason and truth. There must be just
ground to think, that the worship of pure
and holy hearts is acceptable to him; and
the gospel gives us full reason to believe,
that the energy of his spirit is concerned in
stirring up within them the sentiments of
devotion.</P>
<P>At the same time it is incumbent on me
to warn you, that the satisfaction which on
such occasions we feel, must not be grounded
merely on a belief which we allow our∣selves
to entertain, of some communication
which we had received directly from God.
In the warn, and transporting moments of
devotion, there is always a hazard of our
mistaking the exalted efforts of our own
imagination, for supernatural impressions
from Heaven. It is much safer to judge
of the acceptance of our services, by an in∣ference
which we can warrantably draw
from the state of our hearts and life, com∣pared
to God's written word. <HI>To the law
and the testimony</HI> we must always have re∣course
in judging of our state; and then
<PB N="186" REF="197"/>
only the <HI>testimony of God's spirit witnesseth
with our spirits</HI> that we are the children of
God, when we can discern in ourselves
those declared <HI>fruits of the Spirit,</HI> which are
<HI>love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galat. v. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Carrying along with us this caution, it
will be found that, on many accounts, it
will be <HI>good for us, to draw near to God</HI>
in exercises of solemn devotion.</P>
<P>First, it is evidently <HI>good for us,</HI> to dis∣charge
those duties of worship, and to give
proof of those pious affections, which are
unquestionably due from us to our Heaven∣ly
Father. If we be wanting in these, we
are clearly deficient in one essential part of
religion. Morality without piety, consti∣tutes
a very imperfect character. It is
neither stable in its foundation, nor uni∣versal
in its influence; and gives us no
ground to look for the rewards of those,
whose <HI>prayers, together with their alms, come
up in memorial before God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="198"/>
But, besides the obligations from duty
which we are laid under to such religious ex∣ercises,
it can clearly be shewn that they are
in themselves good for us, on account of the
improvement, the satisfaction, and comfort,
they enable us to enjoy, in a devout elevation
of the heart towards God and celestial objects.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the languor that
attends the ordinary circulation of the little
occupations of life; on the insipidity of
many of its amusements; and the depres∣sion
of spirits that follows after them; we
cannot but be sensible that occasional inter∣course
with God and divine things, must
furnish a comfortable relief to the mind.
It is not, indeed, an intercourse for which we
are at all times equal; but neither was the
human mind formed to grovel at all times
among low cares and objects. It has a
demand for something higher and greater,
than what the common round of the world
affords. Hence the extravagant and eccen∣tric
pursuits into which we sometimes deviate.
We attempt some higher bliss, than what we
find here. But the attempt which is made
<PB N="188" REF="199"/>
by folly, can only be successfully executed by
a wise and good man, in the elevation of his
soul towards God. Some, indeed, are sunk
so low in worldly gratifications, that no∣thing
has any relish with them, but what
either breathes the air of giddy dissipation, or
tastes of the impure stream of sensual plea∣sure.
But this vitiated taste, contracted
by long corrupt habits, is unnatural in
itself, and by proper discipline can be cor∣rected
and reformed. Let the mind be
restored to its sound and natural state, and
its relish for what is more great and noble,
will return.</P>
<P>Besides the imperfection and emptiness of
the ordinary pleasures of the world, many
pains and distresses are always mingled with
them. No more effectual relief from them can
be found, than that which may be enjoyed in
drawing near to God. Passions corrode the
mind. Cares and anxieties fester in it. We
are fretted by the ingratitude of friends;
soured by the calumnies of enemies;
harassed with the competition of rivals.
The very bustle and agitation of the world,
<PB N="189" REF="200"/>
wear out and oppress the mind that longs
for tranquillity. In religious retirement,
and in those exercises of devotion that
bring us near to God, we attain a pleasing
region of calm and repose. There, worldly
passions are silent; worldly cares are hushed
and forgotten. The mind retires as within
itself; and remains alone with God. It
is only as afar off that the noise and disturb∣ance
of the world is heard, like the found
of a distant tumult.</P>
<P>By the perplexity of our worldly concerns,
we may have been involved in trouble. By
the death of our dearest friends, we may
have been overwhelmed with sorrow. By
the situation of public affairs, we may be
alarmed with dangers that threaten our
country. In all such situations, is there
any consolation equal to that which the
devout man enjoys in drawing near to
God? He looks up to a Father and a
Friend, in whom he can place his trust in
every time of need. He hears a voice issuing
from the divine sanctuary, which says,
<HI>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will
<PB N="190" REF="201"/>
deliver thee. Fear not, for I am with thee;
be not dismayed, for I am thy God.</HI> Com∣forted
by such words, his mind regains
tranquillity. Resting on the hope that the
God whom he serves will never forsake
him, he can dismiss from his thoughts
the fears, the troubles, and wickedness of
men, and compose his spirit to dwell among
celestial things. Looking up to that blessed
world where he expects to find his repose,
he beholds no objects but what he can con∣template
with delight, as great, peaceful,
and serene. There, he beholds none of the
agitations and turmoils of men; no tumults,
nor factions, nor wars; no friends, who
die and leave us; no ambitious men, who
aspire to oppress; nor violent men, who
attempt to destroy; nor fraudulent brethren,
who, with a smiling countenance, cheat
and deceive. In perfect contrast to the
confusion of the earth, he beholds all things
above, proceeding in the same perfect order
with the heavenly bodies, which move in
their orbs with smooth and steady course.
He sees the river of life flowing continually
<PB N="191" REF="202"/>
from before the throne of God; and dif∣fusing
among the blessed inhabitants, <HI>fulness
of joy, and pleasures for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>From such devout contemplations and
hopes, arose that great delight which holy
men of antient times describe themselves
to have felt in drawing near to God, and
which they have expressed in language so
vivid and glowing. <HI>Blessed, O Lord, is the
man whom thou choosest, and caus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st to ap∣proach
unto thee; that he may dwell in thy
courts, and be satisfied with the goodness of
thy house, and of thy holy place.—O God,
thou art my God, early will I seek thee. Be∣cause
thy loving kindness is better than life,
my lips shall praise thee. I will lift up my
hands in thy name. My soul shall be satisfied
as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth
shall praise thee with joyful lips, when I re∣member
thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee
in the night watches. Whom have I in hea∣ven,
but thee? and there is none upon earth
that I desire, besides thee</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. lxiii. 3.—6. Ps. lxv. 4. Ps. lxxiii. 25.</NOTE>. When such
<PB N="192" REF="203"/>
language as this expresses the native senti∣ments
of our hears, we join ourselves in
some measure to the angelical choir above,
and anticipate the employments of the
blessed.</P>
<P>Some may perhaps imagine, that what
has been said of the importance and the ad∣vantages
of <HI>drawing near to God,</HI> approaches,
in some degree, to mysticism and enthu∣siasm.
I admit, that if religion were repre∣sented
as consisting wholly of internal devout
emotions, the representation of it would be
imperfect and false. It is designed to be
an active principle, regulating the conduct
of life, and exerting itself in good works. But
very ignorant he must be of human nature,
who perceives not, that in order to pro∣duce
such effects, it is of high importance
to engage the affections and the heart on
the side of virtue. It is not by reasonings
addressed solely to the understanding, that
men's characters are formed, or their
general conduct actuated. If you wish to
work any considerable effect on their life,
<PB N="193" REF="204"/>
you must bring over the affections and
inclinations to your side. You must not
only shew them what is right and true, but
make them feel what is desirable and good.
If you attempt to make religion so very
calm and rational, as to exclude from it all
warmth of sentiment, all affectionate and
devotional feelings, you will leave it in pos∣session
of small influence on conduct. <HI>My
son, give me thy heart,</HI> is the voice of God;
and the voice of reason is, that according
as the heart is affected and disposed, such
will be the general character and conduct.</P>
<P>The application of the whole subject to
the holy sacrament which we are now to
celebrate, is natural and obvious. No more
solemn opportunity can be afforded us of
drawing near to God, than what we there
enjoy. All that is encouraging and com∣forting
in Christian faith is set before us,
in this most effectual proof of God's mercy
to mankind, giving up his son to the death
as a sacrifice for our sins. In celebrating
the memorial of this great event, we are
<PB N="194" REF="205"/>
placed as under the immediate brightness
of heavenly light, and under the warmest
ray of divine love. If there be <HI>any consola∣tion
in Christ, any fellowship of the Spirit,</HI>
any pleasing hope of eternal life and joy, it
ought on such an occasion to be drawn forth,
and deeply felt. Let us endeavour to kindle,
at the altar of the Lord, that sacred fire,
which shall continue to diffuse its vivifying
influence over our hearts, when we go
abroad into the world, and mingle again in
the ordinary concerns of life. We are now
to <HI>draw near to God.</HI> Let us draw near
to him as our Father; but with that reve∣rence
and humility which becomes us on
approaching to a Father <HI>who is in Heaven.</HI>
Let us draw near through that great Media∣tor,
by whose merits and intercession alone
our services find acceptance at the divine
throne. <HI>No man cometh unto the Father but
through him; and none who cometh unto God
by him, will be cast out.</HI></P>

<P><HI>WISDOM,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IX.</NOTE> says Solomon, <HI>excelleth folly, as
far as light excelleth darkness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. ii. 13.</NOTE>. In our
present state, there is no situation in which
we can, consistently with safety to ourselves,
act thoughtlessly and at random. In what∣ever
enterprise we engage, consideration and
prudent thought are requisite to bring it to
a good issue. On every occasion, there is a
right and a wrong in conduct; there is one
line of action which is likely to terminate
<PB N="196" REF="207"/>
according as we wish; and another which,
for certain, will land us in disappointment.
If, in the ordinary transactions of life, we
cannot prosper without a due exercise of
wisdom and prudence, a higher degree of it
is certainly necessary in those momentous
parts of conduct which regard our everlast∣ing
welfare.</P>
<P>It is indeed confessed, that in religious
conduct the fundamental and most im∣portant
article is sincerity of heart, and
goodness of intention. At the same time,
let the intentions be ever so pure and sin∣cere,
they will be in hazard of falling into
some wrong direction, unless they be pro∣perly
guided by wisdom. Too many in∣stances
have appeared, of persons, who, setting
out in life with fair and virtuous purposes,
have been so far bewildered by mistaken
forms of goodness, as to be betrayed, first
into errors, and then into vices and crimes.
In order to act our parts with propriety and
steadiness, there must be a due proportion
of light in the understanding, as well as of
warmth and goodness in the heart. The
<PB N="197" REF="208"/>
Psalmist was sensible of this when he de∣clares
in the text his resolution, of not only
<HI>walking in a perfect,</HI> or upright, <HI>way,</HI> but
of <HI>behaving himself wisely</HI> in that perfect
way. Of the wisdom or prudence which
is necessary to guide and support virtue, I
purpose to treat in this discourse. I shall
adventure, with great plainness and simpli∣city
of language, to propose some practical
rules and directions for that purpose; which
may be of service to persons, who, with
good dispositions and intentions, are begin∣ning
the career of life; and which may, per∣haps,
deserve attention from persons in every
period of age.—I begin by observing,</P>
<P>I. That it is most necessary to lay down
principles on which we are to form our
general conduct. If we set out without
principles of any kind, there can be no re∣gular
plan of life, nor any firmness in con∣duct.
No person can know where they
are to find us; nor on what behaviour of
ours they are to depend. If the principles
which we pitch upon for determining our
<PB N="198" REF="209"/>
course, be of a variable nature; such, for
instance, as popular opinion, reputation, or
worldly interest; as these are often shifting
and changing, they can impart no steadi∣ness
or consistency to conduct. Other
principles there are, which some affect to
adopt, founded on a sense of honour, on
the beauty and excellency of virtue, and
the dignity of human nature. But, how∣ever
fair these may be in appearance, they
will be found ineffectual in many trying
situations; unable to repress the violence of
contending passions, or to support the heart
under many discouragements and sorrows.</P>
<P>The only sure principles we can lay
down for regulating our conduct, must
be founded on the Christian religion,
taken in its whole compass; not confined
to the exercises of devotion, nor to the
mere morality of social behaviour; but ex∣tending
to the whole direction of our con∣duct
towards God and towards man. The
foundation is to be laid in faith in Christ
as the Saviour of the world, through whose
merits only we can look for final accept∣ance
<PB N="199" REF="210"/>
with God. We must evince the
sincerity of our faith by good works; that
is, by a faithful discharge of all the duties
incumbent upon us in our several stations
of life: continually looking up to divine
grace for assistance in the part assigned
us to act; and trusting to that recompence
of our present labours, which is promised to
the virtuous in a future and better world.—Supposing,
that having laid the found∣ation
in such principles, we set forth to act
a worthy and virtuous part; resolved, that
whatever may befal us, <HI>till we die, we will
not remove our integrity from us; that our
hearts shall not reproach us so long as we
live</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job, xxvii. 5, 6.</NOTE>. I proceed to advise,</P>
<P>II. That we begin with reforming what∣ever
has been wrong in our former be∣haviour.
This counsel is the more im∣portant,
because too many, in their endea∣vours
towards reformation, begin with
attempting some of the highest virtues, or
<PB N="200" REF="211"/>
aspiring to the most sublime performances
of devotion, while they suffer their former
accustomed evil habits to remain just as
they were. This, I apprehend, is begin∣ning
at the wrong end. We must first,
as the prophet has exhorted, <HI>put away the
evil of our doings from before God's eyes;</HI> we
must <HI>cease to do evil, before we learn to do
well</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah, i. 16.</NOTE>. All attempts at reformation of
manners are vain, where this is not studied.
Let us remember, that as long as the weeds
and tares are allowed to remain in the
ground, the soil is vitiated by their roots
spreading deep and wide; and no good
grain will have room to spring up.—Every
man who inspects his own character,
may learn that there are certain failings,
to which, from constitution, circumstances,
or long habit, he is prone; termed in
Scripture the <HI>sins that most easily beset us.</HI>
To discover these, must be his first care; and
his first purpose, if he in truth wishes to be∣come
a good man, must be gradually to check,
<PB N="201" REF="212"/>
and finally to extirpate them, of whatever na∣ture
they are; whether, perhaps, habits of
intemperance, unlawful indulgences of plea∣sure,
indirect methods of acquiring gain,
or propensions to malice, resentment, or
envy. To overcome those evils when they
have become inveterate, to pluck up those
thorns by the roots, is perhaps the most
difficult part of reformation, and therefore
what we are generally the most backward
to undertake. At the same time it is cer∣tain,
that as long as, by this tender indul∣gence
to favourite vices, men remain in a
divided state between good resolutions and
evil habits, they are so far from behaving
<HI>wisely in a perfect way,</HI> that they can
scarcely be accounted to have entered on
that <HI>perfect way;</HI> irresolution will be spread
over their conduct, and incoherence will
mark their character.—In order to facilitate
so necessary a step in the progress towards
virtue, let me advise you,</P>
<P>III. To shut up, as much as possible,
the avenues which lead to the return of
<PB N="202" REF="213"/>
former evil habits. Here is required that
exercise of vigilance, self-distrust, and self-denial,
which is so often recommended to us
in scripture. There is always some one
side on which each of us is more vulnerable
than on another. There are places, there
are times, there are circumstances, which
every man who knows any thing of himself
at all, must know will prove the occasions
of calling forth his latent frailties, and
bringing him into some fatal snare. Then
ought that caution of the apostle to
sound in his ears; <HI>Let him that thinketh
be standeth, take heed lest he fall</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Corinth. x. 12.</NOTE>. Let
him not only <HI>walk circumspectly,</HI> but rather
altogether fly the dangerous ground; aware
of the viper which lurks under the grass,
ready to sting. But presumption to flatter
ourselves, and to think that we are able
to withstand every danger, is a weakness
inherent in man. It is on a moderate
and humble estimation of our abilities,
that wisdom directs us to form our
<PB N="203" REF="214"/>
conduct. As in civil and political life, he
who believes himself equal to every task,
and on all occasions comes forward with
rash audacity, is likely to meet with many
a humiliation and repulse; so, in moral
behaviour, he who, trusting to the strength
of his virtuous resolutions, exposes himself
inconsiderately to every occasion of tempta∣tion,
is sure of being often betrayed into evil.</P>
<P>All the various and dangerous avenues to
vice, with which, in great cities especially,
modern life abounds, it cannot be expected
that I am here to point out. Wealth, lux∣ury,
and idleness, are the great nourishers of
every frailty; the great fomenters of every
bad inclination and passion. To the children
of Idleness, the haunts of Dissipation open
many a wide and inviting gate by night
and by day. When within those gates they
carelessly enter, surrounded with loose com∣panions,
how often does it happen, that
from the halls of pleasure and houses of
gaming, they come forth, as from caverns
of destruction, overwhelmed with losses and
miseries, and pining with bitter remorse?—
<PB N="204" REF="215"/>
Much does it concern every one who seeks
to <HI>walk wisely in a perfect way,</HI> to be parti∣cularly
guarded in the choice of his asso∣ciates
and companions. How often among
the gay and the giddy will he meet with
those who smile and betray! <HI>He only who
walketh with wise men, shall be wise: while
the companion of fools shall be destroyed.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiii. 20.</NOTE>. Ob∣serve
the attention which, in the verses im∣mediately
following the text, King David
declares himself to have given to this rule
of conduct; <HI>I will set no wicked thing before
mine eyes; I will not know a wicked person.
Mine eyes shall be on the faithful of the land.
He that worketh deceit, shall not dwell within
my house. He that telleth lies, shall not tarry
in my presence.</HI> Such was the wisdom that
assisted him to continue in a perfect way.—This
wisdom requires farther,</P>
<P>IV. THAT consistency and uniformity be
preserved in character; that not by pieces
and corners only we study goodness, but
that we carry one line of regular virtue
<PB N="205" REF="216"/>
through our whole conduct. Without this
extensive regulation of behaviour, we can
never hold on successfully in a perfect way.
Almost all men, even the loose and profli∣gate,
lay claim to some one virtue or other,
and value themselves on some good moral
disposition, which they boast of possessing.
It is in vain, therefore, that we rest our
character on one or a few estimable quali∣ties,
which we imagine ourselves to possess
in a high degree, while in other points of
virtue we are relaxed and deficient. True
virtue must form one complete and entire
system. All its parts are connected; piety
with morality, charity with justice, bene∣volence
with temperance and fortitude. If
any of these parts be wanting, the fabric
becomes disjointed; the adverse parts of
character correspond not to each other, nor
form into one whole. It is only when we
<HI>have respect unto all God's commandments,</HI> as
the Psalmist speaks, that we have reason <HI>not
to be ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>The apology for many of those breaches
of consistency is always at hand, that the
<PB N="206" REF="217"/>
transgression is small, and can easily be
repaired on a future occasion; and small
sins, we imagine, may be compensated by
great and distinguished virtues. But no
seduction is more dangerous, than this dis∣tinction
which men are so ready to make
between great and small sins. Nothing is
more difficult, than to draw the line of this
distinction with any warrantable precision.
Wherever inclination gives a strong bias to
any indulgence, we may be assured that we
shall be always misled in measuring the
quantity of guilt. No sin is to be ac∣counted
small, by which the dictate of con∣science
is counteracted, and its authority is
weakened and impaired. It may soon draw
consequences after it, which will affect our
whole conduct. Supposing the matter of
these transgressions to be ever so small in its
own nature, yet the moral characters of
men become stained and bloated by their
frequent accumulations; just as many small
ulcers, when allowed to form and spread,
will grow by degrees into a great disease.—At
the same time, when I thus advise
<PB N="207" REF="218"/>
you to study entire and consistent virtue,
and to guard strictly against small transgres∣sions,
let me warn you,</P>
<P>V. AGAINST unnecessary austerity, as
forming any part of religious wisdom. This
is the meaning of the precept of Solo∣mon,
<HI>Be not righteous overmuch; neither
make thyself over wise; why shouldst thou
destroy thyself</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. vii. 16.</NOTE>? Too strict and scrupulous,
indeed, we cannot be in our adherence to
what is matter of clear duty. Every dic∣tate
of conscience is to be held sacred, and
to be obeyed without reserve. But wis∣dom
requires that we study to have con∣science
properly enlightened with respect to
what really belongs to duty, or infers sin.
We must distinguish with care the everlast∣ing
commandments of God, from the super∣stitious
fancies and dictates of men. We
must never overload conscience with what
is frivolous and unnecessary, nor exhaust on
trifles, that zeal which ought to be reserved
<PB N="208" REF="219"/>
for the weightier matters of the law. In all
ages, it has been the great characteristic of
false pretenders to piety and religion, to
arrogate to themselves uncommon sanctity,
by affected strictness and severity of man∣ners;
paying tithes, like the Pharisees of
old, of mint, anise, and cummin, while
they overlook righteousness, judgment, and
mercy. That religion which is connected
with true wisdom, leads to a very different
spirit. It will teach us to be neither rigid
in trisles, nor relaxed in essentials; not to
aim at impracticable heights, nor to fall
below the standard of attainable duty;
never to make ostentation of our righteous∣ness,
nor to set ourselves up as patterns and
standards to others, but to be gentle and
unassuming; without harshness in our
manners, or severity in our censures, when
others depart in some particulars from our
mode of thinking on religious subjects.</P>
<P>At the same time, we are to remember
that, in order to avoid austerity, it by no
means follows that we should run into an
unlimited compliance with the manners of
<PB N="209" REF="220"/>
others around us. This is a danger to
which they are often exposed, whose tem∣pers
are mild, and whose manners are con∣descending.
In that mixed and various
intercourse, which the present state of
society forces upon us, few things, indeed,
are more difficult, than to ascertain the
precise degree of compliance with the world
which virtue allows. To preserve a just
medium between a formal austerity on the
one hand, and that weak and tame facility
on the other, which betrays men into many
vices, is one of the most important and
arduous exercises of religious wisdom. A
manly steadiness of conduct, is the object
which we are always to keep in view;
studying to unite gentleness of manners
with firmness of principle, affable beha∣viour
with untainted integrity.</P>
<P>VI. In order to walk wisely in a perfect
way, it is of importance that we study pro∣priety
in our actions and general behaviour.
There are few precise rules of conduct that
can be applied alike to all men. In some
<PB N="210" REF="221"/>
of the fundamental virtues, indeed, no cir∣cumstances
can admit the least variation.
There are no situations, for instance, in
which truth, justice, and humanity, are
not required equally from all. But, in a
great number of the duties of life, the
manner of discharging them must vary,
according to the different ages, charac∣ters,
and fortunes of men. To suit our
behaviour to each of these; to judge of
the conduct which is most decent and
becoming in our situation, is a material
part of wisdom. Without this attention
to propriety, virtue will lose much of
its grace and efficacy; nay, good dis∣positions
may degenerate into mere weak∣nesses
and follies. The behaviour, for
instance, which would be engaging in
youth, is unsuitable to advanced years.
What is innocent gaiety in the one, be∣comes
culpable levity in the other; and to
assume in youth that authority and dignity
to which years only give any title, is im∣pertinent
affectation. In like manner, to
the different ranks of men in society, there
<PB N="211" REF="222"/>
belongs a different strain of manners.
Whatever is either above or below that
line of life in which Providence has placed
us, hurts every impartial observer, and
suits not the propriety of virtue. What
is proper dignity in one station, may, in
another, be presumptuous arrogance; and
while suitable dependance belongs to
those of inferiour rank, it ought not to
sink into a degrading servility. With a
change in the situation of our fortunes,
our duties obviously change. What was
commendable frugality in one condition,
may become sordid parsimony as our estate
rises; and the generosity required of the
affluent, turns into extravagance and injus∣tice
when our circumstances are impaired.—In
all those attentions to propriety, some
regard will, of course, be had to the opi∣nions
which the world forms of us. No
man has a title to despise altogether what
the world thinks, and what it expects from
him. But this regard to the sentiments
of others, must never go so far as to en∣croach
on what a man's own conscience
<PB N="212" REF="223"/>
tells him, it is his duty either to do, or to
forbear doing. In the scale by which we
measure the propriety of our conduct, the
opinion of the world must never be the
preponderating weight.—Let me recom∣mend,</P>
<P>VII. THE observance of order and
regularity in the whole of conduct<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide on this subject, Vol. ii. Sermon I.</NOTE>.
This may, at first appearance, seem an ar∣ticle
of inferiour importance, and hardly de∣serving
to be ranked among moral duties.
But I am persuaded that it is more nearly
connected with virtue than many persons
imagine; and that it maintains an import∣ant
place in that wisdom which directs a
perfect way. If ever you mean to carry a
consistent line of virtue throughout your
conduct, you must allot to every transaction
its place and its season. Hurry and tumult,
disorder and confusion, are both the cha∣racteristics
of vice and the parents of it.
Let your time be regularly distributed, and
<PB N="213" REF="224"/>
all your affairs be arranged with propriety,
in method and train. Thus, and thus
only, can you be masters of yourselves;
your time and your life will be your own;
and what is serious and important, will not
be justled out of its place, by that crowd
of inferiour cares, which are for ever press∣ing
on the disorderly, and frustrating the
plans which they had formed for the wise
and proper regulation of life.—Consider
too, that if order be not studied, there can
be no prudent oeconomy in the manage∣ment
of your fortune and worldly affairs;
and oeconomy, be assured, is a great guar∣dian
of all the private and domestic virtues.
When order and oeconomy are neglected,
you are in hazard of being first involved
in distresses, and then inveigled into crimes;
whereas, under the direction of regular
conduct, both your worldly and your re∣ligious
concerns will be more in the course
of prospering.—I have now only to add,</P>
<P>VIII. THAT we should give attention
to all the auxiliary means which religion
<PB N="214" REF="225"/>
offers for assisting and guiding us to walk
wisely in a perfect way. These open a
large sield to the care of every good man.
We must always remember that virtue is
not a plant which will spontaneously grow
up and flourish in the human heart. The
soil is far from being so favourable to it;
many shoots of an adverse nature are ever
springing up, and much preparation and
culture are required for cherishing the
good seed, and raising it to full maturity.—
Among the means for this purpose, let me
first mention the serious reading of the holy
Scripture. That sacred book, as the stand∣ard
of our belief and practice, claims, on
every account, our frequent perusal. In
the New Testament, the brightest display
of our Lord's energetic example, joined
with his simple, affecting, and instructive
discourses, illustrated by the writings of
his inspired followers; in the Old Testa∣ment,
the variety of matter, the ardent
glow of devotion in some parts, and the
mysterious sublimity of others; all conspire
to affect the mind with serious and solemn
<PB N="215" REF="226"/>
emotions. Passages impressed on the me∣mory
from those sacred volumes, have often,
from their recurrence, had a happy effect.
In our early years, most of us were accus∣tomed
to look with respect upon those ve∣nerable
records; and woe be to them, who,
looking back upon the days of their father's
house, can trample with scorn on the me∣mory
of those, whose pious cares were em∣ployed
in forming them to good principles,
and teaching them to reverence the word
of God!—Let me next recommend a
serious regard to all the established means
of religious instruction; such as, attending
regularly the preaching of the word, par∣taking
frequently of the holy sacrament, and
preserving a sacred reverence for the Lord's
day. Whenever all regard to the Lord's
day becomes abolished; when on it we are
allowed to mingle without any distinction
in our common affairs, and even in our
ordinary diversions and amusements, we
may account this a certain symptom of
declining virtue, and of approaching ge∣neral
immorality. We have beheld in a
<PB N="216" REF="227"/>
neighbouring kingdom, how fatally it proved
the forerunner of an entire dissolution both
of moral and civil order in society. What∣ever
disregard certain modern refiners of
morality may attempt to throw on all the
instituted means of public religion, as∣suredly
they must, in their lowest view,
be considered as the outguards and fences
of virtuous conduct; and even in this view,
must deserve the esteem and respect of
all good men. We know, and are often
enough told, that the <HI>form of godliness</HI> may
subsist without the <HI>power</HI> of it. But de∣pend
upon it, wherever <HI>the form of godliness</HI>
is entirely gone, the ruin of its <HI>power</HI> is
not far off. Whoever has studied the
human mind may soon be satisfied of this
truth.</P>
<P>Besides attention to the public means
of religious improvement, much will de∣pend
on our own private exercises of devo∣tion
and serious thought. Prayer, in par∣ticular,
operates to our high advantage, both
by the immediate assistance which we may
hope it will procure from Him who is the
<PB N="217" REF="228"/>
authour and inspirer of virtue, and by its
native influence in softening, purifying, and
exalting the heart. In vain would he at∣tempt
to behave himself wisely in a perfect
way, who looks not frequently up to God
for grace and aid; and who would pre∣sumptuously
attempt to separate moral virtue
from devotion, its natural and original ally.
Besides the exercises of religious worship
both public and private, seasonable returns of
retirement from the world, of calm recol∣lection
and serious thought, are most im∣portant
auxiliaries to virtue. He who is
without intermission engaged in the bustle
of society and worldly occupation, becomes
incapable of exercising that discipline over
himself, and giving that attention to his
temper and character which virtue requires.
<HI>Commune with your own hearts on your
bed, and be still. Offer the sacrifices of
righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm iv. 4, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY the observance of such rules and
maxims as have been now pointed out, it may
<PB N="218" REF="229"/>
be hoped that, through divine grace, we may
be enabled to <HI>behave ourselves wisely in a
perfect way,</HI> until, in the end, we receive
the reward of such behaviour. The wis∣dom
here spoken of as conjoined with
virtue, is that <HI>wisdom from above,</HI> which
is appointed by God to enlighten and guide
the course of integrity. It opens to us
that <HI>path of the just,</HI> which is now as <HI>the
shining light,</HI> and which will <HI>shine more and
more until the perfect day.</HI></P>

<P>THIS passage presents to us in one view
the nature of our present earthly state,
and the future object of the Christian's hope.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. X.</NOTE>
The style is figurative; but the figures
employed are both obvious and expressive.
The body is represented as a house in∣habited
by the soul, or the thinking part
<PB N="220" REF="231"/>
of man. But it is an <HI>earthly house,</HI> a <HI>taber∣nacle</HI>
erected only for passing accommo∣dation,
and <HI>to be dissolved;</HI> to which is to
succeed the future dwelling of the just in
<HI>a building of God, an house not made with

are three great objects presented to our
consideration. First, the nature of our
present condition. Secondly, that succeed∣ing
state which is the object of good men's
hope. Thirdly, the certain foundation of
their hope; <HI>we know,</HI> that if our <HI>earthly
house be dissolved, we have a building of
God.</HI></P>
<P>I. THE text gives a full description of
our present embodied state; as an <HI>earthly
house,</HI> an <HI>earthly house of this tabernacle,</HI>
and a tabernacle which is to <HI>be dissolved.</HI></P>
<P>We dwell in an <HI>earthly house.</HI> Within
this cottage of earth is lodged that spiritual,
immortal substance into which God breathed
the breath of life. So we are elsewhere
said in Scripture, to have <HI>our foundation in
the dust,</HI> and to <HI>dwell in houses of clay.</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="232"/>
During its continuance in this humble
abode, the soul may be justly considered as
confined and imprisoned. It is restrained
from the full exertion of its powers by
many obstructions. It can perceive and act
only by very imperfect organs. It looks
abroad as through the windows of the
senses; and beholds truth as <HI>through a glass
darkly.</HI> It is beset with a numerous train
of temptations to evil, which arise from
bodily appetites. It is obliged to sympa∣thize
with the body in its wants; and is
depressed with infirmities not its own. For
it suffers from the frailty of those materials
of which its earthly house is compacted.
It languishes and droops, along with the
body; is wounded by its pains; and the
slightest discomposure of bodily organs is
sufficient to derange some of the highest
operations of the soul.</P>
<P>All these circumstances bear the marks
of a fallen and degraded state of human
nature. The mansion in which the soul is
lodged, corresponds so little with the powers
and capacities of a rational immortal spirit,
<PB N="222" REF="233"/>
as gives us reason to think that the souls of
good men were not designed to remain
always thus confined. Such a state was
calculated for answering the ends proposed
by our condition of trial and probation in
this life; but was not intended to be last∣ing
and final. Accordingly the Apostle, in
his description, calls it the earthly house <HI>of
this tabernacle;</HI> alluding to a wayfaring or
sojourning state, where tabernacles or tents
are occasionally erected for the accommo∣dation
of passengers. The same metaphor
is here made use of, which is employed
in several other passages of Scripture, where
we are said to be <HI>strangers and sojourners
on earth before God, as were all our fathers.</HI>
This earth may be compared to a wide
field spread with tents, where troops of
pilgrims appear in succession and pass away.
They enter for a little into the tents pre∣pared
for them; and remain there to un∣dergo
their appointed probation. When
that is finished, their tents are taken down,
and they retire, to make way for others,
who come forward in their allotted order.
<PB N="223" REF="234"/>
Thus <HI>one generation passeth away, and ano∣ther
generation cometh;</HI> and the <HI>earthly house</HI>
is to all no other than the <HI>house of their
pilgrimage.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm exix. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>earthly house of this tabernacle,</HI> the
Apostle, proceeding in his description, tells
us, is <HI>to be dissolved.</HI> Close as the union
between the soul and body now appears
to be, it is no more than a temporary
union. It subsists only during the con∣tinuance
of a tabernacle of dust, which, by
its nature, is tending towards ruin. The
<HI>dust must</HI> soon <HI>return to the dust, and the
spirit to God who gave it.</HI>—The disso∣lution
of the <HI>earthly house of this tabernacle,</HI>
is an event full of dismay to wicked men.
Beyond that period they see nothing but
a dark unknown, which, as far as they
can discern, is peopled with objects full
of terrour; even to the just, this disso∣lution
is a serious and awful event. Pro∣vidence
has wisely appointed, that burdened
as our present state is, with various ills and
<PB N="224" REF="235"/>
frailties, we should, however, be naturally
attached to it. Its final close is always at∣tended
with several melancholy ideas.—
Thou who now flourishest most in health
and strength, must then have thy head laid
low. From thy closing eyes the light of
the sun shall disappear for ever. That light
shall continue to shine, the seasons to re∣turn,
and the earth to flourish; but to thee
no more, separated from the dwellings of
men, and cut off from all thou wert accus∣tomed
to love, as though thou hadst never
been.—Such is the fate of man considered
merely as mortal; as dwelling in an earthly
house which is about to be dissolved. The
consolatory corrective of those humbling
ideas, the ray that is to dissipate this gloom,
we behold in the subsequent part of the text;
that when this earthly house is dissolved,
there is prepared for the righteous <HI>a build∣ing
of God, an house not made with hands,</HI>
But before proceeding to this part of the
subject, let us pause for a little, and make
some reflections on what has been already
said.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="236"/>
LET the distinction between the soul and
the body, which is so clearly marked in
the text, be deeply imprinted on our minds.
Few things in religion or morals are en∣titled
to make a stronger impression than
this distinction; and yet, with the bulk of
men, the impression it makes appears to
be slight. They seem to think and act as
if they consisted of no more than mere
flesh and blood, and had no other concerns
than what respect their embodied state. If
their health be firm, if their senses be gra∣tified,
and their appetites indulged, all is
well with them. Is not this to forget that
the body is no more than an <HI>earthly house</HI>
or <HI>tabernacle</HI> of the soul? The soul, that
thinking part which they feel within them,
and which it is impossible for them to con∣found
with their flesh or their bones, is
certainly far nobler than the tenement of
clay which it inhabits. The soul is the
principle of all life, and knowledge, and
action. The body is no more than its in∣strument,
or organ; and as much nobler as is
the part which belongs to him who employs
<PB N="226" REF="237"/>
an instrument, than to the instrument
which is employed, so much is the soul of
greater dignity than the body. The one
is only a frail and perishable machine; the
other survives its ruin, and lives for ever.
—During the time that the union con∣tinues
between those two very different
parts of our frame, I by no means say that
it is incumbent upon us to disregard all
that relates to the body. It is not possible,
nor though it were possible, would it be
requisite or sit, for man to act as if he were
pure immaterial spirit. This is what the
condition and laws of our nature permit
not.—But must not the greatest sensualist
admit, that if the soul be the chief part of
man, it must have interests of its own,
which require to be carefully attended to?
Can he imagine that he truly consults either
his interest or his pleasure, if he employs
the thinking part of his nature only to
serve, and to minister to the bodily part?
Must not this infer, not merely a degra∣dation
of the superiour part, but an entire
perversion of that whole constitution of
<PB N="227" REF="238"/>
nature which our Maker hath given us?
Be assured, my brethren, that the soul hath
a health and a sickness, hath pleasures and
pains of its own, quite distinct from those
of the body, and which have a powerful
influence on the happiness or misery of
man. He who pays no attention to these,
and neglects all care of preserving the
health and soundness of his soul, is not
only preparing final misery for himself when
he shall enter into a disembodied estate,
but is laying, even for his present state,
the foundation of many a bitter distress.
By folly and guilt he is <HI>wounding his spirit.</HI>
Its wounds will often bleed when his body
appears sound, and will give rise to inward
pangs which no animal comforts shall be
able to assuage or heal.</P>
<P>When we impress our minds with a
sense of this important distinction between
the body and the soul, let us not forget,
that closely united as they now are in our
frame, their union is soon to terminate.
<HI>The earthly house of this tabernacle is to
be dissolved;</HI> but the soul which inhabits
<PB N="228" REF="239"/>
it remains. Let us therefore dwell in our
earthly house with the sentiments of those
who know they are about to dislodge.
The endowments and improvements of
the soul are the only possessions on which
we can reckon as continuing to be our
own. On every possession which belongs
to our bodily estate, we ought to view this
inscription as written by God; “This is
art earthly house which is tottering to its
fall; This is a tabernacle which is about
to be taken down.”—Let us with plea∣sure
turn our thoughts towards those higher
prospects that are set before us, when
this change shall have taken place in the
human condition; which naturally brings
us to the</P>
<P>IId Head of discourse,—the great object
of the hope of good men in a succeeding
state. <HI>The earthly house</HI> is contrasted by
the Apostle with a <HI>uilding of God; an house
not made with hands;</HI> and <HI>the tabernacle
which is to be dissolved,</HI> with a <HI>house eternal
in the heavens.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="240"/>
The expressions here employed to signify
what is promised to the righteous, <HI>a build∣ing
of God, an house not made with hands,</HI>
are expressions of a mysterious import.
They suggest to us things which we cannot
now conceive, far less describe. Into that
house which is above, those habitations
of eternity, no living man has entered, to
explore them, and to report to us tidings
of what he there beheld. A sacred veil
conceals the mansions of glory. But, in
general, these expressions of the text plainly
import that the spirits of good men shall,
upon death, be translated from an im∣perfect
to a glorious state. Whether we
explain <HI>the building of God, the house not
made with hands,</HI> to signify the incor∣ruptible
bodies which the just shall animate
at the resurrection, or the habitations of
celestial glory into which they enter, they are
terms which convey ideas of high magnifi∣cence
and felicity. This earth on which we
dwell, is no more than an exteriour region
of the great kingdom of God. It is but an
entrance, through which, after suitable pre∣paration,
<PB N="230" REF="241"/>
we pass into the palace of an
Almighty Sovereign. Admitted there, we
may hope to behold far greater objects
than we now can behold; and to enjoy
in perfection those pleasures which we
here view from afar, and pursue in vain.
Such degrees of pleasure are allowed us at
present as our state admits. But a state of
trial required that pains should be inter∣mixed
with our pleasutes, and that infir∣mity
and distress should often be felt. The
remains of our fall appear every where in
our condition. The ruins of human na∣ture
present themselves on all hands. But
<HI>when that which is perfect is come, that
which is in part shall be done away.</HI> With
the fall of the earthly house, all its rotten
and corruptible materials shall disappear.
<HI>It is sown in corruption,</HI> says the Apostle,
speaking of the happy change made upon
good men at the resurrection, <HI>it is raised
in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it
is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it
is raised in power; it is sown a natural, it
is raised a spiritual body:—for this corrup∣tible
<PB N="231" REF="242"/>
shall put on incorruption, and this mortal,
put on immortality.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Corinth xv. 42–53.</NOTE>—Into that <HI>house not
made with hands, that building of God,</HI>
we have every reason to believe that
there will be no room for such guests
to intrude as care or sorrow. Nothing
can be admitted to enter there, but what
contributes to the felicity of those whom
the Almighty hath allowed to dwell in
his presence, and to <HI>behold his face in
righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the glory and perfection of this
future state, the text suggests its perma∣nency.
This house <HI>not made with hands,</HI>
is <HI>a house eternal in the heavens.</HI> The ta∣bernacle
which we now inhabit is every
moment liable to fall: above, is the fixed
mansion, the seat of perpetual rest. Be∣yond
doubt, the certain prospect of death
renders every thing inconsiderable which
we here possess. Every enjoyment is sad∣dened,
when we think of its end approach∣ing.
We become sensible that we are
<PB N="232" REF="243"/>
always building on sand, never on a rock.
Fluctuation and change characterise all
that is around us; and at the moment
when our attachment to any persons or
objects is become the strongest, they are
beginning to slide away from our hold.
But in the mansions above, alteration and
decay are unknown. Every thing there
continues in a steady course. No schemes
are there begun, and left unfinished; no
pleasing connexions just formed, and then
broken off. The treasures possessed there
shall never be diminished; the friends we
enjoy there shall never die, and leave us to
mourn. In those celestial regions, shines
the sun that never sets; the calm reigns,
which is never disturbed; the river of life
flows with a stream, which is always un∣ruffled
in its course.</P>
<P>Such are the prospects, imperfectly as
we can now conceive them, which are set
forth to good men in a future world. But
how, it may be asked, shall we be satisfied
that such prospects are not mere illusions
with which our fancy flatters us. Upon
<PB N="233" REF="244"/>
what foundations rests this mighty edifice
of hope, which the Apostle here rears up
for the consolation of Christians, and of
which he speaks so considently as to say,
<HI>We know that if our earthly house of
this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a
building of God?</HI>—To enquire into this
was the</P>
<P>IIId proposed Head of discourse, to which
we now proceed. And as the subject is in
itself so important, and so pleasing to all
good men, I shall take a view of the dif∣ferent
kinds of evidence, upon which our
faith of a happy immortality is grounded.</P>
<P>We must observe, in the first place, that
the dissolution of the earthly tabernacle at
death, affords no ground for thinking that
the soul at the same time perishes, or is ex∣tinguished.
I begin with this observation,
because the strongest prejudices against the
soul's immortality, arise from what is some∣times
found to happen at that period. The
soul and the body are at present united by
the closest sympathy. When one suffers,
<PB N="234" REF="245"/>
the other is affected. Both seem to grow
up together to the maturity of their powers;
and together both seem often to decay.
Such a shock is apparently suffered by the
soul at death, as at first view might lead
us to suspect that it was sharing the same
fate with the body. Notwithstanding this,
there are clear proofs that the body and the
soul, though at present closely connected by
divine appointment with one another, are,
however, substances of different and dissi∣milar
natures. Matter, of which the body
is composed, is a substance altogether dead
and passive, and cannot be put in motion
without some external impulse. Whereas
the soul hath within itself a principle of
motion, activity and life. Between the
laws of matter, and the action of thought,
there is so little resemblance, or rather so
much opposition, that mankind in general
have agreed in holding the soul to be an
immaterial substance; that is, a substance
the nature of which we cannot explain or
define further than that it is a substance
quite distinct from matter. This being
<PB N="235" REF="246"/>
once admitted, it clearly follows, that since
thought depends not on matter, from the
dissolution of the material part we have no
ground to infer the destruction of the think∣ing
part of man. As long as by the ordi∣nation
of the Creator these different sub∣stances
remain united, there is no wonder
that the one should suffer from the disorder
or indisposition of the other.</P>
<P>It is so far from following that the soul
must cease to act on the dissolution of the
body, that it seems rather to follow, that it
will then act in a more perfect manner.
In its present habitation, it is plainly limited
and confined in its operations. When it is
let loose from that earthly house, it is
brought forth into greater liberty. To
illustrate this by an instance which may be
conceived as analogous; let us suppose a
person shut up in an apartment, where he
saw light only through some small windows.
If these windows were soul or dimmed, he
would see less; if they were altogether
darkened, he could see none at all. But
were he let out from this confinement into
<PB N="236" REF="247"/>
the open air, he would be so far from being
deprived of sight, that though at first over∣powered
by a sudden glare, he would soon
see around him much more completely
than before. The senses are as so many
windows or apertures, through which the
soul at present exercises its powers of per∣ception.
If the senses are disordered, the
powers of the soul will be obstructed. But
once separated from its earthly tenement,
the soul will then exercise its powers with∣out
obstruction; will act with greater liberty,
and in a wider sphere.—I admit this ar∣gument
only goes as far as to show, that
although the body perish, there remains
with the soul a capacity for separate ex∣istence.
Whether that existence shall be
actually continued to it after death, must
depend on the will of Him who gave
it life, and who certainly at his pleasure
can take that life away. It is necessary,
therefore, to enquire into what, we have
any reason to believe, may be the in∣tention
of our Creator concerning a future
life.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="248"/>
I argue then, in the next place, that if
the soul were to perish when the body dies,
the state of man would be altogether un∣suitable
to the wisdom and perfection of the
Author of his being. Man would be the
only creature that would seem to have been
made in vain. All the other works of God
are contrived to answer exactly the pur∣poses
for which they were made. They
are either incapable of knowledge at all;
or, they know nothing higher than the
state in which they are placed. Their
powers are perfectly suited and adjusted to
their condition. But it is not so with man.
He has every appearance of being framed
for something higher and greater than what
he here attains. He sees the narrow bounds
within which he is here confined; knows
and laments all the imperfections of his
present state. His thirst for knowledge,
his desires of happiness, all stretch beyond
his earthly station. He searches in vain for
adequate objects to gratify him. His nature
is perpetually tending and aspiring towards
the enjoyment of some more complete feli∣city
<PB N="238" REF="249"/>
city than this world can afford. In the
midst of all his searches and aspirations, he
is suddenly cut off. He is but of yesterday,
and to-morrow is gone. Often in the
entrance, often in the bloom of life, when
he had just begun to act his part, and to
expand his powers, darkness is made to
cover him.—Can we believe, that when
this period is come, all is finally over with
the best and the worthiest of mankind?
Endowed with so noble an apparatus of
rational powers, taught to form high views
and enlarged desires, were they brought forth
for no other purpose, than to breathe this
gross and impure air for a short space, and
then to be cut off from all existence? All
his other works, God hath made in <HI>weight,
number, and measure;</HI> the hand of the Al∣mighty
artificer every where appears. But
on man, his chief work here below, he
would, upon this supposition, appear to
have bestowed no attention; and after
having erected a stately palace in this
universe, framed with so much magnifi∣cence,
and decorated with so much beauty,
<PB N="239" REF="250"/>
to have introduced man, in the guise of a
neglected wanderer, to become its inhabitant.</P>
<P>Let us farther consider the confused and
promiseuous distribution of good and evil
in this life. The enjoyments of the world,
such as they are, are far from being always
bestowed on the virtuous and the worthy.
On the contrary, the bitterest portion is
often their lot. In the midst of infirmities,
diseases, and sorrows, they are left to drag
their life, while ease and affluence are
allowed to the ungodly.—I must ask, if
such an arrangement of things, owing to
the ordination, or, at least, to the permis∣sion
of Providence, be consonant to any
ideas we can form of the wisdom and good∣ness
of a Supreme Ruler, on the supposition
of there being no future state?—But as
soon as the immortality of the soul, and a
state of future retribution are established, all
difficulties vanish; the mystery is unra∣velled;
supreme wisdom, justice, and good∣ness,
are discovered to be only concealed
for a little while behind the curtain. If
that curtain were never to be withdrawn,
<PB N="240" REF="251"/>
and immortality never to appear, the ways
of God would be utterly inexplicable to
man. We would be obliged to conclude
that either a God did not exist; or though
he existed, that he was not possessed of such
perfections as we now ascribe to him, if
when a worthy and pious man had spent
his whole life in virtuous deeds, and perhaps
had died a martyr to the cause of religion
and truth; he should, after long and severe
sufferings, perish finally, unrewarded and
forgotten; no attention shown to him by
the Almighty; no <HI>building of God</HI> erected
for him; no <HI>house eternal</HI> prepared in the
Heavens!</P>
<P>THESE reasonings are much strengthened
by the belief that has ever prevailed among
all mankind, of the soul's immortality. It is
not an opinion that took its rise from the
thin spun speculations of some abstract phi∣losophers.
Never has any nation been dis∣covered
on the face of the earth so rude
and barbarous, that in midst of their wildest
superstitions there was not cherished among
<PB N="241" REF="252"/>
them some expectation of a state after death,
in which the virtuous were to enjoy happi∣ness.
So universal a consent in this belief,
affords just ground to ascribe it to some
innate principle implanted by God in the
human breast. Had it no foundation in
truth, we must suppose that the Creator
found it necessary, for the purposes of his
government, to carry on a principle of
universal deception among his rational sub∣jects.
Many of the strongest passions of
our nature are made to have a clear re∣ference
to the future existence of the soul.
The love of same, the ardent concern which
so often prevails about futurity, all allude to
somewhat in which men suppose themselves
to be personally concerned, after death.
The consciences, both of the good and the
bad, bear witness to a world that is to
come. Seldom do men leave this world
without some fears or hopes respecting it;
some secret anticipations and presages of
what is hereafter to befal them.</P>
<P>But though the reasonings which have
been adduced to prove the immortality of
<PB N="242" REF="253"/>
the soul and a future state, are certainly of
great weight, yet reasonings still they are,
and no more; and in every human reason∣ing,
suspicions may arise of some fallacy or
error. In a point so momentous to us, as
our existence after death, we never could,
with absolute certainty and full satisfaction,
have rested on any evidence except what
was confirmed by the declaration of God
himself.—For many and high blessings we
are indebted to the Christian revelation;
for none more than for its having <HI>brought
life and immortality to light.</HI> The re∣velations
made by God to the world in
early ages, gave the first openings to this
great article of faith and hope. In fu∣ture
periods, the light dawned more and
more; but it was not until the sun of
righteousness arose by the appearance of
Christ on earth, that the great discovery
was completed. Then, indeed, were made
known the <HI>city of the living God,</HI> the <HI>new
Jerusalem</HI> above, the <HI>mansions</HI> prepared for
the <HI>spirits of just men made perfect.</HI> Nor
was a state of future felicity only proclaimed
<PB N="243" REF="254"/>
by Christ and his apostles to good men,
but was represented as purchased for them
by the death of their Redeemer. <HI>I give,</HI>
he was authorised to say, <HI>unto my sheep
eternal life. In my father's house are many
mansions. I go to prepare a place for you</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, x. 28.—xiv. 2.</NOTE>.
Accordingly, he lay down in the grave;
rose as the <HI>first fruits of them that slept;</HI>
and ascending into Heaven, entered there
within the veil, as the <HI>forerunner</HI> of his
followers, to assure them of all being
friendly and well-disposed towards them in
those upper regions. All therefore who
live and die in the faith and obedience of
Jesus, are entitled to say with the Apostle,
<HI>we know;</HI> not only we hope and we rea∣son,
but <HI>we know, that if our earthly house of
this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a
building of God, an house not made with
hands, eternal in the Heavens.</HI></P>
<P>THE first and most natural improvement
of all that has been said, is to produce in
<PB N="244" REF="255"/>
our hearts the most lasting gratitude, love,
and reverence, towards that great benefactor
of mankind, who not only hath made
known and published the blessings of a
future state to the righteous, but by his
great undertaking for their redemption
hath erected in their behalf the <HI>house eternal
in the heavens.</HI>—The next improvement
we should make, is to conduct our own life
and behaviour as becomes those who have
an interest in this happiness and this hope.
From such persons assuredly is to be ex∣pected
a pure, correct, and dignified beha∣viour
in every situation; not a contempt of
the employments, nor a renunciation of all
the comforts of their present life. Opinions
that produce such effects are connected
only with the spirit of superstition and false
religion. But to them it belongs, in midst
of the affairs, enticements, and temptations
of the world, to regulate their conduct
as becomes the heirs of a divine inherit∣ance;
never debasing themselves among
what is mean, nor desiling themselves with
what is corrupt in the present state; but
<PB N="245" REF="256"/>
serving God with that sidelity, and behav∣ing
to men with that steady magnanimity
of virtue, that generous beneficence and
humanity, which suits immortal beings,
who are aspiring to rise in a future state to
the perfection of their nature, in the pre∣sence
of God.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On overcoming Evil with Good.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ROMANS, xii. 21.</BIBL>
<Q>Be not overcome of evil; but overcome evil
with good.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XI.</NOTE> we all know that we must
reckon upon a mixture of goods and
evils. Some of the evils are owing to the
appointment of Providence in this state of
trial; many of them are the fruits of our
own guilt and misconduct. The goods
and the evils of our state are so blended, as
often to render the whole of human life a
struggle between them. We have to con∣tend
both with the evils of fortune, and
<PB N="247" REF="258"/>
with the evils of our own depravity; and
it is only he who can in some measure
overcome both, that is to be esteemed the
wise, the virtuous, and the happy man.
At the same time, amidst the evils of dif∣ferent
kinds which assault us, there is a
principle of good, derived from Heaven,
by which we may hope to acquire strength,
and through divine assistance be enabled to
overcome the evils of our state. This is the
subject of the exhortation in the text, <HI>Be
not overcome of evil: but overcome evil with
good.</HI> Taken in its most extensive sense,
as respecting the different kinds of evil
which we have to overcome, the exhorta∣tion
may be understood to comprise the
three following particulars. In the first
place, Be not overcome by the injuries you
meet with in the world, so as to pursue
revenge. Secondly, Be not overcome by
the disasters of the world, so as to sink into
despair. Thirdly, Be not overcome by the
evil examples of the world, so as to follow
them into sin. But in all those cases,
<HI>overcome evil with good.</HI> Overcome in∣juries,
<PB N="248" REF="259"/>
by forgiveness. Overcome disasters,
by fortitude. Overcome evil examples, by
firmness of principle.</P>
<P>I. BE not overcome by the injuries you
meet with in the world, so as to pursue
revenge. It appears from the context, that
this was the primary object which the
Apostle had in his view in this exhortation.
He refers to the injuries which the pri∣mitive
Christians were constantly suffering
from their persecutors. Instead of being
so much overcome by these as to be intent
on revenge, his exhortation in the verses
preceding the text is, <HI>Dearly beloved,
avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
unto wrath; for it is written, vengeance is
mine, I will repay, faith the Lord. There∣fore,
if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he
thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou
shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not
overcome of evil; but overcome evil with
good.</HI> But it is not in times only of per∣secution
and general distress, that this ex∣hortation
is needful. We must in every
<PB N="249" REF="260"/>
state of society reckon upon meeting with
unreasonable men, and encountering their
bad usage. This is one of the evils inse∣parable
from our present state. No station
is so high, no worth so distinguished, no
innocence so inoffensive, as to secure us
entirely against it. Sometimes the violence
of enemies, sometimes the ingratitude of
friends, will ruffle our spirits. Where we
think that we have merited praise, we will
be in hazard of meeting reproach. Envy
will rise unprovoked; and calumny, from its
secret place, will dart its envenomed shafts
against the most deserving. Such is the
consequence of the present depravity of
our nature, and of the disordered state in
which human affairs lie.—The fondness
of self-love is always apt to amuse us with
too flattering prospects of what life is to
produce for us, beyond what it produces
for others. Hence our impatience and
irritation upon every injury we suffer; as
if some new and unheard-of thing had
befallen us; and as if we alone were pri∣vileged
to pass through the world, un∣touched
<PB N="250" REF="261"/>
touched by any wrong. Whereas, if we
were disciplined to think of the world, and
of the tempers of those around us, as a wise
man ought to think, the edge of this im∣patience
would be taken off. When we
engage in any undertaking, we ought to
say to ourselves, that in the course of it we
will have to do, more or less, with selfish,
crasty, unprincipled men. These men
will naturally act as their evil nature
prompts them. They are the thorns and
brambles that we must expect to encumber
and to gall us in many of the paths of life.
We must not hope to <HI>reap grapes of thorns,
nor figs of thistles.</HI> Wild dogs will naturally
bark; and beasts of prey naturally seek to
devour.</P>
<P>Now, when thus situated, how are we to
act for overcoming the evils we have al∣ready
endured, or are in hazard of still
farther enduring from others? To provide
for safety and defence, is unquestionably al∣lowable
and wise. But are we also to lay
plans for future revenge?—Were this the
course to be followed, what would the
<PB N="251" REF="262"/>
consequence be, but to render the life of
man a state of constant hostility, where
provocations and resentments, injuries and
retaliations, would succeed one another
without end; till the world became like
a den of wild beasts, perpetually attack∣ing
and devouring one another? No,
says the Apostle, <HI>overcome evil with good.</HI>
Disarm and overcome your enemies, by
forgiveness and generosity. This is the
principle of <HI>good,</HI> which you are to oppose
to their <HI>evil.</HI> Teach them thereby, if not
to love, at least to honour and respect
you. While you take proper precau∣tions
for present safety, provide for the
future, not by studied plans of revenge,
but by fortitude of mind, by prudent be∣haviour,
and superiour virtue. Herein you
show no unmanly tameness or coward∣ice.
Religion means not to suppress the
proper seelings of honour, nor the sense
which every man ought to have of dig∣nity
of character, and the rights which
belong to him. These may be supported
to the full, without a mean thirst for re∣venge,
<PB N="252" REF="263"/>
and a fierce desire of returning evil
for evil.</P>
<P>By the magnanimity of forgiveness, you
gain an important victory in overcoming,
not perhaps your enemy, but your own
wrathful and violent passions. Whereas
he, who in such conjunctures knows no
other method of proceeding but that of
gratifying resentment, is, in truth, the per∣son
who is overcome. For he has put it
in the power of his enemy to overthrow
his repose, and to gall and embitter his
mind. By forgiving and despising injuries,
you assume a superiority over your adver∣sary,
which he will be obliged to feel.
Whereas, if you allow his provocations to
blow you up into fierce revenge, you have
given him the advantage. You confess
yourself hurt and fore. His evil has over∣come
your good. He has fixed a dart
within you, which in vain you endeavour
to pull out; and by the attempts you
make, you only exasperate and inflame
the sore. Seldom is there any punishment
which revenge can inflict, more severe than
<PB N="253" REF="264"/>
is suffered by him who inflicts it. The
bitterness of spirit, the boilings of fierce
passions, joined with all the black ideas
which the cruel plans of revenge excite,
produce more acute sensations of torment,
than any that are occasioned by bodily
pain.—When bad men have behaved
injuriously towards us, let us leave them
to themselves, and they will be sufficiently
punished by their own vices. Their
wickedness is no reason why we should
render ourselves unhappy, or afford them
the gratification of having it in their power
to deprive us of peace.—I shall only add
farther on this head, that a passion for
revenge has been always held to be the
characteristic of a little and mean mind.
Never was any man distinguished as a hero,
or recorded in the annals of history as a
great man, to whom this quality of gene∣rous
forgiveness of evil did not conspi∣cuously
belong. We know how eminently
it shone in the character of Him whom
we justly venerate as the model of all
perfection; whose dying breath was em∣ployed
<PB N="254" REF="265"/>
in apologising and praying for those
who were shedding his blood.</P>
<P>II. BE not overcome by the misfortunes
of life, so as to sink into despair. This is
another view of that <HI>evil</HI> which we are
called upon to <HI>overcome by good;</HI> and is the
sense in which <HI>evil</HI> is most generally un∣derstood,
and is most dreaded by men.
Although by inoffensive and blameless be∣haviour
we should escape, in a great degree,
from the injuries of bad men; yet, to escape
altogether from the stroke of misfortune
and distress, is what none of us can expect.
In one way or other, in our person, or
fortune, or families and friends, it is the
doom of all, more or less, to suffer. From
what causes this appointment of Providence
arises, and to what purposes it is rendered
subservient, it belongs not to our subject
at present to inquire; the fact is too cer∣tain
and obvious.—The principle of
good which we must oppose to those evils
of our lot, and by means of which we may
hope to overcome them, is inward forti∣tude,
<PB N="255" REF="266"/>
grounded on religion and trust in
God; forming that state of mind, which,
resting on itself, and the witness of a good
conscience, rises superiour to the trials of
the world.</P>
<P>When the sky begins to lour around
thee; when thy gay prospects begin to
disappear, thy friends to fail, or thy for∣tune
to decline; or when, as years ad∣vance,
the chief comforts on which thy
heart was set, and on which thou hadst
conceived thy happiness to depend, are
unexpectedly cut off; say not then within
thyself, “The evil time has now over∣taken
me; the gates of hope are all
shut; the days are come wherein I shall
have no pleasure; enjoyment is fled;
nothing remains for me now, but to
close my days in melancholy, to despair,
and to die.”—This is to be <HI>overcome of
evil</HI> indeed. He who thus allows himself
to sink under the misfortunes of life, dis∣honours
the character of a man, still more
that of a christian. He shows that what∣ever
plausible appearances he may at former
<PB N="256" REF="267"/>
times have made before the world, at
bottom he not only wanted strength and
firmness of mind, but was deficient also in
religious faith and principle. For it is
impossible that he who allows himself to
be so entirely overcome by the evils of the
world, can entertain just notions of God,
and of his government of the world. He
hath cast aside all reliance on Providence,
and set at nought the promises of the
gospel. He may suppress all outward ex∣pressions
of impious discontent; he may
even affect the language of resignation;
but his heart in secret will murmur and
repine against the Lord.</P>
<P>These, therefore, are the occasions when
it particularly behoves us to call to mind
all those principles which should assist us
so to possess our minds in patience, as to
overcome evil with good.—Recall, my
brethren, all the former experience you
have had of the goodness of the Almighty,
and the ground which this affords for trust
and hope in him now. Recall to remem∣brance
all the promises he has made to
<PB N="257" REF="268"/>
good men; as the words of Him <HI>who
changes not;</HI> who <HI>is not a man that he should
lie, nor the son of man that he should repent.</HI>
Recollect the general tenour of that Pro∣vidence,
whose course it has ever been, since
the creation of the world, so to chequer
the life of men with unforeseen vicissitudes,
as often to make unexpected goods suc∣ceed
evils; nay, to make them spring from
evils. Recollect, that whatever fortune
may rob you of, it cannot take away what
is most valuable, the peace of a good con∣science,
the pleasing sense of having acted
honourably and done your duty, and the
cheering prospect of a happy conclusion to
all the trials of life in a better world. Con∣sider,
that as long as virtue remains, there
are always, even in the most unfavourable
situations, some comforts still left open,
did we not overlook them. For it is seldom
or never that all good things forsake a
man at once, and all evils overtake him
together. If he is bereaved of some friends
whom he tenderly loved, there are others
yet remaining to whom he may look for
<PB N="258" REF="269"/>
comfort. If, by infirmity, or old age, he
be excluded from the enjoyments of active
life, the gratifications which leisure and
repose afford, are still left to him. If his
fortune be shattered, and poverty threaten
to beset him, yet, even in very straitened
circumstances, many of the simple and best
pleasures of nature, and many of the satis∣factions
of social life, can still be enjoyed.
Nay, the mind of a good man can still be
a kingdom to itself; and though confined
in a prison, or stretched on a sick-bed, peace∣ful
and pleasing thoughts will occasionally
arise to him, and fair prospects of futurity
will present themselves to his view.</P>
<P>Assisted by such considerations as these,
let us enliven faith, strengthen patience, and
animate hope, till we be enabled to <HI>over∣come
evil with good:</HI> always looking for∣ward
to better days; nourishing trust in the
gracious government of the universe; and
listening to Him who hath said of old, and
who still says to all his servants, <HI>Fear not,
for I am with thee; be not afraid for I am
thy God. Call upon me in the day of trouble,
<PB N="259" REF="270"/>
and I will answer thee; wait on the Lord,
be of good courage; and he shall strengthen
your hearts, all ye that wait upon the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>III. BE not overcome by the evil ex∣amples
of the world, so as to follow them
into sin. This undoubtedly is one of the
most dangerous evils which good men are
called to overcome; and where it is most
difficult to gain the victory. He who, in
the former instances that have been men∣tioned,
can <HI>overcome evil with good;</HI> who
can generously forgive injuries, and mag∣nanimously
bear up under misfortunes,
will be often in hazard of being overcome
by evil, under this form. After having
maintained his ground against many a
rough blast, he may be in danger of being
betrayed by a flattering gale, in the days
of his ease and prosperity; of being insen∣sibly
carried down the stream by that mul∣situde
of evil-doers who surround and de∣ceive
him. For the character of <HI>the world</HI>
too certainly is, that it <HI>lieth in wickedness.</HI>
Fashions of vice may change with the
<PB N="260" REF="271"/>
times. In one age, one set of corrupt ha∣bits
may prevail; and in another, the pas∣sions
of men may take a different turn.
But, in every age, the multitude of men
will be prone to indulge vicious desires.
On the surface of behaviour, vice may be
disguised under a plausible and polished ap∣pearance,
while at bottom there lies the
poisoned root of evil. Pleasure will ever
captivate the young and unthinking.
Riches and advancement ensnare the more
sober and stayed. Attached to their dif∣ferent
pursuits, and connecting with them
the ideas of wisdom and importance, the
multitude will ridicule those who go not
along with them, as formal and precise,
as raw, uneducated, and ignorant of the
world. Assailed by such reproaches, the
timid become afraid; the modest are
abashed; the complaisant and good-natured
submit to their supposed friends. They
begin to imagine that the general opinion
of the world cannot but have some reason
on its side; and, half seduced by persuasion,
half compelled by ridicule, they surrender
<PB N="261" REF="272"/>
their former convictions, and consent to
live as they see others around them living.</P>
<P>Such are the evils which we must study
to overcome by good, if we wish to be
esteemed either honourable men, or faithful
christians. And how are we to overcome
them? <HI>This is the victory,</HI> says the Apostle
John, <HI>that overcometh the world, even our
faith</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John, v. 4.</NOTE>. It is the steadiness of firm and
rooted principle, of belief in God and
Christ, of belief in the everlasting import∣ance
of religion and virtue, which you are
to oppose to the host of evil-doers.—
Consider, I beseech you, that no fashions
nor opinions of men can affect that unalter∣able
law of God, which rests on the eternal
basis of rectitude and truth. Men, if they
please, may call evil, good, and good, evil;
but as they cannot change the nature of
things, their voice gives no sanction to any
plan of conduct as right and wise<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See this subject fully discussed in Sermon XIX. of
Vol. iv.</NOTE>. So far
are you from having any chance of hold∣ing
<PB N="262" REF="273"/>
either a wise or a safe course by going
along with the multitude, that he who
implicitly follows them may be justly
presumed to be in the path of error and
of danger. For in every age the multitude
have enquired superficially, have judged
rashly, and acted inconsiderately. Con∣currence
with general practice, neither af∣fords
justification of conduct, nor promises
impunity in what is evil. The Righteous
Lord of all will never suffer his laws to be
subjected to the capricious fancies of his
creatures. Transgressors will neither be
screened by their numbers, nor escape by
being hidden in a crowd.</P>
<P>In times, therefore, when corruption is
prevalent, when vice under any of its modes
is fashionable, we are particularly called
upon to show that we have within us a
<HI>good,</HI> which we can oppose to this <HI>evil;</HI> to
show that we have fixed principles of our
own, which we will surrender to no man,
but upon which we will act, and will
stand by them to the last. It ought to be
no part of our character, that we seek to
<PB N="263" REF="274"/>
distinguish ourselves by affected austerity,
and a marked singularity in frivolous
and insignificant matters. Our distinc∣tion
must rest upon a steady adhe∣rence
to rational religion and the uncon∣trovertible
rules of virtue, when the mul∣titude
around us, whether the high or the
low, are deviating into licentious and cri∣minal
conduct. Depend upon it you may,
that even that multitude, though they may
attempt to turn you into ridicule, honour
you at the bottom of their hearts. They
will be compelled to acknowledge, or at
least to feel, whether they acknowledge it
or not, that your unshaken firmness in what
you esteem to be honourable and worthy,
must proceed from some principle within,
of a higher nature than that from which
they act. At any rate, by thus maintain∣ing,
in every situation, the cause of religion
and truth, and thereby overcoming evil
with your good, you shall obtain honour
from the great Judge of the earth, and
your reward shall be great in Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="275"/>
THUS, in several important instances, I
have shown how the exhortation in the
text is to be complied with, and in what
manner our good should overcome evil;
overcoming injuries by generous forgive∣ness;
overcoming misfortunes by patience
and resignation; overcoming the tempta∣tions
of evil examples by steady adherence
to conscience and duty. In many of these
cases, the conflict we are called to maintain
may be ardu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us and difficult; inclined, as
we too often are, by the bent of our nature
to the evil side. But, if we wish and de∣sire
to do well, let us not be discouraged,
nor despair of victory. Weak in our∣selves,
we have ground to be <HI>strong in
the Lord, and in the power of his might.</HI>
For the principle of good, feeble though
it may be at present in human nature,
is never left unbefriended by God. It is a
principle derived from Heaven, and par∣takes
of heavenly efficacy. If it once take
root in the soul, it will be made to arise
and grow from small beginnings into gra∣dual
maturity, under his protection and
<PB N="265" REF="276"/>
influence from whom its origin came. To
them who have no might, it is written,
<HI>he increaseth strength</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah, xl. 29.</NOTE>. The contest be∣tween
sin and righteousness, which at present
takes place in the world, is a struggle be∣tween
God and Belial, between the powers
of light and the kingdom of darkness; and
in this state of things we must easily dis∣cern
to which side the final victory will
belong. Let us endeavour to do our duty,
and God will be with us. Let us sincerely
study to overcome evil with good, and we
shall overcome it. Our feeble powers shall
be aided by divine might, and our im∣perfect
services crowned with divine re∣wards.
<HI>They that wait upon the Lord shall
renew their strength; they shall mount up
with wings as eagles; they shall run and
not be weary; they shall walk, and not
faint</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah, xl. 31.</NOTE>.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>PAINS and sorrows occur so frequently
in human life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XII.</NOTE> that it is not surprising
that the multitude of men should eagerly
court scenes of pleasure and joy. It is
natural to seek relief from our cares, by
whatever promises to substitute hours of
gladness in the place of anxiety and trouble.
But we have much reason to beware, lest
a rash and unwary pursuit of pleasure de∣feat
its end, lest the attempt to carry plea∣sure
<PB N="267" REF="278"/>
too far, tend, in the issue, to sink us
into misery. <HI>There is a way,</HI> says the wise
man in the verse preceding the text, <HI>which
seemeth right unto a man; but the end thereof
are the ways of death.</HI> There is a certain
course of life which a man may have chosen
to adopt, as leading to gladness and en∣joyment;
but which he shall find at last
to be destructive of his happiness: for all
is not real gladness, which has the appear∣ance
of being such. <HI>There is a laughter,
in the midst of which the heart is sor∣rowful;
and a mirth, the end whereof is
heaviness.</HI></P>
<P>From serious admonitions of this kind
given in Scripture, it would be very unjust
to infer, that religion is an enemy to all
mirth and gaiety. It circumscribes our en∣joyments,
indeed, within the bounds of
temperance; but as far as this sacred limit
permits, it gives free scope to all the grati∣fications
of life. It even heightens their
relish to a virtuous man. It enlivens his
cheerfulness, and allows him to enjoy with
satisfaction all that prosperity affords him.
<PB N="268" REF="279"/>
The text is applicable only to that set of
men to whom temperance is no restraint;
who propose to themselves the unlimited
enjoyment of amusement and pleasure in
all their forms, as the sole object and bu∣siness
of life.</P>
<P>Such persons, too frequently to be met
with in the age wherein we live, have
utterly mistaken the nature and condition
of man. From the participation of plea∣sure,
as I just now observed, he is far from
being excluded. But let, him remember
that a mediocrity only of enjoyment is
allowed him, for his portion on earth.
He is placed in a world, where, whatever
his rank or station be, a certain part is
allotted him to act; there are duties
which are required of him; there are se∣rious
cares which must employ his mind,
how to perform properly the various offices
of life, and to fill up the place which be∣longs
to him in society.—He who, laying
aside all thoughts and cares of this kind,
finding himself in the possession of easy or
assluent fortune, and in the bloom of life,
<PB N="269" REF="280"/>
says within himself, “What have I to do,
but to seek out every pleasure and amuse∣ment
which the world can afford me?
Let others toil in the common walks of
life, who have to make their fortunes by
sober and dull application. But to me
labour is superfluous, the world is open.
Wherever amusement invites, or pleasure
calls, there I go. By passing my days
and nights in whatever can entertain
my fancy or gratify my senses, life shall,
to me, be rendered delightful.”—He, I
say, who thinks thus, vainly endeavours to
counteract the intention of nature, and the
decree of Providence. He attempts to
render his state on earth, what it was never
designed to be. He might as well expect
that the physical laws of nature should be
altered on his account; and that, instead of
being confined to walk like ordinary men
on the ground, he should obtain the pri∣vilege
of treading on the air, as expect to
enjoy a state of perpetual pleasure, by de∣voting
himself to pleasure wholly, and set∣ting
aside all the serious cares and duties
<PB N="270" REF="281"/>
of life. Troubles, he may be well assured,
are prepared for him, and await him.
Where he expected satisfaction, he shall
meet with disappointment; and in him
shall be verified the saying in the text,
that <HI>even in laughter the heart is sorrowful,
and the end of that mirth is heaviness.</HI>—
But lest, to persons of this description, such
general reasoning, from the established con∣stitution
of Providence, may not be satis∣factory,
I proceed to show them how clearly
it is confirmed by facts. For this purpose
let us observe,</P>
<P>IN the first place, the obvious conse∣quences
of a life of pleasure and dissipation,
to health, fortune, and character. To each
of these, it is an enemy, precisely according
to the degree to which it is carried.—
Character is soon affected by it. As the
man of dissipation often makes his appear∣ance
in public, his course is marked, and
his character is quickly decided by general
opinion, according to the line which he is
observed to pursue. By frivolity and levity,
<PB N="271" REF="282"/>
he dwindles into insignificance. By vicious
excesses, or criminal pleasures, he incurs dis∣approbation
or contempt. The fair prospects
which his friends had once entertained of
him die away, in proportion as his idleness
or extravagance grows; and the only hope
which remains is, that some fortunate in∣cident
may occur to check his career, and
reclaim him to a better mind. In the
mean time, the respectable and the grave
smile at his follies, and avoid his company.
In the midst of some fashionable assemblies
he may shine; by some of his fellows he
may be admired; but in the world he is
of no significance or consequence, any
more than the little animals that sport
around him.—Health, the most valuable
of all temporal blessings, is known to be
preserved by temperance and a regular
life. But by the men of dissipation, it is
readily sacrificed at the shrine of pleasure.
To years of health and soundness, they are
often so foolish as to prefer a few hours
of sensual gratification. Supposing that no
extravagant excesses, or vicious pleasures,
<PB N="272" REF="283"/>
cut short their health and life, yet what
constitution can stand the irregular hours,
the disorderly living, the careless indul∣gence,
into which the love of pleasure
draws those who devote themselves to it?
Hence the shattered and debilitated body,
and the premature old age. The native
vigour and sprightliness of youth, is melted
down by effeminacy and sensuality. The
spirits are weakened and enervated, if not
sunk and lost for ever.—The state of
their fortune may, for a while, enable
them to indulge their pleasures, and to
maintain the figure they wish to keep up
in the world; but let fortune be ever so
affluent, in the possession of such persons,
it is in the high road to decay. For to
them, attention to business, or to the ma∣nagement
of their affairs, becomes a burden,
which they studiously shun. Prudent oeco∣nomy
is disdained, as a mean attention,
belonging only to vulgar and narrow
minds. Their habits of licentioufness re∣quire
unlimited indulgence. The demands
of passion must be immediately supplied,
<PB N="273" REF="284"/>
whatever the consequences be. Hence de∣livering
themselves up to those who can fur∣nish
supply for their expence, or who pretend
to take charge of their affairs, they become
the prey of the crafty, who fatten on their
spoils: till at last, in the midst of thoughtless
extravagance, and of general waste and
susion, they see nothing remaining to them,
but the ruins of a broken fortune.</P>
<P>Such are some of the miseries attending
habits of dissipation, and the intemperate love
of pleasure. We see them daily exemplified
in the world, throughout all the stages
of this character, from the frivolous and
the giddy, up to the rake and the profligate;
in some stages, only impairing health and
fortune; in others, entirely overthrowing
them; in their beginnings, casting a shade on
the characters of men; in their completion,
exposing them to disgrace and misery.—
Even abstracting from those ultimate con∣sequences
in which irregular pleasures ter∣minate,
the gratification which, in the mean
time, they bestow, is dearly paid for. A
temporary satisfaction, it is admitted, they
<PB N="274" REF="285"/>
afford. They raise the spirits to a degree
of elevation above their usual tone, but in
that forced elevation they can never long
remain; and in proportion to the elevation
to which they were raised, is the degree of
depression to which they subside. Expe∣rience
has shown, that no sensual pleasure,
except what is regulated by temperance, can
be lasting. Every pleasure that is carried
beyond it, is no more than a momentary
explosion; a transient gush; a torrent that
comes down impetuously, sparkling and
foaming in its course, but that soon runs
out, and leaves a muddy and polluted
channel. Who knows not the languor and
dejection that follow every excessive indul∣gence
of plea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, or a long continuation
of amusement of any kind? From whom
do we hear such frequent complaints of
low spirits, as from those who spend most
of their time in the circles of dissipation
and gaiety, or in the revelry of the world?
To what wretched and pernicious resources
are they obliged to fly, in order to recruit
their spirits, and restore some life to their
<PB N="275" REF="286"/>
deadened sensations? What melancholy spec∣tacles
do they at length exhibit of a worn∣out
frame, and an exhausted mind? So well
founded is the assertion in the text, that
there is <HI>a mirth, the end of which is heaviness.</HI></P>
<P>LET us consider, in the second place,
the ruin which a life of pleasure and dissi∣pation
brings upon the moral state and
character of men, as well as on their
external condition. This deserves the
more attention, as the pursuit of pleasure
sometimes sets out at the beginning with
a fair and innocent appearance. It pro∣mises
to bestow satisfactions unknown to a
duller race of mortals; and, at the same
time, to allow virtue and honour to remain.
With a great part of mankind, especially
with those who are most likely to run the
race of pleasure, such as are well born, and
have been regularly educated, some attach∣ment
to good principles at first is found.
They cannot as yet bear the reproach of any
thing that is dishonourable or base. Re∣gard
to their word, generosity of sentiment,
<PB N="276" REF="287"/>
attachment to their friends, and compassion
for the unhappy, prevail for a while in
their hearts.—But, alas! as the love of
pleasure gains ground, with what insidious
steps does it advance towards the abolition
of all virtuous principles? It has been ever
found, that without the assistance of re∣flection,
and of serious thought, virtue
cannot long subsist in the human mind.
But to reflection and serious thoughts, the
men of dissipation are strangers. Absorbed,
as they are, in the whirlpool of fashionable
life, and hurried along by a rapid suc∣cession
of amusements, reflection is lost, and good impressions gradually decay. No∣thing
is regarded but present enjoyment,
and plans of improving on that enjoyment in future. As their taste, and their ac∣quired
habits, carry them into the society
of licentious company, they must follow the more trained votaries of pleasure who
naturally take the lead. They become as∣similated
to the manners of their loose as∣sociates;
and, without perceiving it them∣selves, their whole character by degrees
<PB N="277" REF="288"/>
is changed. Former restraints are now laid
aside; and in order to preserve the rank
of equality with their companions in every
expence, prodigality is the necessary con∣sequence.
Prodigality presently opens a
way to the worst vices. They become both
covetous and profuse; profuse in spending,
but covetous to acquire. In order to carry
on the splendour of life, and to indulge
their inclinations to the full, they now sub∣mit
to what, at their first outset in life, they
would have rejected as mean and base.
Now is the creditor defrauded; the tenant
racked and oppressed; the tradesman frus∣trated
of the reward of his honest industry;
and friends and relations, on whom any
impression can be made, are plundered
without mercy.—In this manner all the
bland and smiling appearances which
mirth and gaiety once carried, are trans∣formed
into the blackest shapes of vice;
and from a character originally stamped
only with giddiness and levity, shoots
forth a character compounded of dis∣honesty,
injustice, oppression, and cruelty.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="289"/>
Is there any one who will deny, that the
intemperate pursuit of pleasure leads fre∣quently
into all the vices now mentioned,
and that some of them it carries always in
its train? I shall not dwell on certain
crimes, which none but the most atrocious
devotees of pleasure will pretend to justify,
though all who partake of that character
make too light of them; such as, the vio∣lation
of the marriage-bed, the seduction
of the innocent, and the introduction of
misery into families once happy and flou∣rishing.
These are crimes that require
the interposition of the lawgiver and the
judge, more than the admonition of the
preacher.—Let us only think for a little of
that reproach of modern times, that gulph
of time and fortune, the passion for gaming,
which is so often the refuge of the idle
sons of pleasure, and often also the last
resource of the ruined. To how many
bad passions, to how many base arts, does
it give rise? What violent agitations of the
mind, sometimes bursting into rage and
frenzy, does it occasion? What a shameful
<PB N="279" REF="290"/>
traffick of gain does it form among persons,
whom their rank in life, and their connec∣tions
in society, ought to have raised above
the thoughts of enriching themselves by
such dishonourable means? How many
friendships has it broken? How many
families has it ruined? In what deadly
catastrophes has it often terminated? The
gamester sits down at the fatal table with
eager spirits and mighty hopes. Behold
him when he rises,—a wretch, haggard and
forlorn, cursing his fate, and, from despair
of retrieving his ruined fortune, driven
perhaps to entertain the horrid thought of
ending his own existence!—Dismissing
so melancholy a theme, let us,</P>
<P>IN the third place, attend to the dis∣quieting
sensations which are apt to intrude
upon the men of pleasure, even in the
midst of their enjoyments. Not only is
the <HI>end of their mirth heaviness,</HI> but <HI>in
laughter,</HI> as it is expressed in the text, <HI>the
heart is sorrowful.</HI> Often is laughter af∣fected,
when the heart is galled within.
<PB N="280" REF="291"/>
A show of mirth is put on to cover some
secret disquiet. When you enter into a
gay and festive assembly, you behold every
appearance of sparkling felicity. Alas!
could you look into the breasts of this
seemingly happy company, how inconsider∣able
would the proportion be found of
those who were truly happy! how great
the proportion of those who, either in their
minds, were entirely vacant and languid;
or who fled to scenes of gaiety in order to
fly from themselves, from domestic uneasi∣ness,
or corroding cares, and in the tumult
of company and forced mirth, to drown
their sorrows!—At the best, the flashes
of joy, which burst from the dissipated and
careless, are of a transient and broken kind,
interrupted by reflections which they cannot
altogether avoid. For at the bottom of
the hearts of most men, even amidst an
irregular life, there lies a secret feeling of
propriety, a sense of right and wrong in
conduct. This inward sense is frequently
so much borne down by appetites and pas∣sions,
as to lose its power of guiding men
<PB N="281" REF="292"/>
to what is right, while yet it retains as
much influence as to make them sensible
that they have been doing wrong; that
they have not acted that part in life which
they ought to have acted, and which their
friends, and the world, had a title to ex∣pect
from them. Though conscience be
not strong enough to guide, it still has
strength to dart a sting.—Together with
this consciousness of ill desert, there will be
at some times joined a humbling sense of
their own insignificancy, when they behold
others meeting with esteem and honour for
having acted a manly and worthy part in
life. Their superiority they are obliged
to acknowledge, and to look up to them
with respect; while the retrospect of their
own life affords nothing but shame, and
the bitter remembrance of time they have
mispent, and opportunities they have
thrown away.—In the midst too of mor∣tifying
reflections of this kind, it will not
be in their power to escape altogether from
a dread of certain consequences which are
in hazard of befalling from their careless
<PB N="282" REF="293"/>
conduct. Scarcely is any fortune so stable
as to be beyond the reach of accidents that
will diminish it. To none so readily as to
the men of pleasure, are such accidents likely
to happen; and fond as they are of their
present superb train of living, the dread
that it may not be in their power always
to continue it, will, in spite of all their en∣deavours
to avoid such thoughts, occa∣sionally
force itself upon them, and cast a
cloud over many a scene of projected mer∣riment.</P>
<P>Can you reckon that to be sincere joy,
which is liable to be interrupted and mingled
with so many sensations of the most disa∣greeable
nature? In the cup of intemper∣ance,
or in the tumult of loose society, the
man of pleasure studies to drown them.
But often his efforts are vain. When he
pushes to the utmost his scenes of criminal
revelry, they will carry the resemblance of
Belshazzar's feast; at which, while the im∣pious
monarch was drinking amongst his
lords and concubines, he beheld the fingers
of a man's hand-writing in unknown cha∣racters
<PB N="283" REF="294"/>
on the wall over against him; <HI>and
his countenance changed, and his heart sunk
within him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel, v. 5.</NOTE>. Thus, in the midst of riot,
imagined spectres have been known to
haunt the man of guilty pleasure. He sees
hands coming forth to write on the wall
against him. The very portraits of his
ancestors which hang in his hall, appear to
him to look with frowning aspect, and to
upbraid him with wasting in licentious
pleasures the fortune which their honour∣able
labours or virtuous industry had ac∣quired.
—Of all the classes of sinners, it has
been found, that none are so liable, in some
period of their lives, or at least when life
is drawing to its close, to be smitten with
severe remorse, as those who have sacri∣ficed
to pleasure all the calls of conscience
and of duty.</P>
<P>LET us consider, in the last place, how un∣suitable
a life of dissipation and pleasure is to
the condition of man in this world, and how
<PB N="284" REF="295"/>
injurious to the interests of society. In the
world, we are surrounded with scenes of dis∣tress.
We behold the greatest part of the
human race doomed to hard labour and penu∣rious
subsistence. We hear the cries of indi∣gence.
We know that every day thousands
are yielding up their breath, and thousands
are attending their dying friends. Our own
lives are fleeting fast away. Flourishing as
our state may at present seem, we know
there is but a step between us and death.
The youngest and the healthiest cannot tell
whether they may not, within the space of
a few days, be called to undergo the judg∣ment
of God.—Is this a time, is this a
place, where no other thing is to be pur∣sued
but giddy amusement and perpetual
pleasure?—Have you, my friends, who
are spending your days in this wanton abuse
of prosperity, no sense of the unsuitableness
of such conduct to the condition of mortal
man? Do you see nothing in the state of
human life to chasten and temper your
mirth; to bring serious reflexions home to
your bosom; to admonish you that it is
<PB N="285" REF="296"/>
better to go sometimes <HI>to the house of
mourning,</HI> than to dwell always <HI>in the house
of feasting?—</HI> Do you feel no compunc∣tion
at the thought that, by your luxury
and extravagance, you are adding to the
scenes of sorrow which already abound in
this afflicted world? For you, and your fol∣lies,
the aged parent, or the respectable re∣lation,
mourn. To supply the oppressive
demands of your pleasures, families are
driven from their habitations, and left to
poverty and want. Your mirth forces the
widow and the fatherless to weep.—At
the same time, you are scattering poison in
society around you. You are corrupting
the public manners by the life which you
lead. You are propagating follies and
vices; and by the example which you set,
are ens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring many to follow you into ruin.
—Consider with how much discentent
and indignation the poorer classes of men,
all the while, behold you. Especially, if in
times of scarcity and of war, such as those
in which I now write, they see you in∣dulging
in wastefulness and thoughtless pro∣fusion,
<PB N="286" REF="297"/>
when they and their families, are
not able to earn their bread. As long as
wealth is properly employed, persons in
low situation naturally look up to their
superiours with respect. They rest con∣tented
in their station. They are even
disposed to bless the hand which fur∣nishes
them with employment on rea∣sonable
terms, and occasionally dispenses
seasonable relief. But if they feel them∣selves
oppressed merely that a few may
be enabled to squander at pleasure, and
to revel in wasteful excess, their discontents
are not easily suppressed. With sullen
murmurs they issue from their impo∣verished
habitations, prepared for every evil
work.</P>
<P>SUCH are some of the consequences
which flow from dissipation and the in∣temperate
love of pleasure. Let not the
effect of what has been said be frustrated
by this evasion, that although the descrip∣tions
which have been given be just and
true, yet they are applicable only to such
<PB N="287" REF="298"/>
as have carried their pursuit of pleasure to
the most criminal excess; a class, in which
few, if any, will admit that they deserve
to be ranked.—They who are only begin∣ning
the course of vicious pleasure, and who
sin within prescribed bounds, may reckon
with certainty on their bearing a share of
the evils and miseries which I have de∣scribed.
Not only so, but having once
entered on an irregular course, they cannot
tell where they are to stop. They have
drunk from the cup of the enchantress; and
being fairly brought within the magic circle,
their powers of reflection are laid asleep,
and to make an escape may not be in their
power.</P>
<P>To some, it may perhaps appear, that
the whole strain of this discourse refers
only to the rich and the great; and that
persons of moderate fortune, and of the
middle ranks of life, who form the great
body of society, have little or no concern
in it. But this is entirely a mistake. Splen∣did
fortune, and high birth or rank, afford,
beyond doubt, the strongest and most fre∣quent
<PB N="288" REF="299"/>
temptations to the loose indulgence
of every enjoyment. But throughout all
ranks the danger extends of being misled
by pleasure in some of its forms. In this
country, where wealth and abundance are
so much diffused over all stations; where
it is well known that the inferiour orders
of men are perpetually pressing upon those
who are above them, and following them
in their manners, a life of dissipation is
perhaps not less frequent among the mid∣dle
than among the higher classes of so∣ciety.
The modes of amusement may not
be so refined. The entertainments and
pleasures may be of a grosser kind. But
in many an inferiour circle, there prevails
as much love of pomp and show, as much
proportional extravagance in expence, as
much rivalry in the competition of passions
and pleasures, as in the most fashionable and
courtly assemblies. Sober reflections are as
much laid aside; the gratification of vanity,
and the indulgence of pleasure, are pur∣sued
with equal eagerness.—Let us there∣fore,
my brethren, in whatever rank of
<PB N="289" REF="300"/>
life we are placed, proceed upon this as
our great principle, that to serve God, to
attend to the serious cares of life, and to
discharge faithfully the duties of our station,
ought to be the first concern of every man
who wishes to be wise and happy; that
amusement and pleasure are to be con∣sidered
as the relaxation, not the business, of
life; and that if from those sentiments we
depart, and give ourselves up to pleasure as
our only object, <HI>even in laughter the heart
shall be sorrowful, and the end of our mirth
shall be heaviness.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Conscience void of Offence.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ACTS, xxiv. 16.</BIBL>
<Q>Herein do I exercise myself, to have always
a conscience void of offence toward God
and toward men.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words were spoken by the
Apostle Paul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE> in the course of that
manly and spirited defence which he made
for himself, when accused of sedition and
impiety before Felix, the Roman Gover∣nour.
He vindicates himself from the
charges brought against him; but boldly
avows his principles, conceals no part he
had acted, gives up no doctrine he had
<PB N="291" REF="302"/>
taught, and, with the firm consciousness of
innocence, appeals to his enemies them∣selves
for the unblemished integrity of his
life and character.</P>
<P>To maintain <HI>always a conscience void of
offence toward God and toward men,</HI> is a
degree of virtue, to which, in its full extent,
none can lay claim. For who is there
among the sons of men that can pretend,
on every occasion, throughout his whole
life, to have preserved a faultless conduct?
How few days, indeed, go over our heads
wherein something does not pass, in which
our behaviour has not been altogether cor∣rect,
or free from every offence? In the
present imbecility and fallen state of human
nature, he is the worthiest person who is
guilty of the fewest offences towards God
or towards man. But though the character
referred to in the text be not attainable
by us in a complete degree, it is the cha∣racter
to which we must all study to ap∣proach;
to come as near to it as the weak∣ness
of our nature admits; so that neither
in piety towards God, nor in social duties
<PB N="292" REF="303"/>
towards men, we may be found remarkably
desicient.—You will observe, that this
great Apostle does not boast of having
fully attained to a conscience void of every
offence. His words are, that <HI>herein he
exercised himself;</HI> that is, this was his object
and his study, to this he formed and trained
himself, to have <HI>always a conscience void
of offence towards God and men.</HI>—As∣suredly,
there is nothing in human life
more amiable and respectable than such a
character. Wherever it appears, it com∣mands
universal reverence in every station,
whether high or low. It is indeed what
all men would wish to gain; at least, they
wish that others should believe them to
possess it. Even the most corrupted look
to it, from afar, with a sigh; and however
obliged to condemn themselves for having
fallen short of it, cannot help esteeming
and respecting others who are dignified by
the attainment of it.—Let us then con∣sider,
fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, what is implied in <HI>exercising</HI>
or forming ourselves to maintain the con∣science
void of offence; and next, what the
<PB N="293" REF="304"/>
effects will be of having, in some degree,
attained it.</P>
<P>I. IN <HI>exercising</HI> ourselves for this purpose,
our first care must be to have our conscience
well informed, or properly instructed, as to
what is, or is not, real ground of offence to∣wards
God or towards men. Conscience is
the guide, or the enlightening and directing
principle of conduct; and as our Saviour
has warned us, <HI>If the light which is in thee
be darkness, how great will that darkness
be?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi. 23.</NOTE>? If that which should guide us be
itself misled, how widely must we wander
astray?—There are two extremes here, to
each of which, different sets of men are
apt erroneously to incline. One set of men
are apt to be minutely serupulous about
matters of smaller importance; <HI>tithing,</HI> as
the Scripture describes them, <HI>mint, anise,
and cumin, while they neglect the weightier
matters of the law.</HI> Punctual in their ob∣servance
of all the forms and ceremonies
<PB N="294" REF="305"/>
of religion, they hope by this means to
compensate for allowing themselves in
unlawful pleasures or unrighteous gains.
Another, and perhaps a more numerous
set of men, err from loose casuistry in
matters of moral duty. They admit the
obligation they are under to virtuous prac∣tice;
but they lay the whole stress of virtue
on some particular good dispositions to
which their temper inclines them. On
these they highly value themselves; but
breaches of other parts of duty, they are
apt to consider as small and venial trans∣gressions.
They have balances of their
own, in which they weigh every trans∣gression;
and if any of the offences they
have committed, either against God or their
neighbour, weigh light in the scale of
fashion or general practice, they appear to
them as scarcely any offences at all.—Both
these extremes we must carefully guard
against; and study to regulate our conduct
by the pure unsophisticated laws of God;
resting our character neither on a strict
observance merely of the external forms of
<PB N="295" REF="306"/>
religion, nor on a partial regard to its moral
duties; but attending to all that God has
required from us as men and Christians.—
The truth is, such errors as I have pointed
out, always have their source in some corrup∣tion
of the heart. It is not from inability
to discover what they ought to do, that men
err in practice. It is from some oblique
regard to their interests or their pleasures,
to their reputation or their gain, that they
deviate into by-paths, while they affect to
assume some appearance of principle. Fair∣ness
and uprightness of mind are the chief
requisites for directing our conscience how
to avoid offences towards God or man.
He who, with an honest intention, seeks
in every case to know what it is his duty
to do, will seldom or never be at a loss to
discover it.</P>
<P>IN the next place, it belongs to every one
who studies to attain to a conscience void
of offence, to make reparation for whatever
wrong he is conscious of having formerly
done. This is the most difficult, but at
<PB N="296" REF="307"/>
the same time the most satisfactory test,
of our sincerity in desiring to have a clear
conscience before God and man. How
can he be sincere in this desire, who allows
himself to remain quiet, while loaded with
the sense that all he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow enjoys has been
obtained by injust <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fraud? If he con∣tinues,
without remorse, to fatten upon the
gains of unrighteousness; to feast on the
spoils of the industrious; to revel in luxu∣ries
purchased by oppression or treachery;
dare he hold up his face, and utter the
name of Conscience? <HI>Woe to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im that build∣eth
his house in unrighteousness, and his
chambers by wrong</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xxii. 13.</NOTE>. In the midst of his
stately habitation, <HI>the stone,</HI> in the expressive
language of Scripture, <HI>shall cry out of the
wall against him; and the beam out of the
timber shall answer it</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bak ii. 11.</NOTE>.—It may not be
always in a man's power to make exact
restitution of every unlawful gain he has
acquired; but to make reparation to the
utmost of his power, for every wrong <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<PB N="297" REF="308"/>
has done to others, is the duty of every
one who lays any claim to principle or
honesty. If this be entirely neglected, it
is the mark of a conscience that is become
dead to all sense of right and wrong. In
vain we pretend t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> clear our conscience,
by affecting to co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sate for fraud or
cruelty, either by acts of strict religious
homage towards God, or by some partial
virtues and shows of generosity towards
men. With respect to men, we ought to
learn that we must begin with being just,
before we can attempt to be generous.
With respect to God, we know that he
delights in <HI>mercy more than sacrifice;</HI> and
rejects with contempt the hypocritical
worshipper. <HI>I will come near to you in
judgment, faith the Lord; and I will be a
swift witness against those that oppress the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ireling, the widow, and the satherless; and
that turn aside the stranger from his right.—
The Lord will plead their cause, and spoil
the soul of those that spoiled them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malachi, iii. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="309"/>
AFTER making reparation for the wrongs
he has committed, the next study of every
one who is <HI>exercising himself to have the
conscience void of offence,</HI> should be to
guard against those particular snares which
have formerly led him into evil.—If, for
instance, covetousness has on many oc∣casions
tempted him to defraud or oppress,
that he might increase his worldly store,
it ought to be his first care to correct in
future this inordinate passion for wealth,
by bringing down in his estimation the
acquisitions of fortune to their proper
value; so that he may remain satisfied with
a moderate share of the world's goods, and
become sensible of what small importance
great riches are to real happiness. If am∣bition
has impelled him to rise into con∣sideration
by crooked policy and intrigues,
let him impress his mind with all the con∣siderations
that will show him the emptiness
and vanity of worldly honours. If a loose
and careless life has brought him into
habits of dissipation, and led him to neglect
those religious duties which he owed to
<PB N="299" REF="310"/>
his Maker, let him return to the regular
worship of God; and nourish an awful
fear and reverence of that Almighty Being,
on whom his all depends in time and eter∣nity.
—In this manner it must be his
care to begin, by eradicating those cor∣ruptions
which, on different occasions, have
tempted him to violate conscience. This
study to reform all known errors in former
life, will be one of the most satisfying marks
of a sincere design to preserve in future a
conscience void of offence. For if any of
the old vitiated parts of the disposition be
allowed to remain in their former state,
in vain will any man apply himself to a
thorough reformation of character. The
favourite ruling passion, if it be suffered to
keep its ascendant, will not fail to drag the
life after it.</P>
<P>IN the last place, in order to carry on
this discipline which I have been recom∣mending
for obtaining a good conscience,
it will be highly necessary, that we fre∣quently
examine ourselves, and bring our
<PB N="300" REF="311"/>
conduct under review. No day ought to
pass over our head, without some exercise
of this kind. Every evening before we
go to rest, we should subject to serutiny
the transactions in which we have been
engaged. “What have I done this day,
by which I may either have justly of∣sended
any man, or have shown neglect
of God? What duty have I transgressed?
Wherein have I omitted to act the part
which my Maker, or my fellow-creatures,
had a title to expect from me?”—Be
assured, my friends, that only by thus pre∣serving
conscience in the frequent exercise
of its natural jurisdiction, you can support
its rights. If you do not lead it in this
manner often to assume its due s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, its
authority will gradually decline. There
willbe no accuracy in your moral conduct.
Corruptions will grow upon you unawares.
You will forget that you are creatures ac∣countable
for your actions, to a higher tri∣bunal
than that of the world.—It is a
careless train of living, that is the general
ruin of mankind. It is not so much from
<PB N="301" REF="312"/>
having adopted evil principles that men
become wicked, as from having adopted
no principles at all. They follow their
inclinations, without examining whether
there be any principles which they ought
to form for regulating their conduct. The
chief corrective of this mischief is that
which has been suggested; by bringing
conscience into a frequent exercise of its
power, and thereby awakening its authority
over our life.—Bitterly it may at times re∣prove
us for our sins and follies. Sharply
it may sting. But those reproofs and those
stings are salutary in their effect; and
tend to prevent us from proceeding head∣long
in a downward course. If ever con∣science
become altogether dead and still,
the symptom is ominous of our having
contracted from hardened vice that mortal
lethargy, from which we are only to be
awakened at the day of judgment.</P>
<P>II. HAVING thus suggested some of the
particulars which appear most essential in
<HI>exercising</HI> or forming <HI>ourselves to attain to
<PB N="302" REF="313"/>
a conscience void of offence towards God and
men,</HI> I come next to recommend this dis∣cipline
by showing the happy effects it will
produce. These happy effects are mani∣fold;
to avoid prolixity, I shall comprise
them under two general heads. Such a
clear conscience sets us free from the ter∣rors
of another world; it exempts us from
a multitude of disquietudes in this.</P>
<P>First, the conscience void of offence tends
to procure freedom from the terrors of
another world. Many, I know, in the
gaiety of their hearts, pretend to make
light of terrors of this kind; yet nothing
is more certain, than that they are capable
of assailing and dismaying the stoutest heart.
Conscience is too great a power in the nature
of man to be altogether subdued. It may
for a time be repressed and kept dormant.
But conjunctures there are in human life
which awaken it; and when once awakened,
it flashes on the sinner's mind with all the
horrors of an invisible Ruler and a future
judgment. It has been so ordered by Pro∣vidence,
<PB N="303" REF="314"/>
that it is always in the evil day,
at the season when men stand most in
need of consolation and support, that con∣science
exerts its vengeance on the guilty.
I might mention what is suffered in the
lonely hours of solitude and silence, when
the sinner's mind is humbled and depressed
by some recent disgrace, or some disap∣pointment
in his criminal pursuits. But
let me only lead your thoughts to what
must await us all, when we shall have ar∣rived
at the decline of life; when we feel
the hand of death upon us, and cannot any
more flatter ourselves that it will long
delay giving the fatal stroke. <HI>Sufficient,</HI>
and more than sufficient, <HI>for that day will
be the evil thereof,</HI> even supposing that no∣thing
within shall alarm us with dark fore∣bodings
of what is to follow. But if at the
time when we are oppressed with sickness
or pain upon our bed, distressed perhaps
with the situation of our family and worldly
affairs, and just about to take the last fare∣well
of our friends and of all we have
ever loved on earth; if, in the midst of
<PB N="304" REF="315"/>
this scene of distress, we shall be also tor∣mented
with the thought of what is to
become of us in that next world which is
just opening to our view; if we depart
from life, conscious that we deserve punish∣ment
for the manner in which we have
lived; and dreading that the hour of our
being to receive that punishment is at hand;
such a state of complicated misery who
can endure? <HI>The spirit thus wounded</HI> and
bleeding, when it is going forth from the
body, <HI>who can bear?</HI></P>
<P>I by no means say, that he, who during
his life has taken the greatest care to pre∣serve
his conscience void of offence, can
upon that plea rest with confidence; or
upon this ground alone leave this life with∣out
uneasiness or fear. No man's con∣science
was ever entirely clear from all
reproach. We daily offend; and the best
have much reason to implore mercy and
forgiveness from their Judge. The whole
strain of the Gospel tends to humble and
depress those who vainly trust to their own
imperfect righteousness. It teaches us that
<PB N="305" REF="316"/>
the ultimate ground on which we are to
rest for acceptance with God, is the righteous∣ness
and merit of our great Redeemer.—
But this I say, and testify to you, that
the most satisfactory evidence you can
possess, of having an interest in the Re∣deemer's
merits, and being finally accepted
through him, must arise from the testimony
of a conscience, which you have studied to
keep <HI>void of offence towards God and to∣wards
men.</HI> This will be the best proof
of your belonging to the number of the
sons of God. It will be the witness of the
divine spirit within you; the day-star
arising in your hearts, and preparing the
approach of a more perfect day.—Without
the study of attaining a good conscience,
be assured, that all other grounds of hope
will prove fallacious: not the most servent
zeal, nor the highest pretences to intercourse
with God, will be of any avail. They will
have no more stability than the house built
on the sand, which, in the day of trial, falls
to the ground. He only whose conscience
bears witness to his faithfulness, his integrity,
and sincerity, in discharging all the duties
<PB N="306" REF="317"/>
of life, can, with a steady mind, and a firm
but humble trust in his Saviour, look for∣ward
to all that awaits him in a future
unknown world.</P>
<P>IN the next place, while the conscience
void of offence thus delivers us, in a great
degree, from the terrors of a future life, it
keeps us free, at the same time, from in∣numerable
disquietudes in this life. All
the offences for which conscience condemns
us, become, in one way or other, sources
of vexation. Never did any man long for∣sake
the straight and upright path, without
having cause to repent of it. Whether it
be pleasure, or interest, or ambition, that
leads him astray, he is always made to pay
dear for any supposed advantage he gains.
Warily and cautiously he may at first set
out, and lay many restraints on himself
against proceeding too far. But having
once forsaken conscience as his guide, his
passions and inclinations soon take the lead
of his conduct, and push him forward
rashly. One bad step betrays him into
another; till, in the end, he is overtaken,
<PB N="307" REF="318"/>
if not by poverty and disease, at least by
dishonour and shame, by the loss of friends,
and the forfeiture of general esteem. <HI>He
who walketh uprightly,</HI> has been always
sound to <HI>walk surely:</HI> while in the dark
and crooked paths of fraud, dishonesty, or
ignoble pleasure, a thousand forms of trouble
and disaster arise to meet us. In the mean
time, to a bad man, conscience will be al∣ways
an uneasy companion. In the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st
of his amusements, it will srequently break
in upon him with reproach. At night,
when he would go to rest, holding up to
him the deeds of the former day, putting
him in mind of what he has lost and what
he has incurred, it will make him often
ashamed, often afraid.—Cowardice and
baseness of mind are never failing conco∣mitants
of a guilty conscience. He who
is haunted by it, dares never stand forth to
the world, and appear in his own character.
He is reduced to be constantly studying
concealment, and living in disguise. He
must put on the smiling and open look,
when dark designs are brooding in his
<PB N="308" REF="319"/>
mind. Conscious of his own bad pur∣poses,
he looks with distrust on all who are
around him, and shrinks from the scrutiny
of every piercing eye. He sees, or fancies
that he sees, suspicion in many a counte∣nance;
and reads upbraiding in looks
where no upbraiding was meant. Often
he <HI>is in great fear, where no sear is.</HI></P>
<P>Very different from this, is the state of
the man whose conscience is void of offence.
He is manly and intrepid in every situa∣tion.
He has never seduced the innocent
by guilty arts. He has deluded no one with
false promises. He has ensnared no man
to trust him by a deceitful account of his
affairs; nor taken any advantage of the dis∣tresses
of others to enrich himself. With∣out
uneasiness he can look every man
boldly in the face; and say with the good
Prophet Samuel; <HI>Behold, here I am; wit∣ness
against me. Whose ox have I taken?
or, whose ass have I taken? or, whom
have I defra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded? Whom have I op∣pressed?
Of whose hand have I received
any bribe? Declare, and I will restore it to
<PB N="309" REF="320"/>
you</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel, xii. 3.</NOTE>. He who can thus take God and the
world to witness for his integrity, may de∣spise
popular accusation or reproach. Those
censures and rumours whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h are constantly
disquieting the man of guilty conscience,
pass by him unheeded. <HI>His witness is in
heaven; and his record is on high.</HI> Inno∣cence
and uprightness form a tenfold shield,
against which the darts of the world are
aimed in vain. Of neither God as his
Judge, nor of men as his companions, is
such a man afraid. With no unquiet nor
terrifying slumbers will his couch be
haunted. <HI>I will both lay me down in peace,
and sleep; for the Lord maketh me dwell in
safety.</HI></P>
<P>LET those considerations which have
been now briefly suggested, contribute to
render the character in the text, <HI>of a con∣science
void of offence towards God and man,</HI>
amiable and estimable in our eyes. If in its
fullest extent we cannot attain to it, let us
<PB N="310" REF="321"/>
at least endeavour to approach to it, and
herein with the great Apostle <HI>exercise our∣selves.</HI>
We may rest assured, that the more
we partake of this character, the happier
and more honourable shall our life be on
earth, and the nearer shall it bring us to
Heaven. Conscious of our innumerable
frailties, let it be our daily prayer to God,
that by his powerful spirit he would rectify
what is corrupted in our nature; would
guard us by his grace against the tempta∣tions
that surround us; <HI>keep us from the
path of the destroyer, and lead us in his way
everlasting.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Ascension of Christ.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Preached in the evening after the celebration of the
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.]</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE, xxiv. 50, 51.</BIBL>
<Q>And he led them out as far as to Bethany;
and he lift up his hands and blessed them:
And it came to pass while be blessed them,
he was parted from them and carried up
into Heaven.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE sacred Scriptures not only set before
us a complete rule of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIV.</NOTE> but give weight
and authority to the precepts they deliver,
by the information they communicate of
certain great and important facts, in which
<PB N="312" REF="323"/>
all the human race have a deep concern.
Of those facts one of the most illustrious
is the ascension of our Saviour to Heaven,
after having completed the work of our
redemption. This is a subject on which
it is at all times pleasing to a Christian to
meditate; but especially after the cele∣bration
of that solemn ordinance in which
we were this day engaged. We there re∣newed
the memorial of our Saviour suffer∣ing
and dying in the cause of mankind.
Let us now take part in his succeeding
triumphs. Let us with pleasure behold
him rising from the grave, as the conqueror
of death and hell, and ascending into
heaven, there to reign in glory, and to
act as the protector and guardian of his
people, to the end of time.—It will be
proper to begin with taking a particular
view of all the circumstances that attend∣ed
this memorable event in the history
of our Saviour's life; as they are related
in the text, compared with the accounts
of other Evangelists. The circumstances
will all be found to be both beautiful
<PB N="313" REF="324"/>
and sublime in themselves, and instructive
to us.</P>
<P>WE are informed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts, i. 3.</NOTE> that it was not until
forty days after his resurrection from the
grave, that this event took place. During
this space he had <HI>shown himself alive after
his passion, by many infallible proofs, being
often seen by his disciples, and conversing
with them of things pertaining to the king∣dom
of God.</HI> All being now concluded
which he had to do on earth; the guilt of
mankind having been expiated by his death,
and his Apostles fully instructed in the
part they were henceforth to act, and the
character they were to assume; one day, we
are told, he <HI>led them out of the city as far as
to Bethany.</HI>—With the utmost propriety
was this place selected for the scene of his
ascension. Near Bethany was the Mount
of Olives, to which our Lord was wont so
often to retire for the exercise of private
devotion; and there also was the garden
<PB N="314" REF="325"/>
of Gethsemane, where his sufferings com∣menced
with that agony in which his <HI>soul
was exceeding sorrowful even unto death.</HI>
At the spot where his generous sufferings
on our account began, there also was his
glory to commence; and those fields which
so long had been his fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urite retreat, and
so often had been consecrated by him to
meditation and prayer, were now to be
dignified with his last and parting steps
towards heaven; a sort of symbol, of devo∣tion
and virtuous sufferings being steps that
prepare for ascent to heaven.—There, we
are told, <HI>He lift up his hands, and blessed
his disciples; and while he blessed them,
he was parted from them.</HI> How beautiful
is this attitude of our departing Lord! How
well did such a conclusion suit the rest
of his life! <HI>Having loved <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is own which
were in the world, he loved them to the end.</HI>
While he lived, he <HI>went about doing good:</HI>
He died, praying for his enemies; and
when he ascended into heaven, it was in
the act of lifting up his hands and blessing
his friends; like a dying parent giving his
<PB N="315" REF="326"/>
last benediction to his children and family.
A worthy pattern is here set before us, of
the manner in which every good man
should wish to spend his last moments, in
acts of devotion to God, and expressions
of kindness and affection to his friends.—
While our Saviour was thus employed, he
was <HI>parted from his disciples; a cloud,</HI> it is
said, <HI>received him cut of their sight</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts, i. 9.</NOTE>, <HI>and he
was carried up into heaven.</HI> Here were no
whirlwinds, no thunders, no chariots of
fire. Supernatural appearances of old, had
been accompanied with majesty of a terrible
kind. The law was given in the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st
of lightnings and thunders. Elijah was
caught up into heaven in a fiery chariot.
But the Saviour of the world was gently
<HI>received up in a cloud;</HI> with that sort of meek
and calm magnificence, which bespeaks the
peaceful genius of the Gospel and its Author.
—Angels likewise assisted at this so∣lemnity,
as in every dispensation friendly
to mankind these benevolent spirits are re∣presented
<PB N="316" REF="327"/>
as taking part. At the creation
of the world, <HI>the morning stars,</HI> it is said,
<HI>sang together, and all the sons of God shouted
for joy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job, xxxviii. 7.</NOTE>. At the birth of our Lord, we
hear of their songs of praise and joy; we
find them present at his resurrection from
the dead; and now again at his ascension
into heaven. <HI>While his disciples looked sted∣fastly
towards heaven, as he went up, behold,
two men stood by them in white apparel;
which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand
ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus
which is taken up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye have seen
him go into heaven</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts, i. 10, 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH were the circumstances which
accompanied that great and signal event
of Christ's ascension into heaven; all of
them very solemn and striking, and calcu∣lated
to leave a deep impression on the
minds of his disciples.—Let us now pro∣ceed
to consider the ends and purposes of
<PB N="317" REF="328"/>
our Saviour's ascension, as far as they are
revealed and made known to us; and, to∣gether
with them, the effects which ought
thereby to be produced on our minds.</P>
<P>IN the first place, by our Saviour's ascen∣sion
into heaven, it was made to appear
that the great design for which he de∣scended
to the earth was completely ful∣filled.
A solemn attestation was thus given
by God, to the virtue and efficacy of that
great sacrifice which he offered by his
death for the sins of the world: It was de∣clared
that, in consideration of the high
merits and generous sufferings of the Son
of God, pardon and grace were to be
extended to the fallen race of men. There∣fore,
<HI>God raised him up from the dead, and
gave him glory, that our faith and hope might
stand in God.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, the ascension of our Lord is to be
considered as a display from heaven of the
olive branch to mankind. It is a most au∣gust
ratification of that covenant of grace,
on which are founded all our hopes of
<PB N="318" REF="329"/>
acceptance with God. We lay under the
sentence of condemnation as an offending
guilty race, till Christ undertook our cause,
and by his resurrection and ascension proved
that he succeeded in what he had under∣taken.
As soon as he was received up
into heaven, and sat down at the right
hand of God, the terrors of the law were
withdrawn. Antient prophecies were
ful<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illed, which represented the coming of
the Messiah as the renovation of the world,
as the aera of declared grace and peace to
mankind. The ascension of Christ was the
signal of his triumph over all the powers
of darkness. Long they had meditated
our r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, and maintained the reign of
idolatry among the nations. But the pe∣riod
was now come when their power was
to be overthrown. When Christ, as it
was predicted of old by the inspired
Psalmist, <HI>ascended up on high, he led cap∣tivity
captive, and gave gifts unto men.</HI> He
then spoiled <HI>principalities and powers</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coleff. ii. 15.</NOTE>
<PB N="319" REF="330"/>
He <HI>destroyed him that had the power of
death, that is the devil</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. ii. 14.</NOTE>; and the <HI>gifts</HI>
which, as tokens of victory, he bestowed
among his followers, were no less than
peace, pardon, and eternal life.—While
our Lord's ascension thus serves to establish
our faith in the Gospel,</P>
<P>IT is, in the next place, to be viewed
by us, with respect to Christ himself, as
a merited restoration to his original felicity.
As the Son of God, all glory belonged to
him for ever. The divine nature could
neither suffer any real depression, nor re∣ceive
any additional advancement. But
it was as a man, that he appeared and acted
on earth; that he suffered and died. What
he had done in that character, enti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led him,
as a man, to the highest rewards. Ac∣cordingly
it is in this view of merited re∣compence,
that his ascension and exaltation
at the right hand of God, is always set
forth in Scripture. Because <HI>he made him∣self
of no reputation, and took upon him the
<PB N="320" REF="331"/>
form of a servant; and being found in sas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
as a man, he humbled himself, and became
obedient unto death, even the death of the
cross; therefore God hath highly exalted him,
and given him a name which is above every
name; that at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow—and every tongue confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
the Father</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philipp. ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. &amp;c.</NOTE>.—In this constitution of Pro∣vidence,
an illustrious testimony was de∣signed
to be given of God's regard and
love to eminent righteousness. <HI>We see Jesus,</HI>
as the Apostle speaks, <HI>for the suffering of
death crowned with glory and honour</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 9.</NOTE>.
We see signal pre-eminence made the re∣ward
of signal condescension for the sake
of mankind; and self-abasement and hu∣miliation
made the road to glory. We
are taught, in this great instance, that God
never deserts the cause that is his own, nor
leaves worth and piety to be finally op∣pressed;
though for a while he may allow
trials and hardships to be undergone by the
best men. No person could appear more
<PB N="321" REF="332"/>
neglected and forsaken by God, than our
Saviour was, for a season, when in the
hands of his foes. Important purposes of
Providence were, during that season, carried
on; but as soon as those purposes were
accomplished, God came forth in support
of righteousness and truth, and by the
high honours bestowed on Christ, established
his eternal triumph over all his foes.</P>
<P>While we thus view our Saviour's as∣cension
as a glorification justly merited on
his own account, we cannot but on our
part highly rejoice in it from a sense of
the obligations we lie under to him. De∣void
of every just and honourable senti∣ment
must he be, who partakes not with
cordial satisfaction in the success and
triumph of a generous benefactor, who,
for his sake, had exposed himself to much
distress and danger.—In that holy Sacrament
which we this day celebrated, we beheld our
blessed Saviour despised and rejected of
men; we saw him treated as the vilest of
malefactors, led to the hill of Golgotha
with scorn and contempt, and there under∣going
<PB N="322" REF="333"/>
all that the cruelty of his enemies could
contrive to inflict. All this we beheld him
patiently and cheerfully enduring for our sake,
in order to accomplish our redemption.—
Now, when at his next appearance we be∣hold
such a glorious revolution; when we
behold him rising from the dead, ascending
into the highest heavens, sitting down there
at the right hand of God, and all things
in heaven and earth made to bow before
him, shall not we, my brethren, with
thankful and devout hearts, partake joyfully
in his exaltation and felicity?—Thou,
O divine Benefactor! O illustrious Re∣storer
of the lost hopes and happiness of
mankind! Thou art most worthy to be
thus raised above all beings. Our sorrows
once were thine. <HI>For our transgressions
thou wert bruised; and for our iniquities,
wounded.</HI> Now, in thy joy we rejoice;
and in thine honours we triumph. We
with lifted hands will ever bless thee. Pros∣trate
at thy feet, we will join with all the
heavenly hosts in celebrating thy praises;
in ascribing to <HI>Him that loved us, and
<PB N="323" REF="334"/>
washed us from our sins in his own blood,</HI> all
power, and glory, and dominion for ever!</P>
<P>IN the third place, Christ ascended into
heaven that he might act there, in the
presence of God, as our High Priest and
Intercessor. This office which he per∣forms,
was pre-signified under the Jewish
dispensation, by the high priest entering
once every year, on the great day of atone∣ment,
into the holiest place in the temple,
and there sprinkling the blood of the sa∣crifice
before the mercy-seat. <HI>But Christ
being come, an High Priest of good things
to come, by a greater and more perfect ta∣bernacle
not made with bands, neither by
the blood of goats and calves, but by his own
blood, he entered in once into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oly place,
having obtained eternal redemption for us; be
is not entered into the holy places made with
hands, which are the figures of the true; but
into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaven itself, now to appear in the pre∣sence
of God for us.—There,</HI> we are told, <HI>he
ever liveth to make intercession for his
people</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 11, 12. 14. Heb. vii. 25.</NOTE>—By his appearing in the human
<PB N="324" REF="335"/>
nature, while he is acting as intercessor
for mankind, an everlasting memorial is
presented to the Almighty of the Re∣deemer's
love to men. That sacrifice which
was offered on Mount Calvary, still con∣tinues
to ascend before the throne; and
that blood which was shed on the cross,
flows for ever in the sight of God.</P>
<P>CONCERNING the nature of this inter∣cession,
which our Saviour is represented
as making in heaven, and his continuing to
appear in the human nature for that purpose,
I am aware that difficulties and objections
may be raised by some. I readily admit, that
the whole doctrine revealed to us in Scrip∣ture
relating to the incarnation of Christ,
the atonement made by his death, and the
nature of his intercession for us in heaven,
is of a mysterious kind. It is what we
on comprehend in a very imperfect man∣ner;
and when we attempt too particularly
to explain or discuss any of these doctrines,
we are apt <HI>to darken counsel by words
without knowledge</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job, xxxviii. 2.</NOTE>—Let us not however
<PB N="325" REF="336"/>
imagine that the mysterious nature of those
doctrines furnishes any just objection against
the truth of the christian revelation. It
must be considered, that this revelation pro∣fesses
to give us such a discovery of the
spiritual invisible world, and of the admi∣nistration
of the divine government, as was
proper to be at present communicated to us.
In such a revelation of things invisible and
divine, and which stretch far beyond the
reach of human knowledge or capacity,
it was naturally to be expected that matters
would occur which should be mysterious,
and incomprehensible by us. Indeed, it
would have been strange and incredible if
it had been otherwise; if nothing had ap∣peared
on such subjects, but what was level
to our apprehension.—In the present ma∣terial
system, in midst of which we live,
and where the objects that surround us are
continually exposed to the examination of
our senses, how many things occur that are
mysterious and unaccountable? The philo∣sopher,
age after age, has continued his
researches into matter. After all his re∣searches,
<PB N="326" REF="337"/>
will he, at this day, refuse to ac∣knowledge,
that, in material substances, qua∣lities
have been discovered, powers and
properties have been found, which it is
beyond his power to reconcile to the com∣monly
received laws and operations of mat∣ter,
and which he cannot bring within the
compass of any established system and
theory? Shall this philosopher then, who
finds himself so often baffled in his en∣quiries,
by meeting with wonders in matter
which he cannot explain, presume to reject
a religious system, merely because in treating
of an invisible world, and the admini∣stration
of government there carried on
by the Father of Spirits, particulars occur
which appear incomprehensible to him?—
My brethren, let us be a little more humble
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ober in our attempts to philosophise.
Let us be thankful, that having received a
revelation, which, upon rational grounds,
stands well attested and confirmed, the
mysterious doct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nes which occur in it are
all of them such as to be perfectly recon∣cilable
with godliness and virtue; nay,
<PB N="327" REF="338"/>
such as have a direct tendency to promote
the moral influence of virtue on the lives
of men; and to bring powerful consolation
to them under many troubles.</P>
<P>THIS is remarkably exemplified in that
doctrine of which we are now treating, of
the office performed by o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Lord upon his
ascension into heaven. A mediator and
intercessor with God, is what most nations
and religions have anxiously sought to ob∣tain.
It has been at all times the favourite
wish and hope of men; and from their
earnestness to have this wish gratified, they
contrived some form or other of mediation
and intercession, on which they rested; some
favourite hero, or saint, or tutelary subor∣dinate
god, through whose intervention
they sought to obtain favour from the Su∣preme
Governour of the universe. This
is an idea which we find prevailing under
most of the modes of Pagan worship. Men
were generally sensible that they were
guilty of offences against the Deity; that
their own services were insufficient to ap∣pease
<PB N="328" REF="339"/>
him; and that therefore they had no
title to expect his favour, unless some me∣diator
of high merit was to espouse their
interest and plead their cause.—This re∣lief,
which the bewildered nations sought
after in vain, is fully afforded us by the
gospel of Christ. A real mediator is there
revealed, invested with such characters as
give encouragement and satisfaction to
every pious worshipper. The divine nature
of which he is possessed, gives infinite merit
and efficacy to every cause which he under∣takes;
and his possessing, at the same time,
the human nature, gives us the justest
ground to trust, that with compassion and
tenderness he undertakes the cause of man∣kind.</P>
<P>The discovery therefore of Christ's acting
as our Intercessor in heaven, is in the
highest degree favourable to religion and
virtue. It is so far from being a doctrine
repugnant to the reason or to the natural
ideas and notions of mankind, that it ac∣cords,
as has been observed, in the general
view of it, with what has ever been their
<PB N="329" REF="340"/>
wish and their hope; and the evangelical
discovery of the true Mediator, while it
banishes all the superstition and idolatry
which heathen ignorance had attached to
a mediatory worship, fulfils to Christians
every purpose both of encouragement and
consolation. It encourages the humble vir∣tuous
man, who might be apt to look up
with distrust to the awful Majesty of
Heaven. It brings consolation to the pe∣nitent
returning sinner, from the belief that,
unworthy as he is in himself, Christ the
Saviour is worthy, by his powerful inter∣cession,
to procure his salvation.—What
plan of religion could have been given more
suited than this to the circumstances of
man, in his present state of weakness and
infirmity? What more animating to every
sincere worshipper?—Let us study to do
our best; and if our endeavours be faithful,
and our hearts be upright, we have an
advocate with the Father in heaven, on
whose intercession we can rely; One <HI>who
is able to save to the uttermost, all who come
unto God through him. We have not an
high priest which cannot be touched with the
<PB N="330" REF="341"/>
feeling of our infirmities; but who was
in all points tempted like as we are, yet
without sin. Let us therefore come boldly
to the throne of grace, that we may obtain
mercy, and find grace to help in time of
need</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 25.–iv. 15, 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the last place, our Saviour ascended
into heaven in order to exercise there the
office of our King, as well as of our High
Priest and Intercessor. His ascension was
a solemn investiture in that royal authority
with which he was to act as <HI>Head of the
Church,</HI> till the end of time. All power
in heaven and earth was committed to
him. In token of his being the Sovereign
of both worlds, in triumph he rose from
his earthly grave, and in triumph ascended
into heaven. <HI>Therefore let all the house of
Israel know assuredly, that God hath made
him both Lord and Christ</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts, ii. 36.</NOTE>. <HI>I have set my
king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will give
him the heathen for his inheritance, and the
uttermost parts of the earth for his possession</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm ii. 6. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="342"/>
This view of our Lord's ascension and
exaltation obviously commands, from all
Christians, the most profound reverence
and submission. No longer let the humble
appearance he made on earth, vilify him to
our apprehension. Never let the consider∣ation
of his grace and goodness as our In∣tercessor
in heaven, be separated from the
thoughts of that awful majesty with which
his ascension clothes him. With impunity
none can offend him. If all the heavenly
hosts adore him, if the whole universe obey
him, what must be the fate of those, who,
being of all creatures the most highly in∣debted
to his goodness, revolt against his
government, and refuse obedience to his
laws?</P>
<P>But while with awe and reverence the
ascension and regal character of our Saviour
is fitted to inspire us, it communicates also

—The same characters of wisdom and
power, of justice and mercy, which we
ascribe to the providence and dominion of
God the Father, belong, in their fullest
extent, to the kingdom and government of
Christ the Son of God. This peculiar satis∣faction
his government affords us, that in
the midst of sovereign authority, we know
that he still retains the same mild and com∣passionate
spirit which he showed as our
High Priest. The meanest of his subjects
is not overlooked by him. The inhabitant
of the most obscure cottage, equally as the
possessor of the most splendid palace, dwells
under his protection. He listens to the
prayer of the poor, and despises not the
services they yield him. The <HI>widow's
mite</HI> is in his sight an acceptable offering;
and even a <HI>cup of cold water given to a
disciple in his name,</HI> passes not without its
reward.—Hence the characters of his
regal administration cannot be better de∣scribed
than in the beautiful language of
the prophetical Psalmist: <HI>He shall judge the
people with righteousness and the poor with
<PB N="334" REF="345"/>
judgment. The righteous shall flourish in
his days. He shall save the children of the
needy, and break in pieces the oppressor. He
shall deliver the needy when be crieth; the
poor also, and him that hath no helper. His
name shall endure for ever. It shall be con∣tinued
as long as the sun. Men shall be
blessed in him; and all nations shall call him
blessed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxxii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE have now under several views con∣sidered
the ascension of Christ, and the
important purposes which were answered
by it. In going along, I have pointed out
some of the chief effects which ought to
be produced on us by this object of our
faith. Much more might be said on this
subject, did the bounds of a discourse permit
it. One improvement of the subject
which the sacred writers often point out,
must not be forgotten. <HI>If ye be risen with
Christ, seek those things which are above,
where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
Set your affections on things above, and not
<PB N="335" REF="346"/>
on things on the earth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coloff. iii. 1, 2.</NOTE>. A certain con∣formity
with Christ, their great leader, in all
the circumstances of his history, is in Scrip∣ture
exacted from Christians. As they
must <HI>die with him to sin,</HI> they must <HI>rise
with him unto newness of life;</HI> and with him
ascend in heart to heaven, and dwell in
their affections where he is. The elevated
hopes which Christ, by his resurrection and
ascension, has set before us, ought to inspire
Christians with suitable elevation of senti∣ment
above this present world.—As Christ
<HI>is in you the hope of glory, let every one who
hath this hope in him, purify himself as
Christ is pure</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John, iii. 3.</NOTE>. Let not the corrupt plea∣sures

appear, which belongs to those who have
such high connections. Christ, as your
<HI>forerunner,</HI> hath entered into the highest
heavens; Him, it is your part to follow,
in the paths of piety and virtue. In those

paths proceed with perseverance and con∣stancy,
animated by those words of your

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT cannot but occur to every one who
has read the New Testament, even in
a cursory manner, that there is nothing
more warmly and more frequently incul∣cated
in it, than peace and love, union and
—understanding among men. Were a
person to form to himself an idea of the
state of the christian world, merely from
reading our sacred books, and thence in∣ferring
how they would live who believed
<PB N="338" REF="349"/>
those books to be divine, he would draw,
in his fancy, the fairest picture of a happy
society: he would expect to meet with
nothing but concord, harmony, and order;
and to find the voice of clamour and con∣tention
for ever silent. But were such a
person, fond to be himself a witness and a
partaker of such a blissful state, to come
amongst us from afar, how miserably,
alas! would he be disappointed, when in
the actual conduct of Christians he disco∣vered
so little correspondence with the mild
and peaceful genius of their professed re∣ligion;
when he saw the fierce spirit of
contention o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en raging unrestrained in
publick; and in private, the intercourse of
men embittered, and society disordered and
convulsed with quarrels about trifles! Too
justly might he carry away with him this
opprobrious report, that surely those Chris∣tians
have no belief in that religion they
profess to hold sacred, seeing their practice
so openly contradicts it.</P>
<P>In order to prevent, as much as we can,
this reproach from attaching to us, let us
<PB N="339" REF="350"/>
now set ourselves to consider seriously the
importance and the advantages of <HI>living
peaceably with all men.</HI>—This duty may
be thought by some to possess a low rank
among the christian virtues, and the phrase
a <HI>peaceable man</HI> to express no more than a
very inferiour character. I admit that gen∣tleness,
candour, sensibility, and friendship<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Discourses on these virtues in the preceding
Volumes.</NOTE>,
express a higher degree of re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inement and
improvement in the disposition; and that
a good Christian ought to be distinguished
by active benevolence, and zeal for reme∣dying
the miseries and promoting the fe∣licity
of others. But let it be remembered,
that the love of peace is the foundation
of all those virtues. It is the first article
in the great christian doctrine of charity;
and its obligation is strict, in proportion as
its importance is obvious. <HI>Blessed are the
peace-makers; for they shall be called the
children of God</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 9.</NOTE>.—I shall first show what
is included in the precept of <HI>living peaceably
<PB N="340" REF="351"/>
with all men;</HI> and next, what arguments
recommend our obedience to this precept.</P>
<P>I. THIS precept implies, in the first place,
a sacred regard to the rules of justice, in
rendering to every man what is his due.
Without this first principle, there can be
no friendly commerce among mankind.
Justice is the basis on which all society
rests. Throw down its obligation, and at
that instant you banish peace from the
earth; you let rapine loose, and involve
all the tribes of men in perpetual hostility
and war. To live peaceably, therefore,
requires, as its first condition, that we con∣tent
ourselves with what is our own, and
never seek to encroach on the just rights
of our neighbour; that in our dealings,
we take no unfair advantage; but con∣scientiously
adhere to the great rule of
doing to others, according as we wish they
should do to us. It supposes that we never
knowingly abet a wrong cause, nor espouse
an unjust side, but always give our coun∣tenance
to what is fair and equal. We
<PB N="341" REF="352"/>
are never to disturb any man in the en∣joyment
of his lawful pleasure; nor to
hinder him from advancing his lawful pro∣fit.
But under a sense of our natural
equality, and of that mutual relation which
connects us together as men, we are to
carry on our private interest in consistency
with what is requisite for general order and
good. <HI>Render tribute to whom tribute is
due; fear to whom fear; honour to whom
honour. Covet not what is thy brother's.
Owe no man any thing, but to love one
another.</HI></P>
<P>IN the second place, the duty of living
peaceably, not only prohibits all acts of
open injustice, but requires us carefully to
avoid giving unnecessary provocation or
offence to others. When we consider from
what small beginnings discord often arises,
and to what astonishing heights from such
beginnings it will grow, we will see much
cause to watch with care over our words
and actions, in our intercourse with the
world. It ought to be an object of atten∣tion
<PB N="342" REF="353"/>
so to behave as never needlessly to
exasperate the passions of others. In par∣ticular,
we are to guard against all improper
liberties of speech, and contumelious re∣flections
on persons and characters.—
The man of peace is mild in his demeanour,
and inoffensive in his discourse. He ap∣pears
to despise no man. He is not fond
of contradicting and opposing, and is always
averse to censure and to blame. He never
erects himself into the character of a dic∣tator
in society. He never officiously seeks
to intermeddle in the affairs of others, nor
to pry into their secrets; and avoids every
occasion of disturbing the good will which
men appear to bear to one another.—
Opposite to this, stands the character of the
man of unpeac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able and quarrelsome spirit;
who, himself easily provoked by every
tris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, is continually offending and pro∣voking
others by the harshness of his be∣haviour.
He is loud in his censures, po∣sitive
in his opinions, and impatient of all
contradiction. He is a <HI>busy body in other
men's matters;</HI> descants on their characters,
<PB N="343" REF="354"/>
enquires into their conduct, and on the
authority of his own suspicions, assigns
what motives he pleases to their actions.
Into the violence of party-spirit he never
fails to enter deeply; and considently as∣cribes
the worst principles to all who differ
from him in opinion. Such persons are
the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of society, and the troublers of all
good order in human life. <HI>Let every man
study to be quiet,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>and to do
his own business. Who art thou that judgest
another man's servant? To his own master
he standeth or falleth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. iv. 11. Rom. xiv. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the third place, the study of peace
requires, that on some occasions we scruple
not to give up our own opinion, or even
to depart from our strict right, for the sake of
peace.—At the same time, for preventing
mistakes on this subject, it is proper to
observe, that a tame submission to violence
and wrongs, is not required by religion.
We are not to imagine that the love of
<PB N="344" REF="355"/>
peace is only another name for cowardice;
or that it suppresses every proper exertion
of a manly spirit. The expressions em∣ployed
in the text, <HI>if it be possible, as much
as lieth in you,</HI> plainly insinuate, that there
are cases in which it may not be in our
power to <HI>live peaceably with all men.</HI>
Every man is allowed to feel what is due
to himself and his own character, and is
entitled to support properly his own rights.
In many cases the welfare of society re∣quires
that the attacks of the violent be
checked and resisted.—What belongs to a
good and a wise man is, to look forward
coolly to the effects that are likely to follow
the rigorous prosecution of any private
rights of his own. If these appear to be
pregnant with mischiefs to the society with
which he is connected, in a much greater
proportion than any advantage they can
bring to himself, it then becomes his duty
rather quietly to suffer wrong, than to
kindle the flames of lasting discord. But
how many are there, who, having once
begun a claim, espoused a side, or engaged
<PB N="345" REF="356"/>
in a controversy, are determined to pursue
it to the last, let the consequences be what
they will? False notions of honour are
brought in to justify their passions. Pride
will not allow them to yield, or to make
the least concession, when the true point
of honour would have led to generous ac∣knowledgments
and condescension. They
never make the first advances to returning
reconciliation and peace. They are haughty
in their claims, and require great submi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion
before they can be appeased.—The
lover of peace, on the other hand, looks
upon men and manners in a milder and
softer light. He views them with a philo∣sophick,
or rather a christian eye. Con∣scious
that he himself has been often in
the wrong; sensible that offence is fre∣quently
thought to be given, where no
injury was intended; knowing that all men
are liable to be misled by false reports into
unjust suspicions of their neighbours; he
can pass over many things without disturb∣ance
or emotion, which, in more com∣bustible
tempers, would kindle a flame.
<PB N="346" REF="357"/>
In all publick matters in which he is en∣gaged,
he will not be pertinaciously adhesive
to every measure which he has once pro∣posed,
as if his honour were necessarily
engaged to carry it through. If he see
the passions of men beginning to rise and
swell, he will endeavour to allay the grow∣ing
storm. He will give up his favourite
schemes, he will yield to an opponent,
rather than become the cause of violent
embroilments; and, next to religion and
a good conscience, the cause of peace and
union will be to him most sacred and dear.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, our study of peace,
in order to be effectual, must be of an ex∣tensive
nature. It must not be limited to
those with whom by interest, by good
opinion, or by equality of station, we are
connected. <HI>Live peaceably with all men,</HI>
says the Apostle. No man is to be con∣temned
because he is mean, or to be treated
with incivility because he is one in whom
we have no concern. Even to those whom
we account bad men, the obligation of liv∣ing
<PB N="347" REF="358"/>
at peace extends. This is not incon∣sistent
with that just indignation which we
ought to bear against their crimes. Without
entering into any close connection with
them, without admitting them to be our
friends and companions, it is certainly pos∣sible
to live amongst them in a peaceable
manner. Human society is at present com∣posed
of a confused mixture of good and
evil men; and from our imperfect know∣ledge
of characters, it is often not easy to dis∣tinguish
the one class of men from the other.
We are commonly prejudiced in favour
of those who concur with us in our modes
of thinking; and are prone to look with
an evil eye on those who differ from us
in subjects of importance. But if all the
supposed blemishes of those with whom we
differ in opinion; if the heretical doctrines
which we ascribe to them, or the bad prin∣ciples
with which we charge them, were
su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficient to justify the breach of peace,
very little harmonious correspondence would
remain among men. Appearances of re∣ligious
zeal have been too often employed
<PB N="348" REF="359"/>
to cover the pride and ill-nature of turbu∣lent
persons.—The man of peace will
bear with many whose opinions or practices
he dislikes, without an open and violent
rupture. He will consider it as his duty
to gain upon them by mildness, and to
reclaim them as far as he can from what
is evil, by calm persuasion, rather than to
attempt reforming them by acrimony and
censure.—Neither indeed is it every
man's office to set up for a reformer of
the world. Every man, it is true, is bound
to promote reformation by his personal
example. But if he assume a superiority
to which he has no title; and with rude
and indiscreet zeal, administer reproofs, and
thrust himself forward into the concerns
of others, he is likely to do much more
hurt than good; to break the peace of the
world, without doing service to the cause of
true religion.</P>
<P>If it thus appears to be our duty to ex∣tend
our study of peace throughout the
wide sphere of all who are around us, it
will naturally occur that there is a certain
<PB N="349" REF="360"/>
narrower sphere within which this study
ought to be particularly cultivated; to∣wards
all those, I mean, with whom Nature
or Providence has joined us in close union,
whether by bonds of friendship, kindred,
and relation, or by the nearer ties of do∣mestick
and family connection. There, it
most highly concerns every one to put in
practice all the parts of that peaceable and
amicable behaviour which I before have
described; to guard against every occasion
of provocation and offence; to overlook
accidental starts of ill-humour; to put the
most favourable interpretation on words
and actions. The closer that men are
brought together, they must unavoidably
rub, at times, the more on one another.
The most delicate attentions are requisite,
of course, for preventing tempers being
ruffled, and peace being broken, by those
slight failings from which none are exempt.
It is within the circle of domestick life, that
the character of the man of peace will be
particularly distinguished as amiable; and
where he will most comfortably enjoy the
fruits of his happy disposition.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="361"/>
HAVING now explained the precept in
the text, and shown what is included in
living peaceably with all men, I come next to
suggest some considerations for recommend∣ing
this peaceable disposition.</P>
<P>LET us recollect, in the first place, as a
bond of union and peace, the natural re∣lation
which subsists among us all as men,
sprung from one father, connected by one
common nature, and by fellowship in the
same common necessities and wants; con∣nected
as Christians closer still, by acknow∣ledgment
of the same Lord, and partici∣pation
of the same divine hopes. Ought
lesser differences altogether to divide and
estrange those from one another, whom such
ancient and sacred bonds unite? In all
other cases, the remembrance of kindred,
or brotherhood, of a common parent, and
common family, tends to soften the harsher
feelings, and often has influence, when
feuds arise, to melt and overcome the heart.
Why should not a remembrance of the
same kind, have some effect with respect
to the great brotherhood of mankind?—
<PB N="351" REF="362"/>
How unnatural and shocking is it, if, on
occasion of some angry expression or trifling
affront, to which sudden passion or mis∣taken
report has given rise, a man shall de∣liberately
go forth with the barbarous pur∣pose
of plunging his sword into his brother's
breast? What a reproach to reason and hu∣manity,
that a ridiculous idea of honour, de∣rived
from times of Gothick grossness and
ignorance, should stain the annals of modern
life with so many tragical seenes of horror!</P>
<P>Let the sentiment of our natural con∣nection
with each other as men, dispose
us the more to peace, from a reflection on
our common failings, and the mutual al∣lowances
which those failings oblige us to
make. A sense of equity should here arise, to
prompt forbearance and forgiveness. Were
there any man who could say that he had
never, in the course of his life, suffered
himself to be transported by passion, or
given just ground of offence to any one,
such a man might have some plea for im∣patience,
when he received from others un∣reasonable
treatment. But if no such per∣fectly
<PB N="352" REF="363"/>
unexceptionable characters are to be
found, how unjust is it not to give to others
those allowances which we, in our turn, must
claim from them?—To our own failings
we are always blind. Our pride and self-conceit
render us quarrelsome and conten∣tious,
by nourishing a weak and childish
sensibility to every fancied point of our
own honour or interest, while they shut up
all regard to the honour or interest of our
brethren. From the high region of ima∣ginary
self-estimation, let us descend to
our own just and proper level. Let us
calmly reflect on the place we hold in so∣ciety,
and on the justice that is due to
others. From such reflections we will learn
to be more humble in our claims, and more
moderate in our pretensions; and many of
the causes of animosity and contention will
die away.</P>
<P>LET us consider, in the next place, how
trifling and inconsiderable, for the most
part, the causes are of contention and dis∣eord
among mankind, and how much they
<PB N="353" REF="364"/>
deserve to be overlooked by the wise and
the good. When we view the eagerness
with which contests are agitated in society,
and look to the bitterness and wrath they
so oft occasion, one would think that all
were at stake, and that there could be no
life, no happiness on earth, unless to him
who was victorious in the contest, And
yet, in how few instances has there been
any just ground for this mighty ferment
of spirits?—You have been slighted, per∣haps,
by a superiour; you have been un∣gratefully
treated by a friend; a rival has
over-reached you by fraud; or overcome
you by more powerful interest. Amidst
the bustle of life, amidst the interfering and
crossing of various pursuits and interests,
are not such incidents to be expected by
every one? Ought you not to have been
prepared for encountering them without
passion or violence, as evils belonging to
the common lot of humanity? As light
bodies are shaken and torn by every breath
of wind, while those that are solid resist
the blast; so it is only the little and mean
<PB N="354" REF="365"/>
mind that loses possession of itself on every
trifling provocation; while a great and
firm spirit keeps its place, and rests on a
basis of its own, unshaken by the common
disturbances of life.—Of what small mo∣ment
to your real happiness, are many of
those injuries which draw forth your re∣sentment?
They may affect in some de∣gree
your worldly interests; but can they
affect your true honour as a man? Can
they deprive you of peace of conscience,
of the satisfaction of having acted a right
part, of the pleasing sense of being esteemed
by men, and the hope of being rewarded
by God, for your generosity and forgive∣ness?—
In the moments of eager contention,
all is magnified and distorted in its appear∣ance.
A false light is thrown on every
object. Nothing appears to be what it
really is. But let the hour of violence pass
over; let the course of time bring for∣ward
recollection and calmness, and you will
wonder at your former violence. Objects
which once were so formidable, will then
have disappeared. A new scene has taken
<PB N="355" REF="366"/>
place; and the grounds of former conten∣tion
will seem as dreams of the night, which
have passed away.—Act then now the part
of a man, by anticipating that period of
coolness, which time will certainly bring.
You will then cease to break the peace of
society with your angry contentions. You
will show that magnanimity which belongs
to those who depend not for their hap∣piness
merely on the occurrences of the
world. <HI>He that is slow to anger, is better
than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit,
than he that taketh a city</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 32.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LET us now consider the different con∣sequences
of a contentious spirit, and of a
peaceable disposition, with respect to our
happiness and enjoyment. The founda∣tion
of happiness must certainly be laid
within our breasts. If one be pained and
uneasy there, external circumstances, how
flourishing soever, avail him nothing: And
what feelings are more uneasy and painful
<PB N="356" REF="367"/>
than the workings of four and angry pas∣sions?
Great and manifold as the natural
and unavoidable distresses of our present
state are, they are small in comparison of
the evils which men bring upon them∣selves,
and bring upon one another, by
variance and diseord. I speak not now of
public calamities, of faction and ambition
raging through the world, and hostile
armies laying waste the earth with desola∣tion
and bloodshed. Confining our views
solly to private life, how miserably is all
its comfort and order destroyed by those
jealousies, feuds, and animosities, that so
often break the peace of families, tear
asunder the bonds of friendship, and poison
all that social intercourse which men were
formed to entertain with one another?
From a small chink, which some rude
hand has opened, the bitter waters of strife
easily flow. But of this we may be as∣sured,
that a full portion of their bitterness
shall be tasted by him who has let them
forth. Never was any man active in dis∣quieting
others, who did not at the same
<PB N="357" REF="368"/>
time disquiet himself. While the tempest
which he has raised may be bursting on
his neighbour, he will be obliged to feel
the hurricane raging in his own breast:
and from his restles<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness, impatience, and
eagerness, joined with anxious trepidations
and fears, will often suffer more than all
that he can ins<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ict on his adversary.</P>
<P>From such painful sensations the man of
peace is free. A mild, unruffled, self-pos∣sessing
mind is a blessing more important
to real felicity, than all that can be gained
by the triumphant issue of some violent
contest. Never was a truer axiom pro∣nounced
by any mouth, than what was
uttered by the wise man of old; <HI>Better is
a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
stalled ox and hatred therewith</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xv. 17.</NOTE>. With a
scanty provision of the good things of this
world, a wise man may be contented and
happy; but without peace, all the luxuries
of the rich lose their relish.—While
among the sons of strife all is tempestuous
<PB N="358" REF="369"/>
and loud; the smooth stream, the serene
atmosphere, the mild zephyr, are the proper
emblems of a gentle temper, and a peace∣able
life. Nor is this merely a poetical
allusion. The ordinary language of dis∣course,
where the terms are so often em∣ployed
of a storm of passion, a calm mind,
a rough or a fiery temper, plainly show
that all men are sensible of some analogy
between a peaceable disposition, and those
scenes of external nature that are uni∣versally
agreeable and pleasant. The con∣dition
of those who are living in unity
with their brethren, is likened by the
psalmist David <HI>to the dew of Herm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n; the
dew that descended on the mountains of
Zion, where the Lord commanded the bless∣ing,
even life for evermore</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxxxiii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While the man of this disposition is
happy within himself, let it not be for∣gotten,
that he is at the same time gaining
on all around him. From the quarrelsome
and rude, all men naturally recoil; and,
<PB N="359" REF="370"/>
except when necessity obliges them, avoid
their intercourse. But the lover of peace
conciliates gener<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l good-will; and is both
respected and beloved. Though no abso∣lute
security can be devised against the
malice and injustice of the world, yet, for
the most part, it will be found that there is
no more effectual guard against violence,
no surer road to a safe enjoyment of life,
than an established character for benignity
and regard to peace. The man of this
character, if unjustly attacked, will have
many to defend him and take his part. In
his prosperity he will be unenvied, and his
misfortunes will be alleviated by general
sympathy.</P>
<P>LET us consider, in the last place, how
strongly the precept in the text is enforced
by the most sacred religious obligations.
You all know what a high place charity,
under all its forms of meekness, forbearance,
and forgiveness, possesses in the Christian
system. To bring authorities in support
of this, were to recite a great part of the
<PB N="360" REF="371"/>
New Testament before you.—The God
whom we worship, is known by the title
of <HI>the God of Peace.</HI> That evil spirit who
is opposite to him, is described with all
the characters which express malignity;
<HI>the enemy, the accuser, the liar, the destroyer.</HI>
When Christ came into the world as our
Saviour, he is styled the Prince of Peace.
The blessings which were proclaimed at
his birth were, <HI>peace upon earth, and good∣will
towards men.</HI> The whole of his life
was one continued exemplification of all
the virtues that characterize the meek, the
peaceable, and forgiving spirit. Never was
any one's temper tried by so many and so
great provocations; never did any one
retain, under these provocations, such a
calm and unruf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led tenour of mind; inso∣much
that the Apostle Paul, on an occasion
of earnest intreaty to the Corinthians, <HI>be∣seeches</HI>
them <HI>by the weakness and gentleness
of Christ,</HI> as the most noted and well-known
parts of his character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Corinth. x. 1.</NOTE>. What can be said
<PB N="361" REF="372"/>
higher of any virtue than that it is the qua∣lity,
under the denomination of which,
the Son of God chose to be known when
he dwelt on earth? Let us add, that it is
also the distinguishing character of God's
own spirit. The Holy Ghost is called the
<HI>Spirit of Peace. Meekness, gentleness, and
long suffering,</HI> are expressly denominated
<HI>his fruits;</HI> and on a certain memorable
occasion, his appearance was marked with
signals that express the mild and quiet
spirit as distinguished from violence. When
Elijah the great prophet was called to go
forth and stand before the Lord, <HI>behold a
great and strong wind rent the mountains,
but the Lord was not in the wina; and after
the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was
not in the earthquake; and after the earth∣quake
a fire, but the Lord was not in the
fire. After that, there came forth a still
small voice. When Elijah heard it,</HI> he
knew the symbol of God's spirit; <HI>he
wrapped his face in his mantle,</HI> and wor∣shipped<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 King<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, xix. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="373"/>
AFTER so many testimonies given by the
sacred writings to the high importance of
a meek and peaceable spirit, what shall we
think of those, who, in their system of
religion, make slight account of this virtue;
who are ready to quarrel with others on the
most trifling occasions; who are conti∣nually
disquieting their families by peevish∣ness
and ill-humour; and by malignant
reports, ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng dissension among friends
and neighbours? Can any claims to sound
belief, or any supposed attainments of
grace, supply the defect of so cardinal a
virtue as charity and love?—Let such
persons particularly bethink themselves how
little the spirit which they possess, sits them
for the kingdom of heaven, or rather how
far it removes them from the just hope of
ever entering into it. Hell is the proper
region of enmity and strife. There dwell
unpeaceable and siery spirits, in the midst
of mutual hatred, wrath, and tumult. But
the kingdom of heaven is the kingdom
of peace. There, <HI>charity never saileth.</HI>
There, reigneth the God of Love; and
<PB N="363" REF="374"/>
in his presence, all the blessed inhabit∣ants
are of one heart and one soul. No
string can ever be heard to jar in that ce∣lestial
harmony; and therefore the con∣tentious
and violent are, both by their own
nature and by God's decree, for ever ex∣cluded
from the heavenly society.—As the
best preparation for those blessed mansions,
let us ever keep in view that direction
given by an Apostle; <HI>Follow peace with all
men, and holiness, without which no man
shall see the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 14.</NOTE>. To the cultivation of
amity and <HI>peace</HI> in all our social intercourse,
let us join <HI>holiness;</HI> that is, piety and active
virtue: and thus we shall pass our days com∣fortably
and honourably on earth, and at
the conclusion of our days, be admitted to
dwell among saints and angels, and <HI>to see
the Lord.</HI></P>

<Q>—<HI>The joy of the Lord is your strength.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NEHEMIAH, the Governour of Jeru∣salem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVI.</NOTE>
having assembled the people
of Israel immediately after their return
from the captivity of Babylon, made the
book of the law be brought forth and read
before them. On hearing the words of the
book of the law, we are informed that <HI>all
the people wept;</HI> humbled and cast down
by the sense of their present weak and
forlorn condition, compared with the flou∣rishing
<PB N="365" REF="376"/>
state of their ancestors. Nehemiah
sought to raise their spirits from this de∣jection;
and exhorts them to prepare them∣selves
for serving the God of their fathers
with a cheerful mind; <HI>for,</HI> says he, <HI>the joy
of the Lord is your strength.</HI></P>
<P>Abstracted from the occasion on which
the words were spoken, they contain an
important truth, which I now purpose to
illustrate; that to the nature of true re∣ligion
there belongs an inward joy, which
animates, strengthens, and supports virtue.
The illustration of this position will require
that I should show, in the first place, that
in the practice of religious duties there is
found an inward joy, here styled the <HI>joy
of the Lord;</HI> and in the next place, that
this joy is justly denominated the <HI>strength</HI>
of the righteous.</P>
<P>I. JOY is a word of various signification.
By men of the world, it is often used to
express those flashes of mirth which arise
from irregular indulgences of social plea∣sure;
and of which it is said by the wise
<PB N="366" REF="377"/>
man, that in such <HI>laughter the heart is sor∣rowful,
and the end of that mirth is hea∣viness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 13.</NOTE>.
It will be easily understood that
the <HI>joy</HI> here mentioned partakes of nothing
akin to this; but signifies a tranquil and
placid joy, an inward complacency and sa∣tisfaction,
accompanying the practice of
virtue, and the discharge of every part of
our duty. A joy of this kind is what we
assert to belong to every part of religion;
to characterise religion wherever it is ge∣nuine,
and to be essential to its nature.—In
order to ascertain this, let us consider the
disposition of a good man with respect to
God; with respect to his neighbours; and
with respect to the government of his
own mind.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider in what manner re∣ligion
requires that a good man should
stand affected towards God, it will pre∣sently
appear that rational enlightened piety
opens such views of him as must commu∣nicate
<PB N="367" REF="378"/>
joy. It presents him, not as an
awful unknown Sovereign, but as the
Father of the universe, the Lover and Pro∣tector
of righteousness, under whose go∣vernment
all the interests of the virtuous
are, safe. With delight the good man
traces the Creator throughout all his works,
and beholds them every where reflecting
some image of his supreme perfection. In
the morning dawn, the noontide glory, and
the evening shade; in the fields, the moun∣tains,
and the flood, where worldly men
behold nothing but a dead, uninteresting
scene; every object is enlivened and ani∣mated
to him by the presence of God.
Amidst that divine presence he dwells with
reverence, but without terror. Conscious
of the uprightness of his own intentions,
and of the sidelity of his heart to God, he
considers himself, by night and by day, as
under the protection of an invisible guar∣dian.
He <HI>lifts up his eyes to the hills from
whence cometh his aid;</HI> and commits him∣self
without distrust to the <HI>Keeper of Israel,
who never slumbers nor sleeps.</HI> He listens
<PB N="368" REF="379"/>
to the gracious promises of his word. With
comfort he receives the declarations of his
mercy to mankind through a Great Re∣deemer;
in virtue of whose atonement pro∣vision
is made for pardon to human infir∣mities,
and for our reception in the end
into a happier world. All the various de∣votional
exercises of faith and trust in God,
all the cordial effusions of love and gratitude
to this Supreme Benefactor in the acts of
prayer and praise, afford scope to those
emotions of the heart which are of the
most pleasing kind; and which diffuse a
gentle and softening tenderness over the af∣fections.
In a word, a truly pious man,
who has always before him an object so
sublime and interesting as this great Father
of the universe, on whom his thoughts can
dwell with satisfaction, may be truly said
to partake highly in the <HI>joy of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But it may here be objected, are there
no mortifications and griefs that particu∣larly
belong to piety? What shall we say
to the tear of repentance, and to that hu∣miliation
of confession and remorse, which
<PB N="369" REF="380"/>
may, at times, be incumbent on the most
pious, in this state of human infirmity?—
To this I reply, first, that although there
may be seasons of grief and dejection in
a course of piety, yet this is not inconsistent
with the joy of the Lord, being, on the
whole, the predominant character of a
good man's state; as it is impossible that,
during this life, perpetual brightness can
remain in any quarter, without some dark
cloud. But I must observe next, that even
the penitential sorrows and relentings of a
pious heart, are not without their own
satisfactions. A certain degree of pleasure
is mingled with the tears which the return∣ing
offender sheds, in the hours of com∣punction;
the ingenuous contrition that he
feels, relieves his heart, at the same time
that it gives it pain. If we attend to the
workings of human nature on other oc∣casions,
we shall find that it is no unusual
thing for a secret mysterious pleasure to be
mixed with painful feelings. This we all
know to be the case in those exercises of
pity and commiseration to which we are
<PB N="370" REF="381"/>
led by sympathy with the afflicted. We
grieve and are pained for their distress;
yet we chuse to indulge that grief; satis∣faction
is felt in the indulgence; and we
are unwillingly separated from the object
which has occasioned this painful, but
tender sympathy. A mixture somewhat
similar, of pleasure and pain, takes place in
the sentiments of penitential sorrow, which
good men sometimes feel. In the midst
of their distress, they are soothed by an
internal consciousness, that they are affected
as it becomes them to be; that they feel
as they ought to feel; and they are gra∣dually
relieved by the hope rising in their
breast, of finding mercy and acceptance with
their Creator and Redeemer. Where the
mind is properly instructed in religion, it
will not long be left in a state of over∣whelming
dejection, but will return to
tranquillity, and repossess again the <HI>joy of
the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we consider, next, the disposition
of a good man towards his fellow-creatures,
<PB N="371" REF="382"/>
we shall find here the joy of the Lord
exerting its in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luence fully. That mild and
benevolent temper to which he is formed
by virtue and piety; a temper that is free
from envious and malignant passions, and
that can look with the eye of candour and
humanity on surrounding characters, is a
constant spring of cheerfulness and serenity.
Indeed, if there be joy at all in human life,
it is, perhaps, in this state of the mind that it
is most sensibly felt, and felt with the least
check or allay. It is truly said, <HI>to the wicked
there is no peace.</HI> In proportion as any
one of the bad passions predominates in the
breast, it never fails, in the same proportion,
to corrode the heart, and to shed over all
the comforts of life a poisonous and bane∣ful
influence. Whereas all those exercises
of friendship, compassion, and generosity,
which are essential to the disposition of a
virtuous man, are to him lively enjoyments
of pleasure in themselves, and increase the
satisfaction which he tastes in all the other
innocent pleasures of life. He knows that
he enjoys them along with the good-will
<PB N="372" REF="383"/>
and the blessings of all to whom he has
studied to do good. When he can cheer
the dejected or gladden the sorrowful, he
is cheered and gladdened himself. If his
circumstances allow him not to do all the
good he wishes to have done, yet in the
consciousness of good intentions there is
always an inward satisfaction; and in those
lesser offices of kindness and humanity
which are within the sphere of every man
to perform, he enjoys innumerable oc∣casions
of being pleased and happy.</P>
<P>WITH respect to that part of religion
which consists in the government of a man's
own mind, of his passions and desires, it
may be thought that much joy is not to be
expected. For there religion appears to
lay on a severe and restraining hand. Strict
temperance and self-denial are often requi∣site;
and much is on some occasions
abridged, of what is apt to be reckoned the
full and free enjoyment of life. Yet, here
also it will be found, that the <HI>joy of the Lord</HI>
takes place. To a person just reclaimed
<PB N="373" REF="384"/>
from the excesses of sensual indulgence, the
restraints imposed by virtue will, at first,
appear uncouth and mortifying. But let
him begin to be accustomed to a regular
life, and his taste will soon be rect<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied, and
his feelings will change. In purity, tem∣perance,
and self-government, there is
found a satisfaction in the mind, similar to
what results from the enjoyment of perfect
health in the body. A man is then con∣scious that all is found within. There is
nothing that gnaws his spirit; that makes
him ashamed of himself; or discomposes
his calm and orderly enjoyment of life.
His conscience testifies that he is acting
honourably. He enjoys the satisfaction of
being master of himself. He feels that
no man can accuse him of degrading his
character by base pleasures or low pursuits;
and knows that he will be honoured and
esteemed by those whose honour and es∣teem
he would most desire; all which are
sensations most pleasing and gratifying to
every human heart.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="385"/>
FROM this slight sketch it plainly appears,
that there is an inward satisfaction, justly
termed <HI>the joy of the Lord,</HI> which runs
through all the parts of religion. This is
a very different view of religion from what
is entertained by those who consider it as
a state of perpetual penance; to which its
votaries unwillingly submit, merely from
the dread of punishment in hell; and who
bargain for the rewards of another world,
by a renunciation of all that is agreeable
or comfortable to man in this world. Such
conceptions of religion are contradicted by
the experience of every truly virtuous man,
and are directly opposite to the views of
religion given us in the word of God;
wherein its ways are termed <HI>ways of plea∣santness
and paths of peace;</HI> and where we
are assured that <HI>in the keeping of God's com∣mands,</HI>
there is an immediate <HI>great reward.</HI></P>
<P>But what it concerns us at present to
remark is, that some experience of this
<HI>joy of the Lord</HI> which I have described,
enters as an essential part into the character
of every good man. In proportion to the
<PB N="375" REF="386"/>
degree of his goodness, to his improvement
and progress in virtue, will be the degree
of his participation in the pleasure and joy
of religion. But wherever such pleasure
is entirely unknown; wherever there is no
satisfaction and delight in the discharge of
virtuous duties, there we are obliged to
conclude, that religion does not subsist in
its genuine state. It is either a sanctimo∣nious
show merely; a forced appearance
of piety and virtue, tinctured, perhaps,
with some deep shades of superstition; or,
at best, it is religion in its most weak and
imperfect state. It is de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icient in the re∣generation
of the heart. The man himself
is in a divided and hovering state, between
two opposite principles of action; partly
assecting to be obedient to God's com∣mands,
and partly a slave to the world.
The truth and importance of this observ∣ation
will more fully appear, when we pro∣ceed
to what was proposed for the</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Head of discourse,—to show in what
respects the joy of the Lord is justly said
to be <HI>the strength of the righte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI></P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="387"/>
IN the first place, it is the animating
principle of virtue; it supports its influence,
and assists it in becoming both persevering
and progressive. Experience may teach us
that few undertakings are lasting or suc∣cessful,
which are accompanied with no
pleasure. If a man's religion be considered
merely as a task prescribed to him, which
he feels burdensome and oppressive, it is
not likely that he will long constrain him∣self
to act against the bent of inclination.
It is not until he feels somewhat within
him which attracts him to his duty, that
he can be expected to be constant and
zealous in the performance of it. Was it
ever found that a person advanced far in
any art or study, whether of the liberal or
mechanical kind, in which he had no plea∣sure,
to which he had no heart, but which,
from motives merely of interest or fear,
he was compelled to undertake? Is it then to
be thought that religion will prove the only
exception to what holds so generally, and
will continue an actuating principle of con∣duct,
whether we love it for its own sake,
or not? It is true, that a sense of duty may
<PB N="377" REF="388"/>
sometimes exercise its authority, though
there be no sensations of pleasure to assist
it. Belief of those religious principles in
which we were educated, and dread of
future punishment, will, in cases where no
strong temptation assails us, restrain from
the commission of atrocious crimes, and
produce some decent regularity of external
conduct. But on occasions when incli∣nation
or interest prompt to some trans∣gression
of virtue, which safety or secrecy
encourages, and which the example of the
world seems to countenance; when the
present advantage or pleasure appears to be
all on one side, and no satisfaction arises
to counterbalance it on the other; is it to
be thought that conscience will then stand
its ground, with one who never was at∣tached
to virtue on its own account, and
never experienced any joy in following its
dictates?—But these are the occasions
when the <HI>joy of the Lord</HI> proves the <HI>strength
of the righteous man.</HI> Accustomed to take
pleasure in doing his duty; accustomed to
look up to God with delight and com∣placency,
<PB N="378" REF="389"/>
and to feel himself happy in all
the offices of kindness and humanity to men
around him; accustomed to rejoice in a
clear co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>science, in a pure heart, and the
hope of heavenly bliss; he cannot think of
parting with such satisfactions for the sake
of any worldly bribe. There is something
within his heart, that pleads for religion
and virtue. He has seen their beauty; he
has tasted their sweetness: and having such
pleasures within himself, to oppose to all the
pleasures of sin, he is enabled to maintain
his integrity inviolate; or if in any degree
he has deviated from it, speedy remorse is
awakened, and he cannot be satisfied with
himself till he returns back to the right
path. Thus, through <HI>the joy of the Lord,</HI>
religion becomes in him <HI>the spirit of love,
and power, and of a sound mind</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 7.</NOTE>. It is the
<HI>peace of God, which passeth understanding,
keeping his mind and heart</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Philipp. iv. 7.</NOTE>. It is the
<HI>path of the just, which is as the light, shining
more and more unto the perfect day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="390"/>
IN the next place, the joy of the Lord
is the <HI>strength of the righteous,</HI> as it is their
great support under the discouragements
and trials of life. In the days of their
ease and prosperity, it guards them, as has
been shown, against the temptations of
vice; and in the general tenor of con∣duct,
attaches them to the side of virtue:
and when the evil days come, wherein
they shall have no pleasure from the
world, it supplies them with pleasures of
another kind, to preserve them from im∣proper
despondency, or from entering into
evil courses for the sake of relief.—A
good man's friends may forsake him; or
may die, and leave him to mourn. His
fortune may fail, or his health decay. Ca∣lumny
and reproach may unjustly attack
his character. In circumstances of this
kind, where worldly men become peevish,
dispirited, and fretful, he who is acquainted
with the pleasures, of religion and virtue,
can possess himself calm and undisturbed.
He has resources within unknown to the
world, whence light <HI>arises to him in dark∣ness.</HI>
<PB N="380" REF="391"/>
From the gloom or turbulence of ex∣ternal
evils he can retreat to the enjoyment
of his own mind. In the exercises of
devotion, his heart is elevated, and the
cares of the world are forgotten. In his
regular discharge of all the social duties of
life, he finds cheerfulness and pleasure.
Hence his temper is not soured. He ac∣cuses
neither God nor man for the un∣avoidable
misfortunes of life. He submits
with patience to the common lot; looking
forward with good hope to better days;
retaining always honourable thoughts of
God's providence, and sentiments of can∣dour
towards men.—In this manner, his
experience of the joy of the Lord becomes
<HI>his strength;</HI> as in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>using into his mind a
principle of firmness and stability, and
enabling him, in every situation of fortune,
to continue the same.</P>
<P>FROM the view which we have now
taken of the subject, it must clearly appear,
that to every one who wishes to possess
the spirit, and to support the character of
<PB N="381" REF="392"/>
genuine goodness and virtue, it is an object
most desirable and important, to acquire a
prevailing relish for the pleasures of reli∣gion.
As this is a most important object,
so also it is an attainable one by every man
whose intentions are sincerely upright. For
let it be remembered, that the <HI>joy of the
Lord,</HI> which I have described as <HI>the strength
of the righteous,</HI> is not to be understood as
a privilege belonging only to saints of the
highest order, who can assuredly trust to
their being the chosen of God. It is not
to be understood of high raptures, and
transports of religious fervour. It is not
even confined to the sole pleasures of inter∣course
with God in devotion; though as∣suredly
these constitute one great part of
the <HI>joy of the Lord,</HI> and are auxiliary to
its exercise on every other occasion. The
<HI>joy of the Lord</HI> is to be understood of that
joy, which accompanies the whole of reli∣gious
and virtuous practice; that satisfac∣tion,
which a good man feels in the dis∣charge
of his duty, which accompanies the
performance of all the offices which be∣long
<PB N="382" REF="393"/>
to the station of life in which he is
placed; whether these be of a publick na∣ture
or private; social and domestick, or
relating particularly to the exercises of re∣ligious
worship and devotion.</P>
<P>To attain this spirit, of considering the
discharge of our duty as our pleasure and
happiness, is certainly not incompatible
with our present state of infirmity. It is
no more than what good men have often
attained and have testi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied of it; that <HI>their
delight was in the law of God;</HI> that his
<HI>statutes were sweet to their taste;</HI> that <HI>they
had taken them as an heritage for ever, for
they were the rejoicing of their heart. I
delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law is
within my heart</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ps. x<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 8. cxix. 111.</NOTE>.—According to the pro∣siciency
which men have made in virtue,
will be the degree of satisfaction which
they receive from the performance of it:
but where no pleasures or satisfactions of
this kind are known, men have much
ground to distrust their pretensions to god∣liness
or christianity.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="394"/>
It is therefore of high importance, that
all proper means be employed to form our
internal taste to a proper relish for this joy
of the Lord. For it is not to be dis∣sembled,
that much is against us in our
endeavours to have our disposition formed
for relishing virtuous pleasures. We breathe
in this world a sort of vitiated air, very
unfriendly to the health and foundness of
all our moral feelings. From our earliest
youth we are bred up in admiration of the
external advantages of fortune; and are
accuftomed to hear them extolled as the
only real and fubstantial goods. We must
therefore begin by studying to correct
these false ideas, and persuading ourselves
that there are other things besides riches,
honours, and sensual pleasures, that are
good for man; that there are joys of a
spiritual and intellectual nature, which di∣rectly
affect the mind and heart, and
which confer a satisfaction both more
refined and more lasting than any worldly
circumstances can confer. In order to have
a fair trial of the value and effect of those
<PB N="384" REF="395"/>
spiritual enjoyments, we must forbear pol∣luting
ourselves with gross and guilty plea∣sures;
we must even refrain from indulg∣ing
worldly pleasures that appear innocent,
in a profuse and intemperate degree, lest
they sensualize and debase our feelings.
By preserving a wise and manly temper∣ance
in lower pleasures and pursuits, we
will then allow those of a higher kind to
occupy their proper place; and shall be in
a situation fairly to compare the pure sen∣sations
of pleasure which arise from the
consciousness of discharging our duty, with
the transient and turbid gratifications of
sin and the world. To such endeavours
of our own, for rectifying and improving
our taste of pleasure, let us join frequent
and servent prayer to God, that he may
enlighten and reform our hearts; and by
his spirit communicate that joy to our
souls, which descends from him, and which
he has annexed to every part of religion
and virtue as the <HI>strength of the righteous.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Folly of the Wisdom of the World.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 CORINTH. iii. 19.</BIBL>
<Q>The wisdom of this world is foolishness with
God.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE judgment which we form of our∣selves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVII.</NOTE>
often differs widely from that
which is formed of us by God, whose
judgment alone is always conformable to
the truth. In our opinion of the abilities
which we imagine ourselves to possess,
there is always much self-flattery; and in
the happiness which we expect to enjoy in
this world, there is always much deceit.
As there is a worldly happiness, which God
<PB N="386" REF="397"/>
perceives to he no other than concealed
misery; as there is a worldly honour,
which in his estimation is reproach; so, as
the text informs us, there is a <HI>wisdom of
this world,</HI> which <HI>is foolishness with God.</HI>
Assuredly there is nothing in which it im∣ports
us more that our judgment should
agree with the truth, than in what relates
to wisdom. It is the qualification upon
which every man is inclined to value him∣self,
more than on any other. They who
can with patience suffer imputations on
other parts of their character, are ready to
lose their temper, and to feel sore and hurt
when they are attacked <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or deficiency in
prudence and judgment. Wisdom is justly
considered as the guide of conduct. If
any capital error shall take place respecting
it; if one shall mistake that for wisdom
which at bottom is mere folly, such a
mistake will pervert the first principles of
conduct, and be perpetually misleading a
man through the whole of life.—As the
text plainly intimates that this mistake does
often take place in the world, and as it
<PB N="387" REF="398"/>
materially concerns us all to be on our
guard against so great a danger, I shall
endeavour to show, first, what the nature
and spirit of that <HI>wisdom of the world</HI> is,
which is here condemned; and next, in
what sense and on what account it is styled
<HI>foolishness with God.</HI></P>
<P>I. LET us consider the nature of that
wisdom which is reprobated in the text as
foolishness with God. It is styled the
<HI>wisdom of this world;</HI> that is, the wisdom
which is most current, and most prized in
this world; the wisdom which particularly
distinguishes the character of those who
are commonly known by the name of <HI>men
of the world.</HI> Its first and most noted dis∣tinction
is, that its pursuits are confined
entirely to the temporal advantages of the
world. Spiritual blessings, or moral im∣provements,
the man of this spirit rejects as
a sort of airy unsubstantial enjoyments,
which he leaves to the speculative and the
simple; attaching himself wholly to what
he reckons the only solid goods, the pos∣session
<PB N="388" REF="399"/>
of riches and influence, of reputa∣tion
and power, together with all the con∣veniencies
and pleasures which opulent
rank or station can procure.</P>
<P>In pursuit of these favourite ends he is
not in the least scrupulous as to his choice
of means. If he prefer those which are
the fairest, it is not because they are fair,
but because they seem to him most likely
to prove successful. He is sensible that it
is for his interest to preserve decorums,
and to stand well in the publick opinion.
Hence he is seldom an openly profligate
man, or marked by any glaring enormities
of conduct. In this respect, his character
differs from that of those who are com∣monly
called <HI>men of pleasure.</HI> Them he
considers as a thoughtless giddy herd, who
are the victims of passion and momentary
impulse. The thorough-bred man of the
world is more steady and regular in his
pursuits. He is, for the most part, composed
in his manners, and decent in his vices.
He will often find it expedient to be es∣teemed
by the world as worthy and good.
<PB N="389" REF="400"/>
But to be thought good, answers his pur∣pose
much better than subjecting himself
to become really such; and what he can
conceal from the world, he conceives to be
the same as if it had never been.—Let
me here remark in passing, that the cha∣racter
which I am now describing, is one
less likely to be reclaimed and reformed, than
that of those whom I mentioned above as
the men of pleasure. With them, vice
breaks forth in occasional fits and starts;
with the other, it grows up into a hardened
and confirmed principle. In the midst of
the gross irregularities of pleasure, circum∣stances
often force remorse on the sinner's
mind. Moments of compunction arise,
which may be succeeded by conviction and
reformation. But the cool and temperate
plan of iniquity, on which the man of
worldly wisdom proceeds, allows the voice
of conscience to be longer silent. The
alarm which it gives, is not so loud and
violent as to awaken him at once from his
evil courses, and instantly to prepare him
for a better mind.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="401"/>
The man of the world is always a man
of selfish and contracted disposition. Friends,
country, duty, honour, all disappear from
his view, when his own interest is in ques∣tion.
He is of a hard heart; he chooses
indeed to be so, lest at any time the un∣guarded
effusions of kind affections should
carry him beyond the line of worldly wis∣dom.
The more thoroughly that the spirit
of the world has taken possession of him,
the circle of his affections becomes always
the narrower. His family will perhaps
find place, as connected with his own im∣portance,
and with his plans either of power
or wealth; but all beyond that circle are
excluded from any particular regard. It
is his great principle never to embark se∣riously
in any undertaking, from which
he foresees no benefit likely to redound to
himself. Publick spirit he considers either
as a mere chimera created by the simple,
or a pretence employed by the artful for
their own purpose. Judging of the rest
of the world by what he feels within him∣self,
he proceeds on the supposition that
<PB N="391" REF="402"/>
all men are carrying on interested designs
of their own, and of course is ever on his
guard against them. Hence, to the cor∣dialities
of friendship he is an entire
stranger; too much wrapt up in himself,
indeed, to be a friend to any one; and if
his prudence restrains him from being an
open and violent enemy, yet he is always
an unforgiving one.</P>
<P>Candour, openness, and simplicity of
manners, are ridiculed by the man of this
description, as implying mere ignorance of
the world. Art and address are the qua∣lities
on which he values himself. For
the most part, he would choose to supplant
a rival by intrigue, rather than to overcome
him by fair opposition. Indeed, what men
call policy and knowledge of the world, is
commonly no other thing than dissimulation
and insincerity. The world is a great school,
where deceit in all its forms is one of the
lessons that is first learned, and most eagerly
caught by such as aspire to be prosicients
in worldly wisdom. A man of the world,
in short, is one, who, upon any call of in∣terest,
<PB N="392" REF="403"/>
flatters and deceives you; who can
smile in your face, while he is contriving
plans for your ruin; who, upon no oc∣casion,
thinks of what is right, or fit, or
honourable; but only of what is expedient
and useful to himself.</P>
<P>I HAVE dwelt the more fully on the
delineation of this character, that each of
us might learn whether there be any fea∣ture
in it that applies to himself; as it is a
character too frequently met with in the
world, and not always so severely repro∣bated
as it ought to be. Let me now ask,
whether such a character as I have de∣scribed
be in any respect an amiable one?
Is the man of the world, polished, and
plausible, and courtly, as in his behaviour
he may be, one whom you would choose
for a companion and bosom-friend? Would
you wish him for a son, a brother, or a
husband? Would you reckon yourself safe
in considing your interests to him, or en∣trusting
him with your secrets? Nay, let
me ask, if he be one whom in your hearts
<PB N="393" REF="404"/>
you respect and honour? His shrewdness
and abilities you may perhaps admire;
stand in awe of him you may; and for
the sake of advantage, may wish him to be
on your side. But could you honour him
as a parent, or venerate him as a magis∣trate;
or would you wish to live under
him as a sovereign? Of what real value
then, let me ask, is that boasted wisdom of
the world, which can neither conciliate
love, nor produce trust, nor command in∣ward
respect?—At the same time, I
admit that the man of the world may be a
man of very considerable abilities. He
may display talents of many different sorts.
Besides art and sagacity, he may possess
genius and learning; he may be distin∣guished
for eloquence in supporting his
own cause; he may have valour and cou∣rage
to defend himself against his enemies.
—But observe, I entreat you, a conse∣quence
that follows. You see in this in∣stance,
that the most distinguished human
abilities, when they are separated from
virtue and moral worth, lose their chief
<PB N="394" REF="405"/>
eminence and lustre, and are deprived of
all valuable efficacy. They dwindle into
despicable talents, which have no power to
command the hearts, nor to ensure the re∣spect
and honour of mankind. Let it be
carefully observed, and always remembered,
that integrity, probity, and moral worth,
are essentially req<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>site to give the stamp
of real excellence to any powers or
abilities which the human mind can pos∣sess.—Having
now considered the nature
and effect of worldly wisdom with respect
to men, let us enquire,</P>
<P>II. How it stands with respect to God.
It is said in the text, to be <HI>foolishness with
God.</HI> It is so in three respects: It is con∣temptible
in God's sight; it is bassled in its
attempts by God; or, when its attempts
are successful, they are allowed to produce
nothing but disappointment and vanity.</P>
<P>FIRST, it is contemptible in God's sight.
Pleased and satissied as the wise man of
the world may be with himself, and ho∣noured
<PB N="395" REF="406"/>
as he may fancy himself to be by
the multitude, let him be mortisied with
reflecting that, in the eye of him who is the
Supreme Judge of all worth, his character
is mean and wretched. That which God
declares himself to love and honour, is
<HI>truth in the inward parts;</HI> the fair, sincere,
and candid mind. He who <HI>walketh up∣rightly
and worketh righteousn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss,</HI> is the per∣son
who shall <HI>abide in his tabernacle, and
dwell in his holy hill.</HI> When our blessed
Lord designed to mark one of his followers
with peculiar distinction and honour, he
said of him, <HI>Behold an Israelite indeed, in
whom there is no guile</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, i. 47.</NOTE>; a character so di∣rectly
the reverse of worldly wisdom, that
from this circumstance alone you may
judge in what rank that wisdom stood with
him.</P>
<P>But it is not only from the declarations
of the Scripture, but from the whole course
of Providence, that we learn the contempt
in which God holds the wisdom of the
<PB N="396" REF="407"/>
world. Who were they on whom he con∣ferred
the highest marks of distinction
which ever honoured mankind; whom he
singled out to be the companions of Christ,
the workers of miracles, the publishers of
everlasting happiness to mankind? Were
they the wise men of the world, the refined,
and the politi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, who were employed as
the instruments of God on this great oc∣casion?
No: he chose a few plain, simple,
undesigning men, in order to make foolish
the <HI>wisdom of the world,</HI> and by their means
to overthrow the establishments of the
artful, the learned, and the mighty.—
To this day, God in the course of his
Providence bestows those external advan∣tages
which the men of the world so ear∣nestly
pursue, with apparent disregard of
worldly wisdom. He allows no fixed nor
regular connexion to subsi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> between an
artful political conduct, and riches, repu∣tation,
or honours; he allows them not
this mark of value; he does not always
give the race to the swift, nor the battle
to the strong, nor riches to men of under∣standing;
<PB N="397" REF="408"/>
but, on the contrary, scatters the
advantages of fortune with a promiscuous
hand; and often allows them to be attained
by the vilest and lowest of men, who nei∣ther
by worldly wisdom, nor any other ta∣lent
whatever, had the smallest title to de∣serve
them.—Judge then, ye wise men of
this world, whether your characters and
pursuits be not most contemptible in God's
sight, when you behold those spiritual bless∣ings
which he esteems, withheld from you,
and bestowed only on the good and the
pious; and those worldly blessings which
you covet, when at any time they are al∣lowed
to you, yet allo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed only as a portion
in common to you with the refuse of man∣kind,
with many ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>racters so infamous
that you yourselves despise them?</P>
<P>IN the second place, the wisdom of the
world <HI>is foolishness with God,</HI> because it is
baffled by him. Some triumphs he has oc∣casionally
allowed it to gain, in order to carry
on some special purpose that his Providence
had in view. Hence a splendid conqueror,
<PB N="398" REF="409"/>
or a successful conspirator, dazzle at times
the publick eye, and attract imitators of
their characters and exploits. But, if you
extensively consult historical annals, and
much more, if you will attentively consider
what is known to happen in private life,
you will find the examples to be few and
rare, of wicked, unprincipled men attaining
fully the accomplishment of their crasty de∣signs.—It
is true, that the justice of Heaven
is not, in the present state, fully manifested,
by rendering to every man according to
his deeds. But I believe it will be found
by attentive observers, that there are two
cases in which, perhaps more than in any
other, the divine government has, through∣out
all ages, rendered itself apparent and
sensible to men. These are, humbling the
high imaginations of the proud, and taking
the wise in their own craftiness. By many
signal instances of the intervention of Pro∣vidence
in both these cases. God hath deep∣ly
marked the traces of an awful govern∣ment,
even in this introductory state; and
forced a reverence of his justice upon the
<PB N="399" REF="410"/>
minds of men. As he will not permit any
greatness to lift itself up against his power,
so neither will he permit any art to prevail
against his counsels. While the crafty pro∣ject
many a distant plan, and wind their
way most warily and cunningly, as they
think, to success; how often does the Al∣mighty,
by means of some slight and
seemingly contingent event, stop the wheel
at once from farther motion, and leave
them to the bitterness of humbling disap∣pointment?
<HI>He that sitteth in the heavens
shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in de∣rision.
Then,</HI> it is immediately added, <HI>shall
he speak to them in wrath, and vex them in
sore displeasure</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. ii. 4, 5.</NOTE>. The edifice of crooked
policy which they had erected against his
decree, was an edifice of dust: no sooner
does he blow upon it with the breath of
his mouth, than it falls to the ground. <HI>The
wicked are snared in their own devices.
They are caught in the pit which their hands
had digged. This is the purpose that is pur∣posed
<PB N="400" REF="411"/>
upon the whole earth; and this is the
hand that is stretched out upon all the nations</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah, xiv. 26.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>IN the third place, the wisdom of the
world is <HI>foolishness with God;</HI> because,
though it should be allowed by Providence
to run, without disturbance, its fullest ca∣reer,
and to compass successfully whatever
it had projected, yet it can produce nothing
in the issue, worthy of the pursuit of a truly
wise man. It is a wisdom which over∣reaches
and counteracts itself; and in∣stead
of expected happiness, ends in mi∣sery.
—If the existence of another world
be admitted, can he be accounted wise,
who frames his conduct solely with a view
to this world, and beyond it has nothing
to look for but punishment? Is he a wise
man, who exchanges that which is eternal,
for that which is temporary; and though
it were to gain the whole world, exposes
himself to lose his own soul?—But laying
another world out of the question, taking
things on the footing of this life only, still
<PB N="401" REF="412"/>
it can be clearly shown, that the crooked
wisdom of the world is no better than fool∣ishness.
For what is the amount of all that
this wise man hath gained, or can gain,
after all the toil he has undergone, and all
the sacrifices he has made, in order to at∣tain
success? He has supplanted a rival;
he has defeated an enemy; he has ob∣tained,
perhaps, a splendid establishment
for himself and his family. But how is
all this success enjoyed? with a mind often
ill at ease; with a character dubious at the
best, suspected by the world in general,
seen through by the judicious and discern∣ing.
For the man of the world <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>latters
himself in vain, if he imagines that by the
plausible appearances of his behaviour, he
can thoroughly conceal from the world
what he is, and keep them ignorant of the
hollow principles upon which he has acted.
For a short time the world may be deceiv∣ed;
but after a man has continued for a
while to act his part upon the publick
stage, and has been tried by the different
occurrences of life, his real character never
<PB N="402" REF="413"/>
sails to be discovered. The judgment of
the publick on the character of men, as to
their worth, probity, and honour, seldom
errs. In the mean time, the advantages of
fortune or station, which the man of the
world has gained, after having been en∣joyed
for a while, become insipid to him;
their first relish is gone, and he has little
more to expect. He finds himself em∣barrassed
with cares and fears. He is sen∣sible
that by many he is envied and hated;
and though surrounded by low flatterers,
is conscious that he is destitute of real
friends. As he advances in years, all the
enjoyments of his troubled prosperity are
diminished more and more, and with many
apprehensions he looks forward to the de∣cline
of life.</P>
<P>Compute now, O wise man, as thou
art! what thou hast acquired by all thy
selfish and intricate wisdom, by all thy re∣fined
and double conduct, thy dark and
designing policy? Canst thou say that thy
mind is satisfied with thy past tenour of
conduct? Has thy real happiness kept pace,
<PB N="403" REF="414"/>
in any degree, with the success of thy
worldly plans, or the advancement of thy
fortune? Are thy days more cheerful and
gay, or are thy nights more calm and free
of care, than those of the plain and upright
man, whom thou hast so often treated with
scorn? To thine own conscience I appeal,
whether thou darest say, that ought which
thou hast gained by the wisdom of the
world, be a sufficient compensation for in∣curring
the displeasure of thy Creator, for
forfeiting self-approbation within thy breast,
for losing the esteem of the wisest and
worthiest part of mankind around thee?—
<HI>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simpli∣city,
and the scorners delight in their scorn∣ing,
and fools hate knowledge? How long
will ye love vanity, and seek after lies?</HI></P>
<P>FROM what has been said of the nature
and the effects of worldly wisdom, you
will now judge how justly it is termed
<HI>foolishness with God,</HI> and how much it
merits the severe epithets which are given
it in Scripture, of <HI>earthly, sensual, and de∣vilish.</HI>
<PB N="404" REF="415"/>
Opposite to it stands the <HI>wisdom
that is from above,</HI> which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scribed by an
apostle, as <HI>pure, peaceable, gentle, and easy
to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits,
without partiality, and without bypocrisy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James, iii. 15. 17.</NOTE>.—This,
and this only, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wisdom,
which it is both our duty and our interest
to cultivate. It carries every character of
being far superior to the wisdom of the
world. It is masculine and generous; it
is magnanimous and brave; it is uniform
and consistent. The wise man of the
world is obliged to shape and form his
course according to the changing occur∣rences
of the world; he is unsteady and
perplexed; he trembles at every possible
consequence, and is ever looking to fu∣turity
with a troubled mind. But the wise
man in God's sight, moves in a higher
sphere. His integrity directs his course
without perplexity or trouble. He en∣quires
only what is right, becoming, and
honourable for him to do. Being satisfied
<PB N="405" REF="416"/>
as to this, he asks no farther questions.
The issue it is not in his power to direct;
but the part which is assigned to him,
he will act; secure, that come what will,
in life and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the Providence of that
God <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> serves, will effectually
guard all his great intere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts. At the same
time, the spirit of this wisdom is per∣fectly
consistent with proper foresight,
and vigilant attention. It is opposed to
art and cunning, not to prudence and
caution. It is the mark, not of a weak
and improvident, but of a great and noble
mind; which will in no event take re∣fuge
in falsehood and dissimulation; which
scorns deceit, because it holds it to be
mean and base; and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks no disguise,
because it needs none to hide it.—Such
a character is both amiable and vene∣rable.
While it ennobles the magistrate
and the judge, and adds honour and
dignity to the most exalted stations, it
commands respect in every rank of life.
When the memory of artful and crooked
<PB N="406" REF="417"/>
policy speedily sinks, and is extinguish∣ed,
this true wisdom shall long preserve
an honourable memorial among men,
and from God shall receive everlasting
glory.</P>

<P>MANY devices there are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVIII.</NOTE> and much

had beautified it with so much ornament,
and peopled it with such a multitude of ra∣tional
beings, he should then have thrown
it out from his care, as a despised, neglected
offspring, and allowed its affairs to float
about at random. There was indeed one set
of ancient philosophers who adopted this
absurd opinion; but though they nominally
allowed the existence of some beings whom
they called gods, yet as they ascribed to
them neither the creation nor the govern∣ment
of the world, they were held to be in
reality Atheists.</P>
<P>In what manner Providence interposes in
human affairs; by what means it influences
the thoughts and counsels of men, and,
<PB N="410" REF="421"/>
notwithstanding the influence it exerts,
leaves to them the freedom of will and
choice, are subjects of dark and myste∣rious
nature, and which have given occa∣sion
to many an intricate controversy. Let
us remember, that the manner in which
God influences the motion of all the hea∣venly
bodies, the nature of that secret
power by which he is ever directing the sun
and the moon, the planets, stars, and comets,
in their course through the heavens, while
they appear to move themselves in a free
course, are matters no less inexplicable to
us, than the manner in which he influences
the counsels of men. But though the
mode of divine operation remains un∣known,
the fact of an overruling influence
is equally certain in the moral, as it is in the
natural world. In cases where the fact is
clearly authenticated, we are not at liberty
to call its truth in question, merely because
we understand not the manner in which it
is brought about. Nothing can be more
clear from the testimony of Scripture, than
that God takes part in all that happens
<PB N="411" REF="422"/>
among mankind; directing and overruling
the whole course of events so as to make
every one of them answer the designs of
his wise and righteous government. This
is distinctly and explicitly asserted in the
text. Throughout all the sacred writings,
God is represented as on every occasion,
by various dispensations of his Providence,
rewarding the righteous, or chastening
them according as his wisdom requires,
and punishing the wicked. We cannot
indeed conceive God acting as the gover∣nor
of the world at all, unless his govern∣ment
were to extend to all the events that
happen. It is upon the supposition of a
particular Providence, that our worship
and prayers to him are founded. All his
perfections would be utterly insignificant to
us, if they were not exercised on every oc∣casion,
according as the circumstances of
his creatures required. The Almighty
would then be no more than an uncon∣cerned
spectator of the behaviour of his
subjects, regarding the obedient and the re∣bellious
with an equal eye.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="423"/>
It were needless to prosecute any farther
the argument in favour of a particular Provi∣dence.
The experience of every one must,
more or less, bear testimony to it. We
need not for this purpose have recourse to
those sudden and unexpected vicissitudes,
which have sometimes astonished whole na∣tions,
and drawn their attention to the con∣spicuous
hand of Heaven. We need not
appeal to the history of the statesman and
the warrior; of the ambitious and the en∣terprizing.
We confine our observation
to those whose lives have been most plain
and simple, and who had no desire to de∣part
from the ordinary train of conduct.—
In how many instances, my friends, have
you found, that you are held in subjection
to a higher Power, on whom depends the
accomplishment of your wishes and de∣signs?
Fondly you had projected some fa∣vourite
plan. You thought that you had
forecast, and provided for all that might
happen. You had taken your measures
with such vigilant prudence, that on every
side you seemed to yourself perfectly guarded
<PB N="413" REF="424"/>
and secure. But, lo! some little event
hath come about, unforeseen by you, and
in its consequences, at the first seemingly
inconsiderable, which yet hath turned the
whole course of things into a new direc∣tion,
and blasted all your hopes. At other
times, your counsels and plans have been
permitted to succeed. You then a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plauded
your own wisdom, and sat down to feast
on the happiness you had attained. To
your surprise you found, that happiness was
not there; and that God's decree had ap∣pointed
it to be only vanity. We labour
for prosperity, and obtain it not. Unex∣pected,
it i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sometimes made to drop upon
us, as of its own accord. The happiness
of man depends on secret springs, too nice
and delicate to be adjusted by human art.
It requires a favourable combination of
external circumstances with the state of his
own mind. To accomplish on every oc∣casion
such a combination, is far beyond
his power; but it is what God can at all
times effect; as the whole series of exter∣nal
causes are arranged according to his
<PB N="414" REF="425"/>
pleasure, and the hearts of all men are in
his hands, <HI>to turn them wheresoever be wills,
as rivers of water.</HI> From the imperfection,
of our knowledge to ascertain what is
good for us, and from the defect of our
power to bring about that good when,
known, arise all those disappointments
which continually testify, that the <HI>way of
man is not in himself;</HI> that he is not the
master of his own lot, that though he
may <HI>devise,</HI> it is God who <HI>directs;</HI> God,
who can make the smallest incident an ef∣fectual
instrumcnt of his Providence for
overturning the most laboured plans of
men.</P>
<P>Accident, and chance, and fortune, are
words which we often hear mentioned,
and much is ascribed to them in the life of
man. But they are words without mean∣ing;
or, is far as they have any signi∣fication,
they are no other than names for
the unknown operations of Providence.
For it is certain, that in God's universe
nothing comes to pass causelessly, or in
vain. Every event has its own determined
<PB N="415" REF="426"/>
direction. That chaos of human affairs
and intrigues, where we can see no light;
that mass of disorder and confusion which
they often present to our view, is all clear∣ness
and order in the sight of Him who is
governing and directing all, and bringing
forward every event in its due time and
place. <HI>The Lord sitteth on the flood. The
Lord maketh the wrath of man to praise
him,</HI> as he maketh the <HI>hail and the rain
obey his word. He hath prepared his throne
in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over
all. A mans heart deviseth his way, but the
Lord directeth his steps.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING illustrated the doctrine of the
text, I proceed to show how it is to be
improved by us. I must begin with warn∣ing
you, that the doctrine I have illus∣trated
has no tendency to supersede coun∣sel,
design, or a proper exertion of the
active powers of man. Because Providence
is superiour to us, it does not follow that
therefore man has no part to act; or be∣cause
our industry is sometimes disappoint∣ed,
<PB N="416" REF="427"/>
that therefore it is always vain. It is
by the use of ordinary means, that Provi∣dence,
for the most part, accomplishes its
designs, Man <HI>devising his own way,</HI> and
carrying on his own plans, has a place in
the order of means which Providence em∣ploys.
To exertions therefore of his own,
he is called by God. His Maker framed
him for action; and then only he is happy,
when in action he is properly employed.
To supine idleness, to a vain and presump∣tuous
trust in Providence, while we neglect
what is incumbent on us to perform, no
encouragement is given in Scripture; on
the contrary, threatenings are denounced
against it. But the doctrine of the text is to
be improved,</P>
<P>IN the first place, for correcting anxious
and immoderate care about the future
events of our life. This anxiety is the
source of much sin, and therefore is often
rebuked in Scripture, as alienating the mind
from God, and from the higher objects of
virtue and religion, and filling the heart
<PB N="417" REF="428"/>
with passions which both annoy and cor∣rupt
it. If it be the parent of much sin,
it is certainly also the offspring of great
folly. For in such a state as human life
has just now been represented to be, what
means this mighty bustle and stir, this rest∣less
perturbation of thought and care, as if
all the issues of futurity rested wholly on
our conduct?—Something depends upon
thyself; and there is reason, upon this ac∣count,
for acting thy part with prudence
and attention. But upon a hand unseen it
depends, either to overturn all thy projects,
or to crown them with success; and there∣fore,
when the issue is so uncertain, thine
attention should never run into immoderate
care. By disquieting thyself so much
about futurity, thou takest upon thy shoul∣ders
a lead which is net thine, and which
indeed thou art unable to bear.</P>
<P>The folly of such anxiety is aggravated
by this consideration, that ail events are
under a much better and wiser direction
than we could place them. Perhaps that
evil which we hare dreaded so much in
<PB N="418" REF="429"/>
prospect, may never be suffered to arrive.
Providence may either have turned into a
quite different course, that black cloud
which appeared to carry the storm; or be∣fore
the storm burst, our heads may be
laid so low as to be out of its reach. Per∣haps,
also, the storm may be permitted to
come upon us, and yet under its dark wings
may bring to us some secret and unexpected
good. <HI>Who knoweth what is good for man
all the days of his vain life, which he spend∣eth
as a shadow?</HI> Who knoweth this, my
brethren, except God? And who consult∣eth
it so effectually as He, who by his in∣finite
wisdom <HI>maketh all things work toge∣ther
for good to them who love him?</HI> Is it
not, then, our greatest happiness, that when
<HI>man deviseth, God directeth?</HI> Is it not far
ter for us than if the case were reversed;
if the all wise God were only ineffectually
to devise, and man, blind, and ignorant,
and rash as he is, were to have the full di∣rection
of his own steps?—Wherefore vex
not thyself in vain. To the unavoidable
evils of life, add not this evil of thine own
<PB N="419" REF="430"/>
procuring, a tormenting anxiety about the
success of thy designs. The great rule
both of religion and wisdom is, Do thy
duty, and leave the issue to Heaven.
<HI>Commit thy way unto the Lord.</HI> Act thy
part fairly, and as wisely as thou canst, for
thine apparent interest: and then, with a
steady and untroubled mind, wait for what
God shall see meet to appoint. This is
wisdom: all beyond this is vanity and folly.</P>
<P>IN the second place, the doctrine of the
text is calculated not only to repress anx∣iety,
but to enforce moderation of mind
in every state; it humbles the pride of
prosperity, and prevents that despair which
is incident to adversity.—The presumption
of prosperity is the source both of vices
and mischiefs innumerable. It renders
men forgetful of God and religion. It in∣toxicates
them with the love, and immerses
them in the indulgence of pleasure. It
hardens their hearts to the distresses of their
brethren. Now, consider, how little ground
the real situation of the most prosperous
<PB N="420" REF="431"/>
man affords for this vain elation of mind.
He is dependent every moment on the
pleasure of a superiour; and knows not, but
Providence may be just preparing for him
the most unforeseen reverses. Shall he <HI>boast
himself of to-morrow,</HI> who <HI>knoweth not
what a day may bring forth?</HI> He hath per∣haps
said in his heart, <HI>my mountain stands
strong;</HI> I shall never be moved. But God
needeth only to <HI>hide his face,</HI> and presently
<HI>be is troubled.</HI> That little eminence on
which be stood, and from which he sur∣veyed
with pride his fellow creatures below
him, was no more than an eminence of
dust. The Almighty blows upon it with
the breath of his mouth, and it is scattered.
Belongs it to him whose tenure of pros∣perity
is so insecure, to utter the voice of
contempt, or to lift the rod of oppression
over his fellows, when over his own head
is stretched that high arm of Heaven, which
levels, at one touch, the mighty with the
low?</P>
<P>The government of God is accompanied
with this signal advantage, that at once it
<PB N="421" REF="432"/>
humbles the proud, and revives the distress∣ed.
As long as we believe in one higher
than the highest, to whom all must look up,
the greatest man is taught to be modest,
and to feel his dependence; and the lowest
man has an object of continual resource
and hope. Injured by men, he can fly to
that righteous governour who rules the
earth, and, from his interposition, hope for
better days. Providence is the great sanc∣tuary
to the afflicted who maintain their
integrity. Consolation they always find in
the belief of it; and often there has issued
from this sanctuary the most seasonable re∣lief.
There issues from it, at all times, this
voice of comfort; <HI>Trust in the Lord and do
good; and so thou shalt dwell in the Land, and
verily thou shalt be fed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxxvii. 3.</NOTE>. Thine enemies
may conspire; <HI>the Heathen may rage, and the
people imagine a vain thing. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut he that
sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord
shall hold them in derision.</HI> For the Lord is
<HI>the keeper of Israel;</HI> he is the <HI>shield of the
<PB N="422" REF="433"/>
righteous. As the mountains are round about
Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his
people from henceforth and for ever</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm. cxxv. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the third place, the doctrine that has
been illustrated of the interposal of Provi∣dence
in all human affairs, places the vanity
and folly of all sinful plans in a very strong
light.—All sin, in every view of it, must
be attended with danger. He who em∣barks
in any unjust or criminal enterprize,
besides the manifest peril to his own soul,
incurs the risque of his character being dis∣covered,
and of meeting with hatred, con∣tempt,
and just resentment from the world.
One would think that when the conse∣quences
on one side are so dangerous, the
bribe on the other side must be very high,
and the prospect of success very fair and
promising. Now, consider how this mat∣ter
truly stands. The sinner hath against
him, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst, that general uncertainty which I
before shewed to take place in all the de∣signs
<PB N="423" REF="434"/>
and projects formed by men. Could
the most artful and best devised means al∣ways
ensure success to the end we sought to
obtain, some apology might then be made
for departing occasionally from the path of
rectitude. But it is far from being true,
that any such road to sure success can, on
any occasion, be found. On the contrary,
we every day see the most plausible and
best concerted plans baffled and thrown to
the ground; and there is nothing which
on many occasions has been more remarked,
than Providence seeming to make sport of
the wisdom of man.</P>
<P>This view of things alone were sufficient
to show to the sinner the insecurity and
danger of the system on which he acts.
But there is much more against him than
this. For he, by his guilty plans, hath en∣gaged
against himself one certain and most
formidable enemy, to whom he hath great
reason to look up with terror. He cannot
possibly believe that the righteous Gover∣nour
of the universe, beholds with an equal
eye the designs of the virtuous who honour
<PB N="424" REF="435"/>
him, and the designs of the guilty who de∣spise
his laws, and do injustice to his ser∣vants.
No; against these latter, Providence
hath pointed its darts, hath bent its bow
in the heavens; <HI>the face of the Lord is
against them that do evil</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm. xxxiv. 16.</NOTE>. Other designs
may fail; but those of the wicked, God is
concerned in overthrowing. It is true, that
this life is not the season of rendering to
every man according to his works. But
though retribution does not on every occa∣sion
take place at present, yet neither is the
exercise of divine justice always delayed.
The history of the world is continually fur∣nishing
us with examples of the wicked
<HI>taken in their own devices;</HI> of the crafty
<HI>snared in the works of their own hands;</HI> of
sinners <HI>falling into the pit which themselves
bad digged.</HI> How often when signal crimes
were ready to be perpetrated, hath God re∣markably
interposed; hath spread his shield
before the just, unnerved the arm of the
assassin, or struck a sudden damp into his
<PB N="425" REF="436"/>
mind at the critical moment?—Obnoxious
then as the sinner is to so many dangers;
exposed perpetually to the disappointment
of his designs by the uncertainty of human
events; exposed, over and above, to the
avenging interposition of Heaven; what
strange insatuation has tempted him to de∣part
from the plain and safe path of inte∣grity?</P>
<P>IN the last place, from all that has been
said on this subject, we clearly see how
much it concerns us to perform those duties
which a proper regard to Providence re∣quires,
and to obtain protection from that
power which directeth and disposeth all.
A more incontrovertible axiom there can∣not
be than this, that if man only deviseth
his way, while God overrules his devices
and directs his steps, an interest in God's
favour is far more important than all the
wisdom and ability of man. Without his
favour, the wisest will be disappointed and
baffled; under his protection and guid∣ance,
the simple are led in a plain and sure
<PB N="426" REF="437"/>
path.—In vain would the giddy and pro∣fane,
throw Providence out of their
thoughts, and affect to think and act, as
if all depended on themselves. This bold∣ness
of self-sufficiency is affectation, and
no more. For, moments there are, when
the man of stoutest heart feels the strong
subjection under which he is held, and
would gladly grasp at the aid of Heaven.
As long as human affairs proceed in a
smooth train, without any alarming pre∣sages
of change or danger, the man of the
world may remain pleased with himself,
and be fully confident in his own powers.
But whose life continues long so undis∣turbed?
Let any uncommon violence shake
the elements around him, and threaten him
with destruction; let the aspect of publick
affairs be so lowering as to forebode some
great calamity; or in his private concerns,
let some sudden change arrive to shatter his
fortune, or let sickness, and the harbingers
of approaching death, show him his frailty;
and how ready will he then be to send up
prayers from the heart, that Providence
<PB N="427" REF="438"/>
would befriend and relieve him? Religion,
my friends, is not a matter of theory and
doubt. Its foundations are laid deep in the
nature and condition of man. It lays hold
of every man's feelings. In every man's
heart and conscience it has many witnesses
to its importance and reality.</P>
<P>Let us then neglect no means which may
be of avail for procuring the grace and fa∣vour
of that divine Providence on which
so much depends. Let no duties be over∣looked
which belong to us as subjects of
God; devout worship, and grateful praises
for all his blessings; humble trust in his
goodness, and implicit submission to his
will; and constant and cheerful obedience
to his laws. Let us be thankful that God
hath clearly made known all that he requires
of us in order to be accepted in his sight;
and that not only he has revealed the rule
of duty, but also hath pointed out to us in
the gospel, the direct method of reconci∣liation
with him, through faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ. Providence hath condescend∣ed
to become our instructor in this great
<PB N="428" REF="439"/>
article; hath taught us in what way our
sins may be forgiven, our imperfect services
be accepted, and an interest in the divine
grace be attained by means of our Re∣deemer.
Inexcusable we must be, if all this
offered grace we shall wantonly throw at our
feet. In a world so full of vicissitudes and
uncertainty, let us take pains to secure to our∣selves
one resting place; one habitation that
cannot be moved. By piety and prayer, by
faith, repentance, and a good life, let us seek
the friendship of the Most High; so shall he
who <HI>directeth the steps of man</HI> now, conduct
our path in such a course as shall bring us
in the end to himself.</P>

<P>THE Supreme Being is represented under
many amiable characters in the sacred
writings; as the <HI>Father of Mercies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIX.</NOTE> the
<HI>God of Love,</HI> the <HI>Author of every good and
perfect gift.</HI> But there is no character
which carries more comfort, or which ren∣ders
God so properly the object of con∣fidence
and trust, as this, of his being the
<HI>Hearer of Prayer.</HI> This view of the Al∣mighty
accommodates his perfections to
<PB N="430" REF="441"/>
our necessities and wants, and in our pre∣sent
frail and distressed state affords a con∣stant
refuge to which we can fly. <HI>Unto
Thee shall all flesh come.</HI> To Thee, shall an
indigent world look up for the supply of
their wants; to Thee, shall the proudest
sinner, at some time or other, be compelled

afflicted have recourse, as to their last
relief and hope.</P>
<P>Prayer is a duty essential to natural re∣ligion.
Wherever the light of nature taught
men to acknowledge the being of a God,
to that God also it directed them to pray.
In the Christian revelation great stress is
laid upon this duty, and great encourage∣ment
given to it. Our blessed Saviour not
only set the example himself, and enjoined
the practice to his followers, but thought it
worthy his express instruction to teach them
in what manner to pray, and even to put
words in their mouth. We are assured
that prayers are not in vain; but that as
<HI>the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,
so his ears are open to their cry;</HI> that if we
<PB N="431" REF="442"/>
ask aright, <HI>we shall receive; if we seek, we
shall find; if we knock, it shall be opened to
us.</HI> It is, indeed, hard to say, whether
prayer is to be most properly considered
as a duty incumbent on all, or as a privilege
allowed to them. But a blessed circum∣stance
it is, that our duty and our privilege
thus concur in one; that we are com∣manded
to do what our wants naturally
dictate to be done; even to ask what is
good from God, who <HI>giveth to all men li∣berally,
and upbraideth not.</HI>—In treating of
this subject, it will be proper to consider
first, the nature and the subjects of prayer;
next, its proper qualifications; and lastly,
the advantages and blessings which at∣tend
it.</P>
<P>I. THE Nature of Prayer supposes, in
the first place, that we have a just sense
of our own wants and miseries, and of
our dependence on God for relief. To
be suitably impressed with this sense, we
need only think what our present situation
is. We live in a world where every
<PB N="432" REF="443"/>
thing around us is dark and uncertain.
When we look back on the past, we
must remember that there we have met
with much disappointment and vanity.
When we look forward to the future, all
is unknown. We are liable there to many
dangers which we cannot foresee; and to
many which we foresee approaching, yet
know not how to defend ourselves against
them. We are often ignorant what course
we can steer with safety; nay, so imperfect
is our own wisdom, and so great the dark∣ness
which covers futurity, that while we
imagine that we are in the road to pro∣sperity,
we are often rushing blindly into
the most fatal evils.—Besides these con∣tingencies
of life, which make us feel so
deeply the necessity of looking up to some
more powerful Guide and Protector, there
are other circumstances in our state which
lead to reflections still more alarming.
We know that we are the subjects of a
supreme righteous Governour, to whom
we are accountable for our conduct. We
were sent into this world by his appoint∣ment,
<PB N="433" REF="444"/>
and we are removed from it at his
decree. How soon the call for our removal
may be given, none of us know; but this
we profess to believe, that upon our going
hence we are to be brought into new and
unknown habitations, suitable to our beha∣viour
here. Who amongst us can say that
he is perfectly ready to appear before his
Creator and Judge, and to give an account
to him for all the actions of his life? How
much do the best of us stand in need of
mercy and forgiveness for our offences past,
and of direction and assistance from Heaven
to guide us in our future way? What
reason to dread that if we be left entirely
to ourselves, we will be in the utmost dan∣ger
of departing from virtue and from hap∣piness,
and of leaving life under the dis∣pleasure
of Him who is to judge us?—
While with this sense of our imperfections,
our dangers, and our guilt, we come to the
Hearer of prayer, we must, in the next
place.</P>
<P>Pray to God, in the belief that with
him there is power which can give us relief,
<PB N="434" REF="445"/>
and goodness which will incline him to
give it. Prayer supposes a full persuasion
that his Providence rules and governs all;
that through all futurity his eye penetrates;
that there are no events of our life in which
he interposes not; that he knows the most
secret motions of our hearts; and that to the
hearts of all men he has access, by avenues
unknown to us, and can turn them accord∣ing
to his pleasure. It supposes, at the same
time, a firm confidence in the declarations
he has made in his word, that a plan is
established for dispensing grace to fallen
and guilty mankind, through a great Re∣deemer.
It supposes a humble hope that,
as he <HI>knows our frame and remembers we
are dust,</HI> he will not reject the supplications
of the penitent returning sinner; that he
is one who hath no pleasure in our sor∣rows
and distress, but desires the happiness
of his creatures, and beholds with compla∣cency
the humble and sincere worshipper.</P>
<P>Now these things being supposed, this
just sense of our own imperfections and
guilt, and this proper impression of the
<PB N="435" REF="446"/>
divine nature, when the soul is in this pos∣ture
of devotion, breathing forth its sor∣rows
and its wants before its Creator, and
imploring from him protection and aid,
it cannot but give vent to the high con∣ceptions
with which it will then be affected,
of God's supreme perfection. This of
course becomes the foundation of that part
of devotion which is styled adoration or
praise.—As it is the experience of past
goodness which warms the heart of the
worshipper, and encourages his present
supplication, he will naturally be led to
a grateful celebration of the mercies of
Heaven; whence thanksgiving becomes an
essential part of his devotion.—As he cannot
put up petitions without acknowledging
his wants, and as his wants are closely con∣nected
with his frailty and ill-deserving,
hence the most humble confession of guilt
must necessarily enter into prayer.—If
there be any terms on which we may ex∣pect
the Deity to be most propitious; if
there be any meritorious Intercessor through
whom we may prefer our request to him,
<PB N="436" REF="447"/>
this assuredly will be the method which the
pious worshipper will choose for addressing
the Almighty; and this will be the ground
of his praying in the name of Christ, send∣ing
up his petitions to God through his be∣loved
Son, whom he heareth always.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that there is a just found∣ation
for prayer in all its parts, naturally
laid in the present circumstances of man,
and in the relation in which he stands to
God. But as petition is the chief and
most distinguishing part of prayer, it will
be requisite that we consider particularly
what those requests are, which are proper
to be offered up to God. These way all
be classed under three heads: first, requests
for temporal blessings; next, for spiritual
mercies; and lastly, intercessions for the
welfare of others.</P>
<P>WITH regard to temporal blessings,
though men may lay a restraint upon them∣selves
in the expressions which they utter in
prayer, yet it is much to be suspected, that
the inward wishes of their hearts for such
<PB N="437" REF="448"/>
blessings are often the most fervent of any.
To wish and pray for the advantages of
life, is not forbidden. Our Saviour hath
so far countenanced it, as to command
us to pray that God would <HI>give us our
daily bread;</HI> that is, as his words have
been always understood, that he would
bestow what is necessary for the sustenance
and comfort of life. Yet the very sound
of the words retrenches every superfluous
and extravagant wish. Not for riches and
honours, for great advancement or long
life, or for numerous and flourishing fa∣milies,
has he given us any encourage∣ment
to pray. Foreign are such things to
the real improvement, foreign very often
to the true happiness of man. Foolishly
they may be wished for, when the wish
accomplished would prove our ruin. Let
health and peace, contentment and tran∣quillity.
bound the humble prayer which
we send up to Heaven; that God may <HI>feed
us with food convenient for us;</HI> that what∣ever
our outward circumstances are, they
may be blessed to us by him, and accom∣panied
<PB N="438" REF="449"/>
with a quiet mind. Even health
and peace themselves may not always prove
blessings. Sweet and desirable as they
seem, God may, at certain times, foresee
their tendency to corrupt our hearts, and
may, in mercy, reject a prayer for them,
which, on our part, may be allowably put
up. For the nature of all temporal things
is such, that they have not one fixed and
stable character, but may be convertible on
different occasions either into good or ill;
and therefore, some reserve in our wish
must always be maintained; and to the
wiser judgment of God, it must be left to
determine what is fit to be bestowed, and
what to be withheld.—But this we may
lawfully pray, that, as far as to God seems
meet, he would make our state comfortable,
and our days easy and tranquil; that he
would save us from falling into any severe
and extreme distress; that he would pre∣serve
to us the enjoyment of those friends
and comforts that we most love; or if he
bereave us of any of them, that he would
in mercy assist and support us under the
<PB N="439" REF="450"/>
loss; in fine, that he would so order our
lot, that we may be kept as free from pain,
trouble, and anguish, as shall be consistent
with the higher improvements of our souls,
in piety, virtue, and wisdom.</P>
<P>IN the next place, with regard to spi∣ritual
mercies, we are unquestionably al∣lowed
to be more servent and explicit in
our requests at the throne of grace. God
can never be displeased in hearing us im∣plore
from him those graces and endow∣ments
of the soul, that beautify us in his
sight, that are good for all men, good at
all times, indeed the only certain and im∣mutable
goods; and therefore to these only
pertains that earnestness, that urgency of
prayer, which is represented as acceptable
to the Almighty—Our petitions of this
nature, our Saviour has ranked under the
two great heads, of forgiveness for past
offences, and deliverance from future tempt∣ations.
It is chiefly for these important
blessings, that we are to prostrate ourselves
before our Father in Heaven; begging of
<PB N="440" REF="451"/>
him, who knows our heart with all its
frailties, that he would accept our sincere
repentance, and pardon our errors for the
sake of Jesus Christ. We must earnestly
pray, that he would strengthen us by his
grace to resist the temptations that here∣after
may assault us; and whatever he
appoint to befal us without, may enable
us to preserve a good conscience within;
that he may teach us to know ourselves,
and assist us to control and govern our
passions; that he may endow us with
temperance in prosperity, and resignation
under adversity; that in no situation of life
we may be allowed to forget what we owe
to our Maker and Redeemer; and that
after having discharged the duties of life,
through the assistance of Divine grace,
with some measure of integrity and ho∣nour,
we may be prepared for going
through the last scene of life without dis∣may;
and when we have made a decent
and peaceful retreat from this world, we
may then find ourselves in some better and
happier state.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="452"/>
IN the last place, it is to be remembered
that interce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions for the welfare of others
form a material part of prayer. The
sincere worshipper is not to consider him∣self
as a single and separate being, con∣fining
his concern wholly to himself. Our
Saviour has initiated us into a more noble
and enlarged spirit of devotion, when he
taught us to begin with praying that the
kingdom of God may be advanced over
all, and that mankind may be rendered as
happy by doing his will, as the angels are
in Heaven. When we bow our knee to
the common Father, let it be like affec∣tionate
members of his family, desiring the
prosperity of all our brethren. In parti∣cular,
the happiness of our friends and re∣lations,
of those whom we love, and by
whom we are loved, ought then to be near
our heart; praying that the Almighty may
be our God, and the God of our friends
and family, for ever; that he may watch
over them, and bless them; and may make
us long happy in mutual comfort and
affection. We ought to remember our
<PB N="442" REF="453"/>
benefactors before God, and pray for a
return of divine blessings on their head.
The distressed and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>licted ought to share
our sympathy; remembering them <HI>who
suffer adversity, as being ourselves in the
body;</HI> and shedding the friendly tear at the
thought of human woe. Our enemies
themselves ought not to be forgotten in
our prayers: in fine, our prayers ought to
be an exercise of extensive benevolence of
heart; a solemn testimony offered up to
the God of Love, of our kind and charit∣able
affection to all men.</P>
<P>BUT now, after what has been suggested
concerning the proper subjects of prayer,
I am aware that it may be said by some,
To what purpose is all this detail?—Do
we propose, by our prayers, to give to the
Supreme Being any new information, re∣garding
our situation, of which be is not
possessed? Does He not already know all
our wants and distresses; and will He not
be prompted by his goodness and wisdom to
do for us in such circumstances, whatever
<PB N="443" REF="454"/>
is fit and proper to be done? Do we
imagine that, by the importunity of our
folicitations and requests, He can be pre∣vailed
upon to alter his purpose, or depart
from his system in the government of the
world, in order to gratify our desires?—
Such objections against the reasonableness
of prayer, have been often urged with all
the parade of scepticism. Though, on the
first view, they may carry some appearance
of speciousness, yet on a slight discussion
they fall to the ground; for they all rest
on a mistaken idea of the nature and
design of prayer. No man in his sober
senses could ever believe that, by lifting his
feeble voice to Heaven, he could convey to
the ear of the Almighty any new know∣ledge
or information. None but the most
ignorant could imagine, that, by his prayers
he could raise any new emotions in the
unchangeable Sovereign of the universe,
and prevail upon him to alter his decrees
in consequence of his requests.—The
efficacy of prayer lies, not in working a
change upon God, but in working a
<PB N="444" REF="455"/>
change upon ourselves; in begetting or
improving right dispositions of heart, and
thereby making us fit subjects of the Di∣vine
mercy. It is not for the sake of our
asking, that God grants the requests we
prefer in prayer; but as our asking, with
proper dispositions, produces that frame of
mind which qualifies us to receive.—He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce
prayer has been appointed by God
as an instrument for improving our nature,
and is required on our part as a condition
of receiving his favours. Thus, when
upon a certain occasion he had by his
Prophet predicted and promised circum∣stances
of prosperity to the Jewish nation,
the Prophet was directed to add, <HI>Thus saith
the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired
of by the house of Israel to do it for them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezekil, xxxvi. 37.</NOTE>.
—Is there any one who will say, that it
is not incumbent on all rational creatures
to feel their dependence on the God who
has formed them, and to refer to him all
the bleffings which they either enjoy or
<PB N="445" REF="456"/>
hope to receive? Would not the want of
such becoming sentiments be altogether
unworthy and sinful? And if they are
such sentiments as ought to be entertained,
must it not be proper to express them by
words in prayer, and thereby to strengthen
the impression of them on our minds?</P>
<P>But in truth there is no occasion for
entering into any long discussion of argu∣ment
in order to evince the reasonableness
of prayer. It is the natural dictate of the
human heart. Though in the days of
prosperity and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase it may, like other du∣ties,
have been neglected and forgotten,
yet on all great and trying occasions, men
are prompted by an irre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istible impulse to
lift their eyes, and address their voice to
Heaven. Who is there, for instance, that
feeling himself cruelly oppressed by injus∣tice
and violence, without any prospect of
procuring redres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, can forbear appealing to
a Power that rules above, and invoking
Divine interposition to vindicate his in∣nocence,
and avenge his wrongs? Who
that is standing by the death-bed of a be∣loved
<PB N="446" REF="457"/>
friend, of a spouse, a brother, or a
son, and sees them struggling with the last
agonies, but finds himself impelled to look
up to Heaven, and to pray from the heart,
that where men can give no aid, God
would in his mercy support the dying
man? Was there ever a sinner so hardened,
that when he finds himself leaving the
world, and standing on the brink of an
unknown eternity, is not disposed with
earnest and trembling voice to pray that
God would forgive his errors, and receive
in peace his departing spirit? In such situa∣tions
as these, man feels what he truly is,
and speaks the native unadulterated lan∣guage
of the heart.—Accordingly,
throughout all ages and nations, the ob∣ligation
to prayer as a duty has been re∣cognised,
and its propriety has been felt.
Over all the world, even among the most
savage tribes, temples have been built,
worshippers have assembled in crowds;
and the wildest superstition has, by the
various forms of homage which it adopted,
borne testimony to this truth, that there is
<PB N="447" REF="458"/>
some God, to whom, as <HI>the hearer of prayer,
all flesh should come.</HI></P>
<P>IN order that prayer may produce its
proper effect, there are certain qualifications
necessarily belonging to it, which come next
to be considered.</P>
<P>One of the first and chief of these is se∣riousness,
or an attentive and solemn frame
of mind, in opposition to thoughts that
wander, and to words that drop forth un∣meaning
from the lips. One would think
it unnecessary to mention such a qualifica∣tion
to be requisite, when we are to be em∣ployed
in so solemn an act as an immediate
address to our Maker. Yet there is ground
to apprehend, that an admonition of this
nature is necessary to be given to many
professed Christians. Men from their child∣hood
have been so oft accustomed to repeat
certain expressions, which they call, saying
prayers, with little understanding, and less
attention to what they say, that the habit
of it is apt to be continued throughout life;
as if the mere uttering of words, or pre∣senting
<PB N="448" REF="459"/>
themselves, at set times, in a certain
posture before God, had some charm in it
to attract the blessings of Heaven.—My
brethren, this is tri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling with one of the
most important exercises in which the
human mind can be employed; it is turn∣ing
devotion into childish folly. Let us
never forget that it is the heart which must
pray. The heart may pray, when no words
are uttered. But if the heart be not en∣gaged
in prayer, all the words we can utter
are no better than rude offensive sounds in
the ear of the Almighty.—Collect then thy
mind within itself, before thou preferrest a
single petition; nay, before thou pro∣nouncest
the name of God in prayer. Be
alone with him, and thine own soul; under
the same impression as if thou wert just
about to appear before the judgment-seat
of that God, to whom thou prayest.</P>
<P>To seriousness, we must join affection
in prayer; I mean that devotion of the heart
which is inspired by gratitude and love, in
distinction from forced prayer; or what is
unwillingly preferred from servile fear, or
<PB N="449" REF="460"/>
mere regard to decency. We must come
into the presence of God, as to a Father in
heaven; not to a hard and oppressive
master, to whom we are obliged to pay
obeisance to prevent him from destroying
us.—Profound humility is perfectly con∣sistent
with this affectionate spirit in prayer.
No presumptuous familiarity must enter into
our addresses to God. We are enjoined to
serve him <HI>with reverence and godly fear.</HI>
Our devotion will be moft servent and
affectionate, when we entertain the humblest
thoughts of ourselves, joined with the most
exalted conceptions of that God to whom
we pray. <HI>Remember that God is in heaven,
and thou art on earth; therefore let thy
words be few</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. v. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Faith is a qualification of prayer ex∣pressly
required in Scripture. He that
prayeth, says the Apostle James, <HI>let him
ask in faith, nothing wavering</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jame<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, i. 6.</NOTE>.—By faith
in prayer, two things are meant; first, a
general persuasion that God is a Being of
<PB N="450" REF="461"/>
infinite goodness and mercy; to whom,
therefore, the prayers of his creatures are
not put up in vain. <HI>He that cometh unto
God must believe,</HI> not only that he is, but
that he <HI>is a rewarder of them that diligently
seek him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 6.</NOTE>: without some belief of this kind,
prayers were altogether superfluous. For
who would send up supplications to a God
who was believed to be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inaccessible to his
creatures, and to have no regard to their
circumstances and wants?—At the same
time, much ground we have to be conscious
of our own unworthiness, and to tremble
at the remembrance of it, when we address
ourselves to Heaven; and therefore, secondly,
to pray in faith is, in the scripture sense of
it, to pray in the name of Christ; that is,
in the faith that it is through his merits and
mediation only we can find acceptance
with God. We acknowledge our guilt;
we disclaim all trust in our own righteous∣ness;
and implore grace from God on ac∣count
of what his Son has done and suffered
<PB N="451" REF="462"/>
for us. This is the clear and express doc∣trine
of the New Testament. <HI>We have
boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood
of Jesus. We have this new and living
way which he hath consecrated for us within
the veil. Having this High Priest over the
house of God, let us draw near with a true
heart in full assurance of Faith</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 19–22.</NOTE></P>
<P>HAVING thus pointed out the chief and
most essential qualifications of prayer, it
remains that I lay some considerations be∣fore
you, to show the importance and ad∣vantages
of it.</P>
<P>IN the first place, prayer is one of the most
powerful means of recalling our minds
from the vanities of life to serious thoughts;
to a proper sense of God, and our duty;
and to all the high objects with which we
are intimately connected as rational and
immortal beings. Surrounded, as we are,
with the objects and pleasures of the world;
busied with its avocations, and continually
<PB N="452" REF="463"/>
immersed in its pursuits, man would be∣come
altogether the victim of sense, and a
prey to its temptations; if there were not
some stated occasions which brought him
home to himself, and to the thoughts of
another world. Prayer has a much more
impressive effect for this purpose, than can
be expected from simple meditation. An
immediate and solemn address to an omni∣scient
Being, in whose presence we consider
ourselves as then particularly sisted, tends
to produce a higher degree of serious and
awful recollection, than would ari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e from
a mere soliloquy of the mind with itself.
In prayer, the soul approaches to the bor∣ders
of an invisible world, and acts as a
spirit holding intercourse with the Father
of Spirits. It drops for a time the remem∣brance
of its earthly connections, to dwell
among everlasting objects. Prayer, by this
means, both composes and purifies the
heart; it gives the soul its proper elevation
towards God, and has a happy effect to
counterwork the dangerous impressions
made by the corruptions of the world
around us.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="464"/>
IN the next place, Prayer is useful, not
only as a corrective of our natural levity
and forgetfulness of God, but as an actual
exercise of the best affections of our na∣ture,
which are thereby confirmed and
strengthened. As far as prayer is not a
mere emission of empty words, but speaks,
as it ought to do, the language of the heart,
it is an assemblage of all the affections
which constitute piety. It implies the
highest sentiments of reverence and ado∣ration,
of love and gratitude to God, of
trust in his mercy, and of faith in our blessed
Redeemer, all animating the heart. What∣ever
nourishes such affections as these in
the soul, gives strength and support at the
same time to active virtue; and thereby
prepares and assists us for every duty of
life.—With respect to ourselves, the view
which prayer gives, of our necessities and
wants, of our sins and offences against God,
and of the dangers which we have thereby
incurred, produces becoming humility of
mind. Prostrate before that Great Being
whom we have so much offended, all the
<PB N="454" REF="465"/>
pride of man is laid in the dust. He is
impressed with a sense of what he truly is,
and taught how far removed from what he
ought to be. By the prayers he puts up
for being assisted to repent of past follies,
and to make improvements for the future
in virtue, the desire of virtue is cherished,
and the pursuit of it excited; and if this
desire after virtue which is expressed in
prayer he genuine, it is a degree of good∣ness
already in some measure begun within
the heart.—Prayer is, at the same time,
an exercise of benevolence towards men,
as well as of piety towards God; when,
as was before observed, not merely as indi∣viduals,
but as members of the great family
of God, we come before our heavenly
Father, and express our affectionate wishes
for all our brethren.—While prayer in this
manner gives exertion to many of the
highest parts of goodness, it is attended
moreover with this great advantage, that it
tends to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortify the worshipper in the prac∣tice
of all his duties. For it impresses him
with a sense of God as the great friend and
<PB N="455" REF="466"/>
protector of righteousness in the world; to
whom, therefore, all righteous men may
look up with confidence and hope; whose
strength is more than sufficient for their
weakness; whose gracious aid none that
served him ever implored in vain.</P>
<P>IN the last place, Prayer is important,
not only as a means of high improvement
in religion, but as an instrument of conso∣lation
and relief under the distresses of life.
How many situations are found in the
world, where men have no resource left to
them but prayer to God? How forlorn
would the persecuted and afflicted, the sad
and the sorrowful be, if even this last sanc∣tuary
were shut against them; if they had
no Protector in heaven to whom they could
look up in the hours of anguish?—We all
know what a relief it is to be able to un∣bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om
our griefs to some friend whom we
believe compassionate and kind, even though
it be not in his power to give us any ef∣fectual
aid. In our Heavenly Father we
can look up not only to One in whom <HI>com∣passions
<PB N="456" REF="467"/>
flow,</HI> who <HI>knows our frame, remem∣bers
we are dust, and pities us as a father
pitieth his children;</HI> but to One whose arm
is all-powerful, either to support us under
our distress, or, if to his wisdom it seem
meet, to relieve us altogether from it.—
Hence, Prayer is so often the last retreat
of the miserable. Where men can give them
no aid, <HI>God is their present help.</HI> To him
they can pour forth those secret griefs, which
to men they sometimes cannot disclose. He
hears those groans of the labouring heart,
which no words can utter; and circum∣stances
which would expose our requests to
be despised by the world, prevent not our
prayers from finding acceptance with God.
It is his character to <HI>hear the cry of the
poor, and to regard the prayer of the desti∣tute:</HI>
He is the <HI>helper of them who have no
help of man.</HI>—Hence, prayer may be
termed the Temple of Tranquillity to the
unhappy; where their minds are soothed,
and their cares and sorrows are, for a time,
hushed and forgotten. It may justly be
said, that there only, on this side of the
<PB N="457" REF="468"/>
grave, <HI>the wicked cease from troubling, and
the weary are at rest. There, the prisoners
rest together; they hear no more the voice of
the oppressor. The small and the great are
there; and the servant it free from his
master</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job, iii. 17–19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE reasonableness of prayer as a duty,
and the advantages attending it, being such
as I have now endeavoured briefly to set
forth, there is no wonder that so many re∣peated
recommendations of it occur in the
sacred writings; and that we are enjoined
to be <HI>fervent in prayer,</HI> to be <HI>instant in
prayer;</HI> nay, to <HI>pray without ceasing.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thess. v. 17.</NOTE>—By
such precepts I do not understand that we
are bound to frequent repetitions of long
and tedious prayers. Our Saviour, in his
excellent discourse on this subject<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi.</NOTE>, has suf∣ficiently
cautioned us against the hypocrisy
of those who <HI>use vain repetitions, and think
that they shall be heard for their much
speaking.</HI> But besides the stated times of
<PB N="458" REF="469"/>
both public and private prayer which we
ought devoutly to observe, there is a habit
of devotion, in occasional elevations of the
soul towards God, which highly deserves
to be cultivated. A thousand occurrences
which happen when we are engaged in the
affairs of the world, and a thousand objects
which present themselves to our view in
the earth and the heavens when we are
solitary and alone, may suggest matter of
devout ejaculation towards God. By che∣rishing
such a habit, we preserve on our
minds the native spirit of prayer. We
correct those evil dispositions which inter∣course
with the world is always apt to in∣troduce;
we improve our contemplation
of the objects which surround us, into an
act of devotion; and either from the
crowded city, or the solitary field, can send
up to Heaven that homage of the heart,
which is no less acceptable to the Almighty,
than if it arose in vocal form from the midst
of the temple. In this sense I understand
the injunction given to <HI>pray without ceasing.</HI>
—And surely, my brethren, when we
<PB N="459" REF="470"/>
consider the high value of those blessings
for which we depend on Heaven, it must
appear to every reflecting mind, that we
cannot be too earnest in our supplications to
obtain them. To what purpose tend all
our present solicitude and care; all the ap∣plication
of the thoughtful, and all the in∣dustry
of the active and diligent? Is it not
in order to pass through life, contented,
easy, and happy? But can you pass through
life with contentment and happiness, unless
you enjoy peace within, a good conscience,
and a comfortable hope of a future exist∣ence?
Are not all these things directly and
immediately the gifts of God, imparted by
him to the souls of men? And can you
expect to receive such gifts, unless you con∣fess
your dependance on Him who bestows
them, and implore them from that gracious
God, who <HI>giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth not?</HI></P>

<P>THESE words present to our view the

<PB N="461" REF="472"/>
It adds solemnity to every part of religion;
it introduces an awful seriousness into our
thoughts, by placing in the most striking
light, the close connexion between our
present behaviour and our everlasting
happiness or misery. In the Gospel, it is
described with so many circumstances of
awe and terror, as may, to many, render
the consideration of this subject dark and
disagreeable. But we must remember, that
though religion be often employed to soothe
and comfort the distre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed, and though this
be one of its most salutary effects, yet this is
not the only purpose to which it is to be
applied by ministers of the Gospel. In
the midst of that levity and dissipation
with which the world abounds, it is neces∣sary
to awaken the giddy and unthinking,
by setting before them, in full view, all the
dangers they incur by their conduct.—
<HI>Knowing the terror of the Lord,</HI> adds the
Apostle in the verse immediately following
the text, <HI>we persuade men.</HI>—In treating
of this subject, I shall, in the first place,
state the arguments which reason affords
<PB N="462" REF="473"/>
for the belief of a judgment to come; and
shall next show the improvements which
we ought to make of the particular dis∣coveries
the Gospel hath made to us con∣cerning
it.</P>
<P>I. BY taking a view of the arguments
which reason affords for the belief of a
general judgment, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> faith in the dis∣coveries
of the Gospel will receive con∣firmation,
from discerning their consonance
with the natural sentiments of the human
heart.</P>
<P>IN the first place, and as the foundation
of all, I begin with observing, that there is
in the nature of things a real and eternal
difference between right and wrong, be∣tween
a virtuous and an immoral conduct;
a difference which all men discern of them∣selves,
and which leads them unavoidably
to think of some actions as deserving blame
and punishment, and of others as worthy
of praise and reward. If all actions were
conceived as indifferent in their nature, no
<PB N="463" REF="474"/>
idea of justice and retribution would be
found among men; they would not con∣sider
themselves as in any view accountable
for their actions to any superiour. But
this is far from being the case. Every man
feels himself under a law; the law of his
being, which he cannot violate without
being self-condemned. The most ignorant
heathen knows and feels, that when he has
committed an unjust or cruel action, he
has committed a crime, and deserves
punishment. Never was there a nation on
the face of the earth, among whom there
did not prevail a consciousness that, by in∣humanity
and fraud, they justly exposed
themselves to the hatred of those around
them, and to the displeasure of any secret
invisible power that ruled the world. This,
therefore, may be assumed as an incontro∣vertible
principle, that the difference of
good and evil in actions, is not founded on
arbitrary opinions or institutions, but in
the nature of things, and the nature of
man; and accords with the universal sense
of the human kind. This being the case,
it is certainly reasonable,</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="475"/>
IN the second place, to think that the
Ruler of the world will make some dis∣tinction
among his creatures according to
their actions; and if this distinction be not
made, or only imperfectly made in this
life, there will be some future state of
existence in which he will openly reward
and punish. To suppose God to be a
mere indifferent spectator of the conduct
of his creatures, regarding with an equal
eye the evil and the good, is in effect to
annihilate his existence; as it contradicts
every notion which mankind have enter∣tained
of a Supreme Being as just and
good. It would represent him as inferiour
in character to many of his creatures on
earth; as there is no man of tolerable
virtue and humanity who is not shocked at
the commission of atrocious crimes, and
who does not desire to see the guilty
punished, the innocent protected, and the
virtuous rewarded.—If there exist at all
a God who governs the world, (and what
nation has not acknowledged him to exist?)
as a governour he undoubtedly will act;
and as such, will, somewhere, and at some
<PB N="465" REF="476"/>
period or other, reward and punish, accord∣ing
as his creatures obey, or violate, that
law which he originally implanted in their
hearts.—Whether this be completely
done in the present world, is not a point
that requires long discussion. The expe∣rience
of all ages has shown, that pain and
pleasure, prosperity and adversity, are not
at present distributed by Providence exactly
according to the measure of men's probity
and worth, but are apparently scattered
with a promiscuous hand. Hence the
antient complaint, that <HI>all things come alike
to all men; that there is one event to the
righteous and the wicked; that</HI> to poverty
and disappointment the righteous are often
left, while <HI>the tabernacles of robbers prosper.</HI>
—An inference from hence might at
first view arise not favourable to the doc∣trine
we now support; but we have to
observe,</P>
<P>IN the third place, that although full
retribution be not as yet made to the good
and to the evil, yet plain marks appear of
<PB N="466" REF="477"/>
a government already begun and carried
on by God in the universe, though not
fully completed; marks of his favouring
and taking part with virtue, and of his
providing punishments for vice. This ob∣servation
deserves to be particularly attend∣ed
to, as it is one of the chief arguments
for a future judgment.—In the present
system of things, had the righteous been
uniformly happy, and the wicked at all
times miserable, future judgment might
have appeared unnecessary, as justice had
already taken place. On the other hand,
had no distinction whatever taken place in
the present system between the righteous
and the wicked as to happiness and misery,
there might have been ground to suspect
that, since universal disorder at present
prevailed, disorder would ever continue,
and never be rectified by any future judg∣ment.
But neither of these suppositions
is founded in fact. The present state of
the moral world is neither a state of com∣plete
justice and order, nor of absolute
disorder, but a state of order and justice
<PB N="467" REF="478"/>
begun and carried to a certain length,
though left as yet imperfect.—Observe,
my brethren, that in the whole structure
and constitution of things, God hath shown
himself to be favourable to virtue, and
inimical to vice and guilt. He hath made
a fixed provision for happiness to virtue,
by the powerful recommendation which it
carries to universal esteem and love; by the
manifold benefits which it procures to so∣ciety;
by the health, peace, and comfort of
mind which it brings to the virtuous man.
At the same time, from the crimes of the
wicked, a multitude of miseries is made in∣fallibly
to spring; loss of character and
esteem, and of confidence and regard in
society; health always impaired by vice;
and all comfortable enjoyment of life dis∣turbed
by an uneasy companion, which the
sinner carries about with him in his own
conscience, upbraiding him for his crimes,
and threatening him with the displeasure of
the Almighty.</P>
<P>These are not things of casual or acci∣dental
occurrence, but of universal expe∣rience,
<PB N="468" REF="479"/>
taking their rise from the constitu∣tion
of our nature, and from the sixed laws
which regulate human events. They show
us what the direct tendency of virtue and
vice is appointed by Providence to be; and
if this tendency be not, in every instance,
carried into effect, owing to circumstances
which belong to our present state of proba∣tion
and discipline, yet such an established
natural tendency carries a sufficient intima∣tion
of the will and pleasure of our Creator.
We see his <HI>throne already set for judgment.</HI>
By his beginning in this world both to
reward and to punish, we clearly behold
him acting as a governour and a judge,
and are led to prognosticate what course he
will hereafter hold. By the constitution
of things which he has fixed here, he has
as plainly signified that he favours the vir∣tuous
and is displeased with the wicked, as
if he had declared it to us by a voice from
the clouds.—Although the present state of
mankind requires that the just should some∣times
suffer, and the sinner be allowed to
prosper, the strongest presumption still re∣mains
<PB N="469" REF="480"/>
that there is a period to come, when
God will complete his righteous govern∣ment
by making the one fully blest, and
rendering the other as miserable as they de∣serve
to be; especially as we can observe,</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, that a satisfactory
account may be given why judgment is at
present postponed, and complete retribution
not made, either to the good or the bad.
We are to take notice, that even among
men, the wisdom and justice of government
do not consist in immediately rewarding
and punishing on every occasion, but in
exercising those acts of government pub∣lickly,
at such times and with such circum∣stances
as may have the most powerful
effect for the benefit of society. A similar
consideration perfectly accounts for the full
execution of justice being delayed by God in
this world; for rewards and punishments
being only begun here, but left unfinished.
Were they completed in this world to their
full extent, all the purposes of a state of trial
and discipline would be defeated. No
<PB N="470" REF="481"/>
room would be left for exercise and im∣provement
to the good in many virtues,
if they were never to under go any trials;
if they felt full reward immediately con∣ferred
on every righteous action they per∣formed,
and saw the wicked instantly cut
off, as soon as a crime was committed.
For salutary discipline, therefore, to the
good, in order to improve their virtues; and
from patience to the bad, in order to give
them room for repentance, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it and
wise that final judgment should at present
be postponed. Divine justice stands for a
while, as behind the veil, and leaves men
at full scope to act according to their dif∣ferent
dispositions, that their real characters
may be fully displayed; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idelity of the
upright be tried and proved, and the obsti∣nately
wicked left without excuse.—The
delay of judgment, therefore, and the seem∣ing
inequality that now takes place in the
ways of Providence, is so far from forming
any ground of suspicion that judgment
will never come, that, on the contrary, it is
an argument of the wisdom of the divine
<PB N="471" REF="482"/>
government, and necessarily enters into the
plans it is now carrying forward.</P>
<P>Such are the presumptions which reason
furnishes, for rendering it more than pro∣bable
that, at the conclusion of human things,
God will <HI>render to every one according to
his works.</HI> They may serve to strengthen
our faith; but on mere reasonings our
faith rests not. God in his mercy has given
us surer light in an article of so great im∣portance.
To the consideration, therefore,
of the discoveries which the gospel of Christ
hath made to us, we now proceed.</P>
<P>II. You all know how often we are
assured in the New Testament, that God
hath <HI>appointed a day in which he will judge
the world in righteousness;</HI> a day and an
hour which no man knoweth, but which
is fixed in the counsels of Heaven. In the
sacred writings a very particular account is
given us of the whole procedure of that
solemn day, accompanied with an assem∣blage
of circumstances of the most awful
and terrifick nature. The scene is such as
<PB N="472" REF="483"/>
forbids all attempts to heighten, or even to
do it justice by human description. Be∣neath
such a subject all imagination sinks.
The efforts of the declaimer or the poet
are here alike in vain.—We are in∣formed
that the last day shall be ushered in
by <HI>signs in the sun, and signs in the moon and
stars; upon the earth, distress of nations with
perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
men's hearts failing them for fear, and for
looking after the things which are coming on
the earth, for the powers of Heaven shall be
shaken. The sound of a trumpet shall be
heard, at which the dead shall rise out of
their graves. The sign of the Son of Man
shall appear. He shall come in a cloud with
power and great glory, and all the holy An∣gels
with him. A great white throne shall
be set, and He shall sit thereon in his glory.
Before Him shall be gathered all nations.
Books shall be opened, and the dead shall be
judged out of the things which are found
written in the books. He shall separate the
righteous from the wicked as a shepherd
divideth the sheep from the goats; and he shall
<PB N="473" REF="484"/>
set the righteous on his right hand, and the
wicked on his left! The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall he say to them
on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world. To them
on his left hand be shall say, Depart from me,
ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for
the Devil and his angels; and these shall go
into everlasting punishment, but the righteous
into life eternal</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke, xxi. 25. Daniel, vii. 9. Matth. xxv. 31.</NOTE>.—Whether every one
of the circumstances here set forth is to be
understood in a strictly literal sense, or with
some measure of mystical and allegorical
interpretation, it is not easy to determine,
nor is it essential for us to know. Regard
must be had to the figurative style fre∣quently
employed by the sacred writers, of
which we find so many examples in the
prophetical writings and the Book of Re∣velations,
wherein those spiritual divine
things which are above our conception,
are set forth under such representations of
sensible objects and appearances as are most
<PB N="474" REF="485"/>
calculated to strike and impress our minds.
The circumstance, for instance, of books
being opened before the Judge, as contain∣ing
a register of every man's actions, and
of the dead being judged from what had
been written in those books, is plainly a
metaphorical allusion to what is practised
among men; designed merely to convey
the strongest impression of God's strict and
accurate observation of the minutest par∣ticulars
of men's behaviour on earth. It
is sufficient for us to be satisfied, that what∣ever
tremendous grandeur may attend the
judgment of the last day, it will be con∣ducted
in such a manner as shall be per∣fectly
suitable to the perfections of the
Almighty.—Resting on such facts as are
plainly and explicitly revealed on this sub∣ject,
let us consider,</P>
<P>IN the first place, the Person who is to
act as Judge, even the eternal Son of God.
We must all, says the text, <HI>appear before
the judgment-seat of Christ.</HI> This is re∣peated
in many passages of the New Tes∣tament.
<PB N="475" REF="486"/>
The day of judgment is termed
<HI>the day of the Son of Man. The Father,</HI>
we are told, <HI>ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>geth no man, but hath com∣mitted
all judgment to the Son</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, v. 22.</NOTE>.—This con∣stitution
of Providence is, in many re∣spects,
wise, fit, and gracious. It was
highly proper that He who once, in the
cause of God and mankind, stood as a
criminal before impious judges on earth,
should be thus signally vindicated and ho∣noured,
by appearing in the illustrious
character of the Judge of all the earth. It
was fit that the character of Judge and
Sovereign should be made known, as added
to the other characters he bore, of Priest
and Prophet, in order to give weight and
authority to all his precepts, from the
awful consideration that on our obedience
to him depends our everlasting fate.—But
the most striking and important circum∣stance
in this appointment of Providence is,
the assurance which it affords us of the
perfect equity of this final judgment. For
<PB N="476" REF="487"/>
here we behold a Judge who is taken, as
we may say, from among ourselves. He
dwelt amongst us on earth, and did not
disdain to call us brethren. He knows ex∣perimentally
what human passions and hu∣man
frailties are; and what the Apostle to
the Hebrews says of him as a Priest, may
be as fully applied to him as a Judge. <HI>We
have not a Judge who cannot be touched
with the feeling of our infirmities; but One
who was in all points tempted like as we are,
yet without sin.</HI> The infinite majesty of
the Supreme Being is an object at all times
overwhelming to the mind. In the situa∣tion
of a Judge particularly, it might fill
us with dismay. But in the person of our
blessed Redeemer, that majesty is placed in
a milder light. The attribute of mercy
comes forward in so conspicuous a manner,
as to allay the dread we would otherwise
entertain. To the obstinate and hardened
sinner, the judgment of our Saviour may
indeed justly occasion terror. Well may
they be afraid of appearing before the judg∣ment-seat
of Christ, who have scorned and
<PB N="477" REF="488"/>
despised him and his religion. But to the
pious and the humble, no consideration can
carry more comfort than that they are to
appear in judgment before him who so
loved the human race as to die for them;
and from whom, therefore, may be ex∣pected
every favourable allowance which
their case will admit.—From the contem∣plation
of the Judge, let us</P>
<P>IN the second place, turn our thoughts
towards the persons who are to be judged.
These, we are again and again informed,
shall be all mankind; both the quick and
the dead; those who shall then he found
upon the earth; and all the past generations
who have finished their course, and been
long ago gathered unto their fathers. We
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>must all,</HI> says the text, <HI>appear before the
judgment-seat of Christ.</HI>—No privilege shall
exempt the great, no obscurity shelter the
low from the judgment of God. All the
frivolous distinctions which fashion and
vanity had introduced among men, shall at
that day be annihilated. No longer shall
<PB N="478" REF="489"/>
we then appear under the personated cha∣racters
of high and low, of rich and poor.—
Under the simple character of men and
subjects of God, we shall be brought forth
to be judged according to our works. In
the one great distinction of good and bad,
of righteous or wicked, all other distinctions
shall then be eternally lost.—Let the fore∣sight
of this humble the pride of the osten∣tatious
and the great. Thou who now car∣riest
thy head so high, shalt, upon the same
footing with thy lowest dependent, stand
before the tribunal of the Almighty. Thou
who now oppressest thy weak brother with
impunity, shalt then tremble for thine own
safety as much, perhaps more than he.
For <HI>there is no respect of persons with God.</HI>
—The last day is justly styled the <HI>day of
the revelation of the secrets of all hearts.</HI>
Stripped of all disguise, the character of
every man shall be unveiled to public view.
Then shall the false friend be detected, the
concealed slanderer be exposed, the secret
adulterer, the treacherous enemy, the hypo∣critical
pretender, be all brought to light—
<PB N="479" REF="490"/>
What a check should the thoughts of this dis∣covery
give to the arts of dissimulation and
falsehood? What avails it thee, O wise man of
the world! to pass for a short time with fair
colours before the eye of men, if by the
eye of God thou art already discovered, and
shalt, at last, be discovered to the view of
all mankind? If now thou art so solicitous
to conceal thy real character from the world,
and canst not bear that the designs and
intrigues which have passed through thy
mind in the course of but one day should
be all made known, dost thou not tremble
at the thought of the whole machinations
of thy life being brought forth and pro∣claimed
before assembled men and angels?
—At this great day too, when secret
vice is made known in order to be pu∣nished,
secret virtue shall be disclosed and
rewarded. The humble good man, who
passed unnoticed through the obscurity of
private life; whose days, if not marked by
any splendid deeds, were ennobled by vir∣tuous
actions, shall then be singled out
from the crowd, and brought forward as
the friend of God and Heaven.—The an∣guish
<PB N="480" REF="491"/>
of the wicked, upon the discovery
and comparison of the life of such a person
with their own, is thus beautifully described
by one of the Apocryphal writers; <HI>This
was he whom we had sometimes in derision,
and a proverb of reproach. We fools ac∣counted
his life madness, and his end to be
without honour. Now he is numbered among
the children of God, and his lot is among the
saints. But we wearied ourselves in the
way of destruction. What hath pride pro∣fited
us? Or what good hath riches with
our vaunting brought us? All those things
are passed away like a shadow, and as a post
that hasted by. But the righteous live for
evermore. Their reward also is with the
Lord; and the care of them with the Most
High</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wisdom of Solomon, v. 3–15.</NOTE>.—From this view of the persons
who are to appear before the judgment-seat
of Christ, let us</P>
<P>IN the third place, go on to the con∣sideration
of the things for which they are
to be judged. These, we are told in the
text, are all <HI>the things done in the body,
<PB N="481" REF="492"/>
whether they be good or bad.</HI> This is the
constant tenor of Scripture, that men are
to be judged <HI>according to their actions.</HI> It
is not said that men are to be finally judged
according to their principles or belief, but
<HI>according to their works.</HI> This does not
lead to any conclusion that principles or
belief are not essential in forming a cha∣racter.
Without good principles it cannot
be expected there can be any regular tenor
of good actions. But actions are the test
of principles. Whatever we may pretend
as to our belief, it is the strain of our
actions that must show whether our prin∣ciples
have been good or bad; and sup∣posing
them ever so good, whether we
have allowed them to exert a proper in∣fluence
on our conduct. The constant
doctrine of the Gospel is, <HI>by their fruits ye
shall know them. Not every one that saith
unto me, Lord, Lord, but he that doeth the
will of my Father shall enter into the king∣dom
of heaven</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. vii. 21.</NOTE>.—Of all the actions we
<PB N="482" REF="493"/>
have done, it is represented that, in the day
of judgment strict examination shall be
taken. Not our public conduct only, and
what we reckon the momentous parts of
our life, but the indulgence of our private
pleasures, the amusements of our secret
thoughts and idle hours, shall be brought
into account. According to that emble∣matical
representation given in the Gospel,
which I before mentioned as an expressive
sigure, there is an invisible pen always
writing over our heads, and making
an exact register of all the transactions of
our life.—How careful and circumspect
ought this to render us over every part of
our behaviour? If any of our actions were
of a transient and fugitive nature; if they
were to die with us, and to be forgotten
as soon as we are gone, there might be
some excuse for a loose and inconsiderate
conduct. But we know the case to be
widely different; and that what we are
doing now, we do for eternity. None of
our actions perish and are forgotten. They
will all accompany us to the tribunal of
<PB N="483" REF="494"/>
God. They will there testify, either for,
or against us; and however much we
might wish to discl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im some of them, they
may be considered <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up their voices
and saying, “We are thine, for thou hast
done us; we are thy works and we will
follow thee!”</P>
<P>It will now be said, if so severe a scrutiny
must be undergone for all we have done
and thought, who shall be able to stand
before God in judgment? How far from
innocence shall the best of us be found at
that day?—The thought is undoubtedly
alarming. But let us not despond; we are
assured, there <HI>is forgiveness with God, that
he may be feared. He is not extreme to mark
iniquity; for he knows our frame and re∣members
we are dust.</HI> Powerful is the atone∣ment
of our blessed Redeemer to procure
pardon for the greatest sinner who has been
penitent. We have all reason to believe,
that amidst numberless in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irmities which
attend humanity, what the great Judge will
chiefly regard, is the habitual pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailing
turn of our heart and life; how far we
<PB N="484" REF="495"/>
have been actuated by a sincere desire to
do our duty. This we know for certain,
that all the measures of this judgment shall
be conducted with most perfect equity.
God will not exact from any man what he
had never given him. He will judge him
according to the degree of light that was
afforded him, according to the means of
knowledge and improvement that were
put into his hands. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence, many a vir∣tuous
heathen shall be preferred before
many mere professors of Christian faith.
<HI>They shall come from the cast and the west,
the north and the south, and sit down in
the kingdom of God; when the children of
the kingdom are cast out</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiii. 29. Matth. viii. 11.</NOTE>. For, as the
Apostle to the Romans hath taught us,
<HI>they who sinned without the law,</HI> that
is, without knowledge of the written
law, <HI>shall perish,</HI> shall be judged, <HI>without
the law; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r when the Gentiles which have
not the law, do, by nature, the things
contained in the law, these having not
<PB N="485" REF="496"/>
the law, are a law unto themselves</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 12. 14.</NOTE>.—
In the account given by our Lord of the
procedure of the last judgment, in the 25th
chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, parti∣cular
stress is laid upon works of benefi∣cence
and mercy; on the hungry being fed,
the naked being cloathed, and the sick
being visited by the righteous. But though,
in that parable, no virtues of any other
kind are particularized, we are certainly
not to infer any exclusion of other parts
of duty; of piety, justice, temperance, and
purity; as requisite to the character of the
man, who, at the last day will be accepted
by God. The scope of the parable was to
impress that covetous and selfish nation of
the Jews, to whom the parable was ad∣dressed,
with a deep sense of the import∣ance
of those virtues in which they were
remarkably desicient, and which are, in
themselves so essential, compassion and hu∣manity
to their brethren.—It now only
remains.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="497"/>
IN the last place to fix our attention on
that final definitive sentence which is to
close the whole procedure of the last day,
and to terminate for ever the hopes and
fears of the human race. The righteous
are by the Great Judge called to eternal
life and happiness; and the wicked ap∣pointed
to go into everlsting punishment.
—Into those future habitations of the good
and the bad, it is not ours to penetrate.
All that we know is, that after the Judge
hath pronounced the righteous to be the
<HI>blessed of his Father,</HI> they shall be <HI>caught up

<HEAD>A
SHORT ACCOUNT
OF THE
LIFE and CHARACTER
OF
DR. HUGH BLAIR.</HEAD>
<P>DR. HUGH BLAIR was born in Edin∣burgh,
on the 7th day of April, 1718.
His father, John Blair, a respectable merchant
in that city, was a descendant of the ancient
family of Blair, in Ayrshire, and grandson of
the famous Mr. Robert Blair, Minister of St.
Andrew's, Chaplain to Charles I and one
of the most zealous and distinguished clergy∣men
of the period in which he lived. This
worthy man, though firmly attached to the
cause of freedom, and to the Presbyterian form
of church government, and though actively en∣gaged
<PB N="492" REF="502"/>
in all the measures adopted for their sup∣port;
yet, by his steady, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mperate conduct,
commanded the respect even of his opponents.
In preference to all the other ecclesiastical
leaders of the cov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nanting party, he was selected
by the King himself to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill an office which, from
the circumstances of the time, gave frequent
access to the Royal Person; “because,” said
his Majesty, “that man is pious, prudent,
learned, and of a meek and moderate calm
temper.”—His talents seem to have descended
as an inheritance to his posterity. For, of the
two sons who survived him, David, the eldest,
was a clergyman of eminence in Edinburgh,
father to Mr. Robert Blair, Minister of Athel∣stonford,
the celebrated author of the poem
intitled <HI>The Grave;</HI> and grandfather to his
Majesty's Solicitor General for Scotland, whose
masculine eloquence and profound knowledge
of law have, in the public estimation, placed
him indisputably at the head of the Scottish bar.
From his youngest son <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh, who engaged in
business as a merchant, and had the honour to
fill a high station in the magistracy of Edinburgh,
sprung the learned clergyman, who is the sub∣ject
of this narrative.</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="503"/>
THE views of Dr. Blair, from his earliest
youth, were turned towards the Church, and
his education received a suitable direction.
After the usual grammatical course at school,
he entered the Humanity Class in the University
of Edinburgh, in October 1730, and spent
eleven years at that celebrated seminary, assidu∣ously
employed in the literary and scientific
studies prescribed by the Church of Scotland to
all who are to become candidates for her licence
to preach the Gospel. During this important
period, he was distinguished among his com∣panions
both for diligence and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iciency; and
obtained from the Professors under whom he
studied, repeated testimonies of approbation.
One of them deserves to be mentioned particu∣larly,
because in his own opinion, it determined
the bent of his genius towards polite literature.
An essay, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or, <HI>On the Beautiful,</HI>
written by him when a student of logic in the
usual course of academical exercises, had the
good fortune to attract the notice of Professor
Stevenson, and, with circumstances honourable
to the author, was appointed to be read in public
at the conclusion of the Session. This mark
<PB N="494" REF="504"/>
of distinction made a deep impression on his
mind; and the essay which merited it, he ever
after recollected with partial affection, and pre∣served
to the day of his death as the first earnest
of his fame.</P>
<P>AT this time Dr. Blair commenced a method
of study which contributed much to the ac∣curacy
and extent of his knowledge, and which
he continued to practise occasionally even after
his reputation was fully established. It consisted
in making abstracts of the most important works
which he read, and in digesting them according
to the train of his own thoughts. History, in
particular, he resolved to study in this manner;
and, in concert with some of his youthful asso∣ciates,
he constructed a very comprehensive
scheme of chronological tables, for receiving into
its proper place every important fact that should
occur. The scheme devised by this young
student for his own private use was afterwards
improved, filled up, and given to the Public by
his learned friend Dr. John Blair, Prebendary of
Westminster, in his valuable work, “The
Chronology and History of the World.”</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="505"/>
IN the year 1739, Dr. Blair took his degree
of A. M. On that occasion he printed and de∣fended
a thesis <HI>De Fundamentis et Obligatione
Legis Naturae,</HI> which contains a short, but mas∣terly
discussion of this important subject, and
exhibits in elegant Latin an outline of the moral
principles, which have been since more fully
unfolded and illustrated in his Sermons.</P>
<P>THE University of Edinburgh, about this
period, numbered among her pupils many young
men who were soon to make a distinguished
figure in the civil, the ecclesiastical, and the
literary history of their country. With most
of them Dr. Blair entered into habits of intimate
connection, which no future competition or jea∣lousy
occurred to interrupt, which held them
united through life in their views of public good,
and which had the most beneficial influence on
their own improvement, on the progress of ele∣gance
and taste among their cotemporaries, and
on the general interests of the community to
which they belonged.</P>
<P>ON the completion of his academical course,
he underwent the customary trials before the
<PB N="496" REF="506"/>
Presbytery of Edinburgh, and received from that
venerable body a licence to preach the Gospel, on
the 21st of October 1741. His public life now
commenced with very favourable prospects.
The reputation which he brought from the
University was folly justified by his first appear∣ances
in the pulpit; and, in a few months, the
fame of his eloquence procured for him a pre∣sentation
to the parish of Colessie in Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, where
he was ordained to the office of the holy minis∣try,
on the 23d of September 1742. But he
was not permitted to remain long in this rural
retreat. A vacancy in the second charge of the
Canongate of Edinburgh furnished to his friends
an opportunity of recalling him to a station
more suited to his talents. And, though one
of the most popular and eloquent clergymen in
the Church was placed in competition with him,
a great majority of the electors decided in favour
of this young orator, and restored him in July
1743 to the bounds of his native city.</P>
<P>IN this station Dr. Blair continued eleven
year, discharging with great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity and suc∣cess
the various duties of the pastoral office.
<PB N="497" REF="507"/>
His discourses from the pulpit in particular at∣tracted
universal admiration. They were com∣posed
with uncommon care; and, occupying a
middle place between the dry metaphysical dis∣cussion
of one class of preachers, and the loose
incoherent declamation of another, they blended
together, in the happiest manner, the light of
argument with the warmth of exhortation, and
exhibited captivating specimens of what had
hitherto been rarely heard in Scotland, the po∣lished,
well-compacted, and regular didactic
oration.</P>
<P>IN consequence of a call from the Town-Council
and General-Session of Edinburgh, he
was translated from the Canongate to Lady
Yester's, one of the city churches, on the 11th
of October 1754: and on the 15th day of June
1758, he was promoted to the High Church of
Edinburgh, the most important ecclesiastical
charge in the kingdom. To this charge he was
raised at the request of the Lords of Council and
Session, and of the other distinguished official
characters who have their seats in that church.
And the uniform prudence, ability and success
<PB N="498" REF="508"/>
which, for a period of more than forty years,
accompanied all his ministerial labours in that
conspicuous and difficult station, sufficiently
evince the wisdom of their choice.</P>
<P>HITHERTO his attention seems to have been
devoted almost exclusively to the attainment
of professional excellence; and to the regular
discharge of his parochial duties. No production
of his pen had yet been given to the world by him∣self,
except two sermons preached on particular
occasions, some translations, in verse, of passages
of Scripture for the Psalmody of the Church, and
a few articles in the Edinburgh Review; a pub∣lication
begun in 1755, and conducted for a
short time by some of the ablest men in the
kingdom. But standing as he now did at the
head of his profession, and released by the labour
of former years from the drudgery of weekly
preparation for the pulpit, he began to think
seriously on a plan for teaching to others that
art which had contributed so much to the esta∣blishment
of his own fame. With this view, he
communicated to his friends a scheme of Lec∣tures
on Composition; and, having obtained the
<PB N="499" REF="509"/>
approbation of the University, he began to
read them in the College on the 11th of De∣cember
1759. To this undertaking he brought
all the qualifications requisite for executing it
well; and along with them a weight of repu∣tation,
which could not fail to give effect to the
lessons he should deliver. For, besides the tes∣timony
given to his talents by his successive pro∣motions
in the Church, the University of St.
Andrew's, moved chiefly by the merit of his
eloquence, had in June 1757 conferred on him
the degree of D. D. a literary honour which, at
that time, was very rare in Scotland. Accord∣ingly
his first Course of Lectures was well at∣tended,
and received with great applause. The
patrons of the University, convinced that they
would form a valuable addition to the system of
education, agreed in the following summer to
institute a rhetorical class, under his direction, as
a permanent part of their academical establish∣ment:
and, on the 7th of April 1762, his Ma∣jesty
was graciously pleased “To erect and en∣dow
a Professorship of Rhetoric and Belles
Lettres in the University of Edinburgh, and
to appoint Dr. Blair, in consideration of his
<PB N="500" REF="510"/>
approved qualifications, Regius Professor there∣of,
with a salary of £. 70.” These Lectures
he published in 1783, when he retired from the
labours of the office; and the general voice of
the Public has pronounced them to be a most
judicious, elegant, and comprehensive system of
rules for forming the style and cultivating the
taste of youth.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time in which he was occupied
in laying the foundations of this useful institution,
he had an opportunity of conferring another im∣portant
obligation on the literary world, by the
part which he acted in rescuing from oblivion
the poems of Cssian. It was by the solicitation
of Dr. Blair and Mr. John Home that Mr. Mac∣pherson
was induced to publish his <HI>Fragments
of Ancient Poetry;</HI> and their patronage was of
essential service in procuring the subscription
which enabled him to undertake his tour through
the Highlands for collecting the materials of
Fingal, and of those other delightful produc∣tions
which bear the name of Ossian. To these
productions Dr. Blair applied the test of genuine
criticism, and soon after their publication gave
<PB N="501" REF="511"/>
an estimate of their merits in <HI>a Dissertation,</HI>
which, for beauty of language, delicacy of taste,
and acuteness of critical investigation, has few
parallels. It was printed in 1763, and spread
the reputation of its author throughout Europe.</P>
<P>THE great objects of his literary ambition
being now attained, his talents were for many
years consecrated solely to the important and
peculiar employments of his station. It was not
till the year 1777 that he could be induced to
favour the world with a volume of the Sermons
which had so long furnished instruction and de∣light
to his own congregation. But this volume
being well received, the public approbation en∣couraged
him to proceed: three other volumes
followed at different intervals; and all of them
experienced a degree of success of which few
publications can boast. They circulated rapidly
and widely wherever the English tongue ex∣tends;
they were soon translated into almost all
the languages of Europe; and his present Ma∣jesty,
with that wise attention to the interests of
religion and literature which distinguishes his
reign, was graciously pleased to judge them
<PB N="502" REF="512"/>
worthy of a public reward. By a royal mandate
to the Exchequer in Scotland, dated July 25th,
1780, a pension of <HI>L.</HI> 200 a-year was conferred
on their author, which continued unaltered till
his death.</P>
<P>THE motives which gave rise to the present
volume are sufficiently explained by himself in
his Address to the Reader. The Sermons which
it contains were composed at very different periods
of his life; but they were all written out anew in
his own hand, and in many parts re-composed,
during the course of last summer, after he had
completed his eighty-second year. They were
delivered to the publishers about six weeks before
his death, in the form and order in which they
now appear. And it may grati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y his readers to
know, that the last of them which he composed,
though not the last in the order adopted for pub∣lication,
was the Sermon on <HI>a Life of Dissipation
and Pleasure</HI>—a sermon written with great dignity
and eloquence, and which should be regarded as
his solemn parting admonition to a class of
men, whose conduct is highly important to
the community, and whose reformation and
<PB N="503" REF="513"/>
virtue he had long laboured most zealously to
promote.</P>
<P>THE Sermons which he has given to the
world are universally admitted to be models in
their kind; and they will long remain durable
monuments of the piety, the genius, and sound
judgment of their author. But they formed
only a small part of the Discourses he prepared
for the pulpit. The remainder, modesty led him
to think unfit for the press; and, influenced by
an excusable solicitude for his reputation, he left
behind him an explicit injunction that his nu∣merous
manuscripts should be destroyed. The
greatness of their number was creditable to his
professional character, and exhibited a convincing
proof that his fame as a public teacher had been
honourably purchased, by the most unwearied
application to the private and unseen labours of
his office. It rested on the uniform intrinsic
excellence of his Discourses, in point of matter
and composition, rather than on foreign attrac∣tions;
for his delivery, though distinct, serious,
and impressive, was not remarkably distinguished
by that magic charm of voice and action which
<PB N="504" REF="514"/>
captivates the senses and imagination, and which,
in the estimation of superficial hearers, constitutes
the chief merit of a preacher.</P>
<P>IN that department of his professional duty
which regarded the government of the church,
Dr. Blair was steadily attached to the cause of
moderation. From diffidence, and perhaps from
a certain degree of inaptitude for extemporary
speaking, he took a less public part in the con∣tests
of ecclesiastical politics than some of his
cotemporaries; and, from the same causes, he
never would consent to become Moderator of the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
But his influence among his brethren was ex∣tensive:
his opinion, guided by that sound up∣rightness
of judgment, which formed the pre∣dominant
feature of his intellectual character,
had been always held in high respect by the
friends with whom he acted; and, for many of
the last years of his life, it was received by them
almost as a law. The great leading principle
in which they cordially concurred with him, and
which directed all their measures, was to pre∣serve
<PB N="505" REF="515"/>
the church, on the one side, from a slavish,
corrupting dependance on the civil power; and,
on the other, from a greater infusion of demo∣cratical
influence than is compatible with good
order, and the established constitution of the
country.</P>
<P>THE reputation which he acquired in the
discharge of his public duties, was well sustained
by the great respectability of his private character.
Deriving from family associations a strong sense
of clerical decorum, feeling on his heart deep
impressions of religious and moral obligation, and
guided in his intercourse with the world by the
same correct and delicate taste which appeared
in his writings, he was eminently distinguished
through life by the prudence, purity, and dig∣nified
propriety of his conduct. His mind, by
constitution and culture, was admirably formed
for enjoying happiness. Well-balanced in itself
by the nice proportion and adjustment of its
faculties, it did not incline him to any of those ex∣centricities,
either of opinion or of action, which
are too often the lot of genius:—free from all
<PB N="506" REF="516"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>incture of envy, it delighted cordially in the
prosperity and fame of his companions: sensible
to the estimation in which he himself was held,
it disposed him to dwell at times on the thought
of his success with a satisfaction which he did
not affect to conceal: inaccessible alike to gloomy
and to peevish impressions, it was always master
of its own movements, and ready, in an uncom∣mon
degree, to take an active and pleasing in∣terest
in every thing, whether important or trifling,
that happened to become for the moment the
object of his attention. This habit of mind,
tempered with the most unsuspecting simplicity,
and united to eminent talents and inflexible in∣tegrity,
while it secured to the last his own relish
of life, was wonderfully calculated to endear
him to his friends, and to render him an invalu∣able
member of any society to which he be∣longed.
Accordingly there have been few men
more universally respected by those who knew
him, more sincerely esteemed in the circle of his
acquaintance, or more tenderly beloved by those
who enjoyed the blessing of his private and do∣mestic
connection.</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="517"/>
IN April 1748, he married his cousin Katharine
Bannatine, daughter of the Rev. James Banna∣tine,
one of the Ministers of Edinburgh. By
her he had a son who died in infancy, and a
daughter, who lived to her twenty-first year,
the pride of her parents, and adorned with all
the accomplishments that became her age and
sex. Mrs. Blair herself, a woman of great good
sense and spirit, was also taken from him a few
years before his death, after she had shared with
the tenderest affection in all his fortunes, and
contributed near half a century to his happiness
and comfort.</P>
<P>DR. BLAIR had been naturally of a feeble
constitution of body; but as he grew up his
constitution acquired greater firmness and vigour.
Though liable to occasional attacks from some
of the sharp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t and most painful diseases that
afflict the human frame, he enjoyed a general
state of good health; and, through habitual
cheerfulness, temperance, and care, survived the
usual term of human life.—For some years he
had felt himself unequal to the fatigue of instruct∣ing
his very large congregation from the pulpit;
<PB N="508" REF="518"/>
and, under the impression which this feeling
produced, he has been heard at times to say
with a sigh, “that he was left almost the last
“of his cotemporaries.” Yet he continued to
the end in the regular discharge of all his other
official duties, and particularly in giving advice
to the afflicted, who, from different quarters of
the kingdom, solicited his correspondence. His
last summer was devoted to the preparation of
this volume of Sermons; and, in the course of
it, he exhibited a vigour of understanding and
capacity of exertion equal to that of his best days.
He began the winter pleased with himself on
account of the completion of this work; and his
friends were flattered with the hope that he
might live to enjoy the accession of emolument
and fame which he expected it would bring.
But the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds of a mortal disease were lurking
unperceived within him. On the 24th of De∣cember
1800, he complained of a pain in his
bowels, which, during that and the following day,
gave him but little uneasiness; and he received
as usual the visits of his friends. On the after∣noon
of the 26th, the symptoms became violent
and alarming:—he felt that he was approaching
<PB N="509" REF="519"/>
the end of his appointed course: and retaining
to the last moment the full possession of his
mental faculties, he expired on the morning of
the 27th, with the composure and hope which
become a Christian pastor.</P>
<P>THE lamentation for his death was uni∣versal
and deep through the city which he
had so long instructed and adorned. Its Magis∣trates,
participating in the general grief, ap∣pointed
his church to be put in mou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning; and
his colleague in it, the writer of this Narrative,
who had often experienced the inestimable value
of his counsel and friendship, delivered on the
Sabbath after his funeral a discourse to his con∣gregation,
with an extract from which this ac∣count
shall be closed. It is inserted here at the
particular request of that very respectable body
of men who composed his Kirk Session, and who,
by their public approbation of this tribute to his
memory, are desirous of transmitting, with his
Sermons, to posterity a memorial of the vene∣ration
and esteem with which his conduct had
inspired them.—After exhorting to contemplate
and follow the patriarchs and faints of former
<PB N="510" REF="520"/>
ages, <HI>who, through faith and patience, inherit the
promises,</HI> the Preacher thus proceeded:</P>
<P>“IN this competition for virtuous attainment
it may be often useful to bring down your
eye, from contemplating the departed worthies
of distant times and countries, towards pat∣terns
of imitation that are endeared to you by
more tender ties. If, in the relations of life,
you have had a connection,—if, in the circle
of your own family, you have had a father,
a husband, or a brother, who discharged with
exemplary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idelity the duties of his station,
whom every tongue blessed as the friend of
God and man, and who died as he lived, full
of faith and hope, place him before you as
the model of your conduct,—conceive him
bending from his seat in the skies, pleased with
your attachment, deeply interested in your
success, and cheering you in your labours of
love. His image will be as a guardian angel,
to admonish you when dangers approach, to
rouse within you every principle of virtuous
exertion, and to inspire you with strength to
overcome.</P>
<P><PB N="511" REF="521"/>
OUR hearts, Christians, have been deeply
pierced with the loss of a most valuable con∣nection,
of a venerable pastor, who watched
long for our souls, and, with the most un∣wearied
fidelity, pointed out to us the path
of happiness. To you, and to the general
interests of pure religion, he was attached by
many powerful obligations. A native of this
city, and descended from a family which, in
former times, had given several bright orna∣ments
to the Church of Scotland, he felt the
warmest tendencies of nature co-operating
with the principles of duty, to call forth all
his powers in the sacred service to which he
was devoted. And, by the blessing of God
on his industry, he rose to an eminence in
professional merit, which has reflected dis∣tinguished
honour on the city, on the church,
and on the country which produced him.</P>
<P>IT was the fortune of Dr. Blair to appear
at a period when the literature of his country
was just beginning to receive polish and an
useful direction; and when it was emulously
cultivated by a bright constellation of young
<PB N="512" REF="522"/>
men who were destined to carry it to high
perfection. In concert with them he applied
himself with diligence and assiduity to all
those branches of study which could con∣tribute
to form him for the eloquence of the
pulpit. This was the department in which he
chose to excel; to which all the force of his
genius was directed; and in which he soon
felt that his efforts were to be successful. For
from the very commencement of his theolo∣gical
studies, he gave presages of his future
attainments; and, in the societies of his
youthful companions, laid the foundations of
that splendid reputation which, through a long
life of meritorious service, continued to in∣crease;
and which has procured for him as a
religious instructor, access to the understand∣ings
and the hearts of all the most cultivated
inhabitants of the Christian world.</P>
<P>To you, my brethren, who have long en∣joyed
the inestimable blessing of his immediate
instruction, it will not be necessary to describe
the qualities of that luminous, fascinating elo∣quence,
with which he was accustomed to
<PB N="513" REF="523"/>
warm, and ravish, and amend your hearts.
You may have heard others who equal∣led,
or even excelled him in some of the
requisites of pulpit oratory, in occasional pro∣foundness
of thought, in vivid flashes of ima∣gination,
or in pathetic addresses to the heart.
But there never was a public teacher in
whom all these requisites were combined
in juster proportions, placed under the di∣rection
of a more exquisite sense of propriety,
and employed with more uniform success to
convey useful and practical instruction. Stand∣ing
on the foundation of the Apostles and
Prophets, he exhibited the doctrines of Christ
in their genuine purity, separated from the
dross of superstition, and traced with inimi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>
elegance, through all their beneficial influence
on the consolation, on the order, and on the
virtue both of public and private life. Hence
his discourses, uniting in the most perfect form
the attractions of utility and beauty, gave a
new and better tone to the style of instruction
from the pulpit; and contributed in a remark∣able
degree to correct and refine the religious,
the moral, and the literary taste of the times
in which he lived.</P>

THE universal admiration which attended
his ministerial labours, was some recompence
to him for the exertions they had cost. But
his chief recompence arose from the con∣sciousness
of having contributed so eminently
to edisy the Church of Christ, and from the
improving influence which his labours had shed
on his own heart. For he was at home and
in himself the perfect image of that meekness,
simplicity, gentleness, and contentment, which
his writings recommend. He was long happy
in his domestic relations; and, though doomed
at last to feel, through their loss in succession,
the heaviest strokes of affliction; yet his mind,
fortisied by religious habits, and buoyed up
by his native tendency to contentment, sus∣tained
itself on God, and enabled him to per∣severe
to the end in the active and cheer∣ful
discharge of the duties of his station; pre∣paring
for the world the blessings of elegant
instruction; tendering to the mourner the
lessons of divine consolation; guiding the
young by his counsels; aiding the meritorious
with his influence; and supporting, by his
voice and by his conduct, the civil and eccle∣siastical
institutions of his Country.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="525"/>
WITH such dispositions and habits it was
natural that he should enjoy a distinguished
portion of felicity. And perhaps there never
was a man who experienced more completely
that <HI>the ways of wisdom are ways of pleasantness,
and that all her paths are peace.</HI> His Country
was proud of his merits, and at different times
conferred on him, through the hands of the
Sovereign, the most honourable and substan∣tial
proofs of her approbation: foreign lands
learned from him the way of salvation: he
saw marks of deference and respect wherever
he appeared: and he felt within himself the
gratulations of a good conscience, and the
hope of immortality. It was peculiarly de∣lightful
to see him in the latest period of his
life, at the venerable age of eighty-two, look∣ing
back on almost threescore years spent in
the public service of his God, pleased with the
recollections which it gave, possessing a mind
still vigorous and clear, the delight of his
friends, sensible to the attentions which they
paid to him, burning with zeal for the good of
the Church, and, with all the ardour of youth∣ful
ambition, preparing the materials of a new
claim to the gratitude and admiration of poste∣rity.
<PB N="516" REF="526"/>
In this active slate of preparation, with
the lamp of life still clear and bright, he was
found by the Great Lord of all when he came
to say It is enough;r' and, after a single
night of pain, to call him gently to his rest.</P>
<P>“HE has gone to give an account of his
stewardship.—The Church mourns in him the
loss of her brightest ornament.—Let us sub∣mit
to the stroke with resignation and rever∣ence;
and, as the most acceptable proof of
respect to his memory, let us learn to practise
the lessons which he taught.”</P>
