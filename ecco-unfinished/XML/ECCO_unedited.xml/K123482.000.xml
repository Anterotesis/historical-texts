<OPENER>Ladies,</OPENER>
<P>THE Works of the Original Au∣thor

too Voluminous, and con∣sequently
of a large Price, I thought it
proper to single out from the <HI>French,</HI>
the ensuing <HI>Tales.</HI> which are known to
be <HI>Genuine;</HI> there being several which

and the invention of some other
<HI>Genius.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
I did not attempt this, with a De∣sign
to follow exactly the <HI>French</HI> Co∣py,
nor have any regard to our <HI>English</HI>
Translation; which, <HI>to me,</HI> are both
tedious and irkesome. Nor have I
done it by way of <HI>Invasion,</HI> having
begun some of it many Years since:
But to make it <HI>portable</HI> for your <HI>walk∣ing
Diversion,</HI> and less <HI>Chargeable:</HI> and
chiefly to set aside the Distances of <HI>Sen∣tences</HI>
and <HI>Words,</HI> which not only dis∣solve
the <HI>Memory,</HI> but keep the most
<HI>nice</HI> and <HI>material Intrigues,</HI> from a close
<HI>Connexion.</HI></P>
<P>I have indeed, in several places,
made use of some Expressions to sup∣ply
the <HI>Author</HI>'s, because I would have
them adapted more peculiarly to a <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Princess Graciosa, and Prince
Percinet.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Empire of the <HI>Fairies,</HI>
had not flourish'd many
Centuries, but there reign∣ed
in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Coun∣tries,
a King and Queen,
with so m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch Clemency
and Justice, that they had
gain'd the Hearts of all
their Subjects. They had indeed no male Issue,
to leave the Crown to, but were bless'd with
a Daughter, perfectly made Beautiful by Na∣ture
and Art. This accomplish'd Princess, for
the sweetness of her Disposition, was called
<HI>Graciosa.</HI> As she grew up, she became the
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
Queen her Mother's Darling, and consequent∣ly
wanted nothing an indulgent Parent could
give her; insomuch, that her Garb was in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sti∣mable,
her Diet most delicate, and her At∣tendants
becoming one of the greatest Prin∣cesses
in the World.</P>
<P>Among the rest of the Ladies that made up
her Father's Court, was the Dutchess of <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g∣non;</HI>
extream Rich, but monstrous Ugly, Red-Hair'd,
blear-Ey'd, hump-Back'd, bandy-Leg'd,
and every way Deform'd both in Soul and
Body. She bore an inveterate Malice to <HI>Graci∣osa,</HI>
and knowing the Lustre of her Merits
would become more transparent, by her ugly
appearance at Court, thro' Envy retir'd into
the Country.</P>
<P>In process of Time, when Fortune had run a
Series of Mirth and Tranquility, it happen'd
that the Queen sicken'd and dy'd; whose Death
afflicting <HI>Graciosa,</HI> and her Father so violently,
there was Reason to fear it would shorten
their Days. The King had kept retir'd a
whole-Year, 'till at last, persuaded by his Phy∣sicians,
he went a Hunting for the Benefit of
his Health. Upon the Borders of his Forrest he
came within sight of a stately Castle, and the
Weather being extream Hot, it oblig'd him to
leave the Chase, and ride there to refresh himself.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of <HI>Grognon</HI> (whose Castle it
was) went to wait upon his M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jesty, and con∣duct
him in. They were no sooner en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red,
but the cunning Dutchess familliarly told his
Majesty, that the coolest retirement in her
Castle, was a spacious arch'd Vaul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which she
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
desi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d him to visit. The King agreed, where,
to his surprize, he beheld, as he thought, above
a Hundred P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Wine, plac'd very orderly.
Are th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se for your own Use, Madam? (said
he.) For none but my Self and Family, (<HI>re∣ply'd
she</HI>) Will your M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty be pleas'd to take
a Glass of what Wine you like best, among all
these? Troth, <HI>said the King,</HI> if I taste any, it
shall be <HI>Champagne.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately▪ <HI>Grognon</HI> struck with a little
Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver Hammer the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a Pipe, and assoon
came out a Million of Guineas. How comes
this? <HI>said she, Laughing,</HI> Then she struck ano∣ther
Pipe, and out fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w several Bushels of <HI>Lewis
d'Ors.</HI> Hey day! <HI>cry'd she, in a surprize,</HI> What
means all this? Then she knock'd her little
Hammer against the Head of a Third Pipe, and
there were as many Pearls, Diamonds, and
precious Stones flung out, as would cover the
Floor. The cunning Dutchess to amuse the
King, cry'd out in a Passion, That she was
cheated of her Wines, by some Villains, who
had in the room thereof, only left her those
foolish Baubles; and seem'd to lament bitterly.
What▪ d'ye call these Baubles? <HI>said the King.</HI>
Why, Woman, they are of more Value than
Ten of the richest Cities in the World.
Well Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> I own it; and must confess,
there is not one Pipe here, but what is full of
Gold, and precious I wels, and they are all at
your Majesty's disposal, provided you'll consent
to Marry me, and make me as much Queen and
Mistress of your Daughter as her Mother was.
The covetous King, neglectful of his Daugh∣ter's
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
Welfare, cry'd a Match! and gave her his
Hand upon't; where at she presented him with
the Key of her Wealth, and for that time parted.</P>
<P>The King no sooner return'd to Court, but
<HI>Graciosa</HI> receiv'd him with Joy, and embracing
him, cry'd, What Sport, my dear Father?
Sport, Child, <HI>said he,</HI> why I have taken alive
Pigeon. Commit it then to my Care, <HI>reply'd
she,</HI> and I will make much of it. No, no, <HI>said
the King</HI> to tell you the Truth, 'tis the Dutchess
of <HI>Grognon</HI> whom I have met with, and taken
to Wife. Here <HI>Graciosa</HI> cry'd out to Heaven,
and in a Rage said, the Countess was ten thou∣sand
times more like an Owl than a Pigeon.
Peace, <HI>said the King,</HI> it's my Pleasure it should
be so, therefore prepare to receive her with the
same Duty you paid to the late Queen your
Mother.</P>
<P>The Obedient, but disconsolate Princess re∣tir'd
to her Chamber, in order to obey his
Commands; but, alas! her Tears and Com∣plaints
soon brought her N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse thither also, who
lov'd her intirely. The Princess having <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old
her what her Father had done, Weep-not, my
pretty Mistress, <HI>cry'd the Nurse.</HI> 'Twill be better
for you to be Dutiful to your Father; in which
you will give a noble Example becoming your
Princely Nature; promise me, therefore, to
comply with your Father's Pleasure, and Time
shall make you amends.</P>
<P><HI>Graciosa</HI> promis'd she would; and went and
dress'd herself all in Green, shaded with Gold,
her Hair hanging in Curls loose on her Shoul∣ders;
on her Head was a Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>net of J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssamine
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
and Roses; so that <HI>Venus</HI> never appear'd more
beautiful.</P>
<P>All this time <HI>Grognon</HI> was striving to wash
the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> White, by adorning herself with
all the sumptuous O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naments she could procure<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and to hide her Deformity, had made use of
a rais'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Glass Eye, Bolsters, for her Back
and Breasts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Her hagged Cheeks, and thin
Jaws, she plaister'd White, and vainly indea∣vour'd
to hide the Redness of her Hair with a
Black-lead Comb,</P>
<P>Whilst the King was making ready, <HI>Graciosa</HI>
reti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to a shady Grove, to ease her Breast with
more freedom, but whilst she was bemoaning
herself, she saw a Page coming to her, cloathed
in Green S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lk, with White Feathers in his Cap.
Asso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n as be approach'd her, he laid one Knee to
the Ground, and with a profound Reverence,
said, Madam, the King your Father waits your
presence. <HI>Graciosa,</HI> not knowing the Page,
wonder'd at his Beauty, and suppos'd him to
be one of <HI>Grognon</HI>'s Retinue. But he undeceiv'd
her, and said, Tho he kept himself unknown,
yet he was her Slave, and would never belong
to any body else: Therefore let not your High∣ness
be troubled, <HI>said he,</HI> for my Name is,
<HI>Percinet,</HI> a Prince of Wealth and Parts suffici∣ently
known, who to prevent the Misfortunes
you may fall under by your Father's Marriage,
and make you Happy hereafter, am now and
then by virtue of the Gift of <HI>Faryism,</HI> render'd
invisible to your Highness, and every body
else. However, I have always your Company,
my Heart is intirely yours; and I will for ever
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
wait upon you for your Welfare. The Princess
recovering herself from a Surprize, cry'd out,
And is it you, lovely <HI>Percinet,</HI> whom I have so
long desir'd to see? You transport me in offer∣ing
your Friendship; take me into your Care,
and let <HI>Grognon</HI> do her worst. She had no soon∣er
said this, but <HI>Percinet,</HI> who had provided a
sumptuous Horse for his beautiful Mistress, seat∣ed
her on the Saddle, whilst she suffer'd him
to lead her to her Father, and have the Felicity
of seeing his Mistress all the while.</P>
<P>Thus the King, Princess, and all the Nobility
met <HI>Grognon</HI> upon the Road; but, ala<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>! the
Beast she rode upon appear'd more like a Car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Horse,
than a Nag for a Queen: So that the
Eyes of all were only upon the beautiful Prin∣cess,
and her pretty Page in Green; which made
the ill-natur'd <HI>Grognon</HI> look as s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wre as if she
had eaten a Cart-load of Crabs.</P>
<P>The King took no Notice of this Resentment
his Head running more on Wealth than any
thing else: But when <HI>Grognon</HI> came nearer,
and saw <HI>Graciosa</HI> thus glittering, and so stately
mounted, snuffing up her Nose; She broke Si∣lence,
and said: What, shall that Puss have a
better Steed than I? Let me rather return to
my Castle, than be thus serv'd.</P>
<P>The King then order'd <HI>Graciasa</HI> to dismount,
and offer <HI>Grognon</HI> her Horse, which was done
accordingly: But <HI>Grognon,</HI> when mounted on
the Palfrey, was ne'er the more minded. Then,
forsooth, the Green Page must lead her Horse;
and so the Picture of ill Looks, rode like a
Pedler's Bundle, till she came to Court: But,
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
alas! she was no sooner there, but the noble
Steed broke loose, and ran away, dragging her
with one Foot in the Stir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>up, thro' Dirt and
Mire, till she lookt like a Cinder Wench; but
she was overtaken at last, and taken up in such
a bloody, dirty pickle, with her head bruis'd,
and a broken Arm, that never was any Carted
Bawd in such a Condition.</P>
<P>Thus they pick'd up the King's broken pie∣ces
of Earthen Ware, and carried her to his
Palace, where she was put to Bed, and the
Surgeon sent for. But notwithstanding her
Bruises, she storm'd and rayl'd-like a <HI>Billinsgate;</HI>
and swore 'twas one of <HI>Graci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa</HI>'s Tricks to
pick out such an unruly Jade only to murder
her; and sent word, That if the King did not
do her Justice, she would retire home.</P>
<P>The avaricious King, for sear of losing the
We<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lth, went and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung himself at her wretch∣ed
Feet, and told her she should be at her dis∣posal
to be punish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as she pleas'd; and accor∣dingly
order'd the trembling Princess to be de∣liver'd
immediately to her.</P>
<P><HI>Graciosa</HI> no sooner entred <HI>Grognon</HI>'s Apart∣ment,
but f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Hags siez'd and stript her to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Alabaster Skin. Flea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her! flea her! (cry'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruel <HI>Grognon</HI>) till none of that white Skin she
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s so proud of is left. Now, thought <HI>Graciosa,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could wish with all my So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, my pretty Page
was here, were it not to see my Nakedness ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pos'd.
So she submitted to their merciless
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>courging with Rods as they thought, till they
were weary: But the Princess had her Wish;
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
for <HI>Percinet</HI> had cast a Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t before their Eyes,
and made them use only Feathers for Rod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; so
that when they were sufficiently tired, they
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung on her Garments and left her.</P>
<P>The Princess retir'd to her Chamber, and
feigning an Indisposition, took to her Bed, at
which time <HI>Percinet</HI> appear'd in a Corner of the
Room, and out of Respect kept himself at a di∣stance.
The Princess soon saw him, and gave
him Thanks for a Kindness which, she said,
should ever render him dear to her. She con∣jur'd
him to be always ready to protect her, till
she was in a Condition to give him what he so
much wish'd and deserv'd: But withal, desir'd
him out of D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cency to retire at that time. He
gladly reply'd, he would punctually obey her
Orders, and increase the Respect he had for so
sweet a Mistress; and then withdrew.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Grognon</HI> supposing she had reveng'd her
self sufficiently, mended rather sooner than
could be expected; so that in a little time she
was marry'd to the King in great Pomp. At
the same time her Picture was drawn, and ex∣pos'd,
a Tournament proclaim'd, and Six bold
Knights were to maintain her the greatest Beau∣ty
in the Universe. At every Fight the ugly
Queen was present, and thought the Eyes of all
the Beholders, were upon her, when, alas! they
were fix'd on the immatchless <HI>Graciosa,</HI> who
stood behind her.</P>
<P>When the Tournament was thought to be
over, all of a sudden, a young Knight appear'd,
with a Box enamel'd with Diamonds in his
Hand, and with a loud Voice declar'd <HI>Grognon</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
to be the ugliest piece of Nature in the World;
and running against the Six Knights, unhors'd
them, and remain'd Victor. Then <HI>Percinet</HI> ex∣pos'd
the Picture of <HI>Graciosa</HI> in his Diamond
Box, at which Sight, every one knew it to be
hers; and having made obeysance to <HI>Graciosa,</HI>
he rode away, without giving any Account of
himself.</P>
<P>Had you seen how <HI>Grognon</HI> look'd at this
Affront, you would have thought she would
have burst with Envy. The Pride of her Heart
was so great, that stamping her Feet in a rage,
she turn'd to <HI>Grae<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa,</HI> and said, Dispute with
me the Prize of Beauty! Hah! if I die, I'll be
reveng'd. Ah, Madam, <HI>cry'd the Princess,</HI> I
am innocent, and own you to be the most ex∣cellent
Beauty. No, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Miss <HI>Highty-Tighty,
said</HI> Grognon, <HI>interrupting her,</HI> it shall be my
Turn next, and I'll be even with you.</P>
<P>The King was told what Danger the Princess
was in, but was deaf to any Redress; and so
the cruel Queen, when Night came, forc'd
<HI>Graciosa</HI> into a Coach, which, in a few Days,
left her in a Forrest Three Hundred Miles di∣stant,
full of Beasts of Prey, as Tygers, Bears,
Wolves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Heart of this tender Princess was ready
to break in her Solitude: She wept, she sigh'd,
and spent her time in fruitless wand'rings a∣mongst
exquisite Briars and Thorns, which pe∣netrating
her tender Skin, made the Blood
trickle from her delicate Limbs.</P>
<P>At last, overcome with Grief, she fell down,
and to herself, call'd upon <HI>Percinet</HI> with a deep
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
Sigh, when immediately all the Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the
Forrest, had lighted Tapers hanging on their
Branches; and casting her Eyes upwards, she
saw a most lovely Palace, built with Chry∣stal,
which shone as the Sun. Ah! <HI>thought
she,</HI> this is Prince <HI>Percinet</HI>'s doing; but was
fearful of the Event; and thought it better
to die, than to yield to Love in that Place.</P>
<P>Turning her Back to the Castle, she was for
running away; but alas! 'twas in vain; <HI>Per∣cinet</HI>
overtook her more beautiful than ever:
He cry'd, Ah, my dear Princess, why do you
fly your Adorer? Have my good Offices made
you distrust the Duty I shall owe? Comfort
yourself, and let not Fear harbour in that ten∣der
Breast, which is the Closet of my Soul:
You shall be happy with me in <HI>Fairy-Land,</HI>
where the Queen my Mother, and my Sisters,
will make themselves merry to see you, whom
they love as well as my sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Graciosa</HI> had nothing to say, her Senses
were charm'd, and Gratitude made Silence own
her Consent to set by him in a little Chariot
drawn by two swift-footed <HI>Harts,</HI> who ran
like the Wind. As they past along, the Prince
show'd her a Thousand Delicacies; as Shepherds
and lovely Sheperdesses, sporting on the Downs;
young Swa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns courting their Mistresses; and a
World of Amours, and other pretty Fancies,
extreamly pleasing.</P>
<P>The swift Coursers, by this time, had reach'd
the Palace of <HI>Fairy-Land;</HI> and here 'twas that
the Soul of <HI>Graciosa</HI> was ravish'd with the most
melodious Musick. The Queen and her Daugh∣ters,
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
embrac'd and led her into a stately Room,
surrounded with Christal Walls; at which
Instant, to her great surprize, she saw an exact
History of her Life to that very Minu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. Re∣covering
herself a little, says she to <HI>Percinet,</HI>
Your Artists, Sir, are very exquisite here; for
no sooner do I make the least Alteration in my
self, but it's presently engrav'd before my Face:
'True, Madam, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> it's because none of
your Perfections which possess my Soul, should
be lost.</P>
<P>The Princess smil'd, and turning to her Ma∣jesty,
had no sooner thank'd her for such a ge∣nerous
Reception, but the Tables were spread,
and nothing that could be thought Rich, or
Delicate, was wanting. The Princess fed with
a good Stomach, and replenish'd herself chear∣fully;
but the more with the Thoughts of find∣ing
<HI>Percinet</HI> in a Place where she might expect
to lose her Life by Savage Beasts.</P>
<P>When Dinner was ended, <HI>Percinet</HI> conducted
her to an <HI>Opera,</HI> wherein was represented the
Amours of <HI>Psyche</HI> and <HI>Cupid,</HI> with a great deal
of Life and Spirit, which pleas'd the Princess
<HI>Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa</HI> extreamly▪</P>
<P>The time to Rest drawing on, the Queen sent
her Daughters to conduct her to Bed, attended
by Twenty-four beautiful Virgins, who were
to be her Guard 'till the next Morning. The
Princess endeavour'd to repose herself, but in
vain: She knew all was <HI>Inchantment,</HI> and there∣fore
she told <HI>Percinet,</HI> That tho' she could not
but admire the difference of Treatment she met
with, from that of her Step-Mother <HI>Grognon,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
yet Duty to the King her Father, over-ballanc'd
at that time, any other Passion; and conjur'd
him, as he expected a solid Reward of his Love,
to conduct her in Safety home again; though
such a separation from the Queen his Mother:
and the Princesses his Sisters, might sensibly
afflict her.</P>
<P>The Prince gave her the hearing, and lookt
upon what she said to be only a Female Effort
to try the constancy of his Affection. He fan∣cied
a Night's Sleep would make her forget so
unpleasant a Theme; and therefore with a
Thousand Adieus, left her to her Repose.</P>
<P>The Morning arose with the Sun, and the
lovely Princess as bright as them both, when
<HI>Percinet</HI> stood before her, in Cloth of Gold
trim'd with Green: He knew what Dress
would please her, and therefore chose Green,
which was her Delight. Never did Heaven and
Earth render a Man more com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lear; and Na∣ture,
'till now, seem'd imperfect.</P>
<P>Assoon as <HI>Graciosa</HI> saw him, she setcht a Sigh
and said, Ah, <HI>Percinet,</HI> the remembrance of my
Misfortunes banish my Rest, and I dread the
Effects! Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Percinet <HI>passionately,</HI>
You have no reason to fear in a glace where
you reign Sovereign! Would you quit your
Admirers, for the Cruelty of a Step-Mother?
Would you relinquish the Tenderness of your
Slave <HI>Percinet,</HI> for the Severities of One who is
insatiably Cruel? Ah, Madam, forget not,
forget not yourself—I cannot help it, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Princess,</HI> 'tis the Duty I owe to a Fa∣ther,
and I should be more happy, if you would
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
join with me in the same Sentiments. But, Oh-And
here she sigh'd.—</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Percinet</HI> embracing her, put a stop to
her Sighs; and as a Testimony of his Confor∣mity
to her Will, promis'd, That after Eight
Days Diversion, he would conduct her to her
Father's Palace.</P>
<P>The Princess rejoyc'd to hear these Words?
and whilst they were discoursing together, had
a secret Desire to know what was transact∣ed
by <HI>Grognon</HI> during her Absence; and ha∣ving
notified her Mind to <HI>Percinet,</HI> he took
her to a high Tower, built on a Chrystal Rock,
on which he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her set her Foot, and hold her
little Finger on his Hips. She did, and im∣mediately
she saw <HI>Grognon,</HI> and her Father sit∣ting
together. She heard her persuading her
Father, That <HI>Graciosa,</HI> thro'. Pride, had hang'd
herself in the Cellar; and that there remain'd
nothing but to bury her: She saw him Weep
for the loss of his Daughter: She saw the sub∣tle
Step-Mother dress in a S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roud, a Wooden
Log, and put in a Coffin, to deceive the
King: She saw all this, attended with a so∣lemn
Procession, and with pompous Ceremony
laid in the Grave; every one condoling her
Death, and cursing the Wretch that was the
Cause of it; whilst her Father abstain'd from
Food, and griev'd excessively.</P>
<P>The Grief of the King was that alone which
pierc'd the Heart of <HI>Graciosa;</HI> and therefore
she earnestly implor'd <HI>Percinet</HI> to transport her
Home, to undeceive her Father.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="23"/>
The Prince endeavour'd to persuade her to
the contrary; by finding his Endeavours to
no purpose, Well, <HI>said he,</HI> I must obey you;
but perhaps you may see Cause more than
once to wish your sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> here again, tho' not up∣on
the Account of <HI>Percinet,</HI> whom you thus
punish with the severity of a hard Heart.</P>
<P>Having taken leave of the Queen, and the
Princesses, and rode together in a Chariot till
they came just without the Palace, the whole
Building fell instantly into Ten Thousand
Heaps, and was totally buried. The N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise sur∣priz'd
the Princess, but the Sight more; so that
she desir'd to know the meaning of so sudden
a D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssolution. Madam, <HI>says</HI> Percinet, <HI>some∣thing
Chagrin,</HI> it is so, my Court must be in the
Grave; nor will you ever re-enter, till the
King of Terrors has robb'd you of another
Existence.</P>
<P>Having said this they came immediately to
the King's Palace. When the Prince became
invisible; but the Princess soon flew to her Fa∣ther's
Camber, and lay prostrate before him. At
first the King suppos'd 'twas her Ghost, and
started thro' fear; but she beld by his Robes,
and soon convinc'd him to the contrary. She
told him, that she had liv'd in a Forrest, and
how cruel <HI>Grognon</HI> had impos'd upon him by a
mock Funeral of a Log; and desir'd his Pro∣tection
to screen her from further Dang<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</P>
<P>The over-joy'd King caress'd his Daughter;
and sent immediate Orders to dig up her sup∣posed
Grave; where (as she had said) all the
Cheat was discover'd Yet the King was too
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
Effeminate to punish the Treachery! And when
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was told <HI>Grognon,</HI> that the Princess was with
her Father, she ran desperately to his Apart∣ment,
swearing that she would immediately
have that pretended Daughter of his, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she
would with all her Riches, forthwith depart
this Realm; affirming, that <HI>Graciosa</HI> had hang'd
herself, and that this was an Impostor.</P>
<P>The coddle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King was so weak as to
submit; so that <HI>Grognon▪</HI> with a hellish Joy.
had her once more in possession. She soon put
her Cruelty in Execution. She caus'd her to
be thrown into a stinking Dungeon; and in∣stead
of Princely Robes, cloth'd her with
Canvas, made her wear a Tarpaulin Cap, and
fed her with Bread and Water.</P>
<P>As Afflictions recollect past Deliverances, so
this brought to Mind the Words of <HI>Percinet;</HI>
but she durst not wish herself in <HI>Faeiry-Land,</HI>
nor call to him for Relief; supposing that the
Love of that Prince was lessen'd, for which
she might thank herself.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Grognon,</HI> who had invok'd
Hell for Advice, had procur'd a Fairy to as∣sist
her, ten times more devilish than herself.
They laid their diabolick Heads together, and
consulted how they might punish her with
Tasks impossible to be perform'd by any Mor∣tal.</P>
<P>The first thing the <HI>Fairy</HI> procu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d, was a
Skein of Thread three Yards round, so thin,
that the least touch would break it; to which
there was neither beginning nor ending.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="25"/>
<HI>Grognon</HI> no sooner had it, but she carry'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the Princess, and said, <HI>Here, Hussy, unrave<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this, or I'll flea thee alive:</HI> And so left her, se∣cur'd
under three Locks.</P>
<P><HI>Graciosa</HI> viewing it, took it up to find a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
beginning, but, alas! her pretty Fingers, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fine enough, had broke it in so many places
that in despair she gave i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>over and wept. And
now she exclaim'd against her Severity to <HI>Per∣cinet,</HI>
and wish'd she had never been so cruel
She only beg'd the Favour of him to come and
receive from her Lips her last Breath.—And
here she fell a weeping.</P>
<P>The tender-hearted P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince knew all this, and
immediately went and stood before her, with
a little Wand in his Hand. <HI>I am here,</HI> (said
he) <HI>and cannot be from the Service of my Prin∣cess,
tho' I am slighted never so much.</HI> And
with that struck <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Skein with his Wand
three times, and it immediately unravel'd.
What further, Madam? <HI>says he.</HI> Will you ne∣ver
invoke me, but in your Afflictions, to vex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Lover, that cannot take back what he has
given to you? Why then will you not be
happy? You delight, surely, to be miserable,
because you know it afflicts me: If other∣wise,
what are you afraid of?—<HI>That
your Love is not real,</HI> said the Princess: <HI>Let
Time convince me it is.</HI>—Here the Prince
took his leave; and much concern'd at her Jea∣lousy,
retir'd.</P>
<P>No sooner was the Sun set, but <HI>Grognon</HI> went
to see if she had perform'd that Miracle; when
to her surprize, <HI>Graciosa</HI> modestly presented her
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
the Skein unravel'd to Perfection. She stifled
her Passion, with much ado; But told her,
She was an aukward Siut; that she had not
kept it clean, and such-like spiteful stuff; and
withal bid her remember it, with two unmerci∣ful
Blows o'er the Face.</P>
<P>The cruel Beast, thus baulk'd in her first
At empt, swell'd with Envy, and call'd her <HI>Fa∣miliar</HI>
once more. She desir'd something of
the <HI>Fairy</HI> to be impos'd on the Princess, that
might be beyond Imagination to perform.</P>
<P>'Tis agreed; and a large Tub was order'd to
be fill'd with the Feathers of all sorts of Birds
in the World; so mixt together, that the very
Birds themselves should not tell their own:
And the <HI>Fairy</HI> herself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssur'd Queen <HI>Grognon,</HI>
that it would infallibly confound the Wit and
Patience of her Slave.</P>
<P>Oh, how glad was <HI>Grognon</HI> at this News!
Revenge put Wings to her pace, 'till she came
to the Princess. The Tub of Feathers being
ready, <HI>Here, Impudence,</HI> (said she) <HI>sort these,
and lay every Plume by itself, and not one Feather
amiss.</HI> And so left her under three Locks as
before.</P>
<P>The innocent Virgin began her Endeavours,
but finding them fruitless, and the Work im∣possible,
gave it over with a Heart full of Grief.
I see now, <HI>said she, (with a Tone that could break
a Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Flint</HI>) my Death is the Life of my
Enemy; and I must submit. O that I should
have wrong'd my manifold Deliverer <HI>Percinet,</HI>
and by slighting his Love, force him to aban∣done
me in this Condition!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="27"/>
The Words were no sooner out of her M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth
but <HI>Percinet</HI> appear'd, who lay hid all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
among the Feathers. Most dear Princess, (<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he</HI>) your Troubles shall vanish by my Presen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and he who is always near to you, will con∣vince
you, that he prefers not his Life to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Love he owes you. With that he wav'd thre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
time<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Wand, and the Feathers were divide<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
according to her Wish. The Princess thank'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him, and gave him assurance of her high Estee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
But, Madam (<HI>said</HI> Percinet) does nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

resolve in my Favour?—She made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
answer, but gave a Nod, and so <HI>Percinet,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
a troubled Breast, retir'd at her Pleasure.</P>
<P>When ugly <HI>Grognon</HI> came a second time, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
found her devilish Device b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffled, 'twas thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

her cursed Temper, did not forbear abusing he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with her wicked Fists. She retir'd to he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Chamber, and sent for the <HI>Fairy,</HI> loading he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with the worst of Language, and reproach
her with Trick and Deceit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fairy</HI> at this, was as much confounde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as herself. At last she comforted her once mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>In a few Minutes the <HI>Fairy</HI> procur'd a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and gave it her; which, when once open'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P><PB N="19" REF="28"/>
<HI>Grognon</HI> did as the <HI>Fairy</HI> order'd, and dis∣patch'd
away the Princess with it; charging
her to set it upon a particular Table in the
Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le, without looking in it, as she valued
her Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>The Virgin-Traveller accoutred with nothing
but wooden Shoes, a Canv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Cown, and Tar∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
Cap, set forward with a heavy Heart;
and tho' she appear'd so disguis'd, her inc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣parable
Beauty drew after her the Eyes of all
she met.</P>
<P>At last, after many a weary Step, she sate
down to rest herself in a pleasant Meadow, by
a murmuring Brook. And whilst she was mu∣sing
on the vicissitude of Fortune, it came
strongly into her Mind to open the Box, not∣withstanding
so strict a prohibition. She strugled
with herself a great while, but at last gave way
to her Fancy, with a Design not to take any
thing out, but only to gratify her Curiosity in
seeing what was in it.</P>
<P>Well, open'd it is, when, (O wounderful!)
at that Instant the Meadow was fill'd with
<HI>Fairy</HI> Men and Women of all Ranks and Qua∣lities.
There were among them, great Numbers
of Musicians. Stage-Players, Fencers, Dancing-Masters,
Cooks, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> and not one melancholly
<HI>Fairy</HI> among them all. The <HI>Fairies</HI> of Quality
were drawn along the Banks of small Rivulets,
in Chariots of Cockle Shell by beautiful Hum-Birds,
which made a melodious Harmony;
whilst the rest Sung, Danced, Play'd. Feasted,
and Revell'd wantonly about the Meadow, to
the great Amusement of <HI>Graciosa.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29"/>
At last the Princess thought it high time to
call them into the Box, and proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n her Er∣rand;
but they all refus'd. Then she ran after
them, but they flew from her. When she pur∣su'd
them in the Meadow, they took to the
Wood; and when she follow'd 'em there,
the nimble-footed <HI>Fairies</HI> where immediately in
the Meadow.</P>
<P>Now she began to bla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e herself for her cu∣rious
Indiscretion, and repented a Thousand
times of her Folly. She saw a Necessity of
calling upon her Prince, to extricate her out
of the worst of P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rplex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and cry'd out
aloud, <HI>Ah,</HI> Percinet! Percinet! <HI>come once more
and assist thy imprudent Princess, if thy Love he
real.</HI></P>
<P>The good-natur'd Prince put a stop to a
third Call, by his appearance. She soon saw
him in his Green Cloathing. Madam, (<HI>said
he</HI>) would you ever think of me, were it not
for <HI>Grognon?</HI>—He would have said more,
but she interrupted him, saying. Believe other∣wise
and be happy; for in a little time your
Constancy shall be Crown'd, and yourself
Bless'd.</P>
<P>Never did a Lover appear more transported
with Joy at the Expressions of a Mistress, than
<HI>Percinet</HI> at the Words of <HI>Graciosa.</HI> He made
no more ado, but struck his Wand thrice upon
the Box, and the Danger was all over. 'Twould
have made a Melancholly Laugh, to see how
eager the little Fairies were (not an Inch long)
to get in one before another. So that in an
Instaut, the tiny Gentlemen with their Ma∣dams,
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
the Cooks with their Spits, and every
one plac'd themselves in the Box, with the
same Exactness and Order as at first.</P>
<P><HI>Percinet</HI> then render'd her invisible; and lift∣ing
her into his Chariot, rode with her to the
Castle; having the Happiness of a Conversati∣on,
which (as the Story goes) she was so far
from finding Fault with, that, like the rest of
her S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x, she made it one of her most valuable
Secrets.</P>
<P>When she came to the Governour of the Ca∣stle,
and ask'd for the Key in <HI>Grognon</HI>'s Name,
he smil'd, and wonder'd as her Impudence, in
asking the Question. <HI>Graciosa</HI> being refus'd,
with a severe Reprimand, Pray them, Sir, <HI>said
she,</HI> give me a Line or two, to the Queen your
Mistress, of your refusal: Which he did.</P>
<P>The Prince met her returning, and took her
into his Chariot, and drove to'ards her Father's
Palace; but by the way, got this Promise from
her, That if <HI>Grognon</HI> should load her with any
more Difficulties, she would consent to his De∣sires.</P>
<P><HI>Grognon</HI> no sooner saw her return, but all
Hell rag'd in her Breast; she rav'd and tore,
and curs'd her Fate, and laying Hands on her
<HI>Fairy,</HI> would have choak'd it, were it possible
to do so by a Fairy. <HI>Graciosa</HI> with respect gave
her the Governour's Note, and Box; but, she,
Devil-like, flung both into the Fire; and 'twas
well she did not do so by <HI>Graciosa.</HI></P>
<P>And now, without the Assistance of any
Devil but herself, her own Thoughts produc'd
this last Project.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="31"/>
By her Command, a very deep Hole was dug
in her Garden, and a Stone laid over it. She
took her Maids and <HI>Graciosa</HI> along with her a
walking. When they came near the Pit, <HI>said
she, to her Attendance,</HI> move away that Stone,
and you'll find hid a great deal of Treasure:
<HI>Graciosa</HI> was the first to obey her; and which
was no sooner done, but the wicked <HI>Grognon</HI>
push'd her in head long, and caus'd the Stone
to be laid as before.</P>
<P>Who would imagine now, but here was an
End of her? 'Twas an impossibility for <HI>Per∣cinet</HI>
to find her (<HI>she thought</HI>) buried in the
Earth; and therefore she was willing to expire
with these last Words:</P>
<P>Ah, <HI>Porcinet! Percinet!</HI> thy Revenge is just
for my persecuting Delays; but now forgive
me <HI>that</HI> which was the Effect of an unwarranta∣ble
Distrust of thy Affection. I die, I die, and
shall with more Satisfaction, were I assur'd that
<HI>Percinet</HI> would Sigh over me.—</P>
<P>Here a Noise made her start, at the openin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of a little Door, which introduc'd immediate∣ly
a pleasing Light. She saw presently fine
Gardens, full of all manner of Fruits, Flowers

<P><PB N="23" REF="32"/>
At these Words, <HI>Graciosa</HI> sell down before
her, submitted to her Discretion, and accepted
<HI>Pereinet</HI> for her Husband. The Prince over∣joy'd
at so great a Blessing, affectionately em∣brac'd
her Knees; and immediately the whole
Palace was fill'd with Musick, and Acclamati∣ons
of Joy. The Marriage was celebrated with
extraordinary Magnificence, and the Court
throng'd with a vast Concourse of <HI>Fairy</HI> Qua∣lity.
From all parts of the Earth, <HI>Fairies</HI> re∣sorted
thither, deck'd in their richest Attire, ma∣king
splendid Entries; some in Chariots drawn

<HEAD>TALE II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Leander, or the Blew-Bird Prince, and
the Princess Florina.</HEAD>
<P>IN former Days liv'd a Sovereign Prince,
whose Strength and Riches were so great,
that he was formidable to all his Neigh∣bours.
But what increas'd his Comfort, was
the enjoyment of one of the most virtuo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and
beautiful Princesses in the World. But this
Happiness lasted not long; for in a little time
the Queen died, after a violent Sickness of
fifteen Days:</P>
<P>There was a universal Sorrow to be seen for
so great a Loss; and the King having devoted
himself so much to Grief, that like one deliri∣ous,
he tore his Hair, rent his Mantle, and fast∣ed
eight Days.</P>
<P>The whole Court, fearing he might destroy
himself, us'd all their Endeavours to comfort
him, but their good Offices were in vain, and
whatever they had done prov'd unsuccessful.</P>
<P>At last, a cunning, dissembling, self-ended
Widow of Quality, undertook to banish from
His Majesty, a Melancholly that had brought
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
him to the Borders of Death. She Veil'd her∣self;
and went and humour'd his Grief; and
whilst he commended the Endowments of his
deceased Queen, she blubber'd out <HI>Elegies,</HI> en∣larging
as much upon the Qualities of her
dead Husband. And thus the subtle Widow
lamented so grievously, that it mov'd the King
to pity her, and by Degrees to forget his own
Grief.</P>
<P>Having gone thus far, she threw aside her
Veil, and with false Fire in his Eyes, put a stop
to his Tears, and manag'd her part so dexterous∣ly,
that the late Queen's Memory was forgot,
and nothing would serve his turn, but he
must take her to Wise.</P>
<P>Well, to make short on't, married they were,
to the great Astonishment of all that heard
it.</P>
<P>At the time of this Second Marriage, both
of them had two only Daughters; the King
one nam'd <HI>Florina,</HI> the Glory of the World;
and the new Queen another nam'd <HI>Truitone;</HI>
despicable, lik her Mother; of a swarthy, grea∣sy
Complexion, with a Freckle Skin, like the
Back of a Trout; and of a Temper base as
Vice could picture.</P>
<P>The Daughter must needs be a Jewel in the
Eyes of the Original; and therefore the Queen
cal,'d her nothing but her charming <HI>Trui∣tone,</HI>
in all her Discourse. And perceiving
that the secret Charms of the beauteous <HI>Florina,</HI>
had attracted the Affection of the whole King∣dom,
through Envy was resolv'd ro lessen her
Esteem in the Eyes of her Father, and this
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
she did daily, by false Accusations, Clamours,
dirty Redicules, and other Indecencies, unwor∣thy
the Notice of the sweet-natur'd Princess,
who strove to be above her Malice.</P>
<P>In a little time, there was News brought of
the Arrival of a most gallant and magnificent
Prince, called, <HI>The charming King.</HI> The Queen
having heard the News, thought <HI>now</HI> was the
time to make her Daughter <HI>Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itone</HI> happy;
and therefore caus'd her to be deck'd with the
richest Ornaments that could be got; and or∣der'd
all the brocado'd Silks, and Jewels of <HI>Flo∣rina</HI>
to be lockt up: So that when the great
King had Audience, she having nothing left
but an old Gown, thro' Modesty hid herself in
one Corner of the Room.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King</HI> was receiv'd with the ut∣most
Respect, when the Queen presented him
her Daughter <HI>Truitone;</HI> but his Looks were not
pleasant, he could see not<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in her to Af∣fect
him. The Queen perceiving him <HI>Chagrin,</HI>
seem'd to take no Resentment, but attributed,
it to his Modesty, and so past it by.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King</HI> had heard much of <HI>Flo∣rina</HI>'s
Beauty, and looking about him, desir'd to
see t'other Princess, the King's own Daughter.
<HI>There she is, standing in you Corner,</HI> said unman∣nerly
<HI>Truitone.</HI> The King immediately addrest
the blushing Princess, with so much Respect
and Love, that the Queen could not forbear
discov'ring some Resentment; and being exas∣perated
highly, prevail'd with the King to con∣fine
<HI>Florina</HI> in a Castle, so long as the <HI>Charming
King</HI> staid at Court.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="37"/>
To render all things to her Mind, she had
order'd the <HI>Charming King</HI>'s Attendance, to say
every thing that was base and scandalous of
<HI>Florina,</HI> and to make him believe, if possible,
that she was one of the most sordid, ill-natur'd
<HI>Coquettes</HI> in the Kingdom. But the <HI>Charming
King</HI> was possest with another Belief, his Affe∣ctions
were already setled; and he told those
that gave her this bad Character, That he had
no other <HI>Faith,</HI> than that it was the Con∣trivance
of herself, and deformed Daughter
<HI>Truitone,</HI> whose Memory, much more Sight,
was his greatest Torment. And that, on 'tother
hand, the Perfections of the most beautiful
Princess <HI>Florina,</HI> could only compleat his Hap∣piness.</P>
<P>When they had told this to the Queen, she
was in such Confusion, that she vow'd Revenge
to herself.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the imprison'd Princess
was bemoaning her hard Fate, and much more
the absence of the <HI>Charming King,</HI> who had al∣ready
possess'd her Heart. She cry'd and wept
bitterly, and often threw out Invectives against
that innocent Beauty of hers, which had thus
inthrall'd her.</P>
<P>The Queen at the same time was also plot∣ting
how to bring over the <HI>Charming King,</HI>
and therefore sent him some of the richest Pre∣sents
in the World, requesting him to be the
Lady's Champion that sent them. Among
the rest was, <HI>The Order of Love</HI>'s <HI>Knighthood,</HI>
which was a Golden Heart, set with many
Diamond Dartt about it, and pierced with an
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
Arrow, bearing visibly this Motto:
<Q>Wounded but by One▪</Q></P>
<P>Likewise a Book Bound in a Gold Cover,
containing the Laws of that Order. In short,
there was never an Emperor before able to make
such a Present.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King</HI> was ravish'd with it, and
the more when he fancied it came from the
Pincess <HI>Florina,</HI> of whose Imprisonment he
wras hitherto ignorant. But when he was told,
that it came from <HI>Truitone,</HI> he said to the Mes∣sengers,
<HI>No: I'll be none of her Champion; it is
inconsistent with my Honour to be at the disposal
of those I can't fancy; therefore thank your Mi∣stress
in my Name, and take back the Presents
again.</HI></P>
<P>Never did Envy and Malice rage more, than
in the Breasts of the Queen and <HI>Truitone:</HI> They
took this Resusal with the utmost Frenzy, and
would if possible have burst at the Thought<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the <HI>Charming King</HI>'s Affection for <HI>Florina.</HI>
And when they saw him approach, enquiring
peremptorily where <HI>Florina</HI> was, the Queen,
told him, with something of Warmth, that it
was the King her Husband's Pleasure, that she
should not be seen, 'till her Daughter <HI>Truitone</HI>
was married.</P>
<P>At this smart <HI>Answer,</HI> the King, with an
Air of Indifference, gave both of them an
unwelcome Look, and without Ceremony,
left them to their own base Genius.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="39"/>
When he had retir'd, and had leisure to
think, it came into his mind, to Bribe some of
the Princess's Maids, to come to a Sight of <HI>Flo∣rina;</HI>
and intimating this Design of his to a
young Nobleman that attended him, they soon
procur'd one, who promis'd to take npon her
the Business.</P>
<P>But, ah! the Wretch was false: She gave in∣telligence
of all to the Queen, and this brought
about the first Misfortune to the <HI>Charming King.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Truitone.</HI> being told his Intentions, order'd
the false Confident to proceed, and tell him,
That he should be bless'd with an Hour's Con∣versation
with her at Night, through a little
Window; but withal to charge him, as he va∣lu'd
his Life, to keep it Secret.</P>
<P>The King rejoyc'd exceedingly, and long'd
till Night came, whilst the Queen had order'd
her Daughter <HI>Truitone,</HI> to personate the Princess
and gave her Instructions accordingly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King,</HI> at the time prefixt, was
conducted thither, and there in whisp'ring Ac∣cents,
express'd his Affections to the Counterfeit
<HI>Florina,</HI> which she as gladly receiv'd. He told
her, he would contrive her Escape, and bestow
on her two Diadems, his Heart and Crown; and
to assure her of his Constancy, gave her a Dia∣mond
Ring, as a Pledge of his royal Promise.
<HI>Truitone</HI> counterfeited Tears and Sighs, and
faintly told him, she would be at his Disposal,
provided it conduc'd with his own Safety.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King,</HI> pleas'd with his Conver∣sation,
had staid so long, the Day-light put him
in mind to with-draw; so that he took his
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
leave for that time, with her consent to receive
another Visit from him in the same place, the
next Day.</P>
<P>As angry as the Queen and <HI>Truitone</HI> had been
hitherto, now they seem'd as joyful; and the
Night appointed being come, the <HI>Charming
King</HI> had got ready a Chariot drawn by flying
Frogs; and repairing to the Castle, found his
supposed Princess ready, at a Window design∣edly
left open. In a Minute he took her in his
Arms, and seating her in the Coach, ask'd her
in what place she would have the Marriage
consumated. The Counterfeited reply'd, if he
thought fit, it might be at her <HI>Fairy</HI> God-mo∣thers,
who liv'd in a Castle not far off. Be it
so <HI>said the Charming King,</HI> to his Coursers; who
no sooner heard where they should take their
Journey, but they flew thro' the Air, and in a
little time arriv'd at the <HI>Fairy</HI> Castle.</P>
<P>When <HI>Truitone</HI> had privately confer'd with
her God-mother, and told her what Artifices
she us'd to bring over the <HI>Charming King</HI> to
her Embraces, desiring her withal, to assist her
at this critical Juncture; 'Tis to no purpose;
(said <HI>Soussio</HI>) it's all but labour in vain; <HI>Flo∣rina</HI>
has his Heart already: However, to sa∣tisfy
you. I'll try some Experiments peculiar to
my <HI>Fairy</HI> Art.</P>
<P>Away went <HI>Soussio,</HI> with <HI>Truitone</HI> unveil'd, to
the King, who stood amaz'd to see his deform∣ed
Enemy, instead of the lovely <HI>Florina,</HI> whom
he impatiently expected.</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>said the angry Fairy,</HI> marry my Daughter
by fair means, whom you have promis'd, and
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
given a Pledge. Not I, <HI>said the King;</HI> you
had as good persuade me to marry a lewd
Cinder-Wench. <HI>Charming King,</HI> said <HI>Sossio,</HI>
be not so rash: Do you know what Respect
you owe here? I will respect you as a Fairy,
<HI>said the King,</HI> give me but my true <HI>Florina:</HI>
Am not I she, (said <HI>Truitone</HI>) whom you pro∣mis'd
so faithfully at the little Window? And
is not this King a Witness of it? 'Tis all a
Cheat; (<HI>reply'd the King</HI>) therefore come, my
little pretty Frogs, let's be gone, and leave 'em
to themselves. Hold, (said <HI>Soussio</HI>) ask me
leave first: And touching him with her Fin∣ger,
he was as it were nail'd to the Floor. If
you kill me, (<HI>said the Charming King</HI>) I will
not take my Heart from <HI>Florina;</HI> and therefore
use the utmost of your Pleasure.</P>
<P>They kept him in this Posture six Weeks,
using all the fair and foul means to persuade
him; but <HI>Soussio</HI> knowing it impossible, once
more said, <HI>Will you marry her, or not?</HI> I will
not marry such a filthy Brute, (<HI>said the King</HI>)
nor trouble my self with her. She shall not
trouble you; (said <HI>Soussio</HI>) and therefore, for
breaking your Oath, you shall be a <HI>BLEW∣BIRD</HI>
for Seven Years: With that she open'd
the Window, and said. You have nothing else
to do now, Master <HI>Blew-Bird,</HI> but to take your
Flight.</P>
<P>She had no sooner said it, but he became so,
in the bigness of a Dove, with an Ivory Bill,
and a tufft of milk-white Feathers on his little
Head; and so stretching his Wings, left Sight
of the Castle in an Instant.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="42"/>
The <HI>Charming King</HI> being fled, <HI>Soussio</HI> sent
<HI>Truitone</HI> home, with an Account of what had
happen'd: But the Rage the Queen her Mo∣ther
flew into, was inexpressible. Well, (said
she) <HI>Florina</HI> shall suffer for all his Obstinate
Slights.</P>
<P>With that she deck'd her Daughter with the
Robes of a new-married Queen, put a Crown
on her Head; and to tantalize <HI>Florina</HI> the more,
made her wear the Diamond Ring on her Fin∣ger,
and the marriage-Ring studded with Ru∣bies,
on her Thumb, which the <HI>Charming King,</HI>
they said had given her.</P>
<P>Thus equip'd, with a vast Retinue of Lords
and Ladies, they went to the Tower where the
beautiful Princess lay, and there told her, that
<HI>Truitone</HI> was happily married to the <HI>Charming
King;</HI> and that they were come to bring her
some Marriage-Gifts, which were inestimable:
and so laid them down before her, whilst the
sly <HI>Truitone</HI> discover'd in particular to <HI>Florina,</HI>
the Diamond-Ring, which she knew belong'd
to her <HI>Charming King.</HI></P>
<P>The distressed Princess, believing all they
said, in the midst of insupp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtable Grief: fell
into a Swoon: And had she never recover'd,
her cruel Enemies would have bless'd them∣selves
for Joy.</P>
<P>The Queen, pleas'd at this Mortification,
would suffer none to relieve her; but with her
<HI>Trouty</HI> Daughter, left her to the Care of her
own Fate.</P>
<P>Yet Fortune had still a Kindness for her▪
In a little time she recover'd; but spent the
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
tedious Hours of Night, at her Chamber Win∣dow,
breathing into the Air, Sighs and Tears,
and bemoaning her miserable Condition, until
Day-break made her retire to prevent a Disco∣very.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King,</HI> who had fled for some
time among the Myrtle and Cypress-Trees, sing∣ing
nothing but melancholly Songs, flew at last
to'ards the Castle where his Princess lay; and
because he would not be discover'd by <HI>Trui∣tone,</HI>
resolv'd to sing but seldom, and that in
the Night.</P>
<P>He had observ'd a very tall Tree, adjoyning
to the Castle, whose Boughs of Cypress came
directly to her Window, and there the <HI>Blew-Bird</HI>
took delight to spend his pensive Hours.</P>
<P>The gilded Moon appearing one Night, he
saw a Lady bemoaning herself at a Chamber-Window
in the following manner.</P>
<P>Unhappy I. that I cannot mean Death, since
my <HI>Charming King,</HI> the Soul of my Life, torn
from me by the lew'd Embraces of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul
<HI>Truitone!</HI> What greater Cruelty could'st thou
inflict on an innocent Virgin, thou barbarous
Queen? And yet thou thankst that Torment
insufficient, since I must fall a Victim to thy
unsatisfied Revenge, within th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se flinty Walls.
O hapless Virgin, that once was thy Father's
Delight, art now lost to his Memory. O cruel
Fortune, cease my Grief, or put an End to thy
Inconstancy, by sending me quick into another
World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blew-Bird</HI> heard these Complaints, and
knew them to be the Voice of Princess, who
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
had proceeded farther, had he not interrupted
her thus.—</P>
<P>Ah, Madam, would you be so cruel, to put
the World in Mourning for so incomparable
a Princess?</P>
<P>Can there be any one so good, as to Com∣fort
me thus? <HI>said she.</HI> Heav'ns! who is it?</P>
<P>'Tis a King, <HI>cry'd the Blew-Bird;</HI> and to con∣vince
her that he was so, flew directly to the
Window, and told her all the wicked Practi∣ces
of her Step-mother and Daughter; and how
the Fairy <HI>Soussio,</HI> had transformed him into what
he was, for the space of Seven Years, for refu∣sing
to marry the deformed <HI>Truitone.</HI> Behold,
therefore (<HI>added he</HI>) your <HI>Charming King,</HI> tran∣sported
with infinite Joy, to see once more his
beautiful <HI>Florina.</HI></P>
<P>The Princess, amidst a secret Satisfaction,
could not forqear wondering how so <HI>little</HI> a
Bird should be so <HI>great</HI> a Monarch. At which
he hopp'd upon her Hand, and confirm'd her
Belief, by relating every material Accident
with a thousand indearing Expressions.</P>
<P>Had you been by, to have seen the Concern
these two Lovers were in, you would have wish'd
yourself a <HI>Blew-Bird</HI> too: For she st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ok'd his
pretty Feathers, and kiss'd his Ivory Bill a
thousand times, whilst he fluttering in her
Breast, ravish'd it with as many Songs of his
Faithfulness and Constancy.</P>
<P>In short, Words cannot express the Tran∣sports
that past between them, for Joy they had
met again: When they pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted in the Morning
they thought every Hour ten, till the Night
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
came. The Princess all Day was fearful that he
should fall a Prey to some ravenous Bird; and
he was as anxious about the tediousness of his
Transformation, and the Welfare of his Prin∣cess.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blew-Bird,</HI> to make the time less tedious,
resolv'd to do something extraordinary for his
Mistress; so that at certain tim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he flew to his
own Palace, and brought away Barcelets, Dia∣monds,
Pendants, a rich Watch in a Pearl,
Bodkins, Necklaces, Jewels, and every thing
that was rich and valuable, and gave 'em like
a true Courtier, to his lovely Princess, saying,
My adorable Beauty, accept of these, and wear
'em for the sake of thy <HI>Blew-Bird.</HI> Yes, my
pretty Charmer, <HI>cry'd the Princess,</HI> provided you
could see me in the Day. I'll watch my Op∣portunity
(<HI>added he</HI>) for that: And the next
Day, as the Sun arose, he saw from the Bough<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the Tree, the Princess in all her Splendour.
He lookt earnestly on her, and then on the
Sun (for you must know he had Eagle's Eyes)
and after some Dispute with himself, about the
Gay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of each other, he gave it in favour of
his Mistress; who all that time beheld <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
with Maiden-Blushes, and every thing we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Lovely.</P>
<P>Two Years thus stole away, whilst the am∣bitious
Queen was coutriving to marry he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Daughter <HI>Truitone.</HI> She had for that purpose
invited all the neighbouring Princes, but they
refus'd, agreeing all in this Answer, That if she
would offer the incomparable Beauty <HI>Florina,</HI>
they should think themselves everlastingly hap¦py
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
in such a Match; but as for <HI>Truitone,</HI> she
might live single for them.</P>
<P>The Queen finding all her Endeavours hi∣therto
frustrated, believ'd <HI>Florina</HI> might hold
some private Correspondencies with Foreign
Princes; and therefore, <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Wrong,</HI> she was
resolv'd to impeach her of High-Treason: con∣cluding,
that she should never succeed in her
Designs, so long as the beautiful <HI>Florina</HI> was
alive.</P>
<P>Big with this Project, she went one Night
to <HI>Florina</HI>'s Appartment, with her Daughter
<HI>Truitone;</HI> and when they came to the Chamber-Door,
the Queen listn'd, and heard the follow∣ing
Song, which <HI>Florina</HI> and the <HI>Blew-Bird</HI>
were then Singing in two Parts, at the Cham∣ber-Window.</P>
<Q><L>Tho', my Dear thy Fate is hard,</L>

<L>Torments, which I never fear'd,</L>

<L>In spite of all their Hellish Spleen.</L>
<L>Thou shalt be <HI>King,</HI> and I thy <HI>Queen.</HI>—</L></Q>
<P>The Queen hearing these Words, stamp'd

<HI>Treason!</HI> bursting open the Chamber-Door.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="47"/>
<HI>Florina,</HI> to save her <HI>Blew-Bird,</HI> had just time
enough to let him fly from the Window, when
the Queen approach'd with Fire in her Eyes,
We have been inform'd of your Plots by others,

Witnesses of your Conspiracy. to Dethrone
your Father and I, and possess your self of his

but it's very strange, that a helpless Vir∣gin,

You mean the Devil, (<HI>said the snaopish Queen</HI>)
but your Witchrafts are well known to me
and your Father; and we'll take care to do
you Justice: And so they left her to vent her
Grief.</P>
<P>The Queen was as good as her Word: For
being told, That if <HI>Florina</HI> had the Protection
of a <HI>Fairy,</HI> the only way would be load her
with fresh Severities: And so she did with a
Vengeance.</P>
<P>She order'd a spiteful Wench to lye with her,
and watch all her Actions; fo that now her
royal <HI>Blew-Bird</HI> could no more converse with
her at her Chamber-Window: All her Com∣plaints
were made inwardly to herself, whilst
he was as much perplex'd to see himself de∣priv'd
of his Happiness by so vigilant a Spy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blew-Bird</HI> now grew melancholly, and
sung sorrowfully to himself in the Woods and
Groves about the Castlr. But <HI>Florina</HI> having
observ'd her She-Spy to be overcome with te∣dious
Watching, and that she was fallen into a
deep Sleep, stole to the Window and sung thus.</P>
<Q><L>Come, my pretty, gentle Bird,</L>
<L>Whose Livery is <HI>Blew,</HI></L>
<L>Thy Constancy is <HI>True</HI> to me,</L>
<L>And mine is so to you.</L>
<L>Then hither to thy Princess fly,</L>
<L>That on thee I may cast an Eye.</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Blew-Bird</HI> heard, and knew so well her
Mind, that he obey'd her Call, and flew direct∣ly
to the Window, where they afresh renew'd
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
their Loves, with all the tendernesses, and in∣dearing
Passions that could be. They wish'd
their Spy might sleep eternally; but whilst
they were in vain wishing, the Slut awak'd and
forc'd a Separation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blew-Bird</HI> had many such an Opportu∣nity,
for as often as the Spy fell asleep, <HI>Florin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
would call him as she had done before.</P>
<Q><L>Come, my pretty, gentle Bird,</L>

<L>Then, hither to thy Princess fly,</L>

<P>But, alas! one time he had obey'd her Call
and whether the Spy had some frightful Dream
or, the Lovers talk'd too loud, they knew not
but so it happen'd, that she awoke, at a tim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
when the liget of the Moon discover'd to h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

in a Surprize, to see a Beautiful Bird addres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Florina</HI> with all the Actions of a Lover; whil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

them of every thing that accur'd, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P><PB N="41" REF="50"/>
Is it so? <HI>said the Queen,</HI> storming. A very

of the least Comfort, has now all the
Happiness a Heart can wish. Well, <HI>Truitone,
cry'd she,</HI> we'll be qnick in Revenge, and soon
make her truly sensible of the Death of a Lo∣ver.</P>
<P>The Spy was order'd back with fresh Instru∣ctions,
to appear now and then over-sleepy on
purpose to make new Discoveries; whilst the
Queen had order'd the Boughs of the Cypress-Tree
to be hung with Pen-Knifes, Razors, Ten∣ter-Hooks,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> expecting something Tragical
to the <HI>Blew-Bird.</HI></P>
<P>She had in some measure her End; for the
beautiful Bird, by flying and hopping too and
fro, was so lamentably Wounded, that he could
scarce reach to his hollow Lodging in the For∣rest.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Florina</HI> seen him bleeding in his Nest,
bemoaning the loss of a Life, (as he thought)
which he only kept for her sake; she must have
dissolv'd into Tears. She had sung often, and
often, her usual Song, little thinking that he
was taken up with nothing but Sighs and Re∣flections
upon the severity of his Fate.</P>
<P>He could now and then suffer himself, with
a great deal of Pain, to believe that his Princess
was concern'd in the intended Massacre, and
made her Peace with the Queen, at the Expence
of his Blood: And this Thought was so
strong upon him one Day, he had certainly
laid violent Hands upon himself, had not his
old Friend the <HI>Enchanter</HI> prevented it.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="51"/>
The <HI>Blew-Bird</HI> having told the Enchanter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
(who was sensibly touch'd with his Afflictions)
how he became transform'd, and the occasion
of his being Wounded, he made no more ado<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but by Virtue of his Styptick Charms, staunch'd
the Blood, and heal'd his Wounds. Then the
<HI>Blew-Bird</HI> (giving way to Jealousey) told him,
that the Cause of his present Misfortunes, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the fair, but cruel <HI>Florina,</HI> who had sacrific'd
his Life to free herself from a Prison.</P>
<P>Say you so? (<HI>said the Enchanter</HI>) O base<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
perfidious Wretch! Learn to forget her, then,
and all the rest of her ungrateful Sex. Con∣cluding,
That when there is an Excess of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Grief, Reason is thrown aside, Counsels are
useless; and that every thing having its Course,
'twas in vain for him to be impatient, since▪
the lucky Hour would come in its own time,
and no sooner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blew-Bird</HI> own'd all this; yet could not
forget his Mistress: However, he prevail'd
with the Enchanter to keep him safe in a Cage,
the remaining five Years, that he might be
freed from the many Dangers he was at present
expos'd to.</P>
<P>The Princess <HI>Florina</HI> not hearing any thing
of her royal <HI>Blew-Bird,</HI> lamented bitterly, and
took on at such a rate, that she pin'd away to
a meer Skeleton; and the thoughts of his be∣ing
facrific'd to the Rage of the cruel Queen,
and <HI>Truitone,</HI> put her upon wishing every
Breath her last.</P>
<P>During these Troubles of our two Lovers,
which were cause of Mirth to the Queen; the
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
hardships of Fortune began to be quite spent:
For whilst, as I said, the Queen and <HI>Truitone</HI>
were making themselves merry with their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is
fortues, the King (<HI>Florina</HI>'s Father) fell sick,
and dy'd.</P>
<P>He was no sooner dead, but there happen'd
a great Insurrection in favour of the Princess;
nor would the Nobility and Commons, be ap∣peas'd,
'till <HI>Florina</HI> was brought from the Tow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,
and elected Queen, notwithstanding the Me∣naces
of the Queen Dowager. Nay, they were
so incensed against her Administration, that
they broke into the Chamber where she was,
took her by the Hair of the Head, and dash'd
her Brains out against the Pavement; whilst
her Daughter <HI>Truitone</HI> (narrowly escaping their
Rage) with much ado, got safe to her Fairy
God-mother <HI>Soussio.</HI></P>
<P>The Princess was no sooner Crown'd, but
her Health was consulted by the chiefest Phy∣sicians;
so that in a little time she perfectly
recover'd.</P>
<P>She then bethought herself of her <HI>Blew-Bird,</HI>
and of taking a Journey round the World, in
order to find him. And having order'd the
Regency in her absence, she took with her a
sufficient quantity of Jewels, and went away
unknown.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Enchanter, who was
in pain for the royal Bird in the Cage, took a
Journey to the Fairy <HI>Soussio,</HI> to try if he could
prevail with her to restore him to his former
Shape.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="53"/>
Now, you must know, that this Enchanter
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, were old Cronies, and could com∣mand
any thing of each other; and therefore
he thought his Journey the more expedient.</P>
<P>However, all that he could do with her, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to persuade her to restore him to his Shape, up∣on
this Provision, That her God-Daughter <HI>Tru∣itone</HI>
should at the same time be sent with him
to his Palace, to reside there some Months:
And that if she could not, during that time,
prevail with him to marry her, then he should
become a <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew-Bird</HI> again.</P>
<P>Things being thus settled, the Necromancer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
(whilst <HI>Truitone</HI>'s Equipage was getting ready)
went and fetcht the Royal Bird, who had se∣veral
times felt the Cat's Claws, want of Wa∣ter,
and fall of the Cage, in his Master's ab∣sence,
even to the endangering his Life. S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣careless

<P>However, he no sooner arriv'd at <HI>Soussio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Castle, but the old Fairy strok'd him thrice or▪
the Back with her Wand, and immediately he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
became as he was before, the most <HI>Charming King<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
that ever Eyes beheld; but very uneasy at the

often to consent to marry the def<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmed <HI>Truitone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></P>
<P>All this time, the Princess <HI>Florina,</HI> disguis'd
like a Farmer's Daughter, had travell'd by Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Land, and took many weary Step to n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

extream hot, and ty'd up her Silver Hair,
and step'd in to Bathe her Feet. At the same
time appear'd on the Bank side, an antient Wo∣man
leaning on Crutches, who called to her, to
know why she ventur'd to bathe herself in that
Brook, without Company.</P>
<P>I am not alone, M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, <HI>said the Princess,
weeping,</HI> for I have all the Vexations of this
World in my Breast.</P>
<P>Cease your Fears, <HI>said the old Woman,</HI> and
tell me what troubles you, and all will be well.</P>
<P><HI>Florina</HI> putting Confidence in what she said,
gave her an Account of all that had happen'd
to her, to that very Day.</P>
<P>In short; the aged Cripple told her, that the
<HI>Blew-Bird</HI> she sought for, was now restor'd to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is first Shape by her Sister <HI>Soussio;</HI> and that he
was in Possession of his Kingdom. Take there∣fore,
these Four Eggs, (said she) and when you
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re in Distress by the way, break one at time,
and they will certainly releive you. Be quick

Farewel—And having so said, immediate∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
vanish'd.</P>
<P><HI>Florina</HI> over-joy'd at this News, took up the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggs, and put them in a little Bag of Wheat
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich hung by her side, and steer'd her Course
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irectly for the <HI>Charming King</HI>'s Palace.</P>
<P>She had not gone far, but the First Difficul∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
she met with, was a prodigious high and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep Mountain of Ivory, which she must una∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idably
go over. She began to ascend it, but;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as! her Feet did nothing but slip, as often as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> trod upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="55"/>
In the heighth of Despair she made use of
one of the old Woman's Experiments, and
broke an Egg: It was no sooner done, but
out dropt several Cramp-Irons, which she fast∣ned
to her Hands and Feet, and so got to the
top with ease.</P>
<P>When she was at the highest pitch, a great∣er
Difficulty appear'd than before: For t'other
side was all pure Looking-Glass, ten times more
steeper. Millions of Men and Women stood
before it, admiring themselves. Here all those
that were Deform'd, appear'd extreamly Beau∣tiful;
the old gouty Cripple, frolicksome and
young; and in short, every one what they
pleas'd to be themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Florina</HI> was no sooner seen on the top, (she
being the first that ever was seen there before)
but the Women screem'd and cry'd out to her,
and the Men halloo'd in a frantick manner;
not so much for the Danger she was in, but
for fear their Idol Looking-Glass should be
broke to pieces.</P>
<P>The Queen seeing this, could not forbear
smiling; with that she broke the second Egg,
and out came two Doves with a Chariot, which
in a Minute grew big enough to hold her. She
stept in, and they flew gently with her to the
bottom. From thence she prevail'd with them
to fly with her to the charming King's Palace
Assoon as she arriv'd within the Suburbs she
dismiss'd them, giving to each an inestimabl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Kiss for their expeditious Pains; a Kiss as chast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="56"/>
Before she entred the City, she thought it
proper to disguise herself in the Habit of a Scul∣lion.
Then she immediately enquir'd the Way
to the Palace, and ask'd what place was most
proper to stand and see the King in.</P>
<P>To Morrow, to Morrow (said they) his Ma∣jesty
goes to Church to be Married to the Lady
<HI>Truitone.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Florina</HI> heard this, she fell into such an
Agony, that she had much ado to survive the
News.</P>
<P>Well, upon second Thoughts, she overcame
her Grief, and stifled her Resentments for that
time; not forgetting inwardly to reproach him
for his Perfidy, who was thus going to Reward
her for all the Troubles she had labour'd un∣der
for his sake.</P>
<P>She took a mean Lodging, went to Bed Sup∣perless
and by break of Day, went to the Tem∣ple;
where with much Difficulty she got in,
and beheld two Imphrial Thrones, one for the
King, and t'other for ugly <HI>Truitone.</HI></P>
<P>Passion had like to have made a Discovery,
but still she commanded herself, and went and
stood by the Throne of her Rivaless. Imme∣diately
in comes the charming King, more char∣ming
than ever, and the ugly <HI>Truitone</HI> as ill∣natur'd
as ever, tho' in a magnificent Dress:
For, she had no sooner seen the disguised <HI>Queen</HI>
but the snappish Beast waspishly cry'd, What
Trollop art thou, Hussy, that standest so near
my Throne?</P>
<P>I am come with a great many Rarities to
Tell you, Madam (said the Queen) and I go by
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>
the Name of Gammar <HI>Souillon:</HI> And out she
drew the Bracelets, the charming King had for∣merly
given her.</P>
<P>Fine Knick-knacks indeed (said <HI>Truitone</HI>)
worth Ten Shillings the Pair; Ha, Gammar
<HI>Souillon,</HI> Ha!</P>
<P>You wrong your Judgment (cryes the Qu.)
pray Madam show 'em to his Majesty.</P>
<P>So the Beast follow'd her Directions, and
went to the King's Throne with them. The
King remembred the Bracelets he had bestow'd
on <HI>Florina;</HI> and his Colour came and went
surprisingly: But setting a good Face on't,
he told <HI>Truitone,</HI> that he had such a Pair once,
more valuable than a Kingdom, but that there
were more of the same, he could never yet
learn.</P>
<P>With this Answer she return'd to <HI>Florina,</HI>
and said, Well, Gammar, what must you have?</P>
<P>They're unvaluable, said she, yet I desire but
one Night's Lodging for them, in the Cabinet
of <HI>Eccho's.</HI></P>
<P>Ay, marry, and welcome, said <HI>Truitone,</HI> that
you shall have. And so gave Orders accord∣ingly.</P>
<P>By the way you must know, That this Ca∣binet
of Eccho's was a Contrivance so ingeni∣ous,
that the softest Whisper in it might be
heard in the King's Bed-Chamber; and of this
Cabinet the charming King had told the fair
<HI>Florina</HI> formerly, so that it came into her Head
now, that here she might reproach him for his
unfaithfulness.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="58"/>
But here an unlucky Accident happen'd.
The King grieving for <HI>Florina,</HI> was grown so
restless and watchful, that he could not Sleep
without Opium; so that all her Complaints,
with her Bracelets, were thrown away in vain.
An Accident unknown to <HI>Florina,</HI> and which
the more augmented her Sorrows; she being
ignorant whether the King had heard her, or
not. But which way to get another Night's
Lodging in the Chamber of Eccho's, she could
not tell, her Bracelets being gone.</P>
<P>A little study put her in mind of her Egg-Experiments;
and to work she went with the
third Egg, and broke it, which produc'd a most
charming Coach of polish'd Steel, inlaid with
curious Figures of Gold. But that which was
most admirable, was its being drawn by six
milk-white Mice, harness'd with Green, having
for their Charioteer and Postilion, two well∣complection'd
young Rats, whose Livery was
rich Rose-colour'd brocado'd Silk.</P>
<P>In the Coach sate Four of the most beautiful
Puppets in the Universe. All the <HI>European</HI>
Fairs could not furnish the like; They would
Dance upon a Spider's Web, and throw them∣selves
thro' the Eye of a Stocking-Needle. 'Tis
a folly to talk of the Agility and Parts of this
Company; they must be well-bred, to besure,
and of good Families.</P>
<P>The Queen was extream glad, the breaking
the third Egg should produce a Rarity so ex∣traordinary;
and was resolv'd to let <HI>Truitone</HI>
be the first that should see it. She therefore
watch'd <HI>Truitone</HI>'s walking in the Park; and
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
when she saw her enter, she set the little Mice
a galloping, with the Chariot and Company
after it.</P>
<P>The ugly <HI>Truitone</HI> no sooner saw it, but be∣liev'd
he Devil was coming for her, 'till she
perceiv'd the Queen given them Directions.</P>
<P>Hah Gammar <HI>Souillon</HI> (said she) you have
gotten a fine little Nice<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y there indeed; will
you take a Crown-Piece for it?</P>
<P>No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I, by my troth Madam (said the Queen)
nothing less than another Night's Lodging in
the Chamb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of Eceho's.</P>
<P>Thou shalt not want that (<HI>said she</HI>) and
turning about, laughing to her Maids, call'd
her a silly Fool,</P>
<P>Having taken up her Lodging that Night in
the Chamber of Eccho's, she made most lamen∣table
Complaints to move the charming King
to Compassion: But the second Night was
unsuccessful like the first; the King having
taken <HI>Opium</HI> that Night also.</P>
<P>Oh, what Torment was poor <HI>Florina</HI> under
at this Disappointment! She had but one Egg
left, and if that did not take effect, she was
sure to be miserable for ever. Break it she was
resolv'd, and so with a mighty force threw it
on the Table, when behold, instead of the Egg
was found a charming Pasty, with half a Do∣zen
Birds in it, singing in a most pleasant and
wonderful manner, notwithstanding they had
been sufficiently baked.</P>
<P>This was no sooner done, but one of the
King's Pages came by, and seeing her, cry'd,
Hah! Gammar <HI>Souillon,</HI> if the King had not
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
<HI>Opium</HI> last Night, you made Noise enough to
keep him awake all the time.</P>
<P><HI>Florina</HI> observing this, was resolv'd to strike
home whilst the Iron was hot—Hark ye,
<HI>said she,</HI> pretty Page, promise me that the King
shall take no <HI>Opium</HI> this Night, and thou shalt
have all these Riches, pulling out a Handful of
Diamonds.—The Page made no more ado,
but gladly took them, and gave her a faithful
Promise it should be so.</P>
<P>He was no sooner gone, but <HI>Truitone</HI> came
by with her Maids; and seeing <HI>Florina</HI> with
such an odd sort of a Pye, cating part of it,
as she suppos'd, was greatly surpriz'd for the
present, as were all her Attendants.</P>
<P>But desirous to know what Mystery she was
upon, she cry'd out, Hah, Gammar! What
are you at now?</P>
<P>I am making a Breakfast of <HI>Physicians, Mu∣sicians,</HI>
and <HI>Lawyers,</HI> said she. At which the
Birds fell a singing more merrily than before;
some in one Tune, and some in another; the
Doctors of Physick s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng their Abilities in cu∣ring
all sorts of Lunacy, but that of Love;
the Astrologers, for a white Half-penny, would
have told a barren Woman how many Chil∣dren
she should have.</P>
<P>In short <HI>Truitone</HI> was so taken with this plea∣sant
Pye, that besides another Night's Lodging
in the Chamber of Eccho's, she gave Gammar
<HI>Souillon</HI> a Broad-Piece of Gold for it.</P>
<P><HI>Florina</HI> long'd for Night, and when it came,
took up her Lodging in the Chamber as usual.
Having drawn from the bottom of her Heart<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
a Sigh so vast, that none but a Soul like hers,
could contain it, she began her Complaint in
the following Words.</P>
<P>Is it possible, that a Princess who had no
other Heart to dispose of, than what I have sa∣crific'd
for you a thousand times, should be
thus flighted at last? Can you be so forget∣ful
as not to remember your own Metamor∣phosis?
our Window-Amours, my Imprison∣ments,
and many Afflictions; your Oaths and
Asseverations? If you can, how comes it that
<HI>Truitone</HI> must Rival one you resolv'd never to
abandon? O infatuated King! O too con∣stant,
but unfortunate <HI>Florina!</HI></P>
<P>Every Word that she said, was distinctly
heard by the King. He knew it to be <HI>Florina</HI>'s
Voice, and his Soul was upon the Rack. He
cry'd out, and complain'd of the dismal Mis∣fortunes
that separated them, and laid as much
to her Charge, as she could do to his.</P>
<P><HI>Florina</HI> sensibly touch'd with a secret Joy
that the King had heard her, cry'd out, Most
<HI>Charming King!</HI> Would you be informed more

for Gammar <HI>Souillon.</HI></P>
<P>The King sent for her according<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and was
told she was in the Cabinet of Eccho's. He
went thither, and there found to his Astonish∣ment,
the beautiful <HI>Florina</HI> lying on a Couch,
with all her usual Charms, and several Lamps
burning before her, which discover'd two of the
most perfect Alters Love ever erected.</P>
<P>The astonish'd King approach'd her, whilst
she lay trembling, tho not afraid. He saw
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
'twas his Princess, and threw himself at her
Feet, and kiss'd her Hands a Thousand Times.
The Princess fix'd her Eyes on him, and at that
very Iustant the Memory of all Misfortunes was
lost. They were Lovers indeed; they recipro∣cally
forgave each other, and buried in Obil∣vion
all their Mistrusts and Jealousies. So that
they wanted nothing now to compleat their
Happiness, but to free themselves of the Fairy
<HI>Soussio.</HI></P>
<P>In the midst of their Consultations, advice
was brought of a certain Enchanter's being ar∣riv'd
at Court. The King admitted him his
Presence, and found him to be his old Friend,
who had brought with him a Fairy from the
farthest parts of the Earth.</P>
<P>After a little Discourse, they told his Maje∣sty,
That they had prevented the threat'ning
Danger of <HI>Soussio;</HI> and that he and <HI>Florina</HI>
might now begin to map the Fruition of an
uninterrupted Love; for nothing could hurt
them.</P>
<P>News was no sooner spread at Court, but
the Hearts of the People were over-joyful; and
every one was pleased with the Princess, whose
Disposition was sweet and affable to the mean∣est
Peasant.</P>
<P><HI>Truitone</HI> by this time had been informed of
<HI>Florina</HI>'s being with the King, and was running
with open Mouth to Reproach him, but the
Enchanter and Fairy coming by at that Instant,
they deservedly turned her into a <HI>Sow,</HI> agreea∣ble
to her Name and Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="63"/>
The filthy Beast thus transformed, was im∣mediately
hun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht out of the Court, to be the
Sport of Chair-men, Link-Boys, and Lackies.</P>
<P>There remains now no more to say but
that the charming King, and beautiful <HI>Florina,</HI>
hasten'd to consummate their Marriage Rites,
and reap the Benefits of reigning not only o∣ver

<HEAD>TALE III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Fair Indifferent; or the Hobgoblin
Prince and Furibon.</HEAD>
<P>ONCE upon a Time, there liv'd a King
and Queen, who never had any Issue
but a Son; a Boy so monstrously de∣form'd
in Shape and Mind, that nothing ap∣pear'd
promising in him.</P>
<P>The indulgent Queen (as too many Mothers
in this Age) lov'd him beyond Expression: So
that she was hood-winkt to his ill Qualities,
and thought every Imperfection in him Agree∣able
and Pleasing. And that he might com∣mand
both Respect and Fear as he grew up,
gave him the Name of <HI>Furibon.</HI></P>
<P>At the same time the King his Father made
choice of a Nobleman, related to the Crown,
to be his Governour, who had a Son nam'd
<HI>Leander,</HI> that was the greatest Ornament of the
Age, for Temper, Beauty, and Wit.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="66"/>
This gentile Nobleman was the Companion
of <HI>Furibon;</HI> a Prince, for the morosness of his
Disposition, as much hated, as <HI>Leander</HI> was
belov'd.</P>
<P><HI>Furibon</HI> perceiving <HI>Leander</HI> had more respect
than himself, began to Envy his Happiness;
and the more, since he was courted by all the
Ladies of Quality, who had given him the Ti∣tle
of <HI>The Fair Indifferent;</HI> a Name which <HI>Le∣ander</HI>
had justly merited, by not fixing his Affe∣ctions
on any particular Lady, tho' extream ob∣liging
to all.</P>
<P>The Malice of <HI>Furibon</HI> increasing, <HI>Leander</HI>'s
Father sent him into the Country, not only to
free him from his Rage, but that he might get
rid of a rattle-brain'd Prince.</P>
<P>One Day, as <HI>Leander</HI> was sitting in an Ar∣bour,
playing upon a Flute, a beautiful Snake
flew directly to him, and twisted herself about
his Leg. <HI>Leander</HI> was going to kill it, but the
pitiful innocent Looks of the Snake, seem'd to
mean him no hurt.</P>
<P>The Gardeners were then pursuing her, and
would fain have persuaded him to kill her, for
some Mischiefs they said she had done.</P>
<P>No, said <HI>Leander,</HI> she has taken Protection
under me, and she shall not be hurt. I will
carry her to my Chamber, and feed her with
what she loves best.—Accordingly he took
her up, and carry'd her to his own Apartment,
where he daily fed her with his own Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Furibon</HI> being told by some of his Flatterers,
That the Ladies of the Court had made Satyrs
upon his Deformity, and Odes in Praise of
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
<HI>Leander</HI>'s Beauty, he ran with Rage to the
Queen his Mother, threatning to kill himself,
if she did not find out a way to destroy <HI>Lean∣der.</HI></P>
<P>The cockering Queen took his part, and ad∣vis'd
him to go a Hunting with some Despera∣do's
where <HI>Leander</HI> us'd, and there to kill him.
<HI>Furibon</HI> the next Day follow'd her Advice, when
<HI>Leander</HI> hearing the Hounds, rode out to see
who it was, but finding to his surprize, Prince
<HI>Furibon</HI> there, he paid him all the Respect due
to his Quality. <HI>Furibon</HI> took no notice of him,
but rode into the Wood with his Ruffians,
when instantly a Lion made at him, and tore
him from his Horse.</P>
<P>The intended Murderers flew, and the Prince
had been that instant kill'd, had not <HI>Leander</HI>
step'd in to his assistance, drew his Sword, and
cut off the Lyon's Head. <HI>Leander</HI> then courte∣ously
offer'd the Prince his Horse, which he in
a surly manner, without any sense of Grati∣tude
mounted; not with a design to return
home, but to ride in quest of those whom he
had hir'd to murder <HI>Leander.</HI></P>
<P>Assoon as he 'spy'd them, he made a Signal,
and rode off, when immediately the Villains
fell upon <HI>Leander</HI> with great Fury, who set his
B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck to a Tree, and maintain'd himself with
such Bravery, that in a little time they all lay
dead before him.</P>
<P><HI>Furibon</HI> staying some time, return'd to the
place, expecting to see <HI>Leander</HI> dead; but find∣ing
the contrary, burn'd inwardly with Passion.
<HI>Leander</HI> seeing the Prince, cry'd, Ah, Sir! if
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
you had commission'd those Rascals to murder
me, I should have made no resistance: But—But
you're a faucy Fellow, reply'd the Prince;
and come no more into my presence on pain
of Death. So rode away.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> went home, and considering he had
an implacable Prince to deal with, to prevent
further Mischief, was resolved to Travel, and
in order thereunto, provided himself with ev∣ery
thing necessary. However, he would not
depart, without taking leave of his beloved
Snake, and ordering it a sufficient Maintenance.
He therefore went to his Chamber to feed it:
but instead of the Snake, he saw one of the
brightest Beauties in the World, among the
fair Sex At first he stood astonish'd; for her
Garb was so richly deck'd with Diamonds, it
dazled his Eyes.</P>
<P>Fear not, <HI>said she,</HI> hopeful Prince, the Snake
you nourish'd, was none but my self. I am a
Fairy, by Name <HI>Gentilla.</HI> I live a Thousand
Years, devoted to all the Merriments in the
World, free from any Danger: When that
Term is ended, I am oblig'd to be eight Years

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gain. If I am kill'd within my eight Years

<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
Fair Sex. Now chuse you which you like best,
be either a Spirit of the Air, Earth, or Water,
or all of them, and it shall be so.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> admiring her Gratitude, thank'd her,
and said, That as he was bent upon Travelling
he desir'd he might be a Spirit at large.</P>
<P>With that, the Fairy stroking him thrice o∣ver
the Face, said, <HI>Then be it so,</HI> Leander, <HI>and
may you prosper in all your Undertakings.</HI> At the
same time giving him a feather'd Cap to render
him invisible, as often as he pleas'd to wear it.</P>
<P>The little red Cap, <HI>Leander</HI> first made tryal
of: He put it on, and pull'd it over his Ears,
and then wish'd himself gathering wild Roses
in a distant Forrest. It was no sooner said;
but he was carried thither safely thro' the Air
in a Minute. He delay'd not to gather three
Roses, and so wish'd himself back again.</P>
<P>Then he carry'd the Roses to the Fairy <HI>Gen∣tilla,</HI>
who strictly charg'd him to keep them
safe; assuring him: That One should supply
him with what Wealth he wanted; the Se∣cond,
if apply'd to his Mistress'd Neck, would
inform him, whether she was Vertuous, or not:
And the Third should preserve him from Sick∣ness
and Death.—And having thus in∣form'd
him, she said no more, but wish'd him
Success, and instantly vanish'd.</P>
<P>Now, thought <HI>Leander</HI> to himself, I am hap∣py;
to Court I will go, and there exercise my
innocent Mirth upon the ungrateful <HI>Furibon.</HI></P>
<P>He did accordingly; but upon his arrival,
he was very much surpriz'd to hear that <HI>Furibon</HI>
was then with his Father, complaining that
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
<HI>Leander</HI> had contriv'd to murder him as went
a Hunting.</P>
<P>Whilst he stood hearing these Falsities, one
of the King's Messengers came and carried him
before his Majesty, and the lying Prince. Re∣venge
thy self on him, said the King to his Son
<HI>Furibon</HI> But being afraid to look him in the
Face, he turn'd Tail, and ran to his Mother for
help.</P>
<P>The Queen soon posted to the King, to con∣ser
with him about <HI>Leander;</HI> and the coward∣ly
Monkey, her Son, minding to hear what she
said, had laid his Ear to the Key-hole of the
Door. <HI>Leander</HI> no sooner perceiv'd this, but
he put on his invisible Red Cap, and taking a
Hammer and Nails that lay by him, tack'd his
Ear fast to the Door.</P>
<P>The Boy <HI>Furibon</HI> feeling the Smart, fell a
roaring and bellowing like a Hog; and his out∣cries
reaching the Queen'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ears, she flew from
the King, and bursting open the Door, tore her
Son's Ear from his Head.</P>
<P>The Queen was out of her Wits at the Sight,
the Blood ran down from his Head, as if it fell
from a stuck Pig; and nothing but howling
was heard.</P>
<P>Well, at last with much ado▪ the Sow took up
her Pig's Ear; for <HI>Leander</HI> (who was now a
<HI>Goblin</HI>) had flaug'd her Hands, and the Boy's
Nose all the time: So that there was such an
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outcry of Murder! Murder! the whole Court
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung with it, The Servants came, and the King
also, but seeing no body touch them, he thought
they were both mad, or the Devil was in 'em.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="71"/>
<HI>Leaender</HI> in the mean time was got into the
Queen's Fruit-Garden, in his own Shape, pul∣ling
down the choicest Fruits and Flowers, and
throwing them about the Walks; and for any
but the Royal Blood to do this, was imme∣diate
Death.</P>
<P>The Gardener perceiving it, went presently
and told the Queen of it, who sent her Son with
a Band of Soldiers, to bring him by force be∣fore
her. <HI>Leander</HI> no sooner saw this, but o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
went his invisible Cap, just as <HI>Furibon</HI> was co∣ming
to him, and taking up a round Pebble
hurl'd it at the Monkey-Prince, and broke hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Arm. Then he hamper'd his Legs so fast, that
he fell down among the Gravel, and mangled
all his Face. As for the Soldiers, he flung al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Queen's ripe Oranges at them; sometime<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
showing himself, and sometimes not: So that
they were glad to get away as well as they
could.</P>
<P>When he had sufficiently pleas'd himself with
this Diversion, he was resolv'd to leave the
Court, unknown to any of his Servants; and
mounting next Morning his trusty Steed <HI>Gris-de-lin,</HI>
he rode 'till he came to a very spacious
Wood.</P>
<P>As he past thro' this Thicket, he heard the
most dolorous Complaints expressible; and ca∣sting
his Eyes ronud, he saw a young Gentle∣man
undergoing all the Afflictions of a despe∣rate
Mind.</P>
<P>Mov'd with this Sight, <HI>Leander</HI> beg'd the
Reason of his Grief, and proffer'd him his As∣sistance.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="72"/>
Ah, Sir! <HI>said the Unknown,</HI> this very Morning
is to be torn from my Embraces, one that loves
me above all the World; and she is now pre∣paring
to be sacrific'd by her Parents to Avarice
and Age, in a Castle at the end of this Wood.</P>
<P>Say you so, Sir, said the generous <HI>Leander;</HI>
stay till I come back, and be confident I'll
relieve you.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> put Spurs to his Horse, and made
directly to the Castle, where he found all things
i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a readiness for Marriage, the Musick play∣ing,
Trumpets sounding, and a general Mirth
throughout the whole place. <HI>Gris-de-lin</HI> being
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty'd to a Tree, on went the little invisible
r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Cap, and <HI>Leander</HI> was immediately a <HI>Gob∣lin</HI></P>
<P>When all the Company we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e seated at Ta∣ble,
the <HI>Goblin</HI> hid himself among them. His
Eye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were perpetually on the Bride, and ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erv'd
her Heart to be far remote from that
place. He now thought it high time to disturb
their Mirth▪ and therefore flew immediately to
her Mother's Seat, and whisper'd thus in her
Ear.</P>
<P>If thy Daughter is married to that old Wretch,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n less than a Week thou shalt die!</P>
<P>The good old Woman fell into a Fit upon
it; but coming to herself, she declar'd, That
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f they proceeded any farther in marrying her
Daughter, she should not survive it a Week
longer.</P>
<P>This must needs be a great Surprize to the
Husband; however looking upon it to be but a
Whimsey of the Brain, he call'd his Wife Sim∣pleton,
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
and said, that some old, cobling Astro∣loger,
had infus'd such Notions into her Head,
and made a mere Ridicule of what she said.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> upon this, flyes to the old Dotard's
Ear, and said:</P>
<P>If you will not believe your Wife, and break off
the Match, you shall dye before her!</P>
<P>The old Man hearing this, and knowing him∣self
unprepar'd to leave the World, without any
more ado, dismiss'd the aged Miser to make
the best of his Fortune, who took his Leave
without Ceremony, but left a great many
Curses behind him.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Leander</HI> enjoin'd the Parents to marry
their Daughter to her first Lover in the Wood.
Accordingly he was sent for, and married they
were; when <HI>Leander</HI> took his leave of them,
and went in search of fresh Adventures.</P>
<P>Having travelled till he came to a spacious
large City, he became acquainted with a cer∣tain
Lady named <HI>Blondina;</HI> but observing
something of Levity in her Conversation, made
tryal of his Rosey Experiment, and watching
an Opportunity when she was asleep, laid it
gently upon her Neck, when it soon wither'd
and lost it's Beauty.</P>
<P>By this he discovered, that <HI>Blondina</HI> carried
two Faces, and was in Love with another;
and to know the whole matter, wish'd himself
one time in <HI>Blondina's</HI> Bed-Chamber, where he
found an aukward, Country Cat-Gut Scraper,
making his Addresses to her.</P>
<P>In my Fairy's Name, said <HI>Leander,</HI> I'll not
suffer this: So he took him by the Throat, and
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
flung him cut of the Window, by which Fall
the caterwauling Fidler had his Teeth beat out,
and his Fiddle broke to pieces.</P>
<P>The next Exploit <HI>Leander</HI> perform'd, was
this:</P>
<P>After he had sufficiently reproach'd the in∣constant
<HI>Blondina,</HI> he went to another City,
where he saw a Virgin going with all the usual
Ceremonies to a Nunnery, but with the utmost
unwilllingness a dejected Face could express.</P>
<P>He no sooner saw her led by her two Bro∣thers,
wich her Mother following after, but he
cry'd out with a loud Voice, Desist you barba∣rous
Brethren, or else 'tis Heaven's Will you
shall be squeez'd to Atoms.</P>
<P>The Voice was like Thunder, and the Peo∣ple
were astonish'd at it; but the Brothers per∣sisted,
and said, it was nothing but the Noise
of her Sweet-heart, who had hid himself for
that purpose.</P>
<P>A Quarter-Staff lying by, <HI>Leander</HI> took it
up, and belabour'd them both so heartily, that
they and all the Company were forc'd to retire
with precipitation, and leave the Virgin with
the Goblin, and her Lover that was among the
Crowd in disguise.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> perceiving this, resum'd his Shape,
and modestly requested the Virgin to accept of
his Service.</P>
<P>The Transports of Joy she was in, to see her
self free, oblig'd her to tell him in short, That
having given her Heart, and promis'd to marry
that Chevalier (pointing to him) who had no
considerable Fortune; 'twas for that reason
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>
her Relations were then carrying her by vio∣lence
into a Nunnery.</P>
<P>Say you so, beautiful Virgin, cry'd the ge∣nerous
<HI>Leander,</HI> their Fortunes have forsook
them, and 'tis no more in their power to sepa∣rate
your Affections. You shall never want
Wealth to compleat your Happiness.—With
that he shook his Rose between them, till
there was Gold sufficient to maintain Ten o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the richest Peers in the Land. Take that, faith∣ful
Couple (<HI>said he</HI>) marry, and be happy for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ever.—And so he left them, wishing him∣self
in another place.</P>
<P>In his Way thro' a large Forrest, he heard a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Virgin cry out so piteously, that the Air ec∣cho'd
with her Complaints. Looking wistfully
round him, he saw four Ruffians haling an in∣nocent
Virgin into the Wood. <HI>Leander</HI> was
as quick as Thought till he came up with them.
Hey day, (<HI>reply'd he</HI>) What hurt have these in∣nocent
Years done, that she must be treated
thus? I command you to let her alone.</P>
<P>Yes, by all means, forsooth (said they) Mr.
Hubble-Bubble.</P>
<P>Well then, cry'd the Prince, I'll make you;
So he jumpt off his Horse, and put on his invi∣sible
Cap. The Rogues thought he was quite
gone, and had left his Horse to their Mercy;
but they were wofully mistaken, for the Gob∣lin
soon seiz'd him that held her, and ty'd him
to a Tree, whilst the rest were in vain pursui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of his Steed <HI>Grisdelin.</HI></P>
<P>The nimble-footed Beast having tir'd and al∣most
blinded his pursuers, by kicking Sand and
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
Gravel in their Eyes; one of them gave over the
Chase, and return'd back; who no sooner saw
his Companion in this Condition, but he fell
into a Passion, and call'd him Fool, Blockhead,
Puppy, Coward, and what not? Supposing
he had suffer'd the Virgin to bind him in that
manner; there being no Body, as he thought,
to assist her; giving him withal, several severe
Thuacks over the Shoulders, for his supposed
Cowardice.</P>
<P>The Goblin having sufficiently laugh'd at this
Adventure, seiz'd the other, and bound him to
another Tree, directly before his Companion's
Face.</P>
<P>Heav'ns! What better Sport, than to see
this Fellow rail'd at by his Comrade? He spit
at him, he hal'd to him, and cry'd out, You va∣liant
Fellow, you Rascal, you Puppy-Dog, why
don't you come, and correct my Cowardice
now? But alas! his opposite was out of Coun∣tenance;
and having nothing to say, hung his
Head like a Bull-rush.</P>
<P><HI>Abricotina</HI> (for so was the Virgin's Name)
having made her escape, <HI>Leander</HI> was resolv'd
to find her cut, and learn the History of her
Misfortunes. His Steed returning, he soon re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounted,
at that instant the other two Ruffins
came in, which <HI>Grisdelin</HI> no sooner perceiv'd,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut he flung up his two hindermost Heels, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickt their Guts out, leaving the other two
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogues to dye with hungry Bellies.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> having not rid far from the place,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut he overtook <HI>Abricotina,</HI> who being weary
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd faint, was refreshing herself under a Tree.
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
At first sight of the Steed, she thought herself
happy; for she had a strong Fancy that <HI>Gris∣delin</HI>
was coming to carry he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Palace of
Love and Pleasure, though she saw no body on
his back.</P>
<P>The <HI>Goblin</HI> knew well her Mind, and riding
up to her, took her in his Arms, and set her be∣fore
him. Then putting Spurs to his little Nag,
and pulling off his red Cap he became visible.
<HI>Abricotina</HI> supposing him a <HI>Spirit,</HI> would have
started from him, had not he held her fast.</P>
<P>Ah, Madam, (<HI>said he</HI>) do you fear your De∣liverer?</P>
<P>No, Sir. (<HI>cry'd she;</HI>) but I tremble at the
thoughts of a Spirit.</P>
<P>I am none, you may feel, (reply'd he) there∣fore
abandon all such Thoughts. I am ready
to carry you in Safety where-ever you please:
Let me intreat you therefore, in the mean time
to let me understand the rise of your Misfor∣tunes.</P>
<P>To pass away the time, <HI>said she,</HI> I cannot in
Gratitude deny the Request of one I owe so
much to.</P>
<P>Know then, Sir, <HI>continu'd she,</HI> that many
Years since, one of the most eminent of the Fai∣ries
was so weak, as to marry a Prince contrary
to all Laws, Remonstrances, and Persuasions
of the Order of Fairyism; for which she was
expel'd their Society.</P>
<P>It fell out, that the Prince her Husband, in
some time, grew sick of her Conversation, there
not being an Action of his, any where, but
she presently knew it; and which she made use
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
of, to render his Life uneasy where-ever he
went.</P>
<P>'Tir'd with this way of living, he private∣ly
retir'd to a loansome Cell, some thousand
Miles distant from home, and where, as he
thought, it was impossible for her to find him,
But alas! the Project was weak; for she was a
universal Fairy, who held intelligence in all
parts of the Earth.</P>
<P>The Prince had not left her three Days, but
she found herself with Child by him: In this
condition she doubled her Revenge, and calling
to an invisible Eagle, she flew with it directly
to her Husband's Den.</P>
<P>The Fairy no sooner saw him, but she flung
herself at his Feet, and said;</P>
<P>Sweet Prince, behold thy <HI>Fairy</HI> Princess, whose
pregnant Womb is now with Child of thy own Image▪
be persuaded to go back with me, and you shall have
whatever you desire.</P>
<P>Thus she lay intreating him with all the al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring
Expressions she could invent: But
finding him deaf to her Persuasions, and obsti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately
bent never to live with her more, she
assum'd all the Rage of a disappointed Woman
making good this Proverb;</P>
<Q><L>Nothing vexeth a Woman most.</L>
<L>But when her Expectation's lost.—</L></Q>
<P>She rail'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oam'd, swore, and spoke Non <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

'till the Cholick seiz'd her, and put her in mind

<P>Well (<HI>said she, rallying once more</HI>) If I had
a mind to revenge my self on thee, thou cruel One,
I could immediately transform thee into a Viper,

Punishment be to dwell among Scriech-Owls, and
other nocturnal Birds. <HI>And having said thus,
she took to her Eagle, and in a Minute slew
back to the Palace.</HI></P>
<P>She was no sooner arriv'd; but she dismiss'd
all her M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n-Servants, and took in their stead,
a certyin Race of Women, call'd <HI>Amazone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
To these she gave strict Orders to repair to se∣veral

<P>Sometime afterwards, she was deliver'd of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

and my Mistress the Queen of it: H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

retir'd to her own Palace in the Center of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Land.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="82"/>
But, to come down <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Cause of my late
Misfortune; you must know (<HI>added she</HI>) That
I had the keeping of all my Mistress's Birds;
and one Day, I was so unfortunate as to let fly
a Parrot as dear to her, as herself. The Bird
was no sooner flown, but apprehensive of some
severe Punishment, I retir'd out of the Island
in search of it.</P>
<P>Then it was that those Villains siezed me;
they hovering about the Island, with Hopes to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
steal away my Mistress, and carry her to an
ugly deformed Prince, call'd <HI>Furibon,</HI> who had
seen her Picture, and sent them hither for that
purpose.—</P>
<P>And is impossible for me (<HI>said</HI> Leander, <HI>inter∣rupting
her</HI>) to gain admission? Is there no Way,
fair <HI>Abricotina?</HI></P>
<P>In my Opinion (<HI>said she</HI>) there is no possi∣bility.
Were it in my Power, I would effect
it; but I'm no more able to do it, than to make
a World.</P>
<P>I can enable you (<HI>cry'd</HI> Leander) suffer me then,
to enter with you in the Habit of an <HI>Amazon,</HI>
which I can have at my Wis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>Forbid it Heav'ns! (<HI>cry'd she</HI>) such an En∣terprzie
would terminate in the Ruin of us both.
Better wou'd it be to forget the Thoughts of
this Island, than to entertain what will only
prove anxious and unfortunate.</P>
<P>Whilst they were thus discoursing together,
they came to the Brink of a River, when <HI>Abri∣cotina</HI>
springing from his Arms, threw herself
on t'othor side, and cry'd, Be haypy, generou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Prince, where ever you go; and the whole
<PB N="72" REF="83"/>
World wait upon you with infinite delight and
Pleasure.</P>
<P>And may you, sweet Virgin (<HI>said Leander</HI>) when
occasion serves, bear a remembrance of me in your
Heart.</P>
<P>They were not parted long, but <HI>Leander</HI> was
resolv'd to wish himself in the Island with her.
Accordingly he put on his little Red Cap, and
in an Instant he was in the Palace of <HI>Calm De∣lights.</HI>
He fonud the Palace was of pure Gold,
standing upon Chrystal, in the middle whereof
the <HI>Graces</HI> kept Guard with admirable Order.
All the Wonders of the Four Elements, embe∣lish'd
it. Not a Man or Boy was to be seen;
the very Idea of that Sex being lost among 'em.
But there were infinite Numbers of the most
beautiful Women that Nature could mould, all
gay and lively, as the Sun at its Creation. All
the Walls of the Appa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tments were built with
Diamonds and precious Stones. The Princess's
Bed-Chamber, was all of Chrystal-Glass, and
ev'ry where expos'd to Sight, the Perfection of
the whole World. Her Throne stood in the
concave of a large Pearl, about the bigness of
a <HI>Muskmellon,</HI> upon which she sate in State,
with her Maids about her.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> being invisible, saw all this; and as
he stood admiring the Princess, Proclamation
was made, according to custom, that her High∣ness
was going to speak, when immediately the
<HI>Graces</HI> came, and seated themselves upon her
Lips.</P>
<P>Looking round her with an Air of serenity,
she ask'd what was become of the Nymph
<PB N="73" REF="84"/>
<HI>Abricotina,</HI> that she did not give her usual At∣tendance?</P>
<P>Answer was made, That she had been sought
carefully, but could not be found.</P>
<P>There being several <HI>Parrots</HI> in the Presence-Chamber
at that time, <HI>Leander</HI> presently mi∣mick'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, and cry'd, Dear Princess, she will
presently be here, having narrowly esc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p'd be∣ing
carry'd away by some wicke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Creatures,
c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll'd <HI>Men,</HI> but was wonderfully preserv'd
by a young Prince, that came timely to her
Relief.</P>
<P>Just as he had said this, in the Nymph came
and throwing herself at the Princess's Feet, up
and told her all that had befel her; and that
a certain young Prince, with all the Charms
that Nature could bestow on a Man, had res∣cu'd
her from Four Villains, who were carrying
her off. A Prince (<HI>added she</HI>) who I could
have brought hither and lov'd, had I not been
enjoin'd to the contrary.</P>
<P>The Princess being inwardly pleas'd at this
Relation, ask'd his Name, and place of Birth:
But the Nymph being ignorant, could not in∣form
her of either: At which <HI>Leander</HI> began to
talk like a <HI>Parrot</HI> again, saying; My charming
Princess, <HI>Abricotina</HI> is unkind, in not telling
your Highness; the strange Prince will break
his Heart, if he is not permitted to see my love∣ly
Mistriss.—</P>
<P>Let it be so: <HI>said the Princess:</HI> And since
you are so forward Mr. <HI>Parrot,</HI> I charge you ne∣ver
to speak one Word more of him.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="85"/>
With these Words she arose from her Throne,
and with a beauteous Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in of Nymphs, went
into the great Hall too Supper. At her coming
in, the Birds set up their little Throats, and
sung melodiously.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Leander</HI> having learn'd to imitate the
Birds in the Woods, could sing better than the
best of them, and willing to entertain the Prin∣cess
with something extraordinary, he sung in
a <HI>Canary</HI>-Bird's Note, the following Song.</P>
<Q><L>All our contended, bliss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul Days,</L>
<L>In Melancholly end,</L>
<L>If <HI>Love</HI> should not find Means and Ways,</L>
<L>To stand at last our Friend.</L>
<L>Oh, beauteous Princess, then Embrace,</L>
<L>And nourish in your Arms,</L>
<L>Almighty <HI>Love,</HI> and you'll be blest</L>
<L>With all it's fruitful Charms.</L></Q>
<P>To hear a <HI>Canary</HI>-Bird sing so much, and so
like a rational Creature, must needs be very
surprizing and diverting. The Princess ask'd
<HI>Abricotina,</HI> whether she had instructed that Bird
or not. The Nymph answer'd her Mistriss in
the Negative; but told her. She saw no reason
but one Bird might have as much Wit as
another.</P>
<P>The Princess, however, fancied she had gi∣ven
it some particular Instructions, and smiling
to herself, took her place at the upper-end of
the Table.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86"/>
Supper being brought in, <HI>Leander</HI> who had
eat nothing since his arrival, invisibly made use
of a <HI>Cat</HI>'s Paw that was a Favourite of the Prin∣cess's
to plu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k the Wing of a Hum-Bird out of
the Dish, which he eat as heartily as if he had
been at Plough.</P>
<P>When Supper was ended, the Princess was ob∣serv'd
to be something uneasy. She rose from
the Table, and taking <HI>Abrocotina</HI> with her, re∣tir'd
to her Closet.</P>
<P>Having lock'd her self in, Tell me, my dear
<HI>Abrocotina,</HI> the Truth (said the Princess) Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
you g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve a Description of the Prince that sav'd
you, did you uot flatter me, and say more of
his M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rits than he deserv'd?</P>
<P>By the sacred Order of <HI>Calm Delights,</HI> Ma∣dam,
(<HI>reply'd she</HI>) if I had known so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of
your Mind before, I should have done him
more Justice, in giving your Highness an ample
Character of him, as the most admirable Person
in the World. A Prince, who was born to sa∣crifice
at Love's Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar; whose Assiduities are
endless; and one who is the Fountain of Ho∣nour
and Virtue.</P>
<P>Is it possible? (<HI>said the Princess sighing</HI>) Hap∣py,
happy Girl, that didst not bring him hith∣er,
to make me more miserable!</P>
<P>To give you perfect Bliss. (<HI>said</HI> Abricotina)
and add to that supposed Happiness of Yours,
such solid Joys, which only can support the
Order of Nature.</P>
<P>Hold your Nonsense, (said the Princess)
Did not my Mother leave me, above Five Hun∣dred
Years since, large Volumes of the misera∣ble
<PB N="76" REF="87"/>
Destructions of whole Kingdoms and Na∣tions,
by the Freedom our Sex have taken with
the Men? The Precepts she has oblig'd me to
follow, must I not observe? I charge you,
therefore, say no more. But, Oh!—<HI>said she,
pausing,</HI> let us.—Let us, if possible, live, as
we have hitherto done; indifferent to all the
World.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Abricotina</HI> observ'd a violent Palpitati∣on,
which often rais'd her Breasts, and sent out
a Sigh or two. She stood silent awhile; but
at last, being touch'd with the same Fire, she
broke silence; and with a little unusual Cou∣rage,
(as Confidents will do) Why then, <HI>said
she,</HI> did you send your Picture into the World?
Was it only to persecute Mankind twice?
What must they imagine, who are no doubt,
Rational as our selves? Pardon me, Madam.
Reason must certainly tell 'em, you are a cru∣el
Beauty, that cannot be happy, without di∣sturbing
the rest of the World.</P>
<P>Ah! <HI>said the Princess,</HI> I must now own 'twas
a Fault; and though I'm a Sovereign Mistress,
yet by this, it seems, I have not lost the Weak∣ness
incident to my Sex. However, I could
wish that Picture of mine, were in the Posses∣sion
of none but the Prince we talk of.</P>
<P>To me it seems Injustice, to have more Re∣spect
for the rest of Mankind than him▪ (<HI>reply'd
Abricotina</HI>) otherwise you must have some in∣nate
Affection to see him.</P>
<P>It may be I have that Vanity, <HI>said the Prin∣cess.</HI>
—At which they broke off Discourse, it
being late, and betook themselves to Rest.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="88"/>
Alas! they little thought who they had talk'd
to, all that time. <HI>Leander</HI> was invisibly there,
and heard between Hope and Despair, all they
said. He thought it improper to take up his
Residence in the Bed-Chamber, and therefore
contented himself with a little Cabinet adjoin∣ing;
from which he could hear even the least
Sigh distinctly.</P>
<P>He had not been there long, but the Princess
began thus.</P>
<P>My beloved <HI>Abricotina,</HI> you have given me
some Account of what you met with in your
absence; 'pr'ythee try to inform me of some∣thing
more extraordinary; and, if possible,
<HI>drive out one God by the Power of another.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis impossible, Madam, <HI>said she,</HI> they have
all agreed to make the unknown Prince their
Favourite.—</P>
<P>Pish: <HI>said the Princess.</HI> Did I not forbid you
to mention him?</P>
<P>Madam, (<HI>cry'd</HI> Abricotina (I met with se∣veral
little, tawney Creatures by the way, which
exactly resembled young Children; but certain∣ly,
never was any Creature so nimble and dex∣t'rous.
They skip'd and danc'd from one Tree
to another with admirable swiftness, and play'd
a thousand pretty Pranks.</P>
<P>Such a Creature I fancy, might divert me,
(said the Princess) were it possible to be pur∣chas'd.</P>
<P>The assiduous <HI>Leander</HI> no sooner heard this
but presently wish'd himself in the Forrest,
and brought from thence Twelve fine Apes▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
a Velvet Bag: Then he wish'd himself at <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="89"/>
where he bought a little Gold Chariot, and
two <HI>French</HI> Monkeys, (for you must know
there are abundance of that passive breed in
<HI>France</HI>) the one nam'd <HI>Briscamhril,</HI> the other
<HI>Piercew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od.</HI></P>
<P>Into the Bag they all went, which, with <HI>Le∣ander,</HI>
were convey'd to the Princess's Gallery,
facing her Anti-Chamber, whilst he remain'd
invisible at her Door.</P>
<P>The Nymphs of Honour no sooner perceiv'd
this Curiosity, but they ran to the Chamber and
opening the Door, told her Virgin Highness,
that his Apish Majesty, was come to give her
some Diversion: At the same time, in went
the Chariot, with a great Concour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Apes of
Quality, performing such merry Exploits, that
the Princess could hardly refrain Laughing;
and the more, when she saw the Chariot with∣out
a Driver; little thinking that the <HI>Goblin</HI>
manag'd the whole Affair.</P>
<P>The Chariot being drawn close to the Prin∣cess's
Feet, <HI>Briscambril</HI> s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ept out, and bowing
with a gentile Air, presented her with a Dia∣mond
Box, wherein was a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ode in p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aise of
her Perfections, complaining of the wretched
Fortune of a Prince, who was led Captive by
her Charms, aud had become a willing Slave
to her Beauty.</P>
<P>The Princess having read it, gave a Smile
worth ten thousand Worlds to <HI>Leander</HI> And
to add to her Diversion, <HI>Briscambril</HI> and <HI>Pierce∣wood</HI>
entertain'd her with several fine Dan∣ces.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="90"/>
Notwithstanding all his Mirth, the Princess
could not imagine with herself from whence
the Ode came. And that she might conj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cture
with more freedom, she dismiss'd the <HI>French</HI>
Monkeys with abundance of Thanks, and took
to her Closet.</P>
<P>The next Morning early, <HI>Leander</HI> having
provided himself with Materials, he sate down
before a Looking-Glass, and dr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w his own Pi∣cture
to the Life, in an oval Frame; and then
in another Frame, by the strength of imagina∣tion,
drew that of the Princess to Perfection.
He drew himself kneeling holding the Prin∣cess
in one Hand, and in 'tother the follow∣ing
Motto.</P>
<Q>Within my Heart, thou better art,</Q>
<P>The Princess was no sooner up, but the Pi∣cture
presented itself to her view. She call'd <HI>A∣bricorina,</HI>
and presently charg'd her with it. The
Nymph pleaded Ignorance, and declar'd, Tho'

the unknown Prince her Deliverer, yet she
knew no more of its coming there, than the
Man in the Moon. Certainly, <HI>added she,</HI> it
must be the Effects of some amorous Wizard;
and therefore if you would take my Advice,
the best way is to burn it immediately.</P>
<P>A Thousand Pitics (said the Princess) it's
such a lovely Picture; I had rather it should
remain in my Chamber; (looking with a lan∣guishing
Eye upon it.</P>

But <HI>Abricotina</HI> running to fetch some Fire,
<HI>Leander</HI> to prevent the Danger, whilst the Prin∣cess
look'd another way, convey'd it out of
sight, to the great surprize of them both when
the Nymph retu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n'd.</P>
<P>The Princess talking next Day about the
nicety of Dress and Behaviour, told her that she
would not value what she gave, to know what
different Fashions were in the World, that she
might make choice of one among them.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> having heard this, in a Day's time
fetcht from all parts of the World, the richest
and most curious Silks; the nicest Patterns of
all sorts of Fashions, and lock'd them in a
Room, of which he kept the Key. He had also
gotten a great Number of Babies, and dress'd
them variously, according to the custom of di∣vers
Nations, and set them over Night in or∣der
in her Highness's Closet.</P>
<P>Bless me! when the Princess saw them next
Morning, she stood surpriz'd at the Rairity;
and viewing them over with Curiosity, obser∣ved
one with a little Box in her Hand, more
finer than the rest. She took the Box, and
looking into it, found two Pictures in it
epitom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z'd, which she knew to be her own,

<P>Certainly, <HI>said she, to</HI> Abricotina, some Ma∣gician

<P>The Princess, tho' pleas'd with the Prospect,
and ravish'd with i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmony, was so vio∣lently

her with a thousand balmy Kisses, till
she open'd her Eyes.</P>
<P>The Princess would fain have seen her Com∣forter;
she lookt about her, but to no purpose.
She felt indeed, some-Body take her very ten∣derly
by her Hands, and kiss and weep over
them▪ with a thousand ind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring Offices At

have thee to be?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> not thinking this juncture proper to

corner of the Garden. The Princess finding
herself alone, call'd out to <HI>Abricotina,</HI> and dis∣cover'd
what she had seen and heard, and
how the generous <HI>Goblin</HI> had reliev'd her from
the Swoon she had fallen into.</P>
<P>And will you not Love him then? <HI>cry'd</HI> Abri∣cotina.</P>
<P>What, a <HI>Goblin!</HI> said the Princess. Who

<P>So <HI>Psyche</HI> thought <HI>Cupid</HI> a Snake, (<HI>said the

<P>Yes, (<HI>said the Princess</HI>) provided <HI>Cupid</HI> and

But, ah! (<HI>said she</HI>) 'tis Vanity to think on't
My Mother's Severities would soon find me out

render me for ever miserable.</P>
<P>Thus they discours'd together, when they
were interrupted by an unwelcome Messenger
who brought advice. That monstrous Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Furibon,</HI> with an Army of Four Hundred
Thousand Men, was coming to invade he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Territories.</P>
<P>The Princess and all her Court, were in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

was best in this Extremity, she could not tell
She dispatch'd <HI>Abricatina</HI> to her Mother, to im∣plore

For she return'd back with an Answe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
disagreeable.</P>
<P><HI>The Fairy bid her tell her Daughter▪</HI> Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
she had wholly forfeited her motherly Protection
<PB N="85" REF="96"/>
by neglecting her Precepts; That she was suffici∣ently
inform'd of the Intriegues of <HI>Leander,</HI> whose
Residence at her Court, had insnar'd and captivated
her Heart; That she might take the fatal Conse∣quences
of it to herself; and, That she would aban∣don
her for ever.</P>
<P>Such a sorrowful Answer as this, from a
Mother, who was ten times more powerful than
<HI>Furibon,</HI> must needs be very afflicting. <HI>Lean∣der</HI>
knew it, and heard the Sighs, and saw the
Tears of his Princess: He was resolv'd to do
something Heroick in her Favour▪ and save a
Heart so precious, which otherwise would ine∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itably
break.</P>
<P>With this Resolution, unknown to the Prin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess,
he put himself in an <HI>Amazon</HI>'s Dress; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nowing <HI>Furibon</HI> to be of a greedy, covetous
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isposition, went directly to his Camp, with
Project to correct him.</P>
<P><HI>He told him,</HI> That her <HI>Amazon</HI> Highness

<P><HI>Furibon</HI> list'ning to so powerful a Propositi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
made Answer. That as she was a Woman,

of Guineas.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, <HI>said</HI> Leander, to count such an immense
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, would take up too much time; tell me, there∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,

<P><PB N="86" REF="97"/>
Will she so, thought <HI>Furibon,</HI> then I will
have all she has, or none. However, he told
<HI>Leander,</HI> that if she would forthwith furnish
him with as much as would fill Thirty large
Rooms full, upon the Word of a King he would
be satisfied, and never trouble her more.</P>
<P>It shall be done, <HI>said</HI> Leander <HI>in disguise,</HI> who
was thereupon carried to the Rooms to be fill'd.
Now (<HI>said he</HI>) King <HI>Furibon,</HI> you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave your

<P>In the midst of these dejections she look<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>In the midst of this Amusement, a Voice

<P>Ah! Madam, the Person that speaks to you, is
the Prince that sav'd me from Destraction.</P>
<P>I could be glad of that, (said the Princess)
if the Goblin and Prince were one and the

And sowish'd himself in <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribon</HI>'s Army.</P>
<P>He no sooner arriv'd there, but he publickly
appear'd in the same Dress he was in at <HI>Furi∣bon</HI>'s

<P>It was late at Night before he came <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here,
when the Princess was in Bed, but restless, and

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, fell so deeply in Love with her, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sent an Embassador, with a magnificent
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rain, to ask her in Marriage; not doubting
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the beautiful Prince would embrace his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffer: But when the Embassador arriv'd, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Audience, he receiv'd no other Answer,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thanks from the princess for the Honour
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Maste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was pleas'd to do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r; and that, at
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esent, she had no Inclinati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to Marriage.</P>
<P>The Embassador return'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with all the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esents brought the Princess, consisting of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Quantities of Diamonds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which she had
<PB N="94" REF="105"/>
modestly refus'd; but to discover something of
her usual good Nature, she made Choice only
of a Thousand of Pins.</P>
<P>At his return to Court, every one was in
perplexity, particularly the King, whose Affe∣ction
for her was so great, that it often drew
Tears from his Eyes.</P>
<P>A young Nobleman then in the Palace▪
nam'd <HI>Avenant,</HI> a Favourite at Court, of an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
admirable Wit, Shape, and Mein, talking with
some of the Courtiers about this Disapoint∣ment,
made slight of it, and accidentally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
drop these Words. <HI>If his Majesty had sent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to the Princess▪ I would have brought her to Court
if it had cost me my Life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Favourites never want Enemies to wre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
what they say. Away run one that hear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him, to the King, and with open Mouth</HI>
May it please your Majesty, (<HI>said they</HI>) You<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Avenant</HI> has ridicul'd your Majesty, prefer'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
own Beauty and Parts, before Yours, and affirm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
That if he had been sent to the <HI>Beauty</HI> with <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣den-Locks</HI>
she would have follow'd him where-ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
pleas'd.</P>
<P>They needed not to say any more, the Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Passion grew so boundless, that he order'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
immediately to be shvt up in a Castle, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there starv'd to Death.</P>
<P>The unfortunate <HI>Avenant</HI> pining in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Condition, and expecting no relief, one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
gave a great Sigh, and cry'd: In what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
I offended the King? Would to Heaven <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
his Subjects were so frithful to him, as I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
been!</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="106"/>
At that instant the King went by, and hear∣ing
these Words, stood still, and listen'd to
hear farther; but <HI>Avenant</HI>'s Enemies would
have persuaded him from it. The King was
resolute, and listen'd so long 'till he wept.</P>
<P>Then his Majesty sent for him out, and de∣manded
of him why he spoke those Words,
and valu'd himself above the King his Ma∣ster.</P>
<P>Sir, (<HI>said</HI> Avenant) my Accusations are false,
on the contrary I would have possess'd her Princely
Mind, with so many bright Accomplishments pecu∣liar
to your Royal Self, that would have persuaded
her to come along with me, and be happy in your
Affections.</P>
<P>The King no sooner heard him, but said, I
am satisfy'd, faithful <HI>Avenant;</HI> and so took
him into Favour again, whilst his Enemies fell
into Disgrace.</P>
<P>The King still thoughtful of the Golden Beau∣ty,
it was not long after, but he sent for <HI>Ave∣nant</HI>
into his Cabinet, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d told him, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he,
was minded to send him Embassador to the Prin∣cess,
and try what Success would attend his
Negociations.</P>
<P>I am ready, (<HI>said</HI> Avenant) as soon as your
Majesty shall give me Orders.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>said the King,</HI> a Noble Equipage must
first be in readiness.</P>
<P>Equipage! (<HI>said he</HI>) I want nothing but
your Majesty's Letters, and a good Horse, and
to Morrow I'll make my Departure.</P>
<P>At this the King said, <HI>Be it so;</HI> and taking
him in his Arms, rejoyc'd at his Fidelity.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="107"/>
The next Morning, having taken a private
Leave of the King, <HI>Avenant</HI> began his Journ∣ey,
contemplating all the way how he should
bring this great Work about. Whatever came
into his Head of Moment; he minuted down
in his Table-Book; and he was one Morning
ar this Exercise at the bottom of a Meadow, by
a River's Side, when he saw a fine <HI>Carp,</HI> which
coming too near the Shoar, and by leaping at
some Flies, had flung herself on the Bank, and
there lay expiring.</P>
<P><HI>Avenant</HI> took Pity of the dying Fish, and
willing to preserve it, gently took it up, and
laid it in the River again.</P>
<P>The Fish immediately recov'ring itself, lifted
up its Head, and said, <HI>I thank you</HI> Avenant, <HI>my
Preserver, the time will come when I shall make
you amends.</HI> And so div'd to the bottom, to the
great surprize of <HI>Avenant.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day, as he travel'd along, he saw
a <HI>Crow</HI> ready to be devour'd by a rav'n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us <HI>Ea∣gle.</HI>
Pity siez'd his Breast; and letting fly an
Arrow from a Bow he had by him, shot the
<HI>Eagle</HI> thro' the Heart, and deliver'd the poo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Crow.</HI></P>
<P>The Bird no sooner saw herself freed; but
perching on a Tree, cry'd out; Avenant, <HI>tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
hast done well to relieve a poor wretched Bird, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
assur'd that I will take an Occasion to reward yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Generosity.</HI></P>
<P>The witty and grateful Answer of the <HI>Car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
and <HI>Crow,</HI> took extreamly with <HI>Avenant,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
made his Journey very pleasant. Early the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Morning he enter'd a dark Wood, where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="97" REF="108"/>
heard an Owl bemoaning herself, that was
caught in a Fowler's Net; and looking about
him, he no sooner spy'd her, but his Heart was
mov'd to release her Nocturnal Ladyship. Ac∣cordingly
he cut the Net, and out she flew.</P>
<P>The Owl expecting the Bird-catcher's coming
said, <HI>I must be short,</HI> Avenant, <HI>you have not only
my Thanks but my Heart; and the saving my
Life in this critical Juncture, shall another time
turn to your Advantage:</HI> And so flew away.</P>
<P>Some time after <HI>Avenant</HI> arriv'd at the Palace
where the Beauty with Golden Locks liv'd:
And that he might make an Agreeable Appear∣ance,
he put on a rich embroider'd Suit, a Plume
of white Feathers, and a fine Scarf about his
Neck. Thus equip'd, he took with him in a
Silk Net, a little pretty Dock, he had bought
by the way, and appear'd with such an Air of
Stateliness, that the Princess's Noblemen strove
who should introduce him first,</P>
<P>By this time the <HI>Golden Beauty</HI> was inform'd
of the Embassador's Arrival; and being told,
his N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me was <HI>Avenant,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> run in her Mind,
That it signify'd some good Luck to her; and
that he was lovely enough to draw the Affecti∣ons
of all the World after him.</P>
<P>Well (said she, to her Maid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Honour) ha∣sten
to dress me in my richest Robes, and let
me seated on my Throne with great Splendour,
that all Mankind may own, that I am the only
<HI>Beauty with Locks of Gold.</HI></P>
<P>Her Commands were no sooner obey'd, but
<HI>Avenant</HI> was introduc'd into her Presence. At
first sight of her, he was ravish'd, and for some
<PB N="98" REF="109"/>
not able to express himself: But commanding
a Presence of Mind, equal to the Greatness of
his Soul, he made a most eloquent Oration;
in which he requested a better Fortune from
the Princess, than to return without her to the
King his Master.</P>
<P>I approve of all you say, most accomplish'd
<HI>Avenant,</HI> (said the Princess) and you shall
have the preferrence of my Favours: But, by
the way, I must inform you, That some time
since, as my Maids and I was walking by a
River's side, in pulling of my Glove, there fell
from my Finger a Ring, which I valu'd above
the World; whereupon I made a Vow, never
to listen to the Offers of any Prince, 'till it was
restor'd me again by the Embassador who should
bring such Proposals.</P>
<P><HI>Avenant</HI> was much perplex'd at this An∣swer;
and standing some time silent, at last
beg'd the Princess to accept of his little Dog,
<HI>Caper,</HI> with his fine Scarf: But she refus'd his
Offer, and desir'd him to withdraw, he having
known her Mind already.</P>
<P>The Embassader retir'd to his Appartment, in
the utmost Consternation, to spend the Night
in fruitless Sighs and Thoughts; which littl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Caper</HI> perceiving with concern, said, Pray Sir▪
despair not; you are too Handsome to be mi∣serable:
Let us only by break of Day, go and
walk by the River's side.</P>
<P>The Advice was taken, and early, with fold∣ed
Arms, and melancholly Looks, he and <HI>Ca∣per</HI>
took their Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="110"/>
They had not gone far, but on a sudden he
heard a soft Voice calling out, <HI>Avenant! Ave∣nant!</HI>
He lookt about him for some time, but
could see nothing: At last his D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g <HI>Caper</HI>
peeping into the River, fortunately saw the
gilded <HI>Carp,</HI> and told his Master of it.</P>
<P><HI>The grateful Fish no sooner saw</HI> Avenant,
<HI>but appear'd above Water, and said,</HI> My dear
<HI>Avenant,</HI> for saving my Life in the Meadow, I am
here as good as my Word; take the Ring the Prin∣cess
has lost, and I wish you all Happiness.</P>
<P>In an Extasy of Joy, with a thousand Thank<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he took it out of her Mouth; at which instant
she g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve him a pleasant Look, leaving <HI>Caper</HI> to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kip and leap about his Master, for Joy that he
had prevail'd with him to walk thith<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</P>
<P>To Court they flew with all the Wings Joy
could give, but alas! the Princess only smil'd
when she was told of his return, and thought
it was only to have his final Audience of leave.
But when he came to her, and presented the
Ring not damnified, and demanded her in his
M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster's Name, she was in the utmost Conster∣nation,
and thought some <HI>Fairy</HI> had hely'd him
to it.</P>
<P>However (<HI>said she to</HI> Avenant) since your
Respect for me is so great, before I consent,
you must do me another piece of Service; and
which is, to fetch me the Head of a neighbour∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng
Tyrant, nam'd <HI>Galli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ron,</HI> who has ravag'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Territories, and murder'd my Subjects, be∣cause
I would not consent to have him for my
Husband; he being a prodigious Gyant, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evours Men with as much ease, as a Squirr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
<PB N="100" REF="111"/>
cracks Nuts; carrying in his Pockets, Field-Pieces
and Mortars, instead of Pistols; and has
a Voice astonishing as Thunder: Therefore it
is, that this Request of mine must be pereform'd
or else what you have done hitherto, is to no
purpose.</P>
<P>So great a Spirit as <HI>Avenant</HI>'s, had no need
of much Consideration; and therefore he pro∣mis'd
the <HI>Beauty with the Golden Locks,</HI> to Fight
this Monster of a Man; and so took his Leave
for that time.</P>
<P>He soon furnish'd himself with what Wea∣pons
were necessary, and the next Day mount∣ed
his Horse, with <HI>Caper</HI> in a Net by his Side;
and rode till he came within the Tyrant's Do∣minions.
And as he rode along, his little Dog
encourag'd him, with many diverting Promises
of biting the Gyant by the Legs all the time of
the Engagement; and that nothing should be
wanting in him for his Defence.</P>
<P>With this, and such like Discourse, they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eavel'd till they came to the Castle, amidst
vast Heaps of Skulls, raw Heads and bloody
Bones; and saw the Gyant stalking through <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
dismal Wood, Singing in Hoarse Tone, thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
inhuman Lines.</P>
<Q><L>Oh, how I want another Dish,</L>
<L>Of new-kill'd Man, that's Young and Fresh</L>
<L>The Marrow from the Bones I'd squeeze,</L>
<L>And such the Blood out by Degrees;</L>
<L>My sharpned Teeth, and scurvy Jaws,</L>
<L>If o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce they come within my Paws,</L>
<L><PB N="101" REF="112"/>
Should break my Fast with half a Score,</L>
<L>And stay my Dinner till I'd more.</L></Q>
<P>The invincible <HI>Avenant,</HI> hearing the <HI>Canibal</HI>'s
Wish, boldly made this short Reply.</P>
<Q><L>Here's One that will suffice you more,</L>
<L>Than all that thou hast kill'd before:</L>
<L>Thy Appetite shall soon be fed,</L>
<L>And I will bear away thy Head.</L>
<L>Thy Teeth and Jaws shall not me scare,</L>
<L>Therefore approach bold <HI>Av'nant</HI> here.</L></Q>
<P>At this <HI>Avenant</HI> drew his Sword, when the
Gyant with Scorn lifting up his m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssy Club,
with one Blow would have dash'd out his
Brains, had not a <HI>Crow,</HI> which settled on his
thick Skull, pick'd out the Monsters Eyes, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen flow to a Tree hard by.</P>
<P>The Gyant feeling the Blood trickle down
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Face, fell into such a Rage, that striking and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying about him at random, it gave <HI>Avenant</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Opportunity of sheathing his Sword in his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eart, and made him lye as it were, in a pond
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Blood.</P>
<P>The next thing was to whip off his Head;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which time the <HI>Crow</HI> put him in mind, That

<P><PB N="102" REF="113"/>
<HI>Avenant</HI> having given the <HI>Crow</HI> many a
hearty Thank, rode away with the Gyant's
Head to Court. At his approach, the Palace
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung with <HI>Huzza</HI>'s, and, <HI>Long live courageous</HI>
Avenant! And so with Triumph he laid the
frightful Head, at the Feet of the Princess,
which made her Blood thrill, tho' she was glad
of the Prospect.</P>
<P>Take there, Madam, said <HI>Avenant,</HI> the Head
you wanted, and now let my Royal Master
have his desire.</P>
<P>At which the Princess bowing, fetcht a Sigh,
and said; Unfortunate me, that cannot yet
consent to what you ask. There is (<HI>added she</HI>)

has, in giving and preserving everlastingly, both
those Jewels to Persons never so Young, De∣formed,

by two fiery Dragons, whose Locks bring Deat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

I must have, or else I will never depart m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Kingdom:</P>
<P>This must needs be very surprizing to on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
who had merited so much already: But <HI>Ave∣nant</HI>
in Obedience to her Commands, told h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he would do his Endeavour, tho' it were to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Ruin of himself, for the sake of his Master.</P>
<P>And accordingly, with his little Dog <HI>Caper</HI>
he began this difficult Enterprize; wonderin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P><PB N="103" REF="114"/>
Well, he was no sooner in the Wood, but
he saw the frightful Draggons spitting out their
Fire, which ascended to the Skies in fearful
black Clouds of Smoke. Pulling out the Vial
in Despair. Take this (said he, to <HI>Caper</HI>)
and when I am dead, carry my Blood in it to
the Princess, and let her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee the Effects of her
Desire; and then go and acquaint the King
my Master of my undeserved End.—</P>
<P>Hold, <HI>Avenant,</HI> hold; (said the <HI>Owl</HI> he had
formerly sav'd from the Bird-catcher's Net)
Let me also do one Kindness for another; and
as an Instance of my Affection for you I'll fill
the Vial with the Water of Beauty: For all
the secret-Holes and Avenues to it, are known
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e better than my self. So he gave her

Hour, she return'd with it full to his Sati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fa∣ction,
and sent him back to the Princess with a

<P>The <HI>Beauty with Locks of Gold,</HI> receiv'd him

gave immediate Orders for her Departure, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccording with great Splendour set out along
with him; but by the way, took an Opportu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity
to discover more Affections for him, than
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Prince she was going to. <HI>Avenant</HI> knowing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Mind, intimated, that he could not be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilty of Treachery to his Master, tho' he could
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove none more than so beautiful a Princess.</P>
<P>When they arriv'd at the King's Palace, he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd all his Nobles, went in a sumptuous man∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
to meet her. And the Marriage being per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed
with great Splendour and Rejoycing,
<PB N="104" REF="115"/>
told his Majesty pleasantly, That if it had not
been for faithful <HI>Avenant,</HI> she had not been
his Bride: for that he had effected it, by ob∣taining
her a Bottle of Water, which would
always make her Young and Beautiful.</P>
<P>And truly, the Respect she discover'd to <HI>A∣venant,</HI>
drew upon him the Calumnies of some
jealous Noblemen, that envy'd her Happiness,
so that in a little time, they persuaded the too
credulous King to imprison him in a loath∣some
Dungeon, where he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for all his
faithful Services, with Bread and Water.</P>
<P>The Queen having often besought his Dis∣charge
with Tears, was so far from gaining i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that it increas'd the King's Jealousie; who cal∣ling
to Mind the Water of Beauty that was in
her Bed-Chamber, it came into his jealous Pate
to try if he could make himself Beautiful and
Young with it. But fortunately it proved to
<HI>Avenant</HI>'s Advantage, and lasting Felicity.</P>
<P>For a Servant brushing down the Cieling▪
accidentally broke the Bottle with her Broom▪
and not knowing what to do in so great per∣plexity,
went to the King's Closet, and took
thence a Bottle with Liquor in it, like that she

Poyson his Nobility with at Pleasure) and put∣ting
in the same place, left all things as sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>The King next Morning went and apply'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

with comfortable News from the Queen, was
the first that heard of this lucky Accident, and
away he gallop'd with it to the Prison. Now,
thought <HI>Avenant,</HI> the time of Deliverance draws
nigh. He immediately dispatch'd his light-footed
Courier to the Queen, to implore her
Majesty's Compassion of his Afflictions at that
juncture.</P>
<P>He need not have ask'd it; for she was dri∣ving
to him <HI>incognito</HI> with all speed. When

Princess Rosetta.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Empire of the Fairies was
Govern'd by the most serene Empress
<HI>Truffio,</HI> their reign'd a King and
Queen who had Two Sons and one Daughter;
Children of all the promising Aspects that
could be expected. The Daughter was every
way lovely, and had as she grew up, stole a∣way
the Heart and Soul of her Mother; inso∣much,
that a Concern for her future Welfare,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut her upon enquiring of some eminent Fai∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies,
what Fortune would attend the remainder
of her Life.</P>
<P>They all agreed in one Judgment, and told
her, that she would run thro' very many Dif∣ficulties,
and then arrive to a lasting Happi∣ness;
but that her two Brothers should be con∣demn'd
to Death upon her Account.</P>
<P>This Curiosity in the Queen, drew a deep
Melancholly upon her, which put the King
upon a serious Enquiry into the Cause of her
Grief. She had often put him off with preva∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cating
Stories, till one Day he urg'd her so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose she was oblig'd to confess what the Fairies
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad predicted of their Children.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="119"/>
The Ring no sooner heard her, but was for
destroying the Daughter in her Cradle, to pre∣serve
his Male Issue. The Queen with Tears
in her Eyes, exhorted him to save them all,
particularly the young princess. At length it
was concluded to consult an old Hermit not
far from Court, and stand to his Advice in the
matter.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the Queen went to his Cell,
and having told the grave Gentleman the O∣pinion
of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fairies, he sent her back, and
bid her tell the King, That the only Expedi∣ent
to save his Sons, would be to confine his
Daughter to perpetual Imprisonment.</P>
<P>Well, the Advice was put in Execution, and
into a strong Castle she was put for her Life▪
And that she might not shorten her Days by
so close a Retirement, she had now and then,
the Conversation of her Father and Mother
and the young Princes her Brothers. And thu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
she spent her time, till the King and Queen
fell sick and dy'd.</P>
<P>When every one was in the deepest Sorrow
for their Death, the Nobles and Grandees o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

him on the Throne of his Father.</P>
<P>And then the new King and his Brother
who lov'd their Sister entiraly, went and fetch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
her from her Confinement, with a design t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Princess soon stept after him, when to her sur∣prize,
she saw him barking at a stately <HI>Peacock,</HI>
which had put his Tail and whole Body in a
Majestick Posture.</P>
<P>The Princess admiring it's charming Beauty,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sk'd the King, what Creature that was. O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,

<P>When they came to Court, her two Brothers

The King said to his Brother, Certainly if the
King of this Country should prove a <HI>Peacock</HI>
himself, how ridiculous will it be, to suffer
ourselves to be ally'd to him; and to have our
Sister bring forth <HI>Pea-Chickens,</HI> instead of Chil∣dren?</P>
<P>But when they came to the Metropolis of
the Kingdom, instead of <HI>Peacocks,</HI> nothing was
seen but Men and Women, deck'd with Pea∣cock's

Dress, with a Peacock's Tail powder'd,
with Diamonds in his Crown.</P>
<P>Assoon as he s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w the two strange Princes, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>When his <HI>Peacock</HI> Majesty was to Dine, the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Golden Branch: Or, Prince Non∣pareil,
and the Princess Brilliant.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the Death of Queen <HI>Gentilla,</HI> an
illnatur'd Prince ascended the Throne,
whose i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>placable Disposition had pro∣cur'd
him to be nicknam'd the <HI>Brown Ring.</HI>
He had a Son nam'd <HI>Tortieuli,</HI> monstro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly de∣form'd
in Body, but possess'd with a Soul eve∣ry
way agreeable and pleasing.</P>
<P>The King his Father had pitch'd upon the
Daughter of a neighbouring Prince to be his
Wife, nam'd <HI>Trogniana;</HI> a mere Dwarf, and
one that had a Face very ugly and frightful, bat
was endow'd with many rare and bright Accom∣plishments,
with abundance of Wit and Good
Humour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brown King</HI> having got her Picture pre∣sented
it his Son, and commanded him to ad∣mire
it, and prepare to marry the Original.
The Prince took it, and looking upon it with
Contempt, modestly told his Father, That he
was resolv'd never to marry such a prepost'rous
Creature. The King grew Angry at his Ob∣stinacy,
and to correct his Disobedience, threw
him into a Castle, wherein no Prisoner had been
many Years before.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="133"/>
Then the <HI>Brown King</HI> sent an Embassador
with his Son's Picture to <HI>Trogniana</HI>'s Father,
to demand her in Marriage; which the King
no sooner saw, but imbracing the Offer, carry'd
it his Daughter, and told <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, That it was his
Will that she should place her Affection upon
the Prince that Picture represented; for that
he was to be her Husband.</P>
<P>As soon as the Princess saw it, she began to
look pale, and her Heart swelling with Grief,
she could not forbear shedding some Tears.</P>
<P>Her Father took the Resentment immedi∣ately;
and ordering a Looking-Glass to be
brought, There, said he, see your own Deform∣ity,
and examine with your self, what reason
you have to be dissatisfy'd▪ <HI>Trogniana</HI> would
fain have excused herself, and persuaded her
Father to drop a Match she had no Inclination
to: But the angry Parent said, it was his
Pleasure it should be so, and therefore command∣ed
her to be ready to depart in a few Hours.</P>
<P>The Princess was so dutiful as to suffer her∣self
to begin the Journey in a Post-Chaise; and
where we must leave her, pursuing her Journey
awhile, and return to the imprison'd Prince.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Torticuli</HI> walking in a Gallery in the
Castle, like others in Confinement, could not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orbear thinking of his Misfortunes. He con∣ceiv'd
it afflicting enough, to be sensible of his
own Deformity; much more, that he should
be oblig'd to captivate his Will to a Person<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ten times more despicable than himself.</P>
<P>In the midst of these Confusions, he threw
his Eyes about, and 'spy'd a certain Parcel of
<PB N="121" REF="134"/>
Pictures, which for their Antiquity, had been
preserv'd there as great Rairities. The Beauty
and Vivacity of these Originals, made him in∣spect
them with more Curiosity, when he dis∣cover'd
a young Man among them, exactly
the Picture of himself, who was painted taking
a Gold Key out of a Stone-Wall.</P>
<P>In many places he saw his Picture; as also
that of a most beautiful Princess, whose Looks
were so agreeable to him, that he could not
forbear admiring of it. Indeed it was matter of
Wonder to him, to see such surprizing Rari∣ties;
and he could not imagine what <HI>Genius</HI>
should inspire the Painter's Breast, to Picture
him above two Hundred Years before he came
into the World.</P>
<P>With these Speculations he retir'd to his
Chamber, and taking an old Manuscript that
lay by him, opened it, and found the same Pi∣ctures
in it he saw before. Turning over some
of the Leaves▪ immediately a Consort of Mu∣sick
was heard; Gamesters were seen playing
at all sorts of Games; Weddings, Dancing,
Singing, and what not? At last, turning over
a certain Leaf, he saw really a Parcel of <HI>Pigmy
Gentry,</HI> Feasting themselves merrily, when one
of them taking a Glass, turn'd to the Prince,
and drank his Health; and told him withal,
That he should be a happy Prince, if he restor'd
them their Queen, but miserable if not.</P>
<P>The Prince was so frightned at these Appa∣ritions,
that for some time he swooned away,
and let drop his Book on the Floor. He was
no sooner recover'd, but willing to review the
<PB N="122" REF="135"/>
Cause of his Indisposition, he took up the
Book, and looking into it again, found nothing
at all in it. This was another shocking sur∣prize
to him; but it presently went off by
concluding, that what he had hitherto seen,
was nothing but Delusion.</P>
<P>Early the next Day he went into the Galle∣ry
again, where the Pictures appear'd to him,
as if they were all alive. Among the rest, he
saw his own Picture going up into the Tower:
And willing to see the issue of so nice a Won∣der,
followed it; and by imitating its Actions,
in every thing, found in a Hole of the Wall,
a Gold Key, that had been hid there some A∣ges.
The Prince took it up, and open'd a Cup∣board
just by, whose out-side seem'd very odd
and ugly, but within very beautiful and delicate.
The Drawers were all of Chrystal. Amber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and were full of the most admirable Curiosities.
At this charming sight, the Prince was extream∣ly
pleas'd, until open<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng a certain Drawer, a
<HI>Brilliant</HI> Box appear'd, in which was a Man's
Hand wel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring in its Blood.</P>
<P>A Man had need of a great deal of Spirit, at
so strange a sight; but the Prince being a Prince
of Resolution, and recollecting what one of the
Pigmies had told him, he took Courage, and
said; Tell me, if possible, O unhappy Hand,
what has render'd thee so unfortunate? A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
these Words, the Hand began to move, and
by Signs said, Happy Prince, thou art able to
set free one of the brightest Beauties on Earth▪
Repair to the Gallery, and where thou seest th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Sun shine, besure to search; for there lyes all
<PB N="123" REF="136"/>
my Happiness; and there you will find the end
of your Misfortunes.</P>
<P>The Prince putting the Hand in its place a∣gain,
and the Key in the whole of the Wall,
went thither accordingly; and observing where
the Sun shone, he found the Picture of an ange∣lick
Youth hanging against the Wall. His Cu∣riosity
led him to turn it aside, under which
was a wainscotted Ebony Wall, gilt with Gold,
and which rais'd it self on a sudden, and pre∣sented
the Prince with a Prospect of a stately
Chamber of Porphyry. He entred it, and ad∣vancing
some Steps, went through an infinite
Number of fine Appartments, to a little Cham∣ber,
where he found sleeping on a rich Couch,
under a Canopy, one of the loveliest Beauties in
the World: Her Hair was as black as a Raven,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hanging in Curls about her Breasts, which were
whiter than Snow.</P>
<P>The Prince observing her languishing posture
found she was now and then interrupted in her
Sleep, with deep Sighs, Startings, aud Expostu∣lating
with herself.—</P>
<P>—He had not gaz'd long, but, Perfidious
(cry'd she in her Sleep) Dost thou think to share
my Affections, by robbing me of <HI>Transimenes?</HI>
Thou barbarous Cruel, whose Villany shall one
Day meet with a Punishment from that Hand,
thou hast separated from the Body of my love∣ly
Prince.—[Here she started, her Flesh
trembled, her Pulse beat violently, and her Eyes
let fall some Tears; and then clinching eager∣ly
her Hands, went on▪—Yes Wretch
Furies shall prey upon thy treacherous Soul!
<PB N="124" REF="137"/>
Ah, <HI>Trasimenes! Trasimenes!</HI> unhappy, wretch∣ed,
and miserable I, that am banish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d thy sight!</P>
<P>The Prince heard and saw all with the great∣est
Surprize; and whilst he was busying his
Thoughts about his Lady, a Consort of Birds
made a most agreeable Harmony, when in came
an Eagle, with a <HI>Golden Branch,</HI> full of Rubie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Diamonds. The kingly Bird, immediate∣ly
flew round her, and gently fann'd her with
his Wings: Then he gave the <HI>Branch</HI> to Prince
<HI>Torticuli,</HI> at which all the Birds scriem'd out
so loud, they made the Palace ring again.</P>
<P>This Accident soon inclin'd the Prince to
believe the Lady was inchanted; and to try
the Experiment, bowing himself gently, he
touch'd her with the Branch, and conjur'd her
in the Name of <HI>Trasimenes,</HI> to awake from her
Trance; when in a Minute, she opened her
Eyes, and looked about. 'Spying the Eagle,
she cry'd out, Stay, the Life of my Love, stay!
But the Eagle taking no Notice, flew away
with the rest of the Birds, leaving a most la∣mentable
Cry behind him.</P>
<P>Then the Lady address'd <HI>Torticuli,</HI> and return∣ing
him Thanks, for freeing her from a Le∣thargy
which had captivated her Two Hundred
Years, told him, that she was able, wil∣ling,
and very ready to make him whatever he
pleas'd.</P>
<P>In short, after some Compliments between
them, the Prince, willing to be Strait like other
Men, ask'd that Favour of her, which she rea∣dily
granted.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="138"/>
The beautiful Lady bid him stand still, and
took the <HI>Gilded Branch,</HI> aud strok'd him thrice
with it. Rise, Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> one of the com∣pleatest,
and accomplished Men in the Uni∣verse:
and immediately he did so. Now,
said she, go by the Name of <HI>Nonpareil;</HI> for
none ever did, nor never wil merit so much
as yourself. Go (<HI>added she</HI>) from hence, be
Happy; Fortune will at last be favourable;
and let the Fairy <HI>Benigna</HI> be, now and then, the
Subject of your Thoughts.</P>
<P>With these Words, both Lady, Palace, and
all therein vanish'd in a Moment, when the
Prince found himself in a spacious Wood, a
Hundred Leagues distant from the Tower he
was before confin'd in.</P>
<P>To return. When the Guards miss'd Prince
<HI>Torticuli,</HI> the dread of the King's Displeasure,
put them upon giving out, that he was fallen
Sick; appointing one of their crooked Com∣rades
to lye in his Bed, and personate him,
in case the King should come to see him. This
Project had its Effect: For the King was no
sooner told of it, but he made slight of the
matter, and said, He was not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orry his Son had
his Deserts.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Princess <HI>Trogniana</HI>
arrived: And when the King saw her wide
Mouth, her scropulous Skin, and Negro's Nose,
the King, by way of Banter, thanked her for
her Civility in refusing to marry his Son, who
was not half so deformed as herself.</P>
<P>No matter for that, my Liege, <HI>said she,</HI> Your
Majesty may divert yourself from the Thoughts
<PB N="126" REF="139"/>
of a Match with your Son, for I am not so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of Conceit with my self, as to make him my
Husband.</P>
<P>At this the King grew Angry, and said, he
would see to that: And so order'd her an Ap∣partment;
and some Ladies were assign'd to
persuade her to the Marriage.</P>
<P>Whilst Matters were thus transacting at
Court, the Kings Guards sent his Majesty No∣tice
that the Prince his Son was dead, having
put some heavy Lun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ber in a Coffin to disguise<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the matter. The credulous King Wept at the
News; and without repairing to the Castle
gave Orders for his private Interment.</P>
<P>His Fancy had form'd a Notion, that <HI>Trog∣niana</HI>
had some Hand in his Death; so that to
satisfy his Revenge, and punish her Disobedi∣ence,
he made bold to confine her in the same
Tower for her Life.</P>
<P>The Princess, in this Affliction was thought∣ful
of her Father, and accordingly wrote seve∣ral
Letters to him; but they were all intercept∣ed,
and carry'd to the <HI>Brown Monarch.</HI> She in∣deavour'd
to Divert herself; and would now
and then be admiring the Pictures in the Gal∣lery.</P>
<P>One Day, as she was at this Exercise, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
perceiv'd among them, the Picture of her ow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ugly Self. It surpriz'd her to besure, and sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
made Reflections upon the Painter for it, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the more, when she saw by it, the Pictur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of a beautiful Shepherd and Shepherdess, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whom she was mightily taken.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="140"/>
In the midst of this Surprize, a deformed old
Witch appear'd, and told her, That she was
sensibly touch'd with her Misfortunes, and was
come thither to Comfort her. Sigh not at that
beautiful Shepherdess, (said she) for I can make
you altogether as lovely. Chuse therefore,
Virtue or Beauty, for Fate has decreed one of
them to be your Portion.</P>
<P>The Princess being sensible that Beauty was
not lasting, chose Vertue as the most substan∣tial
Treasure.</P>
<P>The old Woman at this, presented her with
her Muff, which was White and Yellow, and
told her, that if she blew on the yellow side,
she would become like the lovely Shepherdess,
and that if she blew on the white side, her Ver∣tue
would become fix'd as Fate it self.</P>
<P>The Princess accepted the Muff, and blowing
as she had order'd on the white side, immediate∣ly
found the Effects aforesaid.</P>
<P>Thus blest with one of the best Portions a
Woman can have, she contented herself to wait
the arrival of her Father. And with expecta∣tion
of seeing him, she would often get into the
Tower to look for his coming.</P>
<P>Going up one Day very eagerly, her Foot
struck against some loose Stones in the Wall,
and forc'd out the Golden Key, which she pre∣sently
snatcht up. Certainly, thought she, this
Key must be of some use hereabouts; and spy∣ing
the Cupboard, soon concluded it belong'd
to that.</P>
<P>With this thought she look'd some time, but
could see no sign of a Lock. At last she found
<PB N="128" REF="141"/>
the Key-Hole, and opening it, was as much
charmed with what she saw, as the Prince be∣fore
her.</P>
<P>In short, she came to the Bloody Hand in the
Box, and was so much concern'd at it, that she
would have laid it aside, had not something
whisper'd in her Far, and bid her take Cou∣rage,
lay the Hand under her Pillow; and when
she saw an Eagle appear to give it him.</P>
<P>The Princess having put every thing as she
found them, took the Hand, and did as she
was bid.</P>
<P>But three Nights was no sooner gone, when
an Eagle came fluttering at her Window; and
then remembring what she was told, she opened
the Casement, and let him in. The Bird was
extreamly pleas'd with his Admittance, when
she presently gave him the bloody Hand: and
in less than a Minute, there appear'd in the
room of the Eagle, a compl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> young Gentle∣man,
with a Crown of Gold on his Head, and
his Robes flowered with Diamonds and pre∣cious
Stones.</P>
<P>In short, he no sooner appear'd, but he ad∣dress'd
the Princess, and told her, That a certain
Conjurer had kept him there 200 Years; be∣cause
that the Fairy <HI>Benigna</HI> had rejected the
Magician, and bestowed her Heart upon him;
That out of Spite he had cut off his Hand
as he stood admiring one Day, the Picture of
his Mistress: That by Virtue of his Magick, he
had turned him into an Eagle, and caused the
Queen to be thrown into a perpetual Sleep:
That he was told, that a certain Prince and
<PB N="129" REF="142"/>
Princess, should restore them to their former
Happiness, after the expiration of two Hundred
Years: and for that reason, the Fairy <HI>Benigna</HI>
took such Care to lock up his Hand where the
Princess found it.—</P>
<P>Having said this, he look'd earnestly on the
Princess, and cry'd, Speak, Madam, and ask
what you will, for it is in my power to effect
it.</P>
<P>The surprized Princess knowing that Beau∣ty
vanisheth like a Blast, kept to a solid Prin∣ciple,
and told him, that since it must be so,
she desired nothing but that her Soul might be
as Beautiful as her Body was Ugly.</P>
<P>For a Reward of your Humility (<HI>said he</HI>)
be happy in both Soul and Body: And gent∣ly
touching her, she became one of the most
lovely Shepherdess's in the World. Now, <HI>said
he,</HI> I see you compleat, according to your De∣serts,
boar hence-forward the Name of <HI>Brilliant</HI>
for none has ever brighter Perfections than
your self; and you shall at last be crown'd
with Happiness.</P>
<P>With these Words every thing vanished a∣bout
her, and she found herself in the same
Wood where Prince <HI>Torticuli</HI> was turn'd Shep∣herd.</P>
<P>She no sooner saw herself in the lonesome
place, with a Flock of Sheep, a Crook, and a
little Dog by her side, but she was full of
Thought, and could not forbear admiring, that
she who was a Princess before, was now become
a poor Shepheredess, withour Friends or Rela∣tions.
But tho' she had some dejected Thoughts
<PB N="130" REF="143"/>
the suddenness of he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Charge, yet they lasted
not; for all the Birds, Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks Woods, Groves,
and Flowers c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nspir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to make her Life plea∣sant
and sweet.</P>
<P>In this State she conten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed herself to feed her
innocent Flock till the Shepherd Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce wan∣dering
one Summer's Day from his Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck, found
the lovely She sleeping under a shady Tree by a
River's side.</P>
<P>The Prince no sooner saw a Beauty so surpri∣zing,
but gently made his Approaches to her;
and viewing all the Charms of Love in one Bo∣dy,
remain'd fix'd like a Statue till the Princess
awoke.</P>
<P>Ah! incomparable Shepherdess (<HI>cry'd he</HI>) is it
possible you should fly Mankind for the sake of this
solitary place? Forbid it Heavens! Behold a
faithful Shepherd for ever devoted to your Ser∣vice.
Let me therefore be first in the List of your
Admirers, and render my Assiduities acceptable to
so powerful a Beauty.</P>
<P>I thank you Shepherd, said she, if any can
claim my Esteem, 'tis yourself. But I had ra∣ther
live this Life with my Sheep and Dog,
than be disturb'd with the Hurry and Noise of
publick Business: To convince me, therefore,
of your Esteem, conduct me to some little Cot∣tage,
where I may be friendly entertain'd.</P>
<P>Yes, lovely Fair, said he, and so led her to a
little House, where liv'd a lame, old Woman,
who receiv'd her with as much Tenderness as if
she had been her own Daughter.</P>
<P>After the old Grannam had made her sit
down, Pray Sweetheart, (said she) What's your
<PB N="131" REF="144"/>
Name? <HI>Brilliant,</HI> quoth the Princess, making
her a low Courtesy, with which the ancient H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣stess
was so well satisfied, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clently set
before her Bread, Butter, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Eggs,
and all sorts of Fruit, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eartily.
The Prince at the same time b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g'd to sit down
by her, which she con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ented to; and from that
time was so smitten with him, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as
the remainder of her Thoughts. When they
had done, the Shepherdess arose, thank'd her
aged Hostess for the Civilities she had receiv'd,
and taking her Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, made the Prince under∣stand,
that his Conversation was no farther ne∣cessary
at that time; and so went alone to her
Flock.</P>
<P>But it was not long before Love found out
Ways and Means to bring them together. The
Shepherd would often drive his Sheep among
hers, and whilst they were feeding, entertain
her with amorous Songs, and pleasant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
upon his oaten Reed. And yet, strange My∣stery!
tho' Love had possest both their Hearts,
that they could have dy'd for each other, yet
they could not forbear reflecting inwardly upon
their own Weakness, in setting their Affecti∣ons
upon what they thought below their Birth.</P>
<P>Thus Love continu'd in Masquerade some
time till the Shepherdess fled the Shepherd one
Day, and left him disconsolate. Amongst the
many Inventions Love could find, to retrieve
so great a Loss, the Prince made choice of this.
He took a tender Lamb, and ty'd Flowers and
Ribbonds about its innocent Neck; and dres∣sing
himself in a taffery Wastcoat, very richly
<PB N="132" REF="145"/>
lac'd down the Seams, he went and found out
the Shepherdess as she was sitting very thought∣ful
by a River's side:</P>
<P><HI>Presenting her the innocent Lamb:</HI> Ah!
(<HI>cry'd he</HI>) what have I done, thus to banish you
into Solitude? What Fault have I committed,
that you, lovely Shepherdess; should fly me? Was
it because your Flock and mine had the Care of
one Shepherd? Is it because I would free you from
all the Misfortunes that may befall you? Is it be∣cause
I burn, consume, and expire for the Love of
you? O hard Fate! worse than what hither to has
befallen me, that she whom I adore, should punish
my Presence by her Absence; and let another ren∣der
all my passionate Respects and Assiduities fruit∣less!</P>
<P><HI>Brilliant,</HI> having heard this, reply'd, and told
him, That he had no re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son to fear her flying
him, since it was so far out of Hatred to his
Person, that she suffer'd Violence in doing it.
That it was the Effect of Love and Duty, be∣twixt
which she struggled, that made her so shy
of him, not but that she could for ever sit by
the River's side, and contentedly see his love∣ly
Shade in the Water. She conjur'd him,
therefore, by all the Respect he b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re her, to
leave her to herself; for that he having already
her Heart in Possession, she did not know, what
Treacherous Act it might be guilty of, by sur∣rendring
up what she had with a Vow devo∣tev
to Heaven.</P>
<P>Having thus inform'd him, she gave a sudden
Start, and flew from the place where she sate,
<PB N="133" REF="146"/>
with incredible swiftness. The dej<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted Lover
perceiving her flight, would have overtaken
her; hut, alas! his Grief was too weighty, and
his Sorrow too prevailing; he fell down by the
pressure of his Torments, and lay in a languish∣ing
Condition.</P>
<P>The Princess had looked back, and seen his
Sufferings; yet for all the Pity she had for him,
could not prevail with herself to return to his
Assistance. She thought if she did, he would
discover too soon the Conquest he had made
over her. So that with much ado, she aban∣doned
one more dearer to her than her Life:</P>
<P>When she was out of Sight, she exclaim'd a∣gainst
her beauteous Severity, and wish'd her∣self
deformed as before. Amidst a Thousand
Thoughts revolving in her Mind, at last Vir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue
led her away in Triumph, with a Resolution
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o fly him for ever.</P>
<P>She had been told of an eminent Magician
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat lived in a Castle not far off: And that she
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight wholly abandon the Thoughts and Idea
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f her Shepherd, she was resolved to apply her∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lf
to this Enchanter, and ask his Advice.</P>
<P>With this Resolution she put Wings to her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, till she came through one of his Forrests,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here she fancied she heard several Songs, tri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mphing
over her Weakness and Favours, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould often put her in mind of turning back
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reproach him. But adhering to her first
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rinciple, at last to the Conjurer's Castle she
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me; having run through many Briars and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>horns, and suffer'd both Hunger and Tirst in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Journey.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="147"/>
Having entred the Castle, the first Room she
went into, was dark as Night, there being no
Light but what appear'd thro' a Crevice In∣stead
of Wainscoat, it was lin'd with the Wings
of Bats and Owls. Twelve Cats hung by their
Tails in the Cieling, grouling and scratching
one another most fearfully. Underneath was a
long Table, on which as many Mice were tyed
at a certain distance out of their reach, from a
great quantity of Cheese and Bacon: so that
all their time was spent in vai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for tho they
reacht and strove never so much, to satisfy their
famisht Bellies with what they most admired,
yet were they never the nearer.</P>
<P>Whilst the Princess was gazing at this Ad∣venture,
in came the Conjurer in a soo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Gar∣ment,
with a fearful Crocodile on his Head for
a Cap. A Whip, with ten thousand knotted
Snakes at the end on it, was in one Hand, and
his Spectacles in t'other. Fear presently seiz'd
the Princess, who was so terrified at his Looks,
that she would have given ten thousand Worlds
to have gotten back again. She strove, but in
vain; for the old Wizzard had hamper'd her
fast in a parcel of Nets, so that she fell down,
and thought she felt a tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sand Pins and Need∣les
piercing her tender Flesh.</P>
<P><HI>All this while the Conjurer made himself mer∣ry
with her Misfortunes. At last he bellow'd
in her Ear, with a hideous Noise these Words▪</HI>
Seest thou not these Cats and Mice? <HI>said he▪</HI>
They were all Princes and Princesses. <HI>I</HI> could
have loved the Girls, but they refus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d my kindness▪
And the Rogues their Sweethearts that would have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="135" REF="148"/>
rival'd me, I decoy'd hither at several times, &amp;
now you see I have made an Example of 'em,
by turning them into Cats and Mice. A Di∣version
mighty agreeable to me, because that
they now are Hated by each other, as much as
they were Beloved before.</P>
<P>No matter for that, (<HI>said</HI> Brilliant, <HI>interrup∣ting
the Conjurer</HI>) I'll be a Mouse too.</P>
<P>Fool, (<HI>said he</HI>) Love me, and thou shalt want
for nothing a Lady can wish for.</P>
<P>Not I (<HI>said she</HI>) I will suffer Death first.</P>
<P>Nay, (<HI>quoth he</HI>) if you are so Obstinate, you
shall not be what you would, a <HI>Mouse,</HI> but a Crea∣ture
of a different Species. <HI>And touching her
with his wicked Wand,</HI> Be therefore a Grashop∣per,
<HI>said he,</HI> to live in the Fields and Groves.</P>
<P>The Princess immediately became that little
Animal, but retaining still her Reason, she ga∣ther'd
up her lovely nimble Limbs, and hop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
into the adjacent Woods, and thus bemoaned
herself.</P>
<P>Unfortunate Creature, cry'd she, that would
not be Happy when it was in thy Power to
be so! See the folly of Ingratitude! Alas!
what am I now? What was I before, when the
faithful Shepherd sought my Love? A beau∣tiful
Shepherdess, that had a free Heart then to
dispose of to the lovely <HI>Nonpariel!</HI> But now,
by my too nice Coyness a silly Infect, doom'd
to chirp out my Afflictions, and wander out
my Days in the verdant Grass till the Foot of
some regardless cruel Creature, tramples me to
Death.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="149"/>
Whilst the Princess thus lamented her Condi∣tion,
the Prince was as much afflicted for her
Absence, He bemoaned himself every where;
and tired with seeking her, sate himself under
a Tree, He took his Pen-knife, and in Lover's
Characters, ingraved upon the Bark of it, the
History of his Misfortunes. He had no sooner
finished it, but an <HI>Oreade,</HI> or Mountain Fairy
appeared to him, and pointing towards a certain
Castle, bid him repair thither, where he should
hear News of his Shepherdess.</P>
<P>The Prince thanked her▪ and went thither ac∣cordingly,
where he found the Castle full o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Globes of Fire; without any stop or stay, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
rushed into the great Hall, where he was stop'd
by a most deformed Fairy, Hag-ridden, with
Saucer Eyes, Brimstone Breath, Snaky Hair, and
her Looks more frightful than Death, yet sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>She no sooner fixed her Glaring Eyes on him
but in a scrieming Tone, I am the Empress <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

How, Wretch, said the Cholerick Hag, d'ye
slight me so? With that she struck her Wand
against the Floor, and immediately a whole
Army of Monstrous Beasts, in devilish Shapes,
appear'd to fight him.</P>
<P>The poor Prince had nothing to defend him∣self
with but his Crook; and was terrified
with their many-headed Looks, that he conclu∣ded
now was the time that he must suffer Death
for his Shepherdess; and put himself in a Po∣sture
accordingly.</P>
<P>The Fairy perceiving his Resolution so strong,
was resolv'd to do her utmost; she caused his
Shepherdess to appear, and cry'd out: Now,
Sir, Consent to my Embraces, or else this Girl
you Love, shall be sacrific'd before your Eyes.</P>
<P>These Words so sensibly touch'd his Heart,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he fancied he heard his Shepherdess, at the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame time bid him do what the Empress would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave him. In this Extremity he bethought him∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf
of the Fairy <HI>Benigna,</HI> and calling to him∣self
upon that good Fairy, he thought he heard
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y her these Words.</P>
<Q><L>Fate will have its fixed Course,</L>

<L>And none shall be more blest than you.</L>
<L>In the mean time, Prince be inclin'd</L>
<L>The <HI>Gilded Branch</HI> to seek and find.</L></Q>
<P>And with these Lines ended, the Fury of all
had seen; his Princess was vanish'd and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e likewise, when the hagged Fairy seeing
<PB N="138" REF="151"/>
her attempts in vain, against a superior Power.
Depart (said she to the Prince) whose Heart
burns so violently with true Love, and because
you have so much of that Element in you, be
henceforth a Cricket which wholly delights in
Warmth</P>
<P>'Twas done in an Instant, and he became a
little Cole black Cricket, and was turn'd out to
wander and seek after a warm Birth. But the
<HI>Gilded Branch</HI> still ran in his Mind, and he
thought that if he could find that, it would help
to uncricket him: So that with such like con∣jectures,
he travelled with his little Feet, till
he came to a hollow Tree, where sate chirping
a lovely Grashopper. The Cricket had not as
yet met with any Conversation; and taking this
Insect to be a Grashopper of Parts, address'd
her thus: Whither goest thou, lovely Grashop∣per?
said he. And whither goest thou pritty
Cricket? said the Grashopper. What! Canst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

not we Grashoppers (said she briskly) spea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as well as you Crickets. Nay, said the Cricket<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I speak because I am a young Man. And<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
because I am a young Virgin (said the other.)<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Say you so? said the Cricket, then our Fortune<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

I should be glad to bear thee company. Ah<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Fate would have its course; but bid me go see<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the <HI>Guilded Branch,</HI> and in search of such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P><PB N="139" REF="152"/>
This Discourse was broke off by 2 Mice, who
jumpt presently upon them, and forc'd both
Cricket, Grashopper, and Mice into the hollow
Tree Alas, Madam, cryes one Mouse, I have
got a Stitch in my Side, by our Flight, how does
your Highness? Troth very bad, said t'other
M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use, but had not a piece of my Tail been
chopt off, I had still been ty'd to the Wizzards
Table. Did you see how the old Rogue pursued
us? Protect us, Providence, cry'd the first Mouse
especially your Royal Highness, and send us
safe to the <HI>Gilded Branch▪</HI> D'ye know the way?
said t'other. Yes, yes, cry'd the biggest, as well
as my Right-Hand from my Left.</P>
<P>The Grashopper perceiving this Couple in the
same Condition as herself, said, Aceept Ladies of
the Company of this honest Cricket and my self,
who are alike travelling thither; and we shall
be thankful for it.</P>
<P>In short, after some few Ceremonies, they a∣greed
to travel early in the Morning to the <HI>Gil∣ded
Branch,</HI> and having related to each the
oddness of their Adventures, they accordingly
came to the Tree where it grew in the middle of
a Garden, whose Walks were bestrewed with
Pearl, and whose Flowers were all sorts of Di∣amonds
and precious Stones.</P>
<P>They no sooner approached, but the Prince
and Princess receiv'd their pristine Shapes; and
were so transported at it, Words could not
express their Joy. The Prince fell at the Feet of
the Princess, and was about to have worshipped
her, when Queen <HI>Benigna,</HI> and King <HI>Trasimenes</HI>
appear'd, with a Splendor which out-shone the
<PB N="140" REF="153"/>
Sun. They were attended by the Graces, and
a Million of Fairy Nymphs supporting a rich
Canopy over their Heads; the Zephirs▪ and all
the agreeable Deities of the Woods and Plains
made up the Company, with a Harmony equal
to that of the Spheres.</P>
<P>Here (said illustrious <HI>Benigna</HI> to the Prin∣cess)
take this constant Shepherd for your Hus∣band-Prince,
and be you happy in him; for he
is the same Prince your Father and his design'd
to bestow upon you. He did not perish in that
Castle where you was; but met with a Delive∣rance
and Change like Yours: With that she
Crown'd them both with imperial Diadems, but
much more with a Constant Tranquility, to
make them amends for all the Troubles they
had undergone.</P>
<P>The Nuptials were then order'd to be Cele∣brated,
and to make the Joy the greater, the
Fairy <HI>Benigna</HI> struck her Wand thrice, when
immediately the two Princesses who had perso∣nated
Mice, was restor'd to their proper Shapes,
as were also all those the Conjurer had inchant∣ed

from their Metamorphosis, but made happy in
the lasting Affections, and mutual Embraces of

<PB N="144" REF="157"/>
King immediately consented to the Proposal,
and he was call'd the beloved of his Father, he
was sent with a vast Retinue of the Nobility,
and a prodigious quantity of Riches.</P>
<P>They had not been long out of sight of Land,
but a dreadful Tempest arose, in which the
whole Navy immediately founder'd, and every
Soul was lost but himself, who floating on a
Plank, was driven ashore upon the very sam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Coast where the <HI>Ogricons</HI> liv'd.</P>
<P>The Princess by this time being grown <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

with some odd Characters on it, but of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>And thus she spent her absent Hours fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

to be gone, and that his Life was in dange<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<PB N="145" REF="158"/>
so that a meer Jargon of Language past be∣tween
them.</P>
<P>The Princess shed Tears, to think that he
would presently be torn to pieces, and the more
because she could not make him sensible of it.
At last she took him by the Hand, and led him
to her Cell in the Rocks, and made him repose
himself on a Bed of soft Rushes. She then took
her Hair-lace and gave it him, with Signs that
she was going to fetch some Food, and that she
would return again. The Prince had now time
to lament his Misfortune, but still the Idea of
his charming Deliverer, gave him more Con∣tent
than if he was in possession of a Crown.</P>
<P>The Princess by this time, was so heavy loa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en
with Provisions, she fainted at the Prince's
Feet. She had brought him roasted Squirrels,
Rabbets, all sorts of Fruit, a Stone Knife, a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovely Shell to drink out off, and another to
Wash in; all which the Prince receiv'd with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o many Testimonies of Affection, that their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouls became in a manner united. When
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Sigh'd, she Wept, and both shar'd equally
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ov and Sorrow, tho' she was the most con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ern'd
for his Preservation.</P>
<P>At Night she left him to return to <HI>Ravagio</HI>'s
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, the more to prevent Suspicion, but when
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he saw the monstrous young <HI>Ogriletto,</HI> to whom
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he was to be Married, her Heart was ready to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reak. She could not Sleep all the Night, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousand Thoughts disturb'd her Rest; so that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arly next Morning she went to the Prince's Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dence,
and there with Tears in her Eyes, by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l the Signs she could make, would have him
<PB N="146" REF="159"/>
flee the place for safety. He flung himself at he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Feet, and wiped them w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h his Hair, while sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
she presented him with her turquois Heart, as a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Token of her Esteem. The Prince kiss'd th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hand that gave it, and looking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon it ear∣nestly,
read the following Words.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The only Belozed, Daug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter to the King of the
Fortunate Island.</HEAD>
<P>The Surprize the Prince was in, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> read
it, was inexpressible. He knew such a Princess
was his Cousin, and that she had been drowned
many Years before. He lifted up his Eyes to
Heaven, concluding' the Sea had thrown up
so rich a Jewel. Then with Tears in his Eyes
he kist it, and ty'd the Heart about her Wri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
again, requesting by a certain Sign only a little
Lock of her Hair in the room on't, which sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with some difficulty granted.</P>
<P>Thus four Days run away, when the Princess
coming to <HI>Raxagio</HI>'s▪ Cave one Evening, she
found a Supper provided for her with all the
Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ities that could be got. She wonder'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Meaning; but <HI>Ravagio</HI> told her she must
be marry'd that Night to his Son <HI>Ogriletto,</HI> and
for that reason he had order'd so splendid an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Entertainment: The Princess immediately
trembled, and desir'd that it might be defer'd
a little longer? How! said the Monster, I
have a Mind to devour thee presently, at which
she fainted away between <HI>Termen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>na</HI> and her
Son's Paws: <HI>Ogriletto,</HI> 'tis true, lov'd her en∣tirely,
<PB N="147" REF="160"/>
so with much ado, <HI>Rav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> was persua∣ded
to save her that Night.</P>
<P>The Prince, by this time, was wholly devo∣ted
to her Command, and Love had made him
a perfect Slave in so little a Space, so that he
was ready to Dye, because he could not tho∣roughly
inform her of his Passion.</P>
<P>When she returned next Morning, she made
him to understand the Danger she was in, of
being matry'd to another.</P>
<P>At which she discover'd a visible Alteration
in his Countenance, he was ready to dye at her
Feet; being altogether a Stranger to the Coun∣try
where he was, and how to escape, he knew
not; which if he did, would be even Death to
him. The Princess was as much con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ern'd on
t'other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide, and with an equal Grief, they spent
the time in Sighs and Tears, 'till Night oblig'd
her retire from him.</P>
<P>In her way to the Cave, it being dark, she
had the mortification to tread upon a sharp
Thorn, which run thro' the Sole of her Foot,
insomuch that when she came home, the Pains
were so afflicting, in conjunction with her
Concern for the Prince, that she swooned away
several times.</P>
<P><HI>Ravagio, Tormentina,</HI> and <HI>Ogriletto,</HI> were all
troubled at the Misfortune, they pull'd out the
Thorn (b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t knew not of another in her Heart)
and laid some Herbs to the Wound, and put
her to Bed. But Sleep she could not, nor could
she go as usual in the Morning to the Prince:
So that the Apprehensions of his breaking his
Heart for her absence, occasion'd a double Grief.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="161"/>
The Prince indeed was so much concern'd at
her not returning, that in Despairs he was re∣solved
to go in quest of her, tho' he lost his
Life. By the help of a rude Track, he travel'd
'till he came to the <HI>Ogrichon</HI>'s Den, which he no
sooner enter'd, but the Monster <HI>Ravagio</HI> snap'd
at him, and would have devour'd him, had not
the Princess fell down on her Knees, and in∣treated
him to keep that fresh Provision till her
Wedding-Day: <HI>Ravagio</HI> consented to it, order∣ing
her to feed and fatten him against the Day
appointed. But she did it with another Inten∣tion,
and it was with a design to preserve him
from Destruction; which in a little time she
thus effected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oger, Ogress,</HI> and <HI>Ogricons</HI> always sleep
with Crowns of Gold upon their Heads; and
the Princess lying with them, she thought with
herself, that Hunger was strong enough to
break thro' Stone Walls, and that if <HI>Ravagio's</HI>
Appetite should provoke him in the Night,
she did not know, but he might devour the
Prince, notwithstanding his Word to the con∣trary.
She therefore, when they were all asleep,
took the Crown from the Head of the first <HI>Ogri∣chon</HI>
she came to, and put it on the Prince's, and
return'd to her own Apartment.</P>
<P>This Project had its desired Effect. For <HI>Ra∣vagio</HI>
longing to make a Meal of the Prince,
arose in the dark, and felt for one among the
<HI>Ogrichons,</HI> without a Crown upon his Head,
whom having found he immediately devour'd,
and return'd to his <HI>Ogress</HI> who lay fast asleep.</P>
<P>The next Morning <HI>Tormentina</HI> missing one of
<PB N="149" REF="162"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Brats, she went to the Cavern, and percei∣ving
it Bloody, gave such a Howl, that all the
Woods rung with it. <HI>Ravagio</HI> presently heard
her, and being sensible of his Mistake, com∣manded
her to be silent; for that he had eaten
the little Monster instead of the Prince. <HI>Tor∣mentina</HI>
was forc'd to submit, for her Husband
was absolute, and one who could eat Wives
with as little Compassion as as any thing.</P>
<P>The next Night the Princess did as before;
when <HI>Tormentina</HI> awaking, was resolv'd to re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enge
the death of her Ogrichon on the Prince.
She went to the place where the Ogrichons lay,
and finding one without a Crown among 'em,
immediately eat it up, believing it to be the
S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nger, and returned to take her Sleep out.</P>
<P>As soon as Morning came, <HI>Tormentina</HI> went
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ok after her young <HI>Ogrichons,</HI> aud finding
tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she had by Mistake devour'd one of them,
she<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>scriem'd out so loud, that <HI>Ravagio</HI> immedi∣atey
came to her. They both gnash'd their
Te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, and storm'd in a fearful manner, and
re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding the Air with their Cries, they were for
de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouring the Prince and Princess, who had
hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves in a dark Corner from their
R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge.</P>
<P>In this Extremity, the Princess bethought
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erself of <HI>Tormentina</HI>'s Ivory Wand, with which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seen her perform many strange things.
Thought she, if such an ignorant Brute can
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ork Wonders with it, well may I; and so she
went where it was, and taking bold of it, wish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Name of the Fairy <HI>Trufio,</HI> to talk the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anguage of her distressed Lover.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="163"/>
This had its desir'd Success; so that she im∣mediately
went to the Prince, and whisper'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his Ear, That she was more afflicted at his Mis∣fortunes
than her own; and withal told him
how she came to understand his Language by
virtue▪ of an Ivory Wand. The over-joy'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Prince, with many Thanks, said, That sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was as dear to him as his Soul, and that no∣thing
but Death should separate his Affection
from her.</P>
<P>In short, they had the Satisfaction of a Con∣versation
with one another, which none bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

that of their Escape was the most co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si∣derable.
The Princess told him, That as soon
as Night came, she would get <HI>Ravagio</HI>'s left
Camel, upon which they would both mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
and steer their Course where Providence should
direct. The Prince approv'd it, and the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣for

<P>Now, said she to the Prince, taking the Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
in her Hand; let's mount; which they did ac∣cordingly,
and rode away full speed.</P>
<P>The Ogr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss <HI>Tormentina,</HI> whilst they were ma∣king

the Bean, without your Wishing it: and being
by this time full roasted, said no more, not∣withstanding
the loud Calls <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>Tormentina.</HI></P>
<P>Early in the Morning, the <HI>Ogress</HI> went to pu∣nish
her for not coming at her Call; but alas!
She found both Prince and Princess fled; with
that she set up such a Howl, that <HI>Ravagio</HI> leap'd
in a Minute from his Cave, to know vvhat was
the Matter. With dismal Cries she told him
all his fresh Meat was stole away, which when
<HI>Ravagio</HI> heard, he tore his Beard, and swore he
would Revenge himself of the Rogues that had
done it. Give me my Seven League Boots, and
I'll be up with 'em presently. The Boots being
brought, away he vvent, and quickly came in
sight of the Prince and Princess.</P>
<P>The Princess perceiving him first, cry'd out▪
We are ruin'd, dear Prince, for the Monster i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

for her than himself, so that the thoughts
of her Danger pierc'd his very Soul.</P>
<P>A Woman's Wit being ready at Invention,

and in kind <HI>Trufi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s Name, turn our Beast into

an old Woman to rovv it along. The Wand
vvas no sooner vvav'd, but she had her Wish;
<PB N="152" REF="165"/>
when up came the Monster to the River's side▪
and cry'd, Ho! you, Gammar; did you see a
Man and a Maid go by this Bank-side? The
old Dame whipping on her Spectacles, star'd at
him, as if she knew nothing of the matter: At
last she pointed, and made him believe they
were gone by on the Left-hand. Away stalkt
<HI>Ravagio</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of sight, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opes to overtake
them. In the mean time the Princess touch'd
herself with her Wand, and resum'd her Shape.</P>
<P><HI>Ravagio</HI> having travel'd far to no purpose,
return'd to <HI>Tormentina,</HI> who impatiently expect∣ed
his coming. But when she saw him return
without them, she call'd him Fool, and laugh∣ed
at his Story about the old Woman, and her
Spectacles. Go back again, Simpleton, (<HI>cry'd

<P>The old Fool of a Monster liquoring his

Step would have been up with 'em, had not
the Princess, by virtue of her Wand, turn'd
their Camel into a Box, herself into a Dwarf,
and the Prince into a beautiful Picture. The
Dwarf seeing <HI>Ravagio,</HI> immediately blew his
Horn; at which the Monster came to him, and
ask'd if he had seen a young Couple go by that
way. The Dwarf told him, that a beautiful
Lady came by Yesterday, with a valiant Knight,
who had fought in Honour of her, whose Pict∣ure
hung before him; and that the Lady before
she went, charg'd him, That if an ill-look'd
Giant, with but one Eye in his Forehead,

should come and enquire about her, that he
should tell him to give over his Search, for that
she was for ever out of his reach.</P>
<P>Say you so, (said <HI>Ravagio</HI>) which Way did
they go? Over yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Plains, said the Dwarf▪
Away stalkt the Monster, and was out of sight
in an Instant. The Princess presently took her

were all in their proper Shapes again.</P>
<P><HI>Ravagio</HI> had gone all over the Woods, For∣rests,
Mountains, and Vallies, with incredible
swiftness, but was forced to return like a
Fool as he set out. He had indeed bundled up
a few half-hearted Lovers, that he met by the
Way, and deservedly carry'd them with him:
And 'twas well he did so; for <HI>Tormentina</HI>'s
Fury was grown so great, that if she had not
had something to stop her Mouth, perhaps she
might have devour'd him; for the gray Mare
was now become the better Horse: And such a
She-Fury, knowing her Husband's Weakness,
could easily have made the place too hot to
hold him.</P>
<P>We<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, having devour'd all he brought with∣out
so much as, 'Thank ye, Gaffer. Give me,
Coxcomb, <HI>said she,</HI> your Boots, and let me see
what I can do: I'll warrant thee, I'll soon find
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em out, and make an Example of them.</P>
<P>With that <HI>Ravagio</HI> for peace sake, let her put
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on his Boots, as she had oft done his Breeches,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd away the hagged Ogress went without a
Shift or Petticoat to her Breech, and stretcht the
Boo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a League farther than usual. She took
with her a monstrous Club, her Hair was pow-
<PB N="154" REF="167"/>
with Toads, and ty'd up with Snakes; so that
she was a Spectacle frightful enough to terrify
the most obdurate Heart.</P>
<P>Alas! her Motion was so swift, that in a few
Hours, the Princess saw her. Now was th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
grand Tryal of these Lovers: They invok'd th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Powers above to protect a Couple who could
have dy'd for the sake of each other. In th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
midst of this Extremity some good Fairy pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it into the Mind of the Princess, to make u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of her Wand once more. Come, my dearest
(<HI>said she</HI>) to the Prince, take Courage, all sha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<P>The Words were no sooner utter'd, but wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>At last the Hag was so nettled with the sma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rose up, and in despair soaming at the Mout<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

have restor'd herself to her Shape, but some P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sons,
<PB N="155" REF="168"/>
who by accident had been that way, had
carry'd with 'em ignorantly her white Wand.</P>
<P>This was a lamentable Surprize to them both.
They alike lamented their Misfortunes. The
Prince cry'd, Wo is me, that I should be thus
confin'd in a Tree! My pretty Bee, what shall
I do, if you fly me? Cannot you stay to live
upon the Blossoms I produce? My Leaves shall
be your Bed, and free you from the venomous
Spiders. Ah, cry'd she, Why suspectest thou
thy Bee? No Dove shall be more truer to her
Mate. I will Watch thee, and Preserve thee
from the rude Touches of an unkind Hand.
All the Lillies, Jessamines, and Roses, and the
sweetest Flowers of the Woods and Plains, I
will slight for thee, and as a Proof of it, here I
will dwell, said she. With that she settled up∣on
one of the largest Flowers, and blest herself
with so sweet a Living, whilst the Tree flou∣rish'd,
and lookt gay and lively.</P>
<P>It seems this Orange Tree stood in a Wood
belonging to a certain Lady nam'd <HI>Linda,</HI> who
coming with her Maids that way, vvas so smit∣ten
with its Delicacy, she stood a considera∣ble
time admiring it. She could not imagin
how it came there; and willing to gather a
Flower, she no sooner touch'd it, but the B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
flew upon her Hand, and stung her so that she
was ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> away with the smart. She
then caus'd it to be remov'd by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and
planted it in a pleasant Garden next her Cham∣ber
Window, whither the Bee accompanied it.
They had not been there long, but the Orange
Tree ask'd his beloved Bee, Why he stung the
<PB N="156" REF="169"/>
beautiful <HI>Linda:</HI> Because said the Bee smartly,
your Sweetness is mine, and you cannot bestow
it on another, without Injustice to me. Be∣sides,
whatever you have is mine, and I am
bound to defend my own. But, reply'd the
Prince, can you let them drop without Con∣cern,
and not suffer the lovely <HI>Linda</HI> to wear
them in her Bosome? Yes, (<HI>said she</HI>) with a
severe Look, I can; but I find, Ingrateful, that
you can prefer a Lady in all her Gayety, to a
distressed, faithful, loving Princess, in a Tygers
Skin. And with this she wept excessively, and
let f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll her Tears upon many of the Flowers, at
which the Tree was so sensibly touch'd, that
his Grief for afflicting her, had like to have
made him wither away. Ah, cry'd he, you
raise these Jealousies only to excuse your leav∣ing
me! What have I said or done, to incu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
your Displeasure? And thus they controvert∣ed
all Night, as true Lovers will, 'till the Ze∣phyrs,
who ow'd them a Kindness, came and
reconciled them.</P>
<P>The next Morning, nothing would satisfy
<HI>Linda,</HI> but a Nose-Gay of Flowers from the
Orange-Tree; she often attempted to gather
them, but the Bee as often stung her. At last,
by the Advice of her Maids, she drest herself in
Armour, and with Trumpets sounding, went
with her Sword drawn to the Tree, and with
one stroke cut off a Branch; at which a great
Groan was heard, and a vast quantity of Blood
seen to fall on the Ground. The surprize must
needs be great to <HI>Linda,</HI> who attempted after∣wards
to join it together again, but in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="170"/>
The poor Bee was so frightned at this Sight,
that she was ready to expose her own Life for
his; and fearing that he might Bleed to Death,
by instinct of Nature (having his leave) flew
instantly to <HI>Arabia,</HI> and brought back on her
nimble Wings and Feet, a precious Balsam,
with which she daily dress'd and cured his
Wound.</P>
<P>The passionate <HI>Linda</HI> was so terrify'd at this
Transaction, that her Rest went from her. She
could not be satisfy'd, till the Mystery was un∣folded;
and therefore she sent far and near for
the most eminent Fairies in those parts, promi∣sing
them, that if they would vouchsafe her a
Visit, to bestow on them whatever they desir'd.
The generous Fairies never want Intreaties to
do good; so that away posted great numbers of
them to <HI>Linda</HI>'s Castle, where amongst the rest,
appeared the good Queen <HI>Trufio,</HI> being the
chiefest in the first Order of Fairies. She was
no sooner consulted, but she went to the Tree,
and by virtue of her Skill, turn'd it into one of
the most accomplish'd Princes in the World. At
this Sight, the astonish'd <HI>Linda</HI> forgot her for∣mer
Aversion for the Sex, and entertain'd a
Passion for him.</P>
<P>But the Prince falling at <HI>Truffio</HI>'s Feet, re∣turn'd
her a thousand Thanks, and beg'd that
his Happiness might be compleat, by having
his lovely Bee, which was his Life and Soul,
restor'd to him in her proper Shape. It shall
be done said the generous Fairy, and giving
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Word, the Princess appear'd with all her
<PB N="158" REF="171"/>
usual Charms and Lustre, insomuch that every
Lady then present envy'd her Happiness.</P>
<P>When <HI>Liuda</HI> saw this, her Reason put a stop
to a Passion she so newly entertain'd. She for∣got
it, and fell to embracing the Prince and
Princess, who at the Request of <HI>Truffio,</HI> had in∣form'd
her of all that had happen'd to them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and particularly of the Wonders they had per∣form'd,
by Virtue of the Name of <HI>Truffio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
and her Wand.</P>
<P>The Pleasure the Fairy took to hear hersel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
so respectfully spoke of, oblig'd her to do some∣thing
extraordinary for them; and which
should for ever set them above the Frowns o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Fate.</P>
<P>She took her leave of <HI>Linda,</HI> gave her th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Gift of Faryism, and with a thousand Embra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ces,
