<HEAD>A
MEMORIAL

NOBILITY
OF
SCOTLAND, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF Heaven shall be pleased to open your Ears to the Humble
and Sincere Application made to you in these Sheets in behalf
of this miserably Divided Nation; your Lordships will let it be
no Obstruction to the Benefit you may receive from it, that
it comes from an Unknown or Inferiour Hand.</P>
<P>Let the Author be who he will, or what he will, your Lordships
will be obliged to allow him to be a Friend to your Persons, to
Truth, and to the Interest of <HI>Scotland,</HI> since no Man can be a Friend
to either, that does not to his utmost pursue the great End proposed
here, which is the publick Good and Peace of this Countrey.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
This Paper is Address'd to your Lordships in your Double Capa∣city,
1. As Noblemen of <HI>Scotland.</HI> 2. As Peers of <HI>Britain▪</HI> As the
first, 'tis presumed you are all Inspired with Compassion for your
Native Countrey, with Zeal for her Interest, with Concern for her
Misfortunes, and with sincere affectionate Desires for her Recove∣ry.</P>
<P>As Peers of <HI>Britain,</HI> you are Embark'd in the general Good of the
United Kingdom, you have her whole Politick Constitution and
Capacity upon your Heads, are equally Patriots for one Part as for the
other.</P>
<P>It is no matter who were for, or against the Union, that comes
not in Consideration now, whoever was against it, or whoever was
for it; you are all now equally concerned to keep it Sacred, and to
make it an Advantage, which, without yoar Lordships Concurrence
can never be done.</P>
<P>It would be a Charge too heavy, and what these Sheets shall not
so much as suggest of such Honourable Persons as your Lordships,
tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any of your Body should retain such Aversions to the Union, as to
endeavour to make it produce all the Evils they formerly predicted of
it.</P>
<P>Time, My Lords, and Gods Providence has already concurred to
make the Union a mean of Deliverance to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and it is very
remarkable that God has brought this Nation to a kind of a Necessity
of giving Him publick Thanks for the UNION; the Thanksgiving
on the third of <HI>June</HI> being in its Nature no less, as it was a Thanks∣giving
for a Mercy received by the Agency of that Nation you are
United to, and Effected as a Consequence of the Union, by virtue
of which only <HI>England</HI> became obliged at their own Expence to rescue
you out of the Hands of Popery and Tyranny, from which it is
manifest <HI>Scotland</HI> could by no means have Delivered her self.</P>
<P>Those that say this Merits no Thanks either to <HI>England,</HI> or to the
Union, and renounce the Obligation or Sense of Kindness, because
<HI>England,</HI> had been obliged to do it for her own <HI>Safety,</HI> seem like the
Ungratful Wretch, that when his House was on Fire, would give no
Thanks to his Neighbour that put it out, because his own Interest
obliged him to do it, to save his own House which was next.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
It is out of Doubt that the Care and Concern <HI>England</HI> shew'd for
the Danger of <HI>Scotland</HI> on this Occasion was an Effect of the Union,
and therefore your Thanksgiving for the seasonable Deliverance you
received is in one Sence, a giving Thanks for the Union—; And
may Heaven go on to give this Nation constant Occasion to give Him
Praise for the Effects of the Union, till in meer Sense of their own
Interest they are entirely Reconciled to it as the only Mean, under
God, of the Nations Safety and Prosperity—. But this by the
way.</P>
<P>But in order to bring the Design of this Paper down to your
Lordships immediate Contemplation, your Lordships are most humbly
intreated to look a little into, and consider the present State of your
Native Countrey, and perhaps by this your Lordships may be helped
to see how much it is in your Lordships Power, and must of Necessity
be your undoubted Duty to promote its Settlement and Prosperi∣ty.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland,</HI> My Lords, Promised her self, and many of your Lord∣ships
in your Thoughts Promised your selves for her a great many
Advantages from the Union; It would be an unpleasant Contem∣plation
to offer to your Lordships, that the Disappointment of all the
good Things <HI>Scotland</HI> might Expect from the Union should ly at the
Door of her Nobility, the Sons of her Triumph, which are her
Boast and her Glory, some of whom were the very Means of making
this very Union, and without whom it had never been brought to
Perfection.</P>
<P>And yet so it is, and so it will appear to be, unless your Lordships
shall in time Consider the State of your Countrey, listen to its Groans,
hear the Voice of its Circumstances, and immediately Apply your
selves to the proper Remedies.</P>
<P>We were told indeed one thing against the Union, which it is but
too apparent proves True, tho' differently from the Thoughts of those
that Suggested it, <HI>viz.</HI> That we should be Insected with the Contagion
of <HI>Englands Vices,</HI> and so if we should partake of her Wealth, we should
also partake of her Crimes.</P>
<P>Thus far this is come to pass, to the inexpressible Grief of all good
Men, that we have been and are affected with the Contagion of
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<HI>Englands</HI> Divisions, the Poyson of Partie Strife is already spread from
thence upon us; and if your Lordships do not apply your selves to an
immediat cure for this Mallady, the Leprosie of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibery and Corrupti∣on
will get into the Walls of the Building, and will never be cured
till the very House (I mean the Constitution) be pull'd down to the
very Foundation.</P>
<P>To explain this, it is necessary to enter a little into the Causes and
Nature of our present Politicks, and see if the evil Spirit that is gone
out among us, be not a Spirit of Destruction, and that aims at all sorts
of National Confusions.</P>
<P>From whence come Strife and Divisions among you, <HI>says the Text,</HI>
come they not from your Lusts? Lust of Rule, Lust of Ambition, Pride
and Covetousness; are not these the Ground of our fatal Divisions;
and how unhappy is it to see this Strife nowhere so fixt, as among our
Nooles, who are the Guardians of our Peace, and should be the Dis∣couragers
of all our Divisions.</P>
<P>It is in vain to flatter your Lordships Characters, and pay Homage to
your Titles; but to speak plain, is to speak honestly, if these wretch∣ed
Divisions begin among the Nobility, and from thence spread over
this Nation, the Nobility then will have the Fame, (if such it can be
counted,) of being their Countrys destroyers.</P>
<P>For GOD's sake then my Lords, and for your Countrys sake, for
the sake of your Families, your Religion and your Posterity be pleas∣ed
but to look into the present State of the Divisions of your Countrey,
and when you do this Impartially; if you do not see, that you alone
are the Cause of all this Distraction, you will at least see, that it is in
your Power alone to cure it: And how your Lordships will answer it
to your Honour, to your Consciences, to your Sons, and to your
MAKER; That having it in your Power to save your Countrey from
these miserable Confusions you neglected it, is enough to make you
tremble to think on.</P>
<P>Among the Illustrious Appearance that are now to assem∣ble,
a great many are come from <HI>England;</HI> what Spirit they carried
up, and what they bring down, is very melancholly to reflect on;
They went up united, they come down divided; They went up with
Zeal and Love to their Countrey which they had united, they come
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
down possest with Party. D—'Is that was against their Countrys
Peace; They went up uniting this Kingdom with its Neighbours, they
come down dividing it against it self—: What my Lords has <HI>England</HI>
done to you, or what have you done to one another? Where is the
Spirit and the Zeal with which the Union was carried on here amids the
Clamours of your Common Enemy? And what Condition shall this
Countrey be in to defend it self against the Powerful Enemies of the
Union both at Home and Abroad, if our Nobility who were the Life
and Soul of the Union forsake the very first Principle of Union in Ge∣neral,
<HI>viz.</HI> to unite one with another.</P>
<P>When your Lordships were fixing and finishing the great Affair of
the Union, what noble Speeches came from your Mouths! And well
we hoped, my Lords, they came from your Hearts, encouraging Uni∣on,
perswading the People to imbrace Union, applauding Union it
self as a Vertue, and the Union of <HI>Britain</HI> as an Honour and Advan∣tage:
Is it possible the same Age that saw your Lordships so Zealous
for Union, should see the same Noble Advocats of Peace divided into
formidable Squadrons, fighting with the worst sort of Weapons against
their Country? For all sorts of Divisions among your Lordships, are
Wars raised against your Countreys Good.</P>
<P>And how weak are the Pretences of this Party-Struggle, and what
is aim'd at in the Strife? The Good of our Countrey, as it is the
specious Pretence of all publick Actions, so is it here: But will your
Lordships be pleased to consider, The publick Good is always to be
pursued by proper and suitable Methods. Peace is attained best in
peaceable Methods. <HI>Pax quaeritur Bello</HI> is a Motto fit for Men in Arms;
but in Councils, in Government, in Parliaments, it is the Men of
Peace only, and Methods of Peace that can produce Peace. Where
there is Strife and Contention, there is every evil Work: And it is
impossible such Confusions of Interests, and Jarring of Parties as is now
seen among us, can procure Peace, or be for the Countreys
Good.</P>
<P>If it were sufficient to say we aim'd at the publick Good, then all
Actions would be sanctified by that Cover: Even the <HI>French</HI> Invasion,
my Lords, was so for the publick Good; and the worst Baits the De∣vil
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
lays to in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nare Men and Nations, are gilded over with that glitter∣ing
Shew.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, will your Lordships be pleased to listen to a yet supe∣rior
Instructor, whose Words have hitherto been Oracles to this
whole Island: When Her Majesty pass'd the Bill for an Union of
the two Kingdoms, you have Her Royal Instructions to all Her
loving Subjects, to Unite with one another, as the only Bond of
Peace, and as the only Safety and Happiness of the Na∣tion.</P>
<P>But from general Exhortations to Peace, your Lordships are in∣treated
to look into the scandalous Trifles which are the Subject of the
present Division, <HI>viz.</HI> Who shall or shall not be sent up to serve their
Countrey in Parliament. And, in this Case, my Lords, it is most just
to call it Scandalous and a Trifle.</P>
<P>Not that it is a Trifle, the sending Good, and Wise, and Honest
Members to Parliament; But, my Lords, it is but a Trifle of Diffe∣rence,
which Party those Good, Wise and Honest Men shall be chosen
out of; especially if we compare the Thing with the terrible Divisi∣on
it is now setting on Foot in this Nation.</P>
<P>And as for being Scandalous, ti's hoped your Lordships will pardon
the Courseness of the Term, since it is impossible to give it any other
that would be apposite and suited to the thing, while it gives but too
just Ground to the People to suggest. That there must be some other
End, than the mee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Serving <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the eager Desire which ap∣pears
in some Gentlemen, to be chosen for her Representatives. It is a
most undoubted Truth, and your Lordships will bear with the Plain∣ness
of Laying it down.</P>
<P>That whoever he is, that seeks or endeavours to be Elected a Mem∣ber
of Parliament, whether Peer or Commoner, for any other Rea∣son,
or with any other Design, than the Service and Good of his
Countrey, so far betrays his Countrey, and the Trust reposed in him
by his Countrey.</P>
<P>It is a most scandalous Reflection upon the Honour and Character of
your Lordships, and all the Representative Body of <HI>Scotland,</HI> let them
be of what Squadron they will, That it should be suggested, any Men,
or Party of Men among your Illustrious Body, should have any
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
private Ends to seek in the honest Pursuit now made, of being
Elected.</P>
<P>It cannot but be your Lordships Concern, therefore, to shew your
Resentment at such ill Treatment, and at its Authors: But above all,
to clear your Conduct from so much as the Shadow of such a Crime—,
Not, my Lords, that it is a Crime to serve your Prince, but 'tis a
Crime of the worst <HI>Nature,</HI> to seek to obtain what should be only the
Reward of your Merit and Capacities, from a certain formidable Ap∣pearance,
made by Strength of Party, not Merit; as if this or that
Party had such or such a superior Influence on their Countrey, and
therefore the Men must be imploy'd, lest they should <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—</P>
<P>My Lords, this Paper forbears to enter into the unhappy <HI>Et Cetera</HI>'s
of this Argument, lest the Nakedness of some Mens Conduct should
appear; which, in Hopes of their Amendment, and in Concern for
their Reputation, are concealed.</P>
<P>If, my Lords, there are such pernicious Politicks now on Foot a∣mong
you, and Men are forming themselves into Parties, in Affairs
of this Moment, in order to get themselves into, or to keep them∣selves
in Preferment, Imployments and Trusts in the publick Ad∣ministration;
'Tis a sad Token of their wanting Principles to <HI>discharge
those Imployments,</HI> when they so far mortgage their Principles to obtain
them.</P>
<P>For what Coherence, my Lords, have Places and Preferments,
Pensions and Salaries under the Crown, or Advancement at Court,
with Representing your Countrey in Parliament? It is true, we have
a Court and a Queen that will not bribe her Subjects, to betray their Coun∣trey,
nor suffer them to do it when they would; but it has not always
been so, nor may it ever be so, and therefore it has been a long Struggle
in the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> to render Employment from the Court
and Representatives in Parliament, inconsistent with one another—.
But <HI>be that as it will,</HI> this is certain, tho they may have an honest Cohe∣rence
with one another, they can have no honest Dependance upon
one another. And therefore it is a most unsufferable Slander on your
Lordships, to say that this Struggle is with any Design of serving your
selves, or of recommending this or that Party <HI>to the Government,</HI> as of
Superior Interest in <HI>Scotland;</HI> if this were your Design, it would brand
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
your Lordships Characters and Families with a Crime too infamous to
name, nay it wold reproach the Queen her self and her Administrati∣on,
as if her Majesty would be aw'd to bestow her Favours, or commit
her Trust to ANY PARTY that appears formidable enough to carry the
Election among the Peers.</P>
<P>Far be it from the Design of this Paper to suggest such a thing of so
Honourable, so Illustrious a Body as the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it cannot
be, that a Thought so mean either of her Majesty or of her Admini∣stration,
can enter into your Hearts, and if it should, you may be told
without any Indecency, and much more without pretending to prophe∣cie
that your Lordships will be mistaken.</P>
<P>Her Majesty has all along shewed in the placing and displacing Men
and Partys such a steadiness of Resolution, and such a clearness of Judg∣ment,
that it is not to be feared on one hand, or hoped on the other,
that appearance of Faces only shall be a Key to her Favours, or Num∣bers
of Names, and Strength of Party open or shut the Door to the Pow∣er
of Administration: And therefore any Man whose Eyes are in his
head, may acquaint your Lordships that this is not the way to obtain
that End.</P>
<P>But my Lords, it cannot be unseasonable to remind your Lordships
how publickly such Slanders are raised, how industriously spread, and
how openly your Lordships Honour is insulted with such things as these,
as if the gaining Places and Imployments at Court were the only thing,
aimed at, and it must be wholsom Advice to your Lordships, let it
come from never so mean a hand, that your Lordships would be pleas∣ed
so to guard your Conduct, as to give no room for such vile Suggesti∣ons,
that Posterity may know the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> are not capable of
any thing so low, so mean, so much under their Dignity and Chara∣cter
in the World.</P>
<P>My Lords, the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> never wanted Merit to recom∣mend
them to their Princes Service, and to advance them both at
Home▪ and Abroad; and to form Parties to obtain Places at the Price
of the dividing and subdividing their Countrey, is a thing so mean,
that it first supposes they wanted Merit otherways to recommend them,
or that their Sovereign dispensed her Favours by appeareance, and un∣der
the Aw of Parties, and not by the light of her Judgment, and the
Merit of the Persons.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
It is no hard matter my Lords to propose a general Unity and Con∣cord
in this great Matter now before your Lordships, as the only way
to preserve your Lordships and your Countrey from Ruine; but it is
harder to propose a particular Method how to crush this Monster,
this Infant Hydra, this wicked Spirit of Party-making just now crept
into this Kingdom—. It is called a Spirit now crept in; not that
the World is ignorant of your former Divisions which in their Degree
have been pernitious enough, but the present Flood of ill Practices
which is broke in upon the Nations Peace, is but new, and may re∣ceive
a Check from your Lordships, if it be taken now before the
Breach, at which it comes in, grows too wide to be made up.</P>
<P>The Design however of this Address is not to croud your Thoughts
with Schemes of Elections, and form uniting Projects among your Lord∣ships,
if your Eyes were open to the dangerous Consequence of the
present Divisions, you would always apply your selves to the proper re∣medies,
without any bodies Advice. Could you but see how this Me∣thod
assures you of the certainty of their planting eternal Feuds and
Animosities among you as a Nation, and among your Families as No∣blemen
or Gentlemen, ever rivalling, ever undermining one another,
could you be made sensible of the Consequences of these things to
your Children and to the Government, how by strength of Parties some
of the Nobility may for ever be excluded from the Honour of sitting in
Parliament, a Priviledge born with them, and which they may have
done nothing to forefeit; how this will rouze the retired Families of the
Nobility, and make them ever be pushing at, and forming Parties for
Elections, and how it will entail Family Grudge, personal Peike, and
Party-quarrels on our Posterity, handing down Mischief, and convey∣ing
rancour'd Blood from Generation to Generation, when your Lord∣ships
Eyes are open to these things, and you shall come but to give your
selves leisure to consider them, your Lordships might be left to find out
the easy Remedy for such fatal Mischiefs, you could not but apply
your selves to it, for they are really Mines filled with all manner of
Combustibles, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust ready to be sprung, and to blow up the very Foun∣dation
of this Nations Felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
And now my Lords, not to enter upon Methods of Election, or al∣tering
the Scheme directed by Parliament, yet 'tis humbly left upon your
Lordships Thoughts to consider of as a Medium to preserve your Lord∣ships
and your Posterity in Peace and Amity among your selves, and
prevent the mortal Contagion of Party-strife spreading it self over this
Nation, to the Ruine of your Honour, your Peace, and your Posterity,
whether this Election might not be carried on without the Breach a∣mong
your Lordships, which all Wise Men foresee, and all Good
Men are grieved for.</P>
<P>Ballot has been thought of as a Medium to prevent the particular
Peikes and Feuds, which from the various Sidings of Families and Inte∣rests
may be too frequent among the Nobility, since in the Balloting
it cannot be known (other than Men will discover themselves) who any
Man gives his Vote for: But then again this will not at all put a stop
to the Sollicitations and Struggle of Parties among us, which is the
Root of all the other Mischiefs, and will be always a teeming Brooder
of unforeseen Evils among us.</P>
<P>Rotation has been rejected in Parliament, and as it would be a Me∣thod
to which your Lordships would be tied down by Law, and from
which you could upon no Consideration whatever recede, it is not
without its Inconveniences, and is not altogether consistent with the
Nature of a Free Representative.</P>
<P>But might it not be worth your Lordships while to consider, whe∣ther
such a thing as a voluntar Rotation might not be form'd by Con∣sent,
and in time obtain by Custom, so as to be the receiv'd Method
of Elections, reserving still the Right of breaking in upon it, tho not
to practise it but in extraordinary Cases—. This my Lords is a
sort proposal, but it is full of various Advantages to your Countrey, to
the Nobility as a Body, and to the particular Families of the Nobility
as Peers, and it will be very difficult to find out one Inconvenience
that can be charged upon it, Nor can any thing be objected against
it, but that perhaps your Lordships will say the Proposal comes <HI>too
late,</HI> and it is otherways determined.</P>
<P>1. My Lords, by this method all the Nobility in <HI>Scotland</HI> who
are legally qualified, will, <HI>or may if they please,</HI> enjoy their Right
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
of sitting in Parliament, and so the Union not be reproacht with
taking away their Birth-right.</P>
<P>2. Your Lordships will be made Judges among your selves of
personal Merit, and may reject any Nobleman who has rendred
himself unworthy of the Honour of representing you; and tho
upon none but extraordinary Occasions, such Distinctions will
be made, yet your Lordships would be Judges of these Extraordi∣nary
Occasions.</P>
<P>3.This unhappy Party-struggle among you would immediatly
die, and be forgotten, you would have no more Squadrons of
Parties formed against one another, labouring to engross the
Votes of their Inferiors, to purchase the Smiles of their Superi∣or,
all the Bribery and Corruption, which if it be not yet come
in, will of course follow these Proceedings, must of course be left
off; all the Fury of Parties will die, the Fire of Contention go
out, and the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> will be delivered from a new In∣fection;
which if it be once spread among them, will in time de∣bauch
their Principles, and render their Persons contemptible.</P>
<P>The World, my Lords, is not without Examples of this kind; and
tho many might be produced, yet two are so Eminent, and so near
your Lordships, that they will be most familiar to your Thoughts.</P>
<P>The Parliaments of <HI>England,</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of <HI>Britain</HI> now, (by
Consequence of the Union) have an undoubted Right to limit the Suc∣cession,
and transpose the Right of Ascending to the Throne of this
Island; and this being established in both Kingdoms in their separate
State by particular Declarations, besides Precedents, it may pass for a
Maxim here, without requiring further Confirmation.</P>
<P>Now, tho the several Qualifications which the Law requires, may
incapacitat any person to govern, who otherways had the Right of
primogeniture▪ as in the Case of the Abdication of the late King and the
descending to his Children being both suspected, and also Popish; and tho'
the Parliament have an absolute power to declare and determine this or
that person to be Successor or Heir apparent; yet when Circumstances
have put them off from one Branch or another, they have always kept
the Line in view, and still reserving the Right of naming the Succes∣sor,
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
they have always gone to the next in Blood, against whom no le∣gal
Exception has lyen.</P>
<P>A second Instance is in the Election of the Lord Mayor of the City
of <HI>London,</HI> which is thus, the Common Hall, <HI>that is,</HI> the Suffrages of
all the Livery-men or Burgesses of the City, is required to choose two
Men out of the Court of Aldermen to be Lord Mayor; these when by
the Majority of the Electors they are chosen, are returned to the Court
of Aldermen.</P>
<P>The Court of Aldermen is obliged to name one of these two as Lord
Mayor for the Year ensuing, it is absolutely in the Breast of the Alder∣men
to take which of the two they please; and sometimes as they see
occasion, they do break into their Custom, and choose out of their
usual Method, but generally speaking, and unless some extraordinary
Case interveen, they choose the Senior Alderman, or as they call it, he
that is next the Chair.</P>
<P>Both these examples its presumed are exactly to the Case—, and
prove that the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> may in this Election observe a volun∣tary
Rotation, and take their whole Body in its Course, either begin∣ning
at the Eldest or Highest, down to the Youngest or Lowest of the
Nobility, or one of the Highest, one of the lowest; and yet ly under no
other Obligation to confine themselves to it than the Court of Alder∣men
do in choosing the person next the Chair.</P>
<P>If any Nobleman by reason of his Circumstances, either of Health or
Estate, found it not for his Convenience, his Absence from the Assem∣bly
might determine it, since it were easy to resolve to choose none
but such as were present, or such as sent their Names, desiring to be
esteemed as present.</P>
<P>O how would this at one Blow overwhelm all the Schemes and Pro∣jects
of the present Squadrons of Separation! how would it remove all
the ill Blood the Poison and Rancor that is breaking in upon Families.
How would it establish the Peace and Tranquillity of the Nobility of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> which by the other unhappy Divisions now on foot is like to
be perfectly destroyed and trampled under foot, even by its own Mem∣bers.
<HI>But alas!</HI> We are told already 'tis too late, <HI>the War is begun,</HI> and
no such Capitulation (<HI>the worse for Scotland still</HI>) can be hearkened
to.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
There is another Method, but what hopes is there to see it put in
practice! and what a happy, Nation would we be, if it could be
brought to pass! And this is that laying aside Parties and privat Designs!
the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> would act like themselves, and make their Ele∣ction
intirely free from any remote View of Interest or Prejudices, and
choosing Men of Capacity and Merit, as well as Nobility of Birth, seek
to raise and maintain the Reputation of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the House of Peers,
rather than the Reputation of Party, in the hopes of a share in the Spoils
of the Nation.</P>
<P>This would bring the Members of <HI>Scotland</HI> in either House into a Fi∣gure
suited to the Trust their Countrey has reposed in them, <HI>and this it is
not too late to do.</HI> But my Lords, when all is carried by Interest and Party,
Club and Cabal, when Whigs set up Torries against Whigs, and Tor∣ries
set up Whigs against Torries, what can this be? is this a Strife for
your Nation! is this a Struggle for the publick Good! is it not a meer
Strife for Mastery, and the Heavings of two Mighty Parties, who push
their secret Designs, and have something else besides the Good of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
in their Vew?</P>
<P>And what will be the Consequences of these things? GOD Almigh∣ty
only knows what National Mischiefs His Goodness will prevent,
which would otherways be the Effect of such Division<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ but it
would be very satisfactory to many that wish well to <HI>Scotland,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome
body that sees farther than ordinary into such things would clear up
some of these Doubts about them.</P>
<P>1 <HI>st.</HI> Whether this will not in its nature tend, <HI>Not</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> breaking
or intirely dissolving the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> as a Body <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that can
hardly be possible, tho the Scripture says, A House <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against
it self cannot stand: But to the lessening their Characters, rendring them
contemptible in the Eyes of the World, and particularly of Honest
Men; as men who have abandoned all Concern for their Countrey,
are acted only by their Private Interests, and Pursue▪ nothing but the
Game of Preferment and Partys, and by Consequence are not to
be valued, trusted, or depended upon.</P>
<P>2. Whether this will not oblige the Queen in meer Defence of her
Majesties Character <HI>as to discerning,</HI> and to let her Subjects know,
that Names, Numbers, and a shew of Party-Strength, cannot aw or
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
byass her Judgment in the Choice of her Servants, to contemn all
Parties that so openly pursue such a Game, under Colour of the Ser∣vice
of their Countrey, &amp; resolve to imploy NONE of them, be their
fancied Success never so great, except such as their personal Merit
and different Conduct shall recommend: And if her Majesty has ta∣ken
up such Resolutions already, whether all the World does not ju∣stifie
her Royal Prudence in it, and applaud both her Majesties Wis∣dom
and Resolution.</P>
<P>3. Whether the Animosities this Party-Struggle lays the Foundati∣on
of, and which it is, apparent will be at least triennally renewed,
do not weaken <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular, lay her open to Foreign Ene∣mies,
disable her People in the general Defence of the Government,
and may not in time be run up to such a height as may be dangerous
to the publick Peace—; and thus she shall be rendered contemp∣tible
on one hand, and suspected on the other, and be constantly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bjected to the insult of a Foreign Enemie, that would gladly over∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hesm
both Parties.</P>
<P>Thus my Lords, not the Ruine of your own Characters, the blasting
the Honour of the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and rendring even the Repre∣sentatives
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou shall choose contemptible in the Eyes of the World; not

and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and perhaps at last to Destruction, may be in the Womb
of this present Contention—. And it cannot be doubted, but if your
