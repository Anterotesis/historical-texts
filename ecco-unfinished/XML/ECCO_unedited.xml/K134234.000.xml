<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we see an unprincipled, shameless bully, <Q>“A dog in fore∣head, ”and in heart a deer," who endea∣vours, by means of a big look, a threat∣ening aspect, and a thundering voice, to terrify peaceable men into a compliance with what he has neither a right to de∣mand, nor power nor courage to enforce, and who, at the same time, acts in such a bungling, stupid manner, as to excite ridi∣cule and contempt in place of fear; when we see such a gasconading, impudent bluff as this (and that we do every day), we call him a <HI>Blunderbuss</HI>.</Q> But, the reader
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
will not, I hope, have conceived me so devoid of all decency and prudence, as to imagine, even for a moment, that it is in this degrading sense that the name of <HI>Blun∣derbuss</HI> has been given to the invaluable col∣lection which I here present to the public. <Q>Indeed, it is so evident that I could mean no such thing, that this declaration seems hardly necessary; but, as my poor old grand∣mother used to say, “a burnt child dreads ”the fire," and after the unrelenting se∣verities of misconception and misconstruc∣tion, that a humane and commiserating public have so often seen me endure, they will think it very natural for me to fear, that what I really intended as a compli∣ment, would, if left unexplained, be tor∣tured into insult and abuse, if not into the horrid crime of leze republicanism, at the very idea of which my hair stands on end and my heart dies within me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"But," cry the Democrats, “in what sense then do you apply the word <HI>Blun∣derbuss?</HI> Come, come, Mr. Peter, none ”of your shuffling."</Q>—Silence, you yelp∣ing devils; go growl in your dark kennel; slink into your straw, and leave me to my reader: I'll warrant I explain myself to his satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>Writings of a hostile nature are often me∣taphorically expressed, in proportion to the noise they make, by different instruments that act by explosion. Thus it is, for instance, that in impotent lampoon is called a <HI>Pop∣gun</HI>, and that a biting paragraph or epi∣gram, confined to a small circle, is termed a <HI>Squib;</HI> and thus it is, that, rising in due progression, the collection of CITIZEN ADET's Notes and Cockade Proclamation is denominated a <HI>Blunderbuss</HI>, a species of fire arms that exceeds all others, managea∣ble by a single hand, in the noise of its discharge.</P>
<P>If we pursue the metaphor, we shall find the application still more strikingly happy. The <HI>first Note</HI> is a kind of pre∣parative for the <HI>Cockade Proclamation</HI>, and this latter adjusts matters for the <HI>grand ex∣plosion;</HI> or, in the military style;

<P>To be sure we are not dead, but this circumstance, instead of mutilating my metaphor, renders it complete; for of all the long list of fire arms, none is so diffi∣cult
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
to adjust, or makes so much noise and smoke, with so little execution, as a <HI>Blun∣derbuss</HI>.</P>
<P>This is the first time, I believe, that a Preface ever turned its eyes backwards, and talked about the title till there was no room left to say a word about the book. Indeed, the book stands in little need of commendation, or of any thing else, ex∣cept what I am determined shortly to be∣stow on it, in a manner worthy of its merits.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Gros Mousqueton Diplomatique;</HI> OR DIPLOMATIC BLUNDERBUSS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The following note was published in Bache's Gazette of <HI>31</HI>st <HI>Oct. 1796</HI>, without the approbation or con∣sent of the American Government.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="subhead">AUTHENTIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE undersigned minister plenipotentiary of the French Republic, in conformity to the orders of his government, has the honour of trans∣mitting to the secretary of state of the United States, a resolution taken by the executive direc∣tory of the French Republic, on the 14th Messi∣dor, 4th year, relative to the conduct which the ships of war of the Republic are to hold towards neutral vessels. The flag of the Republic will treat the flag of neutrals in the same manner as they shall suffer it to be treated by the English.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>The sentiments which the American govern∣ment have manifested to the undersigned minister plenipotentiary, do not permit him to doubt, that they will see in its true light, this measure, as far as it may concern the United States, that it is dictated by imperious circumstances, and approv∣ed by justice.</P>
<P>Great Britain, during the war she has carried on against the Republic, has not ceased using eve∣ry means in her power to add to that scourge, scourges still more terrible. She has used the well known liberality of the French nation to the detriment of that nation. Knowing how faithful France has always been in the observance of her treaties—knowing that it was a principle of the Republic to respect the flag of all nations, the British government, from the beginning of the war, has caused neutral vessels, and in particular American vessels, to be detained, taking them in∣to their ports, and dragged from them French∣men and French property.—France, bound by a treaty with the United States, could find only a real disadvantage in the articles of that treaty, which caused to be respected as American pro∣perty, English property found on board American vessels. They had a right, under this consideration, to expect, that America would take steps in favour of her violated neutrality. One of the predecessors of the undersigned, in July 1793, applied on this subject to the government of the United States, but he was not successful. Nevertheless, the na∣tional convention, who by their decree of the 9th May, 1793, had ordered the seizure of enemy's property on board neutral vessels, declaring at the same time, that the measure should cease when the English should respect neutral flags, had ex∣cepted,
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
on the 23d of the same month, the Ame∣ricans from the operation of this general order. But the convention was obliged soon to repeal the law which contained this exception so favourable to Americans.—The manner in which the English conducted themselves—the manifest intentions they had to stop the exportation of provisions from America to France, rendered it unavoidable.</P>
<P>The national convention, by this, had restored the equilibrium of neutrality which England had destroyed—had discharged their duty in a manner justified by a thousand past examples, as well as by the necessity of the then existing moment. They might, therefore, to recal the orders they had given to seize enemy's property on board American vessels, have waited till the British go∣vernment had first definitively revoked the same order, a suspension only of which was produced by the embargo laid by congress the 26th of March, 1794. But as soon as they were inform∣ed, that, under orders of the government of the United States, Mr. Jay was directed to re∣monstrate against the vexatory measures of the English, they gave orders, by the law of the 13th Nivose, 3d year, to the ships of war of the Re∣public, to respect American vessels; and the committee of public safety, in their explanatory resolve, of the 14th of the same month, hastened to sanction the same principles. The national con∣vention and the committee of public safety had every reason to believe, that this open and liberal conduct would determine the United States to use every effort to put a stop to the vexations imposed upon their commerce, to the injury of the French Republic. They were deceived in this hope— and though the treaty of friendship, commerce,
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
and navigation, between Great Britain and the United States had been signed six weeks before France adopted the measure I have just spoken of, the English did not abandon the plan they had formed, and continued to stop and carry into their ports all American vessels bound to French ports, or returning from them.</P>
<P>This conduct was the subject of a note, which the undersigned addressed, on the 7th Vende∣maire, 4th year, [29th September, 1795, O. S.] to the secretary of state. The remonstrances which it contained, were founded on the duties of neutrality, upon the principles which Mr. Jefferson had laid down in his letter to Mr. Pinck∣ney, dated the 13th September, 1793. Yet this note has remained without an answer, though recalled to the remembrance of the secretary of state by a dispatch of the 9th Germinal, 4th year, [29th March, 1796, O. S.] and American vessels, bound to French ports, or returning from them, have still been seized by the English. Indeed more— they have added a new vexation to those they had already imposed upon Americans.—They have impressed seamen from on board American ves∣sels, and have thus found the means of strength∣ening their crews at the expense of the Ameri∣cans, without the government of the United States having made known to the undersigned the steps they had taken to obtain satisfaction for this violation of neutrality, so hurtful to the interests of France, as the undersigned had set forth in his dispatches to the secretary of state of the 9th Germinal, 4th year, [29th March, 1796, O. S.] 19th Germinal, [8th April, 1796,] and first Flo∣real, [20th April, 1796,] which have remained without an answer.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10"/>The French government, then, finds itself, with respect to America, at the present time, in circumstances similar to those of 1793; and if it sees itself obliged to abandon, with respect to them and neutral powers in general, the favoura∣ble line of conduct they had pursued, and to adopt different measures, the blame should fall upon the British government.—It is their conduct which the French government has been obliged to follow.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary con∣ceives it his duty to remark to the secretary of state, that the neutral governments of the allies of the Republic have nothing to fear as to the treatment of their flag by the French, since, if keeping within the bounds of their neutrality, they cause the rights of that neutrality to be re∣spected by the English, the Republic will respect them. But if through weakness, partiality or other motives, they should suffer the English to sport with that neutrality, and turn it to their ad∣vantage, could they then complain, when France, to restore the balance of neutrality to its equilibri∣um, shall act in the same manner as the English? No, certainly; for the neutrality of a nation con∣sists in granting to belligerent powers the same advantages, and that neutrality no longer exists, when, in the course of the war, that neutral na∣tion grants to one of the belligerent powers, ad∣vantages not stipulated by treaties anterior to the war, or suffers that power to seize upon them. The neutral government cannot then complain if the other belligerent power will enjoy advan∣tages which its enemy enjoys, or, if it seizes on them; otherwise that neutral government would
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
deviate, with respect to it, from the line of neu∣trality and would become its enemy.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary thinks it useless further to develope these principles. He does not doubt that the secretary of state feels all their force, and that the government of the United States will maintain from all violation a neutrality which France has always respected, and will always respect when her enemies do not make it turn to her detriment.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary em∣braces this opportunity of reiterating to the secre∣tary of state the assurances of his esteem, and in∣forms him, at the same time, that he will cause this note to be printed, in order to make publicly known the motives which, at the present juncture, influences the French Republic.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Department of State, <DATE>November 1st, 1796.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the re∣ceipt of your note of the 27th ult. covering a decree of the executive directory of the French Republic, concerning the commerce of neutral nations.</P>
<P>This decree makes no distinction between neu∣tral powers who can claim only the rights secured to them by the laws of nations, and others, be∣tween whom and the French Republic, treaties have imposed special obligations. Where no
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
treaties exist, the Republic by seizing and confis∣cating the property of their enemies found on board neutral vessels, would only exercise an acknowledged right under the law of nations. If towards such neutral nations, the French Repub∣lic has forborne to exercise this right, the forbear∣ance has been perfectly gratuitous. The United States by virtue of their treaty of commerce with France, stand on different ground.</P>
<P>In the year 1778, France voluntarily entered into a commercial treaty with us, on principles of perfect reciprocity, and expressly stipulating <HI>that free ships should make free goods</HI>. That is, if France should be at war with any nation with whom the United States should be at peace, the goods (except contraband) and the persons of her enemies (soldiers in actual service excepted) found on board the vessels of the United States, were to be free from capture. That, on the other hand, if the United States should engage in war with any nation, while France remained at peace, then the goods (except contraband) and the per∣sons of our enemies (soldiers in actual service excepted) found on board French vessels, were also to be free from capture. This is plainly expressed in the twenty-third article of that trea∣ty; and demonstrates that the reciprocity thereby stipulated, was to operate at <HI>different periods</HI>, that is, at one time in favour of one of the contract∣ing parties, and of the other at another time. At the present time, the United States being at peace, they possess, by the treaty, the right of carrying the goods of the enemies of France without sub∣jecting them to capture. But what do the spirit of the decree of the executive directory and the current of your observations require? That the
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
United States should now gratuitously renounce this right. And what reason is assigned for de∣nying to us the enjoyment of this right? Your own words furnish the answer. <Q>“France <HI>bound by treaty</HI> to the United States, <HI>could find only a real disadvantage</HI> in the articles of that treaty which caused to be respected as American pro∣perty, English property found on board Ame∣rican ”vessels."</Q>—This requisition, and the rea∣son assigned to support it, alike excite surprise. The American government, Sir, conscious of the purity of its intentions, of its impartial observ∣ance of the laws of neutrality, and of its invio∣lable regard to treaties, cannot, for a moment admit, that it has forfeited the right to claim a reciprocal observance of stipulations on the part of the French Republic; whose friendship more∣over, it has ever cultivated with perfect sincerity. This right, formerly infringed by a decree of the national convention, was recognised anew by the repeal of that decree. Why it should be again questioned, we are at a loss to determine. We are ignorant of any new restraints on our com∣merce by the British government; on the contra∣ry, we possess recent official information, <HI>that no new order has been issued</HI>. The captures made by the British, of American vessels having French pro∣perty on board, are warranted by the law of na∣tions. The force and operation of this law was contemplated by France and the United States, when they formed their treaty of commerce; and their special stipulation on this point was meant as an exception to an universal rule. Neither our weakness nor our strength, have any choice, when the question concerns the observance of a known rule of the law of nations.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>You are pleased to remark, that the conduct of Great Britain in capturing American vessels bound to and from French ports, had been the subject of a note, which on the 29th of Septem∣ber, 1793, you addressed to the secretary of state, but which remained without an answer. Very sufficient reasons may be assigned for the omissi∣on. The subject, in all its respects, had been already officially and publicly discussed, and the principles and ultimate measures of the United States, founded upon their indisputable rights, were as publicly fixed. But if the subject had not, by the previous discussions, been already exhausted, can it be a matter of surprise, that there should be a repugnance to answer a letter containing such insinuations as these?—<Q>“It must then be clear to every man, who will discard prejudices, love, hatred, and in a word, all the passions which lead the judgment astray, that the French Republic would have a right to complain, if the American government suffer∣ed the English to interrupt the commercial re∣lations, which exist between her and the Unit∣ed States; if by a <HI>perfidious condescension</HI>, it permitted the English to violate a right which it ought <HI>for its own honour and interest</HI> to defend; if under the <HI>cloak of neutrality</HI>, it presented to England a poignard to cut the throat of its faithful ally; if, in fine, <HI>partaking in the ty∣rannical and homicidal rage of Great Britain, it concurred</HI> to plunge the people of France ”into the horrors of famine."</Q> For the sake of preserving harmony, silence was preferred to a comment upon these insinuations.</P>
<P>You are also pleased to refer to your letters of March and April last, relative to impresses of
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
American seamen by British ships, and complain, that the government of the United States had not made known to you the steps they had taken to obtain satisfaction. This, Sir, was a matter, which concerned only that government. As an inde∣pendent nation, we were not bound to render an account to any other, of the measures we deemed proper for the protection of our own citizens; so long as there was not the slightest ground to suspect that the government ever acquiesced in any aggression.</P>
<P>But permit me to recur to the subject of the decree of the executive directory.</P>
<P>As before observed, we are officially informed, that the British government have issued no new or∣ders for capturing the vessels of the United States. <Q>We are also officially informed, that on the appear∣ance of the notification of that decree, the minister of the United States at Paris applied for informa∣tion “whether orders were issued for the seizure of neutral vessels; and was informed that no such order was issued, and further, that none such would be issued, in case the British did not ”seize our vessels."</Q> This communication from the minister of the United States at Paris to their minister in London, was dated <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8th of August. But the decree of the direc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bears date the 14th Messidor, answering to the second of July. These circumstances, together with some observa∣tions in your note, leave the American govern∣ment in a state of uncertainty of the real inten∣tions of the government of France. Allow me then to ask, whether, in the actual state of things, our commerce is considered as liable to suffer any new restrictions on the part of the French Repub∣lic? Whether the restraints now exercised by the
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
British government are considered as of a nature to justify a denial of those rights, which are pledged to us by our treaty with your nation? Whether orders have been actually given to the ships of war and privateers of the French Repub¦lic, to capture the vessels of the United States? And what, if they exist, are the precise terms of those orders?</P>
<P>These questions, Sir, you will see, are highly interesting to the United States. It is with ex∣treme concern, that the government finds itself reduced to the necessity of asking an explanation of this nature, and if it shall be informed, that a new line of conduct is to be adopted towards this country, on the ground of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> decree re∣ferred to, its surprise will equal its regret, that principles should now be questioned, which, after repeated discussions both here and in France, have been demonstrated to be founded, as we con∣ceive, on the obligations of impartial neutrality, of stipulations by treaty, and of the law of na∣tions.—I hope, Sir, you will find it convenient, by an early answer, to remove the suspense in which the government of the United States is now held on the questions above stated.</P>
<P>I shall close this letter by one remark on the singularity of your causing the publication of your note. As it concerned the United States, it was properly addressed to its government, to which alone pertained the right of communicat∣ing it, in such time and manner as it should think fit, to the citizens of the United States.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the dawn of our revolution, the tri∣coloured cockade has been the rallying point of those energetic men, whose generous efforts gave the first blows to arbitrary power. At their call, the French nation, bent for centuries under the yoke, shook off that long drowsiness, twenty-four millions of men adopted that august symbol, they exclaimed, "we shall be free," and all op∣position was defeated, and the throne tumbled down in the dust, and all Europe armed against them has been vanquished.</P>
<P>The Republic decorates all her citizens with those national colours, the sacre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> symbol of liber∣ty which they have won.</P>
<P>Frenchmen who are absent from their native land, ought not, amidst nations allied with theirs, to lay aside the distinctive mark which, by making them known, secures to them the protection and reciprocal respect guaranteed by our treaties with those nations.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19"/>Those who, from a guilty indifference, should slight that right, exempt themselves from that duty—those could lay no claim to that protection, they would renounce the support of the agents of the Republic. But, citizens, I am persuaded that at the call of the minister of the French Repub∣lic, you will hasten to put on the symbol of a liberty, which is the fruit of eight years toils and privations, and of five years victories.</P>
<P>Thus, you will draw a line of demarkation between you and those contemptible beings, whose unfeeling hearts are callous to the sacred name of native land, to the noble pride with which the freeman is animated by the sense of his indepen∣dence.</P>
<P>Thus, you will signalize those still more de∣graded beings, who being sold to the enemies of the Republic, drag from clime to clime, a life overwhelmed with misery and contempt—wretches whom history will not call to remembrance, ex∣cept to perpetuate their disgrace.</P>
<P>The use of the French chanceries, the national protection, will not be granted to any Frenchman but those, who, perfectly sensible of the dignity attached to the title of citizen, shall take a pride in wearing constantly the tri-coloured cockade. The executive directory of the French Republic have pronounced thus. Being the organ of their decisions, I communicate them with pleasure to my fellow-citizens. As for those who, although Frenchmen born, have ceased to be Frenchmen, I do not speak to them; the public voice will in∣form them of their exclusion.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Legation of Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<P>THE undersigned minister plenipotentiary of the French Republic, now fulfils to the se∣cretary of state of the United States, a painful but sacred duty. He claims, in the name of
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
American honour, in the name of the faith of treaties, the execution of that contract which as∣sured to the United States their existence, and which France regarded as the pledge of the most sacred union between two people, the freest upon earth: In a word, he announces to the secretary of state the resolution of a government, terrible to its enemies, but generous to its allies.</P>
<P>It would have been pleasing to the undersigned minister plenipotentiary, to have only to express, on the present occasion, the attachment which his government bears to the American people, the vows which it forms for their prosperity, for their happiness. His heart therefore is grieved at the circumstances which impose upon him a dif∣ferent task. With regret he finds himself com∣pelled to substitute the tone of reproach for the language of friendship. With regret also his go∣vernment has ordered him to take that tone; but that very friendship has rendered it indispensable. Its obligations sacred to men, are as sacred to governments; and if a friend offended by a friend, can justly complain, the government of the United States, after the undersigned minister plenipotentiary shall have traced the catalogue of grievances of the French Republic, will not be surprised to see the executive directory manifest∣ing their too just discontents.</P>
<P>When Europe rose up against the Republic at its birth, menaced it with all the horrors of war and of famine; when on every side the French could not calculate upon any but enemies, their thoughts turned towards America; a sweet senti∣ment then mingled itself with those proud senti∣ments, which the presence of danger and the de∣sire
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
of repelling it produced in their hearts. In America, they saw friends. Those who went to brave tempests and death upon the ocean, forgot all dangers in order to indulge the hope of visit∣ing that American continent, where, for the first time, the French colours had been displayed in favour of liberty. Under the guarantee of the law of nations, under the protecting shade of a solemn treaty, they expected to find in the ports of the United States an asylum as sure as at home; they thought, if I may use the expression, there to find a second country. The French go∣vernment thought as they did. Oh! hope, wor∣thy of faithful people, how hast thou been de∣ceived! So far from offering to the French the succours which friendship might have given with∣out compromitting it, the American government, in this respect, violated the letter of treaties.</P>
<P>The 17th article of the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778, states, that French vessels of war, and those of the United States, as well as those which shall have been armed for war by in∣dividuals of the two States, may freely conduct where they please the prizes they shall have made upon their enemies, without being subject to any admiralty or other duty; without the said vessels, on entering into the harbours or ports of France, or of the United States, being liable to be arrested or seized, or the officers of those places taking cognisance of the validity of the said prizes: which may depart and be conducted freely and in full liberty to the places expressed in their commissions, which the captains of the said ves∣sels shall be obliged to show: and that on the con∣trary, no shelter or refuge shall be given to those who shall have made prizes upon the French or
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
Americans; and that if they should be forced by stress of weather or the danger of the sea to en∣ter, they shall be made to depart as soon as possi∣ble.</P>
<P>In contempt of these stipulations, the French privateers have been arrested in the United States as well as their prizes; the tribunals have taken cognisance of the validity or invalidity of those prizes. It were vain to seek to justify these pro∣ceedings under the pretext of the right of vindi∣cating the compromitted neutrality of the United States. The facts about to be stated will prove, that this pretext has been the source of shocking persecutions against the French privateers, and that the conduct of the federal government has been but a series of violations of the 17th article of the treaty of 1778.</P>
<P>On the 4th of August, 1793, a circular letter of the secretary of the treasury was sent to all the collectors of the customs. It accompanied regu∣lations adopted by the president, prohibiting all armaments in favour of the belligerent powers. These regulations immediately acquired the force of law, and the agents of the government and the tribunals concurred in their execution. They gave them a retrospective effect, and caused to be seized, in the ports of the United States, the arm∣ed vessels and prizes which had come in prior to that time. But even before these regulations, adopted by the president, had established any rule whatever upon the prohibition of armaments, the tribunals had already, by order of the govern∣ment, assumed the cognisance of prizes made by French vessels. (No. 1.) One of the pre∣decessors of the undersigned protested against
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
this, but in vain. The tribunals still continued their prosecutions.</P>
<P>On the 3d of December, 1793, the president asked of congress a law confirming the measures contained in the letter from the secretary of the treasury, above mentioned. (No. 2.) This law was passed the 5th June, 1794. What was its result? In consequence of this law, the great∣er part of the French privateers have been arrest∣ed, as well as their prizes, not upon formal de∣positions, not upon established testimony, not upon a necessary body of proofs, but upon the simple information of the consul of one of the powers at war with the French Republic, fre∣quently upon that of sailors of the enemy pow∣ers, sometimes according to the orders of the governors, but often upon the demand of the district attorneys, who assert, upon principles avowed by the government, (No. 3.) that their conviction was sufficient to authorize them, with∣out complaint or regular information, to cause the privateers to be prosecuted, in virtue of the law above mentioned. (No. 4.)</P>
<P>When the ministers of the Republic have ask∣ed justice of the government for the vexations experienced by the privateers, in contempt of the 17th article of the treaty, they have never been able to obtain satisfaction.</P>
<P>Thus, when on the 9th Fructidor, 3d year, (26th August, 1794) the predecessor of the under∣signed, addressed a complaint to the government on this subject, the secretary of state answered, on the 3d September, 1794, by a phrase indica∣tive of delay.</P>
<P>Thus, when the same minister on the 27th Ven∣demaire, 3d year (17th October, 1794,) re∣minded
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
the secretary of state of the means he had proposed to him, for putting an end to the measures adopted against the French privateers; when he caused him to see that this means, which consisted in requiring security from those who claimed the prizes as illegal, would prevent the enemies of the Republic from instituting so many suits, of which they themselves perceived the injustice; he obtained no other answer than that his proposition relative to securities was in∣admissible.</P>
<P>When on the 13th Floreal, 3d year, the same minister expressed himself in these terms, in a letter to the secretary of state: <Q>“You have al∣ledged, Sir, that the executive of the United States cannot interfere in the affairs of which the tribunals have taken cognisance. In ad∣mitting this objection for all the business now in suit, I do not the less think that your go∣vernment could by general measures, bring back the jurisdiction of the American tribu∣nals, concerning prizes made by our vessels, within the limits prescribed by our treaties, which make part of the supreme law of the land: it might make known that the facility with which your courts of admiralty admit, without distinc∣tion, all the chicanery which our enemies cre∣ate against us, in the present war, is evidently ”contrary to the spirit of the treaty."</Q> The go∣vernment paid no attention to these reflections, and the answer of the secretary of state, merely notices the particular fact which had occasioned the note of Citizen Fauchet.</P>
<P>What was the undersigned minister plenipo∣tentiary able to obtain in the affair of the Cassius and of the Vengeance? Nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>The government of the United States must have seen however, by the claims which the mi∣nisters of the Republic addressed to it, and by the great number of facts, of which it has had a knowledge, how much the execution of the mea∣sures of the president, and of the law of the 5th June, 1794, was contrary to the 17th article of the treaty; how much the agency of the tribunals, who ought not to have any cognisance of the va∣lidity or invalidity of prizes, tended to annul that article, and to deprive the Republic of the advantage which it assures to her. In fact, was it not evident, that when the powers at war with the Republic had the privilege, in virtue of the law of the 5th of June, 1794, of causing to be arrested the privateers and their prizes, of de∣taining them in the ports of the United States, of ruining them by considerable costs, by the exces∣sive expenses which they occasioned them, they drew from that privilege an immense advantage, to the detriment of France? Doubtless it was of little import to them, that sometimes the privateers obtained justice, in the last resort, if they detain∣ed the privateer for a length of time, and if they, by that means, sheltered from their pursuit the commerce of the enemy of France. The neutrality of the United States, in this case, was altogether to their advantage; and the federal government, on seeing this state of things, should, out of respect to its neutrality and to treaties, solicit from the congress the means of conciliat∣ing the duties of the former with the obligations of the latter.</P>
<P>The government very well knew how to solicit the law of the 5th of June, 1794, when that law was to bear on France alone, when it gave to the
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
tribunals a right which has been abused, and which enables them to decide upon prizes: why, on seeing the inconveniencies of this law, has it not endeavoured to remedy them? Should it wait to be solicited on this head? Should it not anticipate all claims, and when those were presented by the ministers of the Republic, should it not do justice?</P>
<P>Besides, if the government had been impartial, as it has pretended to be, it would not have adopt∣ed that slow and circuitous mode, so favourable to the enemies of France, for deciding the cases relative to its neutrality; it would have preferred the measures proposed by Mr. Jefferson, on the 25th of June, 1793, to the minister of the Repub∣lic: these measures were simple, they were in conformity with the duties of neutrality and the interests of the Republic.</P>
<P>The federal government had decided questions which interested its neutrality, upon informations furnished by the state governors and the agents of the Republic; the prizes remained in the hands of the French consul, until this decision took place; the stipulations of the 17th article of the treaty of 1778, were not violated; and the government at the same time satisfied the obligations of duty and justice. In vain would it say, that it had not this power. Notwithstanding the law of 5th June, 1794, giving to the tribunal the right of taking cognisance of cases in which neutrality had been violated, did not the president on the 21st of June, 1794, decide that the ship William, taken out of the limits of the waters of the United States, should be delivered to the captor; and on the 3d July, 1794, did he not decide that the Pilgrim had been taken in the waters of the United States, and that of course she should be given up to the
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
owners? In these cases the president not only de∣cided on matters, the cognisance of which had been consigned to the tribunals, but likewise gave a retrospective effect to his own decision upon the protecting line of the United States, which was not notified to the minister of the Republic, till the 8th of November, 1793.</P>
<P>Not satisfied with permitting the 17th article of the treaty to be violated by its agents and tribu∣nals, the federal government also suffered the En∣glish to avail themselves of advantages interdicted to them by that article. They armed in the ports of the United States, brought in, and repaired their prizes, and in a word found in them a certain asylum.</P>
<P>Thus the English privateer Trusty, Capt. Hall, was armed at Baltimore to cruize against the French, and sailed notwithstanding the complaints of the consul of the Republic. At Charleston, one Bermudian vessel, several English vessels, and one Dutch vessel, from the 24th May to the 6th June 1793, took in cannon for their defence, and sailed without opposition.</P>
<P>What answer did the government give to the representations of the minister of the French Re∣public in this respect? He said that these vessels sailed so suddenly, it was not able to have them arrested. But the treaty was not the less violated. Some of the inhabitants of the United States had aided in these illegal armaments: What measures were taken against them? Was any search made to discover them, to prosecute them? Never, and yet the government of the United States no soon∣er learned that, in consequence of an implied stipulation which the treaty of Versailles seemed to contain, the French were arming in the ports
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
of the United States, than the most energetic or∣ders were sent for stopping these armaments. Even citizens of the United States were imprison∣ed upon suspicion that they had participated in them. The minister cannot omit citing here the following passage of a letter from the secretary of state, Edmund Randolph, to Mr. Hammond, dated 2d June 1794. <Q>“On a suggestion that citizens of the United States had taken part in the act, [he speaks of the armaments in the United States] one who was designated, was instantly committed to prison for prosecution: one or two others have been since named and com∣mitted in like manner, and should it appear, that there were still others, no measures would ”be spared to bring them to justice."</Q> What more could the American government do in fa∣vour of the English, if they had a similar treaty to that with France, and had been sole possessors of the advantages assured to her by positive stipu∣lations?</P>
<P>However, in contempt of these very stipula∣tions, the Argonaut, an English ship of war, in January 1795, conduced into Lynnhaven bay, the French corvette L'Esperance, which she had taken upon the coast; she there had her repaired, in order to send her on a cruise. Letters were in consequence written by the secretary of state to the governor of Virginia and to Mr. Hammond. What was the result? Nothing. On the 29th of May 1795, the federal government had not yet done any thing positive as to the acts which pro∣duced the complaint of the minister of the Repub∣lic. <Q>The secretary of state announced “that these facts shall be examined, and that if they are verified, the federal government will not be in
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
”the rear of its obligations."</Q> To that has the reparation demanded by the Republic been limit∣ed.</P>
<P>What are we to think of these delays, when we see the officers of the government acting with so much activity against the French, on the slightest suspicion that they have violated the neutrality— when in his letter of 29th April 1794, the secre∣tary of state answers the complaints of the English minister—<Q>“We have received no intelligence of the particular facts to which you refer: But to prevent all unnecessary circuity in first inquir∣ing into them and next transmitting to this city the result, the proper instructions will be given ”to act, without further directions."</Q> How did the federal government conduct towards the au∣tumn of 1794? The English frigate Terpsichore took the privateer La Montagne in the port of Norfolk. The French vice consul claimed the execution of the treaty, of the governor of Virgi∣nia: the governor answered him, that he would have the necessary investigation made, and would afterwards take the proper measures. The pre∣decessor of the undersigned then interposed with the federal government; and the secretary of state assured him, that he wrote to the governor of Virginia to have justice rendered. But this justice was limited to investigations made with such slowness, that five months after, this affair was not finished; and on the 24th February 1795, the secretary of state contented himself with sending to the predecessor of the undersigned, the dis∣patches of the lieutenant governor, dated 10th October 1794▪ by which he announces that he ordered the commandant of the militia of Norfolk to make the necessary inquiries for enabling the
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
executive of Virginia, to render to the Republic the justice it had a right to expect. The result of these inquiries is not known. However, the fact about which the minister Fauchet complained to the secretary of state was notorious, and painful researches were not necessary to convince himself of it. Do we not find in this proceeding a formal desire to elude the treaties, and to favour the English?</P>
<P>If the government of the United States had wished to maintain itself in that impartiality which its duties prescribed, if it had wished freely to ex∣ecute the treaties, it would not have waited every time that the English infringed them, for the mi∣nister to solicit its justice: should it not have given instructions so precise, that the governors of the states and subaltern officers of the federal govern∣ment might know what duties they had to fulfil, in order to maintain the execution of treaties? Why have the most energetic orders (such as the secretary of state, Randolph, mentions) been giv∣en, when the support of the neutrality inviolate in favour of the English, came in question? Why have the measures taken by the federal govern∣ment operated with so much slowness when France was interested? Why in fine have the multiplied claims of her ministers never produced the redress of the grievances of which they complained?</P>
<P>When the predecessor of the undersigned minis∣ter plenipotentiary claimed the execution of the 17th article of the treaty, interdicting the entry into the American ports of English vessels which should have made prizes upon the French, when he cited this simple and formal stipulation: <Q>“On the contrary, neither asylum nor refuge shall be given in the ports or harbours of France or of
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
the United States to vessels which shall have made prizes of the French or Americans; and should they be obliged to enter by tempest, or danger of the sea, all proper means shall be ”used to make them depart as soon as possible;"</Q> the secretary of state in order to avoid shutting the American ports against the English, interpreted this article in their favour. <Q>“But it would be uncandid to conceal from you the construction which we have hitherto deemed the true one. The first part of the 17th article relates to French ships of war and privateers entering our ports with their prizes; the second contracts the situ∣ation of the enemies of France, by forbidding such as shall have made prize of the French; intimating from this connexion of the two claus∣es, that the vessels forbidden are those which bring their prizes with them. It has been con∣sidered that this section of the treaty was im∣partially destined to the with-holding of pro∣tection, or succour, to the prizes themselves; had it been otherwise, it would have been su∣perfluous, to have prohibited from sailing what they have taken in the ports of the United ”States."</Q></P>
<P>He said, moreover, in his letter of the 29th of May, 1795—<Q>“But on the 3d of August the pre∣sident declared his construction of that treaty to be, that no public armed vessels were thereby forbidden from our waters, except those which should have made prize of the people or pro∣perty ”of France coming with their prizes."</Q> But how is it possible to find, in the stipulations of the treaty, the sense given to them by the government of the United States? This expression of the treaty, "which shall have made prizes," is gene∣ral,
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
and applies to all capturing vessels, whether they enter the ports of the United States with prizes, or enter them alone, after having made prizes. It is evident, that the government adds to the letter of the treaty in this circumstance; and is it not astonishing, that it admits a construc∣tion of the treaty, when it expects to find a mean∣ing disadvantageous to France, and in other in∣stances opposes all construction, when this would be favourable to the Republic. But has it the right of construing the treaty, of changing, of its own accord, the sense of a clear and precise stipu∣lation, without the consent and concurrence of the other contracting party? Doubtless not, espe∣cially, when, by so doing, it wounds her interests.</P>
<P>The secretary of state, by the 22d article, pre∣tends to support his construction of the 17th ar∣ticle. What does this 22d article contain? A prohibition of the enemies of France and of the United States from arming in the respective ports of the two powers, of selling their prizes, or of discharging all or part of their cargo there. This article, therefore, applies to the prizes; whilst the 17th applies to the capturing vessels. Did it not exist, the enemies of France or of the United States, might send their prizes into the respective ports of the two powers, without con∣ducting them there themselves: the 17th article, containing only a prohibitory arrangement for the capturing vessels, could not prohibit them from doing this. It was necessary then to have re∣course to a formal prohibition: besides, as the vessels which have made prizes on the French or Americans, are admitted into the ports of France or of the United States, in cases of tempest or dangers of the sea, they might, in this case,
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
have conceived themselves authorised to dispose of their prizes, to sell them, or to discharge their cargoes; it was necessary therefore to take this right from them in a positive manner; it was necessary to prevent them from benefitting by a stipulation made in favour of humanity: this is the end answered by the 22d article, which is not superfluous, as the secretary of state maintains, but, on the contrary, contains a distinct stipula∣tion from that of the 17th. It is then evident from this, that in the cases above cited by the undersigned, the stipulations of the 17th article have been violated. They have been equally so, by the admission, in sundry ports, of the Thetis and Hussar frigates, which captured la Prevoyante and la Raison, French store-ships, and by admit∣ting, in the last instance, this same ship la Raison, prize to the Thetis, into the ports of the United States.</P>
<P>But admitting, for a moment, the construction gratuitously given by the secretary of state to the 17th article of the treaty of 1778; this article has not the less been violated, when the Argo∣naut, which had quitted Hampton roads in order to capture l'Esperance, was permitted to enter with that prize▪ when the Terpsichore was suffer∣ed to bring in the privateer la Montagne. In vain were sought, in the resources of a captious and false logic, the means of excusing such con∣duct. The facts speak, and every upright mind, not blinded by passion, will necessarily yield to their evidence. Yet the prohibitory stipulation of the admission of prizes made by her enemies, is the only advantage which France expected to enjoy, after having wrought and guaranteed the independence of the United States, at a time
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
when she might, as the price of that very inde∣pendence, have granted them less liberal condi∣tions.</P>
<P>These wrongs of the American government to∣wards the Republic, just stated by the undersigned minister plenipotentiary, will soon be aggravated by new ones. It was a little matter only to al∣low the English to avail themselves of the ad∣vantages of our treaty; it was necessary to as∣sure these to them by the aid of a contract, which might serve at once as a reply to the claims of France, and as peremptory motives for refusals, the true cause of which it was requisite incessant∣ly to disguise to her under specious pretexts.</P>
<P>Such was the object of Mr. Jay's mission to London; such was the object of a negociation, enveloped from its origin in the shadow of mys∣tery, and covered with the vail of dissimulation. Could the executive directory have any other idea of it, on examining its issue, on seeing all the ef∣forts made by the American government to con∣ceal the secret from every eye.</P>
<P>In his message to the senate of the 16th April, 1794, the president declared, that Mr. Jay was sent to London only to obtain a redress of the wrongs done to the United States; at the same time the secretary of state communicated to the predecessor of the undersigned, a part of the in∣structions to Mr. Jay, reminding him of the <HI>in∣tention of the American government not to deviate from its engagements with the Republic of France</HI>. The French minister, deceived by this communi∣cation, contributed ingenuously to deceive his go∣vernment. The American minister in France removed the fears of the French government, as to the mission of this envoy extraordinary, and
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
represented it as the only means of obtaining in∣demnification for the losses which the American commerce had sustained. What has this negoci∣ation produced? A treaty of amity and com∣merce, which deprives France of all the advan∣tages stipulated in a previous treaty.</P>
<P>In fact, all that could render the neutrality profitable to England and injurious to France is combined in this treaty. Her commercial rela∣tions with the United States are entirely broken, by the abandonment of the modern public law on contraband, a law which England had conse∣crated in eleven treaties, and which the Ameri∣cans had also consecrated in their treaties with France, Holland, Sweden and Prussia. From the new arrangements adopted by the United States with regard to England, the free carriage of the articles for the equipment and armament of ves∣sels, is granted exclusively to that power.</P>
<P>By the 23d article of the treaty of Versailles, the United States have the liberty of freely car∣rying on commerce with the enemies of France. The 24th article of the treaty with Holland, the 10th article of the treaty with Sweden, and the 13th article of the treaty with Prussia, contain the same stipulation. This last article gives even more extensive rights to the United States, by permitting them to carry to the enemies of this power, all the articles that are enumerated in the list of such as are contraband of war, without their being liable to confiscation. But by the 18th article of the treaty of London, the articles for arming and equipping vessels are declared con∣traband of war. The government of the United States has therefore, by this stipulation, granted to the English a right which they had refused, in
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
consequence of the modern public law, to other nations with whom they have made treaties; that of seizing on board their vessels, articles proper for the construction and equipment of vessels. The English, then, according to that, enjoy the exclusive commerce of articles proper for the con∣struction of vessels; yet prior to the treaty con∣cluded between John Jay and Lord Grenville, the United States had the right of carrying on commerce with every power: the partiality of the American government in favour of England, has therefore been such, that not only the inter∣ests of France, but also those of other states, have been sacrificed to her.</P>
<P>In vain will it be objected that France, having the right by her treaty of 1778, to enjoy all the advantages in commerce and navigation, which the United States have granted to England, is not injured by the stipulations of the treaty of 1794, relative to contraband of war, as they become common to her. But the right secured to her by the second article of the treaty of 1778, does not at all extend to the allies whom the suc∣cess of her arms, and the just resentment, inspir∣ed by the ambition of England, have definitively given and shall give to her in Europe. These dispositions change, during the course of the war, the situation of the United States, towards En∣gland and the belligerent powers allied to France; the interest of these powers is common to France; and from the moment that is injured, France is injured also.</P>
<P>After having assured to the English the carriage of naval stores, the federal government wished to assure to them that of meals; in a word, it desired to have commerce only with England.
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
Thus, it stipulates, by the 18th article, that the American vessels, laden with grain, may be seiz∣ed under the frivolous pretext, that it is extremely difficult to define the cases wherein provisions, and other articles which are generally excepted, could be classed in the list of contraband of war: thus it stipulates in article 17, that the Ameri∣can vessels may be arrested upon the single sus∣picion, either that they have merchandise belong∣ing to the enemy, or that they carry to him arti∣cles contraband of war. The United States, in their treaty with France, have made stipulations entirely opposite to those just cited; whilst her vessels of war are bound to respect the American flag going to English possessions, the English drag into their ports American vessels going to the ports of France; subject them to decisions more or less arbitrary; and often condemn them on ac∣count of the name, alone, of their owners. By which means all the commercial relations between the United States and France, are entirely sus∣pended. What American will venture to send vessels into French ports? What commerce will he venture to undertake with the French possessi∣ons, when it will be certain that his funds, either in going to, or returning from them, run the greatest hazard? Would he not rather prefer traf∣ficking with a country, to which his vessels might go without being exposed to other risks than those of the sea? Would he not prefer Great Britain to France, for his speculations? In virtue of the treaty of London, and by the course of things, would not the commerce of the United States pass entirely to England, during the present war?</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40"/>After having consented to such conditions, the American government cannot pretend to impar∣tiality; it cannot say that it has maintained an equal neutrality between France and England, since it has granted to Great Britain advantages denied to France. But every one of these ad∣vantages granted to England, was a real wrong to the Republic; and if it is not maintained, without sporting with all principles, that a govern∣ment may consider itself as neutral, in granting to a belligerent power, advantages which it refuses to another, it is clear that the government of the United States, after having made its treaty with Great Britain, ceased to be neutral, when it op∣posed itself to the participation by France, in the favours granted to the English.</P>
<P>In consequence, the undersigned minister ple∣nipotentiary again declares, that the executive directory has just ordered the vessels of war and privateers of the Republic, to treat American vessels in the same manner, as they suffer the English to treat them.</P>
<P>Were the treaty of London out of the question, the measure the executive directory now takes, would not be less conformable to justice. The undersigned minister plenipotentiary has develop∣ed to the secretary of state, in his note of the 6th Brumaire last, principles which leave no doubt in this respect, and which the answer of the se∣cretary of state is far from destroying. (No. 5.) But the stipulations of treaties now come to the support of general principles. The Republic calls for the execution of the second article of the treaty of 1778, which says, that France and the United States, mutually engage not to grant any particular favour, as to navigation or com∣merce,
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
which shall not immediately become com∣mon to the other party. The government of the United States having by the treaty of London, sa∣crificed to England the freedom of their flag, the property of the enemies of England, and naval stores; France, by her treaty, is authorised to claim the same advantage, to make use of it, and the United States have no right to complain.</P>
<P>Certainly it would have been more conforma∣ble to the designs of France, to her principles, to see the American flag, floating without inter∣ruption upon the seas, to see the commerce of the United States enjoy that liberty, that freedom, which should belong to neutral nations: but, in order to that, it was necessary that the American government should know how to maintain that neutrality; it was necessary that it preserved it free from violation by Great Britain; and if now the execution of the measures which the directory is obliged to adopt, give rise to complaints in the United States, it is not against France they should be directed, but against those men who by nego∣ciations contrary to the interests of their country, have brought the French government to use the prerogatives granted to the English.</P>
<P>When, after having suffered to be violated the treaties which unite it to France, the government of the United States has associated itself with England, and has rendered its neutrality as useful to that power as it is now injurious to its ancient ally; could the Republic be silent? Her outraged generosity, her wounded honour, prevented her; her silence were weakness; and, strong in her principles as in her proceedings, she should de∣mand her unacknowledged or forgotten rights.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42"/>Thus therefore, as it results from the statement which the undersigned minister plenipotentiary has just given,</P>
<P N="1">1st. That the 17th article of the treaty of 1778, has been violated; that in contempt of this article the American tribunals have been permitted to take cognisance of the validity of prizes made by French ships of war and privateers, under pretext of original armament or augmentation of arma∣ment in the United States, or of capture within the jurisdictional line of the United States.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the said article 17 has been equally vi∣olated by the admission of English vessels into the ports of the United States, which had made prizes on Frenchmen, and by the admission of their prizes.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary, in the name, and by the orders of the executive di∣rectory, protests against the violation of the 17th article above cited, in contempt of which the A∣merican tribunals have taken cognisance of the validity of prizes made by French ships of war, or privateers, under pretext of original armament, or augmentation of armament in the United States, or of capture within the jurisdictional line; claims the replevy of all seizures, and the repeal of all other judicial acts exercised on those prizes; and protests, moreover, against all opposition to the sale of the said prizes.</P>
<P>Further, the undersigned minister plenipotenti∣ary protests against the violation of the 17th arti∣cle of the treaty of 1778, in contempt of which English vessels, which had made prize on French∣men, have been admitted into the ports of the United States; and declares, that the executive directory cannot regard as a just construction of
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
the treaty, the distinction which Mr. Randolph, secretary of state, has established in his letter of 29th May, 1795, in which he admits only the exclusion of the English vessels which bring in their prizes, and wishes to except from the prohi∣bitory measure, the vessels which, after having made prizes, enter the ports of the United States.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary more∣over declares, that the executive directory regards the treaty of commerce concluded with Great Britain as a violation of the treaty made with France in 1778, and equivalent to a treaty of alli∣ance with Great Britain, and that justly offended at the conduct which the American government has held in this case, they have given him orders to suspend from this moment his ministerial func∣tions with the federal government.</P>
<P>The same cause which for a long time prevent∣ed the executive directory from allowing their just resentment to break forth, has also tempered its effects. Neither hatred, nor the desire of ven∣geance, rapidly succeed to friendship in the heart of a Frenchman; the name of America still ex∣cites sweet emotions in it, notwithstanding the wrongs of its government; and the executive directory wish not to break with a people whom they love to salute with the appellation of friend.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary there∣fore announces that the government of the United States, and the American people, are not to regard the suspension of his functions as a rupture be∣tween France and the United States, but as a mark of just discontent, which is to last until the go∣vernment of the United States returns to sentiments and to measures more conformable to the interests
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
of the alliance and the sworn friendship between the two nations.</P>
<P>This alliance was always dear to Frenchmen; they have done every thing to tighten its bands; the government of the United States, on the con∣trary, has sought to break them. Scarcely had the war broken out between France and England, when America was alone invited to the commerce of the Antilles. All the colonial ports were open∣ed to her. Her vessels entered the ports of France without being subjected to higher duties than French vessels. When the English violated the freedom of the neutral flag, the convention was obliged to use reprisals. They ordered, that neu∣tral vessels should be seized by the ships of the Republic; she excepted the Americans from this measure: forced against her inclination to make it bear on them also, she waited with impatience for the moment when she might return to a con∣duct more conformable to her sentiments for the United States. Soon she revoked her law relative to the arrest of their vessels. Soon also the com∣mittee of public safety gave orders to respect the American flag. In every circumstance France sought the means of proving to the United States, the sincerity of her friendship. When the federal government complained of the conduct of one of the predecessors of the undersigned, the French government saw only the complaints of the go∣vernment of the United States, and immediately gave the most striking reparation.</P>
<P>Let the annals of the French revolution be opened; let the minutes of that august sitting be seen, in which the national convention received the minister of the United States in its bosom; the addresses were not studied; they sprang from
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
hearts full of affection for an allied people; they breathed the sentiments which dictated them; and the American minister found himself in the midst of his friends. What joy did not the Ame∣rican flag inspire, when it waved unfurled in the French senate? Tender tears trickled from each eye; every one looked at it with amazement. There, said they, is the symbol of the indepen∣dence of our American brethren—behold there the pledge of their liberty! May victory always attend it—may it lead to glory none but a free and happy people! These words which escaped from a thousand mouths were the expression of the senti∣ments of the whole nation. Was not an American to each Frenchman, another Frenchman?—He was more—he was a friend; and that sacred name, amidst civil dissentions, was equally respected by all.</P>
<P>What then was done by the government? It put in question, whether it should execute the treaties, or receive the agents of the rebel and proscribed princes. (No. 6.) It made a procla∣mation of insidious neutrality: by its chicaneries it abandoned French privateers to its courts of justice; it eluded the amicable mediation of the Republic for breaking the chains of its citizens at Algiers. (No. 7.) Notwithstanding treaty sti∣pulations, it allowed to be arrested vessels of the state; it suffered England, by insulting its neu∣trality, to interrupt its commerce with France; notwithstanding the faith of treaties, it gave an asylum to these same English, who, after having insulted her flag, pillaged her citizens, came also to brave the American people in its ports, and to take a station whence to cruize on a favourable opportunity against the French: it might be said, that it applauded their audacity; all submission to
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
their will, it allowed the French colonies to be declared in a state of blockade, and its citizens interdicted the right of trading to them. (No. 8.) It eluded all the advances made by the Republic for renewing the treaties of commerce upon a more favourable footing to both nations. (No. 9.) It excused itself on the most frivolous pretexts; whilst it anticipated Great Britain, by soliciting a treaty, in which, prostituting its neutrality, it sa∣crificed France to her enemies, or rather, looking upon her as obliterated from the chart of the world, it forgot the services that she had rendered it, and throw aside the duty of gratitude, as if ingratitude was a governmental duty.</P>
<P>Alas! time has not yet demolished the fortifi∣cations with which the English roughened this country—nor those the Americans raised for their defence; their half rounded summits still appear in every quarter, amidst plains, on the tops of mountains. The traveller need not search for the ditch which served to encompass them; it is still open under his feet. Scattered ruins of houses laid waste, which the fire had partly re∣spected, in order to leave monuments of British fury, are still to be found.—Men still exist, who can say, here a ferocious Englishman slaughtered my father; there my wife tore her bleeding daugh∣ter from the hands of an unbridled Englishman. Alas! the soldiers who fell under the sword of the Britons are not yet reduced to dust; the la∣bourer, in turning up his field, still draws from the bosom of the earth their whitened bones; while the ploughman, with tears of tenderness and gratitude, still recollects that his fields, now covered with rich harvests, have been moistened with French-blood; while every thing around the
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
inhabitants of this country animates them to speak of the tyranny of Great Britain and of the generosity of Frenchmen; when England has de∣clared a war of death to that nation, to avenge herself for its having cemented with its blood the independence of the United States—it was at this moment their government made a treaty of amity with their ancient tyrant, the implacable enemy of their ancient ally. O! Americans, covered with noble scars! O! you who have so often flown to death and to victory, with French soldiers! You who know those generous sentiments which distinguish the true warrior! Whose hearts have always vibrated with those of your compa∣nions in arms! Consult them to-day, to know what they experience: recollect at the same time, that if magnanimous souls with liveliness resent an affront, they also know how to forget one. Let your government return to itself, and you will still find in Frenchmen faithful friends and generous allies.</P>

<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
—As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the United States have the most extensive relations, there was reason to apprehend that an extensive intercourse with them might be interrupted, and our disposition for peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained by belligerent nations. It seemed therefore to be my duty, to admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband trade, and of hostile acts to any of the parties; and to obtain, by a declaration of the existing legal state of things, an easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging to our situation. Under these impressions the proclamation, which will be laid before you, was issued.</P>
<P>In this posture of affairs, both new and deli∣cate, I resolved to adopt general rules, which should conform to the treaties, and assert the pri∣vileges of the United States. These were re∣duced into a system, which will be communicated to you. Although I have not thought myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with France, to be brought into our ports, I have not refused to cause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of our territory, or by ves∣sels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the United States.</P>
<P>It rests with the wisdom of congress to correct, improve, or enforce this plan of protection; and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code, and the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, to many cases, which, though dependent on principles already recognis∣ed, demand some further provisions.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49"/>Where individuals shall, within the United States, array themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war, or enter upon military ex∣peditions or enterprises within the jurisdiction of the United States, or usurp and exercise judicial authority within the United States, or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked, or are inadequate, these offences cannot receive too early and close an attention, and require prompt and decisive remedies.</P>
<P>Whatever those remedies may be, they will be well administered by the judiciary, who possess a long established course of investigation, effectual process, and officers in the habit of executing it.</P>
<P>(No. 3.) The undersigned minister plenipoten∣tiary having complained to the secretary of state, that the attorney of the United States had caused the privateer <HI>La Vengeance</HI> to be arrested without an affidavit or other authentic testimony; on the 11th August, 1795, the secretary of state sent him an answer, which Mr. Troup had addressed to him in the absence of Mr. Harrison, district at∣torney of New York, in which is this passage— <Q>“As to the suit against the privateer, it was com∣menced by Mr. Harrison, as attorney for the district, upon an official disclosure to him, by the Spanish consul, of the evidence which led him to suppose the privateer had been fitted out and armed within the United States. Mr. Harrison, upon receiving this disclosure, felt himself called upon by considerations, which, as a public officer, he could not resist, to pro∣ceed against the privateer under the 3d section of the act of congress, entitled, An act in ad∣dition to the act for the punishment of certain
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
crimes against the United States, passed 5th June, 1794. This section works a forfeiture of the privateer, one half to the use of any person who shall give information of the of∣fence, and the other half to the use of the United States. No person having appeared in quality of informer to institute the suit, Mr. Harrison, according to the course of the com∣mon law, filed an information in behalf of the United States, solely against the privateer, as you will perceive by the copy of the informa∣tion already transmitted to you. No law of the United States, and no law or usage of this state, required the information to be founded upon any previous affidavit, or evidence of the truth of the matters alleged in it. The fil∣ing of an information is an act entirely in the discretion of the officer entrusted by law with the power of doing it; and if he should abuse his power, he stands upon the footing of all public officers who are guilty of malversation in office. In the present instance, Mr. Harri∣son has acted from the best of his judgment upon the duty of his office, after officially ob∣taining information from a public officer, who conceived himself likewise bound by a sense ”of duty to communicate the information."</Q></P>
<P>When the undersigned minister plenipotentiary renewed the charge on the 3d Vendemaire, 4th year (24th September, 1795) to the secretary of state, and still complained that an affidavit was not required to cause a privateer to be arrested—he expressed himself in these words:</P>
<P><Q>“But I again renew the assertion that an affi∣davit is not necessary for ordering the arrest of ”a vessel:</Q></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51"/>What is the law, what is the usage, which es∣tablishes the prosecution for reparation of an offence, before it be ascertained that it has been committed; and what certainty then had the at∣torney? His opinion! Upon what is it founded? The complaint of the Spanish agent, since there was not a single affidavit.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, upon mere suspicions which the ene∣my interest will not fail always to bring forward, the French privateers are to be subjected to seiz∣ure! Such a measure tends to nothing less than to paralyze the 17th article of our treaty.</P>
<P>The secretary of state, in reply, sent to the un∣dersigned minister plenipotentiary the copy of a letter from Mr. Harrison, of the 3d Oct. 1795, in which is this remarkable passage—<Q>“In this whole business, however, I have undoubtedly acted from my own opinion, founded upon such evidence as came to my knowledge; and as in similar cases, I must necessarily, in the first instance, be unacquainted with the opinions and convic∣tions of others, I know of no other rule by which I can be guided, <HI>unless when I am ho∣noured with the directions of the chief executive ”magistrate."</HI></Q></P>
<P>The secretary of state thus closes his letter of the 16th of October covering that of Mr. Harri∣son—</P>
<P><Q>“You will perceive that whatever may be the event of the suits pending in court concerning her [<HI>the privateer</HI>] and her prize, the public officer, Mr. Harrison, is supported in his pro∣ceedings by the laws and usages of this coun∣try, upon such evidence and information as in ”the case referred to were produced."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52"/>(No. 4.) In virtue of this law, the tribunals were only authorised to decide on cases in which the neutrality of the United States shall have been compromitted. Yet these tribunals conceived they had a right to pronounce upon prizes made by the French, in almost an indefinite manner. In the affair of Glass and Gibbs against the ship Betsey, the decision of which has been printed, the supreme court pronounced, that the tribunals could decide whether a prize belonged to enemies or to neutrals. In the affair of Joost Janson against the Dutch ship Vrouw Catharina Magdalena, it was decided that the naturalization granted in the territories of France to American citizens, during the war, could not give them the right either of serving or of commanding on board of French privateers; that the prizes made by such, although legally commissioned, were not valid: a distinc∣tion is established between a legal and an illegal privateer; it was judged that they had a right to pronounce on this legality; and consequently on the validity of the prizes: it was finally decided, that a prize made at sea with the assistance of an illegal privateer, was void and should be restored.</P>
<P>It was according to these first decisions of the supreme court that the district attorney of Virgi∣nia wrote officially, on the 28th March 1794, to the vice consul at Norfolk—<Q>“No vessel can be condemned as prize, but in district courts, which are the proper admiralties of the United ”States."</Q> The enemies of France understood, or did not understand, this mode; but they avail∣ed themselves of it; and in order to cause French privateers to be arrested, they had recourse to the law of 5th June 1794.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53"/>At this period however, the law had put into the hands of government a sufficient power for preventing the arming and equipping of priva∣teers in the ports of the United States. By the letter of the secretary of the treasury of the 4th August 1793, the collectors of the customs were authorised, and even required, to visit, in the strictest manner, not only all privateers, but all vessels entering or going out of American ports. The law of 5th June authorised the president to support the exercise of these functions with military force. Of course, they did not neglect to visit, with the greatest rigor, all French vessels, privateers and others, during their continuance in the ports of the United States, and at their de∣parture. They did not quit these ports, but un∣der the eye, and with the express permission, of the officers of the government; for it had forbid∣den the collectors to clear them, if they commit∣ted the least violation on the neutrality of the United States: in which case they might be seiz∣ed and confiscated. Yet, whether they had en∣tered the ports of the United States armed, and also went out armed; or had since been armed for war in French ports, scarcely did one of their prizes enter, but she was arrested by order of the federal court.</P>
<P>The proceedings were instituted and pursued, without any of the forms for protecting citizens. As the undersigned minister plenipotentiary has said, the assertion of an enemy of the Republic was sufficient for causing a prize to be seized, oft∣en the privateer which had brought her in; and sometimes, for the arrest of her captain, no proof was required from the enemy consul who instigat∣ed the arrest; he was not obliged to give security
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
For the damages which might result from the pro∣cedure, if it we're unfounded; the captain was not allowed to remain in possession of his property, on giving security for its value; the prizes were not valued; they simply placed them in the hands of the officers of justice; rarely were they permitted to be sold; and then the sale was made with slow∣ness, and not till the consent of the two parties was obtained. In fine, when with much delay and expense, notwithstanding the shifts of a crafty chicanery, the complainants proved nothing they advanced, the prizes were adjudged to the cap∣tors, but refused indemnification for damages and losses occasioned by this seizure.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary knows but two affairs, that of <HI>La Nostra Senora del Car∣men</HI>, at Rhode Island, and that of <HI>La Princesse des Asturies</HI>, at New York, where security was given to the party complaining, and where da∣mages and interests were allowed to the captors— yet the tribunals have always allowed damages to the captured, when they have declared the prizes illegal. The least pretext was sufficient to obtain from a tribunal the arrest of a prize; it was suffi∣cient to allege, that the privateer had taken one or two cannon, one or two barrels of powder, or opened some port-holes in the territory of the United States.</P>
<P>In the affair of the two prizes of the French privateer Les Citoyens de Marseille, which enter∣ed the port of Philadelphia, armed and commis∣sioned, repaired in the same port, and sent out under the eyes of the government, the only thing in question was, that some port-holes were pre∣tended to have been opened in the vessel after her departure from Philadelphia; the court of Charles∣ton
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
was of opinion, that the holes had been open∣ed, and condemned the two prizes. The superior courts did not adopt this opinion, and the first sentence was reversed; but after how long a time, how much care, fatigue, pain and expense?</P>
<P>In the affair of the Princesse des Asturies, at New York, as will be seen hereafter, only two cannon and a score of fusees were in question; behold what is called an armament, behold how words are abused!</P>
<P>Prizes have been arrested under still more fri∣volous pretexts. The privateer La Parisienne had infringed a revenue law of the United States; she was seized and condemned by the district court. This tribunal, doubtless agreeably to rules prescribed by the law, had restored this vessel to her owners, on making them pay her value. The privateer, after having executed the sentence of the court, went out and made two considerable prizes: one was sent into Charleston and the other into Savannah. They were both arrested at the instance of the English consuls, under the pretext that the tribunal had acted illegally, by restoring the confiscated privateer—that notwith∣standing this restitution and the payment of her value to the treasurer, she had always remained the property of the United States, and could not make any lawful prize. This ridiculous assertion was seriously opposed in the district and circuit courts, and in the supreme court of the United States; at the close of the proceedings, which lasted nearly two years, the prizes were adjudged to the captors, but without allowing them da∣mages.</P>
<P>In like manner have been treated the rich and numerous prizes of the French privateers La
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
Mere Michelle, Le Brutus, Le General Laveaux, and Le Vengeur. The captors have gained their causes in three courts, and have not obtained da∣mages.</P>
<P>Were it necessary to cite here all the vexatious proceedings commenced against French vessels, the undersigned minister plenipotentiary would be obliged to write a volume. He contents him∣self with adding to what he has just said, the af∣fair of the Vengeance and that of the Cassius.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Affair of the Vengeance.</HEAD>
<P>At the beginning of 1794, the predecessor of the undersigned charged the captain of La Do∣rade, a French galliot, with a particular mission for St. Domingo. He ordered him to go to New York with his galliot, to take some powder which was at Sandy Hook on board the frigate La Se∣millante, belonging to the Republic, and which made part of her equipment, and to carry them to General Laveaux. This vessel had formerly been armed for war; she had been built with port-holes; consequently she attracted the parti∣cular attention of the government. Many diffi∣culties were thrown in her way; but finally, after having submitted to all the requisite inspections, she sailed with a formal clearance from the col∣lector of the customs of Philadelphia. She went to New York, where the captain acquitted him∣self of his mission, and thence to Port de Paix, where the powder was delivered to General La∣veaux. At that place this galliot was sold to an inhabitant of St. Domingo, who armed her, equip∣ped her completely, partly at Port de Paix and partly at Cape François. She was called <HI>La
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
Vengeance</HI>, and given to Captain Berard, as com∣mander, who sailed from St. Domingo with a com∣mission in good form, and a crew entirely French, to cruise against the enemies of the Republic. A few days after her departure, she captured a Spanish vessel, called the <HI>Princesse des Asturies</HI>, laden with a rich cargo, and carried her into the port of New York, in the summer of 1795.</P>
<P>The Spanish consul availing himself of the fa∣cility given him by the law of 5th June 1794, had the prize arrested, under the pretext that the pri∣vateer had been armed in the United States, and we saw officers of the government appear to de∣fend his assertion—Mr. Harrison, attorney of the district of New York, and Mr. Troup, clerk of the district and circuit courts, to which appertain∣ed the decision of the cause.</P>
<P>It was under these auspices that the prize was arrested, and that the captain of the privateer saw himself obliged to defend her against the al∣legation of a pretended armament. But it was not sufficient to have arrested the prize, they must also attack the privateer: this did not fail to hap∣pen. Shortly after Mr. Harrison, without laying aside his office of attorney for the captured, but acting in this instance in the name of the United States, informed against <HI>La Vengeance</HI>, and re∣quired her arrest, under the same pretext which had been used for arresting her prize. This in∣formation was not founded upon any affidavit or material proof: but Mr. Attorney, according to his letter to the secretary of state, had no need of any; he had seen in the hands of the Spanish cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, documents sufficient to have the prize condemned. In fine, not content with these mea∣sures, the same attorney, some time after, the two
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
other causes being still pending, exhibited a second information against the privateer, and had her ar∣rested anew, for having exported arms in viola∣tion of a law of the United States, which was in force when the Vengeance sailed from New York. This information was made upon the simple de∣claration of Mr. Giles, marshal of the court, who, as informer, was to have his part of the confis∣cation: so that all the officers of the district court (except the judge) were interested in the condem∣nation of the privateer or her prize. It is well to observe that, during the course of the process, the monies arising from the sale of the prize were deposited in the hands of the clerk (attor∣ney for the Spaniards) those arising from the sale of the privateer in the hands of the <HI>marshal</HI>, (in∣former and interested in the confiscation)—so that their interest was to spin out these causes by means of appeal; and so it has happened.</P>
<P>As this last information is here principally in question, it is proper to enter into some details on the subject. It appeared in the allegation, that the privateer had exported from the United States two cannon, twenty muskets, and fifty barrels of powder.</P>
<P>Two cannon and twenty muskets could scarcely be an object of commercial speculation. The existence of the cannon has never been proved, and certainly whatever muskets were found on board, were only for the defence of the vessel, without a wish to infringe the laws of the Ameri∣can government. The powder, in truth, was of the greatest consequence, but the consul of New York hastened to give his declaration under oath, and to prove by witnesses, that this pow∣der had been taken from on board La Semil∣lante,
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
and made part of her equipment. Mr. Harrison did not yield to this evidence.</P>
<P>However, the three causes went on; but the yellow fever, which took place at New York, spun them out to considerable length. The judg∣ment of the district court was not given till No∣vember. In the mean time, an express, which Capt. Berard had sent to St. Domingo, on the first arrest of his prize, had returned with papers proving, in the most convincing manner, that the Vengeur had arrived at Port-de-Paix without any armament or equipment whatever; and that she had been sold, armed and equipped wholly, and commissioned as a privateer, on the territory of the Republic. These documents were cer∣tificates of the general, the ordonnateur, &amp;c. of the greater part of the principal officers of St. Domingo; the accounts of armament attested by all the providers, [fournisseurs] &amp;c. the whole executed in the most authentic form.</P>
<P>The undersigned hastened to communicate these documents to the secretary of state of the United States, and to request that he would order the attorney of New York district, to stay the proceedings he had instituted in the name of the government. There was nothing done with them, and Mr. Harrison continued his prosecutions.</P>
<P>In fine, the moment came for deciding these three causes. They were pleaded with much preparation before the district court of New York: the privateer was acquitted of the charge of illegally arming, and the prize adjudged to the captor. Mr. Harrison did not appeal as to the privateer, but the cause of the prize was car∣ried to the circuit court, and finally to the su∣preme
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
court; and these two tribunals confirmed the sentence of the district court.</P>
<P>As to the exportation, the judge was of opi∣nion that the vessel should be condemned for it; and grounded his sentence only on the arti∣cle of <HI>twenty muskets</HI>. Some of the attorneys for the privateer had considered it as of so little consequence, that they had not conceiv∣ed it would be brought in question; and had omitted to speak of it in their pleadings. It was natural to appeal from such a sentence; the con∣sul of New York was the appellant, and requir∣ed, agreeably to a law of congress, that the ves∣sel should be given up to him, under security dur∣ing the appeal; but he could not obtain it; the vessel was sold for less than a tenth part of the cost of her armament: and the money was de∣posited till the conclusion of the process.</P>
<P>The circuit court, as was expected, set aside the sentence which condemned the privateer; but Mr. Harrison, not content with all he had hitherto done, immediately appealed to the su∣preme court of the United States, which was not more favourable to him, and confirmed the sen∣tence of the circuit court. The government, notwithstanding the representations of the under∣signed minister plenipotentiary, took a decided part in the appeal, and gave it in charge to Mr. Lee, the attorney general, to argue—which he did with much eloquence, but with the success such a cause merited.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Affair of the Cassius.</HEAD>
<P>In the month of Thermidor, of the 3d year, (August, 1795) the corvette Le Cassius, belong∣ing to the Republic, commanded by Captain
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
Davis, and sent by General Laveaux to the un∣dersigned minister plenipotentiary, on a particu∣lar mission, requiring her immediate return to St. Domingo, was seized in virtue of an order from the district court of the United States, for the state of Pennsylvania, and her captain was arrested at the suit of a merchant of Philadelphia, to answer for a pretended illegal capture made in virtue of his commission, and out of the jurisdic∣tion of the United States.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary com∣plained of this violation of the treaties and of the law of nations, and requested the govern∣ment to cause, as soon as possible, the release of the corvette Le Cassius and her captain. He con∣ceived himself so much the more grounded in this request, as he knew that a like interposition was not new in the annals of the United States; as he knew that the executive power of the state of Pennsylvania had interposed in a similar case, and in the same manner, in favour of the state of Vir∣ginia, and as this measure, dictated by a profound knowledge of the law of nations, and of the re∣ciprocal duties of nations, had been approved and ratified by the tribunals, organs of the law.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Simon Nathan versus the commonwealth of Virginia. Dallas's Reports, p. 77.</NOTE> But Mr. Randolph, secretary of state of the United States, replied to the undersigned on the 15th August, 1795—<Q>“As long as the question is in the hands of our courts, the executive ”cannot withdraw it from them."</Q></P>
<P>The undersigned insisting, on the first Fructidor, in the third year (18th August, 1785) expressed himself in these terms: <Q>“I do not know, nor ought I to know, other than the government
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
of the United States; I cannot under any shape admit the competency of your tribunals, in the different circumstances which arise on the execution or inexecution of the treaties. If these tribunals are the first to violate them, I can only address myself to the government for reparation of that violation; otherwise it would be, to render the agents of the French government—the French government itself, amenable to these tribunals; which would be ”to reverse principles."</Q> Informed that the Cas∣sius and her captain might be liberated on giving security, the undersigned requested, by the same letter, that the government of the United States would, itself, furnish this security; and know∣ing that the supreme court of the United States, which was then in session, had the power, in cer∣tain cases, of arresting the proceedings of the in∣ferior courts, on their signifying to them a prohi∣bition, he suggested to the secretary to adopt this sure and prompt method to put an end to this vexatious procedure. Both these requests were refused. The captain of Le Cassius then ad∣dressed himself to the supreme tribunal, requested the prohibition and obtained it. The district court was enjoined immediately to stop the pro∣ceedings which had been commenced, and to li∣berate Captain Davis and his vessel.</P>
<P>But at the very instant in which the <HI>marshal</HI> was desired to execute the order of the supreme court, he had already in possession a new order from another tribunal (the circuit court) enjoining him to arrest the vessel <HI>anew</HI>, upon the charge of an English merchant and naturalized American, stating, that this vessel had been formerly armed in the United States; and consequently requested
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
that she should be confiscated, one moiety to himself, and the other moiety to the government. The undersigned being uninformed whether this vessel had ever been armed in the ports of the United States, he was also assured that some in∣dividuals had only attempted to put on board arms and ammunition, and which they were pre∣vented from doing at the time; but he takes upon him to affirm, that since this vessel has become the property of the French Republic, General Laveaux armed and equipped her wholly at St. Domingo; and that at her arrival here, she had not a cannon or pound of powder which had not been put on board her in the territory of France. This new order was signed by one of the judges of the supreme court (in quality of circuit judge) who having already ordered the prohibition in the first instance, must have known very well that this vessel was the property of the French Re∣public; and who must also have known that the circuit court was not competent to this proceed∣ing; which the law and usage have constantly at∣tributed to the district tribunals. But the district court then sat but once a year at Philadelphia; its approaching yet distant session was to be at York town, and the prosecutor had adopted this round-about mode, to take away every means from the French Republic of obtaining restitution of her vessel, legally, before the expiration of near a year. In the interval, she was to rot at the quays of Philadelphia. This has taken place. The undersigned, from a spirit of conciliation, made an useless attempt with one of the judges of the circuit court to obtain the liberation of the vessel, on giving security; the reply was that the judge could do nothing of himself; that the court when assembled could alone determine.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64"/>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary made new representations to the secretary of state of the United States, upon the foregoing facts. Mr. Pickering, then secretary of state, in his answer of 1st August, 1795, repeats this phrase of Mr. Randolph: <Q>“As long as the question is in the hands of our courts, the executive cannot ”withdraw it from them," adding thereto this remarkable expression; “and therefore is not chargeable with suffering a violation of the ”treaties existing between the two Republics."</Q> <Q>The undersigned complained, that the new suit commenced against the Cassius had been carried to an incompetent tribunal, and in the same let∣ter, of 1st August, 1795, the secretary of state replied on this head to the undersigned, “the counsel who have told you that such is the law, ”have led you into an error," &amp;c.—maintaining the competency of the tribunal.</Q></P>
<P>The undersigned minister, in these circum∣stances, saw himself obliged to disarm the vessel, to discharge the crew that during these transacti∣ons he had supported at great expense, and aban∣doned the Cassius to the government of the United States—protesting against the illegality of her arrest.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister is not acquainted with the details of what happened since that time relative to this affair; he only knows, that in the month of October last, the circuit court declared itself incompetent, notwithstanding the assertion of the secretary of state, and quashed all the proceedings. In consequence, the secre∣tary offered him the Cassius; as if, after having retained, in contempt of treaties, a state vessel, after having left her to rot in port, the govern∣ment of the United States were not to answer,
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
both for the violation of the treaties, and for the damages the Cassius has sustained.</P>
<P>(No. 5.) The secretary of state, by his public letter of the 1st November last, in answer to the note of the undersigned minister plenipotentiary, of the 6th of Brumaire last, appears not to have understood either that note or the decree of the executive directory of the 14th Messidor of the 4th year.</P>
<P>This decree does not simply contain the order for seizing English property on board of neutral vessels, and of course on board of American vessels; it orders that the vessels of the Republic shall act towards neutrals in the same manner as neutrals shall suffer the English to treat them.</P>
<P>This decree consequently implies, not only the seizure of enemy's property on board of American vessels, against the principle <HI>free ships make free goods</HI>, a principle the American govern∣ment abandoned after having recognised it by ac∣ceding to the declaration of Russia in 1780,—not only the seizure of articles classed as contraband in the treaty concluded between Lord Grenville and Mr. Jay, and declared innocent merchan∣dises by the treaty of 1778, but also reprisals for all vexations, contrary to the law of nations and to the treaties, which the Americans shall endure on the part of the English, without an efficacious opposition.</P>
<P>The secretary of state has been pleased to ob∣serve, that France and the United States, by a reciprocal treaty, had consecrated the principle, <HI>free ships make free goods</HI>, and diminished the list of articles seizable as contraband. Upon this basis he built reasoning which he might have spared, if he had been pleased to remember the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d article of the treaty of 1778.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66"/>The secretary has also been pleased to reply in part to the note of the undersigned minister ple∣nipotentiary, dated 6th Brumaire, relative to the press exercised on the American sailors, that the federal government was not to give an ac∣count to any nation of the measures it takes for the protection of its citizens; if such an answer required a reply, the undersigned minister pleni∣potentiary would request the secretary of state to observe, that the object of his note of 6th Bru∣maire, and of his letters of the 9th and 19th Germinal last, which are there referred to, was not at all to know the steps taken by the federal government for the protection of its citizens; but the measures pursued by it for preventing its citi∣zens from increasing the maritime forces of the enemies of the French Republic, its ally. It is evident, that in this case the federal government should expect, and the French Republic would have a right to regard, its silence as a tacit con∣sent to that measure and a real hostility.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary can no longer be suspected of having demanded of the government of the United States, explana∣tions foreign to the relations which exist between that government, and the French Republic, of having had the intention to wound the federal go∣vernment, in his letter of 7th Vendemaire in the fourth year, since after the passage cited by the secretary of state, is the following paragraph: <Q>“But I am convinced it will not be so. The American government is too much attached to the laws of an exact neutrality, it knows too well that the cause of free people is linked to that of France, to allow to be usurped by the English a right injurious to the interest of the ”Republic."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="67"/><Q>“It is in this conviction that I have written you this letter, persuaded that it is perhaps su∣perfluous to address to you these reclamations. I do not doubt but the American government will prove to all Europe the intention it has of maintaining the most exact neutrality with re∣gard to the belligerent powers, that it will oblige England to violate no longer the rights of na∣tions, and that it will not henceforward reduce France to the pain of addressing new claims ”upon this subject."</Q></P>
<P>(No. 6.) In the General Advertiser, published at Philadelphia on the 9th of June, 1796, may be seen the questions proposed by the President on the 18th of April, 1793, to the heads of the de∣partments. The undersigned minister plenipo∣tentiary contents himself with giving here an ex∣tract.</P>
<P>Question 2. Shall a minister from the Republic of France be received?</P>
<P>Question 3. If received, shall it be absolutely, or with qualifications, and if with qualifications, of what kind?</P>
<P>Question 4. Are the United States obliged by good faith, to consider the treaties heretofore made with France as applying to the present situation of the parties—may they either renounce them or hold them suspended, till the government of France shall be established?</P>
<P>Question 12. Should the future regent of France send a minister to the United States, ought he to be received?</P>
<P>(No. 7.) The French government, zealous of giving to the United States proofs of its attach∣ment, had commenced negociations with the re∣gency of Algiers, in order to put an end to the war which that power was making on the com∣merce
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
of the United States. The minister for foreign affairs, by a letter of the 5th January, 1794, instructed the predecessor of the undersign∣ed to communicate to the federal government the steps which the French government had taken in this respect. The predecessor of the undersigned in consequence wrote to the secretary of state, on the 16th Priareal in the 2d year, the following let∣ter—I have already had the pleasure, Sir, to in∣form you, verbally, of the interest which the com∣mittee of public safety of the national convention had early taken in the truly unhappy situation of your commerce in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>I now fulfil the duty imposed on me by the go∣vernment, by calling to your recollection in writ∣ing, the steps which are to be taken by our agent with the dey of Algiers, for repressing this new manoeuvre of the British administration, which has put the finishing stroke to its proofs of malevo∣lence towards free people. The dispatch of the minister communicating this measure to me, is dated the 5th January, and did not come to my hands till fifteen days ago; I do not yet know by what route; I could have wished it had been less tardy in coming to me, that I might sooner have fulfilled the agreeable task of proving to you by facts, the protestations of friendship of which I have so often spoken in the name of the Repub∣lic of France.</P>
<P>The information which I shall receive from Eu∣rope in a little time, will doubtless possess me of the success of those negociations which were to have been opened in January last. If the situa∣tion of your affairs is yet such with respect to that barbarous regency as that our intervention may be of some utility, I pray you to invite the presi∣sident to cause to be communicated to me the
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
means that he will join to those of the commitee of public safety, for the greatest success of the measures already taken. It is in virtue of the ex∣press request of the minister that I solicit of the president some communication on this subject; I shall be satisfied to be able to transmit it by a very early conveyance which I am now preparing for France.</P>
<P>The secretary of state replied to him on the 6th June, 1794, by a letter of which the following is an extract.</P>
<P>"Your other letter of the 4th of June, is a powerful demonstration of the interest which the Republic of France takes in our welfare. I will frankly communicate to you our measures and ex∣pectations with regard to Algiers; but as you will so soon receive the detail of those measures, which your government has pursued in our behalf, and after the rising of congress some new arrange∣ments will probably be adopted by the executive, it will be better perhaps to postpone our interview on this matter, until the intelligence, which you further expect, shall arrive."</P>
<P>Then Mr. Jay was charged to negociate with the British government—and that citizen Fauchet did not afterwards receive any communication on the subject.</P>
<P>(No. 8.) On the 13th Floreal in the 3d year of the Republic (2d May, 1794) the predecessor of the undersigned minister plenipotentiary ex∣pressed himself in these terms to the secretary of state upon the blockade of the French colonies.</P>
<P><Q>“After so many useless attempts, Sir, you must be sensible of the pain I experience in tracing this picture so different from that which the French Republic gives whenever justice towards you is in question, even though her interests are
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
compromitted. It was when a terrible war was incessantly devouring her, that she rigorously fulfilled her treaties with you; in this instance, she demands but justice, and cannot obtain it. On the conttary, she sees her enemies admitted to an intimacy with you, at the moment in which your commerce and your sovereignty are alike insulted by them; at the moment when adding derision to injustice they despoil you anew upon the seas, when they promise to in∣demnify you for former acts. This reflection, Sir, becomes more grievous when we see posted up under your eyes the official legalization of a proclamation, which prohibits your commerce with our colonies, and suspends to you alone the law of nations. I know, Sir, what respect imposes on me as to what immediately interests your affairs and your relations as a people. But I cannot entirely pass in silence transac∣tions to which the Republic is no stranger, be∣cause they are directed against her; and that to subscribe by an excess of courtesy to such or∣ders, were to quit the neutral position which the Americans profess. Examine I pray you, Sir, whether this neutrality can be said to ex∣ist, when on the one hand you can no longer maintain your treaties, and on the other, you are obliged to abandon your relations exclu∣sively to the discretion of England, who doubt∣less will soon declare all the universe blockad∣ed, except her possessions. What account do you conceive I can render to the French go∣vernment, of the means you take for rendering your neutrality respectable? Yet on that my in∣structions insist, and it is on that more especi∣ally ”that France is uneasy."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71"/>The secretary of state replied on the 29th May, 1795, to this passage of citizen Fauchet's letter in the following manner—</P>
<P><Q>"The predicament of a neutral nation is al∣ways peculiar and delicate, and eminently so, while it defends itself against charges of partial∣ity from one of the warring powers, lest it should seem to palliate the misdoings of ano∣ther. But you are not to infer, from any jus∣tification of the executive, that the validity of the proclamation of blockade is assented to. We did read on the 10th of April, 1795, a pub∣lication from his Britannic majesty's consul general for the middle and southern states of America, giving public notice that he had re∣ceived official communications, that the islands of Guadaloupe, Marigalante and Desirade were by proclamation issued by his Britannic majes∣ty's general and vice-admiral, commanding in the West-Indies, declared to be in an actual state of blockade; and that neutral vessels were by that proclamation prohibited from attempt∣ing to enter any of the ports or places of the said islands, with provisions or supplies of any nature or kind whatsoever, under the penalty of being "dealt with conformably to existing treaties, and as warranted by the established laws of nations." So highly valued has the West-Indian commerce always been, that this exclusion was often revolved in the mind of the executive. It was acknowledged, that neutrals are interdicted by the law of nations from a blockaded port. From some quarter or other blockade must be notified; or else neutrals would be a constant, unsuspecting prey; not being in a condition to collect this information for them∣selves. Who then are to notify the military
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
investment of a place? Surely not the be∣sieged, but the besiegers, whether we consult principle or practice. The check which neu∣trals have upon a wanton and false parade of a siege, is the same with the check upon any other groundless pretence. We might indeed have remonstrated; but with what colour may well be imagined, when this department was unpro∣vided with any document upon which the re∣scinding of that edict could have been urged. If rumour were a fit guide, who can pronounce, on which side rumour preponderated, when stripped of the exaggerations, which a host of passions had gathered together? We had, it may be said, one effort remaining; which was to promulge to the citizens of the United States, that the proclamation was null and void <HI>as to them</HI>. If after this defiance of that act, any American vessel had risked, and incurred confiscation, the government would have been importuned for something more than the <HI>general protection</HI>, which is the birth-right of all our citizens. The clamour would have been for a <HI>special indemnity;</HI> and under such a cloak, ”frauds innumerable might have been covered."</Q></P>
<P>(No. 9.) The Citizen Genet, one of the pre∣decessors of the undersigned, notified the secre∣tary of state on the 23d May, 1793, that he was empowered to renew the existing treaties between the French Republic and the United States. The secretary of state replied to him, that the senate not being assembled, it was impossible to meet his overtures, because that body were, according to the constitution, to participate in the consumma∣tion of treaties.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter from Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Morris, dated August 23d, 1793. Message of the president 3d December, 1793, p. 68 of the original English.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73"/>On the 30th of September, 1793, Citizen Ge∣net renewed the subject; the secretary of state, in acknowledging the receipt of that letter, in∣formed him that he had laid it before the presi∣dent, and that it will be taken into consideration with all the respect and interest that such an ob∣ject requires.</P>
<P>The senate assembled, and the treaty was ne∣ver again brought in question.</P>
<P>The predecessor of the undersigned, in his verbal communications with the secretary of state, expressed the desire which the Republic had of renewing her treaties. He received only evasive answers.</P>
<P>The undersigned minister plenipotentiary charg∣ed to prepare, with the federal government, the plan of a new treaty of commerce, communicat∣ed to the secretary of state, on the 30th June, 1795, (old style) that part of his instructions which authorized him to open the negociation.</P>
<P>On this subject the president authorised the se∣cretary of state, who explained to the undersign∣ed the manner in which they could proceed in it. But at what time? When the ratification of the treaty concluded between Lord Grenville and Mr. Jay no longer permitted the undersigned to pursue that negociation.</P>
