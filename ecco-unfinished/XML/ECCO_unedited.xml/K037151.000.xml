<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THESEUS,</HI> Duke of <HI>Athens,</HI> having brought the Princess
<HI>Hippolita</HI> from the <HI>Amazons,</HI> designs to marry her in a few
days. In the mean time <HI>Egeus,</HI> one of his courtiers, complains
to him of his daughter <HI>Hermia</HI>'s love to <HI>Lysander,</HI> and aversion
to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> for whom he intended her. <HI>Hermia</HI> refuses to
marry <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and the Duke allows her four days, either to
obey her father, to be put to death, or to vow perpetual cha∣stity.
<HI>Lysander</HI> persuades her to fly with him from <HI>Athens,</HI> and
marry him: She consents, and informs her friend <HI>Helena</HI> of
her design, who, out of dotage on <HI>Demetrius,</HI> acquaints him
with it. He pursues <HI>Hermia,</HI> and <HI>Helena</HI> follows him. Thus
they all meet at a wood, some little distance from <HI>Athens,</HI>
where they become liable to the power of the <HI>Fairies.
Oberon,</HI> King of the <HI>Fairies,</HI> and <HI>Titania</HI> his Queen, being
come to give a blessing to <HI>Theseus</HI>' wedding, quarrel about
an <HI>Indian</HI> boy, whom the Queen loved, to the raising <HI>Obe∣ron</HI>'s
jealousy. <HI>Oberon,</HI> in revenge, and to get the boy from
her, charms the Queen to be enamour'd of the first live
creature she should see, and sends <HI>Puck</HI> with the same charm
to force <HI>Demetrius</HI> to love <HI>Helena,</HI> but my mistake, <HI>Puck</HI>
charms <HI>Lysander,</HI> who then loaths <HI>Hermia,</HI> and becomes in
love with <HI>Helena. Oberon,</HI> seeing the mistake, charms <HI>De∣metrius,</HI>
who also falls in love with <HI>Helena.</HI> This produces
a quarrel; but the rivals are prevented fighting by the arti∣fice
of <HI>Puck. Oberon,</HI> having got the <HI>Indian</HI> boy, puts an
end to the charm that held the Queen enamoured of a clown:
The lovers being asleep are likewise freed from the power
of the charm. <HI>Theseus, Hippolita, Egeus, &amp;c.</HI> coming to
hunt in the Wood, find the four lovers sleeping; they are
waked with the sound of the horns, and <HI>Demetrius</HI> avowing
his love to <HI>Helena,</HI> and <HI>Lysander</HI> avowing his love to <HI>Hermia,</HI>
they are married at the same time with <HI>Theseus</HI> and <HI>Hip∣polita.</HI></P>
