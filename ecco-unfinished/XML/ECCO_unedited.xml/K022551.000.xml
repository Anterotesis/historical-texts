<HEAD>ACT I.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>SCENE</HI> A room in Mrs. <HI>Goodman</HI>'s house.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Molly,</HI> struggling with <HI>Spatter.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>BE quiet, Mr. Spatter! let me alone! Pray now, Sir! It is a strange thing a body can't go about the house without being pester'd with your impertinence—Why sure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Introduce me to your mistress then—come, there's a good girl!—and I will teaze you no longer▪</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I shan't—Introduce you to my lady! for what, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! for a thousand things. To laugh, to chat, to take a dish of tea, to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>You drink tea with my lady! I should not have thought of that—On what acquaintance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>The most agreeable in the world, child! a new acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you mistake yourself mightily—you are not a proper acquaintance for a person of her quality, I assure you, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what quality is she, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much too high quality for your ac∣quaintance, I promise you. What! a poet-man! that sits write, write, write, all day long, scribbling a pack of nonsense for the news-papers!—You're fit for nothing above a chambermaid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's as much as to say, that you think me just fit for you. Eh, child!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, not I, Sir. Neither my lady nor I will have any thing to say to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your mistress and you both give your∣selves a great many airs, my dear. Your poverty, I think, might pull down your pride.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does the fellow mean by poverty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean that you are starving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh the slanderous monster! We! Starv∣ing! Who told you so? I'd have you to know, Sir, my-lady-has a very great fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>So 'tis a sign, by her way of life and ap∣pearance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; she lives privately, indeed, be∣cause she loves retirement; she goes plain, be∣cause she hates dress; she keeps no table, because she is an enemy to luxury.—In short, my lady is as rich as a Jew, and you are an impertinent cox∣comb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come! I know more of your mistress than you imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do you know of her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I know what I know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! <STAGE>[alarme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know who she is, and where she came from; I am very well acquainted with her family, and know her whole history.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very easily—I have correspondence every where. As private as she may think herself, it is
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
not the first time that I have seen or heard of Amelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh gracious! as sure as I am alive this man will discover us. <STAGE>[apart.]</STAGE> Mr. Spatter, my dear Mr. Spatter, if you know any thing, sure you would not be so cruel as to betray us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Mr. Spatter! O ho! I have guess'd right—there is something then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, there is nothing at all; nothing that signifies to you or any body else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I'll say nothing; but then you must—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come; kiss me, hussy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say kiss you, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you'll introduce me to your mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, I promise you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no mysteries between you and me, child! Come; here's the key to all locks, the clue to every maze, and the discloser of all se∣crets; money, child! Here! take this purse; you see I know something; tell me the rest, and I have the fellow to it in my pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! poor Mr. Spatter! Where could you get all this money, I wonder! Not by your poetries, I believe. But what signifies tel∣ling you any thing, when you are acquainted with our whole history already? You have correspon∣dence every where, you know. There, Sir! take up your filthy purse again, and remember that I scorn to be obliged to any body but my mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's impudence for you! when to my certain knowledge your mistress has not a guinea in the world; you live in continual fear of being discovered; and you will both be utterly undone in a fortnight, unless Lord Falbridge should pre∣vent it, by taking Amelia under his protection. You understand me, child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>You scandalous wretch! Did you ever hear such a monster? I won't stay a moment longer with him—But you are quite mistaken about me and my mistress, I assure you, Sir. We are in the best circumstances in the world; we have nothing to fear; and we don't care a far∣thing for you.—So your servant, Mr. Poet! <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Spatter <HI>alone.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Your servant, Mrs. Pert! <Q>“We are in the best circumstances in the world.”</Q> Ay, that is as much as to say, they are in the utmost distress. "We have nothing to fear."—That is, they are frightened out of their wits.—<Q>“And we don't care a farthing for you.”</Q>—Meaning, that they will take all the care in their power, that I shall not find them out.—But I may be too hard for you yet, young gentlewoman! I have earned but a poor livelihood by mere scandal and abuse; but if I could once arrive at doing a little substantial mis∣chief, I should make my fortune.</P>
<STAGE>Enter Mrs. <HI>Goodman.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Oh! your servant, Mrs. Goodman! Your's is the most unsociable lodging-house in town. So many ladies, and only one gentleman! and you won't take the least notice of him.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, Mr. Spatter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, did not you promise to introduce me to Amelia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the plain truth, Mr. Spatter, she don't like you. And, indeed, I don't know how it is, but you make yourself a great many enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I believe I do raise a little envy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re mistaken, Sir. As you are a lodger of mine, it makes me quite un∣easy to hear what the world says of you. How do you contrive to make so many enemies, Mr. Spatter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I have merit, Mrs. Goodman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be so; but nobody will allow it but yourself. They say that you set up for a wit, indeed; but that you deal in nothing but scandal, and think of nothing but mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do speak ill of the men sometimes, to be sure; but then I have a great regard for wo∣men—provided they are handsome: and that I may give you a proof of it, introduce me to Amelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must excuse me; she and you would be the worst company in the world; for she never speaks too well of herself, nor the least ill of any body else. And then her virtue—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh, pooh, she speaks ill of nobody, because she knows nobody; and as for her virtue, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't believe much in that, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not over-much faith, Mrs. Good∣man. Lord Falbridge, perhaps, may give a bet∣ter account of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Falbridge can say nothing but what would be extremely to her honour, I assure you, Sir. <STAGE>[Spatter <HI>laughs.]</HI></STAGE> Well, well, you may laugh, but it is very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I don't doubt it; but you don't tell the whole truth, Mrs. Goodman. When any of your friends or acquaintance sit for their pictures, you draw a very flattering likeness. All charac∣ters have their dark side, and if they have but one eye, you give them in <HI>profile.</HI> Your great friend,
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
Mr. Freeport, for instan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> whom you are always praising for his benevolent actions—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is benevolence itself, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and grossness itself too. I remember him these many years. He always cancels an ob∣ligation by the manner of conferring it; and does you a favour, as if he were going to knock you down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce with your satire, good M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Spatter! Mr. Freeport is my best friend; I owe him every thing; and I can't endure the slightest reflection on his character. Besides, he can have given no offence to Lady Alton, whatever may be the case with Amelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Alton! she is a particular friend of mine to be sure; but between you and me, Mrs. Goodman, a more ridiculous character than any you have mentioned. A <HI>bel esprit</HI> forsooth! and as vain of her beauty as learning, without any great portion of either. A fourth Grace, and a tenth Muse! who fancies herself enamour'd of Lord Falbridge, because she would be proud of such a conquest; and has lately bestowed some marks of distinction on me, because she thinks it will give her credit among persons of letters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you can't spare your own friends, I don't wonder at your attacking mine—and so, Sir, your humble servant.—But stay! here's a post-chaise stopp'd at our door; and here comes a servant with a portmanteau! 'Tis the gen∣tleman for whom my first floor was taken, I sup∣pose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely: well, you will introduce me to him at least, Mrs. Goodman.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are Mrs. Goodman, I suppose, Madam?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Owen, I believe, has secured apart∣ments here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>He has, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are for me, Madam—Have you any other lodgers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only that gentleman, Sir; and a young lady—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of great beauty and virtue. Eh, Mrs. Goodman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has both, Sir; but you will see very little of her, for she lives in the most retired manner in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her youth and beauty are matter of great indifference to me; for I shall be as much a recluse as herself.—Are there any news at present stirring in London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Spatter can inform you, Sir, for he deals in news. In the mean while, I'll prepare your apartments. <STAGE>[Exit, followed by the servant.</STAGE></P>

<P>This must be a man of quality by his ill manners. I'll speak to him <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE> <STAGE>[to Sir <HI>William]</HI></STAGE> Will your Lordship give me leave—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lordship! I am no Lord, Sir, and must beg not to be honoured with the name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a kind of mistake, that cannot dis∣please at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that. None but a fool would be vain of a title, if he had one; and none but an impostor would assume a title, to which he has no right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you're of the House of Commons then, a member of parliament, and are come up to town to attend the sessions, I suppose, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter what I am, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no offence, I hope, Sir. All I meant was to do you honour. Being concerned in two evening<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> posts and one morning-paper, I was willing to know the proper manner of announcing your arrival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have connections with the press then, it seems, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; I am an humble retainer to the Muses, an author. I compose pamphlets on all subjects, compile magazines, and do news-papers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Do</HI> news-papers! What do you mean by that, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, Sir, I collect the articles of news from the other papers and make new ones for the postscript, translate the mails, write occasional letters from Cato and Theatricus, and give fictitious answers to supposed correspondents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very ingenious as well as honourable employment, I must confess, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some little genius is requisite, to be sure. Now, Sir, if I can be of any use to you—if you have any friend to be praised, or any enemy to be abused; any author to cry up, or minister to run down; my pen and talents are entirely at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much obliged to you, Sir, but at present I have not the least occasion for either▪ In return for your genteel offers, give me leave to trouble you with one piece of advice▪ Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

you deal in private scandal, have a care of the cudgel; and when you meddle with publick matters, beware of the pillory?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir! are you no friend to litera∣ture? Are you an enemy to the liberty of the press?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have the greatest respect for both; but railing is the disgrace of letters, and personal abuse the scandal of freedom: foul-mouthed criticks, are in general disappointed authors; and they, who are the loudest against ministers, only mean to be paid for their silence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be sometimes, Sir; but give me leave to ask you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not ask me at present, Sir! I see a particular friend of mine coming this way, and I must beg you to withdraw!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Withdraw, Sir! first of all, allow me to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no reply! we must be in private. <STAGE>[Thrusting out <HI>Spatter.]</HI></STAGE> What a wretch! as con∣temptible as mischievous. Our generous mastiffs fly at men from an instinct of courage; but this fellow's attacks proceed from an instinct of base∣ness—But here comes the faithful Owen, with▪as many good qualities as that execrable fellow seems to have bad ones.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Owen.</STAGE>
<P>Well Owen; I am safe arrived you fee.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Owen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir! would to heaven you were as safe returned again! Have a care of betraying yourself to be Sir William Douglas!—During you stay here, your name is Ford, remember.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall take care—But tell me your news—What have you done since your arrival? Have you heard any thing of my daughter? Have

you seen Lord Brumpton? Has he any hope of obtaining my pardon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Owen.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what can have destroyed it then?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Owen.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord Brumpton is dead, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dead!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Owen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw him within this week in apparent good health; he promised to exert his whole inte∣rest in your favour: by his own appointment I went to wait on him yesterday noon, when I was stunned with the news of his having died suddenly the evening before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord Brumpton dead! the only friend I had remaining in England; the only per∣son, on whose intercession I relied for my pardon. Cruel fortune! I have now no hope but to find my daughter. Tell me, Owen; have you been able to hear any tidings of her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Owen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, Sir, none that are satisfactory. On the death of Mr. Andrews, in whose care you left her, being cruelly abandoned by the relation who succeeded to the estate, she left the country some months ago, and has not since been heard of.</P>
</SP>

<P>Unhappy there too! When will the measure of my misfortunes be full? When will the malice of my fate be satisfied? Proscribed, condemned, attainted, (alas, but too justly!) I have lost my rank, my estate, my wife, my son, and all my family. One only daughter remains. Perhaps a wretched wanderer like myself, perhaps in the extremest indigence, perhaps dishonoured—Ha! that thought distracts me.</P>

<P>My dear master, have patience! Do not be ingenious to torment yourself, but consult your safety, and prepare for your departure.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Owen. Hearing, providentially, of the death of my friend Andrews, paternal care and tenderness drew me hither; and I will not
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
quit the kingdom till I learn something of my child, my dear Amelia, whom I left a tender in∣nocent in the arms of the best of women twenty years ago. Her sex demands protection; and she is now of an age, in which she is more exposed to misfortunes than even in helpless infancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Owen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be advised; depart, and leave that care to me. Consider; your life is now at stake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>My life has been too miserable to ren∣der me very sollicitous for its preservation—But the complection of the times is changed; the very name of the party, in which I was unhappily en∣gaged, is extinguished, and the whole nation is unanimously devoted to the throne. Disloyalty and insurrection are now no more, and the sword of justice is suffered to sleep. If I can find my child, and find her worthy of me, I will fly with her to take refuge in some foreign country; if I am discovered in the search, I have still some hopes of mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Owen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven grant your hopes may be well founded!</P>

<P>Ah, my dear mistress, it is to no pur∣pose to endeavour to hide it from the world. They will see poverty in my looks. As for you, you can live upon the air; the greatness of your soul seems to support you; but lack-a-day, I shall grow thinner and thinner every day of my life.</P>

<P>I can support my own distress, but yours touches me to the soul.

Let us be obliged to nobody, but owe our support to in∣dustry and virtue.</P>

<P>You're an angel: let me kiss those dear hands that have worked this precious embroidery; let me bathe them with my tears! You're an angel upon earth. I had rather starve in your service, than live with a princess. What can I do to com∣fort you?</P>

<P>Come, come; you must not indulge this melancholy. I have a new lodger, an elderly gentleman, just arrived, who does me the honour to partake of my dinner; and I must have your company too.

<P>A person of honour, and openly receive visits from men! seduce Lord Falbridge! No, no: reserve this character for your next novel, Mr. Spatter! it is an affront to my understanding.

<P>I, Madam! Neither her beauty, nor her virtue—</P>

<P>Her beauty! her virtue! Why, thou wretch, thou grub of literature, whom I as a pa∣troness of learning and encourager of men of let∣ters, willing to blow the dead coal of genius, fondly took under my protection, do you remem∣ber what I have done for you?</P>

<P>With the utmost gratitude, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not I draw you out of the garret, where you daily spun out your flimsy brain to catch the town flies in your cobweb dissertations? Did not I introduce you to Lord Dapperwit, the Apollo of the age? And did not you dedicate your silly volume of poems on several occasions to him? Did not I put you into the list of my visitors, and order my porter to admit you at dinner-time? Did not I write the only scene in your execrable farce, which the audience vouchsafed an hearing? And did not my female friend, Mrs. Melpomene, fur∣nish you with Greek and Latin mottoes for your twopenny essays?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge all your Ladyship's good∣ness to me. I have done every thing in my power to shew my gratitude, and fulfill your Ladyship's commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Words, words, Mr. Spatter! You have been witness of Lord Falbridge's inconstancy. A perfidious man! False as Phaon to Sappho, or Jason to Medea! You have seen him desert me for a wretched vagabond; you have seen me aban∣doned like Calypso, without making a single ef∣fort to recall my faithless Ulysses from the Siren that has lired him from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be calm but one moment, Madam, and I'll—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bid the sea be calm, when the winds are let loose upon it. I have reason to be enraged. I placed you in genteel apartments in this house, merely to plant you as a spy; and what have you done for me? Have you employed your corre∣spondence to any purpose? or discovered the real character of this infamous woman, this insolent Amelia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have taken every possible method to de∣tect her. I have watched Amelia herself like a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailiff, or a Duenna; I have overheard private
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
conversations; have sounded the landlady; tam∣pered with the servants; opened letters; and in∣tercepted messages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good creature! my best Spatter! And what? what have you discovered?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Amelia is a native of Scotland; that her surname <HI>Walton</HI> is probably not real, but as∣sumed; and that she earnestly wishes to conceal both the place of her birth and her family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is that all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that I have been able to learn as yet, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wretch! of what service have you been then? Are these your boasted talents? When we want to unravel an ambiguous character, you have made out that she wishes to lie concealed; and when we wish to know who she is, you have just discovered that she is a native of Scotland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet if you will give me leave, Ma∣dam, I think I could convince you that these dis∣coveries, blind and unsatisfactory as they may ap∣pear to you at first, are of no small consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what consequence can they possibly be to me, man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you, Madam. It is a rule in po∣liticks, when we discover something, to add some∣thing more. Something added to something, makes a good deal; upon this basis I have formed a syl∣logism.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does the pedant mean? A syllo∣gism!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, a syllogism: as for example; Any person who is a native of Scotland, and wishes to be concealed, must be an enemy to the govern∣ment. Amelia is a native of Scotland, and wishes to be concealed. <HI>Ergo,</HI> Amelia is an enemy to the government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excellent! admirable logick! but I wish we could prove it to be truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not lay a wager of the truth of it; but I would swear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, on a proper occasion, and in 2 proper place, my good Spatter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Willingly; we must make use of what we know, and even of what we don't know. Truth is of a dry and simple nature, and stands in need of some little ornament. A lie, indeed, is infa∣mous; but fiction, your Ladyship, who deals in poetry, knows is beautiful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the substance of your fiction, Spatter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will lodge an information that the father of Amelia is a disaffected person, and has sent her to London for treasonable purposes: nay, I can upon occasion even suppose the father himself to be in London: in consequence of which you will probably recover Lord Falbridge, and Amelia will be committed to prison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have given me new life. I took you for a mere stainer of paper; but I have found you a Machiavel.—I hear somebody coming.—Mrs. Goodman has undertaken to send Amelia hither. Ha! she's here—Away Spatter, and wait for me at my house: you must dine with me; and after dinner, like true politicians, we will settle our plan of operations over our coffee. Away, away this instant! <STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> Spatter▪</STAGE></P>

are publick advertisements of their qualifications; and when they profess to live upon scandal, it is as much as to say, that they are ready for every other dirty work, in which we chuse to employ them.—But now for Amelia: if she proves trac∣table, I may forego the use of this villain, who almost makes me hate my triumph, and be ashamed of my revenge.</P>

<P>To impose upon! I scorn the imputation, and am sorry to find that your Ladyship came hi∣ther,

<P>Pride and poverty! A sad composition, Mrs. Goodman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; her pride is one of her greatest virtues: it consists in depriving herself of almost all necessaries, and concealing it from the world. Tho' every action speaks her to be a
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
woman of birth and education, she lives upon the work of her own hands without murmur or com∣plaint. I make use of a thousand stratagems to assist her against her will; I prevail on her to keep the money due for rent for her support, and fur∣nish her with every thing she wants at half its prime cost; but if she perceives or suspects these little artifices, she takes it almost as ill as if I had at∣tempted to defraud her. In short, Sir, her un∣shaken virtue and greatness of soul under mis∣fortunes, make me consider her as a prodigy, and often draw tears of pity and admiration from me.</P>
</SP>

<P>Ah! women's tears lie very near their eyes. I never cried in my life; and yet I can feel too; I can admire, I can esteem, but what signifies whimpering? Hark ye, Mrs. Goodman!

<P>I tell you what, young woman; I am a plain man, and will tell you my mind in an instant. I am told that you are one of the best women in the world; very virtuous, and very poor; I like

<P>Mrs. Goodman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has deceived you, Sir; not in regard to my pride perhaps, for there is a certain right pride which every body, especially women, ought to possess! and as to virtue, it is no more than my duty; but as to poverty, I disclaim it; they who want nothing, cannot be said to be poor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is no such thing: you don't speak the truth; and that is worse than being proud. I know very well that you are as poor as Job, that you are in want of common necessaries, and don't make a good meal above once in a fortnight.</P>

<P>But however, Madam, proud or not proud, does not signify two-pence.—Hark ye, young woman! it is a rule with me (as it ought to be with every good Christian) to give a tenth part of my fortune in charity. In the account of my profits there stands at present the sum of two thousand pounds on the credit side of my books; so that I am two hundred pounds in arrear. This I look upon as a debt due from my fortune to your poverty—Yes, your poverty I say, so never deny it. There's a bank note for two hundred pounds; and now I am out of your debt.—Where the deuce is this tea, I wonder?</P>

<P>Lord, Madam! you are ten times stranger than the gentleman.—I tell you what, Sir; <STAGE><HI>[to</HI> Freeport]</STAGE> it does not signify talking; we are in the greatest distress in the world, and if it had not been for the kindness and good-nature of Mrs. Goodman, we might have died by this time. My lady has concealed her distress from every body that was willing and able to relieve her; you have come to the knowledge of it in spite of her teeth; and I hope that you will oblige her, in spite of her teeth, to accept of your generous offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more, my dear Polly; if you would not have me die with shame, say no more! Return the gentleman his note with my best thanks for his kindness; tell him, I durst not accept of it; for when a woman receives presents from a man, the world will always suspect that she pays for them a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the expence of her virtue.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>THANKS, my good Spatter, many thanks for this precious epistle! more precious at present than one of Ovid, Pliny, or Cicero. It is at once a billet-doux and a state paper; and serves at the same time to convict her of conspiring against me and the publick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a valuable manuscript, to be sure, Madam; and yet that is but the least half of my discoveries, since I left your ladyship.</P>

<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more certain. He arrived this morning under a feigned name. I saw him con∣ducted to Amelia's apartment. This raised my suspicion, and I planted myself at her door, with all the circumspection of a spy, and address of a chambermaid. There I overheard their mutual acknowledgments of each other; and a curious interview it was. First they wept for grief; and then they wept for joy; and then they wept for grief again. Their tears, however, were soon in∣terrupted by the arrival of the officer, whose pur∣pose was partly defeated, as you have already heard, by the intervention of Freeport.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Alt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the brute! But that delay was not half so unfortunate, as your discoveries have been happy, Spatter; for my revenge shall now return on them with redoubled fury.—Issue out upon them once more; see what they are about; and be sure to give me immediate notice if Lord Falbridge should come. <STAGE>[Going.</STAGE></P>

<P>Stay, Madam.

Suppose you step into the study, till I return. You will find my own answer to my last pam∣phlet, and the two first sheets of the next month's Magazine to amuse you.</P>

<SP>

<P>Planned like a wise general! Do you then go, and <HI>reconnoitre</HI> the enemy, while I lie here in ambush to reinforce you as soon as there shall be occasion. Do but give the word, we'll make a vigorous sally, put their whole body to rout, and take Amelia and her father prisoners.</P>

He has so good a heart, that I believe it is impossible even for a title to corrupt it.

<P>Hush, my Lord! Speak lower, for hea∣ven's sake! My mistress has so often forbad me to tell any thing about her, that I tremble still at the thoughts of the confidence I have put in you. I was bewitched, I think, to let you know who she was.</P>

<P>Indeed, my Lord, I never received any letter from you.</P>

<P>Not received any! I sent it this very morning. My own servant was the messenger. What can this mean? Has he betrayed me?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Lord; you have discovered me, it is true: I am the daughter of Sir William Douglas. Judge for yourself then; and think how I ought to look upon a man, who has insulted my distress, and endeavouted to tempt me to disho∣nour my family.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your justice must acquit me of the in∣tention of that offence, since at that time I was ignorant of your illustrious extraction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so; yet your excuse is but an aggravation of the crime. You imagined me, per∣haps, to be of as low and mean an origin, as you thought me poor and unhappy. You supposed that I had no title to any dowry but my honour, no de∣pendance but on my virtue; and yet you attempted to rob me of that virtue, which was the only jewel that could raise the meanness of my birth, or sup∣port me under my misfortunes; which, instead of

<P>The change of my sentiments needs no excuse from me, Madam; you were yourself the occasion of it.—In spite of the torrent of fashion, and the practice of too many others of my rank in life, I have a relish for domestick happiness; and have always wished for a wife, who might render my home a delightful refuge from the cares and bustle of the world abroad.

<P>How happy has this reverse of fortune made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e!—But my surprise is almost equal to my joy. May we beg you, Sir, <STAGE><HI>[to</HI> Freeport]</STAGE> to in∣form us how your benevolence has effected what seems almost a miracle in my favour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>In two words then, Sir William, this happy event is chiefly owing to your old friend, the late Lord Brumpton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Brumpton!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; honest Owen there told me, that
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
his Lordship had been employed in solliciting your pardon. Did not you, Owen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Owen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon hearing that, and perceiving the danger you were in, I went immediately to the present Lord Brumpton; who is a very honest fel∣low, and one of the oldest acquaintance I have in the world. He, at my instance, immediately made the necessary application; and guess how agree∣ably we were surprised to hear that the late Lord had already been successful, and that the pardon had been made out, on the very morning of the day his Lordship died. Away went I, as fast as a pair of horses could carry me, to fetch it; and should cer∣tainly have prevented this last arrest, if the warrant to apprehend you, as dangerous persons, had not if∣sued under your assumed names of William Ford and Amelia Walton, against whom the information had been laid. But, however, it has only served to prevent your running away, when the danger was over, for at present, Sir William, thank heaven and his majesty, you are a whole man again; and you have nothing to do but to make a legal appearance, and to plead the pardon I have brought you, to absolve you from all informa∣tions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou honest excellent man! How hap∣pily have you supplied, what I failed to accom∣plish!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I heard that your Lordship had been busy.—You had more friends at Court than one, Sir William, I promise you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am overwhelmed with my sudden good fortune, and am poor even in thanks. Teach me, Mr. Freeport, teach me how to make some acknowledgement for your extraordinary genero∣sity!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you what, Sir William. Not∣withstanding your daughter's pride, I took a liking to her, the moment I saw her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! What's this!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing. Go on, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, to confess the truth, I am afraid that my benevolence, which you have all been pleased to praise so highly, had some little leaven of self-interest in it; and I was desirous to promote Amelia's happiness more ways than one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am the veriest wretch that ever existed.—But take her, Sir! for I must confess that you have deserved her by your proceedings; and that I, fool and villain that I was, have for∣feited her by mine. <STAGE>[going.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold! one word before you go, if you please, my Lord! You may kill yourself for aught I know, but you shan't lay your death at my door, I promise you. I had a kindness for A∣melia, I must confess; but in the course of my late negotiation for Sir William, hearing of your Lordship's pretensions, I dropt all thoughts of her. It is a maxim with me, to do good wherever I can, but always to abstain from doing mischief.—Now as I can't make the lady happy myself, I would fain put her into the hands of those that can.—So, if you would oblige me, Sir William, let me join these two young folks together, <STAGE>[join∣ing their hands]</STAGE> and do you say Amen to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart!—You can have no objection, Amelia. <STAGE>[Amelia bursts into tears.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>How bitterly do those tears reproach me! It shall be the whole business of my future life to atone for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your actions this day, and your solicitude for my father, have redeemed you in my good opi∣nion;
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>
and the consent of Sir William, seconded by so powerful an advocate as Mr. Freeport, can∣not be contended with. Take my hand, my Lord! a virtuous passion may inhabit the purest breast; and I am not ashamed to confess, that I had conceived a partiality for you, till your own conduct turned my heart against you; and if my resentment has given you any pain, when I consi∣der the occasion, I must own that I cannot repent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mention it no more, my love, I be∣seech you! You may justly blame your lover, I confess; but I will never give you cause to com∣plain of your husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe you will. I give you joy, my Lord! I give you all joy. As for you, Ma∣dam, <STAGE>[to Amelia]</STAGE> do but shew the world that you can bear prosperity, as well as you have sustained the shocks of adversity, and there are few women, who may not wish to be an Amelia.</P>
