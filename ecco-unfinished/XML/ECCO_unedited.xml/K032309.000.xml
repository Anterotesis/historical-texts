<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>MY LORD,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Kind Reception this Play has met with from the Town, gives me some Hopes of Your Lord∣ship's Acceptance, since amongst our <HI>English</HI> Noblemen none is more conspicuously grac'd with those Qualifications that render a Soul truly Generous, than Your Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip's; You have given the World sufficient Proof that You prefer the Service of Your Country to any Plea∣sure whatsoever; in You, the Peer is shown without the Vanity, and the Inherent Virtue without the common Vice; the Actions of Your Life File the Teeth of Satyr, as much as others give 'em an Edge; Strangers Admire, while Friends Adore Your Conduct.</P>
<P>The Design of this Piece were to divert, without that Vicious Strain which usually attends the Comick Muse, and according to the first intent of Plays, recommend Mora∣lity,
<PB REF="5"/>
and I hope I have in some measure, perform'd it; I dare affirm there is nothing Immodest, nor immoral in it; part of it I own my self oblig'd to the <HI>French</HI> for particular∣ly the Character of the <HI>Gamester;</HI> but he is intirely ru∣in'd in the <HI>French:</HI> whereas I, in Complaisance to the many fine Gentlemen that Play in <HI>England</HI>, have reclaim'd him, after I have discover'd the ill Consequence of Gaming, that very often happen to those who are too passi∣onately fond of it; I shall not inlarge upon the Altera∣tions, but refer Your Lordship to the Original, who are a perfect Master in that Tongue.</P>
<P>I heartily wish all Men of Rank and Quality as indif∣ferent to this bewitching Diversion of Gameing as Your Lordship; then wou'd the Distress'd be reliev'd, the Poor supported, and the Virtuous encourag'd, which would di∣stinguish our Nobility as much above our Neighbours, as their Heroick Deeds have done.</P>
<P>But You, My Lord, pursue a Nobler End, and have chose rather to stain the Field with the Blood of Your Nation's Enemies, than encrease Your Fortune by ano∣ther's Ruin; or expose Your Own to the Hazardous Die, a Resolution worthy of Your Birth and Fortune: And that You may live to be a Terrour to our Foes, and a Succour to Your Country, in perfect Health and Happiness, till Your Dearest Friends consent to part with You, are the Humble Wishes of</P>

<P>Why then, to be serious, my Master is not come in: He's a Man of Business, Child, and neglects his Ease to follow that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Fav.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I guess the Business; he is at shaking his Elbows over a Table; saying his Prayers backwards; courting the Dice like a Mistress, and cursing them when he is disappointed. Between you and I, <HI>Angelica</HI> knows his Extravagance; and finding he breaks all the Oaths he made against Play, resolves to see him no more.</P>

<P>He handsome! Behold his Picture just as he'll ap∣pear this Morning, with Arms a-cross, down-cast Eyes, no Powder in his Perriwig; a Steenkirk tuck'd in to hide the Dirt, Sword-knot unty'd; no Gloves, and Hands and Face as dirty as a Tinker. This is the very Figure of your beautiful Master.</P>

<P>Aye, 'tis no matter for that; I'll take care he shan't deceive my Mistress: For she that marries a Gamester that plays upon the Square, as the Fool your Master do's, can expect nothing but an Alms-House for a Jointure.

<HEAD>THE EPILOGUE, Spoke by Mr. <HI>VERBRƲGGEN</HI>.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AS one Condemn'd, and ready to become</L>
<L>For his Offences past, a Pendulum;</L>
<L>Does, e'er he Dies, bespeak the Learned Throng,</L>
<L>Then, like the Swan, Expires in a Song.</L>
<L>So, I (tho' doubtful long which Knot to choose.</L>
<L>Whether the Hangman's, or the Marriage Noose)</L>
<L>Condemn'd Good People, as you see, for Life</L>
<L>To Play that tedious, jangling Game a Wife,</L>
<L>Have but one Word of good Advice to say,</L>
<L>Before the doleful Cart draws quite away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You Roaring Boys, who know the Midnight Cares</L>
<L>Of Rattling Tatts, ye Sons of Hopes and Fears;</L>
<L>Who Labour hard to bring your Ruin on,</L>
<L>And diligently toil to be undone;</L>
<L>You're Fortune's sporting Footballs at the best,</L>
<L>Few are his Joys, and small the Gamester's Rest:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="77"/>
<L>Suppose then Fortune only rules the Dice,</L>
<L>And on the Square you Play; yet, who that's Wise</L>
<L>Wou'd to the Credit of a Faithless Main</L>
<L>Trust his good Dad's hard-gotten hoarded Gain?</L>
<L>But then such Vultures round a Table wait,</L>
<L>And hovouring watch the Bubble's sickly State;</L>
<L>The young fond Gambler covetous of more,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Esop</HI>'s Dog, loses his certain Store.</L>
<L>Then the Spunge squeez'd by all, grows dry,— And now</L>
<L>Compleatly Wretched, turns a Sharper too;</L>
<L>These Fools for want of Bubbles too, play Fair,</L>
<L>And Lose to one another on the Square;</L>
<L>So Whores the Wealth from numerous Culls they Glean,</L>
<L>Still Spend on Ballies, and grow poor again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Itch for day has likewise fatal been,</L>
<L>And more than <HI>Cupid</HI>, drawn the Ladies in,</L>
<L>A Thousand Guineas for <HI>Basset</HI> prevails,</L>
<L>A Bait when Cash runs low, that seldom fails;</L>
<L>And when the Fair One can't the Debt defray,</L>
<L>In Sterling Coin, does Sterling Beauty pay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain we Labour to divert your Care,</L>
<L>Nor Song, nor Dance can Bribe your Presence here,</L>
<L>You fly this Place like an Infectious Air.</L>
<L>To yonder happy Quarter of the Town,</L>
<L>You Croud; and your own Fav'rite Stage disown;</L>
<L>We're like old Mistresses, you love the Vice,</L>
<L>And hate us only 'cause we once did Please,</L>
<L>Nor can we find how else 'tis we Deserve,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Tantalus</HI> 'midst Plenty, thus to Starve.</L>
