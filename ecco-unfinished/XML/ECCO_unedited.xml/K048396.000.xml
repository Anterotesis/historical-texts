<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Beg leave to present to
your <HI>Lordship</HI> this
Treatise, which, while
in <HI>Manuscript,</HI> you so
kindly and warmly
desired to see in <HI>Print.</HI>
The chief Design of these Sheets is to
recommend to my Fellow Creatures
that plain <HI>Diet</HI> which is most agreeable
to the Purity and Simplicity of uncor∣rupted
<HI>Nature,</HI> and unconquer'd <HI>Reason.</HI>
Ill would it suit, <HI>my Lord,</HI> with such
a Design to introduce it with a Dedi∣cation
<PB REF="3"/>
cook'd up to the Height of a
<HI>French</HI> or <HI>Italian</HI> Taste. Addresses of
this Kind are generally a Sort of <HI>Ra∣gous</HI>
and <HI>Olios,</HI> compounded of Ingre∣dients
as pernicious to the Mind as such
unnatural Meats are to the Body. Ser∣vile
Flattery, fulsome Compliments,
and <HI>bombast Panegyrick</HI> make up the
<HI>nauseous</HI> Composition. But I know
that your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s Taste is too deli∣cate,
and your Judgment too chaste to
be able to bear such <HI>Cookery.</HI> Your
taking these Sheets into your Patronage
will probably be a Post not to be main∣tained
without some Difficulty. <HI>Pre∣judice,
Interest,</HI> and <HI>Appetite</HI> are power∣ful
Antagonists, which nothing but
good Sense, solid Virtue, and true
<HI>Christian</HI> Courage are capable of op∣posing.
Was not your <HI>Lordship</HI> emi∣nently
endued with those invaluable
Qualities, I should not have been so
fond of thrusting this, almost <HI>Orphan-Work</HI>
out into the World under your
safe Conduct. But your Practice, <HI>my
Lord,</HI> has long engaged you on the
<PB REF="4"/>
Side of Temperance, Sobriety, and
Virtue, and I hope you will not think
it a disagreeable Task to avow and
justify those Principles to the Publick,
by which you have hitherto been guided
so much to your Advantage in private.
I dare assert, <HI>my Lord,</HI> that in defend∣ing
this Cause you will fight under the
Banner of Truth: and be the Opposition
of Prejudice, Error, or Malice, ever so
mighty, I know that Patience and Per∣severance
will be sufficient to render the
Conquest secure. The promoting, ac∣cording
to my best Abilities, the Ease,
Health, and Welfare of Mankind in ge∣neral,
and of my fellow-suffering <HI>Vale∣tudinarians</HI>
in particular, has been the
whole and sole View with which I have
once more dared to appear in <HI>Print.</HI>
Your Love of the Design will, I hope,
make you blind to the Imperfections
and Weakness of the Execution. The
Protection of such a Work, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
is properly yours. Your <HI>Humanity</HI> and
<HI>Benevolence</HI> are always engaging you
in the Pursuit of the same Ends, tho'
<PB REF="5"/>
by different means. If you still think,
after a mature Revisal of these Papers,
that these my poor Endeavours may be
useful to the <HI>Publick,</HI> I know you will
be their generous Advocate, merely
upon Principle, and even in Opposition
to Party. The Continuance of your
Approbation will give me a most sincere
Pleasure, as your Condescension in per∣mitting
me to do myself this <HI>Honour,</HI>
will always be esteemed one of the many
Obligations you have so kindly conferred
on,</P>

Most Obliged, Faithful,
Humble Servant,

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Title <HI>I have chosen for
this</HI> Treatise, <HI>is a</HI> Re∣proach
<HI>universally thrown
on this</HI> Island <HI>by Foreign∣ers,
and all our Neighbours on the</HI> Con∣tinent,
<HI>by whom</HI> nervous <HI>Distempers,</HI>
Spleen, Vapours, <HI>and</HI> Lowness of Spi∣rits,
<HI>are in Derision, called the ENG∣LISH
MAL ADY. And I wish
there were not so good Grounds for this
Reflection. The</HI> Moisture <HI>of our</HI> Air,
<HI>the Variableness of our</HI> Weather, (<HI>from
our Situation amidst the</HI> Ocean) <HI>the</HI>
Rankness <HI>and</HI> Fertility <HI>of our Soil, the</HI>
Richness <HI>and</HI> Heaviness <HI>of our Food,
<PB N="ii" REF="7"/>
the</HI> Wealth <HI>and</HI> Abundance <HI>of the In∣habitants
(from their universal Trade)
the</HI> Inactivity <HI>and</HI> sedentary <HI>Occupations
of the better Sort (among whom this</HI>
Evil <HI>mostly rages) and the Humour of
living in great populous and conse∣quently
unhealthy Towns, have brought
forth a</HI> Class <HI>and</HI> Set <HI>of Distempers,
with atrocious and frightful</HI> Symptoms,
<HI>scarce known to our Ancestors, and never
rising to such fatal</HI> Heights, <HI>nor afflicting
such</HI> Numbers <HI>in any other known Na∣tion.
These</HI> nervous <HI>Disorders being
computed to make almost one</HI> third <HI>of the
Complaints of the People of</HI> Condition
<HI>in</HI> England.</P>
<P>II. THIS Work <HI>has lain finish'd by
me, as it now appears (at least in the
main) these several Years past, and
was intended as a</HI> Legacy <HI>and</HI> Dying-Speech,
<HI>only to my</HI> Fellow-Sufferers
<HI>under these Complaints. And had
certainly never appear'd (till its Au∣thor
had disappear'd) had it not been
for the perhaps indiscreet</HI> Zeal <HI>of
<PB N="iii" REF="8"/>
some of my warmest Friends, who
(upon the late Frequency and daily
Encrease of wanton and uncommon
Self-murderers, produc'd mostly by this</HI>
Distemper, <HI>and their</HI> blasphemous <HI>and</HI>
frantick Apologies <HI>grafted on the Prin∣ciples
of the</HI> Infidels, <HI>and propagated by
their</HI> Disciples) <HI>extorted it from me,
to try what a little more just and solid</HI>
Philosophy, <HI>join'd to a Method of</HI> Cure,
<HI>and proper Medicines could do, to put
a Stop to so universal a</HI> Lunacy <HI>and</HI>
Madness.</P>
<P>III. SOME <HI>good natur'd and inge∣nious
Retainers to the</HI> Profession, <HI>on
my Publication of my</HI> Book <HI>of</HI> long Life
and Health, <HI>proclaim'd every where
that I was turn'd mere</HI> Enthusiast, <HI>and
resolv'd all Things into</HI> Allegory <HI>and</HI>
Analogy, <HI>advis'd People to turn</HI>
Monks, <HI>to run into Desarts, and to
live on</HI> Roots, Herbs <HI>and</HI> wild Fruits;
<HI>in fine, that I was at Bottom a mere</HI>
Leveller, <HI>and for destroying</HI> Order,
Ranks <HI>and</HI> Property, <HI>every one's but
<PB N="iv" REF="9"/>
my own. But that Sneer had its
Day, and vanish'd into Smoak. Others
swore I had eaten my</HI> Book, <HI>recanted
my</HI> Doctrine <HI>and</HI> System <HI>(as they were
pleased to term it) and was returned
again to the</HI> Devil, <HI>the</HI> World <HI>and the</HI>
Flesh <HI>This Joke I have also stood.
I have been slain again and again, both
in</HI> Verse <HI>and</HI> Prose; <HI>but I thank GOD
I am still alive and well.</HI></P>
<P>IV. BUT <HI>to cut off all Occasions of
Mistake, and every Handle of Misre∣presentation
of my Meaning and Inten∣tion,
as far as in me lies, I here
solemnly declare it, as my</HI> Judgment
<HI>and</HI> Opinion (<HI>if it be worth the know∣ing)
founded on the Experience and
Observation of many Years:</HI> 1st, <HI>That
the</HI> Diet <HI>and</HI> Manner of Living <HI>of the
middling Rank, who are but moderate
and temperate in Foods of the common
and natural Product of the Country,</HI>
to wit <HI>in</HI> animal Foods <HI>plainly dress'd,
and Liquors purify'd by</HI> Fermentation
<HI>only, without the</HI> Tortures of the Fire,
<PB N="v" REF="10"/>
or without being turned into Spirits, <HI>is
that intended by the Author of Nature
for this</HI> Climate <HI>and</HI> Country, <HI>and
consequently the most wholesome and
fittest in general, for</HI> prolonging Life,
<HI>and</HI> preventing Distempers, <HI>that the</HI>
Ends of Providence <HI>and the</HI> Conditions
<HI>of</HI> Mortality <HI>will admit.</HI> 2dly, <HI>That
no</HI> wise Man, <HI>who is but moderate and
temperate in this manner, ought</HI> on any
Account <HI>to alter the Kind and Quality
of his</HI> Diet <HI>while his</HI> Health <HI>and</HI> Ap∣petite
<HI>are good.</HI> 3dly, <HI>That</HI> no wise
Man, <HI>even when he has fallen into, or
is threatened with a</HI> Distemper, <HI>ought
to change the</HI> Quality <HI>of his</HI> Diet, <HI>till
he has duly and sufficiently try'd, what</HI>
proper Medicines <HI>can do, by the Advice
of the most experienced and knowing</HI>
Physicians. 4. <HI>That the Changes that
are advis'd to be made, ought to be
duly and maturely consider'd, and enter'd
upon by</HI> Degrees, <HI>whether from a</HI> higher
<HI>to a</HI> lower, <HI>or from a</HI> lower <HI>to a</HI> higher
Diet. 5. <HI>That strong high</HI> animal
Foods <HI>and</HI> generous defecated spirituous
<PB N="vi" REF="11"/>
Liquors, <HI>as begetting warm, full, and
enliven'd Juices, urgeing on the Cir∣culation
with Force, and the Secre∣tions
with Vigour, in young, robust,
healthy Constitutions, are fittest and
most effectual for Mechanical and ani∣mal
Strength, Force, Action and
Labour: And so absolutely necessary for
Handy-Crafts, great Fatigue, and mili∣tary
Prowess. But these are not the
Matter in Question here, which is
about preventing and cureing Distem∣pers
already brought on, brightening
the Faculties, and fitting them for intel∣lectual
and sedentary Purposes, and
lengthening the natural Life.</HI> 6. <HI>That
a</HI> proper <HI>and</HI> specifick Diet <HI>for each</HI>
Distemper, <HI>is as necessary to be known
and prescrib'd by an honest and faithful</HI>
Physician, <HI>as proper and specifick Me∣dicines;
(for in these two</HI> only, <HI>the very</HI>
Essence <HI>of the Science consists, not sepa∣rately
but conjointly); and 7. That only
in those Distempers commonly reckon'd</HI>
incureable, <HI>the Reproach of</HI> Physick <HI>and</HI>
Physicians, <HI>and which are in their own
<PB N="vii" REF="12"/>
Nature, either</HI> mortal <HI>or insupportably
painful, such as tortureing,</HI> habitual
Gouts, <HI>confirm'd</HI> Cancers, <HI>obstinate Ve∣nereal
Distempers, the</HI> Stone <HI>in the</HI>
Kidneys, <HI>or in the</HI> Bladder (<HI>when Li∣thotomy
cannot be administrated); a</HI>
Pulmonick Phthisis, <HI>a</HI> Nervous Atrophy,
<HI>the</HI> Epilepsy, <HI>and the other higher and
inconquerable hysterick and hypochon∣driack
Disorders, a settled</HI> Hectick
<HI>(from Ulcers) an</HI> Elephantiasis <HI>and</HI> Le∣prosy,
<HI>a humorous</HI> Asthma, <HI>a chronical</HI>
Diabetes, <HI>an incurable</HI> Scrophula <HI>and
a deep</HI> Scurvy. <HI>I say, in these only,
and only in these when they are be∣come
manifest, have resisted all other
common Methods, and the Patients
are rather growing worse than bet∣ter
under them, is a</HI> total <HI>and</HI> strict
Milk, Seed <HI>and</HI> Vegetable Diet, <HI>proper
or to be attempted; and that in other
more simple and slight Cases, and even
in the first Stages of these mentioned
Distempers, a common moderate and
temperate animal Diet, and well-chosen
Medicines, will be sufficient. Now if
<PB N="viii" REF="13"/>
after all this, any one is dispos'd to
be merry with me, I ought not, I
shall not grudge them their Diver∣sion.</HI></P>
<P>V. <HI>I think truly, a thin, poor, cool,
low Diet as improper and unnatural to
a</HI> robust, active, strong, healthy Man,
<HI>as a gross, full, high Diet, is for a poor,
thin, low, valetudinary Creature. For
the whole Art of Physick, and the
Wisdom of animal Life, consists in ad∣justing
Diet and Medicines to the
Habit and the Distempers. For the
Diet that wou'd make a Nightingale
healthy and gay, wou'd starve and kill
a Kite, and on the contrary: But it
is odds if a Free-drinking, or Free-think∣ing
Physician be not as improper to advise
a poor weak, low, dying Creature, as
a Free-drinking, Free-thinking Casuist is
to advise a scrupulous and tender Con∣science.
Men of all Professions</HI> think; write
<HI>and</HI> advise Themselves, <HI>and their own
Characters, and impress their own</HI> Sig∣natures
<HI>on every thing they do, say,
<PB N="ix" REF="14"/>
and advise; which, I hope, may be an</HI>
Apology <HI>for Me, if in any thing I have
over-shot the</HI> Golden Mean, <HI>which I
am pretty certain I have not, to those,
who reason and think, and prefer Health,
Cheerfulness, and long Life, to a short
Life and a merry.</HI></P>
<P>VI. AFTER <HI>all, I would not have it
thought, that I am of Opinion that none
ever fail'd or died, who enter'd on a</HI>
Milk, Seed, <HI>and</HI> Vegetable Diet <HI>under
these mention'd</HI> Distempers. <HI>The noble</HI>
Organs <HI>may be spoilt or irretrievably
obstructed, which the wisest Physician
alive cannot absolutely foreknow; the
Time remaining and necessary for a total
Cure of such tedious Diseases, may not
be sufficient in the common</HI> Duration of
Life. <HI>All I affirm therefore, is, that
such a Diet in the</HI> mention'd Distem∣pers,
<HI>with the usual proper Medicines,
duly persisted in, will do the Whole that</HI>
Art <HI>can possibly do, or Mortality will
admit; and infinitely more than the
same Medicines under a</HI> full <HI>and free</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="15"/>
Diet of Animal Foods <HI>and</HI> Spirituous
Liquors; <HI>and at the very least, will
make their Pains and Sufferings less
both in</HI> Life <HI>and</HI> Death.</P>
<P>VII. WHAT <HI>I pretend to have done
in some Degree in the following Trea∣tise,
is, That I hope I have explain'd
the Nature and Causes of</HI> Nervous Dis∣tempers
<HI>(which have hitherto been rec∣kon'd</HI>
Witchcraft, Enchantment, Sor∣cery
<HI>and</HI> Possession, <HI>and have been the
constant Resource of Ignorance) from
Principles easy, natural and intelligible,
deduc'd from the best and soundest</HI> Na∣tural
Philosophy; <HI>and have by the
plainest Reasoning, drawn from these</HI>
Causes <HI>and this</HI> Philosophy, <HI>a</HI> Method
of Cure <HI>and a</HI> Course of Medicines
<HI>specifically obviating these Causes, con∣firm'd
by long Experience and repeated
Observations, and conformable to the
Practice of the ablest and best Writers
on these Diseases.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="16"/>
VIII. THE <HI>most material Objection
my</HI> ablest Friends <HI>have made to this</HI> Piece
<HI>is, That much of it is a Repetition of
what I have already said in Print, and
some of it but a</HI> lame and imperfect
Representation <HI>of what is much better
said by others. But as this</HI> Objection
<HI>regards only myself and my Reputation
as an</HI> Author, <HI>I will suffer it to have
its whole Effect. There can be no
greater Evidence of the</HI> Truth <HI>of</HI> Prin∣ciples,
<HI>than their being</HI> simple <HI>and</HI> few,
<HI>and readily applicable to solve all the
possible Appearances. Nature produces
many and various Effects in different
Circumstances, from one and the same
Cause.</HI> Truth <HI>is simple and one in its
Root and Source, but various and mani∣fold
in different Situations and Circum∣stances.
And I shall not think it</HI> Tau∣tology,
<HI>to press and inculcate the same</HI>
Methods of Cure, <HI>even in different
Distempers, from the same Causes, if it
be done from different Views and Consi∣derations.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="17"/>
IX. THERE <HI>are two Sorts of Rea∣ders
I have not the most remote Hopes
of convincing or giving Satisfaction to;</HI>
viz. <HI>the</HI> Voluptuous <HI>and</HI> Unthinking.
<HI>Those who value Life only for the Sake
of</HI> good Eating and Drinking, <HI>and those
whose</HI> thinking <HI>Faculties and</HI> Organs
<HI>have never been truly</HI> form'd <HI>or duly</HI>
cultivated; <HI>neither of</HI> these <HI>will ever
bear or can receive any Conviction or
Reasoning from such</HI> Principles <HI>as I lay
down. But the</HI> Laws of Nature, <HI>and
the immutable</HI> Relations of Things, <HI>are
too stubborn to bend to such</HI> Gentlemen;
<HI>and I should not chuse to study such a
Sort of</HI> Particulars, <HI>to learn incorrupted
Nature, its</HI> Laws <HI>and</HI> Order, <HI>no more
than I should apply to a</HI> monstrous
Production <HI>to learn the</HI> Genius <HI>of a</HI>
Tribe, <HI>or a</HI> Species <HI>either of</HI> Vegetables
<HI>or</HI> Animals. <HI>Possibly even they them∣selves
may be convinc'd, at least in some
measure, when their</HI> proper Time <HI>is
come; and sooner or later it may come,
unless the</HI> Minute Philosophy <HI>prevail,
<PB N="xiii" REF="18"/>
and become the</HI> Standard. <HI>For probably
when they begin to feel violent</HI> Pain,
<HI>long</HI> Sickness, <HI>habitual</HI> Low Spirits, <HI>or
enter upon the</HI> Limits of both Worlds,
<HI>they may be convinced. For, in the
main, I believe the Cause of these Dis∣tempers
here assign'd,</HI> just <HI>and</HI> adequate,
<HI>and on the Success of the</HI> Methods of
Cure <HI>laid down in general (in Cases
where any thing would succeed) I could
venture my</HI> Reputation, Fortune <HI>and</HI>
Life.</P>
<P>X. IF <HI>any of your</HI> Authors <HI>without</HI>
Names, <HI>who wound in the Dark; your</HI>
Hackney-Scribblers, <HI>who want only to
give their</HI> Lucubrations <HI>Sale; your</HI> pro∣fane
<HI>and</HI> bold Wits, <HI>who fight behind
Jingle and Rhime; your</HI> Philomaths,
<HI>who, without Experiment or Observa∣tion,
want only to shew away; or your</HI>
Pestle-and-Mortar Men, <HI>who have
more Time on their Hands than Busi∣ness,
think fit to try their</HI> Parts <HI>on this</HI>
Performance; <HI>for their Encouragement,
<PB N="xiv" REF="19"/>
they need only consider the</HI> Author <HI>as
gone to his</HI> long Home, <HI>or his Faculties
(as they could wish) impair'd or extinct.
But if any</HI> Sober <HI>and</HI> Serious <HI>Person,
who has</HI> Nature <HI>in View, and is in
Search of</HI> Truth <HI>only, ready to embrace
it on what Side of the Question soever
it lies, has any</HI> Difficulties <HI>or</HI> Doubts,
<HI>he may find some one or other who may
give him all the Satisfaction he can de∣sire;
if it be true (as it most certainly is)
that where the</HI> Philosopher <HI>ends, there
the</HI> Physician <HI>begins. If I could choose,
I should name only those for my</HI> Judges,
<HI>who to a competent Knowledge of the</HI>
Laws of Nature <HI>and</HI> Mechanism, <HI>have
join'd an Acquaintance with the best</HI>
Natural Philosophy, <HI>the latest Disco∣veries
in</HI> Natural History, <HI>and the</HI>
Powers <HI>and</HI> Virtues <HI>of</HI> Medicines, <HI>and
had been long conversant in the Practice
of</HI> Physick <HI>and Attendance on the Sick
and Diseased: And by their Judgment I
should</HI> stand <HI>or</HI> fall. <HI>But since I have
not the most remote Prospect to hope, or
<PB N="xv" REF="20"/>
the least Vanity to flatter myself, either
to prevail on but a very few of the
Suffering, Sick and Diseased, or to
choose my</HI> Readers <HI>and</HI> Judges; <HI>I must
be contented to stand my</HI> Fate, <HI>be it what
it will.</HI></P>
<P>XI. FOR <HI>how this Work may be
received by the</HI> Publick <HI>in general,
I think I have no further Concern,
than as its bad or good Reception
may affect the</HI> Publick, <HI>by disappointing
the</HI> Good <HI>it might do, or encourageing
the</HI> Evils <HI>it might prevent. I flat∣ter'd
myself it might entertain, instruct
and direct the</HI> Ingenious Delicate Va∣letudinarian,
<HI>and give at least the un∣prejudic'd
younger</HI> Physician <HI>a different
way of thinking in these</HI> Distempers
<HI>from the</HI> Common, <HI>which has been
the</HI> Reverse <HI>of my</HI> Doctrine. <HI>I am
myself come to that</HI> Time of Life
<HI>when</HI> Hopes <HI>and</HI> Fears <HI>ought to be
contracted into a very narrow Com∣pass.
I have done my</HI> best, <HI>and pur∣su'd
<PB N="xvi" REF="21"/>
in my own</HI> Case <HI>the</HI> same Rules
<HI>I have given to others, and have at
present,</HI> I thank God, <HI>inward</HI> Peace,
Health <HI>and</HI> Freedom of Spirits.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Spirit of a Man can bear his
Infirmities, but a wounded Spirit
who can bear? saith a Prophet.
As this is a great Truth in the <HI>In∣tellectual
World,</HI> so it may allude
to the <HI>Human Machin,</HI> to insinuate, that a
Person of sound Health, of strong Spirits,
and firm Fibres, may be able to combat,
struggle with, and nobly to bear and even
brave the Misfortunes, Pains, and Miseries
of this mortal Life, when the same Person,
broken, and dispirited by Weakness of <HI>Nerves,
Vapours, Melancholy,</HI> or <HI>Age,</HI> shall become
<PB N="2" REF="40"/>
dejected, oppress'd, peevish, and sunk even
below the Weakness of a Greensickness Maid,
or a Child. Of this every one who has liv'd
any time in the World may have seen Instances,
from the <HI>Hero</HI> to the City Girl. This I have
often observ'd, and reflected on within myself,
with much Pity of the Folly and Misery, the
Pride and Presumption of <HI>Human Nature,</HI>
which could value, or think to support itself,
upon its own natural Courage and Force. To
expect <HI>Fortitude, Patience, Tranquillity,</HI> and
<HI>Resignation,</HI> from the most <HI>Heroick</HI> of the
Children of Men, under such Circumstances,
from their natural Force or Faculties alone,
is equally absurd as to expect to fly without
Wings, or walk without Legs; the Strength
of the <HI>Nerves, Fibres,</HI> or <HI>Animal Spirits</HI> (as
they are call'd) being the necessary Instruments
of the former, as these Members are of the
latter, Different natural Complexions of the
<HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Intellectual</HI> Faculties, and different
Improvements from Education, <HI>Philosophy,</HI> or
<HI>Religion,</HI> may make some small Odds in the
Behaviour of different Persons under these
Disorders. But this depends much upon the
Degrees of the Distemper, and the original
Frame and Make of the Body, even more
than can be readily imagin'd, as I have often
had undeniable Evidences to conclude. And,
of all the Miseries that afflict Human Life,
and relate principally to the Body, in this
Valley of Tears, I think, <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders,
<PB N="3" REF="41"/>
in their extream and last Degrees; are the
most deplorable, and, beyond all comparison;
the worst. It was the Observation of a learned
and judicious <HI>Physician,</HI> that he had seen Per∣sons
labouring under the most exquisite Pains
of <HI>Gout, Stone, Cholick, Cancer,</HI> and all the
other Distempers that can tear the human
Machin, yet had he observ'd them all willing
to prolong their wretched Being, and scarce
any ready to lay down chearfully the <HI>Load</HI> of
<HI>Clay,</HI> (we will except those who were superna∣turally
supported) but such as labour'd under
a constant, internal Anxiety, meaning those
most sinking, suffocating, and strangling <HI>Ner∣vous</HI>
Disorders; it is truly the only Misery
almost, to be dreaded and avoided in Life, if,
by any means, it can possibly. Tho' other Evils
be Burdens, yet an erected Spirit may bear
them, but when the Supports are fallen, and
cover the Man with their Ruins, the Desola∣tion
is perfect. I greatly suspect, (and have
actually seen it in some) that most of those
who make away with themselves, are under
the Influence of this distracting <HI>Evil,</HI> if it pro∣ceeds
not sometimes from high Passions arising
in Constitutions naturally too sensible, and
such are the most readily expos'd to the Insults
of these Distempers. Having suffer'd once
and again under all the Varieties of the Symp∣toms
of this Disorder, partly from my own
Indiscretion, and partly from a gross Habit of
Body, and an original State of weak Nerves,
<PB N="4" REF="42"/>
and having tried in my own Person almost all
the possible Means, Reliefs, or Medicines, that
<HI>Physicians, Books of Physick,</HI> or <HI>Philosophy,</HI>
could suggest, besides my own Observations
on many others, who have come to <HI>this Place</HI>
for Relief for these Thirty Years, and being
once and again perfectly rescu'd from them by
the same Means, it will be a great Satisfaction
to me, if I can at least alleviate and mitigate
the Sorrows and Miseries of my <HI>Fellow-Suffer∣ers,</HI>
by the Experience I have so dearly bought.</P>
<P>THOSE who are desirous to read the ensu∣ing
Treatise only for their Relief and Cure,
may pass over those Parts (which may be learned
by the Index) that are merely <HI>Philosophical,</HI> and
design'd only to gratify their Curiosity, they
having no necessary Connection with what is
<HI>Directory</HI> or <HI>Practical.</HI></P>
<P>THESE need only suppose, that the Human
Body is a Machin of an infinite Number and
Variety of different Channels and Pipes, filled
with various and different Liquors and Fluids,
perpetually running, glideing, or creeping for∣ward,
or returning backward, in a constant
<HI>Circle,</HI> and sending out little Branches and Out∣lets,
to moisten, nourish, and repair the Ex∣pences
of Living. That the Intelligent Prin∣ciple,
or <HI>Soul,</HI> resides somewhere in the Brain,
where all the Nerves, or Instruments of Sensa∣tion
terminate, like a <HI>Musician</HI> in a finely
<PB N="5" REF="43"/>
fram'd and well-tun'd Organ-Case; that these
Nerves are like <HI>Keys,</HI> which, being struck on
or touch'd, convey the Sound and Harmony
to this sentient Principle, or <HI>Musician.</HI></P>
<P>OR, in a more gross Similitude, the Intelli∣gen
Principle is like a Bell in a Steeple, to which
there are an infinite Number of Hammers all
around it, with Ropes of all Lengths, termina∣ting
or touching at every Point of the Surface of
the Trunk or Case, one of whose Extremities
being pull'd or touch'd by any <HI>Body</HI> whatsoever,
conveys a measur'd, and proportion'd Impulse
or Stroke to the Bell, which gives the proper
Sound. These, or such like Similitudes, tho'
Lame and Imperfect, are all, I doubt, was
ever design'd for the Generality of Mankind
in the Knowledge necessary towards HEALTH
and LIFE, in such Matters. Those acquainted
with the best <HI>Philosophy, Natural History,</HI> The
<HI>Laws</HI> constantly observ'd by <HI>Bodies</HI> in their
Actions on one another, and the establish'd
Relations of Things, will, I hope, meet with
fuller Satisfaction, if they consider the follow∣ing
Treatise, without Prejudice or Partiality.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Sources and Causes of Chronical
Distempers in general.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. THE most universal and com∣prehensive
Sources and Causes
of Chronical Distempers are,
1<HI>st.</HI> A <HI>Glewiness, Sizyness,
Viscidity,</HI> or <HI>Grossness</HI> in the Fluids, either
accidental, or acquir'd by those Persons who
were born with sound or good condition'd
Juices; or original and hereditary, in those
who have brought them so dispos'd into the
World with them, from the ill State of Health
and bad State of Humours of the Parents,
which, possibly, <HI>they</HI> may have had transmitted
to them from theirs, and so on for many Ge∣nerations
backwards. A rotten and corrupt
Tree can produce nothing but bad Fruit, nor
can any natural Cause have a better Effect than
its Principles, or Natural Qualities can pro∣duce.
<PB N="7" REF="45"/>
2<HI>dly,</HI> Some Sharpness or corrosive Qua∣lity
in the Fluids, arising from a <HI>saline</HI> or
other destructive Mixture thrown into them,
or from some gross Concretions not sufficient∣ly
broken and divided by the digestive Powers
in the <HI>Alimentary</HI> Tube, retarding or stop∣ping
the Circulation in the small Vessels,
whereby the stagnant Juices become sharp
and corrosive, and the Salts have Time, by
their innate attractive Quality, to crystalize
or unite in greater Clusters, and exert their
destructive Force on the Solids; and this will
be still more pernicious and fatal, if the Food
is not only in too great a Quantity for the
concoctive Powers to break and divide it suf∣ficiently,
but is likewise too high, strong,
and full of Salts, from which the most ter∣rible
Symptoms will ensue. 3<HI>dly,</HI> A too great
Laxity or Want of due Tone, Elasticity and
Force in the <HI>Fibres</HI> in general, or the <HI>Nerves</HI> in
particular. There is a due Degree of Strength,
Power and Springyness required in the Fibres
or Solids, not only to make the Juices circu∣late,
and carry on their Motions backwards
and forwards in a continual <HI>Rotation</HI> thro'
the whole Habit, but also to break, divide,
and subtilize them further, that they may be
able easily to pass, not only thro' the slender
and finer Tubes of the capillary Vessels, but
also through the Strainers of the <HI>Glands,</HI> either
to throw off those Recrements and grosser
<PB N="8" REF="46"/>
Parts, which are not required for the ani∣mal
Functions, or to separate those Juices
which are required for the Preservation of
the Individual. These are the most effectual,
general and immediate Causes of all chronical
Distempers, of which, when any one is, in
any eminent Degree, become habitual, the
other two spring up, or follow very soon, and
join with it in producing the various Symp∣toms
of these Disorders. Other Specialities
and Circumstances may concur with them,
but they would have little Effect, if these
could be supposed absent or removed.</P>
<P>§. II. THE <HI>first</HI> Cause mentioned will ob∣struct
and possibly burst the small and capil∣lary
Vessels that carry about the Fluids, pro∣ducing
<HI>Tumours, Swellings,</HI> and <HI>Ulcers,</HI> and
will not only tumify and afterwards relax and
spoil the whole almost infinite Set of <HI>Glands,</HI>
external and internal, but especially those
which are properly called <HI>Emunctory</HI> ones,
and so stop the Secretions, and fill the Body
with vicious and morbid Juices. This Dis∣tention,
Swelling and Hardness of the <HI>Glands</HI>
and small Vessels, will likewise press upon the
Nerves, stop and intercept their <HI>Vibrations</HI> or
<HI>Tremors,</HI> or whatever else be their Action, and
consequently spoil their natural Functions.
The <HI>second</HI> will not only rend, tear and spoil
the Vessels, creating acute Pains, and produce∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="47"/>
corrofive, <HI>Scorbutick</HI> and <HI>Cancerous</HI> Ulcers
and Sores, in all Parts of the Body, but will
also, by twitching and vellicating the <HI>Nerves</HI>
or nervous Fibres, produce Convulsions, Spasms,
and all the terrible Symptoms of that Tribe
of nervous Distempers. The <HI>last</HI> mentioned
Cause will not only weaken and destroy volun∣tary
Motion, and the Force and Freedom of
the <HI>intellectual</HI> Operations (for the Exercise of
which, as long as the Union lasts, material Or∣gans
and their Soundness and Integrity seems to
be required as well as for the animal Functions)
but will also retard and weaken the Circu∣lation,
stop the Perspiration, and confound and
disorder the Secretions, and all the Functions
that belong to either Part of the Com∣pound.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="10" REF="48"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the General Causes of the Dis∣orders
of the Nerves.</HEAD>
<P>§ 1. THE Solids, and consequently
the Fibres and <HI>Nerves</HI> whereof,
they are woven and compli∣cated,
are subject to several
Disorders which may interrupt and entirely
ruin their Functions. As, <HI>first,</HI> by become∣ing
either too dry, or too moist, that is by
Want, or Excess of Humidity, Moisture or
Nourishment to keep their Parts in a due or
proper <HI>Tone</HI> or <HI>Elasticity.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> general∣ly
arises from a too hot, dry, and as it were
corrosive Nourishment, which renders them
too crisp, over <HI>elastick,</HI> and brittle, and so
forces on the Circulation, and sends about
the Juices with too great Force, Rapidity,
and Violence, instead of that calm and uni∣form
manner, in which the Functions, and
Secretions of the animal <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> are natu∣rally
perform'd, and that due Balance, which
ought, naturally to be between the Solids and
<PB N="11" REF="49"/>
Fluids. And this probably has a great Share
in the Production of inflammatory Disorders,
high Fevers, and the other acute Distempers
of strong Constitutions. The <HI>second</HI> from too
great a Quantity of oily and nutritious Juices
thrown on them more than the Expences of
living require, soaking and relaxing the So∣lids,
renders their Action languid, and has a
greater Share in the Productions of slow and
cold Diseases.</P>
<P>§. II. <HI>Secondly,</HI> BY improper, hard, solid and
noxious Particles getting into their Substan∣ces,
which may gradually alter, spoil and stop
their natural Texture and Functions what∣ever
that happen to be, whether <HI>Vibration,
Intestine Action,</HI> and <HI>Reaction</HI> or <HI>Collision</HI> of
their small Parts, or however they act or
are acted upon, to convey and propagate the
Sensations or Influences of external Bodies, to
the Seat of the <HI>intelligent Principle:</HI> For
when the Juices are spoil'd, and the Blood de∣clines
from its due Fluidity and <HI>Balmyness,</HI>
the nutritive Juices must necessarily partake
of their general Nature, and become crowd∣ed
and filled with hard, large Concretions,
of a different Nature from the genuine and
natural Condition of the Blood and Juices, in
their healthy State, which whencesoever they
may arise, or whatever different Qualities
they may be endued with; I choose to call
by the general Name of <HI>Animal Salts.</HI> The
<PB N="12" REF="50"/>
<HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Fibres</HI> being thus unnaturally
nourished and repair'd, must, in such a State,
either entirely stop and bring no Sensation at
all to the intelligent Principle, and convey no
Action from it to the Muscles and Organs of
Animal Motion, or at least false, imperfect and
delusory ones; for these Salts, and such like
hard, solid, compact and angular Particles, will
be more readily insinuated into the tender
Threads of the Solids, having a greater De∣gree
of <HI>Attraction</HI> in proportion to their
Bulks, than the more rare, soft, and spongy
ones.</P>
<P>§. III. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> FROM the Interruption, In∣terception
and Stoppage of their <HI>Vibrations,
Tremors,</HI> and the intestine Action of their
component Particles, by the greater Pressure
of too viscid Juices in the Blood Vessels, and
the other Tubes that contain the animal Juices,
surrounding these Fibres or <HI>Nerves:</HI> For it's
well known, that a more glutinous and viscid
Fluid, circulating in an elastick or distractile
Canal, will bulge it up, and press upon its
Sides more strongly than a thinner and more
rare Fluid one, and so the Sides of the Canal
will become more strait and tumified, pres∣sing
thereby on the <HI>Nerves,</HI> as if it were
a <HI>Wedge</HI> or solid Body, and interrupting
their natural Actions. The same is to be
concluded from the Tumefaction, Indura∣ration,
and Swelling of the <HI>Glands,</HI> which
<PB N="13" REF="51"/>
being extremely numerous over all the Body,
must greatly endamage the <HI>Nervous System.</HI></P>
<P>§. IV. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> FROM the natural or ac∣quired
Weakness and Laxity of their <HI>Tone</HI>
and <HI>Elasticity,</HI> whether from a natural or ac∣cidental
ill Structure or Formation of them∣selves
or the other Organs of the Body, or
from any external Injury received on them:
And such is the Case of those who are born
of weakly or old Parents, or whose Parents
have long labour'd under the <HI>Gout, Scurvy,
Elephantiasis, Leprosy, Venereal</HI> or <HI>Nervous</HI>
Disorders; those who have had a Cont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion
on the Head, Back-bone, or any other Part
of the Body, where there are the greatest
Collection of <HI>Nerves;</HI> and <HI>lastly,</HI> those who
have a Hump, or any preternatural Distor∣tion
or Excrescence, especially on the Trunk
of the Body.</P>
<P>§. V. AND tho' all these general Causes,
mentioned in the former and this <HI>Chapter,</HI>
concur in all chronical and nervous Distempers
whatsoever, in some Degree or other, and
perhaps some other more minute Circum∣stances,
which are not so readily found out,
or much to be regarded, yet Diseases differ
and have received their Names by <HI>Physicians,</HI>
according as the Symptoms arising from this
or that general Cause mentioned, are more
evident, numerous or stronger. But these
<PB N="14" REF="52"/>
Diseases are chiefly and properly called <HI>Ner∣vous,</HI>
whose Symptoms imply that the System
of the <HI>Nerves</HI> and their Fibres, are evident∣ly
relax'd and broken. The Brevity I intend
in this Treatise, will not allow me to detail
all the Kinds of Nervous Distempers that
have been observ'd and named; they are suf∣ficiently
known, or may be learned from
Books of <HI>Physick,</HI> and I think may be re∣duced
to the following general Heads.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the General Division of Nervous
Distempers.</HEAD>
<P>§. I. ALL Nervous Distempers what∣soever
from Yawning and
Stretching, up to a mortal
Fit of an Apoplexy, seems to me to be but
one continued Disorder, or the several
Steps or Degrees of it, arising from a Re∣laxation
or Weakness, and the Want of a
sufficient Force and Elasticity in the Solids
in general, and the <HI>Nerves</HI> in particular, in
Proportion to the Resistance of the Fluids, in
<PB N="15" REF="53"/>
order to carry on the Circulation, remove Ob∣structions,
carry off the Recrements, and make
the Secretions. In treating of Nervous Dis∣tempers,
the Disorders of the <HI>Solids</HI> are chiefly
what are to be had regard to; yet they rare∣ly
or never happen alone (except perhaps in
those Nervous Disorders that proceed from
acute Diseases, preternatural Evacuations, ex∣ternal
Injuries, or a wrong and unnatural
Make and Frame) but even in original ner∣vous
Distempers there is always some Visci∣dity
or Sharpness attending them from the
bad Constitutions of the Parents, from whom
they have derived their material Organs. This
is evident from the nervous Disorders that at∣tend
scrophulous and scorbutick Persons. And
from long and constant Observation, I am un∣der
a Conviction, that no deep and eminent
Degree of nervous Disorders happens to young
Persons, but from a manifest or latent scro∣phulous
or scorbutick Taint, which implies
both Viscidity and Sharpness in the Juices: nor
any great Degree to adult Persons, originally
sound, but from an acquired scorbutick Habit
or <HI>Cachexy.</HI></P>
<P>§. II. THE most natural and general Di∣vision
of nervous Distempers will therefore be
thus. 1<HI>st,</HI> Into those Diseases, that besides
their other Symptoms, are attended with a
partial or total Loss of Sensation for some
Time. This Branch will not only compre∣hend
<PB N="16" REF="54"/>
all those nervous Disorders from Low∣ness
of Spirits, lethargick Dullness, Melan∣cholly
and Moping, up to a compleat <HI>Apo∣plexy,</HI>
but also those fainting Fits, so com∣mon
in Persons of weak Nerves. As a Con∣sequence
from this Interruption of Sensation,
partial or total, there will necessarily follow a
Suspension of voluntary Motion. The intel∣ligent
Principle, under this Inability of the
<HI>Nervous System</HI> being bereaved of proper Or∣gans
to convey its Orders to the Muscles, tho'
these last should remain sufficiently fitted for
their proper Offices. This Class of nervous
Disorders seems chiefly to arise from a <HI>Gross∣ness,
Glewyness</HI> or <HI>Viscidity</HI> of the animal
Juices (setting aside at present the Considera∣tion
of their Sharpness and Acrimony, which
is never totally absent, when these others are
in any eminent Degree, especially in our
<HI>Northern</HI> Climates) which obstructs the <HI>Glands,</HI>
the serous Pipes, and the capillary Blood∣vessels,
and thereby breaks, interrupts and
weakens the Vibrations and Tremors, or what∣ever
else is the Action of the nervous Fibres
properly so called.</P>
<P>§. III. <HI>Secondly,</HI> THOSE nervous Disorders,
which are attended with a Loss of voluntary
Motion or Shakeing, in any particular Organ
or Limb, or in all the Instruments of volun∣tary
Motion. Such are all those of the para∣lytick
Kind. From an universal <HI>Palsy,</HI> a
<PB N="17" REF="55"/>
<HI>Hemiplegia</HI> (or Palsy of half the Body) or
of a particular Limb, to a Deadness, Numb∣ness,
Weakness, or Coldness upon any of
the Parts, external or internal. This Class
of Diseases seems to ow its Origin to a
Weakness, Imbecility, and Loss of due <HI>Tone</HI>
in the Nervous System, or an Interruption
of their Vibrations or proper Action, (what∣ever
it be) whereby the Soul is disabled to
communicat its <HI>Energy</HI> or Principle of Mo∣tion
to the Muscular Fibres.</P>
<P>§. IV. THOSE Nervous Distempers that
are attended with <HI>Spasms,</HI> Cramps, Convul∣sions,
or violent Contractions of the Muscles.
Of this kind are all of the <HI>Convulsive</HI> Tribe
from <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>Hysterical</HI> Fits, or
the Convulsions of the <HI>Epileptick</HI> Kind,
down to Yawning and Stretching. These
seem to be produced by some hard-pointed
Concretions, saline Particles, or some noxi∣ous
Acid or acrimonious Steam, Wind, or ob∣structed
Perspiration, lodged in the small
Vessels, or upon any Place where there are
the greatest Collections of <HI>Nerves, viz.</HI> in
the Alimentary Tubes, the Cavities of the
Brain, the Trunk of the Body, or the Inter∣stices
of the Muscles, where twitching, stimu∣lating,
and wounding the Nerves, or their
<HI>Membranes,</HI> it raises a general Disorder in the
whole nervous or sensible Fibres, whence the
same is derived upon the whole Muscular
<PB N="18" REF="56"/>
System, and there provokes violent Throws,
Contractions, Cramps, and Spasms, until tor∣menting
and wearying out the elastick Fibres,
at last, by their Strugglings and Efforts, the
destructive Matter is discharged or removed:
Much in the manner of that Struggle which
we observe from fulphureous, bituminous,
vitriolick, and ferrugineous Particles, uni∣ting,
and fermenting in the Bowels of the
Earth, and thereby acquiring such Force,
Violence, and Impetuosity, as to make
Houses, Palaces, and Cities shake and
tremble, overturn Hills and Mountains, and
make Rivers, Lakes, and the Sea itself, to
boil and heave (till they have forced a
Breach and Rupture for their Passage into
the Air and Day,) swallowing up all around,
and spreading Desolation and Ruin, as far as
their Influence can reach. But (to return
to my Subject) where the offending Matter
is so pent up in such great Quantity, or so
violent (as in the violent Hysterick or Epilep∣tick
Fits) as quite to overpower the weak
and feeble Solids, fainter Strugglings suc∣ceed,
and the Patient lies almost dead,
with few or languid Motions, and sometimes
foaming at the Mouth: till the Disease is quite
spent, or after a few repeated Struggles, the
Contest ends in Death.</P>
<P>§. V. THERE is another common Division,
or rather Distinction of Nervous Disorders,
<PB N="19" REF="57"/>
into <HI>original</HI> and <HI>acquir'd:</HI> But these differ∣ing
only as old Age does from Manhood. I
shall just mention them. It is to be sup∣posed
(at least, at the most remote Distance
of Time) that Mankind were originally
made so, as not to differ (in any eminent
Degree, at least, below that Standard re∣quired
for good Health) in their Constitutions.
Original Nervous Disorders, therefore, must
have had the same Source and Cause with
acquir'd ones. The Children, as to their
Bodies and bodily Diseases being punished
for the Faults, Follies, and Indiscretions of
their Parents. The Streams or Outlets must
partake of the same Qualities with the Spring
or Fountain Head. The wise Author of
Nature, in the present State of Things,
seems to have established Laws and Orders,
by which second Causes are to act upon, and
influence one another; which Laws, natu∣ral
and material Bodies constantly observe in
their Effects and Productions, and which <HI>He</HI>
never seems to violate by any uncommon
or supernatural Influence, except for intel∣lectual
or moral Purposes; and therefore to
govern and direct these Laws, <HI>He</HI> has given to
his intelligent Creatures, Understanding and
free Will. So that a poor Creature, born subject
to Nervous Distempers, has no more Reason
to complain, than a Child, whose Father has
spent his worldly Fortune, and left him
poor, and destitute.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="58"/>
§. VI. IT is a Misfortune indeed, to be
born with weak Nerves, but if rightly us'd
and manag'd, even in the present State of
Things, (I meddle no further) it may be
the Occasion of greater Felicity: For, at
least, it is (or ought to be) a Fence and
Security against the Snares and Temptations
to which the Robust and Healthy are ex∣pos'd,
and into which they seldom fail to
run; and thereby reduce themselves to the
same, or, perhaps, a worse State than those
whose Misfortune happen'd to be, the being
born thus originally subject to Nervous Dis∣orders.
Those who have originally bad
Nerves, I shall direct in the best Manner I
can afterwards.</P>
<P>§. VII. I SHALL only here observe two
things in regard to them. The <HI>first</HI> is, that
they are never to expect the same Force,
Strength, Vigour, and Activity, nor to be
made capable of running into the same In∣discretions
or Excess of sensual Pleasures
(without suffering presently, or on the Spot)
with those of strong Fibres and robust Con∣stitutions.
No Art hitherto known, can make
an Eagle of a Wren, (for tho' a Wren, by Art
and Management, may be made, as it were, a
Nightingale, yet never a Carrion Crow or
Kite); but for all the innocent Enjoyments of
Life, (at least, for Freedom from Pain and tor∣turing
<PB N="21" REF="59"/>
Distempers, for Chearfulness and Free∣dom
of Spirits, for intellectual Pleasures,
mental Enjoyments, and Length of Days)
they (considering the Temptations and Mi∣series
of this mortal State) generally have,
and may always have, the Advantage of
these others. (I always except extreme De∣grees
of Nervous Diseases.) As for intel∣lectual
Pleasures, the Case is without all
manner of doubt, (without some notable
Error, or in extreme Cases) possibly, be∣cause
the Organs of these Operations being
in their own Nature delicate and fine, when
wasted or scrap'd, (by Chronical Diseases
not mortal) and thus communicated to their
Posterity, these naturally subtil Parts <HI>thus</HI>
become more fine and sensible, are hinder'd
by the natural Weakness of Children, in
their tender Years, to incrassate and grow
clumsy, and so are longer preserv'd in
their Sensibility and Refinement; at least
the Case is generally in fact so, (as I have
observ'd in most originally tender Persons,
well educated and disciplin'd) Infinite Good∣ness
and Power bringing Good out of inno∣cent
Evil. (For the common Proverb is just
and true, that a <HI>Venice Glass</HI> will last as long,
if well look'd after, and even shine more
bright, than a more gross and coarse one.)
But to leave these Possibilities, and pass
to,</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="60"/>
§. VIII. THE <HI>second</HI> thing, which is, that
those who have originally weak Solids, and
have carefully avoided the Excesses and Sen∣sual
Pleasures which reduce the Robust to
that Case, and have follow'd the Directions
that may be learn'd, for strengthening their
Fibres and preserving them from being over∣laid,
if they get over the Meridian of Life
(or their thirty-fifth or thirty-sixth Year)
without any mortal Distemper, have a fair
Chance to get into a firm State of Health,
Vigour, and Spirits afterwards, and to hold
it on without any Rub (if they be so wise
then to keep from Excesses, or immoderate
Sensual Pleasures) to a great and <HI>green old
Age,</HI> as I have constantly observ'd. So true is
the common Observation, that every wise Man
has a <HI>Youthhood</HI> once in his Life, if not in his
early and tender Years, at least, in his old Age:
And this seems not only consistent with the
Wisdom of Providence, but the Necessity of
Things, and the Order of Nature; for let us
suppose that crazy putrified Parents should
bring into the World such a Child as I have
mentioned, the Parent's Juices, for want of
sufficient Time, or proper Means, are not
rectified. The Child's, on the contrary,
from the Necessity of its low Diet, and the
Length of its Nonage, (especially if proper
Methods be us'd, and proper Medicines
join'd) must necessarily become sweeter and
<PB N="23" REF="61"/>
purer: And if none of the great Organs be
spoil'd-so, as gradually to infect the whole
(which generally begins to shew itself, when
the Growth or Unfolding of the Solids comes
to its greatest Heighth and Extension, or
about the mention'd Period of the Meridian
of Life) the Juices then becoming sweet, will,
by Degrees, have their Effect upon the
Solids, so that about the Time when others
decline, these, on the contrary, begin to re∣vive
and spring; and enjoy that <HI>Youth</HI> which
others have surviv'd: And thus Age (which
naturally hardens and stiffens the Fibres in
others) recompences the Caution, Care, and
Sufferings of their younger Days, by a
greater Degree of Strength, more Chearful∣ness,
stronger Spirits, and a greater Length
of Days than is common.</P>
<P>§. IX. THOSE, who being born sound
and healthy, of a strong Constitution, and a
firm State of Nerves, have acquir'd the con∣trary
State, may have brought it on either,
<HI>first,</HI> by <HI>Accidents,</HI> as I have before men∣tion'd,
such as a Wound, Bruise, Disloca∣tion;
or Fracture, which may introduce
Humps, Distortions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and alter the na∣tural
good Configurations of the Parts, whose
Cure must depend upon the <HI>Surgeon</HI>'s Art,
by his endeavouring to reduce these to their
original State: to which likewise Remedies
may be suggested for the present Relief of
<PB N="24" REF="62"/>
the Nervous Distempers thence depending,
in the Directions afterwards to be given.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> By a bad, corrupt, or a too poor and
low Diet, indiscreet Excess of bodily Labour,
or having expos'd themselves too much to
the Injuries of the Weather, whereby the
Juices have been defrauded of that due Pro∣portion
of Heat, Nourishment, and Balsam,
the Fibres become weak and relax'd, the
Muscles flabby and flaccid, and Lowness of
Spirits, Melancholy, and all the Degrees and
Complications .of Nervous Distempers have
ensued. Such are those of the poorer Sort,
who are deprived of the due Necessaries and
Conveniencies of Life, those who have gone
long and dangerous Voyages, who live in
Prisons, or travel in Desarts, or those who are
confin'd to Monasteries and Hermitages. But
as this Country is pretty free from such
Cases, and the Remedy is obvious, I need
say no more of them, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> By Intem∣perance,
want of due Exercise, rioting in
sensual Pleasures, casual excessive Evacua∣tions
of any Kind, Fevers and other acute
Diseases not duly manag'd, by which the
Juices have been made sizy or corrosive,
and the due Tone, Spring and Elasticity of
the Nerves or Solids relax'd and broken,
whereby the true acquir'd Nervous Disorders
are produc'd. To restore such to a sound
State of Health, and a good Constitution, or,
at least, to relieve their Symptoms, as far
<PB N="25" REF="63"/>
as my poor Abilities can effect, shall be
my sincere Endeavour in the following
Pages.</P>

<P>§. 1. THO' I think it pretty evident,
that this terrestrial Globe, and
the State of Things in it, and
about it at present, is not design'd merely
for a <HI>Paradise of Delights,</HI> and the ultimate
End of the intelligent Creatures which in∣habit

their own Nature perishable, subject to Ac∣cidents,

that the omnipotent and infinitely good Au∣thor

none but Devils could have such Malice;
none but Men themselves, or what is next
themselves, I mean their Parents, who were
the Instruments or Channels of their Bodies
and Constitutions, could have Power or
Means to produce such cruel Effects. In
itself this Law and Establishment of Nature
has infinite Beauty, Wisdom, and Goodness:
<HI>viz.</HI> by this progressive and continual Suc∣cession
from one Root, that the Healthy and
Virtuous should thereby be growing con∣tinually
healthier and happier, and the Bad
continually becoming more miserable and
unhealthy, till their Punishment forced them
upon Virtue and Temperance; for Virtue
and Happiness are literally and really Cause
and Effect.</P>

<P>§. III. BOTH the <HI>End</HI> and <HI>Rule,</HI> the <HI>De∣sign</HI>
and <HI>Measure</HI> of Eating and Drinking,
could be no other but the Supply of the
Waste of <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Living.</HI> The <HI>Friction</HI>
and <HI>Collision</HI> that necessarily follows upon
the <HI>Impenetrability</HI> of Matter, the Commu∣nication
of Motion, and the Impressions of
the Bodies that surround us, must necessarily
rub off, and wear out some Parts from our
bodily Machin. The necessary <HI>Collisions</HI>
that are made in our Juices, in breaking and
subtilizing their Parts, to render them fit for
the Animal <HI>Functions:</HI> the various <HI>Secretions</HI>
of what is not proper to be retained, or
what is necessary for the Preservation of the
<PB N="30" REF="68"/>
Individual, make a continual <HI>Waste</HI> of our
Substance. To supply all which, it was
absolutely necessary, that a due and equal
Proportion of proper Nourishment should be
design'd us. There is also established by
the Rules of the <HI>Animal O Economy,</HI> a Bal∣lance
between the Force or Elasticity of the
Solids, or the moving Organs and Channels,
and the Resistance of the Fluids mov'd in
them (or rather the first ought a little to
exceed the latter.) And whenever any of
these <HI>Rules</HI> are long and notably transgress'd
by either taking down more than the Sup∣plies
of Action and Living require in Quan∣tity,
or Things stronger in Nature, and of a
greater Resistance in Quality, so that the
active and concoctive Powers of the Solids,
are not sufficient for them, the Individual
must suffer Diseases, Pains, and Miseries,
in Proportion to the Greatness of this Over∣ballance.</P>
<P>§. IV. LET us suppose, that a Child is
born Sound, Healthy, and Vigorous, (as
much as the Conditions of Mortality permit)
of Parents Healthy and Sound, and in the
full Vigour of their Days, and that this
Child has continued thus to the Age of
<HI>Puberty,</HI> 'bating the Diseases of Childhood,
which generally render the Case better (such
as a Rash, Measles, or Small-Pox, which are
seldom dangerous in those whose Parents are
<PB N="31" REF="69"/>
such as I suppose, or who have lived in any
sober way.) In the Name of <HI>Wonder</HI> and
<HI>Astonishment,</HI> How is it possible that such a
Person should come to suffer under such ter∣rible
Miseries as I have describ'd, by any
other Means, than some notable and obsti∣nate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nobody will ever be seiz'd with a Disease, who takes sufficient Care not to fallinto Crudities or Indigestion [<HI>i. e.</HI> that eats no more than he can easily digest.] <HI>Galen Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>De Cibis Bon. &amp; Mal. Succ.</HI></NOTE>
Error in the Matter or Quantity of
what he takes down, or introduces into his
Habit. For as such Misery and Tortures
are internal and intimate, so must the pro∣ductive
Cause be. A bad, noxious, or
poisonous <HI>Air,</HI> the Inclemencies of the <HI>Sea∣son</HI>
and <HI>Climate,</HI> violent Fatigue, and ex∣cessive
bodily Labour, Accidents, Wounds,
and Bruises, are what Mortality is subject
to. But as the Influence and Operation of
these Causes is seldom so long continued,
as that of the other Causes I have formerly
mention'd, so those who are most subject
to the unhappy Consequences of such Ex∣cesses,
are generally well guarded and pro∣tected
against any Hurt from these men∣tioned
Accidents, which accordingly hap∣pen
more frequently to those of the lower
Rank. It is is true indeed, when the same
Excesses of those of a high Condition,
are join'd to the other Perils and Hard∣ships
<PB N="32" REF="70"/>
of the lower Rank now mentioned, it
makes the Distress and Pain the greatest of
all, and is the proper <HI>Scene</HI> where such <HI>Tra∣gedies</HI>
are acted to the utmost Perfection of
Misery and Woe. But as such extraordi∣nary
Circumstances rarely fall out, they are
not properly the subject Matter of what we
are chiefly concern'd about. To proceed
then, let us suppose such a Person as I have
describ'd, rioting and wallowing in Luxury
for some considerable Time, his Fibres,
Nerves, and Motive Organs being yet firm
and unbroken. The most natural Effect of
such a Course, will be, to fill the Blood and
Juices with an Excess of such oily, sulphu∣reous,
and inflammatory Particles, as are
most readily turn'd into red Globules, which
make the fibrous Part of the Blood. Such
an inflammatory Blood (the Solids being yet
tense and firm) will necessarily be driven about
with too great Force and Violence, and forced
into the small and capillary Vessels, design'd
for the Lymph or thinner Fluids only, and
thus inflammatory and <HI>acute</HI> Diseases are
produc'd, with all the Varieties and Degrees
of their Symptoms: such as <HI>Fevers</HI> of all
Sorts and Kinds, the <HI>Gout, Erysipelas, Rheu∣matism,</HI>
and the like. If these small lym∣phatick
Vessels, by the Force of the Circu∣lation,
and the Grossness of the Fluid, driven
into them, are broken and torn, then fol∣low
<HI>Impostumes, Gangrenes, Mortifications,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="71"/>
and all their Train of Miseries, especially,
if, together with these mention'd Conditions,
great Store of <HI>animal</HI> or <HI>urinous Salts</HI> are
brought together in great Quantities (which
never fails under such a Course) and unite
and combine in larger Clusters and Concre∣tions,
whereby the Solids are corroded, eaten
and destroy'd, the natural Functions of the
Nerves spoil'd and perverted, and the ex∣treme
Degrees of Torture, Malignity, and
Duration are added to the other Symptoms
of these inflammatory Distempers.</P>
<P>§. V. THIS will necessarily be the Case in
a young robust Body and Constitution, when
such Excesses are violent, quick, and long
continued, and the Solids have not yet lost
their Tone and Vigour, whereby the Indi∣vidual
will be quickly brought into those
acute, inflammatory, and violent Distem∣pers;
and then, by continu'd violent Con∣flicts,
Nature, after many Struggles, will
either break, divide, and subtilize these
numerous, fiery, and inflammatory Globules,
and those sharp-pointed, hard, and acrimo∣nious
Salts, and drive them out of the Habit
by such <HI>Crises</HI> as I have describ'd; and the
Constitution being purified, the Patient will
gradually return to his former Health and
Soundness: Or if this cannot be effected, by
reason of the Strength of the Disease, or the
Greatness of the Obstruction in the small
<PB N="34" REF="72"/>
Vessels, the Person must unavoidably sub∣mit
to Fate. But if such a Course be pur∣sued
more slowly, and by more moderate
Degrees, and <HI>Laziness</HI> or Want of Exercise
is joined with it, so that the Acrimony of
the Salts, and the Stock of the Humours,
gradually encrease as the Solids are relaxed
and weakened: then the flower, colder, more
humorous and chronical Diseases are produced,
with all the Pains, Miseries, and Torments
arising in this low, sunk, and dejected State
of the Constitution. From all which it is
evident, that these monstrous and extreme
<HI>Tortures,</HI> are entirely the Growth of our
own Madness and Folly, and the Product of
our own wretched Inventions, from the
Poison and Ordure, with which, for the
sake of a little sensual Pleasure, we forcibly
and tyrannically cram our poor passive
Machins.</P>

Ulcers, Corrosions, and Putrefactions, which
by Reason or just Philosophy, can be ascrib'd

which, as well as those beforemention'd,
plainly ow their Effects to Salts of one
Kind or another, combin'd with Oils and
Sulphurs) there will be found little Difficulty
in this Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="76"/>
§. III. IT is plain there is a Mineral
Source of Salts lodged in the Bowels of the
Earth, (to which the Sea owes its Saltness)
which transmits its Steams or smaller Par∣ticles
to Minerals, Plants, and Vegetables,
and seems to be the common <HI>Mother</HI> and
Origin of all the several Kinds of form'd Salts
or saline Concretions, according to its different
Mixture with the other Elements, to wit,
those of Earth, Water, Sulphur, (or perhaps
imprison'd Light) and Air: There are like∣wise,
possibly, two Kinds of most active Fluids,
(Air, Water, and Mercury, being combin'd
with the other passive Substances) one we
know very little of, more than what I shall
mention in a following <HI>Chapter.</HI> The
other is that of <HI>Light,</HI> which actuates and
enlivens the whole material <HI>System</HI> of Bodies
here below, without which they would
languish, deaden, chill, and be motionless, and
this seems to be the active <HI>energetick</HI> Principle,
(together with that other, which is suppos'd
to be the Cause of their attractive Quality, as
well as that of all Matter, and of all the sub∣tile
Appearances of small Bodies on our Globe.)
Salts of one Kind or another, seem to be its
passive Instruments, which being driven and
actuated by it, (and the other active Fluid
mention'd) produce the Appearances we ob∣serve
from them. Form'd <HI>Salts</HI> also are hard,
and dissolvible only by Water, and from it,
<PB N="39" REF="77"/>
possibly, in a great measure, they originally
spring<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Newton's</HI> Opticks.</NOTE>. They generally form themselves
into regular, and sharp, or angular Figures,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Gulielmini de Salium Natura.</NOTE> whereby they become more piercing and
penetrating: And this Regularity of their
Figures makes it probable, that their Parti∣cles
have plain Surfaces, which accounts for
their extreme Degree of Union, or their
running eagerly into one another's Embraces,
as is evident from their Congelations and
<HI>Crystalizations.</HI> The Volatility and Acti∣vity
of Salts, seems to arise from several
Sources: As first, from the Smallness of their
Parts, and the Sharpness of their Angles:
Secondly, from their greater Degree of <HI>At∣traction,</HI>
than is common to other Bodies of
the same Bulk: And thirdly, from their
Union with <HI>Light, Sulphur,</HI> and other <HI>sul∣phureous</HI>
Bodies, when they become <HI>Urinous</HI>
or <HI>Animal.</HI> It is not my Affair to detail
their Laws, or the <HI>Mechanism</HI> of all their
Actions, my Design being only to give such
a Sketch of the Matter, from the best Ac∣counts
of Philosophy, as may be sufficient to
give my Reader a general Notion of the
Force of this Argument.</P>
<P>§. IV. MINERAL (or the Mother) Salt
is, probably, simple, and of the plainest
<PB N="40" REF="78"/>
Figure (perhaps a <HI>Tetrahedron</HI> of an equila∣teral,
triangular <HI>Base</HI>) which, with its Dis∣solubility
in Water, and the Influence of the
active Principle of Light, fits it to be readily
introduc'd first into the Substance of Vegeta∣bles,
where, by the Action and <HI>Attraction</HI> of
their Tubes and Solids, and its Union with the
Sulphurs and Earths of Plants, it is advanced
one Degree farther in Activity and Volati∣lity,
its Angles are rendered more Acute,
and it becomes, by Crystalization a Vegetable
or fix'd Salt: But 2dly, it acquires a yet fur∣ther
Degree of Smallness and Agility, when
introduc'd into animal Bodies as Food, being
there again ground and subtiliz'd by the Force
of animal Fibres and Solids, and blended with
animal Oils and Sulphurs, and thereby becom∣ing
what we call properly <HI>urinous</HI> Salt: And
3dly, the last and highest Degree of Subtility
and Volatility is produc'd, when this <HI>Salt,</HI> now
in its <HI>urinous</HI> Form, becomes Food for Birds
and Beasts of Prey, or for human Creatures,
being there mix'd with, and agitated by the
lightest and most subtil of all Oils and Sul∣phurs:
And when introduced into the Habit,
in great Quantities, and urg'd or actuated
by the highest Oils and Spirits, (as happen
to the <HI>European</HI> Nations chiefly, and to those
of the <HI>Eastern,</HI> who follow their Methods,
in Riots and Excesses of animal Food and
spirituous Liquors) they become too strong
and powerful for the tender and delicate
<PB N="41" REF="79"/>
Fibres, and produce the dismal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Philosoph. Trans.</HI> No 433. A Letter from <HI>Micheli Pinelli.</HI></NOTE> Appearance
I have describ'd.</P>
<P>§. V. THE Reason why <HI>mineral</HI> and
<HI>vegetable</HI> Salts, <HI>Poisons</HI> and <HI>Causticks,</HI> have
such immediate and sensible Effects beyond
animal Salts, seems chiefly to be owing to
their Firmness and Solidity, whereby a
greater Quantity of Salts is contain'd in the
same Space or Volume, than can possibly be
of animal Salts, because the Cement of the
first (even when subtiliz'd) being Earth or
earthy Particles, a greater Quantity of them
are combin'd in a smaller Space than can be
of animal Salts, which are united with a
great Quantity of a porose and light Sulphur
only, and so can neither become so com∣pact,
nor lodge so great a Quantity of Salts
or attractive Particles in an equal Space.
For these others, when admitted into animal
Bodies, become true <HI>Causticks,</HI> and burn up
the internal, as <HI>Causticks</HI> do the external
Parts of Animals, as we see in <HI>Arsenick,
Vitriol, Alum,</HI> &amp;c. But after the several
Degrees of <HI>Alcoholization</HI> and <HI>Subtilization</HI>
formerly mention'd, the natural Salt being
thus levigated and refin'd, and its Angles
thereby render'd more acute, and its <HI>at∣tractive</HI>
Quality greater, (by the lessening
of its Bulk) when Motion and Volatility is
<PB N="42" REF="80"/>
added to it, by its Mixture with the several
Oils and Balsams, of Animals, Vegetables,
and <HI>Cannibals,</HI> (pardon the Expression) it
becomes so subtil and agile, as to be able
easily to enter into the smallest Tubes,
and there exert its Fury, which the grosser
Salts, especially when mix'd with Earths,
are either, by their Grossness, incapable of,
or, by the Violence of their Action on the
Parts they first touch, are thrown out, upon
their first Approach, by the digestive Organs
in convulsive Vomitings.</P>
<P>§. VI. THE Sum of this present Argument
is thus, <HI>that</HI> Salt, in its Origin, is but one;
<HI>that</HI> by Division its Angles are made smaller
and sharper, and its attractive Virtue greatly
increased; <HI>that</HI> though it be the most pene∣trating
and attractive among little Bodies,
or their <HI>Systems,</HI> and becomes, as it were,
like a <HI>Lancet</HI> or <HI>Razor,</HI> yet can neither hurt
nor destroy, when sheath'd, or not put in
Action by some <HI>moving</HI> Principle; <HI>that</HI> this
Motion or Action is communicated to it by
the most active and <HI>energetick</HI> of all Fluids,
Light or Sulphur, Oils or Spirits; <HI>that</HI>
when its Particles are cemented only by an
earthy Matter, so that the greatest Number
of them possible, may be crowded into the
smallest Volume; it has its most deleterious
or destructive Power on animal Bodies, but
under that Form is incapable of being re∣ceiv'd
<PB N="43" REF="81"/>
or retain'd long in the Body for that
Effect; <HI>that</HI> after two or three Divisions
and Subtilizations, its Parts become so ex∣ceeding
fine, that it is thereby render'd
capable to be readily introduc'd into the
inmost Recesses of animal Bodies, (when
thus sheath'd with animal and vegetable
Oils) and in small Quantities, is not only
safe, but absolutely necessary for exciting
the innate Action of the Fibres and Solids,
to wit, Contraction: But <HI>that</HI> when crowded
in great or infinite Numbers and Quantities,
and received into the smallest and finest
Tubes, and there having Time and Leisure
to drop its Oils, it unites and crystalizes in
greater Volumes and Clusters, and it thereby
acquires the Nature and Qualities of the
first mention'd Salts or Poisons, that is, be∣comes
hard, compact, and deleterious, and
acts as <HI>Poisons,</HI> or a <HI>Caustick,</HI> upon animal
Fibres and Constitutions. But I am weary
of this Subject, and its tedious Detail; those
who have Philosophy enough to understand
or receive this Doctrine, will be convinced
and satisfied by what has been said; or, if
they want any further Confirmation, may
have it from what Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has said
of the Actions of little Bodies,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Sir <HI>Isaac Newton's</HI> Opticks.</NOTE> as explain'd

Plants and Vegetables have scarce any Salts,
and few Oils or Spirits at all, at least, that
can in any Quantity be extracted out of
them; that Plants have them only when
they come to Maturity, or rather in their
Decline, and Animals most as they advance
from Youth, thro' Maturity towards old
Age, and so are more or less grateful to the
Palate or Taste, as these Salts and Sulphurs
abound in them; that <HI>Aromaticks,</HI> the Juices
of vinous Fruits or Plants, ow their Virtue,
<PB N="45" REF="83"/>
Flavour, and Delicacy, to their abounding
more eminently with such Salts and Oils,
but especially to the <HI>Spirits</HI> extracted out
of them, when the grosser Parts are thrown
off by Fermentation and Distillations. Now
if all these Considerations put together, are not
sufficient to make out the true remote Cause,
and give an Account of the Origin of these
Diseases, even of the most excruciating Na∣ture,
(tho' a great deal more of the same
Kind might be added) I despair of any Suc∣cess
with my Reader on this Subject. To
conclude, <HI>Salts,</HI> of one Kind or another,
seem absolutely necessary to carry on the
Animal Life and Functions in the best Manner
possible for our present Situation on this Globe;
and it is not possible to have any Food with∣out
them, since even Water itself, with a Parti∣cle
of Earth, if not the Origin and sole Matter of
Salt, yet, at least, is never without it; but whe∣ther<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Plutarch de Sanitate tuenda &amp; de Esu. Carnium.</NOTE>
Animal or Vegetable Salts are most pro∣per,
every one must judge from his own Feel∣ings,
his Constitution, and the Diseases he is
most subject to, or from the Judgment of his
Physician; to make which Judgment I shall
assist the Reader in the best Manner I can
afterwards; I think there is no Doubt to be
made, that Salts of any Kind, when too
many in too large Clusters, and of the most
<PB N="46" REF="84"/>
pungent, provoking, and deleterious Nature,
have the greatest Share in the Production of
those Diseases to which Mankind are expos'd
in this Life. And that therefore, in some
Diseases, it is extremely fit and convenient,
to support Nature with those Foods which
abound in them least, and where they are of
the most benign Nature.</P>
<P>§. VIII. BUT left any one should misun∣derstand
what has been here said, by sup∣posing
that I consider <HI>Salts,</HI> according to the
particular Qualities that distinguish one Kind
of Salts from another, or their different Pro∣perties,
whether <HI>Acid, Alkalin,</HI> or having this,
or that particular Effect upon the Palat: or the
Appearances arising upon the Actions of the
several Kinds of Salts upon one another, and
the other Appearances observ'd from <HI>chymical</HI>
Managements (all which peculiar and distin∣guishing
Properties and Appearances, pro∣bably
arise only from the different Mixtures
and Proportions of the other Elements in
their particular Composition, or their dif∣ferent
Degrees of <HI>Attraction.</HI>) For since <HI>that</HI>
particular Formation or Union with the other
Elements, and these different Qualities result∣ing
thereupon, are mostly destroy'd as soon
as they enter into an animal Body, and are
mix'd and blended with the animal Juices;
(at least, no such different Kinds of Salts are
to be extracted out of these Juices) or <HI>that</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="85"/>
have such particular Appearances and Effects,
as they had before they were received into
the Habit: Therefore, I say, that there
may be no Room to mistake my Meaning on
this Head, I shall here add, that I consider
Salts only in their general Nature, as Angular,
Hard, and Attractive, and consequently active
solid Particles of Matter, and make use of
those general Properties only, that are existent
in all Kinds of Salts, whatever other pecu∣liar
and distinguishing Qualities any particu∣lar
Kinds may have, since tho' these may
remain in them while they are in the Stomach
and Guts, where they are sometimes to be
found, yet (as I have just now said) they
are all confounded, soon after they have
enter'd the Habit, and mix'd with the
Juices; for which Reason I have rejected
the Consideration of the violent and sudden
Effects of some Kinds of Salts, and have
only observ'd of <HI>Salts</HI> in general, that they
are Hard, Solid, Sharp, and Angular Bo∣dies,
highly Attractive, and dissolvible by
watery Fluids, and capable of being subti∣lized
or divided into smaller Parts, and ren∣der'd
sharper and more volatile by different
Mixtures and Managements, which are equal∣ly
applicable to all Kinds of Salts, and from
thence deduce the Effects they have, or
produce in the Fluids, or upon the Solids of
Animals, when receiv'd into the Habit. The
other Consideration of specifick Salts may
<PB N="48" REF="86"/>
have their specifick Effects on one another
without the Animal. But they seem more
proper and adapted for philosophical than
medical Disquisition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Frequency of Nervous Disorders
in later Years, beyond what they
have been observed in former Times.</HEAD>
<P>§. I. IF what I have advanced in the for∣mer
<HI>Chapter</HI> have any Truth or
<HI>Verisimilitude,</HI> it well be no hard
Matter to account for the Frequency of
Nervous Distempers observ'd of late Years,
beyond what they have been in former
Times. There is nothing more common,
than to hear Men (even those, who, on
other Subjects, reason justly and solidly)
ascribe their Distempers, <HI>acute</HI> or <HI>chronical,</HI>
to a wet Room, damp Sheets, catching
Cold, ill or under-dress'd Food, or eating
too plentifully of this or the other Dish at a
certain Time, and to such like trivial Cir∣cumstances,
being unwilling to own the true
Cause, to wit, their continu'd Luxury and Lazi∣ness,
because they would gladly continue this
<PB N="49" REF="87"/>
Course and yet be well, if possible. And
there have not wanted learned Physicians,
who have ascrib'd the Frequency of these
Nervous Distempers of late, especially among
the Fair Sex, to <HI>Coffee, Tea, Chocolate,</HI> and
<HI>Snuff:</HI> I would not affirm, that there could
be no Abuses of these, otherwise innocent
Foods or Amusements, or that these men∣tion'd
Circumstances, and Accidents may
have no Effects, but they are so Weak, In∣sensible,
and Transitory, if they meet with
Constitutions tolerably Clean and Healthy,
that whoever would attribute any consider∣able
Disorder to them, argues with as much
Reason and true Philosophy, as he who ascribes
his good Liquor intirely to the Yest or other
Helps of its Fermentation, or the Death of
a Man kill'd by a Gun-shot to the Paper or
Tow that held down the Bullet: Health
and Life, however Frail and Brittle, are too
strong Forts to be taken or destroy'd by
such puny and insufficient Pop-gun Artillery.
The Matter, as I take it, stands thus:</P>
<P>§. II. SINCE our Wealth has increas'd,
and our Navigation has been extended, we
have ransack'd all the Parts of the <HI>Globe</HI> to
bring together its whole Stock of Materials
for <HI>Riot, Luxury,</HI> and to provoke <HI>Excess.</HI> The
Tables of the Rich and Great (and indeed
of all Ranks who can afford it) are furnish'd
with Provisions of Delicacy, Number, and
<PB N="50" REF="88"/>
Plenty, sufficient to provoke, and even gorge,
the most large and voluptuous Appetite. The
whole <HI>Controversy</HI> among us, seems to lie in
out-doing one another in such Kinds of
Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion. <HI>Invention</HI> is rack'd, to furnish
the Materials of our Food the most Delicate
and Savoury possible: Instead of the plain
<HI>Simplicity</HI> of leaving the Animals to range
and feed in their proper <HI>Element,</HI> witht heir
natural Nourishment, they are physick'd
almost out of their Lives, and made as great
<HI>Epicures,</HI> as those that feed on them; and
by <HI>Stalling, Cramming, Bleeding, Lameing,
Sweating, Purging,</HI> and <HI>Thrusting</HI> down such
unnatural and high-season'd Foods into them,
these Nervous Diseases are produced in the
<HI>Animals</HI> themselves, even before they are
admitted as Food to those who complain of
such Disorders. Add to all this, the <HI>tor∣turing</HI>
and <HI>lingering</HI> Way of taking away
the Lives of some of them, to make them
more delicious: and the Dressing of them,
by culinary Torments while alive, for their
Purchaser's Table: All which must necessa∣rily
sharpen, impoison, corrupt, and putrify
their natural Juices and Substances. The
<HI>Liquors</HI> also that are used for <HI>Vehicles</HI> to
such Food, are the highest and most spiri∣tuous,
the most scorched by the <HI>Solar</HI> Beams,
or inflam'd by repeated Distillations, to carry
off the present Load, and leave a Disposition
and Craving for a new one in the shortest
<PB N="51" REF="89"/>
Time possible. Any one who has but a
tolerable Knowledge in <HI>Philosophy,</HI> or is
acquainted with the Animal <HI>OEconomy,</HI> can
easily tell what the necessary Consequence
of such a <HI>Diet</HI> must be in naturally weak
Habits.</P>
<P>§. III. NOT only the Materials of <HI>Luxury,</HI>
are such as I have describ'd, but the Manner
of Dressing or Cooking them, is carried on
to an exalted Height. The ingenious
mixing and compounding of <HI>Sauces</HI> with
foreign <HI>Spices</HI> and Provocatives, are con∣triv'd,
not only to rouze a sickly Appetite
to receive the unnatural Load, but to ren∣der
a natural good one incapable of know∣ing
when it has enough. Since <HI>French
Cookery</HI> has been in such Repute in <HI>England,</HI>
and has been improv'd from <HI>Spain, Italy,
Turkey,</HI> and every other Country that has
any thing remarkably delicious, high, or
favoury in Food; since <HI>Eastern</HI> Pickles and
Sauces have been brought to embellish our
continual Feasts. Dressing, which was de∣sign'd
to assist the Labour of Digestion, as it
is now manag'd, not only counter-acts that
Design, but is become the most <HI>difficult,
curious, ingenious,</HI> and, at the same Time,
one of the most profitable Trades<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Do you wonder that Diseases are innumerable?
Number the Cooks.—<HI>Seneca</HI> Epist. 95.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="90"/>
§. IV. SUCH a Course of Life must neces∣sarily
beget an Ineptitude for Exercise, and
accordingly <HI>Assemblies, Musick Meetings,
Plays, Cards</HI> and <HI>Dice,</HI> are the only Amuse∣ments,
or perhaps Business follow'd by such
Persons as live in the Manner mention'd,
and are most subject to such Complaints, on
which all their Thoughts and Attention,
nay, their Zeal and Spirits, are spent. And
to convey them with the least Pain and Un∣easiness
possible from Motion, or slavish La∣bour,
to these still and bewitching Employ∣ments:
<HI>Coaches</HI> are improv'd with Springs,
<HI>Horses</HI> are taught to pace and amble,
<HI>Chairmen</HI> to wriggle and swim along, to
render the Obstructions more firm and fix'd
in the small Vessels, and to prevent all the
Secretions that would any ways lighten the
Burthen. Is it any Wonder then, that the
Diseases which proceed from <HI>Idleness</HI> and
<HI>Fulness</HI> of Bread, should increase in Propor∣tion,
and keep equal Pace with those Im∣provements
of the Matter and Cause of Dis∣eases?</P>
<P>§. V. It is a common Observation, (and,
I think, has great Probability on its Side)
that <HI>Fools, weak</HI> or <HI>stupid</HI> Persons, <HI>heavy</HI> and
<HI>dull Souls,</HI> are seldom much troubled with
Vapours or Lowness of Spirits. The intel∣lectual
Faculty, without all manner of
<PB N="53" REF="91"/>
Doubt, has material and animal Organs, by
which it mediately works, as well as the
animal Functions. What they are, and
how they operate, as, I believe, very few
know, so it is very little necessary to know
them for my present Purpose. As a philo∣sophical
Musician may understand Propor∣tions
and Harmony, and yet never be in a
Condition to gratify a Company with a fine
Piece of Musick, without the Benefit of
Sounds from proper Organs, so the intel∣lectual
Operations (as long as the present
Union between the Soul and Body lasts) can
never be perform'd in the best Manner with∣out
proper Instruments. The Works of <HI>Ima∣gination</HI>
and <HI>Memory,</HI> of <HI>Study, Thinking,</HI> and
<HI>Reflecting,</HI> from whatever Source the Prin∣ciple
on which they depend springs, must
necessarily require bodily Organs. Some
have these Organs finer, quicker, more agile,
and sensible, and perhaps more numerous
than others; <HI>Brute</HI> Animals have few o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
none, at least, none that belong to <HI>Re∣flection;</HI>
Vegetables certainly none at all.
There is no Account to be given how a
<HI>Disease,</HI> a <HI>Fall,</HI> a <HI>Blow,</HI> a <HI>Debauch, Poisons,
violent Passions, astral</HI> and <HI>aerial</HI> Influences,
much Application, and the like, should
possibly alter or destroy these intellectual
Operations without this Supposition. It is
evident, that in <HI>nervous</HI> Distempers, and a
great many other bodily Diseases, these
<PB N="54" REF="92"/>
Faculties, and their Operations, are impair'd,
nay, totally ruin'd and extinguished to all
Appearance; and yet, by proper Remedies,
and after Recovery of Health, they are
restor'd and brought to their former State.
Now since this present Age has made Efforts
to go beyond former Times, in all the Arts
of <HI>Ingenuity, Invention, Study, Learning,</HI> and
all the contemplative and sedentary Pro∣fessions,
(I speak only here of our own Na∣tion,
our own Times, and of the better Sort,
whose chief Employments and Studies these
are) the Organs of these Faculties being
thereby worn and spoil'd, must affect and
deaden the whole <HI>System,</HI> and lay a Foun∣dation
for the Diseases of Lowness and
Weakness. Add to this, that those who
are likeliest to excel and apply in this Man∣ner,
are most capable, and most in hazard of
following that Way of Life which I have
mention'd, as the likeliest to produce these
Diseases. <HI>Great Wits</HI> are generally great
<HI>Epicures,</HI> at least, Men of <HI>Taste.</HI> And the
Bodies and Constitutions of one Generation,
are still more corrupt, infirm, and diseas'd,
than those of the former, as they advance in
Time, and the Use of the Causes assign'd.</P>
<P>§. VI. To all these Considerations, if we
add the present Custom of Living, so much
in great, populous, and over-grown Cities;
<HI>London</HI> (where nervous Distempers are most
<PB N="55" REF="93"/>
frequent, outrageous, and unnatural) is, for
ought I know, the greatest, most capacious,
close, and populous City of the <HI>Globe,</HI> the
infinite Number of Fires, Sulphureous and
Bituminous, the vast Expence of Tallow and
foetid Oil in Candles and Lamps, under and
above Ground, the Clouds of stinking Breaths,
and Perspiration, not to mention the Or∣dure
of so many diseas'd, both intelligent
and unintelligent Animals, the crouded
Churches, Church-yards and Burying Places,
with putrifying Bodies, the <HI>Sinks, Butcher-Houses,
Stables, Dunghils,</HI> &amp;c. and the
necessary Stagnation, Fermentation, and
Mixture of such Variety of all Kinds of
Atoms, are more than sufficient to putrify,
poison, and infect the Air for twenty Miles
round it, and which, in Time, must alter,
weaken, and destroy the healthiest Constitu∣tions
of Animals of all Kinds; and accord∣ingly
it is in such like Cities, that these
Distempers are to be found in their highest
and most astonishing Symptoms, and seldom
any lasting or solid Cure is perform'd till the
Diseased be <HI>rusticated</HI> and purified from the
infectious Air and Damps, transubstantiated
into their Habits, by a great City, and till
they have suck'd in and incorporated the
sweet, balmy, clear Air of the Country,
and driven the other out of their Habit.
For by innumerable Experiments it is cer∣tain,
that the Nitre or Acid of fresh, new
<PB N="56" REF="94"/>
Air, is as necessary towards Life and Health
as fresh balmy Food.</P>
<P>§. VII. ALL these together will, I think,
be sufficient to account for the Frequency
of <HI>Nervous Distempers</HI> of late. And, in
fact, the same Causes pretty near, have been
assign'd by all Observers, Physicians, and
Philosophers, in all Ages and Countries, to
have produc'd similar Effects. The <HI>Egyptians,</HI>
as they seem to have been the first who cul∣tivated
the Arts of Ingenuity and Politeness,
so they seem likewise to have been the first
who brought <HI>Physick</HI> to any tolerable Degree
of Perfection. The antient <HI>Greeks,</HI> while they
lived in their Simplicity and Virtue were
Healthy, Strong, and Valiant: But afterwards,
in Proportion as they advanced in Learning,
and the Knowledge of the Sciences, and
distinguished themselves from other Nations
by their Politeness and Refinement, they
sunk into <HI>Effeminacy, Luxury,</HI> and <HI>Diseases,</HI>
and began to study <HI>Physick,</HI> to remedy those
Evils which their Luxury and Laziness had
brought upon them. In like manner, the
<HI>Romans</HI> fell from their former Bravery,
Courage, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eroick Virtue,</HI> which had
gain'd them the Empire of the World. As
<HI>Celsus</HI> observes, where he is giving some
Account of the Rise and Improvement of
Physick, according to the Prevalency of these
two general Causes of Diseases, <HI>Idleness</HI> and
<PB N="57" REF="95"/>
<HI>Intemperance; That these two had first spoil'd
the Constitutions of the</HI> Greeks, <HI>and after∣wards
those of his own Countrymen the</HI> Ro∣mans,
<HI>when become Masters of the Luxury as
well as the Country of those polite People.</HI></P>
<P>§. VIII. IT were easy to shew, from the
best Philosophy, confirm'd by the most
solid Experience, that Distempers of all
Kinds ow their more remote Origin, Cause,
and Rise to the same Principles: And that
the Pains and Trouble some have taken
to search and discover from <HI>History,</HI> the
Occasions and Times of the Appearance of
such and such Distempers, ends only in
gathering and collecting some new Names,
which Mankind have arbitrarily bestow'd
upon some particular Symptoms, Degrees,
or Paroxysms of universally known Diseases;
and that these Enquiries tho' they may
divert and amuse the Enquirer and the Rea∣der,
like any other Pieces of History: are of
no further Use or Advantage to the World,
than in so far as they at the same Time dis∣cover
the Means and Medicines by which
such Symptoms or Degrees of Distempers
were remedied or overcome. For, I think,
it is plain to a Demonstration, that all Dis∣eases
whatsoever, by whatever Names or
Titles dignified or distinguish'd, so far as
they are natural and internal Distempers,
and not caus'd by Accident, must in the
<PB N="58" REF="96"/>
main proceed (if we suppose, as we must,
that Mankind at first, were Healthy and
Sound) from Intemperance, or some Error
in the Quantity or Quality of their Food,
and Laziness or Neglect of due Exercise: by
which as the Solids and Juices of the Parents
have been spoil'd, so their Posterity by con∣tinuing
the same Courses have gradually suf∣fer'd
higher and more extreme Disorders or
Symptoms, arising from the same general
Causes: which upon their first Appearance
receiving new Names by their Observers, as
new and particular Distempers, have in∣creas'd
to such a Number, as to exhibit that
numerous Train of Miseries with which our
<HI>Books of Physick</HI> and <HI>Bills of Mortality</HI> are
fill'd: And as the Age grew worse, and
the same Causes have been continued, and
consequently the Constitutions more de∣prav'd,
not only more numerous, but higher
and more terrible Symptoms have arisen, till
they have come at last to such a Degree of
Malignity, as to infect and contaminate by
mere Touch or Contact; nay, even by the
Smoak or Steam emitted from such diseas'd
Habits. Not that I would deny that <HI>Sea∣sons,
Climates, astral</HI> and <HI>aerial</HI> Influences,
and many other Circumstances, had any Effect
or Influence in begetting or propagating
these Distempers, but that these are slight,
partial, and occasional Causes only, in respect
of those others mention'd. And he that
<PB N="59" REF="97"/>
will consult History, will find sufficient
Arguments to draw the same Conclusions.</P>
<P>§. IX. ALL Diseases have in some Degree
or other, or in Embryo, been extant at all
Times, at least, might have been, if the
efficient Causes, <HI>Idleness</HI> and <HI>Luxury,</HI> had
been sufficiently set to <HI>work,</HI> which were
chiefly in the Power of Men themselves.
What we call Nervous Distempers, were
certainly, in some small Degree, known
and observ'd by the <HI>Greek, Roman,</HI> and
<HI>Arabian</HI> Physicians, tho' not such a Number
of them as now, nor with so high Symptoms,
so as to be so particularly taken Notice of,
except those call'd <HI>Hysterick,</HI> which seem to
have been known in <HI>Greece,</HI> from whence
they have deriv'd their Name: But as they
were probably a stronger People, and liv'd
in a warmer Climate, the slow, cold, and
nervous Diseases were less known and ob∣serv'd;
the Distempers of all the <HI>Eastern</HI>
and <HI>Southern</HI> Countries being mostly <HI>acute.</HI></P>
<P>§. X. WHEN these general Causes I
have mention'd, came to exist in some more
considerable Degree, and operate in the
more <HI>Northern</HI> Climates, then these Nervous
Diseases began to shew themselves more
eminently, and appear with higher and more
numerous, and atrocious Symptoms. <HI>Syden∣ham,</HI>
our Countryman, was the Physician of
<PB N="60" REF="98"/>
Note who made the most particular and full
Observations on them, and establish'd them
into a particular Class and Tribe, with a
proper, tho' different, Method of Cure from
other chronical and humorous Distempers,
tho' their true Nature, Cause, and Cure has
been less universally laboured and known,
than that of most other Diseases, so that
those who could give no tolerable Account
of them have call'd them <HI>Vapours, Spleen,
Flatus, Nervous, Hysterical,</HI> and <HI>Hypochon∣driacal</HI>
Distempers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the true Nature of the Fibres and
Nerves.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. THE Fibres are <HI>small, transpa∣rent,
solid,</HI> and <HI>elastick,</HI> or
springy Threads or Filaments.</P>
<P>BY <HI>Fibres,</HI> I mean here the least and
smallest Threads in the Composition, of
which many unite to make one sensible
<HI>Fibre.</HI> Our Hairs, which are a Kind of
<HI>Fibres,</HI> may be divided and split into a great
<PB N="61" REF="99"/>
Number of small ones, evident to the naked
Eye; but <HI>Leewenhoeck,</HI> by his Glasses, has
discover'd five or six hundred of them in
one visible <HI>Fibre.</HI> They are <HI>transparent,</HI>
as is evident, when sufficiently wash'd and
cleans'd from the Skins, Humours and Fluids
that adhere to them. The <HI>last</HI> and ultimate
<HI>Fibres</HI> must of Necessity be <HI>Solid;</HI> for a <HI>Fibre</HI>
that has a Cavity must consist of several
others that go to make up its Coat; but
even the smallest compound <HI>Fibres</HI> may be
likewise <HI>solid,</HI> and consist of the simple ones,
as a Silk Thread is made up of the Filaments
of the raw Silk; for the best Glasses disco∣ver
no Cavity in them, at least, they are
not fairly prov'd to be Tubular or Hollow
by the Appearance they give of some Cavi∣ties,
when view'd thro' a Microscope, since
what appears to some to be so, may be no
other than the Interstices between them; as
seems highly probable from their lying ob∣lique
to the Length of the <HI>Fibres,</HI> to which
they ought to run parallel, if these <HI>Fibres</HI>
were Tubular. But other Arguments to
confirm this shall be assign'd in their proper
Place. They are <HI>elastick</HI> or springy, as ap∣pears
by a <HI>Fibre,</HI> or a Muscle's contracting
(when divided) towards both Extremities;
and that Heat and Puncture stimulate them
into involuntary Spasms and Convulsions.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="100"/>
§. II. ALL the Solids of the Body, when
duly prepar'd, resolve themselves, or may
be separated into such <HI>Fibres</HI> at last. They
are probably platted and twisted together in
the Manner I have describ'd, to make the
larger sensible <HI>Fibres:</HI> And these again are
either united in Bundles to form the <HI>Muscles,
Tendons, Ligaments,</HI> &amp;c. or woven into a
fine <HI>Web,</HI> like Cloth, to make the <HI>Mem∣branes,</HI>
the Coats of the Vessels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> only in
some the longitudinal, in others the trans∣verse
<HI>Fibres</HI> are larger and stronger; or
these last are rolled <HI>spirally,</HI> according to the
particular Office or Function design'd to be
perform'd by them. The Structure of the
Bones seems to be like that of a Piece of
Linen roll'd upon a <HI>Cylinder,</HI> thro' which
a vast Number of Pins are stuck perpendi∣cular
to the Surface, to keep it from unrol∣ling.
These, and doubtless many other,
Methods of Texture are made use of by the
Infinitely-wise Author of Nature, in the Fa∣brick
of the Solids of the Animal Machin.
We must content our selves, in the Explica∣tion
of the Works of Nature, with Allu∣sions
to those of Art, that come nearest the
Case where philosophick Nicety is not in∣tended.</P>
<P>§. III. THE sensible or compound <HI>Fibres,</HI>
as they are found in the Structure of an Ani∣mal
<PB N="63" REF="101"/>
Machin, are of three Kinds. <HI>First,</HI>
Some are of a looser and softer Texture, or
of a weaker Spring and Elasticity, contract∣ing
easily and readily, and requiring only a
small Force to distend them, being moistened
with a greater Quantity of Blood; (which
makes them look red) and such are all the
<HI>Muscular Fibres,</HI> which are employed in the
Composition of the Instruments of voluntary
or animal Motion, whose greater Action
requires a greater Quantity of balmy, warm
Moisture, to preserve their due Degree of
<HI>Tension,</HI> and repair their casual and ordinary
Decays. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Others are of a closer and
more compact Disposition, the smaller <HI>Fibres</HI>
whereof they are compos'd, being more
firmly and intimately united, and crowded
or compress'd into a smaller Space, in con∣sequence
of which their <HI>elastick</HI> Force is
greater, they contract with greater Strength
and Quickness, and are with more Difficulty
distended, being moisten'd with a thinner,
more rare, milky and watery Fluid, because
of their solid Texture, to keep them from
growing rigid or hard, and such are the
Fibres of the Membranes, Tendons and
Nerves, whose Compactness and closer Union
of Parts, seems to be the Reason of the
greater Degree of Sensibility they are evi∣dently
endued with above those of the first
Kind. The Motion or Impression commu∣nicated
to them, being thereby less inter∣rupted,
<PB N="64" REF="102"/>
broken or lost; and the last of these
particularly, to wit, the <HI>Nerves,</HI> are made use
of to communicate the Impression they receive
from outward Objects, or the muscular Fibres
to the <HI>Sensorium</HI> in the Brain, and by it to the
sentient Principle or <HI>Musician,</HI> and from it to
the Organs. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> There is yet another
Sort of these compound Fibres of a hard and
rigid Make, whose <HI>Elasticity</HI> is like that of
Steel, and not of the so distractile Kind,
like those before mention'd, and consequent∣ly,
being neither fit for Sensation or Action,
they are only employ'd as a Support or
Security for the tender Solids, requiring only
a little Oil to keep them from growing too
dry or brittle; and of this Kind are the
Fibres of the Bones. Every single Fibre has
a particular Membran involving it, like the
Bark on a Tree, and some particular Clusters
have another Membran binding the Whole.</P>
<P>§. IV. FROM this Account of the <HI>Fibres</HI>
in general, if just, it is plain, that in their
original Constitutions they are much the
same, and that their different Properties and
Appearances arise only out of the various
Methods of Texture employ'd in their Com∣position,
according to the Uses they were
intended for. It is likewise probable, that
all the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Body (except those of
the hard and rigid Kind, whereof the Bones
are compos'd) are sensible, more or less,
<PB N="65" REF="103"/>
according to their Density or Closeness of
their Texture, or the Degrees of their <HI>elastick</HI>
or <HI>distractile</HI> Force, consequent thereupon,
and their Communication with the Brain;
the <HI>Nerves</HI> being only some of these Fibres
the most susceptible, by their Structure of
communicating Action and Motion, made
use of to convey such Impressions, as they
receive from outward Objects, or the other
Fibres (however this Intercourse is carried
on between them, whether by Engrafting,
like the Blood Vessels, or otherwise, I shall
not determin) to the Seat of the Intelligent
or sensitive Principle, and to carry back from
thence the first Tendency of Action to the
<HI>Muscular Fibres,</HI> when they contract or relax,
in order to the several Functions of the <HI>Ani∣mal
OEconomy.</HI> To tell precisely in what
Manner this is perform'd, is, perhaps, impos∣sible,
I am sure very difficult; nor do I
think it any ways necessary to what I have
to propose, concerning the Nature and Cure
of <HI>Nervous Distempers,</HI> commonly so call'd.
I am of Opinion, that these Disorders do not
so properly depend upon one Kind of <HI>Animal
Fibres,</HI> that particularly of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> as
is commonly suppos'd, unless it be in small
and Topical Disorders of the nervous Kind:
but that when there are general internal
Diseases, and that many of the <HI>Fibres</HI> and
<HI>Nerves</HI> suffer, the whole <HI>System,</HI> or all the
Solids of the Body (except those which are
<PB N="66" REF="104"/>
firm and hard) suffer together in some De∣gree
or other.</P>
<P>§. V. THAT there is a certain <HI>Tone, Con∣sistence,</HI>
and Firmness, and a determin'd
Degree of <HI>Elasticity</HI> and <HI>Tension</HI> of the Nerves
or Fibres, how small soever that be, (for it
must be in some Degree even in Fluids them∣selves)
necessary to the perfect Performance
of the <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> is, I think, with∣out
all Question, from an Excess <HI>over</HI> or
Defect <HI>under</HI> which, in some eminent De∣gree,
Diseases of one Kind or another
certainly arise. Those I am chiefly con∣cern'd
for in the following Treatise, are
what proceeds from the Defect, or that De∣gree
which falls below the just Mediocrity
necessary for perfect Health: That is, those
Diseases that ensue upon a too lax, seeble,
and <HI>unelastick</HI> State of the <HI>Fibres</HI> or <HI>Nerves:</HI>
And that every one may, in some measure,
judge whither this be their Case, I shall
hereafter enumerate the Signs and Symptoms
that determin it, after giving the Reader
some Conjectures concerning the Use of the
Fibres, and the Manner of their Functions.</P>

<P>§. I. IT not being my Intent to run into
<HI>philosophical</HI> or speculative Disqui∣sitions
in a practical Treatise, which
I design chiefly for the Use and Benefit of
my <HI>fellow Sufferers</HI> under <HI>nervous</HI> Distempers;
I shall only, with all the Brevity and Perspi∣cuity
I am capable of, represent to the
<HI>curious Reader,</HI> what I have found most pro∣bable
among the <HI>Physicians, Philosophers,</HI>
and <HI>Mathematicians,</HI> upon this intricate and
perplex'd Subject, having, I think, consider'd
Impartially, and with some Attention, all
those who have offer'd any thing solid upon
it; and on this Account chiefly, that the
<HI>curious Reader</HI> may more readily relish some
of the Reasons for Advices of less Moment,
which I suggest for treating of these Distem∣pers
in the best manner my Observation and
Experience have taught me. But I lay
much greater Stress upon the Experience
<PB N="68" REF="106"/>
and Observations themselves, than upon any
<HI>philosophical</HI> Reasons I, or any other, can
suggest; tho', I think, they may not be
without their Evidence, when drawn from
the real Nature of Things, or from the best
Accounts of the <HI>Animal OEconomy</HI> we have
hitherto gain'd, and may sometimes ap∣proach
near to a Demonstration in Subjects
more simple, and more obvious to Sense and
Experiment than those I now treat of.</P>
<P>§. II. IN the <HI>first</HI> place, I take it for
granted, that the <HI>intelligent Principle</HI> is of a
very different, if not quite contrary, Nature
from this organical Machin which contains it;
and has scarce any thing in common to them,
but as they are Substances. It is well
known to <HI>Physicians</HI> what wonderful Effects,
the <HI>Passions,</HI> excited by lucky or unlucky
Accidents, (which are justly reckon'd <HI>Intel∣lectual</HI>
or <HI>Spiritual</HI> Operations) have on the
Pulse, Circulation, Perspiration, and Secre∣tions,
and the other Animal Functions, in
<HI>Nervous</HI> Cases especially, even to the re∣storeing
from Death, and destroying Life, as
innumerable Instances demonstrate. I have
felt a Pulse languishing, interrupting, and
just dying away, render'd strong, full, and
free by a joyful Surprize, and on the con∣trary.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Dr. <HI>Bryan Robinson</HI>'s <HI>Animal OEconomy,</HI> Prop. xxi.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Bryan Robinson</HI>'s Reasoning is
<PB N="69" REF="107"/>
conclusive, and yet I shall give one In∣stance,
of which I myself (with many others)
was an Eye-witness, more coercive, where
an <HI>Effort</HI> of the <HI>Mind</HI> restor'd to Life once
and again (to all Appearances) extinct Ani∣mal
Functions. Now if the Principle of
both Parts of the Compound were one, or if
the Whole had but a material or organical
Principle, or if there were only an external
Spring of Motion and Action, the Functions
dying, expireing, and going down, the Whole
would always die and extinguish. But surely
no different or independent Internal Princi∣ple,
could restore, invigorate and actuate the
dead or just dying material and animal Func∣tions,
as in this last Case<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Part 3d, the Case of Col. <HI>Townshend.</HI></NOTE>. I have for∣merly
suggested, that the best <HI>Similitude</HI> I
can form of the Nature and Actions of this
<HI>Principle</HI> upon the <HI>Organs</HI> of its Machin, is
that of a skilful <HI>Musician</HI> playing on a well∣tun'd
Instrument. So long as the Instrument
is in due Order, so long is the Musick perfect
and compleat in its Kind. As it weakens
or breaks, the <HI>Harmony</HI> is spoil'd or stop'd.
Some of the Parts of this Instrument being
more delicate than others, are sooner disor∣der'd
or broken. The great and principal
ones, which preside over and actuate the lesser,
are Strong and Durable, and require a greater
<PB N="70" REF="108"/>
Force and Violence to disorder them; but
when once they are worn out, spoil'd, and
ruin'd, the lesser and dependent ones are in∣volv'd
in their Fate, and the <HI>Musician</HI> must
necessarily shift his Place and Scene. It is
the Nature of all material Organs to decay
and be worn out by Time. The Divisibi∣lity
of Matter, the Friction of the Parts upon
one another, and the Action of the Bodies
that surround them, make this inevitable;
but Accidents, Violence, and Mismanage∣ment
will quicken and forward their Ruin.</P>
<P>§. III. MATERIAL Objects can act no
otherwise upon material Instruments, than
by communicating their Action and Motion
to them, or, at least, to the <HI>Medium,</HI> Fluid,
or subtil Matter that surrounds them; that
is, material Objects can act no otherwise
upon animal Organs, but either immediately
by communicating their Action and Motion
to these Organs, and putting their consti∣tuent
Parts into particular Vibrations, in∣testine
Action and Reaction upon one an∣other:
or mediately by the Intervention of
some <HI>subtil Fluid</HI> or Matter on which they
impress their Actions and Motions, which
are transmitted by the <HI>Medium,</HI> in the same
Manner to the Organ. Small Bodies act
upon one another in the same Manner, and
by the same Laws and Mechanism, that the
<HI>Systems</HI> of greater ones do: And he who
<PB N="71" REF="109"/>
would understand the Effects of little Bodies,
Fluids, or material Spirits upon greater Bo∣dies,
and the Nature of the Action of their
Particles upon one another, has nothing to
do, (if he reasons justly) but to resemble
small Bodies to great, under particular Laws
and Conditions. To apply this general
Doctrine to the Case in Hand: We may
conclude, that <HI>Smelling,</HI> for Example, is
nothing but the Action of an odorous Body,
or the Steam or Vapour emitted from it,
giving a determin'd Impulse to the Nerves
or Fibres of the Nostrils, which, by their
<HI>Mechanism,</HI> propagate this Vibration and
Impulse, thro' their Length to the intelli∣gent
or <HI>sentient Principle</HI> in the Brain (which
I resemble to the <HI>Musician</HI>). Again, <HI>Feeling</HI>
is nothing but the Impulse, Motion, or
Action of Bodies, gently or violently im∣pressing
the Extremities or Sides of the
Nerves, of the Skin, or other Parts of the
Body, which by their Structure and <HI>Mecha∣nism,</HI>
convey this Motion to the <HI>Sentient</HI> Prin∣ciple
in the Brain, or the <HI>Musician.</HI> Lastly,
<HI>Seeing,</HI> or the Perception of the Bulk,
Distance, Situation, or Colour of Objects, is
nothing but the Action of Light (a Fluid of
its own Kind) reflected or refracted from the
Surfaces of Bodies or outward Objects (some
of which scatter the Rays from one another,
in an infinite Variety of <HI>Angles,</HI> and so by
<HI>Experience</HI> determin their <HI>Distance</HI> and
<PB N="72" REF="110"/>
<HI>Bulk:</HI> And transmit one Kind of Rays
more copiously than another, to determin
their <HI>Colour</HI>) which being variously re∣fracted
in the Humours of the <HI>Eyes,</HI> are at last
united on the <HI>Retina,</HI> so as there to form an
<HI>Image</HI> analogous to that of the outward Ob∣ject,
which by striking the Nerves of the
<HI>Retina,</HI> (in the same Manner that the Object
it self would have done) is by them trans∣mitted
to the <HI>sentient Principle.</HI> It is much
after the same Manner in all the other In∣struments
of the Sensations.</P>
<P>§. IV. WHAT is the true Cause of <HI>Elasti∣city</HI>
in general, or that of the <HI>animal Fibres</HI>
and <HI>Nerves</HI> in particular, is, I think, an un∣explicable
<HI>Problem,</HI> unless we admit of a
centrifugal or repelling Fluid. Even the
true Nature and Cause of <HI>Cohesion</HI> and <HI>Con∣tinuity</HI>
it self was uncertain till of late, and
as yet is too general, as far as this Kind of
Fluid or subtile Spirit explains it. The
Principle of <HI>Attraction</HI> both in great and
little Bodies, is evident from innumerable
Experiments; but what the Laws of this
general Principle may be, in all <HI>Systems</HI> of
Bodies; or what Limitations or Restrictions
it may undergo, to solve the particular Ap∣pearances,
is, I fear, as yet imperfect. Per∣haps
Generals, in Natural Philosophy, (as
well as some other Sciences) are all that we
can attain to in our present State (for it
<PB N="73" REF="111"/>
seems Precision is a Contradiction to Fini∣tude).
We see indeed that Bodies of plain,
smooth Surfaces, or in which many Points
come into Contact, cohere most strongly,
which must necessarily follow from the
Principle of <HI>Attraction.</HI> Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>
has shewn the <HI>Analogy</HI> of Bodies flying from
one another; or their having a Principle of
<HI>Repulsion,</HI> to <HI>negative Quantities,</HI> in <HI>Algebra</HI>
and <HI>Geometry,</HI> and to some other Appear∣ances
in Nature: whereby he hints a proba∣ble
Account of the Elasticity and the Com∣pression
of the Air: And the same Manner of
Philosophising, duly applied and suited to
Circumstances, will equally account for the
<HI>Elasticity</HI> of all Fluids whatsoever, and per∣haps
of Solids too. There are some Experi∣ments
upon Bodies, that seem to prove
the real Existence of such a Principle in Na∣ture
as <HI>Repulsion:</HI> for Example, (not to men∣tion
others, of which there are a great
Number, that enforce the same Conclusion)
<HI>That</HI> whereby a smooth <HI>Prism,</HI> rubb'd strong∣ly,
drives Leas-Gold from it, and suspends
it till its Influence is withdrawn, <HI>Hawsbee</HI>'s
Experiments on an exhausted Glass <HI>Sphere</HI> or
<HI>Cylinder</HI> violently turn'd on an <HI>Axis:</HI> Water
rising in a <HI>hyperbolick</HI> Line above the Sur∣face,
and <HI>Mercury</HI> subsiding below it in the
same Curve, and a great many other such
Experiments. We see also, that a Body
under a circular Rotation, has a constant
<PB N="74" REF="112"/>
Tendency to fly off in the Tangent, which
a certain <HI>late Author</HI> has made Use of to
explain <HI>Elasticity</HI> by (tho', I think, with
indifferent Success). Now tho' all these
Appearances may possibly be accounted for
from other Principles, different from that of
<HI>Elasticity,</HI> yet, I think, they may be suffi∣cient
to illustrate this Principle of <HI>Repulsion.
Animal</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Substances, such as
<HI>Ivory, Whale-Bone,</HI> the <HI>Tendons</HI> and <HI>muscular</HI>
Substances of Animals, <HI>Cork, Sponge,</HI> &amp;c.
are the most perfectly <HI>elastick</HI> of any Bodies
known, which makes it highly probable,
that the Actions, Sensations, and Functions
of Animals and Vegetables, are owing, in
some measure, to this <HI>Elasticity</HI> in the Solids:
And <HI>Metalick</HI> and <HI>Mineral</HI> Bodies (as is well
known) have their elastick Properties in∣creas'd
and augmented by <HI>Animal</HI> and <HI>Vege∣table
Salts</HI> united with them while they are
in <HI>Fusion</HI> by Fire.</P>
<P>§. V. THE most difficult Problem in all
the Animal OEconomy, is, to give any
tolerable Account of <HI>Muscular Action</HI> or
<HI>Animal Motion.</HI> The Similitude of a Ma∣chin
put into Action and Motion by the
Force of Water convey'd in Pipes, was the
readiest Resemblance the <HI>Lazy</HI> could find to
explain <HI>Muscular Motion</HI> by. It was easy,
from this Resemblance, to forge a thin, im∣perceptible
Fluid, passing and re-passing
<PB N="75" REF="113"/>
through the Nerves, to blow up the Mus∣cles,
and thereby to lengthen one of their
Dimensions, in order to shorten the other.
On such a slender and imaginary Similitude,
the precarious <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of <HI>Animal Spirits</HI>
seems to be built. But as their Existence is,
I fear, precarious, so, were it real, they
are not sufficient to solve the Appear∣ances,
as shall be more particularly con∣sider'd
hereafter. All I shall further say
here, is, that this and the other abstruse
Appearances in the Animal and Vegetable
Kingdoms, particularly <HI>Vegetation, Elasti∣city,
Cohesion,</HI> the Emission, Reflexions and
Refractions of <HI>Light, Attraction</HI> in the
greater and lesser Bodies, and all the other
secret and internal Actions of the Parts of
Matter upon one another, are with some
shew of Possibility suspected, and by some
Observations (not otherwise to be accounted
for) made not improbable by the late <HI>saga∣cious
and learned Sir</HI> Isaac Newton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Opticks, Book III.</NOTE>, to be
owing to an infinitely subtil, elastick Fluid,
or Spirit, (as he strongly expresses that subtil
Matter) distended thro' this whole <HI>System,</HI>
penetrating all Bodies with the greatest
Facility, infinitely active and volatile, but
more condens'd in <HI>Vacuo,</HI> or Spaces void of
grosser Matter, than towards the Surfaces of
<PB N="76" REF="114"/>
Bodies, or in them: And by this <HI>Aether,
Spirit,</HI> or most subtile Fluid, the Parts of
Bodies are driven forcibly together, and their
mutual attractive Virtue arises, and the other
beforemention'd Appearances are produced.
The Existence of this <HI>subtil Fluid</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI>
is made probable by what he has observ'd
of Liquors, <HI>heating</HI> and <HI>cooling,</HI> Mercury
rising and continuing rais'd, and smooth
Bodies clinging together, and requiring an
equal Force to separate them in <HI>Vacuo,</HI> or
in an exhausted Receiver, as in Air: And a
great many other Experiments have been sug∣gested
not otherwise to be so readily ac∣counted
for. And it is probable, that those
other mention'd Appearances may be owing
to the same Cause, since we find always
<HI>similar</HI> Effects have <HI>similar</HI> Causes, and that
Nature is frugal in <HI>Causes,</HI> but various and
manifold in <HI>Effects:</HI> But Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> not having
been able to make a sufficient Number of
Experiments to determin all the Laws of
this Fluid, nor indeed sufficient absolutely to
prove its Existence, he leaves it to the Saga∣city
of future Ages to determin them, and
to apply them to the Appearances; and
finding nothing in the Writings of other
<HI>Philosophers, Mathematicians,</HI> or <HI>Physicians,</HI>
of equal Probability with this, tho' imperfect
Account of these Difficulties, I will offer the
Reader no other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Existence of animal Spirits, and
of their Use to account for animal
Motion, and the other animal Fun∣ctions.</HEAD>
<P>§. I. THE Doctrine of Spirits, to ex∣plain
the animal Functions and
their Diseases, has been so
readily and universally receiv'd from the
Days of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Physicians (and higher)
down to our present Times, that scarce one
(except here and there a <HI>Heretick</HI> of late)
has call'd this <HI>Catholick</HI> Doctrine in question.
And those who perhaps had Courage or
Curiosity enough to doubt of, or examine
the Matter, either out of Laziness, or to
avoid a tedious Way of expressing them∣selves,
have implicitly gone into the com∣mon
Dialect which is now very convenient.
The <HI>System</HI> at first was but rude and imper∣fect,
but having been adopted by <HI>Philoso∣phers</HI>
and <HI>Mathematicians,</HI> as well as <HI>Phy∣sicians,</HI>
they have brought it to a more con∣sistent
<PB N="78" REF="116"/>
and less absurd <HI>Theory. Borelli</HI> gave
it a great Countenance, by receiving it to
explain <HI>muscular</HI> Motion, in his Book <HI>De
Motu Animalium. Willis</HI> gave it all the
Advantages of Eloquence and Metaphor.
<HI>John Bernoulli</HI> has added to it a Kind of
Geometry and Calculation. And last of
all Mons. <HI>des Molieres,</HI> in the <HI>Memoirs de
l'Academie Royal</HI> for 1724, has added Plain∣ness,
and some Conformity to the Natural
Appearances, and taken off most of the
common Objections. I shall not tire myself,
nor the Reader, by detailing the <HI>System</HI> at
length, nor the several Steps by which it
has been reformed and amended. <HI>Goelike,</HI>
Professor at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> in a small Treatise,
has solidly expos'd and ridicul'd it as far as
<HI>Borelli</HI> went, or the precedent or co-tempo∣rary
Physicians: And that admirable Geo∣meter
Dr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> has, I believe, <HI>geome∣trically</HI>
shewn the Insufficiency of what <HI>Ber∣noulli</HI>
has advanced to mend the Matter, in
his Preface to Mr. <HI>Cowper</HI>'s Book on the
<HI>Muscles.</HI> I shall therefore only suggest
some general Reflexions, which perhaps
equally distress this <HI>System,</HI> however improv'd
or amended.</P>
<P>§. II. I WILL not urge, that the best Eyes
or Senses, however assisted, have not hither∣to
been able to discover any Cavity in the
Substance of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> or in the small
<PB N="79" REF="117"/>
Filaments into which they are divided.
That, on the contrary, as far as <HI>Leewen∣hoeck</HI>
(the best Observer doubtless) or others
who have examin'd the Matter with great
Accuracy, could perceive: they appear solid,
transparent, and with broken Reflexions, even
when dry, like crack'd <HI>Glass-Wire, Horn,</HI> or
any other solid Substance, without any ap∣parent
Cavity. Nor that by compressing
them by <HI>Ligatures,</HI> stopping the Influx, or
by stroaking and milching their Lengths,
are any Appearances to be observ'd like
those in other Vessels, which we know do
carry Fluids in them, more than must neces∣sarily
happen from compressing the small
Arteries that go along by them. It is true,
that by stopping and tying the Trunks of
the greater Nerves, the Muscle it self will
turn <HI>Paralytick</HI> and Motionless, but it will
equally do so upon intercepting the Motion
or Influx of the Blood, which concludes
nothing but this, that these <HI>Nerves</HI> are
necessary towards the Action of the Muscles,
whether from their carrying a Fluid, or
from their own <HI>Tonick</HI> Nature, their internal
Configuration, or any other Manner they
may act, is not thereby determin'd. And
if Probabilities could any way influence a
Fact, they must lie on the other Side of the
Question, since that thin and soft Liquor,
which seems only fit to keep them moist and
lax, rather derogates from the Existence of
<PB N="80" REF="118"/>
any spirituous Fluid in them proper for the
intended End. Nor, <HI>thirdly,</HI> will I urge
against it Dr. <HI>Glisson</HI>'s Experiment of putting
the Arm of a strong, brawny Porter into a
large Tube full of Water, and fixing it close
to his Shoulder, that the Water might not
get out, but ascend into a small <HI>conical</HI> Tube,
passing out of the Side of the larger one:
whereby he found, that upon the strongest
Action of the Muscles, the Water subsided
and fell in the small Tube, and rose
again upon their ceasing to act; from
whence he concludes, that <HI>Muscular Mo∣tion</HI>
is not performed by the Inflation or
Swelling of the Muscles, but that, on the
contrary, when they are mov'd, they are
contracted into a lesser Figure, and more com∣pact
Substance, or are hardened: which would
scarcely happen, if any Matter, how subtil so
ever, flow'd in the Nerves, and thereby was
added to the Substance of the Muscles: For
since the <HI>Impenetrability</HI> of Matter is demon∣strable,
the least such an Addition could
effect, was, that tho' the Fluid, by its Sub∣tilty,
would not sensibly increase the Bulk,
yet surely it could not lessen it. I say, I shall
not urge these obvious Objections against this
Doctrine; because, tho' I think they cannot
be solidly answer'd, yet they may be evaded;
but shall proceed to offer a few Considera∣tions,
which I think equally distress it, in
<PB N="81" REF="119"/>
all the Improvements that have been made
on it.</P>
<P>§. III. SOME have imagin'd the Nature
of this Fluid of <HI>animal Spirits,</HI> to have some
Resemblance with that of Light, (the most
subtil, active and penetrating Fluid appa∣rent
in this our <HI>System</HI>) which would make
them quickly penetrate, fly through, tear,
break; and consume their rare and tender
Prisons, which would be of no more Use
to them, to determin them to regular
and uniform Motions, than Glass Tubes are
to Light. And were they like <HI>urinous</HI> or
<HI>inflammable Spirits;</HI> yet neither would such
slender Prisons contain them any Time, or
convey them uniformly for regular Purposes.
And <HI>lastly,</HI> if they were like Water or
aqueous Fluids, they could neither have
Activity nor Subtilty sufficient to solve the
Appearances, nor could they move with
Velocity enough to answer the Purposes of
Volition, Sensation, and voluntary or invo∣luntary
Motions, under that more gross and
sluggish Form, and would even then ouze
thro' their containing Tubes.</P>
<P>§. IV. IN a Word, give them what Na∣ture
you will, they will never answer the
<HI>animal Functions</HI> and Appearances. For
suppose them to have any Resemblance to
the other Fluids in our <HI>System;</HI> if extremely
<PB N="82" REF="120"/>
volatile and active, they would fly away
and tear in a very short Time their contain∣ing
Tubes and Canals the <HI>Nerves,</HI> and could
not receive regular Determinations from
them; and yet such they must be, to answer
the Ends of Volition and Sensation: And
if they were grosser, denser and less refin'd,
they would not answer quick and sudden
Motion, and its Cessation. And they can
never be suppos'd to be extremely active
and volatile, and gross, and thick at the
same Time. We find in <HI>Dropsies,</HI> that a
grosser Fluid, than they can be suppos'd to
be, will ouze in great Quantities thro' Ves∣sels
of as close a Texture as theirs; not to
mention the sudden Effects of all Kinds of
Spirits (taken inwardly) upon the <HI>Nerves,</HI>
which from this Appearance must even be
suppos'd to penetrate the Substance of these
<HI>Nerves,</HI> and yet the nervous Fluid must
be, at least, as subtil and penetrating as
they.</P>
<P>§. V. QUICK and instantaneous, strong,
and violent Motions (increas'd by adding
great Weights, as we know by Experience)
seem absolutely to have determin'd the Na∣ture
of animal Spirits, to that of the most
active and volatile Kind of Fluids imaginable,
because none else is capable of so quick and
strong Actions, in order to determin the
instantaneous Obedience of the Muscles to the
<PB N="83" REF="121"/>
Orders of the Will: And such strong, violent,
and quick Motions must necessarily make a
great Waste and Expence of these animal
Spirits, so as to require a constant Supply of
such fine and subtil Parts from the Food:
And yet we find that aqueous, vegetable, and
earthy Substances only, make up most of
the Nourishment of those who have the best
and strongest Spirits, and live in a constant
Course of such Action; and the animal Heat,
employ'd to generate them, rises no higher
than that of Vegetation or Incubation only,
which is not sufficient for any other Kinds of
Spirits, inflammatory or urinous. <HI>But</HI> how
any Fluid at all, of what Kind soever, can be
suppos'd or imagin'd to go backwards and for∣wards
in the same indivisible Instant almost,
(to convey Pain, for Example, to the sentient
Principle, and muscular Action at the same
Instant, to shut the Eyes upon Appearances
of Danger, or to actuate all the Muscles
necessary for running away under a <HI>Panick,</HI>
and a thousand other Instances that may be
given) seems very hard to explain from the
Nature of Fluids known here below.</P>
<P>§. VI. THE Existence of animal Spirits,
has been chiefly contriv'd to solve the Appear∣ances
of <HI>nervous Distempers, viz.</HI> Obstructions
of the Nerves, or their Incapacity to act
under some Circumstances. Now if these
Appearances can be accounted for, more
<PB N="84" REF="122"/>
conformably to the <HI>Analogy</HI> of Nature without
this Supposition than by it, then the Dispute
will be at an End, and they useless. Of this
last the Reader will be a better Judge, when
he has consider'd the whole of this Treatise.
As to the Obstructions of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> since
they are plainly <HI>cylindrical,</HI> (or nearly such)
it does not seem agreeable to <HI>Mechanism,</HI> that
any Fluid should readily be obstructed in
them. For whatever Fluid, of whatever
Nature, can enter the one Extremity in the
<HI>Brain,</HI> will move on by the same Impulse to
the other. For <HI>Example,</HI> a Ball of the same
or less <HI>Diameter</HI> than the Cavity of a <HI>cylin∣drical</HI>
Tube will move (by the Force first im∣press'd)
from one End to the other, without
Stop or Hindrance from the Tube; unless it
be from external Accidents or Bruises altering
the Figure of the Tube; and the same may
be concluded of any Fluid: which makes <HI>Ob∣structions</HI>
pretty unaccountable in <HI>cylindrical</HI>
Tubes: Besides, it is no small Prejudice
against any Fluids moving in the nervous
Fibres, even that their Figure is <HI>cylindrical;</HI>
for we see in all Tubes that contain Fluids,
(as the <HI>Veins, Arteries,</HI> and <HI>Lympheducts</HI>)
to accelerate the Motion of the Fluid,
their internal Figure is <HI>conical,</HI> or tapering,
or nearly so, which readily accounts for the
Obstructions in these last mention'd Vessels;
and it is not improbable, that Nature, which
is always similar or consistent with it self, had
<PB N="85" REF="123"/>
the Nerves been design'd to carry a Fluid,
would have hollow'd them in this Form.
And, on the contrary, the frequent Obstruc∣tions
that happen in those Vessels, which are
of this mention'd <HI>conical</HI> Figure, and the
Hardness of such Obstructions, may be suffi∣cient
to account for the Obstructions of the
<HI>Nerves</HI> themselves. From all which we may,
I think, pretty firmly conclude, that the No∣tion
of <HI>animal Spirits</HI> is of the same Leaven
with the <HI>substantial Forms</HI> of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and
the <HI>coelestial System</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy.</HI></P>
<P>§. VII. PERHAPS there may be in Nature
material Systems of Fluids of several Degrees
of Rarity and Subtilty, even indefinitely many
and different. What makes it not impossible,
that there may be more such <HI>Systems</HI> of subtil,
elastick Fluids, than that mention'd <HI>Aether</HI>
describ'd by Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> is, that the
<HI>Elasticity, Attraction,</HI> and other Qualities of
this <HI>Newtonian aether,</HI> must necessarily be
caus'd by some other more <HI>aetherial</HI> and subtil
Fluid, else we must admit <HI>Elasticity, Attrac∣tion,</HI>
and <HI>Activity</HI> in the Particles constitute∣ing
this <HI>Newtonian Aether</HI> without a Cause;
or we must suppose these Qualities innate to
them, and to have been impress'd on them
immediately by the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>supreme Cause.</HI>
And thus we are necessarily thrown into one
or other of the two <HI>Horns</HI> of this <HI>Dilemma,</HI>
either to admit of Fluids descending <HI>in infi∣nitum,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="124"/>
in Tenuity and Subtilty, to produce
<HI>Elasticity</HI> and <HI>Attraction,</HI> or allow Particles
of Matter impress'd with these Qualities in
their Creation immediately by the <HI>supreme
Being.</HI> It is true, this <HI>Newtonian Aether</HI>
advances us one Step further into the Nature
of Things; but here we must necessarily
stop, the Works of <HI>God</HI> appearing literally
Inscrutable to Perfection. A few of the first
Steps we may go in this <HI>infinit Progression,</HI>
but in all the Works of <HI>God</HI> there is a <HI>ne plus
ultra;</HI> perhaps it may be in the inanimate
material <HI>System</HI> of Things, as it is most cer∣tainly
in the <HI>Animal</HI> Kingdom, that Nature and
its Author, to distinguish itself from finite
<HI>Mechanism,</HI> always operates by <HI>Systems</HI> and
<HI>Organs</HI> in Number even infinite, if not <HI>infinite</HI>
in the highest Sense, yet certainly indefinite or
<HI>infinite</HI> in a <HI>relative</HI> Sense, and in Regard to a
finite Capacity; and thus he leaves <HI>Images</HI> and
<HI>Signatures</HI> of himself on all his Works, as is
manifest in <HI>Quantity, Time,</HI> and <HI>Motion,</HI> and
their Signs or Characters, <HI>infinite Divisibility,
infinite Progressions, Eternity, Series's,</HI> and
<HI>Fluxions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Mercury</HI> is grosser or denser
than <HI>Water, Water</HI> than <HI>Air, Air</HI> than <HI>Light,
Light</HI> than <HI>Aether,</HI> and how far further Na∣ture
may go in descending in Tenuity, Sub∣tilty,
and Refining of other <HI>Systems</HI> of Fluids,
none alive can certainly tell. This as a Con∣jecture
the <HI>Analogy</HI> of Things, the infinite
Divisibility or Encrease of Matter, from finite,
<PB N="87" REF="125"/>
till it becomes infinitely great or small, at
least, as to our Conceptions; Nature's never
passing from <HI>Positive</HI> to <HI>Negative</HI> Quantities,
till it goes thro' the Medium of <HI>Nothing,</HI> or
infinitely small of the same Denomination; its
never passing from Motion to Rest, but thro'
infinitely small Motion: In a Word, its never
acting in Generals, by <HI>Starts, Jumps,</HI> or un∣equal
Steps; I say all these Hints seem to
point out something like this. From all
which, and a great deal more might be urg'd,
it may not be improbable, that as in Quantity
there is one or more <HI>Means</HI> between the <HI>least</HI>
and the <HI>greatest:</HI> so in <HI>Substances</HI> of all Kinds,
there may be Intermediates between <HI>pure, im∣material
Spirit</HI> and <HI>gross Matter,</HI> and that
this intermediate, material Substance, may
make the Cement between the human Soul
and Body, and may be the Instrument or <HI>Me∣dium</HI>
of all its Actions and Functions, where
material Organs are not manifest: And may
possibly be the Cause of the other secret and
inscrutable <HI>Mysteries</HI> of Nature, and the same
(for ought I know) with Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s
infinitely <HI>fine and elastick Fluid</HI> or <HI>Spirit;</HI>
mention'd in a former Chapter; for since he
has not, I believe none else will take upon
him to determin its <HI>specifick</HI> Nature, or, in∣deed,
whether it actually be or not: The
innumerable Appearances seem to imply some
such Thing.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="126"/>
§. VIII. To conclude this dark Subject of
<HI>animal Spirits,</HI> if they must be suppos'd, we
may affirm they cannot be of the Nature of
any Fluid we have a Notion of, from what
we see or know. Indeed, the large Size, the
wonderful Texture, and the great Care and
Security Nature has employ'd about the <HI>Brain,</HI>
makes it probable it has been design'd for the
<HI>noblest</HI> Uses, <HI>viz.</HI> to be the Temple or <HI>Sen∣sorium</HI>
of the <HI>sentient and intelligent Prin∣ciple.</HI>
And its Resemblances, in many
Circumstances, to the other <HI>Glands,</HI> which
certainly separate Liquors, makes it not im∣possible
that it may have Uses <HI>analogous</HI> to
those. But how to assign them, explain, or
accord them with what has been suggested
above, I know not. May not the <HI>sentient
Principle</HI> have its Seat in some Place in the
Brain, where the Nerves terminate, like the
<HI>Musician</HI> shut up in his Organ-Room? May
not the infinite Windings, Convolutions, and
Complications of the Beginning of the Nerves
which constitute the Brain, serve to determin
their particular <HI>Tone, Tension,</HI> and conse∣quently
the Intestin Vibrations of their Parts?
May they not have interwoven Blood Vessels
and Glands to separate a milky Liquor, to
soften, moisten, and continue their <HI>Elasticity,</HI>
and innate Mechanick Powers through the
whole <HI>nervous Systems?</HI> And also to keep them
in a proper Condition to play off the <HI>Vibra∣tions,
<PB N="89" REF="127"/>
Tremors,</HI> and <HI>Undulations</HI> made on them
by Bodies, or their <HI>Effluvia?</HI> May not these
<HI>Vibrations</HI> be propagated through their Lengths
by a subtile, spirituous, and infinitely elastick
Fluid, which is the <HI>Medium</HI> of the Intelligent
Principle? As Sound is convey'd thro' Air to
the <HI>Tympanum,</HI> and by it to this <HI>Medium</HI> or
<HI>Aether,</HI> and from the <HI>Medium</HI> to the <HI>Intelli∣gent
Principle,</HI> and as <HI>Sight</HI> is perform'd
through or by Light. And is not the <HI>Ana∣logy</HI>
of Nature and Things thus, in some
measure, preserv'd? I own it is much easier
to confute than establish, and I should not be
very <HI>Sanguin</HI> about the Non-existence of ani∣mal
Spirits, but that I have observ'd the
dwelling so much upon them, has led Physicians
too much to neglect the mending the Juices,
the opening Obstructions, and the strengthen∣ing
the Solids, wherein only the proper and solid
Cure of nervous Distempers consists; and
apply to <HI>Volatiles, Foetids,</HI> and <HI>Stimulants:</HI>
which, at best, are but a Reprieve, and is not
unlike blowing up the Fire, but at the same
Time forcing it to spend faster, and go out
sooner; for <HI>Volatiles, Aromaticks,</HI> and <HI>Cor∣dials,</HI>
are much of one and the same Nature,
and all but Whips, Spurs, and pointed In∣struments
to drive on the <HI>resty and unwilling
Jade.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Generation, Animation, Nu∣trition,

and Fluids of Animals, and some

<P>§. I. I Think it next to a <HI>Demonstration,</HI>
that there is a <HI>self-active</HI> and <HI>self-motive</HI>
Principle in all Animals what∣soever,
both in the <HI>perfect</HI> and <HI>imperfect.</HI>
Mere <HI>Mechanism</HI> (that is, Foreign impress'd
Motions, according to certain Laws, and in
Proportion to the Surfaces of Bodies only)
may possibly account for the Appearances of
<HI>Vegetation;</HI> but it can never account for <HI>Ani∣mation,</HI>
or the <HI>animal Life</HI> even of the lowest
<HI>Insect;</HI> and this, I think, is the universal Opi∣nion
of all the ablest and wisest Geometers,
who are most knowing in the Laws of Me∣chanism.
How far a <HI>perpetual Motion</HI> is
possible, in the present State of Things, and
under the present established Laws of Nature,
<PB N="91" REF="129"/>
I will not take upon me absolutely to deter∣min.
I should think the <HI>Friction</HI> of Bodies,
the perpetual Loss of <HI>communicated</HI> Motion
on our <HI>Globe,</HI> and the Impossibility of any
<HI>Curves</HI> being describ'd by one and the same
Impulse, should make it as impossible, as the
<HI>squareing</HI> the <HI>Circle,</HI> or expressing <HI>Surds</HI> by
Integers or finite Fractions, under the present
State of our <HI>Arithmetic.</HI> But that every Ani∣mal
is a <HI>perpetuum Mobile,</HI> from a <HI>Self-Motive</HI>
Principle <HI>within,</HI> and from its own <HI>innate</HI>
Powers, I think, is past all manner of Doubt;
and to explain <HI>Mechanically,</HI> from Matter and
Motion alone, and all the Powers of our
Numbers and Geometry join'd to them, the
Functions of any living Animal, is mere
<HI>Jargon</HI> and <HI>Ignorance,</HI> as I conceive.</P>
<P>§. II. MAY not <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Animation</HI> have
some Resemblance to Light, in its Activity,
and acting from a central Point of <HI>Self-Mo∣tion</HI>
and <HI>Self-Activity</HI> Radiat in a limited
<HI>Sphere,</HI> and where it finds proper <HI>Organs,</HI>
concurs and <HI>analogises</HI> in these Organs, with
the established Laws of Bodies? For it is as
utterly impossible to account for <HI>Animation</HI>
from mere <HI>Mechanism,</HI> as to account for
<HI>Thinking</HI> or <HI>Willing</HI> from that Principle.
Might not the <HI>Self-Motive</HI> and <HI>Self-Active,</HI>
the Intelligent and Free-willing Principle
(that is, the several Degrees and Exten∣sions
of this animating and actuating <HI>Spirit</HI>)
<PB N="92" REF="130"/>
have been at the same Time and Instant
created with the <HI>organical, infinitesimal</HI>
Body, in the first Originals of each different
Species of Animals, and have been forming
and extending the organiz'd Body under cer∣tain
Laws and Restrictions, till it was fit to
bear <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Day,</HI> and had its Organs
compleatly finished, to play off the <HI>Musick</HI>
and <HI>Harmony</HI> it was originally design'd for?
Is not every Animal a <HI>Machin</HI> of an <HI>infinite</HI>
Number of <HI>organical</HI> Parts, fitted with a pro∣per
<HI>Musician</HI> or <HI>Self-Motive</HI> and <HI>Self-Active</HI>
Principle, of an Order, Rank, and Extension
proper for the intended Ends and Purposes of
the Compound?</P>
<P>§. III. BY an <HI>Organ,</HI> I understand a Part
of a Machin, compleat in itself, necessary to∣wards
the Perfection and intended Use of the
Whole: Thus a Wheel, with its <HI>Axis</HI> and
<HI>Pivots,</HI> is an <HI>Organ</HI> in a Watch or Clock:
On this Definition, are not the <HI>Organs</HI> of
every Animal in Number actually <HI>infinite,</HI>
which nothing less than a <HI>Geometer</HI> of infinite
Capacity and Power, could adjust and fit to
each other, and to their intended Purposes
and Uses? If we consider the Number of
<HI>Veins, Arteries, Lymphaticks, Nerves, Fibres,
Tendons, Ligaments, Membrans, Cartilages,
Bones, Muscles,</HI> and <HI>Glands</HI> discovered in
every Animal, and this infinite Number still
encreased and made further conspicuous by
<PB N="93" REF="131"/>
<HI>Injections</HI> and <HI>Microscopes:</HI> Add to these, the
Sensibility of each the smallest Point and
Particle of Animal, where the Circulation
reaches, we shall be easily persuaded that they
surpass all finite Skill and <HI>Mechanism,</HI> to form
and frame; and that they are without Number,
and without End. That the whole Fabrick
is but an <HI>Assemblage</HI> of an infinit Number of
such <HI>Organs.</HI> Every minute Point, and Atom
of which, is fitted and contriv'd for a particular
End and Purpose, and for the Benefit of the
Whole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Galen</HI> de Usu <HI>partium.</HI></NOTE>. The <HI>Structure, Contrivance,</HI> the
<HI>Use, Beauty,</HI> and <HI>Perfection</HI> of the human
<HI>Hand</HI> alone, made <HI>Galen</HI> a firm Believer in a
first Cause infinitely Wise, Good and Powerful.</P>
<P>§. IV. BUT that the whole <HI>System</HI> of these
<HI>Conjectures</HI> may be brought into one View, I
shall draw them out into a few <HI>Propositions,</HI>
without offering at any thing, that may be sug∣gested
to make them more probable, and
leave the Reader to correct, or reject them at
his Pleasure, being in no manner necessary to
the main of my Design, and calculated only
to amuse and divert.</P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> 1. MATTER is capable of infinite
<HI>Division</HI> and <HI>Addition.</HI></P>
<P>2. THERE may be <HI>Systems</HI> of Bodies of all
Sizes, from indefinitely <HI>small,</HI> to indefinitely
<PB N="94" REF="132"/>
<HI>great.</HI> The Stars may be consider'd as a
<HI>System</HI> of Bodies indefinitely <HI>great,</HI> and <HI>Light</HI>
a System of Bodies indefinitely <HI>small,</HI> and
how many other such <HI>Systems</HI> there may be,
none can tell.</P>
<P>3. THERE may be <HI>Animalcula</HI> or Orga∣nised
living Bodies of all Sizes, from those of
a <HI>Pepper Corn</HI> and lower, up to a <HI>Whale</HI> and
higher, and these may be for many Ages
growing and encreasing to their appointed
<HI>Magnitudes,</HI> under certain Laws and Re∣strictions.</P>
<P>4. <HI>LIFE</HI> and <HI>Animation</HI> seems impossi∣ble,
and a Contradiction to mere <HI>Mechanism,</HI>
that is, to Matter, acted by determin'd Laws
of Motion, and in Proportion to the Surfaces
of Bodies only.</P>
<P>5. <HI>LIFE</HI> and <HI>Animation</HI> admit of all the
Degrees of Quantity.</P>
<P>6. <HI>MECHANISM</HI> takes Place and
operates by it self only, on dead <HI>Matter;</HI>
but is actuated and govern'd in its Operations,
by animated living Bodies or <HI>spiritual</HI> Sub∣stances.</P>
<P>7. THE <HI>Self-motive, Self-active,</HI> and
<HI>living</HI> Principle concurs with, and <HI>homolo∣gises</HI>
to <HI>Mechanism</HI> in the animal Functions
<PB N="95" REF="133"/>
and Operations. The second is subordinate
to the first in all its Effects, which take Place
according to its own Laws.</P>
<P>8. ORGANISED Bodies fit for <HI>Animation,</HI>
and living Functions, consisting of Organs in
Number <HI>infinite,</HI> can only be the Work of
infinite Wisdom and Power.</P>
<P>9. The <HI>Self-motive, Self-active</HI> Principle
cannot act <HI>harmoniously,</HI> or according to its
intended Uses and Purposes, on an unfit, un∣finished,
unorganised Body, any more than a
skilful <HI>Musician</HI> can produce fine Musick or
<HI>Harmony</HI> on an unfinished, imperfect Instru∣ment.</P>
<P>10. MIGHT not the <HI>organised</HI> Bodies of
all the Species of Animals have been included
in the first original Pairs, decreasing conti∣nually
in a <HI>geometrical</HI> Progression, or as
<HI>second, third,</HI> and subsequent <HI>Fluxions</HI> are con∣tain'd
in their first Fluxions, and all in their
Fluent?</P>
<P>11. MIGHT it not be, that the <HI>organis'd</HI>
Bodies of all Animals might be included in
the <HI>Male</HI> of each original Pair? and that the
<HI>Female</HI> might only supply a more convenient
Habitation for them during a determin'd
Time, while, by their quicker Encrease they
were fitted to bear <HI>Air, Sun,</HI> and <HI>Day?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="134"/>
12. THE original <HI>Stamina;</HI> the whole
<HI>System</HI> of the Solids, the Firmness, Force,
and Strength of the Muscles, of the Viscera,
and great Organs, are they not owing to the
<HI>Male?</HI> And does the <HI>Female</HI> contribute any
more but a convenient Habitation, proper
Nourishment, and an <HI>Incubation</HI> to the semi∣nal
Animalcul for a Time, to enable the
<HI>organised</HI> living Creatures to bear the <HI>Air,
Sun,</HI> and <HI>Day</HI> the sooner?</P>
<P>13. IF the <HI>Brain, Heart, Lungs, Liver,</HI> or
<HI>Kidneys</HI> of the <HI>Male</HI> be spoil'd and corrupted,
the same Juices in him that spoil'd these
<HI>Viscera,</HI> may they not spoil and corrupt the
same <HI>Organs</HI> in the <HI>Animalcul</HI> while lodged in
him, and in some kind fed and encreas'd by
his Juices?</P>
<P>14. SINCE then the <HI>Female</HI>'s Juices are
what, for a certain Time, also feed the
<HI>Animalcul,</HI> as they are Good or Bad, Proper
or Improper, may they not alter, spoil, or
mend the Juices of the <HI>Foetus?</HI></P>
<P>15. THE <HI>Solids</HI> therefore seem neither emi∣nently
(or in such a Degree as the Juices) capable
of being repair'd, renew'd, nor mended when
broken, wounded, or taken away, no more than
a <HI>Tinker</HI> can mend a Hole in a Brass Pot or
Pan, <HI>viz.</HI> not by new forming or joining
<PB N="97" REF="135"/>
and uniting the <HI>Metal,</HI> but by a <HI>Soder</HI> or
<HI>Patch;</HI> and so Nature seems only to have
provided proper Juices to fill up the <HI>Dis∣continuity,</HI>
and supply the Breaches: As in
Animals, we see by the <HI>Cicatrices</HI> of Wounds
and Sores of all Kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> their continuing for
almost ever after, a Botch. For this Cement
never makes them the same continued <HI>Organ,</HI>
scarce any thing but a botch'd or clouted
one.</P>
<P>16. THE Solids seem scarce subject to any
eminent Alterations in their innate Tension,
Force, and Elasticity naturally, till they are
almost quite spoil'd and putrified, but merely
as they are made thicker or grosser, harder or
softer, by this adhering Glew or Soder, or
from these Juices within, and their aggluti∣nating
Patch-work.</P>
<P>17. <HI>NUTRITION</HI> seems only to be the
supplying the several solid Parts with a suitable
<HI>Glew</HI> or <HI>Soder,</HI> to augment and encrease the
Bulk, and but little to alter the innate Force
and <HI>Elasticity</HI> of the original and primitive
Solids.</P>
<P>18. THE <HI>Solids</HI> seem to be capable of
being contracted, as it were, into an indivisible
Point, <HI>viz.</HI> in seminal Animalcules: By <HI>Plica∣tures,
Foldings, Twistings,</HI> and <HI>Swaiths</HI> or
<HI>Membranes,</HI> and yet to preserve a proportional
<PB N="98" REF="136"/>
Degree of Elasticity and Spring: As we see in
the <HI>Nymphae</HI> of Silk-worms, and the other
Infects of the <HI>papilious</HI> Kind. Or they may
be shut up, one Part within another, as a
Fishing-rod: And the different Shapes of
these seminal Animalculs, from their Figure
when full grown, seem to imply this. And
these <HI>Swaiths</HI> and <HI>Membranes</HI> burst and break
naturally, by Accretion and Encrease of Bulk,
as we see in seminal Plants, and in the For∣mation
of Animals.</P>
<P>19. THE <HI>Solids</HI> therefore seem to be the
great, the proper, the only Instrument of
<HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Animation,</HI> and the true <HI>musical
Organ</HI> of the living <HI>Musician.</HI> And the <HI>Fluids</HI>
to be only intended to preserve them in due
<HI>Plight, Glibness, Warmth,</HI> and <HI>tonical Virtue,</HI>
and to soder and repair their Wounds, Wastes
and Decays. But it is on these Fluids that
<HI>Medicines</HI> and <HI>Medical Operations</HI> have place
chiefly.</P>
<P>20. THIS general Sketch, tho' imperfect,
and, perhaps, not real, yet is the most con∣sistent
I could frame on a Consideration and
View of the whole of <HI>Animal Nature,</HI> in all
its Kinds and Species; by it the <HI>Analogy</HI> be∣tween
<HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Animals</HI> is preserv'd, and
many Appearances in <HI>Generation, Nutrition,</HI>
and <HI>Animation</HI> may be solv'd, which otherwise
appear unaccountable: The <HI>philosophical Gar∣deners,</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="137"/>
the <HI>philosophical Breeders</HI> of Cattle
and other Animals, and those best acquainted
with <HI>Natural History,</HI> will be the fittest Judges
of its Truth and Justness. I thought it might
amuse the ingenious Valetudinarian; and there∣fore
let it pass as it is, without the Arguments
and Instances that make it probable, tho' I
could produce innumerable.</P>

<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Signs and Symptoms of a too
relaxed, loose and tender State of
Nerves.</HEAD>
<P>§. I. THOSE who have weak, loose,
and feeble or relax'd Nerves,
have generally a small, weak,
languid, and sometimes an intermittent Pulse.
Exercise, strong Liquors, high Food, or
that which is hard to digest, or too great a
Quantity of these last, taken down, quicken
and accelerate the Pulse, and discover a
Labour and Struggle in the Circulation. The
Strokes of such a Pulse are seldom clean and
<PB N="100" REF="138"/>
free, and sometimes quite stopt and in∣terrupted
for some small time; especially
in great Lowness, Fainting or Fits; and,
at best, are like a Force not apply'd at once,
but by straining, and struggling, and slow
Degrees.</P>
<P>§. II.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Essay on Health and long Life, Chap. vii. §. 4.</NOTE> THOSE that have by Nature
soft, thin, and short Hair, which, with
great Difficulty, receives or retains a Buckle,
and those who readily run into Baldness or
shedding of the Hair towards the Spring,
are certainly of a loose, flabby, and relaxed
State of Nerves: For the Hair seems to be
only some of the fleshy Fibres lengthened
outwards and hardened, at least they seem
to be of the same Kind and Nature, with
the other Fibres, consist of a great many lesser
Filaments, contain'd in a common Membran,
and are solid, transparent, and elastick: And
as the Hairs are in Strength, Bulk, and
Elasticity, so generally the Fibres of the
Body are; and those whose Hair sheds,
turns thin, lank, or refuses Buckle, if it
does not happen to them after recovering
from an acute Distemper, ought to take care
they fall not into nervous Disorders, which
anointing their Hair with sweet Oils, or
<PB N="101" REF="139"/>
washing their Heads with Honey-Water
will scarce prevent.</P>
<P>§. III. OTHER things being equal, those
of the fairest, clearest, and brightest colour'd
Hair, are of the loosest and weakest State
of Fibres and Nerves, not only because the
fairest and lightest is the most rare, transpa∣rent,
and fungous, but because Bodies of
the lightest Parts, consist of Parts of a weaker
Union, which adhere with less Force, and
consequently are less elastick, firm, and
springy than those of the darker and more
opake Colours. We generally observe, that
People of very fine and white Hair, espe∣cially
if so after they are come to Maturity, are
of weak, tender, and delicate Constitutions:
And those who deal in making artificial
Covers for the Heads of Men or Women,
find that such Hair will never, with any
Credit to them, serve these Purposes, and
seldom honestly employ it for that End.</P>
<P>§. IV. THOSE of large, full, and (as
they are call'd) mastiff Muscles, and of big
and strong Bones, are generally of a firmer
State of Fibres, than those of little Muscles
and small Bones, because the Muscles and
Bones being similar to the Fibres, and made
of them, these being bigger and stronger,
so must those be; and, on the contrary,</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="140"/>
§. V. SOFT and yielding, loose and
flabby Flesh and Muscles, are sure Symp∣toms
of weak and relaxed Nerves or Fibres,
as hard, firm, prominent and brawny Mus∣cles
and Flesh are constant Signs of firm
Fibres.</P>
<P>§. VI. A WHITE, fair, blanch'd, wax
or ashen-colour'd Complexion, constantly
indicates a weaker State of Fibres, than a
ruddy, brown, or dark Hue.</P>
<P>§. VII. A FAT, corpulent, and phlegma∣tick
Constitution is always attended with
loose, flabby, and relax'd Fibres, by their
being dissolv'd and over-soak'd in Moisture
and Oil, especially if it belong to young
Persons, or happen long before the <HI>Meridian</HI>
of Life; for in the Decline, when the Fibres
have acquir'd their utmost Degree of Ten∣sion,
Hardness, and Firmness, it then serves
to preserve them in that State, from the
Dryness that old Age always introduces.
But those of a dry, firm, clean, and brawny
Make have generally the strongest and most
tense Fibres.</P>
<P>§. VIII. THOSE who are subject to Eva∣cuations
of any Kind, in any Degree greater
than what is natural and common to sound
Constitutions; or those, who by any Acci∣dent,
<PB N="103" REF="141"/>
a Fever, or any acute Distemper what∣soever,
have suffer'd long under any preter∣natural
Evacuation, are already, or soon
will, become subject to a loose, relax'd, or
weak State of Fibres and Nerves: Those
who frequently run into Purging and Costive∣ness
alternately, or into Floods of pale
Water, or into profuse Sweatings, upon little
or no Exercise, into a constant Spitting or
Salivation at the Mouth, or too plentiful
Discharges from the Nose and Eyes: Those
who have lost much Blood, or frequently
fall into <HI>Haemorrhages:</HI> Those who have
labour'd long under an obstinate <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI>
or Looseness: Or those of the Sex who have
purified long in greater Quantities, or oftener
than is usual or natural: All these originally
are, or commonly become of weak and relax'd
Nerves, and suffer under them.</P>
<P>§. IX. THOSE who are naturally of a
cold Constitution, are apt to fall into Chil∣ling
and Coldness on their Extremities, or
feel frequently like the trickling of cold
Water over some Parts of the Body, are
ready to catch Cold, upon the slightest Oc∣casions,
are apt to run into Rigours and
Shiverings upon a sharp North-East Wind;
are too sensibly and violently affected, and
feel too much Pain and Uneasiness from cold
or frosty Weather; who want too much
Covering, Cloaths, or Heat; or, on the
<PB N="104" REF="142"/>
contrary, are too much sunk and dis-spirited,
spent and wasted with excessive hot Wea∣ther,
are all of loose and weak Fibres. For
all these are Signs of a too slow Circulation and
Perspiration which manifest a weak Spring
in the Fibres of the Coats of the Vessels, and
of the other Solids, and shew too great a
Degree of Sensibility or Easiness of being
acted upon by external Objects, which
argues a Weakness or Slenderness in them,
either natural or acquir'd.</P>
<P>§. X. THOSE who are subject to acute
or chronical Distempers of the cold and viscid
Kind, tho' they have not commonly their
Denomination from nervous Distempers, such
as an <HI>Atrophy, Dropsy, Diabetes, Diarrhoea,</HI>
white and <HI>leucophlegmatick</HI> Swellings upon
the Joints or other Parts of the Body; glan∣dulous
and <HI>schirrous</HI> Tumours, the <HI>Scrophula,</HI>
viscid Quinseys or Swellings in the Glands
of the Eyes, such (besides all those who are
subject to Diseases denominated Nervous in
their Kind) are all of weak Nerves and
Fibres.</P>
<P>§. XI. THOSE who Stutter, Stammer,
have a great Difficulty of Utterance, speak
very Low, lose their Voice without catch∣ing
Cold, grow Dumb, Deaf, or Blind, with∣out
an Accident or an Acute Distemper; are
quick, prompt, and passionate; are all of
<PB N="105" REF="143"/>
weak Nerves; have a great Degree of Sensi∣bility;
are quick Thinkers, feel Pleasure or
Pain the most readily, and are of most lively
Imagination.</P>
<P>§. XII. THESE are, at least, the most mate∣rial
of the Signs and Symptoms of a relax'd
State of Solids or Fibres; so that whoever
labours under them for any Time, or in any
eminent Degree, may certainly conclude,
whatever other Disorders he may labour
under, that these are certainly attended with
a State of loose and relax'd Fibres, and
consequently, that in prescribing Medicines
for such, whatever their Disease otherwise
may be, or may be call'd, great Care is
always to be had, both in dosing the proper
Medicines for such particular Disorders, and
joining with them such Medicines as may
keep up the due Tension of the Solids, as
much as possible, while they are under the
Cure, and also ordering such Remedies as
may corroborate and strengthen them, when
the Cure is effected. For in all such Cases,
where the Solids are greatly relax'd, the
Constitution of the Patient differs as much
from the same Case in strong and robust Per∣sons,
as the Constitution of a Child, from
that of a grown Person.</P>
<P>§. XIII. BUT the fundamental Proposition,
on which the Manner of treating such Distem∣pers
<PB N="106" REF="144"/>
is, and ought in Reason to be grounded,
and which Experience always justifies, is,
that a Laxity, Weakness and Want of due
Tone and Elasticity in the Solids, produce
viscid, sharp, and ill-condition'd Juices. And,
on the contrary, that ill-condition'd, sharp,
and viscid Juices, necessarily produce weak
and unelastick Solids, so that they mutually
exasperate each other, and differ only as
Cause and Effect, tho' the Fault of the Fluids
always precedes that of the Solids. Put the
Case, that the Blood and Juices are viscid,
sharp, and ill-condition'd, the Fibres subsist∣ing
nearly in their proper Tension and due
Degree of <HI>Tone</HI> and Elasticity, that they
ought to be in perfectly sound and robust
Persons, the necessary Effect of such a State
of Juices, would be a Retardment of their
Circulation by a greater Pressure upon the
Sides of the Vessels, and the forming of Ob∣structions
in the small and capillary Tubes,
which by rendering these impervious, forces
a greater Quantity upon the pervious ones,
than they are accustomed or able to drive
about, and so by Degrees break and loosen
the Texture, and relax the Tone of all these
Solids. For when once the Ballance be∣tween
the Force and Strength of an Instru∣ment,
and the Body to be moved by it,
comes to be destroy'd, and the Advantage
thrown upon the Side of the Body to be
moved, the Instrument must be soon shatter'd
<PB N="107" REF="145"/>
and broken. On the other hand, supposing
the Juices sound and good, and of a due
Consistence and Balsam, but that the Solids
are of a laxer, weaker and less elastick Make
than they should be, it must necessarily fol∣low,
that the Circulations, Perspiration, the
Digestions and Secretions must be weaker
and more languishingly perform'd than they
ought to be, by which neither will the Food
be sufficiently broken and digested in the
alimentary Tubes, nor the Size of the Par∣ticles
of the Blood sufficiently small nor
divided by the Force of the Circulation, nor
its Recrements thrown off with due Force
and in sufficient Quantity, that the Juices
may be duly purified, insomuch, that they
must necessarily become viscid and sharp;
and their Parts necessarily increase in Bulk
and Hardness, especially under a <HI>mal-Regi∣men.</HI>
From all which it is evident that a
weak State of Nerves or Fibres must neces∣sarily
imply a bad State of Juices, and so on
the other Hand, and that they mutually at∣tend
or produce one another, unless a proper
Regimen of Dyet come in to their Relief.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the general Method of Cure of
Nervous Distempers.</HEAD>
<P>§. I. <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE are some Persons,
who, being far advanced in
Age, have not sufficient Time
remaining for a perfect Cure;
and others, in whom the Dis∣ease
is so deeply rooted, by a bad Constitu∣tion,
derived to them from their Parents,
that they are not capable of a total Cure;
and both these must be contented to submit
to the <HI>Orders of Providence,</HI> and make the
<PB N="112" REF="148"/>
best of their Misfortunes, resting satisfied
with a <HI>Partial</HI> or <HI>Palliative</HI> Cure, and re∣lieving
the Symptoms as they arise. But
those who are in better Circumstances, will
have better Success, by following with Pa∣tience
and Perseverance, the Directions here
to be laid down.</P>
<P>§. II. FROM what has been said in the
former Part of this Treatise, concerning the
Sources and Causes of Chronical Distempers,
and the general Causes of the Disorders of the
<HI>Nerves</HI> or <HI>Solids,</HI> there will arise three <HI>Indi∣cations</HI>
in the Cure of <HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers,
from the three principal <HI>Causes</HI> concurring
towards their Production.</P>
<P>1<HI>st,</HI> THE first <HI>Intention,</HI> and that which
has the greatest Influence on all the rest, and
will often, in smaller Degrees of this Distem∣per,
or when the Solids are not much weaken'd
or spoil'd, render the other two unnecessary:
(at least, in a great measure) The first <HI>Inten∣tion,</HI>
I say, will be to thin, dilute, and sweeten
the whole Mass of the Fluids, to destroy their
Viscidity and Glewiness, to open the Obstruc∣tions
thereby generated, make the Circulation
full and free, the Perspiration current, and the
Secretions flow in their due Proportion and
Tenor. This, if fully obtained, lays the
Foundation of all the rest of the Cure, and
will even, during that Time, take off the
<PB N="113" REF="149"/>
Violence of the <HI>Symptoms,</HI> and make their
Intervals greater.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> THE <HI>second Intention</HI> will be to
divide, break and dissolve the saline, acrid
and hard <HI>Concretions,</HI> generated in the small
Vessels, and to destroy all <HI>Sharpness</HI> and
<HI>Acrimony</HI> lodged in the Habit, and to make
the Juices soft, sweet, and balsamick. This
will be more readily effected, if the first <HI>In∣tention</HI>
has been sufficiently and successfully
pursued; and, indeed, will, in a great mea∣sure,
be fulfilled by it; for as it is the Sizy∣ness
and Sharpness of the Juices, that retards
the Circulation, obstructs the small Vessels,
and thereby leaves the stagnated Juices to
corrupt and putrify, by giving Time and
Occasion for the smaller <HI>saline</HI> Particles to
approach nearer one another, exert their in∣nate
Quality of <HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Crystallization,</HI>
and unite in greater Clusters and larger <HI>Con∣cretions,</HI>
(which, tho' never sensible, yet,
from the Necessity of Nature and its Laws,
is never the less real) so when the Blood is
made sufficiently thin and fluid, these saline
Concretions, will be either dissolv'd or bro∣ken,
by the Thinness of the Juices, and the
Force of the Circulation, and so fitted to be
thrown out of the Habit, by the proper
Discharges, or will be kept at a due Distance
from one another, or more easily reach'd,
<PB N="114" REF="150"/>
and then remedied by such Medicines as will
produce this Effect.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> THE <HI>third</HI> and last <HI>Intention</HI> in
order, is to restore the <HI>Tone</HI> and <HI>elastick</HI>
Force, to crisp, wind up, and contract the
<HI>Fibres</HI> of the whole <HI>System,</HI> which is the last,
and indeed the most imperfect Part of the
Cure, and the least, I am afraid, in the
Power of <HI>Art.</HI> It is much like the Case of
<HI>Hair</HI> that has lost its Buckle, by Length of
Time and much Use; tho' by <HI>Art</HI> it may
be harden'd, stiffen'd, and reduced in some
Degree to a greater Firmness and proper
Figure, yet will not retain it long, nor bear
the Injuries of the Weather so readily, with∣out
returning to its former Laxity: If this
could be always and totally effected, the
Cure would be a true <HI>Rejuvenescence,</HI> and no
Body needed grow Old or Die. But the
Laws of Mortality will suffer this Intention
to rise only to a certain Height, and no
further; for this, if solidly and fully effected,
would be the true <HI>Cyclus Metasyncriticus</HI> of the
Antients, so little understood. However, there
are not wanting Means to effect this Purpose in
some Degree, if duly and judiciously chosen,
especially if the Person is under the <HI>Meridian</HI>
of Life, while Nature has Warmth and Vi∣gour
to assist <HI>Art.</HI> After that <HI>Date</HI> the Dif∣ficulty
is greater, there remaining little more
than the Assistances of <HI>Art,</HI> upon the Signs
<PB N="115" REF="151"/>
of Laxity, to crisp, wind up, corrugat, and
contract the Fibres of the feeble and relax'd
Solids from Time to Time as they drop.
There is certainly an innate <HI>Firmness</HI> and <HI>Force</HI>
in the Solids, which, tho' Age hardens and
stiffens, yet the <HI>Tone</HI> and <HI>Elasticity</HI> is not
augmented thereby in Proportion: But this
<HI>Tone</HI> is scarce ever so much broken and lost,
but that it is sufficient to circulate well-thin'd
and sweeten'd Juices, and to perform all the
animal and intellectual <HI>Functions:</HI> and if Care
be taken to keep up the Juices in this middling
State of Fluidity and Sweetness, the Party will
be free from all great Pain or violent Disorder,
and will be subject only to some transient
Lowness or Weakness, which may be pre∣sently
remedied, or to the unavoidable Infir∣mities
of <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Mortality.</HI></P>
<P>§. III. THESE are the general <HI>Intentions,</HI> to
be pursued towards a <HI>total</HI> and perfect Cure
of <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders of whatever Sort or
Kind; nor are they ever to be confounded
or blended, at least, not in the first Attempts
towards such a Cure: For as in diluting
the Juices, unless the Solids are left to
their innate Force only, the Medicines em∣ployed
for that Purpose, being <HI>active</HI> or <HI>pon∣derous,</HI>
and those which are employed to
restore the <HI>Tone</HI> of the Solids being astringent,
must in some measure again thicken the
Juices, and so if mixed and blended toge∣ther,
<PB N="116" REF="152"/>
must unavoidably interfere with, coun∣ter-act,
and destroy the Effects of each other.
And therefore these three <HI>Intentions</HI> I have
mention'd must religiously follow one another,
in the order I have propos'd them, in deep <HI>Ca∣chexy</HI>'s
especially, to effect this Purpose of a
<HI>total</HI> Cure: Not that I mean, that they should
never be interrupted nor combined with each
other, for some small Time at least, and as
it were, sor the Patient to take Breath and
recover Spirits a little, in order to the fur∣ther
prosecuting the several Intentions. Nor
that they may not be gone on with entirely,
in a mix'd and blended Manner, both in Me∣thod
and Medicines, in slight Cases, and the
low Degrees of <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders, with good
Success; but that in obstinate, deep, and
dangerous Cases of this Kind, from an univer∣sally
spoilt Constitution, every <HI>Intention</HI> is
to be pursued, by it self for a due Time,
without Confusion or interfering with one
another, more than the Prosecution of the
then <HI>Intention</HI> requires, till the Effect is
obtained.</P>
<P>§. IV. WHAT the Time necessary for
each <HI>Intention</HI> must be, it is impossible ab∣solutely
to determine; that must be pro∣portion'd
to the Violence of the <HI>Symptoms,</HI>
and the Obstinacy of the Distemper. But
to give some general Idea or Notion of the
Time: That which is necessary for the first
<PB N="117" REF="153"/>
<HI>Intention,</HI> may be conjectur'd from the State
of the Blood. If the Size on the Top is
much gone, if the Colour and its easily
yielding to any dividing Instrument, and
the Proportion of the <HI>Serum</HI> to the globular
Part, upon bleeding (a few Ounces only for
the Trial) be such as they are found com∣monly
in sound Persons, and if the <HI>Serum</HI>
be clear, or not too tawny, then may it be
concluded, that the first <HI>Intention</HI> has been
pursued sufficiently. The <HI>second</HI> may also
be guess'd from the healing up and cicatri∣zing
of any Ulcers, Sores, or the Cure of any
<HI>cutaneous</HI> Foulnesses, and the Removal of
any acute Pains and <HI>Paroxysms,</HI> principally
caus'd by the Sharpness, and <HI>Acrimony,</HI> and
<HI>Saline</HI> Quality of the Juices. The <HI>last</HI> is ob∣vious,
after these two are ascertain'd by the
<HI>Strength, Vigour, Vivacity,</HI> and <HI>Freedom of
Spirits,</HI> the natural and easy Performance of
all the <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> necessarily follow∣ing
upon the <HI>last</HI> Intention's being prosecuted
for a due Time, and in a proper Manner. But
that every one may more certainly judge of
the State and Condition of the Blood and
Juices, and the Necessity of prosecuting the
<HI>Intentions</HI> I have propos'd, I shall here give
some general Account of the different Changes
that happen in them under Diseases of all
Kinds; but particularly those I am here
principally concern'd about.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="154"/>
§. V. THE <HI>Blood</HI> as it flows in the greater
or larger Vessels by the ordinary Course of
the <HI>Circulation,</HI> seems to be a pretty uniform
Mass, much like Cow-Milk; but when
drawn out of these Vessels, and left without
Heat or Motion to settle in the Air, it
separates into two Parts, one of a more gluti∣nous
and Solid Texture, call'd the <HI>Globular,</HI>
and the other of a more thin and fluid Na∣ture,
called the <HI>Serous</HI> Part; and both these
are found in different Proportions, and of
different Natures, Consistence, and Colours,
according to the Diseases of the Persons in
whom they are found. I shall only here
mention <HI>three</HI> of these different States, where∣in
the distinguishing Marks are most evident,
tho' there are many intermediate Degrees
between these, which it were endless to enu∣merate;
but these will include them all, and
are the most general, remarkable, and use∣ful:
1<HI>st.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> is, when the <HI>globular</HI> Part
is of a Moderate Cohesion and Firmness of
Parts, in a pretty equal Proportion to its
<HI>Serum,</HI> and of a red and scarlet Colour,
when expos'd a due Time to the Air; and
the <HI>Serum</HI> is about the Consistence of com∣mon
Water, pretty clear, and almost insipid,
or, at least, not biting saltish. This I take
to be pretty near the State of the soundest
and best Blood. 2<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>second</HI> State I
would mention, is, when the <HI>globular</HI> and
<PB N="119" REF="155"/>
grumous Part is in a far greater Proportion
than the <HI>Serum,</HI> more thick and viscid, having
a Glue or Size on its Top (of a blueish
at first, and afterwards of a whitish or tal∣low
Colour, increasing sometimes to half or
more the Thickness of the Whole) the <HI>Serum</HI>
being in a smaller Quantity, and of a yel∣lowish
or tawny Cast, sharp, acrid, and saltish
to the Taste. This seems to be of a middling
Nature, (I speak not here of that acci∣dental
Size, generated by the Nitre of the
Air in catching Cold, which evanishes in
a few Days by proper Management) between
the best and the worst, and is common to
<HI>Pleurisies, Rheumatisms,</HI> &amp;c. 3<HI>dly,</HI> The
last State of the Blood, I shall speak of, is
where the <HI>fibrous</HI> or <HI>globular</HI> Part is scarce
any at all, and the <HI>Serum</HI> above ten or a
dozen times the Quantity of it, where the
globular Part swims like an <HI>Island</HI> amidst the
Ocean, the <HI>Serum</HI> being sharp, saltish and
urinous, to the highest Degree in its Taste.
This I take to be the worst State, when the
Sharpness and <HI>Acrimony</HI> have arriv'd at their
utmost Height, like that of those in a con∣firm'd
<HI>Consumption</HI> or <HI>Dropsy,</HI> and some
other mortal Distempers. But in all these
three <HI>States</HI> of the Blood, the <HI>Sharpness,
Heat,</HI> and <HI>Acrimony</HI> may arise almost to an
equal Degree, even to that of the worst
State, of which we have no Means of judg∣ing,
but by the Taste, which is but gross
<PB N="120" REF="156"/>
and inaccurate, and therefore we must be
contented with Probability. The <HI>first</HI> of these
is commonly call'd <HI>good Blood,</HI> the <HI>second rich
Blood,</HI> and the third <HI>poor Blood.</HI> The <HI>Blood
Globules</HI> (consisting probably of Parts of an
equal Degree of <HI>Attraction,</HI> and equal Den∣sity)
seem to be form'd of the more solid
Parts of the Food, by the Action of the
digestive Powers in the <HI>alimentary Tubes,</HI>
the Force of the Circulation, and the Grind∣ing
of the Blood Vessels, and to receive their
<HI>globular</HI> Figure from the equal Pressure, on
all Sides of the watery Fluid wherein they
swim, and the equal Degree of Attraction in
their Parts. When the Quality and Quan∣tity
of such Food is duely proportion'd, the
<HI>red Globules</HI> and <HI>Serum</HI> are pretty near of an
equal Quantity, the <HI>first</HI> being perfectly red
in the Air, and the <HI>second</HI> mostly limpid,
like that of the first State. But when the
solid Food is in too great a Proportion in the
whole Mass, either in Quantity or Quality,
a greater Proportion of <HI>Blood Globules</HI> will
necessarily be generated: And if the Solids
be strong, so as to comminute them suffi∣ciently,
and drive them about with a due
Force, they will produce an inflammatory
State of Blood, from whence <HI>acute Fevers,
Inflammations, Pleurisies,</HI> and the other hot
and inflammatory Obstructions and Diseases
will arise. But if the same Proportion of
Food, both in Quantity and Quality, is
<PB N="121" REF="157"/>
thrown in, where the Solids are lax and
feeble, and consequently, the <HI>Digestive Or∣gans</HI>
weak, and the <HI>Circulation</HI> languid, the
Blood thence arising will be viscid and sizy
in Proportion, and exhibit the Appearances
describ'd in the <HI>second</HI> State, from whence
Obstructions and Diseases of the cold, <HI>chro∣nical,</HI>
or <HI>nervous</HI> Kind will arise. On the
other hand, when the <HI>Drink</HI> is in too
great a Proportion to the solid Food, when
great Quantities of strong and spirituous
Liquors are thrown into the Habit, and the
small Quantity of Food that is taken is
also strong and full of <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> the
<HI>fibrous</HI> Part of the Blood will be produc'd in
a smaller Proportion to the <HI>serous,</HI> or will be
consum'd and burnt up by the greater Quan∣tity
of <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Oils</HI> in the <HI>Serum</HI> proceeding
from such Nourishment, and so the <HI>last</HI> State
of the Blood I have taken notice of will be
produc'd: whereby the Solids being stimu∣lated
and corroded, and the Circulation car∣ried
about with too great Hurry and Vio∣lence,
or some great noble <HI>Bowel</HI> attack'd,
destroy'd and spoil'd, various Diseases of the
inflammatory-chronical kind will ensue, as
<HI>Hectick Fevers, Consumptions,</HI> &amp;c. the Blood-Vessels
being burst or corroded will occasion
<HI>Haemorrhages,</HI> or the Solids being weaken'd,
relax'd and broken, will suffer this thin and
acrid Serum <HI>to ouze</HI> thro' their Substances,
and thus beget a partial <HI>Dropsy,</HI> or a true
<PB N="122" REF="158"/>
<HI>Ascites.</HI> Something like the same State of
Blood may be occasion'd by a <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI>
or any great Loss of Blood, tho' tolerably
good, in what manner soever it happens,
either by a Wound or otherwise: the re∣maining
Part being robb'd of its <HI>red Globules,</HI>
or of too great a Quantity of the Compound
to be soon repair'd, it will be unable to re∣sist
the Force of the Solids, but will be re∣duc'd
to a poor, thin, watery State, so as, if
not presently or speedily restor'd to its for∣mer
<HI>Balsam</HI> and Texture, to end in a <HI>Dropsy,</HI>
in the Manner I have just now describ'd,
especially if a <HI>Mal-Regimen</HI> has proceeded or
succeeds it.</P>
<P>§. VI. But to apply this more particularly
to the Diseases I am now treating of: In all
<HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders produc'd by Excesses,
especially after the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life, the
Blood is generally viscid and sizy, like that
of the <HI>second</HI> State, which I have describ'd.
I have not for these many Years let Blood
of any one (if it were but an Ounce or
two to make Observation on, of which I
have had innumerable Instances) who being
subject to <HI>Nervous Distempers, Lowness, Va∣pours,</HI>
or <HI>Melancholy,</HI> have not had it <HI>Sizy,
Rheumatick</HI> and <HI>Viscid,</HI> with a sharp yellow
<HI>Serum</HI> in some Degree or other. I have
always observ'd the Blood of the younger
and those under the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life, in these
<PB N="123" REF="159"/>
who were violently subject to Nervous Dis∣orders,
to be hot, fiery, inflam'd, acrid and
sharp, tho' the Colour and Consistence might
be tolerably good, and then found it occa∣sion'd
by dealing too much in hot Liquors,
in Proportion to the original Weakness of
their Solids. But if the Viscidity of the
Juices was produc'd, as I have said, by an
Over-proportion of Food receiv'd into the
Habit, the Weakness of the Solids, and Slow∣ness
of the Circulation being consequent there∣upon,
Obstructions must necessarily be form'd
in the small Vessels and <HI>Glands</HI> especially of
the Liver, the Mesentery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then the
stagnant Juices putrify, corrupt, turn acrid
and corrosive (like what we see in some
other Cases of Obstructions that lie more
immediately under our Observation, parti∣cularly
that produc'd by a Blow on the
Breast, which terminates in a <HI>Cancer</HI>); and the
urinous or <HI>animal Salts</HI> being let loose, tear,
corrode, and destroy the Solids, from whence
the highest Degrees of <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders
spring: Indeed, in the last Stages of <HI>Nervous</HI>
Distempers, the Blood sometimes approaches
to that which I have describ'd as the last
and worst State; but then the Case is gone,
I think, beyond the Reach of human Means
or Art to remedy, since it generally attends
the entire Corruption of some of the great
<HI>Viscera;</HI> or the highest Degrees of such Ob∣structions,
whereby the whole Mass of Blood
<PB N="124" REF="160"/>
is infected with the Poison, and the Juices
dissolv'd and fus'd into a putrid Thinness,
like what is found in the last Stages of the
<HI>Black Jaundice,</HI> or some other mortal Dis∣tempers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Method and Medicines proper
for the First Intention.</HEAD>
<P>§. I. IN order to attenuate the Juices, to
break the Cohesion of their Parts,
to destroy their <HI>Viscidity</HI> and <HI>Glew∣iness,</HI>
and to make them sufficiently thin,
and fit to flow in the small Vessels with
Ease, those Medicines are chiefly to be cho∣sen,
which either by their own Nature are
the most <HI>active,</HI> by the <HI>Figure</HI> of their Par∣ticles,
are the most sharp and dividing, by
their <HI>Weight</HI> are endu'd with the greatest
Force and <HI>Momentum;</HI> or lastly, which by
Experience are found (without knowing a
Reason why) to be the most effectual for
producing these Ends.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="161"/>
§. II. I need not mention here the Neces∣sity
before any Course be enter'd upon for
this Purpose, of premising the common and
proper universal Evacuations, as <HI>Bleeding,
Purging, Vomiting,</HI> &amp;c. some one or more
of which will always be found necessary to
be first of all perform'd, not only to lessen
the Quantity of the corrupt Fluids in gene∣ral,
but to cleanse the Alimentary Tubes,
that the proper Medicines may be more
easily and readily convey'd into the Blood.
But as these Evacuations are never to be
undertaken without the Advice and Assist∣ance
of some skilful and honest <HI>Physician,</HI>
so it is by his Direction that the <HI>Repetition
Dose</HI> and Materials are to be adjusted: For
these Evacuations are so essential in this
Case in its first Stage, that by going about
them indiscreetly, or neglecting to do them
as the Symptoms require, the Patient may
be ruin'd, by trusting to his own Judgment,
or relying upon general Rules, which in all
severe, but particularly in <HI>Nervous</HI> Cases, are
both precarious and uncertain.</P>
<P>§. III. AMONG the chief and principal of
such Medicines, are <HI>Mercury</HI> and its Prepara∣tions,
<HI>Calomel, Mercury alcalisated, precipitat</HI> per
se, <HI>Quicksilver, Silver-Water, Aethiops Mine∣ral,
Cinnabar of Antimony, Antimony Diapho∣retick,
Bezoar Mineral, Crude Antimony, Be∣zoardicum
Joviale, Salt of Tin, Ens Veneris,</HI> and
<PB N="126" REF="162"/>
the like, whose chief Efficacy seems to lie in
their Weight, after they have dropt their
Salts in the Alimentary Tube. <HI>Next</HI> to
these are the Woods <HI>Guajacum, Sassafras, Sar∣saparilla,
Lignum Nephriticum,</HI> the several
Sorts of <HI>Saunders,</HI> Wood of <HI>Aloes,</HI> &amp;c. In
the <HI>third</HI> Order are the <HI>fix'd Salts,</HI> such as
<HI>Salt of Tartar, Salt of Wormwood, Broom,
Fern,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>last</HI> Class contains such
Vegetables, as are of an acrid and austere
Taste, such as are all the <HI>Antescorbutick</HI>
Plants, of which there is Choice and Variety
in all the Modern Writers and Collectors of
the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> so that it is needless
here to detail them. These may be com∣pounded
or combined in the best manner
possible, to make them easy and agreeable
to the Stomach, by the Skill of the <HI>Physician</HI>
in ordinary: and if given in a proper Dose,
and for a Time sufficient, will scarce fail of
their Effect.</P>
<P>§. IV. IN the Administration of <HI>Calomel,</HI>
for such a Purpose, it may be necessary to
observe, that however it may be manag'd
in Cases of another Nature, yet where it is
intended for the Cure of <HI>Nervous</HI> Diseases,
which suppose weak Solids, and consequently
tender Bowels, it will always be necessary
to give it in the smallest Dose, as an <HI>Alte∣rative</HI>
only, and not an Evacuant; for <HI>Ex∣ample,</HI>
In two, three, or four Grains, once,
<PB N="127" REF="163"/>
twice, or three times a day, because thus it
may be given with Safety for a much longer
Time, and will not be thrown off by the
greater Conduits of Evacuation, nor meerly
circulate thro' the greater Blood-Vessels,
but gently and gradually insinuate itself into
the smallest <HI>Capillary</HI> ones, where its Virtue
and Efficacy is most wanted, and where it
can do the most Service. For this Reason it is
chiefly, that in many deep <HI>Venereal</HI> Cases,
<HI>Salivation</HI> by the internal Exhibition of
Mercurials only, seldom succeeds: whereas
by <HI>Inunction</HI> it seldom fails; <HI>viz.</HI> that when
it happens to be perform'd on People of weak
Nerves, and tender Constitutions, and patent
Glands, it is generally thrown off by the
greater Out-lets, with great Danger to the
Patient; so that a few Grains commonly raise
a Scorbutick <HI>Ptyalism,</HI> which few can di∣stinguish
from a Mercurial Salivation, and so
they are scarce able to go on: or at best, it
circulates only thro' the Trunk of the greater
Arteries and Veins, to be thrown off by the
more patent and larger <HI>Glands,</HI> and seldom
or never gets Admittance into the Capillary
Vessels: whereas by <HI>Inunction,</HI> or in small
and often repeated Doses, it is receiv'd into
these last immediately or gradually, and
there does its Work. In <HI>Nervous</HI> Cases the
same Effect is obtain'd by the longer Time,
and lesser Doses, these Constitutions neither
admitting nor requiring so violent and quick
<PB N="128" REF="164"/>
a Deobstruent. But even this Method, in
its gentlest Degree will fit none but the
<HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders, of the stronger and
robuster Constitutions, which having been
originally sound, have contracted these Dis∣orders
by a <HI>Mal-Regimen.</HI></P>
<P>§. V. THE Medicines next to this the most
effectual for the first Intention, are <HI>Aethiops
Mineral,</HI> the <HI>Aethiops Antimoniatum, Cinna∣bar,</HI>
but especially <HI>Mercurius Alcalisatus,</HI> or
the other Preparations of Quicksilver, with
the various Preparations of <HI>Antimony,</HI> of which
there is great Variety (and might be more).
And this <HI>Aethiops Mineral</HI> is indeed an excel∣lent
Remedy, both from the Weight of the
<HI>Mercury,</HI> and the cleansing Nature of the
<HI>Sulphur</HI> entring its Composition, and would
do the whole in Time necessary for this
Intention, were it not that even few, but
those of the stronger Sort, can bear the
Slipperiness, and violent Cholicks and
Gripes, which it brings on their Bowels:
which not only sinks them more, but occa∣sions
the Medicine to be carry'd off before
it enters the Habit; and therefore when it
is us'd in such a Case, I should always ad∣vise
an Astringent or warm Medicine, such
as <HI>Diascordium, Mithridate, Venice Treacle,</HI>
and the like, to be join'd with it: perhaps
a less Quantity of <HI>Sulphur</HI> in the Preparation
would mend it, and make it go further than
<PB N="129" REF="165"/>
the Alimentary Tube. But those who are
strong, and whose Bowels are firm, bear
it easily; and in some I join <HI>Gum Guajac</HI> to
it, with <HI>Salt of Wormwood,</HI> to make it more
cleansing, attenuating and deobstruent, with
great Success. <HI>Bellost</HI>'s Quicksilver Pills are
of the same Nature and Virtue for this first
<HI>Intention,</HI> as well as for <HI>Asthmatick</HI> Cases, and,
I think, the Best way of taking <HI>Quicksilver</HI>
inwardly.</P>
<P>§. VI. THAT which I generally prefer in
viscid Juices, in Persons subject to Nervous
Disorders, in very low Cases, is <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of
<HI>Antimony,</HI> both because it creates fewer Tu∣mults
in the Stomach and Bowels, passes more
readily into the Blood, and seldom keeps the
Bowels slippery, unless it be in exceeding low
Cases. Those who are robust, or still in a great
measure strong, may bear the <HI>Aethiops;</HI> but
both the very Young and very Weak, if their
Juices be either too viscid or too sharp, will
find the greatest Relief from this Medicine,
duly fitted to their Constitution, and conti∣nued
for a long Time, if any of the whole
Tribe of the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> (in my Judg∣ment)
can possibly do it. Its Efficacy in
Childrens <HI>Epileptick</HI> and <HI>Convulsive</HI> Fits, and
indeed in all their <HI>Chronical</HI> Distempers, is
sufficiently known and acknowledg'd. And
I have found the same Effects in many Cases
both <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Chronical,</HI> even in adult
Persons, both to my Surprize and Admira∣tion.
<PB N="130" REF="166"/>
If it has fail'd, it is because it has not
been long enough continu'd. A <HI>Patient</HI> of
mine, now alive, has us'd it these twenty
years. It first (by my Advice) cured him of
his <HI>Nervous</HI> Complaints; and whenever he
ails, he has recourse to it on occasions to this
Day. It ought to be given fresh, or the least
stale possible, otherwise it may become tur∣bulent
in the Bowels; and it ought to be as
finely levigated as Art can make it, to enter
more readily into the small Vessels. And in∣deed,
when I consider that most other <HI>Mer∣curial</HI>
Medicines, tho' they are the most
powerful Attenuants of the Juices, yet (as all
ponderous and very active Medicines must
necessarily do) they, with the Salts united,
scrape thin and relax the Solids. I think this
the safest and most effectual of all the Atte∣nuants,
in very low Cases, especially if a little
of the <HI>Resin</HI> or <HI>Extract</HI> of the Jesuits Bark
be added to it, to keep up the Force of
the Solids, at the same time that it is dissol∣ving
the Viscidity of the Juices, and opening
the Obstructions in the small Vessels: for it
is impossible to get any <HI>Mercurial</HI> Medicine
that has not some Tendency to weaken them.</P>
<P>§. VII. THERE is nothing I could more
earnestly wish were brought into the com∣mon
Practice of <HI>Physick,</HI> than the more free
and general (but cautious) Use of the Prepa∣rations
of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Antimony</HI> in Chro∣nical
and Obstinate Cases: especially when
<PB N="131" REF="167"/>
join'd to a thin, cool, soft and mild Diet, to
answer this <HI>first</HI> Intention of a total Cure. Dr.
<HI>Charlton,</HI> who had the licensing of the <HI>Quacks</HI>
in King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Time, told on his Death-Bed
(as I am well inform'd) that all the use∣ful
or successful Cures perform'd by the
<HI>Mountebanks</HI> of his Time, were owing to the
Preparations of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Antimony</HI> only;
and it is a great Pity, that such glorious Re∣medies
should be in the Possession chiefly (I
mean the Preparations of <HI>Mercury</HI>) of such
unskilful, unprincipled Wretches. For a re∣gular
reputable Physician may endanger his
Reputation among the weak and prejudiced,
who deals freely in it, tho' it be a Remedy
only fit to bear the Name. <HI>Mercury</HI> is the
only Fluid in Nature (except Water) fit to
circulate thro' hollow Animal Tubes; (Two
of the others, Light and Aether, can scarce
be retain'd in them) its greater Weight than
any other Kinds of Matter (except <HI>Gold</HI>) makes
it the most capable to force its way: But then
<HI>Gold</HI> and all other Minerals having no innate
<HI>Fluidity,</HI> nor Natural Rotundity of Particles,
must be always carry'd on Water to be intro∣duc'd
into an Animal Habit, with which they
never kindly mix. <HI>Mercury,</HI> in all its Divi∣sions,
Mixtures and Unions with other Bodies,
is still reduceable to Liquid <HI>Quicksilver:</HI> which
makes it not improbable, that when it has
dropp'd its Mixtures in Animal Vessels, in the
<HI>Alimentary Duct</HI> especially, it returns to its
primitive <HI>Fluidity,</HI> and acts with the united
<PB N="132" REF="168"/>
Force of the whole then collected Mass of
Particles; and we know what Efficacy Shot
and small Bullets of Lead have in cleaning
foul Bottles or small Tubes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Boerhaave</HI>'s Chymistry.</NOTE> The Rotundity
of its Particles (in all its visible and sensible
Divisions, and even in its Ascent in the <HI>Retort,</HI>
and in all its other Preparations, apparent by
fine Glasses) with its <HI>Fluidity,</HI> makes them
probably smooth, and so without any Injury
to the <HI>Capillaries,</HI> except from their Weight
only. The infinite Smallness of its Particles,
evident by its ready Ascent in a Retort from
the least even a Sand-Heat only, and its
almost infinite Force of <HI>Attraction</HI> (from
these general Principles of its Weight and
Quantity of Matter, and from many Expe∣riments)
makes it always run into a fluid
Mass, when its <HI>spherical</HI> Particles are brought
near enough: whereby its Force is greatly
increas'd. From all which Considerations
(obvious even to common Sense, without
<HI>finessing</HI>) it is evident what a <HI>Noble Medi∣cine</HI>
it might be made in <HI>Chronical</HI> Cases of
all Kinds, viscid Juices and Obstructions of
the Organs, if duly prepar'd, dosed and fitted
to the Patient and the Distemper. The <HI>Mer∣curius
Alcalisatus</HI> (of <HI>Quicksilver</HI> and <HI>Crabs-Eyes
prepar'd,</HI> and rubb'd together till the
first disappear) is an admirable <HI>Medicin,</HI> and
in a small Dose gives no Trouble or Uneasi∣ness,
<PB N="133" REF="169"/>
and is specifick in <HI>Cutaneous Foulnesses,</HI>
and almost all other Chronical Cases, especi∣ally
<HI>Nervous,</HI> to this First Intention, as well
as is the <HI>Precipitate per se:</HI> I have often us'd
them both with great Success, even in <HI>Ner∣vous</HI>
Cases, since they have been so univer∣sally
known. Liquid <HI>Quicksilver</HI> will do great
Service in beginning <HI>Plicatures</HI> of the Inte∣stines,
Obstructions of their Glands and Valves,
and in Foulnesses and hard Concretions or
Obstructions, bred in the Mouths of the
<HI>Lacteals</HI> (which are often Cases where the
Symptoms common to other Diseases, will not
admit a certain Distinction) but eminently so
in <HI>Asthmatic</HI> Cases, above all other Medicines.
By its Weight only, forcing open the obstruc∣tive
Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> and its Steams
thereby entring the Habit, attenuate the vis∣cid
Juices of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and render them
pervious, and so promotes <HI>Expectoration;</HI> and,
I think, other more appropriated and specifick
Medicines not succeeding, this ought to be
try'd in all Cases of the <HI>Alimentary Tube,</HI> since
it is as innocent and safe as Asses Milk. And
even the <HI>Aq. Mercurialis</HI> or Silver Water, as
it succeeds beyond any thing in Childrens
Worm Cases: so I am satisfy'd, were it try'd in
other Cases, might do Wonders: especially in
<HI>Decoctions of the Woods, Antiscorbutick</HI> Waters,
or other appropriated Liquors; for as it nei∣ther
alters Taste, Smell, nor any other sensi∣ble
Quality of the Liquid, it may be safely
us'd as long, and in as great Quantities as one
<PB N="134" REF="170"/>
pleases, without any Trouble, Pain, or Danger.
I am therefore of the Opinion, that the most
effectual Remedies in Nature in Chronical
Cases and their first Stages, is the Prepara∣tions
of <HI>Mercury,</HI> of one Kind or other, toge∣ther
with <HI>Diet.</HI> Where it has not succeeded,
it is chiefly because proper <HI>Diet</HI> has not
been join'd; and, I believe, there are few
Cases and Constitutions, where some of these
mention'd Preparations may not agree in
proper Doses; and, if duly continu'd, are
not of wonderful Benefit, where the <HI>Viscera</HI>
are not quite spoil'd. But the Management
must be in the Hands of a sober, careful and
experienc'd <HI>Physician,</HI> who well understands
and considers what Nature will bear, and
what not; for it is not an indifferent or tri∣fling
Medicine, but a <HI>Divine Antidote,</HI> or a
certain <HI>Poison,</HI> according to the <HI>Case</HI> in which,
and the <HI>Person</HI> by whom, it is prescrib'd; and
I scarce willingly ever advise it at a Distance
in any Preparation, for it ought always to be
watch'd. Where the Vessels are very lax,
putrify'd, or thin: or the Obstruction very
hard or <HI>schirrous,</HI> the more active Prepara∣tions
must be cautiously avoided, and nothing
but the gentlest Preparations try'd, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<HI>Aethiops,</HI> the <HI>Cinnabars,</HI> the <HI>Mercurius Alca∣lisatus,</HI>
the <HI>Precipitat per se, Aq. Argentea,</HI>
and the like. For as to the Opinion of some,
<HI>viz.</HI> that these mention'd Preparations get no
further than the Alimentary <HI>Duct,</HI> I think it
without all Foundation, either from Philoso∣phy
<PB N="135" REF="171"/>
or Experience: when we see the <HI>Aethiops</HI>
and the <HI>Cinnabars,</HI> Liquid <HI>Quicksilver</HI> and
the <HI>Silver Water,</HI> cure Cutaneous Distem∣pers,
Inflammations of the Eyes, <HI>St. Anthony's
Fire,</HI> the <HI>Itch,</HI> the <HI>Piles,</HI> and the like; and
when they will soil the Silver and Gold about
the Patient. Nay, as I am satisfy'd all the
Kinds of them will at last raise a kind of a
<HI>Ptyalism.</HI> But even tho' then its principal
Action were only on the <HI>Glands</HI> of the Sto∣mach
and Intestines, yet the opening these,
and enabling them to perform their <HI>Functions,</HI>
may be sufficient, by <HI>Derivation</HI> to propagate
a proportional Benefit over the whole Habit.
<HI>Lastly,</HI> when we see Mercury boil'd in Water
only, without losing the least estimable Weight,
have such sensible Effects, as in Time to do all
that any other Preparation can, as I am con∣vinced
it will: we can easily conceive how any
Preparation of it, impregnating the Chyle
with its infinite small Particles, may enter the
<HI>Lacteals</HI> and pervade the whole Habit, and
when long continu'd, may have wonderful
Efficacy on the most distant Parts of the
Body; for the even actually almost infi∣nite
Smallness of its Parts, the <HI>Sphericity</HI> of
its Particles, and its exceeding great <HI>Weight,</HI>
will make it in any <HI>Shape</HI> pass readily thro'
any Animal Substance in Time. The Pre∣parations
of Antimony may possibly be of
great Virtue, if sufficiently try'd and examin'd;
but I having us'd none but the common Shop
ones, finding the Preparations of <HI>Mercury</HI> suf∣ficient,
<PB N="136" REF="172"/>
can say nothing of them. The Pre∣parations
of <HI>Mercury,</HI> some one or other,
seem much more proper for this Intention.</P>
<P>§. VIII. I SHALL say nothing of the other
<HI>Attenuants,</HI> especially those of the Vegetable
Kind, whose Virtues may be easily learn'd from
the Books of the <HI>Materia Medica</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Phytobasanos of Sir</HI> John Floyer.</NOTE>. As for
those of the Mineral Kind, of which I have
said nothing in particular, I leave them to the
Judgment of those Physicians, who have had
more Experience of them; my Practice and
Observation having confin'd me pretty much
to those I have remark'd on, finding them the
most ready, sufficient, and, by their Nature,
fittest. I shall only add a Word or two con∣cerning
the <HI>Wild Valerian</HI> (so much com∣mended
by <HI>Fabius Columna</HI>) in all <HI>Nervous</HI>
Cases, but especially the worst and highest
Degrees of them. It is certainly one of the
most <HI>active</HI> and <HI>volatile</HI> of the Vegetable
Kingdom, and seems to act chiefly by pro∣moting
the Perspiration, and a gentle <HI>Dia∣phoresis.</HI>
The Root powder'd and given with
<HI>Cinnabar of Antimony</HI> and Powder of <HI>Black
Hellebor,</HI> has frequently good Success; and a
Tea made of its Leaves, is an admirable Di∣luter,
and may be long continu'd with Ad∣vantage
in these Cases. I will say nothing
here of the <HI>Misletoe,</HI> it belonging (in my
<PB N="137" REF="173"/>
Opinion) to another Class of Medicines (to
wit, <HI>Astringents</HI>) to be mention'd after∣wards.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Medicines proper for the Second
Intention.</HEAD>
<P>§. I. WHEN the former <HI>Intention</HI> has
been sufficiently and successfully
pursu'd, so that the Blood is re∣turn'd
to its due Degree of Thinness, Fluidity
and <HI>Balsam;</HI> when the Acuteness of the Pains,
and the Violence of the Symptoms are lessen'd
by the ponderous Remedies, and the <HI>Fits</HI> or
<HI>Paroxysms</HI> are less severe or frequent: then the
Medicines of <HI>this</HI> Class may be united and com∣pounded
with those of the <HI>former,</HI> to sheath
and blunt the <HI>Acrimony</HI> of the Salts, and the
Sharpness of the Juices, discharg'd from the
small Vessels: to scour and cleanse the internal
Sides of these Vessels yet further: and drive
the ponderous Medicines into the most remote
<HI>Capillaries,</HI> where the Disorder first begins,
and is most rooted: there to open a Passage
<PB N="138" REF="174"/>
for the Circulation and Perspiration, and re∣move
any Obstructions, putrid or stagnant
Juices, and so to bring all the Secretions to a
regular Order, and the whole Mass of the
Fluids to a due Degree of Sweetness and <HI>Bal∣sam.</HI>
This Method and Order must necessarily
be follow'd, where a total and absolute Cure is
intended or expected: But where a <HI>Palliative</HI>
Cure only is design'd, these may be blended
with the former, even from the beginning of
the Cure. And where the Blood is in that
Condition, which I have mention'd as the
last and worst State: they may even take the
Place of the former and go before them, if
there be any reasonable Hopes of Success;
because the great Degree of Acrimony dif∣fus'd
thro' the whole Mass of Blood, requires
a more immediate Attention and Application,
than the removing of Obstructions; (which
is often the Case in many <HI>Scorbutick, Hectick,
Icterical, Scrophulous</HI> and <HI>Cancerous</HI> Habits:)
at least the Medicines for the Second Inten∣tion,
are the absolutely necessary: and the only
Means that can effectuate a <HI>Palliative</HI> Cure,
and relieve the Symptoms then.</P>
<P>§. II. WATER is acknowledg'd to be the
most universal <HI>Dissolver</HI> of Salts of all Kinds,
and would certainly dissolve these mention'd
<HI>Concretions</HI> in the greater Vessels, and help to
carry them out of the Habit; but it not
having Activity or Agility enough to get into
<PB N="139" REF="175"/>
the small Vessels, where the Danger is greatest,
and the Want most, it cannot alone be suffi∣cient
here. Those Medicines therefore that
are of the most <HI>active</HI> and <HI>volatile</HI> Kind,
which have, as it were, a <HI>penetrating</HI> Steam
or Vapour flowing out of them, like that of
Fire or Light: which can most readily per∣vade
the Solids, and get into the inmost Re∣cesses
of the Habit, seem to be the most effe∣ctual
for this Purpose; especially if a soft
Balsam be added to these Qualities, which
may both sheath the Salts in the great Vessels,
as it goes along to the small ones, or so guard
against their Irritation and Acrimony, as to
hinder their otherwise destructive Effects.
Of this Kind all the <HI>foetid</HI> and <HI>volatile</HI> Sub∣stances
seem to be the chief: or those which
emit the strongest <HI>Effluvia,</HI> or in the greatest
Quantity, such are particularly the <HI>volatile
Gums</HI> and Juices, the volatile <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI>
which are nothing but solid or liquid Natural
<HI>Phosphori,</HI> or Fire Substances. To these may
be join'd the Soaps, and <HI>Saponaceous</HI> Sub∣stances.</P>
<P>§. III. THE principal Medicines of this
<HI>Tribe</HI> are, <HI>Gum Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Assa
foetida, Sagapenum, Myrrh, Guajacum, Cam∣phire,
Castor, Amber, Salt of Hartshorn, Salt
of Amber, Salt</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Human Skulls,</HI>
and of <HI>Raw Silk, Castile Soap, Saffron, Gar∣lick,
Horse-Radish,</HI> and the like, of which
<PB N="140" REF="176"/>
there is sufficient Variety; but these seem to
be the most powerful.</P>
<P>§. IV. AMONG these I should prefer the
<HI>Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Sagapenum,</HI> but espe∣cially
the <HI>Assa faetida,</HI> since we are at the last
come to judge of and easily find out the true,
from, and in the Adulterated, by its cutting
white, and turning afterwards of a Pink-Blossom
Colour, according to the Description
of it by the <HI>Antients</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Plinii Hist. Nat.</HI> Lib. XIX. Cap. 3.</NOTE>, by whom its Virtues
are celebrated with Praises, even above the
Merit of any natural Remedy. It certainly
deserves (as a present Relief in extreme Cases)
as much as any one Thing in the <HI>Materia
Medica</HI> in such Cases, it having all the kindly
Effects of quieting <HI>Anxiety</HI> and <HI>Oppression,</HI>
procuring Rest, and all the other Benefits of
<HI>Opium,</HI> without leaving that Lowness and
Depression behind it, which this last, when
its Force is wrought off, does in most Persons,
like Brandy or Inflammatory Spirits: insomuch,
that in a great many Cases and Constitutions
it is a great Question, whether the present
Relief be sufficient to balance the subsequent
<HI>Oppression</HI> and <HI>Anxiety:</HI> for which there is
no other Remedy, but repeating one Dose as
another wears off, as the <HI>Turks</HI> do, or as
Drunkards do with their Drams, till both
<PB N="141" REF="177"/>
come to be without Measure or End, and
have made the Disease perhaps irremediable
by any Means, but the Death which it cer∣tainly
brings on. But this natural <HI>Phosphorus</HI>
having Light and Activity without Fire or
Heat, easily pervades the whole Habit, and
penetrates the smallest Vessels, and makes the
Perspiration flow readily, as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Medicina Statica,</HI> Sect. 3. Aph. 82.</NOTE> <HI>Sanctorius</HI> ob∣serves,
and thus gives a Relief for some con∣siderable
Time; and when other proper Me∣thods
are join'd with it, will help forward a
lasting Cure. The <HI>Soots</HI> of some or any Woods
are, or seem to me to be, of the same Nature
and Efficacy, and are, I think, <HI>Phosphorus</HI>'s,
(where the remaining Fire is actually, but lies
hid under the Ashes) which by their Activity
and <HI>Volatility</HI> getting into the small Vessels,
the Joints and Muscular Substances, dissolves
and melts the Jelly and Size, (as actual Fire
does Hartshorn Jelly and Glew) and thereby
enables them to circulate for some Time, and
so become at best but Reliefs and Reprieves,
but no Cures; for accordingly, if not con∣stantly
repeated, the Complaints return, as
a Man of a chilly Constitution, must be
always hovering over the Fire.</P>
<P>§. V. I SHOULD say something of <HI>Ammo∣niacum,</HI>
but that its Virtues are sufficiently
<PB N="142" REF="178"/>
known in <HI>Asthmatick</HI> and <HI>Pulmonick</HI> Cases,
(where it is the sovereign Remedy, and most
effectually attenuates viscid Phlegm) to make
its Efficacy believ'd in the Cases of viscid
Juices I am speaking of. <HI>Sagapenum</HI> likewise
and <HI>Galbanum</HI> are very effectual for the same
Purpose. Nor ought the Product of our own
Country, <HI>Garlick</HI> and <HI>Horse-Radish,</HI> to be
neglected, the first of which is as effectual in
<HI>Lung</HI> Cases, as the mention'd <HI>Ammoniacum.</HI>
The only Inconvenience of these <HI>foetid</HI> Medi∣cines
is the disagreeable Taste and Scent they
leave, which is so offensive to delicate Per∣sons;
but that may be, in a great measure,
overcome by proper Mixtures, or must be
born with in extreme Cases. Under this <HI>Class,</HI>
and chiefly to answer this <HI>Intention,</HI> the <HI>Aci∣dulae</HI>
or <HI>Mineral Waters</HI> ought to be rank'd,
but most eminently the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, because
of their <HI>Sulphur</HI> as well as <HI>Steel;</HI> and it is
because the ponderous and active Remedies
have not been sufficiently ply'd before, in
habitual and obstinate <HI>Nervous</HI> Cases, that
<HI>Bath Waters</HI> have not always these sensible
and lasting Effects, as they most infallibly
would have, if duly class'd and manag'd; and
in all such <HI>Cachectical</HI> and <HI>Nervous</HI> Cases,
<HI>Mineral</HI> Waters, <HI>these</HI> especially, are the best
and safest Vehicle for <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicines:
and in want of these <HI>Barley Water,</HI> with Syrup
of <HI>Marsh-Mallows,</HI> Decoction of <HI>Comfrey
Roots,</HI> with <HI>Syrup of Mulberries,</HI> or sweet
<PB N="143" REF="179"/>
<HI>Cow-Whey</HI> drank plentifully, are best to sepa∣rate,
dissolve and sheath these burning and
destructive Salts, of which the <HI>Element</HI> Water
in itself is the surest and most effectual <HI>Anti∣dote,</HI>
the <HI>Mineral</HI> giving it Activity and Pe∣netration
chiefly.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Medicines proper for the Third
Intention.</HEAD>
<P>§. I. WHEN the two former <HI>Inten∣tions</HI>
have been follow'd for a
due Time with suitable Suc∣cess,
so that the <HI>Symptoms</HI> are abated, and
tolerable Ease is obtain'd, it will be then
convenient to enter upon the Method and
Medicines of the <HI>Third</HI> Intention: which will
make the Case both more comfortable, and
bring Spirits and Courage to go thro' with
it, being the last Stage towards a compleat
Cure. For the Medicines here are more
grateful to Nature, strengthening the dige∣stive
Powers, and making all the <HI>Functions</HI>
more full and strong, so that Vigour and
Chearfulness flow in daily. And surely there
<PB N="144" REF="180"/>
is not a more agreeable Entertainment, both
to <HI>Physician</HI> and <HI>Patient,</HI> than to observe the
growing Steps of such a flattering Prospect,
advancing gradually without Fear or Danger
of Relapse, unless the Patient return to those
Indiscretions that first begot these Disorders.
This Pleasure I have enjoy'd myself once and
again in both Capacities.</P>
<P>§. II. THE Medicines which answer this
Intention, will be those of the Strength∣ning
and Astringent Kind, which <HI>contract,
corrugate,</HI> wind up and give Firmness and
Force to the weak and relaxed Solids, Fibres
and Nerves. Of this <HI>Tribe</HI> are all the <HI>Bitters,
Aromaticks</HI> and <HI>Chalybeats:</HI> such as the
<HI>Jesuit's Bark, Steel, Gentian, Zedoary, Cas∣samunair,
Calamus aromaticus, Snakeweed,
Contrayerva, Cinamon, Winter's Bark, Cha∣momile
Flowers, Wormwood</HI> and <HI>Centaury-Tops,
Terra Japanica,</HI> &amp;c. Here likewise the <HI>Oak
Bark,</HI> and its Offspring the <HI>Misletoe</HI> and
<HI>Acorns,</HI> seem to have their proper Place, and
every thing that is subacid, whether Mineral
or Vegetable.</P>
<P>§. III. I THINK there is not a more won∣derful
Strengthner of the Solids in all the
Compass of Medicine, than the <HI>Jesuits Bark.</HI>
The first time I us'd it myself as a Strengthner
and bitter Astringent (after having diluted and
thinn'd my Juices sufficiently by Medicine and
<PB N="145" REF="181"/>
Diet) I can say it with Truth, never any thing
in Nature (Medicinal) affected me in so sen∣sible
and surprizing a Manner, or gave me so
quick an Appetite, such Activity, and so serene
clear Spirits, as the <HI>Bark</HI> did, after taking it
for some Time. It is true, these Effects did
not last in their greatest Heighth always, but
they were still considerable for a long Time:
and I went on gaining Ground by it in that
<HI>Period</HI> (for I continu'd it near a Year) till I
had a perfect Recovery. I have seen pretty
near the same Effects from it in others, and
in the like <HI>Nervous</HI> Cases: tho' it had not the
same Degree of good Success in my next Re∣lapse,
as was not to be expected in a further
advanc'd Age; but still it had better than any
other, and I take it universally to be the best
and only cool bitter Astringent known to
Men. I have known People labouring under
an internal <HI>Goutish</HI> Humour (even those be∣longing
to the <HI>Profession of Physick</HI>) who have
affirm'd to me, that they were never vapour'd
or low-spirited to any Degree, while they con∣tinu'd
the Use of the <HI>Bark</HI> under the <HI>Gout,</HI> which
they had interrupted only, because they had been
assur'd, that it confin'd and ty'd up the <HI>Gouty</HI>
Humour from being thrown outward: than
which there is nothing more salse and absurd;
for nothing so much promotes the <HI>Gouty</HI>
Humour towards the Extremities, because it
strengthens the Solids: And I have frequently
<PB N="146" REF="182"/>
given a Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI> with it and <HI>Steel,</HI>
when nothing else would effect it; and I
always found it the most effectual of all Me∣dicines,
to recover Appetite, Strength and
Spirits, after a severe Fit was over, as is
now universally experienc'd and acknow∣ledg'd.</P>
<P>§. IV. NEXT to the <HI>Bark</HI> (or even be∣yond
it) is <HI>Steel,</HI> or <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Medicines and
<HI>Mineral Chalybeat</HI> Waters, which act prin∣cipally
by constricting, crisping, and wind∣ing
up the relax'd Solids. Weak and young
Persons, and slight Cases, do well with liquid
Steel, such as the <HI>Vinum Chalybeatum, Tinc∣tura
Martis,</HI> the Solution of <HI>Sal Martis</HI> in
common Water, <HI>Elixir Vitrioli,</HI> and the like.
But those who are stronger and older, re∣quire
<HI>Steel Rust,</HI> join'd with Aromaticks and
Bitters, and the <HI>Bark;</HI> for they are all
of one <HI>Tribe</HI> and <HI>Class</HI> of Medicines, and
differ only in Degree: in which the Prepa∣rations
of <HI>Iron</HI> is the strongest, as is evident
from its <HI>Energy</HI> in Externally stopping Haemor∣rhages,
and corrugating tender Fibres, and its
partaking the Nature of Vitriol and Acids.
Where these do not relieve at least, the Case
must be very bad, or the Medicines apply'd
much out of Time, while the Juices were
too viscid, or not sufficiently thin and sweet.
<HI>Sydenham</HI> seem'd to doubt, whether Purga∣tives
<PB N="147" REF="183"/>
ought to be join'd with <HI>Chalybeats</HI> in
the same Course; but that can be no Diffi∣culty
to those who have understood what has
been before said, or are well acquainted with
true Philosophy and the Animal <HI>OEconomy.</HI>
For the Purgatives are either simply design'd
(in such a Case) to cleanse the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI>
or to <HI>fuse</HI> and thin the Blood: in the first
Case they are absolutely necessary, and in the
second more so, if the <HI>first Intention</HI> has not been
fully pursu'd before: As we find by <HI>Lower</HI>'s
bitter Tincture, especially when a Purgative
and Chalybeat with the <HI>Bark</HI> is combin'd, which
succeeds wonderfully in such Cases, where
the Habit is pretty full, and the Solids not
much relax'd. But a long Course of <HI>Cha∣lybcat</HI>
Mineral Waters is still the most effe∣ctual
for the Purpose: <HI>Spaw, Pyrmont,</HI> or
<HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in the hot Weather; and <HI>Bath</HI> in
the temperate and cold Weather. Some fearful
and apprehensive People have been dissuaded,
by interested Persons, from the Use of the
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters in <HI>Lowness, Oppression,</HI> and <HI>Va∣pours;</HI>
and some unexperienced People have
even imagin'd they have had more Vapours
than ordinary under the Use of them. But these
may as well affirm, that <HI>Opium</HI> purges, and
<HI>Jallap</HI> binds. For if they mend the Faults
and Weaknesses of the Stomach and Bowels,
(as all the World acknowledges they do, and
must do by their Nature and Composition)
they must then infallibly be most beneficial
<PB N="148" REF="184"/>
in these Disorders, as from my own, and the
Experience of many thousand others, can be
testified, who will affirm them to be the most
certain Relief of any in such Cases. And
indeed, as by their <HI>Sulphur</HI> thus dissolv'd in
hot Water, they are the most cleansing and
diluting of all Medicines, so their <HI>Steel</HI> (as I
have already said) is the most effectual for bra∣cing
the Solids: And with such a Composition
it would be pretty strange they should not (if
any Means could) be successful in such Cases.
They may raise some Mist and Dimness be∣fore
the Eyes in foul Stomachs, nay even occa∣sion
some Head-Aches and Flatulence, which
may properly enough be call'd <HI>Vapourish</HI> or
<HI>Nervous;</HI> but the same every active Remedy
will produce; and these may be easily reme∣died,
by joining some <HI>Volatiles, Aromaticks</HI>
or <HI>Bitters</HI> along with them. If they have
not the greatest Benefit is expected, it is be∣cause
the <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicines mention'd, and
those for the <HI>first Intention,</HI> have not before,
upon first drinking them, been sufficiently
and long enough persisted in; for certainly
they are the most agreeable and beneficial
<HI>Vehicle</HI> for such Medicines, and the most
sure Remedy, after such a Course, to be found
on the <HI>Globe,</HI> as I have long experienced. The
greatest Misfortune is, that their Relief does
not last for a very long Time, at least not at
an equal Heighth. But that is the Misfortune
of all Remedies in bad Cases and Constitu∣tions,
<PB N="149" REF="185"/>
and their beneficial Effects will last
longer than that of any other Remedy, under
the Management I have mention'd.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Regimen of Diet proper for
Nervous Distempers.</HEAD>
<P>§. I. HAVING deliver'd, in the best
Manner I am able, the general
Method of Cure of <HI>Nervous</HI> Dis∣tempers,
the several <HI>Intentions</HI> to be follow'd
in the Prosecution of it, and the best Medi∣cines
I can suggest from Experience, Obser∣vation,
or the Nature of Things, for fulfilling
each of these <HI>Intentions;</HI> I come now to the
<HI>Diaetetick</HI> Management, <HI>that Part</HI> which
has the greatest Influence in the Cure of
<HI>Chronical Distempers,</HI> without which the best
and surest Remedies fail of their Effect, and
yet in these later Ages the least <HI>cultivated</HI> and
most neglected of all the curative Parts of
Physick in <HI>England,</HI> (till of late, that <HI>my wor∣thy,
learned</HI> and <HI>ingenious Friend,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ar∣buthnott,</HI>
thought fit to treat it according to
<PB N="150" REF="186"/>
its <HI>Use and Dignity,</HI> in the masterly Manner
he executes every thing he undertakes) inso∣much
that he hazards the Charge of intro∣ducing
new and whimsical Opinions, who
would pretend to stand up in its Defence,
or bring it into his Practice. And yet, if we
will make but a slender Enquiry into the
Practice of the early and purest Ages of <HI>Phy∣sick,</HI>
or the great and universally approv'd
<HI>Writers</HI> in the healing <HI>Art,</HI> we shall find
<HI>Diet</HI> no such contemptible Help towards the
Prevention or Cure of Diseases, as it is now
held or imagin'd. On the contrary, we shall
find the Works of all the most judicious and
celebrated Practitioners full of particular Di∣rections
and Advices on this <HI>Topick</HI> in every
Disease they treat of; and demonstrating that
their <HI>Authors,</HI> as they did not find, so they
did not imagine, that any (at least habitual
and rooted) Distemper, could be remov'd
without such Assistance. We are certainly
provided with a greater Choice of more
perfect Materials, as well as more elegant
Forms of Medicines, than the <HI>Antients;</HI> and
this probably will still increase, by length of
Time, with <HI>Arts,</HI> the Knowledge of Nature,
and even of our Diseases; but what is, and
will be ever admired among the <HI>Antients,</HI> is
their <HI>Method of Cure,</HI> the Truth and Just∣ness
of their <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Maxims,</HI> and the Soli∣dity
of their <HI>Intentions</HI> in following the Di∣rections
of Nature in the Way she intends or
<PB N="151" REF="187"/>
points out. <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> the Father of the
<HI>Physicians,</HI> thought a <HI>Regimen of Diet</HI> of such
Consequence, both to the <HI>Healthy</HI> and the
<HI>Sick,</HI> that of about <HI>ninety Books</HI> of his which
remain, or that pass under his Name, there
are eight of them which treat of that Matter
only or principally; and thro' all the rest of
his Works, he mentions much more of his
<HI>Diaetetick</HI> Management, than any Assistance
he took from the <HI>Materia Medica.</HI> He com∣plains,
that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epidem. lib. 6.</NOTE> those who went before him,
had written nothing concerning the <HI>Diet</HI> of
sick Persons, which was nevertheless one of
the most essential Parts of <HI>Physick,</HI> even in
his Time, which we may justly suppose
wanted it less than later Ages. <HI>Galen,</HI> tho'
more abounding in Medicines, yet is far
from depriving Diet of its due Place. On
the contrary he declares,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De usu Theriaces ad Pamphylianum.</NOTE> <HI>“That Physick has
no Remedy so effectual as to be able to bring
its wanted Relief where the Regimen of
Diet either counter-acts or does not assist it.</HI>
And in another Place he says,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lib. 5. De Sanitate tuenda.</NOTE> <HI>“That by
means of that part of Physick which pre∣scribes
a proper Diet, those who have
deriv'd too tender and weakly a Constitution
from their Parents, have brought themselves
on to extreme old Age, without any Weak∣ness
<PB N="152" REF="188"/>
of their Senses, free from all Pain and
Diseases.”</HI> He adds afterwards concerning
himself, <HI>“Even I, tho' I had not a healthy
Constitution from my Birth, nor led a Life
of much Freedom and Ease of Mind, yet by
the Precepts of this most useful part of Phy∣sick,
which I practised after the 28th Year
of my Age, I never fell into any Distemper,
except a slight Fever of 24 Hours through
Weariness or Excess of Labour.”</HI> The
<HI>Methodists,</HI> a celebrated <HI>Sect</HI> among the An∣tient
Physicians, laid the main Stress of the
Cure upon <HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Evacuations;</HI> and some
of them carry'd this to an extravagant Heighth.
But <HI>Celsus,</HI> who seems to have judiciously
distinguish'd, and kept in a proper <HI>Medium</HI>
between the Extremes, that the different <HI>Sects</HI>
of <HI>Physick</HI> in his Time, had carry'd each their
particular and favourite Doctrines to, was yet
sufficiently sensible and convinc'd of the Ne∣cessity
of a proper <HI>Diet</HI> in the Cure of Dis∣eases;
for he is not only large and full in his
Directions and Regulations about it, in every
particular Disease he treats of: but where he
distinguishes between internal and external
Disorders, he calls the <HI>first</HI> those in which
the Regulation of <HI>Diet</HI> is the principal Part
of the Cure, and the <HI>latter</HI> those where <HI>Me∣dicines</HI>
make the chief Part of it. Even in
the same Place, where he takes some Pains
to refute the Doctrine of <HI>Asclepiades,</HI> who
maintain'd that all Diseases were to be cured
<PB N="153" REF="189"/>
by <HI>Diet</HI> alone, and to restore Medicines to their
proper Place. He goes further, to enjoin
<HI>absolute Fasting</HI> in the first Attacks of a Dis∣order,
and a strict Moderation in the Quan∣tity
as well as Quality of the Food, during
all the Time that the Disease continues; for
nothing, <HI>he says,</HI> is more beneficial to a sick
Person, than <HI>timely Abstinence.</HI> Then he pro∣ceeds
to shew the Reasonableness of such a
Conduct, and to blame and reprove those
luxurious Persons, who will allow their <HI>Phy∣sicians</HI>
to determine the Kind and Quantity
of their Food, but reserve to themselves the
Times of taking it; or who think they act
very generously if they submit to his Regula∣tions
in every thing besides the Kinds or Qua∣lities
of it: and ends with assuring them of
the extreme Hurtfulness of any Error, either
in the Quality, the Quantity, or the Times
of taking their Nourishment. It were end∣less
to produce Authorities for a Thing that
makes a great Part of the Works of all the
standard Writers in Physick, I mention these
only, because they are acknowledg'd the great
Masters in this <HI>Science,</HI> and whose Evidences
must of Consequence, include the Suffrages
of all their Approvers and Admirers; and as
they will be sufficient to give the Reader, who
is not conversant in these Matters, a just Notion
of the Consequence of <HI>Diet</HI> in the Cure of
Diseases. For I do not pretend to add (by
what I have here said) any thing to the Know∣ledge
<PB N="154" REF="190"/>
of those whose Study or Profession has
led them to search into these Affairs, since
they will not want Conviction. But here one
will naturally inquire how so necessary and
essential a Part of <HI>Physick</HI> comes to be in such
Disgrace, and so little regarded, as it is at
present, since it was so much recommended,
and made up so great a Part of the Practice
of the most admired <HI>Physicians.</HI> The Origi∣nal
of this Evil seems to be owing to some
over-zealous Abettors of <HI>Chymistry.</HI> The <HI>Al∣chymists,</HI>
or more conceited and whimsical
sort of <HI>Chymists,</HI> were the great Men, that,
depending solely upon Medicines, endeavour'd
to discredit <HI>Diet</HI> in the Cure of Diseases,
bragging and ranting in Honour of their <HI>Pa∣nacaea's,
Elixirs of Life,</HI> and other wonderful
<HI>Secrets,</HI> which, if you will believe the In∣ventors
and Admirers of them, were suffi∣cient,
without any other Means, even a <HI>Re∣gimen
of Diet,</HI> or whatever all Physicians be∣fore
had thought most indispensible, to work
infallible Cures in the most desperate Diseases.
It was this, and nothing else, they pretended
to. When once such an ill Practice is set
on foot, the Patients themselves, as <HI>Celsus</HI>
observ'd in his Time, are so averse to being
confin'd by disagreeable Restraints, that they are
prepar'd to believe every Impostor, that will
take upon him to dispense with the most ne∣cessary
Condition of Cure, and entertain a
Prejudice against those who will honestly in∣sist
<PB N="155" REF="191"/>
upon the Necessity of what they dislike,
being more willing to believe such Physicians
are not sufficiently acquainted with the <HI>Vir∣tues</HI>
and <HI>Powers</HI> of Medicines, than that Me∣dicines
have no such Virtues as they would
so fain find them possess'd of: And they are
generally so fond of being prescrib'd to rather
in the most agreeable than in the most effec∣tual
Manner, that not only few of them will
submit to any Restraints in Diet, but by their
Squeamishness and intemperate Delicacy, bring
some of the most powerful Medicines into
Disgrace, and less and less common Use; so
that we may fear, not only the <HI>Bark</HI> (the
Aversion of every nice Palate) but <HI>Mercury,
Steel,</HI> and several other of the best Medi∣cines,
which on the first Discovery were
look'd upon as great <HI>Gifts of God</HI> for the Re∣lief
of human Miseries, will in time be quite
disus'd, and perhaps forgot. However, since
we who are <HI>Physicians</HI> are bound <HI>by a most
solemn Oath</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Hippocrat. p. 42. Vol. I. Edit. Vander Lind. or Edit. Faesii, Sect. 1, 23.</NOTE> (contriv'd by <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> for
ought we know, at least it is handed down
to us among his other Works, and is the Sub∣stance,
I believe, of the Obligation and Vow
that <HI>Candidates</HI> take in all the <HI>Universities</HI> in
<HI>Europe,</HI> when they receive their Degrees of
<HI>Physick</HI>) to order a <HI>Regimen of Diet</HI> proper
and peculiar to each Distemper we undertake
<PB N="156" REF="192"/>
the Cure of, as well as proper Medicines, I
shall proceed to inform the Reader of what
I have found most beneficial or successful on
this Head towards the Cure of the Disorders
I am now treating of.</P>
<P>§. II. IT is highly probable, that the infi∣nitely
wise Author of our Nature has provi∣ded
proper <HI>Remedies</HI> and <HI>Reliefs</HI> in every <HI>Cli∣mate,</HI>
for all the Distempers and Diseases in∣cident
to their respective Inhabitants, if in
his Providence he has necessarily placed them
there: And certainly the <HI>Food</HI> and <HI>Physick</HI>
proper and peculiar to the middling Sort of
each <HI>Country</HI> and <HI>Climate,</HI> is the best of any
possible for the Support of the Creatures he
has unavoidably placed there, provided only
that they follow the Simplicity of Nature,
the Dictates of Reason and Experience, and
do not lust after <HI>foreign Delicacies:</HI> as we see
by the Health and Chearfulness of the <HI>mid∣dling
Sort</HI> of almost all Nations. And who∣ever
is acquainted with the <HI>History</HI> of the
<HI>Origin of Nations,</HI> and the Manner in which
they liv'd, preserv'd themselves in Health,
and got rid of their Diseases, while they liv'd
in their Simplicity, and had not yet grown
luxurious, rich and wanton, or had frequent
Commerce with other Nations, and com∣municated
with them in their <HI>Luxury</HI> and
<HI>Arts,</HI> will be pretty well satisfy'd of this
Truth. But where the <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Diseases</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="193"/>
of all the Nations on the <HI>Globe</HI> are brought
together, mingled and blended, and perhaps
heighten'd by the Difference of <HI>Climates,</HI> there
is an absolute Necessity that the <HI>Materials of
Physick,</HI> and the Methods of Cure, should be
various and extended in an equal Proportion:
which is the Cause of the Multiplicity of our
Medicines, and the Necessity that <HI>Physicians</HI>
are under to know almost every Thing that
is knowable in Nature, for the Use of <HI>Physick:</HI>
and to bring from each <HI>Country</HI> and <HI>Climate</HI>
the proper <HI>Antidote</HI> for the Distemper brought
from thence.</P>
<P>§. III. THERE is also another <HI>infinitely wise</HI>
Contrivance in Nature, that <HI>Loathing</HI> and <HI>In∣appetency,</HI>
or at least a Difficulty in Digestion,
always attends, in some Degree or other, all
Disorders whatsoever. Were every one that
is a little ill, capable of the same <HI>Riot</HI> and <HI>Ex∣cess</HI>
during their Distemper that they were
when in perfect Health, when they laid in
the Materials of their Disorders, they would
infallibly and quickly ruin themselves, and
perish without Resource: Whereas by this
wise Necessity, they are not only hinder'd
from adding <HI>Oil</HI> to the <HI>Flame,</HI> but find a new
Increase of their Pains and Punishments, up∣on
the smallest Excess, which puts them un∣der
the Necessity of forbearing: if the Plea∣sure
of gratifying their Sensuality is not greater
than the Sense of the Pain. And in some
<PB N="158" REF="194"/>
Cases, where there has been a great Dispo∣sition
towards <HI>Luxury</HI> in the Patient, and
where the Cure depended only or chiefly
upon <HI>Abstinence,</HI> I have with Pleasure ad∣mired
the Art and Ingenuity of a <HI>Physician,</HI>
who, to keep up his Patient's Spirits during
the tedious Cure, and gain the Advantages
of Temperance and Abstinence as much as
he was able, has prescrib'd a Course of in∣nocent,
tho' neither palatable nor appetizing
Medicines, for a long time, without teazing
his Patient with the dispiriting and mortify∣ing
Doctrine of <HI>Self-Denial,</HI> which either he
had despised, or not receiv'd in its proper
Degree and Manner, and thus effected the
Cure, which otherwise had been impossi∣ble.</P>
<P>§. IV. THERE is no surer or more gene∣ral
<HI>Maxim</HI> in <HI>Physick,</HI> than that Diseases are
cured by the contrary or opposite Methods
to that which produc'd them. If <HI>Nervous</HI>
Disorders are the Diseases of the Wealthy,
the Voluptuous, and the Lazy, (as I have
already shewn) and are mostly produc'd, and
always aggravated and increased, by <HI>Luxury</HI>
and <HI>Intemperance</HI> (tho' perhaps not always
an absolute and outragious Intemperance, yet
certainly by one relative to the particular
Constitution and Strength of the Patient)
there needs no great Depth of Penetration to
find out that <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Abstinence</HI> is
<PB N="159" REF="195"/>
necessary towards their <HI>Cure.</HI> But as there
are different Stages or Degrees of these Dis∣orders,
and even seemingly different <HI>Kinds</HI>
of them, according to the Prevalency of this
or that particular Quality in the Materials of
the general Cause: whereby different Effects,
Appearances, and Symptoms are produc'd
with greater or lesser Violence, and longer
or shorter Duration; so different Regulations
in the Quantity and Quality of the Food, is
necessary towards their Removal: I shall
therefore first give some <HI>general</HI> Directions in
these two last Particulars, and afterwards
subjoin some Considerations, to be made in
the Application to particular Cases.</P>
<P>§. V. As to the Qualities of the solid Food,
it is necessary, 1<HI>st.</HI> That it be soft and ten∣der,
light and easy of Digestion, and afford∣ing
a mild or <HI>Balsamick Chyle;</HI> that its Ma∣terials
be sound and good in their Kind, and
fitted for Use, without the artful Composures
of <HI>Cookery,</HI> or the Means us'd commonly in
making it more <HI>luscious and palatable;</HI> and
likewise, that it be the most simple and un∣compounded,
and that fewest different Mate∣rials
possible be receiv'd into the same Meal;
for as they will only serve to provoke Excess,
so, as <HI>Celsus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. III. Cap. 6. Vide etiam Sanct. Med. Static. Sect. 3.
Aph. 51.</NOTE> observes, “<HI>Variety of Foods,
<PB N="160" REF="196"/>
tho' they may go down with greater Ease
and Pleasure, yet they are not so easily
digested.” 2dly.</HI> That it be endu'd, as
much as possible, with Qualities contrary to
the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Distemper,</HI> and the <HI>Vices</HI>
of the Fluids:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Sanctorii Aphorismata de Cibo &amp; Potu.</NOTE> That it be <HI>thin</HI> and <HI>diluting,</HI>
where there are viscid or sizy Juices, great
Obstructions, or gross Habits: That cooling
and liquid Things be preferr'd to heating and
drying Foods, where there are acute Pains,
and violent or inflammatory Symptoms: That
Seeds be preferr'd before Roots, Greens, or
Fruits, in Cases of Flatulence; and that soft,
mild, sweet, or at least insipid Things, be
chosen, rather than those that are sharp, salt
or sour, in <HI>Scorbutick, Hectick, Scrophulous,</HI>
or <HI>Cancerous</HI> Cases and Constitutions; or
when there are any Ulcers, Foulness of the
Skin, or other Signs of sharp and acrid Juices:
And so in other Cases.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Arbuthnott</HI> of <HI>Aliments.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>§. VI. THE Quantity of the Food must
be proportion'd to the Strength of the Dige∣stion,
and the Waste or Decay of the Fluids,
from Exercise or bodily Action, or to the
present Fulness of the Habit, and Obstruction
of the natural <HI>Secretions.</HI> But as it is impos∣sible
to give <HI>general Rules</HI> in these Cases,
wherein almost every individual Person differs
<PB N="161" REF="197"/>
from another, or even from himself at diffe∣rent
Times, so the precise Regulation of this
must be left to the Patient's own Feelings,
and the Honesty and Experience of his <HI>Phy∣sician.</HI>
A few Observations upon the Quan∣tity
that agrees best, sits easiest and lightest
on the Stomach, gives no Oppression, Heavi∣ness,
Heat or Feverishness, while it is digest∣ing,
and passes off without any ill Effects,
will most readily determine it for the Patient;
and it is of so great Consequence to the Wel∣fare
of the Patient, that no Pains ought to
be spar'd for attaining the Knowledge of this
precise and precious <HI>Mediocrity,</HI> which ought,
as seldom as possible, to be transgress'd either
way.</P>
<P>§. VII. THOSE who have only a few
transient Symptoms of these Disorders: whose
Constitution is yet sound, and their Juices
good and sweet: if they live with a due De∣gree
of Temperance suited to their Constitu∣tions,
and take care not to increase their Dis∣orders
by Excesses, will need no other Re∣striction,
than to abate of their Quantity while
they are more immediately under these <HI>Symp∣toms:</HI>
will gradually get rid of their Distem∣per,
and avoid violent Shocks, or great
Sufferings: and be restor'd to their former
Health and Freedom of Spirits, by the other
Assistances of Medicine and Exercise. Those
who have deeper, more habitual and violent
<PB N="162" REF="198"/>
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> will need a greater Degree of
Care and Caution; and their Stomach being
weaker, and their Digestion going on slower,
will be necessitated to choose the lightest and
most easily digested Foods, and the smallest
Quantity of <HI>spirituous Liquors:</HI> and will suf∣fer
in Proportion as they exceed the Quantity
that is determin'd by the mentioned Obser∣vations.
For such the lightest, young, and
<HI>white</HI> Animal Foods only, are necessary, and
these also only at Dinner. And if they are
subject to violent and acute <HI>Paroxysms,</HI> they
must be more than ordinary careful about these
Times, and then even use a cooler, softer,
and more liquid Diet. In general, they must
govern themselves by their Feelings, and
take no more at a Time than their Stomach
will easily bear, but rather repeat it oftner;
and they ought always to wait till their Ap∣petite
returns in its usual Degree, and they
will even find, however moderate or abste∣mious
they may seem, that upon any Low∣ness,
Heaviness, or Want of Spirits, still
lighter Meals will restore their Chearfulness.</P>
<P>§. VIII. BUT as for all those whose
Constitutions are spoiled, who have bad or
corrupted Juices, violent and dangerous
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> great <HI>Obstructions,</HI> are subject to the
great and eminent Degrees of these Disorders,
are threaten'd with <HI>Hectic</HI> or <HI>Consumption</HI> (o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Destruction of some of the great <HI>Viscera</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="199"/>
and who have tried all the other Methods
and Medicines that could be suggested with∣out
Success) for these I have found no
other Relief than a <HI>total Abstinence</HI> from
Animal Foods of all Kinds, and all Sorts of
strong and fermented Liquors, keeping only
to Milk, with Seeds or Grains, and the dif∣ferent
Kinds of Vegetable Food, according
to the Nature of the Distemper: from which
they have never fail'd to find a present Re∣lief,
and a considerable Abatement of the
Violence of their Symptoms. Many have
been led into this Method without any Ad∣vice
or Direction, but merely from their
own Feelings, and observing what they were
easiest under. And many more have been
absolutely cur'd and free'd from all their
Disorders by it: some even from a very
short Time after they enter'd upon it, and
others in a longer or shorter Time, accord∣ing
to the Obstinacy of their Distemper, if
the Disease has not been so far gone, as to be
part all possible Relief from natural Means.
In these last Cases it has done all that was in
the Power of <HI>Art,</HI> has lessen'd their Miseries,
and protracted their Fate, and has given
more Ease and Quiet than they could re∣ceive
from any other Method they could
turn to, except <HI>Opiates</HI> and <HI>Anodyn's:</HI> to
which one is never to give himself, till he
has given up all Hopes of a total Cure.
Where the <HI>Nerves</HI> or Solids are naturally
<PB N="164" REF="200"/>
weak, or the Person subject to <HI>nervous
Disorders</HI> from their Infancy, there is no
Method will absolutely free them from some
slight Returns of their former Symptoms; but
this <HI>Diet</HI> I have found to do more than any
other Method whatever: however, no one
ought to undertake this Regimen, without
the Advice of some honest, able, and expe∣rienced
<HI>Physician,</HI> who has consider'd his
Case and Constitution, and can direct him
aright in the proper Management of it, and
the Methods of keeping up the due <HI>Tension</HI>
of his Solids, which such a <HI>Diet</HI> may pro∣bably
somewhat relax, while it is purifying
the Juices, and cleansing the Habit: and ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
likewise judge of his Constancy, Firmness,
and Resolution to go through with it, since
in some deep rooted and confirm'd Distem∣pers
of this Kind, though the Patient may
find a considerable Relief for many Months
yet possibly when the gross Impurities,
the <HI>Choler, Phlegm,</HI> and <HI>Salts</HI> stor'd up in
the Habit, come to be thrown off on the
<HI>Alimentary Tube,</HI> as into the common
Shore, and all the <HI>Emunctory</HI> Glands be∣come
loaded with the <HI>Despumation</HI> of the
whole Habit: raising Sickness, Lowness of
Spirits, and a Return of all, or many, of the
former Disorders; this may blast all his
Hopes, and mightily discourage him, and
make him condemn the Method, and blame
the Physician who advis'd him. But if he
<PB N="165" REF="201"/>
stands this Shock with Firmness and Pa∣tience
(which will be readily relieved by pro∣per
<HI>Evacuations, Volatiles</HI> and <HI>Astringents</HI>) he
may be assured of Success, and his perfect Re∣covery
is at Hand. But as there are incurable
Disorders, which no Method or Medicine will
reach, so it frequently happens in this: And
even after the Patient is recover'd by this Me∣thod,
he must resolve to continue in it ever after,
at least, not to indulge himself in a much
higher Degree of Food, without suffering
presently, or hazarding a Return of all his
Disorders; for as <HI>Celsus</HI> observes, in all Dis∣orders
of the Stomach, <HI>by whatever Methods
the Patient is recover'd, he must continue in
the same when he is well, for the Disease will
return, unless Health be protected by the same
Means that restor'd it.</HI></P>
<P>§. IX. I WOULD not be understood here
(as some have maliciously and artfully mis∣represented
me, contrary to my most deli∣berate
Intention) to recommend a <HI>total Milk</HI>
or a <HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI> or indeed any particu∣lar
one, to every one that is sick, or out of
Order: I never once had such a Dream. I
have given the Preference in my <HI>Essay on the
Gout,</HI> to the common Diet of well-chosen
Flesh Meat, and good middling ripe Wine,
even in that obstinate and painful Distemper,
commonly treated by a Milk Diet. And in
my <HI>Essay on Health and Long Life,</HI> I have
<PB N="166" REF="202"/>
endeavour'd, as far as I could, to enable the
Patient to make the proper Choice of Animal
Foods fit for his Constitution, and the Dis∣orders
he labours under; and have, from con∣sidering
the Nature of the Distemper, actually
order'd some who were in a <HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI>
to change it for an <HI>Animal</HI> one. A total
<HI>Milk and Vegetable</HI> Diet, besides its being
<HI>particular</HI> and inconvenient in a Country
where Animal Food is the common Diet,
and affording no sufficient Store of Animal or
Mechanical Strength (to Persons naturally
weak, or who have not been habituated to
it from their Cradles) may bring the Patient
into such a State, that, without the utmost
Risque or Danger, he can never leave it off
again. And even while he is under it, by
relaxing and softening the Solids, (in some
Degree) when it is a sweetening the Juices,
it brings him under a Necessity of keeping up
their Tension with proper astringent, warm,
and cordial Medicines, (which are of the
same Nature with a more generous Diet) and
incessant Labour and Exercise: And in gross
foul Bodies, or those subject to <HI>goutish, scor∣butick,</HI>
or other <HI>inflammatory Disorders</HI> and
<HI>Paroxysms:</HI> requires the utmost Care and
Caution that the Disease be not thereby at
first, thrown inwards, and so the extreme De∣grees
of Vapours, Lowness, and other <HI>Ner∣vous</HI>
Disorders ensue, which this <HI>Diet</HI> is de∣sign'd
to prevent. Indeed there are some
<PB N="167" REF="203"/>
Cases wherein a <HI>Vegetable</HI> and <HI>Milk Diet</HI>
seems absolutely necessary, as in <HI>severe</HI> and
<HI>habitual Gouts, Rheumatisms, Cancerous, Le∣prous,</HI>
and <HI>Scrophulous</HI> Disorders, extreme
<HI>Nervous Cholicks, Epilepsies,</HI> violent <HI>Hy∣sterick
Fits, Melancholly, Consumptions,</HI>
and the like Diseases mentioned in the Pre∣face,
and towards the last Stages of all chro∣nical
Distempers; in such Distempers I have
seldom seen such a <HI>Diet</HI> fail of a good Effect
at last. But in most other <HI>Chronical Distem∣pers,
Nervous</HI> or <HI>Humourous,</HI> and in all their
tolerable Degrees, and first or second Stages,
a common middling, plain and moderate
Diet is certainly the best and safest; a little
<HI>Animal</HI> Food of the youngest, lightest, ten∣derest,
thinnest, and sweetest Kind, and a
small Proportion of generous Liquors, to
keep up the due <HI>Tension</HI> of the Solids, under
the Regulations I have mention'd; weak
Broths and Soops made of tender young
Animal Substances, without Fat or Butter,
and thicken'd with a due Proportion of Ve∣getable
Seeds or Grains, such as those of
Wheat, Barley, Rice, Sage, Oats, Millet,
and the like: Such a <HI>Diet,</HI> I say, will, in my
Opinion, answer all the Ends of pure <HI>Milk</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables;</HI> and as I have often found
such an one less dangerous, so it is a more
easy Regulation, as things now stand: and
wants only a few Months in the same
Course, of that Cure that might be gain'd
<PB N="168" REF="204"/>
perhaps by going into such a particular Me∣thod
of Diet. I am never for entering up∣on
<HI>extreme</HI> or uncommon Means of <HI>Diet</HI> or
<HI>Medicines,</HI> but in extreme and mortal Cases;
for I always think that <HI>common Sense</HI> is the
best Indication of a sound Mind, and <HI>common
Life</HI> the best Means of temporal Happiness,
else they had never been common.</P>
<P>§. X. ONE great <HI>Advantage</HI> that a <HI>Milk</HI>
and <HI>Vegetable Diet</HI> has over a Flesh or <HI>Ani∣mal</HI>
one, lies principally in this, that one
may thereby avoid the Loading the Juices
with too many <HI>Salts</HI> of any Kind, or thicken∣ing
them with more gross and hard earthy
Particles, or such as cannot be broken and
comminuted by the natural Force of the
weak Solids: and by it Patients will not be
so readily led into Errors in the Quantity;
Nature not being tempted to receive or
retain such unprovoking and impoignant
Viands, whereby they avoid the <HI>Snare</HI> and
<HI>Temptation</HI> that Liquorishness and high Re∣lish
throws many into. <HI>Another</HI> Advantage
is, that it effectually dilutes and cools too
thick or hot Juices, and that a sufficient Quan∣tity
of it may be taken to keep the Bowels
and Blood Vessels full, and sufficiently turgid,
whereby the <HI>Circulation</HI> and natural Evacua∣tions
and Secretions will be more uniformly
carried on in such weak Habits, than can pos∣sibly
be under an <HI>Animal Diet</HI> of so small a
<PB N="169" REF="205"/>
Quantity as must be necessary in such Cases,
unless it be extremely diluted with Water,
and the farinaceous Vegetables, which brings
it to the same State: And therefore, in great∣ly
depraved Habits, and such deep and dan∣gerous
Diseases as I have mention'd, it is the
most proper and absolutely necessary Regi∣men
to carry on the natural Functions with∣out
Pain and Uneasiness, and to preserve the
Sides of the Capillary Vessels from <HI>coalescing</HI>
and growing together, and so preventing
irremediable Obstructions; tho' in other
more slight Cases, it may be not only not ne∣cessary,
but even sometimes inconvenient and
hurtful: For tho' it will always produce at
length Freedom from Pain, and Freedom of
Spirits, and a greater Capacity for intellectual
Functions, yet it will never beget <HI>mechani∣cal</HI>
Force and Strength, or a hardy, strong
Constitution, which in some Circumstances,
Employments, Trades, and Professions, is
indispensably necessary; so that such a
Course and <HI>Regimen</HI> is only proper for those
who follow <HI>Intellectual</HI> Occupations, and ex∣pect
chiefly mental Pleasures, Freedom from
Pain, Chearfulness and Length of Days, or,
in short, for the Studious and Sedentary.</P>
<P>§. XI. THE Sum of the Whole, in my
Opinion, is this: Our Distempers generally
arise from <HI>Oils, Salts,</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> carried
into the Habit by our Food; nothing else but
<PB N="170" REF="206"/>
these, in the Nature of Things, having <HI>Force</HI>
enough to produce them. Some certain
Proportion of these is absolutely necessary to
excite, rouze, and carry on the <HI>Circulation,
Perspiration,</HI> and all the <HI>Secretions</HI> with their
proper Force and Vigour: When the Juices
are too viscid or acrimonious, or the Ob∣structions
many and great, <HI>Diet</HI> offers us
one of the surest Means to cure these ill
Qualities. All <HI>Salts,</HI> in their general Na∣ture,
are of the same Kind, Hard, and
highly Attractive, and differ only as they
are smaller or greater in their Parts, and
according to the Earths, Oils, and other
Mixtures that unite them, or mix with them.
<HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> have but little saline
Matter in Proportion to their Bulk, and
therefore a <HI>total Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI>
may, in some Cases, defraud the Constitu∣tion
of that due Proportion of <HI>Salts</HI> necessary
for the mention'd Purposes, and for want of
which the Solids may become too lax and
feeble. But, on the other hand, too great a
Quantity of Flesh Meat, and hot fermented
Liquors, or that which is of too <HI>saline</HI> and
<HI>spirituous</HI> a Nature, will load the <HI>Habit</HI> with
too many of these Salts and Oils, and so
beget the mention'd Distempers. The great
<HI>Art of Life</HI> then, in <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers, is
to ascertain the <HI>Mediocrity</HI> of such a <HI>Diet</HI> as
neither makes the Salts and Oils too many
to increase the Distemper, nor too few, to
<PB N="171" REF="207"/>
let the Solids become too much relax'd.
Animal Food then, and Spirituous Liquors
become more tolerable in <HI>Northern Climates,</HI>
where the Want of sufficient <HI>Sun,</HI> and the
Moisture of the <HI>Air,</HI> makes the Solids of
somewhat too loose and flabby a Nature, and
so require a greater Proportion of Salts and
Oils, needful to rouze and twitch them,
than in more <HI>Southern Climates.</HI> Suppose,
for Example, a Dram of Salts, and Oils or
Spirits in twenty-four Hours was necessary;
then certainly that <HI>Diet</HI> which conveys this
Dram of Salts and Oils in the whole Substance
of the Food, according to the Bulk, Age,
and Expences of the Life of the Patient,
into the Habit, will be the best, of whatever
Kind it may be. But if, by an Over-charge
of Salts and Oils, Diseases are brought on,
and are to be remedied by a <HI>Diet</HI> wherein
one half of this Quantity is found; then such
Food is to be chosen, or such a Quantity
of it taken, as will convey into the Habit
only half a Dram of such: and if that End
can be obtain'd by following the common
and ordinary <HI>Diet</HI> of the Country and Cli∣mate,
and of the healthiest People in it, then
that is, beyond dispute, the best Regimen
in general to preserve Health. Under Dis∣eases
the Case is different. So that there can
be no Room for mistaking the proper Kind
of <HI>Diet,</HI> nor the Validity of the Reasons on
which it is founded. The only Difficulty
<PB N="172" REF="208"/>
that remains, will be in choosing such Kinds,
and that Quantity of <HI>Animal Food</HI> which best
suits the Age, Bulk, and Constitution of the
Patient, and conveys only the necessary
Quantity of <HI>Salts</HI> and Oils. To determine
which was the chief Design of my <HI>Essay on
Health and Long Life,</HI> and of Dr. <HI>Arbuthnott</HI>'s
<HI>Book of Aliments,</HI> and which is evidently of
the greatest Consequence to all who would
secure these two in the most effectual Man∣ner
Mortality will permit.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Exercise proper for Nervous
Distempers.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. THERE is not any one Thing,
more approv'd and recom∣mended
by all <HI>Physicians,</HI> and
the Experience of all those who have suf∣fer'd
under <HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers, (since the
Distinction has been made) than <HI>Exercise,</HI> of
one Kind or another; and this without the
least Exception or Limitation, but so far as
the Strength can admit; if it is without
Weakening, Fatigue, or Hurry of Spirits.
<PB N="173" REF="209"/>
In the <HI>Southern</HI> Climates, as there is scarce
any, at least few, <HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers of
the lingering and <HI>chronical</HI> Kind, so there
is very little Room for <HI>Exercise</HI> merely for
Health: The Warmth and Action of the
<HI>Sun,</HI> keeping the Blood and Juices sufficient∣ly
fluid, the <HI>Circulation</HI> free, and all the
<HI>Secretions</HI> in their due Degree and Plenty,
so as to prevent Obstructions, to which the
Thinness, Coolness, and Lightness of their
almost <HI>Vegetable Diet</HI> contributes not a little.
But in the more <HI>Northern</HI> and colder Cli∣mates,
where the Food is more gross, higher
and harder of Digestion, being mostly Ani∣mal;
where the <HI>Perspiration</HI> is small, or
scarce any at all, especially in <HI>Nervous</HI> or
<HI>chronical</HI> Distempers, there is an absolute
Necessity of due <HI>Exercise,</HI> and Labour to
supply the Want of <HI>Sun</HI> and thin Air, and
remedy these Defects: The Neglect of which,
in our <HI>cold</HI> Climates, ought to be, in Reason,
reckon'd as absurd, ridiculous, and unna∣tural,
as our using it appears <HI>fantastical</HI> to
<HI>Orientals.</HI> The few Instances brought from
<HI>Spain, Italy, Portugal,</HI> and even more
<HI>Northern</HI> Countries, of People that live
there to a great Age, and without Distem∣pers,
merely sitting still, are little to the
Purpose, consider'd as a <HI>Rule</HI> for our Con∣duct
(since, setting aside the above-men∣tion'd
Advantages, which they enjoy in
<PB N="174" REF="210"/>
common with other <HI>Southern</HI> Countries,
whereby <HI>Exercise</HI> becomes less necessary for
them than for us) they are in a great mea∣sure
excluded from the Benefit they might
possibly reap from it, if it was necessary,
by its being impracticable in any high De∣gree:
For it would be absurd to propose to
them to take long continued Journies in
their scorching <HI>Climate</HI> for the Cure of
Distempers.</P>
<P>§. II. WHEN Mankind was simple, plain,
honest, and frugal, there were few or no
Diseases. <HI>Temperance, Exercise, Hunting,
Labour,</HI> and <HI>Industry</HI> kept the Juices sweet,
and the Solids brac'd. The <HI>Spiritual</HI> Pas∣sions,
however, raged and boiled high;
those, to wit, of <HI>Ambition, Malice, Re∣venge,</HI>
and <HI>Pride,</HI> which beget <HI>Usurpation,
Conquests, Murder,</HI> and <HI>Wars: Labour</HI> and
<HI>Exercise</HI> were observ'd to beget Firmness,
Strength, and Activity for these Purposes.
It was afterwards introduc'd into the <HI>Reli∣gious
Worship. Rewards</HI> and <HI>Honours</HI> were
appointed for the <HI>Victors</HI> in these <HI>sacred</HI>
Contests. But Luxury and Intemperance
having gain'd Ground, thro' Peace, Security,
Ease, and Plenty, Diseases sprang up and
multiplied. <HI>Exercise</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> were intro∣duc'd
into their Cure by <HI>Physicians,</HI> who
had observ'd the Health and Vigour of the
<PB N="175" REF="211"/>
Laborious and Active.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galen. Cap. 58. lib. ad Thrasybulum.</NOTE> <HI>Hippocrates, Diocles,
Paraxagoras,</HI> and <HI>Erasistratus</HI> first introduc'd
it into <HI>Rules, Laws,</HI> and <HI>Order;</HI> appointing
the Times and Kinds of it, appropriated to
each particular Distemper. The <HI>Grecians</HI> in
general, the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> in
particular, erected <HI>Academies, Gymnasia,</HI> or
publick Places, for the common Conveniency
of all Kinds of Exercise, with all proper Ac∣commodations
and Services for that End,
both to train up the People for <HI>War,</HI> and to
preserve them from, and cure their Diseases.
These <HI>Gymnasia</HI> were dedicated to <HI>Apollo,</HI> as
<HI>God</HI> of <HI>Physick,</HI> and thither the <HI>Physicians</HI>
sent all those who laboured under chronical
Distempers, of which <HI>Exercise</HI> and <HI>Diet,</HI>
limited and managed according to the Na∣ture
of the Case, made up all the Cure. By
Degrees it spread over all the <HI>Eastern</HI> and
<HI>Southern</HI> Countries, and at last had so gene∣ral
an Approbation, as to be universally
received all the World over, where Health
was regarded, or the Cure of Distempers
studied. Such has been the original Rise,
Reception, and Approbation of <HI>Exercise,</HI> as
is evident from antient History and univer∣sal
Tradition. Whoever will consult <HI>Le
Clerc,</HI> will be abundantly satisfied in this
Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="212"/>
§. III. THE <HI>Romans</HI> (as wise and brave a
People as ever was formed upon the Foot of
mere Nature) received it with all their other
<HI>Arts</HI> from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and thought it so
necessary, tho' in a much warmer Climate,
than ours of <HI>England,</HI> that they founded a
great Part of the Cure of Distempers, as well
as the preservative Means of Health, upon it,
in its various Degrees and Kinds. Those
who are curious may find all the Learning
of the Antients, collected to entertain them
on this Subject, with the best Reasons and
Philosophy of the Times; and the Account
of the Origin of new Diseases among the
<HI>Romans,</HI> by <HI>H. Mercurialis,</HI> in his Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
<HI>de Arte Gymnastica,</HI> in which every thing
useful, ingenious, or that has been invented
for this Purpose, is brought together. <HI>Sy∣denham,</HI>
our Countryman, has enlarged in
its Praises, as one of the most sovereign Re∣medies
hitherto known; and mentions seve∣ral
Instances of its wonderful Success, and
of its conquering the several Effects of <HI>Ner∣vous</HI>
Distempers by long and constant Jour∣nies
on Horseback. <HI>Fuller de Arte Gym∣nastica,</HI>
has done what he could, to en∣courage
and explain it. Many others of
the best of the Moderns, have given it
its due Commendation: But it is not my
Business to collect Authorities, for a thing
<PB N="177" REF="213"/>
so universally<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We must sometimes force the Timorous from their Beds, and rouse the Lazy and Sluggish. <HI>Hippoc. Epidem.</HI> lib. 6.</NOTE> acknowledged, and so little
disputed. As to my own Experience, I
never saw any thing done to the Purpose,
in Nervous Cases, or with a Success com∣plete,
and subsisting for any long time with∣out
the Assistance of these two, <HI>Diet</HI> and
<HI>Exercise.</HI> I have even found the Necessity
of adding to these, in some Cases, to make
the Recovery durable and solid, Change of
a thicker Air and of a colder Climate, to
that of a <HI>warmer Sun</HI> and <HI>purer</HI> Air; which
have seldom ever failed, when any thing
would succeed. But that not being in every
one's Power, they must be contented with
using the Means they can find within their
Reach. The Benefit and absolute Necessity
of a pure, fragrant, fresh Air, and the Balm,
Nitre, or Acid of it, both to Health and
Life, are demonstrably proved from the Ex∣periments
of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Bryan Robinson,</HI> both in the Vege∣table
and Animal Kingdom.</P>
<P>§ IV. THO' Experience, which extreme∣ly
confirms the Benefit of this Remedy, is
the only solid Foundation to go upon, in
the Cure of Distempers, yet the Reason of
the thing speaks so loudly, that it cannot
<PB N="178" REF="214"/>
but be hearken'd to by every reasonable
Person. As <HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>proper Medicines,</HI> in
due Time, will certainly rectify the <HI>Juices,</HI>
so Labour and Exercise will most infallibly
strengthen the Solids, by promoting and
continuing their constant Action and Mo∣tions.
It is much like the constant Buckling
of Hair, (I mean as to its Vertue and Effi∣cacy,
however different the <HI>Mechanicks</HI> of
these Effects may be) or keeping it for some
time fixed in a certain Position, to give the
internal Parts new <HI>Contacts</HI> and <HI>Cohesions,</HI>
and to confirm and settle them in these,
which makes them retain the Form and Fi∣gure
we design. 'Tis true, it is very hard,
if not impossible to give a strong and lasting
Union and Cohesion to the weak, disjoined,
and discontinued <HI>Fibres</HI> of People of weak
and relaxed Solids; but <HI>Exercise</HI> constantly
continued does this (and will do it always)
as much as the Nature of Things will admit
of. There is an <HI>innate</HI> Power of <HI>Contrac∣tion,</HI>
a <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Elasticity</HI> in all Animal
Solids, as being contrived and designed a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Instruments of Action and Motion; by Ac∣tion
and Motion only, this innate Power i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
nourished, preserved, increased, and reco∣vered.
And on the contrary, without them
it grows languid, feeble, and weak. No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
only is the Circulation promoted, the Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣spiration
and all the other Secretions for
warded by <HI>Exercise;</HI> but by the <HI>Muscul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="179" REF="215"/>
Actions, the Blood and Juices are kept in a
due State of Fluidity, their Viscidity broken
and dissolved, and all Obstructions hindered
or removed. There seems likewise, as it
were, new Particles to be forced by this
Action, into the Interstices and Ruptures of
the Solids, to knit and solder them, and re∣cover
their lost Union, Cohesion, and Spring:
So that <HI>Exercise</HI> seems the only, at least,
the sovereign Remedy, in relaxed and
weakened Solids. And as a low, light, and
temperate Diet is necessary, and the best
means of diluting and sweetening the Juices:
and as at the same Time, it sometimes
weakens and relaxes the Solids, so <HI>Exercise</HI>
is more eminently useful in that Case, to
keep up the due Force and Strength of the
<HI>Fibres,</HI> else the Patient can never receive the
full Benefit of such a <HI>Diet.</HI> All those in a
<HI>low Diet,</HI> who have long preserved them∣selves
in any Degree of Force and Spirits,
have been constantly great Followers of Exer∣cise,
without which, even their <HI>low Diet</HI> would
not have been so beneficial, especially after
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life, when there is little
Hopes of an <HI>adventitious Force.</HI> And one
Reason why <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>Hysterical</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersons relapse so frequently, after having
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een so wonderfully recovered by the Force
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>Diet, Exercise,</HI> and Change of Air, is,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecause they either intermit their <HI>Regimen of
Diet,</HI> their <HI>Exercise,</HI> or perhaps both: and
<PB N="180" REF="216"/>
therefore he who, under <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders
and Complaints, would continue tolerably
well after he is got better, must continue
both his <HI>Regimen of Diet,</HI> and his <HI>Exercise,</HI>
in some certain Degree ever after. It is
true, <HI>Diet</HI> will do infinitely more than Ex∣ercise,
and have more lasting Effects, but
both should be joined.</P>
<P>§ V. It is of no great Consequence of
what Sort or Kind the <HI>Exercise</HI> be, provided
it be but <HI>Bodily Exercise</HI> and Action; cer∣tainly
<HI>riding</HI> on Horse-back is the best of all,
because of the almost erect Posture, the
lesser Weariness, and the more universal
and natural Motion of all the Organs, with
the constant Change of Air: and that the lower
Regions of the Body, and the alimentary
Instruments and <HI>Hypochondres</HI> are thereby
most shaken and exercised. Next to that, is
riding in a <HI>Chaise</HI> or <HI>Chariot. Walking,</HI> tho'
it will answer the same End and Purpose as
well as any, and may be more readily and
easily used, because it may be equally fol∣lowed
within Doors and without, in Winter
as well as Summer, yet it is more laborious
and tiresome. Next to these are the active
Games and Sports, such as <HI>Hunting, Shoot∣ing,
Bowls, Billiards, Shuttle-cock,</HI> and the
like. I have known those who have exer∣cised
themselves by strongly working their
Arms backward and forward; and some
<PB N="181" REF="217"/>
have used Weights for that Purpose, swing∣ing
and shaking them in their Hands. And
some have done it with a <HI>Cane,</HI> rubbing
it strongly over the whole Muscles of the
Body and Limbs. The <HI>Flesh-Brush</HI> has
supplied those who could not afford, or
were not able to use any other Kind of
<HI>Exercise.</HI> But certainly the best of all is,
where <HI>Amusement</HI> or <HI>Entertainment</HI> of the
Mind is joined with Bodily Labour, and con∣stant
Change of Air, as in <HI>Hunting, Bowls,
Billiards,</HI> and the like, and riding Journies
about Business: For the Entertainment of
the Mind, and keeping it agreeably diverted
from reflecting on its Misfortunes or Misery,
makes Exercise infinitely more beneficial, as
<HI>Thoughtfulness, Anxiety,</HI> and <HI>Concern</HI> render
it quite useless.</P>
<P>§ VI. IT is upon this Account that I
would earnestly recommend to all those af∣flicted
with <HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers, always to
have some innocent entertaining <HI>Amusement</HI>
to employ themselves in, for the Rest
of the Day, after they have employed a
sufficient time upon <HI>Exercise,</HI> towards the
Evening, to prepare them for their Night's
quiet Rest. It seems to me absolutely im∣possible,
without such a Help, to keep the
Mind easy, and prevent its wearing out the
Body, as the Sword does the Scabbard; it
is no matter what it is, provided it be but a
<PB N="182" REF="218"/>
<HI>Hobby-Horse,</HI> and an Amusement, and stop
the Current of Reflexion and intense Think∣ing,
which Persons of weak Nerves are
aptest to run into. The common Division
of Mankind, into <HI>Quick Thinkers, Slow
Thinkers,</HI> and <HI>No Thinkers,</HI> is not without
Foundation in Nature and true Philosophy.
Persons of slender and weak Nerves are ge∣nerally
of the first Class: the Activity, Mo∣bility,
and Delicacy of their intellectual Or∣gans
make them so, and thereby weakens
and relaxes the <HI>Material Organs</HI> of the in∣tellectual
Faculties; and therefore ingenious
Flattering, easy and agreeable Amusements,
and Intervals of No-thinking and <HI>Swiss-Me∣ditation,</HI>
(as it is maliciously called) is as
necessary for such, as Sleep to the Weary, or
Meat to the Hungry, else the Spring will
break, and the Sword wear out the Scabbard.
<HI>Study</HI> of difficult and intricate Matters will
infallibly do Hurt. <HI>Reading</HI> must be light,
entertaining, and diverting, as well as Food.
<HI>Conversation</HI> must be easy and agreeable,
without Disputes or Contradiction. The
<HI>Diversion</HI> innocent and inexpensive, else the
Remorse and Reflexion afterwards will do
infinitely more Prejudice than the present
<HI>Amusement</HI> can recompense; and it must
end at seasonable Hours, without leaving a
<HI>Hurry</HI> and <HI>Fatigue</HI> upon the Spirits of the
Patient. To determine absolutely the Kinds
and Quantities of the <HI>Exercise, Amusement,</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="219"/>
or even <HI>Diet,</HI> or the Times most proper for
such, is impossible to any but the <HI>Patient</HI>
himself. In the general, I shall only say,
that as <HI>Nervous Distempers</HI> and <HI>Old Age</HI> re∣duce
Men to the Weakness, the Tenderness,
and Delicacy of Children, or very young
Persons, they must be treated, and treat
themselves as such, 'till Strength and a per∣fect
Recovery come, if ever they are so
lucky as to arrive at it, much in the same
way, as a Child must be treated in his <HI>Non∣age,</HI>
till he arives at Manhood.</P>

<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some of the more Immediate and
Eminent Causes of Nervous Dis∣tempers.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. I NEVER saw any Person labour
under severe, obstinate, and strong
<HI>Nervous</HI> Complaints, but I always
found at last, the <HI>Stomach, Guts, Liver, Spleen,
Mesentery,</HI> or some of the great and neces∣sary
Organs or <HI>Glands</HI> of the lower Belly
were obstructed, knotted, schirrous, or
<PB N="184" REF="220"/>
spoil'd, and perhaps all these together; and
it may be very justly affirmed, that no habi∣tual
and grievous, or great <HI>Nervous</HI> Disor∣ders,
ever happened to any one who la∣boured
not under some real <HI>Glandular</HI> Dis∣temper,
either <HI>scrophulous</HI> or <HI>scorbutical,</HI>
original or acquired. So that in general,
great Nervous Disorders may justly and pro∣perly
be termed <HI>Glandular.</HI> The Stomach is
often the first and principal Organ (or at
least by Consent and Consequence) in the
Fault: Either it is too thin and weak by
Nature, or the inner <HI>villous</HI> Membrane is
worn off by Luxury, so that it cannot con∣tract
close enough to embrace the Food; or
it is become too soft, flabby, and relaxed,
so that it cannot, with sufficient Spring,
squeeze its Contents; or its <HI>Glands</HI> are grow∣ing
<HI>schirrous, hard,</HI> and <HI>knotted,</HI> so that its
Action is weak and languid, and interrupted,
or <HI>lastly,</HI> there may actually be a discovera∣ble
<HI>Imposthume, Schirrosity,</HI> or <HI>Cancer</HI> al∣ready
extant in it. And hence the Neces∣sity
of frequent, but gentle Vomits (at least
in all these Cases but the last) to empty
these weak <HI>Glands,</HI> when full of indigested
<HI>Flegm, Wind,</HI> or <HI>Choler,</HI> in such <HI>Nervous</HI>
Cases, and a thin, light, cool, and balmy
<HI>Diet,</HI> proportioned to the Weakness and In∣firmities
of the Stomach and Solids (to give
it the least Labour, and most Rest possible,
as we cure broken Bones, by using them
<PB N="185" REF="221"/>
little) as well as to cut off the Sources of
more Infection in them all, without Excep∣tion.</P>
<P>§ II. A VITIOUS <HI>Liver</HI> seems to be one of
the primary and immediate Causes of <HI>Nervous</HI>
Distempers. I never once in my Life saw
an <HI>Hysteric</HI> or <HI>Hypochondriac</HI> Case, of a deep
Nature, or extreme Degree, in strong Per∣sons
especially, where the <HI>Liver,</HI> and it's
Appendages were not eminently faulty,
either by a praeternatural <HI>Size, Tumefaction,
Obstruction,</HI> or <HI>Schirrosity;</HI> and when by
<HI>ponderous,</HI> alterative, active Medicines, join'd
with a cool thin Diet, the Obstructions have
been opened, the <HI>Gall Bladder</HI> and <HI>Porus
Biliarius</HI> pervious, then, either <HI>green, yellow,</HI>
or <HI>black Choler</HI> has poured out abundantly
into the Stomach. The <HI>Liver</HI> is the <HI>Organ</HI>
designed by Nature (or, at least, Nature
makes Use of it) to suck out, draw off, and
convey into the common <HI>Shore</HI> of the Body
(the <HI>Guts</HI>) all the Poison, Malignity, and
destructive Part of high rank Foods, and too
great a Quantity of rich Liquors, taken into
the Habit. This wise and bountiful Con∣trivance
of Nature becomes an <HI>Antidote,</HI> or
is a Receptacle (for some time) for the de∣structive
Effects of <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Intemperance.</HI>
And hence it comes to pass that gluttonous
and voluptuous Animals, whether <HI>Brutal</HI> or
<HI>Rational,</HI> have always overgrown <HI>Livers,</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="222"/>
and accordingly among the <HI>Romans,</HI> those
Animals whose <HI>Livers</HI> were delicious, had
their whole Entrails almost turned into <HI>Liver,</HI>
by unnaturally cramming them with high
and generous Foods; and no plentiful and
<HI>full Feeder</HI> was ever opened, but he was
found with some gross Fault in his <HI>Liver▪</HI>
It has indeed a noble and indispensible Use
in all Animals (the human more especially)
who live on Animal Foods and fermented
Liquors, even beyond any Organ of the
Body, next to the <HI>Heart, Brain,</HI> and <HI>Lungs:</HI>
for it not only sucks out all the Venom, as
it were, of the whole Mass of Blood, and
carries it into the Guts (<HI>the common Shore,</HI>
to be thence carried out of the Habit in
Part) but there also the <HI>Bile,</HI> by its natural
Acrimony and Stimulation, is the great
Spring and Cause of the <HI>Peristaltic</HI> Motion:
(that Function so necessary to Digestion and
throwing off the Redundancy and Fecu∣lence);
besides that it unites, by its <HI>soapy</HI>
Nature, the various Particles of which the
<HI>Chile</HI> is compounded, and renders it a <HI>similar</HI>
and <HI>uniform</HI> Fluid: and by its Bitterness, and
this <HI>Saponaceous</HI> Quality, it cleanses and
scowers the Mouths of the small and delicate
<HI>Lacteal Tubes,</HI> from their Obstructions and
Filth. But as all good Things, perverted
and abused, have Pains and Punishments an∣nexed
to them, in Proportion to their Ad∣vantages
and Benefits, so the <HI>Liver,</HI> when
<PB N="187" REF="223"/>
praeternaturally large, tumified, obstructed,
or <HI>schirrous,</HI> becomes the Cause of the most
terrible and frightful Miseries incident to
human Nature; from hence generally and
chiefly spring all our horrible and dire <HI>Hy∣sterics</HI>
and <HI>Hypochondriacs,</HI> our <HI>Epilepsies,
Apoplexies,</HI> and our <HI>Manias,</HI> our <HI>Cholicks,
Scurvies, Gouts, Jaundices, Hot Ulcers, &amp;c.</HI>
and were there any. Art or Medicine to turn
or make <HI>Choler (Adust, Black, Yellow,</HI> or
<HI>Green</HI>) an innocent, acid, active Liquor only
(as it is in the Animals that live only on
Vegetables) it would infallibly cure these
Disorders; but I believe there is none, nor
can be any such Art or Medicine, consider∣ing
the established Laws of Nature, and
those of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy:</HI> but the pon∣derous
Remedies which open Obstructions
(such as Preparations of <HI>Antimony</HI> and <HI>Mer∣cury</HI>)
gentle <HI>Emeticks,</HI> which pump up the
peccant Humour as it flows (for <HI>Catharticks</HI>
do little or nothing in such Cases, it being
impossible to carry forcibly vitiated <HI>Choler</HI>
so great a Length without Violence to Na∣ture,
besides that all Kind of Purges pass
through this gross Fluid, when vitiated, and
leave it much as they found it) and a thin,
mild Diet, that cuts off the Sources of the
Evil. What is here said of the <HI>Liver,</HI> may
be readily applied to the <HI>Spleen,</HI> in a certain
Degree, and therefore 'tis needless to add
any more of either.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="224"/>
§ III. THE <HI>Glands</HI> of the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> or
of the <HI>Guts,</HI> being knotted or obstructed, are
less obvious by any other Symptoms, than
these of a general <HI>Weakness, Thinness</HI> of
Habit, a Tendence to <HI>Hectical</HI> Heats after
Meals, and especially an Inappetence and
Weakness of Digestion, Faintings, cold
Sweats, Lowness of Spirits, and Oppressions,
and the other <HI>Nervous</HI> Complaints to be de∣scribed,
those particularly of thin and <HI>vale∣tudinary</HI>
Persons. And those who continue
weak, thin, and valetudinary, after Youth∣hood
is over, are much to be suspected of
<HI>knotted Glands</HI> in the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> which ob∣struct
and hinder the free and easy Passage of
the <HI>Chyle</HI> thro' the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> whose common
<HI>Bason</HI> is in, and most general Course is thro'
that <HI>Membrane;</HI> or of <HI>knotted Guts,</HI> and
their obstructed Valves, which hinder the
free Play of the <HI>Peristaltick</HI> Motion, so ne∣cessary
towards the Progress of the Digestion,
and the Expulsion of the Feculence; and all
these more immediate Causes of <HI>Nervous</HI> Dis∣tempers
shew the Necessity, Expedience,
and Benefit of ponderous Remedies, in the
Beginning of a Cure: gentle Evacuations
upwards or downwards, in the Process; and
mild Astringents and Strengtheners to finish
it; and an universal thin and low Diet in the
whole Progress, and for future Preservation.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="225"/>
§ IV. IT is very possible, neither the
<HI>ponderous</HI> Remedies, nor the Evacuations
may dissolve, or even much soften knotted,
<HI>schirrous,</HI> or obstructed <HI>Glands</HI> in any Part
of the Habit; but a cool, thin, soft, <HI>bal∣samick
Diet</HI> will always make the Juices cir∣culate
easy, and without Rubs and Resist∣ance;
as a clear, thin, equable Stream of
running Water will glide gently and calmly
by the Sides of <HI>implanted Islands:</HI> and these
<HI>Knots</HI> and <HI>Tubercles</HI> may thereby lie as easily
and quietly in the Body, as the Nails on our
Fingers and Toes, or as Bones surrounded
with Muscles; and we know sweet thin
Blood will make its way into the Circula∣tion,
through the lateral Branches, when the
Trunk of the Artery is cut through: and
that is all <HI>Art</HI> can do, or the Laws of the
Animal <HI>Oeconomy</HI> will admit. And it is
highly probable, when any one of these
more immediate Causes of <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders
happen, they are all together in greater or
lesser Degrees. Cutaneous Disorders also,
such as the <HI>Leprosy, Elephantiasis, Impetigo,
Itch, Scurvy,</HI> and <HI>Erisipelas,</HI> have a most
powerful Influence in producing those
violent, inveterate, and high, <HI>Nervous</HI> Dis∣orders.
But the Reason of the violent <HI>Fits</HI>
under them is, that the <HI>Glands</HI> and great
<HI>Viscera</HI> are loaded more than ordinary by
<HI>Debauches, high Diet,</HI> and too great Fulness:
<PB N="190" REF="226"/>
so that the Circulation is thereby hindered and
stop'd, and this makes these cutaneous Foul∣nesses
recoil inwards, for Want of due Force
and Freedom in the Circulation, to press
them out, where they are safest; and none
will be perfectly and safely cured under
them, but by a long Course of the <HI>ponderous</HI>
Medicines, and a thin, cool, soft Diet.</P>
<P>§ V. IT is also possible, that none of all
these mentioned immediate Causes may be
the true one, and yet <HI>Lowness of Spirits,</HI>
Sickness, and even <HI>Fits, Fainting,</HI> and <HI>Con∣vulsions</HI>
may happen: and when there may
be none of these mentioned great Causes, by
particular and special Symptoms to be sus∣pected
or justly supposed, a <HI>Polypus</HI> in the
Heart, or <HI>Great Artery,</HI> or some praeterna∣tural
Formation, <HI>Excrescence,</HI> or <HI>Mal-Forma∣tion,</HI>
in some necessary Organ, may be the
Cause of them; or <HI>lastly,</HI> the Juices may be
so thick, <HI>viscid,</HI> and <HI>glewy,</HI> as may interrupt
the Circulation, and the easy Performance
of the Animal Functions. But as such Cases
are more <HI>rare,</HI> they do not so immediately
come under such general Directions as my
Design must necessarily confine me to, and
can therefore receive here no particular Con∣sideration.
It is, in my Opinion, that it is
here as in the great <HI>Venereal</HI> Cases, where,
if the <HI>Grand Remedy</HI> be sufficiently and
duely pursued, there will be little or no
<PB N="191" REF="227"/>
need of Application to particular and <HI>Topical</HI>
Complaints, which will drop off, and evanish
of themselves, as striking at, and cutting
the Root of a Tree, will render the lopping
of the Branches useless. In all <HI>Chronical,
Cachectical,</HI> and obstinate Cases, I can allow
of, and could never learn or discover, but
<HI>two</HI> universal, certain, and natural <HI>Antidotes,
Remedies,</HI> or <HI>Methods of Cure, viz.</HI> the pon∣derous
and Mineral Medicines (the chief of
which are <HI>Mercury, Antimony,</HI> and <HI>Steel,</HI>
with Evacuations) and <HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Regimen</HI>
(the secondary Assistants of which are <HI>Air</HI>
and <HI>Exercise</HI>) and both skilfully joined to∣gether,
and duty persisted in, is the highest
Pitch <HI>Art</HI> can, in my Judgment, arise to,
under the present Laws of Nature, and of
the <HI>Animal Oeconomy:</HI> the Application, tho'
to particular Cases and Constitutions, will
require the Skill, Address, and Attention of
the most knowing and experienced Physi∣cian.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Spleen, Vapours, Lowness of
Spirits, Hysterical, or Hypochon∣driacal
Disorders.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. THE Title of this Chapter is so
large a Field, that it would re∣quire
a <HI>Volume</HI> of itself, to de∣tail
every thing that may be said, even with
Advantage to the suffering Patient on this
Head. But my Design is not to instruct the
Patient in every Particular, but to give a
general <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders, founded
upon Reason, Philosophy, and Experience;
and it being both absurd and even impossible
for any one to undertake so <HI>obstinate,</HI> so <HI>va∣rious,</HI>
and so <HI>deplorable</HI> a Distemper, of his
own Head in its eminent Degrees, without
the Assistance of a judicious, experienced, and
honest <HI>Physician:</HI> All the Reader, who is not
such, will be able to learn from hence, is,
whether he is treated in the Manner, that such
an one will always deal with his Patients. So
that having said so much, and so fully in
<PB N="193" REF="229"/>
the general Doctrine of <HI>Nervous</HI> Distem∣pers,
I shall have little further to add, but
some Limitations and Conditions with re∣gard
to particular Cases, which I must sup∣pose
applicable only to such individual
Cases by the <HI>Physician</HI> in ordinary.</P>
<P>§ II. ALL the Symptoms and Disorders of
a <HI>splenetick</HI> Person will naturally and readily
be deduced from too thick and glewy or sharp
Juices, some great Bowel spoil'd, or strong
Obstructions form'd, and the regorging Fluids
thereby brought on, struggling and labour∣ing
under the <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> in relaxed
feeble, and unelastick Solids. Perfect Health,
free Spirits, Ease, and Chearfulness consist
in the easy, pleasant, and uniform Perfor∣mance
of the <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> in a full
<HI>Circulation,</HI> free <HI>Perspiration,</HI> and <HI>regular
Secretions.</HI> When by the mentioned Cir∣cumstances,
all these become forced, labour'd,
and uneasy, the Symptoms we commonly
ascribe to the <HI>Spleen,</HI> must necessarily arise:
even tho' they be attended with no really
form'd Disease, or no noble Organ entirely
spoil'd; and the true Reason of the Multi∣plicity,
Variety, and Inconstancy of these
Symptoms, is the vast Multitude of the Com∣binations
possible, of these natural F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ctions,
every one of which makes a new
<HI>Symptom,</HI> and whose uniform, equable Per∣formance
is so necessary to Health.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="230"/>
§ III. THE <HI>Spleen</HI> or <HI>Vapours,</HI> as the
Word is used in <HI>England,</HI> is of so general
and loose a Signification, that it is a common
Subterfuge for meer Ignorance of the Na∣ture
of Distempers. All <HI>Lowness of Spirits,
Swelling of the Stomach, frequent Eructation,
Noise in the Bowels or Ears, frequent Yawn∣ing,
Inappetency, Restlesness, Inquietude,
Fidgeting, Anxiety, Peevishness, Discontent,
Melancholy, Grief, Vexation, Ill-Humour,
Inconstancy, lethargick</HI> or <HI>watchful Disorders,</HI>
in short, every Symptom, not already classed
under some particular limited Distemper, is
called by the general Name of <HI>Spleen</HI> and
<HI>Vapours:</HI> of which there are various and
different Symptoms, according to the dif∣ferent
Constitutions, Tempers of Mind, and
common Diseases, Persons subject to such
Symptoms labour under. In general, <HI>Vapours</HI>
(as it is a Distemper subject to the Rules of
<HI>Art</HI>) are bad, sharp, thick, and viscid Juices,
attended with weak and relaxed <HI>Nerves, Fi∣bres,</HI>
or <HI>Solids:</HI> Where-ever these mentioned
Symptoms are, in any eminent Degree, these
<HI>Conditions</HI> must be. And on the other
Hand, where-ever these <HI>Conditions</HI> are, some
more or fewer of these mentioned Symptoms
must be, according to the Degree of these
Conditions. <HI>Vapours</HI> therefore are either
<HI>original</HI> and simple, or not attended with
any other real Disease or Malady, as yet appa∣rent
<PB N="195" REF="231"/>
(except the Conditions or Causes men∣tioned)
or <HI>Symptomatick,</HI> being caused or
produced by some other real determined Dis∣temper,
which is attended with, or pro∣duces
those mentioned Conditions, of which
Distemper this Kind of <HI>Vapours</HI> is only a
<HI>Symptom</HI> or Effect, and in which they al∣ways
terminate in their last Stage or Degree.
From whence it is pretty evident, that this
last Kind of Vapours can never be cured,
unless the original Distemper, on which they
depend, be cured, when it is become ma∣nifest.
It is well known, that every bodily
Distemper is attended with, or produces
Lowness of Spirits, and some others of the
<HI>Symptoms</HI> I have mentioned. When the Dis∣temper
is removed, these Symptoms gradu∣ally
vanish, and <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Freedom of Spi∣rits</HI>
return: So that my present Affair is not
with these <HI>Symptomatick Vapours,</HI> unless they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> too long after the original Distemper
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>moved, and then they are to be treated
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> same manner with these genuine, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and original <HI>Vapours,</HI> whereof I am
treating.</P>
<P>§. IV. To enumerate all the almost in∣finite
Symptoms, Degrees, and Kinds of
<HI>Vapours</HI> is impossible, and perhaps very little
to the Purpose. In general, when the
Symptoms are <HI>many, various, changeable,</HI>
shifting from one Place to another, and imi∣tating
<PB N="196" REF="232"/>
the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of almost every other
Distemper described, if they are attended
with no other apparent, real, determined ori∣ginal
Distemper (though they be generally
the Beginnings of a real Distemper, and, if
neglected, terminating in one always.) Then
they may be properly called <HI>Vapours;</HI> for
Distinction's Sake, I will divide them into
three Degrees, though the Reader is neither
here to expect Accuracy nor Certainty, that
may be depended upon, in such a <HI>Proteus∣like</HI>
Distemper, because some of the Symp∣toms
of what I call the <HI>second Degree,</HI> may
happen in the <HI>first,</HI> and so on the contrary;
and though in general they grow and rise
in their <HI>Degrees,</HI> as naturally and gradually
as Plants or Vegetables do, yet we are not
possessed of proper Names and Measures for
these Degrees, any more than we are of the
Degrees of Heat that cause Flame or Light,
it being for Brevity's Sake that I chiefly ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the Distinction.</P>
<P>§. V. THE <HI>first Degree,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
to be called <HI>Vapours</HI> (if that Name be proper
at all) is when the Cause and Disorder is
chiefly confined to the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Bowels,</HI>
or the <HI>Alimentary Ducts,</HI> and the Blood and
Juices are in a pretty tolerable Condition,
but the Solids somewhat relaxed, loose, and
flabby: the <HI>Alimentary Tubes</HI> being the first
sensible Sufferers in all Bodily Maladies
<PB N="197" REF="233"/>
whatsoever. The Symptoms then, besides
Lowness of Spirits, are <HI>Wind, Belching,
Yawning, Heart-burning, Croaking of the
Bowels</HI> (like the Noise of <HI>Frogs</HI>) a <HI>Pain</HI> in
the <HI>Pit of the Stomach</HI> (which is sometimes
mistaken for a Lung Case, especially if at∣tended
with <HI>Shortness of Breath,</HI> and a tick∣ling
Cough, from a Wind in the Cavity
pressing on the Diaphragm, and thereby
pressing on the <HI>Lungs,</HI> which is common,
and goes very justly by the Name of an
<HI>Hysterick,</HI> or <HI>Nervous</HI> Cough) and some∣times
there is an <HI>Inflation,</HI> and an actual vi∣sible
Swelling, to a very considerable Big∣ness,
in the Stomach to be seen, especially
in the <HI>Sex;</HI> a <HI>Coldness</HI> or <HI>Chilliness</HI> upon the
Extremities, and sometimes Flushing (espe∣cially
after a full Meal) and Burning in the
Hands and Feet, <HI>Cold Damp Sweats, Faint∣ings,</HI>
and Sickness (especially before a Solu∣tion
of the Bowels) the Stools being some∣times
very <HI>costive,</HI> sometimes <HI>loose</HI> and slimy,
a <HI>Feeling</HI> like that of <HI>cold Water</HI> poured over
several Parts of the Body, <HI>Head-aches</HI> either
behind or over the Eyes, like a <HI>Puncturation,
Flies</HI> and <HI>Atoms</HI> dancing before the Eyes, a
<HI>Noise</HI> like the <HI>dying</HI> Sounds of Bells, or a
Fall of Water, in the Ears; <HI>Yawning,</HI> and
<HI>Stretching,</HI> and sometimes a Drowsiness or
<HI>Lethargy,</HI> at other times <HI>Watching</HI> and Rest∣lessness,
and several other <HI>Symptoms,</HI> which
it is impossible to enumerate. Some have
<PB N="198" REF="234"/>
but a few of these <HI>Symptoms,</HI> and some all
of them, and a great many more; but a
Tendency to <HI>Spitting, Ptyalism,</HI> or a Dis∣charge
of Phlegm from the Glands of the
Throat, seldom fails to attend all the <HI>Sym∣ptoms</HI>
of it, especially towards the Decline
of the <HI>Fit,</HI> if it is not shut up by a high
Diet, hot Liquors, some constant Drams, or
too great Exercise (which, by the bye, shews
the <HI>Alimentary Tubes,</HI> and their numerous
Glands, the Weakness of the Digestion, or
unnatural cramming, at least, relative or in
Proportion to the Want or Weakness of the
Patient, to be the true Seat and Cause of the
present Symptoms) I have also observed, both
in myself and most of my Patients, one tole∣rable
good Day, and another worse, almost
constantly, following one another regularly:
which suggested a Reason to me, of the
great Benefit of the <HI>Bark</HI> in <HI>Nervous</HI> Distem∣pers:
<HI>Nature</HI> being uniform in her Produc∣tions,
and taking, as it were, a regular and
equal Time to fill, and discharge the turgid
and inflated Cavities and Glands, which is
the general Cause of all <HI>Periods</HI> in Diseases.
I have also observed something like monthly
Periods, especially towards the <HI>Conjunctions</HI>
of the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon.</HI> Those of the great
Seasons, to wit, <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fall,</HI> the <HI>well</HI>
Half of the Year, from Midsummer to Mid∣winter,
and <HI>bad</HI> half from Midwinter to
Midsummer, are more certain and regular,
<PB N="199" REF="235"/>
especially if they are not joined with other
<HI>Chronical</HI> Distempers which alter their <HI>Pe∣riods;</HI>
but in this various and inconstant
Climate, <HI>Periods</HI> and <HI>Crises</HI> are so uncertain
and irregular, that we have nothing but <HI>Mi∣niatures</HI>
and <HI>Models</HI> of them, to what they
were observ'd in <HI>Eastern</HI> Climates, and orderly
People. I only suggest these Things to awaken
the Attention of others, and shew the Uni∣formity
of Nature in all Things.</P>
<P>§ VI. THE <HI>second</HI> Stage of this Distem∣per
is attended with all these Symptoms, in
a much higher and more eminent Degree,
and some new ones, which were not felt,
and consequently not described under the
<HI>first</HI> Stage: such as are instead of Lowness
of Spirits: a deep and fixed <HI>Melancholy, wan∣dering</HI>
and <HI>delusory Images</HI> on the Brain, and
<HI>Instability</HI> and <HI>Unsettledness</HI> in all the intel∣lectual
Operations, <HI>Loss of Memory, Despon∣dency,
Horror</HI> and <HI>Despair,</HI> a <HI>Vertigo, Gid∣diness</HI>
or <HI>Staggering, Vomittings</HI> of <HI>Yellow,
Green,</HI> or <HI>Black Choler:</HI> sometimes unac∣countable
Fits of <HI>Laughing,</HI> apparent <HI>Joy,
Leaping</HI> and <HI>Dancing;</HI> at other Times, of
<HI>Crying, Grief,</HI> and <HI>Anguish;</HI> and these ge∣nerally
terminate in <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> or <HI>Hys∣terical
Fits</HI> (I mean <HI>Convulsive</HI> ones) and
<HI>Faintings,</HI> which leave a Drowsiness, <HI>Le∣thargy,</HI>
and extreme Lowness of Spirits for some
Time afterwards. Perhaps the <HI>Fits</HI> return often,
<PB N="200" REF="236"/>
if they be weak and partial ones; or if they
are strong and severe, their Intervals are
longer: The State of the Blood is generally
viscid (if the Symptoms are not occasioned
by Accident, or spoil'd Bowels) with all the
Consequences which I remarked when I
spoke of what I called the second State of
that Fluid. I think this <HI>second</HI> Degree of
<HI>Vapours</HI> may always be denominated from
<HI>Fits, Convulsions,</HI> or violent <HI>Paroxysms</HI> of
the Kind mentioned: and from the antece∣dent
or subsequent <HI>Bilious,</HI> Vomitings that
attend such; and indeed when they are come
to this Degree, there is generally a beginning
Obstruction, or spoiling of some of the great
Bowels, such as the <HI>Liver,</HI> the <HI>Lungs,</HI> the
<HI>Kidnies,</HI> the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> the <HI>Cawl,</HI> the <HI>Spleen,</HI>
or some other Part necessary towards the
Animal Functions; attending them, and so a
real Distemper immediately follows: of
which, the <HI>first</HI> Degree I have mentioned
is the <HI>first</HI> Step, this last is the <HI>second:</HI> and
if not cured in either of these two, by the
Struggling and Efforts of Nature, joined with
<HI>Art;</HI> the <HI>third</HI> State begins, which is gene∣rally
some <HI>mortal</HI> and incurable Distemper,
such as <HI>Dropsy, Black Jaundice, Consump∣tion,
Palsy, Epilepsy,</HI> or <HI>Apoplexy, &amp;c.</HI> To
make which more plain, let us consider the
Tendency of Nature in its whole Progress,
with this View.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="237"/>
§ VII. WHEN, by <HI>Food</HI> of <HI>ill</HI> Qualities,
or an immoderate Quantity of even whole∣some
<HI>Food,</HI> the <HI>Humours</HI> are vitiated, the
Structure of the <HI>Animal Machine</HI> is such,
that Nature (<HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Mechanism of the Body</HI>)
is presently rouz'd to struggle with all its
Might, to attenuate (or concoct, as we com∣monly
say) the gross and vitious Humours,
and so bring them to an healthy State (<HI>i. e.</HI>
one agreeable to Nature) and drive out, by
the most proper <HI>Outlets</HI> of the Body, what
cannot be reduc'd to that State. This <HI>Struggle</HI>
is the one only proper and real Disease of the
Body, arising from the Habit (for I say no∣thing
of those from external Injuries) the
vast Variety of particular Diseases, spoken of
by <HI>Physicians,</HI> being only so many particular
or various <HI>Issues</HI> of this general Struggle of
Nature. The State of the <HI>Fibres</HI> or <HI>Solids</HI> of
the Body in Strength and Firmness, at the
Beginning, is the Foundation of the grand
Division of Diseases into <HI>acute</HI> and <HI>chronical:</HI>
But, Strength being a relative Thing, it is
impossible to settle precisely the Bounds of
these two <HI>Classes.</HI> When the Conflict itself
is very <HI>hot, brisk</HI> and <HI>eager,</HI> we all agree to
call it a <HI>Fever;</HI> when it is slow and languid,
I know no receiv'd Name for it, but the
Name of <HI>Vapours,</HI> or <HI>Nervous Disorders,</HI> (a
Word us'd in a very indistinct Manner, being
ascrib'd to all or each of the Appearances
<PB N="202" REF="238"/>
that arise in the Progress of this slower Con∣flict.)
It were not amiss to restrain the unde∣termin'd
Meaning of this <HI>Word,</HI> to signify all
the Disorders of Nature under the Conflict
of the Disease when the Solids are weak, as
the Name of <HI>Fever</HI> is appropriated to all the
<HI>Symptoms</HI> that appear during the Conflict, in
a strong State of the <HI>Solids.</HI> This suppos'd,
let us next consider the several Events of this
<HI>Conflict,</HI> which must be either an intire, or a
partial Victory of Nature, or a partial or
total Prevalency of the Disease. The Events
are call'd <HI>Crises,</HI> or Solutions of the Disease,
by <HI>Physicians.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> Sort is <HI>Health,</HI> the
last <HI>Death,</HI> the middle ones are call'd <HI>Dis∣eases;</HI>
of which again there are many Divi∣sions
very different from the two <HI>primary</HI> ones,
to wit, <HI>Vapours</HI> and a <HI>Fever.</HI> For 1<HI>st.</HI> it is
very common for Nature to get an intire
Conquest over the Disease, in a few Days,
when the Solids are strong, that is, for the
<HI>Fever</HI> to end by a <HI>Critical</HI> Discharge, such as
<HI>Sweating,</HI> a <HI>Diursis,</HI> or <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> and the
like; so that there remains nothing but to
recruit the Solids weaken'd in the Struggle.
2<HI>dly.</HI> At other Times when the <HI>Fibres</HI> are
tolerably firm, tho' Nature carries on the
Conflict with Vigour at first, to make a quick
End, yet it is sometimes oblig'd to com∣pound
with the Disease, by giving up a <HI>Pest</HI>
which was not tenable, that is, to throw the
Disease upon some particular <HI>Organ,</HI> and so
<PB N="203" REF="239"/>
the <HI>Fever</HI> terminates in a critical <HI>Abscess,</HI> &amp;c.
3<HI>dly.</HI> When the Solids are so weak, that
Nature carries on the Struggle but faintly for
a long time, without tending to either of
these two mention'd <HI>Crises,</HI> and the morbid
Matter, thro' the Feebleness of the Conflict,
is never sufficiently broken and divided, or
fitted to be carried out of the Habit, by
either of the two mention'd Ways, the Dis∣ease
ends in an universal Weakness and
Feebleness of Nature, a general <HI>Cachexy,</HI> or
a continued bad State of the Juices and re∣lax'd
Solids, if not in <HI>Death</HI> itself; and this
gives Ground for the Distinction between
<HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Acute Fevers.</HI> But <HI>lastly,</HI> if the
Solids are so weak, and the Fluids so bad,
that the Struggle is but very faint, imperfect,
or scarce discernable, at least compared with
the former, the first Attempts and Beginnings
of this Struggle produce those Symptoms
which are properly call'd <HI>Vapours</HI> of the first
Kind: And if proper Means or Remedies be
not used in due Time, they may grow higher
and stronger, with many additional Symptoms
of the same Kind.</P>
<P>§ VIII. From this Deduction, it is evident,
that <HI>Vapours</HI> are the <HI>first</HI> Symptoms of a real
chronical Disease, which, if neglected, will
terminate in spoiling some of the great Bowels,
and so in putting a Period to Animal Life.
Some may be born with such a Constitution;
<PB N="204" REF="240"/>
but if by no Mismanagement they increase or
exasperate these <HI>Symptoms,</HI> Nature may thus
go on to its common Period, as well as an
Animal may with a broken or wasted Limb:
But neglecting the Means, or fuelling the
Disease by a <HI>Mal-Regimen,</HI> it will certainly
terminate sooner or later in those real Dis∣tempers,
which have Names and Determi∣nations,
such as a <HI>Dropsy, Asthma,</HI> or <HI>Con∣sumption,</HI>
and so may be attended with the
Symptoms that these mortal Distempers are
described by, and at last end in <HI>Death.</HI> So
that it is needless to enumerate the <HI>Symptoms</HI>
of this <HI>Stage,</HI> they being commonly known
and described by the <HI>Physicians,</HI> that treat of
such mortal Distempers, for being irreme∣diable,
as they are in <HI>this</HI> Stage; they admit
of nothing but a <HI>palliative</HI> Cure, to make the
Symptoms easy; which how it is to be done,
I shall shew in the next <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Cure of the Symptoms of Vapours
Hysterical and Hypochondriacal Dis∣orders.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. WHAT I have formerly said
about the general Cure of
<HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers by a <HI>Re∣gimen
of Diet, Exercise,</HI> and the three Classes
of Medicines mentioned, is not only the
solid Foundation of a substantial and lasting
Cure, but is also the most effectual Means
for weakning the Symptoms, and making their
Intervals longer, and without which all the
other Attempts for that Purpose will be in∣effectual,
at least procure only temporary
Relief, since these Symptoms will return more
frequently, and with greater Violence, as
the State of the Fluids and Solids grow
worse, which they must necessarily do, under
a Neglect of these Means, alone sufficient to
establish a solid and perfect Cure. So that
they who would effectually relieve or lessen
the Symptoms of <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders, have
<PB N="206" REF="242"/>
nothing more to do, but to accommodate
these general Directions to particular Consti∣tutions
and Circumstances. But because,
while this general Cure is going forward, the
Symptoms may be so <HI>dispiriting</HI> and <HI>painful,</HI>
that Life becomes an useless Burthen, it is
absolutely necessary by all means possible,
to gain a <HI>Reprieve,</HI> from these Symptoms, if
not for a long Time, at least for as long a
Time as can be, to give Room for these uni∣versal
Means to operate.</P>
<P>§ II. I know not in Nature a more uni∣versal
and effectual Remedy for most, if
not all the Symptoms of these Disorders when
they rise to any high Degree, than gentle
<HI>Vomits</HI> suited to the Strength and Constitution
of the Patient, not only as they discharge the
<HI>Choler,</HI> or <HI>Bile,</HI> and <HI>Phlegm</HI> from the <HI>Liver</HI>
and <HI>Alimentary Ducts,</HI> but as by their <HI>Succus∣sions</HI>
and Action, they open the Obstructions
of that vast Number of <HI>Glands</HI> situated in the
inner Side of these Ducts (which too are
either the Cause of, or certainly attend most
of the violent <HI>Nervous</HI> Symptoms) and pro∣mote
the Circulation and Perspiration. These
<HI>Vomits,</HI> in weak Persons, may be effected by
a Decoction or Tea of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rduus, Chamomik
Flowers, Horse Radish,</HI> or any bitter or
acrid Plant, or by <HI>Ipecacuanha</HI> or its Tin∣cture
alone; but in the stronger Constitutions
nothing is to be depended on without join∣ing
<PB N="207" REF="243"/>
some Preparation of Antimony. I never
found either in my own Case, or my Practice
on others, that I could so quickly and effe∣ctually
relieve either violent Paroxysms of
<HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers, or the other sinking
Symptoms attending them, as by such an
Evacuation; and I have been always forc'd
to repeat it as often as these Symptoms re∣turn'd,
till the Distemper was quite overcome.
I have extremely reliev'd some, and have
totally cured others by every Morning drink∣ing
large Draughts of <HI>Chamomile</HI> Flower
Tea, to throw off the Flegm, and then
drinking <HI>Bath</HI> Waters after the Stomach was
settled, and pursuing a <HI>Regimen</HI> and <HI>Exer∣cise</HI>
in the Day-time. Those who are young
land strong, and to whom these Symptoms
are not become habitual, and whose Consti∣tution
is yet sound, and not loaded with
gross Humours, may sometimes get them off
at a lesser Expence, as by frequent Doses of
<HI>Hiera Picra, Tincture</HI> of <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> the <HI>Ruffi</HI>
or the <HI>Stomach</HI> Pills, but chiefly the <HI>Pilul.
Gummos cum Aloe-lota,</HI> in equal Quantities,
frequently, if not every Night, repeated, or as
Occasion requires. I have never found any
great Relief from Blisters, Issues, or even
Bleeding itself, in this Case, unless it was in
very full Habits, or when premis'd to a general
Course for the Cure, because the <HI>Cachexy</HI>
was universal; much less is any thing to be
expected from lying a-bed and sweating
<PB N="208" REF="244"/>
(a late celebrated Method in the Cure of
<HI>Vapours</HI>) which I have always found to relax
much more.</P>
<P>§ III. RESTLESSNESS, <HI>Inquietude</HI> of
Spirits, and Want of natural <HI>Sleep</HI> is one of
the most troublesome and dispiriting Symp∣toms
attending this Distemper. When it is
extreme, nothing is to be done without <HI>Lau∣danum</HI>
or <HI>Opiates,</HI> but these ought always to
be blended with some small Proportion of
the <HI>Volatile</HI> and <HI>Aromatick</HI> Medicines, which
encrease their benign, and possibly may
hinder their destructive Effects, if they have
any; however Recourse is never to be had
to them, but in extreme Cases, and when
other Things will not do, because of their
<HI>deleterious</HI> Effects on the Solids, which very
possibly they may relax more and more.
There are some with whom doubtlessly
<HI>Opiates</HI> agree much better than others; and
they are such, I think, whose Solids are yet
pretty firm, and where the Fluids are most
in Fault, or some of the great Bowels only
weakened. There are others, to whom they
give a little <HI>dosing</HI> or dead Sleep, yet when
their Force is worn off, they leave a <HI>Lowness,
Dispiritedness,</HI> and <HI>Anxiety,</HI> that even over∣balances
the Relief or Quiet they bring; and
they are those who are entirely <HI>Cachectick,</HI>
as well as subject to <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders, such
I should persuade to use <HI>Assa-foetida</HI> in Pills,
<PB N="209" REF="245"/>
Morning and Night, or the <HI>Gum Pills</HI> of the
<HI>London</HI> or <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Dispensatory (both
which are excellent Medicines for this Pur∣pose)
they having often all the good Ef∣fects
of <HI>Opium,</HI> without the bad ones, tho'
both are but temporary <HI>Reliefs</HI> and not
<HI>Cures:</HI> and whose Virtues will be worn out
by long Use, and therefore ought to be con∣tinued
no longer than absolute Necessity re∣quires,
and not repeated upon too slight
Occasions, for both <HI>Opiates</HI> and <HI>Volatiles</HI> or
<HI>Foetids</HI> are of the Nature of <HI>Drams</HI> and <HI>Cor∣dialss;</HI>
and Exercise will procure Sleep better
than either of these Medicines, no <HI>Opiate</HI>
being like that of the <HI>Day-Labourers.</HI></P>
<P>§ III. MEER Lowness and Dispiritedness,
not attended with Sickness or Pain, arises
from the Want of a brisk <HI>Circulation</HI> and
<HI>Perspiration.</HI> These will always be pro∣moted
by <HI>volatile Spirits,</HI> an <HI>Aromatick Cor∣dial,</HI>
and generous Wines, or any thing that
will <HI>stimulate, rouze,</HI> and <HI>spur</HI> the dead and
languishing Solids, to push forwards the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luggish <HI>Circulation</HI> and <HI>Perspiration;</HI> but
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Force of these Remedies, like all other
Helps and Reliefs of this Nature, is soon
spent and worn out; and they will often
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eave the same Effects with <HI>Opiates,</HI> the Na∣ture
of which they partake: and therefore,
nothing is to be expected from them, but as a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resent <HI>Relief</HI> in Extremities, nor are they to
<PB N="210" REF="246"/>
be used but then only. The most solid and
lasting Relief I ever found, for Lowness
of Spirits, comes from the astringent Class of
Medicines, <HI>Steel, Bark, Japan Earth, &amp;c.</HI>
with <HI>Mineral</HI> and <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Waters, the <HI>Bath</HI>
especially, in the temperate and cold Seasons,
and the <HI>cold Steel Waters,</HI> as <HI>Spaw, Pyrmont,</HI>
or <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in the hot Weather; but
where none of these Waters can be had,
from the Necessity of the Patient's Circum∣stances,
<HI>Steel Rust</HI> with the <HI>Extract</HI> or <HI>Pow∣der</HI>
of the <HI>Quinquina, Pulvis ad Guttetam,
&amp;c.</HI> joined with Aromaticks, such as the
<HI>Species Diambrae,</HI> and wash'd down with an
agreeable Bitter, fitted to the Patient's
Strength and Constitution: <HI>Elixir of Vitriol,</HI>
or <HI>Tincture of Steel,</HI> with <HI>Elixir Proprietatis</HI>
in common Water; these will in a great
measure supply the Want of <HI>Mineral Waters,</HI>
and give a due <HI>Reprieve,</HI> to carry on the Cure,
which is only to be attained by the general
Methods already described, without which
nothing effectual is to be done, nor the Re∣turn
of these Disorders prevented; and in∣deed
the <HI>Paroxysms</HI> of this Distemper, when
deep rooted, are so many or so frequent, and
the general Methods require so long Time,
that all these Medicines, and <HI>Mineral Waters</HI>
also, will be wanted in their Turns.</P>
<P>§ IV. ONE of the most <HI>dispiriting</HI> Symp∣toms
of this Distemper, and one of the most
<PB N="211" REF="247"/>
certain Signs of it, is a frequent Discharge
of thin, limpid, pale Water, by <HI>Urine:</HI>
which, when in great Quantities, and fre∣quently
discharged, does so sink and dispirit
the poor Patient, that Life is insupportable,
at least, if he is not otherwise strong and
hearty. Some, to explain this Appearance,
have run into I don't know what <HI>Fusion</HI> of the
Blood, and <HI>Relaxation</HI> of the Glands of the
<HI>Kidneys.</HI> But having now done with <HI>Theory,</HI>
I shall say nothing directly to confute this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bsurd <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> it being, I think, pretty
evident, and confirmed by many Experi∣ments,
especially those of <HI>Sanctorius</HI> and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. <HI>Keil,</HI> that it is principally owing to a
partial or total Obstruction of the <HI>Perspi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation,</HI>
which is so common in this Case,
from the Weakness of the <HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Solids:</HI>
and that consequently nothing else can possi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly
cure its returning Fits, or remove it,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut what makes the <HI>Perspiration</HI> good: and
accordingly this Symptom is always relieved
by those of the <HI>warm, cordial,</HI> and <HI>diapho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tick</HI>
Kind, such as <HI>Gascoign Powder, Spe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es
Diambrae, Aromaticum Gariophyllatum,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onfectio Alkermes, Diascordium, Venice
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eacle, Sir Walter Raleigh's Cordial,</HI> and
the like, or by a Combination of these, with
<HI>Volatiles</HI> and <HI>foetid Gums,</HI> and appropriated
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uleps;</HI> these Medicines however ought not to
be given, so as to raise an actual <HI>Diaphoresis</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sweating, for that will be to carry on the
<PB N="212" REF="248"/>
Expence, Lowness, and Sinking by other
Conduits: but only to procure a little
Breathing or freer <HI>Perspiration,</HI> and to di∣vide
the Evacuation more equally through the
whole Habit.</P>
<P>§ V. AS to the <HI>Spitting</HI> or <HI>Salivation,</HI> so
common in <HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers (especially
of a <HI>Scorbutick</HI> Origin, as is commonly said)
and cold Diseases, tho' it generally arises
from the same Causes, and may be relieved
by the same Medicines, as the Symptom last
mentioned, yet since it is generally a critical
Discharge, or follows some Excess in the
Diet or Nourishment, it ought never to be
stopped at first by astringent or warm Medi∣cines,
no more than a critical <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> but
ought rather to be promoted and encouraged
by some gentle <HI>Masticatory</HI> (such as <HI>Mastick,
Pellitory, Tobacco,</HI> or the like) as the Patient
can bear it, or has been accustomed. If it
is exceeding plentiful, with Sickness, Reach∣ing,
and Head-aches, nothing will carry it
off so effectually as a gentle <HI>Vomit,</HI> both as
this will promote the Discharge, and quicken
the <HI>Circulation</HI> and <HI>Perspiration:</HI> or by
gentle Stomach Purges, that may be fre∣quently
repeated, such as <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> the <HI>Sto∣mach
Pills,</HI> and the like. And thus after
this Discharge has been sufficiently carried
off, the Solids may be strengthened with
Astringents, Bitters, or an Infusion of the
<PB N="213" REF="249"/>
<HI>Bark,</HI> with <HI>Aromaticks,</HI> especially if made on
Lime Water; and after that, a Course of
<HI>Chalybeats</HI> and <HI>Aromaticks,</HI> such as I have
mentioned in the former <HI>Section,</HI> with Mine∣ral
Waters of one Kind or another.</P>
<P>§. VI. THERE are some other Symptoms
exceedingly troublesome in <HI>Vapours,</HI> or <HI>Ner∣vous</HI>
Distempers, to wit, <HI>Choaking</HI> and <HI>Gulp∣ing,</HI>
the <HI>Symptomatick Asthma, Swelling of the
Throat and Stomach, Inflation of the Bowels
with Rumbling and Noise.</HI> The <HI>Young</HI> are
not so much troubled with these Symptoms
as the Old and Declining, but they all pro∣ceed
from one Cause, to wit, the Weakness
and Obstruction of the <HI>Perspiration</HI> from the
Imperfection of the <HI>Digestions,</HI> whereby the
insensible Steams and Vapours, which ought
to pass through the Skin freely, are thrown
back into the Cavities of the Body; and
where high and strong Foods are used, these
Steams acquire such an <HI>Acrimony</HI> and Stimu∣lation
as to produce several other more vio∣lent
Symptoms. The Cure of these is the
same with that of the already mentioned
Symptoms, to wit, gentle and repeated <HI>Vo∣mits</HI>
and Stomach <HI>Purges,</HI> especially of the
<HI>Aloetick</HI> Kind (which in <HI>Nervous</HI> Cases are by
far preferable to all other Purgatives, because
of their active astringent Bitter) <HI>Aromaticks,
Bitters,</HI> warm <HI>cordial</HI> Medicines, <HI>Astringents,</HI>
and whatever else will carry off the offend∣ing
<PB N="214" REF="250"/>
Matter, forward the Perspiration, and
strengthen the <HI>Digestion</HI> and <HI>Solids.</HI></P>
<P>§. VII. THERE is a transient Spice of <HI>Va∣pours,</HI>
which very commonly seizes even
young and temperate Persons, otherwise
strong and healthy, of pretty sound Juices
and firm Solids, which affects with a Disgust
of every thing that used to please or amuse
them, a certain <HI>Tediousness of Life,</HI> a <HI>Low∣ness
of Spirits, Restlessness, Heavyness,</HI> and
<HI>Anxiety,</HI> an Aversion to <HI>Exercise,</HI> either of
the Mind or Body, and sometimes with a
violent <HI>Head-ach,</HI> and Dimn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of Sight,
which Symptoms, as they will come on un∣accountably,
without any imaginable or dis∣coverable
Cause, so they will go off as un∣accountably,
in some short Time, without
any Medicine or Means used for their Cure:
tho' in Strictness of Reasoning, they have a
real material Cause, either from Catching of
Cold, and thereby stopping the Perspiration
suddenly, from the Moisture of the Weather,
relaxing the Solids, or from some Intem∣perance
or Excess that they had not heeded,
and were not aware of, or from taking some
Food too hard for their digestive Powers.
The common and ordinary Way of treating
such <HI>transitory Symptoms,</HI> is, the eating next
Meal some salt, savoury, and relishing Deli∣cacy,
and drinking a good large Dose of some
scarce, active, generous, and spirituous Li∣quor,
<PB N="215" REF="251"/>
that may briskly rouse and stimulate
the sluggish and unactive Solids, and rarefy,
warm, and enliven the heavy and dull
Fluids (or, as the Expression is, to give
Nature a <HI>Fillip</HI>) to quicken the Circulation,
forward the Perspiration, and carry on all
the necessary Secretions in their due Degree
and Order. The Fact and Experiment is
undeniable, (and has been too often tried
and repeated, to admit of a Doubt) and
I think the Reason of the Success is pretty
plain from what has been said, and, I am
afraid, has given Occasion to some <HI>un∣philosophical</HI>
and unexperienced Persons to
advise it as a certain and never-failing
Remedy, even in more frequent, deeper, and
more habitual Symptoms of these Disorders:
and I fear has been the Cause of the com∣mon
Advice to Persons of <HI>weak Nerves</HI> and
low Spirits, <HI>to drink a Bottle heartily every
Day,</HI> to take frequent <HI>Drams,</HI> or a <HI>Bowl of
Punch,</HI> and to the Use of <HI>salt Sturgeon, red
Herring, Anchovies, pickled Oysters, Salmon-gundy,
Ham, pickled</HI> and <HI>potted Foods</HI> of all
Kinds, for a <HI>Provocative.</HI> All I shall say on this
Head, is, to caution People not to use this
Cure too frequently, or to expect any great
Feats from it, when such Symptoms grow
stronger, more frequent, or more deeply
rooted in the Constitution, or towards the
<HI>Decline</HI> of Life; for tho' it may give a short
<HI>temporary</HI> Relief, and lash the sluggish and
<PB N="216" REF="252"/>
resty Solids to perform their Functions for a
short Time, yet it will infallibly aggravate
and increase their future <HI>Symptoms,</HI> and at
last render them dangerous and incurable.
The much safer, and even more infallible,
tho' perhaps, less quick Remedy, would
be to take some gentle <HI>Stomach</HI> Purge, that
might not interrupt Business, and, the next
Night, some easy <HI>Diaphoretick,</HI> a lighter
Diet than ordinary, for a few Days, or use
a greater Degree of Exercise, by a Journey,
Hunting, and the like.</P>
<P>§ VIII. THESE are the most material, most
troublesome, and oppressing <HI>Symptoms</HI> of
<HI>Vapours.</HI> Others less material may be re∣duc'd
to these mention'd, or are some Ap∣pendages
of them; or, if omitted here, per∣haps
may be taken Notice of in treating of
the higher Degrees of <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders,
or may be entirely neglected as insignificant.
I have suggested nothing in treating these, but
the common and well known Medicines, not
only because by long Experience, I have found
them the most effectual, but even because
they are common, and universally known
and approved. For it is in <HI>Medicines</HI> as in
<HI>Food</HI> (Medicines being only a more <HI>rare</HI> and
less natural Kind of Food) that which is
<HI>common</HI> to the middling Sort of every Coun∣try,
and which has the Approbation of the
Generality of the Inhabitants, and is suited
<PB N="217" REF="253"/>
to the Constitution of the Community, is
generally the most <HI>beneficial;</HI> since it is the
Experience and Observation of the Gene∣rality
that makes them common: and spe∣cial
or particular Things, or Rarities, are
justly to be suspected.</P>

<P>§ I. AS most of those Disorders which
are commonly called <HI>Nervous,
Hysterical,</HI> or <HI>Hypochondriacal,</HI>
are attended with some <HI>Convulsive</HI> Motions,
<HI>Fits,</HI> or <HI>Paroxysms,</HI> especially when they

which I have denominated or distinguished

treat of these Disorders in general, shewing
<PB N="218" REF="254"/>
the Nature of all <HI>Convulsions,</HI> but particu∣larly
those incident to such Constitutions, and
attending these Distempers that I am princi∣pally
treating of, and laying down the pro∣per
and peculiar Method of Cure, for each
Kind or Degree.</P>
<P>§ II. IT is well known, that whatever
will prick, wound, tear, or violently stimu∣late
the Solids, will thereby produce <HI>Spasms,
Convulsions,</HI> and violent <HI>Contractions,</HI> first
and chiefly in the Part affected: which, by
Consent, and the <HI>Mechanism</HI> of the Parts,
may be communicated further and further
over the whole <HI>Machine;</HI> and, when vehe∣ment
and continu'd, may be propagated
through all the <HI>Limbs, Muscles, Tendons</HI> and
<HI>Membranes</HI> of the Body, and this where-ever
the Wound, or whatever Part of the Solids
the Puncture or Stimulation happens to be
made in; but most readily where there is
the greatest Collection of <HI>Nerves.</HI> This is
evident from the Effects of a Fall, a Blow, a
Bruise, the Puncture of a <HI>Lancet,</HI> a <HI>Thorn,</HI> a
<HI>Pin,</HI> a <HI>Nail,</HI> or any other wounding Instru∣ment,
or from sharp and corroding Steams,
Humours, or Matter (which are as it were a
Collection of small Pins, Needles, Lancets,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>) upon any of the more sensible Solids. I
have before shew'd, that there is in all Ani∣mal
<HI>Fibres</HI> an innate Power of Contraction,
or an original <HI>Mechanism</HI> of <HI>Elasticity</HI> or
<PB N="219" REF="255"/>
<HI>Spring,</HI> by which they exert a natural
Power of Contraction, however they are sti∣mulated
or solicited thereto, whether by the
Command of the Will, (beginning the Mo∣tion
by an inexplicable Effort) or self-motive
Power: or by the Action of some material
appropriated Agent on them, and this in
every <HI>Muscular</HI> as well as <HI>Nervous Fibre</HI> of
the Body. I have seen a <HI>fistulous Tube,</HI> of a
very considerable Length, holding some
Quarts of <HI>Pus</HI> or <HI>Matter,</HI> opening only to∣wards
the Middle of the Back, and passing
down from thence between the Interstices of
the <HI>Muscles,</HI> to the Thigh; which when the
Matter contain'd in it, was arriv'd to its full
Degree of <HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Acrimony,</HI> so as to
produce a <HI>Symptomatick</HI> Fever; the Solids
of the whole Machine, but particularly those
near the <HI>fistulous Canal,</HI> were stimulated and
put in Action, so that it threw out that vast
Quantity of its Contents, upwards and against
the Force of their own Gravity; tho' such a
<HI>Canal</HI> was not made naturally, or with the
greatest Advantage for such an Action: From
whence it is evident, that every Point and
Particle of the <HI>Solids</HI> is <HI>elastick,</HI> and acts for the
Relief of the <HI>Whole.</HI></P>
<P>§ III. THIS being premised, it is evident,
that any acrid, sharp, or corroding Juice,
<HI>Vapour,</HI> or <HI>Steam</HI> that will stimulate and

occasion <HI>Convulsions, Spasms, Gripes</HI> or Pains
on that Part first and chiefly, and may be

Strength) by Contact and Consent, to all
the adjacent Parts, and even thro' the whole

is by such violent Action or Motion worked
off, or removed: in the same Manner as the
<HI>Foetus,</HI> by its Motion or Pressure, raises
those <HI>Throws</HI> and <HI>Convulsions</HI> in the Mother,
that bring it into the World; or as the Stone
or Gravel, stimulating the <HI>Kidnies</HI> or <HI>Ureters,</HI>
raises those Vomitings and Reachings that
promote its Exclusion. Thus <HI>Choler, Wind,
sharp</HI> and <HI>porracious</HI> Juices, occasion those
<HI>Fits</HI> and <HI>Convulsions</HI> in the Bowels (like <HI>Ver∣juice,
Vitriol,</HI> or <HI>Poison</HI> swallow'd down)
being the Struggle of Nature to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrow them
out, which are commonly call'd <HI>Hysterick
Fits;</HI> and thus any <HI>irritating, acrid,</HI> or <HI>sharp</HI>
Humour or Steam, according to the Place
wherein they are lodged, or the Sensibility of
the Part affected, occasions all the various and
different Degrees or Kinds of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Boneti Sepulchret. Anatomii Lib. I. Sect. 12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>Convulsions</HI>
that are common in <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders.</P>
<P>§ IV. As to <HI>Childrens Convulsions,</HI> if they
proceed from the shooting the Teeth, whereby
the <HI>Gums</HI> and their <HI>Membranes</HI> are distended,
<PB N="221" REF="257"/>
torn, and lacerated, they are easily cured by
<HI>Incision;</HI> but if they arise from sharp Juices
in the Stomach or Bowels (as they most
commonly do) and the Child is about the
first Year of its Age, they may be cur'd by
a <HI>Blister</HI> between the Shoulders; gentle <HI>Rhu∣barb</HI>
Purges, frequently repeated; and the
<HI>Testaceous Powders</HI> taken two or three times
a day in a little black Cherry Water or Breast
Milk, but especially by <HI>Cinnabar</HI> in Pow∣ders,
with the <HI>testaceous</HI> Powders and <HI>Rhu∣barb</HI>
interchangeably: Sometimes a few
Drops of <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Hartshorn,</HI> or <HI>Goddards
Drops,</HI> taken two or three times a Day in
common Water, if the Constitution, Juices,
and Solids are pretty sound, will do the
Business. But if their <HI>Fits</HI> be stronger, and
they further advanc'd in Life, they must be
overcome, by gentle <HI>Vomits</HI> fitted to their
Age and Strength. <HI>Cinnabar of Antimony,</HI>
with the <HI>Pulvis ad Guttetam,</HI> and these <HI>Rhu∣barb</HI>
Purges, interchangeably us'd, as has
been said. But it is to be observ'd during
the whole Course, that if the Child is on
the Breast, it ought to be fed with nothing
but its <HI>Nurse</HI>'s <HI>Milk,</HI> or, if wean'd, with
nothing but thin <HI>Pap,</HI> at least till it has
gone over its <HI>Teething;</HI> and, to give a due
Force and Strength afterwards, the <HI>Quin∣quina</HI>
ought to be us'd either in <HI>Extract</HI> or
<HI>Decoction,</HI> especially after it has acquir'd
some Years. This Method will not only
<PB N="222" REF="258"/>
cure their <HI>Fits,</HI> but their <HI>Rickets</HI> likewise,
both proceeding from the same Cause, to wit,
<HI>acrid Humours</HI> lodged in the Stomach or
Bowels, or some other Part of the Body, and
a <HI>Relaxation</HI> of the Solids.</P>
<P>§ V. IF such <HI>Convulsions</HI> happen to the
younger Part of the Sex about a certain
Time of their Lives (as they often do) then
they generally proceed from some Disorder
in that great Affair, which ought, if pos∣sible,
to be set to Rights. But since, before
that can be anyways executed, there gene∣rally
happens a great Quantity of <HI>Choler,</HI>
either generated through the Defect of that
Evacuation, or in whatever other Manner:
or from whatever Cause: this is by all pos∣sible
Means to be first remov'd; which is only
or most readily and effectually to be per∣formed,
by frequent <HI>Vomits</HI> fitted to the
Strength of the Patient, and of the Disease.
While that is doing, the <HI>volatile</HI> active <HI>Gums,</HI>
with the <HI>volatile alcaline Salts,</HI> are to be com∣bin'd
with <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of Antimony in some
Form or other. This Method is to be car∣ried
on till the Fits are weakened, the Quan∣tity
of the <HI>Bile</HI> lessen'd, and the <HI>primae Viae</HI>
pretty clear; and then, and not till then,
will proper <HI>Emmenagogues,</HI> with <HI>Steel, Cha∣lybeat
Mineral Waters, Bitters,</HI> and <HI>Aroma∣ticks</HI>
take Place. In the Fits themselves
there is little to be done but by <HI>Volatiles</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="259"/>
and <HI>Opiates,</HI> in appropriated <HI>Juleps</HI> to lessen
their Violence, and to quiet their <HI>Spasms;</HI>
but by a steady Continuance in this Method,
and a proper <HI>Regimen of Diet,</HI> I scarce ever
saw the Patient miscarry.</P>
<P>§ VI. AS to the <HI>Fits</HI> of grown Persons,
<HI>Hysterical</HI> or <HI>Hypochondriacal,</HI> though they
proceed generally from the general Causes
mention'd, and are to be treated much after
the same Manner, yet they are infinitely
more obstinate and difficult to be remov'd:
the Habit of Body being more deprav'd, and
the Diseases more rooted and confirm'd, thro'
a long Train of <HI>Mismanagement,</HI> and Neglect
of the Means by which Health is to be pre∣serv'd;
and in the higher Degrees of these,
there are commonly some one or other of the
great Bowels (as the <HI>Liver</HI> and its Appendages,
the <HI>Mesentery,</HI> the <HI>Cawl,</HI> the <HI>Spleen</HI> or the
<HI>Stomach</HI>) if not quite spoil'd, yet much
weaken'd and obstructed, and all the <HI>Glands</HI>
stuff'd and render'd useless. To lessen the
Violence of the <HI>Fits,</HI> at least in the first In∣stance,
all the great Evacuations are to be
attempted, especially <HI>Bleeding, Vomiting,
Blisters, Glysters,</HI> and the like; and then
the <HI>Spasms</HI> and <HI>Convulsions</HI> are to be quieted
by <HI>Opiates,</HI> with warm and <HI>volatile</HI> Medicines
and <HI>Foetid Gums,</HI> according to the Strength of
the Patient and the Necessity of the Disease.
If these Evacuations cannot be conveniently
<PB N="224" REF="260"/>
made, or do not soon enough take Effect,
there is nothing else to be done under the
Fits, but by these mention'd <HI>Opiates,</HI> with
the <HI>volatile Gums</HI> and <HI>Salts, Pulvis ad Gut∣tetam,
Aromaticks</HI> and <HI>Alcaline Spirits,</HI> in
proper <HI>Juleps,</HI> till a convenient Interval be
obtain'd, or the Violence of the <HI>Convulsions</HI>
ceases, and then rouzing <HI>Vomits</HI> are to be
thrown down, and after that sharp <HI>Glysters</HI>
(with <HI>Emetick</HI> Wine, and <HI>volatile Spirits</HI> in
them, which will check their further Return
for some time.) This Method is to be re∣peated
as often as these <HI>Paroxysms</HI> return.
During the Intervals <HI>Cinnabarine Medicines,</HI> or
<HI>Aethiops Mineral,</HI> the <HI>Mercurius Dulcis,</HI> or
<HI>Alcalisatus,</HI> with the <HI>volatile Gums</HI> and <HI>Salts,</HI>
are to be taken once or twice a Day, with <HI>Cha∣lybeat</HI>
Waters, and <HI>Aromatick</HI> Bitters, and at
Night the <HI>Gum Pills</HI> compounded with the
<HI>volatile Salts,</HI> the general Method already laid
down, being at the same time regularly pur∣sued.
Which Method and Medicines, if duly
continu'd for a sufficient Time, cannot fail of
Success, if any thing will succeed, and the
Patient not too far advanc'd in Life, or some
of the great <HI>Organs</HI> are not quite spoiled. But
in my Judgment and Observation, the greatest
Stress is to be laid (especially in gross Habits,
or Symptoms produced even by <HI>relative</HI>
Intemperance only) in the Medicinal Way
upon <HI>Vomits</HI> often repeated, <HI>Quinquina Bit∣ters,
Aloetick Purges,</HI> and <HI>Mineral</HI> or <HI>Cha∣lybeat</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="261"/>
Waters; which not succeeding, little
is to be expected from <HI>Art,</HI> the other less
effectual Methods being too weak for such
Cases and Constitutions, and therefore they
must be entirely left to the <HI>Palliative</HI> Re∣medies
of warm <HI>Opiates,</HI> such as <HI>Venice Treacle,</HI>
the <HI>Philonium Romanum,</HI> with high and
strong <HI>Cordial Juleps</HI> and <HI>Volatiles,</HI> such as I
have already mention'd. Those who are of
thinner Habits, and whose Bowels therefore
are not probably so much <HI>stuff'd</HI> and <HI>obstru∣cted,</HI>
will have a fairer Chance, and be
restored with gentler Evacuations, smaller
Doses of <HI>Opiates, volatile,</HI> or <HI>cordial</HI> Medi∣cines,
and more easily recover'd by <HI>Diet,
Air, Exercise, Chalybeat</HI> and <HI>Mineral</HI> Waters,
with <HI>Aromatick</HI> and <HI>Quinquina</HI> Bitters, and
those other Things I have so often men∣tioned.</P>
<P>§ VII. As to the <HI>Fits</HI> attending other
<HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders, as the <HI>Apoplexy, Epilepsy,</HI>
and the like, that Part of them which is <HI>con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulsive,</HI>
depending entirely on the <HI>primary</HI>
Distemper, being the Struggle of Nature to
throw off the peccant Cause, if it were pos∣sible
to separate them, they were to be treated
in the same Manner, and by the same
Medicines: But intending to say something
of them in particular, I shall here pass them
by, and only add, that the several <HI>Forms,
Doses,</HI> and other Circumstances in using these
<PB N="226" REF="262"/>
Medicines, I have already mentioned in the
proper Cases, requires the Attention of the
wisest and most experienced Physician, to
whom these Means and Medicines may be
familiar, and are never to be trusted to any
one not duly and regularly instructed and
educated in these Matters, much less to the
Patient himself, who, let his Knowledge and
even Experience be ever so great, yet under
them, he is not capable to judge for him∣self,
and therefore there will be no Occasion
for being more particular and circumstan∣tial.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Nervous Fevers, Cholicks, Gouts,
Asthma's, Rheumatisms, and other
Distempers denominated Nervous.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. HAVING, I hope, solidly and
justly established the Cause
and Principles, on which the
Differences between <HI>Nervous</HI> and humorous
or inflammatory Disorders (as they are
called) are founded, it will be no difficult<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Matter to apply this general Doctrine to par∣ticular
<PB N="227" REF="263"/>
Distempers, to shew wherein their
true and essential Nature and Difference con∣sists,
and thereby the Solid Intention to be
followed in their particular Cure. For the
only real Difference lies in the Firmness or
Laxity of the Solids; to wit, that these Dis∣tempers
are or ought to be called <HI>Nervous</HI>
only, when they are attended with a loose
and relaxed State of the <HI>Fibres,</HI> which is
chiefly manifested by some few or more of
those Symptoms I have assigned to <HI>Spleen</HI>
and <HI>Vapours.</HI> And on the contrary, that
they are or ought to be deemed humorous,
hot, or inflammatory, when the Solids are
as yet tense and firm, the Symptoms high,
and the State of the Blood inflammatory;
for tho' in both Cases, the great differential
Marks of the Distemper will appear, yet the
Symptoms will be higher and more acute, or
weaker and slower, and will be attended
with some other Appearances, consequent
upon the Strength or Weakness of the Con∣stitution,
tho' in both of them, the same Ma∣terials
should be thrown in, to produce the
Disease, which shews the true Foundation of
the Distinction between the <HI>Strictum</HI> and
<HI>Laxum,</HI> or the strait and loose of the an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient
<HI>Methodists,</HI> and between the <HI>hot</HI> and
<HI>cold</HI> Diseases among the <HI>Moderus.</HI></P>
<P>§ II. ACCORDING to this <HI>Plan</HI> or <HI>Idea,</HI> it
will be easy to determine the Nature and
<PB N="228" REF="264"/>
Constitution of a <HI>Nervous</HI> (or, as it is some∣times
called, <HI>Malignant</HI>) <HI>Fever;</HI> it generally
attacking those of <HI>originally</HI> or <HI>occasionally</HI>
weak Solids or Constitutions, who have for∣merly
had some of the Symptoms and Marks
which I have assigned, in a former <HI>Chapter,</HI>
to belong to weak <HI>Nerves</HI> or <HI>Fibres:</HI> The
Symptoms of such a <HI>Fever</HI> are these follow∣ing;
the <HI>Rigour</HI> and <HI>Chilliness,</HI> tho' not so
strong or violent at first, yet is longer, more
slow and imperceptible; the <HI>Burning Heat</HI>
afterwards is not so intense, nor the <HI>Head∣ach</HI>
and Sickness so great, nor with such
frequent <HI>Vomitings,</HI> but rather a continued
Sickishness; the <HI>Pulse</HI> is neither so quick,
strong, or full, as in the <HI>inflammatory</HI> Kinds,
but small, oppressed, and sometimes inter∣rupted;
the <HI>Sleep</HI> resembles a <HI>Lethargick</HI>
Dosing or Dreaming, with Startings; the
<HI>Water</HI> sometimes crude, commonly <HI>limpid,</HI>
pale, and in great Quantity, without any
great <HI>Sediment</HI> at first; In short, the <HI>Fever</HI>
rather creeps in, than attacks or surprizes,
and the whole Duration of the <HI>Exordium</HI> or
first Stage, is more slow and tedious, than
in acute, inflammatory, or depuratory <HI>Fevers,</HI>
insomuch that it is sometimes six, seven, or
perhaps nine Days before it comes to its
<HI>State,</HI> by which any one may judge of the
<HI>Duration</HI> of the whole (for the sooner a
<HI>Fever</HI> comes to its <HI>State,</HI> the shorter is it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Duration</HI>) and of its Danger, which is always
<PB N="229" REF="265"/>
greater from its Nature, and also because it
is long before Assistance is called, or Means
used, or the latent Enemy discovered; In its
<HI>State</HI> (especially the middle Time of that)
the <HI>Head</HI> is stupid, confused, and incapable,
rather than delirious; the <HI>Tongue</HI> is seldom
<HI>black,</HI> till towards the very End of the
<HI>Fever,</HI> at least, not <HI>parched,</HI> but covered
with a thick, white, or brownish Crust, and
generally moist; the <HI>Thirst</HI> is so far from
being intense, that Drink is scarce called for,
or swallowed with Ardour; the <HI>Breathing</HI>
difficult, with <HI>Glutting, Gulping,</HI> or <HI>Choak∣ing;</HI>
the <HI>Pulse,</HI> tho' quick, yet small and
threedy; the <HI>Water</HI> now sometimes limpid
and much, sometimes <HI>broken</HI> and in small
Quantities, by turns, but never with a gross
or full lateritious Sediment; the <HI>Tendons</HI>
leaping and jumping: and Pulsations from
Flatulency, like what is vulgarly called the
<HI>Life-Blood,</HI> in several Parts of the Body;
and during this whole <HI>Period,</HI> uncertain
Fits of Coldness and Rigour, with succeed∣ing
Glowings, and broken, coldish, faint
Sweats, and constant <HI>Exacerbations</HI> towards
Night, or after Sun-set; the <HI>Belly,</HI> tho'
perhaps it might be open, and tending to∣wards
a <HI>Diarrhoea</HI> at first, becomes now
quite constipate and tumified with Flatu∣lencies;
the <HI>Tip</HI> of the Nose and the Ears
often cold with an <HI>Ichor,</HI> and sometimes an
Ulcer in these last; a careless and unnatural
<PB N="230" REF="266"/>
Posture of the Body, with simple childish
<HI>Gesticulations;</HI> and, by Turns, a <HI>lethargick</HI>
Dosing, or watching <HI>Coma,</HI> with staring
Eyes, or their White turn'd outwards.
This State continues, or grows worse, from
the <HI>fifteenth</HI> to the <HI>twentieth,</HI> or <HI>thirtieth,</HI>
or sometimes the <HI>fortieth</HI> Day, if they live
so long (as generally the Time of the <HI>Crise</HI>
of all Fevers is as long as the <HI>Exordium,</HI> and
the <HI>Duration</HI> of the <HI>State,</HI> is equal to that of
both first and last Periods together). Towards
the End of this <HI>Fever,</HI> they either sleep, as it
were, into the Arms of Death, or if a <HI>Crise</HI>
happens, it is either into a meer <HI>Languor</HI>
and <HI>Insensibility,</HI> a confirmed <HI>Cachexy,</HI> with
deep <HI>Nervous</HI> Symptoms, or settled <HI>Melan∣choly,</HI>
a <HI>Palsy,</HI> some <HI>mortified</HI> Limb, a vio∣lent
lasting <HI>Diarrhoea;</HI> and sometimes those
of the more benign Kinds terminate in <HI>Inter∣mittents.</HI>
This <HI>Fever</HI> (which always arises
from a <HI>Cachexy</HI> and great Obstructions, as
well as weak Solids, and which enters,
in some Degree, into our <HI>Malignant Fevers</HI>
of all Kinds) has infinite Degrees and Va∣riety,
according to the original Strength of
the <HI>Fibres,</HI> or the Time of the Patient's Life,
but those I have described are the most com∣mon,
and perhaps the worst Symptoms, as
any one who has seen and observed them
must know.</P>
<P>§ III. FROM this Description of the
Disease, and what I have already said about
<PB N="231" REF="267"/>
the Symptoms of <HI>Vapours,</HI> it is pretty evi∣dent,
what will be the principal <HI>Intention,</HI>
and the best manner of treating it, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Grinding, Breaking, and Dissolving the Co∣hesion,
Viscidity, and Sharpness of the
Fluids, and throwing them off by the safest
and most patent Outlets. All the Eva∣cuations
must be gentle, except <HI>Vomiting,</HI>
which may be repeated freely thro' all the
Stages (if the Symptoms require, and
Strength permit, but especially in the Be∣ginning)
and <HI>Blistering,</HI> which necessarily
must be as extensive and universal as possible,
tho' not violent, or all at once, but gradually
applying one or more Blisters on different
Parts, as the others dry up: As to <HI>Bleeding,</HI>
I think it ought to be done once, and but
cautiously repeated, be the Blood ever so
<HI>sizy</HI> and <HI>Rheumatick,</HI> because the Vessels
must be kept full, tho' not turgid, in order
to preserve their <HI>Tension,</HI> for grinding or
concocting the Morbid Matter. The much
better Way is to endeavour by all the Means
possible in <HI>Art,</HI> to thin and dilute, to re∣move
the Obstructions, and to rouse the
weak and languishing Solids into a more
hearty Struggle, both by <HI>Diet</HI> and Medi∣cines,
to conquer the Disease. This is to be
done by the <HI>Cinnabarin, Antimonial,</HI> and
<HI>Mineral</HI> Medicines chiefly, such as <HI>Antimony
Diaphoretick, Bezoar Mineral, Cinnabar,</HI>
and the like, joined with volatile and urinous
<PB N="232" REF="268"/>
Salts, such as that of <HI>Hartshorn, Amber, &amp;c.</HI>
and these again compounded with gentle
<HI>Diaphoreticks,</HI> as <HI>Saffron, Contrayerva, Goa
Stone, Oriental Bezoar, Gascoign Powder,</HI> or
the warmer Compounds, as <HI>Confectio Alker∣mes,
Venice Treacle, Diascordium</HI> without
<HI>Opium, Confectio Rawleiana, Electuarium de
Sassafras, &amp;c.</HI> wash'd down with appropriated
Juleps, and quickened with volatile Spirits, as
those of <HI>Hartshorn, Sal-volatile,</HI> or <HI>Goddard</HI>'s
Drops, for here universally Liquid Forms
are to be preferred to Solid ones; and thus
to try to overcome the Viscidity of the Juices,
and to rouze the Sluggishness of the Solids
to a brisker <HI>Circulation</HI> and Struggle, for
which Purpose the <HI>Diet,</HI> at least the Li∣quids
are allowed commonly a little stronger
and higher than in <HI>inflammatory Fevers;</HI>
tho' I shall ever be of Opinion, where there
is any Degree of quick Pulse or praeter∣natural
Heat, <HI>Diluents</HI> and <HI>Coolers</HI> are
directly indicated, whether in <HI>Fevers inflam∣matory</HI>
or <HI>nervous:</HI> and <HI>Cordials</HI> and high
Food only as the Pulse and Spirits sink too
low. I allow that if <HI>Art</HI> could always <HI>prompt,
whip, spur,</HI> and <HI>stimulate</HI> the <HI>Animal Oeco∣nomy</HI>
to grind the sizy Juices by a strong
and brisk Circulation, the <HI>Fever</HI> would be
shorter, and the <HI>Crise</HI> more complete, and
the <HI>diluting, cooling</HI> Method of Cure less ne∣cessary:
But as that is both uncertain and
unsafe, because none alive can ascertain the
<PB N="233" REF="269"/>
precise Degree of Strength in the Patient,
nor of the Malignity in the Disease, and
that the <HI>Crise,</HI> (if attainable) under such a
Method, is almost ever with the quite De∣struction
of the whole <HI>System</HI> of the <HI>Nerves,</HI>
the <HI>Brain,</HI> the <HI>Faculties,</HI> the <HI>Limbs,</HI> or the
whole rational <HI>Man:</HI> and therefore the cool
Method, tho' tedious, yet is ever without
Danger, and the Recovery, when obtained
(which the cool Method will always obtain
at last, if the Distemper is not stronger than
the Patient, as well in <HI>Acute</HI> as <HI>Chronical</HI>
Cases) always complete, full, and pro∣ductive
of strong Health after. This is all
I need to say of <HI>Nervous Fevers,</HI> as dis∣tinguished
from hot and depuratory ones.
How to fetch up the Patient, if he re∣covers,
to Health and Spirits, I have shewn
already.</P>
<P>§ IV. THE <HI>Nervous Cholick,</HI> as distin∣guished
from the <HI>Bilious,</HI> arising chiefly in
such Constitutions as I have described, dif∣fers
principally, if not only, from that, in
the Violence and Duration of its <HI>Paroxysms,</HI>
and there being more of the <HI>Convulsive</HI> or
<HI>Spasmodick</HI> Kind in them: produced chiefly
by the same Kind of acrid and sharp Juices;
but as the Solids, in the <HI>first</HI> Case, are more
sensible and irritable, a less Quantity of this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rritating Matter throws them into more vio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent
<HI>Tumults</HI> and <HI>Convulsions,</HI> which lasts
<PB N="234" REF="270"/>
sometimes two or three Days with violent
<HI>Tortures, Reachings,</HI> and <HI>Vomitings,</HI> throw∣ing
up every thing that is taken down, till
at last the morbifick Matter being quite
spent and ejected for this Time, Nature,
almost overlaid and worn out, sinks down
into a <HI>lethargick</HI> Dosing, which leaves the
Patient quite feeble and dispirited. A Cold∣ness
upon the Extremities, <HI>Yawning, Anxiety,</HI>
a <HI>Nausea,</HI> and Sickishness, are the Signs of
the Approach of this Kind of <HI>Cholick,</HI> and
such recover but slowly, and at first their
Intervals are but short. I generally suspect
that the <HI>Liver</HI> of such is beginning to be
faulty, bigger and larger than ordinary, or
obstructed: because of the great Quantity of
<HI>Bile</HI> that is constantly thrown off, and the
<HI>Jaundice,</HI> that always succeeds it for some
Days, which probably may have been occa∣sioned
by a <HI>Mal-Regimen,</HI> or too great a
Quantity of high Food, at least, for such
Constitutions: for it is well known, that
Cramming and Over-feeding with higher
than a natural Food, as I have said, will
swell and increase the <HI>Livers</HI> of all Ani∣mals.</P>
<P>§ V. THE Cure of this Distemper is al∣most
intirely the same with that mentioned
in a former <HI>Chapter</HI> of the Symptoms of
Vapours. If the <HI>Fits</HI> are not prevented by
frequent <HI>Vomits,</HI> proportioned to the Strength
<PB N="235" REF="271"/>
of the Patient, or gentle <HI>Stomach Purges</HI> to
throw off the peccant bilious Humour as
collected, nothing can be done in the Fit,
but by repeated Doses of <HI>Opiates,</HI> with pro∣per
<HI>Cordials,</HI> as often as they are thrown
up, either in a solid or liquid Form: to stop
and allay the <HI>Torture</HI> till the Fit is quite
spent; and a gentle Stomach Purge, (if the
Bowels can bear it without too much Irri∣tation)
with a Dose of <HI>Laudanum</HI> to quiet
them afterwards; the Intervals are to be
filled up with <HI>Chalybeats, Aromaticks, Bit∣ters,
Mineral Waters,</HI> a strict Regimen of
Diet, and much Exercise, or a <HI>total</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Sydenham Dissert. Epist. de Affectione Hysterica.</NOTE> <HI>Milk
Diet,</HI> which seldom fails to cure this Dis∣order,
if the Patient is not too far gone in
Life, or some of the great <HI>Viscera</HI> spoiled,
and irremediably ruined, in which Case, it
terminates in one of the incurable Distem∣pers
I have so often mentioned.</P>
<P>§ VI. As to Nervous <HI>Gouts, Rheuma∣tisms,</HI>
and <HI>Asthma's,</HI> they being generally
denominated thus from those Constitutions I
have mentioned to be most subject to <HI>Nervous</HI>
Distempers, it were a needless Repetition to
say any thing of these Diseases; in general,
they being to be met with in those Authors
that have treated professedly of them, and
<PB N="236" REF="272"/>
what regards them specially as they are
<HI>Nervous,</HI> being easily deduced from the ge∣neral
Doctrine of <HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers, and
what has been said of the several Symptoms
in particular: only in <HI>Nervous Asthma</HI>'s with
Flegm, or perhaps, (as I have already insi∣nuated)
in <HI>Humorous Asthma</HI>'s, both of Per∣sons
of firm and lax Solids, Liquid Quicksilver,
(or <HI>Bellost</HI>'s Pills made with <HI>Gum Ammoniac</HI>)
will be found a sovereign Remedy, if dis∣cretely
managed, half an Ounce taken once
or twice a Day, with a thin, light, fluid Diet,
will do more than <HI>Ammoniacum</HI> alone, and all
the Class of the <HI>Volatile</HI> and <HI>Foetid</HI> Medicines,
to dissolve the Flegm, assist Expectoration,
and to make the Expiration and Inspiration
easy; whether this be done by the Weight of
the <HI>Mercury</HI> in the Guts, opening all their
<HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Valves,</HI> but especially by this
<HI>Clump</HI> of Weight, turning the Mouths of the
<HI>Lacteals</HI> from <HI>circular</HI> to <HI>oval,</HI> and thereby
driving out all their thick <HI>flegmy</HI> Dossils
that obstructed them, whereby they becoming
pervious, the Steams and Particles of the
Quicksilver may pervade the whole Habit,
dissolve the Viscidity, and scour all the Ves∣sels.
I say, however this happens, the <HI>Fact</HI>
is undeniable, and agreeable to innumerable
Experiences, in the most atrocious and ob∣stinate
Cases of this Complaint. All that
can be further suggested, without manifest
<HI>Tautology,</HI> will be comprehended in these
<PB N="237" REF="273"/>
two Particulars, <HI>first,</HI> that in treating the
particular Distempers of such, besides the
Medicines proper and peculiar to them,
which are commonly successful or usual in
strong Constitutions, these others are to be
combined with them now, which I have
suggested in the Cure of the Symptoms of
weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> or, at least, they are to be
then used, when the <HI>Nervous</HI> Symptoms have
the Predominance. The <HI>other</HI> Thing is,
that the <HI>Doses</HI> of the Medicines, and the
<HI>Regimen of the Diet,</HI> ought to be propor∣tioned
to the Weakness of such Constitutions.
The same Things are to be understood of all
other Distempers, of whatever Denomination,
that are called <HI>Nervous.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Palsy, St. Vitus's Dance, and
other Paralytick Disorders.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. THERE is no Disorder inci∣dent
to the Inhabitants of this
Island and Climate more com∣mon,
of late especially, than the <HI>Palsy,</HI> or
<HI>Paralytick Symptoms,</HI> nor of a more difficult
Cure, when they happen to People of ori∣ginal
or acquired weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> or upon the
Decline of Life. A Cold, or being exposed
to a sharp freezing <HI>North-East</HI> Wind, con∣tinuing
long in an unnatural Posture, so as
to stop some great Blood Vessels: hard and
excessive Labour, a moist and damp Situation,
<HI>Antimonial</HI> or <HI>Mercurial</HI> external Steams, a
<HI>Blow</HI> or <HI>Contusion</HI> upon some Parts of the
Body, where there are the greatest Collec∣tions
of <HI>Nerves;</HI> all these, I say, are suffi∣cient
Causes to produce <HI>partial</HI> or temporary
<HI>Palsies:</HI> but these arising chiefly from some
Obstruction of the Blood Vessels, where by
<PB N="239" REF="275"/>
the Passage of that Balsamick Liquor, neces∣sary
to cherish the Muscles, is intercepted,
and the <HI>Nerves,</HI> hurt only by Accident,
yield generally to Bleeding, active and pon∣derous
Remedies of the <HI>Mineral Kind,</HI> to
break the coagulated Blood, and open Ob∣structions,
joined with Astringents, towards
the End of the Cure, such as the <HI>Quinquina,
Oak Bark, Misletoe,</HI> and the like; Blistering,
and warm, caustic, outward Applications,
as Fomentations, with a Decoction of <HI>Mus∣tard
Seed, Horse Radish, Pellitory, Zedoary,
Juniper Berries, &amp;c.</HI> with an Addition of
<HI>camphorated Spitit of Wine,</HI> active and pene∣trating
<HI>Ointments</HI> and <HI>Epithemes,</HI> as the
<HI>Nervous Ointment,</HI> an Ointment made with
<HI>Horse Radish,</HI> the <HI>Opodeldoc,</HI> and the like,
or <HI>Friction</HI> with the Flesh-Brush, and
anointing with <HI>Opodeldoc,</HI> dissolved in cam∣phorated
Spirit of Wine after, or with the
other warm Oils, as those of <HI>Amber, Cloves,
Vitriol diluted, &amp;c.</HI> and drinking the <HI>Bath
Waters, bathing</HI> in the same, or <HI>pumping</HI>
on the Part affected. These Kinds, I say,
are not the Palsies I intended principally to
treat of here, since they happen generally
to good sound Constitutions and firm <HI>Nerves,</HI>
and are thus easily remedied.</P>
<P>§ II. THESE I am principally concerned
about, are such as happen in the <HI>Decline of
Life,</HI> to Persons of vitiated Juices and weak
<PB N="240" REF="276"/>
<HI>Nerves,</HI> where <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders have
preceded, or in which <HI>Vapours</HI> commonly
terminate, who have spoiled their Habits, at
least, by <HI>relative Intemperance</HI> (which is
always to be understood when I speak of
Excesses producing Diseases) such <HI>Palsies</HI> are
either a general Seizure of most, if not all
the <HI>Muscles</HI> and <HI>Nerves</HI> of the whole Ma∣chine,
or of one half of the Body only, as
of the right or left Side, or of the upper
Part of the Body on one Side, with the
lower Part on the other Side, or lastly, of
some particular <HI>Limb</HI> or <HI>Muscle.</HI> There
is generally Reason to conclude from
the Appearances, that besides a <HI>Laxity</HI> of
the <HI>Nerves,</HI> or a Defect in their innate
Power of Contraction and <HI>Tonical</HI> Nature,
there are likewise Obstructions of the Capil∣lary
Blood Vessels, from some Fault in the
Animal Juices, which, when rectified, cures
the <HI>Palsy.</HI> This is manifect, from the Cure
of a great many inveterate Palsies, while the
Patient is strong, by <HI>Salivation</HI> or <HI>Mercurial</HI>
Medicines, and yet there is nothing more
evident, than that much <HI>Mercury</HI> or <HI>frequent
Salivations,</HI> in weak Constitutions, will give
<HI>Paralytick Symptoms;</HI> witness the <HI>Tremor
Mercurialis,</HI> so common in Persons of weak
<HI>Nerves,</HI> under such an Operation, from
whence is further confirmed (what was
pretty manifest before, from other Appear∣ances)
that towards animal Motion, the In∣flux
<PB N="241" REF="277"/>
of a sound balsamick Blood, to moisten
and cherish the fleshy Fibres, is as much
or more necessary, even than the Integrity
and innate Action of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> or <HI>animal
Spirits</HI> (if you please). And as the Faulti∣ness
of both concurs towards producing all
<HI>nervous</HI> Distempers, so more especially to
those call'd <HI>Paralytick.</HI> There can be no
Difficulty to one, acquainted with Nature,
and the <HI>animal Oeconomy,</HI> why the same Cause,
<HI>Mercury,</HI> for Example, should cure, and yet
cause and produce in different Degrees and
Quantities, the very same Disease, to wit, a
<HI>Palsy.</HI> We know, a certain Degree of Heat,
which will only produce <HI>Smoak,</HI> rais'd to a
higher Degree, will produce <HI>Light</HI> and
<HI>Flame:</HI> A certain Degree of Heat, in the
same <HI>Fomentation,</HI> will dissolve and dissipate
a <HI>Tumor,</HI> and a higher Degree of it will
harden and make it <HI>schirrous;</HI> and thus,
<HI>Mercury,</HI> in moderate Doses, will break,
dissolve, and attenuate the Blood and Juices,
whose Viscidity and consequent <HI>Compression</HI>
on the <HI>Nerves,</HI> interrupt their Vibrations
and Action, and so produce a <HI>Palsy,</HI> which
a gentle Salivation will remedy and antidote.
But when the <HI>active Steams</HI> and small <HI>pon∣derous
Particles</HI> of <HI>Mercury</HI> have penetrated
and saturated the Substance of the <HI>Nerves</HI>
and <HI>Solids,</HI> they will spoil and alter their
whole Substance and Action, and so cause
an universal <HI>Palsy.</HI> But the Juices seem
<PB N="242" REF="278"/>
to be the principal Cause of the Difficulty of
the Cure of <HI>Palsies</HI> in the Decline of Life;
because towards old Age the Solids stiffen
and harden at a greater Rate, than in the
younger Part of Life, so the spoil'd Juices
are then more hard to be remedied.</P>
<P>§. III. IF a Person, at or about the <HI>Meri∣dian</HI>
of Life, be seiz'd with such <HI>paralytick</HI>
Disorders, and they are not cur'd, or at least
prevented from settling or confirming at first,
they are seldom ever afterwards totally freed
from them, whatever Methods be tried with
them: And therefore, as soon as the Disease
is discover'd, <HI>Bleeding</HI> at first, if the Patient is
strong, and the Pulse full, and then <HI>Blisters,</HI>
first over all the Head, then on the Nape of
the Neck, the Legs and Arms, and especially
on the Parts affected, and in the Intervals, or
when the Effects of these are pretty much
worn off; active warm Purges, especially
of <HI>Hellebore</HI> and <HI>Sena,</HI> on a vinous <HI>Menstruum,</HI>
ought to be used and repeated as often as the
Strength of the Patient will bear, with some
<HI>cordial</HI> Medicines, as that of Sir <HI>Walter
Raleigh, Electuarium de Sassafras,</HI> &amp;c. (at
Night, after the Operation is over) wash'd down
with a <HI>nervous Julep,</HI> mix'd with <HI>Volatile Spi∣rits.</HI>
When these Evacuations have thus
been duly made, a Course of <HI>Chalybeats,
Aromaticks</HI> and <HI>Bitters,</HI> is to be prescrib'd,
to recruit the Strength of the Solids, and
<PB N="243" REF="279"/>
warm and active <HI>Oils</HI> and <HI>Ointments,</HI> especially
the <HI>Opodeldoc:</HI> and stimulating Fomentations
applied to the Parts affected, they being first
well curried with a <HI>Flesh Brush. Cold Bath∣ing</HI>
may be also tried on sound Constitutions,
but <HI>hot Bathing</HI> of any Sort or Kind, will, I
fear, be of little Use, and may, in some deep
rooted Cases, do hurt by a temporary, at least
greater Relaxation, unless the Juices be
extremely well thinn'd by <HI>ponderous</HI> Medi∣cines
first.</P>
<P>§. IV. IF these Medicines are duly and
effectually tried, under the Direction of a
proper Person, and with little or no Success,
the Case may be deem'd incurable. Not that
it is always mortal, for I have known them
last as many Years under a <HI>paralytick</HI> Stroke,
as under an Amputation, especially if the
<HI>Palsy</HI> had not followed after an <HI>Apoplectick,
Epileptick,</HI> or some strong <HI>nervous</HI> Paroxysm
or Fit: And even then, if the Constitution
was tolerable, and the general Method of
Cure of <HI>nervous</HI> Distempers has been duly
and steadily pursued, seldom any thing
worse has happen'd from it than the Loss of
that Organ or Limb, which the Distemper
had seiz'd, and disabled: Life in other
Respects, and under such a Management,
having gone on pretty tolerably.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="280"/>
§ V. SAINT VITUS'S DANCE (as it
is call'd) the <HI>mimicking Distemper,</HI> and
all such irregular and equivocal <HI>nervous</HI>
Disorders, may be easily reduced under
some of the general Heads I have assigned.
The <HI>first</HI> is certainly a Mixture of <HI>para∣lytick</HI>
and <HI>convulsive</HI> Disorders. It very
often arises out of an <HI>Epilepsy,</HI> especially
in young People, when the original Dis∣temper
is overcome, and a greater De∣gree
of Strength is obtain'd, tho' some∣times
it is only a <HI>Prelude</HI> to that severe
Distemper, and may itself sometimes be
an original Disease; I have cur'd it, as I
mention'd in my Book of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in
young Persons, by repeated <HI>antimonial Vo∣mits,
mercurial Purges, Steel,</HI> and <HI>Aroma∣ticks,</HI>
and the other general Methods so
often mention'd.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Apoplexy and Epilepsy.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. THE <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> in its <HI>Fit</HI> and
<HI>Paroxysm,</HI> is one of the most
frightful and fatal Distempers
belonging to the <HI>nervous</HI> Class of Diseases,
few out-living the first Fit, fewer the second,
and, as it is commonly said, none at all the
<HI>third:</HI> tho' this Observation is not altogether
without Exceptions; for it is in this, as in
all other bodily Distempers, those who are
strong and robust, and in whom the Cause
is but just beginning to operate, and meets
with a greater Resistance from the State of
the Solids, will hold it longer, and struggle
more than the weak and tender. Few are
ever seiz'd with this Distemper, if it comes
naturally, and without an Accident, till
towards the <HI>Decline of Life,</HI> unless they
have been much troubled, with violent
and acute <HI>Head-aches,</HI> or Inflammations
upon the <HI>Brain,</HI> or its <HI>Membranes,</HI> or have
some inflammatory Distemper translated from
<PB N="246" REF="282"/>
the Extremities upon the Head, such as the
<HI>Gout, Rheumatism, Erysipelas,</HI> and the like:
those who are seiz'd with a deep Stroak of
it, have scarce any Warning, but a sudden
violent <HI>Head-ach,</HI> a Sickness at the Stomach,
or a <HI>Cholick,</HI> and drop down immediately,
without Sense or Motion, and have scarce
any Sign of Life, except now and then an
uncertain Twitch or Twinkle in the Pulse
(if it is not from Flatulence) and scarce any
Breathing that can be discover'd, even on
the Surface of a Glass, but a constant <HI>Snort∣ing</HI>
or <HI>Snoring</HI> in the Throat and Nostrils.
Those in whom it comes naturally, are
observ'd generally to be either <HI>gross Feeders,</HI>
or those who deal too plentifully in strong
and <HI>spirituous Liquors,</HI> of a gross and full
Habit, <HI>short and thick neck'd,</HI> voluptuous
and lazy; tho' some thinner Habits, may
suffer under it, but they are those who have
formerly been subject to violent <HI>Heach-aches,</HI>
or are worn out by <HI>Lechery.</HI></P>
<P>§ II. THERE are three kinds of <HI>Apoplexies</HI>
distinguish'd by the different Causes that pro∣duce
them; as <HI>first,</HI> a <HI>Symptomatick Apoplexy,</HI>
such as I have mention'd, from a Translation
of the <HI>Gout, Rheumatism,</HI> &amp;c. 2<HI>dly,</HI> An
accidental one, from a <HI>Fall, Bruise, Wound,</HI>
or the like: and 3<HI>dly,</HI> an <HI>acquir'd one,</HI> ari∣sing
from an <HI>Apoplectick</HI> Disposition or <HI>Dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rasy,</HI>
proceeding from Intemperance and
<PB N="247" REF="283"/>
Excesses, Laziness, and Neglect of the <HI>Non∣naturals</HI>
in Persons of the abovemention'd
particular Make and Constitution of Body.
It is of this <HI>last</HI> chiefly that I intend to say
any thing here, the Treatment of the others
being obvious. As to the immediate <HI>Cause</HI>
of the <HI>Apoplectick Fit,</HI> I think it must be one
of these two, <HI>viz.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Philosoph. Transact. N° 313.</NOTE> either a <HI>Rupture</HI> of the
Blood-Vessels in the <HI>Brain,</HI> whereby a great
Quantity of <HI>Blood</HI> being extravasated upon
its including <HI>Membranes,</HI> or into its Cavities,
presses upon the <HI>Origin</HI> of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> so as
to intercept their Operation and <HI>Functions,</HI>
from whence the mention'd Appearances may
be easily deduc'd. And this may be either
occasion'd by a <HI>Fall,</HI> a <HI>Bruise,</HI> a <HI>Wound,</HI> or
any other violent Accident upon the <HI>Skull,</HI>
or by too great a Quantity of <HI>Blood,</HI> or its
being overheated by strong Liquors, violent
Exercise, or immoderate sensual Pleasures,
in those who have the Configuration I have
described. This seems to be the Case of
those <HI>Apoplexies</HI> that happen in <HI>Southern
Countries,</HI> where, tho' the <HI>Climate</HI> confines
them to a very moderate <HI>Diet,</HI> yet as they
wallow in <HI>sensual Pleasures</HI> of another
Nature, and deal sometimes pretty freely
with <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors, and <HI>Opiates</HI> (which
have the same <HI>deleterious</HI> Effects) these things
<PB N="248" REF="284"/>
in a scorching <HI>Climate,</HI> may kindle a Flame
in the Blood sufficient to produce these men∣tion'd
Effects.</P>
<P>§ III. THE other kind of <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> which
happens naturally, and is most frequent in
<HI>Northern</HI> Countries and colder <HI>Climates,</HI>
seems to arise chiefly from an <HI>Extravasa∣tion,</HI>
or rather <HI>Ouzing</HI> out thro' the Sides of
the relax'd and worn out Capillary Blood-Vessels,
of a thin <HI>putrid Serum,</HI> upon the
mention'd Parts, which I have hinted in the
former Case. This chiefly happens to <HI>gross</HI>
and <HI>full Feeders,</HI> to those who are too free
with strong and <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors, and are
consequently very unactive and lazy. I
have formerly shewn how such a <HI>Course</HI> and
<HI>Regimen</HI> will almost, or altogether, destroy
the red or grumous Part of the <HI>Blood,</HI> and
turn the whole Mass of the Fluids into a
<HI>dirty Puddle</HI> of thin <HI>alcaline saltish Serum,</HI>
which Corrodes or <HI>Ouzes</HI> thro' the flabby
and relax'd Capillaries. That this is pretty
near the Truth, is evident from opening the
<HI>Heads</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Boneti Sepulchret. Anatom. Lib. I.</NOTE> of those who have died of a natural
<HI>Apoplexy,</HI> the Cavities of the Brain having
been found generally quite filled, either
with <HI>extravasated Blood,</HI> or such a <HI>Serum,</HI>
as I have mention'd. Those who want fur∣ther
<PB N="249" REF="285"/>
Light in this Affair may consult <HI>Wepser.</HI>
The mildest apoplectick Fits, of all, where
the Patient escapes for once or twice, seem
to arise only from an Obstruction or <HI>Tume∣faction</HI>
of the Blood-Vessels, or <HI>Glands</HI> in the
Cavity of the <HI>Skull,</HI> upon the Removal of
which Obstruction, by the Struggle and Effort
of Nature, in the <HI>Paroxysm,</HI> it ceases. This
Degree is what seems only capable of be∣ing
cured; but if it is suffer'd to go on
without any effectual Method, us'd to re∣move
the <HI>apoplectick</HI> Disposition by rectifying
the Juices, two or three more such <HI>Pa∣roxysms</HI>
burst the Vessels, and bring on the
incurable Kinds mention'd.</P>
<P>§ IV. IF the Account here given of this
terrible Distemper be just, there will be no
Difficulty in forming the true <HI>Indications,</HI>
and the most effectual Method of <HI>Cure,</HI> as
far as it is possible. Which of these Causes
have the Prevalency in a particular Case,
will be evident, from the Manner of Life,
the Age and Constitution of the Patient, and
the Symptoms of the <HI>Fit.</HI> There is very
little Hope of Success in either Case, unless
the Cause be but just beginning and very
weak; or the Person very strong and young,
and otherwise sound. To rouze them out
of the present Fit; in the <HI>first Case,</HI> the
most plentiful <HI>Bleeding</HI> that can possibly be
ventur'd upon, is to be attempted at the
<PB N="250" REF="286"/>
Arm, in the <HI>temporal</HI> Artery, or the <HI>jugu∣lar</HI>
Vein, in the Foot, and by Cupping
on the Nape of the Neck, together with
sharp, cooling and acid <HI>Glysters,</HI> while
Blisters are laid on in every Place where
they can conveniently be. In those <HI>Fits</HI>
produced by such a <HI>Serum</HI> as I have
mention'd, or from an Obstruction in the
<HI>Glands, Vomits</HI> are also immediately to be
forc'd down, (but avoided in those occa∣sion'd
by a <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> because in
this last, the great Affair is to stop the
Violence of the <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> and to
draw it off by all possible Means from
the <HI>Brain</HI>): And Care is likewise to be
taken, neither by inward Medicines nor
outward Application, to increase the Hurry,
Heat, or <HI>Inflammation</HI> of the Blood: and
therefore the Solids are not to be stimu∣lated
to too violent Efforts. Whereas, in
the <HI>other Case,</HI> neither of these can be
done too much: and therefore, not only
sharp <HI>Sternutatories, foetid Smells,</HI> and <HI>vola∣tile
Spirits,</HI> may be applied to the <HI>Nose,</HI>
but (other Things not succeeding) even
actual <HI>Cauteries</HI> are to be applied to the
Soles of the Feet, and Crown of the Head,
as far as it can be done safely, to raise <HI>Sensibility</HI>
and Pain: besides the warmest <HI>cordial</HI> Medi∣cines,
in a liquid Form, if they can be thrust
down any how.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="287"/>
§ V. AS to the <HI>Apoplectick</HI> Disposition,
in those of the inflammatory Kind, all pro∣per
Means are to be used that tend to cool
the Blood, and allay its <HI>Fermentation</HI> and
Heat, such as <HI>Acids, acidulated</HI> Draughts,
mild <HI>Balsamicks,</HI> gentle <HI>Catharticks,</HI> with an
extremely cool, moderate, and spare <HI>Diet,</HI>
abstaining from violent Exercise, and every
thing that may heat and inflame the Blood.
The other <HI>Apoplectick</HI> Disposition must be
treated much after the same Manner, with
this Difference only, that the Medicines must
be stronger and warmer, the Exercise greater
and more constant, that continual Drains, by
<HI>Blisters, Issues, Setons,</HI> and the like, be set a
going, and that the <HI>Diet</HI> be somewhat
higher in Quality, tho' not in Quantity, and
the other general Methods for the Cure of
the <HI>Nervous</HI> Symptoms that succeed upon it,
be pursued according to the Directions for∣merly
given.</P>
<P>§ VI. NEXT to the <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> the <HI>Epi∣lepsy</HI>
is the most dangerous, terrible, and
disheartening Distemper that belongs to the
<HI>Nervous</HI> or <HI>cold</HI> Class of Diseases; seldom
any, or, at least very few, escape from it,
unless they be otherwise very strong and
vigorous, without a Stroke of an <HI>Apoplexy,</HI>
which generally ends their Lives: a <HI>partial</HI> or
<HI>half-Body Palsy,</HI> or a total Demolition of the
<PB N="252" REF="288"/>
<HI>Intellectual Faculties.</HI> Young Children, well
treated, may be recovered, and get strong
and lusty, by stronger <HI>Doses,</HI> and a longer
Course of the same Medicines and Methods
I have advised for their <HI>Convulsive</HI> Fits. The
Symptoms that attend grown Persons are,
their <HI>dropping down</HI> suddenly, as if shot; but
sometimes with violent <HI>Convulsions</HI> and
<HI>Throws</HI> in the <HI>Belly, Breast,</HI> and <HI>Limbs;</HI>
beating and tearing themselves, <HI>clinching</HI>
their <HI>Fists, biting</HI> their <HI>Tongues, grinding</HI>
their <HI>Teeth,</HI> and <HI>foaming</HI> at the Mouth, with
a small <HI>Trembling, unequal</HI> and sometimes
<HI>interrupted Pulse,</HI> and an involuntary Secre∣tion
of all the natural Discharges: having
scarce any Sense or Knowledge of what they
do, or what is done to them: but the most
dangerous of all, are their violent <HI>Convulsions</HI>
and involuntary Motions, by which they
would tear, bruise, and destroy themselves,
if not with-held: the <HI>Fit</HI> generally terminates
in a Dosing or <HI>Lethargy,</HI> which continues
longer or shorter, according to the Violence
of the <HI>Paroxysm,</HI> and then by Degrees their
Spirits and Strength return, tho' with a
greater Degree of Lowness and Confusion,
or Stupidity. This Distemper sometimes
follows the Periods of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Mead de Imperio Solis &amp; Lunae.</NOTE> <HI>Luminaries,</HI>
especially their <HI>Conjunctions</HI> and <HI>Oppositions;</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="289"/>
but this is uncertain, and in some Cases
only, as all <HI>Periods</HI> are in our inconstant
<HI>Climate.</HI></P>
<P>§ VII. FROM this Account of the Symp∣toms
of this Distemper, I think it is pretty
evident, that it differs very little, or not at
all, or at most, in a few Circumstances only,
from <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>Hysterick Fits:</HI>
which last, when violent, terminate always
in these <HI>Epileptick</HI> Fits, as they, on the
other Hand, when they become weak,
dwindle into the <HI>Hysterick</HI> Kind: So that
having treated of these last so fully, it will
be needless to say any thing further about
these others; only this, that the Diet must
be much more strict, cool, and moderate,
and the Medicines stronger and oftner re∣peated,
especially <HI>Vomits, Steel,</HI> and <HI>Bitters.</HI>
Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> of <HI>Croydon</HI> cured himself intirely
and absolutely, of the most violent, constant,
and habitual <HI>Epilepsy</HI> that perhaps ever was
known, after having, in vain, tried all the
Methods and Medicines advised by the most
eminent <HI>Physicians</HI> of his Time, by a <HI>total
Diet of Milk,</HI> without Bread, or any other
Vegetable, or any thing (besides a Spoonful
of compound <HI>Peony Water</HI> sometimes, to
prevent its Curdling) confining himself to a
<HI>Pint</HI> in a Morning, a <HI>Quart</HI> at Noon, and a
<HI>Pint</HI> at Night, of the Milk of <HI>Grass-fed</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="290"/>
Cows in the <HI>Summer,</HI> and of those fed with
<HI>Hay</HI> in the <HI>Winter,</HI> the <HI>Milk</HI> of Cows fed
with <HI>Grains</HI> always inflating him, and lying
uneasy on his Stomach. He had continued
in perfect Health and Vigour (having had
several Children) seventeen Years when I saw
him, and received this Account from him,
insomuch that he could have play'd four or
five Hours at <HI>Cricket,</HI> on <HI>Banstead Downs,</HI>
without Weariness or profuse Sweating, and
probably might have continued many Years
longer in perfect Health (as he did seven or
eight Years more) had he not entered upon
a different <HI>Regimen of Diet</HI> (as I am in∣formed
since I first wrote this History, in
my <HI>Treatise of the Gout,</HI> by a Person of
great Credit) and come to eat <HI>Animal Food,</HI>
by which, in a <HI>short</HI> Time, he was destroyed.
Some others have been cured by me, by a
<HI>Regimen of Diet</HI> less strict, and the Medi∣cines
already suggested; but I believe none
ever were cured who have been come to
<HI>Maturity,</HI> without a very exact <HI>low Regimen,</HI>
continued during all their Lives, the trans∣gressing
it for any long time, always bring∣ing
their Disorders back, if not something
worse: and I believe a total Milk, and
Vegetable Diet, as absolutely necessary for
the total Cure of the <HI>Epilepsy,</HI> as it is for the
<HI>Gout</HI> or a <HI>Consumption.</HI> Here were the pro∣per
Place to say something of <HI>Lunacy</HI> and
<HI>Madness,</HI> being satisfied that the Methods
<PB N="255" REF="291"/>
here laid down are sufficient, and the most
effectual for these Distempers; but designing
this principally for common intelligent
Readers, and those who suffer under <HI>Nervous</HI>
Distempers, tho' not regularly bred to the
Practice of <HI>Physick:</HI> and People under these
mentioned Distempers being incapable of
Reading, or at least, of serious and close
Application, and these Disorders being the
Province of particular <HI>Physicians,</HI> or those

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Last, has been by far
the most difficult and un∣pleasant
Part <HI>of my Work.
The obvious</HI> Sneer <HI>of its
being a</HI> Quack's Bill, <HI>has been the least
Part of that Difficulty; for when I set
about finishing this Work, for the Be∣nefit
of the Sedentary, Tender and De∣cay'd,
I made a</HI> Sacrifice <HI>of some part of
my Vanity and Interest. But among
the very many Instances I could have
adduced, I was obliged to lay aside all
those whose</HI> Cases <HI>were pretty much
alike, and to pick out such only, as
<PB N="260" REF="294"/>
seem'd to me, to be more particular,
or which were most proper to illus∣trate
and confirm the several Steps
of the preceding Doctrine, and to
direct the</HI> Valetudinarian, <HI>in the less
obvious and uncommon Symptoms. But
that which distress'd me most, was, the</HI>
Names <HI>of the Persons, whose</HI> Cases <HI>I
was oblig'd to mention, most of them
being still</HI> alive, <HI>and few caring to be
made</HI> Examples <HI>of in any Respect. The</HI>
Distempers of Patients are sacred, (Res
sacra miser) <HI>and</HI> nervous <HI>Distempers
especially, are under some Kind of</HI>
Disgrace <HI>and</HI> Imputation, <HI>in the Opi∣nion
of the</HI> Vulgar <HI>and</HI> Unlearned;
<HI>they pass among the Multitude, for
a lower Degree of</HI> Lunacy, <HI>and the
first Step towards a</HI> distemper'd Brain:
<HI>and the best Construction is</HI> Whim, Ill-Humour,
Peevishness <HI>or</HI> Particularity;
<HI>and in the</HI> Sex, Daintiness, Fantastical∣ness
<HI>or</HI> Coquetry. <HI>So that often when I
have been consulted in a Case, before I
<PB N="261" REF="295"/>
was acquainted with the</HI> Character
<HI>and Temper of the Patient, and
found it to be what is commonly
call'd</HI> Nervous, <HI>I have been in the
utmost Difficulty, when desir'd to
define or name the Distemper, for
fear of affronting them, or fixing a
Reproach on a</HI> Family <HI>or</HI> Person.
<HI>If I call'd the Case</HI> Glandular <HI>with</HI>
nervous <HI>Symptoms, they concluded I
thought them</HI> pox'd, <HI>or had the</HI> King's-Evil.
<HI>If I said it was</HI> Vapours, Hyste∣rick
<HI>or</HI> Hypochondriacal <HI>Disorders, they
thought I call'd them</HI> Mad <HI>or</HI> Fan∣tastical:
<HI>and if they were such as
valued themselves, on fearing neither</HI>
God <HI>nor</HI> Devil, <HI>I was in Ha∣zard
of a</HI> Drubbing <HI>for seeming to
impeach their Courage: and was
thought as rude, as if I had given
them the</HI> Lye; <HI>and even the very
best has been, I myself was thought
a Fool, a weak and ignorant Cox∣comb,
and perhaps dismiss'd in Scorn;
<PB N="262" REF="296"/>
and some I have actually lost by it.
Notwithstanding all this, the Dis∣ease
is as much a bodily Distem∣per
(as I have demonstrated) as the</HI>
Small-Pox <HI>or a</HI> Fever; <HI>and the
Truth is, it seldom, and I think
never happens or can happen, to any
but those of the liveliest and quickest
natural Parts, whose Faculties are
the brightest and most spiritual, and
whose Genius is most keen and pe∣netrating,
and particularly where
there is the most delicate Sensation
and Taste, both of Pleasure and
Pain. So equally are the good and
bad Things of this mortal State di∣stributed!
For I seldom ever observ'd a</HI>
heavy, dull, earthy, clod-pated Clown,
<HI>much troubled with</HI> nervous <HI>Disorders,
or at least, not to any eminent Degree;
and I scarce believe the Thing possi∣ble,
from the</HI> animal Oeconomy <HI>and
the present Laws of Nature.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="297"/>
BUT <HI>besides this, when I was
determin'd to publish this Work, the
Persons whose</HI> Cases <HI>I had pick'd
out for my present Purpose, were
all scatter'd and at great Distances
from me, some being in other</HI> King∣doms
<HI>and</HI> foreign Parts, <HI>and most of
them were in such Circumstances and
Situation, that it was by no means
convenient or proper to publish, their</HI>
Names <HI>without Leave; and I was un∣willing
to put my</HI> Friends <HI>and</HI> Patients
<HI>to the Pain, either of a Consent or Re∣fusal,
and resolved even to bear the
Slur of</HI> Forgery, <HI>and let the Whole
rest on my own Credit, rather than
contend with such Difficulties. I have
therefore mentioned their</HI> Names, <HI>only
in those Cases where I was absolutely at
Liberty; but solemnly declare, that the
others were such</HI> in the main, <HI>as I have
represented them; and in any particular</HI>
Case, <HI>if called upon, I am ready to
assign the</HI> Person, <HI>under proper Con∣ditions,
<PB N="264" REF="298"/>
and have always describ'd the</HI>
Case <HI>from the</HI> Name <HI>and</HI> Character <HI>of
the</HI> Patient, <HI>and the</HI> History <HI>of the
Distemper placed before my Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE <HI>classed the</HI> Cases, <HI>as I
had done the several Stages of this
Distemper in the</HI> former Part, <HI>viz.
into the</HI> three <HI>different Orders. The</HI>
first Class <HI>and</HI> Chapter <HI>contains Ex∣amples
of those whose</HI> nervous <HI>Dis∣orders
being chiefly confin'd to the</HI>
alimentary Tube, <HI>the Juices being
tolerably sound and good, and the Solids
pretty firm, a Regulation only of com∣mon
Diet, as to Quantity and Qua∣lity,
and a general Course of</HI> ner∣vous
<HI>Evacuants, for Prevention, and</HI>
Volatiles <HI>on</HI> Paroxysms, <HI>has been suf∣ficient.
The</HI> second Class <HI>and</HI> Chap∣ter
<HI>contains Instances of those whose</HI>
Cases <HI>being deeper and more obsti∣nate,
where the Juices have been
either</HI> sizy, thick <HI>or</HI> inflam'd, <HI>or
<PB N="265" REF="299"/>
some noble</HI> Organ <HI>beginning to be
spoil'd: more powerful</HI> Evacuants <HI>and</HI>
Alteratives, <HI>especially of the</HI> ponde∣rous
<HI>Medicines, have been necessary;
and a</HI> trimming <HI>middling Diet, of</HI>
alternate <HI>Days of young tender Flesh
Meat, and Milk and Vegetables, with
Wine and Water for Drink, were
requir'd. The</HI> last Class <HI>and</HI> third
Chapter <HI>is of such, where the Case
being almost incurable otherwise, ex∣tremely
frightful and painful, from
some of the necessary</HI> Organs <HI>visibly
spoil'd and decay'd, and the Juices verge∣ing
towards</HI> Putrefaction: <HI>the strong∣est</HI>
Evacuants <HI>and</HI> Alteratives, <HI>with a</HI>
total Milk and Vegetable Diet, <HI>long
persisted in, was indispensably necessary.
The Medicines I have only</HI> hinted <HI>at,
to prevent the</HI> Quacking <HI>of Patients
themselves, but have pointed them out
so clearly, in General, that no Body
of common Sense and liberal Educa∣tion
can mistake them, in any thing
<PB N="266" REF="300"/>
but the</HI> compounding and doseing: <HI>and
that none but a regularly-bred</HI> Phy∣sician
<HI>can be sufficient for; and of the
Medicines, I have mentioned only the
preventive or extirpative ones. It
had been endless to have set down all
those prescrib'd under the Fits; these
I have sufficiently describ'd in the
former Part.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> TENDER <HI>young Gentleman,</HI> of great
Worth and Ingenuity, here in
our <HI>Neighbourhood,</HI> had from
his Infancy been troubled with
a most violent <HI>Nervous Head∣ach,</HI>
which returning at certain <HI>Periods,</HI>
overcame and sunk him to Extremity; and
even sometimes approached near to <HI>Epilep∣tick</HI>
Fits. I advised him, when seized with
them or it, to go to Bed as soon as he could
<PB N="268" REF="302"/>
conveniently, and to take four or five of
the <HI>Pilul. Gummos.</HI> and <HI>de Aloe Lotâ a ae. p.</HI>
and to drink plentifully of small Sack Whey,
or Water-Gruel, with <HI>Spt. C. C. Vol.</HI> Gutt. X
in each Draught, repeating the <HI>Pills</HI> every
Night till well, and after weekly, or as often
as his Illness ever returned; by which alone
he has been constantly relieved. I advised
him also to keep a very temperate (though
a common) Diet of <HI>Animal Foods,</HI> at Dinner
only, and not to drink above half a Pint, or
at most a Pint of Wine a Day, using constant
Exercise on Horseback, or otherwise. He
has continued this Method ever since, is in
the main well, and has grown yearly better
and stronger now for above these twenty
Years, and in all probability will grow
stronger and heartier to a great old Age.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2">
<HEAD>CASE II.</HEAD>
<P>A LADY of <HI>great Fortune</HI> in this Town,
<HI>eminent</HI> for her great <HI>Charity, Piety,</HI> and
<HI>fine Breeding,</HI> was originally of very weak
<HI>Nerves;</HI> her chief Complaints were, tender
<HI>Bowels,</HI> extreme low Spirits, with great
Sinking, and sometimes <HI>Hysterick Paroxysms</HI>
to an eminent Degree. Upon these last Oc∣casions,
I have given her several Medicines,
as the Case indicated; but for Prevention,
I prescribed only gentle <HI>Emeticks,</HI> when her
Stomach was loaded, <HI>Rhabarbarat</HI> and <HI>Car∣minative</HI>
Catharticks, Bath-Waters almost
<PB N="269" REF="303"/>
constantly now for near these twenty Years,
(for the Benefit of which she chose to
live here,) with constant Exercise, especi∣ally
on Horseback, and a <HI>Diet</HI> of the
plainest, lightest and most simple <HI>Animal
Foods,</HI> at Noon only, and a little of the best
<HI>French Wines;</HI> and by these Means she has
yearly grown better and stronger, and con∣tinues
to do so; her Disorders returning
now seldom, and being easily removed.</P>

<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>A GENTLEMAN <HI>of Scotland,</HI> eminent in
the <HI>Law,</HI> and of great <HI>Honour, Probity,
and fine Parts,</HI> had been long troubled
with a <HI>Nervous Headach;</HI> and having neg∣lected
it many Years, it came to such a
Height as was no longer tolerable. Besides
this almost incessant <HI>Headach,</HI> he had constant
extreme <HI>Lowness, Oppression,</HI> and at last the
greatest Difficulty to attend his Studies, or to
apply to the Business of his Profession; and
the Disorder terminated in <HI>Want of Sleep,</HI>
Loss of Appetite, and Inquietude; and all
these <HI>Symptoms</HI> brought him to such a State
as to render his Condition most miserable.
He came here, to <HI>Bath,</HI> in this Condition.
His Disorders were the most distinctly <HI>Peri∣odical</HI>
of any <HI>Nervous</HI> Case I had ever met
with, (though in most I have observed some∣thing
of that Nature.) One Night it was
extreme, so as to make him pass it almost
<PB N="270" REF="304"/>
entirely without Sleep; next Day an unex∣pressible
Lowness, and a constant <HI>Ptyalism</HI>
or spitting thin <HI>Rheum</HI> ensued, by which
the following Night was more tolerable,
and thus alternately. I prescribed several
<HI>Vomits, Quinquina-Bitters,</HI> the <HI>foetid Gums,</HI>
with the <HI>Extract of the Bark,</HI> and the <HI>Ani∣mal
Salts, Aloetick Purges,</HI> together with li∣quid
<HI>Steel</HI> in the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters. But above
all, a light, sparing Diet of tender <HI>Animal</HI> Food,
and at Noon only, and a very little <HI>Wine,</HI> with
constant <HI>Exercise</HI> on Horseback, or otherwise:
By these he was much relieved, while here;
and pursuing the same Method at Home,
for several Years: drinking in the hot Wea∣ther
the <HI>Mineral Chalybeat</HI> Waters of his
own Country, by slow Degrees he grew
perfectly well, and has for many Years en∣joyed
a complete State of Health, which
he preserves by great <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Exer∣cise.</HI></P>

<DIV4 N="4">
<HEAD>CASE IV.</HEAD>
<P>A LADY of the first <HI>Quality,</HI> and of

with these <HI>Sinkings, Anxiety,</HI> and <HI>Hysterick</HI>
Disorders, together with violent <HI>Colicks,
Watchings,</HI> and <HI>Inflation,</HI> as to be extremely
miserable. She had drank the Waters,
and taken Medicines a long Time here,
without any Relief, and was just despond∣ing,
and about leaving the Place. Being
<PB N="271" REF="305"/>
called, I ordered her to repeat some <HI>Vomits,</HI>
gave her <HI>Quinquina-Bitters with</HI> and <HI>without
Rhubarb</HI> daily, made her drink the <HI>Bath</HI> in
the Morning, and <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters with her
Meals; regulated her Diet both in Quantity
and Quality, confining it to the lightest,
youngest <HI>Animal</HI> Foods, and the least Wine
possible, and by continuing her in this Way
some time, she was recover'd to perfect
<HI>Health, Vivacity</HI> and <HI>Activity.</HI></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5">
<HEAD>CASE V.</HEAD>
<P>AN Officer's Lady of <HI>fine Parts</HI> and <HI>great
Worth,</HI> was sent here to drink the Waters,
for a constant <HI>Bilious</HI> Vomiting and <HI>Hyste∣rick
Lowness:</HI> She had been ordered by her
<HI>Physician</HI> to take an <HI>Ipecacohana</HI> Vomit every
Morning, (without any <HI>Restrictions</HI> on her
<HI>Diet,</HI>) which she had taken for some Time.
Being called, I told her, I thought it was
sufficient to repeat the <HI>Vomits</HI> when she had
an Urging and Sickness; and that when the
<HI>Choler</HI> was actually derived from the <HI>Liver</HI>
into the <HI>Stomach,</HI> that <HI>Symptom</HI> would in∣fallibly
happen, and then, and only then,
was a <HI>Vomit</HI> useful or necessary. I advised
her a <HI>Quinquinated and Rhabarbarated</HI> bitter
Wine, to be taken every Night, with a
weak liquid <HI>Steel</HI> in the Morning, and at
the same time regulated her Diet, and by
Degrees she recover'd perfectly.</P>

<HEAD>CASE VI.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG <HI>Lady</HI> from the West, had for
several Years so frequent <HI>Hysterick</HI> Fits and
<HI>Colicks,</HI> and to such a Degree, that they had
made her extremely miserable, and at last
crippled her both in <HI>Hands</HI> and <HI>Feet,</HI> (which
is common to <HI>Nervous</HI> Colicks,) so that they
were of no more Use to her, than if they
had been cut off. I repeated several <HI>Vomits</HI>
in the Course of the Waters; regulated her
Diet with Exactness to young Meats at Noon
only; gave her a <HI>Quinquinated Bitter</HI> before
Meals, and a <HI>Quinquinated and Rhabarbarated</HI>
Tincture daily at Night; and, in a proper
Time, gave her <HI>Steel</HI> in the Waters, and
made her pump both Hands and Legs, rub∣bing
them often after with the <HI>Opodeldoc</HI> dis∣solved
in <HI>Spirit of Wine camphorated;</HI> by these
Means only, in six Months, she perfectly re∣cover'd
both her Limbs and her Health.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Case</HI> was obstinate, and the
Patient young, firm or strong, and I was
left to my own Liberty, I always began
with the <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicines, continuing
them for Months, and finish'd with the <HI>Quin∣quinated
Bitters,</HI> or with <HI>Rhubarb</HI> and <HI>Bark</HI>
compounded with other Bitters, and liquid
Steel: And even in common, slight, <HI>Scorbuti∣cal,
Colical</HI> and <HI>Nervous,</HI> but especially <HI>Rheu∣matic,
Scrophulous</HI> or <HI>Cutaneous</HI> Cases, of such
as came here for the Benefit of the Waters, if
<PB N="273" REF="307"/>
not constrain'd, I always began with the <HI>pon∣derous</HI>
Medicines, or some one <HI>Preparation
of Mercury,</HI> or another, continued for some
Time, and only finish'd with the <HI>Bitter,
Astringent,</HI> and <HI>Chalybeat</HI> ones; but still regu∣lated
their Diet, without which I scarce ever
succeeded, even in the very slightest Cases.</P>

the <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Stomachick</HI> Medicines, pre∣scrib'd
by the most eminent <HI>Physicians</HI> in

<HI>Mineral Waters</HI> at different Times, and at
last a <HI>Tour</HI> (when he was near Sixty) thro'
the <HI>Southern Climates,</HI> came hither to <HI>Bath,</HI>
once and again; but without any lasting
Benefit or Relief, the same Miseries of this
sinking Distemper still persecuting him. I
at last persuaded him to enter upon a <HI>Trim∣ing
Diet,</HI> one Day light Pudding or <HI>Milk
and Vegetables</HI> dress'd, especially of the <HI>fari∣naceous
and seed</HI> Kind; the other, a little
<HI>young, tender, plain Animal Food</HI> for <HI>Dinner</HI>
only, and not to exceed two or three Glasses
of Wine a Day, taking sometimes <HI>Quinqui∣nated</HI>
and <HI>Rhabarbarated Bitters,</HI> and some∣times
<HI>Mineral Waters,</HI> as his Case required, to
wit, the <HI>Bath</HI> in temperate or cold Weather,
and the <HI>Cold</HI> (as <HI>Tunbridge, Spa</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont</HI>)
in hot Weather. By persisting in this Method,
he has recovered and grown better every

<P>A <HI>Gentleman</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of an <HI>Antient</HI>

of, all Mankind, was early in Life
subject to <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders, which, tho'
universal, did chiefly affect his <HI>Auditory Or∣gans,</HI>
so as to impair his Hearing. For this
he had try'd a great many <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>Dan∣gerous</HI>
Remedies, which, I think, had damag'd
an otherwise naturally clean and firm Consti∣tution.
After having serv'd his Country long

Fits</HI> and <HI>Paroxysms,</HI> the most severe,
terrible, and obstinate that I had ever seen.
At first, they return'd three or four times
every Day, <HI>shakeing</HI> and <HI>convulsing</HI> every
<HI>Limb, Muscle,</HI> and <HI>Organ</HI> of the whole Ma∣chine,
tho' all the Time his <HI>Senses</HI> and <HI>Fa∣culties</HI>
were sound and entire; only at their
going off, they left him <HI>languid, low,</HI> and
<HI>exhausted.</HI> He had try'd various Remedies,
and run through the whole <HI>Circle</HI> of the
<HI>nervous, volatile,</HI> and <HI>foetid</HI> Medicines, pre∣scrib'd
by the most eminent <HI>Physicians</HI> of the
whole Island. He came at last to <HI>Bath,</HI> and
was under my Care, and drank <HI>Bath,
<PB N="276" REF="310"/>
Bristol,</HI> and <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters occasionally,
for the Space of almost two Years: The
effectual Medicines, were <HI>Antimonial</HI> and
<HI>Ipecacuhana</HI> Vomits mix'd, which always
weaken'd or stop'd the <HI>Fits,</HI> (the Case, in
my Opinion, being chiefly an obstructed
<HI>schirrous Liver</HI>) with <HI>Calomel</HI> Purges, <HI>Gum</HI>
and <HI>Aloetick Pills, Quinquinated Bitters,</HI>
and sometimes <HI>Foetids</HI> and <HI>Volatiles,</HI> only as
a present Relief. These were the principal
Remedies which reliev'd, and, at last, cur'd
him; but what chiefly accomplish'd the Cure,
was that (of his own Accord, I not daring
to offer such an Advice to one who was so far
advanc'd in Life) he enter'd into a <HI>Trimming
Diet,</HI> chiefly of <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> with weak
Broths and Fish but sometimes, and two or
three Glasses of Wine at Dinner only, which
<HI>Regimen</HI> I much approv'd of and encourag'd.
After he had recover'd a tolerable good
State of Health, I advis'd him, both on his
own, and the Account of some others of his
Honourable Family, to finish the <HI>Cure,</HI> by
spending a Season or two at <HI>Spa,</HI> and win∣tering
in <HI>Italy;</HI> and now, by the Divine
Blessing, he is as Stout and Healthy as any
Man of his Age can possibly be, being free
from all his <HI>Nervous Symptoms,</HI> unless on
Accidents, and then by the same Method
and Medicines easily reliev'd.</P>

<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Knight Baronet</HI> of an <HI>Antient Family,</HI>
by keeping bad Hours, in attending upon
the Business of the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and living
freely about Town, had so worn down his
Constitution, that he run into an habitual
<HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> attended with extreme <HI>Flatulence,
Lowness, Oppression, Watchfulness,</HI> and <HI>In∣digestion.</HI>
These constantly returning upon
the least Excess, or catching Cold, had quite
enfeebled and enervated a formerly robust
and healthy Constitution, even into almost a
Nervous <HI>Atrophy.</HI> He had consulted again
and again the most eminent of the Profession,
but all the Benefit he reap'd was only a
<HI>temporary</HI> Relief, or having a <HI>Drag</HI> put upon
the Wheel, to prevent its running too fast
down the Hill. He at last came to <HI>Bath,</HI>
and was for a considerable Time under my
Direction, to try if he could by any Means
be assisted to a <HI>lasting Cure,</HI> he being then
not far past the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life, tho' wasted
and reduced from a <HI>round, muscular,</HI> and
<HI>brawny</HI> Natural Frame, almost to a <HI>Skeleton;</HI>
and his <HI>Alimentary Tube</HI> being so much re∣lax'd,
that the most moderate common Meal
of Butcher's Meat was too much for him, and
run off <HI>Crude,</HI> leaving him quite sunk and
flat. I was unwilling to advise him to a
total <HI>Milk and Vegetable Diet,</HI> being uncer∣tain
<PB N="278" REF="312"/>
if he would persevere, and knowing
well the Danger of a sudden Return; but put
him into a <HI>Trimming</HI> one, allowing him <HI>white
Meats</HI> some Days, and only light Pudding,
with Milk and Seeds other Days, with two
or three Glasses of Claret at <HI>Noon,</HI> and
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters tepid in a Morning, but
<HI>Bristol</HI> Waters at Meals, and only <HI>Vegetable
Seed Meats,</HI> with Milk, for Breakfast and
Supper; giving him, at the same Time, <HI>Ve∣getable</HI>
Astringent Medicines, and sometimes
gentle <HI>Vomits, Testaceous</HI> Powders, and <HI>toasted
Rhubarb</HI> with <HI>Diascordium.</HI> Under this <HI>Re∣gimen
and Medicines,</HI> (with constant riding a
Horseback in the Forenoon,) he grew bet∣ter
by Degrees, his <HI>Diarrhoea</HI> became more
moderate, his <HI>Spirits</HI> brisker, and his <HI>Sleep</HI>
longer and sounder. He continued thus the
whole <HI>Winter,</HI> and next <HI>Summer,</HI> tho' thin
and low, yet not to such a Degree as before;
in the <HI>hot</HI> Weather he drank <HI>Spa</HI> Water,
with a liquid, weak <HI>Quinquinated Chalybeat.</HI>
Next <HI>Winter</HI> I advis'd him to go to the
<HI>South of France,</HI> where he continued a Year
or two, under the same <HI>Regimen</HI> and Medi∣cines,
came Home much mended in <HI>Flesh</HI> and
<HI>Spirits,</HI> and by Degrees acquir'd an <HI>Athle∣tick</HI>
State of Health; and has been these
twenty Years a hale, strong, fine Gentleman,
on common plain Diet, with due Temperance.</P>

<P>A <HI>Worthy</HI> Merchant of the <HI>North of Eng∣land,</HI>
came here to <HI>Bath</HI> for my Advice, in a
most deplorable State, <HI>viz.</HI> a total Loss of
Appetite, exceeding low Spirits: He had
<HI>Rigors</HI> and Night Sweats, a fix'd <HI>Melancholy,
Terror,</HI> and <HI>Dread,</HI> a violent <HI>Headach,</HI> and
a want of Natural Sleep, with <HI>Faintings</HI> and
<HI>Paralytick</HI> Numbnesses, and, in a Word, all
the Symptoms of the mentioned <HI>second Stage</HI> of
these <HI>Nervous</HI> Disorders. I repeated <HI>Vomits</HI>
often, gave him <HI>Quinquinated Bitter Wines,
Liquid Chalybeats,</HI> sometimes <HI>Hiera Picra,
Tincture of Rhubarb</HI> with <HI>Bark, Aromaticks</HI> and
<HI>Bitters</HI> of several Sorts, sometimes the <HI>Gum</HI>
with <HI>Aloetick Pills; Bath</HI> Waters in a Morn∣ing,

Meals, and especially a rigid, <HI>alternate,</HI> vege∣table,
and young <HI>Animal</HI> Food Diet, with con∣stant
<HI>Exercise</HI> of one Kind or other. Under
this Method he got perfectly well and chear∣ful
in five or fix Months, and has continued so
these several Years.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5">
<HEAD>CASE V.</HEAD>
<P>A young Lady from the <HI>Western Sea-Coast</HI>
came here miserably oppress'd with
<HI>Sinking, Lowness, Porraceous</HI> Vomitings,
frequent <HI>Rigors</HI> and Chills, succeeded by
<PB N="280" REF="314"/>
<HI>feverish</HI> Heats, <HI>Restlesness</HI> and <HI>Anxiety.</HI> I
try'd gentle <HI>Vomits, Quinquinated Bitters,</HI>
with and without <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> several Kinds
of the slightest <HI>Chalybeats,</HI> as <HI>Lac Mart.
Vitriol. Mart. Elixir Vitrioli,</HI> and <HI>Tinctura
Antiphthisica, Spa</HI> and <HI>Pyrmont Waters, Vin.
Chalybeatum,</HI> with <HI>Volatiles</HI> and <HI>Foetids,</HI> and va∣rious
Kinds of Bitters, but all without Success.
I found, upon Observation, that she was
always worst about five or six in the After∣noon,
to wit, after the great Meal, and that
her <HI>feverish Paroxysms</HI> came on as the Day
wore out, and rose higher in the Course of
the Digestion, till towards the Morning. I
learned likewise, that she eat and drank too
heartily and fully for one of her Constitution
and Complaints, three times a Day, (the
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters, and the <HI>mention'd Medicines</HI>
giving her a <HI>Craving.</HI>) Upon this, being
satisfied that all her Symptoms proceeded
from her Difficulty in Digestion, (as almost
all such <HI>hysteric</HI> Cases do) I confin'd her to
Broths, with light Pudding, and the small
fresh River Fish, and at <HI>Dinner</HI> only, and
<HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Food for Breakfast and
Supper, allowing her little or no Wine, but
<HI>Spa</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters for Drink at Meals;
for I have always found <HI>Bath</HI> in the
Morning, and <HI>Spa</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont</HI> at Dinner,
a most effectual Method in such Cases. By
continuing the mention'd Diet and Medi∣cines,
as the <HI>Symptoms</HI> indicated, in two
<PB N="281" REF="315"/>
Months she became perfectly well and free
of all her <HI>Lowness, Faintings, Fits,</HI> and
<HI>feverish Heats,</HI> and went away fresh, chear∣ful
and strong,</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6">
<HEAD>CASE VI.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Gentleman</HI> of fine Parts, grievously
afflicted with the <HI>Gout,</HI> and with a perpe∣tual
<HI>Lowness, Sinking,</HI> and <HI>Oppression,</HI> both
in Fits and the <HI>Intervals:</HI> to wit, a constant
Sickness and Reaching before the Forma∣tion,
and after the Fit was over; and for a
long time after, a much longer (than is com∣mon)
<HI>Sickness, Inappetency,</HI> Weakness, and
greater Lameness: so as to be one half of
the Year almost under its Effects; and being
weary of a Life under such Miseries, he was
willing to attempt any thing probable to
mitigate them. But being justly afraid of a
<HI>total Milk and Vegetable Diet,</HI> lest by relaxing
and cooling too fast, the thus inflamed Solids,
he might give occasion to the <HI>Bilious</HI> and
<HI>Goutish</HI> Humours and Salts, to flow too fast
upon the common <HI>Shoar</HI> of the <HI>Stomach and
Bowels,</HI> and there to beget <HI>Sickness, Pain,</HI> and
Danger; therefore a <HI>trimming</HI> and middling
Diet being propos'd, chiefly of light, fresh
River Fish, (as least inflaming, and not over∣enriching
the Juices) alternately with Milk
and Vegetables: and every Day the Value of
a <HI>Pint</HI> of some generous, soft, balsamick
<PB N="282" REF="316"/>
Wine, (as <HI>Sack, Canary,</HI> or <HI>Palm</HI>) he readi∣ly
and chearfully enter'd upon it. This <HI>Me∣thod</HI>
abated both the <HI>Violence, Duration,</HI> and
Frequency of his <HI>Fits</HI> in a few Years,
without any Danger; and by Degrees
effectually remov'd these Vomitings and Sick∣nesses
with which the Fits began and termi∣nated:
especially, by almost every Night
taking a few Spoonfuls of a <HI>Rhubarb</HI> and
<HI>Bark</HI> Bitter, made on Wine with Aroma∣ticks,
in the Intervals; and he has now only
a very tolerable, short, regular Fit once a
Year, and soon gets about his Business again,
and is in likelihood to go on with Health
and Strength to a great Age.</P>
<P>I CANNOT omit here to observe, that if any
Person designs, either for the Sake of <HI>Health,
Long-Life,</HI> or Freedom from Diseases, to re∣gulate
his Diet, I universally prefer to all
others this <HI>trimming</HI> Method, of an <HI>alternate</HI>
Diet of <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> one Day, and the
other plain or young <HI>Animal</HI> Food, and a mo∣derate
Portion of <HI>Wine;</HI> for if his Case requires
his descending still lower, yet this <HI>trimming
Diet</HI> will be the best and safest first Step
to begin with; and if his Recovery there∣by
be so perfect, that he may rise to a
higher Diet, this will make the <HI>Transition</HI>
safer; and even those who love palatable
and delicious Foods, to a great Degree,
will bear a <HI>Maigre</HI> Day more easily, when
<PB N="283" REF="317"/>
they know they shall have a <HI>Gaudy</HI> one the
next; and I have known those, who from
a weak <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Cachectic</HI> Habit have
arriv'd to a confirm'd State of Health, noble
Spirits, and great Age, by this <HI>Trick</HI> alone;
so that Fasting and Abstinence in this Man∣ner,
might seem not more a <HI>religious</HI> than it

<P>A Young <HI>Lady</HI> under my Direction,

and too <HI>strong</HI> and high <HI>Food</HI> while

<HI>Laughing, Dancing,</HI> and all <HI>Jollity,</HI>
at other times <HI>Weeping, Crying, Sighing,</HI> and

again <HI>Hot</HI> and <HI>Feverish;</HI> sometimes great

<HI>high-colour'd</HI> Water; sometimes <HI>Costiveness</HI> to

<HI>slippery</HI> Bowels; and most, if not all these
Symptoms, sometimes three or four times in
<PB N="285" REF="319"/>
twenty-four Hours, insomuch that ignorant
People thought it <HI>Witchcraft</HI> and <HI>Inchant∣ment.</HI>
Various <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Antihysterical</HI>
Medicines had been prescrib'd by the <HI>Phy∣sician</HI>
in Ordinary at <HI>London,</HI> which had
reliev'd and eas'd her for a Time, but still
she relaps'd in a Month or two; and <HI>Ride∣ing,
Country Air,</HI> and even Changes of that
<HI>Air</HI> were try'd with little or no Success.
At last, her Parents being under the greatest
Concern about her, and fearing lest her Fa∣culties
(which were above <HI>Mediocrity</HI>) might
be impair'd by so tedious and unaccountable
a Distemper, put her intirely under my Care,
with an absolute Power to do by her, both in
<HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Medicines,</HI> as I should think best.
I first try'd all the common <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>An∣tihysterical</HI>
Medicines over again, under a
common Diet, with no Manner of Benefit.
But tir'd out at last, I resolved to put her
upon an entire <HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI> without <HI>Flesh,
Fish,</HI> or <HI>fermented Liquors;</HI> Milk she lik'd
not, besides, by its Curdling on a <HI>bilious
Stomach,</HI> it both inflated and made her more
sick; the only Medicines I ever after used
in the whole Course, were gentle <HI>Vomits,</HI>
when the <HI>Bile</HI> seem'd to be gathered or flow
(which she always found by a greater De∣gree
of Sickness, Oppression, and a greater
than ordinary <HI>Headach</HI> that recurred <HI>Month∣ly</HI>)
and a constant Course of <HI>Cinnabar,</HI> fresh
and finely levigated, half a Dram Morning

in the temperate, and <HI>Pyrmont</HI> in the hot

other times <HI>Walking,</HI> as she could best like,
or could bear them. After the first <HI>Month</HI>
of this <HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Medicines,</HI> she never had
any one Fit more to be observed; sometimes
indeed she had a good deal of <HI>Lowness,
Headach,</HI> or <HI>Sickness,</HI> but a <HI>Vomit</HI> always
relieved her. By going on steadily in this
Course, she grew sensibly better every two
or three Months, and in less than two Years
was perfectly cured of all her Complaints,
and then returned to common Life, though
with great <HI>Care, Caution, and exact Tem∣perance,</HI>
drinking not above a Glass or two

only the tender, young <HI>Animal Foods,</HI> be∣ing

<HEAD>CASE II.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Young Lady</HI> of an Honourable and Opu∣lent
Family, and of the most distinguish'd
Merit, and the finest Parts I ever knew in
the Sex, had from her <HI>Parents</HI> inhe∣rited
<PB N="287" REF="321"/>
<HI>weak Nerves,</HI> which, for want of
due Care and proper Management, brought
on at last the most violent, extreme, and
obstinate <HI>Nervous Paroxysms,</HI> (with their
whole Circle of <HI>Symptoms</HI>) I had ever seen.
She had been naturally of a <HI>thin Habit,</HI> but
of a sudden had grown excessively Fat; and
had had often Threatnings, and sometimes
pretty long Seizures of the same Class of Dis∣orders
before; which from time to time other
Physicians, and often I, had cured by the com∣mon
Medicines, <HI>viz. Vomits, Volatiles, Cha∣lybeats,
Bitters, Pyrmont and Bath Waters,</HI>
with gentle <HI>Evacuations.</HI> But at last all
these <HI>Nervous Symptoms</HI> became so extremely
obstinate, frightful, and painful, that nei∣ther
I, nor any other of her <HI>Physicians</HI> (of
whom she had consulted many) could pro∣cure
her any lasting Reprieve. She came
at last to <HI>Bath,</HI> where I had often had the
Honour to direct her, and the rest of the
Family for many Years; the Waters with
<HI>Quinquinated Bitters,</HI> and <HI>Pilul. Gummos.
cum Aloe lotâ,</HI> at first gave her the most sen∣sible
and longest Relief, but at last they
fail'd also. I afterwards try'd the greatest
and most extensive Variety of <HI>Nervous</HI> Me∣dicines,
I had ever us'd in any such Case,
since I first practised Physick. I try'd over
and over all the Tribe of the <HI>Nervous, An∣tihysterical,</HI>
and <HI>De-obstruent</HI> Medicines,
<PB N="288" REF="322"/>
<HI>Bitters, Volatiles, Chalybeats, Foetids, Al∣teratives;</HI>
all Kinds of <HI>Evacuations,</HI> (as
<HI>Bleeding, Blistering, Vomiting</HI> again and
again) together with the <HI>Ponderous, Mineral</HI>
and <HI>Mercurial</HI> Medicines of all the proper
Preparations, and at last even <HI>Opiates</HI> them∣selves,
combined with all the <HI>Antihystericks:</HI>
Indeed every thing I had ever used, heard of,
or read in approv'd Authors, and each of these
for a Time sufficient for Trial. Notwith∣standing
all this, her torturing <HI>Headachs,</HI>
her constant <HI>screaming Fits, burning Heats,
sleepless Nights, Terrors,</HI> and other inex∣pressible
Sufferings, were intolerable and in∣supportable.
I was in the utmost Concern
and Anxiety about her, and knew not what
Hand to turn me: for tho' other <HI>Physi∣cians</HI>
had been join'd, yet, I having been
hitherto always successful in the Family, they
did me the Honour to place a particular
Confidence in me, and I was as heartily and
warmly desirous of serving them successful∣ly.
At last (after above a Year spent un∣der
this Method and these Medicines) I
told them and her, that I had but one
thing more to propose, which I had done
long before, but that she had been often
and strongly caution'd and warn'd against
it, and I was afraid neither she nor her
Friends would willingly come into it, after
so many, so weighty Remonstrances a∣gainst
it, and from those whose Duty it
<PB N="289" REF="323"/>
was to direct her, so that I was willing to have
effected the Cure by the common Means and
Medicines, but found they would not do;
and therefore I told her at last plainly,
that the only Hopes of her Recovery was
from a total <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Diet, and
Abstinence from all fermented Liquors, but
as a <HI>Cordial.</HI> I met indeed with a readier
Compliance on all sides than I had expected;
and accordingly the <HI>Lady</HI> went chearfully
into a total <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Diet, and in
less than three Months she was much better,
in six Months tolerably well, and in nine
Months almost perfectly well; this chiefly
by her cool Diet, for after she enter'd upon
it, she had occasion to take very few Me∣dicines,
so that she went away with no
other Directions, but the Continuance of
<HI>gentle Vomits</HI> when required, <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Wa∣ters
for her common Drink, and Perseve∣rance
in her <HI>Diet:</HI> with the <HI>Gum and Aloe∣tick
Pills</HI> on transient Disorders. The <HI>pon∣derous</HI>
Medicines she had long taken at first,
had made the <HI>Liver</HI> pervious, (which had
been evidently obstructed before,) so that
there was constantly <HI>Choler</HI> poured out into
the Stomach for a long Time after, which made
<HI>Vomits</HI> sometimes necessary to discharge it.
I hear she continues extremely well, without
any means but her <HI>Diet</HI> and these few
Medicines on Occasions with Exercise, and
grows more hardy, active, and chearful, as
<PB N="290" REF="324"/>
I was certain she would, and doubt not
she will long continue so.</P>

<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Gentleman of Fortune,</HI> and an <HI>Officer</HI> of
<HI>Distinction</HI> in the <HI>Army,</HI> was afflicted with
the most painful and frightful <HI>Colicks</HI> I had
ever known, which often terminated in <HI>Epi∣leptick
Fits.</HI> Some of his Family, about the
same Time (<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Meridian</HI>) of Life, had
died of the same Sort of <HI>convulsive</HI> and <HI>ner∣vous
Colick,</HI> which had justly made him the
more cautious and careful. He came here
to <HI>Bath,</HI> to put himself under my Di∣rection:
I at first try'd with the Waters,
all the common <HI>Nervous</HI> Medicines, as <HI>Quin∣quinated
Bitters, Volatiles, Foetids,</HI> and <HI>Al∣teratives</HI>
of the <HI>mineral</HI> Tribe of all
Kinds, and in all the Shapes I could con∣trive;
besides constant riding, on <HI>Chalybeats</HI>
(which always makes them more effec∣tual)
but all without Success: So that
I have often seen him rolling on the
Ground in <HI>Agonies,</HI> crying out to put an
End to his Pains any how. Nothing gave
him Ease, except great Doses of warm
<HI>Opiats</HI> in strong <HI>Nervous Cordials,</HI> and
they always left him dispirited, low, and
restless, even to Extremity. I was willing
to try every thing first, before I propo∣sed
the <HI>last Remedy;</HI> for I never found
<PB N="291" REF="325"/>
any one would come into it, till their
Sufferings were <HI>extreme,</HI> and that they
found nothing else would do, and so were
brought to be willing to purchase Ease at
any Rate. <HI>Gold may be bought too dear;</HI> and
as long as <HI>common Remedies,</HI> and <HI>common
Life</HI> will do, I own, it is not reasonable to
expect that any should submit to <HI>uncommon
and extraordinary Methods. Dying</HI> alone, is
not so terrible to an honest and good Man;
tho' all the <HI>Bounces</HI> about it, I have some∣times
heard, seem really <HI>unnatural,</HI> and pass
with me for nothing; the <HI>Author</HI> of our
<HI>Nature</HI> has wisely implanted the <HI>Terror of
Death</HI> in us, to support our Endeavours of
living under the many Miseries and Misfor∣tunes
of our present Imprisonment; the only
Misfortune is, when we come too late in the
Application of this <HI>last Remedy,</HI> and the
Time is elaps'd for a perfect Recovery.
This <HI>Gentleman,</HI> being one of finely <HI>cultiva∣ted
Parts,</HI> as well as of good, sound natural
Sense, comply'd more readily than I expected
from a Gentleman of his <HI>Profession:</HI> when I
propos'd a <HI>Milk and Vegetable Diet,</HI> as the
<HI>sole Means</HI> left for his total Recovery from
all his Complaints, and for a firm State of
future Health. When he enter'd upon it at
first, his <HI>Appetite</HI> was quite gone, so that
he lived in it for some time on the least I ever
knew a Man do. I have known him pass
<HI>many Weeks,</HI> and <HI>some Months,</HI> with a little
<PB N="292" REF="326"/>
<HI>Bohea Tea,</HI> and a small Cup of <HI>Milk,</HI> with
about half a Penny Roll, without Butter, for
<HI>Breakfast:</HI> and about a <HI>Pint</HI> of boil'd Milk,
with scarce a whole <HI>Roll</HI> for <HI>Dinner;</HI> and
his <HI>Supper</HI> (if any) was two or three Spoon∣fuls
of <HI>Honey</HI> boil'd and skim'd in a <HI>Pint</HI> of
Water, with a Slice or two of a <HI>Penny Roll</HI>
toasted; and he told me, he found <HI>Honey</HI>
thus boil'd in Water, and thus <HI>skim'd</HI> and
<HI>defaecated,</HI> one of the most <HI>heartening</HI> and
enlivening Meals he could then take; and
certainly this is an excellent Method to take
off the <HI>Rawness, Crudity,</HI> and <HI>Colicking</HI>
Quality of <HI>Honey,</HI> which being a Kind of Na∣tural
Balsam or <HI>inspissated Juice</HI> of the Meal
of young <HI>Vegetables</HI> on the <HI>Blossoms of Plants;</HI>
is consequently, when thus boil'd, skim'd,
and diluted, a most excellent tender Food
for weak Stomachs. After passing a <HI>Winter</HI>
at <HI>Bath,</HI> to inure him to this <HI>Regimen,</HI> re∣peating
<HI>Vomits</HI> and <HI>warm Opiats</HI> on <HI>Pa∣roxysms,</HI>
Rideing, and Drinking the <HI>Bath</HI>-Waters,
I sent him through the <HI>South of
France</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> where, being out of the
Way of Temptation, and an <HI>ingenious, well-educated
Gentleman,</HI> he passed his Time both
agreeably and usefully; and after about two
Years stay, he brought Home with him a
sound, firm <HI>Vegetable</HI> Constitution, and a
Stock of useful Knowledge, for the Orna∣ment
of the Country he resides in, and has been
now Healthy for many Years; (and Father

<HEAD>CASE IV.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Gentleman of Wales,</HI> of strong <HI>natural
Parts</HI> and <HI>great Ingenuity,</HI> but descended of
a <HI>Gouty</HI> Family, was early in Life seized
with that Disorder, which in a few Years
rose to such Height, that he was almost con∣stantly
confined to his Bed by it, at least for
<HI>eight</HI> or <HI>ten</HI> Months in the Year; and when
his <HI>Hands, Feet, Knees, Hips</HI> or <HI>Shoul∣der
Joints</HI> were not affected, it was in his
<HI>Head, Stomach,</HI> or <HI>Bowels,</HI> so that he had
no Ease but from pouring down constantly
great <HI>Doses</HI> of strong <HI>Wines, Drams,</HI> or
<HI>Cordials.</HI> Thus wearied out, crippled, and
crucified, he came here to <HI>Bath,</HI> to be un∣der
my Direction; ready and willing to sub∣mit
to any <HI>Discipline</HI> or <HI>Self-denial</HI> I should
prescribe, to get, at least Ease, if not rid, of
so tormenting a Distemper. As he was in
this Disposition, I put him immediately on a
<HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI> (it being in Summer, and he
then in his <HI>lucid Interval.</HI>) Besides the <HI>Diet,</HI>
I gave him a medicated opening Wine, with
<HI>Rhubarb, Quinquina, Aromaticks</HI> and <HI>Bitters;</HI>
(or a Kind of <HI>Lower's Tincture,</HI> without <HI>Steel</HI>)
this, with the Waters, I designed should
cleanse the <HI>Primae Viae</HI> throughly, and lessen
the Quantity and <HI>Acrimony</HI> of the <HI>Arthritick
<PB N="294" REF="328"/>
Salts</HI> by degrees. He continued here four or
five Months, drinking the Waters, and useing
this Medicine, by which his next <HI>Fit</HI> was less
painful and dureable; and he has kept to this
<HI>Regimen,</HI> and these Medicines, under some
Form or other, at times, ever since. In the <HI>Fit</HI>
I ordered him to drink plentifully of <HI>small
Sack Whey</HI> or <HI>Sage Posset,</HI> with <HI>Hartshorn</HI>
Drops, and to live mostly on the Seed and
Meal Meats then, (as <HI>Bread, Pudding, Water-Gruel,
Panada, Rice,</HI> and <HI>Sago,</HI> with or
without Milk;) in the <HI>Intervals</HI> of the <HI>Fits,</HI>
on <HI>Milk, Fruit, Roots,</HI> and <HI>Herbs,</HI> and to
take often the <HI>medicated Wine</HI> I have men∣tioned,
and on Occasions the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters,
with the constant Use of the <HI>Flesh Brush.</HI>
By this Method he has not only recovered
the Use of his Limbs in a great Degree, and
in the long Intervals, is as <HI>lightsome, chearful,</HI>
and <HI>happy</HI> as any Man can be, after having
been so long <HI>crippled</HI> by so violent <HI>Hereditary</HI>
a Distemper. His <HI>Fits</HI> are with very mode∣rate
Pain and little <HI>Inflammation,</HI> and their
coming on and going off, is with little or no
Sickness. He looks <HI>healthy, hearty,</HI> and
<HI>chearful,</HI> and, I believe, would not change
his present Life, for his past, for the greatest
sensual Gratifications; he is now yearly grow∣ing
better, and is like to hold it out to a <HI>great</HI>
and <HI>green old Age;</HI> whereas formerly, under
the Management he was forced to use for
<PB N="295" REF="329"/>
Relief, he could have held it but a very
few miserable Years.</P>

<HEAD>CASE V.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>dignified Clergyman,</HI> of great <HI>Learning</HI>
and <HI>Worth,</HI> well known by his <HI>excellent
Works,</HI> had naturally a great deal of <HI>Spirit</HI>
and <HI>Fire,</HI> but by a <HI>sedentary</HI> and <HI>studious</HI>
Life, had brought on <HI>Flatulence, Giddiness,</HI>
Oppression, Lowness, and Anxiety to a great
Degree, by which he had been long op∣pressed.
He had been always very tempe∣rate,
of a slight tender Make, but of late
had grown very thin, dry, and was run∣ning
almost into a <HI>Scorbutical</HI> and <HI>Nervous
Atrophy.</HI> I had advis'd him formerly in the
best Manner I could, sometimes the <HI>Gum
Pills,</HI> with an <HI>Aloetick,</HI> sometimes <HI>Sylphium,</HI>
or <HI>Steel and Bitters,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Spa,
Pyrmont,</HI> or <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, by which he had
been much reliev'd; but at last none of
these, nor any thing I could suggest, would
have any dureable Effect. In fine, I told
him, that nothing, in my Opinion, but a
total <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Diet could effectu∣ally
and entirely cure and restore him, which
he readily and chearfully complied with,
and entered upon directly, being, as I said,
<HI>thin</HI> and <HI>temperate,</HI> and without <HI>gross Hu∣mours.</HI>
So he had no Reason to expect any
<HI>Dispumatory</HI> Fits by this Method▪ And with no
<PB N="296" REF="330"/>
other Assistance from <HI>Art,</HI> but sometimes
an <HI>Aloetick Pill,</HI> or the <HI>Rheum Quinqui∣natum,</HI>
he got in a very short Time <HI>easy,
chearful,</HI> of full and free Spirits, and capa∣ble
of any Degree of Application and Study,
without Weariness and Oppression, and
without the Necessity of that <HI>Posting</HI> Life of
<HI>Horse-Service,</HI> so necessary to carry off the
superfluous Load in others, under the same
Kind of Complaints, and in a full and free
<HI>Diet.</HI> He is now like to continue long
healthy, chearful, and lively.</P>

<HEAD>CASE VI.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Gentleman's Lady of Oxfordshire,</HI> of as
much <HI>Virtue, Piety, Charity,</HI> and good
Sense, as any one I ever was acquainted
with, came here to <HI>Bath,</HI> for <HI>schirrous Knots</HI>
and <HI>Tumors</HI> in her Breast, which both I and
other <HI>Physicians</HI> believed to be a Threatning
or Beginning <HI>Cancer.</HI> I tried here with her
<HI>Cinnabar, Milliped, Lenitive Electuary, Dia∣cassia
cum Manna,</HI> and other cooling and soft
<HI>Openers,</HI> with a regulated young <HI>Animal
Food Diet,</HI> and a very little <HI>Wine,</HI> under
the Course of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, which she
pursued here for many Weeks with great
Exactness and considerable Benefit. I ad∣vised
her to continue the same Medicines at
Home, with <HI>Asses Milk</HI> and <HI>Bristol Waters,</HI>
which she persisted in all that <HI>Winter;</HI> but
<PB N="297" REF="331"/>
towards <HI>Spring</HI> her <HI>Pains</HI> and <HI>Shootings</HI> be∣came
more intense and frequent, being
attended with a Cough, by which she began
to be alarmed, as far as one of her admirable
<HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Resignation</HI> could be. I then
told her plainly, that nothing but a <HI>total
Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable Diet</HI> could save her from
a <HI>Cancer,</HI> which she most implicitly submit∣ted
to, and has continued in ever since, and
is now become the most <HI>lively, easy,</HI> and

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Objections against a Regimen,
especially a Milk, Seed, and Vege∣table
Diet, considered.</HEAD>
<P>I. MANY more Cases I could men∣tion,
of such as, in the like
<HI>Distempers</HI> with these here spe∣cified,
have actually obtained under my
Direction a <HI>lasting and solid Cure,</HI> by a Regi∣men
<PB N="298" REF="332"/>
of <HI>Diet</HI> and such <HI>Medicines,</HI> as I have
hinted. But if these will not satisfy my Rea∣der,
<HI>Volumes</HI> of <HI>Cases</HI> would not; they will
be sufficient for the <HI>Candid Miserable</HI> and <HI>Sin∣cere;</HI>
the <HI>Captious Healthy,</HI> and the <HI>Diffident,</HI>
nothing I can say will satisfy. It is certain
none will undertake such a <HI>Method,</HI> till they
have found all others vain and ineffectual;
nor can I blame any one for so doing: If the
Gratification of their <HI>Palate</HI> and <HI>Taste</HI> be of
greater Pleasure to them than their Sufferings
are of Pain, they are as yet unfit for any such
Regimen or <HI>Method;</HI> they must be <HI>worse,</HI> be∣fore
they can be <HI>better.</HI> I think it pretty cer∣tain
from the Way of Living of the <HI>lower</HI> Rank
of all Nations, that such a <HI>Regimen</HI> will not
directly <HI>kill</HI> or <HI>starve</HI> any thing but <HI>Distem∣pers:</HI>
Unless the <HI>Wound</HI> be actually <HI>mortal</HI> and
<HI>incureable</HI> in its own Nature and Degree: and
even then it will prolong their <HI>Days,</HI> and make
their <HI>Passage</HI> less miserable and painful, than
any other Method; and I daily see many
wretched Persons <HI>complaining, grumbling,</HI> and
inwardly cursing the <HI>Creator</HI> of the <HI>Universe</HI>
for their Miseries and Sufferings, who I am
<HI>morally</HI> and <HI>medically</HI> certain, bring all their
Wretchedness on themselves, by constantly
over-loading, bursting and cramming the <HI>poor
passive Machine:</HI> and who, by the Methods and
Medicines I have mentioned, might be made
<HI>easy, chearful,</HI> and <HI>happy,</HI> tho' not perhaps al∣ways
at <HI>first,</HI> (unless they have few <HI>Humours</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="333"/>
or <HI>Salts</HI> in their Juices) yet surely in <HI>some Time.</HI>
A <HI>vegetable Patient</HI> of mine, very justly ob∣served
to me, that whereas before, he could
never trust his Appetite's Longings or Craving,
while on an <HI>animal high Diet,</HI> without suffer∣ing
to Extremity: Now he found, he might
safely and securely trust Nature and Appe∣tite,
without Danger, Fear or Suffering.
Others I have known, who having entered
upon, and being in some Degree recovered by
this Method and these Medicines, yet have
continued Weak, Poor, and Valetudinary all
their Days, for Want of <HI>Resolution</HI> and <HI>Per∣severance</HI>
in it, by being divided and frightened
by the unexperienced <HI>Gainsayers.</HI> But in about
thirty Years <HI>Practice,</HI> in which I have in some
Degree or other, advised this Method in pro∣per
Cases, I have had but two <HI>Patients,</HI> in
whose total Recovery, I have been mistaken,
and theirs were both <HI>scrophulous Cases,</HI> where
the <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Tubercules</HI> were so many, so
<HI>hard</HI> and <HI>impervious,</HI> that even the <HI>ponderous</HI>
Remedies and <HI>Diet</HI> joined, could not discuss
them, and they were <HI>both</HI> also too far gone
before they entered upon them; and I have
found deep <HI>scrophulous</HI> Vapours, the most ob∣stinate
and perverse of any of this <HI>Tribe</HI> of these
Distempers: and indeed nothing can possibly
reach such, but the <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicines, joined
with a <HI>liquid, cool, soft Milk and Seed Regi∣men;</HI>
and if these <HI>two</HI> do not in due Time,
I can boldly affirm it, nothing ever will.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="334"/>
II. ONE of the most terrible Objections, some
weak Persons make against this <HI>Regimen</HI> and
<HI>Method,</HI> is, that upon accidental <HI>Trials,</HI> they
have always found <HI>Milk, Fruit,</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI>
so inflate, blow them up, and raise such <HI>Tu∣mults</HI>
and <HI>Tempests</HI> in their Stomach and Bow∣els,
that they have been terrified and affrighted
from going on. I own the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Fact</HI> to
be such in some as is represented: And that in
<HI>Stomachs</HI> and <HI>Entrails</HI> inured only to hot and
high Meats and Drinks, and consequently in an
<HI>inflammatory</HI> State, and full of <HI>Choler</HI> and
<HI>Phlegm,</HI> this <HI>Sensation</HI> will sometimes happen;
just as a Bottle of <HI>Cyder</HI> or <HI>fretting Wine,</HI> when
the Cork is pulled out, will fly up, fume, and
rage: And if you throw in a little <HI>Ferment</HI> or
<HI>Acid,</HI> (such are <HI>Milk, Seeds, Fruit</HI> and <HI>Vege∣tables</HI>
to them) the <HI>Effervescence</HI> and <HI>Tempest</HI>
will exasperate to a <HI>Hurricane.</HI> But what is
Wind, Flatulence, Flegm, and Choler? But
stopp'd <HI>Perspiration,</HI> superfluous Nourishment,
inconcocted <HI>Chyle</HI> of high Food and strong Li∣quors,
fermenting and putrifying? And when
these are shut up and cork'd, with still more and
more solid, strong, hot, and <HI>styptick</HI> Meats and
Drinks, is the Corruption and Putrefaction
thereby lessened? Will it not then at last
either burst the Vessel or throw out the Cork
or Stoples, and raise more lasting and cruel
<HI>Tempests</HI> and <HI>Tumults?</HI> Are <HI>Milk and Vegeta∣bles,</HI>
Seeds and Fruits, harder of Digestion,
<PB N="301" REF="335"/>
more <HI>Corrosive,</HI> or more capable of producing
<HI>Chyle, Blood,</HI> and Juices, less fit to <HI>circulate,</HI>
to <HI>perspire,</HI> and be <HI>secreted?</HI> But what is to be
done? The <HI>Cure</HI> is obvious. Begin by De∣grees,
Eat less <HI>Animal</HI> Food: the most tender
and young, and drink less strong fermented Li∣quors
for a Month or two; then proceed to a
<HI>trimming</HI> Diet, of one Day <HI>Seed</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
and another, tender young <HI>Animal</HI> Food; in
the mean Time take frequent gentle <HI>Wash-Vo∣mits,</HI>
and <HI>Rhubarb</HI> and <HI>Bark</HI> Stomach Purges;
drink <HI>Mineral</HI> and <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Waters, and <HI>Aque∣ous
Bitters;</HI> take <HI>Testaceous</HI> Powders and <HI>Al∣kaline
Earths,</HI> and then by Degrees slide into a
total <HI>Milk, Seed, and Vegetable Diet:</HI> Cooling
the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Entrails</HI> gradually, to fit
them for this soft, mild, sweetening <HI>Regimen;</HI>
and in Time your Diet will give you all the
<HI>Gratification</HI> you ever had from <HI>strong, high,
and rank</HI> Foods and <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors: And
you will enjoy to the Bargain at last,
<HI>Ease, free Spirits, perfect Health,</HI> and <HI>long
Life. Milk</HI> of all Kinds, and <HI>Seeds,</HI> are
fittest to begin with in such Cases, when
dried, finely ground and dress'd, and con∣sequently
the least <HI>flatulent.</HI> Lessen the
Quantity even of these, under what your
Appetite would require, at least for a Time.
<HI>Bear a little, and forbear, Virtue</HI> and <HI>good
Health</HI> are not to be obtain'd without some
Labour and Pains against contrary Habits.
It was a wild <HI>Bounce</HI> of a <HI>Pythagorean,</HI> who
<PB N="302" REF="336"/>
defy'd any one, to produce an Instance of a
Person who had long lived on <HI>Milk and
Vegetables:</HI> who ever <HI>cut</HI> his own <HI>Throat,
hang'd</HI> or <HI>made away</HI> with himself; who had
ever suffered at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> gone to <HI>Newgate,</HI>
or to <HI>Moorfields,</HI> (and he added profanely)
or would go to <HI>Hell</HI> hereafter.</P>
<P>III. ANOTHER <HI>doughty</HI> Objection against a
<HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI> I have heard has been made
by <HI>learned Gentlemen:</HI> And is, that <HI>Vegeta∣bles</HI>
require great <HI>Labour,</HI> strong <HI>Exercise,</HI>
and much <HI>Action,</HI> to digest and turn them
into proper <HI>Nutriment,</HI> as (say they) is evi∣dent
from its being the common <HI>Diet</HI> of
<HI>Day-Labourers, Handy-Craftsmen,</HI> and <HI>Farm∣ers:</HI>
This Objection I should have been
ashamed to mention, but that I have heard it
came from the Men of Learning; and they
might have as justly said, that <HI>Free-stone</HI>
is harder than <HI>Marble,</HI> and that the Juice of
<HI>Vegetables</HI> makes stronger Glew than that of
<HI>Fish</HI> or <HI>Beef!</HI> Do not <HI>Children</HI> and young
Persons, <HI>that is,</HI> tender Persons, live on
<HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Seeds,</HI> even before they are capa∣ble
of much Labour and Exercise? Do not
all the <HI>Eastern</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> People, live in∣tirely
almost on them? The <HI>Asiaticks,
Moors,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> whose <HI>Climates</HI> incapa∣citate
them for much Labour, and whose
<HI>Indolence</HI> is so justly a Reproach to them?
Are there lazier and less laborious Men than
<PB N="303" REF="337"/>
the <HI>Highlanders</HI> and <HI>Native Irish?</HI> The
Truth is, <HI>Hardness</HI> of <HI>Digestion</HI> does princi∣pally
depend on the Minuteness of the Com∣ponent
<HI>Particles:</HI> as is evident in <HI>Marble</HI> and
<HI>precious Stones;</HI> and <HI>Animal</HI> Substances be∣ing
made of Particles that pass through innu∣merable,
very little, or <HI>infinitely small excre∣tory
Ducts,</HI> must be of a much finer <HI>Texture,</HI>
and consequently harder and tougher in their
Composition, than any <HI>Vegetable</HI> Substance
can be: And the <HI>Flesh</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> that
live on <HI>Animals</HI> are like double distill'd
Spirits, and so require much more La∣bour
to break, grind and digest them:
And indeed, if <HI>Day-Labourers</HI> and <HI>Handy-Craftsmen</HI>
were allowed the high, strong
Food of Men of <HI>Condition:</HI> And the <HI>quick</HI>
and much <HI>thinking</HI> Persons were confined to
the <HI>Farmer</HI> and <HI>Ploughmens</HI> Food, it
would be much happier for both.</P>
<P>IV. THE <HI>last Objection</HI> I shall take Notice
of against a <HI>Milk and Vegetable Diet,</HI> is, that
it breeds <HI>Phlegm,</HI> and so is unfit for tender
Persons of cold Constitutions, especially
those whose predominant Failing is too much
<HI>Phlegm:</HI> But this Objection has as little
Foundation as any of the precedent; <HI>Phlegm</HI>
is nothing but superfluous <HI>Chyle</HI> and Nou∣rishment,
or the taking down more Food,
than the <HI>Expences</HI> of Living, and the <HI>Waste</HI>
of the <HI>Solids</HI> and <HI>Fluids</HI> require; the People
<PB N="304" REF="338"/>
that live most on such Foods, (the <HI>Eastern</HI>
and <HI>Southern</HI> People, and those of the <HI>Nor∣thern</HI>
I have mentioned) breed less <HI>Phlegm</HI>
than any others. <HI>Superfluity</HI> will always
produce <HI>Redundancy,</HI> whether it be of <HI>Phlegm</HI>
or <HI>Choler;</HI> and that which will Digest the
most readily, will breed the lest <HI>Phlegm,</HI> (as
is evident from infinite <HI>Experiment</HI> and the
best <HI>Philosophy</HI>) such are <HI>Milk, Seeds,</HI> and
<HI>Vegetables.</HI> Generally speaking, the <HI>Phlegm</HI>
in the <HI>Glands,</HI> in the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and on the
<HI>Stomach,</HI> is nothing but the <HI>Viscosity</HI> of the
<HI>Serum</HI> of the Blood, and that which will
least produce <HI>Viscosity,</HI> will produce least
<HI>Phlegm;</HI> it is true, by cooling and relaxing
the Solids, the <HI>Phlegm</HI> will be more readily
thrown up and discharged; more, I say, by
such a <HI>Diet,</HI> than by a hot, high, <HI>caustick,</HI>
and restringent one; but that Discharge is a
Benefit to the Constitution, and will help it
the sooner and faster to <HI>dispumate</HI> and <HI>purify,</HI>
and so to get into perfect good Health;
whereas by shuting these up, the <HI>Case</HI> or
Cask must fly and burst so much the sooner.</P>
<P>V. THE only material and solid Objections
against a <HI>Milk, Seed,</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Diet
are, <HI>First,</HI> That it is <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>unsocial,</HI>
in a Country where the common Diet is of
another Nature: But I am sure <HI>Sickness,
Lowness,</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> is much more so;
and I should never advise any one to such a
<PB N="305" REF="339"/>
<HI>Diet,</HI> who can do tolerably under a <HI>common</HI>
one: Tho' these Difficulties happen only at
first, while the <HI>Cure</HI> is about: for when good
Health comes, these <HI>Oddnesses</HI> and <HI>Speciali∣ties</HI>
will vanish, and then all the contrary to
these will be the Case. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That it is
<HI>weakening,</HI> and gives a Man less Strength and
Force than common Diet. It is true, that
may happen at first also, while the <HI>Cure</HI> is im∣perfect;
but then the greater <HI>Activity</HI> and
<HI>Gayety</HI> which will ensue on Health, under a
<HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI> will liberally supply
that Defect, if real; and I should never advise
any one to such a <HI>Diet,</HI> whose Manner of
Living and <HI>Occupation</HI> requires great <HI>Mecha∣nical</HI>
Force, Labour, and Strength; for they
seldom or never can want so poor and low a
<HI>Diet</HI> for this Distemper, because their <HI>Labour</HI>
and <HI>Exercise</HI> drawing off and <HI>antidoting</HI> the
Faults and Inconveniencies of a full, strong,
and free Manner of Living, will preservethem;
so it will never be required or be necessary or
fit for the <HI>governed,</HI> but the <HI>governing;</HI> never
for those whose Excellence lies in their <HI>Limbs,</HI>
but those whose Superiority lies in their <HI>Heads</HI>
and <HI>thinking Faculties;</HI> never for the <HI>Active,</HI>
but for the <HI>Sedentary.</HI> But <HI>thirdly,</HI> The most
material Objection against such a Diet, is, that
it <HI>cools, relaxes, softens,</HI> and <HI>unbends</HI> the Solids
at first, faster than it <HI>corrects, thins,</HI> and
<HI>sweetens</HI> the Juices, and so brings on greater
Degrees of Lowness, than it is designed to
<PB N="306" REF="340"/>
Cure, and so sinks instead of raising. But this
Objection is not universally true, for there
are many I have treated, who without any
<HI>Rub, Inconvenience,</HI> or consequent <HI>Lowness,</HI>
have gone into this <HI>Regimen,</HI> and have been
free from any <HI>Oppression, Sinking,</HI> or any
Degree of Weakness ever after; and they
were not only those who have been gene∣rally
Temperate and <HI>Clean,</HI> free from Hu∣mours
and Sharpnesses; but who on the
<HI>Decline</HI> of Life, or from a naturally weak
Constitution or Frame, have been oppress'd
and sunk, from their Weakness and their
Incapacity to <HI>digest</HI> common <HI>Animal Food,</HI>
and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors. Those who have
been very <HI>Voluptuous,</HI> or very <HI>Gross,</HI> when
this cooling <HI>Diet</HI> has loosened their gross
<HI>Humours, acrid Bile</HI> and <HI>sharp Serum,</HI> must
suffer in throwing these off; but I have sug∣gested
Means constantly to relieve these
Symptoms. <HI>Bark, Rhubarb, Bitters, Steel,</HI>
and <HI>Chalybeat Mineral Waters,</HI> will always
keep up the Tension of the Solids in a De∣gree
sufficient for such a Diet; and I
very much question if any <HI>Diet,</HI> either
<HI>hot</HI> or <HI>cool,</HI> has any great Influence on the
<HI>Solids,</HI> after the Fluids have been intirely
sweetened and <HI>balmified.</HI> For then I have
always found the <HI>Solids</HI> return to much
the same State of <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Spring,</HI>
they were in before the Distemper; and
all the Functions return to the same <HI>Tenor:

Sweeten but and thin the Juices, the rest will

<HEAD>The Case of the Honourable Colonel
Townshend.</HEAD>
<P><HI>COlonel Townshend,</HI> a Gentleman of excel∣lent
Natural Parts, and of great <HI>Honour</HI>
and <HI>Integrity,</HI> had for many Years been
afflicted with a <HI>Nephritick</HI> Complaint, at∣tended
with constant <HI>Vomitings,</HI> which had
made his Life painful and miserable. Dure∣ing
the whole Time of his <HI>Illness,</HI> he had
observed the strictest <HI>Regimen,</HI> living on the
softest Vegetables and lightest <HI>Animal Foods,</HI>
drinking <HI>Asses Milk</HI> daily, even in the Camp:
and for common Drink <HI>Bristol</HI> Water, which,
the Summer before his <HI>Death,</HI> he had drunk
on the <HI>Spot.</HI> But his Illness increasing, and
his Strength decaying, he came from <HI>Bristol</HI>
to <HI>Bath</HI> in a Litter, in Autumn, and lay at
the <HI>Bell-Inn.</HI> Dr. <HI>Baynard</HI> (who is since
dead) and <HI>I</HI> were called to him, and attend∣ed
him twice a Day for about the Space of a
Week, but his <HI>Vomitings</HI> continuing still
incessant, and obstinate against all Reme∣dies,
<PB N="308" REF="342"/>
we despaired of his <HI>Recovery.</HI> While
he was in this Condition, he sent for us
early one Morning: we waited on him, with
Mr. <HI>Skrine</HI> his <HI>Apothecary</HI> (since dead also);
we found his <HI>Senses</HI> clear, and his <HI>Mind</HI>
calm, his Nurse and several Servants were
about him. He had made his <HI>Will</HI> and
settled his Affairs. He told us, he had sent
for us to give him some Account of an
<HI>odd Sensation,</HI> he had for some Time ob∣served
and felt in himself: which was,
that composing himself, he cou'd <HI>die</HI> or
<HI>expire</HI> when he pleas'd, and yet by
an <HI>Effort,</HI> or some how, he could come
to Life again: which it seems he had
sometimes tried before he had sent for
<HI>us.</HI> We heard this with <HI>Surprize,</HI> but
as it was not to be accounted for from now
<HI>common Principles,</HI> we could hardly be∣lieve
the <HI>Fact</HI> as he related it, much less
give any Account of it: unless he should
please to make the <HI>Experiment</HI> before us,
which we were unwilling he should do,
last, in his weak Condition, he might
carry it too far. He continued to talk very
distinctly and sensibly above a Quarter
of an Hour about this (to Him) sur∣prising
<HI>Sensation,</HI> and insisted so much
on our seeing the <HI>Trial</HI> made, that we
were at last forced to comply. We all
<HI>three</HI> felt his Pulse first: it was distinct, tho'
small and <HI>threedy:</HI> and his <HI>Heart</HI> had
<PB N="309" REF="343"/>
its usual Beating. He compos'd himself
on his Back, and lay in a still Posture
some time: while <HI>I</HI> held his right Hand,
Dr. <HI>Baynard</HI> laid his Hand on his Heart,
and Mr. <HI>Skrine</HI> held a clean Looking-glass
to his Mouth. I found his <HI>Pulse</HI>
sink gradually, till at last I could not
feel any, by the most exact and nice
Touch. Dr. <HI>Baynard</HI> could not feel the
least Motion in his <HI>Heart,</HI> nor Mr. <HI>Skrine</HI>
the least Soil of Breath on the bright
<HI>Mirror</HI> he held to his Mouth; then each
of us by <HI>Turns</HI> examin'd his <HI>Arm, Heart</HI>
and <HI>Breath,</HI> but could not by the nicest
<HI>Scrutiny</HI> discover the least <HI>Symptom</HI> of
<HI>Life</HI> in him. We reason'd a long Time
about this odd <HI>Appearance</HI> as well as
we could, and all of us judging it in∣explicable
and unaccountable, and finding
he still continued in that Condition, we
began to conclude that he had indeed
carried the <HI>Experiment</HI> too far, and at
last were satisfied he was actually dead,
and were just ready to leave him. This
continued about half an Hour, by Nine
a'Clock in the Morning in <HI>Autumn.</HI> As we
were going away, we observ'd some Motion
about the Body, and upon Examination,
found his <HI>Pulse</HI> and the <HI>Motion</HI> of his
<HI>Heart</HI> gradually returning: he began to
<HI>breath</HI> gently and speak softly: we were
all astonish'd to the last Degree at this
<PB N="310" REF="344"/>
unexpected Change, and after some fur∣ther
Conversation with him, and among
ourselves, went away fully satisfy'd as
to all the Particulars of this Fact, but
confounded and puzled, and not able to
form any rational <HI>Scheme</HI> that might ac∣count
for it. He afterwards called for
his <HI>Attorney,</HI> added a <HI>Codicil</HI> to his <HI>Will,</HI>
settled Legacies on his Servants, re∣ceived
the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> and calmly and
composedly expir'd about five or six a'Clock
that Evening. Next Day he was opened,
(as he had ordered) his Body was the
foundest and best made I had ever seen;
his <HI>Lungs</HI> were fair, large and found, his
<HI>Heart</HI> big and strong, and his <HI>Intestines</HI>
sweet and clean; his <HI>Stomach</HI> was of a
due Proportion, the <HI>Coats</HI> sound and thick,
and the villous <HI>Membrane</HI> quite entire.
But when we came to examine the <HI>Kid∣neys,</HI>
tho' the <HI>left</HI> was perfectly sound
and of a just <HI>Size,</HI> the <HI>right</HI> was about
four Times as big, distended like a blown
<HI>Bladder,</HI> and yielding as if full of Pap;
he having often pass'd a <HI>Wheyish</HI> Liquor
after his Urine, dureing his Illness. Upon
opening this <HI>Kidney,</HI> we found it quite
full of a white <HI>Chalky</HI> Matter, like <HI>Plaister
of Paris,</HI> and all the fleshy Substance dis∣solved
and worn away, by what I called
a <HI>Nephritick Cancer.</HI> This had been the
Source of all his Misery; and the <HI>sympto∣matick</HI>
<PB N="311" REF="345"/>
Vomitings from the Irritation on
the consentient <HI>Nerves,</HI> had quite starved
and worn him down. I have narrated the
<HI>Facts,</HI> as I saw and observed them deli∣berately
and distinctly, and shall leave to
the <HI>Philosophick Reader</HI> to make what In∣ferences
he thinks fit; the Truth of the
material Circumstances I will warrant.</P>

Dr. Cranstoun, in a Let∣ter
to the Author at his Desire, in
Dr. Cranstoun's own Words.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Jedburgh, <DATE>Sept. 20. 1732.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOURS of <HI>May</HI> last was most agree∣able:
I am much oblig'd to, and at the
same Time charm'd with, that <HI>masterly</HI>
Reasoning in such <HI>massy</HI> Expressions, as
brings the most subtile <HI>Speculations</HI> in a
Manner to the Senses, in plain Concep∣tions,
vastly like the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI>
which is never perplex'd, however much
<PB N="312" REF="346"/>
so our Accounts of it may be. What
you are pleased to communicate, of a
<HI>Treatise</HI> you design for the Press, gives
me great Pleasure. A <HI>Class</HI> of Diseases
so universally frequent, and so peculiarly
the <HI>Cloud</HI> and <HI>Bane</HI> of the most worthy
and valuable <HI>Lives; deep</HI> set in the <HI>Oeco∣nomy,</HI>
and so little gained upon by
<HI>Medicine: superficially</HI> treated by its <HI>Pro∣fessors,</HI>
and <HI>carelesly</HI> or <HI>weakly</HI> trifled with
by the Patients; demands and well de∣serves
a <HI>Master's Hand.</HI> I rejoice to find
the Task undertaken, by one equally
qualify'd to do Justice to the Subject,
and Good to Mankind. For my own
Part I shall never reflect upon the mise∣rable
<HI>Distress</HI> I have suffer'd, but with
grateful Remembrance of that kind Hu∣manity,
wherewith you communicated your
frank and friendly Advice. The clear
distinct Knowledge, from small imperfect
<HI>Hints,</HI> you had at first of my Distemper,
was equally surprizing, with the positive
Assurance of Success, with which you pressed
to persuade and encourage my following
your <HI>Method of Cure;</HI> nothing but ma∣ture
Experience and well-taken Observa∣tions,
upon certain Principles of <HI>Science,</HI>
cou'd have warranted, or supported a Predic∣tion
more like <HI>prophetick Security,</HI> than
<HI>physical Prognostick,</HI> which hitherto has
answer'd; as I have faithfully the Con∣dition.
<PB N="313" REF="347"/>
And now Dr. Dr. <HI>Infandum!—Jubes
renovare Dclorem.</HI> But as so good a Friend's
Commands are sacred, if it may in the
least be serviceable to your Purpose, I
shall, beside what you know already,
give a short <HI>Abstract,</HI> as I can now re∣collect,
of the Origin and Progress of
my Disease, wherein, without the least
Reasoning, Conjecture or Term of <HI>Art,</HI>
I shall confine it to a simple Narration
of most essential Matters of <HI>Fact,</HI> without
troubling you with every Circumstance
and <HI>Symptom,</HI> which however proper to
the true <HI>History of a Disease,</HI> would be
too tedious and perhaps superfluous here.
And tho', at best, I'm always at a vast
Loss for Language and Expression, I must
beg you'll forgive my careless Freedom
in this: While I write with Ease and
Openness to a Friend: if you can but take the
Meaning, I hope whatever Use you please to
make of it, you'll be so kind as to treat
me and it as your own.</P>
<P>(1) A Constitution rather <HI>tractable</HI> than
strong, nor subject to considerable Disor∣ders,
except such transient <HI>Symptoms</HI> of a
<HI>Colluvies Serosa,</HI> upon Cold or Errors in
Life, as commonly denominate a <HI>scurbu∣tick
Habit,</HI> never afflicted since Childhood
with any formed Disease, till at <HI>Leyden,</HI>
I got an <HI>autumnal Quartan</HI> in 1719, <HI>then
<PB N="314" REF="348"/>
Epidemical in Holland;</HI> which gave easy
Way to the <HI>Cortex,</HI> and the whole suc∣ceeding
Winter had no Relapse; but that
same Winter I first suffer'd by Gripes and
Purging, which always seiz'd me early in
the Morning without the least further
Trouble through the Day. The follow∣ing
Spring Season, a Return of the <HI>Ague</HI>
in a tertian <HI>Type,</HI> carried off that <HI>Symp∣tom,</HI>
which never return'd more for se∣veral
Years, to interrupt good Health,
in pursuing my Business with considera∣ble
Fatigue, careless altogether of either
<HI>Diet,</HI> or Exposures to all Airs in all Seasons
without much Inconvenience.</P>
<P>(2) ABOUT <HI>Spring</HI> Time 1727, I began
to be visited now and then with an odd
uneasy Sensation in the right Side, between
the false Ribs and <HI>Spine</HI> of the <HI>Ilium,</HI> or, as
I judged, at the Seat of the <HI>Coecum,</HI> which
seldom came up to acute Pain: but of
various Feelings, sometimes of Coldness,
at other Times of Heat, and often it felt
like <HI>vermicular</HI> Motions, or <HI>spasmodick</HI>
Workings in that Part; and these <HI>Symp∣toms</HI>
would sometimes be communicated
to the external <HI>Teguments,</HI> at other Times
spread inward to the <HI>Bowels</HI> in different
Commotions. This Trouble, without much
further affecting the Body, came and went
at first a long Time, but, always irri∣tated
<PB N="315" REF="349"/>
by Cold, became at last more con∣stant
through the whole Summer, when
I <HI>dragg'd</HI> about with a great deal of Trouble;
now become more universal, as frequent <HI>chilly
cold Horrors,</HI> sick <HI>Periods,</HI> with a quick
small Pulse and dry Mouth, insuperable
Coldness in the <HI>Extremities,</HI> even in the
hottest Days, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE Beginning of <HI>Autumn</HI> 1727, after
being much expos'd to cold rainy Wea∣ther,
my former Complaints formed more
directly into <HI>Gripes,</HI> and sick <HI>Throws</HI> in
the Guts; which often arose from, or at
least most affected that first Seat of Trou∣ble
in the right Side, and settled into
<HI>periodical</HI> Returns, which were about the
Evening Sun-set: and the same Hours in
the Morning: which <HI>Periods,</HI> or I may
call them <HI>Paroxysms,</HI> continued always
till by repeated Evacuations of crude <HI>Foe∣ces</HI>
and glutinous <HI>Lentor</HI> the <HI>Intestines</HI>
were throughly evacuated. But retaining
an Appetite sharp enough, and being to∣lerable
easy in the Intervals, without mind∣ing
its Progress or Consequence, I persi∣sted
in my ordinary Course of Living and
Business, tho' with severe Incommodement,
and daily Aggravations from Cold: till
the Middle of <HI>October,</HI> when the Season
turning Bitter Cold and Wet, all the
<HI>Symptoms</HI> increased, attended with a <HI>La∣tent
<PB N="316" REF="350"/>
Fever,</HI> I was disabled at once and
confin'd.</P>
<P>(3) THUS, tho' better and worse, I con∣tinued
after the same Manner all the <HI>Win∣ter</HI>
in great Distress; oppress'd with in∣numerable
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> which partly arose
from the <HI>Genius</HI> of the Disease, and partly
from its Effects on the <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> and
so more common to an exhausted Con∣stitution
and debilitated <HI>Nerves;</HI> which need
not be enumerated here. When the Dis∣ease
was not diverted from its Course by
<HI>Medicine, Management</HI> or an excessive <HI>Fever,</HI>
that sometimes made its Violence conti∣nual
without Regularity; the <HI>Dysenterick
Symptoms</HI> seem'd generally inclined to pe∣riodical
<HI>Exacerbations,</HI> which commonly be∣gan
in the Morning early about four or five,
and kept near the same Evening Hours.
The <HI>Gripes</HI> and <HI>Purging</HI> were ushered
in with a <HI>mortified</HI> Coldness, especially
in the Extremities; deep felt in the <HI>ten∣denous</HI>
Parts: the <HI>Gripes</HI> thro' all the <HI>Guts,</HI>
but chiefly the <HI>Colon,</HI> and that on the
right Side, which soon after affected the
<HI>Rectum</HI> with wringing Violence, and rigid
<HI>Pressure</HI> on Dejection; after one Motion,
no more quiet, but by repeated Irritation
all the <HI>mucous</HI> and crude Contents were
discharged, after which the succeeding Stools
were surprizingly different, at different
<PB N="317" REF="351"/>
Times: liquid purely, or <HI>Crass,</HI> in all the malig∣nant
Variety of Colours and Consistence that
has ever been observed in that Discharge; and
while that Matter was moving in its Descent
thro' the <HI>Guts,</HI> the horrid Sensations, <HI>Rigors,</HI>
Heart-sick Throws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which attended its
Progress, always <HI>prognosticated</HI> the virulent
Appearance.</P>
<P>AFTER this Course of several Hours was
finished, there was some Respite till the <HI>Inte∣stines</HI>
were again replete, or the new Time of
Access approached, when the same <HI>Scene</HI> was
repeated. In the mean Time the <HI>Urine</HI> was
variable, of a deep <HI>saturate</HI> Colour, when the
<HI>Fever</HI> was sensibly high, with a <HI>lateritious,</HI>
dusky or dark Sediment sometimes, especi∣ally
when the Purging was retarded or aba∣ted;
good Quantities of crude, limpid, or
greenish tinctur'd <HI>Urine,</HI> of a bitter acrid Pun∣gency;
often attended with <HI>nervous</HI> Affec∣tions,
for ordinary about 10 or 12 a'Clock of the
Day, the <HI>Urine</HI> would come to some Seperation:
towards the Evening more crude and limpid,
and the same again at the Morning <HI>Period.</HI></P>
<P>FOR Ordinary, when the Fever was
moderate and no immediate <HI>Nausea</HI> affect∣ing
the Stomach, the Appetite was to∣lerable;
sometimes sharp and an unnatural
Craving, with an ungrateful acid Taste in
the Mouth; but eating was but laying
<PB N="318" REF="352"/>
in a new Load, rather to be pressed
down in new Commotions than digested.
Little Thirst, except sometimes, when a
<HI>Dryness</HI> of the Mouth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or <HI>feverish</HI>
internal Heat, made it unquenchable. Com∣monly
a rigid Dryness of the Skin, tho'
oft-times <HI>Symptomatick</HI> Flushes of Sweat,
rarely universal and natural: which when
it happen'd of a <HI>critical</HI> kindly Sort with
gentle urinous Discharge, seldom fail'd of
doing Service. By labouring thus thro'
the whole Winter, you may believe I
was pretty much exhausted and emacia∣ted,
with considerable Swelling, of the
Legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>MEDICINES,</HI> I us'd several to little
Effect, <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> or the gentlest <HI>Stimulus</HI> enra∣ged
all the <HI>Symptoms;</HI> all easy gentle
Astringents of every kind had no Effect,
and strong ones, as <HI>Decoct. Diascord.</HI> with
<HI>Terra Japonica,</HI> proved violent <HI>Catharticks;
Injections</HI> of any kind, when the Disease
rag'd, promoted it; <HI>Opiats</HI> only, tho' not
always, check'd the Purging; but only
by sisting the Action of irritate <HI>Fibres,</HI>
the Load was accumulated for a redoubled
Discharge: and in the mean Time most
always produced a <HI>Nausea,</HI> Vomiting, with
many other <HI>nervous Symptoms,</HI> till their
retentive Power was gone, and never failed
<PB N="319" REF="353"/>
effectually to debar Sleep, tho' by quieting
Pain, it gave easy <HI>watching Rest.</HI></P>
<P>(4) ABOUT <HI>March</HI> 1728, with the Assi∣stance
of <HI>Opiats,</HI> the Disease began to abate,
and at last the Purging went off, but left the
<HI>System</HI> vastly debilitated; and subject to
many Disorders, proper to such a State;
however I pass'd the <HI>Summer</HI> and next
<HI>Winter</HI> without the <HI>Dysentery;</HI> but in con∣tinual
Hazard of a <HI>Relapse,</HI> and little Con∣firmation
of Health or Strength. All that
Time I made choice of the most <HI>drying</HI>
Food, and red Wines in small Quanti∣ties;
with a simple Intention to abstract
from the <HI>Materies Morbi,</HI> and corroborate
the <HI>primae Viae,</HI> abstaining from whatever
might be said to moisten or relax.</P>
<P>(5) TOWARDS the End of <HI>Summer</HI> 1729,
the old <HI>Symptoms</HI> (2) began to recur. I
neglected them, still exposing to the <HI>au∣tumnal</HI>
Colds, till all came to the same
Heights as before; (3) went through the
same Course of Distress that Winter with
little essential Variation, save what might
arise from the greater Violence of the
Disease, and less equal Strength in the
Subject. Except a few Weeks of Respite
from the <HI>Dysentery</HI> that <HI>Spring,</HI> without
which it is likely Nature had yielded. I
had no more Intermission all the <HI>Summer</HI>
<PB N="320" REF="354"/>
1730, the Disease rag'd with more Heat
and Thirst, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the warm Season allow'd me to drag
a feeble and distressed Body abroad, and
that as far as <HI>Tunbridge;</HI> I made Trial of
the Waters there, you know, without any
Success, returning to <HI>London</HI> in as great Di∣stress
as ever; I wanted much to be deter∣min'd,
doubtful if I should be carried towards
<HI>Bath</HI> or Home: I then first made free with
a <HI>Character</HI> I was a little acquainted with by
the <HI>Press,</HI> and asked your Opinion: by a
speedy and kind Return, you dissuaded me
from <HI>Bath,</HI> upon good Reasons, confirmed
by Experience, and with a <HI>friendly Warmth,</HI>
advis'd a <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Living,</HI> as the only Cure
remaining, pressed by most encouraging As∣surance
of Success, if I was not beyond the
Power of <HI>natural Agents.</HI> I obey'd, came
Home through a Journey of the greatest Di∣stress
ever one travelled, and immediately be∣gan
<HI>your Method,</HI> of a <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>vegetable Diet,</HI>
but the Disease rag'd with such Violence,
and natural Strength was so far gone, that
I was not able to observe any <HI>Rules</HI> with
Exactness. All the <HI>Symptoms</HI> (3) formerly
mentioned were aggravated with several
Changes, which I cannot particularly re∣late,
only, in general, more sensible Heat,
Thirst, and evident <HI>Fever,</HI> then had ever
been before.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="355"/>
AT this Time, <HI>Jan.</HI> 1731. when exhaus∣ted
more than ever, the Purging, by a little
Assistance of <HI>Opiats,</HI> after a Day's <HI>Nausea</HI>
and <HI>Vomiting,</HI> was abated, which preserved
the remaining Life. I then began to be
exact in <HI>Diet,</HI> restricting it only to <HI>Milk</HI> and
<HI>Grains of Rice, Millet,</HI> &amp;c. and abdicated all
<HI>animal</HI> Food; in about six Weeks or two
Months, the <HI>Dysentery</HI> gave Truce, in which
Time I was often fretted with <HI>strangurious Sym∣ptoms.</HI>
I sometimes took Notice of one <HI>Phae∣nomenon</HI>
in the <HI>Urine,</HI> which I never remem∣ber
to have seen, or heard, or observ'd before,
which was the <HI>Pellicle,</HI> which it commonly
carry'd on the Top, was powdered with ex∣ceeding
small <HI>shineing Particles,</HI> like <HI>Gold-dust;</HI>
the Sides of the Glass beset with the
same, and the <HI>mucous</HI> Cloud in the <HI>Centre</HI>
wrought full of them: These glittering
<HI>Atoms,</HI> when gathered on the Finger, had
the Feeling of fine hard Dust, and the <HI>Urine</HI>
saturate with these, at its first Evacuation,
would sparkle and rise in the <HI>Glass;</HI> at such
Times there was deep Disorder in the <HI>Oeco∣nomy</HI>
and <HI>nervous System.</HI></P>
<P>(6.) THE Beginning of next <HI>March</HI> 1731.
the Season being a sharp Frost, after some
Days of chilly mortify'd Cold, I was seiz'd
with a heavy <HI>Stupor</HI> and <HI>feverish</HI> Heat, with
a Return of the <HI>Dysentery;</HI> by this Time,
feeble, and little able to stand the Shock: the
<PB N="322" REF="356"/>
<HI>Stomach</HI> felt loaded, which came to a Vomit∣ing
of a heavy <HI>Pituit:</HI> the Sense of a stuf∣fing
Load still remaining, I took a Vomit,
which discharg'd a vast Quantity of <HI>crude
Flegm,</HI> clear and glassy, just as the unbroken
White of Eggs; still the Weight at <HI>Stomach</HI>
continued, the <HI>Fever</HI> increased with biteing
Heat and great Thirst, a <HI>Pulse</HI> feeble, <HI>unequal,</HI>
and <HI>quick;</HI> at the same time a languid In∣flammation
seized my Throat, and Parts
about it: A little after appeared an Eruption
of <HI>Apthae</HI> in the Mouth, especially on the
Tongue, which was all over thick set, with
very small <HI>pellucid Pearl-coloured Pustles:</HI>
these were attended with a great <HI>Salivation</HI> of
crude, insipid crass Stuff, such as I had vo∣mitted;
the <HI>Apthae</HI> remained constant, the
Sinking and Rising as the <HI>Fever</HI> varied, most
Part highest at Night. After about a Week,
the <HI>Apthae</HI> changed their Colour to pale-red,
then darker, sometimes livid, and at last a
black Depression on the Top of every one of
them. By this Time, natural Strength was
just a going, mostly supported by <HI>Asses
Milk,</HI> which too I was restrained from by
reason of the great Effusion of Urine, which
it provok'd. Scarce able to move out of Bed,
after two or three Weeks thus on the Brin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Dissolution, it pleased God to set the
Bounds! The <HI>Symptoms</HI> all gradually, slowly
and insensibly declined, and the <HI>Dysentery</HI>
went off at the same Time.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="357"/>
VII. I resolutely, as soon as capable of a
Diet, held myself close to your Rules of
<HI>bland vegetable Food,</HI> and <HI>elementary Drink;</HI>
and, without any other Medicine, save fre∣quent
chewing of <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> and sometimes
a little <HI>Cortex.</HI> I passed last Winter and this
Summer without a <HI>Relapse</HI> of the <HI>Dysentery;</HI>
and, tho' by a very slow Advance, I find
now more Restitution of the Body, and Re∣gularity
in the <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> on this <HI>primitive
Aliment,</HI> than ever I knew from the Begin∣ning
of this Trouble. This encourages much
my Perseverance in the same <HI>Method,</HI> and
that so religiously, as to my Knowledge,
now for more than a Year and half, I have
not tasted any thing that had <HI>animal Life.</HI>
There is Plenty in the <HI>vegetable</HI> Kingdom,
and <HI>Milk</HI> taken itself, affords Variety: And,
say it were otherwise, <HI>Health</HI> should be
thought an easy <HI>Purchase</HI> at a little Restric∣tion
of <HI>Taste,</HI> did not its principal Enjoy∣ment
shamefully consist in <HI>Pleasure of Sense.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY one, upon the most obvious Con∣siderations,
may be convinced of the great
Influence that <HI>Aliment</HI> must have on the
<HI>Crasis</HI> and Constitution of our Bodies, which
it daily supplies, and of which, at last, it
becomes <HI>constituent Materials.</HI> And yet for
want of due Attention to this <HI>noble Branch</HI> of
<HI>Medicine,</HI> or from a vicious Indulgence, and
Weakness of Resolution, how often is our
<PB N="324" REF="358"/>
<HI>Practice</HI> rendered miserably unsuccessful?
and in many, the most considerable <HI>chronical</HI>
Distempers, degenerates into meer <HI>Trifling</HI> or
<HI>Quackery.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE too much tried your Patience with
an unpolished but faithful Relation of <HI>Facts,</HI>
and must leave such Speculations to more
Experience and a better Judgment.</P>
<P>WHEN it is not mispending your Time,
you'll believe, I hope, it is real Pleasure, as well
as improving, to have a Letter from my good
Friend; being most sincerely, <HI>Dear Doctor,</HI></P>

<P>I CHOSE to give this <HI>Case</HI> in the <HI>Doctor's</HI>

thinks it might want a little of the mo∣dern
polishing, yet the strong good Sense, the

is infinitely preferable to all <HI>Varnish,</HI> and

<HEAD>The CASE of the Author.</HEAD>
<P>§ I. I Was born of healthy Parents, in
the <HI>Prime</HI> of their Days, but dis∣pos'd
to <HI>Corpulence,</HI> by the whole
Race of one Side of my <HI>Family.</HI> I passed
my <HI>Youth</HI> in close Study, and almost con∣stant
Application to the <HI>abstracted Scien∣ces,</HI>
(wherein my chief Pleasure consisted)
and consequently in great <HI>Temperance</HI> and a
<HI>sedentary Life;</HI> yet not so much but that I
sometimes kept <HI>Holiday,</HI> diverted myself
with the Works of <HI>Imagination,</HI> and roused
<HI>Nature</HI> by agreeable Company and <HI>good
Cheer;</HI> but, upon the slightest <HI>Excesses,</HI> I
always found slippery Bowels, or a Spitting
to be the <HI>Crise;</HI> whence afterwards, on Re∣flection,
I concluded, that my <HI>Glands</HI> were
naturally <HI>lax,</HI> and my <HI>Solids feeble;</HI> in which
Opinion I was confirmed, by an early <HI>Shakeing</HI>
of my <HI>Hands,</HI> and a Disposition to be easily
ruffled on a <HI>Surprize.</HI> Upon my coming to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
I all of a sudden changed my whole Man∣ner
of Living; I found the <HI>Bottle-Companions,</HI>
the <HI>younger Gentry,</HI> and <HI>Free-Livers,</HI> to be
<PB N="326" REF="360"/>
the most easy of <HI>Access,</HI> and most quickly
susceptible of <HI>Friendship and Acquaintance,</HI>
nothing being necessary for that Purpose, but
to be able to <HI>Eat</HI> lustily, and swallow down
much <HI>Liquor;</HI> and being naturally of a large
<HI>Size,</HI> a cheerful Temper, and tolerable lively
<HI>Imagination,</HI> and having, in my Country Re∣tirement,
laid in Store of <HI>Ideas</HI> and <HI>Facts,</HI> by
these Qualifications I soon became caressed
by them, and grew daily in <HI>Bulk,</HI> and in
Friendship with these gay Gentlemen and
their Acquaintances: I was tempted to con∣tinue
<HI>this Course,</HI> no doubt, from a <HI>Likeing,</HI>
as well as to force a <HI>Trade,</HI> which Method I
had observ'd to succeed with some others;
and thus constantly Dineing and Supping in
<HI>Taverns,</HI> and in the Houses of my Acquain∣tances
of <HI>Taste</HI> and <HI>Delicacy,</HI> my Health was
in a few Years brought into great Distress,
by so sudden and violent a Change. I grew
excessively <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, short-breath'd, Lethargic</HI> and
<HI>Listless.</HI></P>
<P>§ II. THE first sensible <HI>Shock</HI> I had, was
an <HI>autumnal intermittent Fever;</HI> this I con∣quer'd
in a few Weeks with the <HI>Bark,</HI>
which, at that time, I found exceeding
<HI>fresh, thin, Cinnamon-coloured,</HI> and <HI>curled:</HI>
This sort (as I know from long Experience)
greatly contributing to the Speed and Cer∣tainty
of the <HI>Cure</HI> of such Distempers, being
more easily digested, and entering more rea∣dily
<PB N="327" REF="361"/>
into the Mass of the Blood, while the
Stomach is spoilt by a <HI>Disease,</HI> and the Juices
under a <HI>praeternatural Ferment.</HI> For one
Year I went on tolerably well, tho' as it
were <HI>jumbled</HI> and <HI>turbid,</HI> and neither so <HI>clear</HI>
in my Faculties, nor so <HI>gay</HI> in my Temper:
But next Autumn I was suddenly seized with
a <HI>vertiginous Paroxysm,</HI> so extreamly fright∣ful
and terrible, as to approach near to a <HI>Fit</HI>
of an <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> and I was forced in it to lay
hold on the Posts of my Bed, for fear of
tumbling out, as I apprehended. After im∣mediate
<HI>Bleeding</HI> and <HI>Vomiting</HI> (whereby its
Violence was abated) I thought it might be
owing to an <HI>anomalous</HI> Fit of my relapsing <HI>In∣mittent,</HI>
and thereupon took about four Oun∣ces
of this fine <HI>Bark</HI> in 48 Hours, but with∣out
any sensible Benefit or Injury. I found
after this, some small Returns of my <HI>Vertigo</HI>
(in Bed especially) on lying on a particular
Side, or pressing upon a particular Part of my
Head; but by Degrees it turned to a con∣stant
violent <HI>Head-ach, Giddiness, Lowness,
Anxiety</HI> and <HI>Terror,</HI> so that I went about
like a <HI>Malefactor</HI> condemn'd, or one who ex∣pected
every Moment to be crushed by a
<HI>ponderous</HI> Instrument of Death, hanging
over his Head. At this time I left off
<HI>Suppers</HI> of all kinds, and have never resum'd
them since; then, even at <HI>Dinner,</HI> eating
but a small Quantity of <HI>animal Food,</HI> and
drinking very little fermented Liquor, well
<PB N="328" REF="362"/>
knowing, that <HI>Diseases</HI> must always be
cur'd by their <HI>Contraries.</HI> On this Occasion,
all my <HI>Bouncing, protesting, undertaking</HI> Com∣panions
forsook me, and dropt off like <HI>au∣tumnal
Leaves:</HI> They could not bear, it seems,
to see their Companion in such Misery and
Distress, but retired to comfort themselves
with a <HI>cheer-upping</HI> Cup, leaving me to pass
the melancholy Moments with my own <HI>Ap∣prehensions</HI>
and <HI>Remorse.</HI> Even those who
had shar'd the best Part of my Profusions,
who, in their Necessities, had been assisted by
my false Generosity, and in their Disorders
relieved by my Care, did now entirely relin∣quish
and abandon me; so that I was forc'd
to retire into the Country quite alone, being
reduc'd to the State of <HI>Cardinal Wolsey,</HI> when
he said, that if he had serv'd his <HI>Maker</HI> as
faithfully and warmly as he had his <HI>Prince,</HI>
he would not have forsaken him in that Ex∣tremity;
and so will every one find, when
<HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Friendship</HI> is not founded on <HI>solid
Virtue,</HI> and in Conformity to the <HI>Divine
Order,</HI> but in <HI>sensual Pleasures</HI> and mere
<HI>Jollity.</HI> This silly Circumstance I mention,
because I thought then, it had some Share in
my succeeding <HI>Melancholy.</HI></P>
<P>§ III. I RETIR'D, I say, to the Country,
into a fine Air, and liv'd very low: I had a
<HI>Seton</HI> made in my Neck, which I carried
about for many Months; I took frequent
<PB N="329" REF="363"/>
<HI>Vomits,</HI> and gentle <HI>Purges,</HI> try'd <HI>Volatiles,
Foetids, Bitters, Chalybeats,</HI> and <HI>Mineral
Waters,</HI> and had the Advice of all my <HI>Phy∣sical
Friends,</HI> but with little or no sensible
Benefit; my <HI>Head-ach, Giddiness, Watchings,
Lowness,</HI> and <HI>Melancholy</HI> rather increasing on
me. I had by chance heard of the great Be∣nefit,
which one of my particular Acquain∣tances
had reap'd from some active <HI>mercurial</HI>
Medicines (tho' prescrib'd by a very insuffi∣cient
<HI>Practitioner</HI>) in a violent stupifying
<HI>Head-ach,</HI> which I had Reason to believe came
by the same Intemperance; these I resolv'd
to try. I <HI>first</HI> took 20 Grains of what is call'd
the <HI>Princes Powder,</HI> which gave me twelve
<HI>Vomits,</HI> and near twice the Number of
Stools; and I had certainly perished under
the Operation, but for an <HI>Over-dose</HI> of <HI>Lau∣danum</HI>
after it. In two or three Days more,
I took 12 Grains of <HI>Turbith-mineral,</HI> which
had not quite so violent an Effect; after
that I took 10 Grains of <HI>Calomel,</HI> twice a
Day, for about ten Days together; this put
me into a <HI>Petit Flux de Bouche:</HI> After which
in three Weeks Time I got abroad lightsomer
indeed, and less confus'd, tho' still very bad,
and scarce any thing better, but not worse;
but two Months after that, I found an extream
Sickness in my <HI>Stomach,</HI> which obliged me to
take frequent <HI>Vomits,</HI> these now pumping up
<HI>Oceans</HI> of <HI>Choler,</HI> which they had never done
in any Degree before: Whence I concluded,
<PB N="330" REF="364"/>
that the <HI>ponderous Remedies</HI> I had taken, had
opened my obstructed <HI>Liver, Gall-bladder,</HI>
and <HI>Porus Biliarius,</HI> and broken the Cohe∣sion
of the viscid Juices.</P>
<P>§ IV. WHILE I was thus (as I have said)
forsaken by my <HI>Holiday</HI> Friends, and my
Body was, as it were, melting away like a
<HI>Snow-ball</HI> in Summer, being dejected, <HI>me∣lancholy,</HI>
and much confin'd at home, by my
Course of <HI>mineral</HI> Medicines, and Country
Retirement, I had a long Season for undi∣sturbed
<HI>Meditation</HI> and <HI>Reflection</HI> (my Fa∣culties
being then as clear and quick as ever)
which I was the more readily led into, that
I concluded myself infallibly entering into an
<HI>Unknown State of Things.</HI> Having had a <HI>liberal</HI>
and <HI>regular Education,</HI> with the Instruction and
Example of pious Parents (who, at first, had
designed me for the <HI>Church</HI>) I had preserv'd
a firm Perswasion of the great and fundamen∣tal
Principles of all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Morality:</HI>
viz. the <HI>Existence</HI> of a <HI>supreme and infinitely
perfect Being,</HI> the <HI>Freedom</HI> of the <HI>Will,</HI> the
<HI>Immortality</HI> of the Spirits of all intelligent
Beings, and the Certainty of <HI>future Rewards</HI>
or <HI>Punishments.</HI> These Doctrines I had ex∣amined
carefully, and had been confirmed in,
from <HI>abstracted</HI> Reasonings, as well as from
the best <HI>natural Philosophy,</HI> and some clearer
Knowledge of the <HI>material System</HI> of the
World in general, and the <HI>Wisdom, Fitness</HI>
<PB N="331" REF="365"/>
and beautiful Contrivance of particular
Things <HI>animated</HI> and <HI>inanimated;</HI> so that the
Truth and Necessity of these <HI>Principles</HI> was
so riveted in me (which may be seen by the
first Edition of my <HI>Philosophical Principles,</HI>
published some Years before that happened)
as never after to be shaken in all my <HI>Wander∣ings</HI>
and <HI>Follies:</HI> And I had then the Conso∣lation
to reflect, that, in my loosest Days, I
had never <HI>pimp'd</HI> to the <HI>Vices</HI> or <HI>Infidelity</HI> of
any, but was always a determined Adver∣sary
to both. But I found, that <HI>these</HI> alone
were not sufficient to <HI>quiet</HI> my Mind at that
Juncture, especially when I began to reflect
and consider seriously, whether I might not
(through <HI>Carelessness</HI> and <HI>Self-sufficiency, Vo∣luptuousness</HI>
and Love of <HI>Sensuality,</HI> which
might have impaired my <HI>Spiritual</HI> Nature)
have neglected to examine with sufficient
Care: If there might not be more required of
those, who had had proper <HI>Opportunities</HI> and
<HI>Leisure; if</HI> there might not, I say, be higher
more noble, and more enlightening <HI>Prin∣ciples</HI>
revealed to Mankind <HI>somewhere;</HI> and <HI>if</HI>
there were not more encouraging and enliven∣ing
<HI>Motives</HI> proposed, to form a more exten∣sive
and <HI>Heroic</HI> Virtue upon, than those ari∣sing
from <HI>natural</HI> Religion only (for then I
had gone little farther than to have taken
<HI>Christianity</HI> and <HI>Revelation</HI> on <HI>Trust</HI>) and <HI>lastly,
if</HI> there were not likewise some clearer Ac∣counts
discoverable of that <HI>State</HI> I was then
<PB N="332" REF="366"/>
(I thought) apparently going into, than
could be obtained from the mere Light of
<HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Philosophy.</HI> Such were my Re∣flections
in this my <HI>melancholy</HI> Retirement,
and this led me to call to Mind, <HI>which,</HI> of
all my numerous and various Acquaintances,
I could wish to resemble <HI>most,</HI> now in these
my (to me seemingly) approaching <HI>last</HI> Mo∣ments;
and who among all those of my par∣ticular
Acquaintances, was <HI>He,</HI> who being of
sound <HI>natural,</HI> and duly <HI>cultivated</HI> Parts, had
most strictly and constantly liv'd up to their
Convictions, under the commonly received
Principles, and plain Consequences of <HI>Chri∣stianity.</HI>
In a Word, who it was I could re∣member
to have had received, and lived up to
the plain Truths and Precepts contain'd in
the <HI>Gospels,</HI> or more particularly in our <HI>Savi∣our's
Sermon</HI> on the <HI>Mount.</HI> At that Time
among many whom my Memory suggested to
me, I fix'd on one, a worthy and learned
<HI>Clergyman</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> suffici∣ently
known and distinguished in the <HI>Philo∣sophical</HI>
and <HI>Theological</HI> World (whom I dare
not name, because he is still living, tho' now
extreamly old); and as in studying <HI>Mathe∣maticks,</HI>
and in running over (as I was able)
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton's Philosophical</HI> Works, I
had always pickt out, and mark'd down the
<HI>Authors</HI> and Writings mostly used and
recommended by those others, and by him,
because I thought they could best judge of
<PB N="333" REF="367"/>
such; so in this Case the more quickly to
settle my <HI>Mind,</HI> and quiet my <HI>Conscience,</HI> I
resolved to purchase, study, and examine
carefully such <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Dogmatic Authors,</HI>
as I knew this <HI>venerable Man</HI> did most ap∣prove
and delight in. In this Manner I col∣lected
a <HI>Set of religious Books</HI> and <HI>Writers,</HI> of
most of the <HI>first Ages</HI> since <HI>Christianity,</HI> recom∣mended
by him, with a few others of the
most <HI>Spiritual</HI> of the <HI>Moderns,</HI> which have
been my <HI>Study, Delight</HI> and <HI>Entertainment</HI>
in my Retirements ever since; and on these I
have formed my <HI>Ideas, Principles</HI> and <HI>Senti∣ments:</HI>
so as, under all the Varieties of <HI>Opini∣ons,
Sects, Disputes</HI> and <HI>Controversies,</HI> that of
<HI>late,</HI> and <HI>since</HI> the <HI>Earliest Ages,</HI> have been
canvassed and bandyed in the World, I have
scarce ever since been the least shaken, or
tempted to change my Sentiments or Opini∣ons,
or so much as to <HI>hesitate</HI> in any <HI>material
Point.</HI> This tedious, perhaps impertinent
Circumstance I mention, because the <HI>Fright,
Anxiety, Dread and Terror,</HI> which, in Minds
of such a Turn as mine (especially under a
broken and <HI>cachectick</HI> Constitution, and in so
atrocious a <HI>nervous</HI> Case) arises, or, at
least, is exasperated from such Reflections,
being once settled and quieted, <HI>That</HI> after
becomes an excellent <HI>Cordial,</HI> and a constant
Source of <HI>Peace, Tranquillity</HI> and <HI>Cheerful∣ness,</HI>
and so greatly contributes to forward
the Cure of such <HI>nervous</HI> Diseases: For I ne∣ver
found any sensible <HI>Tranquillity</HI> or A∣mendment,
<PB N="334" REF="368"/>
till I came to this firm and settled
<HI>Resolution</HI> in the Main, <HI>viz. To neglect nothing
to secure my eternal Peace, more than if I had
been certified I should die within the Day: nor
to mind any Thing that my secular Obligations
and Duties demanded of me less, than if I had
been ensured to live fifty Years more.</HI> This,
tho' with infinite Weakness and Imperfection,
has been much my settled Intention in the
Main since.</P>
<P>§ V. THE Spring following I was advised
and pressed by all my Friends, and the <HI>Phy∣sicians</HI>
I consulted, to try the <HI>Bath Waters.</HI>
I went there accordingly, for the first Time,
as a <HI>Patient;</HI> and, for many Weeks, was
much relieved both in my <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Spi∣rits</HI>
by them: And tho' in the Opinion of
the World, I liv'd very temperately, yet by
increasing the Quantity of my <HI>Animal</HI> Food,
and <HI>strong</HI> Liquors (my Appetite being now
stronger and more craving, and my Spirits
brisker, from the drinking of the Waters (in
the Space of four or five Months, I was
heated so, as to apprehend a <HI>Hectic.</HI> I then
changed the <HI>Bath</HI> for <HI>Bristol</HI> Waters, re∣trenched
my <HI>Diet,</HI> and increased my daily
Rideing and Exercise, and continued some∣times
gentle <HI>Vomits:</HI> by which I past that
Year better than the former, tho' far from
well; but, on the Return of the next Spring,
some <HI>Symptoms</HI> were exasperated, insomuch
that their Severity, the Continuance of my
<PB N="335" REF="369"/>
Miseries, and the constant Complaints, com∣mon
to <HI>Hypish</HI> People, made Life a Burden
to myself, and a Pain to my Friends. I ac∣cidentally
met with a Clergyman, who told
me of a wonderful Cure, which Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> of
<HI>Croydon</HI> had wrought on himself in an <HI>Epi∣leptick
Case,</HI> by a total <HI>Milk Diet.</HI> This <HI>Hint</HI>
accidentally dropt, wrought so on me, that
I began to recollect a great many Things,
that before had escaped me without much
Reflection. I had read in Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI>
that in violent and obstinate <HI>Hysterick Fits</HI>
and <HI>Colicks,</HI> he had, with great Success, pre∣scribed
a <HI>total Milk Diet,</HI> as the last and
surest Remedy. Dr. <HI>Pitcairn,</HI> my Master and
Friend, in his <HI>Dictates</HI> had recommended it as
the only <HI>infallible Cure</HI> in an inveterate <HI>Scur∣vy,
Cacochimy</HI> and totally vitiated Juices: And
I myself knew it to be the only Remedy in the
<HI>Gout,</HI> a confirmed <HI>Hectic</HI> and <HI>Consumption,</HI>
and had seen Miracles wrought by it in such
Cases; besides, I knew <HI>nervous</HI> Distempers
of all Kinds, differed only in Degrees. All
these Considerations determined me, next
Day, in the Middle of Winter, to ride to
<HI>Croydon</HI> to advise with Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> personally.
I found him at home, at his full Quart of
Cow's Milk (which was all his Dinner.) He
told me, he had had the Advice of all the
most eminent <HI>Physicians</HI> of his Time about
<HI>London,</HI> and had taken all their Medicines,
and all he had ever read or heard of, for his
<PB N="336" REF="370"/>
<HI>Epilepsy,</HI> but with so little Success, that he
used frequently to be seized with it on the
Road, while he was rideing in the Country
about the Business of his Profession, so that
dropping from his Horse, he remained sense∣less,
till by the next Waggoner or Passenger
he was carried to the nearest House; and that
both his <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Faculties</HI> had been in the
utmost Danger by it; but that, on reading
<HI>Sydenham,</HI> he had first dropt all fermented
Liquors, whereby his <HI>Fits</HI> became less vio∣lent
and frequent, and then, by Degrees, he
had given over all <HI>animal Food,</HI> living in∣tirely
on <HI>Cow-Milk,</HI> with which, at first, he
used only to take a few Drops of <HI>Sal volatile</HI>
or <HI>Harts-horn,</HI> or a Spoonful of <HI>compound
Poeony</HI> Water, to prevent its curdling; that,
in a Year or two his <HI>Fits</HI> had entirely left
him: and that now, for <HI>seventeen Years,</HI> he
had enjoyed as good Health as human Na∣ture
was capable of, except that once in a
damp Air and foggy Weather, rideing thro'
<HI>Essex,</HI> he had been seized with an <HI>Ague,</HI>
which he had got over, by chewing the <HI>Bark.</HI>
He told me, he could then play six Hours at
<HI>Cricket</HI> on <HI>Banstead-Down,</HI> without Fatigue
or Lowness, and was more <HI>active</HI> and <HI>clear</HI> in
his <HI>Faculties and Senses</HI> than ever he had been
in his Life before. He informed me also of
a great many Persons he had cured of invete∣rate
Distempers by this <HI>Diet,</HI> and particularly
that he had removed the <HI>Barrenness</HI> of some
<PB N="337" REF="371"/>
great Families by it, who before had wanted
<HI>Heirs.</HI></P>
<P>§. VI. HAVING thus fully satisfy'd all
my Doubts and Difficulties, I return'd to
<HI>London,</HI> fully determin'd to enter upon this
Course, for which I was sufficiently before
prepared, by the low <HI>Animal Diet,</HI> and
small Quantity of fermented Liquors, I had
of a long Time been accustomed to. I
drank <HI>Cow-Milk</HI> from the <HI>Park</HI> every Morn∣ing,
and engag'd a Milk Woman, at a
higher Price than ordinary, to bring me
every Day as much pure and unmix'd, as
might be sufficient for <HI>Dinner</HI> and <HI>Breakfast;</HI>
(for, as I mentioned before, I had given over
all Kinds of <HI>Suppers,</HI> and never after re∣sum'd
them, having always found myself
worse on the slightest Attempts that way at
Night, tho' even in Milk and Vegetables.)
I used <HI>Seeds, Bread, mealy Roots,</HI> and <HI>Fruit</HI>
with my Milk indifferently, taking them all
to be pretty near of the same Nature and
Class of Foods: <HI>Milk</HI> being <HI>Vegetables</HI> im∣mediately
cook'd by <HI>Animal Heat</HI> and <HI>Organs,</HI>
and directly (without going the Circulation)
drawn from their <HI>Chyle,</HI> or from an <HI>Emulsion</HI> of
Vegetables in the Stomach. I thought scarce any
grown Person was so delicately fram'd by Na∣ture,
or that I was not reduced to such extreme
Weakness, that <HI>infinitesimal</HI> Errors, could do
great Hurt; and therefore I continued all these,
<PB N="338" REF="372"/>
for a little Variety, lest I should be cloy'd by
only one Kind of Food; and ever since have
used and prescribed <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> indif∣ferently,
in extreme low and dangerous Cases
only, when sufficiently prepared by <HI>Culinary
Heat and Organs,</HI> and am persuaded they differ
little in their Nature. In five or six Months
I was considerably recovered; only upon the
<HI>Glands</HI> being loaded, and the peccant Matter
of the old Habit being thrown upon the <HI>chyli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erous</HI>
Duct, and the constantly ensuing Op∣pression
and Restlesness thereupon; I was forced
to cleanse them often by a gentle <HI>Vomit,</HI> or an
<HI>Aloetick Pill,</HI> which as constantly restored me
to my usual clear and free Spirits, and to a
good Appetite for my then Food.</P>
<P>§. VII. BY this Time I had been ex∣tremely
reduced in my Flesh, and was be∣come
Lank, Fleet and Nimble; but still,
upon any Error even in this low Diet, I
found more or less Oppression and Lowness.
Next Spring tho' I began to feel a constant
Pain, fix'd in the <HI>Pit</HI> of my <HI>Stomach,</HI> which I
mistook for a <HI>Pulmonary</HI> Case, and therefore
became still more temperate and abstemious
even in this my Milk and Seed Diet. Dure∣ing
all this Time, I generally rode a
Horseback ten, or fifteen Miles a Day,
both Summer and Winter; in Summer on
the <HI>Downs</HI> at <HI>Bath,</HI> and in Winter on the
<HI>Oxford Road</HI> from <HI>London.</HI> I began more fre∣quently
<PB N="339" REF="373"/>
then to take an <HI>Aloetick Pill,</HI> once
in ten or fourteen Days, (for <HI>Rhubarb</HI> never
agreed with me) which always gave me
great present Relief in my <HI>Stomach,</HI> and
consequently in my <HI>Spirits.</HI> All this Time
I followed the Business of my <HI>Profession,</HI>
with great Diligence and Attention, in Sum∣mer
at <HI>Bath,</HI> and in Winter at <HI>London,</HI> ap∣plying
myself more particularly to <HI>chroni∣cal,</HI>
and especially to low and nervous <HI>Cases,</HI>
they seeming more immediately to concern
my self, and offering more frequently at
<HI>Bath,</HI> where all of that Kind, in both
<HI>Islands,</HI> arrive first or last, who can afford it.</P>
<P>§. VIII. THE Pain in the <HI>Pit</HI> of my <HI>Sto∣mach,</HI>
being now constant, violent, and
seeming to increase, I began to think of
Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI>'s Chewing the <HI>Bark</HI> to cure his
Ague; and knowing it to be so sovereign a
Remedy in <HI>Stomach and Nervous</HI> Cases, I
got some of the finest, and chewed about
half a <HI>Dram</HI> of it twice or three times a
Day, on an empty <HI>Stomach;</HI> and in ten Days
or three Weeks at most, I found so wonderful
a Change on my whole Man, as to <HI>Spirits,
Chearfulness, Strength</HI> and <HI>Appetite,</HI> by it, that
I thought it <HI>Enchantment,</HI> and could scarce
believe I was myself; and had I been much
<HI>Enthusiastically</HI> given, would have accounted
it <HI>Miraculous,</HI> being naturally one of these
<HI>Quick-Thinkers,</HI> who have a great Sensibi∣lity
<PB N="340" REF="374"/>
either of Pleasure or Pain. My Juices
being thin, sweet, and fluid by the <HI>Diet,</HI> it
seems there was nothing wanting to the per∣fecting
Health, but the winding up and
bracing the Solids, for which the <HI>Bark</HI> was
<HI>specifick.</HI> From that Time forward I en∣creas'd
in <HI>Spirits, Strength, Appetite</HI> and
<HI>Gaiety,</HI> till I began to find a Craving and
insufferable Longing for more Solid and
Toothsome Food, and for higher and
stronger Liquors; but being well apprised
of the Danger of too sudden and quick a
<HI>Transition,</HI> from a low to a high and fuller
<HI>Diet;</HI> I proceeded at first with great Cau∣tion
and Wariness, eating only the Wing
of a small Chick, and drinking but one
Glass of white Wine (for I found all red,
and especially <HI>French,</HI> by a grating on my
lax <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Guts,</HI> keep me awake
three or four Hours in the Night) all that
Summer and the next Winter (which I pass'd
at <HI>London</HI>) I enjoyed perfect good Health
and Spirits, tho' I had used little or no Ex∣ercise;
but notwithstanding all my Caution,
I had certainly gone too fast and too far
into this new <HI>animal Diet;</HI> for the Spring
following I was seized with a <HI>depuratory
Fever,</HI> which notwithstanding all the Skill
and Care of my Brethren, the <HI>Physicians,</HI>
lasted above 20 Days, and the Medicine
(after the universal Evacuations) that had
the greatest Share in my Recovery, was, I
<PB N="341" REF="375"/>
think, large Draughts of warm <HI>Barley</HI> Water or
small <HI>Sack-Whey, acidulated</HI> with <HI>Gas Sulph.</HI>
which was advis'd by Dr. <HI>Baynard,</HI> towards the
latter End of my <HI>Fever;</HI> this, at last, threw me
into a profuse <HI>Sweat,</HI> which lasted above three
or four Days, and reduc'd me so extremely
low, that for some Time I liv'd chiefly on
<HI>French</HI> Claret, with Water and toasted Bread,
this being the only Food I could relish; and
tho' I never exceeded half a <HI>Pint,</HI> or at
most a <HI>Pint</HI> of Wine a day, mixed with Wa∣ter,
yet having used myself to so little for a
great while before, this small Quantity kept
me perpetually <HI>Hectical</HI> and Restless for
many Weeks, even after the <HI>Crise:</HI> so that
I began to think I had done wrong before,
in useing myself to so little Wine; and
therefore to secure against such an Accident
for the future, I began (after my perfect
Recovery) to inure myself by Degrees to
more Wine, gradually dropping or lessening
the Quantity of my <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> and
by slow Degrees and in moderate Quantities,
living only on the lightest and tenderest
animal Food for some Time, and at last
gradually went into common Life, with great
<HI>Freedom,</HI> but exact common <HI>Temperance.</HI></P>
<P>§. IX. But the long and violent <HI>depuratory
Fever,</HI> which I did not get over entirely in
less than six Months, had so drain'd, drench'd
and wasted me, that upon my total Recovery
<PB N="342" REF="376"/>
my Appetite being insatiable, I suck'd up
and retain'd the <HI>Juices</HI> and <HI>Chyle</HI> of my Food
like a <HI>Sponge,</HI> and thereby suddenly grew
<HI>plump, fat</HI> and <HI>hale</HI> to a Wonder; but indeed
too fast. However, for near twenty Years, I
continued <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ober, moderate</HI> and <HI>plain</HI> in my
Diet, and in my greatest Health drank not
above a Quart, or three Pints at most, of
<HI>Wine</HI> any Day, (which I then absurdly thought
necessary in my Bulk and <HI>Stowage,</HI> tho' cer∣tainly
by far an over <HI>Dose</HI>) and that at Din∣ner
only, one half with my Meat, with
Water, the other after, but none more that
Day, never tasting any Supper, and at Break∣fast
nothing but Green Tea, without any
<HI>Eatable;</HI> but by these Means every Dinner
necessarily became a <HI>Surfeit</HI> and a <HI>Debauch,</HI>
and in ten or twelve Years, I swell'd to such
an enormous Size, that upon my last Weigh∣ing
I exceeded 32 <HI>Stone.</HI> My Breath became
so short, that upon stepping into my Chariot
quickly, and with some Effort, I was ready
to faint away, for want of Breath, and my Face
turn'd Black. At <HI>Aynhoe</HI> (waiting on the late
Honourable Mrs. <HI>Cartwright</HI>) and going up
only one Pair of Stairs, with high Steps,
hastily, by pushing my Breath a little too
violently, to make room for those that were
following, I was immediately seiz'd with a
<HI>Convulsive Asthma,</HI> returning by repeated
and strong Inspirations, <HI>Fits</HI> and small In∣tervals,
which lasted above a Quarter of an
<PB N="343" REF="377"/>
Hour, so that I thought to have died on the
Spot; but by <HI>Evacuations</HI> and <HI>low Living,</HI>
I got rid of this Disorder also, in some De∣gree,
tho' after that, I was not able to walk
up above one Pair of Stairs at a Time,
without extreme Pain and Blowing, being
forced to ride from Door to Door in a Cha∣riot
even here at <HI>Bath;</HI> and if I had but an
Hundred Paces to walk, was oblig'd to have
a Servant following me with a Stool to rest on.</P>
<P>§. X. ABOUT this Time (twelve Years
after my first Recovery) my Legs broke
out all over in <HI>scorbutick Ulcers,</HI> the <HI>Ichor</HI>
of which corroded the very Skin, where it
lay any Time, and the fore Parts of both
Legs were one continued Sore. I had the
Advice and Care of many of the most emi∣nent
<HI>Surgeons</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> none of whom
could heal them up even in three Years.
Tir'd out at last, I took <HI>Aethiops Mineral</HI>
for four Months, in the midst of Winter:
half an Ounce at least twice a Day, and a
Purge with twelve Grains of <HI>Calomel</HI> once a
Week, observing a much lower Diet than
before; I found that the <HI>Mercury</HI> had not
only colour'd the <HI>Money</HI> in my Pocket, and
the <HI>Buttons</HI> in my Shirt; but to all my Ob∣servation,
the very Substance of the <HI>Aethiops</HI>
was transpir'd upon the <HI>Plaister,</HI> every
Day, when my Legs were dress'd, <HI>viz.</HI> to∣wards
the End of the Cure; at least, the Ap∣pearances
seem'd to me, on the Plaisters, like
<PB N="344" REF="378"/>
a Steam or Smoke from <HI>Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Mercury,</HI>
and was quite different from what it had been
before I began that Course: This I was per∣fectly
assured of, tho' I did not then think of
making such a <HI>critical</HI> Observation, as that
<HI>this</HI> Instance might serve as a Proof, that the
<HI>Aethiops</HI> passed through the Habit; tho' I am
certain since, from repeated <HI>Observations,</HI> that
every Preparation of <HI>Mercury,</HI> and even the
<HI>Crude</HI> itself, in Time, and in some lax Habits,
will <HI>Salivate</HI> in some Degree or another: and
that <HI>Mercury,</HI> in its <HI>minutest Particles</HI> and in∣sensible
<HI>Steams,</HI> does penetrate the solid Parts of
all <HI>living Animals,</HI> as <HI>inflammable Spirits</HI> most
certainly do. After this Course, my Legs heal∣ed
perfectly, with common Dressings, and have
continued sound ever since; my Health was
likewise very good for four or five Years after,
But continuing the same full, tho' (commonly
accounted) <HI>temperate Diet,</HI> and using little
or no Exercise, I became at last <HI>Heavy,
Dull</HI> and <HI>Lethargick</HI> to an extream Degree,
especially after Dinner; and the <HI>Midsummer</HI>
1723. I was seiz'd with a severe <HI>Symptoma∣tick
Fever,</HI> which terminated in the most
violent <HI>Erisipelas,</HI> and with the largest and
fullest Blisters all over my Thighs, that I had
ever seen. I suffered extremely in the Sympto∣matick
<HI>Fever,</HI> by violent <HI>Headaches,</HI> great <HI>Sick∣nesses</HI>
and <HI>Sinking;</HI> and having lately had two
full-bodied Patients, who had died of <HI>Mor∣tifications</HI>
from that Distemper, I was much
frightened at mine. My Blood was then, I
<PB N="345" REF="379"/>
found, one continued <HI>impenetrable Mass</HI> of
<HI>Glew,</HI> and my <HI>Erisypelatous</HI> Inflammations
were so painful (and attended with <HI>Lowness,
Sinking</HI> and <HI>Inquietude</HI>) as reduc'd me to the
very last Degree of Misery. I had always
resolv'd, upon any great Change in my
Health, to return to my <HI>old Friends, Milk</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> and to abstain from Wine in
a great measure, provided I had but suffici∣ent
Warning by any <HI>Chronical</HI> Illness. I
then made a long Journey in a Coach, and
liv'd on <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>white Meats,</HI> drinking
<HI>Bristol</HI> Water, and only a <HI>Pint</HI> of Wine a
Day, by which I was somewhat relieved,
tho' not so much as to conquer my Fears or
my Sufferings; so that having continued this
Method for two Months, I began gradually
to lessen the Quantity of my <HI>Animal</HI> Food
still more, and at last, to live entirely on <HI>Milk</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables:</HI> This, in some Time, made my
Spirits vastly better; but still, for two Years,
I was regularly and <HI>periodically</HI> seiz'd every
third Month, almost to a Day, with this <HI>Eri∣sypelas,</HI>
the Symptoms of which were indeed
not so grievous as at first, tho' still attended
with violent <HI>Headaches,</HI> a <HI>Symptomatick Fe∣ver</HI>
for forty-eight Hours before the <HI>Erup∣tion,</HI>
large Blisters full of <HI>Scorbutick Ichor,</HI>
and great Lowness for the Space of a Week;
after which I recovered my <HI>pristine</HI> State.
But I was always obliged to <HI>vomit</HI> before
the Eruption, to push it out: And relieve
the <HI>Headach</HI> and <HI>Fever:</HI> and to purge after
<PB N="346" REF="380"/>
it was over. Thus I went on for seven or
eight Months, wasting daily, but at the same
Time recovering Spirits, Activity, and the
Use of my Limbs. I had all that Winter had
a slight Pain in the back <HI>Tendon</HI> of my left
Leg, reaching down to my Heel, which in
<HI>March</HI> following terminated in a regular Fit
of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in the Joint of my <HI>big Toe;</HI>
this confin'd me a Fortnight or three Weeks,
and it had no sooner left that Place, than
it seiz'd my <HI>Shoulder Joints,</HI> where it con∣tinued
for above a Month. I pass'd the
rest of the Summer pretty tolerably, but
for these <HI>periodical</HI> Returns of that <HI>Erisypelas,</HI>
which continued very regular, above two
Years. About the <HI>Michaelmass</HI> of that Sum∣mer,
I was seiz'd with such a perpetual
<HI>Sickness, Reaching, Lowness, Watchfulness,
Eructation,</HI> and <HI>Melancholy,</HI> continuing six
or eight Months: that Life was no longer
supportable to me, and my Misery was al∣most
extreme.</P>
<P>§ XI. At last, my Sufferings were not
to be expressed, and I can scarce describe,
or reflect on them without <HI>Horror.</HI> A <HI>per∣petual
Anxiety</HI> and <HI>Inquietude,</HI> no <HI>Sleep</HI> nor
Appetite, a constant <HI>Reaching, Gulping,</HI> and
fruitless Endeavour to <HI>pump</HI> up <HI>Flegm, Wind,</HI>
or <HI>Choler</HI> Day and Night: A <HI>constant Colick,</HI>
and an ill Taste and Savour in my Mouth and
Stomach, that overcame and <HI>poisoned</HI> every
<PB N="347" REF="381"/>
Thing I got down; a <HI>melancholy Fright</HI> and
<HI>Pannick,</HI> where my Reason was of no Use to
me: So that I could scarce bear the Sight of my
Patients, or Acquaintances, that had not been
daily about me, and yet could not bear being
a Moment alone, every Instant expecting the
Loss of my <HI>Faculties</HI> or <HI>Life;</HI> and surely no∣thing
but <HI>Almighty Power</HI> preserved them
both, such as they are. I had a constant
violent Pain in the <HI>Neck</HI> of my <HI>Stomach,</HI> and
was obliged almost every Week to take a
strong <HI>Emetick,</HI> without which I could not
enjoy a Moment's Ease, besides daily urging
with my Finger, or chewing <HI>Tobacco.</HI> I had
Recourse to my old Friend the <HI>Quinquina</HI> in
several Shapes, but to no Purpose. I drank
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters without sensible Relief. I
went out in my Chariot, in the coldest Winter
Weather, for four Hours every Day; but
nothing mitigated my Suffering. At last I
tried the <HI>Foetids,</HI> the <HI>Gums,</HI> the <HI>Volatiles</HI> and
<HI>Vipers</HI> Powders (not indeed regularly and
steadily) but all in vain. In <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, I had Re∣course
to <HI>Opiats,</HI> which I knew were a slow
<HI>Poison;</HI> but one wil stick at nothing for
even a Moment's Respite in such Extremi∣ties.
This, instead of relieving, aggravated
my Miseries; for so soon as the stupifying
and confounding Effects of them were over,
my Anxiety and Sinking was so extream
after, that I was forced to repeat them so
often, and in so large Doses, that I was just∣ly
<PB N="348" REF="382"/>
afraid, lest by their becoming so familiar,
they would, at last, lose even the poor, di∣stracting,
uncomfortable Relief they afforded
me; yet all this Time, I attended indeed (in
a Manner) the Business of my <HI>Profession,</HI> and
took <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Exercise</HI> regularly in the Day∣time;
but in such a wretched, dying Condi∣tion
as was evident to all that saw me. I had
many different and contradictory Advices,
from my Friends and Acquaintances, who
observed my Misery; but I neither could,
from the Nature of my Distemper, nor from
the ill Effects the smallest Tryals of any
Thing proposed, were attended with, conti∣nue
them any time. I well knew my Case was
the <HI>Gouty</HI> and <HI>Erisypelatous</HI> Matter retired, and
drawn into my Stomach and Bowels: I like∣wise
knew, that if I took hot and strong
Medicines and <HI>Cordials</HI> to drive them out (as
is usual) I should thereby lose all the Pains
I had taken, and the Benefit of the Absti∣nence
I had gone through, to thin and sweeten
my Blood and Juices, to open the Obstruc∣tions,
and to obtain an <HI>Extirpative Cure,</HI> if
possible there might be Time enough remain∣ing
for it; but the worst was, my <HI>Stomach</HI>
would not retain any Medicine, for they
had a present ill Effect, by making my Suf∣ferings
more intense; however, I was per∣swaded
then to take a little strong warm Wine
made with <HI>Spices,</HI> and to have Bread and
this Wine mixed for my Dinner: Conti∣nuing
<PB N="349" REF="383"/>
Tea, with boiled Milk, and toasted
Bread for Breakfast; but all this time I had
no sensible Relief. My <HI>Family</HI> and <HI>Relations</HI>
pressed me extreamly to go for <HI>London</HI> (where
I had not been for many Years) to pass the
Dead of the Winter among my old Acquaint∣ances
and Friends, for Amusement and Diver∣sion
only: but to this I was extreamly averse,
apprehending I might be teized to change
my <HI>Regimen,</HI> and sneer'd at by the Free-livers;
and being convinced, from former
Experience, that if my Life was to be sav'd,
it was only by this <HI>Regimen,</HI> at least, if
my Time of <HI>Dissolution</HI> was come, I knew
I should die under less Misery by it, than
by any other Means.</P>
<P>§. XII. HOWEVER, at last, to prevent
<HI>Friendly Teazing,</HI> and the <HI>Character</HI> of Obsti∣nacy,
I promised to be <HI>passive,</HI> and to be go∣verned
by them; so in the Beginning of <HI>De∣cember</HI>
1725, I set out, and with great Diffi∣culty
got to <HI>London.</HI> Next Day after my Arri∣val,
I sent to the very <HI>learned, ingenious,</HI> my very
<HI>worthy Friends,</HI> Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Brox∣holm,</HI>
who, at my Desire, brought with them
Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> and the <HI>late</HI> Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> with Dr.
<HI>Douglas</HI> and Dr. <HI>Campbel,</HI> all <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of
great Learning, Worth and Experience.
They unanimously advised me to try a warm
<HI>chalybeat</HI> Electuary, with <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters,
and by all Means to drop my <HI>Opi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts;</HI> for as
<PB N="350" REF="384"/>
to <HI>Cathartics,</HI> which were mentioned, they
so exceedingly sunk and ruffled me, that I
was always dying under them. This <HI>Method</HI>
being reasonable and just, I followed some
time, continuing tho' the same <HI>Regimen of
Diet:</HI> And tho' some of those <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and
others thought I might have then, with
Safety, changed my <HI>Diet,</HI> very slowly, at least.
Yet having passed through the same <HI>Course</HI>
twenty Years before, and having suffered to
such Extremity, and in a younger and more
vigorous Part of my Life, and run the utmost
Hazard, even by a very slow and gradual
<HI>Change:</HI> And knowing the Danger others had
undergone by the like <HI>Change;</HI> I was firmly
resolved to continue my <HI>Regimen,</HI> happen
what wou'd; and indeed when all this was
represented to these <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and <HI>my other
Friends,</HI> none had the Courage to press it;
much less to urge it, in so <HI>insolent</HI> and <HI>sneer∣ing</HI>
a <HI>Manner</HI> as some, who ridicule all <HI>Shame</HI>
and <HI>Truth,</HI> have thought fit falsly to repre∣sent
it. I have once or twice, in nine or ten
Years, been tempted to eat an Ounce or two
of young tender <HI>animal</HI> Food, but with such
sensible Suffering and Oppression after, that I
have resolved never more to make the Tryal:
And I have known others much younger than
I, on whom a <HI>potch'd Egg,</HI> under so long and
strict a <HI>vegetable Diet,</HI> for an <HI>Epileptick</HI> Case,
has had a disagreeable Effect. As the Winter
advanced, meeting with some true <HI>Sylphi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI>
<PB N="351" REF="385"/>
to join with these other Medicines, I became
somewhat easier and more chearful by the
Spring, though almost every Month I was
forc'd to have Recourse to a strong <HI>Vomit</HI> to
clear the <HI>Glands:</HI> But by these warm <HI>chaly∣beat</HI>
Medicines, and the <HI>vitriolick</HI> Waters,
and drinking near half a Pint, or rather
a Gill of <HI>Port</HI> a Day, I had, by the <HI>May</HI>
following, forced out such a Fit of an
<HI>Erisypelas,</HI> as the best and most experienced
Surgeons (who then treated me) had never
seen the like: the whole <HI>Leg, Thigh,</HI> and
<HI>Abdomen</HI> being <HI>tumified, incrusted,</HI> and <HI>burnt</HI>
almost like the Skin of a <HI>roasted Pig:</HI> And
such a Quantity of <HI>Ichor</HI> issued from it, as
was not to be expressed; at last it ended in
a <HI>sinuous Ulcer</HI> in my Leg, which confined me
near two Months, and the <HI>sinking Effects</HI>
were not quite worn off in almost six; how∣ever
I passed the next Winter again in <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
much better, and in the Spring was ex∣treamly
<HI>easy, active</HI> and <HI>gay;</HI> for from the
Time of this last and most severe <HI>erisipelatous
Paroxysm,</HI> I reckon I mended daily: For this
had the same Effect upon my whole Consti∣tion
now, as the <HI>depuratory Fever</HI> before-mentioned
had then, both being the <HI>Cris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>
and <HI>Period</HI> of my Distemper, and the Begin∣ning
of my perfect Recovery. This was
above six Years since, tho' I became not per∣fectly
well till the Spring following, and in∣deed
<PB N="352" REF="386"/>
not absolutely so, till about four Years
ago.</P>
<P>§. XIII. UPON the Whole, as in my
<HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Scorbutical</HI> Disorder, I had
continued my <HI>Milk, Seed,</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI>
Diet, with proper Evacuations, for above
two Years, before I obtain'd a compleat Re∣covery,
so in this last Illness, I had observ'd
the same Regimen near twice as long, be∣fore
my Health was perfectly established;
being in the first Case twenty Years younger
than in the last; tho' my Excesses were
much more violent in the Time preceding
my first Illness, than between that and the
last, having, during all that Interval, scarce
once been heated with Wine, and never eat∣ing
<HI>Animal Food</HI> but once a Day. But my
exceeding Bulk and Want or Inability of
necessary Exercise, and a continued, tho' tem∣perate
Fulness, with the Difference of twenty
Years in my Age, concurred to make the
<HI>Paroxysms</HI> even more distracting and painful,
as well as more durable in this last <HI>Case.</HI>
And after all I have said of my Excesses,
especially in Liquor, if it be considered, that
I was near <HI>thirty</HI> Years Old before I drank
scarce any thing strong, at least, for a Con∣tinuance:
and that for near one half of the
Time since, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>Thirty</HI> to <HI>Sixty,</HI> I
scarce drank any strong Liquor at all: It
will be found, that upon the Whole, I
<PB N="353" REF="387"/>
drank very little above a Pint of Wine, or
at most, not a Quart one Day with ano∣ther,
since I was near thirty: And I was ne∣ver
six times in my Life overtaken with
Wine, and scarce ever tasted any distilled
Liquors, but as a Medicine, however mix'd
or brew'd. Always believing them to be
actual <HI>Cauteries,</HI> and almost direct <HI>Poison</HI>
to an Animal Habit, from their Nature,
and the Delicacy of the <HI>animal Machine:</HI>
And during that whole Time, I scarce
ever eat <HI>Animal</HI> Food above once a Day. But
Temperance is a mere <HI>relative</HI> Thing; and
by much Observation I find, that notwith∣standing
my <HI>large Size,</HI> I was not made to
bear <HI>Animal Food</HI> and fermented Liquors in
any Quantity, without suffering to the last De∣gree.
But I believe none will ever be brought
to such a <HI>Regimen</HI> as mine is now, without
having been first extremely Miserable; and
I think Common Life, with Temperance,
is best for the Generality, else it would not
be Common. But extreme Cases require ex∣traordinary
Remedies.</P>
<P>§. XIV. I FOUND I never began to reco∣ver
fully and lastingly, either first or last,
till my Blood had entirely lost its <HI>Size</HI> (which
I came to know by an accidental Occasion
for opening a Vein) and all the former Ha∣bit
(except the mere <HI>Organical Membranes
and Solids</HI>) was wasted, wore away, and
<PB N="354" REF="388"/>
discharged by <HI>Evacuations,</HI> Diet and Exer∣cise;
for I had wasted and lost of my former
Size and Bulk, in this last Illness, almost one
third in Weight and Measure: and had pass'd
through a State of entire bodily <HI>Purification,</HI>
and a true <HI>Cyclus Metasyncriticus,</HI> both first and
last, before I began to recover and fill up
again. <HI>Vomits</HI> were the first Evacuations
that with any Relief, or without infinite
<HI>Ruffling,</HI> I could bear: and so soon as I could
endure gentle Stomach <HI>Cathartics,</HI> I began
already to mend; but no sooner had I reco∣vered
any Degree of Ease and Freedom, but
my Appetite and Digestion returned to their
usual Stint towards my new Food, and <HI>Vomits</HI>
were no longer necessary nor indeed useful,
they being only required to squeeze the in∣ternal
<HI>Glands,</HI> open <HI>Obstructions,</HI> and pump
up the <HI>Wind, Choler,</HI> and <HI>Phlegm</HI> from the
<HI>Alimentary Tube</HI> when lodged there.</P>
<P>§. XV. UPON any Accident, Disorder,
or any greater Oppression or Anxiety than
ordinary, arising naturally in the Course of
the Cure, I found that living even much
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower</HI> under my <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable Diet</HI> for
two or three Days at least, would always
help me out again, and restore me to my
usual <HI>Serenity</HI> and <HI>Freedom,</HI> (for I found
Temperance necessary even in this, as well
as a higher Diet, tho' Excesses were not at∣tended
with such <HI>extreme Suffering</HI>) and
<PB N="355" REF="389"/>
scarce any time less than three Days would do
it; for tho' all my Symptoms were less severe
under it, yet I found by indulging a <HI>false
Appetite,</HI> or a <HI>liquorish Palate</HI> even in it,
that I exasperated these <HI>milder Symptoms,</HI> at
least to such a Degree, as was sufficient to
convince me, that the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>digestive
Organs</HI> were the primary and principal <HI>De∣linquents,
Sufferers,</HI> and <HI>Patients,</HI> in most, if
not in all <HI>nervous</HI> Symptoms, tho' this was
not always sensible and manifest: And that
by using them tenderly, and abstemiously, all
the rest of the <HI>Animal Functions</HI> were propor∣tionably
reliev'd. And, I think, I never once
departed from the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of the <HI>Alimentary
Gospel,</HI> and indulged in <HI>Onions</HI> and <HI>Garlick,
viz.</HI> the <HI>poignant, hard, spicy,</HI> or <HI>unctuous</HI> Vege∣tables,
with much Butter or Oil, or in a greater
Quantity than usual, even of the common ones
for any Time, but that I suffered Pains and
Penalties in Proportion.</P>
<P>§. XVI. I FOUND all my <HI>Restlesness, Watch∣ings,</HI>
and want of Tranquillity or found
Sleep, to be owing entirely to <HI>Inflation,</HI> stored
up <HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>Flatulence,</HI> constantly urge∣ing
and stimulating as it were with its <HI>Spring,
Elasticity</HI> and <HI>Points,</HI> the tender sensible
<HI>Membranes</HI> of the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Guts,</HI> and
the whole <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Membranes</HI> of the
<HI>Abdomen;</HI> for upon <HI>Fasting</HI> some Time, <HI>Eating</HI>
very little, or very thin, light and soft Food,
<PB N="356" REF="390"/>
or on using a great deal of more <HI>Exercise,</HI> to
urge the <HI>Perspiration,</HI> and to throw off and
discharge this <HI>Wind, Vapour,</HI> or <HI>sharp Steams,</HI>
I found my Sleep return in a greater Degree;
and I am bold to say, where no manifest
<HI>Fever, acute Pain, interrupted Circulation,</HI>
or <HI>spoil'd Organ</HI> is the Case, that want of
Sleep and natural Rest proceeds from the
Disorders of the <HI>Alimentary Tube,</HI> continual∣ly,
tho' perhaps not sensibly, stimulated by
this <HI>Vapour.</HI> And hence it is, that <HI>Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣foetida,
Volatiles, Foetid Gums,</HI> gentle <HI>Diapho∣reticks</HI>
and <HI>Opiats,</HI> procure Sleep; merely
by encreasing and promoting <HI>Perspiration,</HI>
and expelling this twitching <HI>Vapour</HI> or <HI>Steam,</HI>
for which they ought chiefly to be used;
and this serves to shew the Necessity, and
infinite Preference of Exercise to all <HI>Anodyne</HI>
Medicines whatsoever, and even to <HI>Cordials,
Diaphoreticks</HI> and <HI>Volatiles,</HI> except as a pre∣sent
Relief, <HI>Whip</HI> or <HI>Spur</HI> only.</P>
<P>§. XVII. WANT of Appetite and Digestion
mostly proceeds from the Thickness, Gross∣ness,
and Viscidity of the Juices and of the
whole Mass of Blood; every <HI>Vein</HI> and <HI>Ar∣tery</HI>
thereby becoming like so many <HI>Black-Puddings,</HI>
or leathern Pipes, stuff'd with a
<HI>glewy</HI> or tenacious Fluid: by which all
the <HI>Secretions</HI> being more scanty, and less
being expended by them, less can be re∣ceived
thro' the <HI>Lacteals</HI> into the Blood;
<PB N="357" REF="391"/>
which shews the Necessity and Preference of
the <HI>ponderous</HI> and deobstruent Medicines to
procure an Appetite and Digestion, even to
<HI>Bitters, Cordials</HI> or <HI>Chalybeats</HI> themselves:
whose Efficacy principally lies in strengthen∣ing
the Solids, and winding up and contract∣ing
the <HI>Fibres,</HI> to make them play, and com∣press
with greater Force the circulating Fluids,
which can never solidly answer the Intention
of <HI>Digestion</HI> and <HI>Appetite.</HI> And accordingly
by <HI>Quicksilver, Aethiops, Cinnabar,</HI> but espe∣cially
by <HI>Mercurius Alcalisatus,</HI> and other <HI>mer∣curial</HI>
Preparations, I have been always able to
cure the Disorders of the <HI>Alimentary Tube,</HI> In∣appetency,
and even <HI>Colicks,</HI> when scarce any
other Method or Medicine could effect it.
And seeing, by a thin, cool <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>vegetable
Diet</HI> long continued, I found my Appetite
full as good as before, and likewise my
<HI>Strength, Activity, Flesh</HI> and <HI>Complexion,</HI> and
every <HI>Power, Organ</HI> and <HI>Faculty</HI> restor'd to as
great a Degree as I could justly expect at my
Time of Life, had no such Disorder ever hap∣pen'd;
it appears that the <HI>Fluids</HI> are chiefly
and primarily the Seat of Disorders: and
that when they are sufficiently <HI>sweetened</HI> and
<HI>diluted,</HI> they generally leave the <HI>Solids</HI> with a
sufficient Force and Spring to play such
Fluids off, and circulate them fully and free∣ly;
and then all the <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> and
the Exercise of the Faculties will again be
pleasantly and regularly performed, as in
<PB N="358" REF="392"/>
perfect Health; for good Health supposes
this State: which does not depend on the Kind
of the <HI>Diet,</HI> though <HI>mechanical</HI> Strength does▪
So that such a <HI>Diet</HI> is only proper for the
<HI>thinking, speculative</HI> and <HI>sedentary</HI> Part of
Mankind, and not for the <HI>active, laborious</HI>
and <HI>mechanical.</HI></P>
<P>§. XVIII. AFTER I began to recover, I
found little Alteration from <HI>Cold</HI> or <HI>Heat,
Wet</HI> or <HI>Dry, Summer</HI> or <HI>Winter</HI> Seasons,
especially as to my <HI>Appetite, Spirits</HI> or
<HI>Sleep;</HI> at least not near so much as I usually
found in my best Health on these Occasions,
under a full <HI>animal</HI> and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquor
<HI>Diet;</HI> so that I can sit, and walk, and be
abroad in all Weathers, Seasons or Times of
the Year, Day or Night, without much
Dread or Hazard of Cold, and with little
Difference of Cloathing, providing I keep
my <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>chiliferous Tube</HI> clear and
clean; which often put me in mind of the
Saying of a <HI>Roman Emperor,</HI> who affirmed,
that <HI>Spitting, Coughing, Excreation, Eructa∣tion,
Yawning,</HI> and the like, were Symptoms
and Effects of mere <HI>Laziness</HI> and <HI>Luxury.</HI></P>
<P>§. XIX. AFTER I had perfectly recovered,
observing, that still, on <HI>liquid, slippery</HI> Stools,
from craming I was somewhat less lively and
chearful, and rather more <HI>grip'd</HI> and <HI>in∣flated,</HI>
I resolved to change my <HI>half Pint</HI> or
<PB N="359" REF="393"/>
<HI>Gill</HI> of <HI>Port</HI> at Dinner, into the same Quan∣tity
of <HI>Florence,</HI> thinking it more binding
and <HI>astringent.</HI> I ate at the same Time a
good deal of more <HI>Butter</HI> with my Ve∣getables,
and Plenty of <HI>old rich Cheese;</HI>
and likeing <HI>Nuts</HI> extremely, I procur'd
from Abroad and at Home, great Plenty of
all Kinds, as <HI>Filberts, Wallnuts, Chesnuts,
Almonds,</HI> &amp;c. eating them in great Quanti∣ties
after Dinner, by way of <HI>Desert.</HI> I
went on all Winter, and for eight or ten
Months in this <HI>Regimen</HI> extremely well; and
out of <HI>Wantonness,</HI> to try what my Constitu∣tion
could now bear, I indulged freely (tho'
in these only) together with my usual <HI>Milk</HI>
and <HI>Vegetable Diet.</HI> But after my common,
slight, vegetable Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> (which I still
have in the <HI>Spring,</HI> without necessary Confine∣ment,
tho' for an Hour, or altering either <HI>Re∣gimen</HI>
or <HI>Cloathing,</HI> or any other Circumstance,
but a Lameness for a few Days) I had first a
Touch of my <HI>Erisypelas</HI> on my Leg; after that
I seemingly catch'd Cold, and began to be sick
at my Stomach, <HI>Reaching, Inflated, Low-spi∣rited</HI>
and <HI>Colick'd,</HI> with restless Nights, and al∣most
all those dismal <HI>Symptoms</HI> I had gone
through in my late long Illness. I soon found
my <HI>Error,</HI> and that my Constitution could not
bear even that slight <HI>Alteration</HI> without severe
Sufferings. I had a violent <HI>humorous</HI> Cough,
and threw up great Quantities of gross viscid
Flegm, which I knew to be the <HI>Nuts,</HI> not
<PB N="360" REF="394"/>
so sufficiently digested and attenuated, as to
become thin enough to circulate freely thro'
the small Vessels: but were thrown off, and
despumated upon the larger <HI>Emunctory</HI> and
open <HI>Glands.</HI> In a Word, I suffer'd all the
Kind of Misery I had formerly, tho' not
with quite so much Violence and Duration.
I went through the former lesser <HI>Purgation</HI>
again: Repeated <HI>Vomits,</HI> took frequent Sto∣mach
<HI>Purges,</HI> chew'd <HI>Bark,</HI> return'd to the
Simplicity of my former <HI>Regimen,</HI> lessening
their Quantities, and drinking no Wine
(which I now have dropped for ever, but as
others use <HI>Spirits,</HI> for a <HI>Cordial,</HI> if wanted)
and drinking first <HI>Bristol</HI> and then <HI>Bath,</HI> and
after <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water, as the Defluxion abated;
by these Means I got quite well in about three
Months, <HI>viz.</HI> in the <HI>August</HI> after; and since
that Time, I thank GOD, I have gone on in
one constant <HI>Tenor</HI> of Diet, and enjoy as good
Health, as, at my Time of Life (being now
<HI>Sixty</HI>) I, or any Man, can reasonably expect,
and have learned that young tender animal
Food is less dangerous, in a small Quantity,
than <HI>hard, hot, spicy</HI> and <HI>oily</HI> Vegetables.</P>
<P>§. XX. I KNOW not if it be worth the
mentioning, that during my <HI>Recovery,</HI> about
four Years ago, I was thrown, or rather
threw myself, out of my <HI>Chariot</HI> (upon the
Fore-Horses being frighted, and the Coach∣man
being thrown off his Box) and falling
<PB N="361" REF="395"/>
on my Head, was taken up dead and sense∣less,
being wounded in my <HI>Temple,</HI> and the
Wheels of the Chariot having entirely shav'd
my <HI>Eye-Brow.</HI> But on being blooded, I
found my Spirits and Stomach mostly affected
with it. I grew, for some short Time, low,
feeble, and lost my Appetite; but in two or
three Months recovered to a <HI>Miracle,</HI> from
what would have kill'd another with bad Juices,
and have continued perfectly well ever since.</P>
<P>§. XXI. MY <HI>Regimen,</HI> at present, is Milk,
with <HI>Tea, Coffee, Bread</HI> and <HI>Butter, mild
Cheese, Salladin, Fruits,</HI> and <HI>Seeds</HI> of all
Kinds, with tender <HI>Roots</HI> (as <HI>Potatoes, Tur∣nips,
Carrots</HI>) and, in short, every Thing
that has not <HI>Life,</HI> dress'd, or not, as I like
it; (in which there is as much, or a
greater Variety than in <HI>animal</HI> Foods:) so that
the Stomach need never be cloyed. I drink no
<HI>Wine,</HI> nor any <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, and am
rarely dry, most of my Food being liquid,
moist, or juicy; only, after Dinner,
I drink either <HI>Coffee</HI> or <HI>green Tea,</HI> but
seldom both in the same Day, and some∣times
a Glass of soft small <HI>Cyder.</HI> The thinner
my <HI>Diet</HI> is, the easier, more cheerful and
lightsome I find myself; my Sleep is also the
founder, tho' perhaps somewhat shorter than
formerly under my full <HI>animal</HI> Diet: But then I
am more alive than ever I was, as soon as I awake
and get up. I rise commonly at <HI>Six,</HI> and go to
<PB N="362" REF="396"/>
Bed at <HI>Ten.</HI> The Order I find in this <HI>Diet,</HI>
from much Experience, is, that <HI>Milk</HI> is the
lightest and best of all Foods, being a <HI>Medium</HI>
between <HI>animal</HI> Substances and <HI>Vegetables;</HI>
dress'd <HI>Vegetables,</HI> less <HI>windy</HI> and griping, than
<HI>raw; ripe</HI> Fruit than <HI>unripe;</HI> the <HI>mealy</HI> Roots
more than the <HI>fibrous;</HI> and the <HI>dry</HI> than the
<HI>crude Vegetables.</HI> I find much <HI>Butter, Cream,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at</HI> and oily Vegetables, and especially <HI>Nuts,</HI>
both hard of Digestion, stuffing and <HI>inflating.</HI>
When I am dry (which is rarely) I drink
<HI>Bath, Bristol</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water.</P>
<P>§ XXII. I AM heartily ashamed, and
humbly beg Pardon of my <HI>polite</HI> and <HI>delicate</HI>
Readers (if any such should deign to look
into this low <HI>Tattle,</HI> contrary to my In∣tention.)
I know how <HI>indecent</HI> and <HI>shocking
Egotism</HI> is, and for an <HI>Author</HI> to make him∣self
the Subject of his Words or Works, espe∣cially
in so tedious and circumstantiated a
<HI>Detail:</HI> But so various and contradictory have
been the Reports of, and sneers on my <HI>Regimen,
Case</HI> and <HI>Sentiments,</HI> that I thought thus much
was due to Truth, and necessary for my own
Vindication; and perhaps it may not be quite
useless to some <HI>low, desponding, valetudinary,
over-grown Person,</HI> whose Case may have
some Resemblance to mine: which every
one's has in some Degree, that has a <HI>mortal
Tabernacle,</HI> subject to, and afflicted with <HI>nervous</HI>
Disorders, by a mistaken <HI>Regimen,</HI> or heredi∣tary
<PB N="363" REF="397"/>
Misfortune: and I have, on that Account,
written <HI>this</HI> in a plain <HI>narrative</HI> Stile, with the
fewest Terms of Art possible, without supposing
my <HI>Reader,</HI> or shewing <HI>myself,</HI> to have look'd
ever into a <HI>physical</HI> Book before; thinking this
<HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Stile</HI> might be most instructive
and beneficial to common <HI>valetudinary</HI> Read∣ers:
and tho' some may not have quite my
<HI>Bulk</HI> and natural Strength, or have run into
such <HI>Excesses,</HI> or have not begun to manage
so early in Life as I did first, yet they will
only for that require lesser or greater <HI>Doses</HI>
of the same <HI>Method, Medicines</HI> and Manage∣ment;
and if it have not quite so full and
perfect an Effect, as, <HI>under God,</HI> it has had
with me, (tho', perhaps, the worst Subject and
the most difficult <HI>Case</HI> possible, for so abso∣lute
a <HI>Cure</HI>) yet it may, and will always have
a better than any other Method (I mean
only in so deplorable and <HI>excruciating</HI> a <HI>Case</HI>
as mine was) and if it cannot <HI>cure,</HI> it will
certainly <HI>reprieve,</HI> and make the Sufferings
of all such miserable Persons more tolerable:
as I have experienced once and again, in the
most eminent Degrees: who, from the most
<HI>extreme Misery,</HI> do now enjoy as <HI>perfect
Health,</HI> as much <HI>Activity</HI> and <HI>Cheerfulness,</HI> with
the full, free and perfect Use of my <HI>Faculties:</HI>
a Facility of <HI>Study,</HI> and of going about the
Business of my <HI>Profession;</HI> and, in short, of
every <HI>rational Function of Life,</HI> as I was ever
capable of in my best Days: and indeed
<PB N="364" REF="398"/>
of every Thing worth living for as a <HI>free
and rational Intelligence;</HI> every Thing, I say,
except that I cannot <HI>eat</HI> and <HI>drink</HI> so highly
and voluptuously as I have formerly; and, if
I know my Heart (which I am sure I do not
fully) tho' I were to be <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>unaccount∣able,</HI>
I should live (at least wish to live in
the Main and as to <HI>Diet</HI>) as I now do, and
would not willingly and deliberately go thro'
the same <HI>Misery,</HI> for the mere Gratification
of my <HI>Senses</HI> only; no, not to obtain the
Dominion of our <HI>System,</HI> and all the <HI>Glories</HI>
and <HI>Pleasures</HI> in it. What I may happen to
do, <HI>God only knows;</HI> I am too old, I hope,
to make any new Tryals and Changes in
this my <HI>bodily Regimen;</HI> and indeed to
what Purpose? being as well as any, and
much better than most are at my Time of
Day: And therefore, with <HI>God's Grace,</HI>
if my <HI>Health, Senses</HI> and <HI>Love of Virtue</HI>
continue with me the same, I shall, I
hope, go on in the Method now described,
and <HI>live,</HI> and, I hope, <HI>die</HI> in continual Gra∣titude
to the <HI>Best of Beings,</HI> who, by an
over-ruling <HI>Providence,</HI> and, as it were, by
meer <HI>casual Hints,</HI> far beyond the Reach of
my <HI>Penetration,</HI> has irresistably (as I should
almost say, if I felt not my own <HI>Liberty</HI>)
directed the great Steps of my <HI>Life</HI> and
<HI>Health</HI> hitherto.</P>
<P>Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo.</P>

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER all the Pains I have taken, I
have not yet got so large a Share of
<HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> as to hope, by these my
poor <HI>Labours,</HI> to do Good to any, except, per∣haps,
to a few poor, low, <HI>valetudinary, dying,
miserable</HI> Creatures, who have not the Cou∣rage
<HI>magnanimously and gloriously</HI> to suffer,
pine, and putrify. The <HI>Brave,</HI> the <HI>Bold,</HI> the
<HI>Intrepid,</HI> the <HI>Heroic,</HI> who value not <HI>Pain,</HI>
who can suffer for <HI>Diversion,</HI> and who prefer
<HI>Death</HI> with a <HI>Bounce,</HI> to Life, on such Con∣ditions
as I propose: and choose rather to
<HI>extinguish</HI> now, than <HI>forty</HI> or <HI>fifty</HI> Years
hence, will heartily despise and pity me and
my <HI>Lucubrations. Nunquam persuadebis etiamsi
persuaseris.</HI> You shall never convince tho' you
convict me. I have heard of a great <HI>modern
Philosopher,</HI> celebrated for his <HI>Wit, Wealth,</HI> and
<HI>high Living,</HI> who used, in the <HI>Sun-shine</HI> of his
Days, to boast, that if <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Absti∣nence</HI>
could make a Man live half a <HI>Century</HI>
longer, in Gayety and Mirth, it were worth
the While then to <HI>deny</HI> one's Appetites; but
for <HI>Ten</HI> or a <HI>Dozen</HI> of Years more, it was but
a poor <HI>Purchase;</HI> and yet I have been told,
that the same <HI>Hero,</HI> when his <HI>Time came,</HI> would
<PB N="366" REF="400"/>
have parted with his great Estate for a <HI>Re∣prieve</HI>
of a few Years. I own I am one of
those poor <HI>mean-spirited Wretches,</HI> who am
contented to live as long as <HI>Nature</HI> design'd me
to last, and desire to submit with the utmost
<HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Resignation</HI> I can arrive at when
that <HI>Period</HI> is expired; but for <HI>Pain, Sickness,</HI>
and especially for <HI>Oppression, Anxiety</HI> and <HI>Low∣ness</HI>
avoidable, they are my <HI>mortal Aversion,</HI> and
no Means would I refuse to avoid them, but
those, which, I am convinced, would infal∣libly
bring me into greater <HI>Misery and Suf∣fering;</HI>
and yet, if I mistake not my own
Nature, I have the <HI>Appetites, Passions,</HI> and
<HI>Feelings</HI> common to other Men; and I usu∣ally
ask myself the Question, and look into
my own <HI>Heart</HI> for an <HI>Answer,</HI> to any thing
proposed concerning human <HI>Appetites, Pas∣sions</HI>
and <HI>Feelings</HI> that are <HI>natural</HI> and not
forced: and give little Credit to what others
say contrary to such <HI>Sentiments.</HI> It is true
indeed, there are as many and as different De∣grees
of <HI>Sensibility</HI> or of <HI>Feeling,</HI> as there are De∣grees
of <HI>Intelligence</HI> and Perception in <HI>human</HI>
Creatures; and the <HI>Principle</HI> of both may be
perhaps one and the same. One shall suffer more
from the Prick of a <HI>Pin,</HI> or <HI>Needle,</HI> from their
extreme Sensibility, than others from being run
thro' the Body; and the <HI>first</HI> sort, seem to be
of the <HI>Class</HI> of these <HI>Quick-Thinkers</HI> I have
formerly mentioned; and as none have it in
their <HI>Option</HI> to choose for themselves their own
<PB N="367" REF="401"/>
particular <HI>Frame</HI> of Mind, nor <HI>Constitution</HI> of
Body; so none can choose his own Degree of
<HI>Sensibility.</HI> That is given him by the <HI>Author</HI>
of his <HI>Nature,</HI> and is already determined; and
both are as various as the <HI>Faces</HI> and <HI>Forms</HI> of
Mankind are. I imagine therefore, there must
be required a <HI>particular Make</HI> and <HI>Frame,</HI> both
of <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> to determine any one to
receive heartily and pursue steadily this (as it
were) material <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> of a <HI>Regimen.</HI>
There seems to be necessary, previous to a Con∣viction
of the Benefit and Necessity of such a
State of <HI>Purification, a Je ne sçai quoi,</HI> to make
Men comprehend, embrace, and prosecute this
<HI>Self-denying</HI> Doctrine, for the sake of such in∣sensible

as well as <HI>intellectual Delicacy</HI> is want∣ing,
they will prove but short-liv'd, diffident and
dastardly <HI>material Spiritualists,</HI> and fall away
in the Time of <HI>Trial;</HI> tho' he that hath <HI>Ears to

great and extream <HI>Misery, Pain, Lowness,</HI> and
<HI>Anxiety,</HI> will go a great Way to beget this

by <HI>infinite Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> towards re∣claiming
his <HI>wandering Creatures,</HI> seem only
to be either <HI>Love</HI> or <HI>Punishment:</HI> that those
whom <HI>Love</HI> will not draw and allure, <HI>Punish∣ment</HI>
may drive and force; but neither <HI>Frame,
Disposition, Organ,</HI> nor <HI>Faculty</HI> can make their
<PB N="368" REF="402"/>
Objects, or alter their Nature, which are
<HI>Things given</HI> and determined. The immu∣table
<HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Relations of
Things</HI> are <HI>constant,</HI> and will subsist in their
Order, notwithstanding our <HI>Errors, Mistakes,
or Prejudices.</HI> And it will be <HI>eternally</HI> true,
so long as we have such Bodies, that only
<HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Abstinence, Air, Exercise,
Diet,</HI> and proper <HI>Evacuations</HI> can preserve <HI>Life,
Health,</HI> and <HI>Gayety,</HI> or cure <HI>Chronical</HI> Diseases:
I mean in general and in the main; and the
<HI>contrary</HI> will always destroy them; and that
they will ever mutually expel one another,
like <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Water.</HI> Even <HI>Homer,</HI> three
thousand Years ago, could observe, that the
<HI>Homolgians</HI> (these <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> these Milk
and Vegetable Eaters) were the <HI>longest liv'd,
and honestest of Men. Milk</HI> and <HI>Honey</HI> was
the Complexion of the <HI>Land of Promise,</HI> and
<HI>Vegetables</HI> the <HI>Diet</HI> of the <HI>Paradisiacal State:</HI>
And since such a <HI>Diet</HI> will (if any thing)
certainly cure, by the Confession of all <HI>Phy∣sicians,</HI>
learned and unlearned, ancient or mo∣dern,
<HI>High</HI> or <HI>Low-livers,</HI> the <HI>Gout,</HI> the <HI>Con∣sumption,</HI>
and the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> and such like atro∣cious,
otherwise incureable and mortal Dis∣tempers;
it will be eternally true also, <HI>Quod
potest majus potest minus,</HI> or that, what will do
to the greater, will do the less of the same Kind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
And let the <HI>Brave</HI> and <HI>Bold,</HI> the <HI>Free-living<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

and <HI>more natural</HI> Way of preserving <HI>Health</HI>
and <HI>Cheerfulness,</HI> of <HI>lengthning Life</HI> and <HI>cure∣ing
Distempers,</HI> than that founded on deep
<HI>Researches,</HI> tedious <HI>Details, study'd Ingenuity,</HI>
and <HI>Finessing,</HI> else the <HI>Poor,</HI> the <HI>Illiterate,</HI> the
<HI>Laborious,</HI> and the <HI>Solitary</HI> (the far most, if
not the least corrupted Part of our <HI>Species</HI>)
would be, of all Men, the most miserable
when sick. And accordingly it is observe∣able,
that <HI>Hippocrates, Galen, Celsus,</HI> and
others of the <HI>primitive Fathers of Physick</HI>
cured by <HI>Air, Exercise, Diet,</HI> and <HI>Evacua∣tion</HI>
mostly, if not only, even as successfully,
(tho' not quite so soon perhaps) as we by all
our <HI>Mathematicks, Natural Philosophy, Chy∣mistry,
Anatomy, Knowledge of the Materia
Medica,</HI> and <HI>Animal Oeconomy.</HI> Far be it from
me, to lessen the Value and Necessity <HI>now,</HI> of
those <HI>Divine Sciences;</HI> for since our <HI>Luxury</HI>
has kept Pace with our <HI>Knowledge:</HI> the <HI>Ob∣stinacy</HI>
and <HI>Violence,</HI> the <HI>Number</HI> and <HI>Degrees</HI>
of our <HI>Diseases</HI> have increased proportio∣nally;
and therefore <HI>He</HI> that would honestly
and successfully practise <HI>Physick,</HI> on the <HI>Pa∣tients</HI>
and <HI>Diseases now</HI> as they are, ought to
know all these mentioned <HI>Sciences,</HI> to the
greatest Degree he can possibly, to enable
him even to <HI>alleviate, mitigat, lessen</HI> or <HI>cure</HI>
these <HI>unnatural</HI> and <HI>infernal</HI> Distempers <HI>now
extant;</HI> and <HI>that Physician</HI> will never arrive
at true, natural and beautiful <HI>Simplicity,</HI>
either of the <HI>Theory</HI> or <HI>Practice of Physick,</HI>
<PB N="370" REF="404"/>
who has not passed thro' endless <HI>Multiplicity</HI>
in Study, Observation, and Experiment in
these <HI>Sciences;</HI> such a <HI>Simplicity</HI> is the
greatest Contradiction to <HI>Laziness, Foreign
Studies, Negligence, Incuriosity</HI> and <HI>Ignorance</HI>
in the Profession; but such a <HI>Simplicity</HI> (pro∣duced
by rejecting <HI>Need-not's</HI>) when (if ever)
attained, is worth a <HI>Million</HI> of these little <HI>false</HI>
and <HI>foreign Arts</HI> sometimes us'd to rise in it;
for it is, in Truth and Reality, an <HI>Eminence</HI>
of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Tranquillity.</HI></P>
