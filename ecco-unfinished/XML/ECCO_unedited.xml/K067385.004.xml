<P>THE numerous enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXVIII.</NOTE> whom Wolsey's sudden
elevation, his aspiring character, and his haughty
deportment had raised him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1515.</NOTE> served only to rivet him
faster in Henry's confidence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wolsey's administra∣tion.</NOTE> who placed a pride in sup∣porting
the choice, which he had made, and who was
incapable of yielding either to the murmurs of the people
or to the discontents of the great. That artful prelate
likewise, well acquainted with the King's imperious
temper, concealed from him the absolute ascendant,
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
which he acquired; and while he secretly directed all
public councils, he ever pretended a blind submission
to the will and authority of his master. By entering
into the King's pleasures, he still preserved his affections;
by conducting his business, he gratified his indolence;
and by his unlimited complaisance in both capacities,
he prevented all that jealousy, to which his exorbitant
acquisitions, and his splendid, ostentatious train of life
should naturally have given birth. The archbishopric
of York falling vacant by the death of Bambrige, Wolsey
was promoted to that see, and resigned the bishopric of
Lincoln. Besides enjoying the administration of Tour∣nay,
he got possession, at very low leases, of the reve∣nues
of Bath, Worcester, and Hereford, bishopricks
filled by Italians, who were allowed to reside abroad,
and who were glad to compound for this indulgence, by
parting with a considerable share of their profits. He
held in commendam the abbey of St. Albans, and many
other church preferments. He was even allowed to
unite with the see of York, first that of Durham, next
that of Winchester; and there seemed to be no end
of his acquisitions. His advancement in ecclesiastical
dignity served him as a pretence for engrossing still
more revenues; The pope, observing his great influence
over the King, was desirous of engaging him in his
interest, and had created him a cardinal. Never church∣man,
under colour of exacting regard to religion, car∣ried
to a more exorbitant height, the state and dignity
of that character. His train consisted of eight hundred
servants, of whom many were knights and gentlemen:
Some even of the nobility put their children into his
family as a place of education; and in order to ingra∣tiate
them with their patron, allowed them to bear offices
as his servants. Whoever was distinguished by any art
or science payed court to the cardinal; and none payed
court in vain. Literature, which was then in its infancy,
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
found in him a generous patron; and both by his public
institutions and private bounty, he gave encouragement
to every branch of erudition<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Erasm. Epist. lib. 2. epist. 1. lib. 16. epist. 3.</NOTE>. Not content with this
munificence, which gained him the approbation of the
wise, he strove to dazzle the eyes of the populace, by
the splendour of his equipage and furniture, the costly
embroidery of his liveries, the lustre of his apparel.
He was the first clergyman in England who wore silk
and gold, not only on his habit, but also on his sad∣dles
and the trappings of his horses<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. Stowe, p. 501. Hollingshed, p. 847.</NOTE>. He caused his
cardinal's hat to be borne aloft by a person of rank; and
when he came to the King's chapel, would permit it
to be laid on no place but the altar. A priest, the tallest
and most comely he could find, carried before him a
pillar of silver, on whose top was placed a cross: But
not content with this parade, to which he thought him∣self
intitled as cardinal, he provided another priest of
equal stature and beauty, who marched along, bearing
the cross of York, even in the diocese of Canterbury;
contrary to the antient rule and agreement between the
prelates of these rival sees<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. The people made merry
with the cardinal's ostentation; and said they were now
sensible, that one cross alone was not sufficient for the
expiation of his sins and offences.</P>
<P>WARHAM, chancellor and archbishop of Canterbury, a
man of a very moderate temper, averse to all disputes, chose
rather to retire from public employment, than maintain
an unequal contest with the haughty cardinal. He re∣signed
his office of chancellor; and the seals were im∣mediately
intrusted to Wolsey. If this new accumulation
of dignity encreased his enemies, it also served to exalt
his personal character, and prove the extent of his ca∣pacity.
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
A strict administration of justice took place
during his enjoyment of this high office; and no chan∣cellor
ever discovered greater impartiality in his decisions,
deeper penetration of judgment, or more enlarged know∣ledge
of law and equity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More. Stowe, p. 504.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, finding the King's money
almost entirely exhausted by projects and pleasures, while
his inclination for expence still continued, was glad to
resign his office of treasurer, and retire from court.
His rival, Fox, bishop of Winchester, reaped no advan∣tage
from his absence; but partly overcome by years
and infirmities, partly disgusted at the ascendant acquired
by Wolsey, withdrew himself entirely to the care of
his diocese. The duke of Suffolk had also taken offence,
that the King, by the cardinal's persuasion, had refused
to pay a debt, which he had contracted during his abode
in France; and he thenceforth affected to live in pri∣vacy.
These incidents left Wolsey to enjoy without a
rival the whole power and favour of the King; and put
into his hands every kind of authority. In vain, did
Fox, before his retirement, warn the King “not to
suffer the servant to be greater than his master:”
Henry replied, “that he knew well how to retain all
his subjects in obedience;” but he continued still an
unlimited deference in every thing to the directions and
counsels of the cardinal.</P>
<P>THE public tranquillity was so well established in
England, the obedience of the people so entire, the
general administration of justice, by the cardinal's
means<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Erasm. lib. 2, epist. 1. Cavendish, Hall.</NOTE>, so exact, that no domestic occurrence happened
so remarkable as to disturb the repose of the King and
his minister: They might even have dispensed with
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
themselves from giving any strict attention to foreign
affairs, were it possible for men to enjoy any situation in
absolute tranquillity, or abstain from projects and enter∣prizes,
however fruitless and unnec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssary.</P>
<P>THE will of the late King of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE> who left his
widow regent of the kingdom, and the vote of the con∣vention
of estates, which confirmed that destination,
had expressly limited her authority to the condition of
her remaining unmarried<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond. Herbert.</NOTE>: But notwithstanding this
limitation, a few months after her husband's death, she
espoused the earl of Angus, of the name of Douglas, a
nobleman of great family and very promising hopes. Some
of the nobility now proposed the election of Angus as
regent, and recommended this choice as the most likely
means of preserving peace with England: But the
jealousy of the great families, and the fear of exalting
the Douglasses, begot opposition to this measure. Lord
Hume in particular, the most powerful chieftain in the
kingdom, insisted on recalling the duke of Albany, son
to a brother of James the third, who had been banished
into France, and who, having there married, had left
posterity, that were the next heirs to the crown, and the
nearest relations to their young sovereign. Albany,
though first prince of the blood, had never been
in Scotland, was totally unacquainted with the man∣ners
of the people, ignorant of their Situation, un∣practiced
in their language; yet such was the favour
attending the French alliance, and so great the autho∣rity
of Hume, that this prince was invited to accept
the reins of, government. Francis, careful not to give
offence to the king of England, detained Albany some
time in France; but at last, sensible how important it
was to keep Scotland in his interests, he permitted him
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
to go over, and take possession of the regency: He even
renewed the antient league with that kingdom tho' it
implied such a close connexion, as might be thought
somewhat to intrench on his alliance with England.</P>
<P>WHEN the regent arrived in Scotland, he made en∣quiries
concerning the state of the country, and charac∣ter
of the people; and discovered a scene, with which
he was hitherto but little acquainted. That turbulent
kingdom, he found, was rather to be considered as a
confederacy, and that not a close one, of petty princes,
than a regular system of civil polity; and even the King,
much more a regent, possest an authority very uncertain
and precarious. Arms, more than laws, prevailed;
and courage, preferably to equity or justice, was the
virtue most valued and respected. The nobility, in
whom the whole power resided, were so connected by
hereditary alliances, or so divided by inveterate enmities,
that it was impossible, without employing force, either
to punish, the most flagrant guilt, or give security to the
most entire innocence. Rapine and violence, when
exercised on a hostile tribe, instead of making a person
odious among his own clan, rather recommended him to
esteem and approbation, and by rendering him useful
to the chieftain, entitled him to a preference above his
fellows. And tho' the necessity of mutual support
served as a close cement of friendship among those of the same
kindred, the spirit of revenge against enemies, and the
desire of prosecuting the deadly feuds, (so they were
called) still appeared to be passions the most predominant
among that uncultivated people.</P>
<P>THE persons, to whom Albany first applied for in∣formation
with regard to the state of the country, hap∣pened
to be inveterate enemies of Hume<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond.</NOTE>; and they
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
represented that powerful nobleman as the chief source
of public disorders, and the great obstacle to the execution
of the laws, and administration of justice. Before
the authority of the magistrate could be established, it
was necessary, they said, to make an example of this
great offender; and by the terror of his punishment,
teach all lesser criminals to pay respect to the power of
their sovereign. Albany, moved by these reasons, was
induced to forget Hume's past services, to which he had
been, in a great measure, beholden for the regency; and
he no longer bore towards him that favourable counte∣nance,
with which he was wont to receive him. Hume
perceived the change, and was incited, both by views of
his own security and his revenge, to take measures in
opposition to the regent. He applied himself to Angus
and the queen dowager, and represented to them the
danger to which the infant prince was exposed, from the
ambition of Albany, the next heir to the crown, to
whom the states had imprudently entrusted the whole
authority of government. By his perswasion, Margaret
formed the design of carrying off the young King, and
putting him under the protection of her brother; and
when that conspiracy was discovered, she herself, ac∣companied
with, Hume and Angus, withdrew into
England, where she was soon after delivered of a
daughter.</P>
<P>HENRY, in order to check the authority of Albany
and the French party, gave encouragement to these
malecontents, and assured them of his protection. Mat∣ters
being afterwards in appearance accommodated be∣tween
Hume and the regent, that nobleman returned
into his own country; but mutual suspicions and jea∣lousies
still prevailed. He was committed to custody,
under the care of the earl of Arran, his brother-in-law;
and was, for some time, detained prisoner in his castle.
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
But having perswaded Arran to enter into the conspiracy
with him, he was allowed to make his escape; and he
openly made war upon the regent. A new accommoda∣tion
ensued, not more sincere than the foregoing; and
Hume was so imprudent as to put himself, together with
his brother, into the hands of the regent. They were
immediately seized, committed to custody, brought to
their trial, condemned and executed. No legal crime
was proved against these brothers: It was only alleged,
that, at the battle of Flouden, they had not done their
duty in supporting the King; and as this backwardness
could not, from the whole course of their past life, be
ascribed to cowardice, it was commonly imputed to a
more criminal motive. The evidences, however, of guilt
produced against them, were far from, being valid or
convincing; and the people, who hated them while
alive, were very much dissatisfied with their execution.</P>
<P>SUCH violent remedies often produce, for some time,
a deceitful tranquillity; but as they destroy mutual con∣fidence,
and beget the most inveterate animosities, their
consequences are commonly very fatal both to the public,
and to those who make trial of them. The regent,
however, took advantage of the present calm which
prevailed; and being invited by the French king, who
was, at that time, willing to gratify Henry, he went
over into France; and was detained there during five
years. A great part of his authority he entrusted into
the hands of Darcy, a Frenchman, whom he created
warden, of the marches, and who was extremely vigilant
in the distribution of justice, and the punishment of
crimes and oppression. But Sir David Hume, a kinsman
of the nobleman lately executed, desirous of revenging
his friend's death on the friend of the regent, way-laid
Darcy near Dunse; and after reproaching him with that
execution, made an attack upon him. Darcy finding
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
himself too weak to resist, and trusting to the swiftness of his
horse, fled towards Dunbar; but being ignorant of the
roads, he ran into a bog, was overtaken by the pursuers,
and put to death. As he wore long flowing hair, Hume,
exulting in this assassination as a gallant exploit, cut out
these locks, and plaiting them into a wreath, wore them
ever after at the pummel of his saddle<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Pitscottie.</NOTE>. During the
absence of the regent, such confusions prevailed in Scot∣land,
and such mutual enmity, rapine, and violence
among the great families, that that kingdom was, for a
long time, utterly disabled both from offending its ene∣mies,
and assisting its friends. We have carried on the
Scots history some years beyond the present period; that
as that country had little connexion with the general
system of Europe, we might be the less interrupted in the
narration of those memorable events, which were trans∣acted
in the other kingdoms.</P>
<P>IT was foreseen, that a young, active prince, like
Francis, and of so martial a disposition, would soon em∣ploy
the great preparations, which his predecessor, before
his death, had made for the conquest of Milan. He
had been observed even to weep at the recital of the mili∣tary
exploits of Gallon de Foix; and these tears of
emulation were held to be sure prognostics of his future
valour. He renewed the treaty which Lewis had made
with Henry; and haying left every thing, as he thought,
secure behind him, he marched his armies towards the
south of France; pretending, that his sole purpose was
to secure his kingdom against the incursions of the Swiss.
That formidable people still retained their animosity
against France; and having taken Maximilian, duke of
Milan, under their protection, and indeed reduced him
to absolute dependance, they were determined, from
views both of honour and of interest, to defend him
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
against this invader<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellai, lib. 1. Guic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iardini, lib. 12.</NOTE>. They fortified themselves with
numerous forces in all those vallies of the Alps, thro'
which, they thought, the French must necessarily pass;
and when Francis, with great secrecy, industry, and per∣severance,
made his entrance into Piedmont by another<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of Francis the first.</NOTE>
passage, they were not dismayed, but descended into the
plain, tho' unprovided of cavalry, and opposed themselves
to the progress of the French arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th Sep∣tember.</NOTE> At Marignan near
Milan, they fought with Francis one of the most furious
and best contested battles, which is to be met with in the
histoiry of these latter ages; and it required all the heroic
valour of that prince to inspire his troops with courage
sufficient to resist the desperate assault of those moun∣taineers.
After a bloody action in the evening, night
and darkness parted the combatants; but next morning,
the Swiss renewed the attack with equal alacrity; and
it was not till they had loft all their bravest troops that
they could be prevailed with to retire. The field was
strowed with twenty thousand slain of both sides; and
the mareschal Trivulzio, who had been present at eigh∣teen
pitched battles, declared that every engagement,
which he had yet seen, was only the play of children,
but that the action of Marignan was a combat of
heroes<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Histoire de la Ligue dc Cambray.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this great victory, the conquest of the Milaneze
was easy and open. Francis, sensible how important the
alliance of the cantons was, even in their lowest fortune,
gave them all the conditions which they could have de∣manded,
had they been ever so suceessful; and he courted
their friendship by every possible condescension. The
Venetians were in alliance with France; and as they
trusted entirely to the successes of that crown for the
final recovery of their dominions on the continent, they
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
seconded Francis in every enterprize. Pope Leo, whose
sole fault was too great finesse and artifice, a fault,
which, both as a priest and an Italian, it was difficult;
for him to avoid, had hitherto temporized between the
parties; and Francis's victory at Marignan determined
him absolutely to embrace the friendship of that monarch<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 12. Paullus Jovius.</NOTE>.
But what both facilitated most, and secured the conquest
of the Milaneze, was the resolution of Maximilian
Sforza himself, who, tired of the vicissitudes of his for∣tune,
disgusted with the tyranny of the Swiss, and de∣sirous
of privacy and repose, put himself into Francis's
hands; and having stipulated a yearly pension of thirty
thousand ducats, resigned all pretensions to that dutchy,
and retired into France.</P>
<P>THE success and glory of the French monarch began<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jealousy of Henry.</NOTE>
to excite jealousy in Henry; and his rapid progress, tho'
in so distant a country, was not regarded without appre∣hensions
by the English ministry. Italy was during
that age the seat of religion, of literature, and of com∣merce;
and as it possessed alone that lustre, which has
since been shared among other nations, it fixed the atten∣tion
of all Europe, and every acquisition which was
made there, appeared more important than its weight in
the ballance of power should, strictly speaking, have
made it be esteemed. Henry also thought, that he had
reason to complain of Francis for sending the duke of Al∣bany
into Scotland, and undermining the power and
credit of his sister, the queen dowager<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, vol. iii. p. 31.</NOTE>. The repairing
the fortifications of Teroüenne was also regarded as a
breach of treaty. But above all, what tended to alienate
the court of England, was the disgust which Wolsey had
taken against the French monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="20"/>
HENRY, on the conquest of Tournay, had refused to
admit Lewis Gaillart, the bishop elect, to the possession
of the temporalities, because that prelate declined taking
the oath of allegiance to his new sovereign; and Wol∣sey
was appointed, in his room, administrator of the
bishopric. As the cardinal wished to obtain free and
undisturbed possession, he applied to Francis, and desired
him to bestow on Gaillart some see of equal value in
France, and to obtain his resignation of Tournay.
Francis, who still hoped to recover possession of that city,
and who feared that the full settlement of Wolsey in the
bishopric would prove an obstacle to his purpose, had
hitherto neglected to gratify the haughty prelate; and
the bishop of Tournay, by applying to the court of
Rome, had obtained a bull for his settlement in that see.
Wolsey, who expected to be complied with, in every
request, and who exacted respect even from the greatest
monarchs, resented the slight put upon him by Francis;
and he pushed his master to seek an occasion for wreaking
his vengeance against that monarch<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MAXIMILIAN the emperor was ready to embrace
every proposal of a new enterprize, especially if attended
with an offer of money, of which he was extremely
greedy, extremely prodigal, and extremely necessitous.
Richard Pace, formerly secretary to cardinal Bambrige,
now secretary of state, was dispatched to the court of
Vienna, and had a commission to propose some consi∣derable
payments to Maximilian<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, epist. 568.</NOTE>: He thence made a
journey into Switzerland; and by like motives engaged
some of the cantons to furnish troops to the emperor.
That prince invaded Italy with a considerable army;
but being repulsed from before Milan, he retreated with
his army into Germany, made peace with France and
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
Venice, delivered Verona to that republic for a sum of
money, and thus excluded himself, in some measure,
from all future access into Italy. And Henry found,
that, after expending five or six hundred thousand ducats,
in order to gratify the cardinal's resentment, he had only
loosened his alliance with Francis, without diminishing
the power of that prince.</P>
<P>THERE were many reasons, which engaged the King
not to proceed farther at present in his enmity against
France. He could hope for assistance from no power in
Europe. Ferdinand, his father in law, who had often,
deceived him, was now declining fast thro' age and in∣firmities;
and a speedy end was looked for to the long
and prosperous reign of that great monarch. Charles,
prince of Spain, sovereign of the Low Countries, desired
nothing but peace with Francis, who had it so much in
his power, if provoked, to obstruct his peaceable acces∣sion
to that rich inheritance, which was waiting him.
The pope was overawed by the power of France, and
Venice was engaged in a close alliance with that mo∣narchy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 12.</NOTE>.
Henry therefore remained in tranquility
during some time; and seemed to give himself no con∣cern
with regard to the affairs of the continent. In
vain did Maximilian endeavour to allure him into some
expence, by offering to make a resignation of the im∣perial
crown in his favour. That artifice was too gross
to succeed even with a prince so little politic as Henry;
and Pace, his envoy, who was perfectly well acquainted
with the emperor's motives and character, gave him
warning, that the sole view of that prince, in making
him so liberal an offer, was to draw money from him.</P>
<P>WHILE an universal peace prevailed in Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1516.</NOTE> that
event happened, which had so long been looked for, and
from which such important consequences were expected,
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
the death of Ferdinand the Catholic, and the succession
of his grandson, Charles, to his extensive dominions.
No commotion, however, or alteration followed imme∣diately
upon that great incident.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th Jan.</NOTE> This young prince,
who had not yet reached his sixteenth year, was already
a great statesman, from the excellent education which
he had received, and from the mature and solid judgment,
with which nature had endowed him. He was sensible
how important it was to preserve peace with foreigners,
till he should have established his authority in his
new dominions; and finding Francis desirous to take advan∣tage
of his present situation, he made him an offer of
such terms as gained the friendship and alliance of that
monarch. He engaged to marry Francis's daughter,
tho' only an infant of a year old; to receive as her
dowry all her father's pretensions on the kingdom of Na∣ples;
to pay him a hundred thousand crowns a year, till
the consummation of the marriage; and to give the King
of Navarre satisfaction with regard to his dominions<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Recueil de Traités par Leonard, tom. ii.</NOTE>.
Charles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1517.</NOTE> having finished this treaty at Noyon by his
ministers, and having thus left every thing in security in
the Low-Countries, departed for Spain, and was wil∣lingly
received to the government of these united king∣doms.
the right of succession lay in his mother, Joan,
who was still alive; but as she was usually disordered in
her judgment, Ferdinand had left the administration to
his grandson, Charles; and the states, both of Castile
and Arragon, gave their consent to this destination.</P>
<P>THE more Charles advanced in power and authority,
the more was Francis sensible of the necessity he lay
under of gaining the confidence and friendship of Henry;
and he took at last the only method by which he could
obtain success, the paying court, by presents and flattery,
to the haughty cardinal.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23"/>
BONNIVET, admiral of France, was dispatched to
London, and he was directed to employ all his insinuation
and address,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1518.</NOTE> qualities for which he was remarkable, to
procure himself a place in Wolsey's good graces. After
the ambassador had succeeded in his purpose, he took an
opportunity of expressing his master's regret, that, by
mistakes and misapprehensions, he had been so unfortu∣nate
as to lose a friendship, which he so much valued
as that of his eminence. Wolsey was not deaf to these
honourable advances from so great a monarch; and he
was thenceforth observed to express himself, on all occa∣sions,
in favour of the French alliance. The more to
engage him in his interests, Francis entered into such
confidence with him, that he asked his advice even in
his most secret affairs, and in all difficult emergencies
had recourse to him as to an oracle of wisdom and pro∣found
policy. The cardinal made no secret to the King
of this private correspondence; and Henry was so pre∣possessed
in favour of the great capacity of his minister,
that, he said, he verily believed he would govern Francis
as well as himself<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN matters seemed sufficiently prepared, Bonnivet
opened to the cardinal his matter's desire of recovering
Tournay; and Wolsey immediately, without hesitation,
engaged to effectuate his purpose. He took an oppor∣tunity
of representing to the King and council, that
Tournay lay so remote from Calais, that it would be
very difficult, if not impossible, in case of a war, to keep
the communication open between these two places:
That as it was situate on the frontiers both of France and
the Netherlands, it was exposed to the attacks of both
these powers, and must necessarily, either by force or
famine, fall into the hands of the first assailant: That
even in time of peace, it could not be preserved without
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
a large garrison, to restrain the numerous and mutinous
inhabitants, ever discontented with the English govern∣ment:
And that the possession of Tournay, as it was
thus precarious and expensive, so was it entirely useless,
and gave little or no means to annoy, on occasion, the
dominions either of Charles or of Francis.</P>
<P>THESE reasons were of themselves very convincing,
and were sure of meeting with no opposition, when
they came from the mouth of the cardinal. A
treaty therefore was entered into for the delivering up<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tournay delivered to France.</NOTE>
of Tournay; and in order to give to that measure a more
graceful appearance, it was agreed, that the Dauphin
and the princess Mary, both of them infants, should be
betrothed, and that this city should be considered as the
dowry of the princess. Such kinds of agreement were
then common among Sovereigns, tho' it was very rare,
that the interests and views of the parties continued so
steady as to render the intended marriages effectual.
But as Henry had been at considerable expence in build∣ing
a citadel at Tournay, Francis agreed to pay him
600,000 crowns at twelve yearly payments, and to put
into his hands eight hostages, all of them men of quality,
for the performance of the article<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellay, liv. I.</NOTE>. And lest the cardi∣nal
should think himself neglected in these stipulations,
he promised him a yearly pension of twelve thousand
livres, as an equivalent for his administration of the bi∣shopric
of Tournay. He also engaged to recall Albany
from Scotland.</P>
<P>FRANCIS having succeeded so well in this negotiation,
began to enlarge his views, and to hope for more con∣siderable
advantages, by practising on the vanity and
self conceit of this haughty favourite. He redoubled his
flatteries to the cardinal, consulted him more frequently
in every doubt or difficulty, called him in each letter,
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
<HI>father, tutor, governor,</HI> and professed the most unbounded
deference to his advice and opinion. All those caresses
were preparatives to a negotiation for the delivery of
Calais, in consideration of a sum of money to be paid for
it; and if we may credit Polydore Virgil, who bears a
particular spite to Wolsey, on account of his being dis∣possessed
of his employment and thrown into prison by
that minister, so extravagant a proposal met with a very
favourable reception from the cardinal. He ventured not,
however, to lay the matter before the council: He was
contented to sound privately the opinions of men, by
dropping hints in conversation, as if he thought Calais a
useless burthen to the kingdom<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>: But when he found,
that all men were strongly riveted in a contrary persua∣sion,
he thought it dangerous to proceed any farther in
his purpose; and falling, soon after, into new attach∣ments
with the King of Spain, the great friendship be∣tween
Francis and him began gradually to decline.</P>
<P>THE enormous pride of Wolsey was now farther en∣creased
by a great accession of dignity and power which
he had received.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wolsey ap∣pointed le∣gate.</NOTE> Cardinal Campeggio had been sent as
legate into England, in order to procure a tythe from the
clergy, for enabling the pope to oppose the progrese of
the Turks; a danger which was real, and was formida∣ble
to all Christendom, but which had been so often
made use of to serve the interested purposes of
the court of Rome, that it had lost all influence on the minds of
the people. The Clergy refused to comply with Leo's
demands: Campeggio was recalled; and the King de∣sired
of the pope, that Wolsey, who had been joined in
this commission, might alone be invested with the lega∣tine
power, together with the right of visiting all the
clergy and monasteries, and even with suspending all the
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
laws of the church during a twelve-month. Wolsey,
having obtained this new dignity, made a new display of
that state and parade, to which he was so much addicted.
On solemn feast-days, he was not contented without
saying mass after the manner of the pope himself: Not
only he had bishops and abbots to serve him; he even
engaged the first nobility to give him water and the
towel. He affected a rank superior to what had ever
been claimed by any churchman in England. Warham,
the primate, having wrote him a letter, where he sub∣scribbed
himself, <HI>your loving brother,</HI> Wolsey complained
of his presumption, in thus challenging an equality with
him. When Warham was told what offence he had
given, he made light of the matter. “Know ye not,”
he said, “that this man is drunk with too much pros∣perity.”</P>
<P>BUT Wolsey carried the matter much farther than vain
pomp and ostentation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His manner of exercis∣ing that of∣fice.</NOTE> He erected an office, which he
called the legatine court; and as he was now, by means
of the pope's commission and the King's favour, invested
with all power, both ecclesiastical and civil, no man
knew what bounds were to be set to the authority of this
new tribunal. He conferred on it a kind of inquisitorial
and censorial powers even over the laiety, and directed it
to examine into all matters of conseience; into all con∣duct
which had given scandal; into all actions, which,
though they escaped the law, might appear contrary to
good morals. Offence was justly taken at this commis∣sion,
which was really unbounded; and the people were
the more disgusted, when they saw a man, who indulged
himself in the licenses of pleasure, so severe in repressing
the least appearance of immorality in others. But to
render his court more obnoxious, Wolsey made one John
Allen the judge in it, a person of scandalous life<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memorials, vol. i. p. 125.</NOTE>, whom
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
he himself, as chancellor, had condemned for perjury:
And as this man either exacted fines from every one whom
he was pleased to find guilty, or took bribes to drop pro∣secutions,
men concluded, and with same appearance of
reason, that he shared with the cardinal these wages of
iniquity. The clergy, and in particular the monks,
were exposed to this tyranny; and as the libertinism of
their lives often gave a just handle against them, they
were obliged to buy an indemnity, by paying large sums
of money to the legate ox his judge. Not contented
with this authority, Wolsey pretended, by virtue of his
commision, to assume the power of all the bishops courts;
particularly that of judging of Wills and Testaments;
and his decisions in these important points were deemed
not a little arbitrary. As if he himself were pope, and
as if the pope could dispose absolutely of every ecclesiasti∣cal
establishment, he presented to whatever priories or
benefices he pleased, without regard to the right of elec∣tion
in the monks, or of patronage in the nobility and
gentry<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. This whole narration has been copied by all the historians from the author here cited: There are many cir∣cumstances, however, very suspicious, both because of the obvious par∣tiality of the historian, and because the parliament, when they afterwards examined Wolsey's conduct, could find no proof for any material crime he had committed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No one durst carry to the King any complaint against
these usurpations of Wolsey, till Warham ventured to
inform him of the discontents of his people. Henry pro∣fessed
his ignorance of the whole matter. “A man,”
said he, “is not so blind any where as in his own house:
But do you, father,” added he to the primate, “go
to Wolsey, and tell him, if any thing be amiss, that
he amend it.” A reproof of this kind was not likely
to be effectual; It only served to augment Wolsey's en∣mity
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
to Warham: But one London having prosecuted
Allen, the legate's judge, in a court of law, and con∣victed
him of malversation and iniquity, the clamour at
last reached the King's ears, and he expressed such dis∣pleasure
to the cardinal as made him ever after more cau∣tious
in exerting his authority<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">This year and the foregoing the sweating sickness raged anew in England. It was called <HI>Sudor Anglicus,</HI> because few, except the Eng∣lish nation, were attacked by it. Its malignity was such, that it com∣monly killed within three hours of its commencement. Some towns lost by it an half, others two thirds of their inhabitants.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1519.</NOTE> indulging himself in pleasure and
amusement, entrusted the government of his kingdom to
this imperious minister, an incident happened abroad,
which excited his attention.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th Jan.</NOTE> Maximilian the emperor
died,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the emperor Maximi∣lian.</NOTE> a man, who, of himself, was was indeed of little con∣sequence;
but as his death left vacant the first station
among christian princes, it put all men's spirits into agi∣tation,
and proved a kind of aera in the general system of
Europe. The Kings of France and Spain immediately
declared themselves candidates for the imperial throne;
and employed every expedient of money or intrigue,
which promised them success in so great a point of ambi∣tion.
Henry also was encouraged to put in his preten∣sions;
but his minister, Pace, who was dispatched to the
electors, found that he began to solicit too late, and that
the votes of all these princes were already pre-engaged
either on the one fide or the other.</P>
<P>FRANCIS and Charles made profession from the be∣ginning
of carrying on this rivalship with emulation, but
without enmity; and Francis in particular declared, that
his brother Charles and he were, fairly and openly,
suitors to the same mistress: The more fortunate, added
he, will carry her; and the other must rest contented<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Belcario, lib. 16. Guicciardin, lib. 13.</NOTE>.
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
But all men apprehended, that this extreme moderation,
however reasonable, would not be of long duration; and
that incidents would certainly occur to sharpen the minds
of the candidates against each other. It was Charles
who at last prevailed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charles, King of Spain, chosen em∣peror.</NOTE> to the great disappointment of the
French monarch, who still continued to the last in the
belief, that the majority of the electoral college was en∣gaged
in his favour. And as he was some years superior
in age to his rival, and, after his victory at Marignan,
and conquest of the Milanese, much superior in renown,
he could not suppress his indignation, at being thus, in
the face of all mankind, after long and anxious expecta∣tion,
post-poned in so important a pretension. From
this competition, as much as from opposition of interest,
arose that emulation between those two great monarchs,
which, while it kept their whole age in agitation, sets
them in so remarkable a contrast to each other: Both of
them princes endowed with talents and abilities; brave,
aspiring, active, industrious; beloved by their servants
and subjects, dreaded by their enemies, and respected by
all the world: Francis, open, frank, liberal, munificent,
carrying these virtues to an excess which prejudiced his
affairs: Charles, political, close, artificial, frugal; bet∣ter
calculated to obtain success in wars and in negotia∣tions,
especially the latter. The one, the more amiable
man; the other, the greater monarch. The King, from
his oversights and indiscretions, naturally exposed to mis∣fortunes;
but qualified, by his spirit and magnanimity,
to extricate himself from them with honour: The empe∣ror,
by his designing, interested character, fitted, in his
greatest successes, to excite jealousy and opposition even
among his allies, and to rouze up a multitude of ene∣mies,
in the place of one whom he had subdued. And
as the personal qualities of these princes thus counter∣poised
each other, so did the advantages and disadvantages
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
of their dominions. Fortune alone, without the con∣currence
of prudence or valour, never reared up of a
sudden so great a power as that which centered in the
emperor Charles. He reaped the succession of Castile,
of Arragon, of Austria, of Burgundy: He inherited the
conquest of Naples, of Granada: Election entitled him
to the empire: Even the bounds of the globe seemed to
be enlarged a little before his time, that he might possess the
whole treasure, as yet entire and unrifled, of the new
world. But tho' the concurrence of all these advantages
formed an empire greater and more extensive than any
known in Europe since that of the Romans, the king∣dom
of France alone, being close, compact, united,
rich, populous, and being interposed between all the
provinces of Charles's dominions, was able to make a
vigorous opposition to his progress, and maintain the
contest against him.</P>
<P>HENRY possessed that felicity, of being able, both by
the native force of his kingdom and its situation, to hold
the balance between those two powers; and had he
known to improve, by policy and prudence, this singular
and inestimable advantage, he was really, by means of
it, a greater prince than either of those mighty mo∣narchs,
who seemed to strive for the dominion of Eu∣rope.
But the character of this King was heedless, in∣considerate,
capricious, impolitic; guided by his passion
or his favourite; vain, imperious, haughty; sometimes
actuated by friendship for foreign powers, oftener by re∣sentment,
seldom by his true interest. And thus, tho'
he triumphed in that superiority which his situation in
Europe gave him, he never employed it to his own essen∣tial
and durable advantage, or to that of his kingdom.</P>
<P>FRANCIS was well acquainted with Henry's character,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1520.</NOTE>
and endeavoured to accommodate his conduct to it. He
solicited an interview near Calais;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Interview between Henry</NOTE> in expectation of being
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
able, by familiar conversation, to gain upon his friend∣ship
and confidence. Wolsey earnestly seconded this
proposal; and hoped, in the presence of both courts, to
make parade of his riches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Francis at Calais.</NOTE> his splendour, and his in∣fluence
over both monarchs<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. And as Henry himself
loved pomp and magnificence, and had entertained a
curiosity of being personally acquainted with the French
King, he very chearfully adjusted all the preliminaries of
this interview. The nobility of both nations strove to
surpass each other in pomp and expence; Many of them
involved themselves in large debts, and were not able, by
the penury of their whole lives, to repair the vain splen∣dour
of a few days. The duke of Buckingham, who,
tho' immensely rich, was somewhat addicted to frugality,
finding the preparations for this festival amount to im∣mense
sums, threw out some expressions of displeasure
against the cardinal, whom he believed the author of
that measure<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. Herbert. Hollingshed, p. 855.</NOTE>. An imprudence which proved afterwards
the source of great misfortunes to that nobleman.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry was preparing to depart for Calais,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The emper∣or Charles arrives in England. 25th of May.</NOTE>
he was surprized to hear that the emperor was
arrived at Dover; and he immediately hastened thi∣ther
with the queen, in order to give a suitable re∣ception
to his royal guest. That great prince, po∣litic
tho' young, having heard of the intended inter∣view
between Francis and Henry, was apprehensive
of the consequences, and was resolved to take the oppor∣tunity,
in his passage from Spain to the Low Countries,
to make the King still a higher compliment, by paying
him a visit in his own dominions. Besides the marks of
regard and attachment which he gave to Henry, he
strove, by every testimony of friendship, by flatteries,
protestations, promises and presents, to gain on the va∣nity,
the avarice, and the ambition of the cardinal. He
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
here instilled into this aspiring prelate the hope of attain∣ing
the papacy; and as that was the sole point of eleva∣tion,
beyond his present greatness, it was sure to attract
his wishes with the same ardour, as if fortune had never,
as yet, favoured him with any of her presents. In hopes
of reaching this dignity by the emperor's assistance, he
secretly devoted himself to that monarch's interests;
and Charles was perhaps the more liberal of his promises,
because Leo was a very young man; and it was not
likely, that, for many years, he would be called upon to
fulfil his engagements. Henry easily observed this court∣ship
payed to his minister; but instead of taking umbrage
at it, he only made it a subjects of vanity; and believed,
that, as Wolsey's sole support was his favour, the obei∣sance
of such mighty monarchs to his servant, was in
reality a more conspicuous homage to his own grandeur.</P>
<P>THE day of Charles's departure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of May.</NOTE> Henry went over to
Calais with the queen and his whole court; and from
thence proceeded to Guisnes, a small town near the
frontiers. Francis, attended in like manner, came to
Ardres, a few miles distant; and the two monarchs met,
for the first time, in the fields, at a place situate between
these two towns, but still within the English pale: For
Francis agreed to pay that compliment to Henry, in
consideration of that prince's passing the sea, that he
might be present at the interview. Wolsey, to whom
both Kings had entrusted the regulation of the ceremo∣nial,
contrived this circumstance, in order to do honou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to his master.</P>
<P>THE two monarchs, after saluting each other in the
most cordial manner, retired into a tent which had been
erected on purpose, and they held a secret conference
together. Henry here proposed to make some amend∣ments
on the articles of their former alliance; and
he began to read the treaty, <HI>I Henry King:</HI> These were
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
the first words; and he stopt a moment. He subjoined only
the words, <HI>of England,</HI> without adding, <HI>France,</HI> the usual
style of the English monarchs<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. Francis remarked this
delicacy, and expressed by a smile his approbation of
it.</P>
<P>HE took an opportunity soon after of paying a com∣pliment
to Henry of a more essential nature. That
generous prince, full of honour himself, and incapable
of distrusting others, was shocked at all the precautions
which were observed, whenever he had an interview
with the English monarch: The number of their guards
and attendants was carefully counted on both sides:
Every step was scrupulously measured and adjusted: And
if the two Kings proposed to pay a visit to the queens,
they departed from their several quarters at the same
instant, which was marked by the firing of a culverin;
they passed each other in the middle point between the
places; and at the same instant that Henry entered Ar∣dres,
Francis put himself into the hands of the English
at Guisnes. In order to break off this tedious ceromony,
which contained so many dishonourable implications,
Francis, one day, took with him two gentlemen and a
page, and rode directly into Guisnes. The guards were
surprized at the presence of the monarch, who called
aloud to them, <HI>You are all my prisoners: Carry me to your
master.</HI> Henry was equally astonished at the appearance
of Francis; and taking him in his arms, “My brother,”
said he, “you have here played me the most agreeable
trick in the world, and have showed me the full
confidence I may place in you: I surrender myself
your prisoner from this moment.” He took from his
neck a collar of pearls, worth 15000 angels<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">An angel was then estimated at seven shillings, or near twelve of our present money.</NOTE>; and put∣ting
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
it about Francis's, begged him to wear it, for the
sake of his prisoner. Francis agreed, but on condition
that Henry should wear a bracelet, of which he made
him a present, and which was double in value to the
collar<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. The King went next day to Ardres, without
guards or attendants; and confidence being now fully
established between the monarchs, they employed the rest
of the time entirely in tournaments and festivals.</P>
<P>A DEFIANCE had been sent by the two Kings to each
others court, and thro' all the chief cities of Europe, im∣porting,
that Henry and Francis, with fourteen aids,
would be ready in the plains of Picardy, to answer all
comers, that were gentlemen, at tilt, tourney, and bar∣riers.
The monarchs, in order to fulfil this challenge,
advanced into the field on horseback, Francis surrounded
with Henry's guards, and Henry with those of Francis.
They were gorgiously apparelled; and were both of
them the most comely personages of their age, as well
as the most expert in every military exercise. They
carried away the prize at all trials in those rough and
dangerous pastimes; and several horses and riders were
overthrown by their vigour and dexterity. The ladies
were the judges in these feats of chivalry, and put an end
to the rencounter whenever they judged it expedient.
Henry erected a spacious house of wood and canvas,
which had been framed in London; and he here feasted
the French monarch. He had placed a motto on this
fabric, under the figure of an English archer embroidered
on it, <HI>Cui adhaereo praeest; He prevails whom I favour</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Mezeray.</NOTE>:
Expressing his own situation, as holding in his hands the
balance of power among the potentates of Europe.
In these entertainments, more than in any serious busi∣ness,
did the two Kings pass their time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th June.</NOTE> till their
departure.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="35"/>
HENRY, after his return to Calais, paid a visit to
the emperor and Margaret of Savoy at Gravelines, and
engaged them to go along with him to Calais, and pass
some days in that fortress. The artful and politic Charles
here compleated the impression, which he had begun to
make on Henry and his favourite, and effaced all the
friendship, to which the frank and liberal nature of
Francis had given birth. As the house of Austria began
sensibly to take the ascendant over the French monarchy,
the interests of England required that some support should
be given to the latter, and above all, that any important
wars should be prevented, which might bestow on either
of them a decisive superiority over the other. But the
jealousy of the English against France has ever prevented
a cordial union between these nations: And Charles,
sensible of this hereditary animosity, and desirous farther
to flatter Henry's vanity, had made him an offer, (an
offer in which Francis was afterwards obliged to concur)
that he should be entire arbiter in any dispute or difference
that should arise between the monarchs. But the
great masterpiece of Charles's politics was the securing
Wolsey in his interests, by very important services, and
still higher promises. He renewed assurances of assisting
him in obtaining the papacy; and he put him in present
possession of the revenues, belonging to the sees of Bada∣jox
and Palencia in Castile. The acquisitions of Wolsey were
now become so exorbitant, that, joined to the
pensions from foreign powers, which Henry allowed him
to possess, his revenues were computed nearly to equal
those which belonged to the crown itself; and he spent
them with a magnificence, or rather an ostentation,
which gave general offence to the people; and much
lessened his master in the eyes of all foreign nations<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil. Hall.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="36"/>
THE violent personal emulation and political jealousy
which had taken place between the emperor and the
French King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1521.</NOTE> soon broke out in action. Francis sent
an army into Navarre under the command of De Foix,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War between Charles and Francis.</NOTE>
in order to replace the family of Albert in the possession
of that kingdom; and this enterprize could not have
been complained of as a breach of treaty, if De Foix
had confined himself to that equitable design. But after
he had subdued Navarre, finding Spain in great disorder
from the insurrections of the people, he thought the
opportunity favourable, and he ventured, with Francis's
approbation, to lay siege to Logrogno in Castile. This
invasion, contrary to what was expected, put an end to
the domestic dissentions of the Castilians; who attacked
the French, obliged them to raise the siege, pursued the
advantage, and entirely expelled them Navarre, which
has ever since remained united with the Spanish mo∣narchy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Vera, hist. de Charl. V.</NOTE>. Robert de la Marck, duke of Boüillon and
prince of Sedan, having received some disgust from the
governess of the Low Countries, had taken arms and
invaded those provinces; and had even sent a challenge
or defiance to the emperor himself<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Bellay, lib. 1.</NOTE>: A boldness, which
seemed entirely unaccountable, except on the supposition
that this petty prince had received secret encouragement
from Francis. On the other hand, Charles, in order to
chastise the insolence of Robert, had levied a powerful
army, and advanced to the frontiers of France, which
he threatened with an invasion. Hostilities were soon
carried farther; his generals besieged Mouson, which
they took; they invested Mezieres, where they met
with a repulse. In Italy likewise the two monarchs
were not inactive. Francis negotiated with the Pope, in
order to engage him to concur in expelling the Imperi∣alists
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
from Naples: But Charles had the address to finish
his league with the same power for expelling the French
from Milan; and the united arms of the allies had
invaded that dutchy, and had almost entirely finished
their enterprize.</P>
<P>WHILE these ambitious and warlike princes were
committing hostilities on each other in every part of
Europe, they still made professions of the strongest desire
of peace; and both of them carried incessantly their
complaints to Henry, as to the umpire between them.
The King, who appeared neutral,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mediation of Henry.</NOTE> engaged them to send
their ambassadors to Calais, there to negotiate a peace
under the mediation of Wolsey and the pope's nuntio.
The emperor was well acquainted with the partiality of
these mediators; and his demands in the conference
were so unreasonable, as plainly proved him conscious of
this advantage. He required the restitution of Burgundy,
a province, which many years before had been ceded to
France by treaty, and which would have given him
access into the midst of that kingdom: And he demanded
to be freed from the homage, which his ancestors had
ever paid for Flanders and Artois, and which he himself
had, by the treaty of Noyon, promised to renew. On
Francis's rejecting these terms, the congress at Calais
broke up, and Wolsey, soon after, took a journey to
Bruges, where he met with the emperor. He was re∣ceived
of with the same state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of November.</NOTE> magnificence, and respect, as
if he had been the King of England himself; and he
concluded in his master's name an offensive alliance with
the pope and the emperor against France. He engaged
that England should next summer invade that kingdom
with forty thousand men; and he betrothed to Charles
the princess Mary, the King's only child, who had now
some prospect of inheriting the crown. This extravagant
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
alliance, which was prejudicial to the interests, and
might have proved fatal to the liberty and indepen∣dence
of the kingdom, was the result of the humours
and prejudices of the King, and the private views and
expectations of the cardinal.</P>
<P>THE people saw every day new instances of the un∣controuled
authority of this minister. The duke of
Buckingham, constable of England, the first nobleman
both for family and fortune in the kingdom, had been so
unfortunate as to give disgust to the cardinal, and it was
not long before he found reason to repent his indiscretion.
He seems to have been a man full of levity and rash pro∣jects;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and condemna∣tion of the duke of Bucking∣ham.</NOTE>
and being infatuated with judicial astrology, he
entertained commerce with one Hopkins, a carthusian
monk, who encouraged him in the notion of his mount∣ing
one day the throne of England. He was descended
by a female from the duke of Glocester, youngest son of
Edward the third; and tho' his claim to the crown was
thereby very remote, he had been so imprudent as to let
fall some expressions, as if he thought himself best in∣titled,
in case the King should die without issue, to pos∣sess
the royal dignity. He had not even abstained from
threats against the King's life, and had provided himself
of arms, which he intended to employ, in case a favour∣able
opportunity should offer. He was brought to a
trial; and the duke of Norfolk, whose son, the earl of
Surrey, had married Buckingham's daughter, was created
lord steward, in order to precide at this solemn proce∣dure.
The jury consisted of a duke, a marquis, seven
earls, and twelve barons; and they gave their verdict
against Buckingham, which was soon after put in exe∣cution.
There is no reason to think the sentence unjust<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Herber: Hall. Stowe, 513. Hollingshed, p. 862.</NOTE>;
but as Buckingham's crime seemed to proceed more
from indiscretion than deliberate malice, the people, who
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
loved that nobleman, expected that the King would grant
him a pardon, and ascribed their disappointment to the
malice and revenge of the cardinal. The King's own
jealousy, however, against all pretenders to the crown,
was, notwithstanding his undoubted title, very remark∣able
during the whole course of his reign; and was
alone sufficient to render him implacable against Buck∣ingham.
The office of constable, which Buckingham
inherited from the Bohuns, earls of Hereford, was
forfeited, and was never after revived by Henry.</P>

<P>DURING some years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXIX.</NOTE> many parts of Europe had
been agitated with those religious controversies,
which produced the reformation, one of the greatest:
events in history: But as it was not till this time, that
the King of England publickly took part in the quarrel,
we had no occasion to give any account of its rise and
progress. It will now be necessary to explain these theo∣logical
disputes; or what is more material, to trace from
their origin those abuses, which so generally diffused the
opinion, that a reformation of the church or ecclesiastical
order was become highly expedient, if not absolutely
necessary. We shall be better enabled to comprehend
the subject, if we take the matter a little higher, and
reflect a moment on the reasons, why there must be an
ecclesiastical order, and a public establishment of reli∣gion
in every civilized community. The importance of
the present occasion will, I hope, excuse this short
digression.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="41"/>
MOST of the arts and professions in a state are of such
a nature, that, while they promote the interests of the
society, they are also useful or agreeable to some indivi∣duals;
and in that case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Digression concerning the ecclesi∣astical state.</NOTE>. the constant rule of the magi∣strate,
except, perhaps, on the first introduction of any
art, is, to leave the profession to itself, and trust its en∣couragement
to the individuals who reap the benefit of
it. The artizans, finding their profits to rise by the
favour of their customers, encrease, as much as possible,
their skill and industry; and as matters are not disturbed
by any injudicious tampering, the commodity is al∣ways
sure to be at all times exactly proportioned to the
demand.</P>
<P>BUT there are also some callings, which, tho' useful
and even necessary in a state, bring no advantage nor
pleasure to any individuals; and the supreme power is
obliged to alter its conduct with regard to the retainers of those
professions. It must give them public encourage∣ment
in order to their subsistance; and it must provide
against that negligence, to which they will naturally be
subject, either by annexing particular honours to the
profession, by establishing a long subordination of ranks
and a strict dependance, or by some other expedient.
The persons employed in the finances, armies, fleets,
and magistracy are instances of this order of men.</P>
<P>IT may naturally be thought, at first view, that
the ecclesiastics belong to the first class, and that their
encouragement, as well as that of lawyers and physicians,
may safely be trusted to the liberality of individuals, who
are attached to their doctrines, and who find benefit or
consolation from their spiritual ministry and assistance.
Their industry and vigilance will, no doubt, be whetted
by such an additional motive; and their skill in the pro∣fession,
as well as their address in governing the minds
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
of the people, must receive daily encrease, from their
encreasing practice, study, and attention.</P>
<P>BUT if we consider the matter more closely, we shall
find, that this interested diligence of the clergy is what
every wise legislator will study to prevent; because in
every religion, except the true, it is highly pernicious,
and has even a natural tendency to pervert the true, by
infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly,
and delusion. Each ghostly practitioner, in order to
render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of
his retainers, must inspire them with the most violent
abhorrence against all other sects, and continually endea∣vour,
by some novelty, to excite the languid devotion of
his audience. No regard will be paid to truth, morals,
or decency in the doctrines inculcated. Every tenet
will be adopted, that best suits the disorderly affections
of the human frame. Customers will be drawn to each
conventicle by new industry and address in practising
on the passions and credulity of the populace. And in
the end, the civil magistrate will find, that he has paid
dearly for his pretended frugality, in saving a settled
foundation for the priests; and that in reality the most
decent and advantageous composition, which he can make
with the spiritual guides, is to bribe their indolence, by
affixing stated salaries to their profession, and rendering
it superfluous for them to be farther active, than merely
to preserve their flock from straying in quest of new
pastures. And in this manner ecclesiastical establishments,
tho' commonly they arose at first from religious views,
prove in the end advantageous to the political interests
of society.</P>
<P>BUT we may observe, that few ecclesiastical establish∣ments
have been fixed upon a worse foundation than that
of the church of Rome, or have been attended with
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
circumstances more hurtful to the peace and happiness
mankind.</P>
<P>THE large revenues, privileges, immunities, and pow∣ers
of the clergy rendered them formidable to the civil
magistrate, and armed with too extensive authority an
order of men, who always adhere closely together, and
who never want a plausible pretence for their encroach∣ments
and usurpations. The higher dignities of the
church served, indeed, to the support of gentry and no∣bility;
but by the establishment of monasteries, many of
the lowest vulgar were taken from the useful arts, and
maintained in those receptacles of sloth and ignorance.
The supreme head of the church was a foreign potentate,
who was guided by interests, always different, sometimes
contrary to those of the community. And as the hie∣rarchy
was necessarily solicitous to preserve an unity of
faith, rites and ceremonies, all liberty of thought ran a
manifest risque of being extinguished; and violent per∣secutions,
or what was worse, a stupid and abject credu∣lity,
took place every where.</P>
<P>TO encrease these evils, the church, tho' she possessed
large revenues, was not contented with her acquisitions,
but retained a power of practising farther on the ignor∣ance
of mankind. She even bestowed on each individual
priest a power of enriching himself by the voluntary
oblations of the faithful, and left him still a powerful
motive for diligence and industry in his calling. And
thus, that church, tho' an expensive and burthensome
establishment, was liable to many of the inconveniences,
which belong to an order of priests, trusted entirely to
their own art and invention for attaining a subsistence.</P>
<P>THE advantages, attending the Romish hierarchy,
were but a small compensation for its inconveniences.
The ecclesiastical privileges, during barbarous times, had
served as a cheque to the despotism of Kings. The
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
union of all the western churches under the supreme
pontiff facilitated the intercourse of nations, and tended
to bind all the parts of Europe into a close connection
with each other. And the pomp and splendour of wor∣ship,
which belonged to so opulent an establishment,
contributed, in some respects, to the encouragement of
the fine arts, and began to diffuse a general elegance of
taste, by uniting it with religion.</P>
<P>IT will easily be conceived, that, tho' the ballance
of evil prevailed in the Romish church, this was not the
chief reason, which produced the reformation. A con∣currence
of incidents must have contributed to forward
that great work.</P>
<P>POPE Leo the tenth, by his generous and enterprizing
temper, had very much exhausted his treasury, and was
obliged to make use of every invention, which might
yield money, in order to support his protects, pleasures,
and liberalities. The scheme of selling indulgences was
suggested to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the reform∣ation.</NOTE> as an expedient which had often served
in former times to draw money from the christian world,
and make devout people willing contributors to the
grandeur and riches of the court of Rome. The church,
it was supposed, was possessed of a great stock of merit, as
being intitled to all the good works of the saints, be∣yond
what were employed in their own justification;
and even to the merits of Christ himself, which were
infinite and unbounded: And from this unexhausted
treasury, the pope might retail particular portions, and
by that traffic acquire money, to be employed in pious
purposes, the resisting the Turk, or subduing schis∣matics.
When the money came into his treasury,
the greatest part of it was usually diverted to other
purposes<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r Paul and Sleidan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="45"/>
IT is commonly believed, that Leo, from the pene∣tration
of his genius, and his familiarity with literature,
was fully acquainted with the ridicule and fallacy of the
doctrines, which, as supreme pontiff, he was obliged by
his interest to promote: And it is the less wonder,
therefore, that he employed for his profit those pious
frauds, which his predecessors, the most ignorant and
credulous, had always, under plausible pretences, made
use of for their selfish purposes. He published the sale of
a general indulgence<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In 1517.</NOTE>; and as his expences had not
only exhausted his usual revenue, but even anticipated
the income of this extraordinary expedient, the several
branches of it were openly given away to particular per∣sons,
who were entitled to levy the imposition. The
produce particularly of Saxony and the countries border∣ing
on the Baltic was assigned to his sister, Magdalene,
married to Cibo, natural son of Innocent the eighth; and
she, in order to enhance her profit, had farmed out the
revenue to one Arcemboldi, a Genoese, now a bishop,
formerly a merchant, who still retained all the lucrative
arts of his former profession<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, Sleidan.</NOTE>. The Austin friars had
usually been employed in Saxony to preach the indul∣gences,
and from this trust had derived both profit and
consideration: But Arcemboldi, fearing, lest practice
might have taught them means to secrete the money<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. I.</NOTE>,
and expecting no extraordinary success from the ordinary
methods of collection, gave this occupation to the Domi∣nicans.
These monks, in order to prove themselves
worthy of the distinction, conferred on them, exaggerated
the benefit of indulgences by the most unbounded pane∣gyrics;
and advanced doctrines on that head, which,
tho' not more ridiculous than those already received,
were such as the ears of the people were not yet fully
accust <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to. To add to the scandal, the collectors
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
of this revenue are said to have lived very licentious
lives, and to have spent in taverns, gaming houses, and
places still more infamous, the money, which devout
persons had saved from their usual expences, in order to
purchase a remission of their sins<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL these circumstances might have given offence,
but would have been attended with no event of any im∣portance,
had there not arisen a man, qualified to take
advantage of the incident. Martin Luther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin Luther.</NOTE> an Austin
friar, professor in the university of Wirtemberg, resenting
the affront put upon his order, began to preach against
these abuses in the sale of indulgences; and being natu∣rally
of a fiery temper, and being provoked by opposition,
he proceeded even to decry indulgences themselves; and
was thence carried, by the heat of dispute, to question
the authority of the pope, from which his adversaries
derived their chief arguments against him<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, Sleidan.</NOTE>. Still as he
enlarged his reading, in order to support these tenets, he
discovered some new abuse or error in the church of
Rome; and finding his opinions greedily hearkened to,
he promulgated them by writing, discourses, sermons,
conferences; and daily encreased the number of his
disciples. All Saxony, all Germany, all Europe were
in a very little time filled with the voice of this daring
innovator; and men, roused from that lethargy, in which
they had so long slept, began to call in question the
most antient and most received opinions. The elector of
Saxony, favourable to Luther's doctrine, protected him
from the violence of the papal jurisdiction: The republic
of Zuric even reformed their church according to the
new model: Many sovereigns of the empire, and the
imperial diet itself, showed a favourable disposition to∣wards
it: And Luther, a man naturally inflexible, vehe∣ment,
opinionative, was become incapable, either from
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
promises of advancement, or terrors of severity, to re∣linquish
a sect, of which he was himself the founder, and
which brought him a glory, superior to all others, the
glory of dictating the religious faith and principles of
multitudes.</P>
<P>THE rumour of these innovations soon reached Eng∣land;
and as there still subsisted in that kingdom great
remains of the Lollards, whose principles resembled those
of Luther, the new doctrines gained secretly many par∣tizans
among the laity of all ranks and denominations.
Henry had been educated in a strict attachment to the
church of Rome, and he bore a particular prejudice
against Luther, who, in his writings, spoke with con∣tempt
of Thomas Aquinas, the King's favourite author:
He opposed himself therefore to the progress of the Lu∣theran
tenets, by all the influence which his extensive
and almost absolute authority conferred upon him: He
even undertook to combat them with weapons not usu∣ally
employed by monarchs, especially those in the
flower of their age, and force of their passions. He
wrote a book in Latin against the principles of Luther;
a performance, which, if allowance be made for the
subject and the age, does no discredit to his capacity.
He sent a copy of it to Leo, who received so magnificent
a present with great testimony of regard; and conferred
on him, the title of <HI>defender of the faith;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry re∣ceives the title of de∣sender of the faith.</NOTE> an appellation
still retained by the Kings of England. Luther, who
was in the heat of controversy, soon wrote an answer
to Henry; and without regard to the dignity of his
antagonist, treated him with all the acrimony of style,
to which, in the course of his polemics, he had so long
been accustomed. The King, by this ill usage, was
still more prejudiced against the new doctrines; but
the public, who naturally favour the weaker party, were
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
inclined to attribute to Luther the victory in the dis∣pute<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>. And as the controversy became more illustrious, by
Henry's entering the lists, it drew still more the atten∣tion
of mankind; and the Lutheran doctrine acquired
daily new converts in every part of Europe.</P>
<P>THE quick and surprizing progress of this bold sect may
justly in part be ascribed to the late invention of printing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of the progress of the re∣formation.</NOTE>.
and revival of learning: Not that reason bore any consi∣derable
part, in opening men's eyes with regard to the
impostures of the Romish church: For of all branches
of literature, philosophy had, as yet, and till long after∣wards,
made the most inconsiderable progress; neither is
there any instance where argument has been able to free
the people from that enormous load of absurdity, with
which superstition has every where overwhelmed them:
Not to mention, that the rapid advance of the Lutheran
doctrine, and the violence, with which it was embraced,
prove sufficiently, that it owed not its success to reason
and reflection. The art of printing and the revival of
learning forwarded its progress in another manner. By
means of that art, the books of Luther and his sectaries,
full of vehemence, declamation and a rude eloquence,
were propagated more quickly, and in greater numbers.
The minds of men, somewhat awakened from a pro∣found
sleep of so many centuries, were prepared for
every novelty, and serupled less to tread in any unusual
path, which was opened to them. And as copies of the
Scriptures and other antient monuments of the christian
faith became more common, men perceived the innova∣tions,
which were introduced after the first centuries;
and though argument and reasoning could not give con∣viction,
an historical fact, well supported, was able to
make impression on their understandings. Many of the
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
powers, indeed, assumed by the church of Rome, were
very antient, and were prior to almost every political
government established in Europe: But as the ecclesias∣tics
would not agree to possess their privileges as matters
of civil right, which time could render valid, but ap∣pealed
still to a divine origin, men were tempted to look
into their primitive charter; and they could, without
much difficulty, perceive its defect in truth and au∣thenticity.</P>
<P>IN order to bestow on this topic the greater influence,
Luther and his followers, not satisfied with opposing the
pretended divinity of the Romish church, and displaying
the temporal inconveniencies of that establishment, car∣ried
matters-much farther, and treated the religion of
their ancestors, as abominable, detestable, damnable;
foretold by sacred writ itself as the source of all wicked∣ness
and pollution. They denominated the pope anti∣christ,
called his communion the scarlet whore, and
gave to Rome the appellation of Babylon; expressions,
which, however applied, were to be found in Scripture,
and which were better calculated to operate on the
multitude than the most solid arguments. Excited by
contest and persecution on the one hand, by success and
applause on the other, many of the reformers carried to
the greatest extremity their opposition against the church
of Rome; and in contradiction to the multiplied super∣stitions,
with which that communion was loaded, they
adopted an enthusiastic strain of devotion, which admitted
of no observances, rites or ceremonies, but placed all
merit in a mysterious species of faith, in inward vision,
rapture, and extacy. The new sectaries, seized with
this spirit, were indefatigable in the propagation of their
doctrine, and set at defiance all the anathemas and pu∣nishments,
with which the Roman pontiff endeavoured
to overwhelm them.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="50"/>
THAT the civil power, however, might afford them
protection against the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the Lu∣therans
advanced doctrines favourable, in some respects,
to the temporal authority of sovereigns. They inveighed
against the abuses of the court of Rome, with which men
were at that time generally discontented; and exhorted
princes to reinstate themselves in those powers, of which
the encroaching spirit of the ecclesiastics, and especially
of the sovereign pontiff, had so long bereaved them.
They condemned celibacy and monastic vows, and
thereby opened the doors of the convents to those who
were either tired of the obedience and chastity, or dis∣gusted
with the licence, in which they had hitherto lived.
They blamed the excessive riches, the idleness, the liber∣tinism
of the clergy; and pointed out their treasures
and revenues as lawful spoil to the first invader. And as
the ecclesiastics had hitherto conducted a willing and a
stupid audience, and were totally unacquainted with
controversy, much more with every species of true
literature; they were unable to defend themselves against
men, armed with authorities, citations, and popular
topics, and qualified to triumph in every altercation or
debate. Such were the advantages, with which the re∣formers
began their attack of the Roman hierarchy;
and such were the causes of their rapid and astonishing
success.</P>
<P>LEO the tenth, whose oversights and too supine trust
in the profound ignorance of the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">31st Decem∣ber.</NOTE> had given rise
to this sect, but whose sound judgment, moderation and
temper, were well qualified to retard its progress, died in
the flower of his age, a little after he received the King's
book against Luther; and he was succeeded in the papal
chair, by Adrian, a Fleming, who had been tutor to the
emperor Charles. This man was sitted to gain on the
reformers by the integrity, candour, and simplicity of
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
manners, by which he was distinguished; but, so violent
were their prejudices against the church, he rather hurt
the cause by his imprudent exercise of those virtues. He
frankly confessed, that many abominable and detestable
practices prevailed in the court of Rome; and by this
sincere avowal, he gave occasion of much triumph to
the Lutherans. This pontiff also, whose penetration
was not equal to his good intentions, was seduced to
concur in that league, which Charles and Henry had
formed against France<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 14.</NOTE>; and he thereby augmented the
scandal, occasioned by the practice of so many preceding
popes, who still made their spiritual arms subservient to
political purposes.</P>
<P>THE emperor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1522.</NOTE> Charles, who knew, that Wolsey had
received a disappointment in his ambitious hopes by the
election of Adrian, and who dreaded the resentment of
that haughty minister, was solicitous to repair the breach
made in their friendship by this incident. He paid a
new visit to England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th May.</NOTE> and besides flattering the vanity
of the King and the cardinal, he repeated to Wolsey all
the promises, which he had made him, of seconding his
pretensions to the papal throne. Wolsey, sensible that
Adrian's great age and infirmities promised a sudden
vacancy, dissembled his resentment, and was willing to
hope for a more prosperous issue of the next election.
The emperor renewed the treaty made at Bruges, to
which some articles were added; and he agreed to in∣demnisy
both the King and Wolsey for the revenues
which they should lose by a breach with France. The
more to ingratiate himself with Henry and the English
nation, he gave to Surrey, admiral of England, a com∣mission
for being admiral of his dominions; and he
himself was installed knight of the garter at London.
After a stay of six weeks in England, he embarked at
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
Southampton, and in ten days arrived in Spain, where
he soon pacified the tumults which had arisen in his
absence<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, epist. 765.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King declared war against France; and this
measure was founded on so little reason, that he could
allege nothing as a ground of quarrel, but Francis's re∣fusal
to submit to his arbitration, and his sending Albany
into Scotland. This last step had not been taken by the
French King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> till he was quite assured of Henry's reso∣lution
to attack him. Surrey landed some troops at
Cherbourg in Normandy; and after laying waste the country,
he sailed to Morlaix, a rich town in Britanny,
which he took and plundered. The English merchants
had great property in that place, which was no more
spared by the sold<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the goods of the French.
Surrey then left <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the fleet to the vice-admiral;
and sailed to Calais, where he took the com∣mand
of the English army, destined for the invasion of
France. This army, when joined by forces from the
Low Countries under the command of the count de
Buren, consisted in the whole of 18,000 men.</P>
<P>THE French had made it a maxim in all their wars
with the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> since the reign of Charles the fifth,
never, without great necessity, to hazard a general engage∣ment;
and the duke of Vendome, who commanded
the French army, now embraced this wise policy.
He supplied the towns most exposed, especially Boulogne,
Montreuil, Teroüenne, Hedin, with strong garrisons
and plenty of provisions: He himself took post at Abbe∣ville,
with some Swiss and French infantry, and a body
of cavalry: The count of Guise encamped under Mont∣reuil
with six thousand men. These two bodies were in
a situation to join upon occasion; to throw succour
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
into any town, that was threatened; and to harrass the
English in every movement. Surrey, who was not sup∣plied
with magazines, first divided his army for the con∣venience
of subsisting them; but finding that his quarters
were every moment beaten up by the activity of the
French generals, he drew together the forces, and laid
siege to Hedin. But neither did he succeed in this enter∣prize.
The garrison made vigorous sallies upon his army:
The French forces assaulted them from without: Great
rains fell: Fatigue and bad weather threw his soldiers
into dysenteries: And Surrey was obliged to raise the
siege, and put his troops into winter quarters about the
end of October. His rear guard was attacked at Pas in
Artois; and five or six hundred men were cut off; nor
could all his efforts make him master of one place within
the French frontier.</P>
<P>THE allies were more successful in Italy. Lautrec,
who commanded the French, lost a bloody battle at Bi∣cocca
near Milan; and was obliged to retire with the
remains of his army. This misfortune, which proceeded
from Francis's negligence in not supplying Lautrec with
money<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 14.</NOTE>. was followed by the loss of Genoa. The
castle of Cremona was the sole fortress in Italy, which
remained in the hands of the French.</P>
<P>EUROPE was now in such a situation, and so con∣nected
by alliances and interest, that it was almost im∣possible
for war to be kindled in one part, and not diffuse
itself thro' the whole: But of all the leagues among
kingdoms, the closest was that which had so long sub∣sisted
between France and Scotland; and the English,
while at war with the former nation, could not expect
to remain long unmolested on the northern frontier. No
sooner had Albany arrived in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> than he took
measures for kindling a war with England; and he sum∣moned
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
the whole force of the kingdom to meet in the
fields of Rosline<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond. Piscottie.</NOTE>. He thence conducted the army south∣wards
into Annandale; and prepared to pass the borders
at Solway-Frith. But many of the nobility were dis∣gusted
with the regent's administration; and observing,
that his connexions with his native country were very
feeble in comparison of those with France, they mur∣mured,
that for the sake of foreign interests, their peace
should be so often disturbed, and war, during their King's
minority, be wantonly entered into with a neighbouring
nation, so much superior in force and riches. The Gor∣dons,
in particular, refused to advance any farther; and
Albany, observing a general discontent to prevail, was
obliged to conclude a truce with lord Dacres, warden of
the English west marches. Soon after, he departed for
France; and lest the opposite faction should gather force
in his absence, he sent thither before him the earl of An∣gus,
husband to the queen dowager.</P>
<P>NEXT year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1523.</NOTE> Henry, that he might take advantage of
the regent's absence, marched an army into Scotland
under the command of Surrey, who ravaged the Merse
and Teviotdale without opposition, and burned the town
of Jedburgh. The Scots had neither King nor Regent
to conduct them: The two Humes had been put to
death: Angus was in a manner banished; No nobleman
of vigour or authority remained, who was qualified to
assume the government: And the English monarch, who
knew the distrest situation of the country, determined to
push them to extremity, in hopes of engaging them, by
the sense of their present miseries, to make a solemn re∣nounciation
of the French alliance, and embrace that of
England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Herbert.</NOTE>. He even gave them hopes of contracting a
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
marriage between the lady Mary, heiress of England,
and their young monarch; an expedient, which would
for ever unite the two kingdoms<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 39.</NOTE>: And the queen dow∣ager,
with her whole party, recommended every where
the advantages of this alliance, and of a confederacy with
England. They said, that the interests of Scotland had
too long been sacrificed to those of the French nation,
who, whenever they found themselves reduced to diffi∣culties,
called for the assistance of their allies, but were
ready to abandon them, so soon as they found their ad∣vantage
in making peace with England: That where a
small state entered into so close a confederacy with a
greater, it must always expect this treatment, as a con∣sequence
of the unequal alliance; but that there were
peculiar circumstances in the situation of the kingdoms,
which, in the present case, rendered it inevitable: That
France was so distant and so divided from them by seas,
that she scarce could by any means, and never could in
time, send succours to the Scots, sufficient to protect
them against ravages from the neighbouring kingdom:
That nature had, in a manner, framed an alliance be∣tween
the two British nations; having enclosed them in
the same island; given them the same manners, language,
laws, and form of government; and prepared every
thing for an intimate union between them: And that, if
national antipathies were abolished, which would soon
be the effect of peace, these two kingdoms, secured by
the ocean and by their domestic force, could set at de∣fiance
all foreign enemies, and remain for ever secure and
unmolested.</P>
<P>THE partizans of the French alliance said, on the
other hand, that the very reasons, which were urged in
favour of a league with England, the close neighbour∣hood
of the kingdom and its superior force, were the
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
real causes, why a sincere and durable confederacy could
never be framed with that hostile nation: That among
neighbouring states, occasions of quarrel were frequent;
and the more powerful people would be sure to seize
every frivolous pretence for oppressing the weaker, and
reducing them to subjection: That as the near neigh∣bourhood
of France and England had kindled a war al∣most
perpetual between them, it was the interest of the
Scots, if they wished to maintain their independancy, to
preserve their league with the former kingdom, which
ballanced the force of the latter: That if they deserted
that old and salutary alliance, on which their importance
in Europe chiefly depended, their antient enemies, sti∣mulated
both by interest and by passion, would soon in∣vade
them with superior force, and reduce them to sub∣jection:
Or if they delayed the attack, the insidious
peace, by making the Scots lose the use of arms, would
only prepare the way for a slavery more certain and more
irretrieveable<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE arguments employed by the French party, being
seconded by the natural prejudices of the people, seemed
rather to prevail: And when the regent himself, who
had been long detained beyond his appointed time by the
terror of the English fleet, at last appeared among them,
he was able to throw the balance entirely on that side.
By the authority of the convention of states, he assembled
an army, with a view of avenging the ravages committed
by the English in the beginning of the campaign; and
he led them southwards towards the borders. But when
they were passing the Tweed at the bridge of Melross,
the English party were again able to raise such opposition,
that Albany thought proper to make a retreat. He
marched downwards, along the banks of the Tweed,
keeping that river on his right; and fixed his camp op∣posite
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
to Werk-Castle, which Surrey had lately repaired.
He sent over some troops to besiege that fortress, who
made a breach in it, and stormed some of the outworks:
But the regent, hearing of the approach of an English
army, and discouraged by the advanced season, thought
proper to disband his forces and retire to Edinburgh.
Soon after he went over to France, and never again re∣turned
to Scotland. The Scots nation, agitated by their
domestic factions, were not, during several years, in a
condition to give any more disturbance to England; and
Henry had full leisure to prosecute his designs on the
continent.</P>
<P>THE reason, why the war against France proceeded
so slowly on the part of England was the want of money.
All Henry the seventh's treasures were long since dissi∣pated;
the King's habits of expence still remained; and
his revenues were unequal even to the ordinary support
of his government, much more to his military enter∣prizes.
He had last year caused a general survey to be
made of the kingdom; the numbers of men, their years,
profession, stock, revenue<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Stowe, 514.</NOTE>; and expressed great satis∣faction
on finding the nation so opulent. He then issued
out privy seals to the most wealthy, demanding loans of
particular sums; and this act of power, tho' somewhat
irregular and tyrannical, had been formerly practised by
the Kings of England; and the people were now fami∣liarized
to it. But Henry carried his authority much
farther on this occasion. He published an edict for a
general tax upon his subjects, which he still called a loan;
and he levied five shillings in the pound from the clergy,
two shillings from the laity. This pretended loan, as
being more regular, was really more dangerous to the
liberties of the people; and was a precedent for the
King's imposing taxes without consent of Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="58"/>
HENRY summoned a Parliament this year, together
with a convocation; and found neither of them in a dis∣position
to complain of the infringement of their privi∣leges.
It was only doubted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th April. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> how far they would carry
their liberality to the King. Wolsey, who had under∣taken
the management of this affair, began with the con∣vocation;
in hopes, that their example would influence
the Parliament to grant a large supply. He demanded a
moiety of their ecclesiastical revenues to be levied in five
years, or two shillings in the pound during that time,
and tho' he met with opposition, he reprimanded so se∣verely
the refractory members, that his request was at last
complied with. The cardinal afterwards, attended by
several of the nobility and prelates, came to the house of
commons; and in a long and elaborate speech laid before
them the public necessities, the dangers of an invasion
from Scotland, the affronts received from France, the
league in which the King was engaged with the pope and
the emperor; and he demanded a grant of 800,000
pounds, divided into four yearly payments; a sum, com∣puted
from the late survey or valuation, to be equivalent
to four shillings in the pound of one year's revenue, or
one shilling in the pound yearly, according to the division
proposed. So large a grant was unusual from the com∣mons;
and tho' the cardinal's demand was seconded by
Sir Thomas More the speaker, and several other mem∣bers
attached to the court, the house could not be pre∣vailed
with to comply<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Stowe, 518. Parliamentary History. Strype, vol. i. p. 49, 50.</NOTE>. They only voted two shillings
in the pound on all possessed of twenty pounds a year
and upwards, one shilling on all between twenty pounds
and forty shillings a year; and on all the rest of the sub∣jects
above sixteen years of age a groat a-head. This last
sum was divided into two yearly payments; the former
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
into four yearly payments, and was not therefore at the
outmost above six-pence in the pound. The grant of the
commons was but the moiety of the sum demanded; and
the cardinal, therefore, much mortified with the disap∣pointment,
came again to the house, and desired to rea∣sion
with such as refused to comply with the King's re∣quest.
He was told, that it was a rule of the house never
to reason but among themselves; and his desire was re∣jected.
The commons, however, enlarged a little their
former grant, and voted an imposition of three shillings
in the pound on all possessed of fifty pounds, a year, and
upwards<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">It is said, that when Henry heard that the commons made a great difficulty of granting the required supply, he was so provoked, that he sent for Edward Montague, one of the members, who had a considerable influence on the house; and he being introduced to his majesty, had the mortification to hear him speak in these words: <HI>Hoo! Man! will they not suffer my bill to pass?</HI> And laying his hand on Montague's head, who was then on his knees before him: <HI>Get my bill passed by to-morrow, or else to-morrow this head of yours shall be off.</HI> This cavalier manner o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Henry succeeded: For next day the bill was passed. <HI>Collins's British <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eerage. Grove's life of Wolsey.</HI> We are told by <HI>Hall,</HI> fol. 38. That cardinal Wolsey endeavoured to terrify the citizens of London into the general loan, exacted in 1525, and told them plainly, that <HI>it were better, that some should suffer indigence, than that the King at this time should lack; and therefore beware and resist not, nor ruffle not in this case, for it may for∣tune to cost some people their heads.</HI> Such was the style, employed by this King and his ministers.</NOTE>. The proceedings of this house of commons
discover evidently the humour of the times: They were
extremely tenacious of their money, and refused a de∣mand
of the crown, which was far from being unreason∣able;
but they allowed an encroachment on national
privileges to pass uncensured, tho' its direct tendency
was to subvert entirely the liberties of the people. The
King was so dissatisfied with this saving disposition of the
commons, that, as he had not called a Parliament during
seven years before, he allowed seven more to elapse, be∣fore
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
he summoned another. And on pretence of necessity,
he levied, in one year, from all who were worth forty
pounds, what the parliament had granted him payable in
four years<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Speed. Hall. Herbert.</NOTE>; a new invasion of national privileges.
These irregularities were commonly ascribed to the car∣dinal's
counsels, who, trusting to the protection, afforded
him by his ecclesiastical character, was less scrupulous
in his encroachments on the civil rights of the nation.</P>
<P>THAT ambitious prelate received this year a new dis∣appointment
in his aspiring views. The pope, Adrian
the sixth, died; and Clement the seventh, of the family
of Medicis, was elected in his place, by the concurrence
of the imperial party. Wolsey began now to perceive
the insincerity of the emperor, and concluded that that
prince would never second his pretensions to the papal
chair. This injury was highly resented by the cardinal;
and he began thenceforth to estrange himself from the
imperial court, and to pave the way for an union between
his master and the French King. Meanwhile, he dis∣sembled
his resentment; and after congratulating the new
pope on his promotion, applied for a continuation of the
legatine powers, which the two former popes had con∣ferred
upon him. Clement, knowing the importance of
gaining his friendship, granted him a commission for life;
and by this unusual concession, he in a manner trans∣ferred
to him the whole papal authority in England. In
some particulars, Wolsey made a good use of this exten∣sive
power. He erected two colleges, one at Oxford,
another at Ipswich, the place of his nativity: He sought,
all over Europe, for learned men to supply the chairs of
these colleges: And in order to bestow endowments on
them, he suppressed some smaller monasteries, and distri∣buted
the monks into other convents. The execution
of this project became the less difficult for him, because
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
the Romish church began to perceive, that she over∣abounded
in monks, and that she wanted some supply of
learning, in order to oppose the inquisitive, or rather dis∣putative,
humour of the new reformers.</P>
<P>THE confederacy against France seemed more formi∣dable
than ever, on the opening of this campaign<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 14.</NOTE>.
Adrian, before his death, had renewed the league with
Charles and Henry. The Venetians had been induced
to desert the French alliance, and to form engagements
for the securing Sforza in possession of the Milanese. The
Florentines, the dukes of Ferrara and Mantua, and all
the powers of Italy combined in the same measure. The
emperor in person menaced France with a powerful inva∣sion
on the side of Guienne: The forces of England and
the Netherlands seemed ready to break into Picardy: A
numerous body of Germans were preparing to ravage
Burgundy: But all these perils from foreign enemies were
less threatening than a domestic conspiracy, which had
been forming, and which was now come to full maturity
against the French monarch.</P>
<P>CHARLES duke of Bourbon, constable of France, was
a prince of the most shining merit; and, beside distin∣guishing himself in many military enterprizes, he was
adorned with every accomplishment, which became a
person of his high station. His virtues, embellished with
the graces of youth, had made such impression on Louise
of Savoy, Francis's mother, that, without regard to the
inequality of their years, she made him proposals of mar∣riage;
and meeting with a refusal, she formed schemes
of unrelenting vengeance against him. She was a woman,
false, deceitful, vindictive, malicious; but, unhappily
for France, had by her capacity, which was considerable,
acquired an absolute ascendant over her son. By her in∣stigation,
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
Francis put many affronts on the constable,
which it was difficult for a gallant spirit to endure; and
at last he permi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted Louise to prosecute a lawsuit against
him, by which, on the most frivolous pretences, he was
deprived of his ample possessions; and inevitable ruin was
brought upon him.</P>
<P>BOURBON, provoked at all these indignities, and
thinking, that, if any injuries could justify a man in re∣belling
against his prince and country, he must stand ac∣quitted,
had entered into a secret correspondence with
the emperor and the King of England<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellay, liv. 2.</NOTE>. Francis, per∣tinacious
in his design of recovering the Milanese, had
proposed to lead his army in person into Italy; and Bour∣bon,
who feigned sickness, in order to have a pretence
for staying behind, intended, so soon as the King had
passed the Alps, to raise an insurrection among his nu∣merous
vassals, by whom he was extremely beloved, and
to introduce foreign enemies into the heart of the king∣dom.
Francis got intimation of his design; but not
being prompt enough in securing so dangerous a foe, the
constable made his escape<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Belcarius, lib. 17.</NOTE>; and putting himself in the
emperor's service, did all the injuries to his native coun∣try,
which his enterprizing spirit and his great talents for
war enabled him to perform. Charles professed such re∣gard
for him, that he promised him his sister in marriage,
Eleonora, widow to Emanuel, King of Portugal; and
when the constable came to Madrid, some time after,
the emperor received him with all the demonstrations of
friendship. He said to a Spanish grandee, that he must
desire him, while Bourbon resided in that city, to allow
him to take up his residence in his house, as most suitable
to his rank and quality. The nobleman replied, with a
Castilian dignity, that his majesty's desire was to him a
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
sufficient reason; but he must tell him beforehand, that
so soon as Bourbon departed, he would raze to the ground
the house which had been polluted by the presence of such
a traitor<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of England, desirous that Francis should
undertake his Italian expedition, did not openly threaten
Picardy this year with an invasion; and it was late before
the duke of Suffolk, who commanded the English forces,
passed over to Calais.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Aug.</NOTE> He was attended with the lords
Montacute, Herbert, Ferrars, Morney, Sandys, Berke∣ley,
Powis, and many other noblemen and gentlemen<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>.
The English army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> reinforced by some troops, drawn
from the garrison of Calais, amounted to about 12,000
men; and having joined an equal number of Flemings
under the count de Buren, they prepared for an invasion
of France. The siege of Boulogne was first proposed;
but that enterprize appearing difficult, it was thought
more adviseable to leave this town behind them. The
frontier of Picardy was very ill provided of troops; and
the only defence of that province was the activity of the
French officers, who infested the allied army in their
march, and threw garrisons, with great expedition, into
every town, which was threatened by them. After
coasting the Somme, and passing Hedin, Montreuil, Dour∣lens,
the English and Flemings presented themselves be∣fore
Bray, a place of small force, which commanded a
bridge over the Somme. Here they were resolved to
pass, and, if possible, to take up winter quarters in
France; but Crequi threw himself into the town, and
seemed determined to defend it. The allies attacked him
with vigour and success; and when he retreated over the
bridge, they pursued him so hotly, that they allowed him
not time to break it down, but passed it along with him,
and put him to route. They next advanced to Mont∣didier,
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
which they besieged and took by capitulation,
Meeting with no opposition, they proceeded to the river
Oise, within eleven leagues of Paris, and threw that city
into great consternation; till the duke of Vendôme has∣tened
with some forces to its relief. The confederates,
then, afraid of being surrounded, and reduced to extre∣mities
during so advanced a season, thought proper to re∣tire.
Montdidier was abandoned: And the English and
Flemings went each into their own country.</P>
<P>FRANCE defended herself from the other invasions
with equal facility and equal good fortune. Twelve
thousand Lansquenets broke into Burgundy under the
command of the count of Furstenberg. The count of
Guise, who defended that frontier, had nothing to op∣pose
to them but some militia, and about nine hundred
heavy-armed cavalry. He threw the militia into the gar∣rison-towns;
and with his cavalry, he kept the field,
and so harrassed the Germans, that they were glad to
make their retreat into Lorraine. Guise attacked them
as they passed the Meuse, put them into disorder, and
cut off the greatest part of their rear.</P>
<P>THE emperor made great preparations on the side of
Navarre; and, tho' that frontier was well guarded by
nature, it seemed now exposed to great danger from this
powerful invasion which threatened it. Charles besieged
Fontarabia, which had fallen a few years before into
Francis's hands; and when he had drawn thither Lautrec,
the French general, he raised the siege of a sudden, and
sat down before Bayonne. Lautrec, aware of that stra∣tagem,
made a sudden march and threw himself into Bay∣onne,
which he defended with such vigour and courage,
that the Spaniards were constrained to raise the siege.
The emperor would have been totally unfortunate on this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide, had he not turned back upon Fontarabia, and,
contrary to the advice of all his generals, sat down, in
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
the winter season, before that city, well fortified and
strongly garrisoned. The cowardice or misconduct of
the governor saved him the shame of a new disappoint∣ment.
The place was surrendered in a few days; and
the emperor, having finished this enterprize, put his
troops into winter quarters.</P>
<P>SO obstinate was Francis in prosecuting his Italian ex∣pedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Italian wars.</NOTE>
that, notwithstanding these dangerous invasions,
with which his kingdom was menaced on every side, he
had determined to lead in person a powerful army to the
conquest of Milan. The intelligence of Bourbon's revolt
and escape stopped him at Lyons; and fearing some in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urrection in the kingdom from the intrigues of a man
so powerful and so beloved, he thought it prudent to re∣main
in France; and to send forward his army, under
the command of admiral Bonnivet. The dutchy of Milan
had been purposely left in a condition somewhat defence∣less,
with a view of alluring Francis to attack it; and no
sooner had Bonnivet passed the Tesin, than the army of
the league, and even Prosper Colonna, who commanded
it, a very prudent general, were in the utmost confusion.
It is agreed, that if Bonnivet had immediately advanced
to Milan, that great city, on which the whole dutchy
depends, would have opened its gates without resistance:
But as he wasted his time in frivolous enterprizes, Co∣lonna
had opportunity to reinforce the garrison, and to
put the place in a posture of defence. Bonnivet was
now obliged to attempt reducing the city by blockade and
famine; and he took possession of ail the posts, which
commanded the passages to it. But the army of the
league, mean-while, was not inactive; and they so
straitened and harrassed the quarters of the French, that
it seemed more likely the latter would themselves perish
by famine, than reduce the city to that extremity. Sick∣ness
and fatigue and want had wasted them to such a<NOTE PLACE="marg">1524.</NOTE>
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
degree, that they were ready to raise the blockade; and
their only hopes consisted in a great body of Swiss, which
was levied for the service of the French King, and whose
arrival was every day expected.</P>
<P>THE Swiss had in that ago so great a superiority in
the field above a almost every other nation, and had been
so much courted by all the great potentates of Europe,
that they were become extremely capricious and haughty,
and thought that the sate of kingdoms depended entirely
on their assistance or opposition. Francis had promised
to this body of mercenaries, whom he had hired to join
Bonnivet, that so soon as they arrived in the plains of
Piedmont, the duke of Longueville should join them
with four hundred lances, and conduct them to the
French camp: But by some accident Longueville's
march had been retarded, and the Swiss had been oblig∣ed
to march, without the honour of being escorted by
him. Offended at this neglect, as they interpreted it,
they no sooner came within sight of the French camp,
than they stopped, and instead of joining Bonnivet, they
sent orders to a great body of their countrymen, who
then served under him, immediately to begin their march,
and to return home in their company<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 15. Memoires du Bellay, liv. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER, this desertion of the Swiss, Bonnivet had no
other choice, but that of making his retreat, as fast as
possible, into France. He accordingly put himself in
motion for that purpose; but the allies, who foresaw
this measure, were ready to fall upon his rear. The
French army, however, after a sharp action, made good
their retreat, though not without considerable loss both
in officers and private men. Among the rest, fell in
this action the brave chevalier. Bayard, esteemed in that
age the model of soldiers and men of honour, and de∣nominated
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
the <HI>knight without fear and withhout reproach.</HI>
When this gallant gentleman felt his wounds to be mor∣tal,
and could no longer support himself on horseback,
he ordered his attendants to set him under a tree, and
turn his face towards the enemy, that he might die in
that posture. The generals of the allies, and among
the rest the duke of Bourbon, came about him, and ex∣pressed
their concern for his present condition. “Pity
not me,” cried he to Bourbon; “I die in the dis∣charge
of my duty: They alone are the objects of
pity, who fight against their prince and country<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, vol. iii. p. 152.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE French being thus expelled Italy, the pope, the
Venetian's, the Florentines were satisfied with the ad∣vantage
obtained over them, and were resolved to prose∣cute
their victory no farther. All these powers, especially
Clement, had entertained a violent jealousy of the em∣peror's
ambition; and their jealousy was extremely aug∣mented,
when they saw him refuse the investiture of
Milan, a fief of the empire, to Francis Sforza, whose
title he had acknowledged, and whose defence he had
embraced<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 15.</NOTE>. They all concluded, that he intended to
put himself in possession of that important dutchy, and
reduce Italy to subjection: Clement in particular, actu∣ated
by this jealousy, proceeded so far in opposition to
the emperor, that he sent orders to his nuncio at London
to mediate a reconciliation between France and England.
But affairs were not yet fully ripe for this change.
Wolsey, disgusted with the emperor, but still more actu∣ated
by vain-glory, was determined, that he himself
should have the renown of bringing about that great alter∣ation;
and he engaged the King to reject the pope's medi∣ation.
A new treaty was even concluded between Henry
and Charles for the invasion of France. Charles stipu∣lated

to supply the duke of Bourbon with a powerful
army, in order to conquer Provence and Dauphiny:
Henry agreed to pay him a hundred thousand crowns for
the first month; after which, he might either chuse to
continue the same monthly payments, or invade Picardy
with a powerful army. Bourbon was to possess these
provinces with the title of King; but to hold them in
fief of Henry as King of France. The dutchy of Bur∣gundy
was to be given to Charles: The rest of the
kingdom to Henry.</P>
<P>THIS chimerical partition immediately failed of exe∣cution
in the article, which was most easily performed:
Bourbon refused to acknowledge Henry as King of
France. His enterprize, however, against Provence still
took place. A numerous army of Imperialists invad∣ed
that country under his command and that of the
marquis of Pescara. They laid siege to Marseilles,
which, being weakly garrisoned, they expected to carry
in a little time: But the burgesses defended themselves
with such valour and obstinacy, that Bourbon and Pe∣scara,
who heard of the French King's approach with a
numerous army, found themselves under a necessity of
raising the siege; and they led their forces, much weak∣ened,
baffled, and disheartened, into Italy.</P>
<P>FRANCIS might now have enjoyed in safety the glory
of repulsing all his enemies, in every attempt which
they had hitherto made of breaking into his kingdom:
But as he received intelligence, that the King of England,
discouraged by his former fruitless enterprizes, and dis∣gusted with the emperor, was making no preparations
for the invasion of Picardy, his antient ardour seized
him for the conquest of Milan; and, notwithstanding
the advanced season, he was immediately determined,
contrary to the advice of his wisest counsellors,
to lead his army into Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="71"/>
HE passed the Alps at Mount Cenis, and no sooner
appeared in Piedmont, than he threw the whole Milanese
into consternation. There was no army in the field able
to oppose him; and Milan itself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of France invades Itlay.</NOTE> though affectionate to
its duke, was not in the same posture of defence as last
year, when blockaded by admiral Bonnivet. It was
almost destitute of inhabitants: Great numbers had died
of the plague; and the rest had fled into the country
for safety. Francis immediately marched to that city,
which opened its gates to receive him. The forces of
the emperor and Sforza fled to Lodi; and had Francis
been so fortunate as to pursue them, they had abandoned
that place, and had been totally dissipated<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 15. Du Bellay, lib, 2.</NOTE>. But his ill
fate led him to besiege Pavia, a town of considerable
strength, well-garrisoned, and defended by Leyva, one
of the bravest officers in the Spanish service. Every at∣tempt,
which the French King made to gain this im∣portant
place, proved fruitless. He battered the walls,
and made breaches; but by the vigilance of Leyva,
new retrenchments were instantly thrown up behind the
breaches: He attempted to divert the course of the
Tesin, which ran by one side of the city, and defended
it; but an inundation of the river deftroyed in one
night all the mounds which the soldiers, during a long
time, and with infinite pains, had been erecting. Fa∣tigue
and the bad season (for it was now the depth of
winter) had wasted the French army. And the more
to diminish its force, Francis, at the pope's solicitation,
who now declared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1525.</NOTE> almost openly, for him, had detach∣ed
a considerable body, under the duke of Albany, to
invade the kingdom of Naples. The imperial generals
mean while were not idle. Pescara and Lannoy, vice∣roy
of Naples, gathered forces from all quarters. Bour∣bon,
having pawned his jewels for money, went into
<PB N="62" REF="72"/>
Germany, and by his personal interest, levied twelve
thousand Lansquenets, with which he joined the impe∣rialists.
This army was advancing to raise the siege of
Pavia; and the danger to the French became every day
more imminent.</P>
<P>THE state of Europe was such, during that age, that,
partly from the want of commerce and industry every
where, except in Italy and the Low Countries, partly
from the extensive privileges still possessed by the people
in all the great monarchies, and their frugal maxims in
granting money, the revenues of the princes were ex∣tremely
narrow, and even the small armies, which they
kept on foot, could not be regularly paid by them. The
imperial forces, commanded by Bourbon, Pescara, and
Lannoy, exceeded not twenty thousand men; they were
the only body of troops maintained by the emperor (for
he had not been able to levy any army for the invasion of
France, either on the side of Spain or Flanders.) Yet
so poor was that mighty monarch, that he could trans∣mit
no money for the payment of this army; and it was
chiefly the hopes of sharing the plunder of the French
camp, which had made them advance, and kept them
to their standards. Had Francis raised the siege before
their approach, and retired to Milan, they must immedi∣ately
have dispersed themselves; and he bad obtained a
complete victory, without danger or bloodshed. But it
was the character of this monarch, to become obstinate
in proportion to the difficulties which he encountered;
and having once said, that he would take Pavia or perish
before it, he was resolved rather to endure the utmost
extremities than depart from this resolution.</P>
<P>THE imperial generals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Fe∣bruary. Battle of Pavia, and captivity of Francis.</NOTE> after cannonading the French
camp for several days, at last gave a general assault, and
and broke into the intrenchments. Leyva fallied from the
town, and threw the besiegers into still greater confusion.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="73"/>
The Swiss infantry, contrary to their usual practice,
behaved in a dastardly manner, and deserted their post.
Francis's whole army was put to rout; and he himself,
surrounded by his enemies, after fighting with the most
heroic valour, and killing seven men with his own
hand, was at last obliged to surrender himself prisoner.
Almost the whole army, full of nobility and brave of∣ficers,
either perished by the sword, or were drowned in
the river. The few, who escaped with their lives, fell
into the hands of the enemy. The imperial generals
had so little authority over their own troops, even after
this signal victory, that Lannoy, apprehensive lest the
Lansquenets should seize Francis as security for the pay
due to them, immediately removed him from the camp,
and sent him to Pizzighitone. And taking advantage
of the terrors, which had seized the pope, the Florentines,
the duke of Ferrara, and other Italian states, he obliged
them, though secretly enemies, to advance money for the
subsistence of his army.</P>
<P>THE emperor received this news by Pennalosa, who
passed through France, by means of a safe-conduct,
which he received from the captive King. The modera∣tion,
which he displayed on this occasion, had it been
sincere, would have done him great honour. Instead of
rejoicing, he expressed sympathy with Francis's ill for∣tune,
and discovered his sense of those calamities, to
which the greatest monarchs are exposed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vera. hist. de Charl. V.</NOTE>. He refused
the city of Madrid permission to make any public expres∣sions
of triumph; and said that he reserved all his exulta∣tion
till he should be able to obtain some victory over
the infidels. He sent orders to his frontier garrisons to
commit no hostilities upon France. He spoke of con∣cluding
immediately a peace on reasonable terms. But
all this seeming equity was only hypocrisy, so much the
<PB N="64" REF="74"/>
more dangerous, as it was profound. And his sole oc∣cupation
was the forming schemes, how, from this great
incident, he might draw the utmost advantage, and gra∣tify
that exorbitant ambition, by which, in all his actions,
he was wholly governed.</P>
<P>THE same Pennalosa, in passing through France, car∣ried
also a letter from Francis to his mother, whom he
had left regent, and who then resided at Lyons. It
contained only these few words, <HI>Madam, all is lost,
except our honour.</HI> The princess was struck with the greatness
of the calamity. She saw the kingdom without a sove∣reign,
without an army, without generals, without
money; surrounded on every hand by implacable and
victorious enemies: And her sole resource, in her present
distresses, were the hopes, which she entertained, of peace
and even of assistance from the King of England.</P>
<P>HAD the King entered into the war against France
from any concerted political views, it is evident, that
the victory of Pavia, and the captivity of Francis, were
the most fortunate incidents which could have befallen
him, and the only ones which could render his schemes
effectual. While the war was carried on in the former
feeble manner, without any decisive advantage, he might
have been able to possess himself of some frontier towns,
or perhaps of a small territory, which he could not keep
possession of, without expending much more than its
value. By some great calamity alone, which annihilated
the power of France, could he hope to acquire the do∣minion
of considerable provinces, or dismember that
mighty monarchy, so affectionate to its own government
and its own sovereigns. But as it is probable, that Henry
had never before carried his reflections so far; he was
startled at this important event, and became sensible of
his own danger, as well as that of all Europe, from the loss
of a proper counterpoise to the great power of Charles.
<PB N="65" REF="75"/>
Instead of taking advantage, therefore, of the distressed
condition of France, he was determined to lend her his
assistance in her present calamities; and as the glory of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry em∣braces the alliance of France.</NOTE>
generosity, in raising a fallen enemy, concurred with his
political interests, he hessitated the less in embracing these
new measures.</P>
<P>SOME disgusts also had previously taken place between
Charles and Henry, and still more between Charles and
Wolsey; and that powerful minifter waited only for a
favourable opportunity of revenging the disappointments,
which he had met with. The behaviour of Charles,
immediately after the victory of Pavia, gave him oc∣casion
to revive the King's jealousy and suspicions of his
ally. The emperor supported so ill the appearance of
moderation, which he at first assumed, that he had al∣ready
changed his usual stile to Henry; and instead of
writing to him with his own hand, and subscribing him∣self
<HI>your affectionate son and cousin;</HI> he dictated his letters
to his secretary, and simply subscribed himself <HI>Charles</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>.
Wolsey also perceived a diminution in the caresses and
professions, with which the emperor's letters to him were
usually loaded; and this last imprudence, proceeding from
the intoxication of success, was probably more dangerous
to Charles's interests than the other.</P>
<P>HENRY, though determined to embrace new measures,
was careful to save appearances in the change; and he
caused rejoicings to be every where made on account of
the victory of Pavia, and the captivity of Francis. He
publicly dismissed a French envoy, whom he had for∣merly
allowed, notwithstanding the war, to reside at Londond<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Du Bellay, liv. iii. Stowe, p. 221. Baker, p. 273.</NOTE>: But upon the regent of France's submissive
applications to him, he again opened a correspondence
<PB N="66" REF="76"/>
with her; and besides assuring her of his friendship and
protection, he exacted a promise, that she never would
consent to the dismembering any province of the mo∣narchy
for her son's ransom. With the emperor, how∣ever,
he put on the appearance of vigour and enterprize;
and in order to have a pretence for breaking with him,
he dispatched Tonstal, bishop of London, to Madrid,
with proposals for a powerful invasion of France. He
required, that Charles should immediately enter Guienne
at the head of a great army, in order to put him in pos∣session
of that province; and he demanded the payment
of large sums of money, which that prince had borrowed
from him in his last visit at London. He knew, that
the emperor was in no situation of executing either of
these conditions; and that he had as little inclination to
make him master of such considerable territories upon the
frontiers of Spain.</P>
<P>TONSTAL likewise, after his arrival at Madrid, in∣formed
his master, that Charles, on his part, wanted
not complaints against England; and in particular was
displeased with Henry, because last year he had neither
continued his monthly payments to Bourbon, nor invad∣ed
Picardy, according to his stipulations; that, instead
of expressing his intentions to espouse Mary, when she
should be marriageable, he had hearkened to proposals,
for marrying his niece Isabella, princess of Portugal;
and that he had entered into a separate treaty with Fran∣cis,
and seemed determined to reap alone all the advan∣tages
of the success, with which fortune had crowned
his arms.</P>
<P>THE King, influenced by all these motives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Au∣gust.</NOTE> conclud∣ed
at Moore his alliance with the regent, and engaged
to procure Francis his liberty on reafonable conditions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet, Resueil des Traites de Leonard, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, 2. Merbert.</NOTE>:
<PB N="67" REF="77"/>
The regent also, in another treaty, acknowledged the
kingdom to be Henry's debtor for one million eight hun∣dred
thousand crowns, to be discharged in half yearly
payments of fifty thousand crowns; After which, Henry
was to receive during his own life, a yearly pension of a
hundred thousand crowns. Notwithstanding his gene∣rosity,
he could not forbear taking advantage of the ca∣lamitous
situation of France, in order to exact this lucra∣tive
condition from her. A large present of a hundred
thousand crowns was also made to Wolsey, for his good
offices, but covered under the pretence of arrears due on
the pension granted him for relinquishing the administra∣tion
of Tournay.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, as Henry foresaw, that this treaty with
France might involve him in a war with the emperor,
he was also determined to fill his treasury by impositions
upon his own subjects; and as the parliament had dis∣covered
some reluctance in complying with his demands,
he followed the advice of Wolsey, and resolved to make
use of his prerogative alone for that purpose. He issued
out commissions to all the counties of England, for levy∣ing
four shillings in the pound from the clergy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontends of the English.</NOTE> three
shillings and four pence from the laity; and so uncon∣troulable
did he deem his authority, that he took no
care to cover, as formerly, this arbitrary exaction, even
under the slender pretence of a loan. But he soon found,
that he had presumed too far on the passive submission of
his subjects. The people, displeased with an exaction,
beyond what was usually levied in those days, but still more disgusted with the illegal method of imposing it,
broke out in murmurs, complaints, opposition to the
commissioners; and their refractory disposition even
threatened a general in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urrection. Henry had the pru∣dence
to stop short, in that dangerous path, into which
he had entered. He sent letters to all the counties;
<PB N="68" REF="78"/>
declaring, that he meant no force by this last imposition,
and that he would take nothing of his subjects but by
way of <HI>benevolence.</HI> He flattered himself, that his con∣descension in employing that disguise would satisfy the
people, and that no one would dare to render himself
obnoxious to royal authority, by refusing any payment
required of him in this manner. But the spirit of oppo∣sition
was once roused, and could not so easily be quieted
at pleasure. A lawyer in the city objecting the statute
of Richard the third, by which benevolences were for
ever abolished, it was replied by the court, that Richard
being an usurper, and his parliaments factious assemblies,
his statutes could not bind a lawful and <HI>absolute</HI> monarch,
who held his crown by hereditary right, and needed not
to court the favour of a licentious populace<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hall.</NOTE>. The
judges even went so far as to affirm positively, that the
King might exact by commission any sum which he
pleased; and the privy council gave a ready assent to
this decree, which annihilated the most valuable privi∣lege
of the people, and rendered all their other privileges
precarious. Armed with such formidable authority, of
royal prerogative and a pretence of law, Wolsey sent
for the mayor of London, and desired to know what he
was willing to give for the supply of his majesty's neces∣sities.
The mayor seemed desirous, before he should
declare himself, to consult the common council; but the
cardinal required, that he and all the aldermen should
separately confer with himself about the benevolence;
and he eluded by that means the danger of a formed op∣position.
Matters, however, went not so smoothly in
the country. An insurrection was begun in some places;
but as the people were not headed by any considerable
person, it was easy for the duke of Suffolk, and the earl
of Surrey, now duke of Norfolk, by employing persuasion
<PB N="69" REF="79"/>
and authority, to induce the ringleaders to lay down
their arms, and surrender themselves prisoners. The
King, finding it dangerous to punish criminals, engaged
in so popular a cause, was determined, notwithstanding
his violent, imperious temper, to grant them a general
pardon; and he very prudently imputed their guilt, not
to their want of loyalty or affection, but to their po∣verty.
The offenders were brought before the star∣chamber;
where, after a severe charge laid against them
by the King's council, the cardinal said, “That, not∣withstanding
their grievous offences, the King, in
consideration of their necessities, had granted them
his gracious pardon, upon condition, that they would
give in sureties for their future good behaviour.” But
they replying, that they had no sureties, the cardinal
first, and after him the duke of Norfolk, said, that they
would stand bound for them. Upon which they were
discharged<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hall. Stowe, 525. Hollingshed, p. 891.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE arbitrary impositions, being generally imputed
to the cardinal's counsels, increased the general odium,
under which he laboured; and the clemency of the par∣don,
being ascribed to the King, was considered as an
atonement on his part for the illegality of the measure.
But Wolsey, supported both by royal and papal autho∣rity,
proceeded, without scruple, to violate all ecclesi∣astical
privileges, which, during that age, were much
more sacred than civil; and having once prevailed in that
unusual attempt of suppressing some monasteries, he kept
all the rest in awe, and exercised over them the most
arbitrary jurisdiction. By his commission as legate, he
was impowered to visit them, and reform them, and
chastise their irregularities; and he employed his usual
agent, Allen, in the exercise of this authority. The
<PB N="70" REF="80"/>
religious houses were obliged to compound for their
guilt, real or pretended, by giving large sums to the car∣dinal
or his deputy; and this oppression was carried so
far, that it reached at last the King's ears, which were
not commonly open to complaints against his favourite.
He reproved. Wolsey in severe terms, which rendered
him, if not more innocent, at least more cautious for
the future. That haughty minister had built a splendid
palace at Hampton-court, which he probably intended,
as well as that of York-place in Westminster, for his own
use; but fearing the increase of envy on account of this
magnificence, and desirous to appease the King, he
made him a present of that building, and told him,
that, from the first, he had erected it for his service.</P>
<P>THE absolute authority, possessed by the King, render∣ed
his domestic government, both over his people and
his ministers, easy and expeditious: The conduct of
foreign affairs alone required effort and application; and
they were now brought to such a situation, that it was
no longer safe for England to be entirely neutral. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eigned moderation of the emperor was of very short
date; and it was soon obvious to all the world, that his
great dominions, far from gratifying his ambition, were
only regarded as the means of acquiring an empire more
extensive. The terms, proposed by him to his prisoner,
were such as must have for ever annihilated the power
of France, and destroyed the balance of Europe. He
required, that that monarch should restore to him the
dutchy of Burgundy, usurped, as he pretended, by Lewis
the eleventh upon his ancestors; that he should yield
Provence and Dauphiny to the duke of Bourbon, to be
possessed by him in full sovereignty, without fief or ho∣mage
to the crown of France; that he should satisfy the
King of England with regard to the provinces, which
that prince claimed as his inheritance; and that he
<PB N="71" REF="81"/>
should renounce all title to Naples, Milan, Genoa, or
any territory in Italy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE demands were proposed to Francis, soon after
the battle of Pavia, while he was detained in Pizzighi∣tone;
and as he had hitherto trusted somewhat to the
emperor's generosity, the disappointment excited in his
breast the most lively indignation. He said, that he
would rather live and die a prisoner than agree to dis∣member
his kingdom; and that, even were he so base as
to submit to such terms, his subjects would never permit
him to carry them into execution. The offers which
he made for obtaining his liberty, were, that he would
renounce all claims in Italy, that he would assist the
emperor in recovering the territories usurped upon the
empire by the Venetians, that he would relinquish the
homage due by the emperor for Artois and Flanders,
that he would marry Eleonora, the emperor's sister, (for
he was now a widower) and acknowledge the dutchy of
Burgundy to be possessed as her dowry; and to be in∣herited
by her children<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">De Vera hist. de Charles V.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FRANCIS was encouraged to persist in these efforts, by
the favourable accounts, which he heard of Henry's dis∣positions
towards him, and of the alarms which had
seized all the chief powers in Italy, upon his defeat and
captivity. He was uneasy, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Francis re∣moved to Madrid.</NOTE> to be so far distant
from the emperor with whom he must treat; and he
desired to be removed to Madrid, in hopes that a personal
interview would operate much in his favour, and that
Charles, if not influenced by his ministers, might be
found possessed of the same frankness of disposition, by
which he himself was distinguished. He was soon con∣vinced
of his mistake. The emperor, under pretence of
an assembly of the states at Toledo, kept, during some
<PB N="72" REF="82"/>
time, at a distance from him; and even after they broke
delayed his visit to the captive King; feigning a
delicacy In that particular, as if his company, in the
present situation of affairs, before any terms were agreed
on, would be regarded as an insult upon the royal pri∣soner.
Francis, partly from want of exercise, partly
from reflections on his present melancholy situation, fell
into a languishing illness; which begot apprehensions in
Charles, left the death of his captive should bereave him
of all those advantages, which he proposed to extort
from him. He then paid him a visit in the castle of
Madrid; and as he approached the bed in which Francis
was laid, the sick monarch called to him, “You come,
Sir, to visit your prisoner.” “No,” replied the
emperor, “I come to visit my brother, and my friend,
who shall soon obtain his liberty.” He soothed his
affliction with many speeches of a like nature, which
had so good an effect, that the King daily recovered<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Herbert. De Vera, Sandoval.</NOTE>;
and thenceforth employed himself in concerting with
the ministers of the emperor, the terms of this treaty.</P>
<P>WHILE this negociation advanced slowly, fortune
threw into the emperor's hands a new opportunity of
aggrandizing his dominions in Italy. Francis Sforza,
impatient that his investiture of Milan should so long be
delayed, and that even after it was granted, it should be
encumbered with many exorbitant conditions, had en∣deavoured
to seduce Pescara, the imperial general, from
his fidelity, and to engage him in a conspiracy against
his master. Pescara feigned to enter into the design;
but having revealed the whole contrivance, he received
orders to take possession of the Milanese; and Charles
made no secret of his intention to try Sforza and forfeit
his fief, on account of the treason, which he had com∣mitted
<PB N="73" REF="83"/>
against his liege-lord and sovereign<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>. This inci∣dent
retained the Italian powers in closer union with
France; and the emperor, by grasping too much, found
himself in danger of losing all his advantages. His ap∣prehensions
were encreased, when he heard, that Francis
had sent a resignation of his crown to the regent, and
had desired that the dauphin might be crowned King;
orders, which, though they were not obeyed, shewed his
determined resolution never to submit to the unreasonable
terms required of him. The chief difficulty of the
treaty was now reduced to the dutchy of Burgundy; and
even that territory, Francis had agreed to yield, but he
still insisted on first recovering his liberty. All mutual
confidence was lost between the two princes; and each
feared, lest advantage should be taken of his simplicity,
should he first execute his part of the treaty.</P>
<P>AT last the emperor was willing to relax of his ri∣gour
in this particular;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1526. 14 January.</NOTE> and the treaty of Madrid was
signed, by which, it was hoped, an end would be finally
put to the differences between these great monarchs. The
principal condition was the restoring of Francis's liberty,
and the delivery of his two eldest sons as hostages to the
emperor for the restitution of Burgundy: If any difficulty
should afterwards occur in the execution of this article,
with regard to Burgundy, from the opposition of the
states, either of France or of that province, Francis sti∣pulated,
that in six weeks time, he should return to his
prison, and remain there till the full performance of the
treaty. There were many other articles in this famous
convention, all of them rigorous and severe to the last
degree against the captive monarch; and Charles dis∣covered
evidently his intention of reducing Italy, as well
as France, to subjection and dependance.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="84"/>
MANY of Charles's ministers foresaw, that Francis,
however solemn the oaths, promises, and protestations
exacted of him, never would execute a treaty, which was
so disadvantageous, or rather ruinous and destructive, to
himself, his posterity, and his country. By putting Bur∣gundy
into the emperor's hands, he gave his powerful
enemy an entrance into the heart of the kingdom: By
Sacrificing his allies in Italy, he deprived himself of all
foreign assistance; and arming his oppressor with the
whole force and wealth of that opulent country, ren∣dered
him absolutely irresistable. To these great views
of interest, were added the motives, no less cogent, of
passion and resentment; while Francis, a prince, who,
piqued himself on generosity, reflected on the rigour with
which he had been treated during his captivity, and the
cruel terms which had been exacted of him for the re∣covery
of his freedom. It was also foreseen, that ths
emulation and rivalship, which had so long subsisted be∣tween
these two monarchs, would make him feel the
strongest reluctance on yielding the superiority to an an∣tagonist, wlio, by the whole tenor of his conduct, he
would be apt to think, had shown himself so little wor∣thy
of that advantage, which fortune, and fortune alone,
had put into his hands. His ministers, his friends, his
subjects, his allies, with one voice, would be sure to
suggest to him, that the first object of a prince, was the
preservation of his people; and that the laws of honour,
which with a private man ought to be absolutely su∣preme,
and superior to all interests, were with a sovereign
subordinate to the great duty of ensuring the safety of his
country. Nor could it be imagined, that Francis would
be so romantic in his principles, as not to hearken to a
casuistry, which was so plausible in itself, and which so
much, flattered all the passions, by which, both as a
prince and a man, he was strongly actuated.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="85"/>
SUCH was the reasoning of several of Charles's minis∣ters,
particularly of Gattinara, his chancellor<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>, who
counselled him to treat Francis with more generosity,
and to give him his liberty on such terms, as would en∣gage
him, not by the feeble band of treaties, but by the
more forcible tye of honour, to a strict and faithful per∣formance.
But the emperor's avidity prevented him from
following this wiser and more honourable council; at
the same time, that the prospect of a general combina∣tion
of Europe hindered him from detaining Francis in
captivity, and taking advantage of the confusions, which
his absence must necessarily occasion in his kingdom.
Still suspicious, however, of the sincerity of his prisoner,
he took an opportunity, before they parted, of asking
him, privately and as a friend, whether he seriously in∣tended
to execute the treaty of Madrid; protesting, that,
in all cases, he was firmly determined to restore him to
his liberty, and that the prospect of obtaining this ad∣vantage
needed no longer engage him to dissemble.
Francis was too well acquainted with Charles's charac∣ter
to trust to the sincerity of this protestation; and
therefore renewed his assurances of fidelity, and a strict
observance of his word. The emperor replied, that
Francis was now his best friend and ally; but if he
should afterwards break his engagements, which he could
not suspect, he should think himself entitled to reproach
him with a condudt so base and unworthy: And on
these terms the two monarchs parted.</P>

to the assault with the utmost valour, and entering the
city, sword in hand, exercised all those brutalities, which
may be expected from, ferocity excited by resistance,
and from insolence which takes place when that resistance
is no more.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1527.</NOTE> This renowned city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sack of Rome.</NOTE> exposed by her re∣nown
alone to so many calamities, never endured in any
age, even from the barbarians, by whom she was often
sudoued, such indignities as she was now constrained to
suffer. The unrestrained massacre and pillage, which
continued for several days, were the least ills, to which
the unhappy Romans were exposed<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 18. Bellay. Stowe, p. 527.</NOTE>. Whatever was
respectable in modesty or sacred in religion seemed but
the more to provoke the insults of the soldiery. Virgins
suffered violation in the arms of their parents, and upon
those very altars, to which they had fled for protection.
Aged prelates, after enduring every indignity, and even
every torture, were thrown into dungeons, and menaced
each moment with the most cruel death, in order to en∣gage
them to reveal their secret treasures, or purchase
liberty by exorbitant ransoms. Clement himself, who
had trusted for protection to the sacredness of his cha∣racter,
and neglected to make his escape in time, was
taken captive, and found that his dignity, which pro∣cured
him no regard from the Spanish soldiers, did but
draw on him the insolent mockery of the German, who,
being generally attached to the Lutheran principles,
were pleased to gratify their animosity by the abasement
of the sovereign pontiff.</P>
<P>WHEN intelligence of this great event was conveyed
to the emperor, that young prince, habituated to hy∣pocrisy,
expressed the most profound sorrow for the
success of his arms: He put himself and all his court
into mourning: He stopped the rejoicings for the birth
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>
of his son Philip: And knowing that every artifice, how∣ever
gross, is able, when seconded by authority, to im∣pose
upon the people, he ordered prayers, during several
months, to be put up in all the churches for the Pope's
liberty; an event, which, all men knew, a letter under
his hand could in a moment have procured.</P>
<P>THE concern, expressed by Henry and Francis for
the calamity of their ally, was much more sincere.
These two monarchs, a few days before the sack of
Rome, had concluded a treaty<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">30th April.</NOTE> at Westminster, in
which, besides renewing former alliances, they agreed
to send ambassadors to Charles, requiring him to accept
of two millions of crowns as the ransom of the
French princes, and to repay the money, borrowed of
Henry; and in case of refusal, the ambassadors, attended
with heralds, were ordered to denounce war against him.
This war, it was agreed to prosecute in the Low Coun∣tries,
with an army of thirty thousand infantry and fif∣teen
hundred men at arms, two thirds to be supplied by
Francis, the rest by Henry. And in order to strengthen
the alliance between the princes, it was stipulated, that
either Francis or his son, the duke of Orleans, as should
afterwards be agreed on, should espouse the princess
Mary, Henry's daughter. No sooner did the monarchs
receive intelligence of Bourbon's enterprize, than they
changed, by a new treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> the scene of the projected war
from the Netherlands to Italy; and hearing of the pope's
captivity, they were farther stimulated to undertake the
war with vigour for the restoring his liberty. Wolsey
himself crossed the seas, in order to have an interview
with Francis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th July.</NOTE> and to concert measures for that purpose;
and he displayed all that grandeur and magnificence,
with which he was so much intoxicated. He was attend∣ed
with a train, of a thousand horse. The cardinal of
<PB N="80" REF="88"/>
Lorraine, and the chancellor Alançon, met him at Bou∣logne:
Francis himself, besides granting to that haughty
prelate the power of giving in every place, where he came,
liberty to all prisoners, made a journey as far as Amiens
to meet him, and even advanced some miles from the
town, the more to honour his reception. It was here
stipulated, that the duke of Orleans should espouse the
princess Mary; and as the emperor seemed to be taking
some steps towards assembling a general council, the two
monarchs agreed not to acknowledge it, but, during the
interval of the pope's captivity, to govern the churches in
their dominions, each by his own authority. Wolsey
made some attempts to get his legatine power extended
into France, and even into Germany; but finding his
efforts fruitless, he was obliged, tho' with great reluc∣tance,
to desist from these ambitious enterprizes<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, book 3. coll. 12, 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE more to cement the union, between these princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Sept.</NOTE>
a new treaty was, some time after, concluded at London;
in which Henry agreed to renounce for ever all claims to
the crown of France; claims, which might now indeed
be deemed chimerical, but which often served as a pre∣tence
for exciting the unwary English to wage war upon
the French monarchy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">League with France.</NOTE> As a return for this concession,
Francis bound himself and his successors to pay for ever
fifty thousand crowns a year to Henry and his successors;
and that a greater solemnity might be given to this treaty,
it was agreed, that the Parliaments and great nobility of
both kingdoms should give their consent to it. The
mareschal Montmorency, accompanied with many per∣sons
of distinction, and attended by a pompous equipage,
was sent over to ratify the treaty; and was received at
London with all the parade, which suited the solemnity
of the occasion. The terror of the emperor's greatness
had entirely extinguished the antient animosity between
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>
the nations; and Spain, during more than a century,
became, tho' a more distant power, the chief object of
jealousy to the English.</P>
<P>THIS appearance of a cordial union between France
and England, tho' it added influence to the joint embassy
which they sent to the emperor, was not able to bend
that ambitious monarch to submit entirely to the condi∣tions
insisted on by the allies. He departed indeed from
his demand of Burgundy as the ransom of the French
princes; but: he required, previously to their recovery of
liberty, that Francis should evacuate Genoa, and all the
fortresses held by him in Italy: And he declared his in∣tention
of bringing Sforza to a trial, and confiscating
the dutchy of Milan, on account of his pretended treason.
The English and French heralds, therefore, according
to agreement, declared war against him, and set him at
defiance. Charles answered the English herald with mo∣deration;
but to the French, he reproached his master
with breach of faith, reminded him of the private conver∣sation
which had passed between them at Madrid before
their separation, and offered to prove by single combat,
that that monarch had acted dishonourably. Francis re∣taliated
this challenge by giving Charles the lie; and,
after demanding security of the field, he offered to main∣tain
his cause by single combat. Many messages passed
to and fro between them; but tho' both the princes were
undoubtedly brave, the intended duel never took place.
The French and Spaniards, during that age, disputed
zealously which of the monarchs incurred the blame of
this failure; but all men of moderation every where la∣mented
the power of fortune, that the prince the more
candid, generous, and sincere, should, by unhappy in∣cidents,
have been reduced to that cruel situation, that
nothing but the breach of his word could preserve his
people, and that he must ever after, without being able
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
to make a proper reply, bear to be reproached with this
infidelity by a rival, inferior to him both in honour and
in virtue.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this famous challenge between Charles and
Francis had no immediate consequences with regard to
these monarchs themselves, it produced a considerable
alteration on the manners of the age. The practice of
challenges and duels, which had been part of the antient
barbarous jurisprudence, which was still preserved on very
solemn occasions, and which was even countenanced by
the civil magistrate, began thenceforth to prevail on the
most trivial occasions; and men, on any affront or inju∣ry,
thought themselves entitled, or even required in ho∣nour,
to take private revenges on their enemies, by vin∣dicating
their right in single combat. These absurd, tho'
generous maxims, shed much of the best blood in chris∣tendom
during more than two centuries; and notwith∣standing the severity of law, such Is the prevailing force
of custom, they are far from being as yet entirely ex∣ploded.</P>

the papal authority before the reformation, the
marriage of Henry the eighth with Catherine of Arragon,
his brother's widow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scruples concerning the King's marriage.</NOTE> had not passed, without much scru∣ple
and difficulty. The prejudices of the people were in
general bent against a conjugal union, between such near
relations; and the late King, tho' he had solermized the
espousals, when his son was but twelve years of age,
gave evident proofs of his intention to take afterwards a
proper opportunity of annulling them<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Morison's Apomaxis, p. 13.</NOTE>. He ordered the
young prince, so soon as he came of age, to enter a pro∣testation against the marriage<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Morison, p. 13. Heylin's Queen Mary, p. 2.</NOTE>; and on his death-bed he
charged him, as his last injunction, not to finish an al∣liance,
so unusual and exposed to such insuperable objec∣tions.
After the King's accession, some members of the
Privy Council, particularly Warham, the primate, open∣ly
declared against the resolution, of compleating the
<PB N="84" REF="92"/>
marriage; and tho' Henry's youth and dissipation kept
him, during some times from entertaining any scruples
with regard to the measure which he had embraced,
there happened incidents, sufficient to rouze his atten∣tion,
and to inform him of the sentiments, generally e∣ntertained
on that subject. The states of Castile had op∣posed
the emperor Charles's espousals with Mary, Henry's
daughter; and among other objections, had insisted on
the illegitimate birth of the young princess<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, Fiddes's life of Wolsey.</NOTE>. And when
the negotiations were afterwards opened with France,
and mention was made of betrothing her to Francis or
the duke of Orleans, the bishop of Tarbe, the French
ambassador, revived the same objection<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. 192, 203. Heylin, p. 3.</NOTE>. But tho' these
events naturally raised some doubts in Henry's mind,
there concurred other causes, which tended much to for∣tify
his remorse, and render his conscience more scru∣pulous.</P>
<P>THE queen was older than the King by no less than
six years;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King enters into these scru∣ples.</NOTE> and the decay of her beauty, together with
particular infirmities and diseases, had contributed, not∣withstanding her blameless character and deportment, to
render her person unacceptable to him. Tho' she had
borne him several children, they all died in early infancy,
except one daughter; and he was the more struck with
this misfortune, because the curse of being childless is the
very threatening, contained in the Mosaical law against
those who espouse their brother's widow. The King
was actuated by a strong desire of having male issue:
With a view to that end, it is believed, more than from
desire towards other gratification, he had, a few years
before this period, made addresses to a young lady, Ca∣therine,
daughter of Sir John Blount; and when she
<PB N="85" REF="93"/>
bore him a son, he expressed the highest satisfaction, and
immediately created him duke of Richmond. The suc∣cession
of the crown too was a consideration, that oc∣curred
to every one, whenever the lawfulness of Henry's
marriage was questioned; and it was apprehended, that,
if doubts of Mary's legitimacy concurred with the weak∣ness
of her sex, the King of Scots, the next heir, would
certainly advance his own pretensions, and might throw
the kingdom into confusion. The evils, as yet recent,
of civil wars and convulsions, arising from a disputed
title, made great impression on the minds of men, and
rendered the people universally desirous of any event,
which might obviate so irreparable a calamity. And the
King was thus impelled, both by his private passions,
and by motives of public interest, to seek the dissolution
of his inauspicious, and, as it was esteemed, unlawful
marriage with Catherine.</P>
<P>HENRY afterwards affirmed, that his scruples of con∣science
arose entirely from private reflection; and that
on consulting his confessor, the bishop of Lincoln, he
found that prelate possessed with the same doubts and dif∣ficulties.
The King himself, being so great a casuist
and divine, proceeded then to examine the question more
carefully by his own learning and study; and having had
recourse to Thomas of Aquine, he observed that this ce∣lebrated
doctor, whose authority was great in the church
and absolute with him, had treated of that very case, and
had expressly declared against the lawfulness of such mar∣riages<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Fiddes.</NOTE>. The prohibitions, said Thomas, contained in
Leviticus, and among the rest, that of marrying a bro∣ther's
widow, are moral, eternal, and founded on a di∣vine
sanction; and tho' the pope may dispense with the
rules of the church, the laws of God cannot be fet aside
by any authority less than that which enacted them.
<PB N="86" REF="94"/>
The archbishop of Canterbury was next applied to; and
he was required to consult his brethren: All the prelates
of England, except Fisher, bishop of Rochester, de∣clared
unanimously, under their hand and seal, that they
deemed the King's marriage unlawful<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 38. Stowe, p. 548.</NOTE>. Wolsey also
fortified the King's scruples<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 46, 166, 168. Saunders. Heylin, p. 4.</NOTE>, partly with a view of pro∣moting
a total breach with the emperor, Catherine's ne∣phew,
partly desirous of connecting the King more
closely with Francis, by marrying him to the dutchess of
Alençon, sister to that monarch; and perhaps too some∣what
disgusted with the queen herself, who had reproved
him for certain freedoms, unbefitting his character and
station<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 38. Strype, vol. i. p. 88.</NOTE>. But Henry was carried forward, tho' perhaps
not at first excited, by a motive more forcible than even
the suggestions of that powerful favourite.</P>
<P>ANNE Boleyn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anne Bo∣leyn.</NOTE> who lately appeared at court, had been
created maid of honour to the queen; and having had
frequent opportunities of being seen by the King, and of
conversing with him, she had acquired an entire ascendant
over his affections. This young lady, whose grandeur and
misfortunes have rendered her so celebrated, was daugh∣ter
to Sir Thomas Boleyn, who had been employed by
the King in seveval embassies, and who was allied to all
the principal nobility of the kingdom. His wife, mother
to Anne, was daughter of the duke of Norfolk; his own
mother was daughter of the earl of Ormond; his grand∣father
Sir Geoffry Boleyn, who had been mayor of Lon∣don,
had espoused one of the daughters and co-heirs of
the lord Hastings<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden's preface to the life of Elizabeth. Burnet, vol, i. p. 44.</NOTE>. Anne herself, tho' then in very early
youth, had been carried over to Paris by the King's
sister, when she espoused Lewis the twelfth of France;
<PB N="87" REF="95"/>
and upon the decease of that monarch, and the return of
his dowager into England, Anne, whose accomplish∣ments
even in her tender years were always much ad∣mired,
was retained in the service of Claude, queen of
France, spouse to Francis; and after her death, she passed
into the family of the dutchess of Alençon, a princess of
singular merit. The exact time, when she returned to
England, is not certainly known; but it was after the
King had entertained doubts with regard to the lawful∣ness
of his marriage with Catherine; if the account is
to be credited, which he himself afterwards gave of that
transaction. Henry's scruples had made him break off all
conjugal commerce with the queen; but as he still sup∣ported
an intercourse of civility and friendship with her,
he had occasion, in the visits, which he paid her, to ob∣serve the beauty, the youth, the charms of Anne Boleyn.
Finding the accomplishments of her mind nowise inferior
to her exterior graces, he even entertained the design of
raising her to the throne; and was the more confirmed
in this resolution, when he found that her virtue and mo∣desty
prevented all hopes of gratifying his passion after
any other manner. And as every motive of inclination
and policy, seemed thus to concur in making the King
desirous of a divorce from Catherine, and as his prospect
of success was inviting, he resolved to make applications
to Clement, and he sent Knight, his secretary, to Rome
for that purpose.</P>
<P>THAT he might not shock the haughty claims of the
pontiff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry ap∣plies to the pope for a divorce.</NOTE> it was resolved not to found the application on
any general doubts of the papal power to permit marriage
in the nearer degrees of consanguinity; but only to insist
on particular grounds of invalidity in the bull, which
Julius had granted for the marriage of Henry and Cathe∣rine.
It was a maxim in the court of Rome, that, if
the pope be surprized into any concession, or grant any
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>
indulgence upon false suggestions, the bull may after∣wards
be annulled; and this pretence had usually been
employed, wherever one pope had recalled any deed,
executed by any of his predecessors. But Julius's bull,
when examined, afforded plentiful matter of this kind;
and any tribunal, favourable to Henry, needed not want
a specious colour for gratifying him in his applications
for a divorce. It was said in the preamble, that the bull
had been granted upon his solicitation; tho' it was
known, that, at that time, he was below twelve years of
age: It was also affirmed, as another motive for the
bull, that the marriage was requisite, in order to preserve
peace between the two crowns; tho' it is certain, that
there was not then any ground or appearance of quarrel
between them. These false premises in Julius's bull,
seemed to afford Clement, a sufficient reason or pretence
for annulling it, and granting Henry a dispensation for a
second marriage<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Collier, Eccles. Hist. vol. ii. p. 25. from the Cott. Lib. Vitell.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho'<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pope favourable.</NOTE> the pretext for this indulgence had been less
plausible, the pope was in such a situation, that he had
the strongest motive to embrace every opportunity of gra∣tifying
the English monarch. He was then a prisoner
in the hands of the emperor, and had no hopes of reco∣vering
his liberty on any reasonable terms, unless by the
efforts of the league, which Henry had formed with
Francis and the Italian powers, in order to oppose the
exorbitant ambition of Charles. When the English Se∣cretary,
therefore, made private applications to him, he
received a very favourable answer; and a dispensation
was forthwith promised to be expedited to his master<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 47.</NOTE>.
Soon after, the march of a French army into Italy, under
the command of Lautrec, obliged the imperialists to give
Clement his liberty; and he retired to Orvietto, where
<PB N="89" REF="97"/>
the Secretary, with Sir Gregory Cassali, the King's re∣sident
at Rome, renewed their applications to him.
They found him still full of high professions of friendship,
gratitude, and attachment to the King; but not so ex∣peditious
in granting his request as they expected. The
emperor, who had got intelligence of Henry's application
to Rome, had exacted a promise of the pope, to take no
steps in that affair before he communicated them to the
imperial ministers; and Clement, confined by this pro∣mise,
and still more overawed by the emperor's forces in
Italy, seemed willing to postpone those concessions de∣sired
of him by Henry. Importuned, however, by the
English ministers, he at last put into their hands a <HI>com∣mission</HI>
to Wolsey, as legate, in conjunction with the
archbishop of Canterbury, or any other English prelate,
to examine the validity of the King's marriage, and of
Julius's dispensation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. 237.</NOTE>: He also granted them a provi∣sional
<HI>dispensation</HI> for the King's marriage with any other
person; and promised to expedite a <HI>decretal bull,</HI> annulling
the marriage with Catherine. But he represented to them
the dangerous consequences, which must ensue to him,
if these concessions should come to the emperor's know∣ledge;
and he conjured them not to publish those papers,
or make any further use of them, till his affairs were in
such a situation as to secure his liberty and independance.
And his secret advice was, whenever they should find
the proper time of opening the scene, that they should
prevent all opposition, by proceeding immediately to a
conclusion, by declaring the marriage with Catherine in∣valid,
and by Henry's instantly espousing some other per∣son.
Nor would it be so difficult, he said, for himself to
confirm these proceedings, after they were passed, as pre∣viously
to render them valid, by his consent and autho∣rity<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Collier, from Cott. Lib. Vitell. B. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="98"/>
WHEN Henry received the commission and dispensa∣tion
from his ambassadors, and was informed of the pope's
advice, he laid the whole matter before his ministers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1528.</NOTE>
and asked their opinion in so delicate a situation. The
English counsellors considered the danger of proceeding
in the manner pointed out to them. Should the pope
refuse to confirm a deed, which he might justly call pre∣cipitate
and irregular, and should he disavow the advice
which he gave in so clandestine a manner, the King
would find his second marriage totally invalidated; any
children, which it might bring him, declared illegiti∣mate;
and his marriage with Catherine more firmly ri∣vetted
than ever<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 51.</NOTE>. And Henry's apprehensions of the
possibility, or even probability, of such an event, were
much confirmed, when he reflected on the character and situation of the sovereign pontiff.</P>
<P>CLEMENT the seventh was a prince of excellent judg∣ment,
whenever his timidity, to which he was extremely
subject, allowed him to make full use of those talents,
and that penetration, with which he was endowed<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1. Guicciardini.</NOTE>.
The captivity, and other misfortunes, which he had un∣dergone,
by entering into a league against Charles, had
so affected his imagination, that he never afterwards ex∣erted
himself with vigour in any public measures, espe∣cially
if the interests or inclinations of that potentate
stood in opposition to him. The imperial forces were,
at present, powerful in Italy, and might return to the
attack of Rome, which was still defenceless, and exposed
to the same calamities with which it had already been
overwhelmed. And besides these dangers, Clement found
or fancied himself exposed to perils, which threatned,
still more immediately, his person and dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="99"/>
CHARLES, apprized of the timid disposition of the
holy father, threw out perpetual menaces of summoning
a general council; which he represented was necessary
to reform the church, and correct those enormous abuses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The empe∣ror threat∣ens him.</NOTE>
which the ambition and avarice of the court of Rome
had introduced into every branch of ecclesiastical admi∣nistration.
The power of Clement himself, he said, the
sovereign pontiff, required limitation; his conduct called
aloud for amendment; and even his title to the throne,
which he filled, might justly be brought in question.
That pope had always passed for the natural son of Julian
of Medicis, who was of the sovereign family of Flo∣rence;
and tho' Leo the tenth, his cousin, had declared
him legitimate, upon a pretended promise of marriage
between his father and mother, few persons believed that
declaration to be founded on any just reason or autho∣rity<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.
The canon law, indeed, had been entirely silent
with regard to the promotion of bastards to the papal
throne; but, what was still dangerous, the people had
entertained a violent prepossession, that that stain in the
birth of any person was sufficient to incapacitate him for
so holy an office. And in another point, the canon law
was express and positive, that no man, guilty of simony,
could attain that dignity. A severe bull of Julius the
second had added new sanctions to this law, by declaring,
that a simoniacal election should not be rendered valid,
even by a posterior consent of the cardinals. But unfor∣tunately
Clement had given to cardinal Colonna a billet,
containing promises of advancing that cardinal, in case
he himself should attain the papal dignity by his concur∣rence:
And this billet, Colonna, who was in entire de∣pendance
on the emperor, threatened every moment to
expose to public view<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="100"/>
WHILE Charles terrified the pope with these menaces,
he also allured him by hopes, which were no less preva∣lent
over his affections. At the time when the emperor's
forces sacked Rome, and reduced Clement to captivity,
the Florentines, passionate for their ancient liberty, had
taken advantage of his distresses, and revolting against
the family of Medicis, had entirely abolished their autho∣rity
in Florence, and re-established the former demo∣cracy.
The better to protect themselves in their freedom,
they had entered into the alliance with France, England,
and Venice, against the emperor; and Clement found,
that, by this interest, the hands of his confederates were
tied from assisting him in the restoration of his family;
the event, which, of all others, he most passionately de∣sired. The emperor alone, he knew, was able to effect∣tuate
this purpose; and therefore, whatever professions he
made of fidelity to his allies, he was always, on the least
glimpse of hope, ready to embrace every proposal of a
cordial reconcilement with that monarch<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Father Paul.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE views and interests of the pope were well
known in England; and as the opposition of the emperor
was foreseen to Henry's divorce, both on account of the
honour and interests of Catherine, his aunt, and the ob∣vious
motive of distressing an enemy, it was esteemed
dangerous to take any measure of consequence, in expec∣tation
of the subsequent concurrence of a man of Cle∣ment's
character, whose behaviour contained always so
much duplicity, and who was at present so little at his
own disposal. The safest measure seemed to consist in
previously engaging him so far, that he could not after∣wards
recede, and in making use of his present ambiguity
and uncertainty, to extort the most important conces∣sions
from him. For this purpose, Stephen Gardiner,
the cardinal's secretary, and Edward Fox, the King's
almoner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Feb.</NOTE> were dispatched to Rome, and were ordered to
<PB N="93" REF="101"/>
solicit a commission from the pope, of such a nature as
would oblige him to confirm the sentence of the com∣missioners,
whatever it was, and disable him, on any
account, to recall the commission, or evoke the cause to
Rome<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert. Burnet, vol. i. p. 29. in the collect. Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 28. Strype, vol. i. p. 93. with App. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 23, 24, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the same reason which made the King so desirous
of obtaining this concession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pope's ambiguous conduct.</NOTE> confirmed the pope in the
resolution of refusing it: He was still determined to keep
the door open to an agreement with the emperor, and
made no scruple of sacrificing all other considerations to a
point which he deemed, of all others, the most important
to his own security, and to that of his family. He
granted, therefore, a new commission, in which cardinal
Campeggio was joined to Wolsey, for the trial of the
King's marriage; but he could not be prevailed on to
insert the clauses desired of him. And though he put
into Gardiner's hands a letter, promising not to recall
the present commission; this promise was found, on ex∣amination,
to be couched in such ambiguous terms, as
left him still the power, whenever he pleased, of depart∣ing
from it<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, p. 221. Burnet, p. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CAMPEGGIO lay under some obligations to the King;
but his dependance on the pope was so much greater,
that he conformed himself entirely to the views of his
holiness; and tho' he received his commission in April,
he protracted his departure by so many artificial delays,
that it was October before he arrived in England. The
first step which he took, was to exhort the King to desist
from the prosecution of his divorce; and finding that this
counsel gave great offence, he said, that his intention
was also to exhort the queen to enter into a convent,
and that he thought it his duty, previously to attempt an
amicable composure of all differences<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 225.</NOTE>. The more to
<PB N="94" REF="102"/>
pacify the King, he shewed to him, as also to the cardi∣nal,
the decretal bull, annulling the former marriage
with Catherine; but no entreaties could prevail with him
to make any other of the King's council privy to the
secret<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 58.</NOTE>. In order to atone, in some degree, for this
obstinacy, he expressed to the King and the cardinal, the
pope's great desire of satisfying them in every reasonable
demand; and in particular, he showed, that their request
for suppressing some more monastries, and converting
them into cathedrals and bishops sees, had obtained the
consent of his holiness<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. p. 270. Strype, vol. i. p. 110, 111. Appen, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE ambiguous circumstances in the behaviour of
the pope and the legate, kept the court of England in
suspence, and determined the King to wait with patience
the issue of such uncertain councils.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1529.</NOTE> Fortune meanwhile
seemed to promise him a more sure and expeditious way of
extricating himself from his present difficulties. Cle∣ment
was seized with a dangerous illness; and the in∣trigues
for electing his successor, began already to take
place among the cardinals. Wolsey, in particular, sup∣ported
by the interest of England and France, entertained
hopes of mounting the throne of St. Peter<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 63.</NOTE>; and it ap∣pears,
that if a vacancy had then happened, there was a
probability of his reaching that summit of his ambition.
But the pope recovered his health, tho' after several re∣lapses;
and he returned to the same train of false and
deceitful politics, by which he had hitherto amused the
English court. He still flattered Henry with professions
of the most cordial attachment, and promised him a sud∣den
and favourable issue of his process: He still conti∣nued
his secret negociations with Charles, and persevered
in the resolution of sacrificing all his promises, and all the
interests of the Romish religion, to the elevation of his
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>
family. Campeggio, who was perfectly acquainted with
his views and intentions, protracted the decision by the
most artificial delays; and gave Clement full leisure to
adjust all the terms of his treaty with the emperor.</P>
<P>THE emperor, acquainted with the King's extreme
earnestness in this affair, was determined, that he should
obtain success by no other means but by an application to
him, and by deserting his alliance with Francis, which
had hitherto supported, against the superior force of Spain,
the tottering state of the French monarchy. He willing∣ly
hearkened, therefore, to the applications of Catherine,
his aunt; and promising her his utmost protection, ex∣horted
her never to yield to the malice and persecutions
of her enemies. The queen herself was naturally of a
firm and resolute temper; and was engaged by every
motive to persevere in protesting against the injustice to
which she thought herself exposed. The imputation of
incest, which was thrown upon her marriage with Henry,
struck her with the highest indignation: The illegiti∣macy
of her daughter, which seemed a necessary conse∣quence,
gave her the most just concern: The reluctance
of yielding to a rival, who, she believed, had supplanted
her in the King's affections, was a very natural motive.
Actuated by all these considerations, she never ceased
soliciting her nephew's assistance, and earnestly entreat∣ing
an evocation of the cause to Rome, where alone, she
thought, she could expect justice. And the emperor, in
all his negociations with the pope, made the recall of the
commission, which Campeggio and Wolsey exercised in
England, a fundamental article<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 225. Burnet, vol. i. p. 69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE two legates, meanwhile, opened their court at
London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">31 May.</NOTE> and cited the King and Queen to appear before
it. They both presented themselves; and the King an∣swered<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of the King's marriage.</NOTE> to his name, when called: But the Queen, in∣stead
<PB N="96" REF="104"/>
of answering to hers, rose from her seat, and
throwing herself at the King's feet, made a very pathetic
harangue, which her virtue, her dignity, and her misfor∣tunes,
rendered the more affecting. She told him, that
she was a stranger in his dominions, without protection,
without council, without assistance; exposed to all the
injustice, which her enemies were pleased to impose upon
her: That she had quitted her native country without
other resource, than her connexions with him and his
family, and had expected, that, instead of suffering thence
any violence or iniquity, she was assur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in them of a
safeguard against every misfortune: That she had been
his wife during twenty years, and would here appeal to
himself, whether her affectionate submission to his will
had not merited other treatment, than to be thus, after
so long a time, thrown from him with so much indignity:
That she was conscious—h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself was assured—that her
virgin honour was yet unstained, when he received her
into his bed, and that her connections with his brother
had been carried no further than the ceremony of mar∣riage:
That their parents, the Kings of England and
Spain, were esteemed the wisest princes of their time,
and had undoubtedly acted by the best advice, when they
formed the agreement for that marriage, which was now
represented as so criminal and unnatural: And that she
acquiesced in their judgment, and would not submit her
cause to be tried by a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourt, whose dependance on her
enemies was too visible, ever to allow her any hopes of
obtaining from them an equitable or impartial decision<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 73. Hall, Stowe, p. 543.</NOTE>.
Having spoken these words, she rose, and making the
King a low reverence, she departed from the court, and
never would again appear in it.</P>
<P>AFTER her departure, the King did her the justice to
acknowledge, that she had ever been a dutiful and affec∣tionate
<PB N="97" REF="105"/>
wife, and that the whole tenor of her behaviour
had been conformable to the strictest rules of probity and
honour. He only insisted on his own scruples, with re∣gard
to the lawfulness of their marriage; and he explained
the origin, the progress, and the foundation of those
doubts, by which he had been so long and so violently
agitated. He acquitted cardinal Wolsey of having any
hand in encouraging his scruples; and he begged a
sentence of the court, conformable to the justice of his
cause.</P>
<P>THE legates, after citing the queen anew to appear
before them, declared her <HI>contumacious,</HI> notwithstanding
her appeal to Rome; and then proceeded to the exami∣nation
of the cause. The first point which came before
them, was, the proof of prince Arthur's consummation
of his marriage with Catherine; and it must be confessed,
that no stronger arguments could reasonably be expected
of such a fact after so long an interval. The age of the
prince, who had passed his fifteenth year, the good state
of his health, the long time that he had cohabited with
his spouse, many of his expressions to that very purpose;
all these circumstances form a violent presumption, in
favour of the King's assertion<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Henry himself, after
his brother's death, was not allowed for some time to
bear the title of prince of Wales, in expectation of her
pregnancy: The Spanish ambassador, in order the better
to ensure possession of her jointure, had sent over to Spain,
proofs of the consummation of her marriage<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 35.</NOTE>: Julius's
bull itself was founded on the supposition, that Arthur
had <HI>perhaps</HI> had knowledge of the princess: In the very
treaty, fixing Henry's marriage, the consummation of
the former marriage with prince Arthur, is acknowledged
on both sides<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 81.</NOTE>, These particulars were all laid before
<PB N="98" REF="106"/>
the court; accompanied with many reasonings concerning
the extent of the pope's authority, and his power of
granting a dispensation to marry within the prohibited
degrees. Campeggio heard these doctrines with great
impatience; and notwithstanding his resolution to pro∣tract
the cause, he was often tempted to interrupt and
silence the King's council, when they insisted on such
disagreeable topics. The trial was spun out till the 23d
of July; and Campeggio chiefly took on him the part of
conducting it. Wolsey, tho' the elder cardinal, per∣mitted
him to act as president of the court; because it
was thought, that a trial, managed by an Italian cardi∣nal,
would carry the appearance of greater candour and
impartiality, than if the King's own minister and favou∣rite
had presided in it. The business now seemed to be
drawing near to a period; and the King was every day
in expectation of a sentence in his favour; when, to his
great surprize, Campeggio, on a sudden, without any
warning, and upon very frivolous pretences<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 76, 77.</NOTE>, prorogued
the court, till the first of October. The evocation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause evoked to Rome.</NOTE> which came a few days after from Rome, put an end to all
the hopes of success, which the King had so long and so
anxiously cherished<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 254.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING the time, that the trial was carried on before
the legates at London, the emperor had by his ministers
earnestly solicited Clement to evoke the cause to Rome;
and had employed every topic of hope or terror, which
could operate either on the passion or timidity of the pon∣tiff.
The English ambassadors, on the other hand, in
conjunction with the French, had been no less earnest in
their applications, that the legates should be allowed to
finish the trial; but, tho' they employed the same engines
of promises and menaces, the objects, which they could
set before the pope, were not so instant nor immediate as
<PB N="99" REF="107"/>
those which were held up to him by the emperor<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 75.</NOTE>. The
dread of losing England, and of fortifying the Lutherans
by so considerable an accession, made small impression on
Clement's mind, in comparison of the anxiety for his
own personal safety, and the fond desire of restoring the
Medici to their dominion in Florence. So soon, there∣fore,
as he had adjusted all terms with the emperor, he
laid hold of the pretence of justice, which required him,
he said, to pay regard to the queen's appeal; and sus∣pending
the commission of the legates, he evoked the
cause to Rome. The legate, Campeggio, had before∣hand
received private orders, delivered by Campana, to
burn the decretal bull, with which he was entrusted.</P>
<P>WOLSEY had long foreseen this measure as the sure
forerunner of his own ruin. Tho' he had at first desired,
that the King should rather marry a French princess than
Anne Boleyn, he had employed himself with the utmost
assiduity and earnestness to bring the affair to an happy
issue<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 45. Burnet, vol. i. p. 53.</NOTE>: He was not therefore to be blamed for the un∣prosperous
event, which the pope's partiality had pro∣duced.
But he had sufficient experience of the extreme
ardour and impatience of Henry's temper, who could
bear no contradiction, and who was wont, without exa∣mination
or distinction, to make his ministers answerable
for the issue of those transactions, with which they were
entrusted. Anne Boleyn also, who was prepossessed
against him, had imputed to him the failure of her hopes;
and as she was newly returned to court, whence she had
been removed, from a regard to decency, during the trial
before the legates, she had naturally acquired an additio∣nal
influence on Henry's mind, and she served much to
fortify his prejudices against the cardinal<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Cavendish, p. 40.</NOTE>. Even the
queen and her partizans, judging of Wolsey by the part
<PB N="100" REF="108"/>
which he had openly acted, had expressed the highest
animosity against him; and the most opposite factions
seemed now to combine in the ruin of this haughty mi∣nister.
The high opinion itself, which Henry had en∣tertained
of the cardinal's capacity, tended to hasten his
downfal; while he imputed the bad success of that mi∣nister's
undertakings, not to ill fortune or to mistake,
but to the malignity or infidelity of his intentions. The
blow, however, fell not instantly on his head. The
King, who probably could not justify by any good reason
his alienation from his antient favourite, seems to have
remained some time in suspence; and he received him,
if not with all his former kindness, at least with the ap∣pearance
of trust and regard.</P>
<P>BUT it is found almost impossible for a high confidence
and affection to receive the least diminution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wolsey's fall.</NOTE> without
sinking into absolute indifference, or even running into
the opposite extreme of hatred and aversion. The King
now determined to bring on the ruin of the cardinal with
a motion almost as precipitate as he had formerly em∣ployed
in his elevation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Oct.</NOTE> The dukes of Norfolk and Suf∣folk
were sent to require the great seal from him; and on
his scrupling to deliver it<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Cavendish, p. 41.</NOTE>, without a more express war∣rant,
Henry wrote him a letter, upon which it was sur∣rendered,
and was delivered by the King to Sir Thomas
More, a man, who, besides the ornaments of an elegant
literature, possessed the highest virtue, integrity and ca∣pacity.</P>
<P>WOLSEY was ordered to depart from York-Place, a
palace which he had built in London, and which, tho' it
really belonged to the see of York, was seized by Henry,
and became afterwards the residence of the Kings of Eng∣land,
under the title of Whitehall. All his furniture
and plate were converted to the King's use. Their riches
<PB N="101" REF="109"/>
and splendour befitted rather a royal than a private for∣tune.
The walls of his palace were covered with cloth
of gold or cloth of silver: He had a cupboard of plate of
massy gold: There were found a thousand pieces of fine
holland belonging to him. All the rest of his riches and
furniture was in proportion; and his opulence was pro∣bably
no small inducement to this violent persecution
against him.</P>
<P>THE cardinal was ordered to retire to Asher, a coun∣try
seat which he possessed near Hampton-Court. The
world, who had paid him such abject court during his
prosperity, now entirely deserted him, on this fatal re∣verse
of all his fortunes. He himself was much dejected
with the change; and from the same turn of mind, which
had made him be so vainly elated with his grandeur, he
felt the blow of adversity with double rigour<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 114, 115. App. N<SUP>o</SUP> 31, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The
smallest appearance of his return to favour threw him into
transports of joy, unbecoming a man. The King had
seemed willing, during some time, to intermit the blows,
which overwhelmed him. He granted him his protec∣tion,
and left him in possession of the sees of York and
Winchester. He even sent him a gracious message, ac∣companied
with a ring, as a testimony of his affection.
Wolsey, who was on horseback when the messenger met
him, immediately alighted; and throwing himself on his
knees in the mire, received in that humble posture these
marks of his majesty's gracious disposition towards him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 547.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT his enemies, who dreaded his return to court,
never ceased plying the King with accounts of his several
offences; and Anne Boleyn in particular, who bore him
no kindness, contributed her endeavours, in conjunction
with her uncle the duke of Norfolk, to exclude him from
all hopes of ever being reinstated in his former authority.
<PB N="102" REF="110"/>
He dismissed therefore his numerous retinue; and as he
was a kind and beneficent master, the separation passed
not without a plentiful effusion of tears on both sides<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Cavendish. Stowe, 549.</NOTE>.
The King's heart, notwithstanding some gleams of kind∣ness,
seemed now totally hardened against his old favou∣rite.
He ordered him to be indicted in the Star Chamber,
where a sentence was passed upon him. And not con∣tented
with this severity, he abandoned him to all the
rigour of the Parliament, which now, after a long inter∣val,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.</NOTE>
was again assembled. The house of lords voted a
long charge against Wolsey, consisting of forty-four ar∣ticles;
and accompanied it with an application to the
King for his punishment, and his removal from all au∣thority.
Little opposition was made to this charge in
the upper house: No evidence of any part of it was so
much as called for; and as it consists chiefly of general
accusations, it was scarce susceptible of any<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The first article of the charge against the cardinal is his procuring the legatine power, which, however, as it was certainly done with the King's consent and permission, could be nowise criminal. Many of the other articles also regard the mere exercise of that power. Some arti∣cles impute to him as crimes, particular actions, which were natural or unavoidable to any man, that was prime minister with so unlimited an authority; such as receiving first all letters from the King's ministers abroad, receiving first all visits from foreign ministers, desiring that all applications should be made thro' him. He was also accused of naming himself with the King, as if he had been his fellow, <HI>the King and I:</HI> It is reported that sometimes he even put his own name before the King's, <HI>ego et rex meus.</HI> But this mode of expression is justified by the Latin idiom. It is remarkable, that his whispering in the King's ear, knowing himself to be affected with venereal distempers, is an article against him. Many of the charges are general and incapable of proof. Lord Herbert goes so far as to affirm, that no man ever fell from so high a station, who had so few real crimes objected to him. This opinion is perhaps too favourable to the cardinal. Yet the refutation of the articles by Cromwel, and their being rejected by a house of commons even in this arbitrary reign, is almost a demonstration of Wolsey's innocence. Henry was, no doubt, entirely bent on his destruction, when, on his failure by a parliamentary impeachment, he attacked him upon the statute of provisors, which afforded him so little just hold on that minister. For <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat this indictment was subsequent to the attack in parliament, appears by Ca∣vendish's life of Wolsey, Stowe, p. 551, and more certainly by the very articles of impeachment themselves. Parliamentary History, vol. iii. p. 42. article 7. Coke's Inst. pt. 4. fol. 89.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="103" REF="111"/>
articles were sent down to the house of commons; where
Thomas Cromwel, formerly a servant of the cardinal,
and who had been raised by him from a very low station,
defended his unfortunate patron with such spirit, gene∣rosity,
and courage, as acquired him great honour, and
laid the foundation of that favour, which he afterwards
enjoyed with the King.</P>
<P>WOLSEY's enemies, finding that either his innocence
or his caution prevented them from having any just ground
of accusing him, had recourse to a very extraordinary ex∣pedient.
An indictment was lodged against him; that,
contrary to a statute of Richard the second, commonly
called the statute of provisors, he had procured bulls from
Rome, particularly that investing him with the legatine
power, which he had exercised with very extensive au∣thority.
He confessed the indictment, pleaded ignorance
of the statute, and threw himself on the King's mercy.
He was perhaps within reach of the law; but besides
that this statute was fallen altogether into disuse, nothing
could be more rigorous and severe than to impute to him
as a crime, what he had openly, during a course of so
many years, practised with the consent and approbation
of the King, and the acquiescence of the Parliament and
kingdom. Not to mention, what he always asserted<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cavendish, page 72.</NOTE>,
and what we can scarce doubt of, that he had obtained
the royal licence in the most formal manner, which, had
he not been apprehensive of the dangers attending any
<PB N="104" REF="112"/>
opposition to Henry's lawless will, he might have pleaded
in his own defence before the judges. Sentence, how∣ever,
was pronounced against him, “That he was out
of the King's protection; his lands and goods forfeited,
and that his person might be committed to custody.”
But this prosecution of Wolsey, tho' it was not disagree∣able
to Henry, was carried no farther. He even granted
him his pardon for all offences; restored him part of his
plate and furniture; and still continued, from time to
time, to drop expressions of favour and compassion to∣wards
him.</P>
<P>THE complaints against the usurpations of the ecclesi∣astics<NOTE PLACE="marg">Com∣mencement of the re∣formation in England.</NOTE>
had been very antient in England, as well as in
most other European kingdoms; and as this topic was
now become popular every where, it had paved the way
for the Lutheran tenets, and reconciled the people, in
some measure, to the frightful idea of heresy and innova∣tion.
The commons, finding the occasion favourable,
passed several bills, restraining the impositions of the cler∣gy;
one for regulating of mortuaries; another against
the exactions for the probates of wills<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">These exactions were quite arbitrary, and had risen to a great height. A member said in the house, that a thousand merks had been exacted from him on that account. Hall, fol. 188. Strype, vol. i. p. 73.</NOTE>; a third against
non-residence and pluralities, and against churchmens
being farmers of land. But what appeared chiefly dan∣gerous
to the ecclesiastical order, were the severe invec∣tives,
thrown out, almost without opposition, in the
house, against the dissoluteness of the priests, their am∣bition,
their avarice, and their endless encroachments on
the laity. Lord Herbert<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">P. 293.</NOTE> has even preserved the speech
of a gentleman of Grey's-Inn, which is of a very singular
nature, and contains such topics as we should little expect
to meet with during that period. The member insists
<PB N="105" REF="113"/>
upon the vast variety of theological opinions, which pre∣vailed
in different nations and ages; the endless inextri∣cable
controversies maintained by the several sects; the
impossibility, that any man, much less the people, could
ever know, much less examine, the tenets and principles
of each sect; the necessity of ignorance; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a suspence of
judgment with regard to all these objects of dispute:
And upon the whole, he infers, that the only religion
obligatory on mankind is the belief of one supreme Being,
the author of nature; and the necessity of good morals,
in order to obtain his favour and protection. Such senti∣ments
would be deemed latitudinarian, even in our time;
and would not be advanced, without some precaution, in
a public assembly. But tho' the first broaching of reli∣gious
controversy might encourage the sceptical turn in a
few persons of a studious disposition; the zeal, with
which men soon after attached themselves to their several
parties, served effectually to banish for a long time all
such obnoxious liberties.</P>
<P>THE bills for regulating the clergy met with some op∣position
in the house of lords. Bishop Fisher in particu∣lar
imputed these measures of the commons to their want
of faith; and to a formed design, derived from heretical
and Lutheran principles, of robbing the church of her
patrimony, and overturning the national religion. The
duke of Norfolk reproved the prelate, in very severe, and
even somewhat indecent terms. He told him, that the
greatest clerks were not always the wisest men. But
Fisher replied, that he did not remember any fools in his
time, that had proved great clerks. The exceptions
taken at the bishop of Rochester's speech stopped not
there. The commons, by the mouth of Sir Thomas
Audley, their speaker, made complaints to the King of
the reflections thrown upon them; and the bishop was
<PB N="106" REF="114"/>
obliged to put a more favourable construction on his
words<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary History, vol. iii. p. 59. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY was not displeased, that the court of Rome
and the clergy should be sensible, that they were entirely
dependant on him, and that his Parliament, if he were
willing to second their inclinations, were sufficiently dis∣posed
to reduce the power and privileges of the ecclesi∣astics.
The commons gratified the King in another par∣ticular
of moment: They granted him a discharge of all
those debts, which he had contracted since the beginning
of his reign: And they grounded this bill, which occa∣sioned
many complaints, on a pretence of the King's
great care of the nation, and of his employing regularly
all the money, which he had borrowed, in the public
service. Most of the King's creditors consisted of friends
to the cardinal, who had been engaged by their patron to
contribute to the supply of Henry's demands; and the
present courtiers were well pleased to take the opportu∣nity
of mulcting them<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 83.</NOTE>. Several also approved of an
expedient,
which, they hoped, would ever after discredit
a method of supply, so irregular and so unparliamentary.</P>
<P>THE domestic transactions of England were at present
so interesting to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign affairs.</NOTE> that they chiefly engaged his
attention; and he regarded foreign affairs only in subor∣dination
to them. He had declared war against the em∣peror;
but the mutual advantages reaped by the com∣merce
between England and the Netherlands had engaged
him to stipulate a neutrality with those provinces; and
except by money contributed to the Italian wars, he had
in effect exercised no hostilities against any of the impe∣rial
dominions. A general peace was this summer esta∣blished
in Europe. Margaret of Austria and Louise of
Savoy met at Cambray, and settled the terms of pacifica∣tion
<PB N="107" REF="115"/>
between the French King and the emperor. Charles
accepted of two millions of crowns in lieu of Burgundy;
and he delivered up the two princes of France, whom
he had retained as hostages. Henry was so generous to
his friend and ally Francis, that he sent him an acquital
of near 600,000 crowns, which that prince owed him.
Francis's Italian confederates were not so well satisfied
as the King with the peace of Cambray: They were
there almost wholly abandoned to the will of the empe∣ror;
and seemed to have no other means of security left,
but his equity and moderation. Florence, after a brave
resistance, was subdued by the imperial arms, and finally
delivered over to the dominion of the family of Medici.
The Venetians were better treated: They were only
obliged to relinquish some acquisitions, which they had
made on the coast of Naples. Even Francis Sforza
obtained the investiture of Milan, and was pardoned all
his past offences. The emperor in person passed into
Italy with a magnificent train, and received the imperial
crown from the hands of the pope at Bologna. He was
but twenty-nine years of age; and having already, by
his vigour and capacity, succeeded in every enterprize,
and reduced to captivity the two greatest potentates in
Europe, the one spiritual, the other temporal, he at∣tracted
the eyes of all men; and many prognostications
were formed of his growing empire.</P>
<P>BUT though Charles seemed to be prosperous on every
side, and the conquest of Mexico and Peru now began
to prevent that scarcity of money, under which he had
hitherto laboured, he found himself threatened with dif∣ficulties
in Germany; and his desire of remedying them
was the chief cause of his granting such moderate con∣ditions
to the powers in Italy. Sultan Solyman, the
greatest and most accomplished prince that ever sat on
<PB N="108" REF="116" MS="y"/>
the Ottoman throne, had almost entirely subdued Hun∣gary,
had besieged Vienna, and, though repulsed, still
menaced the hereditary dominions of the house of Austria
with conquest and subjection. The Lutheran princes
in the empire, finding that liberty of conscience was de∣nied
them, had combined in a league for their own
defence at Smalcalde; and because they protested against
the votes of the imperial diet, they thenceforth received
the appellation of <HI>protestants.</HI> Charles had undertaken
to reduce them to obedience; and on pretence of secur∣ing
the purity of religion, he had laid a scheme of ag∣grandizing
his own family, by extending its dominions
over all Germany.</P>
<P>THE friendship of Henry was one material circum∣stance
yet wanting to Charles, in order to render his
ambitious projects feasible; and the King was sufficiently
acquainted, that the concurrence of that prince would at
once remove all the difficulties, which lay in the way of
his divorce; that point, which had long been the object
of his most earnest wishes. But besides that the inte∣rests
of his kingdom seemed to require a confederacy
with France, his haughty spirit could not brook a friend∣ship
imposed on him by constraint; and as he had ever
been accustomed to receive courtship, submission, and
solicitation from the greatest potentates, he could ill
bear that dependance, to which this unhappy affair
seemed to have reduced him. Amidst the anxieties with
which he was agitated, he was often tempted to break
off all connexion with the court of Rome; and though
he had been educated in a superstitious reverence to the
papal authority, it is likely, that his personal experience
of the duplicity and selfish politics of Clement, had
served much to open his eyes in that particular. He
found his royal prerogative firmly established at home:
<PB N="109" REF="117"/>
He observed that his people were in general much dis∣gusted
with clerical usurpations, and disposed to reduce
the powers and privileges of the ecclesiastical order: He
knew that they had cordially taken part with him in his
prosecution of the divorce, and highly resented that un∣worthy
treatment, which, after so many services and
such devoted attachment, he had received from the court
of Rome. Anne Boleyn also could not fail, by her in∣sinuations,
to engage him into extremities with the
pope, both as it was the readiest way to her attaining
royal dignity, and as her education in the court of the
dutchess of Alençon, a princess inclined to the reformers,
had already disposed her to a belief of the new doctrines.
But notwithstanding all these inducements, Henry had
strong motives still to desire a good agreement with the
sovereign pontiff. He apprehended the danger of such
great innovations: He dreaded the reproach of heresy:
He abhorred all connexions with the Lutherans, the
chief opponents of the papal power: And having once
exerted himself with such applause, as he imagined, in
defence of the Romish communion, he was ashamed to
retract his former opinions, and betray from passion such
a palpable inconsistency. While he was agitated by these
contrary motives, an expedient was proposed, which, as
it promised a solution of all difficulties, was embraced by
him with the greatest joy and satisfaction.</P>
<P>DR. Thomas Cranmer, a fellow of Jesus-College in
Cambridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The uni∣versities consulted about the King's marriage.</NOTE> was a man remarkable in that university for
his learning, and still more, for the candour and dis∣interestedness
of his temper. He fell one evening by
accident into company with Gardiner, now secretary of
state, and Fox the King's almoner; and as the business
of the divorce became the subject of conversation, he
observed, that the readiest way either to quiet Henry's
conscience or extort the pope's consent, would be to
<PB N="108" REF="118"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="109" REF="119"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="110" REF="120"/>
consult all the universities of Europe with regard to this
controverted point: If they agreed to approve the King's
marriage with Catherine, his remorses would naturally
cease; if they condemned it, the pope would find it dif∣ficult
to resist the solicitations of so great a monarch
seconded by the opinion of all the learned men in Chris∣tendom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fox, p. 1860. 2d edit, Burnet, vol. i. p. 79. Speed, p. 769. Heylin, p. 5.</NOTE>. When the King was informed of the proposal,
he was delighted with it; and swore, with more alacrity
than delicacy, that Cranmer had got the right sow by
the ear: He sent for that divine; entered into conver∣sation
with him; conceived a high opinion of his virtue
and understanding; engaged him to write in defence of
the divorce; and immediately, in prosecution of the
scheme proposed, employed his agents to collect the
judgment of all the universities in Europe.</P>
<P>HAD the question of Henry's marriage with Catherine
been examined by the principles of sound philosophy,
exempt from superstition, it seemed not liable to much
difficulty. The natural reason, why marriage in certain
degrees is prohibited by the civil laws, and condemned
by the moral sentiments of all nations, is derived from
men's care to preserve purity of manners; while they
reflect, that if a commerce of love were authorized be∣tween
the nearest relations, the frequent opportunities of
intimate conversation, especially during early youth,
would introduce an universal dissoluteness and corruption.
But as the customs of countries vary considerably, and
open an intercourse, more or less restrained, between
different families, or between the several members of the
same family, so we find, that the moral precept, varying
with its cause, is susceptible, without any inconvenience,
of very different latitude in the several ages and nations
<PB N="111" REF="121"/>
of the world. The extreme delicacy of the Greeks,
permitted no converse between persons of the two sexes,
except where they lived under the same roof; and even
the apartments of a step-mother, and her daughters,
were almost as much shut up against visits from the
husband's sons, as against those from any strangers or
more remote relations: Hence, in that nation, it was law∣ful
for a man to marry, not only his niece, but his half
sister by the father: A liberty unknown to the Romans,
and other nations, where a more open intercourse was
authorized between the sexes. Reasoning from this
principle, it would appear, that the ordinary commerce
of life among great princes, is so obstructed by ceremony,
and numerous attendants, that no ill consequence would
result among them, from the marriage of a brother's
widow; especially if the dispensation of the sovereign
priest is previously required, in order to justify what may
in common cases be condemned, and to hinder the pre∣cedent
from becoming too common and familiar. And
as strong motives of public interest and tranquillity may
frequently require such alliances between the sovereign
families, there is less reason for extending towards them
the full rigour of that rule which has place among individuals<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Even judging of this question by the scripture, to which the appeal was every moment made, the arguments for the King's cause appear but lame and imperfect. Marriage in the degree of affinity which had place between Henry and Catherine, is, indeed, prohibited in Leviticus; but it is natural to interpret that prohibition as a part of the Jewish ceremonial or municipal law: And though it is there said, in the con∣clusion, that the gentile nations, by violating these degrees of consan∣guinity, had incurred the divine displeasure, the extension of this maxim to every precise case before specified, is supposing the scriptures to be composed with a minute accuracy and precision, to which, we know with certainty, the sacred penmen did not think proper to confine themselves. The descent of mankind from one common father, obliged them, in the first generation, to marry in the nearest degrees of consan∣guinity: Instances of a like nature occur among the patriarchs: And the marriage of a brother's widow was, in certain cases, not only per∣mitted, but even enjoined as a positive precept by the Mosaical law. It is in vain to say, that this precept was an exception to the rule; and an exception confined merely to the Jewish nation. The inference is still just, that such a marriage can contain no natural or moral turpi∣tude; otherwise God, who is the author of all purity, would never, in any case, have enjoined it.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="112" REF="124"/>
BUT in opposition to these reasons, and many more
which might be collected, Henry had custom and prac∣tice
on his side, the principle by which men are almost
wholly governed in their actions and opinions. Mar∣riages
with a brother's widow were so unusual, that no
other instance of it could be found in any history or
record of any Christian nation; and though the popes
were accustomed to dispense with more essential precepts
of morality, and even permitted marriages within other
prohibited degrees, such as those of uncle and niece, the
imaginations of men were not as yet reconciled to this
particular exercisse of his authority. Several universities
of Europe, therefore, without hesitation, as well as with∣out
interest or reward<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE>, gave verdict in the King's fa∣vour;
not only those of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1530.</NOTE> Paris, Orleans, Bourges,
Tholouse, Angiers, which might be supposed to lie under
the influence of their prince, ally to Henry; but also
those of Italy, Venice, Ferrara, Padua; even Bologna
itself, though under the immediate jurisdiction of Cle∣ment.
Oxford alone<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Wood. hist. and ant. Ox. lib. i. p. 225.</NOTE> and Cambridge<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 6.</NOTE> made some dif∣ficulty;
because these universities, alarmed with the
progress of Lutheranism, and fearing a defection from
the holy see, scrupled to give their sanction to measures,
whose consequences, they feared, would prove so fatal to
the antient <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ligion. Their opinion however, conform∣able
to that of the other universities of Europe, was at
<PB N="113" REF="125" MS="y"/>
last procured; and the King, in order to give weight to
all these authorities, engaged his nobility to write a let∣ter,
to the pope, recommending his cause to the holy fa∣ther,
and threatening him with the most dangerous con∣sequences
in case of a denial of justice<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol xiv. 405. Burnet, vol. i. p. 95.</NOTE>. The convoca∣tions
too both of Canterbury and York, pronounced the
King's marriage invalid, irregular, and contrary to the
law of God, with which no human power had authority
to dispense<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer vol. xiv. p. 454, 472.</NOTE>. But Clement, lying still under the influence
of the emperor, continued to summon the King to appear,
either by himself or proxy, before his tribunal at Rome;
and the King, who knew that he could expect no fair
trial there, refused to submit to such a condition, and
would not even admit of any citation, which he regarded
as a high insult, and a violation of his royal prerogative.
The father of Anne Boleyn, created earl of Wiltshire,
carried to the pope the King's reasons for not appearing
by proxy; and as the first instance of disrespect from
England, refused to kiss his holiness's foot, which he very
graciously held out to him for that purpose<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE extremities to which Henry was pushed, both
against the pope and the ecclesiastical order, were naturally
very disagreeable to cardinal Wolsey; and as Henry
foresaw his opposition, it is the most probable reason
which can be assigned for his continuing to prosecute
with so much rigour his ancient favourite. After Wolsey
had remained some time at Asher, he was allowed to re∣move
to Richmond, a palace which he had received as
a present from Henry, in return for Hampton-Court:
But the courtiers, dreading still his near neighbourhood
to the King, procured an order for him to remove to his
see of York. The cardinal knew it was in vain to
<PB N="114" REF="126"/>
resist: He took up his residence at Cawood in Yorkshire,
where he rendered himself extremely popular to the
neighbourhood, by his affability and hospitality<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cavendish. Stowe, p. 554.</NOTE>; but he
was not allowed to remain long unmolested in this re∣treat.
The earl of Northumberland received orders,
without regard to Wolsey's ecclesiastical character, to
arrest him for high treason, and to conduct him to Lon∣don,
in order to his trial. The cardinal, partly from the
fatigues of his journey, partly from the agitation of his
anxious mind, was seized with a disorder which turned
into a dysentery; and he was able, with some difficulty,
to reach Leicester-abbey. When the abbot and monks
advanced to receive him with much respect and cere∣mony,
he told them, that he was come to lay his bones
among them; and he immediately took his bed, whence
he never rose more.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28 Novem.</NOTE> A little before he expired, he ad∣dressed
himself in the following words to Sir William
Kingston, constable of the Tower, who had him in cus∣tody.
“I pray you, have me heartily recommended
unto his royal majesty, and beseech him on my behalf
to call to his remembrance all matters that have passed
between us frm the beginning, especially with regard
to his business with the queen; and then will he
know in his conscience whether I have offended
him.”</P>
<P>“HE is a prince of a most royal carriage, and hath a
princely heart; and rather than he will miss or want
any part of his will, he will endanger the one half
of his kingdom.”</P>
<P>“I DO assure you, that I have often kneeled before
him, sometimes three hours together, to persuade him
from his will and appetite; but could not prevail:
Had I but served God as diligently as I have served
<PB N="115" REF="127"/>
the King, he would not have given me over in my
grey hairs. But this is the just reward that I must
receive for my indulgent pains and study, not regard∣ing
my service to God, but only to my Prince.
Therefore, let me advise you, if you be one of the
privy-council, as by your wisdom you are fit, take
care what you put into the King's head: For you
can never put it out again<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Cavendish.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THUS died this famous cardinal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wolsey's death.</NOTE> whose character
seems to have contained as singular a variety as the for∣tune
to which he was exposed. The obstinacy and
violence of the King's temper may alleviate much of the
blame which some of his favourite's measures have under∣gone;
and when we consider, that the subsequent part
of Henry's reign was much more unfortunate and criminal
than that which was directed by Wolsey's councils, we
shall be inclined to suspect of partiality those historians,
who have endeavoured to load the memory of this fa∣vourite
with such violent reproaches. If in foreign po∣litics,
he sometimes employed his influence over the
King for his private purposes, rather than his master's
interest, which, he boasted, he had solely at heart; we
must remember, that he had in view the papal throne;
a dignity, which, had he attained it, would have enabled
him to make Henry a suitable return for all his favours.
The cardinal d'Amboise, whose memory is precious in
France, always made this apology for his own conduct,
which was, in some respect, similar to Wolsey's; and
we have reason to think, that Henry was well acquainted
with the motives by which his minister was influenced.
He regretted very much his death, when informed of it;
and always spoke favourably of his memory: A proof,
that humour more than reason, or any discovery of
<PB N="116" REF="128"/>
treachery, had occasioned his last persecutions against
him.</P>
<P>A NEW session of parliament was held,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1531. 16 January. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> together with
a convocation; and the King gave strong proofs of his
extensive authority, as well as of his intention to employ
it to the depression of the Clergy. As an antient statute,
now almost obsolete, had been made use of to ruin Wol∣sey,
and render his exercise of the legatine power
criminal, notwithstanding the Kng's permission; the
same law was now turned against the ecclesiastics. It
was pretended, that every one who had submitted to the
legatine authority, that is, the whole church, had vio∣lated
the statute of provisors; and the attorney-general
brought accordingly an indictment against them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Brit. Eccles. p. 325. Burnet, vol. i. p. 106.</NOTE>. The
convocation knew that it would be in vain to oppose
reason or equity to the King's arbitrary will, or plead
that their ruin would have been the certain consequence
of not submitting to Wolsey's commission, which was
procured by Henry's consent, and supported by his au∣thority.
They chose therefore to throw themselves on
the mercy of their sovereign; and they agreed to pay
118, 840 l. for their pardon<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 923.</NOTE>. A confession was likewise
extorted from them, that <HI>the King was the protector and
the supreme head of the church and clergy of England;</HI>
though some of them had the dexterity to get a clause
inserted, which invalidated the whole submission, and
which ran in these terms, <HI>in so far as is permitted by
the law of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>THE commons, finding that a pardon was granted the
clergy, began to be apprehensive for themselves, lest
either they should afterwards be brought into trouble,
<PB N="117" REF="129"/>
on account of their submission to the legatine court, or
a supply be extorted from them, in return for their par∣don.
They therefore petitioned the King, to grant a
remission to his lay subjects; but met with a repulse.
He told them, that, if he ever pleased to forgive their
offence, it would be from his own goodness, not from
their application, lest he should seem to be compelled to
it. Some time after, when they despaired of obtaining
this concession, he was pleased to issue a pardon to the
laity; and the commons expressed great gratitude for
this act of clemency<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hall's chronicle. Hollingshed, p. 923. Baker, p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY the strict execution of the statute of provisors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1532.</NOTE> a
great part of the profit, and still more of the power, of
the court of Rome was cut off; and the connexions be∣tween
the pope and the English clergy were, in some
measure, dissolved. The next session found both King
and Parliament in the same dispositions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 January.</NOTE> An act was
passed against levying the annates or first fruits<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. Collect. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 41. Strype, vol. i. p. 144.</NOTE>; being
a year's rent of all the bishoprics that fell vacant: A tax
which was imposed by the court of Rome for granting
bulls to the new prelates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the resor∣mation.</NOTE> and which was found to
amount to considerable sums. Since the second of
Henry the seventh, no less than one hundred and sixty
thousand pounds had been transmitted to Rome, on ac∣count
of this claim; which the Parliament, therefore,
reduced to five per cent. of all the episcopal benefices.
The better to keep the pope in awe, the King was en∣trusted
with a power of regulating these payments, and
of confirming or inf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inging this act at his pleasure:
And it was voted, that any censures which should be
passed by the court of Rome, on account of that law,
should be entirely disregarded, and that mass should be
<PB N="118" REF="130"/>
said, and the sacraments administered, as if no such cen∣sures
had been issued.</P>
<P>THIS session the commons preferred to the King, a
long complaint against the abuses and oppressions of the
ecclesiastical courts; and they were proceeding to enact
laws for remedying them, when a difference arose, which
put an end to the session, before the Parliament had
finished all their business. It was become a custom for
men to make such settlements, or trust deeds, of their
land by will, that they defrauded, not only the King,
but all other lords, of their wards, marriages, and re∣liefs;
and by the same artifice the King was deprived of
his primier seisin, and the profits of the livery, which
were no inconsiderable branches of the revenue. Henry
made a bill be drawn to moderate, not remedy altogether,
this abuse: He was contented, that every man should
have the liberty of disposing in this manner of the half of
his land; and he told the Parliament in plain terms,
“If they would not take a reasonable thing, when it
was offered, he would search out the extremity of the
law; and then would not offer them so much again.”
The lords came willingly into his terms; but the com∣mons
rejected the bill: A singular instance, where Henry
might see, that his power and authority, tho' extensive,
had yet some boundaries. The commons, however,
sound reason to repent of their victory. The King
made good his threats: He called together the judges
and ablest lawyers, who argued the question in chan∣cery;
and it was decided, that a man could not by
law bequeath any part of his lands, in prejudice of his
heir<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 116. Hall. Parlimentary history.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament being again assembled after a short
prorogation, the King caused the two oaths to be read
<PB N="119" REF="131"/>
to them, that which the bishops took to the pope,
and that to the King, on their installation; and as a
contradiction might be suspected between them, while
the prelates seemed to swear allegiance to two sove∣reigns<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 123, 124.</NOTE>, the Parliament shewed their intention of a∣bolishing
the oath to the pope, when their proceedings
were suddenly stopped by the breaking out of the plague
at Westminster, which occasioned a prorogation. It is
remarkable, that one Temse ventured this session to
move, that the House should address the King, to take
back the queen, and stop the prosecution of his divorce.
This motion occasioned the King to send for Audley,
the Speaker; and to explain to him the scruples with
which his conscience had so long been agitated; scruples,
he said, which had proceeded from no wanton appetite,
which had arisen after the fervours of youth were past,
and which were confirmed by the concur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing senti∣ments
of all the learned societies in Europe. Except
in Spain and Portugal, he added, it was never heard of,
that any man had espoused two sisters; but he himself
had the misfortune, he believed, to be the first christian
man who had ever married his brother's widow<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the prorogation, Sir Thomas More, the chan∣cellor,
foreseeing that all the measures of the King and
Parliament tended to a breach with the church of Rome,
and to an alteration of religion, which his principles
would not permit him to concur with, desired leave to
resign the seals; and he descended from this high station
with more joy and alacrity than he had mounted up to
it. The austerity of this man's virtue, and the sanctity
of his manners, had nowise encroached on the gentleness
of his temper, nor even diminished that frolic and gaity
<PB N="120" REF="132"/>
to which he was naturally inclined. He sported with
all the varieties of fortune into which he was thrown;
and neither the pride naturally attending a high station,
nor the melancholy incident to poverty and retreat, could
ever lay hold of his serene and equal spirit. While his
family discovered symptoms of sorrow on laying down
the grandeur and magnificence to which they had been
accustomed, he drew a subject of mirth from their dis∣tresses;
and made them ashamed of losing even a mo∣ment's
chearfulness, on account of such trivial misfor∣tunes.
The King, who had entertained a high opinion
of his virtue, admitted his resignation with some dif∣ficulty;
and he bestowed the seals soon after on Sir
Thomas Audley.</P>
<P>DURING these transactions in England, and these in∣vasions
of the papal and ecclesiastical authority, the court
of Rome were not without solicitude; and they enter∣tained
very just apprehensions of losing entirely their
authority in England; the kingdom, which, of all others,
had long been most devoted to the holy see, and which
had yielded it the most ample revenue. While the im∣perial
cardinals pushed Clement to proceed to extremi∣ties
against the King, his more moderate and impartial
counsellers represented to him the indignity of his pro∣ceedings;
that a great monarch, who had signalized
himself, both by his pen and his sword, in the pope's
cause, should be denied a favour, which he demanded on
such just grounds, and which had scarce ever before been
refused to any person of his rank and station. Notwith∣standing
these remonstrances, the Queen's appeal was
received at Rome; the King was cited to appear; and
several consistories were held, to examine the validity of
their marriage. Henry was determined not to send any
proxy to plead his cause before this court: He only
dispatched Sir Edward Karne and Dr. Bonner, in quality
<PB N="121" REF="133"/>
excusators, so they were called, to carry his apology,
for not paying that deference to the papal authority.
The prerogatives of his crown, he said, must be sacri∣ficed,
if he allowed of appeals from his own kingdom;
and as the question regarded conscience, not power or
interest, no proxy could supply his place, or convey that
satisfaction which the dictates of his own mind could
alone conser.<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 October.</NOTE> In order to support himself in this mea∣sure,
and add greater security to his defection from
Rome, he procured an interview with Francis at Bou∣logne
and Calais, where he renewed his personal friend∣ship,
as well as public alliance, with that monarch, and
concerted all measures for their mutual defence. He
even employed arguments, by which, he believed, he
had persuaded Francis to imitate his example in with∣drawing
his obedience from the bishop of Rome, and
administering ecclesiastical affairs without having farther
recourse to that see. And being now fully determined
in his own mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Novem.</NOTE> as well as resolute to stand all conse∣quences,
he privately celebrated his marriage with Anne
Boleyn, whom he had created marchioness of Pembroke.
Rouland Lee, soon after raised to the bishopric of Co∣ventry,
officiated at the marriage. The duke of Norfolk,
uncle to the new Queen, her father, mother, and bro∣ther,
together with Dr. Cranmer, were present at the
ceremony<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 340, 341.</NOTE>. Anne became pregnant soon after her mar∣riage;
and this event, both gave great joy to the King,
and was regarded by the people as a strong proof of the
Queen's former modesty and virtue.</P>
<P>THE Parliament was again assembled; and Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1533.</NOTE> in
conjunction with the great council of the nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 February. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> pro∣ceeded
still in those gradual and secure steps, by which
<PB N="122" REF="134"/>
they loosened their connexions with the see of Rome,
and repressed the usurpations of the Roman pontiff. An
act was made against all appeals to Rome in causes
of matrimony, divorces, wills, and other suits cognizable in
ecclesiastical courts; appeals esteemed dishonourable to
the kingdom, by subjecting it to a foreign jurisdiction;
and found to be infinitely vexatious, by the expence and
the delay of justice, which, necessarily attended them<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">24 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</NOTE>.
The more to shew his disregard to the pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 April.</NOTE> Henry, finding the new Queen's pregnancy to advance, publicly
owned his marriage; and in order to remove all doubts
with regard to its lawfulness, he prepared measures for
declaring, by a formal sentence, the invalidity of his
former marriage with Catherine: A sentence which
ought naturally to have preceded his espousals of Anne<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 31. and Records, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, notwithstanding his scruples and remorses
on account of his first marriage, had always treated
Catherine with respect and distinction; and he endea∣voured,
by every soft and persuasive art, to engage her
to depart from her appeal to Rome, and her opposition
to his divorce. Finding her obstinate in maintaining
the justice of her cause, he had totally forborne all visits
and intercourse with her; and had desired her to make
choice of any one of his palaces in which she should
please to reside. She had fixed her court for some time
at Amphill near Dunstable; and it was in this latter
town that Cranmer, now created archbishop of Can∣terbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 May.</NOTE>
on the death of Warham<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Bishop Burnet has given us an account of the number of bulls re∣quisite for Cranmer's installation By one bull, directed to the King, he is, upon the royal nomination, made archbishop of Canterbury. By a second, directed to himself, he is made archbishop. By a third, he is absolved from all censures. A fourth, is to the suffragans, requiring them to receive and acknowledge him as archbishop. A fifth to the dean and chapter, to the same purpose. A sixth to the clergy of Canterbury. A seventh to all the laity in his see. An eighth to all that held lands of it. By a ninth he was ordained to be consecrated, taking the oath that was in the pontifical. By a tenth bull the pall was sent him. By an eleventh, the archbishop of York, and the bishop of Lon∣don, were required to put it on him. These were so many artifices to draw fees to offices, which the popes had erected, and disposed of for money. It may be worth observing, that Cranmer, before he took the oath to the pope, made a protestation, that he did not intend thereby to restrain himself from any thing that he was bound to, either by his duty to God, the King, or the country; and that he renounced every thing in it that was contrary to any of these. This device was the invention of some casuist, and not very compatible with that strict sincerity, and that scrupulous conscience, of which Cranmer made pro∣fession. Ccllier, vol. ii. in Coll. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 22. Burnet, vol. i. p. 128, 129.</NOTE>, was appointed to
<PB N="123" REF="135"/>
open his court for examining the validity of her marriage,
The near neighbourhood of the place was chosen in
order to deprive her of all plea of ignorance; and as
she made no answer to the citation, neither by herself
nor proxy, she was declared <HI>contumacious;</HI> and the pri∣mate
proceeded to the examination of the cause. The
evidences of Arthur's consummation of the marriage were
produced; the opinions of the universities were read;
together with the judgment pronounced two years before
by the convocations both of Canterbury and York; and
after these preparatory steps, Cranmer proceeded to a
sentence, and annulled the King's marriage with Ca∣therine
as unlawful and invalid. By a subsequent sen∣tence,
he ratified the marriage with Anne Boleyn, who
soon after was publicly crowned Queen, with all the
pomp and dignity suited to that ceremony<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 6.</NOTE>. To com∣plete
the King's satisfaction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 Sept.</NOTE> on the conclusion of this
intricate and vexatious affair, she was safely delivered
<PB N="124" REF="136"/>
of a daughter, who received the name of Elizabeth, and
who afterwards swayed the scepter with such renown
and felicity. Henry was so much delighted with the
birth of this child, that soon after he conferred on her
the title of princess of Wales<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 134.</NOTE>; a step somewhat ire∣gular,
as she was only presumptive, not apparent heir
of the crown. But he had, during his former marriage,
thought proper to honour his daughter Mary with that
title; and he was determined to bestow on the offspring
of his present marriage, the same marks of distinction, as
well as exclude Mary from all hopes of the succession.
His regard for the new Queen seemed rather to increase
than diminish by his marriage; and all men expected
to see the entire ascendant of one who had mounted a
throne, from which her birth had set her at so great a
distance, and who, by a proper mixture of severity and
indulgence, had long managed so intractable a spirit as
that of Henry. In order to efface, as much as possible,
all marks of his first marriage, Lord Mountjoy was sent
to the unfortunate and divorced Queen, to inform her,
that she was henceforth to be treated only as princess-dowager
of Wales; and all means were employed to
make her acquicsce in that determination. But she
continued obstinate in maintaining the validity of her
marriage; and she would admit of no service from any
person, who did not approach her with the accustomed
ceremonial. Henry, forgetting his wonted generosity
towards her, employed menaces against such of her
servants as complied with her commands in this par∣ticular;
but was never able to make her relinquish her
title and pretensions<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 326. Burnet, vol. i. p. 132.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN intelligence was conveyed to Rome of these
transactions, so injurious to the authority and reputation
<PB N="125" REF="137"/>
of the holy see, the conclave were in a rage, and all the
cardinals of the imperial faction urged the pope to pro∣ceed
to a definitive sentence, and to emit his spiritual
thunders against Henry. But Clement proceeded no
farther than to declare the nullity of Cranmer's sentence,
as well as that of Henry's second marriage; threatening
him with excommunication, if, before the first of No∣vember
ensuing, he did not replace every thing in the
condition, in which they formerly stood<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 566.</NOTE>. An event had happened, from which the pontiff expected a more amicable conclusion of the difference, and which hindered him from carrying matters to extremity against the King.
THE pope had claims upon the dutchy of Ferrara for the sovereignty of Reggio and Modena<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 133. Guicciardini.</NOTE>; and having
submitted his pretensions to the arbitration of the em∣peror,
he was surprized to find a sentence pronounced
against him. Enraged at this disappointment, he heark∣ened
to proposals of amity from Francis; and when that
monarch made overtures of marrying the duke of Orleans,
his second son, with Catherine of Medici, niece to the
pope, Clement gladly embraced an alliance, by which
his family was so much honoured. An interview was
even appointed of the pope and French King at Marseil∣les;
and Francis, as a common friend, employed his
good offices in mediating an agreement between his new
ally and the King of England.</P>
<P>HAD this connexion of France with the see of Rome
taken place a few years sooner, there had been little dif∣ficulty
in composing the quarrel with Henry. The
Kind's request was an ordinary one; and the same ple∣nary
power of the pope, which had granted a dispen∣sation
<PB N="126" REF="138"/>
for his espousing Catherine, could easily have an∣nulled
the marriage. But in the progress of the quarrel,
the state of affairs was much changed on both sides.
Henry had shaken off much of that reverence with which
he had been early imbued for the apostolical see; and
finding, that his subjects of all ranks had taken part with
him, and willingly complied with his movements for
breaking foreign dependance, he had taken a relish for
his spiritual authority, and would scarce, it was appre∣hended,
be induced to renew his submissions to the
Roman pontiff. The pope, on the other hand, ran
now a manifest risque of infringing his authority by a
compliance with the King; and as a sentence of divorce
could no longer be rested on nullities in Julius's bull,
but would be construed as an acknowledgment of papal
usurpations, it was foreseen, that the Lutherans would
thence take occasion of triumph, and would persevere
more obstinately in their present principles. But not∣withstanding
these obstacles, Francis did not despair of
mediating an agreement. He still observed that the King
had some remains of prejudice in favour of the apostolic see,
and was apprehensive of the consequences, which
might ensue from too violent innovations. He saw
plainly the interest, that Clement had in preserving the
obedience of England, which was one of the richest
jewels in the papal crown. And he hoped, that these
motives on both sides Would facilitate a mutual agree∣ment,
and would forward the effects of his good of∣fices.</P>
<P>FRANCIS first prevailed on the pope to promise, that,
if the King would send a proxy to Rome, and thereby
submit his cause to the holy see, he would appoint com∣missioners
to meet at Cambray, and form the process;
and he would immediately afterwards pronounce the
sentence of divorce, required of him. Bellay, bishop of
<PB N="127" REF="139"/>
Paris, was next dispatched to London, and obtained a
promise of the King, that he would submit his cause to
the Roman consistory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1534.</NOTE> provided the cardinals of the im∣perial
faction were excluded from it. The prelate car∣ried
this verbal promise to Rome; and the pope agreed,
that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's final breach with Rome.</NOTE> if the King would sign a written agreement to the
same purpose, his demands should be fully cornplied
with. A day was appointed for the return of the mes∣sengers;
and all the world regarded this affair, which
had threatened a violent rupture between England and
the Romish church, as drawing towards an amicable
conclusion<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.
But the greatest affairs often depend on
the most frivolous incidents. The courier, who carried
the King's written promise, was detained beyond the day
appointed: News were brought to Rome that a libel had
been published in England against the court of Rome,
and a farce acted before the King in derision of the pope
and cardinals<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d March.</NOTE> The pope and cardinals entered into
the consistory enflamed with anger; and by a precipitate
sentence, the marriage of Henry and Catherine was pro∣nounced
valid, and Henry declared to be excommuni∣cated
if he refused to adhere to it. Two days after, the
courier arrived; and Clement, who had been hurried
from his usual prudence, found, that, tho' he repented
heartily of this hasty measure, it would be difficult for
him to retract it, or replace affairs on the same footing
as before.</P>
<P>IT is not probable, that the pope, had he conducted
himself with ever so great moderation and temper, could
hope, during the life-time of Henry, to have regained
much authority or influence in England. That mo∣narch
was both impetuous and obstinate in his cha∣racter;
and having proceeded so far in throwing
<PB N="128" REF="140"/>
off the papal yoke, he never could again have been in∣duced
tamely to bend his neck to it. Even at the time,
when he was negotiating a reconcilement with Rome,
he either entertained so little hopes of success,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 January.</NOTE> or was
so indifferent about the event,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> that he had assembled a
Parliament; and continued to enact laws totally destruc∣tive
of the papal authority. The people had been pre∣pared
by degrees for this great innovation. Each pre∣ceding
session had retrenched something from the power
and profit of the pontiff. Care had been taken, during
some years, to teach the nation, that a general council
was much superior to the pope. But now a bishop
preached every Sunday at Paul's Cross, in order to in∣culcate
the doctrine, that the pope was intitled to no
authority at all beyond the bounds of his own diocese<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 144.</NOTE>.
The proceedings of the Parliament showed that they
had entirely adopted this opinion; and there is reason to
believe, that the King, after having procured a favour∣able
sentence from Rome, which would have removed
all the doubts with regard to his second marriage and
the succession, might indeed have lived on terms of ci∣vility
with the apostolic see, but never would have sur∣rendered
to it any considerable share of his assumed
prerogative. The importance of the laws, passed this
session, even before news arrived of the violent reso∣lutions
taken at Rome, is sufficient to justify this
opinion.</P>
<P>ALL payments made to the apostolic chamber; all
provisions, bulls, dispensations, were abolished: Monas∣teries
were subjected to the visitation and government
of the King alone: The law for punishing heretics was
moderated; the ordinary was prohibited to imprison or
try any person upon suspicion alone, without present∣ment
<PB N="129" REF="141"/>
by two lawful witnesses; and it was declared,
that to speak against the pope's authority was no heresy:
Bishops were to be appointed, by a <HI>congè d'elire</HI> from
the crown, or in ease of the dean and chapter's refusal,
by letters patent; and no recourse was to be had to
Rome for palls, bulls, or provisions: Campeggio and
Ghinucci, two Italians, were deprived of the bishoprics
of Salisbury and Worcester, which they had hitherto
enjoyed<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Le Neve's Fasti Eccles. Angl.</NOTE>: The law which had been formerly made
against paying annates or first fruits, but which had been
left in the King's power to suspend or enforce, was
finally established: And a submission, which was exacted
two years before from the clergy, and which had been
obtained with great difficulty, received this session the
sanction of Parliament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">25. H. 8. c. 19.</NOTE>. In this submission, the clergy
acknowledge, that convocations ought only to be as∣sembled
by the King's authority; they promise to enact
no new canons without his consent; and they agree,
that he should appoint thirty-two commissioners, in order
to examine the old canons, and abrogate such as should
be found prejudicial to his royal prerogative<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 69, 70.</NOTE>. An ap∣peal
was also allowed from the bishop's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourt to the
King in Chancery.</P>
<P>BUT the most important law passed this session, was
that which regulated the succession to the crown: The
marriage of the King with Catherine was declared un∣lawful,
void, and of no effect: The primate's sentence,
annulling it, was ratified: And the marriage with Queen
Anne was established and confirmed. The crown was
appointed to descend to the issue of that marriage, and
failing them to the King's heirs for ever. An oath like∣wise
was ordered to be taken in favour of this succession,
<PB N="130" REF="142"/>
under the penalty of imprisonment during the King's
pleasure, and forfeiture of goods and chattels. And all
slander against the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30 March.</NOTE> Queen, or their issue, was
subjected to the penalty of misprision of treason. After
these compliances, the Parliament was prorogued; and
those acts, so contemptuous towards the pope, and so
destructive of his authority, were passed at the very time
that Clement pronounced his hasty sentence against the
King. Henry's resentment against Queen Catherine, on
account of her obstinacy, was the reason why he exclud∣ed
her daughter from all hopes of Succeeding to the
crown; contrary to his first intention, when he began
the suit of divorce, and of dispensation for a second
marriage.</P>
<P>THE King found his ecclesiastical subjects as com∣pliant
as the laity. The convocation ordered, that the
act against appeals to Rome, together with the King's
appeal from the pope to a general council, should be af∣fixed
to the doors of all the churches in the kingdom:
And they voted, that the bishop of Rome had, by the law
of God, no more jurisdiction in England than any other
foreign bishop; and that the authority, which he and
his predecessors had exercised there, was only by usur∣pation
and the sufferance of English princes. Four per∣sons
only opposed this vote in the lower house, and one
doubted. It passed unanimously in the upper. The
bishops went so far in their complaisance, that they took
out new commissions from the crown, where all their
spiritual and episcopal authority was expressly affirmed
to be derived ultimately from the civil magistrate, and
to be entirely dependent on his good pleasure<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Collier's Eccl. hist. vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE oath regarding the succession was generally sworn
throughout the kingdom. Fisher, bishop of Rochester,
<PB N="131" REF="143"/>
and Sir Thomas More, were the only persons of note,
who entertained scruples with regard to its legality.
Fisher was obnoxious on account of some practices, into
which his credulity, rather than any bad intentions,
seems to have betrayed him. But More was the person
of greatest reputation in the kingdom for virtue and
integrity; and as it was believed, that his authority
would have influence on the sentiments of others, great
pains were taken to convince him of the lawfulness of
the oath. He declared, that he had no scruple with re∣gard
to the succession, and thought that the Parliament
had full power to settle it: He offered to draw an
oath himself, which would assure his allegiance to the
heir appointed; but he refused the oath prescribed by
law; because the preamble of that oath asserted the
legality of the King's marriage with Anne, and thereby
implied, that his former marriage with Catherine was
unlawful and invalid. Cranmer, the primate, and
Cromwel, now secretary of state, who highly loved and
esteemed More, earnestly solicited him to lay aside his
scruples; and their friendly entreaties seemed to weight
more with him, than all the penalties attending his
refusal<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 156.</NOTE>. He persisted however, in a mild, though firm
manner, to maintain his resolution; and the King, irri∣tated
against him as well as Fisher, ordered them both
to be indicted upon the statute, and committed prisoners
to the Tower.</P>
<P>THE Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Novem∣ber.</NOTE> being again assembled, conferred
on the King the title or the only supreme <HI>head</HI> on earth
of the church of England; as they had already invested
him with all the real power belonging to it. In this
memorable act, the Parliament granted him power, or
<PB N="132" REF="144"/>
rather acknowledged his inherent power, “to visit, and
repress, redress, reform, order, correct, restrain, or
amend all errors, heresics, abuses, offences, contempts
and enormities, which fell under any spiritual autho∣rity
or jurisdiction<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">26 H. 8. c. 1.</NOTE>.” They also declared it treason
to attempt, imagine, or speak evil against the King,
Queen, or his heirs, or to endeavour the depriving them
of their dignities or titles. They gave him a right to all
the annates and tythes of benefices, which had formerly
been paid to the court of Rome. They granted him a
subsidy and a fifteenth. They attainted More and Fisher
for misprision of treason. And they compleated the
union of England and Wales, by giving to that princi∣pality
all the benefit of the English laws.</P>
<P>THUS the authority of the popes, like all exorbitant
power, was ruined by the excess of its acquisitions, and
by stretching its pretensions beyond what it was possible
for any human principles or prepossessions to sustain.
The right of granting indulgences had in former ages
contributed extremely to enrich the holy see; but being
openly abused, they served to exite the first commotions
and oppositions in Germany. The prerogative of grant∣ing
dispensations had also contributed much to attach
all the sovereign princes and great families in Europe to
the papal authority; but meeting with an unlucky con∣currence
of circumstances, was now the cause, why
England separated herself from the Romish communion.
The acknowledgment of the King's supremacy introduced
there a greater simplicity into the government, by uniting
the spiritual with the civil power, and preventing dis∣putes
about limits, which never could be exactly deter∣mined
between the contending parties. A way was also
prepared for checking the exorbitancy of superstition, and
<PB N="133" REF="145"/>
breaking those shackles, by which all human reason, po∣licy
and industry had so long been incumbered. The
prince, it may be supposed, being head of the religion,
as well as of the temporal jurisdiction of the kingdom,
though he might sometimes employ the former as an en∣gine
of government, had no interest, like the Roman
pontiff, in nourishing its excessive growth; and, except
when blinded by ignorance or bigotry, would be sure to
retain it within tolerable limits, and prevent its abuses.
And on the whole, there followed from these revolutions
very beneficial consequences; though perhaps neither
foreseen nor intended by the persons who had the chief
hand in conducting them.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry proceeded with so much order and
tranquillity in hanging the antient religion, and while
his authority seemed entirely secure in England, he was
held in some inquietude by the state of affairs in Ireland
and in Scotland.</P>
<P>THE earl of Kildare was deputy of Ireland, under
the duke of Richmond, the King's natural son, who bore
the title of lieutenant; and as Kildare was accused of
some violences against the family of Ossory, his heredi∣tary
enemy, he was called over to answer for his con∣duct.
He left his authority in the hands of his son, who
hearing that his father was thrown into prison, and
was in danger of his life, immediately took up arms,
and joining himself to Oneale, Ocarrol, and other
Irish nobility, committed many ravages, murdered Al∣len,
archbishop of Dublin, and laid siege to that
city, Old Kildare mean-while died in prison, and
his son, persevering in his revolt, made applications
to the emperor, who promised him assistance. The
King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obliged to send over some forces to Ire∣land,
which so harrassed the rebels, that Kildare, find∣ing
<PB N="134" REF="146"/>
the emperor backward in fulfilling his promises,
was reduced to the necessity of surrendering himself
prisoner to Lord Leonard Gray, the new deputy, brother
to the marquis of Dorset. He was sent over to Eng∣land,
together with his five uncles; and after trial
and conviction, they were all brought to public jus∣tice;
though two of the uncles, in order to save the
family, had pretended to join the King's party.</P>
<P>THE earl of Angus had acquired the entire ascend∣ant
in Scotland, and having got possession of the King's
person, then in early youth, he was able, by means
of that advantage, and by employing the power of
his own family, to retain the reins of government.
The queen-dowager, however, his spouse, bred him
great dissurbance: For having separated herself from
him, on account of some jealousies and disgusts, and
having procured a divorce, she had married another man
of quality, of the name of Stuart; and she joined all the
discontented nobility, who opposed Angus's authority.
James himself was dissatisfied with the slavery, to
which he was reduced; and by secret correspondence,
he excited first Walter Scot, then the earl of Lenox,
to attempt, by force of arms, to free him from the
hands of Angus. Both enterprizes failed of success;
but James, impatient of restraint, found means at last
of flying to Stirling, where his mother then resided;
and having summoned all the nobility to attend him,
he overturned the authority of the Douglasses, and
obliged Angus and his brother to fly into England,
where they were protected by Henry. The King
of Scotland, being now arrived at years of majority,
took the government into his own hands; and em∣ployed
himself with great spirit and valour, in repressing
those feuds, ravages, and disorders, which, though they
disturbed the course of public justice, served to support
<PB N="135" REF="147"/>
the martial spirit of the Scots, and contributed, by that
means, to maintain national independancy. He was de∣sirous
of renewing the antient league with the French
nation; but finding Francis in close union with Eng∣land,
and on that account somewhat cold in hearkening
to his proposals, he received the more favourably the ad∣vances
of the emperor, who hoped, by means of such an
ally, to breed disturbance to England. He offered the
Scots King the choice of three princesses, his near rela∣tions,
and all of the name of Mary; his sister the dowa∣ger
of Hungary, his niece a daughter of Portugal, or his
cousin the daughter of Henry, whom he pretended to
dispose of unknown to her father. James was more in∣clined
to the latter proposal, had it not, upon reflection,
been found impracticable; and his natural propensity to
France at last prevailed over all other considerations.
The alliance with Francis necessarily engaged James to
agree to terms of peace with England. But though in∣vited
by his uncle, Henry, to confer with him at New∣castle,
and concert common measures for repressing the
ecclesiastics in both kingdoms, and shaking off the yoke
of Rome, he could not be prevailed with to put himself
in the King's power. In order to have a pretext for re∣fusing
the conference, he applied to the pope, and ob∣tained
a brief, forbidding him to engage in any personal
negotiations with an enemy of the holy see. By these
measures, Henry easily concluded, that he could very
little depend on the friendship of his nephew. But those
events took not place till some time after our present
period.</P>

<P>THE antient and almost uninterrupted opposition of
interest between the laity and clergy in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXI.</NOTE>
and between the English clergy and the court of Rome,
had sufficiently prepared the nation for a breach with the
Roman pontiff;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religious principles of the people.</NOTE> and men had penetration enough to
discover abuses, which were plainly calculated for the
temporal advantages of the hierarchy, and which they
found destructive of their own. These subjects seemed
proportioned to human understanding; and even the
people, who felt the power of interest in their own
breasts, could perceive the purpose of those numerous
inventions, which the interested spirit of the sovereign
had introduced into religion. But when the
<PB N="137" REF="149"/>
reformers proceeded thence to dispute concerning the
nature of the sacraments, the operations of grace, the
terms of acceptance with the Deity, men were thrown
into amazement, and were, during some time, at a loss
how to chuse their party. The profound ignorance,
in which both the clergy and laity formerly lived, and
their freedom from theological altercations, had pro∣duced
a sincere, but indolent acquiescence in received
opinions; and the multitude were neither attached to
them by topics of reasoning, nor by those prejudices
and antipathies against opponents, which have ever a
more natural and powerful influence over them. As
soon as a new opinion therefore was advanced, sup∣ported
by such an authority as to call up their at∣tention,
they felt their capacity totally unfitted for such
disquisitions; and they perpetually fluctuated between
the contending parties. Hence the sudden and vio∣lent
movements by which the people were agitated,
even in the most opposite directions: Hence their seem∣ing
prostitution in sacrificing to present power the
most sacred principles: And hence the rapid progress
during some time, and the sudden as well as entire
check given afterwards to the new doctrines. When
men were once settled in their particular sects, and
had fortified themselves in an habitual detestation a∣gainst
those esteemed heretics, they adhered with more
obstinacy to the principles of their education; and the
limits of the two religions remained thenceforth fixed and
unchangeable.</P>
<P>NOTHING forwarded more the first progress of the
reformers, than the offer, which they made, of sub∣mitting
all religious doctrines to private judgment,
and the summons given every one to examine the
principles formerly imposed upon him. Though the
multitude were totally unqualified for this undertaking,
<PB N="136" REF="150"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="137" REF="151"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="138" REF="152"/>
they yet were highly pleased with it. They fancied
that they were exercising their judgment, while they
opposed to the prejudices of antient authority more
powerful prejudices of another kind. The novelty it∣self
of the doctrines; the pleasure of an imaginary
triumph in dispute; the servent zeal of the reformed
preachers; their patience, and even alacrity, in suffering
persecution, death, and torments; a disgust against the
restraints of the old religion; an indignation against
the tyranny and interested spirit of the ecclesiastics;
these motives were prevalent with the people, and by
such considerations were men so generally induced
during that age, to throw off the religion of their
ancestors.</P>
<P>BUT in proportion as the practice of submitting reli∣gion
to private judgment was acceptable to the people,
it appeared in some respects, dangerous to the rights of
sovereigns, and seemed to destroy that implicit obedience
on which the authority of the civil magistrate is chiefly
founded. The very precedent of shaking such an an∣tient
and deep founded establishment as that of the Ro∣man
hierarchy might, it was apprehended, prepare
the way for other innovations. The republican spirit,
which naturally took place among the reformers, in∣creased
this jealousy. The furious insurrections of the
populace, excited by Muncer and other anabaptists in
Germany<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 4. &amp; 5.</NOTE>, furnished a new pretence for decrying the
reformation. Nor ought we to conclude, because Pro∣testants
in our time prove as dutiful subjects as those of
any other religion, that therefore such apprehensions
were altogether without any appearance or plausibility.
Though the liberty of private judgment be tendered to
the disciples of the reformation, it is not in reality ac∣cepted
<PB N="139" REF="153"/>
of; and men are generally contented to acquiesce
in those establishments, however new, into which their
early education has thrown them.</P>
<P>NO prince in Europe was possessed of such absolute
authority as Henry, not even the pope himself, in his own
capital, where he united both the civil and ecclesiastical
powers<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Here are the terms in which the King's minister expressed himself to the pope. An non, inquam, sanctitas vestra plerosque habet qui∣buscum arcanum aliquid crediderit, putet id non minus celatum esse quam si uno tantum pectore contineretur; quod multo magis serenis∣simo Angliae Regi evenire debet, cui singuli in suo regno sunt subjecti, neque etiam velint, possunt Regi non esse fidelissimi. Vae namque illis, si vel parvo momento ab illius voluntate recederent. Le Grand, tom. III. p. 113. The King once said publicly before the council, that if any one spoke of him or his actions, in terms which became them not, he would let them know, that he was master. Et qu'il n'y <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uroit si belle tete qu'il ne fit voler. Id. p. 218.</NOTE>; and there was small likelihood, that any doc∣trine,
which lay under the imputation of encouraging
sedition, could ever pretend to his favour and counte∣nance.
But besides this political jealousy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the King.</NOTE> there was
another reason which inspired this imperious monarch
with an aversion to the reformers. He had early de∣clared
his sentiments against Luther; and having entered
the lists in those scholastic quarrels, he had received,
from his courtiers and theologians, infinite applause for
his performance. Elated by this imaginary success, and
blinded by a natural arrogance and obstinacy of temper,
he had entertained the most lofty opinion of his own
erudition, and he received with impatience, mixed with
contempt, any contradiction to his sentiments. Luther
also had been so imprudent, as to treat in a very indecent
manner his royal antagonist; and though he afterwards
made the humblest submissions to Henry, and apologized
for the vehemence of his former expressions, he never
could efface the hatred which the King had conceived
<PB N="140" REF="154"/>
against him and his doctrines. The idea of heresy still
appeared detectable as well as formidable to that prince;
and whilst his resentment against the see of Rome had
removed one considerable part of his early prejudices, he
had made it a point of honour never to relinquish the rest.
Separate as he stood from the catholic church, and from
the Roman pontiff, the head of it, he still valued hirnself
on maintaining the catholic doctrine, and on guarding,
by fire and sword, the imagined purity of his speculative
principles.</P>
<P>HENRY'S ministers and courtiers were of as motley a
character as his conduct;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the mi∣nisters.</NOTE> and seemed to waver, during
this whole reign, between the ancient and the new reli∣gion.
The Queen, engaged by interest as well as incli∣nation,
favoured the cause of the reformers: Cromwel,
who was created secretary of state, and who was every
day advancing in the King's confidence, had embraced
the same views; and as he was a man of prudence and
ability, he was able, very effectually, tho' in a covert
manner, to promote the late innovations: Cranmer,
archbishop of Canterbury, had secretly adopted the pro∣testant
tenets; and he had gained Henry's friendship by
his candour and sincerity; virtues which he possessed in
as eminent a degree as those times, equally distracted
with faction and oppressed with tyranny, could easily
permit. On the other hand, the duke of Norfolk ad∣hered
to the ancient faith; and by the greatness of his
rank, as well as by his talents, both for peace and war,
he had great weight in the King's council: Gardiner,
lately created bishop of Winchester, had inlisted himself
in the same party; and the suppleness of his character,
and the dexterity of his conduct, had rendered him ex∣tremely
useful to it.</P>
<P>ALL these ministers, while they stood in the most irre∣concileable
opposition of principles, were obliged to dis∣guise
<PB N="141" REF="155"/>
their particular opinions, and to pretend an entire
agreement with the sentiments of their master. Crom∣wel
and Cranmer still carried the appearance of a confor∣mity
to the ancient speculative tenets; but they artfully
made use of Henry's resentment to widen the breach with
the see of Rome. Norfolk and Gardiner feigned an
assent to the King's supremacy, and to his renounciation
of the sovereign pontiff; but they encouraged his passion
for the catholic faith, and instigated him to punish those
daring heretics, who had presumed to reject his theologi∣cal
principles. Both sides hoped, by their unlimited
compliance, to bring him over to their party: The King
mean while, who held the balance between the factions,
was enabled, by the courtship payed him both by protes∣tants
and catholics, to assume an immeasurable authority:
And tho' in all these measures he was really driven by his
ungoverned humour, he casually held a course, which
led more certainly to arbitrary power, than any which
the most profound politics could have traced out to him.
Artifice, refinement, and hypocrisy, in his situation,
would have put both parties on their guard against him,
and would have taught them reserve in complying with a
monarch, whom, they could never hope thoroughly to
have gained: But while the frankness, sincerity, and
openness of Henry's temper were generally known, as
well as the dominion of his furious passions; each side
dreaded to lose him by the smallest opposition, and flat∣tered
themselves that a blind compliance with his will,
would throw him, cordially and fully, into their in∣terests.</P>
<P>THE ambiguity of the King's conduct, tho' it kept
the courtiers in awe, served to encourage the protestant
doctrine among his subjects, and promoted that spirit of
innovation with which the age was generally seized, and
which nothing but an entire uniformity, as well as a
<PB N="142" REF="156"/>
steady severity in the administration, could be able to
repress. There were some Englishmen, Tindal, Joye,
Constantine, and others, who, dreading the exertion of
the King's authority, had fled to Antwerp<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 159.</NOTE>; where the
great privileges possessed by the Low Country provinces,
served, during some time, to give them protection.
These men employed themselves in writing books,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther progress of the refor∣mation</NOTE> in
English, against the corruptions of the church of Rome;
against images, reliques, pilgrimages; and they excited
the curiosity of men with regard to that question, the
most important in theology, the terms of acceptance with
the Supreme Being. In conformity to the Lutherans
and other protestants, they asserted, that salvation was
obtained by faith alone; and that the most infallible road
to perdition<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sacrilegium est et impietas velle placere Deo per opera &amp; non per solam Fidem. <HI>Luther adversus regem.</HI> Ita vides quam dives sit homo christianus sive baptizatus, qui etiam volens non potest perdere salutem suam quantiscunque peccatis. Nulla enim peocata possunt eum damnate nisi incredulitas. <HI>Id. de captivitate Babylonica.</HI></NOTE> was a reliance on <HI>good works;</HI> by which
terms they understood, as well the moral duties, as the
ceremonial and monastic observances. The defenders of
the ancient religion, on the other hand, maintained the
efficacy of <HI>good works;</HI> but tho' they did not exclude from
this appellation the social virtues, it was still the super∣stitions,
gainful to the church, which they chiefly ex∣tolled
and recommended. The books, composed by
these fugitives, having stole over to England, began to
make converts every where; but it was a translation of
the scriptures by Tindal, that was esteemed most dange∣rous
to the established faith. The first edition of this
work, composed with little accuracy, was found liable
to considerable objections; and Tindal, who was poor,
and could not afford to lose a great part of the impression,
<PB N="143" REF="157"/>
was longing for an opportunity of correcting his errors,
of which he had been made sensible. Tonstal, then bi∣shop
of London, soon after of Durham, a man of great
moderation, being desirous to discourage, in the gentlest
manner, these innovations, gave private orders for buying
up all the copies, which could be found at Antwerp; and
he burnt them publicly in Cheapside. By this contri∣vance,
he supplied Tindal with money, enabled him to
print a new and correct edition of his work, and gave
occasion to great scandal and reproach, in thus commit∣ting
to the flames the word of God<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hall. fol. 186. Fox, vol. i. p. 138. Burnet, vol. i. p. 159.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE disciples of the reformation met with little seve∣rity
during the ministry of Wolsey, who, tho' himself a
clergyman, bore too small regard to the ecclesiastical or∣der,
to serve as an instrument of their tyranny: It was
even an article of impeachment against him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Articles of impeachment in Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE>, that by his
connivance he had encouraged the growth of heresy, and
that he had protected and acquitted some notorious of∣fenders.
Sir Thomas More,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Thomas More</NOTE> who succeeded Wolsey as
chancellor, is at once an object deserving our compassion,
and an instance of the usual progress of men's sentiments
during that age. This man, whose elegant genius and
familiar acquaintance with the noble spirit of antiquity,
had given him very enlarged sentiments, and who had in
his early years advanced principles, which even at pre∣sent
would be deemed somewhat libertine, had, in the
course of events, been so irritated by polemics, and
thrown into such a superstitious attachment to the ancient
faith, that few inquisitors have been guilty of greater vio∣lence
in their prosecutions of heresy. Tho' adorned with
the gentlest manners, as well as the purest integrity, he
carried to the utmost height his aversion to heterodoxy;
and James Bainham, in particular, a gentleman of the
<PB N="144" REF="158"/>
Temple, experienced from him the highest severity.
Bainham, accused of favouring the new opinions, was
carried to More's house, and having refused to discover
his accomplices, the chancellor ordered him to be whipt
in his presence, and afterwards sent him to the Tower,
where he himself saw him put to the torture The un∣happy
gentleman, overcome by all these severities, ab∣jured
his opinions; but feeling afterwards the deepest
compunction for this apostacy, he openly returned to his
former tenets, and even courted the crown of martyr∣dom.
He was condemned as an obstinate and relapsed
heretic, and was burned in Smithfield<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fox. Burnet, vol. i. p. 165.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY were brought into the bishops courts for of∣fences,
which appear very trivial, but which were re∣garded
as symbols of the party: Some for teaching their
children the Lord's prayer in English; others for reading
the new testament in that language, or for speaking against
pilgrimages. To harbour the persecuted preachers, to ne∣glect
the fasts of the church, to declaim against the vices
of the clergy, were capital offences. One Thomas Bilney,
a priest, who had embraced the new doctrine, had been
terrified into an abjuration; but was so haunted by re∣morse,
that his friends dreaded some fatal effects of his
despair. At last, his mind seemed to be more composed;
but this appearing calm proceeded only from the resolution
which he had taken, of expiating his past offence, by an
open confession of the truth, and by dying a martyr to it.
He went thro' Norfolk, teaching every where the people
to beware of idolatry, and of trusting either to pilgri∣mages,
or to the cowle of St. Francis to the prayers of
the saints, or to images. He was soon seized, tried in
the bishop's court, and condemned as a relapsed heretic;
and the writ was sent down to burn him. When brought
<PB N="145" REF="159"/>
to the stake, he discovered such patience, fortitude, and
devotion, that the spectators were much affected with the
horrors of his punishment; and some mendicant friars,
who were present, fearing that his death would be im∣puted
to them, and make them lose those alms, which
they received from the charity of the people, desired him
publicly to acquit them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 164.</NOTE> of having any hand in his
death. He very willingly complied; and by this meek∣ness
gained the more on the sympathy of the people. An∣other
person, still more heroic, being brought to the stake
for denying the real presence seemed almost in a transport
of joy; and he tenderly embraced the faggots, which
were to be the instruments of his punishment, as the
means of procuring him eternal rest. In short, the tide
turning towards the new doctrine, those severe execu∣tions,
which, in another disposition of men's minds,
would have sufficed to suppress it, now served only the
more to diffuse it among the people, and to inspire them
with horror against the unrelenting persecutors.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Henry neglected not to punish the protestant
doctrine, which he esteemed heresy, his most formidable
enemies, he knew, were the zealous adherents to the an∣cient
religion, chiefly the monks, who, having their im∣mediate
dependance on the Roman pontiff, apprehended
their own ruin to be the certain consequence of abolishing
his authority in England. Peyto, a friar, preaching
before the King, had the assurance to tell him, “That
many lying prophets had deceived him, but he, as a
true Micajah, warned him, that the dogs would lick
his blood, as they had done Ahab's<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 167</NOTE>.” The King
took no notice of this insult; but allowed the preacher
to depart in peace. Next Sunday, he employed Dr.
Corren to preach before him; who justified the King's
Proceedings, and gave Peyto the appellations of a rebel,
<PB N="146" REF="160"/>
a slanderer, a dog, and a traytor. Elston, another friar
of the same house, interrupted the preacher; and told
him, that he was one of the lying prophets, who sought
to establish by adultery the succession to the crown; but
that he himself would justify all that Peyto had said.
Henry silenced this petulant friar; but showed no other
mark of resentment than ordering Peyto and him to be
summoned before the council, and to be rebuked for their
offence<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 86. Burnet, vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>. He even here bore patiently some new instances
of their obstinacy and arrogance. For when the earl of
Essex, a privy counsellor, told them, that they deserved
for their offence to be thrown into the Thames; Elston
replied, that the road to heaven lay as near by water as
by land<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 562.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT several monks were detected in a conspiracy,
which, as it might have proved more dangerous to the
King, was on its discovery attended with more fatal con∣sequences
to themselves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Maid of Kent.</NOTE> Elizabeth Barton, of Alding∣ton
in Kent, commonly called the <HI>holy Maid of Kent,</HI>
had been subject to hysterical fits, which threw her body
into unusual convulsions; and having produced an equal
disorder in her mind, made her utter strange sayings,
which, as she was scarce conscious of them during the
time, had soon after entirely escaped her memory. The
silly people in the neighbourhood were struck with these
appearances, which they imagined to be supernatural;
and Richard Masters, vicar of the parish, a designing fel∣low,
founded on them a project, by which he hoped to
draw both profit and consideration to himself. He went
to Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was at
that time alive; and having given him an account of
Elizabeth's revelations, he so far wrought on that pru∣dent,
but superstitious prelate, as to receive orders from
<PB N="147" REF="161"/>
him to watch her in her trances, and to note down care∣fully
all her future speeches. The regard paid her by a
person of so high a rank, soon rendered her still more
the object of attention to the neighbourhood; and it was
easy for Masters to persuade them, as well as the maid
herself, that her ravings were inspirations of the Holy
Ghost. Knavery, as is usual, soon after succeeding to
illusion, she learned to counterfeit trances; and she then
uttered, in an extraordinary tone of voice such speeches
as were dictated to her by her spiritual director Mas∣ters
associated with him Dr. Bocking, a canon of Can∣terbury;
and their design was to raise the credit of an
image of the virgin, which stood in a chapel belonging
to Masters and to draw such pilgrimages to it as usually
frequented the more famous images and reliques. In
prosecution of this design, Elizabeth pretended revela∣tions,
which directed her to have recourse to that image
for a cure; and being brought before it, in the presence
of a great multitude, she fell anew into convulsions; and
after distorting her limbs and countenance during a com∣petent
time, she affected to have obtained a perfect re∣covery
by the intercession of the virgin<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 570. Blanquet's Epitome of chronicles.</NOTE>. This miracle
was soon bruited abroad; and the two priests, finding
the imposture to succeed beyond their own expectations,
began to extend their views, and to lay the foundation
of more important enterprizes. They taught their peni∣tent
to declaim against the new doctrines, which she de∣nominated
heresy; against innovations in ecclesiasti∣cal
government; and against the King's divorce from
Catherine. She went so far as to assert, that, if he pro∣secuted
that design, and married another, he should not
be a King a month longer, and should not an hour
longer possess the favour of the Almighty, but should die
the death of a villain. Many monks throughout Eng∣land,

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="147" REF="163"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="148" REF="164"/>
either from folly, or roguery, or from faction,
which is often a complication of both, entered into this
delusion; and one Deering, a friar, wrote a book of the
revelations and prophecies of Elizabeth<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 181.</NOTE>. Miracles were
daily added, to encrease the wonder; and the pulpit
every where resounded with accounts of the sanctity and
inspirations of this new prophetess. Messages were car∣ried
from her to Queen Catherine, by which that prin∣cess
was exhorted to persist in her opposition to the di∣vorce;
the pope's ambassadors gave encouragement to the
popular credulity; and even Fisher, bishop of Rochester,
tho' a man of sense and learning, was carried away with
an opinion so favourable to the party, which he had
embraced<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 87.</NOTE>. The King at last began to think the mat∣ter
worthy of his attention; and having ordered Eliza∣beth
and her accomplices to be arrested, he brought them
before the star-chamber, where they freely, without
being put to the torture, made confession of their guilt.
The Parliament, in the session held the beginning of this
year, passed an act of attainder against some who were
engaged in this treasonable imposture<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">25 Hen. VIII. c. 12. Burnet, vol. i. p. 149. Hall, fol. 220.</NOTE>; and Elizabeth
herself, Masters, Bocking, Deering, Rich, Risby, Gold,
suffered for their crime. The bishop of Rochester, Abel,
Addison, Laurence, and some others, were condemned
for misprision of treason; because they had not discovered
some criminal speeches which they heard from Eliza∣beth<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Godwin's Annals, p. 53.</NOTE>: And they were thrown into prison. The better
to undeceive the multitude, the forgery of many of the
prophetess's miracles was detected; and even, the scan∣dalous
prostitution of her manners was laid open to the
public. Those passions, which so naturally insinuate
themselves amidst the warm intimacies maintained by the
<PB N="149" REF="165"/>
devotees of different sexes, had taken place between Eli∣zabeth
and her confederates; and it was found, that a
door to her dormitory, which was said to have been mi∣raculously
opened, in order to give her access to the
chapel, for the sake of frequent converse with heaven,
had been contrived by Bocking and Masters for less re∣fined
purposes.</P>
<P>THE detection of an imposture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1535.</NOTE> attended with so many
odious circumstances, hurt much the credit of the eccle∣siastics,
particularly of the monks, and instigated the
King to take vengeance on them. He suppressed three
monasteries of the Observantine friars; and finding that
little clamour was excited by this act of power, he was
the more encouraged to lay his rapacious hands on the
rest. Meanwhile, he exercised punishment on indivi∣duals,
who were obnoxious to him. The Parliament
had made it treason to endeavour the depriving the King
of his dignity or titles: They had lately added to his
other titles, that of supreme head of the church: It was
inferred, that to deny his supremacy was treason; and
many priors and ecclesiastics lost their lives for this new
species of crime. It was certainly a high instance of
tyranny to make the mere delivery of a political opinion,
especially one that nowise affected the King's temporal
right, to be a capital offence, tho' attended with no overt
act; and the Parliament, in passing this law, had over∣looked
all the principles by which a civilized, much more
a free people, should be governed: But the violence of
changing so suddenly the whole system of government,
and the making it treason to deny what, during many
ages, it had been heresy to assert, is an event which may
appear somewhat extraordinary. Even the stern unre∣lenting
mind of Henry was, at first, shocked with these
sanguinary measures; and he went so far as to change
<PB N="150" REF="166"/>
his garb and dress, pretending sorrow for the necessity,
by which he was pushed to such extremities. Still im∣pelled,
however, by his violent temper, and desirous of
striking a terror into the whole nation, he proceeded, by
making examples of Fisher and More, to consummate
his lawless tyranny.</P>
<P>JOHN Fisher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and execution of Fisher, bishop of Rochester.</NOTE> bishop of Rochester, was a prelate,
eminent for his learning and morals, no less than for his
ecclesiastical dignities, and for the high favour which he
had long possessed with the King. When he was thrown
into prison, on account of his refusing the oath of suc∣cession,
and his concealment of Elizabeth Barton's trea∣sonable
speeches, he had not only been deprived of all
his revenues, but stripped of his very cloaths, and, with∣out
consideration of his extremeage, was allowed nothing
but rags, which scarce sufficed to cover his nakedness<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uller's Church Hist. book 5. p. 203.</NOTE>.
In this condition, he lay in prison above a twelvemonth;
when the pope, willing to recompense the sufferings of
so faithful an adherent, created him a cardinal; tho'
Fisher was so careless of that dignity, that even if the
purple were lying on the ground, he declared that he
would not stoop to take it. This promotion of a man,
merely for his opposition to royal authority, rouzed the
indignation of the King; and he resolved to make the
innocent person feel the effects of his resentment. Fisher
was indicted for denying the King's supremacy, was
tried,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d June.</NOTE> condemned, and beheaded.</P>
<P>THE execution of this prelate was intended as a warn∣ing
to More,<NOTE PLACE="marg">O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sir Tho∣mas More.</NOTE> whose compliance, on account of his great
authority both abroad and at home, and his high repu∣tation
for learning and virtue, was anxiously desired by
the King. That prince also bore as great personal affec∣tion
and regard to More, as his imperious mind, the
sport of passions, was susceptible of towards a man, who
<PB N="151" REF="167"/>
in any particular opposed his violent inclination. But
More could never be prevailed on to acknowledge any
opinion so contrary to his principles as that of the King's
supremacy; and tho' Henry exacted that compliance
from the whole nation, there was, as yet, no law oblig∣ing
any one to take an oath to that purpose. Rich, the
solicitor general, was sent to confer with More, then a
prisoner, who kept a cautious silence with regard to the
supremacy: He was only inveigled to say, that any
question with regard to the law, which established that
prerogative, was like a two-edged sword: If a person an∣swer
one way, it will confound his soul; if another, it
will destroy his body. No more was wanted to found an
indictment of high treason against the prisoner. His
silence was called malicious, and made a part of his
crime; and these words, which had casually dropped
from him, were interpreted as a denial of the supremacy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">More's Life of Sir Thomas More. Herbert, p. 393.</NOTE>.
Trials were mere formalities during this reign: The
jury gave sentence against More, who had long expected
this fate, and who needed no preparation to fortify him
against the terrors of death. Not only his constancy,
but even his cheerfulness, nay, his usual facetiousness,
never forsook him; and he made a sacrifice of his life to
his integrity with the same indifference that he maintained
in any ordinary occurrence. When he was mounting
the scaffold, he said to one, “Friend, help me up, and
when I go down again let me shift for myself.” The
executioner asking him forgiveness, he granted the re∣quest,
but told him, “You will never get credit by be∣heading,
me, my neck is so short.” Then laying his
head on the block, he bid the executioner stay till he put
aside his beard: “For,” said he, “it never committed
treason.” Nothing was wanting to the glory of this
end, except a better cause, more free from weakness and
<PB N="152" REF="168"/>
superstition. But as the man followed his principles and
sense of duty, however misguided, his constancy and in∣tegrity
are equally objects of our admiration. He was
beheaded in the fifty-third year of his age.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th July.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN the execution of Fisher and More was reported
at Rome, especially that of the former, who was invested
with the dignity of cardinal, every one discovered the
most violent rage against the King; and numerous libels
were published, by the wits and orators of Italy, com∣paring
him to Caligula, Nero, Domitian, and all the
most unrelenting tyrants of antiquity. Clement the se∣venth
had died about six months after he pronounced
sentence against the King; and Paul the third, of the
name of Farnese, had succeeded to the papal throne.
This pontiff, who had always favoured Henry's cause
while a cardinal, had hoped, that, personal animosities
being buried with his predecessor, it might not be im∣possible
to form an agreement with England: And Hen∣ry
himself was so desirous of accommodating matters,
that in a negotiation, which he entered into with Francis
little before this time, he required, that that monarch
should conciliate a friendship between him and the court
of Rome. But Henry was accustomed to prescribe, not
to receive terms; and even while he was negotiating
peace, his usual violence often carried him to commit
offences, which rendered the quarrel totally incurable.
The execution of Fisher was regarded by Paul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Aug.</NOTE> as so
capital an injury, that he immediately passed censures
against the King, citing him and all his adherents to ap∣pear
in Rome within ninety days, in order to answer for
their crimes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">King ex∣communi∣cated.</NOTE> If they failed, he excommunicated them;
deprived the King of his realm; subjected the kingdom
to an interdict; declared his issue by Anne Boleyn illegi∣timate;
dissolved all leagues which any catholic princes
had made with him; gave his kingdom to any invader;
<PB N="153" REF="169"/>
commanded the nobility to take arms against him; freed
his subjects from all oaths of allegiance; cut off their
commerce with foreign, states; and declared it lawful for
any one to seize them, to make slaves of their persons,
and to convert their effects to his own use<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sanders, p. 148.</NOTE>. But tho'
these censures were passed, they were not at that time
openly denounced: The pope delayed the publication,
till he should find an agreement with England entirely
desperate; and till the emperor, who was at present
pressed by the Turks and the protestant princes in Ger∣many,
should be in a condition to carry the sentence into execution.</P>
<P>THE King knew, that he might expect any injury,
which it should be in Charles's power to inflict; and he
therefore made it the chief object of his policy to incapa∣citate
that monarch from wreaking his resentment upon
him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 350, 351.</NOTE>. He renewed his friendship with Francis, and
opened negotiations for marrying his infant-daughter,
Elizabeth, with the duke of Angouleme, third son of
Francis. These two princes also made advances to the
protestant league in Germany, who were ever jealous of
the emperor's ambition: And Henry, besides remitting
them some money, sent Fox, bishop of Hereford, as
Francis did Bellay, lord of Langey, to treat with those
princes. But during the first fervours of the reformation,
an agreement in theological tenets was held, as well as
an union of interest, to be essential to a good correspon∣dence
among states; and tho' both Francis and Henry
flattered the German princes with hopes of their em∣bracing
the confession of Ausbourg, it was looked upon
as a bad symptom of their sincerity, that they exercised
such extreme rigour against all preachers of the reforma∣tion
in their respective dominions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, lib. 10.</NOTE>. Henry carried the
<PB N="154" REF="170"/>
feint so far, that, while he thought himself the first theo∣logian
in the world, he yet invited over Melancthon,
Bucer, Sturmius, Draco, and other German divines,
in order to confer with him, and to instruct him in the
foundation of their tenets. These theologians were now
of great importance in the world; and no poet or philo∣sopher,
even in antient Greece, where they were treated
with most respect had ever reached equal applause and
admiration with these wretched composers of metaphysical
polemics. The German princes told the King, that
they could not spare their divines; and as Henry had no
hopes of agreement with such zealous disputants, and
knew that in Germany the followers of Luther would
not associate with the disciples of Zuinglius, because,
tho' they agreed in every thing else, they differed in some
particulars with regard to the eucharist, he was the more
indifferent on account of this refusal. He could also
foresee, that even while the league of Smalcalde did not
act in concert with him, they would always be carried
by their interest to oppose the emperor: And the hatred
between Francis and that monarch was so inveterate,
that he deemed himself sure of a sincere ally in one or
other of these potentates.</P>
<P>DURING these negotiations an incident happened in
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1536.</NOTE> which promised a more amicable conclusion of
these disputes, and seemed even to open a way for a re∣concilement
between Henry and Charles. Queen Ca∣therine
was seized with a lingering illness, which at last
brought her to her grave:<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Jan.</NOTE> She died at Kimbolton in the
county of Huntingdon, in the fiftieth year of her age.
A little before she expired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Queen Ca∣therine.</NOTE> she wrote a very tender letter
to the King; where she gave him the appellation of <HI>her
most dear Lord King, and Husband.</HI> She told him, that
as the hour of her death was now approaching, she laid
<PB N="155" REF="171"/>
hold of this last opportunity to inculcate on him the im∣portance
of his religious duty, and the comparative empti∣ness
of all human grandeur and enjoyment: That tho' his
fondness towards these perishing advantages had thrown
her into many calamities, as well as created to himself
much trouble, she yet forgave him all past injuries, and
hoped that this pardon would be ratified in heaven: And
that she had no other request to make, but to recommend
to him his daughter, the sole pledge of their loves, and
to crave his protection for her maids and servants. She
concluded with these words, <HI>I make this vow, that mine
eyes desire you above all things</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 403.</NOTE>. The King was touched,
even to the shedding of tears, by this last tender proof of
Catherine's affection; but Queen Anne is said to have
expressed her joy for the death of a rival beyond what
decency or humanity could permit<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 192.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE emperor thought, that as the decease of his aunt
had removed all foundation for personal animosity between
him and Henry, it might not now be impossible to de∣tach
him from the alliance of France, and renew that
confederacy with England from which he had formerly
reaped so much advantage. He sent Henry proposals for
a return to antient amity, upon these conditions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Du Bellay, liv. 5. Herbert. Burnet, vol. iii. in Coll. N<SUP>o</SUP> 50.</NOTE>; that
he should be reconciled to the pope, that he should assist
him in his war with the Turk, and that he should take
party with him against Francis, who now threatened the
dutchy of Milan. The King replied, that he was wil∣ling
to be on good terms with the emperor, provided he
would acknowledge, that the former breach of friendship
came entirely from himself: As to the conditions pro∣posed;
the proceedings against the bishop of Rome were
so just, and so fully ratified by the Parliament of Eng∣land,
that they could not now be revoked; when chris∣tian
<PB N="156" REF="172"/>
princes should have settled peace among themselves,
he would not fail to exert that vigour, which became
him, against the enemies of the faith; and after amity
with the emperor was once fully restored, he would then
be in a situation, as a common friend both to him and
Francis, either to mediate an agreement between them,
or to assist the injured party.</P>
<P>WHAT rendered Henry more indifferent to the ad∣vances
made by the emperor, was his experience of the
usual duplicity and insincerity of that monarch, and the
intelligence which he received of the present transactions
in Europe. Francis Sforza, duke of Milan, was dead
without issue; and the emperor maintained, that the
dutchy, being a fief of the empire, was devolved to him,
as the head of the Germanic body: Not to give um∣brage,
however, to the states of Italy, he prosessed his
intention of bestowing that principality on some prince,
who should be obnoxious to no party, and he even made
offer of it to the duke of Angouleme, third son to Francis.
The French monarch, who pretended that his own right
to Milan was now revived upon Sforza's death, was con∣tented
to substitute his second son, the duke of Orleans,
in his place; and the emperor pretended to close with this
proposal. But his sole intention in that liberal conces∣sion
was to gain time, till he should put himself in a
warlike posture, and be able to carry an invasion into
Francis's dominions. The antient enmity between these
princes broke out anew in bravadoes, and in personal in∣sults
on each other, not becoming persons of their rank,
and still less suitable to men of such unquestioned bravery.
Charles soon after invaded Provence in person, with an
army of fifty thousand men; but met with no success.
His army perished with sickness, fatigue, famine, and
other disasters; and he was obliged to raise the siege of
Marseilles, and retire into Italy with the broken remains
<PB N="157" REF="173"/>
of his forces. An army of imperialists, near 30,000
strong, which invaded France on the side of the Nether∣lands,
and laid siege to Peronne, made no greater pro∣gress,
but retired upon the approach of a French army.
And Henry had thus the satisfaction to find, both that
his ally, Francis, was likely to support himself without
foreign assistance, and that his own tranquillity was fully
ensured by these violent wars and animosities on the con∣tinent.</P>
<P>IF any inquietude remained with the English court, it
was solely occasioned by the state of affairs in Scotland.
James, hearing of the distressed situation of his ally,
Francis, very generously levied some forces; and em∣barking
them on board vessels, which he had hired for
that purpose, landed them safely in France. He even
came over in person; and making haste to join the French
King's camp, which then lay in Provence, and to par∣take
of his danger, he met that prince at Lyons, who,
having repulsed the emperor's invasion, was now return∣ing
to his capital. Recommended by so agreeable and
seasonable an instance of friendship, the King of Scots
made suit to Magdalen, daughter of the French mo∣narch,
who had no other scruple in agreeing to the match,
than what was derived from the infirm state of his daugh∣ter's
health, which seemed to threaten her with an ap∣proaching
end. But James having gained the affections
of the princess, and obtained her consent, the father
would no longer oppose the united desires of his daughter
and friend; and they were accordingly married, and soon
after set sail for Scotland, where the young Queen, as
was foreseen, died in a little time after her arrival.
Francis, however, was afraid, lest his ally, Henry,
whom he likewise looked on as his friend, and who lived
with him on a more cordial footing than is usual among
great princes, should be displeased that this close confe∣deracy
<PB N="158" REF="174"/>
between France and Scotland was concluded with∣out
his participation. He therefore dispatched Pomme∣raye
to London, in order to apologize for this measure;
but Henry, with his usual openness and freedom, expressed
such displeasure, that he refused even to confer with the
ambassador; and Francis was apprehensive of a rupture
with a prince, who regulated his measures more by hu∣mour
and passion than by the rules of political prudence.
But Henry was so fettered by the opposition, in which
he was engaged against the pope and the emperor, that
he pursued no farther this disgust against Francis; and in
the end every thing remained in tranquillity both on the
side of France and Scotland.</P>
<P>THE domestic peace of England seemed to be exposed
to more hazard, by the violent innovations in religion;
and it may be affirmed, that, in this dangerous conjunc∣ture,
nothing ensured public tranquillity so much as the
decisive authority acquired by the King, and his great
ascendant over all his subjects. Not only the devotion
paid to the crown, was profound during that age: The
personal respect, inspired by Henry, was considerable;
and even the terrors, with which he over-awed every
one, were not attended with any considerable degree of
hatred. His frankness, his sincerity, his magnificence,
his generosity, were virtues which counterbalanced his
violence, cruelty, and impetuosity. And the important
rank, which his vigour, more than address, acquired him
in all foreign negotiations, flattered the vanity of English∣men,
and made them the more willingly endure those
domestic hardships, to which they were exposed. The
King, conscious of his advantages, was now proceeding
to the most dangerous trial of his authority; and after
paving the way for that measure by several expedients,
he was at last determined to suppress the monasteries, and
to put himself in possession of their ample revenues.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="175"/>
THE great encrease of monasteries, if matters be con∣sidered
merely in a political light, will appear the radical
inconvenience of the catholic religion; and every other
disadvantage, attending that communion, seems to have
an inseparable connection with these religious institutions.
Papal usurpations, the tyranny of the inquisition, the
multiplication of holidays; all these fetters on liberty
and industry, were ultimately derived from the authority
and insinuation of monks, whose habitations, being esta∣blished,
every where, proved so many colonies of super∣stition
and of folly. This order of men were extremely
enraged against Henry; and regarded the abolition of the
papal authority in England, as the removal of the sole
protection which they enjoyed against the rapacity of the
crown and of the courtiers. They were now subjected
to the King's visitation; the supposed sacredness of their
bulls from Rome was rejected; the progress of the refor∣mation
abroad, which had every where been attended
with the abolition of the monastic state, gave them rea∣son
to expect like consequences in England; and tho' the
King still maintained the doctrine of purgatory, to which
most of the convents owed their origin and support, it
was foreseen, that, in the progress of the contest, he
would every day be led to depart wider from antient in∣stitutions,
and be drawn nearer the tenets of the refor∣mers,
with whom his political interests naturally induced
him to ally himself. Moved by these considerations, the
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iars made use of all their influence to enflame the peo∣ple
against the King's government; and Henry, finding
their safety irreconcilable with his own, was determined
to seize the present opportunity, and utterly destroy his
declared enemies.</P>
<P>CROMWEL, secretary of state, had been appointed
vicar-general, or vicegerent, a new office, by which the
King's supremacy, or the absolute, uncontroulable power
<PB N="160" REF="176"/>
assumed over the church, was delegated to him. He
employed Layton, London, Price, Gage, Petre, Bella∣sis,
and others, as commissioners, who carried on, every
where, a rigorous enquiry with regard to the conduct
and deportment of all the friars. During times of fac∣tion,
especially of the religious kind, no equity is to be
expected from adversaries; and as it was known, that
the King's intention in this visitation was to find a pre∣tence
for abolishing monasteries, we may naturally con∣clude,
that the reports of the commissioners are very
little to be relied on. Friars were encouraged to bring
in informations against their brethren; the slightest evi∣dence
was credited; and even the calumnies spread abroad
by the friends to the reformation, were regarded as
grounds of proof. Monstrous disorders are therefore said
to have been found in many of the religious houses:
Whole convents of women abandoned to lewdness:
Signs of abortions procured, of infants murdered, of un∣natural
lusts between persons of the same sex. It is in∣deed
probable, that the blind submission of the people,
during those ages, would render the friars and nuns more
unguarded, and more dissolute, than they are in any
roman catholic country at present: But still, the re∣proaches,
which it is safest to credit, are such as point
at vices, naturally connected with the very institution of
convents, and with the monastic life. The cruel and in∣veterate
factions and quarrels therefore which the com∣missioners
mentioned, are very credible, among men,
who, being confined together within the same walls,
never can forget their mutual animosities, and who, being
cut off from all the most endearing connections of nature,
are commonly cursed with hearts more selfish, and tem∣pers
more unrelenting, than fall to the share of other
men. The pious frauds, practised to increase the devo∣tion
and liberality of the people, may be regarded as
certain, in an order founded on illusions, lies, and super∣stition.
<PB N="161" REF="177"/>
The supine idleness also, and its attendant, pro∣found
ignorance, with which the convents were re∣proached,
admit of no question; and tho' monks were
the true preservers, as well as inventors, of the dreaming
and captious philosophy of the schools, no manly or ele∣gant
knowledge could be expected among men, whose life,
condemned to a tedious uniformity, and deprived of
all emulation, afforded nothing to raise the mind, or cul∣tivate
the genius.</P>
<P>SOME few monasteries, terrified with this rigorous in∣quisition
carried on by Cromwel and his commissioners,
surrendered their revenues into the King's hands; and
the monks received small pensions as the reward of their
obsequiousness. Orders were given to dismiss such nuns
and friars as were below four and twenty, and whose
vows were, on that account, supposed not to be binding.
The doors of the convents were opened, even to such as
were above that age; and all those recovered their liberty
who desired it. But as all these expedients did not fully
answer the King's purpose, he had recourse to his usual
instrument of power, the Parliaments and in order to
prepare men for the innovations projected, the report of
the visitors was published, and a general horror was en∣deavoured
to be excited in the nation against institutions
which, to their ancestors, had been the objects of the
most profound veneration.</P>
<P>THE King, tho' determined to abolish utterly the mo∣nastic
orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Feb.</NOTE> resolved to proceed gradually in this great
work; and he gave directions to the Parliament to go no
further at present,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> than to suppress the lesser monasteries,
who possessed revenues below two hundred pounds a year
value<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">27 Hen, VIII. c. 28.</NOTE>. These were found to be the most corrupted,
as lying less under the restraint of shame, and being ex∣posed
to less scrutiny<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 193.</NOTE>; and it was deemed safest to be∣gin
<PB N="162" REF="178"/>
with them, and thereby prepare the way for the
greater innovations projected. By this act three hundred
and seventy-six monasteries were suppressed, and their re∣venues,
amounting to thirty-two thousand pounds a year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppression of the lesser monaste∣ries.</NOTE>
were granted to the King; besides their goods, chattels,
and plate, computed at a hundred thousand pounds
more<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is pretended, see Hollingshed, p. 939, that ten thousand monks were turned out on the dissolution of the lasser monasteries. If so, most of them must have been Mendicants: For the revenue could not have supported near that number. The Mendicants, no doubt, still conti∣nued their former pro∣session.</NOTE>. It does not appear that any opposition was made
to this important law: So absolute was Henry's authority!
A court, called the court of augmentation of the King's
revenue, was appointed for the management of these
funds. The people naturally concluded, from the erec∣tion
of this court, that Henry intended to proceed in de∣spoiling
the church of her patrimony<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII. c. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE act formerly passed, empowering the King to
name thirty-two commissioners for framing a body of
canon law, was renewed; but the project was never car∣ried
into execution. Henry thought, that the present
confusion of that law encreased his authority, and kept
the clergy in still greater dependance.</P>
<P>FARTHER progress was made in compleating the union
of Wales with England: The separate jurisdictions of
several great lords or marchers, as they were called,
which obstructed the course of justice in Wales, and en∣couraged
robbery and pillaging, were abolished; and the
authority of the King's courts was extended every where.
Some jurisdictions of a like nature in England were also
abolished<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII▪ c. 4.</NOTE> this session.</P>
<P>THE commons, sensible that they had gained nothing
by opposing the King's will, when he formerly endea∣voured
<PB N="163" REF="179"/>
to secure the profits of wardships and liveries,
were now contented to frame a law<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>, such as he dictated
to them. It was enacted, that the possession of land
shall be adjudged to be in those who have the use of it,
not in those to whom it is transferred in trust.</P>
<P>AFTER all these laws were passed, the King dissolved
the Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 April.</NOTE> a Parliament memorable, not only for
the great and important innovations which it introduced,
but also for the long time it had sat, and the frequent
prorogations which it had undergone. Henry had found
it so obsequious to his will, that he did not chuse, during
these religious ferments, to hazard a new election; and
he continued the same Parliament above six years: A
practice, at that time, unusual in England.</P>
<P>THE convocation, which sat during this session,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A convoca∣tion.</NOTE> were
engaged in a very important work, the deliberating on
the new translation which was projected of the scriptures.
Tindal had formerly given a translation, and it had been
greedily read by the people; but as the clergy complained
of it, as very inaccurate and unfaithful, it was now pro∣posed
to them that they should themselves publish a tran∣slation,
which would not be liable to those objections.
The friends of the reformation asserted, that nothing
could be more absurd than to conceal, in an unknown
tongue, the word itself of God, and thus to counteract
the will of heaven, which, for the purpose of universal
salvation, had published that salutary doctrine to all na∣tions:
That if this practice was not very absurd, the ar∣tifice
at least was very barefaced, and proved a conscious∣ness,
that the glosses and traditions of the clergy stood in
direct opposition to the original text, dictated by Supreme
Intelligence: That it was now necessary for the people,
so long abused by interested pretensions, to see with their
<PB N="164" REF="180"/>
own eyes, and to examine whether the claims of the ec∣clesiastics
were founded on that charter, which was on
all hands acknowledged to be derived from heaven: And
that as a spirit of research and curiosity was happily re∣vived,
and men were now obliged to make a choice
among the pretensions of different sects, the proper ma∣terials
for decision, and above all, the holy scriptures,
should be set before them, and the revealed will of God,
which the change of language had somewhat obscured,
be again, by their means, revealed to mankind.</P>
<P>THE favourers of the ancient religion maintained, on
the other hand, that the pretence of making the people
see with their own eyes, was a mere cheat, and was it∣self
a very barefaced artifice, by which the new preachers
hoped to obtain the guidance of them, and seduce them
from those pastors, whom the laws, whom ancient esta∣blishments,
whom heaven itself had appointed for their
spiritual direction: That the people were, by their igno∣rance,
their stupidity, their necessary avocations, totally
unqualified to choose their own principles, and it was a
mockery to set materials before them, of which they
could not possibly make any proper use: That even in
the affairs of common life, and in their temporal con∣cerns,
which lay more within the compass of human rea∣son,
the laws had, in a great measure, deprived them of
the right of private judgment, and had, happily, for their
own and the public interest, regulated their conduct and
behaviour: That theological questions were placed much
beyond the sphere of vulgar comprehension; and eccle∣siastics
themselves, tho' assisted by all the advantages of
education, erudition, and an assiduous study of the sci∣ence,
could not be fully assured of a just decision; except
by the promise made them in scripture, that God would
be ever present with his church, and that the gates of
hell should not prevail against her: That the gross errors
<PB N="165" REF="181"/>
adopted by the wisest heathens, proved how unfit men
were to grope their own way, thro' this profound dark∣ness;
nor would the scriptures, if trusted to every man's
judgment, be able to remedy; on the contrary, they
would much augment, these fatal illusions: That sacred
writ itself was involved in so much obscurity, was exposed
to so many difficulties, contained so many appearing con∣tradictions,
that it was the most dangerous weapon which
could be intrusted into the hands of the ignorant and
giddy multitude: That the poetical spirit, in which a
great part of it was composed, at the same time that it
occasioned uncertainty in the sense, by its multiplied
tropes and figures, was sufficient to kindle the zeal of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sanaticism, and thereby throw civil society into the most
furious combustion: That a thousand fects must arise,
which would pretend, each of them, to derive its tenets
from the scripture; and would be able, by specious ar∣guments,
or even without specious arguments, to seduce
silly women, and ignorant mechanics, into a belief of
the most monstrous principles:, And that if ever this dis∣order,
dangerous to the magistrate himself, received a
remedy, it must be from the tacit acquiescence of the
people in some new authority; and it was evidently bet∣ter,
without farther contest or enquiry, to adhere peace∣ably
to ancient, and therefore the more secure establish∣ments.</P>
<P>THESE latter arguments being more agreeable to ec∣clesiastical
government, would probably have prevailed in
the convocation, had it not been for the authority of
Cranmer, Latimer, and some other bishops, who were
supposed to speak the King's sense of the matter. A vote
was passed for publishing a new translation of the scrip∣tures;
and in three years time this great work was finish∣ed,
and printed at Paris. This was deemed a great
point gained by the reformers; and a considerable ad∣vancement
<PB N="166" REF="182"/>
of their cause. Farther progress was soon
expected, after such important successes.</P>
<P>BUT while the retainers to the new religion were
triumphing in their prosperity, they met with a mortifi∣cation,
which seemed to blast all their hopes: Their pa∣troness,
Anne Boleyn, lost the King's favour, and soon
after her life, from the rage of that furious monarch.
Henry had persevered constantly in his love to this lady,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disgrace of Q. Anne.</NOTE>
during six years that his prosecution of the divorce lasted;
and the more obstacles he met with to the gratification
of his passion, the more determined zeal did he exert in
pursuing his purpose. But the affection which had sub∣sisted
so long under difficulties, had no sooner attained
secure possession of its object, than it languished from
satiety; and the King's heart was apparently alienated
from his consort. Anne's enemies soon perceived this
fatal change; and they were very forward to widen the
breach, when they found that they incurred no danger by
interposing in those delicate concerns. She had brought
forth a dead son; and Henry's extreme fondness for male
issue being thus, for the present, disappointed, his tem∣per,
equally violent and superstitious, was disposed to
make the innocent mother answerable for this misfor∣tune<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burner, vol. i. p. 196.</NOTE>.
But the chief means which Anne's enemies
employed to inflame the King against her, was his
jealousy.</P>
<P>ANNE, though she appears to have been entirely in∣nocent,
and even virtuous, in her conduct, had a certain
gaity, if not levity, of character, which threw her off
her guard, and made her less circumspect than her situ∣ation
required. Her education in France rendered her
the more prone to these freedoms; and it was with diffi∣culty
she conformed herself to that strict ceremonial
<PB N="167" REF="183"/>
which was practised in the court of England. More
vain than haughty, she was pleased to see the influence
of her beauty on all around her, and she indulged her∣self
in an easy familiarity with persons, who were formerly
her equals, and who might then have pretended to her
friendship and good graces. Henry's dignity was offend∣ed
with these popular manners; and though the lover
had been entirely blind, the husband possessed but too
quick discernment and penetration. Wicked instruments
interposed, and put a malignant interpretation on the
harmless liberties of the Queen: The viscountess of
Rocheford, in particular, who was married to the Queen's
brother, but who lived on bad terms with her sister-in-law,
insinuated the most cruel suspicions into the King's
mind; and as she was a woman of a very profligate
character, she paid no regard either to truth or humanity
in those calumnies which she suggested. She pretended,
that her own husband was engaged in a criminal corre∣spondence
with his sister; and not contented with this
imputation, she poisoned every action of the Queen, and
represented each instance of favour which she conferred
on any one, as a token of affection. Henry Norris,
groom of the stole, Weston, and Brereton, gentlemen of
the King's chamber, together with Mark Smeton, groom
of the chamber, were observed to possess much of the
Queen's friendship; and they served her with a zeal
and attachment which, though chiefly derived from gra∣titude,
might not improbably be seasoned with some
mixture of tenderness for so amiable a princess. The
King's jealousy laid hold of the slightest circumstance;
and finding no particular object on which it could fasten,
it vented itself equally on every one who came within
the verge of its fury.</P>
<P>HAD Henry's jealousy been derived from love, though
it might on a sudden have proceeded to the most violent
<PB N="168" REF="184"/>
extremities, it would have been subject to many remorses
and contrarieties; and might at last have served only to
augment that affection, on which it was founded. But
it was a more stern jealousy, fostered entirely by pride:
His love was wholly transferred to another object. Jane
Seymour, daughter of Sir John Seymour, and maid of
honour to the Queen, a young lady of singular beauty
and merit, had obtained an entire ascendant over him;
and he was determined to sacrifice every thing to the
gratification of this new appetite. Unlike to most
monarchs, who judge lightly of the crime of gallantry,
and who deem the young damsels of their court rather
honoured than disgraced by their passion, he seldom
thought of any other attachment than that of marriage;
and in order to attain this end, he underwent more
difficulties and committed greated crimes than those which
he fought to avoid by forming that legal connexion.
And having thus entertained the design of raising his
new mistress to his bed and throne, he more willingly
hearkened to every suggestion, which threw any imputa∣tion
of guilt on the unfortunate Anne Boleyn.</P>
<P>THE King's jealousy first appeared openly in a tilting<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st May.</NOTE>
at Greenwich, where the Queen happened to drop her
handkerchief; an incident probably casual, but inter∣preted
by him as an instance of gallantry to some of her
paramours<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 198.</NOTE>. He immediately retired from the place;
sent orders to confine her to her chamber; arrested
Norris, Brereton, Weston, and Smeton, together with
her brother, Rocheford; and threw them into prison.
The Queen, astonished at these instances of his fury,
thought that he meant only to try her; but finding him
in earnest, she reflected on his obstinate unrelenting spirit,
and she prepared herself for that melancholy doom, which
<PB N="169" REF="185"/>
was awaiting her. Next day, she was sent to the Tower;
and on her way thither, she was informed of her supposed
offences, of which she had been hitherto ignorant: She
made earnest protestations of her innocence; and when
she entered the prison, she fell on her knees, and prayed
God so to help her, as she was not guilty of the crime
imputed to her. Her surprize and confusion threw her
into histerical disorders; and in that situation, she thought
that the best proof of innocence was to make an entire
consession, and she discovered some indiscretions and le∣vities,
which her simplicity had equally betrayed her to
commit and to avow. She owned, that she had once
rallied Norris on his delaying his marriage, and had told
him, that he probably expected her, when she should be
a widow: She had reproved Weston, she said, for his
affection to a kinswoman of hers, and his indifference
towards his wife: But he told her, that she had mistaken
the object of his affection, for it was herself: Upon
which, she defied him<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 281.</NOTE>. She affirmed, that Smeton had
never been in her chamber but twice when he played on
the harpsichord: But she acknowledged, that he had once
had the boldness to tell her, that a look sufficed him.
The King, instead of being satisfied with the candour
and sincerity of her confession, regarded these indis∣cretions
only as preludes to greater and more criminal
intimacies.</P>
<P>OF all those multitudes, whom the beneficence of the
Queen's temper had obliged, during her prosperous for∣tune,
no one durst interpose between her and the King's
fury; and the person, whose advancement every breath
had favoured, and every countenance had smiled upon,
was now left neglected and abandoned. Even her uncle
the duke of Norfolk, preferring the connexions of party
<PB N="170" REF="186"/>
to the ties of blood, was become her most dangerous
enemy; and all the retainers to the catholic religion
hoped, that her death would terminate the King's quar∣rel
with Rome, and leave him again to his natural and
early bent, which had inclined him to support the most
intimate connexions with the apostolic see. Cranmer
alone, of all the Queen's adherents, still retained his
friendship for her; and, as far as the King's impetuosity
permitted him, he endeavoured to moderate the violent
prejudices, entertained against her.</P>
<P>THE Queen herself wrote Henry a letter from the
Tower, full of the most tender expostulations, and of the
warmest protestations of innocence. It contains so much
nature and even elegance, as to deserve to be transmitted
to posterity, without any alteration of the expression. It
is as follows.</P>
<P>“SIR, your grace's displeasure and my imprisonment
are things so strange unto me, as what to write, or
what to excuse, I am altogether ignorant. Whereas
you send unto me (willing me to confess a truth, and so
obtain your favour) by such an one, whom you know
to be mine antient professed enemy, I no sooner re∣ceived
this message by him, than I rightly conceived
your meaning; and, if, as you say, confessing a truth
indeed may procure my safety, I shall with all wil∣lingness
and duty perform your command.”</P>
<P>“BUT let not your grace ever imagine, that your
poor wife will ever be brought to acknowledge a fault,
where not so much as a thought thereof preceded.
And to speak a truth, never prince had wife more
loyal in all duty, and in all true affection, than you
have ever found in Anne Boleyn: With which name
and place I could willingly have contented myself,
<PB N="171" REF="187"/>
if God and your grace's pleasure had been so pleased.
Neither did I at any time so far forget myself in my
exaltation or received queenship, but that I always
looked for such an alteration as I now find; for the
ground of my preferment being on no surer foundation
than your grace's fancy, the least alteration I knew
was fit and sufficient to draw that fancy to some other
object. You have chosen me from a low estate to be
your Queen and companion, far beyond my desert or
desire. If then you found me worthy of such honour,
good your grace let not any light fancy, or bad coun∣sel
of mine enemies, withdraw your princely favour
from me; neither let that stain, that unworthy stain,
of a disloyal heart towards your good grace, ever cast
so foul a blot on your most dutiful wife, and the in∣fant-princess
your daughter. Try me, good King,
but let me have a lawful trial, and let not my sworn
enemies sit as my accusers and judges; yea let me
receive an open trial, for my truth shall fear no open
shame; then shall you see either mine innocence
cleared, your suspicion and conscience satisfied, the
ignominy and slander of the world stopped, or my
guilt openly declared. So that whatsoever God or
you may determine of me, your grace may be freed
from an open censure, and mine offence being so
lawfully proved, your grace is at liberty, both before
God and man, not only to execute worthy punish∣ment
on me as an unlawful wife, but to follow your
affection, already settled on that party, for whose sake
I am now as I am, whose name I could some good
while since have pointed unto, your grace not being
ignorant of my suspicion therein.”</P>
<P>“BUT if you have already determined of me, and
that not only my death, but an infamous slander must
<PB N="172" REF="188"/>
bring you the enjoying of your desired happiness;
then I desire of God, that he will pardon your great
sin therein, and likewise mine enemies, the instruments
thereof, and that he will not call you to a strict ac∣count
for your unprincely and cruel usage of me, at
his general judgment-seat, where both you and my∣self
must shortly appear, and in whose judgment I
doubt not (whatsoever the world may think of me)
mine innocence shall be openly known, and sufficiently
cleared.”</P>
<P>“MY last and only request shall be, that myself may
only bear the burden of your grace's displeasure, and
that it may not touch the innocent souls of those poor
gentlemen, who (as I understand) are likewise in
strait imprisonment for my fake. If ever I have found
favour in your sight, if ever the name of Anne Boleyn
hath been pleasing in your ears, then let me obtain
this request, and I will so leave to trouble your grace
any further, with mine earnest prayers to the Trinity
to have your grace in his good keeping, and to direct
you in all your actions. From my doleful prison in
the Tower, this sixth of May;”</P>

and ever faithful wife,”

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>THIS letter had no influence on the unrelenting mind
of Henry, who was determined to pave the way for his
new marriage by the death of Anne Boleyn. Norris,
Weston, Brereton, and Smeton, were tried; but no legal
evidence was produced against them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Her trial.</NOTE> The chief proof
of their guilt consisted in a hear-say report from one lady
Wingfield, who was dead. Smeton was prevailed on,
by the vain hope of life, to confess a criminal correspon∣dence
<PB N="173" REF="189"/>
with the Queen<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. pi 202.</NOTE>; but even her enemies expected
little advantage from this confession: For they never
dared to confront him with her; and he was immediately
executed; as were also Brereton and Weston. Norris
had been much in the King's favour; and an offer was
made him of life, if he would confess his crime, and
accuse the Queen: But he generously rejected that propo∣sal;
and said, that in his conscience he believed her en∣tirely
guiltless: But, for his part, he could accuse her of
nothing, and he would die a thousand deaths rather than
calumniate an innocent person.</P>
<P>THE Queen and her brother were tried by a jury of
peers, consisting of the duke of Suffolk, the marquis of
Exeter, the earl of Arundel, and twenty-three more:
Their uncle, the duke of Norfolk, presided as lord high
steward. Upon what proof or pretence the crime of in∣cest
was imputed to them is unknown: The chief evi∣dence,
it is said, amounted to no more than that Roche∣ford
had been seen to lean on her bed before some com∣pany.
Part of the charge against her was, that she had
affirmed to her minions, that the King never had her
heart; and had said to each of them apart, that she loved
him better than any person whatsoever: <HI>Which was to the
slander of the issue begot between the King and her:</HI> By this
strained interpretation, her guilt was brought under the
statute of the 25th of this reign; in which it was declared
criminal to throw any slander upon the King, Queen,
or their issue. Such palpable absurdities were, at that
time, admitted, and they were regarded by the peers of
England as a sufficient reason for sacrificing an innocent
Queen to the cruelty of their tyrant. Though unassisted
by counsel, she defended herself with great judgment and
presence of mind; and the spectators could not forbear
pronouncing her entirely innocent. Judgment, however,
<PB N="174" REF="190"/>
was given by the court, both against the Queen and
lord Rocheford; and her verdict contained, that she
should be burned or beheaded at the King's pleasure.
When this dreadful sentence was pronounced, she was
not terrified, but lifting up her hands to heaven, said,
“O! Father, O! Creator, thou who art the way, the
truth, and the life, thou knowest that I have not
deserved this death.” And then turning to the
judges, made the most pathetic declarations of her inno∣cence.</P>
<P>HENRY, not satisfied with this cruel vengeance, was
resolved entirely to annul his marriage with Anne Boleyn,
and to declare her issue illegitimate: He recalled to his
memory, that, a little after her appearance in the English
court, some attachment had been acknowledged between
her and the earl of Northumberland, then lord Piercy;
and he now questioned the nobleman with regard to these
engagements. Northumberland took an oath before the
two archbishops, that no contract nor promise of marriage
had ever passed between them: He received the sacra∣ment
upon it, before the duke of Norfolk and others of
the privy council; and this solemn act he accompanied
with the most solemn protestations of his veracity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 384.</NOTE>. The
Queen, however, was shaken by menaces, of executing
the sentence against her in its greatest rigour, and was
prevailed on to confess in court, some lawful impediment
to her marriage with the King<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 94.</NOTE>. The afflicted primate,
who sat as judge, thought himself obliged by this confes∣sion,
to pronounce the marriage null and invalid. Henry,
in the transports of his fury, did not perceive that his pro∣ceedings
were totally inconsistent, and that if her marriage
was, from the beginning, invalid, she could not possibly
be guilty of adultery.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="191"/>
THE Queen now prepared for suffering that death
to which she was sentenced. She sent her last message
to the King, and acknowledged the obligations which
she owed him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And execu∣tion.</NOTE> in continuing thus uniformly his endea∣vours
for her advancement: From a private gentle wo∣man,
she said, he had first made her a marchioness, then
a queen, and now, since he could raise her no higher in
this world, he was sending her to be a saint in heaven:
She then renewed the protestations of her innocence, and
recommended her daughter to his care. Before the
lieutenant of the Tower, and all who approached her,
she made the like declarations; and continued to behave
herself with her usual serenity, and even with chearful∣ness.
“The executioner,” she said to the lieutenant,
is, I hear, very expert; and my neck is very slender:”
Upon which she grasped it in her hand, and laughted
heartily.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th May.</NOTE> When brought, however, to the scaffold, she
softened her tone a little with regard to her protestations
of innocence. She probably reflected, that the obsti∣nacy
of Queen Catherine, and her resistance to the
King's will, had much alienated him from the lady
Mary; and her maternal concern, therefore, for Eliza∣beth,
prevailed in these last moments over that indigna∣tion,
which the unjust sentence, by which she suffered,
naturally excited in her. She said, that she was come
to die, as she was sentenced, by the law: She would
accuse none, nor say any thing of the ground upon
which she was judged. She prayed heartily for the
King; and called him a most merciful and gentle prince,
and acknowledged, that he had always been to her a
good and gracious sovereign; and if any one should
think proper to canvass her cause, she desired him to
judge the best<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 205.</NOTE>. She was beheaded by the executioner
<PB N="176" REF="192"/>
of Calais, who was brought over as more expert than
any in England. Her body was negligently thrown in∣to
a common chest of elm-tree, made to hold arrows;
and was buried in the Tower.</P>
<P>THE innocence of this unfortunate Queen cannot
reasonably be called in question. Henry himself, in the
violence of his rage, knew not whom to accuse as her
lover; and though he imputed guilt to her brother, and
four persons more, he was able to bring proof against
none of them. The whole tenour of her conduct for∣bids
us to ascribe to her an abandoned character, such as
is implied in the King's accusation; and had she been so
lost to all prudence and sense of shame, she must have
exposed herself to detection, and afforded her enemies
the clearest evidence against her. But the King made
the most effectual apology for her, by marrying Jane
Seymour the very day after her execution<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 207.</NOTE>. His im∣patience
to gratify this new passion, caused him to forget
all regard to decency; and his cruel heart was not sof∣tened
a moment by the bloody catastrophe of a person,
who had so long been the object of his most tender
affections.</P>
<P>THE lady Mary thought the death of her step-mother
a proper opportunity for reconciling herself with the
King, who, besides other causes of disgust, had been of∣fended
with her, on account of the part which she had
taken in her mother's quarrel. Her advances were not
at first received; and Henry exacted from her some fur∣ther
proofs of submission and obedience: He required
this young princess, then about twenty years of age, to
adopt his theological tenets; to acknowledge his supre∣macy;
to renounce the pope; and to own her mother's
marriage to be incestuous and unlawful. These points
<PB N="177" REF="193"/>
were of hard digestion with the princess; but after some
delays, and even refusals, she was at last prevailed with
to write a letter to her father<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 207. Strype, vol. i. p. 285.</NOTE>, containing her assent to
the articles required of her: Upon which she was re∣ceived
into favour. But notwithstanding the return of
the King's affection to the issue of his first marriage, he
divested not himself of kindness towards the lady Eliza∣beth;
and the new Queen, who was blest with a sin∣gular
sweetness of disposition, discovered strong proofs of
attachment to that young princess.</P>
<P>THE trial and conviction of Queen Anne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th June. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and the
subsequent events, made it necessary for the King to
summon a new Parliament; and he here, in his speech,
made a merit to his people, that, notwithstanding his
misfortunes in his two former marriages, he had been
induced, for their good, to venture on a third. The
speaker received this prosession with suitable gratitude;
and he took thence occasion to praise the King for his
wonderful gifts of grace and nature: He compared him,
for justice and prudence, to Solomon; for strength and
fortitude to Sampson; and for beauty and comeliness to
Absalom. The King very humbly replied, by the mouth
of his chancellor, that he disavowed these praises; since,
if he was really possessed of such virtues, they were the
gifts of Almighty God only. Henry found that the
Parliament were equally submissive in deeds as complaisant
in their expressions, and that they would go the same
lengths as the former in gratifying even his most lawless
passions. His divorce from Anne Boleyn was ratified;
that Queen, and all her accomplices, were attainted; the
issue of both the two former marriages were declared
illegitimate, and it was even made treason to assert the
legitimacy of either of them; to throw any slander upon
<PB N="178" REF="194"/>
the present King, Queen, or their issue, was subjected
to the same penalty; the crown was settled on the King's
issue by Jane Seymour, or any subsequent wife; and in
case he should die without children, he was impowered
by his will, or letters patent, to dispose of the crown:
An enormous concession<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The King is thought to have had a design of leaving the crown, in case of the failure of his lawful male issue, to his favourite son the duke of Richmond. But the death of that promising nobleman which happened soon after, disappointed all projects in his favour. Heylin, p. 6.</NOTE>, especially when entrusted to a
prince so violent and capricious in his humour. Who∣ever
being required, refused to answer upon oath to any
article of this act of settlement, was declared to be guilty
of treason; and by this clause a species of political in∣quisition
was established in the kingdom, as well as the
accusations of treason multiplied to an unreasonable de∣gree.
The King was also empowered to confer on any
one, by his will, or letters patent, any castles, honours,
liberties, or franchises; words which might have been
extended to the dismembring the kingdom, by the erec∣tion
of principalities and independant jurisdictions. It
was also, by another act, made treason to marry, without
the King's consent, any princess related in the first de∣gree
to the crown. This act was occasioned by the dis∣covery
of a design, formed by Thomas Howard, brother
to the duke of Norfolk, to espouse the lady Margaret
Douglas, niece to the King by his sister the Queen of
Scots and the earl of Angus. Howard, as well as the
young lady, was committed to the Tower. She re∣covered
her liberty soon after; but he died in confine∣ment.
An act of attainder passed against him this session
of parliament.</P>
<P>A NEW accession was likewise gained to the authority
of the crown: The King or any of his successors was
<PB N="179" REF="195"/>
empowered to repeal or annul, by letters patent, what∣ever
acts of parliament had been passed before he was
four and twenty years of age. Whoever maintained the
authority of the bishop of Rome, by word or writ, or
endeavoured in any manner to restore it in England, was
subjected to the penalty of a premunire; that is, his
goods were forfeited, and he was put out of the protection
of the laws. And any person who possessed any office,
ecclesiastical or civil, or received any grant or charter
from the crown; and yet refused to renounce the pope
by oath, was declared to be guilty of treason. The
renounciation prescribed runs in the style of <HI>So help me
God, all saints, and the holy evangelists</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">28 Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>. The pope, hear∣ing
of Anne Boleyn's disgrace and death, hoped that the
door was opened to a reconciliation, and had been making
some advances to Henry: But this was the reception he
met with. Henry was now become absolutely indifferent
with regard to papal censures; and finding a great increase of
authority, as well as revenue, to accrue from his quar∣rel
with Rome, he was determined to persevere in his
present measures. This Parliament also, even more
than any foregoing, convinced him how much he com∣manded
the respect of his subjects, and what confidence
he might repose in them. Tho' the elections had been
made of a sudden, without any preparation or intrigue,
the members discovered an unlimited attachment to his
person and government<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 212.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE extreme complaisance of the convocation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A convo∣cation.</NOTE> which
sat at the same time with the Parliament, encouraged him
in his resolution of breaking entirely with the court of
Rome. There was a division of sentiments in the minds
of this assembly; and as the zeal of the reformers had
been augmented by some late successes, the resentment
<PB N="180" REF="196"/>
of the catholics was no less excited by their fears and
losses: But the authority of the King kept every one
submissive and silent; and the new-assumed prerogative,
the supremacy, whose limits no one was fully acquainted
with, restrained even the most furious movements of theo∣logical
rancour. Cromwel sat as vicar-general; and tho'
the catholic party expected, that, on the fall of Queen
Anne, his authority would receive a great check, they
were surprized to find him still maintain equal credit as
before. With the vicar general concurred Cranmer the
primate, Latimer bishop of Worcester, Shaxton of Salis∣bury,
Hilsey of Rochester, Fox of Hereford, Barlow of
St. David's. The opposite party were led by Lee arch∣bishop
of York, Stokesley bishop of London, Tonstal of
Durham, Gardiner of Winchester, Longland of Lincoln,
Sherborne of Chichester, Nix of Norwich, and Kite of
Carlisle. The former party, by their opposition to the
pope, seconded the King's ambition and love of power:
The latter party, by maintaining the antient theological
tenets, were more conformable to his speculative prin∣ciples:
And both of them had alternately the advantage
of gaining on his humour, by which he was more govern∣ed
than by either of these motives.</P>
<P>THE church in general was averse to the reformation;
and the lower house of convocation framed a list of
opinions, in the whole sixty-seven, which they pro∣nounced
erroneous, and which was a collection of prin∣ciples,
same held by the ancient Lollards, others by the
modern protestants, or Gospellers, as they were some∣times
called. This catalogue they sent to the upper
house to be censured; but in the preamble of their repre∣sentation,
they discovered the servile spirit by which they
were governed. They said, “that they intended not
to do or speak any thing which might be unpleasant to
the King, whom they acknowledge their supreme head,
<PB N="181" REF="197"/>
and whose commands they were resolved to obey; re∣nouncing
the pope's usurped authority, with all his
laws and inventions, now extinguished and abolished;
and addicting themselves to Almighty God and his
laws, and unto the King and the laws made within
this kingdom<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 119.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE convocation came at last, after some debate, to
decide articles of religion; and their tenets were of as
compounded a nature as the assembly itself, or rather as
the King's system of theology, by which they were re∣solved
entirely to square their principles. They deter∣mined
the standard of faith to consist in the Scriptures and
the three creeds, the Apostolic, the Nicene, and the
Athanasian; and this article was a signal victory to the
reformers: Auricular confession and penance were ad∣mitted,
a doctrine agreeable to the catholics: No men∣tion
was made of marriage, extreme unction, confirma∣tion,
or holy orders, as sacraments; and in this omission
the influence of the protestants appeared. The real pre∣sence
was asserted, consormable to the antient doctrine:
The terms of acceptance were established to be the merits
of Christ, and the mercy and good pleasure of God, suit∣able
to the new principles.</P>
<P>SO far the two fects seem to have made a fair partition,
by sharing alternately the several clauses. In framing
the subsquent articles, each of them seems to have
thrown in their ingredient. The catholics prevailed in
asserting, that the use of images was warranted by Scrip∣ture;
the protestants, in warning the people against ido∣latry,
and the abuse of these sensible representations.
The ancient faith was adopted in maintaining the ex∣pediency
of praying to saints; the late innovations in
<PB N="182" REF="198"/>
rejecting the peculiar patronage of saints to any trade,
profession, or course of action. The former rites of wor∣ship,
the use of holy water, the ceremonies practised on
Ash-wednesday, Palm-sunday, and Good-friday, &amp;c.
were still maintained; but the new refinements were also
adopted, which made light of these institutions, by the
convocation's denying that they had any immediate
power of remitting sin and by its asserting that their sole
merit consisted in promoting pious and devout dispositions
in the mind.</P>
<P>BUT the article with regard to purgatory, contains
the most curious jargon, ambiguity and hesitation, aris∣ing
from the mixture of opposite tenets. It was to this
purpose: “Since according to due order of charity, and
the book of Maccabees, and divers antient authors, it
is a very good and charitable deed to pray for souls
departed; and since such a practice has been main∣tained
in the church from the beginning; all bishops
and teachers should instruct the people not to be
grieved for the continuance of the same. But since
the place where departed souls are retained, before
they reach Paradise, as well as the nature of their pains,

convenient to commend the deceased, trusting that he

<P>THESE articles, when framed by the convocation, and
corrected by the King, were subscribed by every member
of that assembly; while, perhaps, neither there nor
throughout the whole kingdom, could one man be found,
except the King himself, who had adopted precisely these
very doctrines and opinions. For though there be not
any contradiction in the tenets here advanced, it had
<PB N="183" REF="199"/>
happened in England, as in all other states where factious
divisions have place; a certain creed was embraced by
each party; few neuters were to be found; and these
consisted only of speculative or whimsical people, of
whom two persons could scarce be brought to an agree∣ment
in the same dogmas. The protestants, all of them,
carried their opposition to Rome farther than these ar∣ticles:
None of the catholics went so far: And the
King, by being able to retain the nation in such a deli∣cate
medium, displayed the utmost power of an imperious
despotism, of which any history furnishes an example.
To change the religion of a country, even when seconded
by a party, is one of the most perilous enterprizes, which
any sovereign can attempt, and often proves the most
destructive to royal authority. But Henry was able to set
the political machine in that furious movement, and yet
regulate and even stop its career: He could say to it, thus
farshalt thou go and no farther: And he made every vote
of his parliament and convocation subservient, not only
to his interests and passions, but even to his smallest
caprices; nay, to his most refined and most scholastic
subtilties.</P>
<P>THE concurrence of these two national assemblies
served, no doubt, to increase the King's power among
the people, and raised him to an authority more absolute,
than any prince, in a simple monarchy, even by means
of military force, is ever able to attain. But there are
certain bounds, beyond which the most flavish submis∣sion
cannot be extended. All the late innovations, par∣ticularly
the dissolution of the smaller monasteries, and
the imminent danger to which all the rest were exposed<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">A proposal had formerly been made in the convocation for the abolition of the lesser monasteries; and had been much opposed by bishop fisher, who was then alive. He told his brethren, that this was fairly showing the King the way, how he might come at the greater mo∣nasteries. “An ax, which wanted a handle, came upon a time into the wood, making his moan to the great trees, that he wanted a handle to work withal, and for that cause he was constrained to sit idle; therefore he made it his request to them, that they would be pleased to grant him one of their small saplings within the wood to make him a handle; who, mistrusting no guile, granted him one of their smaller trees to make him a handle. But now becoming a compleat ax, he fell so to work, within the same wood, that, in process of time, there was neither great nor small trees to be found in the place, where the wood stood. And so, my lords, if you grant the King these smaller monasteries, you do but make him a handle, whereby, at his own pleasure, he may cut down all the cedars within your Lebanons.” Dr. Bailie's life of bishop Fisher, p. 108.</NOTE>

had bred discontent in the people, and disposed them
to a revolt. The expelled monks, wandering about the
country, excited both men's piety and compassion; and as
the antient religion laid hold of the populace by powerful
motives, suited to their capacity, it was able, now that it
was brought into apparent hazard, to excite the strongest
zeal in its favour<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 249.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents among the people.</NOTE> Discontents had even reached some
of the nobility and gentry, whose ancestors had founded
the monasteries, and who placed a vanity in those insti∣tutions,
as well as reaped some benefit from them, by
the provisions, which they afforded them for their younger
children. The more superstitious were interested in the
fate of their forefathers souls, which, they believed, must
now lye, during many ages, in the torments of purga∣tory,
for want of masses to relieve them. It seemed un∣just
to abolish pious institutions for the faults, real or
pretended, of individuals. Even the most moderate and
reasonable thought it somewhat iniquitous, that men,
who had been invited into a course of life by all the
laws, human and divine, which prevailed in their country,
should be turned out of their possessions, and so little care
be taken of their future subsistance. And when it was
<PB N="185" REF="203"/>
observed, that the rapacity and bribery of the commissi∣oners
and others employed in visiting the monasteries,
intercepted much of the profits resulting from these
confiscations, it tended much to increase the general dis∣content<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p, 223.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the people did not break out into open sedition,
till the complaints of the secular clergy concurred with
those of the regular. As Cromwel's person was very little
acceptable to the ecclesiastics; the authority, which he
exercised, being so new, so absolute, so unlimited, in∣spired
them with great disgust and terror. He published,
in the King's name, without the consent either of par∣liament
or convocation, an ordonance, by which he re∣trenched
a great many of the antient holydays; prohi∣bited
several superstitions, gainful to the clergy, such as
pilgrimages, images, reliques; and even ordered the
incumbents in the parishes to set apart a considerable
portion of their revenues for repairs and for the support
of exhibitioners and the poor of their parish. The secular
priests, finding themselves thus reduced to a grievous
slavery, instilled into the people those discontents, which
they had long harboured in their own bosoms.</P>
<P>THE first rising was in Lincolnshire. It was headed
by Dr. Mackrel, prior of Barlings, who was disguised
like a mean mechanic, and who bore the name of cap∣tain
Cobler. This tumultuary army amounted to above
20,000 men<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 227. Herbert.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣tion.</NOTE> but notwithstanding their number, they
showed little disposition of proceeding to extremities
against the King, and seemed still over-awed by his au∣thority.
They acknowledged him to be supreme head
of the church of England: but they complained of his
suppressing the monasteries, of evil counsellers, of men
<PB N=" 186" REF="204"/>
of mean birth entrusted by him, of the danger to which
the jewels and plate of their parochial churches were
exposed: And they prayed him to consult the nobility
of the realm concerning the redress of these grievances<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 410.</NOTE>.
The King was little disposed to entertain apprehensions
of danger, especially from a low multitude, whom he
despised. He sent forces against the rebels under the
command of the duke of Suffolk;<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Oc∣tober.</NOTE> and he returned them
a very sharp answer to their petition. There were some
gentry, whom the populace had forced to take party with
them, and who kept a secret correspondence with Suf∣folk.
They informed him, that resentment against the
King's reply was the chief cause, which retained the
malecontents in arms, and that a milder answer would
probably dissipate the rebellion. Henry had levied a great
force at London, with which he was preparing to march
against the rebels; and being so well supported by power,
he thought, that, without losing his dignity, he might
now show them some greater condescension. He sent
a new proclamation, requiring them to return to their
obedience, with secret assurances of pardon. This ex∣pedient
had its effect: The populace were dissipated:
Mackrel and some of their leaders fell into the King's
hands, and were executed: The greater part of the mul∣titude
retired peaceably to their usual occupations: A few
of the more obstinate fled into the North, where they
joined the insurrection, that was raised in those parts.</P>
<P>THE northern rebels, as they were more numerous,
were also more formidable than those of Lincolnshire,
because the people in those parts were more accustomed
to arms, and because of the near neighbourhood to Scot∣land,
which might make advantage of these disorders.
One Aske, a gentleman, had taken the command of
<PB N="187" REF="205"/>
them, and he possessed the art of governing the populace.
Their enterprize they called the <HI>Pilgrimage of Grace:</HI>
Some priests marched before in the habits of their order,
carrying crosses in their hands: In their banners was
wove a crucifix, with the representation of a chalice, and
of the five wounds of Christ<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 992.</NOTE>: They wore on their sleeve
an emblem of the five wounds, with the name of Jesus
wrought in the midst: They all took an oath, that they
had entered into the pilgrimage of grace from no other
motive, than their Jove to God, their care of the King's
person and issue, their desire of purifying the nobility, of
driving base-born persons from about the King, of restor∣ing
the church, and of suppressing heresy. Allured by
these fair pretences, about 40,000 men from the counties
of York, Durham, Lancaster, and those northern pro∣vinces,
flocked to their standard; and their zeal, no less
than their numbers, inspired the court with apprehen∣sions.</P>
<P>THE earl of Shrewsbury, moved by his regard for the
King's service, raised forces, though at first without any
commission, in order to oppose the rebels. The earl of
Cumberland repulsed them from his castle of Skipton:
Sir Ralph Evers defended Scarborow-castle against them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 574. Baker, p. 258.</NOTE>:
Courtney, marquis of Exeter, the King's cousin-german,
obeyed orders from court, and levied troops. The earls
of Huntingdon, Derby, and Rutland, imitated his ex∣ample.
The rebels, however, prevailed in taking both
Hull and York: They laid siege to Pomfret castle, into
which the archbishop of York and lord Darcy had
thrown themselves. It was soon surrendered to them;
and the prelate and nobleman, who secretly favoured
the cause, seemed to yield to the force imposed on them,
and joined the rebels.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="206"/>
THE duke of Norfolk was named general in chief
of the King's forces against the northern rebels; and as
he headed the party, which supported the antient reli∣gion,
he was also suspected of bearing some favour to the
cause, which he was sent to oppose. His prudent con∣duct,
however, seems to acquit him of this imputation.
He encamped at Doncaster, together with the earl of
Shrewsbury; and as his army was small, scarce exceed∣ing
five thousand men, he made choice of a post, where
he had the river in front, the ford of which he proposed
to defend against the rebels. They had intended to at∣tack
him in the morning; but during the night, there
fell such violent rains as rendered the river utterly im∣passible;
and Norfolk very wisely laid hold of the oppor∣tunity
to enter into treaty with them. In order to
open the door for negotiation, he sent them a herald;
whom Aske, their leader, received with great ceremony;
he himself sitting in a chair of state, with the archbishop
of York on one hand, and lord Darcy on the other. It
was agreed that two gentlemen should be dispatched
to the King with proposals from the rebels; and Henry
protracted giving an answer, and allured them with hopes
of entire satisfaction, in expectation that necessity would
soon oblige them to disperse themselves. Being inform∣ed,
that his artifice had in a great measure succeeded, he
required them instantly to lay down their arms and sub∣mit
to mercy; promising a pardon to all except six whom
he named, and four whom he reserved to himself
the power of naming. But tho' the greatest part of the
rebels had gone home for want of subsistence, they had
entered into the most solemn engagements to return to
their standards, in case the King's answer should not
prove satisfactory. Norfolk, therefore, soon found him∣self
in the same difficulty as before; and he opened
again a negotiation with the leaders of the multitude.
<PB N="189" REF="207"/>
He engaged them to send three hundred persons to Don∣caster,
with proposals for an accommodation; and he
hoped to be able, by intrigue and separate interests, to
throw dissention among so great a number. Aske him∣self
had proposed to be one of the deputies, and he re∣quired
a hostage for his security: But the King, when
consulted, replied, that he knew no gentleman or other,
whom he esteemed so little as to put him in pledge for
such a villain. The demands of the insurgents were
so exorbitant, that Norfolk rejected them; and they
prepared again to decide the contest by force of arms.
They were as formidable as ever both by their numbers
and spirit; and notwithstanding a small river, which
lay between them and the royal army, Norfolk had great
reason to dread the effects of their fury. But while they
were preparing to pass the ford, rain fell a second time
in such abundance, as made it impracticable for them
to execute their design; and the populace, partly re∣duced
to necessity by the want of provisions, partly struck
with superstition at being thus again disappointed by
the same accident, suddenly dispersed themselves. The
duke of Norfolk, who had received powers for that end,
forwarded the dispersion, by the promise of a general
amnesty;<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of December.</NOTE> and the King ratified this act of clemency.
He published, however, a manifesto against the rebels,
and an answer to their complaints; where he employed
a very lofty style, suited to so haughty a monarch. He
told them, that they ought no more to pretend giving a
judgment with regard to government, than a blind man
with regard to colours: “And we,” he added, “with
our whole council, think it right strange, that ye,
who be but brutes and inexpert folk, do take upon
you to appoint us, who be meet or not for our
council.”</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="208"/>
As this pacification was not likely to be of long
continuance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1537.</NOTE> Norfolk was ordered to keep his army to∣gether,
and to go into the northern parts, in order to
exact a general submission. Lord Darcy as well as Aske
were sent for to court; and the former, upon his refusal
or delay to appear, was thrown into prison. Every place
was full of jealousy and complaints. A new insurrection
broke out, headed by Musgrave and Tilby; and the
rebels besieged Carlisle with 8000 men. Being repulsed
by that town, they were encountered in their retreat by
Norfolk, who put them to flight; and having made pri∣soners
of all their officers, except Musgrave, who escap∣ed,
he instantly put them to death by martial law, to
the number of seventy persons. An attempt made by Sir
Francis Bigot and Halam to surprize Hull, met with no
better success; and several other risings were suppressed
by the viligance of Norfolk. The King, enraged by these
multiplied revolts, was determined riot to adhere to the
general pardon, which he had granted; and from a
movement of his usual violence, he made the innocent
suffer for the guilty. Norfolk, by command from his
master, spread the royal banner, and, wherever he
thought proper, executed martial law in the punishment
of offenders. Besides Aske, leader of the first insurrec∣tion,
Sir Robert Constable, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Tho∣mas
Piercy, Sir Stephen Hamilton, Nicholas Tempest,
William Lumley, and many others, were thrown into
prison; and most of them were condemned and execu∣ted.
Lord Hussey was found guilty as an accomplice in
the insurrection of Lincolnshire, and was executed at
Lincoln. Lord Darcy, though he pleaded compulsion,
and appealed, for his justification, to a long life, passed
in the service of the crown, was beheaded on Tower∣hill.
Before his execution, he accused Norfolk of ha∣ving
secretly encouraged the rebels; but Henry, either
<PB N="191" REF="209"/>
sensible of that nobleman's great services and convinced
of his fidelity, or afraid to offend one of such extensive
power and great capacity, rejected the information. Be∣ing
now satiated with punishing the rebels, he published
anew a general pardon, to which he faithfully adhered<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 428.</NOTE>; and he erected by patent a court of justice at York, for
deciding law-suits to the northern counties: A demand
which had been made by the insurgents.</P>
<P>SOON after this prosperous success,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 October. Birth of prince Ed∣ward, and death of Q. Jane.</NOTE> an event happened,
which crowned Henry's joy, the birth of a son, who
was baptised under the name of Edward. Yet was not
this happiness complete: The Queen died two days
after<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. ii. p. 5.</NOTE>. But a son had so long been ardently longed for
by Henry, and was now become so necessary, in order
to prevent disputes with regard to the succession, after
the successive illegitimation of the two Princesses, that
the King's affliction was drowned in his joy, and he
expressed great satisfaction on this occasion. The Prince,
not six days old, was created Prince of Wales, Duke of
Cornwal, and Earl of Chester. Sir Edward Seymour,
the Queen's brother, formerly made Lord Beauchamp,
was raised to the dignity of Karl of Hertford. Sir William
Fitz Williams, high admiral, was created Earl of South∣ampton;
Sir William Paulet, Lord St. John; Sir John
Russel, Lord Russel.</P>
<P>THE suppression of the rebellion and the birth of a
son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1538.</NOTE> as they confirmed Henry's authority at home, en∣creased
his consideration among foreign princes, and
made his alliance be courted by all parties. He main∣tained,
however, a neutrality in the wars, which were
carried on, with varied success, and without any deci∣sive
event, between Charles and Francis; and though
inclined more to favour the latter, he determined not to
<PB N="192" REF="210"/>
incur, without necessity, either hazard or expence in his
behalf. A truce, concluded about this time, between
these potentates, and which was afterwards prolonged
for ten years, freed him from all anxiety on account of
his ally, and re-established the tranquillity of Europe.</P>
<P>HENRY was very desirous of cementing an union with
the German protestants; and for that purpose, he sent
Christopher Mount to a congress which they held at
Brunswick; but that minister made no great progress in
his negotiations. The princes desired to know, what
were the articles in their confession which Henry disliked;
and they sent new ambassadors to him, who had orders
both to negotiate and to dispute. They endeavoured to
convince the King, that he was guilty of a mistake, in
administering the eucharist in one kind only, in allowing
of private masses, and in requiring the celibacy of the
clergy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 145. from the Cott. Lib. Cleopatra, E. 5. fol. 173.</NOTE>. Henry would by no means acknowlege any
error in these particulars; and was offended that they
should pretend to prescribe rules to so great a monarch
and theologian. He found arguments and syllogisms
enough to defend his cause; and he dismissed the ambas∣sadors
without coming to any conclusion. Jealous also
lest his own subjects should become such theologians as to
question his tenets, he used great precaution in publishing
that translation of the scripture, which was finished this
year. He would only allow a copy of it to be deposited
in each parish church, where it was fixed by a chain:
And he took care to inform the people by proclamation,
“That this indulgence was not the effect of his duty,
but of his goodness and his liberality to them; who
therefore should use it moderately, for the encrease of
virtue, not of strife: And he ordered that no man
should read the Bible aloud, so as to disturb the priest,
<PB N="193" REF="211"/>
while he sang mass, nor presume to expound doubtful
places, without advice from the learned.” In this
measure, as in the rest, he still halted half way between
the catholics and the protestants.</P>
<P>THERE was only one particular, in which Henry was
quite decisive, because he was there impelled by his ava∣rice,
or more properly speaking, his rapacity, occasioned
by profuseness: This measure was the intire destruction
of the monasteries.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppression of the great∣er monaste∣ries.</NOTE> The present opportunity seemed fa∣vourable
for that great enterprize; while the suppression
of the late rebellion fortified and encreased the royal au∣thority;
and as some of the abbots were suspected of
having encouraged the insurrection, and of corresponding
with the rebels, the King's resentment was farther in∣cited
by that motive. A new visitation was appointed of
all the monasteries in England; and a pretence only
being wanted for their suppression, it was easy for a
prince, possessed of such exorbitant power, and seconding
the present humour of a great part of the nation, to find
or feign one. The abbots and monks knew the danger,
to which they were exposed; and having learned, by the
example of the lesser monasteries, that nothing could
withstand the King's will, they were most of them in∣duced,
in expectation of better treatment, to make a vo∣luntary
resignation of their houses. Where promises
failed of effect, menaces and even extreme violence were
employed; and as several of the abbots, since the breach
with Rome, had been named by the court, with a view
to this event, the King's intentions were the more easily
effectuated. Some also, having secretly embraced the
doctrine of the reformation, were glad to be freed from
their vows; and on the whole, the design was conducted
with such success, that, in less than two years, the King
had got possession of all the monastic revenues.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="212"/>
IN several places, particularly in the county of Oxford,
great interest was made to preserve some convents of
women, who, as they lived in the most irreproachable
manner, justly merited, it was thought, that their houses
should be saved from the general destruction<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 328.</NOTE>. There
appeared also great difference between the case of nuns
and friars; and the one institution might be very laud∣able,
while the other was exposed to much blame. The
males of all ranks, if endowed with industry, might be
of service to the public; and none of them could want
employment, suited to his station and capacity. But a
woman of family, who failed of a settlement in the mar∣ried
state, an accident to which such persons were more
liable than women of lower station, had really no rank
which she properly filled; and a convent was a retreat
both honourable and agreeable, from the inutility and
often want, which attended her situation. But the King
was determined to abolish monasteries of every denomi∣nation;
and probably thought, that these antient esta∣blishments
would be the sooner forgot, if no remains of
them, of any kind, were allowed to subsist in the king∣dom.</P>
<P>THE better to reconcile the people to this great in∣novation,
stories were published of the detestable lives
of the friars in many of the convents; and great care
was taken to defame those whom the court was deter∣mined
to ruin. The reliques also, and superstitions,
which had so long been the object of the people's vene∣ration,
were exposed to their ridicule; and the religious
spirit, now less bent on exterior observances and sensible
objects, was encouraged in this new direction. It is
needless to be particular in such an enumeration: Protes∣tant
historians mention on this occasion with great tri∣umph
the sacred repositories of convents; the parings of
<PB N="195" REF="213"/>
St. Edmond's toes; some of the coals that roasted St.
Laurence; the girdle of the Virgin shown in eleven seve∣ral
places; two or three heads of St. Ursula; the felt of
St. Thomas of Lancaster, an infallible cure for the head∣ach;
part of St. Thomas of Canterbury's shirt, much
reverenced by big-bellied women; some reliques, an ex∣cellent
preventive against rain; others, a remedy to
weeds in corn. But such fooleries, as they are to be
found in all ages and nations of the world, and even
took place during the most refined periods of antiquity,
form no peculiar nor violent reproach on the catholic re∣ligion.</P>
<P>THERE were also discovered, or said to be discovered,
in the monasteries some impostures of a more artificial
nature. At Hales, in the county of Gloucester, had
been shown, during several ages, the blood of Christ
brought from Jerusalem; and it is easy to imagine the
veneration, with which such a relique was regarded. A
miraculous circumstance also attended this miraculous
relique; the sacred blood was not visible to any one in
mortal sin, even when set before him; and till he had
performed good works suffcient for his absolution, it
would not deign to discover itself to him. At the disso∣lution
of the monastery, the whole contrivance was dis∣covered.
Two of the monks, who were let into the
secret, had taken the blood of a duck, which they re∣newed
every week: They put it into a phial, one side of
which consisted of thin and transparent chrystal, the other
of thick and obscure. When any rich pilgrim arrived,
they were sure to show him the dark side of the phial,
till masses and offerings had expiated his offences; and
then finding his money, or patience, or faith, near ex∣hausted,
they made him happy by turning the phial<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 431, 432. Stowe, p. 575.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="214"/>
A MIRACULOUS crucifix had been kept at Boxley in
Kent, and bore the appellation of the <HI>Rood of Grace.</HI>
The lips, and eyes, and head of the image moved on the
approach of its votaries. Hilsey, bishop of Rochester,
broke the crucifix at St. Paul's cross, and shewed the
whole people the springs and wheels by which it had
been secretly moved. A great wooden idol of Wales,
called Darvel Gatherin, was also brought to London,
and cut in pieces: And by a cruel refinement of ven∣geance,
it was employed as fuel to burn fryar Forest<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals. Stowe, p. 575. Herbert. Baker, p. 286.</NOTE>,
who was punished for denying the supremacy, and for
some pretended heresies. A finger of St. Andrew's, co∣vered
with a thin plate of silver, had been pawned by a
convent for a debt of forty pounds; but as the King's
commissioners refused to release the pawn, people made
themselves very merry with the poor creditor, on account
of his security.</P>
<P>BUT of all the instruments of antient superstition, no∣one
was so zealously destroyed as the shrine of Thomas a
Becket, commonly called St. Thomas of Canterbury.
This saint owed his canonization to the zealous defence,
which he had made for the apostolic see; and on that ac∣count
also, the monks had extremely encouraged the de∣votion
of pilgrimages towards his tomb, and numberless
were the miracles, which, they pretended, his reliques
wrought on his devout votaries. They raised his body
once a year; and the day, on which this ceremony was
performed, which was called the day of his translation,
was a general holyday: Every fiftieth year there was ce∣lebrated
a jubilee to his honour, which lasted fifteen days:
Plenary indulgences were then granted to all that visited
his tomb; and a hundred thousand pilgrims have been
registered at a time in Canterbury. The devotion to∣wards
<PB N="197" REF="215"/>
him had quite effaced in that town the adoration
of the Deity; nay, even that of the Virgin. At God's
altar, for instance, there was offered in one year three
pounds two shillings and six-pence; at the Virgin's, sixty∣three
pounds five shillings and six-pence; at St. Tho∣mas's,
eight hundred and thirty-two pounds twelve shil∣lings
and three-pence. But next year, the disproportion
was still greater: There was not a penny offered at God's
altar; the Virgin's gained only four pounds one shilling
and eight-pence; but St. Thomas had got for his share
nine hundred and fifty-four pounds six shillings and
three-pence<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 244.</NOTE>. Lewis the seventh of France had made
a pilgrimage to this miraculous tomb, and had bestowed
on the shrine a jewel, which was esteemed the richest in
Christendom. It is obvious, how obnoxious to Henry a
saint of this character must appear, and how much con∣trary
to all his projects for degrading the authority of the
court of Rome. He not only pillaged the rich shrine,
dedicated to St. Thomas: He made the saint himself be
cited to appear in court, and be tried and condemned as a

<P>ON the whole, the King, at different times, suppressed
six hundred and forty-five monasteries: Of which twenty∣eight
had abbots, who enjoyed a seat in parliament.
Ninety colleges were demolished in several counties; two
thousand three hundred and seventy-four chantries and
free chapels: A hundred and ten hospitals. The whole
revenue of these establishments amounted to one hundred
and sixty-one thousand one hundred pounds<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, Camden, Speed.</NOTE>. It is wor∣thy
of observation, that all the lands and possessions of Eng∣land
<PB N="198" REF="216"/>
had, a little before this period, been rated at three
millions a year; so that the revenues of the monasteries
did not really much exceed the twentieth part of the na∣tional
income: A sum vastly inferior to what is com∣monly
apprehended. The lands belonging to the con∣vents,
were usually let at very low leases; and the far∣mers,
who regarded themselves as a species of proprietors,
took always care to renew their leases before they ex∣pired<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">There is a curious passage, with regard to the suppression of mo∣nasteries, to be found in Coke's Institutes, 4 Inst. chap. 1. p, 44. It is worth transcribing, as it shews the ideas of the English government, entertained during the reign of Henry the eighth, and even in the time of Sir Edward Coke, when he wrote his Institutes. It clearly appears, that the people had then little notion of being jealous of their liberties, were desirous of making the crown quite independent, and wished only to remove from themselves, as much as possible, the burthens of go∣vernment. A large standing army, and a fixed revenue, would, on these conditions, have been regarded as great blessings; and it was owing entirely to the prodigality of Henry, and to his little suspicion, that the power of the crown could ever fail, that the English owe all their liberty. The title of the chapter in Coke is, <HI>Advice concerning new and plausible Projects and Offers in Parliament.</HI> “When any plausible pro∣ject,” says he, “is made in parliament, to draw the lords and commons to assent to any act, (especially in matters of weight and importance) if both houses do give upon the matter projected and promised their consent, it shall be most necessary, they being trusted for the common-wealth, to have the matter projected and promised (which moved the houses to consent) to be established in the same act, least the be∣nefit of the act be taken, and the matter projected and promised never performed, and so the houses of parliament perform not the trust re∣posed in them, as it fell out (taking one example for many) in the reign of Henry the eighth: On the King's behalf, the members of both houses were informed in parliament, that no king or kingdom was safe, but where the King had three abilities; 1. To live of his own, and able to defend his kingdom upon any sudden invasion or insurrection. 2. To aid his confederates, otherwise they would never assist him. 3. To reward his well-deserving servants. Now the project was, that if the parliament would give unto him all the abbies, priories, friories, nunneries, and other monasteries, that, for ever in time then to come, he would take order that the same should not be converted to private uses; but first, that his exchequer for the purposes aforesaid should be enriched; secondly, the king∣dom strengthened by a continual maintenance of forty thousand well-trained soldiers, with skilful captains and commanders; thirdly, for the benefit and ease of the subject, who never afterwards, (as was projected) in any time to come, should be charged with subsidies, fifteenths, loans, or other common aids; fourthly, least the honour of the realm should receive any diminution of honour by the disso∣lution of the said monasteries, there being twenty-nine lords of par∣liament of the abbots and priors, (that held of the King <HI>per baro∣niam,</HI> whereof more in the next leaf) that the King would create a number of nobles, which we omit. The said monasteries were given to the King by authority of divers acts of parliament, but no pro∣vision was therein made for the said project, or any part thereof.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="217"/>
GREAT murmurs were every where excited against
these violences; and men much questioned, whether
priors and monks, who were only trustees or tenants for
life, could by any deed, however voluntary, transfer to
the King the entire property of their estates. In order
to reconcile the people to such mighty innovations, they
were told, that the King would never henceforth have
occasion to levy taxes, but would be able, from the ab∣bey
lands alone, to bear, during war as well as peace,
the whole charges of the government<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Coke's 4th Inst. fol. 44.</NOTE>. While such
topics were employed to pacify the populace, the King
took an effectual method of engaging the nobility and
gentry to take part with his measures<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Warwickshire, p. 800.</NOTE>: He either made
a gift of the revenues of convents to his favourites and
courtiers, or sold them at low prices, or exchanged them
for other lands on very disadvantageous terms. He was
so profuse in these liberalities, that he is said to have
given a woman the whole revenue of a convent, as a
reward for making a pudding, which happened to gratify
his palate<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fuller.</NOTE>. He also settled salaries on the abbots and
<PB N="200" REF="218"/>
priors, proportioned to their former revenues or to their
merits; and gave each monk a yearly pension of eight
marks: He erected six new bishoprics, Westminster,
Oxford, Peterborow, Bristol, Chester, and Gloucester;
of which the last five subsist at this day: And by all these
means of expence and dissipation, the profit which the
King reaped by the seizure of church lands, fell much
short of vulgar opinion. As the ruin of convents had been
foreseen some years ere it happened, the monks had taken
Care to dissipate beforehand most of their stock, furniture,
and plate; so that the spoils of the great monasteries bore
not, in these respects, any proportion to those of the
lesser.</P>
<P>BESIDE the lands, possessed by the monasteries, the
regular clergy enjoyed a considerable part of the benefices
of England, and of the tythes, annexed to them; and
these were also at this time transferred to the crown, and
by that means came, into the hands of laymen: An abuse
which many zealous churchmen regard as the most cri∣minal
sacrilege. The monks were formerly much at
their ease in England, and enjoyed revenues, which
much exceeded the regular and stated expence of the
house. We read of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he abbey of Chertsey in Surrey,
which possest 744 pounds a year, tho' it contained only
fourteen monks: That of Furness, in the county of
Lincoln, was valued at 960 pounds a year, and contain∣ed
but thirty monks<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 237.</NOTE>. In order to dissipate their reve∣nues,
and support popularity, the monasteries lived in a
very hospitable manner; and besides the poor, maintained
from their offals, there were many decayed gentlemen,
who passed their lives in travelling from convent to con∣vent,
and were entirely subsisted at the tables of the
friars. By this hospitality, as much as by their own in∣activity,
did the convents prove nurseries of idleness; but
<PB N="201" REF="219"/>
the King, not to give offence by too sudden an innova∣tion,
bound the new proprietors of abbey lands, to sup∣port
the ancient hospitality. But this engagement was
fulfilled in very few places, and for a very short time.</P>
<P>IT is easy to imagine the indignation with which the
intelligence of all these violences was received at Rome;
and how much the ecclesiastics of that court, who had so
long kept the world in subjection by big founding epi∣thets,
and by holy execrations, would now vent their
rhetoric against the character and conduct of Henry.
The pope was provoked at last to publish the bull, which
he had passed against that monarch; and in a public
manner delivered over his soul to the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l, and his do∣minions
to the first invader. Libels were dispersed, in
which he was compared to the most furious persecutors
in antiquity; and the preference was even given on their
side: He had declared war with the dead, whom the
pagans themselves respected; was at open enmity with
heaven; and had engaged in professed hostility with the
whole host of saints and angels. Above all, he was often
reproached with his resemblance to the emperor Julian,
whom, it was said, he imitated in his apostacy and learn∣ing,
tho' he fell short of him in his morals. Henry
could distinguish in many of these libels the stile and ani∣mosity
of his kinsman, Pole; and he was thence anew
incited to vent his rage, by every possible expedient, on
that famous cardinal.</P>
<P>REGINALD de la Pole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardinal Pole.</NOTE> or Reginald Pole, was de∣scended
of the royal family, being fourth son of the
countess of Salisbury, daughter of the duke of Clarence.
He discovered in very early youth evident symptoms of
that fine genius, and generous disposition, by which,
during his whole life, he was so much distinguished;
and Henry having conceived great friendship for him,
proposed to raise him to the highest ecclesiastical digni∣ties;
<PB N="202" REF="220"/>
and, as a pledge of future favours, he conferred on
him the deanry of Exeter<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals.</NOTE>, in order to help him to bear
the expences of his education. Pole was carrying on his
studies in Paris, at the time when the King solicited the
suffrages of that university in favour of his divorce; but
tho' applied to by the English agent, he declined taking
any part in that affair. Henry bore this neglect with
more temper than was natural to him; and he appeared
unwilling, on that account, to renounce friendship with
a person, whose virtues and talents, he hoped, would
prove useful, as well as ornamental, to his court and
kingdom. He allowed him still to possess his deanry,
and gave him permission to finish his studies at Padua:
He even paid him some court, in order to bring him into
his measures; and wrote to him, while in Italy, desiring
him to give his opinion freely, with regard to the late
measures taken in England, for abolishing the papal au∣thority.
Pole had now entered into an intimate friend∣ship
with whatever was eminent for dignity or merit in
Italy; Sadolet, Bembo, and other reviv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of true taste
and learning; and he was moved by these connections,
as well as by religious zeal, to forget, in some respect,
the duty which he owed to Henry, his benefactor, and
his sovereign. He replied, by writing a treatise of <HI>the
unity of the church,</HI> where he inveighed against the King's
supremacy, his divorce, his second marriage; and even
exhorted the emperor to revenge on him the injury done
to his family, and to the catholic cause. Henry, tho'
provoked beyond measure at this outrage, dissembled his
resentment; and sent a message to Pole, desiring him to
return to England, in order to explain certain passages
of his book, which he found somewhat obscure and dif∣ficult:
But Pole was on his guard against this infidious
invitation; and was determined to remain in Italy,
<PB N="203" REF="221"/>
where he was extremely beloved and esteemed by all the
world.</P>
<P>THE pope and emperor thought themselves obliged to
provide for a man of Pole's eminence and dignity, who,
in support of their cause, had sacrificed all his pretensions
to fortune in his own country. He was created a car∣dinal;
and tho' he took not higher orders than those of a
deacon, he was sent legate into Flanders about the year
1536<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Henry was sensible, that Pole's chief intention
in choosing that employment, was to foment the muti∣nous
disposition of the English catholics; and he there∣fore
remonstrated in such a vigorous manner with the
queen of Hungary, regent of the Low Countries, that
she dismissed the legate, without allowing him to exer∣cise
his commission. The enmity which he bore Pole,
was now open, as well as violent; and the cardinal, on
his part, kept no farther measures in his intrigues against
Henry. He is even suspected of having aspired to the
crown, by means of a marriage with the lady Mary;
and the King was every day alarmed by informations,
which he received, of the correspondence maintained in
England by that fugitive. Courtney, marquis of Exeter,
had entered into a conspiracy with him; Sir Edward
Nevil, brother to the lord Abergavenny, Sir Nicholas
Carew, master of horse, and knight of the garter;
Henry de la Pole, lord Montacute, and Sir Geoffrey de
la Pole, brothers to the cardinal. These persons were
indicted, and tried, and convicted, before lord Audley,
who presided in the trial, as lord high steward. They
were all executed, except Sir Geoffrey de la Pole, who
was pardoned; and he owed this grace to his having
first carried to the King secret intelligence of the con∣spiracy.
We know little of the justice or iniquity of the
sentence pronounced against these men: We only know,
<PB N="204" REF="222"/>
that the condemnation of a man, who was, at that time,
prosecuted by the court, forms no presumption of his
guilt; tho' as no historian of credit mentions, in the
present case, any complaints occasioned by these trials,
we may presume, that sufficient evidence was produced
against the marquis of Exeter, and his associates<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Herbert in Kennet, p. 216.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE rough hand of Henry seemed well adapted for
rending asunder those bands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXII.</NOTE> by which the an∣cient
superstition had fastened itself on the kingdom;
and tho', after renouncing the pope's supremacy, and
suppressing monasteries, most of the political ends of a
reformation were already attained, few people expected,
that he would stop at those innovations. The spirit of
opposition, it was thought, would carry him to the ut∣most
extremity against the church of Rome; and lead
him to declare war against the whole doctrine and wor∣ship,
as well as discipline, of that mighty hierarchy. He
had formerly appealed from the pope to a general coun∣cil;
but now, that a general council was summoned to
meet at Mantua, he previously renounced all submission
to it, as being summoned by the pope, and lying entirely
under subjection to that spiritual usurper. He engaged
his clergy to make a declaration to the like purpose; and
he had prescribed to them many other alterations on an∣cient
tenets and practices. Cranmer took advantage of
every opportunity to carry him on in this course; and
<PB N="206" REF="224"/>
while Queen Jane lived, who favoured the reformers,
he had, by means of her insinuation and address, been
very successful in his endeavours. After her death, Gar∣diner,
who was returned from his embassy to France,
kept the King more in suspence; and by feigning an un∣limited
submission to his will, he was frequently able to
guide him to his own purposes. Fox, bishop of Here∣ford,
had supported Cranmer in his schemes for a more
entire reformation; but his death had made way for the
promotion of Bonner, who, tho' he had hitherto seemed
a furious enemy to the see of Rome, was determined to
sacrifice every thing to present interest, and had joined
the confederacy of Gardiner and the partizans of the old
religion. Gardiner himself, it was believed, had secretly
entered into measures with the pope, and even with the
emperor; and in concert with these powers, he endea∣voured
to preserve, as much as possible, the ancient faith
and worship.</P>
<P>HENRY was so much governed by passion, that no∣thing
could have retarded his animosity and opposition against
Rome, but some other passion, which stopped
his career, and raised him new subjects of animosity.
Tho' he had gradually, since he came to years of matu∣rity,
been changing the tenets of that theological system,
in which he had been educated, he was equally positive
and dogmatical in the few articles which remained to
him, as if the whole fabric had continued entire and
unshaken: And tho' he stood alone in his opinion, the
flattery of courtiers had so enflamed his tyrannical arro∣gance,
that he thought himself entitled to regulate, by
his own particular standard, the religious faith of the
whole nation. The point, on which he chiefly rested
his orthodoxy, happened to be the real presence; that
very doctrine, in which, among the numberless victories
of superstition over common sense, her triumph is the
<PB N="207" REF="225"/>
most signal and egregious. All departure from this prin∣ciple
he held to be heretical and detestable; and nothing,
he thought, would be more honourable for him, than,
while he broke off all connections with the Roman pon∣tiff,
to maintain, in this essential article, the purity of
the catholic faith.</P>
<P>THERE was one Lam∣bert<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 396.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputation with Lambert.</NOTE> a school-master in Lon∣don,
who had been questioned for unsound opinions by
archbishop Warham; but, upon the death of that pre∣late,
and the changing of councils at court, he had been
released. Not terrified with the danger which he had
incurred, he still continued to promulgate his tenets;
and having heard Dr. Taylor, afterwards bishop of Lin∣coln,
defend in a sermon the corporal presence, he could
not forbear expressing to Taylor his dissent from that
doctrine; and he drew up his objections under ten several
heads. Taylor carried the paper to Dr. Barnes, who
happened to be a Lutheran, and who maintained, that,
tho' the substance of bread and wine remained in the sa∣crament,
yet the real body and blood of Christ were there
also, and were, in a certain mysterious manner, incor∣porated
with the material elements. By the present laws
and practice, Barnes was no less exposed to the stake
than Lambert; yet such was the persecuting rage which
prevailed, that he was determined to bring this man to
condign punishment; because, in their common de∣parture
from the ancient faith, he had dared to go one step
farther than himself. He engaged Taylor to accuse
Lambert to Cranmer and Latimer, who, whatever their
private opinion might be on these points, were obliged
to conform themselves to the standard of orthodoxy, esta∣blished
by Henry. When Lambert was cited before
these prelates, they endeavoured to bend him to a recan∣tation;
<PB N="208" REF="226"/>
and they were surprized, when, instead of com∣pliance,
he ventured to appeal to the King.</P>
<P>THE King, not displeased with an opportunity, where
he could at once exert his supremacy, and display his
learning, accepted the appeal; and was determined to
mix, in a very unfair manner, the magistrate with the
disputant. Public notice was given, that he intended to
enter the lists with this school-master: Scaffolds were
erected in Westminster-hall, for the accommodation of
the audience: Henry appeared on his throne, accompa∣nied
with all the ensigns of majesty: The prelates were
placed on his right hand: The temporal peers on his
left. The judges and most eminent lawyers had a place
assigned them behind the bishops: The courtiers of
greatest distinction behind the peers: And in the midst of
this splendid assembly was produced the unhappy Lam∣bert,
and he was required to defend his opinions against
his royal antagonist<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 426.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE bishop of Chichester opened the conference, by
saying, that Lambert, being charged with heretical pra∣vity,
had appealed from his bishop to the King; as if he
expected more favour from this application, and as if the
King could ever be induced to protect a heretic: That
tho' his majesty had thrown off the usurpations of the see
of Rome; had disincorporated some idle monks, who
lived like drones in a bee-hive; had remedied the idola∣trous
worship of images; had published the bible in Eng∣lish,
for the instruction of all his subjects; and had made
some lesser alterations, which every one must approve of;
yet was he determined to maintain the purity of the ca∣tholic
faith, and to punish with the utmost severity all
departure from it: And that he had taken the present
opportunity, before so learned and grave an auditory, of
convincing Lambert of his errors; but if he still perse∣vered
<PB N="209" REF="227"/>
obstinately in them, he must expect the most con∣dign
punishment<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this preamble, which was not very encourag∣ing,
the King asked Lambert, with a stern countenance,
what his opinion was of Christ's corporal presence in the
sacrament of the altar; and when Lambert began his dis∣course
with some compliment to his majesty, he rejected
the praise with disdain and indignation. He afterwards
pressed Lambert with some arguments, drawn from Scrip∣ture
and the schoolmen: The audience applauded the
force of his reasoning, and the extent of his erudition:
Cranmer seconded his proofs by some new topics: Gar∣diner
entered the lifts as a support to Cranmer: Tonstal
took up the argument after Gardiner: Stokesley brought
fresh aid to Tonstal: Six bishops more appeared succes∣sively
in the field after Stokesley. And the disputation,
if it deserves the name, was prolonged for five hours;
till Lambert, fatigued, confounded, brow-beaten, and
abashed, was at last reduced to silence. The King then,
returning to the charge, asked him whether he was con∣vinced?
and he proposed, as a concluding argument,
this interesting question, whether he was resolved to live
or die? Lambert, who possessed that courage which
consists in obstinacy, replied, that he cast himself wholly
on his majesty's clemency: The King told him, that he
would be no protector of heretics; and therefore, if that
was his final answer, he must expect to be committed to
the flames. Cromwel, as vicegerent, read the sentence
against him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Collier, in his ecclesiastical history, vol. II p. 152, has preserved an account which Cromwel gave of this conference, in a letter to Sir Thomas Wyat, the King's embassador in Germany. “The King's majesty,” says Cromwel, “for the reverence of the holy sacrament of the altar, did sit openly in his hall, and there presided at the dispu∣tation, process and judgment of a miserable heretic sacramentary, who was burned the 20th of November. It was a wonder to see how princely, with how excellent gravity, and inestimable majesty his highness exercised there the very office of supreme head of the church of England. How benignly his grace essayed to convert the miserable man: How strong and manifest reasons his highness alledged against him. I wish the princes and potentates of Christendom to have had a meet place to have seen it. Undoubtedly they should have much marvelled at his majesty's most high wisdom and judgment, and reputed him no otherwise after the same, than in a manner the mirror and light of all other kings and princes in Christendom.” It was by such flatteries, that Henry was engaged to make his sentiments the standard to all mankind; and was determined to enforce, by the severest penalties, his <HI>strong</HI> and <HI>manifest</HI> reasons for transubstantia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="228"/>
LAMBERT, whose vanity had probably incited him
the more to persevere on account of the greatness of
this public appearance, was not daunted by the ter∣rors
of that punishment, to which he was condemned.
His executioners took care to make the sufferings of a
man who had personally opposed the King, as cruel as
possible: He was burned at a slow fire; his legs and
thighs were consumed to the stumps; and when there
appeared no end of his tortures, some of the guards, more
merciful than the rest, lifted him on their halberts, and
threw him into the flames, where he was consumed.
While they were employed in this friendly office, he
cried aloud several times, <HI>None but Christ, none but
Christ;</HI> and these words were in his mouth when he
expired<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fox's acts and monuments, p. 427. Burnet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME few days before this execution, four Dutch ana∣baptists,
three men and a woman, had faggots tied to
their backs at Paul's Cross; and were burned in that manner.
And a man and a woman of the same sect
and country, were burned in Smithfreld<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 556.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="229"/>
IT was the unhappy situation of the English, during
that age, that when they laboured under any grievance,
they had not the satisfaction of expecting redress from
Parliament:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1539.</NOTE> On the contrary, they had reason to dread
each meeting of that assembly, and were then sure of
having tyranny converted into law, and aggravated, per∣haps,
with some circumstance, which the arbitrary prince
and his ministers had not hitherto devised, or did not
think proper, of themselves, to carry into execution.
This abject servility never more eminently appeared than
in a new Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment. 28th April.</NOTE> which the King now assembled,
and which, if he had been so pleased, might have been
the last that ever sat in England. But he found them
too useful instruments of dominion ever to entertain
thoughts of giving them a total exclusion.</P>
<P>THE chancellor opened the Parliament by informing
the house of Lords, that it was his majesty's earnest de∣sire,
to extirpate from his kingdom all diversity of opi∣nions
with regard to religion; and as this enterprize was
difficult and important, he desired them to chuse a com∣mittee
among themselves, who might frame certain ar∣ticles,
and communicate them afterwards to the Parlia∣ment.
The lords named the vicar-general, Cromwel,
now created a peer, the archbishops of Canterbury and
York, the bishops of Durham, Carlisle, Worcester, Bath
and Wells, Bangor, and Ely. The house might have
seen what a hopeful task they were undertaking: This
small committee itself was agitated with such diversity of
opinions, that it could come to no conclusion. The
duke of Norfolk then moved in the house, that, since
there were no hopes of having a report from the com∣mittee,
the articles of faith, proposed to be established,
should be reduced to six; and new committees be ap∣pointed
to frame an act with regard to them. As this
<PB N="212" REF="230"/>
peer was understood to speak the King's mind, his motion
was immediately assented to; and, after a short pro∣rogation,
the bill of the <HI>six articles,</HI> or the bloody bill
as the protestants justly termed it, was introduced, and
having passed the two houses, had the King's assent
affixed to it.</P>
<P>IN this law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Law of the six articles.</NOTE> the real presence was established, the
communion in one kind, the perpetual obligation of
vows of chastity, the utility of private masses, the celi∣bacy
of the clergy, the necessity of auricular confession.
The denial of the first article, with regard to the real
presence, subjected the person to death by fire, and to
the same forfeiture as in cases of treason; and admitted
not the privilege of abjuring: An unheard of severity,
and unknown to the inquisition itself. The denial of
any of the other five articles, even though recanted, was
punishable by the forfeiture of goods and chattels, and
imprisonment during the King's pleasure: An obstinate
adherence to error, or a relapse, was adjudged to be fe∣lony,
and punishable with death. The marriage of
priests was subjected to the same punishment. Their
commerce with women, for the first offence, was for∣feiture
and imprisonment; for the second, death. Ab∣staining
from confession, and from receiving the eucharist
at the accustomed times, subjected the person to fine and
imprisonment, during the King's pleasure; and if the
criminal persevered after conviction, he was punishable
by death and forfeiture, as in cases of felony<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII. c. 14. Herbert in Kennet, p. 219.</NOTE>. Com∣missioners
were to be appointed by the King, for en∣quiring
into these heresies and irregular practices, and
the criminals were to be tried by a jury.</P>
<P>THE King, in framing this law, laid his oppressive
hand on both parties; and even the catholics had reason
<PB N="213" REF="231"/>
to complain, that the friars and nuns, though dismissed
their convent, should be capriciously restrained to the
practice of celibacy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">There is a story, that the duke of Norfolk, meeting, soon after this act was passed, one of his chaplains, who was suspected of favouring the reformation, said to him, “Now, Sir, what think you of the law to hinder priests from having wives?” “Yes, my lord,” replies the chaplain, “you have done that; but I will answer for it, you cannot hinder men's wives from having priests.”</NOTE>: But as the protestants were
chiefly exposed to the severity of the act, the misery of
adversaries, according to the usual maxims of party,
was regarded by the adherents to the ancient religion,
as their own prosperity and triumph. Cranmer had the
courage to oppose this bill in the house; and though
the King desired him to absent himself, he could not be
prevailed on to give this proof of compliance<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 249, 270. Fox, vol. ii. p. 1037.</NOTE>. Henry was
accustomed to Cranmer's freedom and sincerity; and be∣ing
convinced of the general rectitude of his intentions,
gave him an unusual indulgence in that particular, and
never allowed even a whisper against him. That pre∣late,
however, was now obliged, in obedience to the sta∣tute,
to dismiss his wife, the niece of Osiander, a famous
divine of Nuremburg<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Herbert in Kennet, p. 219.</NOTE>; and Henry, satisfied with
this proof of submission, showed him his former countenance
and favour. Latimer and Shaxton threw up their bishop∣rics,
on account of this law, and were committed to
prison.</P>
<P>THE Parliament having thus resigned all their eccle∣siastical
liberties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proclama∣tions made equal to laws.</NOTE> proceeded to an entire surrender of their
civil; and without scruple or deliberation they made
by one act a total subversion of the English constitution.
They gave to the King's proclamations the same force
as to a statute enacted by Parliament; and to render

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="214" REF="234"/>
the matter worse, if possible, they framed this law as if
it were only declarative, and were intended to explain the
natural extent of the regal authority. The preamble con∣tains,
that the King had formerly set forth several pro∣clamations,
which froward persons had wilfully con∣temned,
not considering what a King by his royal
power may do; that this licence might encourage of∣fenders
not only to disobey the laws of Almighty God,
but also to dishonour the King's most royal majesty,
<HI>who may full ill bear it;</HI> that sudden emergencies often
occur, which require speedy remedies, and cannot await
the slow assembling and deliberations of Parliament; and
that, though the King was empowered, by his authority,
derived from God, to consult the public good on these
occasions, yet the opposition of refractory subjects might
push him to extremity and violence: For these reasons,
the Parliament, that they might remove all occasion of
doubt, ascertained by a statute this prerogative of the
crown, and enabled his majesty, with the advice of his
council, to set forth proclamations, enjoining obedience
under whatever pains and penalties he shall think proper:
And these proclamations were to have the force of per∣petual
laws<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT shows either a stupid or wilful blindness of the
Parliament is, that they pretended, even after this sta∣tute,
to maintain some limitations in the government;
and they enacted, that no proclamation should deprive
any person of his lawful possessions, liberties, inheritances,
privileges, franchises; nor yet infringe any common law
or laudable custom of the realm. They considered not,
that no pains could be inflicted on the disobedience of
proclamations, without invading some liberty or property
of the subject; and that the power of enacting new
<PB N="215" REF="235"/>
laws, joined to the dispensing power, then exercised by
the crown, amounted to a full legislative authority. It
is true, the Kings of England had been always accus∣tomed,
from their own authority, to issue proclamations,
and to exact obedience to them; and this prerogative
was, no doubt, a strong symptom of absolute govern∣ment:
But still there was a difference between a power,
which was exercised on a particular emergence, and
which must be justified by the present expediency or
necessity; and an authority conferred by a positive
statute, which could no longer admit of controul or
limitation.</P>
<P>COULD any act be more opposite to the spirit of li∣berty
than this law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the suc∣cession.</NOTE> it would have been another of the
same parliament. They passed attainders, not only a∣gainst
the Marquis of Exeter, the Lords Montacute,
Darcy, Hussey, and others, who had been legally tried
and condemned; but also against some persons, of the
highest quality, who had never been accused, or examin∣ed,
or convicted. The violent hatred, which Henry bore
to cardinal Pole, had extended itself to all his friends
and relations; and his mother in particular, the coun∣tess
of Salisbury, had, on that account, become ex∣tremely
obnoxious to him. She was also accused of
having employed her authority with her tenants, to hin∣der
them from perusing the new translation of the Bible;
of having procured bulls from Rome, which, 'tis said,
were found at Coudray, her country seat; of having
kept a correspondence with her son, the cardinal: But
Henry found, either that these offences could not be
proved, or that they would not by law be subject to such
severe punishment as he desired to inflict upon her. He
resolved, therefore, to proceed against her in a more
summary and more tyrannical manner; and for that
purpose, he sent Cromwel, who was but too obsequious
<PB N="216" REF="236"/>
to his will, to demand of the judges, whether the Par∣liament
could attaint a person, who was forth-coming,
without giving him any trial, or citing him to appear
before them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Coke's 4th Inst. p. 37, 38.</NOTE>? The judges replied, that it was a danger∣ous
question, and that the high court of Parliament
ought to give examples to inferior courts of proceeding
according to justice: No inferior court could act in
that arbitrary manner, and they thought that the Parlia∣ment
never would. Being pressed to give a more explicit
answer, they replied, that, if a person were attainted in
that manner, the attainder could never after be brought
in question, but must remain good in law. Henry learn∣ed
by this decision, that such a method of proceeding,
though directly contrary to all the principles of equity,
was yet practicable; and this being all he was anxious
to know, he resolved to employ it against the countess
of Salisbury. Cromwel showed to the house of peers a
banner, on which were embroidered the five wounds of
Christ, the symbol, chosen by the northern rebels; and
this banner, he affirmed, was found in the Countess's
house<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. 652.</NOTE>. No other proof seems to have been produced,
in order to ascertain her guilt: The Parliament, with∣out
farther enquiry, passed a bill of attainder against her;
and they involved in the same act, without any better
proof, as far as appears, Gertrude Marchioness of Exe∣ter,
Sir Adrian Fortescue, and Sir Thomas Dingley.
These two gentlemen were executed: The marchioness
was pardoned, and survived the King; the countess re∣ceived
a reprieve.</P>
<P>THE only beneficial act, passed this session, was that
by which the parliament confirmed the surrender of the
monasteries; and yet even this act contains much fals∣hood,
much tyranny, and were it not that all private
<PB N="217" REF="237"/>
rights must submitt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> public interest, much injustice and
iniquity. The scheme of engaging the abbots to make
a surrender of their monasteries had been conducted, as
may easily be imagined, with many invidious circum∣stances:
Arts of all kinds had been employed; every
motive, that could work on the frailty of human nature,
had been set before them; and it was with great dif∣ficulty
that these dignified conventuals were brought to
a concession, which most of them regarded as destructive
of their interests, as well as sacrilegious and criminal
in itself<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 158. &amp; seq.</NOTE>. Three abbots had shown more constancy
than the rest, the abbots of Colchester, Reading, and
Glastenbury; and in order to punish them for their op∣position,
and make them an example to others, means
had been found to convict them of treason; they had
perished by the hands of the executioner, and the reve∣nues
of the convents had been forfeited<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>. Besides, though
none of these violences had had place, the King knew,
that a surrender made by men, who were only tenants
for life, would not bear examination; and he was there∣fore
resolved to make all sure by his usual expedient, an
act of parliament. In the preamble to this act, the par∣liament
asserts, that all the surrenders, made by the ab∣bots,
had been, “without constraint, of their own ac∣cord,
and according to the due course of common
law.” And in consequence, the parliament confirms
the surrenders, and ascertains the property of the abbey
lands to the King and his successors for ever<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. It is re∣markable,
that all the mitred abbots still fat in the house
of peers; and that none of them made any protestation
against this statute.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="238"/>
IN this session, the rank of all the great officers of
state was fixed: Cromwel, as vicegerent, had the pre∣cedency
assigned him above all of them. It was thought
singular, that a black-smith's son, for he was no other,
should have place next the royal family; and that a man
possessed of no manner of literature, should be set at the
head of the church.</P>
<P>AS soon as the act of the six articles had passed, the
catholics were extremely vigilant to inform against of∣fenders;
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> less than five hundred persons were in
a little time thrown into prison But Cromwel, who
had not had interest enough to prevent that act, was able,
for the present, to elude its execution. Seconded by the
duke of Suffolk, and lord chancellor Audley, as well
as Cranmer, he remonstrated against the cruelty of pu∣nishing
so many delinquents; and he obtained permission
to set them at liberty. The uncertainty of the King's
humour gave each party an opportunity of triumphing in
its turn. No sooner had Henry, passed this law, which
seemed to give so deep a wound to the reformers, than
he granted a general permission, for every one to have
the new translation of the Bible in his Family: A con∣cession
regarded by that party, as a most important
victory.</P>
<P>BUT as Henry was observed to be much governed by
his wives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry's Projects of marriage.</NOTE> while he retained his fondness for them, the
final prevalence of either party, seemed to depend much
on the choice of the future Queen. Immediately after
the death of Jane Seymour, the most beloved of all his
wives, he began to think of a new marriage. He first
cast his eye on the dutchess-dowager of Milan, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ece to
the Emperor; and he made proposals for that alliance.
But meeting with difficulties in this design, he was car∣ried,
by his friendship for Francis, rather to think of a
<PB N="219" REF="239"/>
French princess. He demanded the dutchess-dowager
of Longueville, daughter of the duke of Guise, a prince
of the house of Lorraine; but Francis told him, that
that lady was already betrothed to the King of Scotland.
The King, however, would not take a repulse: He had
set his heart extremely on the match: The information,
which he had received, of the dutchess's accomplishments
and beauty, had prepossessed him in her favour; and
having privately sent over Meautys to examine her per∣son,
and get certain intelligence of her conduct, the ac∣counts,
which that agent brought him, served farther to
inflame his desires. He learned, that she was big made;
and he thought her, on that account, the more proper
match for him, who was now become somewhat corpu∣lent.
The pleasure too of mortifying his nephew, whom,
he did not love, was a farther incitement to his prosecu∣tion
of this match; and he insisted, that Francis should
give him the preference to the King of Scots. But
Francis, though sensible that the alliance of England
was of much greater importance to his interest, would
not affront his friend and ally; and to prevent farther
solicitations, he immediately sent the Princess to Scot∣land.
Not to shock, however, Henry's humour, Francis
made him an offer of Mary of Bourbon, daughter of the
duke of Vendome; but as the King was informed, that
James had formerly rejected this Princess, he would not
hear any farther of such a proposal. The French mo∣narch
then offered him the choice of the two younger
sisters of the new Queen of Scots; and he assured him,
that they were nowise inferior either in merit or size
to their elder sister, and that one of them was even,
superior in beauty. The King was as scrupulous with
regard to the person of his wives, as if his heart had been
really susceptible of a delicate passion; and he was un∣willing
to trust any relations, or even pictures, with
<PB N="220" REF="240"/>
regard to this important particular. He proposed to
Francis, that they should have a conference at Calais on
pretence of business; and that that monarch should bring
along with him the two Princesses of Guise, together
with the finest ladies of quality in France, that he might
make a choice among them. But the gallante spirit of
Francis was shocked with this proposal; and he was
impressed with too much regard, he said, for the fair sex,
to carry ladies of the first quality, like geldings, to a
market, there to be chosen or rejected by the humour of
the merchant<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 638.</NOTE>. Henry would hearken to none of these
niceties, but still insisted on his proposal; which, how∣ever,
notwithstanding Francis's earnest desire of con∣tinuing
a good correspondence with him, was finally rejected.</P>
<P>THE King began then to turn his thoughts towards
a German alliance; and as the princes of the Smal∣caldic
league were extremely disgusted against the Em∣peror
on account of the persecution of their religion,
he hoped, by matching himself into one of their fami∣lies,
to renew an amity, which he regarded as so useful
to him. Cromwel joyfully seconded this intention; and
proposed to him Anne of Cleves, whose father, the duke
of that name, had great interest among the Lutheran
princes, and whose sister, Sibylla, was married to the
elector of Saxony, the head of the protestant alliance.
A flattering picture, drawn for the Princess by Hans
Holben, determined Henry to apply to her father; and
after some negotiations, the marriage, notwithstanding
the opposition of the elector of Saxony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He marries Anne of Cleves.</NOTE> was at last con∣cluded;
and the Princess was sent over to England.
The King, impatient to be satisfied with regard to the
person of his bride, came privately to Rochester, and
<PB N="221" REF="241"/>
got a sight of her. He found her big, indeed, and tall,
as he could wish; but utterly devoid both of beauty
and grace; very unlike the pictures and representations,
which he had received: He swore she was a great
Flanders-mare; and declared, that he never could pos∣sibly
bear her any affection. The matter was worse,
when he found, that she could speak no language but
Dutch, of which he was entirely ignorant; and that the
charms of her conversation were not likely to compensate
for the homeliness of her person. He returned to Green∣wich
very melancholy; and much lamented his hard
fate to Cromwel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dislikes her.</NOTE> as well as to Lord Russel, Sir An∣thony
Brown, and Sir Anthony Denny. This last
gentleman, in order to give him comfort, told him, that
his misfortune was common to Kings, who could not,
like private persons, choose for themselves; but must
receive their wives from the judgment and fancy of others.</P>
<P>IT was the subject of debate among the King's coun∣sellers,
whether the marriage could not yet be broke;
and the Princess be sent back to her own country.
Henry's situation seemed at that time very critical.
After the ten years truce, concluded between the Em∣peror
and the king of France, a good understanding
seemed to have taken place between these rival mo∣narchs;
and such marks of union appeared, as gave
great jealousy to the court of England. The Emperor,
who knew the generous nature of Francis, even put a
confidence in him, which is rare, to that degree, among
great princes. An insurrection had been raised in the
Low Countries by the inhabitants of Ghent, and seemed
to threaten the most dangerous consequences. Charles,
who resided at that time in Spain, resolved to go in
person to Flanders, in order to appease these disorders;
<PB N="222" REF="242"/>
but he found great difficulties in contriving the manner
of his passage thither. The road by Italy and Germany
was tedious: The voyage through the Channel dange∣rous,
by reason of the English naval power: He asked Francis's
permission to pass through his dominions; and
he entrusted himself into the hands of a rival, whom he
had so mortally offended. The French monarch received
him at Paris, with great magnificence and courtesy; and
though prompted both by revenge and interest, as well
as by the advice of his mistress and favourites, to make
advantage of the present opportunity, he conducted the
Emperor safely out of his dominions; and would not so
much as speak to him of business during his abode in
France, lest his demands should bear the air of violence
upon his royal guest.</P>
<P>HENRY, who was informed of all these particulars,
believed that an entire and cordial union had taken place
between these two great monarchs; and that their reli∣gious
zeal might prompt them to fall with combined
arms upon England<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 579.</NOTE>. An alliance with the German
princes seemed now, more than ever, requisite for his
interest and safety; and he knew, that, if he sent back
the Princess of Cleves, such an affront would be highly
resented by her friends and family.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1540. 6 January.</NOTE> He was therefore
resolved, notwithstanding his aversion to her, to complete
the marriage; and he told Cromwel, that, since matters
had gone so far, he must put his neck into the yoke.
Cromwel, who knew how much his own interest was
concerned in this affair, was very anxious to learn from
the King, next morning after the marriage, whether
he now liked his spouse any better. The King told him,
that he hated her worse than ever; and that her person
was more lothsome on a near approach: He was resolved
<PB N="223" REF="243"/>
never to meddle with her; and even suspected her not to
be a true maid: A point, about which he had entertained
an extreme delicacy. He continued <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owever to be civil
to Anne; he even seemed to repose his usual confidence
in Cromwel; but though he exerted this command over
his temper, a discontent lay lurking in his breast, and
was ready to burst out on the first opportunity.</P>
<P>A SESSION of Parliament was held;<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 April. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and none of the
abbots were now allowed a place in the house of peers.
The King, by the mouth of the chancellor, complained to
the Parliament of the great diversity of religions, which
still prevailed among his subjects: A grievance, he said,
which ought the less to be endured; because the Scrip∣tures
were now published in English, and ought uni∣versally
to be the standard of belief to all mankind. But
he had appointed, he said, some bishops and divines to
draw up a list of tenets, to which his people were to
assent; and he was determined, that Christ, the doctrine
of Christ, and the truth should have the victory. The
King seems to have expected more effect in ascertaining
truth, from this new book of his doctors, than had
ens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed from the publication of the Scriptures. Crom∣wel,
as vicar-general, made also in the King's name a
speech to the upper house; and the peers, in return,
bestowed such flattery on him, that they said he was
worthy, by his desert, to be vicar-general of the uni∣verse.
That minister seemed to be no less in his master's
good graces: He received, soon after the sitting of the
Parliament, the title of Earl of Essex, and was installed.
knight of the garter.</P>
<P>THERE remained only one religious order in England;
the knights of St. John of Jerusalem, or the knights of
Malta, as they are commonly called. This order, partly
ecclesiastical partly military, bad, by their valour, done

<PB N="224" REF="246"/>
great service to Christendom; and had very much re∣tarded,
at Jerusalem, Rhodes, and Malta, the rapid pro∣gress
of the barbarians. During the general surrender of
the religions houses in England, they had exerted their
spirit; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad obstinately refused to yield up their reve∣nues
to the King; and Henry, who would endure no
society that professed obedience to the pope, was obliged
to have recourse to the Parliament for the dissolution
of this order. Their revenues were large; and formed
an addition nowise contemptible to the many acquisitions,
which the King had already made. But he had very ill
husbanded the great revenue obtained by the plunder of
the church: His profuse generosity dissipated faster than
his rapacity could supply; and the Parliament were
surprized this session to find a new demand made upon
them of four tenths and a subsidy of one shilling in the
pound during two years: So ill were the people's expec∣tations
answered, that the crown was never more to re∣quire
any supply from the people. The commons,
though lavish of their liberty, and of the blood of their
fellow subjects, were extremely frugal of their money;
and it was not without difficulty that that grant could
be obtained by this absolute and dreaded monarch. The
convocation gave the King four shillings in the pound to
be levied in two years. The pretext for these grants
was the great expence, which Henry had been put to
for the defence of the nation, in building forts along the
sea. coast, and in equipping a navy. As he had at present
no ally on the Continent, in whom he reposed much
confidence, he relied only on his domestic strength,
and was on that account obliged to be more expensive
in his preparations against the dangers of an invasion.</P>
<P>THE King's favour to Cromwel, and his acquiescence
in the marriage of Anne of Cleves, were both of them
deceitful appearances; His aversion to the Queen secretly
<PB N="225" REF="247"/>
encreased every day; and having at last broke all re∣straint,
it prompted him at once to seek the dissolution
of a marriage so odious to him, and to involve his mini∣ster
in ruin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fall of Cromwel.</NOTE> who had been the author of it. The fall
of Cromwel was hastened by other causes. All the no∣bility
hated a man, who, being of such base extraction,
had not only mounted above them by his station of vicar
general, but had engrossed many of the other considerable
offices of the kingdom: Besides that commission, which
gave him a high, and almost absolute authority over the
clergy, and even over the laity, he was Lord privy seal,
Lord chamberlain, and Master of the wards: He had
also obtained the order of the garter, a dignity which
had ever been conferred only on men of the most illustrious
families, and which seemed to be profaned by its being
communicated to so mean a person. The people were
averse to him, as the supposed author of the violences on
the monasteries; establishments, which were still re∣vered
and beloved by the commonalty. The catholics
regarded him as the concealed enemy of their religion:
The protestants, observing his exterior concurrence with
all the persecutions exercised against them, were inclined,
to bear him as little favour; and reproached him with
the timidity, if not treachery, of his conduct. And the
King, who found, that great clamours had on all hands
arisen against the administration, was not displeased to
throw on Cromwel the load of public hatred; and he
hoped, by so easy a sacrifice, to regain the affections of
his subjects.</P>
<P>BUT there was another cause, which suddenly set all
these motives in action, and brought about an unexpect∣ed
revolution in the ministry. The King had fixed his
affection on Catherine Howard, niece to the Duke of
Norfolk; and being determined to gratify this new pas∣sion,
he could find no other expedient but by procuring
<PB N="226" REF="248"/>
a divorce from his present consort, to raise Catherine to
his bed and throne. The Duke, who had long been en∣gaged
in enmity with Cromwel, made the same use of
her insinuations to ruin the minister, that he had formerly
done of Anne Boleyn's against Wolsey: And when all
engines were prepared, he obtained a commission from
the King, to arrest Cromwel at the council-board on
the accusation of high treason, and to commit him to
the Tower. Immediately after, a bill of attainder was
framed against him; and the house of peers thought pro∣per,
without trial, examination, or evidence, to condemn
to death a man, whom, a few days before, they had de∣clared
worthy to be vicar-general of the universe. The
house of commons passed the bill, though not without
some opposition. Cromwel was accused of heresy and
treason; but the instances of his treasonable practices are
utterly improbable, or even absolutely ridiculous<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 278.</NOTE>. The
only circumstance of his conduct, by which he seems to
have merited this fate, was his being the instrument of
the King's tyranny, in conducting like iniquitous bills,
in the former session, against the Countess of Salisbury
and others.</P>
<P>CROMWEL endeavoured to soften the King by the
most humble supplications; but all to no purpose: It
was not the practice of that Prince to ruin his ministere
and favourites by halves; and though the unhappy pri∣soner
wrote once in so moving a strain as even to draw
tears from his eyes, he hardened himself against all move∣ments
of pity, and refused his pardon. The conclusion
of Cromwel's letter ran in these words. “I, a most wo∣ful
prisoner, am ready to submit to death when it shall
please God and your majesty; and yet the frail flesh
incites me to call to your grace for mercy and pardon
<PB N="227" REF="249"/>
of mine offences. Written at the Tower with the
heavy heart and trembling hand of your highness's
most miserable prisoner and poor slave, Thomas
Cromwel.” And a little below, “Most gracious
prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th July. His exe∣cution.</NOTE> I cry for mercy, mercy, mercy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 281, 282.</NOTE>.” When
brought to execution, he avoided all earnest protesta∣tions
of his innocence;, and all complaints against the
sentence pronounced upon him. He knew that Henry would
resent on his son these symptoms of opposition to
his will, and that his death alone would not terminate
that monarch's vengeance. Me was a man of prudence,
industry, and ability; worthy of a better master and of a
better fate. Though raised to the summit of power from
a very low origin, he betrayed no insolence or contempt
of his inferiors; and was careful to remember all the
obligations which, during his lower fortune, he had
owed to any one. He had served as a private sentinel in
the Italian wars, where he received some good offices
from a Lucquese merchant, who had entirely forgot his
person, as well as the service, which he had rendered
him. Cromwel, in his grandeur, happened, at London,
to cast his eye on his benefactor, now reduced to po∣verty,
by misfortunes. He immediately sent for him,
put him in mind of their antient friendship, and by his
grateful assistance, re-instated him in his former prosper∣ous
circumstances<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 172.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE measures for divorcing the King from Anne of
Cleves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's di∣vorce from Anne of Cleves.</NOTE> were carried on at the same time with the bill
of attainder against Cromwel. The house of peers, in
conjunction with the commons, applied to him by peti∣tion,
desiring that he would allow his marriage to be
examined; and orders were immediately given to lay the
matter before the convocation. Anne had been formerly
<PB N="228" REF="250"/>
contracted by her father to the Duke of Lorrain; but
she, as well as the Duke, were at that time under age,
and the contract had been afterwards annulled by the
consent of both, parties. The King, however, pleaded
this contract as a ground of divorce; and he added two
reasons more, which may seem a little extraordinary;
that, when he espoused Anne, he had not <HI>inwardly</HI> given
his consent, and that he had not thought proper to con∣summate
the marriage. The convocation were satisfied
with these reasons, and solemnly annulled the marriage
between the King and Queen: The Parliament ratified
the decision of the clergy<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">To show how much Henry sported with law and common sense, how servilely the Parliament followed all his caprices; and how much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of them were lost to all sentiment of shame; an act was passed this session, declaring, that a precontract should be no ground of annulling a marriage; as if that pretext had not been made use in both in the case of Anne Boleyn and Anne of Cleves. But the King's intention in this law is said to be a design of restoring the princess Elizabeth to her right of legitimacy; and it was his character never to look farther than the present object, without regarding the inconsistency of his conduct. The Parliament made it high treason to deny the dissolution of Henry'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> marriage with Anne of Cleves. Herbert.</NOTE>; and the sentence was soon
after notified to that Princess.</P>
<P>ANNE was blest with a happy insensibility of temper,
even in the points which the most nearly affect her sex; and
the King's aversion towards her, as well as his prosecu∣tion
of the divorce, had never given her the least unea∣siness.
She willingly hearkened to terms of composition
with him; and when he offered to adopt her as his sister,
to give her place next the Queen, and his own daughter,
and to make a settlement of three thousand pounds a year
upon her; she accepted of the conditions, and gave her
consent to the divorce<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 458, 459.</NOTE>. She even wrote to her brother,
(for her father was dead) that she had been very well
<PB N="229" REF="251"/>
used in England, and desired him to live on good terms
with the King. The only instance of pride which she
betrayed was that she refused to return into her own
country after the affront which she had received; and she
lived and died in England.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING Anne's moderation, this inci∣dent
produced a great coldness between the King and the
German princes; but as the situation of Europe was now
much altered, Henry was the more indifferent about their
resentment. The close intimacy which had taken place
between Francis and Charles, had subsisted during a very
short time: The dissimilarity of their characters soon re∣newed,
with greater violence than ever, their former jea∣lousy
and hatred. While Charles remained at Paris,
Francis had been imprudently engaged, by his open tem∣per,
and by that satisfaction which a noble mind natu∣rally
feels in performing generous actions, to make some
very dangerous, confidences to that interested monarch;
and having now lost all suspicion of his rival, he hoped,
that the emperor and he, supporting each other, might
neglect every other alliance. He not only communicated
to his guest the state of his negociations with Sultan So∣lyman
and the Venetians: He also laid open the solici∣tations
which he had received from the court of England,
to enter into a confederacy against him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, Du Tillet.</NOTE>. Charles had
no sooner reached his own dominions, than he shewed
himself unworthy of the friendly reception which he had
met with. He flatly refused to execute his promise, and
put the Duke of Orleans in possession of the Milanese:
He informed Solyman, and the senate of Venice, of the
treatment which they had received from their ally: And
he took care that Henry should not be ignorant how wil∣lingly
Francis had abandoned his ancient friend, to
<PB N="230" REF="252"/>
whom he owed such important obligations, and had sa∣crificed
him to a new confederate: He even poisoned and
misrepresented many things, which the unsuspecting heart
of the French monarch had disclosed to him. Had Henry
possessed true judgment and generosity, this incident
alone had been sufficient to guide him in the choice
of his allies. But his domineering pride carried him
immediately to renounce the friendship of Francis, who
had so unexpectedly given the Emperor the preference:
And as Charles invited him to a renewal of ancient ami∣ty,
he willingly accepted the offer; and thinking him∣self
secure in this alliance, he neglected the friendship
both of France and of the German princes.</P>
<P>THE new turn which Henry had taken with regard to
foreign affairs, was extremely agreeable to his catholic
subjects; and as it had perhaps contributed, among other
reasons, to the ruin of Cromwel, it made them entertain
hopes of a final prevalence over their antagonists.<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th August. His mar∣riage with Catherine Howard.</NOTE> The
marriage of the King with Catherine Howard, which
followed soon after his divorce from Anne of Cleves, was
also regarded as a very favourable incident to their cause;
and the subsequent events corresponded perfectly to their
expectations. The King's councils being now directed
by Norfolk, and Gardiner, a furious persecution com∣menced
against th protestants; and the law of the six
articles was executed with rigour. Dr. Barnes, who had
been the cause of Lambert's execution, felt, in his turn,
the severity of the persecuting spirit; and, by a bill
which passed in parliament, without trial, he was con∣demned
to the flames, together with Jerome and Ger∣rard.
He discussed theological questions even at the
stake; and as the debate between him and the sheriff,
turned upon the invocation of saints, he said, that he
doubted whether the saints could pray for us; but if they
could, he hoped in half an hour, to be praying for the
<PB N="231" REF="253"/>
sheriff and all the spectators. He next entreated the she∣riff
to carry to the King his dying requests, which he
fondly imagined would have authority with that monarch,
who had sent him to the stake. The purport of his re∣quests
was, that Henry, besides repressing superstitious
ceremonies, should be extremely vigilant in preventing
fornication and common swearing<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 298. Fox.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry was exerting this violence against the
protestants, he spared not the catholics who denied his
supremacy; and a foreigner, who was at that time in
England, had reason to say, that those who were against
the pope were burned, and those who were for him were
hanged<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 529.</NOTE>. The King even displayed, in an ostentatious
manner, this tyrannical equity and impartiality, which
reduced both parties to subjection, and infused terror in∣to
every breast. Barnes, Gerrard, and Jerome had been
carried to the place of execution on three hurdles; and
along with them there was placed on each hurdle a ca∣tholic,
who was also executed for his religion. These
catholics were Abel, Fetherstone, and Powel, who de∣clared,
that the most grievous part of their punishment
was the being coupled to such heretical miscreants as
suffered with them<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Saunders, de Schism. Angl.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOUGH the spirit of the English seemed to be total∣ly
sunk under the despotic power of Henry, there ap∣peared
some symptoms of discontent: An inconsiderable
insurrection broke out in Yorkshire, headed by Sir John
Nevil; but it was soon suppressed, and Nevil, with the
other ringleaders, was executed. The rebels were sup∣posed to have been
instigated by the intrigues of cardi∣nal
Pole; and the King was instantly determined to
make the countess of Salisbury, who lay under sentence

of death, suffer for her son's offences. He ordered her
to be carried to the place of execution, and this ve∣nerable
matron maintained still, in these distressful cir∣cumstances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 May.</NOTE>
the spirit of that long race of monarchs from
whom she was descended<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 468.</NOTE>. She refused to lay her head
on the block, or submit to a sentence where she had re∣ceived
no trial. She told the executioner, that, if he
would have her head, he must win it the best way he
could: And thus shaking her venerable grey locks, she
ran about the scaffold; and the executioner followed her
with his ax, aiming many fruitless blows at her neck,
before he was able to give her the fatal stroke. Thus
perished the last of the line of Plantagenet, which, with
great glory, but still greater crimes and misfortunes, had
governed England for the space of three hundred years.
The lord Leonard Grey, a man who had formerly ren∣dered
great service to the crown, was also beheaded for
treason, soon after the countess of Salisbury. We know
little of the grounds of his prosecution.</P>
<P>THE insurrection in the North engaged Henry to make
a progress thither, in order to quiet the minds of his
people, to reconcile them to his government, and to
abolish the ancient superstitions, to which those parts
were much addicted. He had also another motive for
his journey:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1541.</NOTE> He proposed to hold a conference at York
with his nephew the King of Scotland, and, if possible,
to cement a close and indissoluble union with that
kingdom.</P>
<P>THE same spirit of religious innovation, which had
seized the other parts of Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of af∣fairs in Scotland.</NOTE> had made its way into
Scotland, and had begun, long before this period, to ex∣cite
the same jealousies, fears, and persecutions. About
the year 1527, Patrick Hamilton, a young man of a
<PB N="233" REF="257"/>
noble family, having been created abbot of Ferne, was
sent abroad for his education; but had fallen into com∣pany
with some reformers, and he returned into his own
country very ill disposed towards that church, of which
his birth and his merit entitled him to attain the highest
honours. The fervour of youth, and his zeal for no∣velty,
made it impossible for him to conceal his senti∣ments;
and Campbel, prior of the Dominicans, who,
under colour of friendship, and a sympathy in opinion,
had insinuated himself into his confidence, accused him
to Beaton, archbishop of St. Andrews. Hamilton was
invited to St. Andrews, in order to maintain, with some
of the clergy, a dispute concerning the controverted
points; and after much reasoning with regard to justifi∣cation,
freewill, original sin, and other topics of that
nature, the conference ended with their condemning
Hamilton to be burnt for his errors. The young man,
who had been deaf to the insinuations of ambition, was
less likely to be shaken with the fears of death, while
he proposed to himself both the glory of bearing testi∣mony
to the truth, and the immediate reward atten∣ding
his martyrdom. The people, who compassionated
his youth, his virtue, and his noble birth, were much
moved with the constancy of his end; and an incident,
which soon followed, still more confirmed them in their
favourable sentiments towards him. He cited Campbel,
who still insulted him at the stake, to answer before the
judgment-seat of Christ; and as that persecutor, either
astonished with these events, or overcome with remorse,
or, perhaps, seized with a distemper, soon after lost his
senses, and fell into a fever, of which he died; the peo∣ple
regarded Hamilton as a prophet, as well as a
martyr<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Spotswood's Hist. church of Scotland, p. 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="258"/>
AMONG the disciples converted by Hamilton, was one
friar Forrest, who became a zealous preacher; and who,
though he did not openly discover his sentiments, was
suspected to lean towards the new opinions. His dioce∣san,
the bishop of Dunkel, enjoined him, when he met
with a good epistle or good gospel, which favoured the
liberties of holy church, to preach on it, and let the rest
alone. Forrest answered, that he had read both Old and
New Testament, and had not found an ill epistle, or ill
gospel in any part of them. The extreme attachment to
the Scriptures was regarded in those days as a sure cha∣racteristic
of heresy; and Forrest was soon after brought
to his trial, and condemned to the flames. While the
priests were deliberating on the place of his execution, a
bystander advised them to burn him in some cellar: For
that the smoke of Mr. Patrick Hamilton had infected
all those on whom it blew<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 65.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE clergy were at that time reduced to great diffi∣culties,
not only in Scotland, but all over Europe. As
the reformers aimed at a total subversion of ancient esta∣blishments,
which they represented as idolatrous, im∣pious,
detestable, the priests, who found both their ho∣nours
and properties at stake, thought that they had a
right to resist, by every extremity, these dangerous in∣vaders,
and that the same simple principles of equity,
which justified a man in killing a pyrate or a robber,
would acquit them for the execution of such heretics. A
toleration, though it is never acceptable to ecclesiastics,
might, they said, be admitted in other cases; but seemed
an absurdity where fundamentals were shaken, and where
the possessions, and even the subsistence of the established
clergy were brought in danger. But though the church
was thus carried by policy, as well as inclination, to
<PB N="235" REF="259"/>
kindle the fires of persecution, they found the success of
this remedy very precarious, and observed, that the en∣thusiastic
zeal of the reformers, inflamed by punishment,
was apt to prove very contagious on the compassionate
minds of the spectators. The new doctrine, amidst all
the dangers to which it was exposed, spread itself secretly
every where; and the minds of men were gradually dis∣posed
to a revolution in religion.</P>
<P>BUT the most dangerous symptom for the clergy in
Scotland was, that the nobility, moved by the example
of England, had cast a wishful eye on the church reve∣nues,
and hoped, if a reformation took place, to enrich
themselves by the plunder of the ecclesiastics. James
himself, who was very poor, and was somewhat inclined
to magnificence, particularly in building, had been sway∣ed
by like motives; and began to threaten the clergy
with the same sate which attended them in the neighbour∣ing
country. Henry also, never ceased exhorting his
nephew to imitate his example; and being moved both
by the pride of making proselytes, and the prospect of
security, if Scotland should embrace a close union with
him, he solicited the King of Scots to meet him at
York; and he obtained a promise to that purpose.</P>
<P>THE ecclesiastics were extremely alarmed with this re∣solution
of James; and they employed every expedient,
in order to prevent it. They represented the dangers of
innovation; the pernicious consequences of aggrandizing
the nobility, already too powerful; the hazard of putting
himself into the hands of the English, his hereditary
enemies; the dependance which must ensue upon losing
the friendship of France, and of all foreign potentates.
To these considerations, they added the prospect of pre∣sent
interest, by which they found the King to be much
governed: They offered him a present gratuity of fifty
thousand pounds Scots: They promised him, that the
<PB N="236" REF="260"/>
church should always be ready to contribute to his sup∣ply:
And they pointed out to him, the confiscations of
heretics, as the means of filling his exchequer, and of
adding a hundred thousand pounds a year to the crown
revenues<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. xiv. Drummond in Ja. 5. Pitscotie, ibid. Knox.</NOTE>. The insinuations of his new Queen, to
whom youth, beauty, and address had given a powerful
influence over him, seconded all these reasons; and
James was at last engaged, first to delay his journey,
then to send excuses to the King of England, who had
already come to York, in order to be present at the
conference.</P>
<P>HENRY, vexed with the disappointment, and enraged
at the affront, vowed vengeance against his nephew; and
he began, by permitting pyracies at sea, and incursions
at land, to put his threats in execution. But he
received soon after, in his own family, an affront to
which he was much more sensible, and which touched
him in a point where he had always shewn an extreme
delicacy. He had thought himself very happy in his
new marriage: The youth, beauty, and agreeable dispo∣sition
of Catherine, had entirely captivated his affections;
and he made no secret of his devoted attachment to her.
He had even put up a prayer in his chapel, returning
thanks to heaven for the felicity which the conjugal state
afforded him; and he desired the bishop of Lincoln to
compose a form of thanksgiving for that purpose. But
the queen very little merited this tenderness which he
bore her:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovery of the Queen's crimes.</NOTE> She had abandoned herself to lewdness. One
Lascelles brought intelligence of her dissolute life to
Cranmer; and told him, that his sister, formerly a servant
in the old dutchess of Norfolk's family, with whom Ca∣therine
was educated, had given him a particular account
<PB N="237" REF="261"/>
of all her disorders. Derham and Mannoc, both of
them servants of the dutchess, had been admitted to her
bed; and she had even taken little care to conceal her
shame from the other servants of the family. The pri∣mate,
struck with this intelligence, which it was equally
dangerous to conceal or to discover, communicated the
matter to the earl of Hertford and to the chancellor. They
agreed, that the matter should by no means be buried
in silence; and the archbishop himself seemed the most
proper person to disclose it to the King. Cranmer, un∣willing
to speak on so delicate a subject, wrote a narrative
of the whole, and conveyed it to Henry, who was infi∣nitely
astonished at the intelligence. So confident was
he of the fidelity of his consort, that he gave at first no
credit to the information; and he said to the lord privy∣seal,
to lord Russel, high admiral, Sir Anthony Brown,
and Wriothesely, that he regarded the whole as a forgery.
Cranmer was now in a very perilous situation; and had
not full proofs been found, certain and inevitable destruc∣tion
hung over him. The King's impatience, however,
and jealousy prompted him to search the matter to the
bottom: The privy-seal was ordered to examine Las∣celles,
who persisted in the information he had given;
and still appealed to his sister's testimony. That noble∣man
made next a pretence of hunting, and went to Sus∣sex,
where the woman at that time resided; He found
her both constant in her former intelligence, and parti∣cular
as to the facts; and the whole bore but too much
the face of probability. Mannoc and Derham, who
were arrested at the same time, and examined by the
chancellor, made the Queen's guilt entirely certain by
their confession; and discovered other particulars, which
redounded still more to her dishonour. Three maids of
the family were admitted into her secrets; and some of
<PB N="238" REF="262"/>
them had even past the night in bed with her and her
lovers. All the examinations were laid before the King,
who was so deeply affected, that he remained a long time
speechless, and at last burst into tears. He found to his
surprize, that his great skill in distinguishing a true maid,
of which he boasted in the case of Anne of Cleves, had
failed him in that of his present consort. The Queen
being now questioned, denied her guilt; but when in∣formed,
that a full discovery was made, she confessed,
that she had been criminal before her marriage; and
only insisted, that she had never been false to the King's
bed. But as there was evidence, that one Colepeper had
passed the night with her alone since her marriage; and
as it appeared, that she had taken Derham, her old
paramour, into her service; she seemed to deserve very
little credit in this asseveration; and the King besides,
was not of a humour to make any difference between
these degrees of guilt.</P>
<P>HENRY found,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1542.</NOTE> that he could not so fully or expedi∣tiously
satiate his vengeance on all these criminals as by
assembling a Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Jan.</NOTE> the usual instrument of his
tyranny. The two houses, having received the Queen's
confession, began by an address to the King; which
consisted of several particulars. They entreated him not
to be vexed with this untoward accident, to which all
men were subject; but to consider the frailty of human
nature, and the mutability of human affairs; and from
these views to derive a subject of consolation. They
desired leave to frame a bill of attainder against the Queen
and her accomplices; and they begged him to give his
assent to this bill, not in person, which would renew his
vexation, and might endanger his health, but by com∣missioners
appointed for that purpose. And as there was
a law in force, making it treason to speak ill of the
<PB N="239" REF="263"/>
Queen, as well as King, they craved his royal pardon,
if any of them should, on the present occasion, have trans∣gressed
any part of that statute.</P>
<P>HAVING obtained a gracious answer to these requests,
the Parliament proceeded to an act of attainder for treason
against the Queen, and the viscountess of Rocheford,
who had conducted her secret amours; and in this act
Colepeper, and Derham, were also comprized. At the
same time, they passed a bill of attainder for misprision of
treason against the old dutchess of Norfolk, Catherine's
grandmother, her uncle, lord William Howard, and his
lady, together with the countess of Bridgewater, and
nine persons more; because they knew the Queen's vici∣ous
life before her marriage, and yet concealed it. This
was an effect of Henry's usual extravagance, to expect
that parents should so far forget the ties of natural affec∣tion,
and the sentiments of shame and decency, as to
reveal to him the most secret disorders of their family.
He himself seems to have been sensible of the cruelty of
this sentence: For he pardoned the dutchess of Norfolk,
and most of the others, condemned for misprision o
treason.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to secure himself for the future, as well
as his successors, from this fatal accident, he engaged
the Parliament to frame a law, equally full of extrava∣gance.
It was enacted, that any one, who knew, or
vehemently presumed any guilt in the Queen, and did
not, within twenty days, disclose it to the King or
council, should be guilty of treason; prohibiting every
one, at the same time, from spreading the matter abroad,
or even privately whispering it to others. It was also
enac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, that if the King married any woman, who had
been incontinent, taking her for a true maid, she should
be guilty of treason, in case she did not previously reveal
<PB N="240" REF="264"/>
her guilt to him. The people made merry with this ex∣traordinary
clause, and said, that the King must hence∣forth
look out for a widow; for no reputed maid would
ever be persuaded to incur the penalty of the statute<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 314.</NOTE>.
After all these laws were passed, the Queen was beheaded
on Tower-hill, together with the lady Rocheford. They
behaved in a manner suitable to their dissolute life; and
as the lady Rocheford was known to be the chief instru∣ment,
who had brought Anne Boleyn to her end, she
died unpitied; and men were farther confirmed, by the
discovery of this woman's guilt, in the favourable senti∣ments
which they had entertained of that unfortunate
Queen.</P>
<P>THE King made no demand of any subsidies from this
Parliament; but he found means of enriching his ex∣chequer
from another quarter: He took farther steps to∣wards
the dissolution of colleges, hospitals, and other
foundations of that nature. The courtiers had been
practising on the presidents and governors, to make a
surrender of their revenues to the King; and they had
been successful with eight of them. But there was an
obstacle to their farther progress: It had been provided,
by the local statutes of most of these foundations, that no
president, nor any fellows, could make such a deed with∣out
the unanimous vote of all the fellows; and this con∣sent
was not easily obtained. All such statutes were now
annulled by Parliament; and the revenues of these houses,
so useful to the public, were now laid open to the rapa∣city
of the King and his favourites<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It was enacted by this Parliament, that there should be trial of trea∣son in any county where the King should appoint by commission. The statutes of treason had been extremely multiplied in this reign; and such an expedient saved trouble and charges in trying that crime. The same Parliament erected Ireland into a kingdom; and Henry henceforth an∣nexed the title of King of Ireland to his other titles. This session, the commons first began the practice of freeing any of their members, who were arrested, by a writ issued by the speaker. Formerly it was usual for them to apply for a writ from chancery to that purpose. This pre∣cedent encreased the authority of the commons, and had afterwards considerable consequences. Hollingshed, p. 955, 956. Baker, p. 289.</NOTE>. The church had
<PB N="241" REF="265"/>
been so long their prey, that nobody was surprized at any
new inroads made upon it. From the regular, Henry
now proceeded to make devastations on the secular clergy.
He extorted from many of the bishops a surrender of
chapter lands; and by this devise he pillaged the sees of
Canterbury, York, and London, and enriched his greedy
parasites and flatterers with their spoils.</P>
<P>THE clergy have been commonly so fortunate as to
make a concern for their temporal interests go hand in
hand with a jealousy for orthodoxy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecelesiasti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> affairs.</NOTE> and both these pas∣sions
be regarded, by the people, ignorant and supersti∣tious,
as a zeal for religion: But the violent and head∣strong
character of Henry now disjoined these objects.
His rapacity was gratified by plundering the church; his
bigotry and arrogance by persecuting heretics. Though
he engaged the Parliament to mitigate the penalties of
the six articles, so far as regards the marriage of priests,
which was now only subjected to a forfeiture of goods,
chattels, and lands during life; he was still equally bent
on maintaining a rigid purity in speculative principles.
He had appointed a commission, consisting of the two
archbishops and several bishops of both provinces, to∣gether
with a considerable number of doctors of divinity;
and by virtue of his ecclesiastical supremacy be had given
them in charge to choose a religion for his people. Be∣fore
the commissioners had made any progress in this ar∣duous
undertaking, the Parliament, in 1541, had passed
a law, by which they ratified all the tenets, which these
divines should establish with the King's consent: And
<PB N="242" REF="266"/>
they were not ashamed of expressly declaring that they took
their religion upon trust, and had no other rule, in reli∣gious
as well as temporal concerns, than the arbitrary
will of their master. There is only one clause of the
statute, which may seem at first sight to savour somewhat
of the spirit of liberty: It was enacted that the ecclesi∣astical
commissioners should establish nothing repugnant
to the laws and statutes of the realm. But in reality
this proviso was inserted by the King, to serve his own
purposes. By introducing a confusion and contradiction
into the laws, he became more the master of every one's
life and property. And as the antient independance of the
church still gave him jealousy, he was well pleased, under
cover of such a clause, to introduce appeals from the
spiritual to the civil courts. It was for a like reason, that
he would never promulgate a body of canon law; and
encouraged the judges on all occasions to interpose in
ecclesiastical causes wherever they thought the law or
royal prerogative concerned. A happy innovation; tho'
at first invented for arbitrary purposes!</P>
<P>THE King, armed by the authority of Parliament, or
rather by their acknowlegement of that spiritual supre∣macy,
which he believed inherent in him, employed his
commissioners to select a system of tenets for the assent
and belief of the nation. A small volume was soon after
published, called, the <HI>Institution of a Christian Man,</HI>
which was received by the convocation, and voted to be
the infallible standard of orthodoxy. All the delicate
points of justification, faith, free-will, good works, and
grace, are there defined, with a leaning towards the opi∣nion
of the reformers: The sacraments, which a few
years before were only allowed to be three, are now en∣creased
to the number of seven, conformable to the sen∣timents
of the catholics. The King's caprice is discern∣able
<PB N="243" REF="267"/>
through the whole; and the book is in reality to be
regarded as his composition. For Henry, while he made
his opinion a rule for the nation, would tye his own
hands by no canon or authority, not even by any which
he himself had formerly established.</P>
<P>THE people had occasion soon after to see a farther
instance of the King's inconstancy. He was not long
satisfied with his Institution of a Christian Man: He
ordered a new book to be composed, called, the <HI>Erudition
of a Christian Man;</HI> and without asking the assent of the
convocation, he published, by his own authority, and
that of the Parliament, this new model of orthodoxy.
It differs from the Institution<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 190.</NOTE>; but the King was no
less positive in his new creed than he had been in the
old; and he required the belief of the nation to veer
about at his signal. In both these books, he was parti∣cularly
careful to inculcate the doctrine of passive obe∣dience;
and he was no less careful to retain the nation
in the practice.</P>
<P>WHILE the King was spreading his own books among
the people, he seems to have been extremely perplexed,
as well as the clergy, what course to take with the Scrip∣tures..
A review had been made by the ecclesiastical
synod of the new translation of the Bible; and Gardiner
had proposed, that, instead of employing English expres∣sions
throughout, several Latin words should still be pre∣served,
because they contained, as he pretended, such
peculiar energy and significance, that they had no cor∣respondent
terms in the vulgar tongue<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 315.</NOTE>. Among these
were <HI>eclesia, paenitentia, pontifex, contritus, holo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>austa, sa∣cramentum,
elementa, ceremonia, mysterium, presbyte, sacri∣ficium,
humilitas, satisfactio, pecc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tum, gratia, hostia, cha∣ritas,</HI>
&amp;c. But as this mixture would have appeared ex∣tremely
<PB N="244" REF="268"/>
barbarous, and was plainly calculated for no
other purpose than to retain the people in their antient
ignorance, the proposal was rejected. The knowledge of
the people, however, at least their disputative turn,
seemed to be an inconvenience still more dangerous; and
the King and Parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Which met on the 22d of January, 1543.</NOTE>, soon after the publication of
the Scriptures, retracted the concession, which they had
formerly made; and prohibited all but gentlemen and
merchants to peruse them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">33 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. Even that liberty was not
granted, without an apparent hesitation, and a dread of
the consequences: These persons were allowed to read,
<HI>so it be done quietly and with good order.</HI> And the preamble
to the act sets forth, “that many seditious and ignorant
persons had abused the liberty granted them for read∣ing
the Bible, and that great diversity of opinions,
animosities, tumults, and schisms had been occasioned
by perverting the sense of the Scriptures.” It seemed
very difficult to reconcile the King's model for uniformity,
with the permission of free enquiry.</P>
<P>THE mass book also passed under the King's cognizance;
and little alteration was as yet made in it: Some doubtful
or fictitious saints only were struck out; and the name
of the pope was erazed. This latter precaution was like∣wise
used with regard to every new book that was printed,
or even old book that was sold. The word, Pope, was
carefully omitted or blotted out<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary history, vol. iii. p. 113.</NOTE>; as if that precaution
could abolish the term from the language, or as if such a
persecution of it did not rather imprint it more strongly
in the memory of the people.</P>
<P>THE King took care about this time to clear the
churches of another abuse, which had crept into them.
<PB N="245" REF="269"/>
Plays, interludes, and farces were there often acted in de∣rision
of the former superstitions; and the reverence of
the multitude for their antient principles and modes of
worship, was thereby gradually effaced<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 318.</NOTE>. We do not
hear, that the catholics attempted to retaliate by employ∣ing
this powerful engine against their adversaries, or en∣deavoured
by like arts to expose that fanatical spirit, by
which, it appears, the reformers were often actuated.
Perhaps the people were not disposed to relish a jest on
that side: Perhaps the greater simplicity and the more
spiritual abstract worship of the protestants, gave less hold
to ridicule, which is commonly founded on sensible re∣presentations.
It was, therefore, a very agreeable con∣cession,
which Henry made the catholic party, to suppress
entirely these religious comedies.</P>
<P>THUS Henry laboured incessantly, by arguments,
creeds, and penal statutes, to bring his subjects to an uni∣formity
in their religious sentiments: But as he entered,
himself, with the greatest earnestness, into all these scho∣lastic
reasonings, he encouraged the people, by his ex∣ample,
to apply themselves to the study of theology; and
it was in vain afterwards to expect, however present fear
might restrain their tongues or pens, that they would
cordially agree in any set of tenets or opinions prescribed
to them.</P>

<P>HENRY being determined to avenge himself of the
King of Scots for slighting the advances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXIII.</NOTE> which
he made for his friendship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1542.</NOTE> would gladly have obtained a
supply from the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> to enable him to prosecute
that enterprize; but as he did not think it prudent to dis∣cover
his intentions, the Parliament, conformable to their
frugal maxims, would understand no hints; and the
King was disappointed in his expectations. He continued,
however, to make preparations for war; and so soon as
he thought himself in a condition to invade Scotland,
he published a manifesto, by which he endeavoured to
justify his hostilities. He complained of James's disap∣pointing
him in the promised interview; which was the
real ground of the quarrel<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond in James the fifth.</NOTE>: But in order to give a more
specious colouring to the enterprize, he mentioned other
injuries; that his nephew had given protection to some
English rebels and fugitives, and had detained some ter∣ritory,
which, Henry pretended, belonged to England.
He even revived the old claim of the dependance of the
<PB N="247" REF="271"/>
crown of Scotland, and he summoned James to do ho∣mage
to him as his liege lord and superior. He em∣ployed
the duke of Norfolk, whom he called the scourge
of the Scots, to command in the war; and tho' James
sent the bishop of Aberdeen, and Sir James Learmont of
Darsay, to appease his uncle, he would hearken to no
terms of accommodation. While Norfolk was assem∣bling
his army at Newcastle, Sir Robert Bowes, attended
with Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Ralph Evers, Sir Brian
Latoun, and others, made an incursion into Scotland,
and advanced towards Jedburgh, with an intention of
pillaging and destroying that town. The earl of Angus,
and George Douglas, his brother, who had been so
many years banished their country, and had subsisted
by Henry's bounty, joined the English army in this
incursion; and the forces, commanded by Bowes, ex∣ceeded
four thousand men. James had not been negli∣gent
in his preparations for defence, and had posted a
considerable body, under the command of the earl of
Huntley, for the protection of the borders. Lord Hume,
at the head of his vassals, was hastening to join Huntley,
when he met with the English army; and a battle im∣mediately
ensued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 August</NOTE> While they were engaged, the forces
under Huntley began to appear; and the English,
afraid of being overpowered and surrounded, took to
flight, and were pursued by the enemy. Evers, Latoun,
and some other persons of distinction, were taken pri∣soners.
A few only of small note fell in this skir∣mish<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, mean while, began to move
from his camp at Newcastle; and being attended by the
earls of Shrewsbury, Derby, Cumberland, Surrey, Hert∣ford,
Rutland, with many others of the nobility, he ad∣vanced
<PB N="248" REF="272"/>
to the borders. His army amounted to above
twenty thousand men; and it required the utmost efforts
of Scotland to resist such formidable preparations. James
had assembled his whole military force at Fala and Sau∣trey,
and was ready to advance so soon as he should be
informed of Norfolk's invading his kingdom. The Eng∣lish
passed the Tweed at Berwic, and advanced along the
banks of the river as far as Kelso; but hearing that James
had gathered together near thirty thousand men, they repas∣sed
the river at that village, and retreated into their own
country<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.</NOTE>. The King of Scots, inflamed with a desire of
military glory, and of revenge on his invaders, gave the
signal for pursuing them, and carrying the war into
England. He was surprized to find, that his nobility,
who were generally disaffected on account of the prefe∣rence,
which he had given the clergy, oppose<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this reso∣lution,
and refused to attend him in his projected enter∣prize.
Enraged at this defection, he reproached them
with cowardice, and threatened vengeance; but still re∣solved,
with the forces which adhered to him, to make
an impression on the enemy's country. He sent ten
thousand men to the western borders, who entered Eng∣land
at Solway firth; and he himself followed them at a
small distance, ready to join them upon occasion. Dis∣gusted,
however, with the refractory disposition of his
nobles, he sent a messenger to the army, depriving lord
Maxwel, their general, of his commission, and confer∣ring
the command on Oliver Sinclair, a private gentle∣man,
who was his favourite. The army were extremely
displeased with this alteration, and were ready to dis∣band;
when a small body of English appeared, not ex∣ceeding
500 men, under the command of Dacres and
Musgrave. A panic seized the Scots, who immediately
<PB N="249" REF="273"/>
took to flight, and were pursued by the enemy. Few
were killed in this rout; for it was no action; but a
great many were taken prisoners, and some of the princi∣pal
nobility.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th No∣vember. Victory at Solway.</NOTE> Among these were the earls of Cassilis and
Glencairn; the lords Maxwel, Fleming, Sommerville,
Oliphant, Grey, who were all sent to London, and gi∣ven
in custody to different noblemen.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots, hearing of this disaster, was con∣founded;
and being naturally of a melancholic disposi∣tion,
as well as endowed with a high spirit, he lost all command
of his temper on this dismal occasion. Rage
against his nobility, who, he believed, had betrayed
him; shame for a defeat by such unequal numbers; re∣gret
of the past, fear of the future; all these passions so
wrought upon him, that he would admit of no consola∣tion,
but abandoned himself wholly to despair. His body
was wasted by sympathy with his anxious mind; and
even his life began to be thought in danger. He had no
child living; and hearing that his Queen was safely de∣livered,
he asked whether she had brought him a male or
female? Being told, the latter; he turned about in his
bed: “The crown came with a woman,” said he,
“and it will go with one: Many miseries await this
poor kingdom: Henry will make it his own either by
force of arms or by marriage.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th of De∣cember. Death of James the fifth.</NOTE> A few days after, he
expired, in the flower of his age; a prince of consider∣able
virtues and talents, well fitted, by his vigilance and
personal courage, for repressing those disorders, to which,
his kingdom, during that age, was so much exposed.
He executed justice with the greatest impartiality and ri∣gour;
but as he supported the commonalty and the
church against the rapine of the nobility, he escaped
not the hatred of that order. The protestants also,
whom he repressed, have endeavoured to throw many
<PB N="250" REF="274"/>
stains on his memory; but have not been able to fix any
considerable imputation on him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The persecutions, exercised during James's reign, are not to be ascribed to his bigotry, a vice, of which he seems to have been as free as Francis the first or the emperor Charles, both of whom, as well as James, shewed, in different periods of their lives, even an inclination to the new doctrines. The extremities to which all these princes were carried, proceeded entirely from the situation of affairs, during that age, which rendered it impossible for them to act with greater temper or moderation, after they had embraced the resolution of supporting the antient establishments. So violent was the propensity of the times towards innovation, that a toleration of the new preachers was equiva∣lent to a formed design of changing the national religion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY was no sooner informed of his victory and of
the death of his nephew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1543.</NOTE> than he projected, as James
had foreseen, the scheme of uniting Scotland to his own
dominions, by marrying his son, Edward, to the heiress
of that kingdom<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 584. Herbert, Burnet, Buchanan.</NOTE>. He called together the Scots nobles,
who were his prisoners; and after reproaching them, in
severe terms, for their breach of treaty, as he pretended,
he began to soften his tone, and proposed to them this
expedient, by which, he hoped, those disorders, so pre∣judicial
to both states, would for the future be prevented.
He offered to bestow on them their liberty without
ransom; and only required of them engagements to fa∣vour
the marriage of the Prince of Wales with their
young mistress. They were easily prevailed on to give
their assent to a proposal, which seemed so natural, and
so advantageous to both kingdoms; and being conducted
to Newcastle, they delivered to the duke of Norfolk,
hostages for their return, in case the intended nuptials
were not compleated: And they thence proceeded to
Scotland, where they found affairs in some confusion.</P>
<P>THE Pope, finding his authority in Scotland exposed
to danger from the spreading of the new opinions, had
<PB N="251" REF="275"/>
bestowed on Beaton, the primate, the dignity of cardi∣nal;
and that prelate had been long regarded as prime
minister to James, and as the head of that party, which
defended the antient privileges and properties of the ec∣clesiastics.
Upon the death of his master, this man, ap∣prehensive
of the consequences both to his party and
himself, endeavoured to keep possession of the power;
and for that purpose, he is accused of executing a deed
which required a high degree of temerity. He forged,
it is said, a will for the King, appointing himself, and
three noblemen, regents of the kingdom during the mi∣nority
of the infant Princess<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Sadler's Letters, p. 161. Spotswood, p. 71. Buchanan, lib. 15.</NOTE>: At least, for historians
are not well agreed in the circumstances of the fact, he
had read to James a paper of that import, to which that
monarch, during the delirium which preceded his death,
had given an imperfect assent and approbation<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">John Knox, History of the reformation.</NOTE>. By
virtue of this will, Beaton had put himself in possession
of the government; and having joined his interests with
those of the Queen-dowager, he obtained the consent of
the convention of states, and excluded the pretensions of
the earl of Arran.</P>
<P>JAMES earl of Arran, of the name of Hamilton, was
next heir to the crown by his grandmother, daughter to
James the third; and on that account seemed best entitled
to possess that high office, into which the cardinal had
intruded himself. The prospect also of his succession af∣ter
a princess, who was in such tender infancy, procured
him many partizans; and though his character contained
little spirit, activity, or ambition, a propensity, which he
had discovered for the new opinions, had attached to
him all the zealous promoters of these innovations. By
means of these adherents, joined to the vassals of his
<PB N="252" REF="276"/>
family, he had been able to make opposition to the car∣dinal's
administration; and the suspicion of Beaton's
forgery, with the accession of the noblemen, who had
been prisoners in England, assisted too by some money,
sent from London, was able to turn the balance in his
favour. The earl of Angus, and his brother, having
taken the present opportunity of returning into their
own country, opposed the cardinal with all the force of
that powerful family; and the majority of the conven∣tion
had now embraced opposite interests to those which
formerly prevailed. Arran was declared governor; the
cardinal was committed to custody under the care of
lord Seton; and a negotiation was commenced with Sir
Ralph Sadler, the English ambassador, for the marriage
of the infant Queen with the Prince of Wales. The
following conditions were quickly agreed on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with Scot∣land.</NOTE> that the
Queen should remain in Scotland till she was ten years
of age; that she should then be sent to England to be
educated; that six Scots nobles should immediately be
delivered as hostages to Henry; and that the kingdom,
notwithstanding its union with England, should still pre∣serve
its laws and privileges<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sir Ralph Sadler's Letters.</NOTE>. By means of these equi∣table
conditions, the war between the nations, which
had threatened Scotland with such dismal calamities,
seemed to be fully composed, and to be changed into
perpetual concord and unanimity.</P>
<P>BUT the cardinal-primate, having prevailed on Seton
to restore him to his liberty, was able, by his intrigues,
to confound all these measures, which appeared to be so
well concerted. He assembled the most considerable ec∣clesiastics;
and having represented to them the imminent
danger, to which their revenues and privileges were ex∣posed,
he persuaded them to collect privately from the
<PB N="253" REF="277"/>
clergy a large sum of money, by which, if entrusted to
his management, he promised to overturn the schemes
of their enemies<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 15.</NOTE>. Besides the partizans, whom he ac∣quired
by pecuniary motives, he rouzed up the zeal of
those, who were attached to the catholic worship; and
he represented the union with England as the sure fore∣runner
of ruin to the church and to the antient religion.
The national antipathy of the Scots against the English.
nation, was also an infallible engine, by which the car∣dinal
wrought upon the people; and though the terror
of Henry's arms, and their inability to make resistance,
had procured a temporary assent to the alliance and mar∣riage
proposed, the settled habits of the nation produced
an extreme aversion to those measures. The English
ambassador and his train received many insults from per∣sons
whom the cardinal had incited to commit those
indignities, in hopes of bringing on a rupture. But
Sadler very prudently dissembled the matter; and waited
patiently till the day appointed for the delivery of the
hostages. He then demanded of the regent the perform∣ance
of that important article; but received for answer,
that his authority was very precarious, that the nation
had now taken a different impression, and that it was
not in his power to compel any of the nobility to deliver
themselves as hostages to the English. Sadler, foresee∣ing
the consequence of this refusal, sent a summons to
all those who had been prisoners in England, and re∣quired
them to fulfil the promise which they had given
of returning into custody. None of them showed so
much sentiment of honour, as to perform their engage∣ments,
except Gilbert Kennedy, earl of Cassilis. Henry
was so well pleased with the behaviour of this nobleman,
that he not only received him graciously, but honoured
<PB N="254" REF="278"/>
him with presents, gave him his liberty, and sent him
back to Scotland, with his two brothers, whom he had
left as hostages<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS behaviour of the Scots nobles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New rup∣ture.</NOTE> though it reflect∣ed
dishonour on the nation, was not unacceptable to the
cardinal, who foresaw, that all these persons would now
be deeply interested to maintain their enmity and oppo∣sition
to the English. And as a war was soon expected
with that kingdom, he found it necessary immediately to
apply to France, and to crave the assistance of that an∣tient
ally, during the present distresses of the Scots na∣tion.
Though Francis was fully sensible of his interest
in supporting Scotland, a demand of aid could not have
been made on him at a more unseasonable juncture. His
pretensions on the Milanese, and his resentment against
Charles, had engaged him in a war with that potentate;
and having made very great, though fruitless efforts
during the preceding campaign, he was the more disabled
at present from defending his own dominions, much
more from granting any succour to the Scots. Matthew
Stuart, earl of Lenox, a young nobleman of a great fa∣mily,
was at that time in the French court; and Francis,
being informed, that he was engaged in ancient and he∣reditary
enmity with the Hamiltons, who had murdered
his father, sent him over to his native country, as a sup∣port
to the cardinal and the Queen-mother: And he pro∣mised,
that a supply of money, and, if necessary, even
military succours, should soon be dispatched after him.
Arran, the governor, seeing all these preparations against
him, assembled his friends, and made an attempt to get
the person of the infant Queen into his custody; but
being repulsed, he was obliged to come to an accommo∣dation
with his enemies, and to entrust that precious
<PB N="255" REF="279"/>
charge to four neutral persons, the heads of potent fami∣lies,
the Grahams, Areskines, Lindseys, and Levistons.
The arrival of Lenox, in the midst of these transactions,
served to render the victory of the French party over
the English still more undisputable<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 15. Drummond.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE opposition which Henry met with in Scotland
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the French intrigues, excited his resentment, and
farther confirmed the resolution which he had before
taken, of breaking with France, and of uniting his
arms with those of the emperor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with France.</NOTE> He had other grounds
of complaint against the French King; which, though
they were not of great importance, yet being recent,
were able to overbalance those great injuries which he
had formerly received from Charles. He pretended, that
Francis had engaged to imitate his example in separating
himself entirely from the see of Rome, and that he had
broke his promise in that particular. He was dissatisfied,
that James, his nephew, had been allowed to marry,
first Magdalene of France, then a princess of the house
of Guise; and he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsidered these alliances as pledges
which Francis gave of his intentions to support the Scots
against the power of England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel.</NOTE>. He had been informed
of some railleries, which the French King had thrown
out against his conduct with regard to his wives. He
was disgusted, that Francis, after so many obligations
which he owed him, had sacrificed him to the emperor;
and, in the confidence of friendship, had rashly revealed
his secrets to that subtle and interested monarch. And
he complained, that regular payments were never made
of the sums due to him by France, and of the pension
which had been promised. Impelled by all these motives,
he alienated himself from his ancient friend and confe∣derate,
and formed a league with the emperor, who very
<PB N="256" REF="280"/>
earnestly courted his alliance. This league, besides sti∣pulations
for mutual defence, contained a plan for in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ading
France; and the two monarchs agreed to enter
Francis's dominions with an army, each of twenty-five
thousand men; and to require that prince to pay Henry
all the sums which he owed him, and to consign Bou∣logne,
Montreuil, Terouenne, and Ardres, as a security
for the regular payment of his pension for the future: In
case these conditions were rejected, the confederate princes
agreed, to challenge, for Henry, the crown of France,
and the dutchies of Normandy, Aquitaine, and Guienne;
for Charles, the dutchy of Burgundy, and some other
territories<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. p. 768. vol. xv. p. 2.</NOTE>. That they might have a pretence for en∣forcing
these claims, they sent a message to Francis, re∣quiring
him to renounce his alliance with Sultan Soly∣man,
and to make reparation for all the prejudice which
Christendom had suffered from that unnatural confede∣racy.
Upon the French King's refusal, war was de∣clared
against him by the confederates. It may be pro∣per
to observe, that the partizans of France objected to
Charles his alliance with the heretical King of England,
as no less odious than that which Francis had contracted
with Solyman: And they observed, that this league was
a breach of that solemn promise which he had given to
Clement the seventh, never to make peace or alliance
with England.</P>
<P>WHILE the treaty with the emperor was negociating,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Ja∣nuary. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE>
the King summoned a new session of Parliament, in or∣der
to obtain supplies for his projected war with France.
The Parliament granted him a subsidy to be paid in three
years: It was levied in a peculiar manner; but exceeded
not three shillings in the pound upon any individual<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">They who were worth in goods twenty shillings and upwards to five pounds, paid four pence of every pound; from five pounds to ten pounds, eight pence; from ten pounds to twenty pounds, sixteen pence; from twenty and upwards, two shillings. Lands, fees, and annuities, paid eight pence in the pound from twenty shillings to five pounds; from five pounds to ten pounds, sixteen pence; from ten pounds to twenty pounds, two shillings; from twenty pounds and up∣wards, three shillings.</NOTE>.
<PB N="257" REF="281"/>
The convocation gave the King six shillings in the
pound, to be levied in three years. Greater sums were
always, even during the establishment of the catholic re∣ligion,
exacted from the clergy than the laity: Which
made the emperor Charles say, when Henry dissolved the
monasteries, and sold their revenues, or bestowed them
on his nobility and courtiers, that he had killed the hen
which brought him the golden eggs<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament also facilitated the execution of
the former law, by which the King's proclamations
were made equal to statutes: They appointed, that any
nine counsellors should form a legal court for punishing
all disobedience to proclamations. The total abolition
of juries in criminal causes, as well as of all parliaments,
seemed, if the King had so pleased, the necessary conse∣quence
of this enormous law. He might issue a procla∣mation,
for the execution of any penal statute, and af∣terwards
try the criminals, not for breach of the statute,
but for disobedience to his proclamation. It is remark∣able,
that the lord Mountjoy entered a protest against
this law; and it is equally remarkable, that that protest
is the only one which was entered against any public
bill during this whole reign<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE have taken notice, in the end of the former chap∣ter,
of some laws regarding religion, which the Parlia∣ment
passed this session, in order to gratify the King's
humour. It was farther enacted<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">34 &amp; 35 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>, that every spiritual
<PB N="258" REF="282"/>
person, who preached or taught contrary to the doctrine
contained in the King's book, the <HI>Erudition of a christian
man,</HI> or contrary to any doctrine which he shall <HI>hence∣forth</HI>
promulgate, was to be admitted on the first convic∣tion
to renounce his errors; on the second, he was re∣quired
to carry a faggot; which if he refused to do, or
fell into a third offence, he was to be burnt. But the
laity, for the third offence, were only to forfeit their
goods and chattels, and to be liable to perpetual impri∣sonment.
Indictments must be laid within a year after
the offence, and the prisoner was allowed to bring wit∣nesses
for his purgation. These penalties were lighter
than those formerly imposed on a denial of transubstan∣tiation:
It was, however, subjoined in this statute, that
the act of the six articles was still in force. But in order
to make the King more entirely master of his people,
it was enacted, that he might hereafter, at his pleasure,
change this act, or any provision in it. By this clause,
both parties were retained in subjection; so far as regard∣ed
religion, the King was invested, in the fullest man∣ner,
with the sole legislative authority in his kingdom;
and all his subjects were, under the severst penalties,
expressly bound to receive implicitly, whatever doctrine
he should please to recommend to them.</P>
<P>THE reformers began to entertain hopes, that this
exorbitant power would be employed in their favour.
The King married Catherine Par,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th July.</NOTE> widow to Nevil lord
Latimer; a woman of virtue, and somewhat inclined to
the new doctrine. By this marriage, Henry made good
what had formerly been foretold in jest, that he would
be obliged to espouse a widow. The King's league with
the emperor, seemed to be a circumstance no less fa∣vourable
to the catholic party; and thus matters remained
still nearly balanced between the factions.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="283"/>
THE advantages gained by this powerful confederacy
between Henry and Charles, were very inconsiderable
during the present year. The campaign was opened with
a victory, gained by the duke of Cleves, Francis's ally,
over the forces of the emperor<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellay, lib. 10.</NOTE>: Francis, in person,
took the field early; and made himself master, without
resistance, of the whole dutchy of Luxembourg: He
afterwards took Landrecy, and added some fortifications
to it. Charles, having at last assembled a powerful ar∣my,
appeared in the Low Countries; and after taking
almost every fortress in the dutchy of Cleves, he reduced
the duke to submit to the terms which he was pleased to
prescribe to him. Being then joined by a body of six
thousand English, he sat down before Landrecy, and
covered the siege with an army of above forty thousand
men. Francis advanced at the head of an army not
much inferior; as if he intended to give the emperor
battle, or oblige him to abandon the siege: But while
these two rival monarchs were facing each other, and
all the world stood in expectation of some great event;
the French found means to throw succours into Lan∣drecy,
and having thus effected their purpose, they skil∣fully
made a retreat. Charles, finding the season far ad∣vanced,
despaired of success in his enterprize, and found
it necessary to raise the siege.</P>
<P>THE vanity of Henry was flattered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> by the figure
which he made in the great transactions on the conti∣nent:
But the interests of his kingdom were much more
deeply concerned in the event of affairs in Scotland.
Arran, the governor, was of so indolent and unambi∣tious
a character, that had he not been stimulated by
his friends and dependants, he never had aspired to any
share in the administration; and when he found him∣self
<PB N="260" REF="284"/>
overpowered by the party of the Queen-dowageer, the
cardinal, and the earl of Lenox, he was glad to accept
of any terms of accommodation, however dishonourable.
He even gave them a sure pledge of his sincerity, by re∣nouncing
the principles of the reformers, and reconciling
himself to the Romish communion in the Franciscan
church at Stirling. By this weakness and levity he lost
his credit with the whole nation, and rendered the pro∣testants,
who were hitherto the chief support of his
power, his most mortal enemies. The cardinal acquired
the entire ascendant in the kingdom: The Queen-dow∣ager
put implicit confidence in him: The governor was
obliged to yield to him in every pretension: Lenox alone
was become an obstacle to his measures, and reduced
him to some difficulty.</P>
<P>THE inveterate enmity which had taken place between
the families of Lenox and Arran, made the interests
of these two noblemen entirely incompatible; and as the
cardinal and the French party, in order to engage Lenox
the more in their cause, had flattered him with the hopes
of succeeding to the crown after their infant sovereign,
this rivalship had tended still farther to rouze the animo∣sity
of the Hamiltons. Lenox too had been encouraged
to aspire to the marriage of the Queen-dowager, which
would have given him some pretensions to the regency;
and as he was become assuming, on account of the ser∣vices
which he had rendered the party, the cardinal
found, that, since he must choose between the friend∣ship
of Lenox and Arran, the latter nobleman, who
was more easily governed, and who was invested with
present authority, was in every respect preferable. In
order to remove the former, after the easiest and least ob∣noxious
manner, he wrote to Francis, with whom he
had entire credit, by means of the duke of Guise, father
to the Queen-dowager; and after praising Lenox for his
<PB N="261" REF="285"/>
past services, he represented the present difficulties and
obstructions, which he occasioned in the administration,
and desired that he might be recalled to France, where
he enjoyed great credit and large possessions. But the
impatience of Lenox to attain his purposes, allowed not
this political artifice leisure to operate. Finding that he
was not likely to succeed in his pretensions to the Queen∣dowager,
and that Arran prevailed in every contest, he
retired to Dunbarton, the governor of which was en∣tirely
in his interests; he entered into a secret negocia∣tion
with the English court; and he summoned his vas∣sals
and partizans to attend him. All those who were
inclined to the protestant religion, or were on any ac∣count
discontented with the cardinal's administration,
now regarded Lenox as the head of their party; and
they readily made him a tender of their services. In a
little time, he had collected an army of ten thousand
men, and he threatened his enemies with immediate de∣struction.
The cardinal had no equal force to oppose to
him; but as he was a prudent man, he foresaw that Le∣nox
could not long subsist so great an army, and he en∣deavoured
to protract time, by opening a negociation
with him. He seduced his followers, by various arti∣fices;
he engaged the Douglasses in his interests; he re∣presented
to the whole nation the danger of civil wars
and commotions. And Lenox, finding himself engaged
in an unequal contest, was at last obliged to lay down
his arms, and to accept of terms of accommodation with
the governor and the cardinal. Present peace was re∣stored;
but no confidence took place between the par∣ties.
Lenox, fortifying his castles, and putting him∣self
in a posture of defence, waited the succours of the
English, from whose assistance alone he expected to ob∣tain
the superiority over his enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="286"/>
WHILE the winter season restrained Henry from mili∣tary
operations, he summoned a new Parliament; where
a law was passed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1544.</NOTE> such as he was pleased to dictate, with
regard to the succession of the crown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Janu∣ary. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> After declaring,
that the prince of Wales, or any of the King's male
issue, were first and immediate heirs to the kingdom, the
Parliament restored the two princesses, Mary and Eliza∣beth,
to their right of succession. This seemed a rea∣sonable
piece of justice, and corrected what the King's
former violence had thrown into confusion; but it was
impossible for Henry to do any thing, however laudable,
without betraying, in some circumstances, his usual ca∣price
and extravagance: Though he opened the way for
these two princesses to mount the throne, he would not
allow the act to be reversed which had declared them
both illegitimate; he made the Parliament confer on
him a power of still excluding them, if they refused to
submit to any conditions which he should be pleased to
impose; and he required them to enact, that, in default
of his own issue, he might dispose of the crown, as he
pleased, by will or letters patent. He did not probably
foresee, that in proportion as he degraded the Parlia∣ment,
by rendering them the passive instrument of his
variable and violent inclinations, he taught the people to
regard all their acts as invalid, and thereby defeated even
the purposes which he was so bent to attain.</P>
<P>AN act was passed, that the King's usual stile should
be “King of England, France, and Ireland, defender
of the faith, and on earth the supreme head of the
church of England and Ireland.” It seemed a pal∣pable
inconsistency, to retain the title of Defender of the
faith, which the see of Rome had conferred on him for
maintaining its cause against Luther; and yet subjoin his
ecclesiastical supremacy, in opposition to the claims of
that see.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="287"/>
AN act was also passed, for the remission of the debts,
which the King had lately contracted by a general loan,
exacted from the people. It will easily be believed, that,
after the former act of this kind, the loan was not en∣tirely
voluntary<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">35 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</NOTE>. But there was a peculiar circumstance
attending the present statute, which none but Henry would
have thought of: That those who had already got pay∣ment,
either in whole or in part, should refund the sums
to the exchequer.</P>
<P>THE oaths which Henry established for the security
of his ecclesiastical model, were not more reasonable
than his other measures. All his subjects of any dis∣tinction
had already been obliged to renounce the pope's
supremacy; but as the clauses which they swore to, had
not been deemed entirely satisfactory, another oath was
imposed, and it was added, that all those who had taken
the former oaths, should be understood to have taken
the new one<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">35 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. A strange supposition! to represent men
as bound by an oath which they had never consented to
take.</P>
<P>THE most commendable act to which the Parliament
gave their sanction, was that by which they mitigated
the law of the six articles, and ordained, that no per∣son
should be put to his trial upon any accusation con∣cerning
any of the offences comprized in that sanguinary
statute, except on the oath of twelve persons before
commissioners authorized for that purpose; and that no
person should be arrested or committed to ward for any
such offence before he was indicted. Any preacher, ac∣cused
of speaking in his sermon contrary to these arti∣cles,
must be indicted within forty days.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="288"/>
THE King always experienced the limits of his exor∣bitant
authority whenever he demanded subsidies, how∣ever
moderate, from the Parliament; and, therefore,
not to hazard a refusal, he made no mention this session
of a supply: But as his wars both with France and
Scotland, as well as his usual prodigality, had involved
him in great expence, he had recourse to other methods
of filling his treasury: Notwithstanding the former abo∣lition
of his debts, he yet required new loans from his
subjects: And he enhanced gold from forty-five shillings
to forty-eight an ounce; and silver from three shillings
and nine pence to four shillings. His pretence for this
innovation, was to prevent the money from being ex∣ported;
as if that expedient could anywise serve the
purpose. He even coined some base money, and ordered
it to be current by his proclamation. He named com∣missioners
for levying a benevolence, and he extorted
about seventy thousand pounds by that expedient. Read,
alderman of London<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stowe, p. 588. Baker, p. 292.</NOTE>, a man somewhat advanced in
years, having refused to contribute his share, or not
coming up to the expectations of the commissioners,
was inrolled as a foot soldier in the Scottish wars, and
was there taken prisoner. Roach, who had been equal∣ly
refractory, was thrown into prison, and obtained not
his liberty but by paying a large composition<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals. Stowe, p. 588.</NOTE>. These
powers of the prerogative, (which at that time passed
for unquestioned) the King's compelling any man to
serve in any office, and imprisoning any man during
pleasure, not to mention the practice of extorting loans,
rendered the sovereign, in a manner, absolute master
of the person and property of every individual.</P>
<P>EARLY this year the King sent a fleet and army to
invade Scotland. The fleet consisted of near two
<PB N="265" REF="289"/>
hundred vessels, and carried on board ten thousand men.
Dudley lord Lisle commanded the sea forces; the earl of
Hertford the land. The troops were disembarked near
Leith; and after dissipating a small body which opposed
them, they took that town without resistance, and then
marched to Edinburgh. The gates were soon beat down
(for little or no resistance was made); and the English
first pillaged, and then set fire to the city. The regent
and cardinal were not prepared to oppose so great a force,
and they fled to Stirling. Hertford marched eastward;
and being joined by a new body under Evers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th May.</NOTE> warden
of the east marches, he laid waste the whole country,
burned and destroyed Haddington and Dunbar, and then
retired into England; having lost only forty men in the
whole expedition. The earl of Arran collected some
forces; but finding that the English were already de∣parted,
he turned them against Lenox, who was justly
suspected of a correspondence with the enemy. That
nobleman, after making some resistance, was obliged to
fly into England; where Henry settled a pension on
him, and even gave him his niece, the lady Margaret
Douglas, in marriage. In return, Lenox stipulated con∣ditions,
by which, had he been able to execute them,
he must have reduced his country to a total servitude<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xv. p. 23, 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY's policy was blamed in this sudden and vio∣lent
incursion; by which he inflamed the passion of the
Scots, without subduing their spirit; and it was com∣monly
said, that he did too much, if he intended to so∣licit
an alliance, and too little, if he meant a conquest<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE>.
But the reason of his withdrawing the troops so soon, was
his eagerness to carry on his projected enterprize against
France, in which he intended to employ the whole force
of his kingdom. He had concerted a plan with the em∣peror,
<PB N="266" REF="290"/>
which threatened the total ruin of that monar∣chy,
and must, as a necessary consequence, have in∣volved
the subjection of England. These two princes
had agreed to invade France with forces amounting to
above a hundred thousand men: Henry engaged to set
out from Calais; Charles from the Low Countries:
They were to enter on no siege, but leaving all the fron∣tier
towns behind them, to march directly to Paris, where
they were to join their forces, and thence to proceed
to the entire conquest of the kingdom. Francis could
not oppose to these formidable preparations, much above
forty thousand men.</P>
<P>HENRY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th July. Campaign in France.</NOTE> having appointed the Queen regent during
his absence, passed over to Calais with thirty thousand
men, accompanied with the dukes of Norfolk and Suf∣folk,
Fitzalan earl of Arundel, Vere earl of Oxford,
the earl of Surrey, Paulet lord St. John, lord Ferrers
of Chartley, lord Mountjoy, lord Grey of Wilton, Sir
Anthony Brown, Sir Francis Bryan, and the most flou∣rishing
nobility and gentry of his kingdom. The Eng∣lish
army was soon joined by the count de Buren, admi∣ral
of Flanders, with ten thousand foot, and four thou∣sand
horse; and the whole composed an army, which
nothing on that frontier was able to resist. The chief
force of the French army was drawn to the side of Cham∣pagne,
in order to oppose the imperialists.</P>
<P>THE emperor, with an army of near sixty thousand
men, had taken the field much earlier than Henry; and
not to lose time, while he waited for the march of his
confederate, he sat down before Luxembourg, which he
took: He thence proceeded to Commercy on the Meuse,
which was surrendered to him: Ligny met with the
same fate: He next laid siege to St. Disier on the Marne▪
which, though a weak place, made a brave resistance
<PB N="267" REF="291"/>
under the count de Sancerre, the governor, and the siege
was protracted beyond expectation.</P>
<P>THE emperor was employed before this town at the
time the English forces were assembled in Picardy.
Henry, either tempted by the defenceless condition of
the French frontiers, or thinking that the emperor had
first broke engagements by forming sieges, or, perhaps,
foreseeing at last the dangerous consequences of destroy∣ing
entirely the French power, instead of marching for∣ward
to Paris, sat down before Montreuil and Boulogne.
The duke of Norfolk commanded the army before Mon∣treuil:
The King himself that before Boulogne. Ver∣vin
was governor of Boulogne, and under him Philip
Corse, a brave old soldier, who encouraged the garrison
to defend themselves to the last extremity against the
English.<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Sep∣tember.</NOTE> He was killed during the course of the siege,
and the town was immediately surrendered to Henry by
the cowardice of Vervin; who was afterwards beheaded
for this dishonourable capitulation.</P>
<P>DURING the course of this siege, Charles had taken
St. Disier; and finding the season much advanced, he
began to hearken to a treaty of peace with France, since
all his schemes for subduing that kingdom were likely to
prove abortive. In order to have a pretence for deserting
his ally, he sent a messenger to the English camp, re∣quiring
Henry immediately to fulfil his engagements, and
to meet him with his army before Paris. Henry replied,
that he was too far engaged in the siege of Boulogne to
raise it with honour, and that the emperor himself had
first broke the concert by forming sieges. This answer
served Charles as a sufficient reason for concluding a
peace with Francis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Sep∣tember.</NOTE> at Crepy, where no mention was
made of the English. He stipulated to give Flanders as
a dowry to his daughter, whom he agreed to marry to
<PB N="268" REF="292"/>
the duke of Orleans, Francis's second son; and Francis,
in return, withdrew his troops from Piemont and Savoy,
and renounced all claim to Milan, Naples, and other ter∣ritories
in Italy. This peace, so advantageous to Fran∣cis,
was procured partly by the decisive victory obtained
in the beginning of the campaign by the count d'Anguy∣en
over the imperialists at Cerisolles in Piemont, partly
by the emperor's great desire to turn his arms against the
protestant princes in Germany. Charles ordered his
troops to separate from the English in Picardy; and
Henry, finding himself obliged to raise the siege of Mon∣treuil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Sep∣tember.</NOTE>
returned into England. This campaign served,
to the populace, as matter of great triumph; but all men
of sense concluded, that the King had, as in all his for∣mer
military enterprizes, made, at an infinite charge, an
acquisition which was of no manner of consequence.</P>
<P>THE war with Scotland, meanwhile, was conducted
feebly, and with various success. Sir Ralph Evers, now
lord Evers, and Sir Bryan Latoun, made an inroad into
that kingdom; and having laid waste the counties of Ti∣viotdale
and the Merse, they proceeded to the abbey of
Coldingham, which they took possession of, and fortified.
The regent assembled an army of eight thousand men, in
order to dislodge them from this post; but he had no
sooner opened his batteries before the place, than a sud∣den
panic seized him, and he fled to Dunbar. He com∣plained
of the mutinies of his army, and pretended to be
afraid lest they should deliver him into the hands of the
English: But hid own unwarlike spirit was generally be∣lieved
to have been the motive of this dishonourable re∣treat.
The Scots army, upon the departure of their
general, immediately fell into confusion; and had not
Angus, with a few of his retainers, brought off the can∣non,
and protected their rear, the English might have
gained great advantages over them. Evers, elated with
<PB N="269" REF="293"/>
this success, boasted to Henry, that he had conquered
all Scotland to the Forth; and he claimed a reward for
this important service. The duke of Norfolk, who knew
with what difficulty such acquisitions would be maintain∣ed
against a warlike people, advised the King to grant
him, as his reward, the conquests of which he so highly
boasted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1545.</NOTE> The next inroad made by the English, shewed
the vanity of Evers's hopes. This general led about
five thousand men into Tiviotdale, and was employed in
ravaging that country; when intelligence was brought
him, that some Scots forces appeared near the abbey of
Melross. Angus had excited the regent to more activity;
and a proclamation being issued for assembling the troops
of the neighbouring counties, a considerable body had
repaired to his standard. Norman Lesly, son to the earl
of Rothes, had also joined the army with some volun∣teers
from Fife; and he inspired courage into the whole,
as well by this accession of force, as by his personal bra∣very
and intrepidity. In order to bring their troops to
the necessity of a steady defence, the Scots leaders or∣dered
all their cavalry to dismount; and they resolved to
wait, on some high grounds at Ancram, the assault of
the English. The English, whose past successes had
taught them too much to despise the enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of February.</NOTE> thought,
when they saw the Scots horses led off the field, that the
whole army was retiring; and they hastened to attack
them. The Scots received them in good order; and be∣ing
favoured by the advantage of the ground, as well as
by the surprize of the English, who expected no resist∣ance,
they soon put them to flight, and pursued them
with a considerable slaughter. Evers and Latoun were
both killed, and above a thousand men were made pri∣soners.
In order to support the Scots in this war, Fran∣cis,
some time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter, sent over a body of auxiliaries, to
the number of three thousand five hundred men, under
<PB N="270" REF="294"/>
the command of Montgomery, lord of Lorges<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 15. Drummond.</NOTE>. Re∣inforced
by these succours, the regent assembled an army
of fifteen thousand men at Haddington, and marched
thence to ravage the east borders of England. They
laid all waste wherever they came; and having met with
no considerable resistance, they retired into their own
country, and dispersed themselves. The earl of Hert∣ford,
in revenge, committed ravages on the middle and
west marches; and the war on both sides was signalized
rather by the ills inflicted on the enemy, than by any
considerable advantage gained by either party.</P>
<P>THE war likewise between France and England was not
distinguished this year by any memorable events. Francis
had equipped a fleet of above two hundred sail, besides
gallies; and having embarked some land forces on board,
he sent them to make a descent in England<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Beleair. Memoires du Bellay.</NOTE>. They
sailed to the Isle of Wight, where they found the Eng∣lish
fleet lying at anchor in St. Helens. It consisted not
of above an hundred sail; and the admiral thought it
most advisable to remain in that road, in hopes of draw∣ing
the French into the narrow passages and rocks,
which were unknown to them. The two fleets canno∣naded
one another for two days; and except the sinking
of the Mary Rose, one of the largest ships of the English
fleet, the damage on both sides was inconsiderable. The
French landed troops in the Isle of Wight, and com∣mitted
ravages; but being repulsed by the militia of the
country, they retired to their ships, which soon after set
sail for France. They were again driven by the wind
on the coast of England, where they met with the Eng∣lish
fleet; and a new cannonading ensued, which proved
no more decisive than the foregoing. It was indeed
<PB N="271" REF="295"/>
scarce possible, that a fleet at that time could, without
boarding, gain any considerable advantage over the
enemy. The cannon were commonly so ill served, that
a French writer of memoirs<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">De Langey.</NOTE> observes, as a circumstance
somewhat singular, that each of these numerous fleets in
a two hours engagement, fired full three hundred shot.
One small ship in our time could, without difficulty, do
thrice as much.</P>
<P>FRANCIS's chief intention, in equipping so great a
fleet, was to prevent the English from throwing succours
into Boulogne, which he intended to besiege; and for
that purpose, he ordered a fort to be built, by which he
proposed to block up the harbour. After a considerable
loss of money and time, the fort was found so ill con∣structed,
that he was obliged to abandon it; and though
he had brought together, on that frontier, an army of
near forty thousand men, he was not able to effect any
considerable enterprize. He broke into the territory of
Oye, an extent of country which lies near Calais, and
which served commonly to supply the garrison with pro∣visions;
and he laid it entirely waste by fire and sword.
Several skirmishes ensued between the French and Eng∣lish,
in one of which the duke of Aumale received a
remarkable wound. A lance was run into his head
between his eye and nose; and notwithstanding that
the lance broke and the head of it remained in the
wound, he was not dismounted by so violent a shock,
and the head of the lance being extracted by a skilful sur∣geon,
he afterwards recovered, and rendered himself ex∣tremely
famous by the name of the duke of Guise.
Henry, in order to defend his dominions in France, had
levied fourteen thousand Germans; who, having march∣ed
to Fleurines in the bishopric of Liege, found that
<PB N="272" REF="296"/>
they could advance no farther. The emperor would
not allow them a passage through his dominions: They
received intelligence of a superior army on the side of
France ready to intercept them: Idleness and want of
pay soon bred a mutiny among them: And having seized
the English commissaries as a security for arrears, they
retreated into their own country. There seems to have
been some want of foresight and contrivance in this ex∣pensive
armament.</P>
<P>THE great expence of these two wars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d No∣vember. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> maintained by
Henry, obliged him to summon a new Parliament. The
commons granted him a subsidy, payable in two years,
of two shillings a pound on land<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Those who possessed goods or money, above five pound and below ten, were to pay eight pence a pound: Those above ten pound, a shilling.</NOTE>: The spirituality
voted him six shillings a pound. But the Parliament,
apprehensive left more demands should be made upon
them, thought to save themselves by a very extraordinary
liberality of other people's property; and by one vote
they bestowed on the King all the revenues of the uni∣versities,
as well as of the chauntries, free chapels<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">A chauntry was a little church, chapel, or particular altar in some cathedral church, &amp;c. endowed with lands or other revenues for the maintenance of one or more priests, daily to say mass or perform divine service, for the use of the founders, or such others as they ap∣pointed: Free chapels were independent on any church, and endowed for much the same purpose as the former.

hospitals. Henry was pleased with this concession, as it
encreased his power; but he had no intention of despoil∣ing
learning of all her endowments; and he soon took
care to inform the universities, that he meant not to
touch their revenues. Thus these antient and celebrated
establishments owed their subsisting to the generosity of
<PB N="273" REF="297"/>
the King, not to the protection of this servile and prosti∣tute
Parliament.</P>
<P>THE prostitute spirit of the Parliament appeared far∣ther
in the preamble of a statute<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">37 Hen. VIII. c. 17.</NOTE>; in which they re∣cognize
the King to have always been by the word of
God supreme head of the church of England, and ac∣knowledge,
that archbishops, bishops, and other eccle∣siastical
persons, have no manner of jurisdiction but by
his royal mandate: To him alone, say they, and such
persons as he shall appoint, full authority and power is
given from above to hear and determine all manner
of causes ecclesiastical, and to correct all manner of
heresies, errors, vices and sins whatsoever. No men∣tion
is here made of the concurrence of a convocation,
nor even of a Parliament. His Proclamations are ac∣knowledged
to have not only the force of a law, but the
authority of a revelation; and by his royal power he may
regulate the actions of men, and even direct their in∣ward
sentiments and opinions.</P>
<P>THE King made in person a speech to the Parliament
on proroguing them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th De∣cember.</NOTE> where, after thanking them for
their loving attachment to him, which, he said, equalled
what was ever paid by their ancestors to any King of
England, he complained of their diffensions, disputes and
animosities in religion. He told them, that the several
pulpits were become a kind of batteries against each
other; and that one preacher called another heretic and
anabaptist, which was retaliated by the opprobrious
terms of papist and hypocrite: That he had permitted
his people the use of the Scriptures, not in order to fur∣nish
them materials for dispute and railing, but that he
might enable them to inform their consciences and in∣struct
their children and families: That it grieved his
<PB N="274" REF="298"/>
heart to find how that precious jewel was prostituted, by
being introduced into the conversation of every alehouse
and tavern, and employed as a pretence for decrying the
spiritual and legal pastors: And that he was sorry to ob∣serve,
that the word of God, while it was the object of
so much anxious speculation, had very little influence on
their practice; and that tho' an imaginary knowlege so
much abounded, charity was daily going to decay<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 261. Herbert, p. 534.</NOTE>. The
King gave good advice; but his own example, by encou∣raging
speculation and dispute, was ill qualified to pro∣mote
that peaceable submission of opinion, which he
recommended.</P>
<P>HENRY employed in military preparations the money
granted by Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1546.</NOTE> and he sent over the earl of
Hertford, and lord Lisle the admiral, to Calais with a
body of nine thousand men, two thirds of which con∣sisted
of foreigners. Some skirmishes ensued of small
consequence; and no hopes of any considerable progress
could be entertained by either side. Henry, whose ani∣mosity
against Francis was not violent, had given suffi∣cient
vent to his humour by this short war; and finding,
that from his great encrease in corpulence and decay in
strength, he could not hope for much longer life, he
was desirous of ending a quarrel, which might prove
dangerous to his kingdom during a minority. Francis
likewise, on his part, was not averse to peace with Eng∣land;
because, having lately lost his son, the duke of
Orleans, he revived his antient claim upon Milan, and
foresaw, that hostilities must soon, on that account, break
out between him and the Emperor. Commissioners
therefore having met at Campe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th June. Peace with France and Scotland.</NOTE> a place between Ardres
and Guisnes, the articles were soon agreed on, and the
peace signed by them. The chief conditions were, that
<PB N="275" REF="299"/>
Henry should retain Boulogne during eight years, or till
the former debt due by Francis should be paid. This
debt was settled at two millions of livres, besides a claim
of 500,000 livres, which was afterwards to be adjusted,
Francis took care to comprehend Scotland in the treaty.
Thus all that Henry obtained by a war, which cost him
above one million three hundred and forty thousand
pounds sterling<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stowe.</NOTE>, was a bad security for a debt, which
was not a third of the value.</P>
<P>THE King, being now freed from all foreign wars,
had leisure to give his attention to domestic affairs; and
particularly to the establishment of uniformity of opinion,
on which he was so intent. Tho' he allowed an English
translation of the Bible, he had hitherto been very care∣ful
to keep the mass in Latin; but he was at last prevailed
with to permit, that the Litany, a considerable part of
the public service, should be celebrated in the vulgar
tongue; and by this innovation, he excited anew the
hopes of the reformers, who had been somewhat discou∣raged
by the severity of the statute of the six articles.
One petition of the new Litany was a prayer to save us
<HI>from the tyranny of the bishop of Rome, and from all his
detestable enormities.</HI> Cranmer was employing his autho∣rity
to engage Henry to farther innovations; and he took
advantage of Gardiner's absence, who was sent in an em∣bassy
to the emperor; but Gardiner, having wrote to the
King, that, if he carried his opposition against the catho∣lic
religion to greater extremities, Charles threatened to
break off all commerce with him, the success of Cran∣mer's
projects was for that time retarded. Cranmer
lost this year the most sincere and most powerful friend,
whom he possessed at court; Charles Brandon, duke of
Suffolk: The Queen-dowager of France, spouse to
<PB N="276" REF="300"/>
Suffolk, had died some years before. This nobleman is one
instance, that Henry was not altogether incapable of a
cordial and steady friendship; and Suffolk seems to have
been entirely worthy of that favour, which, from his
earliest youth, he had enjoyed with him. The King
was sitting in council when informed of Suffolk's death;
and he took that occasion both to express his own sorrow
for the loss, and to celebrate the merits of the deceased.
He declared, that, during the whole course of their cor∣respondence,
his brother-in-law had not made any attempt
to injure an adversary, and had never whispered a word
to the disadvantage of any one. “Is there any of you,
my lords, who can say as much?” When the King
subjoined these words, he looked round in all their faces,
and saw that confusion, which the consciousness of secret
guilt naturally threw upon them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Coke's Inst. cap. 99.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CRANMER himself, when bereaved of this support,
was the more exposed to those cabals of the courtiers,
which the opposition of party and religion, joined to the
usual motives of interest, rendered so frequent among
Henry's ministers and counsellors. The catholics took
hold of the King by his passion for orthodoxy; and they
represented to him, that, if his laudable zeal for inforc∣ing
the truth met with no greater success, it was owing
altogether to the primate, whose example and encou∣ragement
were, in reality, the secret supports of heresy.
Henry, seeing the point to which they tended, seigned a
compliance, and desired the council to make enquiry into
Cranmer's conduct; promising that, if he was found
guilty, he would send him to the Tower, and bring him
to condign punishment. All the world now gave the
primate for lost; and his old friends, from mercenary
views, as well as the opposite party, from animosity, be∣gan
<PB N="277" REF="301"/>
gan to show him marks of neglect and disregard. He
was obliged to stand several hours among the lacqueys at
the door of the council-chamber, before he could be ad∣mitted;
and when he was at last called in, he was told,
that they had determined to send him to the Tower.
Cranmer said, that he appealed to the King himself;
and finding his appeal disregarded, he produced a ring,
which Henry had given him as a pledge of favour and
protection. The council were confounded; and when
they came before the King, he reproved them, in the
severest terms, and told them, that he was well acquainted
with Cranmer's merit, as well as with their malignity
and envy: But he was determined to crush all their ca∣bals,
and to teach them, by the severest discipline, since
gentle methods were in vain, a more dutiful concurrence
in promoting his service. Norfolk, who was Cranmer's
capital enemy, apologized for their conduct, by saying,
that their only intention was to set the primate's inno∣cence
in a full light by bringing him to an open trial:
And Henry obliged them all to embrace him, as a sign
of their cordial reconciliation. The mild temper of
Cranmer rendered this reconciliation more sincere on his
part, than is usual in such forced compliances<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burner, vol. i. p. 343, 344. Antiq. Brit. in vita Granm.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUt tho' Henry's favour for Cranmer rendered fruitless
all accusations against him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persecutions.</NOTE> his pride and peevishness,
irritated by his declining state of health, carried him to pu∣nish
with fresh severity all others who presumed to enter∣tain
a different opinion from himself, particularly in the ca∣pital
point of the real presence. Anne Ascue, a young
woman of merit as well as beauty<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Bale, Speed, 780.</NOTE>, who had great con∣nexions
with the chief ladies at court, and with the
Queen herself, was accused of dogmatizing on that de∣licate
<PB N="278" REF="302"/>
article; and Henry, instead of having indulgence
to the weakness of her sex and age, was but the more
provoked, that a woman should dare to oppose his theo∣logical
sentiments. She was prevailed on by Bonner's
menaces to make a seeming recantation; but she quail∣fied
it with some reserves, which did not satisfy that
zealous prelate. She was thrown into prison, and there
employed herself in composing prayers and discourses,
by which she fortified her resolution to endure the utmost
extremity rather than relinquish her religious principles.
She even wrote to the King, and told him, that as to
the Lord's Supper, she believed as much as Christ him∣self
had said of it, and as much of his divine doctrine as
the catholic church had required: But while she could
not be brought to acknowlege an assent to the King's
explications, this declaration availed her nothing, and
was rather regarded as a fresh insult. The chancellor,
Wriothesely, who had succeeded Audley, and who was
much attached to the catholic party, was sent to examine
her with regard to her patrons at court, and the great
ladies who were in correspondence with her: But she
maintained a very laudable fidelity to her friends, and
would confess nothing. She was put to the torture in
the most cruel manner, and continued still resolute in
preserving secrecy. Some authors<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. 578. Speed, p. 780. Baker, p. 299. But Burnet questions the truth of this circumstance: Fox, however, transcribes her own paper, where she relates it. I must add, in justice to the king, that he disapproved of Wriothesely's conduct, and commended the lieutenant.</NOTE> add a very extraordi∣nary
circumstance: That the chancellor, who stood by,
ordered the lieutenant of the Tower to stretch the rack
farther; but the lieutenant refused compliance with that
cruelty: The chancellor menaced him; but met with a
<PB N="279" REF="303"/>
new refusal: Upon which that magistrate, who was
otherwise a person of merit, but intoxicated with religi∣ous
zeal, put his own hand to the rack, and drew it so
violently that he almost tore her body asunder. Her
constancy still surpassed the barbarity of her persecutors,
and they found all their efforts to be baff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. She was
then condemned to be burned alive; and being so dislo∣cated
by the rack, that she could not stand, she was car∣ried
to the stake in a chair. Together with her, were
brought Nicholas Belenian, a priest, John Lassels of the
King's family, and John Adams a taylor, who had been
condemned for the same crime to the same punishment.
They were all tied to the stake; and in that dreadful
situation, the chancellor sent to inform them, that their
pardon was ready drawn and s;igned, and should instantly
be given them, if they would merit it by a recantation.
They only regarded this offer as a new ornament to their
crown of martyrdom; and they saw with tranquillity the
executioner kindle the flames which consumed them.
Wriothesely did not consider, that this public and noted
situation interested their honour the more to maintain a
steady perseverance.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the secrecy and fidelity of Anne Ascue saved
the Queen from this peril, she soon after fell into a new
danger, from which she very narrowly escaped. There
was an ulcer broke out in the King's leg, which, joined
to his extreme corpulency and his bad habit of body, be∣gan,
both to threaten his life, and to render him, even
more than usual, peevish and passionate. The Queen,
during this time, attended him with the most tender and
dutiful care, and endeavoured, by every foothing art and
compliance, to allay those gusts of humour, to which he
was become so subject. His favourite topic of conversa∣tion
was theology; and Catherine, whose good sense
<PB N="280" REF="304"/>
made her capable of discoursing on any subject, was fre∣quently
engaged into the argument; and being secretly
inclined to the principles of the reformers, she unwarily
discovered too much of her mind on these occasions.
Henry, highly provoked that she should presume to differ
from him, made complaints of her obstinacy to Gardiner,
who gladly laid hold of the opportunity to inflame the
quarrel. He praised the King's anxious care for pre∣serving
the orthodoxy of his subjects; and represented,
that the more elevated the person was who was chastised,
and the more near to his person, the greater terror
would the example strike into every one, and the more
glorious would the sacrifice appear to all posterity. The
chancellor, being consulted, was engaged by religious
zeal to second these topics; and Henry, hurried by his
own impetuous temper, and encouraged by his counsel∣lors,
went so far as to order articles of impeachment to
be drawn up against his consort. Wriothesely executed
his commands; and soon after brought the paper to him
to be signed: For as it was high treason to throw slander
upon the Queen, he might otherwise have been questioned
for his temerity. In going home, he chanced to drop
this important paper from his pocket; and as some person
of the Queen's party found it, it was immediately carried
to her. She was sensible of the extreme danger to which
she was exposed; but did not despair of being able, by
her prudence and address, still to elude the efforts of her
enemies. She paid her usual visit to the King, and found
him in a more serene disposition than she had reason to
expect. He entered on the subject which was so familiar
to him, and he seemed to challenge her to an argument
in divinity. She gently declined the conversation, and
observed, that such profound speculations were ill suited
to the natural imbecillity of her sex. Women, she said,
<PB N="281" REF="305"/>
by their first creation, were made subject to men: The
male was created after the image of God; the female
after the image of the male: It belonged to the husband
to choose principles for his wife; the wife's duty was, in
all cases, to adopt implicitly the sentiments of her hus∣band:
And as to herself, it was doubly her duty, being
blest with a husband, who was qualified, by his judgment
and learning, not only to choose principles for his own
family, but for the most wife and knowing of every na∣tion.
“Not so! by St. Mary,” replied the King, “you
are now become a doctor, Kate; and better fitted to
give than receive instructions.” She meekly replied,
that she was sensible how little she was intitled to these
praises; that though she usually declined not any con∣versation,
however sublime, when proposed by his ma∣jesty,
she well knew, that her conceptions could serve to
no other purpose than to give him a little momentary
amusement; that she found the conversation apt to lan∣guish
when not revived by some opposition, and had ven∣tured
sometimes to feign a contrariety of sentiments, in
order to give him the pleasure of refuting her; and that
she also proposed, by this innocent artifice, to engage
him into topics, whence, she had observed, by frequent
experience, that she reaped profit and instruction. “And
is it so, sweet-heart?” replied the King, “then we
are perfect friends again.” He embraced her with
great affection, and sent her away with assurances of his
protection and kindness. Her enemies, who knew no∣thing
of this turn, prepared next day to convey her to
the Tower, pursuant to the King's warrant. Henry and
Catherine were conversing amicably in the garden, when
the chancellor appeared with forty of the pursuivants.
The King spoke to him at some distance from her; and
seemed to expostulate with him in the severest manner:
She even overheard the terms of <HI>knave, fool,</HI> and <HI>beast,</HI>
<PB N="282" REF="306"/>
which he very liberally bestowed upon that magistrate;
and then ordered him to depart his presence. She after∣wards
interposed to mitigate his anger: He said to her,
“Poor soul! you know not how little intitled this man
is to your good offices.” From thenceforth, the
Queen, having narrowly escaped so great a danger, was
careful not to offend Henry's humour by any contradic∣tion;
and Gardiner, whose malice had endeavoured to
widen the breach, could never afterwards recover his fa∣vour
and good opinion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 344. Herbert, p. 560. Speed, p. 780. Fox's Acts and Monuments, vol. ii. p. 58.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT Henry's tyrannical disposition, soured by ill health,
burst out soon after to the destruction of a man, who pos∣sessed
a much superior rank to Gardiner. The duke
of Norfolk and his father, during this whole reign, and
even a great part of the foregoing, had been regarded as
the greatest subjects in the kingdom, and had rendered
very considerable services to the crown. The duke him∣self
had in his youth distinguished himself by naval enter∣prizes:
He had much contributed to the victory over the
Scots at Flouden: He had suppressed a dangerous rebel∣lion
in the North: And he had always done his part with
honour in all the expeditions, against France. Fortune
seemed to conspire with his own industry, in raising him
to the highest elevation. By the favours heaped on him
from the crown, he had acquired an immense estate:
The king had successively been married to two of his
nieces; and the King's son, the duke of Richmond, had
married his daughter: Besides his descent from the antient
family of the Moubrays, by which he was allied to the
throne, he had espoused a daughter of the duke of
Buckingham, who was descended by a female from Ed∣ward
the third: And as he was believed still to adhere
<PB N="283" REF="307"/>
secretly to the antient religion, he was regarded, abroad
and at home, as the head of the catholic party. But all
these circumstances, in proportion as they exalted the
duke, provoked the jealousy of Henry; and he foresaw
danger, during his son's minority, both to the public
tranquillity, and to the new ecclesiastical system, from
the attempts of so potent a subject. But nothing tended
more to expose Norfolk to the King's vengeance, than
the prejudices, which Henry had entertained against the
earl of Surrey, son to that nobleman.</P>
<P>SURREY was a young man of the most promising
hopes, and had distinguished himself by every accom∣plishment,
which became a scholar, a courtier, and a
soldier. He excelled in all the military exercises, which
were then in request: He encouraged the fine arts by his
patronage and example: He had made some successful
attempts in poetry; and being smit with the romantic
gallantry of that age, he celebrated the praises of his
mistress by his pen and his lance, in every masque and
tournament. His spirit and ambition were equal to his
talents and his quality; and he did not always regulate
his conduct by that caution and reserve, which his situa∣tion
required. He had been left governor of Boulogne,
when that town was taken by Henry; but though his
personal bravery was unquestioned, he had been unfortu∣nate
in some rencounters with the French, The King,
some what displeased with his conduct, had sent over
Hertford to command in his place; and Surrey was so
imprudent as to drop some menacing expressions against
the ministers, on account of this affront, which was put
upon him. And as he had refused to marry Hertford's
daughter, and even waved every proposal of marriage,
which was made him; Henry imagined, that he had
entertained views of espousing the lady Mary; and he
<PB N="284" REF="308"/>
was instantly determined to repress, by the most severe
expedients, so dangerous an ambition.</P>
<P>ACTUATED by all these motives, and perhaps too in∣fluenced
by that old disgust, with which the ill conduct
of Catherine Howard had inspired him against all her
family, he gave private orders to arrest Norfolk and
Surrey; and they were on the same day confined to the
Tower.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of December.</NOTE> Surrey being a commoner, his trial was the
more expeditious; and as to proofs, neither parliaments
nor juries seem ever to have given the least attention to
them in any cause of the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1547.</NOTE> during this whole reign.
He was accused,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the earl of Surrey.</NOTE> that he had entertained in his family
some Italians Who were <HI>suspected</HI> to be spies; a servant
of his had paid a visit to cardinal Pole in Italy, whence
he was <HI>suspected</HI> of entertaining a correspondence with
that obnoxious prelate; he had quartered the arms of
Edward the Confessor on his scutcheon, which, made
him be <HI>suspected</HI> of aspiring to the crown, tho' both he
and his ancestors had openly, during the course of many
years, maintained that practice; and the heralds had
even justified it by their authority. These were the
crimes, for which a jury, notwithstanding his eloquent
and spirited defence, condemned this nobleman for high
treason; and their sentence was soon after executed upon
him.</P>
<P>THE innocence of the duke of Norfolk was still,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attainder of the duke of Norfolk.</NOTE>, if
possible, more apparent than that of his son; as his ser∣vices
to the crown had been much greater. His dutchess,
with whom he lived on bad terms, had been so base as
to carry intelligence to his enemies of all she knew against
him: Elizabeth Holland, a mistress of his, had been
equally subservient to the des;igns of the court: Yet with
all these advantages his accusers discovered no greater
crime, than that he had once said, that the King was
<PB N="285" REF="309"/>
sickly, and could not hold out long, and the kingdom
was likely to fall into disorders, thro' the diversity of re∣ligious
opinions. He wrote a most pathetic letter to the
King, pleading his past services, and protesting his in∣nocence:
Soon after he embraced a more proper expe∣dient
for appealing Henry, by making a submission and
confession, such as his enemies required: But nothing
could mollify the unrelenting temper of the King. He
assembled the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 January.</NOTE> as the surest and most expe∣ditious
instrument of his tyranny; and the house of
peers, without examining the prisoner, without trial or
evidence, passed a bill of attainder against him, and sent
it down to the commons. Cranmer, tho' engaged for
many years in an opposite party to Norfolk, and tho' he
had received many and great injuries from him, would
have no hand in so unjust a prosecution, and he retired
to his seat at Croydon<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. 348. Fox.</NOTE>. The King was now appoach∣ing
fast towards his end; and fearing lest Norfolk should
escape him, he sent a message to the commons, by which
he desired them to hasten the bill, on pretence, that
Norfolk, enjoyed the dignity of earl marshal, and it was
necessary to appoint another, who might officiate at the
ensuing ceremony of installing his son prince of Wales.
The obsequious commons obeyed his directions, though
founded on so frivolous a pretence; and the King, hav∣ing
affixed the royal assent to the bill by commissioners,
issued orders for the execution of Norfolk on the morning
of the twenty-ninth of January. But news being carried
to the Tower, that the King himself had expired that
night, the lieutenant deferred the execution of the war∣rant,
and it was not thought advisable by the council,
to begin a new reign by the death of the greatest noble∣man
in the kingdom, who had been condemned by a sen∣tence
so unjust and tyrannical.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="310"/>
THE King's health had been long in a very declining
condition; but for several days all those near him plainly
saw his end approaching. He was become so forward
that no one durst inform him of his condition; and as
some persons, during this reign, had undergone the pu∣nishment
of traitors for foretelling the King's death<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Lanquet's Epitome of chronicles in the year 1541.</NOTE>,
every one was afraid, lest, in the transports of his fury,
he might, on this pretence, inflict death on the author
of such friendly intelligence. At last, Sir Anthony Denny
ventured to disclose to him the fatal secret, and exhorted
him to prepare for the fate which was awaiting him.
He expressed his resignation; and desired that Cranmer
might be sent for: But before that prelate arrived, he
was speechless, tho' he still seemed to retain his senses.
Cranmer desired him to give some sign of his dying in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the King.</NOTE>
the faith of Christ: He squeezed his hand, and immedi∣ately
expired, after a reign of thirty-seven years and nine
months; and in the fifty-sixth year of his age.</P>
<P>THE King had made his will near a month before his de∣cease;
where he confirmed the destination of Parliament
in leaving the crown first to prince Edward, then to the
lady Mary, next to the lady Elizabeth: The two prin∣cesses
he obliged, under the penalty of forfeiting their
title to the crown, not to marry without the consent of
the council, which he appointed for the government of
his minor son. After his own children, he settled the
succession on Frances Brandon, marchioness of Dorset
eldest daughter to his sister, the French Queen; then or
Eleonor, countess of Cumberland, the second daughter
in passing over the posterity of the Queen of Scots, his
eldest sister, he made use of the power obtained from
Parliament; but as he subjoined, that after the failure
of the French Queen's posterity, the crown should de∣scend
<PB N="287" REF="311"/>
to the next lawful heir, it afterwards became a
question, whether these words could be applied to the
Scottish line. It was thought, that these princes were
not the next heirs after the house of Suffolk, but before
that house, and that Henry, by expressing himself in this
manner, meant entirely to exclude them. The late in∣juries
which he had received from the Scots, had irritated
him extremely against that nation; and he maintained to
the last that character of violence and caprice, by which
his life had been so much distinguished. Another cir∣cumstance
of his will may suggest the same reflection with
regard to the strange contrarieties of his temper and con∣duct;
He left money for masses to be said for delivering
his foul from purgatory; and tho' he destroyed all those
institutions, established by his ancestors and others, for
the benefit of <HI>their</HI> souls, and had even left the doctrine
of purgatory doubtful in all the articles of faith which he
published during his latter years, he was yet determined,
when matters came to the last, to take care, at least,
of his own future repose, and to adhere to the safer side
of the question<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See his will in Fuller, Heylin, and Rymer, p. 110. There is no to reasonable ground to suspect its authenticity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to give a just summary of this prince's
qualities:<NOTE PLACE="marg">His character.</NOTE> He was so different from himself in different
parts of his reign, that, as is well remarked by lord
Herbert, his history is his best character and description.
The absolute, uncontrouled authority which he main∣tained
at home, and the regard which he acquired among
foreign nations, are circumstances which entitle him to
the appellation of a <HI>great</HI> prince; while his tyranny, and
cruelty, seem to exclude him from the character of a <HI>good</HI>
one. He possessed, indeed, great vigour of mind, which
qualified him for exercising dominion over men; courage,
<PB N="288" REF="312"/>
intrepidity, vigilance, inflexibility: And tho' these qua∣lities
lay not always under the guidance of a regular and
solid judgment, they were accompanied with good parts,
and an extensive capacity; and every one dreaded a con∣test
with a man who was known never to yield, or to
forgive; and who, in every controversy, was determined,
either to ruin himself or his antagonist. A catalogue of
his vices would comprehend many of the worst qualities
incident to human nature: Violence, cruelty, profusion,
rapacity, injustice, obstinacy, arrogance, bigotry, pre∣sumption,
caprice: But neither was he subject to all these
vices in the most extreme degree, nor was he, at inter∣vals,
altogether devoid of virtues: He was sincere, open,
gallant, liberal, and capable at least of a temporary friend∣ship
and attachment. In this respect he was unfortunate,
that the incidents of his times served to display his faults
in their full light: The treatment which he met with
from the court of Rome, provoked him to violence; the
danger of a revolt from his superstitious subjects, seemed
to require the most extreme severity. But it must, at the
same time, be acknowledged, that his situation tended to
throw an additional lustre on what was great and mag∣nanimous
in his character; The emulation between the
emperor and the French King, rendered his alliance,
notwithstanding his impolitic conduct, of great importance
in Europe: The extensive powers of his prerogative, and
the submissive, not to say slavish, dispostion of his Par∣liament,
made it the more easy for him to assume and
maintain that entire dominion by which his reign is so
much distinguished in the English history.</P>
<P>IT may seem a little extraordinary, that notwithstand∣ing
cruelty, his extortion, his violence, his arbitrary
administration, this prince not only acquired the regard
of his subjects; but never was the object of their hatred:
<PB N="289" REF="313"/>
He seems even in some degree to have possessed, to the
last, their love and affection<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 389.</NOTE>. His exterior qualities
were advantageous, and fit to captivate the multitude:
His magnificence and personal bravery rendered him il∣lustrious
in vulgar eyes: And it may be said, with truth,
that the English in that age, were so thoroughly subdued,
that, like eastern slaves, they were inclined to admire
even those acts of violence and tyranny, which were
exercised over themselves, and at their own expence.</P>
<P>WITH regard to foreign states, Henry appears long to
have supported an intercourse of friendship with Francis,
more sincere and disinterested than usually takes place
between neighbouring princes. Their common jealousy
of the emperor Charles, and some resemblance in their
characters, (tho' the comparison is extremely to the ad∣vantage
of the French monarch) served as the cement of
their mutual amity. Francis is said to have been affected
with the King's death, and to have expressed much regret
for the loss. His own health began to decline: He fore∣told,
that he should not long survive his friend<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Le Thou.</NOTE>: And
he died in about two months after him.</P>
<P>THERE were ten Parliaments summoned by Henry
the eighth, and twenty-three sessions held. The whole
time in which these Parliaments sat during this long reign,
exceeded not three years and a half. It amounted not to
a year during the first twenty years. The innovations in
religion obliged, him afterwards to call these assemblies
more frequently: But though these were the most im∣portant
transactions that ever fell under the cognizance
of Parliament, their devoted attachment to Henry's will,
joined to their earnest desire of returning soon to their
country seats, produced a very quick dispatch of the bills,
and made the sessions of short duration. All the King's
<PB N="290" REF="314"/>
caprices were, indeed, blindly complied with, and no
regard was payed to the safety or liberty of the subject.
Besides the violent prosecution of whatever he was
pleased to call heresy, the laws of treason were multi∣plied
beyond all former precedent. Even words to the
disparagement of the King, Queen, or royal issue, were
subjected to that penalty; and so little care was taken in
framing these rigorous statutes, that they contain obvi∣ous
contradictions; insomuch, that, had they been strict∣ly
executed, every man, without exception, must have
fallen under the penalty of treason. By one statute<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">28 Hen. VIII. c. 7.</NOTE>,
for instance, it was declared treason to assert the validity
of the King's marriage, either with Catherine of Arra∣gon,
or Anne Boleyn: By another<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">34, 35 Hen. VIII. c. i.</NOTE>, it was treason to
say any thing to the disparagement or slander of the prin∣cesses,
Mary and Elizabeth; and to call them spurious
would, no doubt, be construed to their slander. Nor
would even a profound silence with regard to these deli∣cate
points, be able to save a person from such penalties.
For by the former statute, whoever refused to answer
upon oath to any point contained in that act, was subject∣ed
to the pains of treason. The King, therefore, needed
only to propose to any one a question with regard to the
legality of either of his first marriages: If the person
was silent, he was a traytor by law: If he answered,
either in the negative or in the affirmative, he was no
less a traytor. So monstrous were the inconsistencies,
which arose from the furious passions of the King, and
the slavish obedience of his Parliaments. It is hard to
say, whether these contradictions were owing to Henry's
precipitancy, or to a formed design of tyranny.</P>
<P>IT may not be improper to recapitulate whatever is<NOTE PLACE="marg">His laws.</NOTE>
memorable in the statutes of this reign, whether with re∣gard
to police or commerce: Nothing can better show
<PB N="291" REF="315"/>
the genius of the age than such a review of the laws.
The abolition of the ancient religion contributed much
to the regular execution of justice. While the catholic
superstition subsisted, there was no possibility of punishing
any crimes in the clergy: The church would not allow
the magistrate to try the offences of her members, and
she could not herself inflict any civil penalties upon
them. But Henry restrained these pernicious exemp∣tions:
The privilege of clergy was abolished for the
crimes of petty treason, murder, and selony, to all under
the degree of a subdeacon<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">23 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. But the former superstition
not only protected crimes in the clergy: It exempted al∣so
the laity from punishment, by affording thenn shelter
in the churches and sanctuaries. The Parliament re∣strained
these abuses. It was first declared, that no
sanctuaries were allowed in cases of high treason<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">26 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>; next,
in those of murder, selony, rapes, burglary, and petty
treason<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">32 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</NOTE>: And it limited them in other particulars<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 14.</NOTE>.
The only expedient employed to support the military
spirit during this age, was the reviving and extending
some old laws, enacted for the encouragement of arch∣ery,
on which the defence of the kingdom was supposed
very much to depend. Every man was ordered to have
a bow<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">3. Hen. VIII. C. 3.</NOTE>; Buts were ordered to be erected in every pa∣rish<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>:
And every bowyer was ordered, for each bow of
yew which he made, to make two of elm or wich, for
the service of the common people<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The use of cross∣bows
and hand-guns was also prohibited<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. C. 13.</NOTE>. What ren∣dered
the English bowmen more formidable was, that
they carried halberts with them, by which they were en∣abled,
upon occasion, to engage in close fight with the
<PB N="292" REF="316"/>
enemy<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Frequent musters or arrays were also made of
the people, even during time of peace; and all men of
substance were obliged to have a compleat suit of armour
or harness, as it was called<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 234. Stowe, p. 515. Hollingshrf, p. 947.</NOTE>. The martial spirit of
the English, during that age, rendered this precaution,
it was thought, sufficient for the defence of the nation;
and as the King had then an absolute power of com∣manding
the service of all his subjects, he could present∣ly,
in case of danger, appoint new officers, and levy re∣giments,
and collect an army as numerous as he pleased.
When no faction or division prevailed among the people,
there was no foreign power that ever dared to think of
invading England. There is a saying of Francis the
first, which shews the estimation in which the nation
was held in Europe. That magnanimous prince boasted,
that, notwithstanding the combination of Charles and
Henry against him, in the year 1524, he should be able
to defend himself. Spain, says he, has no money; the
Low Countries have no soldiers: And as to England, my
frontier is strong on that side<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">P. Daniel.</NOTE>. The city of London
alone could muster fifteen thousand men<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 235. Hollingshed, p. 547. Stowe, p. 577.</NOTE>. Discipline,
however, was an advantage wanting to these troops; tho'
the garrison of Calais was a nursery of officers; and
Tournay first<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 68.</NOTE>, Boulogne afterwards, served to encrease
the number. Every one, who served abroad, was al∣lowed
to alienate his lands without paying any fees<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">14 and 15 Hen, VIII. c. 15.</NOTE>. A
general permission was granted to dispose of land by will<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">34 and 35 Hen. VIII. C. 5.</NOTE>.
The Parliament were so little jealous of their privileges,
(which indeed were, at that time, scarce worth pre∣serving)
that there is an instance of one Strode, who,
because he introduced into the lower house some bill re∣garding
<PB N="293" REF="317"/>
tin, was very severely treated by the Stannery
courts of Cornwal: Heavy fines were imposed on him; and
upon his refusal to pay, he was thrown into a dungeon,
loaded with irons, and used in such a manner as brought
his life in danger: Yet all the notice which the Parlia∣ment
took of this enormity, even in such an inferior
court, was to enact, that no man could be questioned af∣terwards
for his conduct in Parliament<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">4 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>. This prohibi∣tion,
however, must only be extended to the inferior
courts: For as to the King and privy council, and star∣chamber,
they were scarce bound by any law. There is
a bill of tonnage and poundage, which shews what un∣certain
ideas the Parliament had formed both of their
own privileges and of the rights of the sovereign<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">6 Hen. VIII. c. 14.</NOTE>. This
duty had been voted to every King since Henry the
fourth, during the term of his own life: Yet Henry
the eighth had already been allowed to levy it six years
without any law; and though there had been four Par∣liaments
assembled, no attention had been given either to
grant it to him regularly, or retrain him from levying it.
At last, the Parliament resolved to give him that supply;
but even in this concession, they show themselves plainly
at a loss to determine whether they grant it, or whether
he has a right of himself to levy it. They say, that the
imposition was made to endure during the natural life of
the late King, and no longer: They yet blame the mer∣chants
who had not paid to the present King that duty:
They observe, that the law for tonnage and poundage
was expired; yet make no scruple to call that imposition
the King's due: They affirm, that he had sustained great
and manifold losses by those who had defrauded him
of this duty: And to provide a remedy, they vote him
that supply during his life, and no longer. It is re∣markable,
<PB N="294" REF="318"/>
that notwithstanding this last clause, all his
successors, for more than a century, continued in the
like irregular practice: If a practice may deserve that
epithet, which all the world acquiesced in, and which
gave no offence. But when Charles the first attempted
to continue in the same course, which had now received
the sanction of many generations, so much were the opi∣nions
of men altered, that a furious tempest was excited
by it, and historians, partial or ignorant, still represent
that measure as a most violent and unprecedented enor∣mity
in that unhappy prince.</P>
<P>THE King was allowed to make laws for Wales,
without consent of Parliament<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">34 Hen. VIII.</NOTE>. With regard to Eng∣land,
the restraint was little more than a formality.</P>
<P>THE foreign commerce of England, during this age,
was mostly confined to the Netherlands. The inhabi∣tants
of the Low Countries bought the English commo∣dities,
and distributed them into the other parts of Eu∣rope.
Hence the mutual dependance of these countries
on each other; and the great loss sustained by both, in
case of a rupture. During all the variations of politics,
the sovereigns usually avoided the coming to this extre∣mity;
and though the King bore a much greater friend∣ship
to Francis, the propensity of the nation always lay
towards the emperor.</P>
<P>IN 1528, hostilities commenced between England and
the Low Countries; but were soon stopt by mutual
agreement. While the Flemings were not allowed to
purchase cloth in England, the English merchants could
not buy it of the clothiers, and the clothiers were obliged
to dismiss their workmen, who began to be tumultuous
for want of bread. The cardinal, to appease them, sent
for the merchants, and ordered them to buy cloth as
<PB N="295" REF="319"/>
usual: They told him, that they could not dispose of it
as usual; and notwithstanding all his menaces, he could
get no other answer from them<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x Hall, folio 174.</NOTE>. An agreement was
at last made to continue the commerce between the states,
even during war.</P>
<P>THE foreign artificers, in general, much surpassed the
English in dexterity, industry, and frugality; and hence
the violent animosity, which the latter, on many occa∣sions,
expressed against any of the former who were set∣tled
in England. They had the assurance to complain,
that all their customers went to foreign tradesmen; and
in the year 1517, being moved by the seditious sermons
of one doctor Bele, and the intrigues of Lincoln, a
broker, they raised an insurrection. The apprentices,
and others of the poorer sort, in London, began by
breaking up the prisons, where some persons were con∣fined
for insulting foreigners. They next proceeded to
the house of Meutas, a Frenchman, much, hated by
them; where they committed great disorders; killed some
of his servants, and plundered his goods. The mayor
could not appease them; nor Sir Thomas More, late
under sheriff, though extremely respected in the city.
They also threatened cardinal Wolsey with some insult;
and he thought it necessary to fortify his house, and put
himself on his guard. Tired at last with these disorders,
they dispersed themselves; and the earls of Shrewsbury
and Surrey seized some of them. A proclamation was is∣sued,
that women should not meet together to babble
and talk, and that all men should keep their wives in
their houses. Next day the duke of Norfolk came into
the city, at the head of thirteen hundred armed men,
and made enquiry into the tumult. Bele and Lincoln,
and several others, were sent to the Tower, and con∣demned
<PB N="296" REF="320"/>
for treason. Lincoln and thirteen more were
executed. The other criminals, to the number of four
hundred, were brought before the King, with ropes
about their necks, fell on their knees, and cried for mer∣cy.
Henry knew at that time how to pardon; he dis∣missed
them all without further punishment<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Stowe, 505. Hollingshed, 840.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So great was the number of foreign artizans in the
city, that at least fifteen thousand Flemings alone were
at one time obliged to leave it, by an order from the
council, when Henry became jealous of their favour for
Queen Catherine<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 232.</NOTE>. Henry himself confesses,
in an edict of the star-chamber, printed among the statutes, that the
foreigners starved the natives; and obliged them from
idleness to have recourse to theft, murder, and other
enormities<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">21 Hen. VIII.</NOTE>. He also asserts, that the vast multitudes of
the foreigners, raised the price of grain and bread<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. And
to prevent the increase of the evil, all foreign artificers
were prohibited to have above two foreigners in their
house, either journeymen or apprentices. A like jealousy
arose against the foreign merchants; and to comply
with it, a law was enacted obliging all denizens to pay
the duties imposed upon aliens<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>. The Parliament had
done better to have encouraged foreign merchants and ar∣tizans
to come over to England; which might have ex∣cited
the emulation of the natives, and have improved
their skill. The prisoners in the kingdom, for debts and
crimes, are asserted in an act of parliament, to be sixty
thousand persons and above<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. c. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is a remarkable clause in a statute passed near
the beginning of this, reign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>, by which we might be in∣duced
to believe, that England was extremely decayed
<PB N="297" REF="321"/>
from the flourishing condition which it had attained in
former times. It had been enacted in the reign of Ed∣ward
the second, that no magistrate in town or borough,
who by his office ought to keep assize, should, during
the continuance of his magistracy, sell either in whole∣sale
or retail, any wine or victuals. This law seemed
very equitable, in order to prevent fraud or private views
in fixing the assize: Yet the law is repealed in this reign.
The reason assigned is, that “since the making of that
statute and ordinance, many and the most part of all
the cities, boroughs, and towns corporate, within the
realm of England, are fallen in ruin and decay, and
are not inhabited by merchants, and men of such sub∣stance
as at the time of making that statute: For at
this day, the dwellers and inhabitants of the same
cities and boroughs are commonly bakers, vintners,
fishmongers, and other victuallers, and there remain
few others to bear the offices.” Men have such a
propensity to exalt past times above the present, that it
seems dangerous to credit this reasoning of the Parlia∣ment,
without further evidence to support it. So differ∣ent
are the views in which the same object appears, that
some may be inclined to draw an opposite inference from
this fact. A more regular police was established in the
reign of Henry the eighth than in any former period, and
a stricter administration of justice; an advantage which
induced the men of landed property to leave the provin∣cial
towns, and to retire into the country. Cardinal
Wolsey, in a speech to the Parliament, represented it as
a proof of the increase of riches, that the customs had
increased beyond what they were formerly<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hall,folio 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT if there was really a decay of commerce and in∣dustry,
and populousness in England, the statutes of this
<PB N="298" REF="322"/>
reign, except by abolishing monasteries, and retrenching
holidays, a circumstance of confiderable moment, were
not in otner respects well calculated to revive them. The
fixing the wages of artificers was attempted<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">6 Hen. VIII. c. 3.</NOTE>: Luxury in
apparel was prohibited, by repeated statutes<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">1 Hen. VIII. c. 14. 6 Hen. VIII. c. 1. 7 Hen. VIII. c. 7.</NOTE>; and pro∣bably
without success. The chancellor and other mini∣sters
were empowered to fix the price of poultry, cheese,
and butter<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">25 Hen. VIII. c. 2.</NOTE>. A statute was even passed to fix the price
of beef, pork, mutton, and veal<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">24 Hen. VIII. c. 3.</NOTE>. Beef and pork were
ordered to be sold at a halfpenny a pound: Mutton and
veal at a halfpenny half a farthing. The preamble of the
statute says, that these four species of butcher's meat
were the food of the poorer fort. This act was after∣wards
repealed<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">33 Men. VIII c. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE practice of depopulating the country, by aban∣doning
tillage, and throwing the lands into pasturage,
still continued<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 392.</NOTE>; as appears by the new laws which
were enacted against that practice. The King was
entitled to half the rents of the land, where any farm∣houses
were allowed to go to decay<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">6 Hen. VIII. c. 5. 7 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. The unskil∣ful
husbandry was probably the cause why the pro∣prietors
found no profit in tillage. The number of sheep
allowed to be kept in one flock, was restrained to two
thousand<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">25 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. Sometimes, says the statute, one proprietor
or farmer would keep a flock of twenty-four thousand.
It is remarkable, that the Parliament ascribes the in∣creasing
price of sheep and mutton, to this increase of
sheep; Because, say they, the commodity being got into
few hands, the price of it is raised at pleasure<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. It is
probable, that the effect proceeded from the daily increase
<PB N="299" REF="323"/>
of money: For it is impossible, that such a commodity
could be monopolized. Interest was fixed during this
reign at ten per cent<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">37 Hen. VIII. c. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME laws were madewith regard to beggars and va∣gabonds<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 12. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 5.</NOTE>;
one of the circumstances in government,
which humanity would most powerfully recommend to a
benevolent legislator; which seems, at first sight, the
most easily adjusted; and which is yet the most difficult
to settle in such a manner, as to attain the end without
destroying industry. The convents formerly were a sup∣port
to the poor; but at the same time tended to en∣courage
idleness and beggary.</P>
<P>HENRY, as he possessed himself some talents for let∣ters,
was an encourager of them in others. He founded
Trinity college in Cambridge, and gave it very ample
endowments. Wolsey founded Christ Church in Ox∣ford,
and intended to call it Cardinal college: But upon
his fall, which happened before he had entirely finished
his scheme, the King seized all the revenues; and this
violence, above all the other misfortunes of that great
minister, is said to have given him the greatest anxiety
and concern<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 117.</NOTE>. But Henry afterwards restored the reve∣nues
of the college, and only changed the name. The
cardinal founded in Oxford the first chair for teaching
Greek; and this novelty rent that university into the
most violent factions, which frequently came to blows.
The students divided themselves into parties, which bore
the names of Greeks and Trojans, and sometimes fought
with as great animosity as was formerly exercised by those
hostile nations. A new and more correct method of
pronouncing Greek, being introduced into the univer∣sities,
it divided also the Grecians themselves into par∣ties;
<PB N="300" REF="324"/>
and it was remarked, that the catholics favoured
the former pronunciation, the protestants gave counte∣nance
to the new. Gardiner employed the authority of
the King and council to suppress innovations in this par∣ticular,
and to preserve the old found to the Greek alpha∣bet.
The rise of the Greek language in Oxford, excited
the emulation of Cambridge<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Wood's Hist. &amp; Antiq. Oxon. lib. i. p. 245.</NOTE>. Wolsey intended to have
enriched the library of his college at Oxford, with co∣pies
of all the manuscripts that were in the Vatican<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid, 249.</NOTE>.
The countenance given to letters by this King and his
ministers, contributed to render learning fashionable in
England; and Erasmus speaks with great satisfaction of
the general regard paid by the nobility and gentry of that
kingdom to men of knowlege<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Epist. ad Banisium. Also epist. p. 368.</NOTE>. It is needless to be
particular in mentioning the writers of this reign, or of
the preceding. There is no man in that age, who had
the least pretension to be ranked among our classics. Sir
Thomas More, though he wrote in Latin, seems to come
the nearest to that character.</P>

<P>THE late King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXIV.</NOTE> by the regulations, which he
imposed on the government of his infant son, as
well as by the limitations of the succession, had
projected to reign even after his decease;<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the regency.</NOTE> and he ima∣gined,
that his ministers, who had always been so obse∣quious
to him during his life-time, would never after∣wards
depart from the plan, which he had traced
out to them. He fixed the majority of the Prince at
the completion of his eighteenth year; and as Edward
was at present only a few months past nine, he ap∣pointed
<PB N="302" REF="326"/>
sixteen executors; to whom, during the mi∣nority,
he entrusted the government of the King and
kingdom. Their names were, Cranmer, archbishop
of Canterbury; lord Wriothesely, chancellor; lord St.
John, great master; lord Russel, privy seal; the earl of
Hertford, chamberlain; viscount Lisle, admiral; Ton∣stal,
bishop of Durham; Sir Anthony Brown, master of
horse; Sir William Paget, secretary of state; Sir Ed∣ward
North, chancellor of the court of augmentations;
Sir Edward Montague, chief justice of the common
pleas; judge Bromley, Sir Anthony Denny, and Sir
William Herbert, chief gentlemen of the privy chamber;
Sir Edward Wotton, treasurer of Calais; Dr. Wotton,
dean of Canterbury. To these sixteen executors, with
whom was entrusted the whole regal authority, were
added twelve counsellors, who possessed no immediate
power, and could only assist with their advice, when any
affair was laid before them. The council was composed
of the earls of Arundel and Essex; Sir Thomas Cheyney,
treasurer of the household; Sir John Gage, comptroller;
Sir Anthony Wingfield, vice-chamberlain; Sir William
Petre, secretary of state; Sir Richard Rich, Sir
John Baker, Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir
Richard. Southwel, and Sir Edmund Peckham<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memor. Vol. ii. p. 457</NOTE>. The
usual caprice of Henry appears somewhat in this no∣mination;
while he appointed several persons of inferior
station among his executors, and gave only the place
of counsellor to a person of such high rank as the earl
of Arundel, and to Sir Thomas Seymour, the King's
uncle.</P>
<P>BUT the first act of the executors and counsellors was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Innovations in the regency.</NOTE>
to depart from the destination of the late King in a ma∣terial
article. No sooner were they met, than it was
<PB N="303" REF="327"/>
suggested, that the government would lose its dignity,
for want of some head, who might represent the royal
majesty, who might receive addresses from foreign am∣bassadors,
to whom dispatches from English ministers
abroad might be carried, and whole name might be em∣ployed
in all orders and proclamations: And as the
King's will seemed to labour under a defect in this parti∣cular,
it was concluded necessary to supply it, by choos∣ing
a protector; who, though he should possess all the
exterior symbols of royal dignity, should yet be bound,
in every exercise of power, to follow the opinion of the
executors<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burner, vol. ii. P. 5.</NOTE>. This proposal was very disagreeable to
chancellor Wriothesely. That magistrate, a man of an
active spirit and high ambition, found himself, by his of∣fice,
entitled to the first: rank in the regency after the
primate; and as he knew, that that prelate had no talent
nor inclination for state affairs, he hoped, that the di∣rection
of public business would of course devolve in a
great measure upon himself. He opposed, therefore, this
proposal of choosing a protector; and represented that in∣novation
as an infringement of the King's will, which,
being corroborated by act of Parliament, ought in every
thing to be a law to them, and could not be altered but
by the same authority, which had established it. The
executors and counsellors were mostly courtiers, who had
been raised by Henry's favour, not men of high birth or
great dependances; and as they had been sufficiently ac∣customed
to submission during the reign of the late mo∣narch,
and had no pretensions to govern the nation by
their own authority, they acquiesced the more willingly
in a proposal, which seemed calculated for preserving
public peace and tranquillity. It being therefore agreed
to name a protector, the choice fell of course on the earl
<PB N="304" REF="328"/>
of Hertford, who, as he was the King's maternal uncle,
was strongly interested in his safety; and having no
claims to inherit the crown, could never have any sepa∣rate
to interest; which might engage him to endanger Ed∣ward's
person or his authority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heylin, Hist. Ref. Edw. VI.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somerset protector.</NOTE> The public were in∣formed
by proclamation of this change in the administra∣tion;
and dispatches were sent to all foreign courts to
give them intimation of it. All those possessed of any
office res;igned their former commissions, and took out
new ones in the name of the young King. The bishops
themselves were constrained to make a like submission.
Care was taken to insert in their new commissions, that
they held their office during pleasure<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 218. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 6. Strype's Mem. of Cranm. p. 141.</NOTE>: And it is there
expressly affirmed, that all manner of authority and ju∣risdiction,
as well ecclesiastical as civil, is originally de∣rived
from the crown<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Strype's Mem. of Cranm. p. 141.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE executors showed, in their next measure, a more
submissive deference to Henry's will; because many of
them found their own account in it. The late King had
intended, before his death, to make a new creation of
nobility, in order to supply the place of those who had
fallen by former attainders, or the failure of issue; and
that he might enable the persons to support their new
dignity, he had resolved either to bestow estates on them,
or advance them to higher offices. He had even gone so
far as to inform them of this resolutlon; and in his will,
he charged his executors to make good all his promises<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fuller, Heylin, and Rymer.</NOTE>.
That they might ascertain his intentions in the most au∣thentic
manner, Sir William Paget, Sir Anthony Denny,
and Sir William Herbert, with whom Henry had always
conversed in a familiar manner, were called before the
<PB N="305" REF="329"/>
board of regency; and having given evidence of what
they knew concerning the King's promises, their testi∣mony
was relied on, and the executors proceeded to the
fulfilling these engagements. Hartford was created duke
of Somerset,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of February.</NOTE> marschal and lord treasurer; Wriothesely,
earl of Southampton; the earl of Essex, marquess of
Northampton; viscount Lisle, earl of Warwick; Sir
Thomas Seymour, lord Seymour of Sudley, and admiral:
Sir Richard Rich, Sir William Willoughby, Sir Edward
Sheffield, accepted the title of baron<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Stowe's Annals, p. 594.</NOTE>. Several, to
whom the same dignity was offered, refused it; because
the other part of the King's promise, the bestowing
estates on these new noblemen, was deferred till a more
convenient opportunity. Some of them, however, par∣ticularly
Somerset the protector, were, in the mean time,
endowed with spiritual preferments, deaneries and pre∣bends.
For among many other invasions of ecclesiasti∣cal
privileges and properties, this irregular practice, of
bestowing spiritual benefices on laymen, began now to
prevail.</P>
<P>THE earl of Southampton had always been engaged in
an opposite party to Somerset; and it was not likely that
factions, which had secretly prevailed, even during the
arbitrary reign of Henry, should be suppressed in the
weak administration, which usually attends a minority.
The former nobleman, that he might have the greater
leisure for attending to state-affairs, had, of himself and
from his own authority, put the great seal in commission,
and had empowered four lawyers, Southwel, Tregonel,
Oliver, and Bellasis, to execute in his absence the office
of chancellor. This measure seems very exceptionable;
and the more so, as two of the commissioners being ca∣nonists,
<PB N="306" REF="330"/>
the lawyers suspected, that, by this nomination,
the chancellor had intended to discredit the common law,
Complaints were made to the council; who, influenced
by the protector, gladly laid hold of this opportunity to
depress Southampton. They consulted the judges with
regard, to so unusual a case, and received for answer, that
the commission was illegal, and that the chancellor, by
his presumption in granting it, had justly forfeited the
seals, and was even liable to punishment. The council
summoned him to appear before them; and though he
maintained, that he held his office by the late King's
will, founded on an act of Parliament, and could not lose
it without a trial before the Parliament; that if the com∣mission,
which he had granted, was found illegal, it
might be declared null and void, and all the ill conse∣quences
of it be easily remedied; and that the depriving
him of the seals for an error of this nature, was a prece∣dent
by which any other innovation might be authorized;
the council, notwithstanding all these topics of defence,
declared that he had forfeited his office; that a fine
should be imposed upon him; and that he should be con∣fined
to his own house during pleasure<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 979.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOUGH the removal of Southampton encreased the
protector's authority, as well as tended to suppress fac∣tions
in the regency; yet was not Somerset contented
with this advantage: His ambition carried him to seek
still farther acquisitions. On pretence, that the vote of
the executors, choosing him protector, was not a suffi∣cient
foundation for his authority, he procured a patent
from the young King, by which he entirely overturned
the will of Harry the eighth, produced a total revolution
in the government, and may seem even to have subverted
<PB N="307" REF="331"/>
all the laws of the kingdom. He named himself pro∣tector
with full regal power, and appointed a council,
consisting of all the former counsellors, and all the exe∣cutors
except Southampton: He reserved a power of
naming any other counsellors at pleasure: And he was
bound to consult with such only as he thought proper.
The protector and his council were likewise empowered
to act at discretion, and to execute whatever they
thought serviceable to the government, without incurring
any penalty or forfeiture from any law, statute, procla∣mation,
or ordinance whatsoever<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. Records, N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 6.</NOTE>. Even had this pa∣tent
been less exorbitant in its concessions, and had it
been drawn by directions from the executors appointed
by Henry, its legality might justly be questioned; since
it seems essential to a trust of this nature to be exercised
by the persons entrusted, and not to admit of a delega∣tion
to others: But as the patent, by its very tenor,
where the executors are not so much as mentioned, ap∣pears
to have been surreptitiously obtained from a minor
King, the protectorship of Somerset was a plain usurpa∣tion,
which it is impossible by any arguments to justify.
The connivance, however, of the executors, and their
present acquiescence in the new establishment, made it be
universally submitted to; and as the young King disco∣vered
an extreme attachment to his uncle, who was also
in the main a man of moderation and probity, no ob∣jections
were made to his power and title. All men of
sense, likewise, who saw the nation divided by the reli∣gious
zeal of the opposite sects, thought it the more ne∣cessary
to entrust the government to one person, who
might check the exorbitances of party, and ensure the
public tranquillity. And though some clauses of the pa∣tent
seemed to imply a formal subversion of all liberty or
<PB N="308" REF="332"/>
limited government, so little jealousy was then usually
entertained on that head, that no exception was ever
taken at bare claims or pretensions of this nature,
advanced by any person, possessed of sovereign power.
The actual exercise alone of arbitrary administration, and
that in many and great and flagrant and unpopular in∣stances,
was able sometimes to give some umbrage to
the nation.</P>
<P>THE extensive authority and imperious character of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reformation completed.</NOTE>
Henry, had retained the partizans of both religions in
subjection; but upon his decease, the hopes of the pro∣testants
and the fears of the catholics began to revive,
and the zeal of these parties produced every where dis∣putes
and animosities, the usual preludes of more fatal
divisions. The protector had long been regarded as the
secret partizan of the reformers; and being now freed
from restraint, he scrupled not to express his intention
of correcting all the abuses of the ancient religion, and
of adopting still more of the protestant innovations. He
took, care, that all the persons, to whom he entrusted the
King's education, should be attached to the same prin∣ciples;
and as the young Prince discovered a zeal for
every kind of literature, especially the theological, far be∣yond
his tender years, all men foresaw, in the course of
his reign, the total abolition of the catholic faith; and
they early began to declare themselves in favour of those
tenets, which were likely to become in the end entirely
prevalent. After Southampton's fall, few members of
the council seemed to retain any attachment to the Ro∣mish
communion; and most of the counsellors appeared
even sanguine in forwarding the progress of the reforma∣tion.
The riches which most of them had acquired from
the spoils of the clergy, induced them to widen the
breach between England and Rome; and by establishing
a contrariety of speculative tenets, as well as of disci∣pline
<PB N="309" REF="333"/>
and worship, to render a coalition with the mother
church altogether impracticable<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals, Heylin.</NOTE>. Their rapacity also,
the chief source of their reforming spirit, was excited by
the prospect of pillaging the secular, as they had already
done the regular clergy; and they knew, that, while
any share of the old principles remained, or any regard
to the ecclesiastics, they never could hope to succeed in
their pretensions.</P>
<P>THE numerous and burthensome superstitions, with
which the Romish church was loaded, had thrown many
of the reformers, by the spirit of opposition, into an en∣thusiastic
strain of devotion; and all rites, ceremonies,
pomp, order, and exterior observances were zealously
abolished by them, as hindrances of their spiritual con∣templations,
and obstructions to their immediate converse
with heaven. Many circumstances concurred to enflame
this daring spirit; the novelty itself of their doctrines,
the triumph of making proselytes, the furious persecu∣tions
to which they were, exposed, their animosity against
the antient tenets and practices, and the necessity of pro∣curing
the concurrence of the laity, by depressing the
hierarchy, and by tendering to them the plunder of the
ecclesiastics. Wherever the reformation prevailed over
the opposition of civil authority, this genius of religion
appeared in its full extent, and was attended with con∣sequences,
which, though less durable, were, for some
time, no less dangerous than those which were connected
with the ancient superstition. But as the magistrate took
the lead in England, the transition was more gradual;
much of the antient religion was still preserved; and a
reasonable degree of subordination was retained in disci∣pline,
as well as some pomp, order, and ceremony in
public worship.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="334"/>
THE protector, in his schemes for advancing the re∣formation,
had always recourse to the councils of Cran∣mer,
who, being a man of moderation and prudence,
was averse to all violent changes, and determined to
bring over the people, by insensible innovations, to that
system of doctrine and discipline, which he deemed the
most pure and perfect. He probably also foresaw, that a
system, which carefully avoided the extremes of reforma∣tion,
was likely to be most lasting; and that a devotion,
merely spiritual, was fitted only for the first fervours of a
new sect, and upon the relaxation of these naturally gave
place to the inroads of superstition. He seems therefore
to have intended the establishment of a hierarchy, which,
being suited to a great and settled government, might
stand as a perpetual barrier against Rome, and might re∣tain
the reverence of the people, even after their enthusi∣astic
zeal was diminished or entirely evaporated.</P>
<P>THE person, who opposed, with greatest authority,
any farther advances towards reformation, was Gardiner,
bishop of Winchester; who, tho' he had not obtained
a place in the council of regency, on account of some,
late disgusts, which he had given to Henry, was entitled,
by his age, experience, and capacity, to the highest trust
and confidence of his party.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardiner's opposition.</NOTE> This prelate continued still
to magnify the great wisdom and learning of the late
King, which were generally and sincerely admired by the
nation; and he insisted on the prudence of persevering,
at least till the young King's majority, in the ecclesias∣tical
model, established by that great monarch. He de∣fended
the use of images, which were now very openly
attacked by the protestants; and he represented them as
serviceable in maintaining a sense of religion among the
illiterate multitude<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. P. 742.</NOTE>. He even deigned to write an apo∣logy
for <HI>holy water,</HI> which bishop Ridley had decried in a
<PB N="311" REF="335"/>
sermon; and he maintained, that, by the power of the
Almighty, it might be rendered an instrument of doing
good; as much as the shadow of St. Peter, the hem of
our Saviour's garment, or the spittle and clay laid upon
the eyes of the blind<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 724.</NOTE>. Above all, he insisted, that the
laws ought to be observed, that the constitution ought to
be preserved inviolate, and that it was dangerous to fol∣low
the will of the sovereign, in opposition to an act of
parliament<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 228. Fox, vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' there remained at that time in England an
idea of laws and a constitution, sufficient at least to fur∣nish
a topic of argument to, such as were discontented
with the present exercise of authority; this plea could
scarcely, in the present case, be maintained with any
plausibility by Gardiner. An act of parliament had in∣vested
the crown with a legislative power; and royal
proclamations, even during a minority, were armed with
the force and authority of laws. The protector, finding
himself supported by this statute, was determined to em∣ploy
his influence in favour of the reformers; and hav∣ing
suspended, during the interval, the authority of the
bishops, he appointed a general visitation to be made in
all the dioceses of England<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cranm. p. 146, 147, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The visitors consisted of a
mixture of clergy and laity, and had six circuits ass;igned
them. The chief purpose of their instructions was, be∣sides
correcting immoralities and irregularities in the cler∣gy,
to abolish the antient superstitions, and to bring the
discipline and worship somewhat nearer the practice of
the reformed churches. The moderation of Somerset and
Cranmer is apparent in the conduit of this delicate af∣fair.
The visitors were enjoined to retain for the pre∣sent
all images which had not been abused to idolatry;
<PB N="312" REF="336"/>
and to instruct the people not to despise such ceremonies
as were not yet abrogated, but only to beware, of some
particular superstitions, such as the sprinkling their beds
with holy water, the ringing of bells, or using of blessed
candles, in order to drive away the devil<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. P. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT nothing required more the correcting hand of au∣thority,
than the abuse of preaching, which was now
generally employed, throughout England, in defending
the antient practices and superstitions. The court of
augmentations, in order to ease the King of the annui∣ties
paid to monks, had commonly placed them in the
vacant churches; and these men were led by interest, as
well as inclination, to support those principles, which
had been invented for the profit of the clergy. Orders
therefore were given to restrain the topics of their ser∣mons:
Twelve homilies were published, which they
were enjoined to read to the people: And all of them
were prohibited, without express permission, to preach
any where but in their parish churches. The des;ign of
this injunction was to throw a restraint on the catholic
divines; while the protestant, by the grant of particular
licences, should be allowed unbounded liberty.</P>
<P>BONNER made some opposition to these measures; but
soon after retracted and acquiesced. Gardiner was more
high-spirited and more steady. He represented the peril
of perpetual innovations, and the necessity of adhering
to some system. “'Tis a dangerous thing,” said he,
“to use too much freedom, in researches of this kind.
If you cut the old canal, the water is apt to run fur∣ther
than you have a mind to. If you indulge the
humour of novelty, you cannot put a stop to people's
demands, nor govern their indiscretions at pleasure.
For my part,” said he, on another occasion, “my
<PB N="313" REF="337"/>
sole concern is to manage the third and last act of my
life with decency, and to make a handsome exit off the
stage. Provided this point is secured, I am not solicit∣ous
about the rest. I am already by nature condemned
to death; No man can give me a pardon from this sen∣tence;
nor so much as procure me a reprieve. To
speak my mind, and to act as my conscience directs,
are two branches of liberty, which I can never part
with. Sincerity in speech, and integrity in action, are
entertaining qualities: They will stick by a man,
when every thing else takes its leave; and I must not
resign them upon any consideration. The best on it is,
if I do not throw them away myself, no man can force
them from me: But if I give them up, then am
I ruined by myself, and deserve to lose all my prefer∣ments<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ier, vol. ii. p. 228. ex MS. Col. C. C. Cantab. Bibliothica Brittanica, article GARDINER.</NOTE>.”
This opposition of Gardiner drew on him
the indignation of the council; and he was sent to the
Fleet, where he was used with some harshness and
severity.</P>
<P>ONE of the chief objections, urged by Gardiner against
the new homilies, was that they defined with the most
metaphysical precision the doctrine of grace, and of jus∣tification
by faith; points, he thought, which it was
superfluous for any man to know exactly, and which
certainly much exceeded the comprehension of the vul∣gar.
A famous martyrologist calls Gardiner, on account
of this opinion, “An insensible ass, and one that had no
feeling of God's spirit in the matter of justification<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii.</NOTE>.”
The meanest protestant imagined at that time, that he
had a full comprehension of all those mysterious doctrines,
and he heartily despised the most learned and knowing
person of the antient religion, who acknowleged his
ignorance with regard to them. It is indeed certain,
<PB N="314" REF="338"/>
that the reformers were very fortunate in their doctrine
of justification, and might venture to expect its success
in opposition to all the ceremonies, shows, and supersti∣tions
of popery. By exalting Christ and his sufferings,
and renouncing all claim to independent merit in our∣selves,
it was calculated to become popular, and coincided
with those principles of panegyric and of self-abasement,
which generally have place in religion.</P>
<P>TONSTAI, bishop of Durham, having, as well as
Gardiner, made some opposition to the new regulations,
was dismissed the council-board; but no farther severity
was, for the present, exercised against him. He was a
man of perfect moderation, and of the most unexception∣able
character in the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE same religious zeal which engaged Somerset to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign affairs.</NOTE>
promote the reformation at home, led him to carry his
attention to foreign countries; where the interests of the
protestants were now exposed to the most imminent dan∣ger.
The Roman pontiff, with much reluctance and
after long delays, had at last summoned a general council,
which was assembled at Trent, and was employed in
correcting the abuses of the church, and in ascertaining
her doctrines. The emperor, who desired to repress the
power of the court of Rome, as well as gain over the
protestants, promoted the former object of the council;
the pope, who found his own greatness so deeply interested,
desired rather to employ them in the latter. He gave in∣structions
to his legates, who presided in the council, to
protract the debates, and to engage the theologians in al∣tercation,
and arguments, and disputes concerning the
nice points of faith, canvassed before them: A policy,
which was so easy to be executed, that the legates found
if rather necessary to interpose, in order to appease the
animosity of the divines, and bring them at last to some
decision<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 2.</NOTE>. The more difficult task for the legates
<PB N="315" REF="339"/>
was to moderate or divert the zeal of the council for
reformation, and to repress the ambition of the prelates,
who desired to exalt the episcopal authority on the ruins
of the sovereign pontiff. Finding this humour become
intractable, the legates, on pretence that the plague had
broke out at Trent, transferred of a sudden the council
to Bologna, where, they hoped, it would be more under
the direction of his holiness.</P>
<P>THE emperor, no less than the pope, had learned to
make religion subservient to his ambition and policy.
He was resolved to employ the imputation of heresy as a
pretence for subduing the protestant princes, and oppres∣sing
the liberties of Germany; but found it requisite to
cover his intentions under a deep artifice, and to prevent
the combination of his adversaries. He separated the
Palatine and the elector of Brandenburgh from the pro∣testant
confederacy: He took arms against the elector of
Saxony, and the landgrave of Hesse: By the fortune of
war he made the former prisoner: He employed treachery
and prevarication against the latter, and detained him
captive, by breaking a safe-conduct which he had granted
him. He seemed to have reached the summit of his am∣bition;
and the German princes, who were astonished
with his success, were farther discouraged by the intel∣ligence,
which they had received, of the death first of
Henry the eighth, then of Francis the first, their usual
resources in every calamity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sleidan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY the second, who succeeded to the crown
of France, was a prince of vigour and ability; but less
prompt in his resolutions than Francis, and less enflamed
with rivalship and animosity against the emperor, Charles.
Tho' he sent ambassadors to the princes of the Smal∣caldic
League, and promised them his protection, he was
unwilling, in the commencement of his reign, to hurry
<PB N="316" REF="340"/>
into a war against so great a power as that of the
emperor, and he thought that the alliance of these
princes was a sure resource, which he could at any time
lay hold of<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel.</NOTE>. He was much governed by the duke of
Guise and the cardinal of Lorraine, brothers to the Queen∣dowager
of Scotland, and he hearkened to their counsel,
in chusing rather to give immediate assistance to that an∣tient
ally, which, even before the death of Henry the
eighth, had loudly claimed the protection of the French
monarchy.</P>
<P>THE hatred between the two factions, the partizans
of the antient and those of the new religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress the reformation in Scotland.</NOTE> became every
day more violent in Scotland; and the resolution, which
the cardinal primate had taken to employ the most rigor∣ous
punishments against the reformers, brought matters
to a quick decision. There was one Wishart, a gentle∣man
by birth, who employed himself with great zeal in
preaching against the antient superstitions, and began to
give alarm to the clergy, who were justly terrified with
the danger of some fatal revolution in religion. This
man was much celebrated for the purity of his morals,
and for his extensive learning: But these praises cannot
be much depended on; because, we know, that, among
the reformers, severity of manners stood in place of many
virtues; and the age was in general so ignorant, that
most of the priests in Scotland imagined the New Testa∣ment
to be a composition of Luther's, and asserted that
the Old alone was the word of God<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 75. The same author, p. 92, tells us a story, which confirms this character of the popish clergy in Scotland. It became a great dispute in the university of St. Andrews, whether the <HI>pater</HI> should be said to God or the saints. The friars, who knew in general that the reformers neglected the saints, were determined to maintain their honour with great obstinacy, but they knew not upon what topics to found their doctrine. Some held that the <HI>pater</HI> was said to God <HI>formaliter,</HI> and to saints <HI>materialiter;</HI> others, to God <HI>principaliter,</HI> and to saints <HI>minus principaliter;</HI> others would have it <HI>ultimate</HI> and <HI>non ultimate:</HI> But the majority seemed to hold, that the <HI>pater</HI> was said to God <HI>capiende stricte,</HI> and to saints <HI>capiendo large.</HI> A simple fellow, who served the subprior, thinking there was some great matter in hand, that made the doctors hold so many conferences together, asked him one day what the matter was; the sub-prior answering, <HI>Tom,</HI> that was the fellow's name, <HI>we cannot agree to whom the pater-noster should be said.</HI> He suddenly replied, <HI>To whom, Sir, should it be said, but unto God?</HI> Then said the sub-prior, <HI>What shall we do with the saints?</HI> He answered, <HI>Give them Aves and Creeds enow in the devil's name; for that may suffice them.</HI> The answer going abroad, many said, <HI>that be bad given a wiser decision than all the doctors had done with all their distinctions.</HI></NOTE>. But however the
<PB N="317" REF="341"/>
case may have been with regard to those estimable qua∣lities
ascribed to Wishart, he was strongly possessed with
a desire of innovation; and he enjoyed those talents,
which qualified him for becoming a popular preacher,
and for seizing the attention and affections of the multi∣tude.
The magistrates of Dundee, where he exercised
his mission, were alarmed with his progress; and being
unable or unwilling to treat himwith rigour, they con∣tented
themselves with denying him the liberty of
preaching, and with dismissing him the bounds of their
jurisdiction. Wishart, moved with indignation, that they
had dared to reject the word of God, menaced them, in
imitation of the antient prophets, with some imminent
calamity; and he withdrew to the west country, where he
daily encreased the number of his proselytes. Meanwhile,
a plague broke out in Dundee; and all men exclaimed,
that the town had drawn down the vengeance of Heaven
by banishing the pious preacher, and that the pestilence
would never cease till they had made him attonement for
their offence against him. No sooner did Wishart hear
of this change in their disposition, than he returned to
them, and made them a new tender of his doctrine: But
lest he should spread the contagion by bringing multitudes
together, he erected his pulpit on the top of a gate:
<PB N="318" REF="342"/>
The infected stood within; the others without. And the
preacher failed not, in such a situation, to take advantage
of the immediate terrors of the people, and to enforce
his evangelical mission<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Knox's Hist. of Ref. p. 44. Spotswood.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE assiduity and success of Wishart became an ob∣ject
of attention to cardinal Beaton; and he resolved,
by the punishment of so celebrated a preacher, to strike a
terror into all other innovators. He engaged the earl of
Bothwel to arrest him in his retirement; and to deliver
him into his hands, contrary to a promise given by Both∣wel
to that unhappy man: And being possessed of his
prey, he conducted him to St. Andrew's, where, after a
trial, he condemned him to the flames for heresy. Arran,
the regent, was very irrcsolute in his temper; and the
cardinal, though he had gained him to his party, found,
that he would not concur in the condemnation and exe∣cution
of Wishart. He determined, therefore, without
the assistance of the secular arm, to bring that heretic to
punishment; and he himself beheld from his windows
the dismal spectacle. Wishart suffered with the usual
patience; but could not forbear remarking the triumph
of his insulting enemy. He foretold, that in a few days
he would in the very same place lie as low, as now he
was exalted alost, in opposition to true piety and reli∣gion<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, Buchanan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS prophecy was probably the immediate cause of
the event which it foretold. The disciples of this mar∣tyr,
enraged at the cruel execution, formed a conspiracy
against the cardinal; and having associated to them Nor∣man
Lesly, who was disgusted on account of some pri∣vate
quarrel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assassination of cardinal Beaton.</NOTE> they conducted their enterprize with great
secrecy and success. Early in the morning they entered
the cardinal's palace, which he had sftrongly fortified;
<PB N="319" REF="343"/>
and though they were not above sixteen persons, they
thrust out an hundred tradesmen and fifty servants, whom
they seized separately, before any suspicion arose of their
intentions; and having shut the gates, they proceeded
very deliberately to execute their purpose on the cardinal.
That prelate had been alarmed with the noise which
he heard in the castle; and had barricadoe'd the door
of his chamber: But finding that they had brought fire in
order to force their way, and having obtained, as is be∣lieved,
a promise of life, he opened the door; and re∣minding
them, that he was a priest, he conjured them to
spare him. Two of the assassins rushed upon him with
drawn swords; but a third, James Melvil, more calm
and more considerate in villany, stopped their career, and
bid them reflect, that this sacrisice was the work and
judgment of God, and ought to be executed with the
utmost deliberation and gravity. Then turning the point
of his sword towards Beaton, he called to him, “Re∣pent
thee, thou wicked cardinal, of all thy sins and
iniquities, but especially of the murder of Wishart,
that instrument of God for the conversion of these
lands: It is his death, which now cries vengeance up∣on
thee: We are sent by God to inflict the deserved
punishment. For here, before the Almighty, I pro∣test,
that it is neither hatred of thy person, nor love
of thy riches, nor fear of thy power, which moves me
to seek thy death: But only because thou hast been,
and still remainest, an obstinate enemy to Christ Jesus,
and his holy gospel.” Having spoke these words,
without giving him leisure to finish that repentance, to
which he exhorted him, he thrust him through the body;
and the cardinal fell dead at his feet<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The famous Scots reformer, John Knox, calls James Melvil, p. 65. a man most gentle and most modest. It is very horrid, but at the same time somewhat amusing, to consider the joy and alacrity and pleasure, which that historian discovers in his narration of this assassination: And it is remarkable that in the first edition of his work, these words were printed on the margin of the page, <HI>The godly Fact and Words of James Melvil.</HI> But the following editors retrenched them. Knox himself had no hand in the murder of Beaton; but he afterwards joined the assassins, and assisted them in holding out the castle. See Keith's Hist. of the Ref. of Scotland, p. 43.</NOTE>. This murther
<PB N="320" REF="344"/>
was executed on the 28th of May 1546. The assassins
being reinforced by their friends to the number of an
hundred and forty persons, prepared themselves for the
defence of the castle, and sent a messenger to London,
craving assistance from Henry. That prince, tho' Scot∣land
was comprehended in his peace with France, would
not reject this opportunity of disturbing the government
of that kingdom; and he agreed to take them under his
protection.</P>
<P>IT was the peculiar misfortune of Scotland, that five
short reigns had been successively followed by as many long
minorities; and the execution of justice, which the prince
was beginning to introduce, had been continually inter∣rupted
by the cabals, factions, and animosities of the
great. But besides these inveterate and antient evils, a
new source of disorder had arisen, the disputes and con∣tentions
of theology, which were sufficient to disturb the
most settled government; and the death of the cardinal,
who was possessed of ability and vigour, seemed much to
weaken the hands of the administration. But the Queen-dowager
was a woman of uncommon talents and virtues;
and she did as much to support the government, and sup∣ply
the weakness of Arran, the governor, as could be ex∣pected
in her situation. A stipulation was made with the
garrison of St. Andrews, that they should surrender the
castle upon receiving a pardon, together with an absolu∣tion
from the Pope; and that they should never after∣wards
be called in question for Beaton's assassination.
Meanwhile, till the pope's absolution should arrive, she
<PB N="321" REF="345"/>
applied to France for succours; and Henry sent her some
gallies, with a train of artillery, commanded by Strozzi,
prior of Capua. Before the siege of St. Andrews was
opened, the absolution was sent to the garrison, and they
were required to surrende; but because the pope, among
other exaggerations of the cardinal's murder, had said,
that he pardoned an unpardonable crime, the garrison,
fearing that this expression was employed in order to en∣snare
them, refused to open their gates<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 75. Spotswood, Buchanan.</NOTE>. They were,
however, soon obliged to depart from their obstinacy:
A great breach was made in the walls: The plague
broke out among them: And seeing no hopes of suc∣cour
from England, they surrendered to the French
upon conditions, which were not very scrupulously observ∣ed
to them.</P>
<P>THE protector of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the war with Scot∣land.</NOTE> so soon as the govern∣ment
was brought to some composure, made preparations
for the attack of Scotland; and he was determined to
execute, if possible, that project, of uniting the two
kingdoms by marriage, on which the late King had been
so intent, and which he had recommended with his dying
breath to his executors. He raised an army of 18,000
men, and equipped a fleet of sixty sail, one half of which
were ships of war, the other loaded with provisions and
ammunition. He gave the command of the fleet to lord
Clinton: He himself marched at the head of the army,
attended by the earl of Warwic. These hostile measures
were covered with a pretence of revenging some depre∣dations
committed by the borderers; but besides, that the
protector revived the antient claim of the superiority of the
English crown over that of Scotland, he refused to enter
into negotiation on any other conditions than the marriage
of the young queen with Edward.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="346"/>
THE protector published a manifesto, in which he in∣forced
all the arguments for that measure. He said,
that nature seemed originally to have intended this island
for one empire; and having cut it off from all communi∣cation
with foreign states, and guarded it by the ocean,
she had pointed out to the inhabitants the road to hap∣piness
and security: That the education and customs of
the people concurred with nature; and by giving them
the same language, and laws, and manners, had invited
them to a thorough union and coalition: That fortune
had at last removed all obstacles, and had prepared an
expedient, by which they might become one people,
without leaving any place for that jealousy either of ho∣nour
or of interest, to which rival nations are naturally so
much exposed: That the crown of Scotland had devolved
to a female; that of England to a male; and happily the
two sovereigns, as of a rank, were also of an age, the
most suitable to each other: That the hostile disposition,
which prevailed between the nations, and which arose from
past injuries, would soon be extinguished, after a long
and secure peace had established confidence between them:
That the memory of former miseries, which at present
inflamed their mutual animosity, would then serve only
to make them cherish, with more passion, a state of hap∣piness
and tranquillity, so long unknown to their ances∣tors:
That when hostilities had ceased between the king∣doms,
the Scots nobility, who were at present obliged
to remain perpetually in a warlike posture, would learn
to cultivate the arts of peace, and would soften their
minds to a love of domestic order and obedience: That
as this situation was desirable to both kingdoms, so par∣ticularly
to Scotland, which had been exposed to the greatest
miseries from intestine and foreign wars, and saw herself
every moment in danger of losing her independency, by
the efforts of a richer and more powerful people: That
<PB N="323" REF="347"/>
tho' England had claims of superiority, she was willing
to res;ign every pretension for the sake of future peace,
and desired an union, which would be the more secure,
as it would be concluded on terms entirely equal: And
that besides all these motives, positive engagements had
been taken for the compleating this alliance, and the
honour and good faith of the nation were pledged to fulfil
what her interest and safety so loudly demanded<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sir John Haywood in Kennet, p. 279. Heylin, p. 42.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOMERSET soon found, that these remonstrances would
have no influence; and that the Queen dowager's at∣tachments
to France and to the catholic religion would
render ineffectual all negotiations for the intended mar∣riage.
He found himself therefore obliged to try the force
of arms, and to constrain the Scots by necessity to submit
to a measure, for which they seemed to have entertained
the most incurable aversion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of Sept.</NOTE> He passed the borders at
Berwic, and advanced towards Edinburgh, without meet∣ing
any resistance for some days, except from some small
castles, which were constrained to surrender at discretion.
The protector intended to have punished the governor
and garrison of one of those castles for their temerity in
resisting such unequal force; But they eluded his anger by
asking only a few hours respite till they should prepare
themselves for death; after which they found his ears more
open to their applications for mercy<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Haywood. Patten.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE governor of Scotland had summoned together the
whole force of the kingdom; and his army, double the
number of the English, had taken post on very advanta∣geous
ground, guarded by the banks of the Eske, about
four miles from Edinburgh. The English came within
sight of them at Faside; and after a skirmish between
the horse, where the Scots were worsted, and lord Hume
<PB N="324" REF="348"/>
dangerously wounded, Somerset prepared himself for a
more decisive action. But having taken a view of the
Scots camp with the earl of Warwic, he found it difficult
to make any attempt upon it with a probability of suc∣cess.
He wrote therefore another letter to Arran; and
offered to retire out of the kingdom, as well as to repair
all damages which he had committed, provided that the
Scots would stipulate not to contract the Queen to any
foreign prince, but to keep her at home, till she reached
the age of choosing a husband for herself. Such mode∣rate
terms were rejected by the Scots merely on account
of their moderation; and they begat an opinion, that
the protector must either be reduced to great distress or
be influenced by fear, that he was now contented to
abate so much of his former pretensions. Actuated also
by their priests, who had come to the camp in great
numbers, they believed, that the English were detestable
heretics, abhorred of God, and exposed to divine ven∣geance;
and that no success could ever crown their arms.
They were confirmed in this fond conceit, when they
saw the protector change his ground, and move towards
the sea; nor did they any longer doubt that he intended
to embark his army, and make his escape on board the
ships, which at that very time moved into the bay, oppo∣site
to him<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 985.</NOTE>. Determined therefore to cut off his retreat,
they quitted their camp;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0th Sept.</NOTE> and passing the river Eske, ad∣vanced
into the plain. They were divided into three
bodies: Angus commanded the vanguard; Arran the
main body; Huntley the rear: Their cavalry consisted
only of light horse, which were placed on their left flank,
strengthened by some Irish archers, whom Argyle had
brought over for this service.</P>
<P>SOMERSET was pleased when he saw this movement
of the Scots army; and as the English had usually been
<PB N="325" REF="349"/>
superior in pitched battles, he conceived great hopes of
success. He arranged his van on his left, farthest from
the sea; and ordered them to remain on the high grounds
on which he placed them, till the enemy should approach:
He placed his main battle and his rear towards the right;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The battle of Pinkey.</NOTE>
and beyond the van he posted lord Grey at the head of
the men at arms, and ordered him to take the Scots van
in flank, but not till they should be engaged in close
fight with the van of the English.</P>
<P>WHILE the Scots were advancing on the plain, they
were galled with the artillery from the English ships:
The master of Graham was killed: The Irish archers
were thrown into disorder; and even the other troops
began to stagger: When the lord Grey, perceiving their
situation, neglected his orders, left his ground, and at
the head of his heavy-armed horse made an attack on the
Scots infantry, in hopes of gaining all the honour of the
victory. On advancing, he found a slough and ditch in
his way; and behind were ranged the Scots infantry arm∣ed
with spears, and the field, on which they stood, was
fallow ground, broken with ridges, which lay cross their
front, and disordered the movements of the English ca∣valry.
From all these accidents, the shock of this body
of horse was feeble and irregular; and as they were re∣ceived
on the points of the Scottish spears, which were
longer than the lances of the English horsemen, they
were in a moment pierced, overthrown, and discomfited.
Grey himself was dangerously wounded: Lord Edward
Seymour, son to the protector, lost his horse; The stan∣dard
was near being taken: And had the Scots possessed
any good body of cavalry, who could have pursued the
advantage, the whole English army had been exposed to
great danger<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Patten, Hollingshed, p. 986.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="350"/>
THE protector mean-while, assisted by Sir Ralph Sadler
and Sir Ralph Vane, employed himself with diligence
and success, in rallying the cavalry. Warwic showed
great presence of mind in maintaining the ranks of the
foot, on which the horse had recoiled: Me made Sir Peter
Meutas advance, captain of the foot hackbutters, and
Sir Peter Gamboa, captain of some Italian and Spanish
hackbutters, on horseback; and ordered them to ply the
Scots infantry with their shot. They marched to the
slough, and discharged their pieces full in the face of the
enemy: The ships galled them from the flank: The
artillery, planted on a height, infested them from the
front: The English archers poured in a shower of arrows
upon them: And the vanguard, descending from the hill,
advanced, leisurely and orderly, towards them. Dis∣mayed
with all these circumstances, the Scots van began
to retreat: The retreat soon changed into a flight, which
was begun by the Irish archers. The pannic of the van
communicated itself to the main body, and passing thence
to the rear, rendered the whole field a scene of confusion,
terror, flight and consternation. The English army per∣ceived
from the heights the condition of the Scots, and
began the pursuit with loud shouts and acclamations,
which added still more to the dismay of the vanquished.
The horse in particular, eager to revenge the affront,
which they had received in the beginning of the day,
performed the most bloody execution on the flying enemy;
and from the field of battle to Edinburgh, for the space
of five miles, the whole ground was strowed with dead
bodies. The priests above all, and the monks received
no quarter; and the English made sport of slaughtering
men, who, from their extreme zeal and animosity, had
engaged in an enterprise so ill suited to their profession.
Few victories have been more decisive, or gained with
smaller loss to the conquerors. There fell not two hun∣dred
<PB N="327" REF="351"/>
of the English; and according to the most moderate
computation, there perished above ten thousand of the
Scots. About fifteen hundred were taken prisoners. This
action was called the Battle of Pinkey, from a nobleman's
seat of that name in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>THE Queen dowager and Arran fled to Stirling, and
were scarce able to collect such a body of forces as could
check the incursions of small parties of the English.
About the same time, the earl of Lenox and lord Wharton
entered the West Marches, at the head of five thousand
men, and after taking and plundering Annan, they spread
devastation over all the neighbouring countries<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 992.</NOTE>. Had
Somerset prosecuted his advantage, he might have imposed
what terms he pleased on the Scots nation: But he was
impatient to return to England, where he heard, some
counsellors, arid even his own brother, the admiral, were
carrying on cabals against his authority. Having taken
the castles of Hume, Dunglass, Eymouth, Fastcastle,
Roxborough, and some other small places; and having
received the submission of some counties on the borders,
he retired out of Scotland. The fleet, besides destroying
all the ships along the coast, took Broughty in the Firth
of Tay, and haying fortified it, they left there a gar∣rison.
Arran desired leave to send commissioners in order
to treat of a peace; and Somerset, having appointed
Berwic for the place of meeting, left Warwic with full
powers to negociate: But no commissioners from Scot∣land
ever appeared. The overture of the Scots was an
artifice, to gain time, till succours should arrive from
France.</P>
<P>THE protector,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th No∣vember.</NOTE> on his arrival in England, summoned
a Parliament: And being somewhat elated with his suc∣cess
<PB N="328" REF="352"/>
against the Scots, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from his nephew a
paten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, appointing him to sit on the throne, upon a stool
or bench at the right hand of the King, and to enjoy the
same honours and privileges which had usually been pos∣sessed
by any princes of the blood, or uncles of the Kings
of England. In this parent, the King dispensed with
the statute of precedency, enacted during the former
reign<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xv. p. 164.</NOTE>. But if Somerset gave offence by assuming too
much state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> he deserves the highest praise on account of
the laws passed this session, by which the rigour of former
statutes was much mitigated, and some security given to
the freedom of the constitution. All laws were repealed
which extended the crime of treason beyond the statute
of the twenty-fifth of Edward the third<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. c. 12.</NOTE>; all laws en∣acted
during the late reign, extending the crime of felony;
all the former laws against Lollardies or heresy, together
with the statute of the six articles. None were to be ac∣cused
of words but within a month after they were spoken.
By these repeals several of the most rigorous laws that
ever were passed in England, were annulled, and some
dawnings, both of civil and religious liberty, began to
appear to the people. Heresy, however, was still a ca∣pital
crime by the common law, and was subjected to
the penalty of burning. Only there remained no precise
standard by which that crime could be defined or deter∣mined:
A circumstance which might either be advan∣tageous
or hurtful to public security, according to the
disposition of the judges.</P>
<P>A REPEAL also passed of that law, the destruction of
all laws, by which the King's proclamation was made of
equal force with a statute<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. c. 2.</NOTE>. That other law was like∣wise
mitigated, by which the King was empowered to
annul all laws passed before the four and twentieth year
<PB N="329" REF="353"/>
of his age: He could prevent their fut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xecution: but
could not recal any passed effects, which had ensued from
them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. c. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME statutes too were passed which were of the ut∣most
importance, because they promoted the principles
and practices of the reformers, though they may not, all
of them, appear to be attended with any material con∣equences
to civil society. The cup was restored to the
laity; private masses were abolished; the King was em∣powered
to create bishops by letters patent, without any
fictitious election of the chapter; the bishops were or∣dered
to issue their writs, and hold their courts in the
King's name<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; vagabonds were adjudged to be slaves
for two years, and to be marked with a red-hot iron<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. c. 3.</NOTE>;
in act commonly supposed to be levelled against the
strolling priests and friars.</P>
<P>THE chantries and free chapels had been given by act
of Parliament to the late King; and he had appointed
commissioners to take possession of the revenues; but as
they had not proceeded far in the execution of their of∣fice,
it was found necessary to make a renewal of the
grant. The preamble to the statute promises, that these
funds should be employed to good and godly uses, in
erecting grammar schools, in farther augmenting the
universities, and in making better provision for the poor
and needy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. c. 14.</NOTE>. But the rapacious courtiers had already
devoured the prey in their imaginations; and it was not
long before it was shared out among them.</P>
<P>IT was also enacted, that all who denied the King's
supremacy, or asserted the pope's, should, for the first
offence, forfeit their goods and chattels, and suffer im∣prisonment
during pleasure; for the second offence,
<PB N="330" REF="354"/>
should incur the pain of <HI>proemuni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e;</HI> and for the third of∣fence

of March next, endeavoured, by writing, printing, or
any overt act or deed, to deprive the King of his estate
or titles, particularly of his supremacy, or to confer
them on any other, he was to be adjudged guilty of
treason. If any of the heirs of the crown should usurp
upon another, or endeavour to break the order of suc∣cession,
it was declared treason in them, their aiders and
abetters. These were the most considerable acts passed
during this session. The members discovered a very
passive disposition with regard to religion: Some few ap∣peared
zealous for the reformation: Others harboured
secretly a strong inclination to the catholic faith: But
the greatest part appeared willing to take any impression
which they should receive from interest, authority, or the
reigning fashion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE convocation met at the same time with the Par∣liament;
and as it appeared, that their debates were at
first cramped by the rigour of the statute of the six arti∣cles,
the King granted them a dispensation from that
law, before it was repealed by Parliament<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Britan, p. 339.</NOTE>. The lower
house of convocation applied to, have liberty of sitting
with the commons in Parliament; or if this privilege
was refused them, which they claimed as their ancient
right, they desired that no law regarding religion, might
pass in Parliament without their consent and approbation.
But the principles which now prevailed, were more ad∣vantageous
to the civil than the ecclesiastical power.</P>
<P>THE protector had permitted the repeal of that law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1548.</NOTE>
which gave to the King's proclamations the authority of
statutes; but he did not intend to renounce that arbitrary
<PB N="331" REF="355"/>
or discretionary exercise of power, which had ever been
assumed by the crown, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which it is difficult to distint∣guish
exactly from the power of making laws. He even
continued to exert this authority in some particulars,
which were regarded as the most momentous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther progress of the refor∣mation.</NOTE> Orders
were issued by council, that candles should no longer be
carried about on Candlemas-day, ashes on Ash-wednes∣day,
palmes on Palm-sunday<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. P. 59. Collier, vol. ii. p. 241. Heylin, p. 55.</NOTE>. These were ancient re∣ligious
practices, now denominated superstitions; tho' it
is very fortunate for mankind, when superstition, happens
to take a direction so innocent and inoffensive. The se∣vere
disposition which naturally attends all reformers,
prompted likewise the council to abolish some gay and
showy ceremonies, which belonged to the ancient reli∣gion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN order was also issued by the council for the remo∣val
of all images from the churches: An innovation
which was much desired by all the reformers, and which
alone, with regard to the populace, amounted almost to
a total change of the established religion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. 60. Collier, vol. ii. p. 241. Heylin, p. 55.</NOTE>. An attempt
had been made to separate the use of images from their
abuse, the reverence from the worship of them; but the
execution of this design was found, upon trial, very dif∣ficult,
if not wholly impracticable.</P>
<P>AS private masses were abolished by law, it became
necessary to frame a new communion-office; and the
council went so far, in the preface which they had pre∣fixed
to this work, as to leave the practice of auricular
confession wholly indifferent<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii.</NOTE>. This was a prelude to
the entire abolition of that invention, one of the most
<PB N="332" REF="356"/>
powerful engines that ever was contrived for degrading
the laity, and giving their spiritual guides an entire ascen∣dant
over them. And it may justly be said, that though
the priest's absolution, which attends confession, serves
somewhat to ease weak minds from the immediate agonies
of superstitious terror, it operates only by enforcing su∣perstition
itself, and thereby preparing the mind for a
more violent relapse into the same disorders.</P>
<P>THE people were at that time extremely distracted, by
the opposite opinions of their preachers; and as they
were totally incapable to judge of the reasons advanced
on either fide, and naturally regarded every thing which
they heard at church, as of equal authority, a great con∣fusion
and fluctuation resulted from this uncertainty.
The council first endeavoured to remedy that inconve∣nience,
by laying some restraints on preaching; but
finding this expedient ineffectual, they imposed a total
silence on the preachers, and thus put an end at once to
all the polemics of the pulpit<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Fuller, Heylin, Burnet.</NOTE>. By the nature of things,
this restraint could only be temporary. For in propor∣tion
as the ceremonies of public worship, its shews and
exterior observances, were retrenched by the reformers,
the people were inclined to contract a stronger attach∣ment
to sermons, whence alone they received any occu∣pation
or amusement. The ancient religion, by giving
its votaries something to do, freed them from the trouble
of thinking: Sermons were only delivered in the princi∣pal
churches, and at some particular fasts and festivals:
And the practice of haranguing the populace, which, if
abused, is so powerful an incitement to faction and sedi∣tion,
had much less scope and influence during those
ages.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="357"/>
THE greater progress was made towards a reformation
in England, the further did the protector find himself
from all prospect of compleating the union with Scot∣land;
and the Queen-dowager,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> as well as the clergy,
became the more averse to all alliance with a nation
which had departed so far from all ancient principles.
Somerset, having taken the town of Haddington, had or∣dered
it to be strongly garrisoned and fortified, by lord
Gray: He also erected some fortifications at Lauder:
And he hoped, that these two places, together with
Broughty and some smaller fortresses, which were in the
hands of the English, would serve as a curb to Scot∣land;
and would give him access into the heart of the
country.</P>
<P>ARRAN, being disappointed in some attempts on
Broughty, relied chiefly on the succours expected from
France, for the recovery of these places; and they ar∣rived
at last in the Firth, to the number of six thousand
men; one half of whom were Germans. They were
commanded by Dessé, and under him by Andelot, Strozzi,
Meilleraye, count Rhingrave. The Scots were at that
time so sunk by their misfortunes, that five hundred
English horse were able to ravage the whole country
without resistance; and make inroads to the gates of the
capital<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Beague, hist. of the Campagnes 1548 and 1549, p. 6.</NOTE>: But on the appearance of the French succours,
they collected more courage; and having joined Dessé
with a considerable reinforcement, they laid siege to
Haddington<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 993.</NOTE>. This was an undertaking for which they
were themselves totally unfit; being only practised in a
kind of desultory war, where they served without pay,
and with a few weeks provisions, which they brought
along with them. Even with the assistance of the French,
<PB N="334" REF="358"/>
they placed their chief hopes of success in starving the
garrison; and after some vain attempts to take the place
by a regular siege, the blockade of Haddington was
formed. The garrison were repulsed with loss in several
sailles which they made upon the besiegers.</P>
<P>THE hostile attempts which the late King and the
protector had made against Scotland, not being steady,
regular, nor pushed to the last extremity, had served only
to irritate the nation, and to inspire them with the strong∣est
aversion to that confederacy which was courted in so
violent a manner. Even those who were inclined to the
English alliance, were displeased to have it imposed on
them by force of arms; and the earl of Huntley in par∣ticular,
said pleasantly, that he disliked not the match,
but he hated the manner of wooing<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 46. Patten.</NOTE>. The Queen-dowager,
finding these sentiments to prevail, called a Par∣liament,
in an abbey near Haddington; and it was there
proposed, that the young Queen, for her greater secu∣rity,
should be sent to France, and be committed to the
protection of that ancient ally. Some objected, that
this measure was desperate, allowed no resource in case
of miscarriage, exposed the Scots to be subjected by
foreigners, involved them in perpetual war with Eng∣land,
and left them no expedient by which they could
conciliate the friendship of that powerful nation. It
was answered, on the other hand, that the Queen's
presence was the very cause of war with England; that
that nation would desist when they found that their views
of forcing a marriage had become altogether impracti∣cable;
and that Henry, being engaged by so high a mark
of confidence, would take their sovereign under his
guardianship, and use his utmost efforts to defend the
kingdom. These arguments were aided by French
<PB N="335" REF="359"/>
gold, which was plentifully distributed among the nobles.
The governor had a pension conferred on him of twelve
thousand livres a year, received the title of duke of Cha∣telrault,
and obtained for his son the command of an
hundred men at arms<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 83. Buchan. lib. xv. Keith, p. 55. Thu∣anus, lib. v. c. 15.</NOTE>. And as all the clergy dreaded
the consequences of the English alliance, they seconded
this measure with all the zeal and industry which either
principles or interest could inspire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Young Queen of Scots sent into France.</NOTE> It was accordingly
determined to send the Queen to France; and what was
understood to be the necessary consequence, to marry her
to the dauphin. Villegaignon, commander of four
French gallies lying in the Firth of Forth, set sail as if
he intended to return home; but when he reached the
open sea, he turned northwards, passed by the Orkneys,
and came in on the west coast at Dunbarton: A very ex∣traordinary
voyage for ships of that fabric<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. v. c. 15.</NOTE>. The young
Queen was there committed to him; and being attended
with the lords Areskine and Livingstone, she put to sea,
and after meeting with some tempestuous weather, arrived
safely at Brest, whence she was conducted to Paris, and
soon after she was betrothed to the dauphin.</P>
<P>SOMERSET, pressed by many difficulties at home, and
despairing of success in his enterprise against Scotland,
was desirous of composing the differences with that king∣dom,
and he offered the Scots a ten years truce; but as
they insisted on his restoring all the places which he had
taken, the proposal came to nothing. The Scots took
the fortresses of Hume and Fast-castle, by surprize, and
put the garrison to the sword: They repulsed, with loss,
the English, who, under the command of lord Seymour,
made a descent, first in Fife, and then at Montrose:
In the former action, James Stuart, natural brother to
<PB N="336" REF="360"/>
the Queen, acquired honours; in the latter, Areskine of
Dun. An attempt was made by Sir Robert Bowes and
Sir Thomas Palmer, at the head of a considerable body,
to throw relief into Haddington; but these troops falling
into an ambuscade, were almost wholly cut in pieces<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 595. Hollingshed, p. 994.</NOTE>.
And though a small body of two hundred men escaped all
the vigilance of the French, and arrived safely in Had∣dington,
with some ammunition and provisions, the gar∣rison
was reduced to such difficulties, that the protector
found it necessary to provide more effectually for their
relief. He raised an army of eighteen thousand men,
And adding three thousand Gernans, who, on the disso∣lution
of the protestant alliance, had offered their service
to England, he gave the command of the whole to the
earl of Shrewsbury<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 291.</NOTE>. D'Essé raised the siege on the ap∣proach
of the English; and with great difficulty made
good his retreat to Edinburgh, where he posted himself
advantageously. Shrewsbury, who had lost the opportu∣nity
of attacking him on his march, durst not give him
battle in his present situation; and contenting himself
with the advantage already gained of supplying Hadding∣ton,
he retired into England.</P>
<P>WHILE the French troops remained in Scotland,
many complaints had arisen between them and the na∣tives;
and a small accident<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Beagué, p. 68. Knox, p. 81.</NOTE> having excited a tumult in
Edinburgh, the provost and his son were unfortunately
killed by the French soldiers. This event encreased the
animosity between the two nations: But D'Essé, in or∣der
to make atonement for that act of violence, led his
troops hastily to Haddington, and in the night-time at∣tempted
to surprize the town. He found the garrison
unprepared to resist him; and had already entered the
<PB N="337" REF="361"/>
outer court: But a French deserter firing a cannon,
which pointed towards the gates, the shot fell among the
thickest of the enemy, and made such havoc as threw the
whole into confusion, and enabled the English to repulse
them. R is pretended, that no less than a hundred per∣sons
fell by this single shot.</P>
<P>THE French general was a man of ability and expe∣rience;
but as he had not the good fortune to be ac∣ceptable
to the Scots nation, it was thought proper to re∣call
him, and to send over De Thermes in his place.
D'Essé, before his departure, fortified Leith, which,
from a small village, soon became a considerable town,
by the concourse of inhabitants, who found there a se∣curity,
which they could no where else enjoy in Scot∣land.
He also attacked an English garrison in Inch∣keith,
an island opposite to that harbour, and made them
prisoners. After these exploits, he resigned his command
to De Thermes, who brought over with him Monluc,
bishop of Valence, a man celebrated for wisdom and
ability. This prelate was named chancellor of the king∣dom;
and it was probably intended, by his means, to
inspire the nation with some greater attachment to the
principles of law and equity: But the Scots, impatient
of restraint, and jealous of a foreigner, expressed such
discontent, that it was thought more prudent soon after
to recall him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 85. Thuanus, lib. v. c. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOUGH the protection of France was of great con∣sequence
to the Scots, in supporting them against the in∣vasions
of England, they reaped still more benefit from
the distractions and divisions which had crept into the
councils of that latter kingdom Even the two brothers,

stations which they severally enjoyed, and the great emi∣nence
to which they had risen, had entertained the most
violent jealousy of each other's authority;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabals of lord Sey∣mour.</NOTE> and they di∣vided
the whole court and kingdom, by their opposite
cabals and pretensions. Lord Seymour was a man of
insatiable ambition, arrogant, assuming, implacable;
and though esteemed of superior capacity to the protector,
he possessed not to the same degree the confidence and
regard of the people. By his flattery and address, he had
so insinuated himself into the good graces of the Queen-dowager,
that, forgetting her usual prudence and de∣cency,
she married him immediately upon the decease
of the late King: Insomuch, that, had she soon proved
pregnant, it might have been doubtful to which husband
the child belonged. The credit and riches of this alli∣ance
supported the ambition of the admiral; but gave
umbrage to the dutchess of Somerset, who, uneasy that
the younger brother's wife should have the precedency,
employed all her interest with her husband, which was
too great, first to create, and then to widen a breach be∣tween
the two brothers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 301. Heylin, p. 72. Camden▪ Thuanus, lib. vi. c. 5. Haynes, p. 69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE first symptoms of this misunderstanding appeared
when the protector commanded the army in Scotland.
The secretary, Paget, a man devoted to Somerset, re∣marked,
that Seymour was forming separate intrigues
among the counsellors; was corrupting, by presents, the
King's servants; and even endeavouring, by improper
indulgencies and liberalities, to captivate the affections
of the young monarch. Paget represented to him the
danger of this conduct; desired him to reflect on the nu∣merous
enemies whom the sudden elevation of their fa∣mily
had created; and warned him that any dissension
<PB N="339" REF="365"/>
between him and the protector, would be greedily laid
hold of, to draw on the ruin of both. Finding his re∣monstrances
ineffectual, he conveyed intelligence of the
danger to Somerset, and engaged him to leave the enter∣prize
upon Scotland unfinished, in order to guard against
the attempts of his domestic enemies. In the ensuing
Parliament, the admiral's projects appeared still more
hazardous to public tranquillity; and as he had acquired
many partisans and retainers, he made a direct attack
upon his brother's authority. He represented to his
friends, that formerly, during a minority, the office of
protector of the kingdom had been kept separate from
that of governor of the King's person; and that the pre∣sent
union of these two important trusts, conferred on
Somerset an authority which could not safely be lodged
in any subject<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 82, 90.</NOTE>. He even prevailed on the young King,
to write a letter to the Parliament, desiring that Seymour
might be appointed his governor; and he had formed a
party in the two houses, by which he hoped to have ef∣fected
his purpose. The design was discovered before its
execution; and some common friends were sent to re∣monstrate
with him, but had so little influence, that he
threw out many menacing expressions, and rashly threat∣ned,
that, if he was thwarted in his attempt, he would
make this Parliament the blackest that ever was in Eng∣land<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 75.</NOTE>.
The council sent for him, to answer for his con∣duct;
but he refused to attend: They then began to
threaten in their turn, and informed him, that the King's
letter, instead of availing him any thing to the execution
of his purpose, would be imputed to him as a criminal
enterprise, and be construed a design no disturb the go∣vernment,
by forming a separate interest with a child
and minor. They even let fall some menaces of sending
<PB N="340" REF="366"/>
him to the Tower for his temerity; and the admiral,
finding hlmself prevented in his design, was obliged to
submit, and to desire a reconciliation with his brother.</P>
<P>THE mild and moderate temper of Somerset made him
willing to forget these enterprizes of the admiral; but
the ambition of that turbulent spirit could not be so
easily appeased. His spouse, the Queen-dowager, died
in child-bed; but so far from regarding this event as a
check to his aspiring views, he founded on it the scheme
of a more extraordinary elevation. He made his addresses
to the lady Elizabeth, then in the sixteenth year of her
age; and that princess, whom even the hurry of business,
and the pursuits of ambition, could not, in her more ad∣vanced
years, disengage entirely from the tender passions,
seems to have listened to the insinuations of a man who
possessed every talent proper to captivate the affections of
the fair<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 95, 96, 102, 108.</NOTE>. But as Henry the eighth had excluded his
daughters from all hopes of succession, if they married
without the consent of his executors, which Seymour
could never hope to attain; it was concluded, that he
proposed to effectuate his purpose by expedients still more
rash and more criminal. All the other measures of the
admiral tended to confirm this suspicion. He continued
to attack, by presents, the fidelity of all those who had
more immediate access to the King's person: He endea∣voured
to feduce that young prince into his interests:
He found means of holding a private correspondence
with him: He openly decried his brother's administration;
and asserted, that by enlisting Germans, and other
foreigners, he intended to form a mercenary army, which
endangered the King's authority, and the liberty of the
people: By promises and persuasion he brought over to
his party many of the principal nobility; and had distri∣buted
<PB N="341" REF="367"/>
his interest all over England: He neglected not
even the most popular persons of inferior rank; and had
computed, that he could, on occasion, command the ser∣vice
of ten thousand men, among his servants, tenants,
and retainers<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 105, 106.</NOTE>: He had already provided arms for their
use; and having engaged in his interests Sir John Shar∣ington,
a very corrupt man, master of the mint at Bristol,
he flattered himself that money would not be wanting.
Somerset was well informed of all these alarming cir∣cumstances,
and endeavoured by the most friendly expe∣dients,
by intreaty, reason, and even by heaping new
favours upon his brother, to make him depart from his
precipitate councils: But finding all his endeavours inef∣fectual,
he began to think of more severe remedies.
The earl of Warwic was an ill instrument between
the brothers; and had formed the design, by inflaming
the quarrel, to raise his own fortune on tie ruins of
both.</P>
<P>DUDLEY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dudley, earl of Warwic.</NOTE> earl of Warwic, was the son of that Dud∣ley,
minister to Henry the seventh, who having, by ra∣pine,
extortion, and perversion or law, incurred the ha∣tred
of the public, had been sacrificed to popular animosity,
in the beginning of the subsequent reign. The late
King, sensible of the iniquity, at least illegality of the
sentence, had afterwards restored young Dudley's blood
by act of Parliament; and finding him endowed with
ability, industry, and enterprize, he had entrusted him
with many important commands, and had ever found him
successful in all his undertakings. He raised him to the
dignity of viscount Lisle, conferred on him the office of
admiral, and gave him by his will a place among his exe∣cutors.
Dudley made still farther progress during the
minority; and having obtained the title of earl of War∣wic,
<PB N="342" REF="368"/>
and undermined the credit of Southampton, he bore
the first rank among the protector's counsellors. The
victory, gained at Pinkey, was much ascribed to his cou∣rage
and conduct; and he was universally regarded as a
man equally endowed with the talents of peace and war.
But all these virtues were obscured by still greater vices;
an exorbitant ambition, an insatiable avarice, a neglect
of decency, a contempt of justice: And as he found,
that lord Seymour, whose ability and enterprise he chiefly
dreaded, was involving himself in ruin, by his rash coun∣cils,
he was determined to push him over the precipice;
and thereby remove the chief obstacle to his own projec∣ted
greatness.</P>
<P>WHEN Somerset sound that the public peace was ex∣posed
by his brother's seditious, if not rebellious, schemes,
he was the more easily persuaded, by Warwic, to employ
the extent of royal authority against him; and after de∣priving
him of the office of admiral, he signed a warrant
for committing him to the Tower. Some of his accom∣plices
were also taken into custody; and three privy
counsellors, being sent to examine them, made a report,
that they had met with very full and important discoveries.
Yet still the protector suspended the blow, and showed a
reluctance to ruin his brother. He offered to depart from
the prosecution, if Seymour would promise him a cordial
reconcilement; and relinquishing all ambitious hopes,
be contented with a private life, and retire into the coun∣try.
But as Seymour made no other answer to these
friendly offers than menaces and defiances, he ordered a
charge to be drawn up against him, consisting of thirty∣three
articles<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. Coll. 31. 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 18.</NOTE>; and the whole to be laid before the privy-council.
It is pretended, that every particular was so
incontestibly proved, both by witnesses and his own hand∣writing,
<PB N="343" REF="369"/>
that there was no room for doubt; yet did the
council think proper to go in a body to the Tower, in
order more fully to examine the prisoner. He was not
daunted by the appearance; but boldly demanded a fair
trial; required to be confronted with the witnesses;
desired that the charge might be left with him, in order
to be considered; and refused to answer any interroga∣tories,
by which he might ensnare himself.</P>
<P>IT is apparent, that notwithstanding what is pretend∣ed,
there must have been some deficiency in the evidence
against Seymour, when such demands, founded on the
plainest principles of law and equity, were absolutely re∣jected.
We shall indeed conclude, if we carefully exa∣mine
the charge, that many of the articles were general,
and scarce capable of any proof; many of them, if true,
susceptible of a mere favourable interpretation; and that,
tho' on the whole, Seymour appears to have been a very
dangerous subject, yet he had not advanced far in those
treasonable projects imputed to him. The chief part of
his guilt seems to have consisted in some unwarrantable
practices in the admiralty, by which pyrates were pro∣tected,
and illegal impositions laid upon the merchants.</P>
<P>BUT the administration had, at that time, an easy in∣strument
of vengeance, to wit, the Parliament; and
needed not to give themselves any concern with regard
either to the guilt of the persons whom they prosecuted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE>
or the evidence which could be produced against them.
A session of Parliament being held,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th No∣vember.</NOTE> it was proposed to
proceed against Seymour by bill of attainder; and much
persuasion being employed to engage the young King to
consent to it, a considerable weight was put on his ap∣probation.
The matter was first laid before the upper
house; and several peers, rising up in their places, gave
an account of what they knew concerning lord Seymour's
<PB N="344" REF="370"/>
conduct, and his criminal words or actions. These nar∣ratives
were received for undoubted evidence; and tho'
the prisoner had formerly engaged many friends and par∣tizans
among the nobility,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1549.</NOTE> no one had either the courage
or equity to move,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attainder of Lord Seymour.</NOTE> that he might be heard in his own
defence, that the testimony against him should be deli∣vered
in a legal manner, and that he should be confronted
with the witnesses. A little more scruple was made in
the house of commons: There were even some members
who objected against the whole method of proceeding by
bills of attainder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 March.</NOTE> passed in absence; and required, that
a formal trial should be given to every man before his
condemnation. But upon receiving a message from the
King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His execu∣tion.</NOTE> requiring them to proceed, and offering that the
same narratives should be laid before them which had
satisfied the peers, they were easily prevailed on to ac∣quiesce<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 18.</NOTE>. The bill passed in a very full house. Near four
hundred voted for it; and not above nine or ten against
it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 99.</NOTE>. The sentence was soon after executed, and the
prisoner was beheaded on Tower-hill. The warrant was
signed by Somerset, who was exposed to much blame, on
account of the violence of these proceedings. The at∣tempts
of the admiral seemed chiefly to be levelled against
his brother's usurped authority; and tho' his ambitious,
enterprizing character, encouraged by a marriage with
the lady Elizabeth, might have proved dangerous to pub∣lic
tranquillity, the prudence of foreseeing dangers at such
a distance, was deemed too great, and the remedy was
plainly illegal. It could only be said, that this bill of
attainder was somewhat more tolerable than the preceding
ones, to which the nation had beer accustomed. For
here, at least, some shadow of evidence was produced.</P>
<P>ALL the other Considerable business transacted this ses∣sion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesiasti∣cal affairs.</NOTE>
besides the attainder of lord Seymour, regarded
<PB N="345" REF="371"/>
ecclesiastical matters; which were now the chief concern
of the nation. A committee of bishops and divines had
been appointed by the council, to frame a liturgy for the
service of the church; and they had executed the work
committed to them. They proceeded with great mode∣ration
in this delicate undertaking: They retained as
much of the ancient mass as the principles of the re∣formers
would permit: They indulged nothing to the
spirit of contradiction, which so naturally takes place
in all great innovations: And they flattered themselves,
that they had framed a service, in which every denomi∣nation
of Christians might, without scruple, concur.
The mass had been always celebrated in Latin; a prac∣tice
which might have been deemed absurd, had it not
been found useful to the clergy, by impressing the people
with an idea of some mysterious unknown virtue in those
rites, and by checking all their pretensions to be familiarly
acquainted with their religion. But as the reformers
pretended in some few particulars to encourage private
judgment in the laity, the translation of the liturgy, as
well as of the Scriptures, into the vulgar tongue, seemed
more conformable to the genius of their sect; and this
innovation, with the retrenchment of prayers to saints,
and of some superstitious ceremonies, was the chief dif∣ference
between the old mass and the new liturgy. The
Parliament established this form of worship in all the
churches, and ordered an uniformity to be observed in all
the rites and ceremonies<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was another very material act, which passed
this session. The former canons had established the ce∣libacy
of the clergy; and though this practice be usually
ascribed to the policy of the court of Rome, who thought,
that the ecclesiastics would be more devoted to their spiri∣tual
<PB N="344" REF="372"/>

<PB N="346" REF="374"/>
head, and less dependant on the civil magistrate,
when freed from the powerful tyes of wives and children;
yet was this institution much forwarded by the principles
of superstition inherent in human nature. These princi∣ples
had rendered the panegyrics of an inviolate chastity
so frequent among the ancient fathers, long before the
establishment of celibacy. And even the English parlia∣ment,
though they framed a law, permitting the marriages of
priests, yet confess, in the preamble, “that it were
better for priests and the ministers of the church to
live chaste and without marriage, and it were much
to be wished they would of themselves abstain.” The
inconveniences, which had arisen from compelling chas∣tity
and prohibiting marriage, are the reason assigned for
indulging a liberty in this particular<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 21.</NOTE>. The ideas of pen∣nance
also were so much retained in other particulars,
that an act of parliament passed, prohibiting the use of
flesh-meat, during Lent and the other times of absti∣nence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 19.</P>
<P>Another act, passed this session, takes notice in the preamble, that the city of York, formerly well inhabited, was now much decayed: Inso∣much that many of the cures could not afford a competent maintenance to the incumbents. To remedy this inconvenience, the magistrates were impowered to unite as many parishes as they thought proper. An eccle∣siastical historian. Collier, vol. ii. p. 230, thinks that this decay of York is chiefly to be ascribed to the dissolution of monasteries, by which the revenues sell into the hands of persons who lived at a distance.</P>
<P>A very grievous tax was imposed this session upon the whole stock and monied interest of the kingdom, and even upon its industry. It was a shilling in the pound yearly, during three years, on every person worth ten pounds or upwards: The double on aliens and denizens. These last, if above twelve years of age, and if worth less than twenty Shil∣lings, were to pay eight pence yearly. Every wether was to pay two pence yearly; every ewe three pence. The woolen manufactures were to pay eight pence a pound on the value of all the cloth they made.</P>
<P>These exorbitant taxes on money are a proof, that few people lived on the money lent out at interest: For this tax amounts to the half of the yearly income of all money-holders, during three years, estimating their interest at the rate allowed by law; and was too grievous to be borne, if many persons had been affected by it. It is remarkable, that no tax at all was laid upon land this session. The profits of merchandise were commonly so high, that it was supposed it could bear this imposition. The most absurd part of the law seems to be the tax upon the woolen manufacture. See 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 36. The subsequent Parlia∣ment repealed the tax on sheep and woolen cloth. 3 &amp; 4 Edw. VI. cap. 23. But they continued the other tax a year longer. Ibid.</P>
<P>The clergy taxed themselves at six shillings in the pound to be paid in three years. This taxation was ratified in Parliament, which had been the common practice since the reformation, as if the clergy had no legislative power, even over themselves. See 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 35.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="375"/>
THE principal tenets and practices of the catholic re∣ligion
were now abolished, and the reformation, such as
we enjoy it at present, was almost entirely compleated
in England. But the doctrine of the real presence, tho'
tacitly condemned by the new communion-service and
by the prohibition of many antient rites, still retained
some hold of the minds of men; and it was the last doc∣trine
of popery, which was wholly abandoned by the
people<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. cap. 104.</NOTE>. The extreme attachment of the late King to
that tenet might be some ground for this obstinacy; but
the chief cause was really the extreme absurdity of the
principle itself, and the profound veneration, which of
course is impressed on the mind. The priests likewise
were much inclined to favour an opinion, which attributed
to them so miraculous a power; and the people, who be∣lieved
that they participated of the very body and blood
of their Saviour, were loth to renounce so extraordinary,
and as they imagined, so salutary a privilege. The gene∣ral
attachment to this dogma was so violent, that the
Lutherans, notwithstanding their separation from Rome,
<PB N="348" REF="376"/>
had thought proper, under another name, still to retain
it: And the catholic preachers, in England, when re∣strained
in every other particular, could not forbear, on
every occasion, from inculcating that tenet. Bonner,
for this offence among others, had been tried by the
council, had been deprived of his see, and had been com∣mitted
to custody. Gardiner also, who had recovered
his liberty, appeared anew refractory to the authority,
which established the late innovations; and he seemed
willing to countenance that opinion, much favoured by
all the English catholics, that the King was indeed su∣preme
head of the church, but not the council, during a
minority. Having declined giving full satisfaction on
this head, be was sent to the Tower, and threatened with
farther effects of the council's displeasure.</P>
<P>THESE severities, being exercised against men, posses∣sed
of office and authority, seemed a necessary policy,
in order to enforce an uniformity in public worship and
discipline: But there were other instances of persecution,
which were derived from no other origin than the bigotry
of theologians; a malady, which seems almost incurable.
Though the protestant divines had ventured to renounce
opinions, deemed certain during so many centuries, they
regarded in their turn, the new system as so certain,
that they could bear no contradiction with regard to it;
and they were ready to burn in the same flames, from
which they themselves had so narrowly escaped, every
one who had the assurance to oppose them. A commis∣sion
by act of council was granted to the primate and
some others, to examine and search after all anabaptists,
heretics, or contemners of the book of common prayer<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 3. Rymer, tom. xv. p. 181.</NOTE>.
They were enjoined to reclaim them, if possible; to im∣pose
penance on them; and to give them absolution: Or
<PB N="349" REF="377"/>
if they were obstinate, to excommunicate and imprison
them, and to deliver them over to the secular arm; And in
the execution of this charge, the commissioners were not
bound to observe the ordinary methods of trial; the
forms of law were dispensed with, and if any statutes hap∣pened
to interfere with the powers in the commission,
they were over-ruled and abrogated by the council.
Some tradesmen in London were brought before these
commissioners, and were accused of maintaining, among
other opinions, that a man regenerate could not sin,
and that though the outward man might offend, the
inward was incapable of all guilt. They were prevailed
on to abjure and were dismissed. But there was a woman
accused of heretical pravity, called Joan Bocher, or Joan
of Kent, who was so extremely obstinate, that the com∣missioners
could gain nothing upon her. Her doctrine
was, “That Christ was not truly incarnate of the vir∣gin,
whose flesh, being the outward man, was sinfully
begotten and born in sin; and consequen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly; he could
take none of it: But the word, by the consent of the
inward man of the virgin, was made flesh<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. coll, 35. Strype's Mem. Cranm. p. 181.</NOTE>.” This
opinion, it would seem, is not orthodox; and there was
a necessity for delivering the woman to the flames for
maintaining it. But the young King, though in such
tender years, had more sense than all his counsellors and
preceptors; and he long refused to sign the warrant for
her execution. Cranmer was employed to persuade him
to compliance; and he said, that there was a great dif∣ference
between errors in other points of divinity, and
those which were directly contradictory to the Apostles
creed; These latter were impieties against God, which
the prince, being God's deputy, ought to repress; in like
manner, as the King's deputies were bound to punish
<PB N="350" REF="378"/>
offences against the King's person. Edward, overcome
by importunity more than reason, at last submitted, tho'
with tears in his eyes; and he told Cranmer, that, if
any wrong was done, the guilt should lie entirely on his
head. The primate, after making a new effort to re∣claim
the woman from her errors, and. finding her obsti∣nate
against all his arguments, at last committed her to
the flames. Some time after, a Dutchman, called Van
Paris, accused of the heresy which has received the name
of Arianism, was condemned to the same punishment.
He suffered with so much satisfaction, that he hugged
and caressed the faggots, which were consuming him; a
species of frenzy of which there is more than one instance
among the martyrs of this age<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 112. Strype's Mem. Cranm. p. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE rigorous methods of proceeding soon brought
the whole nation to a conformity with the new doctrine
and the new liturgy. The lady Mary alone continued
to adhere to the mass, and refused to admit the established
modes of worship. When pressed and menaced on this
head, she applied to the Emperor; who, using his in∣terest
with Sir Philip Hobby, the English ambassador,
procured her a temporary connivance from the council<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 102.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THERE is no abuse so great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXV.</NOTE> in civil society,
as not to be attended with a great variety of bone∣ficial

the loss of these advantages is always felt very sen∣sibly,

slow effect of time, and is seldom perceived by the bulk
of a nation. Scarce any institution can be imagined less
favourable, in the main, to the interests of mankind than
that of monks and friars; yet was it followed by many
good effects, which, having ceased by the suppression of
monasteries, were very much regretted by the people of
England. The monks, residing always in their con∣vents,
in the heart of their estates, spent their money in
the provinces and among their tenants, afforded a ready
market for commodities, were a sure resource to the poor
and indigent and though their hospitality and charity
gave but too much encouragement to idleness, and pre∣vented
the encrease of public riches, yet did it provide to
many a remedy against the extreme pressures of want
<PB N="352" REF="380"/>
and necessity. It is also observable, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as the friar
were limited, by the rules of their institution, to a certain
train of life, they had not equal motives for avarice with
other men; and they were acknowledged to have been
in England, as they still are in Roman catholic coun∣tries,
the best and most indulgent landlords. The ab∣bots
and priors were allowed to give leases at an under∣value,
and to receive, in return, a large present from the
tenant; in the same manner as is still practised by the
bishops and colleges. But when the abbey-lands were
distributed among the great nobility and courtiers, they
fell under a different management: The rents of farms
were raised, while the tenants found not the same faci∣lity
in disposing of the produce; the money was spent in
the capital; and the farmers, living at a distance, were
exposed to all the oppressions of their new masters, or to
the still greater rapacity of the stewards.</P>
<P>THESE complaints of the common people were at that
time heightened by other causes. The arts of manufac∣ture
were much more advanced in other European coun∣tries
than in England; and even in England these arts
had made greater progress than the knowledge of agri∣culture;
a profession, which of all mechanical employ∣ments,
requires the most reflection and experience. A
great demand arose for wool both abroad and at home:
Pasturage was found more profitable than unskilful til∣lage:
Whole estates were laid waste by inclosures: The
tenants, regarded as a useless burthen, were expelled
their habitations: Even the cottagers, deprived of the
commons, on which they formerly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed their cattle, were
reduced to misery: And a great decay of people, as well
as diminution of the former plenty, was remarked in the
kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. ii. Repository O.</NOTE>. This grievance was now of an old date;
<PB N="353" REF="381"/>
and Sir Thomas More, alluding to it, observes in his
Utopia, that a sheep had become in England a more ra∣venous
animal than a lion or wolf, and devoured whole
villages, cities, and provinces.</P>
<P>THE general encrease also of gold and silver in Europe,
after the discovery of the West Indies, had a tendency to
inflame these complaints. The growing demand, in the
more commercial countries, had heightened every where
the price of commodities, which could easily be tran∣sported
thither; but in England, the labour of men,
who could not so easily change their habitation, still re∣mained
nearly at the ancient rates; and the poor people
complained that they could no longer gain a subsistence
by their industry. It was by an addition alone of toil
and application they were enabled to provide a main∣tenance;
and though this encrease of industry was at
last the effect of the present situation, and an effect very
beneficial to society, yet was it difficult for the people to
shake off their former habits of indolence; and nothing
but necessity could compel them to that exertion of their
faculties.</P>
<P>IT must also be remarked, that the profusion of
Henry the eighth, had reduced him, notwithstanding
his rapacity, to such difficulties that he had been obliged
to remedy a present necessity, by the pernicious expedient
of debasing the coin; and the wars, in which the pro∣tector
had been involved, had induced him to carry still
farther the same abuse. The usual consequences ensued:
The good coin was hoarded or exported; base metal was
coined at home or imported from abroad in great abun∣dance;
the common people, who received their wages in
it, could not purchase commodities at the usual rates;
an universal diffidence and stagnation of commerce took
<PB N="354" REF="382"/>
place; and loud complaints were heard in every part
of England.</P>
<P>THE protector, who loved popularity, and compas∣sionated
the condition of the people, encouraged these
complaints by his endeavours to remedy them. He ap∣pointed
a commission for making enquiry concerning in∣closures;
and issued a proclamation, ordering all late in∣closures
to be laid open by a day assigned. The popu∣lace,
meeting with such countenance from the govern∣ment,
began to rise in several places, and to commit dis∣orders;
but were quieted by remonstranees and persua∣sion.
In order to give them greater satisfaction, Somer∣set
appointed new commissioners, whom he sent every
where, with an unlimited power to hear and determine
all causes about inclosures, high-ways, and cottages<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 115. Strype, vol. ii. p. 171.</NOTE>.
As the object of this commission was very disagreeable to
the gentry and nobility, they called the commission ar∣bitrary
and illegal; and the common people, fearing it
would be eluded, and being impatient for immediate re∣dress,
could no longer contain their fury, but sought for
a remedy by force of arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣tions.</NOTE> The rising began at once in
several parts of England, as if an universal conspiracy
had been formed by the commonalty. The rebels in
Wiltshire were dispersed by Sir William Herbert: Those
in the neighbouring counties, Oxford and Glocester, by
lord Gray of Wilton. Many of the rioters were killed
in the field: Others were executed by martial law. The
commotions in Hampshire, Sussex, Kent, and other
counties, were quieted by gentler methods; but he dis∣orders
in Devonshire and Norfolk threatened the most
fatal consequences.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="383"/>
THE commonalty in Devonshire began with the usual
pretence of inclosures and of oppressions from the gentry;
but the parish priest of Sampford-Courtenay, had the ad∣dress
to give their discontents a direction towards reli∣gion;
and the delicacy of this subject, in the present
emergency, made the insurrection immediately appear
dangerous. In other counties, the gentry had kept
closely united with the government; but here many of
them took part with the populace; among others, Hum∣phrey
Arundel governor of St. Michael's Mount. The
rioters were brought to the form of a regular army, and
amounted to the number of 10,000 men. Lord Russel
had been sent against them at the head of a small force;
but finding himself too weak to encounter them in the
field, he kept at a distance, and began to treat and ne∣gotiate
with them; in hopes of eluding their fury by de∣lay,
and of dispersing them by the difficulty of their sub∣sisting
in a body. Their demands were, that the mass
should be restored, half of the abbey-lands resumed,
the law of the six articles executed, holy water and holy
bread respected, and all other particular grievances re∣dressed<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 292. Hollingshed, p. 1003. Fox vol ii. p. 666. Mem. Cranm, p. 186.</NOTE>.
The council, to whom Russel transmitted
these demands, sent a haughty answer; exhorted the re∣bels
to disperse; and promised them pardon upon their
immediate submission; Enraged at this disappointment,
they marched to Exeter; carrying before them crosses,
banners, holy-water, candlesticks, and other implements
of the antient superstition; together with the hoste,
which they covered with a canopy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 76.</NOTE>. The inhabitants of
Exeter shut their gates; and the rebels, as they had no
cannon, endeavoured to take the place, first by scalade,
then by mining, but were repulsed in all their attempts.
<PB N="356" REF="384"/>
Russel meanwhile lay at Honiton, till reinforced by Sir
William Herbert, and lord Gray, with some German
horse, and some Italian arquebusiers under Battista Spi∣nola.
He then resolved to attempt the relief of Exeter,
which was now reduced to extremities. He attacked the
rebels, drove them from all their posts, committed great
slaughter upon them both in the action and pursuit<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Stow's Annals, p. 597. Hayward, p. 295.</NOTE>, and
took many prisoners. Arundel and the other leaders
were sent to London, tried and executed. Many of the
inferior sort were put to death by martial law<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 295, 296,</NOTE>: The vi∣car
of St. Thomas, one of the principal incendiaries, was
hanged on the top of his own tower, arrayed in his po∣pish
weeds, with his beads at his girdle<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 76. Hollingshed, p. 1026.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE insurrection in Norfolk rose still to a greater
height, and was attended with greater violences. The
populace were at first excited, as in other places, by the
complaints against inclosures; but finding their num∣bers
amount to twenty thousand men, they grew insolent
on their force, and proceeded to more exorbitant preten∣sions.
They required the suppression of the gentry,
the placing new counsellors about the King, and the re∣establishment
of the antient rites. One Ket, a tanner,
had assumed the government of them; and he exercised
his authority with the utmost insolence and outrage.
Having taken possession of Moushold-Hill near Norwich,
he erected his tribunal under an old oak, thence called
the oak of reformation; and summoning the gentry to
appear before him, he gave such decrees as might be ex∣pected
from his character and situation. The marquis
of Northampton was first ordered against him; but met
with a repulse, in an action, where lord Sheffield was
<PB N="357" REF="385"/>
killed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 597. Hollingshed, p. 1030—-34. Strype, vol. ii. p. 174.</NOTE>. The protector affected popularity, and cared
not to appear in person against the rebels; He therefore
sent next the earl of Warwic at the head of 6000 men,
levied for the wars against Scotland; and he thereby
afforded his mortal enemy an opportunity of augmenting
his reputation and character. Warwic, haying tried
some skirmishes with the rebels, at last made a general
attack upon them, and put them to flight. Two thou∣sand
of them fell in the fight and pursuit: Ket was
hanged at Norwich castle; nine of his followers on the
boughs of the oak of reformation; and the insurrection
was entirely suppressed. Some rebels in Yorkshire, hear∣ing
of the fate of their companions, accepted the offers
of pardon, and threw down their arms, A general in∣demnity
was soon after published by the protector<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 297, 298, 299.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though the insurrections were thus quickly sub∣dued
in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the war with Scot∣land.</NOTE> and no traces of them seemed to re∣main,
they were attended with very bad consequences
with regard to the foreign interests of the nation. The
forces of the earl of Warwic, which might have made a
great impression on Scotland, were diverted from that
enterprize; and De Thermes had leisure to reduce that
country to some settlement and composure. He took the
fortress of Broughty, and put the garrison to the sword.
He straitened the English at Haddington; and though
lord Dacres found means to throw relief into the place,
and to reinforce the garrison, it was experienced to be
very chargeable, and even impracticable to keep possession
of that fortress. The Whole country in the neighbour∣hood
was laid waste by the inroads both of the Scots and
English, and could afford no supply to the garrison:
The place lay above thirty miles from the borders; so
<PB N="358" REF="386"/>
that a regular army was necessary to escort thither any
provisions: And as the plague had broke out among the
troops, they perished daily, and were reduced to a state
of great weakness. For these reasons, orders were gi∣ven
to dismantle Haddington, and to convoy the artil∣lery
and garrison to Berwic; and the earl of Rutland,
now created warden of the east marches, executed the
orders.</P>
<P>THE King of France also took advantage of the
distractions of the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With France.</NOTE> in order to recover Boulogne,
and that territory, which Henry the eighth had con∣quered
from France. On other pretences, he assembled
an army; and falling suddenly upon the Boullonois,
took the castles of Sellacque, Blackness, and Ambleteuse,
though well supplied with garrisons, ammunition, and
provisions<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib vi. c. 6.</NOTE>. He attempted to surprize Boulenberg, and
was repulsed; but the garrison, not thinking the place
tenable after the loss of the other fortresses, destroyed the
works, and retired to Boulogne. The rains, which fell
in great abundance during the autumn, and a pestilential
distemper, which broke out in the French camp, de∣prived
Henry of all hopes of success against Boulogne it∣self;
and he retired to Paris<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 300.</NOTE>. He left the command
of the army to Gaspar de Coligny, lord of Chatillon, so
famous afterwards under the name of admiral Coligny;
and he gave him orders to form the siege early in the
spring. The active disposition of this general engaged
him to make, during the winter, several attempts against
the place; but they proved all unsuccessful.</P>
<P>STROZZI, who commanded the French fleet and gal∣leys,
endeavoured to make a descent on Jersey; but
meeting there with an English fleet, an action ensued,
<PB N="359" REF="387"/>
which seems not to have been decisive, since the histo∣rians
of the two nations differ so widely in their accounts
of the event<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Thuan. King Edward's Journal, Stowe, p. 597.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS soon as the French war broke out, the protector
endeavoured to fortify himself with the alliance of the
emperor; and he sent over secretary Paget to Brussels,
where Charles then resided, in order to assist Sir Philip
Hobby, the ordinary ambassador, in this negotiation.
But that prince had formed a design of extending his do∣minions
by acting the part of champion for the catholic
religion; and though extremely desirous of fortifying
himself by the English alliance against France, his capi∣tal
enemy, he thought it unsuitable to his other preten∣sions
to enter into strict confederacy with a nation, which
had broke off all connexions with the church of Rome.
He therefore declined all advances of friendship from
England; and eluded the applications of the ambassa∣dors.
An exact account is preserved of this negotiation
in a letter of Hobby; and it is remarkable, that the em∣peror,
in a conversation with the English ministers, as∣serted,
that the prerogatives of a King of England were
more extensive than those of a King of France<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 132, 175.</NOTE>. Bur∣net,
who preserves this letter, subjoins, as a parallel in∣stance,
that one objection which the Scots made to mar∣rying
their Queen with Edward, was that all their pri∣vileges
would be fwallowed up by the great prerogative
of the Kings of England<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 133.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOMERSET, finding no assistance from the emperor,
was inclined to conclude a peace with France and Scot∣land;
and besides that he was not in a condition to
maintain such ruinous wars, he thought, that there no
<PB N="360" REF="388"/>
longer remained any object of hostilities. The Scots had
sent away their Queen; and could not, if ever so much
inclined, compleat the marriage contracted with Ed∣ward:
And as Henry the eighth had stipulated to restore
Boulogne in 1554, it seemed a matter of small conse∣quence
to anticipate a few years, the term of the treaty.
But when he proposed these reasons to the council, he
met with strong opposition from his enemies, who, see∣ing
him unable to support the war, were determined, for
that very reason, to oppose all proposals for a pacifica∣tion.
The factions ran very high in the court of Eng∣land;
and matters were drawing to an issue, fatal to the
authority of the protector.</P>
<P>AFTER Somerset obtained the patent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in the council.</NOTE> investing him
with regal authority, he no longer paid any attention to
the opinion of the other counsellors; and being elated
with his high dignity, as well as with his victory at
Pinkey, he thought, that every one ought, in every
thing, to yield to his sentiments. All those who were
not entirely devoted to him, were sure to be neglected;
whoever opposed his will received marks of anger or con∣tempt<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. ii. p. 181.</NOTE>;
and while he shewed a resolution to govern
every thing, his capacity appeared not, in any respect,
proportioned to his ambition. Warwic, more subtle and
artful, covered more exorbitant views under fairer ap∣pearances;
and having associated himself with Southamp∣ton,
who had been readmitted into the council, he
formed a strong party, who were determined to free them∣selves
from the slavery, imposed on them by the pro∣tector.</P>
<P>THE malecontent counsellors found the disposition of
the nation very favourable to their designs. The nobi∣lity
<PB N="361" REF="389"/>
and gentry were in general displeased with, the pre∣ference,
which Somerset seemed to have given the peo∣ple;
and as they ascribed all the insults to which they
had been lately exposed, to his procrastination, and to
the encouragement given the multitude, so they appre∣hended
a renewal of the same disorders from his present
affectation of popularity. He had erected a court of re∣quests
in his own house for the relief of the people<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. ii, p. 183.</NOTE>,
and he interposed with the judges in their behalf; a
measure which might be denominated illegal, if any ex∣ertion
of prerogative at that time, could with certainty
deserve that appellation. And this attempt, which was
a stretch of power, seemed the more unpolitic, because it
disgusted the nobility, the surest support of monarchical
authority.</P>
<P>BUT though Somerset courted the people, the interest
which he had formed with them, was in no degree an∣swerable
to his expectations. The catholic party, who
retained influence with the multitude, were his declared
enemies; and took advantage of every opportunity to de∣cry
his conduct. The attainder and execution of his
brother bore an odious aspect: The introduction of fo∣reign
troops into the kingdom, was represented in very
invidious colours: The great estate which he had sud∣denly
acquired, at the expence of the church and of the
crown, rendered him obnoxious: And the palace which
he was building in the Strand, served by its magnifi∣cence,
and still more by other circumstances which at∣tended
it, to expose him to the censures of the public.
The parish church of St. Mary, with three bishops
houses, were pulled down, to furnish ground and mate∣rials
for this structure: Not contented with that sacri∣lege,
an attempt was made to demolish St. Margaret's,
<PB N="362" REF="390"/>
Westminster, and to employ the stones to the same pur∣pose;
but the parishioners rose in a tumult, and chaced
away the protector's tradesmen. He then laid his hands
on a chapel in St. Paul's Church-yard, with a cloister,
and charnel-house belonging to it; and these edifices,
together with a church of St. John of Jerusalem, were
made use of to raise his palace. What rendered the
matter more odious to the people, was that the tombs,
and other monuments of the dead were defaced; and
the bones carried away, and buried in unconsecrated
ground<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 72, 73. Stowe's Survey of London. Hayward, p. 303.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL these imprudences were remarked by Somerset's
enemies, who resolved to take advantage of them. The
lord St. John,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Octo∣ber.</NOTE> president of the council, the earls of
Warwic, Southampton, and Arundel, with five coun∣sellors
more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspiracy against So∣merset.</NOTE> met at Ely-house; and assuming to them∣selves
the whole power of the council, began to act in∣dependent
of the protector, whom they represented as the
author of every public grievance and misfortune. They
wrote letters to the chief nobility and gentry in England,
informing them of the present measures, and requiring
their assistance: They sent for the mayor and aldermen
of London, and enjoined them to obey their orders,
without regard to any contrary orders which they should
receive from the duke of Somerset. They laid the same
injunctions on the lieutenant of the tower, who expressed
his resolution to comply with them. Next day, Rich,
lord chancellor, the marquis of Northampton, the earl
of Shrewsbury, Sir Thomas Cheney, Sir John Gage,
Sir Ralph Sadler, and the lord chief justice Montague,
joined the malecontent counsellors; and every thing bore
a bad aspect for the protector's authority. Secretary
<PB N="363" REF="391"/>
Petre, whom he had sent to treat with the council,
chose rather to remain, with them; and the common
council of the city, being applied to, declared with one
voice their approbation of the new measures, and their
resolution of supporting them<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 597, 598. Hollinshed, p, 1057.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE protector had no sooner heard of the defection of
the counsellors, than he removed the King from Hamp∣ton-court,
where he then resided, to the castle of
Windsor; and, arming his friends and servants, seemed
resolute to defend himself against all his enemies. But
finding, that no man of rank, except Cranmer and Pa∣get,
adhered to him, that the people did not rise at his
summons, that the City and Tower had declared against
him, that even his best friends and confidents had de∣serted
him, he lost all hopes of success, and began to ap∣ply
to his enemies for pardon and forgiveness. No soon∣er
was this despondency known, than lord Russel, Sir
John Baker, speaker of the house of commons, and
three counsellors more, who had hitherto remained neu∣ters,
joined Warwic's party, whom every body now re∣garded
as masters. The council informed the public,
by proclamation, of their actions and intentions; they
wrote to the princesses Mary and Elizabeth, to the same
purpose; they made addresses to the King, in which, af∣ter
the humblest protestations of duty and obedience,
they informed him, that they were the council appointed
by his father, for the government of the kingdom during
his minority; that they had chosen the duke of Somer∣set
protector, with the express condition that he should
guide himself by their advice and direction; that he had
usurped the whole authority to himself, and had ne∣glected,
and even in every thing opposed, their advice;
that he had proceeded to that height of presumption, as
<PB N="364" REF="392"/>
to levy forces against them, and place these forces a∣bout
his majesty's person: They therefore begged that
they might be admitted to his royal presence that he
would be pleased to restore them to his confidence,
and that Somerset's servants might be dismissed. Their
request was complied with: Somerset capitulated only
for gentle treatment, which was promised him. He
was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somerset resigns the protector∣ship.</NOTE> however, sent to the Tower<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 600.</NOTE>, with some of his
friends and partizans, among whom was Cecil, who was
afterwards so much distinguished. Articles of charge
were exhibited against him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. book i. coll. 46. Hay∣ward, p. 308. Stowe, p. 601. Hollingshed, p. 1059.</NOTE>; of which the chief, at
least the best founded, is his usurpation of the govern∣ment,
and his taking into his own hands the whole ad∣ministration of affairs. The clause of his patent, which
invested him with absolute power, unlimited by any law,
was never objected to him; plainly, because, according
to the sentiments of those times, that power was, in
some degree involved in the very idea of regal autho∣rity.</P>
<P>THE catholics were extremely elevated with this revo∣lution;
and as they had ascribed all the late innovations
to Somerset's councils, they hoped, that his fall would
prepare the way for the return of the antient religion.
But Warwic, who now bore chief sway in the council,
was entirely indifferent with regard to all these points
of controversy; and finding, that the principles of the
reformation had sunk deeper into the young prince's
mind than to be easily eradicated, he was determined to
comply with his inclinations, and not to hazard his new
acquired power by any dangerous councils. He took
care very early to express his intentions of supporting the
reformation; and he threw such discouragements on
<PB N="365" REF="393"/>
Southampton, who stood at the head of the Romanists,
and whom he considered as a dangerous rival, that the
high-spirited nobleman retired from the council, and soon
after died of vexation and disappointment. The other
counsellors, who had concurred in bringing about the
revolution, received their reward by promotions and new
honours. Russel was created earl of Bedford: The
marquis of Northampton obtained the office of great
chamberlain; and lord Wentworth, besides the office of
chamberlain of the houshold, got two large manors,
Stepney and Hackney, which were torne from the see
of London<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 85. Rymer, tom. xv. p. 226.</NOTE>. A council of regency was formed, not
that which Henry's will had appointed for the govern∣ment
of the kingdom, and which, being founded on an
act of Parliament, was the only legal one; but composed
chiefly of members who had formerly been appointed by
Somerset, and who derived their seats from an authority
which was now declared usurped and illegal. But such
niceties were, during that age, little understood, and
still less regarded, in England.</P>
<P>A SESSION of Parliament was held;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th No∣vember. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and as it was
the usual maxim of that assembly to acquiesce in every
administration which was established, the council dreaded
no opposition from that quarter, and had reason rather to
look for a corroboration of their authority.<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d De∣cember.</NOTE> Somerset
had been prevailed with to confess, on his knees, before
the council, all the articles of charge against him; and
he imputed these misdemeanors to his own rashness, folly,
and indiscretion, not to any malignity of his intentions<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 84. Hayward, p. 309. Stowe, p. 603.</NOTE>.
He even subscribed this confession; and the paper was
given in to the Parliament, who, after sending a com∣mittee
to examine him, and hear him acknowlege it to
<PB N="366" REF="394"/>
be authentic, passed a vote, by which they deprived him
of all his offices, and fined him in two thousand pounds
a year of land. Lord St. John was created treasurer in
his place, and Warwic earl marshal. The prosecution
against him was carried no farther. His fine was re∣mitted
by the King: He recovered his liberty: And
Warwic, thinking that he was now sufficiently humbled,
and that his authority was much lessened by his late tame
and abject behaviour, re-admitted him into the council,
and even agreed to an alliance between their families, by
the marriage of his son, lord Dudley, with the lady Jane
Seymour, daughter to Somerset<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 309.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING this session a severe act was passed against
riots<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">3 &amp; 4. Edw. VI. c. 5.</NOTE>; that if any, to the number of twelve persons,
should meet together for any matter of state, and being
required by any lawful magistrate, should not disperse
themselves, it should be treason; and if any broke
hedges, or violently pulled up pales about inclosures,
without lawful authority, it should be felony: Any at∣tempt
to kill a privy counsellor, was subjected to the
same penalty. The bishops had made an application,
complaining, that they were deprived of all their power,
by the encroachments of the civil courts, and the present
suspension of the canon law; that they could summon
no offenders before them, punish no vice, nor exert the
discipline of the church: From which diminution of
their authority, they pretended, immorality had every
where received great encouragement and encrease. The
design of some was, to revive the penitentiary rules of
the primitive church: But others thought, that such an
authority committed to the bishops, would prove more
oppressive than confession, penance, and all the clerical
inventions of the ancient superstition. The Parliament,
<PB N="367" REF="395"/>
for the present, contented themselves with empowering
the King to appoint thirty-two commissioners to frame a
body of canon laws, which were to be valid though ne∣ver
ratified by Parliament. Such implicit trust did they
repose in the crown, though all their liberties and pro∣perties
might be affected by these canons<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">3 &amp; 4 Edw. VI. c. 2.</NOTE>. The King
died before the canons received the royal sanction. Sir
John Sharington, whose crimes and malversations had
appeared so egregious at the condemnation of lord Sey∣mour,
obtained from Parliament a reversal of his attain∣der<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid, c. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. This man sought favour with the most zealous of
the reformers; and bishop Latimer asserted, that though
formerly he was a most notorious knave, he was now so
penitent, that he had become a very honest man.</P>
<P>WHEN Warwic and the council of regency began to
exercise their power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1550.</NOTE> they found themselves involved in
the same difficulties which had embarrassed the protector.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France and Scotland.</NOTE>
The wars with France and Scotland could not be sup∣ported
by an exhausted exchequer, seemed dangerous to a
divided nation, and were now acknowleged not to have
any object, which even the greatest and most uninter∣rupted
success could attain. The project of peace which
Somerset entertained, had served them as a pretence of
clamour against his administration; yet after sending Sir
Thomas Cheney to the emperor, and making again a
fruitless effort to engage him in the protection of Bou∣logne,
they found themselves obliged to listen to the ad∣vances
which Henry made them, by means of Guidotti,
a Florentine merchant. The earl of Bedford, Sir John
Mason, Paget, and Petre, were sent over to Boulogne,
with full powers to negociate. The French King abso∣lutely
refused to pay the two millions of crowns which
his predecessor had acknowledged to be due to the crown
<PB N="368" REF="396"/>
of England, as arrears of pensions; and said, that he
never would consent to render himself tributary to any
prince: But he offered a sum for the immediate restitu∣tion
of Boulogne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boulogne surrendered</NOTE> and four hundred thousand crowns
were at last agreed on, one half to be paid immediately,
the other in August following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 March.</NOTE> Six hostages were given
for the performance of this article. Scotland was com∣prehended
in the treaty: The English stipulated to restore
Lauder and Dunglas, and to demolish the fortresses of
Roxburgh and Eymouth<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 148. Hayward, 310, 311, 312. Rymer, vol. xv. p. 211.</NOTE>. No sooner was peace con∣cluded
with France, than a project was entertained of a
close union with that kingdom; and Henry very wil∣lingly
embraced a proposal so suitable both to his interests
and inclinations. An agreement, sometime after, was
formed for a marriage between Edward and Elizabeth,
a daughter of France; and all the articles were, after a
little negociation, fully settled<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 318. Heylin, p. 104. Rymer, tom. xv. p. 293.</NOTE>: But this project never
took effect.</P>
<P>THE intentions of marrying the King to a daughter of
Henry, who was a violent persecutor of the protestants,
was no wise acceptable to that party in England: But in
all other respects, the council was very steady in promot∣ing
the reformation, and in enforcing the laws against the
Romanists. Many of the prelates were still addicted to
that communion; and though they made some compli∣ances,
in order to save their bishoprics, they retarded, as
much as they safely could, the execution of the new laws,
and gave countenance to such as were negligent or refrac∣tory.
A resolution was therefore taken to seek pretences
for depriving them; and the execution of this intention
was the more easy, as they had all of them been obliged
<PB N="369" REF="397"/>
to take commissions, in which it was declared, that they
held their sees only during the King's pleasure. It was
thought proper to begin with Gardiner, in order to strike
a terror into the rest. The method of proceeding against
him was extremely violent, and had scarce any colour of
law or justice. It had been prescribed him, to inculcate
in a sermon, the duty of obedience to a King even du∣ring
his minority; and because he had neglected this
topic, he had been thrown into prison, and had been
there detained during two years, without being accused
of any crime, except disobedience to this arbitrary com∣mand.
The duke of Somerset, secretary Petre, and some
others of the council, were now sent, in order to try his
temper, and endeavour to find some ground for depriving
him: He professed to them his intention of conforming
to the government, of supporting the King's laws, and
of officiating by the new liturgy. This was not the
dispostion which they expected or desired<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 99.</NOTE>: A new de∣putation
was therefore sent, who carried him several ar∣ticles
to subscribe. He was to acknowledge his former
misbehaviour, and confess the justice of his con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inement:
He was likewise to own, that the King was supreme head
of the church; that the power of making and dispensing
with holidays, was part of the prerogative; that
the common-prayer book was a godly and commendable form;
that the King was a compleat sovereign in his minority;
that the act of the six articles was justly repealed; and
that the King had full authority to correct and reform
what was amiss in ecclesiastical discipline, government,
or doctrine. The bishop was willing to put his hand to
all the articles except the first: He maintained his con∣duct
to have been inoffensive; and declared, that he
<PB N="370" REF="398"/>
would not own himself guilty of faults which he had, never
committed<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 305. from the council books. Heylin, p. 99.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE council, finding that he had gone such lengths,
were determined to prevent his full compliance, by mul∣tiplying
the difficulties upon him, and sending him new
articles to subscribe. A list was selected of such points
as they thought would be the most hard of digestion;
and not content with these, they insisted still on his sub∣mission,
and an acknowlegement of past errors. To
make this subscription more mortifying, they required
a promise, that he would recommend and publish all these
articles from the pulpit: But Gardiner, who saw, that
they intended either to ruin or dishonour him, or perhaps
both, determined not to gratify his enemies by any farther
compliances; He still insisted on his innocence; desired
a fair trial; and refused to subscribe more articles, till he
should recover his liberty. For this pretended offence his
bishopric was put under sequestration for three months;
and as he then appeared no more compliant than at first,
a commission was appointed to try, or, more properly
speaking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1551.</NOTE> to condemn him. The commissions were, the
primate, the bishops of London, Ely, and Lincoln, secre∣tary
Petre, Sir James Hales, and some other lawyers.
Gardiner objected to the legality of the commission,
which was not founded on any statute or precedent; and
he appealed from the commissioners to the King. His
appeal was not regarded: Sentence was pronounced
against him: He was deprived of his bishopric: And
committed to close custody: His books and papers were
seized: all company was denied him; and it was not al∣lowed
him either to send or receive any letters or mes∣sages<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fox vol. ii. p. 734, &amp; seq. Burnet, Heylin, Collier.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="399"/>
GARDINER, as well as the other prelates, had agreed
to hold his office during the King's pleasure: But the
council, unwilling to make use of a concession which
had been so illegally and arbitrarily exacted, chose rather
to employ some forms of justice; a resolutton, which
led them, to commit still greater iniquities and severities,
But the violence of the reformers did not stop there.
Day, bishop of Chichester, Heathe of Wotcester, and
Voisey of Exeter, were deprived of their bishoprics, on
pretence of disobedience. Even Kitchen of Landaff,
Capon of Salisbury, and Samson of Coventry tho' they
had complied in every thing, yet not being supposed cor∣dial
or hearty in their obedience, were obliged to seek
protection, by sacrificing the most considerable revenues
of their fee to the rapacious courtiers<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Goodwin de praeful. Angl. Heylin, p. 100.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE plunderers neglected not even smaller profits.
An order was issued by council, for purging the library
of Westminster of all missals, legends and other super∣stitious
volumes, and delivering their garniture to Sir
Anthony Aucher<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 307, from the council books.</NOTE>. Many of these books were plaited
with gold and silver, and curiously embossed; and this
finery was probably the superstition that destroyed them.
Great havoc was likewise made on the libraries of Ox∣ford.
Books and manuscripts were destroyed without
distinction: The volumes of divinity suffered for their
rich binding: Those of literature were condemned as
useless: Those of geometry and astronomy were supposed
to contain nothing but necromancy<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Wood, hist. &amp; antiq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Oxon. lib. i. p. 271, 272.</NOTE>. The university
had not power to oppose these barbarous violences: They
were in danger of losing their own revenues; and expect∣ed
<PB N="372" REF="400"/>
every moment to be swallowed up by the earl of War∣wic
and his associates.</P>
<P>THO' every thing besides yielded to the authority of
the council, the lady Mary could never be brought to
compliance; and she still continued to adhere to the mass,
and to reject the new liturgy. Her behaviour was, dur∣ing
some time, connived at; but, at last, her two chap∣lains,
Mallet and Berkeley, were thrown into prison<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. ii. p. 249.</NOTE>;
and the princess was remonstrated with for her disobe∣dience.
The council wrote her a letter, by which they
endeavoured to make her change her sentiments, and to
persuade her, that her religious faith was very ill ground∣ed.
They asked her, what warrant there was in Scrip∣ture
for prayers in an unknown tongue, the use of images,
or offering up the sacrament for the dead; and they de∣sired
her to peruse St. Austin, and the other ancient doc∣tors,
who would convince her of the errors of the Ro∣mish
superstition, and prove that it was founded merely
on false miracles and lying stories<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. Collier, Burnet.</NOTE>. The lady Mary
remained obstinate against all this advice, and protested
herself willing to endure death rather than relinquish her
religion: She only feared, she said, that she was not
worthy to suffer in so holy a cause; And as for protestant
books, she thanked God, that, as she never had, so she
hoped never to read any of them. Dreading farther vio∣lence,
she endeavoured to make her escape to her kins∣man
Charles; but her design was discovered and preven∣ted<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Heyward, p. 315.</NOTE>. The emperor remonstrated in her behalf, and even
threatned hostilities, if liberty of conscience was refused
her: But though the council, sensible that the kingdom
was in no condition to support, with honour, such a war,
was desirous to comply; they found great difficulty to
<PB N="373" REF="401"/>
overcome the scruples of the young King. He had been
educated in such a violent abhorrence of the mass, and
other popish rites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1551.</NOTE> which he regarded as impious and
idolatrous, that he should participate, he thought, in the
sin, if he allowed its commission: And when at last the
importunity of Cranmer, Ridley, and Poinet, prevailed
somewhat over his opposition, he burst into tears, lament∣ing
his sister's obstinacy, and bewailing his own fate, that he
must suffer her to continue in such an abominable
mode of worship.</P>
<P>THE great object, at this time, of antipathy among
the protestant sects, was popery, or, more properly speak∣ing,
the papists. These they regarded as the common
enemy, who threatened every moment to overwhelm the
evangelical faith, and destroy its partizans by fire and
sword; They had not as yet had leisure to attend to the
other minute divisions among themselves, which after∣wards
became the objects of such furious quarrels and
animosities, and threw the whole kingdom into confu∣sion.
Several Lutheran divines, who had reputation in
those days, Bucer, Peter Martyr, and others, were in∣duced
to take shelter in England, from the persecutions
which the emperor exercised in Germany; and they
received protection and encouragement. John A-lasco,
a Polish nobleman, being expelled his country by the
rigours of the catholics, settled, during some time, at
Embden in East-Friezland, where he became preacher to
a congregation of the reformed. Foreseeing the perse∣cutions
which ensued, he removed to England, and
brought his congregation along with him. The council,
who regarded them as industrious, useful people, and de∣sired
to invite over others of the same character, not only
gave them Augustine friars church for the exercise of
their religion, but granted them a charter, by which they
<PB N="374" REF="402"/>
were erected into a corporation, consisting of a super∣intendant
and four assisting ministers. This ecclesiastical
establishment was quite independant of the church of
England, and differed from it in some rites and cere∣monies<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cran. p. 234.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE differences among the protestants were matter
of triumph to the catholics, who insisted, that the mo∣ment
men departed from the authority of the church,
they lost all criterion of truth and falshood in matters of
religion, and must be carried away by every wind of
doctrine. The continual variations of every fect of pro∣testants,
afforded them the same topic of reasoning. The
book of common prayer suffered in England a new revi∣sal,
and some rites and ceremonies, which had given of∣fence,
were omitted<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cran. p. 289.</NOTE>. The speculative doctrines, or the
metaphysics of the religion, were also fixed in forty-two
articles. These articles were intended to obviate further
divisions and variations; and the framing them had been
postponed till the establishment of the liturgy, which
was regarded as a more material object to the people.
The eternity of hell torments is asserted in the articles;
and care is also taken to inculcate, not only that no hea∣then,
however virtuous, can escape an endless state of the
most exquisite misery, but also that every one who pre∣sumes
to maintain, that any pagan can possibly be
saved, is himself exposed to the penalty of eternal perdi∣tion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Article xviii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE theological zeal of the council, tho' seemingly
fervent, went not so far as to make them neglect their
own temporal concerns, which seem to have been ever
uppermost in their thoughts: They even found leisure to
attend to the public interest; nay, to the commerce of the
<PB N="375" REF="403"/>
nation, which was, at that time, very little the object of
general study or attention. The trade of England had
anciently been carried on altogether by foreigners, chiefly
the inhabitants of the Hanse-towns, or Easterlings, as
they were called; and in order to encourage these merch∣ants
to settle in England, they had been erected into a
corporation by Henry the third, had obtained a patent,
were endowed with privileges, and were exempted from
several heavy duties paid by aliens. So ignorant were the
English of commerce, that this company, commonly de∣nominated
the merchants of the Steel-yard, engrossed
almost the whole foreign trade of the kingdom; and as
they naturally employed the shipping of their own coun∣try,
the navigation of England was also in a very lan∣guishing
condition. It was therefore thought proper by
the council to find pretences for annulling the privileges
of this corporation, privileges which put them nearly on
an equal footing with Englishmen in the duties which they
paid; and as such patents were, during that age, granted
by the absolute power of the King, men were the less
surprized to find them recalled by the same authority.
Several remonstrances were made against this innovation,
by Lubec, Hamburgh, and other Hanse-towns; but the
council persevered in their resolution, and the good ef∣fects
of it became soon visible to the nation. The Eng∣lish
merchants, by their very situation as natives, had
advantages above foreigners in the purchase of cloth,
wool, and other commodities; though these advantages
had not been sufficient to rouze their industry, or engage
them to become rivals to this opulent company: But
when aliens duty was also imposed upon all foreigners in∣discriminately, the English were tempted to enter into
commerce, and a spirit of industry began to appear in
the kingdom<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 326. Heylin, p. 108. Strype's Mem. vol. ii. p. 295.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="404"/>
ABOUT the same time a treaty was made with Gusta∣vus
Ericson, King of Sweden, by which it was stipulat∣ed,
that if he sent bullion into England, he might carry
away English commodities without paying custom, that
he should carry bullion to no other prince, that if he sent
ozimus, steel, copper, &amp;c. he should pay custom for
English commodities as an Englishman, and that if he
sent other merchandize, he should have free intercourse,
paying custom as a stranger<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 109.</NOTE>. The bullion sent over by
Sweden set the mint to work: Good specie was coined:
And much of the base metal, formerly issued, was re∣called:
A circumstance which tended extremely to the
encouragement of commerce.</P>
<P>BUT all these schemes for the improvement of industry
were like to prove abortive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warwic created duke of North∣umberland.</NOTE> by the fear of domestic con∣vulsions,
arising from the exorbitant ambition of Warwic.
That nobleman, not contented with the station which he
had attained, carried farther his pretensions, and had
gained to himself partizans who were disposed to second
him in every enterprize. The last earl of Northumber∣land
died without issue; and as Sir Thomas Piercy, his
brother, had been attainted on account of the share which
he had in the Yorkshire insurrection during the late reign,
the title was at present extinct, and the estate was vested in
the crown. Warwic now procured to himself a grant
of those ample possessions, which lay chiefly in the North,
the most warlike part of the kingdom; and he was dig∣nified
with the title of duke of Northumberland. His
friend, Paulet, lord St. John, the treasurer, was created
first earl of Wiltshire, then marquis of Winchester: Sir
William Herbert was made earl of Pembroke.</P>
<P>BUT the ambition of Northumberland made him re∣gard<NOTE PLACE="marg">His ambi∣tion.</NOTE>
all increase of possessions and titles, either to himself
<PB N="377" REF="405"/>
or partizans, as steps only to further acquisitions. Find∣ing
that Somerset, though degraded from his dignity,
and even lessened in the public opinion by his spiritless
conduct, still enjoyed a considerable share of popularity,
he determined to ruin a man whom he regarded as the
chief obstacle to the attainment of his hopes. The al∣liance
which had been formed between the families had
produced no cordial union, and only enabled Northum∣berland
to compass with more certainty the destruction of
his rival. He secretly gained many of the friends and
servants of that unhappy nobleman: He sometimes ter∣rified
him by the appearance of danger: Sometimes pro∣voked
him by ill usage. The unguarded Somerset often
broke out into menacing expressions against Northum∣berland:
At other times, he formed rash projects, which
he immediately abandoned: His treacherous confidents
carried to his enemy every passionate word which dropped
from him: They revealed the schemes, which they them∣selves
had first suggested<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 112.</NOTE>: And Northumberland, think∣ing
that the proper season was now come, began to act
in an open manner against him.</P>
<P>In one night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 October.</NOTE> the duke of Somerset, the lord Grey,
David and John Seymour, Hammond and Neudigate,
two of the duke's servants, Sir Ralph Vane and Sir
Thomas Palmer were arrested and committed to custody.
Next day, the dutchess of Somerset, with her favourites,
Crane and his wife, Sir Miles Partridge, Sir Michael
Stanhope, Bannister, and others were thrown into prison.
Sir Thomas Palmer, who had all along acted the part
of a spy upon Somerset, accused him of having formed a
design to raise an insurrection in the north, to attack the
gens d'armes on a muster-day, to secure the Tower, and
to excite a rebellion in London: But what was the only
<PB N="378" REF="406"/>
probable accusation, he asserted, that Somerset had once
laid a project for murdering Northumberland, North∣ampton,
and Pembroke at a banquet, which was to be
given them by lord Paget. Crane and his wife confirm∣ed
Palmer's testimony with regard to this last design;
and it appears that some rash scheme of that nature had
been mentioned; though no regular conspiracy had been
formed, nor means prepared for its execution. Ham∣mond
confessed, that the duke had armed men to guard
him one night in his house at Greenwich.</P>
<P>SOMERSET was brought to his trial before the marquis<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Somerset.</NOTE>
of Winchester, who acted as high steward. Twenty∣seven
peers sat as the jury, among whom were Northum∣berland,
Pembroke, and Northampton, whom decency
should have hindered from acting as judges in the trial
of a man, who appeared to be their capital enemy.
Somerset was accused of high treason on account of the
projected insurrections, and of felony in forming a design
to murder privy-counsellors.</P>
<P>WE have a very imperfect account of all state trials
during that age, which is a sensible defect in our his∣tory:
But it appears, that some more regularity was ob∣served
in the management of this prosecution than had
been usually employed in like cases. The witnesses
were at least examined by the privy-council; and though
they were neither produced in court, nor confronted with
the prisoner (circumstances required by the strict prin∣ciples<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st December.</NOTE>
of equity) their depositions were given in to the
jury. The proof seems to have been very lame with re∣gard
to the treasonable part of the charge; and Somerset's
defence was so satisfactory, that the peers gave verdict in
his favour: The intention alone of assaulting the privy
counsellors was supported by any tolerable evidence; and
the jury brought him in guilty of felony. The prisoner
<PB N="379" REF="407"/>
himself confessed, that he had mentioned the design of
murdering Northumberland and the other lords; but
had not formed any resolution on that head: And when he
received sentence, he asked pardon of those peers for the
designs which he had hearkened to against them. The
people, by whom Somerset was beloved, hearing the first
part of his sentence, by which he was absolved from
treason, expressed their joy by loud acclamations: But
their satisfaction was suddenly damped, on finding that
he was condemned to death for felony<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heyward, p. 320, 321, 322. Stow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 606. Hollingshed, p. 1067.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CARE had been taken by Northumberland's emissaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1552.</NOTE>
to prepossess the young King against his uncle; and lest
he should relent, no access was given to any of Somer∣set's
friends, and the prince was kept from reflection by
a continued series of occupations and amusements.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His execu∣tion. 22d Jan.</NOTE> At
last the prisoner was brought to the scaffold on Tower∣hill,
amidst great crouds of spectators, who bore him such
sincere kindness, that they entertained, to the last mo∣ment,
the fond hopes of his pardon<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 324, 325.</NOTE>. Many of them
rushed in to dip their handkerchiefs in his blood, which
they long preserved as a precious relique; and some of
them soon after, when Northumberland met with a like
doom, upbraided him with this cruelty, and displayed to
him these symbols of his crime. Somerset indeed, tho'
many actions of his life were very exceptionable, seems,
in general, to have merited a better fate; and the faults,
which he committed, were owing to weakness, not to
any bad intentions. His virtues were better calculated
for private than for public life; and by his want of pene∣tration
and firmness, he was ill-fitted to extricate himself
from those cabals and violences to which that age was
so much addicted. Sir Thomas Arundel, Sir Michael
<PB N="380" REF="408"/>
Stanhope, Sir Miles Partridge, and Sir Ralph Vane, all
of them Somerset's friends, were brought to their trial,
condemned and executed: Great injustice seems to have
been used in their prosecution. Lord Paget, chancellor
of the dutchy, was, on some pretence, tried in the Star∣chamber,
and condemned in a fine of 6000 pounds, with
the loss of his office. To mortify him the more, he was
degraded from the order of the garter; as unworthy, on
account of his mean birth, to share that honour<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 608.</NOTE>. Lord
Rich, chancellor, was also compelled to resign his office,
on the discovery of some friendship, which he had shewn
to Somerset.</P>
<P>THE day after the execution of Somerset,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Jan. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> a session of
Parliament was held, where farther advances were made
for the establishment of the reformation. The new li∣turgy
was authorised; and penalties were enacted against
all such as absented themselves from public worship<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI. c. 1.</NOTE>.
To use the mass had already been prohibited under very
severe penalties; so that the reformers, it appears, what∣ever
scope thay had given to their own private judgment,
in disputing the tenets of the antient religion, were re∣solved
not to allow the same privilege to others; and
the practice, nay the very doctrine of toleration, was, at
that time, equally unknown to all sects and parties. To
dissent from the religion of the magistrate was universally
conceived to be as criminal as to question his title, or re∣bel
against his authority.</P>
<P>A LAW was enacted against usury; that is, against
taking any interest for money<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ib. c. 20.</NOTE>. This act was the effect
of antient superstitions; but being found extremely ini∣quitous
in itself, as well as prejudicial to commerce, it
was afterwards repealed in the twelfth of Elizabeth.
<PB N="381" REF="409"/>
The common rate of interest, notwithstanding the law,
was at that time 14 per cent<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 318.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A BILL was introduced by the ministry into the house of
lords, renewing those rigorous statutes of treasons, which
had been abrogated in the beginning of this reign; and
though the peers, by their high station, stood most ex∣posed
to these tempests of state, yet had they so little
regard to public security, or even to their own true in∣terests,
that they passed the bill with only one dissenting
voice<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary hist. vol. iii. p. 258. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 190. 5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI. cap. 2.</NOTE>. But the commons rejected it, and prepared a
new bill, that passed into a law, by which it was enact∣ed,
that whoever should call the King or any of his heirs,
named in the statute of the 35th of the last reign, heretic,
schismatic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper of the crown, should
forfeit, for the first offence, their goods and chattels, and
be imprisoned during pleasure; for the second, should
incur a <HI>praemunire;</HI> for the third, should be attainted of
treason. But if any should unadvisedly advance such a
slander in writing, printing, painting, carving or grav∣ing,
he was, for the first offence, to be held a traitor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.
It may be worthy of notice, that the King and his next
heir, the lady Mary, were professedly of different reli∣gions;
and religions, which threw on each other the
imputation of heresy, schism, idolatry, prophaneness,
blasphemy, wickedness, and all the opprobrious epithets,
that religious zeal has invented. It was almost impos∣sible,
therefore, for the people, if they spoke on these
subjects at all, not to fall into the crime, so severely pu∣nished
by this statute; and the jealousy of the commons
for liberty, though it led them to dissent from the lords,
appears not to have been very active, vigilant, or clear∣sighted.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="410"/>
THE commons annexed to this bill a clause which was
of much more importance than the bill itself, that no
one should be convicted of any kind of treason, unless
the crime was proved by the oaths of two witnesses, who
were confronted with the prisoner. The lords scrupled to
pass this clause; though required by the most obvious
principles of equity, and though their own interest was
fully as much concerned as that of the commons. But
the members of that house trusted for protection to their
present personal interest and power, and neglected the
noblest and most permanent security, that of the laws.</P>
<P>A BILL was introduced into the house of peers for
making a provision for the poor; but the commons, not
chusing that a money-bill should begin in the upper∣house,
framed a new bill to the same purpose. By this
bill, the churchwardens were empowered to collect cha∣ritable
contributions for the poor, and if any refused to
contribute, or disswaded others from that charity, the
bishop of the diocese was impowered to proceed against
them. Such large discretionary powers, entrusted to the
prelates, seem as proper an object of jealousy as the au∣thority
assumed by the peers<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI. cap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was another occasion in which the Parliament
reposed an unusual confidence in the bishops. They
empowered them to proceed against such as neglected
the Sundays and holydays<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 3.</NOTE>. But these were unguarded
concessions granted to the church: The general humour
of the times led men to bereave the ecclesiastics of all
their power, and even to pillage them of all their pro∣perty:
Many clergymen were obliged for a subsistence
to turn carpenters or taylors, and some kept alehouses<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 202.</NOTE>.
The bishops themselves were generally reduced to po∣verty,
<PB N="383" REF="411"/>
and held both their revenues and spiritual office
by a very precarious and uncertain tenure.</P>
<P>TONSTAL, bishop of Durham, was one of the most
eminent prelates of that age, still less for the dignity of
his see, than for his own personal merit, his learning,
moderation, humanity, and beneficence. He had oppos∣ed,
by his vote and authority, all the innovations in
religion; but so soon as they were enacted, he had always
submitted, and had paid conformity to each system of
religion, which was established. His known probity had
made this compliance be ascribed, not to an interested or
time-serving spirit, but to a sense of duty, which led
him to think that all private opinions ought to be sacrifi∣ced
to the great concerns of public peace and tranquillity.
That general regard which was paid his character, had
preserved him from any severe treatment during the pro∣tectorship
of Somerset; but when Northumberland gained
the ascendant, he was thrown into prison; and as that
rapacious nobleman had laid a design of appropriating
the revenues of the see of Durham, and of forming to
himself a principality in the northern counties, he was
resolved, in order to effectuate his purpose, to deprive
Tonstal of his bishopric. A bill of attainder, therefore,
on pretence of misprision of treason, was introduced into
the house of peers against that prelate; and it passed with
the opposition only of lord Stourton, a zealous catholic,
and of Cranmer, who always bore a cordial and sincere
friendship to the bishop of Durham. But when the bill
was sent down to the commons, they required that wit∣nesses
should be examined, that Tonstal should be al∣lowed
to defend himself, and that he should be confronted
with his accusers: And when these demands were refused,
they rejected the bill.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="412"/>
THIS equity, so unusual in the Parliament during that
age, was ascribed by Northumberland and his partizans,
not to any regard for liberty and justice, but to the pre∣valence
of Somerset's faction in a house of commons,
which, being chosen during the administration of that
nobleman, had been almost entirely filled with his crea∣tures.
They were confirmed in this opinion, when
they found, that a bill ratifying the attainder of Somerset
and his accomplices was also rejected by the commons,
though it had passed the upper house.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th April.</NOTE> A resolution was
therefore taken to dissolve the Parliament, which had sat during this whole reign; and soon after to summon a new
one.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Par∣liament.</NOTE> in order to ensure to himself a
house of commons entirely obsequious to his will, ventured
on an expedient which could not have been practised, or
even thought of, in an age, when there was any idea or
comprehension of liberty. He engaged the King to
write circular letters to all the sheriffs, in which he en∣joined
them to inform the freeholders and voters, that
they were required to choose men of knowledge and ex∣perience
for their representatives. After this general ex∣hortation,
the King continued in these words. “And
yet, nevertheless, our pleasure is, that where our privy
council, or any of them shall, in our behalf, recom∣mend,
within their jurisdiction, men of learning and
wisdom; in such cases, their directions shall be regarded
and followed, as tending to the same end which we
desire, that is, to have this assembly composed of the
persons in our realm the best fitted to give advice and
good council<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Strype's ecclesiastical memorials, vol. ii. p. 394.</NOTE>.” Several letters were sent from the
King, recommending members to particular counties,
Sir Richard Cotton for Hampshire; Sir William Fitz∣williams
<PB N="385" REF="413"/>
and Sir Henry Neville for Berkshire; Sir Wil∣liam
Drury and Sir Henry Benningfield for Suffolk, &amp;c.
But tho' some counties only received this species of <HI>congé
d'elire</HI> form the King; the recommendations from the privy
council and the counsellors, we may fairly presume,
would extend to the greatest part, if not to the whole, of
the kingdom.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that this attempt was made during
the reign of a minor King, when the royal authority is
usually weakest; that it was patiently submitted to;
and that it gave so little umbrage as scarce to be taken notice
of by any historian. The painful and laborious collector
above-cited, who never omits the most trivial matters, is
the only person, that has thought this memorable letter
worthy of being transmitted to posterity.</P>
<P>THE Parliament answered Northumberland's expec∣tations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1553.</NOTE>
As Tonstal had in the interval been deprived<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st March.</NOTE>
of his bishopric after a very arbitrary manner, by the
sentence of lay commissioners, appointed to try him, the
see of Durham was by act of Parliament divided into two
bishoprics, which had certain portions of the revenue as∣signed
them. The regalities of the see, which included
the jurisdiction of a count palatine, were given by the
King to Northumberland; and it was not to be doubted
but that nobleman had also proposed to make rich plunder
of the revenue, as was then the usual practice of the
courtiers, whenever a bishopric became vacant.</P>
<P>THE commons gave the ministry another mark of at∣tachment,
which was at that time the most sincere, the
most cordial, and the most difficult to be obtained: They
granted a supply of two subsidies and two fifteenths. To
render this present the more acceptable, they voted a
preamble, containing a long accusation of Somerset,
<PB N="386" REF="414"/>
“For involving the King in wars, wasting his treasure,
engaging him in much debt, embasing the coin, and
giving occasion for a most terrible rebellion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">7 Edw. VI. cap. 12.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE debts of the crown were at this time very con∣siderable.
The King had received from France 400,000
crowns on delivering Boulogne; he had reaped profits
from the sale of some chantry lands; the churches had
been despoiled of all their plate and rich ornaments,
which, by a decree of council, without any pretence of
law or equity, had been converted to the King's use<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 95, 132.</NOTE>:
Yet such had been the rapacity of the courtiers, that the
Crown owed about 300,000 pounds<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Strype's Ecclesiastical Memoirs, vol. ii. p. 344.</NOTE>; and great dilapi∣dations
were, at the same time, made of the royal de∣mesnes.
The young prince showed, among other virtues,
a disposition to frugality, which, had he lived, would
soon have retrieved these losses: But as his health was
declining very fast, the present emptiness of the exche∣quer
was a sensible obstacle to the execution of those
projects, which the ambition of Northumberland had
founded on the prospect of Edward's approaching end.</P>
<P>THAT nobleman represented to the prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Succession changed.</NOTE> whom
youth and an infirm state of health made susceptible of
every impression, that his two sisters, Mary and Elizabeth,
had both been declared illegitimate by act of Parliament,
and though Henry by his will had restored them to a place
in the succession, the nation would never bear to see the
throne of England filled by a bastard: That they were
only the King's sisters by the half-blood; and even if they
were legitimate, could not enjoy the crown as his heirs
and successors: That the Queen of Scots stood excluded
by the King's will; and being an alien, lost by the law
all right of inheriting; not to mention, that, as she was
<PB N="387" REF="415"/>
betrothed to the dauphin, she would, by her succession,
render England, as she had already done Scotland, a pro∣vince
to France: That the certain consequence of his
sister Mary's succession, or that of the Queen of Scots,
was the abolition of the protestant religion, the repeal of
those laws enacted in favour of the reformation, and the
re-establishment of the usurpations and idolatry of the
church of Rome: That fortunately for England, the
same order of succession, which justice required, was also
the most conformable to public interest; and there was
not on any side any just ground for doubt or deliberation:
That when these three princesses were excluded by such
solid reasons, the succession devolved to the marchioness
of Dorset, eldest daughter to the French Queen and the
duke of Suffolk: That the next heir of the marchioness
was the lady Jane Gray, a lady of the most amiable virtue,
accomplished by the best education, both in literature and
religion; and every way worthy of a throne: And that
even, if her title by blood should be doubtful, which
there was no just reason to pretend, the King was pos∣sessed
of the same power, which his father enjoyed; and
might leave her the crown by letters patent. These
reasonings made impression on the young prince; and
above all, his zealous affection for the protestant religion
made him apprehend the consequences, if so bigotted a
catholic as his sister Mary should succeed to the throne.
And though he bore a tender affection to the lady Eliza∣beth,
who was liable to no such objection, means were
found to persuade him, that he could not exclude the
one sister, on account of illegitimacy, without also giv∣ing
an exclusion to the other.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, finding that his arguments were
likely to operate on the King, began to prepare the
<PB N="388" REF="416"/>
other parts of that political fabric, which he intended
to raise. Two sons of the duke of Suffolk by a
second venter having died, this season, of the sweat∣ing
sickness, that title was extinct; and Northumberland
engaged the King to bestow it on the marquis of
Dorset. By means of this favour and of others,
which he conferred upon him, he persuaded the new duke
of Suffolk and the dutchess, to give their daughter, the
lady Jane, in marriage to his fourth son, the lord Guil∣ford
Dudley. In order to fortify himself by farther
alliances, he negotiated a marriage between the lady
Catherine Grey, second daughter to Suffolk, and lord
Herbert, eldest son to the earl of Pembroke. He also
married his own daughter to lord Hastings, eldest son to
the earl of Huntingdon<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 109. Stowe, p. 609.</NOTE>. These marriages were solem∣nized
with great pomp and festivity; and the people,
who hated Northumberland, could not forbear expressing
their indignation at seeing these public demonstrations
of joy, during the languishing state of the young prince's
health.</P>
<P>EDWARD had been seized in the foregoing year, first
with the measles, then with the small pox; but having
perfectly recovered from both these distempers, the na∣tion
entertained hopes, that they would only serve to
confirm his health; and he had afterwards made a pro∣gress
through some parts of the kingdom. It was sus∣pected,
that he had there over-heated himself in exercises:
He was seized with a cough, which proved obstinate,
and gave way neither to regimen nor medicines:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickness.</NOTE> Several
fetal symptoms of a consumption appeared; and though
it was hoped, that, as the season of the year advanced,
his youth and temperance might get the better of the
<PB N="389" REF="417"/>
Malady, men saw with great concern his bloom and vi∣gour
insensibly decay. The general attachment to the
young prince, joined to the hatred borne the Dudleys,
made it be remarked, that Edward had every moment de∣clined
in health, from the time that lord Robert Dudley
had been put about him, in the quality of gentleman of
the bedchamber.</P>
<P>THE languishing state of Edward's health made Nor∣thumberland
the more intent on the execution of his
project. He removed all, except his own emissaries,
from about the King: He himself attended him with the
greatest affiduity: He pretended the most anxious concern
for his health and welfare: And by all these artifices, he
prevailed on him to give his final consent to the settlement
projected. Sir Edward Montague, chief justice of the
Common Pleas, Sir John Baker and Sir Thomas Brom∣ley,
two judges, with the attorney and solicitor-general,
were sent for to the council; where, after the minutes
of the intended deed were read to them, the King re∣quired
them to draw them up in the form of letters pa∣tent.
They hesitated in obeying this order; and desired
time to consider of it. The more they reflected, the
greater danger they found in compliance. The settle∣ment
of the crown by Henry the eighth had been made
in consequence of an act of Parliament; and by another
act, passed in the beginning of this reign, it was declared
treason in any of the heirs, their aiders or abettors, to
attempt on the right of another, or change the order of
succession. The judges pleaded these reasons before the
council. They urged, that such a patent as was intended
would be entirely invalid; that it would subject, not only
the judges who drew it, but every counsellor who signed
<PB N="390" REF="418"/>
it, to the pains of treason; and that the only proper ex∣pedient,
both to give force to the new settlement, and
free its partizans from danger, was to summon a Parlia∣ment,
and obtain the consent and fanction of that as∣sembly.
The King said, that he intended afterwards to
follow that method, and would call a Parliament, in
which he proposed, to have his settlement ratified;
but in the mean time, he required the judges, on their al∣legiance,
to draw the patent in the form required. The
council told the judges, that their refusal would subject
them all to the pains of treason. Northumberland gave
to Montague the appellation of traitor; and said that he
would fight in his shirt with any man in so just a cause
as that of the lady Jane's succession. The judges were
reduced to great difficulties between the dangers of the
law, and those arising from the violence of present power
and authority<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fuller, book viii. p. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE arguments were canvassed in several different
meetings between the council and the judges; and no
solution could be found of the present difficulties. At
last, Montague proposed an expedient, which satisfied
both his brethren and the counsellors. He desired, that
a special commission should be passed by the King and
council, requiring the judges to draw a patent for the
new settlement of the crown; and that a pardon should
immediately after be granted them for any offence which
they might have incurred by their compliance. When the
patent was d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wn and brought to the bishop of Ely,
chancellor, in order to pass the great seal, that prelate
required, that all the judges should sign it. Gosnald at
first refused; and it was with much difficulty, that he was
prevailed on, by the violent menaces of Northumberland,
to comply; but the constancy of Sir James Hales, who,
<PB N="391" REF="419"/>
though a zealous protestant, preferred justice on this oc∣casion
to the prejudices of his party, could not be shaken
by any expedient. The chancellor next required, for his
greater security, that all the privy councellors should set
their hands to the patent: The intrigues of Northum∣berland
or the fears of his violence were so prevalent, that
the counsellors complied with this demand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st June.</NOTE> Cranmer
alone hesitated during some time, but yielded at last to
the earnest and pathetic entreaties of the King<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Cranm. Mem. p. 295.</NOTE>. Cecil,
at that time secretary of state, pretended afterwards that
he only signed as a witness to the King's subscription.
And thus, by the King's letters patent, the two prin∣cesses,
Mary and Elizabeth, were set aside; and the
crown was settled on the heirs of the dutchess of Suffolk:
For the dutchess herself was content to be postponed to
her daughters.</P>
<P>AFTER this settlement was made, with so many i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣auspicious
circumstances, Edward declined visibly every
day in his health; and small hopes were entertained of
his recovery. To make the matter worse, his physicians
were dismissed by Northumberland's advice and by an
order of council; and he was put into the hands of an
ignorant woman, who undertook, in a little time, to
restore him to his former state of health. After the use
of her medicines, all the bad symptoms encreased to the
most violent degree: He felt a difficulty of speech and
breathing; his pulse failed, his legs swelled, his colour
became livid; and many other symptoms appeared of his
approaching end. He expired at Greenwich in the six∣teenth
year of his age, and the seventh of his reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And death. 6th July.</NOTE></P>
<P>ALL the English historians dwell with pleasure on the
excellencies of this young prince; whom the flattering
promises of hope, joined to many real virtues, had made
an object of the most tender affections of the public.

<PB N="394" REF="420"/>
store his daughter to the right of succession, her title was
now become as legal and parliamentary as it was ever
esteemed just and natural. The public had been long fa∣miliarized
to these sentiments: During all the reign of
Edward, the princess was considered as his lawful suc∣cessor:
And though the protestants dreaded the effects of her
prejudices, the extreme hatred universally enter∣tained
against the Dudleys<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, lib. 25.</NOTE>, who, men foresaw, would,
under the name of Jane, be the real sovereigns, was
more than sufficient to counterbalance, even with that
party, the attachment to religion. This last attempt to
violate the order of succession, had displayed Northum∣berland's
ambition and injustice in a full light; and
when the people reflected on the long train of fraud, ini∣quity
and cruelty, by which that project had been con∣ducted;
that the lives of the two Seymours, as well as
the title of the princesses, had been sacrificed to it; they
were moved by indignation to exert themselves in oppo∣sition
to such criminal enterprizes. The general vene∣ration
also, paid to the memory of Henry the eighth,
prompted the nation to defend the rights of his posterity;
and the miseries of the antient civil wars were not so en∣tirely
forgotten, that men were willing, by a departure
from the lawful heir, to incur the danger of like blood∣shed
and confusion.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, sensible of the opposition which
he must expect, had carefully concealed the destination
made by the King; and in order to bring the two
princesses into his power, he had had the precaution to
engage the council, before Edward's death, to write
to them in that prince's name, desiring their attendance,
on pretence that his infirm state of health required the as∣sistance
of their counsel and the consolation of their com∣pany<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 154.</NOTE>.
<PB N="395" REF="421"/>
Edward expired before their arrival; but Nor∣thumberland,
in order to make the princesses fall into the
snare, kept the King's death still secret; and the lady
Mary had already reached Hoddesden, within half
a day's journey of the court. Happily, the earl of Arun∣del
sent her private intelligence, both of her brother's
death and of the conspiracy formed against her<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 233.</NOTE>: She
immediately made haste to retire; and arrived by quick
journeys, first at Kenning-hall in Norfolk, then at
Framlingham in Suffolk; where she proposed to embark
and retire to Flanders, in case she should find it impossi∣ble
to defend her right of succession. She wrote letters
to the nobility and most considerable gentry in every
county of England; commanding them to assist her in
the defence of her crown and person. And she dispatch∣ed
a message to the council; by which she notified to
them, that her brother's death was no longer a secret to
her, promised them pardon for past offences, and re∣quired
them immediately to give orders for proclaiming
her accession in London<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND found that farther dissimulation
was fruitless: He went to Sion-house<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. xiii. c. 2.</NOTE>, accompanied
with the duke of Suffolk, the earl of Pembroke, and
others of the nobility; and he approached the lady Jane,
who resided there, with all the respect usually paid to the
sovereign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane Gray pro∣claimed Queen.</NOTE> Jane was, in a great measure, ignorant of
all these transactions; and it was with equal grief and
surprize, that she received intelligence of them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Godwin in Kennet, p. 329. Heylin, p. 149. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 234.</NOTE>. She
was a lady of the most amiable person, the most engaging
disposition, the most accomplished parts; and being of
an equal age with the late King, she had received all
her education with him, and seemed even to possess a
<PB N="396" REF="422"/>
greater facility in acquiring every part of manly and po∣lite
literature. She had attained a knowledge of the Ro∣man
and Greek languages, beside modern tongues; had
passed most of her time in an application to learning;
and expressed a great indifference for other occupations
and amusements usual with her sex and station. Roger
Ascham, tutor to the lady Elizabeth, having at one time
paid her a visit, found her employed in reading of Plato,
while the rest of the family were engaged in a party of
hunting in the park; and upon his admiring the singu∣larity
of her choice, she told him, that she received more
pleasure from that author than the others could reap from
all their sport and gaiety. Her heart, full of this passion
for literature and the elegant arts, and of tenderness to∣wards
her husband, who was deserving of her affection,
had never opened itself to the flattering allurements of
ambition; and the information of her advancement to
the throne was by no means agreeable to her. She even
refused to accept of the present; pleaded the preferable
right of the two princesses; expressed her dread of the
consequences attending an enterprize so dangerous, not
to say so criminal; and desired to remain in that private
station in which she was born. Overcome at last with
the entreaties, rather than reasons, of her father and fa∣ther-in-law,
and above all of her husband, she submitted
to their will, and was prevailed on to relinquish her own
judgment. It was then usual for the Kings of England,
after their accession, to pass the first days in the Tower;
and Northumberland immediately conveyed thither the new
sovereign<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 159.</NOTE>. All the counsellors were obliged to at∣tend
her to that fortress; and by this means became, in
some measure, prisoners in the hands of Northumber∣land,
whose will they were necessitated to obey. Orders
<PB N="397" REF="423"/>
were given by the council, to proclaim Jane throughout
the kingdom; but these orders were executed only in
London, and the neighbourhood. No applause ensued:
The people heard the proclamation with silence and con∣cern:
Some even expressed their scorn and contempt:
And one Pot, a vintner's prentice, was severely punish∣ed
for this offence<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 160.</NOTE>. The protestant teachers themselves,
who were employed to convince the people of Jane's
title, found their eloquence fruitless<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 330. Heylin, p. 162. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 236. 238.</NOTE>; and Ridley, bi∣shop
of London, who preached a sermon to that purpose,
wrought no effect upon his audience<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 611. Hollingshed, p. 1087. Strype's Mem. vol. iii. p. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE people of Suffolk, meanwhile, paid their at∣tendance
on Mary. As they were much attached to the
reformed communion, they could not forbear, amidst
their tenders of duty, to express their apprehension for
the protestant religion; but when she assured them, that
she never meant to change the laws of King Edward<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 15. Baker, p. 314. Speed, p. 816.</NOTE>,
they enlisted themselves in her cause with zeal and affec∣tion.
The nobility and gentry flocked to her daily, and
brought her reinforcement. The earls of Bath and Sus∣sex,
the eldest sons of lord Wharton and lord Mordaunt,
Sir William Drury, Sir Henry Benningfield, Henry Jer∣ningham,
persons whose interest lay in the neighbour∣hood,
appeared at the head of their tenants and re∣tainers<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 160. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 237.</NOTE>.
Sir Edward Hastings, brother of the earl of
Huntingdon, having received a commission from the
council to make levies for the lady Jane in Buckingham∣shire,
carried over his troops, which amounted to four
thousand men, and joined Queen Mary. Even a fleet,
which had been sent by Northumberland to lie off the
<PB N="398" REF="424"/>
coast of Suffolk, being forced into Yarmouth, by a storm,
were engaged to declare for that princess.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, who had hitherto been blinded
by ambition, saw at last the danger gather round him,
and knew not to what hand to turn himself. He had le∣vied
forces, which were assembled at London; but
dreading the cabals of the courtiers and counsellors,
whose compliance, he knew, had been entirely the result
of fear or artifice, he was resolved to keep near the per∣son
of the lady Jane, and send Suffolk to command the
army. But the counsellors, who wished to remove
him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 330. Heylin, p. 159. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 239. Fox, vol. iii. p. 15.</NOTE>, working on the filial tenderness of Jane, magni∣fied
to her the danger to which her father would be ex∣posed,
and represented, that Northumberland, who had
gained reputation by suppressing formerly a rebellion in
those parts, was much more proper to command in that
enterprize. The Duke himself, who knew the slender
capacity of Suffolk, began to think, that none but him∣self
was able to encounter the present danger; and he
agreed to take on him the command of the troops.
The counsellors attended on him at his departure with
the highest protestations of attachment, and none more
than Arundel, his mortal enemy<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 161. Baker, p. 315. Hol∣lingshed, p. 1086.</NOTE>. As he went along,
he remarked the disaffection of the people, which fore∣boded
a fatal issue to his ambitious hopes. “Many,”
said he to lord Grey, who attended him, “come out to
look at us, but I find not one who cries <HI>God speed.
you</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Speed, p. 816.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE duke had no sooner reached St. Edmond's-bury,
than he found his army, which never exceeded six thou∣sand
men, too weak to encounter the Queen's<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 331.</NOTE>, which
<PB N="399" REF="425"/>
amounted to double the number. He wrote to the coun∣cil,
desiring them to send him a reinforcement; and the
counsellors immediately laid hold of this pretence to free
themselves from their confinement.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane deserted by the people.</NOTE> They left the
Tower, as if they meant to execute Northumberland's
commands; but being assembled in Baynard's-castle, a
house belonging to Pembroke, they deliberated concern∣ing
the method of shaking off his usurped tyranny.
Arundel began the conference, by representing the in∣justice
and cruelty of Northumberland, the exorbitancy
of his ambition, the criminal enterprize which he had
projected, and the guilt in which he had involved the
whole council; and he asserted, that the only method
of making atonement for their past offences, was by a
prompt return to the duty which they owed their lawful
sovereign<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 331, 332. Thuanus, lib. xiii.</NOTE>. This motion was seconded by Pembroke,
who, clapping his hand to his sword, swore he was ready
to fight any man who expressed himself of a contrary sen∣timent.
The mayor and aldermen of London were im∣mediately
sent for, who discovered great ala<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity in obey∣ing
the orders they received to proclaim Mary. The
people expressed their approbation by shouts of applause.
Even Suffolk, who commanded in the Tower, finding
resistance fruitless, opened the gates, and declared for the
Queen. The lady Jane, after wearing the vain pa∣geantry
of a crown during ten days, returned to a private
life with much more satisfaction than she felt when the
royalty was tendered to her<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 332. Thuanu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> lib. xiii. c. 2.</NOTE>: And the messengers who
were sent to Northumberland, with orders to lay down
his arms, found that he had despaired of success, was de∣serted
by all his followers, and had already proclaimed
the Queen, with exterior marks of joy and satisfaction<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 612.</NOTE>.
<PB N="400" REF="426"/>
The people every where, on the Queen's approach to
London, gave sensible expressions of their loyalty and at∣tachment.
And the lady Elizabeth met her at the head
of a thousand horse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen proclaimed and ac∣knowleged.</NOTE> which that princess had levied, in
order to support their joint title against the usurper<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 240. Heylin, p. 19. Stowe, p. 613.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen gave orders for taking into custody
the duke of Northumberland, who fell on his knees to the
earl of Arundel that arrested him, and abjectly begged
his life<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 239. Stowe, p. 612. Baker, p. 315. Hol∣lingshed, p. 1088.</NOTE>. At the same time were committed, the earl of
Warwic, his eldest son, Ambrose and Henry Dudley,
two of his younger sons, Sir Andrew Dudley, his bro∣ther,
the marquess of Northampton, the earl of Hun∣tingdon,
Sir Thomas Palmer, and Sir John Gates. The
Queen afterwards confined the duke of Suffolk, the lady
Jane Gray, and lord Guilford Dudley. But Mary was
desirous, in the beginning of her reign, to acquire popu∣larity
by the appearance of clemency; and because the
counsellors pleaded constraint, as an excuse for their
treason, she extended her pardon to most of them. Suf∣folk
himself recovered his liberty; and he owed this in∣dulgence,
in a great measure, to the contempt enter∣tained
of his capacity. But the guilt of Northumberland
was too great, as well as his ambition and courage too
dangerous, to permit him to entertain any reasonable
hopes of life. When brought to his trial, he only de∣sired
permission to ask two questions of the peers who
were appointed to sit on his jury; whether a man could
be guilty of treason who obeyed orders given him by the
council under the great seal? and whether those who
were involved in the same guilt with himself, could act
as his judges? Being told, that the great seal of an
usurper was no authority, and that persons who lay not
<PB N="401" REF="427"/>
under any sentence of attainder, were still innocent in
the eye of the law, and might be admitted on any jury<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 243. Heylin, p. 18. Baker, p. 316. Hol∣lingshed, p. 1089.</NOTE>;
he acquiesced, and pleaded guilty. At his execution, he
made profession of the catholic religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 August. Northum∣berland executed.</NOTE> and told the
people, that they never would enjoy tranquillity till they
returned to the faith of their ancestors: Whether that
such were his real sentiments, which he had formerly
concealed, from interest and ambition, or that he hoped,
by this declaration, to render the Queen more favourable
to his family<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 19. Burnet, vol. iii. p. 243. Stowe, p. 614.</NOTE>. Sir Thomas Palmer, and Sir John Gates,
suffered with him; and this was all the blood spilt on ac∣count
of so dangerous and criminal an enterprize against
the rights of the sovereign. Sentence was pronounced
against the lady Jane and lord Guilford; but without any
present intention of putting it in execution. The youth
and innocence of the persons, neither of whom had
reached their seventeenth year, pleaded sufficiently in their
favour.</P>
<P>WHEN Mary first arrived in the Tower, the duke of
Norfolk, who had been detained prisoner during all the
last reign; Courtney, son to the marquess of Exeter,
who, without being charged with any crime, had been
subjected to the same punishment ever since his father's
attainder; Gardiner, Tonstal, and Bonner, who had
been confined for their adherence to the catholic cause,
appeared before her, and implored her clemency and pro∣tection<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 20. Stowe, p. 613. Hollingshed, p. 1088.</NOTE>. They were all of them restored to their li∣berty,
and immediately admitted to her confidence and
favour. Norfolk's attainder, notwithstanding that it had
passed in Parliament, was represented as null and invalid;
because, among other informalities, no special mat∣ter
<PB N="402" REF="428"/>
had been alleged against him, except wearing a coat
of arms, which he and his ancestors, without giving
any offence, had always made use of in the face of the
court and of the whole nation. Courtney received the
title of earl of Devonshire; and though educated in such
close confinement, that he was altogether unacquainted
with the world, he soon acquired all the accomplishments
of a courtier and a gentleman, and made a considerable
figure during the few years which he lived after he reco∣vered
his liberty. Besides performing all those popular
acts, which, though they only regarded individuals, were
very acceptable to the nation, the Queen endeavoured to
ingratiate herself with the public, by granting a general
pardon, though with some exceptions, and by remitting
the subsidy voted to her brother by the last Parliament<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 616.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE joy arising from the succession of the lawful
heir, and from the gracious demeanour of the sovereign,
hindered not the people from being agitated with great
anxiety concerning the state of religion; and as the bulk
of the nation inclined to the protestant communion, ap∣prehensions
were generally entertained of the principles
and prejudices of the new Queen. The legitimacy of
Mary's birth had appeared to be somewhat connected
with the papal authority; and as that princess was edu∣cated
with her mother, she had imbibed the strongest at∣tachment
to the catholic communion, and the highest
aversion to those new tenets, whence, she believed, all
the misfortunes of her family had originally sprung. The
discouragements which she lay under from her father,
though at last they brought her to comply with his will,
tended still more to encrease her disgust to the reformers;
and the vexations which the protector and the council
gave her, during Edward's reign, had no other effect
<PB N="403" REF="429"/>
than to confirm her farther in her prejudices. Naturally
of a sour and obstinate temper, and irritated by contra∣dictions
and misfortunes, she possessed all the qualities
fitted to compose a bigot; and her extreme ignorance
rendered her utterly incapable of doubt in her own be∣lief,
or of indulgence to the opinions of others. The
nation, therefore, had great reason to dread, not only
the abolition, but the persecution of the established reli∣gion
from the zeal of Mary; and it was not long before
she discovered her intentions.</P>
<P>GARDINER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Catholic religion re∣stored.</NOTE> Bonner, Tonstal, Day, Heath, Vesey,
were reinstated in their sees, either by a direct act of
power, or, what is nearly the same, by the sentence of
commissioners, who were appointed to review their pro∣cess
and condemnation. Though the bishopric of Dur∣ham
had been dissolved by authority of Parliament, the
Queen erected it anew by letters-patent, and replaced
Tonstal in his regalities as well as in his revenue. On
pretence of discouraging controversy, she silenced, by her
prerogative, all the preachers throughout England, ex∣cept
such as should obtain a particular licence<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 23. Fox, vol. iii. p. 16. Strype's Mem. vol. iii. p. 26.</NOTE>; and it
was easy to foresee that none but the catholics would be
favoured with this privilege. Holgate, archbishop of
York, Coverdale, bishop of Exeter, Ridley of London,
and Hooper of Glocester, were thrown into prison;
whither old Latimer also was sent soon after<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 336.</NOTE>. The
zealous bishops and priests were encouraged in their for∣wardness
to revive the mass, though contrary to the pre∣sent
laws. Judge Hales, who had discovered such con∣stancy
in defending the Queen's title, lost all his merit
by an opposition to those illegal practices; and being
committed to custody, was treated with such severity,
<PB N="404" REF="430"/>
that he fell into frenzy, and killed himself<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 247. Fox, vol. iii. p. 15, 19. Baker, p. 317.</NOTE>. The men
of Suffolk were brow-beaten, when they presumed to
plead the promise which the Queen, when they inlisted
themselves in her service, had given them, of maintain∣ing
the reformed religion: One, in particular, was set in
the pillory, because he had been too peremptory in re∣calling
to her memory the engagements which she had
taken on that occasion. And though the Queen still
promised, in a public declaration before the council, to
tolerate those who differed from her<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol▪ ii. p. 245.</NOTE>, men foresaw, that
this engagement, like the former, would prove but a
feeble security, when set in opposition to religious pre∣judices.</P>
<P>THE merits of Cranmer towards the Queen, during
the reign of Henry, had been considerable; and he had
successfully employed his good offices in mitigating the
severe prejudices which that monarch had entertained
against her<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 240, 241. Heylin, p. 25. Godwin, p. 336.</NOTE>. But the active part which he had borne in
promoting her mother's divorce, as well as in conducting
the reformation, had made him the object of her hatred;
and though Gardiner had been equally forward in solli∣citing
and defending the divorce, he had afterwards
made sufficient atonement by his sufferings in defence of
the catholic cause. The primate, therefore, had reason
to expect little favour during the present reign; but it
was by his own indiscreet zeal, that he brought on him∣self
the first violence and persecution. A report being
spread, that Cranmer, in order to make his court to the
Queen, had promised to officiate in the Latin service, the
archbishop, to wipe off this aspersion, drew up a mani∣festo
in his own defence. Among other expressions, he
<PB N="405" REF="431"/>
there said, that as the devil was a lyar from the begin∣ning,
and the father of lies, so he had at this time stirred
up his servants to persecute Christ and his true religion;
That the infernal spirit now endeavoured to restore the
Latin satisfactory masses, a thing of his own invention,
and device; and in order to effectuate his purpose, had
falsely made use of Cranmer's name and authority: And
that the mass is not only without foundation, either in
the Scriptures or the practice of the primitive church,
but likewise discovers a plain contradiction to antiquity
and the inspired writings, and is besides replete with
many horrid blasphemies<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 94. Heylin, p. 25. Godwin, p. 336. Burnet, vol. ii. Coll. N<SUP>o</SUP> 8. Cranm, Mem. p. 305. Thuanus, lib. xiii. c. 2.</NOTE>. On the publication of this
inflammatory paper, Cranmer was thrown into prison, and
was tried for the part which he had acted, in con∣curring
with the lady Jane, and opposing the Queen's
accession. Sentence of high treason was pronounced
against him; and though his guilt was shared with the
whole privy council, and was even less than that of most
of the others, this sentence, however severe, must be al∣lowed
entirely legal. The execution of it, however,
did not follow; and Cranmer was reserved for a more
cruel punishment.</P>
<P>PETER Martyr, seeing a persecution gathering against
the reformers, desired leave to withdraw<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 26. Godwin, p. 336. Cranm. Mem. p. 317.</NOTE>; and while
some zealous catholics moved for his commitment, Gar∣diner
both pleaded, that he had come over by an invita∣tion
from the government, and generously furnished him
with supplies for his journey: But as bigotted zeal still
encreased, his wife's body, which had been interred at
Oxford, was afterwards dug up by public order, and
buried in a dung-hill<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 26.</NOTE>. The bones of Bucer and Fa∣gius,
<PB N="406" REF="432"/>
two foreign reformers, were about the same time
committed to the flames at Cambridge<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Saunders de Schism. Anglic.</NOTE>. John a Lasco
was first silenced, and then ordered to depart the king∣dom
with his congregation. The greater part of the fo∣reign
protestants followed him; and the nation thereby
lost many useful hands for arts and manufactures. Se∣veral
English protestants also took shelter in foreign
parts, and every thing bore a dismal aspect for the refor∣mation.</P>
<P>DURING this revolution of the court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th Octo∣ber.</NOTE> no protection
was expected by the protestants from the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE>
which was summoned to assemble. A zealous reformer<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Beale. But Fox, who lived at the time, and is very minute in his narratives, says nothing of the matter. See vol. iii. p. 16.</NOTE>
pretends, that great violence and iniquity were used in
the elections; but besides that the authority of this wri∣ter
is inconsiderable, that practice, as the necessities of
government seldom required it, had not hitherto been
often employed in England. There still remained such
numbers devoted, by opinion or affection, to many prin∣ciples
of the ancient religion, that the authority of the
crown was able to give such candidates the prevalence in
most elections; and all those who scrupled compliance
with the court religion, rather declined taking a seat in
the house, which, while it rendered them obnoxious to
the Queen, could afterwards afford them no protection
against the violence of prerogative. It soon appeared,
therefore, that a majority of the commons would be ob∣sequious
to Mary's designs; and as the peers were mostly
attached to the court, from interest or expectation, little
opposition was expected from that quarter.</P>
<P>IN opening the Parliament, the court showed a very
signal contempt of the laws, by celebrating, before the
two houses, a mass of the Holy Ghost, in the Latin
<PB N="407" REF="433"/>
tongue▪ attended with all the ancient rites and ceremo∣nies,
though abolished by act of Parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 19.</NOTE>. Taylor,
bishop of Lincoln, having refused to kneel at this ser∣vice,
was very severely handled, and was violently thrust
out of the house<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 252.</NOTE>. The Queen, however, still retained
the title of supreme head of the church of England;
and it was generally pretended, that the intention of
the court was only to restore religion to the same condi∣tion
in which it had been left by Henry; but that the
other abuses of popery, which were chiefly grievous to
the nation, would never be revived.</P>
<P>THE first bill passed by the Parliament, was of a very
popular nature, and abolished every species of treason
which was not contained in the statute of Edward the
third, and every species of felony which did not subsist
before the first of Henry the eighth<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mariae, sess. i. c. 1. By this repeal, though it was in general po∣pular, the clause of 5 and 6 Edw. VI. c. 11. was lost, which required the confronting two witnesses, in order to prove any treason.</NOTE>. The Parliament
next declared the Queen to be legitimate, ratified the
marriage of Henry with Catherine of Arragon, and an∣nulled
the divorce pronounced by Cranmer<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mariae, sess. 2. c. 1.</NOTE>, whom they
greatly blamed on that account. No mention, however,
is made of the pope's authority, as any ground of the
marriage. All the statutes of King Edward, with regard
to religion, were repealed by one vote<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">1 Mariae, sess. 2. c. 12.</NOTE>; and thereby
the national religion was replaced on the same footing on
which it stood at the death of Henry. The attainder of
the duke of Norfolk was reversed; and this act of justice
was much more reasonable than the declaring that attain∣der
invalid, without farther authority. Most of the
clauses of the riot act, passed in the late reign, were re∣vived:
<PB N="408" REF="434"/>
A step which eluded, in a great measure, the po∣pular
statute enacted at the first meeting of the Par∣liament.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the compliance of the two
houses with the Queen's inclinations, they had still a
reserve in certain articles; and her choice of a husband
was, in particular, of such importance to national in∣terest,
that they determined not to submit tamely, in
that respect, to her will and pleasure. There were three
marriages<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Thuan. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. ii. c. 3.</NOTE>, concerning which it was supposed that Mary
had deliberated after her accession to the crown. The
first person proposed to her, was Courtney, earl of De∣vonshire,
who, being an Englishman, nearly allied to
the crown, could not fail to be acceptable to the nation;
and as he was of an engaging person and address, he had
gained visibly on the Queen's affections, and hints were
dropt him of her favourable dispositions towards him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 339.</NOTE>.
But that nobleman neglected these overtures; and seemed
rather to attach himself to the lady Elizabeth, whose
youth and agreeable conversation he preferred to all the
power and grandeur of her sister. This choice occasion∣ed
a great coldness of Mary towards Devonshire; and
made her break out in a declared animosity against Eli∣zabeth.
The ancient quarrel between their mothers had
sunk deep into the malignant heart of the Queen; and
after the declaration made by Parliament in favour of
Catherine's marriage, she wanted not a pretence for re∣presenting
the birth of her sister as illegitimate. The at∣tachment
of Elizabeth to the reformed religion offended
Mary's bigotry; and as the young princess had made
some difficulty of disguising her sentiments, very violent
menaces had been employed to bring her to compliance.
But when the Queen round that Elizabeth had obstructed
<PB N="409" REF="435"/>
her views in a point, which, perhaps, touched her still
more nearly, her resentment, excited by pride, knew no
longer any bounds; and the princess was visibly exposed
to the greatest danger<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 31. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 255.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CARDINAL Pole, who had never taken priest's orders,
was another party proposed to the Queen; and there ap∣peared
many reasons to induce her to make choice of
this prelate. The high character of Pole for virtue and
generosity; the great regard paid him by the catholic
church, of which he had nearly reached the highest dig∣nity
on the death of Paul the third<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, book iii.</NOTE>; the Queen's af∣fection
for the countess of Salisbury, his mother, who
had once been her governess; the violent animosity to
which he had been exposed on account of his attachment
to the Romish communion; all these considerations had
a powerful influence on Mary. But the cardinal was
now in the decline of life; and having contracted ha∣bits
of study and retirement, he was represented as un∣qualified
for the bustle of a court, and the hurry of bu∣siness<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 31.</NOTE>.
The Queen, therefore, dropt all views of that
alliance: But as she entertained a great regard for Pole's
wisdom and virtue, she still proposed to reap the benefit
of his advice in the administration of her government.
She secretly entered into a negotiation with Commen∣done,
an agent of cardinal Dandino, legate at Brussels;
she sent assurances to the pope, then Julius the third, of
her earnest desire to reconcile herself and her kingdoms
to the holy see; and she desired that Pole might be ap∣pointed
legate for the performance of that pious office<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 258.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE two marriages being rejected, the Queen
cast her eye towards the emperor's family, from which
<PB N="410" REF="436"/>
her mother was descended, and which, during her own
distresses, had always afforded her countenance and pro∣tection.
Charles the fifth, who a few years before was
almost absolute matter of Germany, had exercised his
power in such an arbitrary manner, that he gave extreme
disgust to the nation, who apprehended the total extinc∣tion
of their liberties and privileges from the encroach∣ments
of that monarch<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. iv. c. 17.</NOTE>. Religion had served him as a
pretence for his usurpations; and from the same principle
he met with that opposition which overthrew his gran∣deur,
and dashed all his ambitious hopes. Maurice,
elector of Saxony, enraged that the landgrave of Hesse,
who, by his advice, and on his assurances, had put him∣self
into the emperor's hands, should be unjustly detained
prisoner, formed a secret conspiracy among the protestant
princes; and covering his intentions with the most art∣ful
disguises, he suddenly marched his forces against
Charles, and narrowly missed becoming master of his
person. The protestants flew to arms in every quarter;
and their insurrection, aided by an invasion from France,
reduced the emperor to such extremity, that he was
obliged to submit to articles of peace, which ensured the
independency of Germany. To retrieve his honour, he
made an attack on France; and laying siege to Metz,
with an army of an hundred thousand men, he conducted
the enterprize in person, and seemed determined, at all
hazards, to succeed in an undertaking which had at∣tracted
the attention of all Europe. But the duke of
Guise, who defended Metz, with a garrison composed of
the bravest nobility of France, exerted such vigilance,
conduct, and valour, that the siege was protracted to the
depth of winter; and the emperor found it dangerous to
persevere any longer. He retired with the remains of
<PB N="411" REF="437"/>
his army, into the Low Countries, much dejected with
that reverse of fortune which, in his declining years, had
so fatally overtaken him.</P>
<P>NO sooner did Charles hear of the death of Edward,
and the accession of his kinswoman, Mary, to the crown
of England, than he formed the scheme of acquiring that
kingdom to his family; and he hoped, by this incident,
to ballance all the losses which he had suffered in Ger∣many.
His son, Philip, who was a widower, had but
one son by his former marriage; and tho' he was only
twenty-seven years of age, eleven years younger than
the Queen, this objection, it was thought, might easily
be overlooked, and there was no reason to despair of her
having still a numerous issue. The emperor, therefore,
immediately sent over an agent to signify his intentions
to Mary, who, pleased with the support of so powerful
an alliance, and glad to unite herself more closely with her
mother's family, to which she was ever strongly attached,
readily embraced the proposal. Norfolk, Arundel, and
Paget, gave their advice for the match: And Gardiner,
who was become prime minister, and who had been pro∣moted
to the office of chancellor, finding how Mary's
inclinations lay, seconded the project of the Spanish al∣liance;
and represented, both to her and the emperor,
the necessity of stopping all farther innovations in reli∣gion,
till the completion of the marriage. He observed,
that the Parliament, amidst all their compliances, had
discovered evident symptoms of jealousy, and seemed at
present determined, to grant no further concessions in
favour of the catholic religion: That though they might
make a sacrifice to their Sovereign of some speculative
principles, which they did not well comprehend, or of
some rites, which seemed not of any immediate impor∣tance,
they had imbibed such strong prejudices against
<PB N="412" REF="438"/>
the pretended usurpations and exactions of the court of
Rome, that they would with great difficulty be again
brought to submit to its authority: That the danger of
making a resumption of the abbey lands, would alarm
the nobility and gentry, and induce them to encourage
the prepossessions which were but too general among the
people, against the doctrine and worship of the catholic
church: That much pains had been taken to prejudice
the nation against the Spanish alliance; and if that point
was urged, at the same time with further changes in re∣ligion,
it would hazard a general revolt and insurrection:
That the marriage, being once compleated, would give
authority to the Queen's measures, and enable her after∣wards
to forward that pious work, in which she was en∣gaged:
And that it was even necessary previously to re∣concile
the people to the marriage, by rendering the
conditions extremely favourable to the English, and such
as would seem to ensure to them their independency, and
the entire possession of their ancient laws and privi∣leges<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 261.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE emperor, well acquainted with the prudence and
experience of Gardiner, assented to all these reasons; and
he endeavoured to temper the zeal of Mary, by repre∣senting
the necessity of proceeding gradually in the great
work of converting the nation. Hearing that cardinal
Pole, more sincere in his religious opinions, and less
guided by the maxims of civil policy, after having sent
opposite advice to the Queen, had set out on his journey
to England, where he was to exercise his legantine com∣mission;
he thought proper to stop him at Dillinghen, a
town on the Danube; and he afterwards obtained Mary's
consent for this detention. The negociation for the mar∣riage
mean-while proceeded apace; and Mary's intentions
<PB N="413" REF="439"/>
to espouse Philip became generally known to the nation.
The commons, who hoped that they had gained the
Queen by the concessions which they had already made,
were alarmed to hear, that she was resolved to contract a
foreign alliance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Decem∣ber.</NOTE> and they sent a committee to remon∣strate
against that dangerous measure. To prevent far∣ther
applications of the same kind, she thought proper
to dissolve them.</P>
<P>A CONVOCATION had been summoned at the same
time with the Parliament; and the majority here also ap∣peared
to be of the court religion. An offer was very
frankly made by the Romanists, to dispute concerning
the points controverted between the two communions;
and as transubstantiation was the article which, of all
others, they deemed the clearest, and founded on the
most irresistible argument, they chose to try their strength
by defending it. The protestants pushed the dispute as
far as the clamour and noise of their antagonists would
permit; and they fondly imagined, that they had obtained
some advantage, when, in the course of the debate, they
obliged the catholics to avow, that, according to their
doctrine, Christ had, in his last supper, held himself in
his hand, and had swallowed and eat himself<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 356. Fox, vol. iii. p. 22.</NOTE>. This
triumph, however, was confined only to their own party:
The Romanists maintained, that their champions had
clearly the better of the day; that their adversaries were
blind and obstinate heretics; that nothing but the most
extreme depravity of heart could induce men to contest
such self-evident principles; and that the severest punish∣ments
were due to their perverse wickedness. So pleased
were they with their superiority in this favourite point,
that they soon after renewed the dispute at Oxford; and
to show, that they feared no force of learning or capacity,
<PB N="414" REF="440"/>
where reason was so evidently on their side, they sent
thither Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley, under a guard,
to try whether these renowned controversialists could find
any appearance of argument to defend their baffled prin∣ciples<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cran. p. 354. Heylin, p. 50.</NOTE>.
The issue of the debate was very different from
what it appeared to be a few years before, in a famous
conference held at the same place during the reign of
Edward.</P>
<P>AFTER the Parliament and convocation were broke up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1554.</NOTE>
the new laws with regard to religion, though they had
been anticipated, in most places, by the zeal of the ca∣tholics,
countenanced by the government, were still more
openly put in execution: The mass was every where re∣established;
and marriage was declared to be incompatible
with any spiritual office. It has been asserted by some
writers, that three fourths of the clergy were, at this
time, deprived of their livings; though other historians,
more accurate<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Harmer, p. 138.</NOTE>, have estimated the number of sufferers
to be far short of this proportion. Could any principles
of law, justice or reason be attended to, where superstition
predominates; the priests would never have been expelled
for their past marriages, which at that time were permit∣ted
by the laws of the kingdom. A visitation was ap∣pointed,
in order to restore more perfectly the mass and
the antient rites. Among other articles the commissioners
were enjoined to forbid the oath of supremacy to be taken
by the clergy on their receiving any benefice<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 364. Fox, vol. iii. p. 38. Heylin, p. 35. Sleidan, lib. 25.</NOTE>. It is to
be observed, that this oath had been established by the
laws of Henry the eighth, which were still in force.</P>
<P>THIS violent and sudden change of religion inspired
the protestants with great discontent; and even affected
<PB N="415" REF="441"/>
indifferent spectators with concern, by the hardships, to
which so many individuals were on that account exposed.
But the Spanish match was a point of more general
concern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's marriage with Phi∣lip.</NOTE> and diffused universal apprehensions for the
liberty and independance of the nation. To obviate all
clamour, the articles of marriage were drawn as favour∣able
as possible for the interest and security, and even
grandeur of England. It was agreed, that tho' Philip
should have the title of King, the administration should
be entirely in the Queen; that no foreigner should be
capable of enjoying any office in the kingdom; that no
innovation should be made in the English laws, customs
and privileges; that Philip should not carry the Queen
abroad without her consent, nor any of her children
without the consent of the nobility; that sixty thousand
pounds a year should be settled on her as her jointure;
that the male issue of this marriage should inherit, to∣gether
with England, both Burgundy and the Low
Countries; and that, if Don Carlos, Philip's son by his
former marriage, should die and his line be extinct, the
Queen's issue, whether male or female, should inherit
Spain, Sicily, Milan, and all the other dominions of
Philip<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, xv. p. 377.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th Jan.</NOTE> Such was the treaty of marriage signed by
count Egmont, and four other ambassadors sent over to
England by the emperor.</P>
<P>THESE articles when published, gave no satisfaction
to the nation: It was universally said, that the emperor,
in order to get possession of England, would verbally agree
to any terms; and the greater advantage there appeared
in the conditions which he granted, the more certainly
might it be concluded, that he had no serious intention
of observing them: That the usual fraud and ambition
of that monarch might assure the nation of such a con∣duct;

<PB N="416" REF="444"/>
and his son Philip, while he inherited these vices
from his father, added to them tyranny, sullenness, pride,
and barbarity, more dangerous vices of his own: That
England would become a province, and a province to a
kingdom which usually exercised the most violent autho∣rity
over all her dependant dominions: That the Nether∣lands,
Milan, Sicily, Naples groaned under the burthen
of Spanish tyranny; and throughout all the new con∣quests
in America there had been displayed scenes of un∣relenting
cruelty, hitherto unknown in the history of
mankind: That the inquisition was a tribunal invented
by that tyrannical nation; and would infallibly, with all
their other laws and institutions, be introduced into Eng∣land:
And that the divided sentiments of the people with
regard to religion would subject multitudes to this ini∣quitous
tribunal, and would reduce the whole nation to
the most abject servitude<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 32. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 268. Godwin, p. 339.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE complaints, being diffused through the whole
people, prepared the nation for a rebellion; and had any
foreign power given them encouragement, or any great
man appeared to head them; the consequences might
have proved fatal to the Queen's authority. But the
King of France, though engaged in hostilities with the
emperor, refused to concur in any proposal for an insur∣rection,
lest he should afford Mary a pretence for declar∣ing
war against him. And the more prudent part of the
nobility thought, that, as the evils of the Spanish alliance
were only dreaded at a distance, matters were not yet
fully prepared for a general revolt. Some persons, how∣ever,
more turbulent than the rest, believed, that it would
be safer to prevent than to redress grievances; and they
framed a conspiracy to rise in arms, and declare against
the Queen's marriage with Philip, Sir Thomas Wiat
<PB N="417" REF="445"/>
proposed to raise Kent, Sir Peter Carew, Devonshire;
and they engaged the duke of Suffolk, by the hopes of
recovering the crown for the lady Jane, to attempt raising
the midland counties<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 33. Godwin, p. 340.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wiat's in∣surrection.</NOTE>. Carew's impatience or appre∣hensions
engaged him to break the concert, and to rise
in arms before the day appointed: He was soon suppressed
by the earl of Bedford, and obliged to fly into France.
On this intelligence, Suffolk, dreading an arrest, sud∣denly
left the town, with his brothers, the lord Thomas,
and lord Leonard Grey; and endeavoured to raise the
people in the counties of Warwic and Leicester; where
his interest lay: But he was so closely pursued by the earl
of Huntingdon, at the head of 300 horse, that he was
obliged to disperse his retainers, and being discovered in
his retreat, he was led prisoner to London<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 30.</NOTE>. Wiat was
at first more successful in his attempt; and having pub∣lished
a declaration at Maidstone in Kent, against the
Queen's evil counsellors and against the Spanish match,
without any mention, of religion, the people began to
gather under his standard. The duke of Norfolk with
Sir Henry Jernegan was sent against him, at the head of
the guards and some other troops, reinforced with 500
Londoners commanded by Bret: And he came within
sight of the rebels at Rochester, where they had fixed
their head quarters. Sir George Harper hare pretended
to desert from them; but having secretly gained Bret,
these two persons so wrought on the Londoners, that that
whole body deserted to Wiat, and declared that they
would not contribute to enslave their native country.
Norfolk, dreading the contagion of this example, im∣mediately
retreated with his troops and took shelter in
London<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 33. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Godwin, p. 341. Stowe, p. 619. Baker, p. 318. Hollingshed, p. 1094.</NOTE>.</P>

AFTER this proof of the dispositions of the people,
especially of the Londoners, who were mostly protestants,
Wiat was encouraged to proceed; and he led his forces
to Southwark, where he required of the Queen, that she
should put the Tower into his hands, should deliver four
counsellers as hostages, and in order to ensure the liberty
of the nation, should immediately marry an Englishman.
Finding that the bridge was secured against him, and that
the city was over-awed, he marched up to Kingston,
where he passed the river with 4000 men; and returning
towards London, hoped to encourage his partizans, who
had engaged to declare for him. He had imprudently
wasted so much time at Southwark, and in his march from
Kingston, that the critical season, on which all popular
commotions depend, was entirely lost; and though he
entered Westminster without resistance, his followers,
finding that no person of note joined him, insensibly fell
off, and he was at last seized near Temple-Bar by Sir
Maurice Berkley<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 31. Heylin, p. 34. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 270. Stowe, p. 621.</NOTE>. Above seventy persons suffered for
this rebellion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Febr.</NOTE> Four hundred were conducted before
the Queen with ropes about their necks; and falling on
their knees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣tion sup∣pressed.</NOTE> received a pardon, and were dismissed. Wiat
was condemned and executed; and as it had been report∣ed,
that on his examination, he had accused the lady
Elizabeth and the earl of Devonshire as accomplices, he
took care on the scaffold, before the whole people, fully
to acquit them of having any share in his rebellion.</P>
<P>THE lady Elizabeth had been, during some time,
treated with great harshness by her sister; and many
studied instances of discouragement and disrespect had
been practised against her. She was ordered to take place
at court after the countess of Lenox and the dutchess of
<PB N="419" REF="449"/>
Suffolk, as if she were not legitimate: Her friends were
discountenanced on every occasion: And while her vir∣tues,
which were now become very eminent, drew to
her the attendance of all the young nobility, and rendered
her the favourite of the nation, the malevolence of the
Queen still discovered itself every day by fresh symptoms,
and obliged the Princess to retire into the country. Marry
seized the opportunity of this rebellion; and hoping to
involve her sister in some appearance of guilt, sent for her
under a strong guard, committed her to the Tower, and
ordered her to be very strictly examined by the council.
But the public declaration made by Wiat rendered it im∣practicable
to employ against her any false evidence, which
might have offered; and the Princess made so good a
defence, that the Queen found herself under a necessity of
dismissing her<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 343. Burnet, vol. iii. p. 273. Fox, vol. iii. p. 99, 105. Strype's Mem. vol. iii. p. 85.</NOTE>. In order to send her out of the kingdom,
a marriage was proposed to her with the duke of Savoy;
and when she declined giving her consent, she was com∣mitted
to custody, under a very strong guard, at Wode∣stoke.
The earl of Devonshire, tho' equally innocent,
was confined in Fotheringay castle.</P>
<P>BUT this rebellion proved still more fatal to the lady
Jane Gray, as well as to her husband: The duke of Suf∣folk's
guilt was imputed to her; and tho' the rebels and
malecontents seemed chiefly to rest their hopes on the lady
Elizabeth and the earl of Devonshire, the Queen, inca∣pable
of generosity or clemency, determined to remove
every person, from whom the least danger could be ap∣prehended.
Warning was given the lady Jane to prepare
for death; a doom which she had long expected, and
which the innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes
to which she had been exposed, rendered no unwelcome
<PB N="420" REF="450"/>
news to her. The Queen's bigotted zeal, under colour
of tender mercy to the prisoner's soul, induced her to
send divines, who molested her with perpetual disputa∣tion;
and even a reprieve of three days was granted her,
in hopes that she would be persuaded, during that time,
to pay, by a timely conversion, some regard to her eter∣nal
welfare. The lady Jane had presence of mind, in
those melancholy circumstances, not only to defend her
religion by all the topics then in use, but also to write a
letter to her sister<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 35. Heylin, p. 166.</NOTE> in the Greek language; in which,
besides sending her a copy of the Scriptures in that tongue,
she exhorted her to maintain, in every fortune, a like
steady perseverance. On the day of her execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th Febr.</NOTE> her husband, the lord Guilford, desired permission to see her;
but she refused her consent, and sent him word, that the
tenderness of their parting would overcome the fortitude
of both, and would too much unbend their minds from
that constancy, which their approaching end required of
them: Their separation, she said, would be only for a
moment; and they would soon rejoin each other in a
scene, where their affections would be for ever united,
and where death, disappointment, and misfortunes could
no longer have access to them, or disturb their eternal
felicity<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 167. Baker, p. 319.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT had been intended to execute the lady Jane and lord
Guilford together on the same scaffold at Tower-hill;
but the council, dreading the compassion of the people
for their youth, beauty, innocence, and noble birth,
changed their orders, and gave directions that she should
be beheaded within the verge of the Tower. She saw
her husband led to execution;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of lady Jane Gray.</NOTE> and having given him from
the window some token of her remembrance, she waited
<PB N="421" REF="451"/>
with tranquillity till her own appointed hour should bring
her to a like fate. She even saw his headless body carried
back in a cart; and found herself more confirmed by the
reports, which she heard of the constancy of his end,
than shaken by so tender and melancholy a spectacle. Sir
John Gage, constable of the Tower, when he led her to
execution, desired her to bestow on him some small pre∣sent,
which he might keep as a perpetual memorial of
her: She gave him her table-book, where she had just
wrote three sentences on seeing her husband's dead body;
one in Greek, another in Latin, a third in English<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 167.</NOTE>.
The purport of them was, that human justice was
against his body, but the divine mercy would be favour∣able
to his soul; and that if her fault deserved punish∣ment,
her youth at least, and her imprudence were wor∣thy
of excuse; and that God and posterity, she trusted,
would show her favour. On the scaffold, she made a
speech to the bye-standers, in which the mildness of her
disposition led her to take the blame entirely on herself,
without uttering one complaint against the severity, with
which she had been treated. She said, that her offence
was not the having laid her hand upon the crown, but
the not rejecting it with sufficient constancy: That she
had less erred through ambition than through reverence
to her parents, whom she had been taught to respect and
obey: That she willingly received death, as the only
satisfaction which she could now make to the injured
state; and though her infringement of the laws had been
constrained, she would show, by her voluntary submission
to their sentence, that she was desirous to attone for that
disobedience, into which too much filial piety had be∣trayed
her: That she had justly deserved this punish∣ment
for being made the instrument, though the unwilling
<PB N="422" REF="452"/>
instrument, of the ambition of others: And that the story
of her life, she hoped, might at least be useful, by prov∣ing
that innocence excuses not great misdeeds, if they
tend any way to the destruction of the commonwealth.
After uttering these words, she caused herself to be dis∣robed
by her women; and with a steddy serene counte∣nance
submitted herself to the executioner<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 167. Fox, vol. iii. p. 36, 37. Hollingshed, p. 1099.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Suffolk was tried, condemned, and exe∣cuted
soon after; and would have met with more com∣passion,
had not his temerity been the cause of his daugh∣ter's
untimely death. The lord Thomas Grey lost his life
for the same crime. Sir Nicholas Throcmorton was tried
in Guildhall; but there appearing no satisfactory evidence
against him, he was able, by making an admirable de∣fence,
to obtain a verdict of the jury in his favour. The
Queen was so enraged at this disappointment, that, in∣stead
of releasing him as the law required, she re-com∣mitted
him to the Tower, and kept him in close confine∣ment
during some time. But her resentment stopped not
here: The jury, being summoned before the council,
were all of them sent to prison, and afterwards fined,
some of them a thousand pounds, others two thousand
a-piece<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 99. Stowe, p. 624. Baker, p. 320. Holling∣shed, p. 1104, 1121. Strype, vol. iii. p. 120.</NOTE>. This illegal violence proved fatal to several,
among others to Sir John Throcmorton, brother to Sir
Nicholas, who was condemned on no better evidence
than had been formerly rejected. The Queen filled the
Tower and all the prisons with nobility and gentry, whom
their interest with the people, rather than any appearance
of guilt, had made the objects of her suspicion. And
finding, that she was become extremely odious to the
nation, she was resolved to disable them from resistance,
by ordering general musters, and directing the commis∣sioners
<PB N="423" REF="453"/>
to seize their arms, and lay them up in forts and
castles.</P>
<P>THOUGH the government laboured under so general
an odium, the Queen's authority had received such an
increase from the suppression of Wiat's rebellion, that the
ministry hoped to find a very compliant disposition in the
new Parliament, which was summoned to assemble. The
emperor also, in order to facilitate the same end, had
borrowed no less a sum than 400,000 pounds;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment. 5th April.</NOTE> which he had
sent over to England, to be distributed in bribes and pensions
among the members: A pernicious practice, of which
there had not hitherto been any instance in England.
And not to give the public any alarm with regard to
the church lands, the Queen, notwithstanding her bigotry,
resumed her legal title of supreme head of the church,
which she had dropped three months before. Gardiner,
the chancellor, opened the session by a speech; in
which he asserted the Queen's hereditary title to the
crown; maintained her right to choose a husband for
herself; observed how proper an use she had made of that
right, by preferring an old ally, descended from the
house of Burgundy; and remarked the failure of Henry
the eighth's posterity, of whom there now remained none
but the Queen and the lady Elizabeth. He added,
that, in order to obviate the inconveniences, which
might arise from different pretenders, it was necessary
to invest the Queen, by law, with a power of disposing
of the crown, and of appointing her successor: A power,
he said, which was not to be regarded as a new thing in
England, since it had formerly been conferred on Henry
the eighth<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol. iii. p. 310, from Ambass. de No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament were much disposed to gratify the
Queen in all her desires; but when the liberty, indepen∣dency,
and very being of the nation were brought into
<PB N="422" REF="454"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="423" REF="455"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="424" REF="456"/>
such visible danger, they could not by any means <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
brought to compliance. They knew both the inveterate
hatred which she bore the lady Elizabeth, and her devoted
attachment to the house of Austria: They were acquainted
with her extreme bigotry, which would lead her to post∣pone
all considerations of justice or national interest to
the establishment of the catholic religion: They remark∣ed,
that Gardiner had carefully avoided, in his speech,
the giving to Elizabeth the appellation of the Queen's
sister; and they thence concluded, that a design was formed
of excluding her as illegitimate: They expected, that
Mary, if invested with such a power as she required,
would make a will in her husband's favour, and thereby
render England for ever a province of the Spanish mo∣narchy:
And they were the more alarmed with these
projects, when they heard, that Philip's descent from the
house of Lancaster was carefully insisted on, and that he
was publicly represented as the true and only heir by right
of inheritance.</P>
<P>THE Parliament, therefore, aware of their danger,
were determined to keep at a distance from the precipice,
which lay before them. They could not avoid ratifying
the articles of marriage<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. 2.</NOTE>, which were drawn very favour∣able
for England; but they declined passing any such law
as the chancellor pointed out to them: They would not
so much as declare it treason to imagine or attempt the
death of the Queen's husband, while she was alive; and
a bill introduced for that purpose was laid aside after the
first reading. The more effectually to cut off Philip's
hopes of exerting any authority in England, they passed
a law, in which they declared, “that her majesty as their
only Queen, should solely and as a sole Queen, enjoy
<PB N="425" REF="457"/>
the crown and sovereignty of her realms, with all the
pre-eminences, dignities, and rights thereto belong∣ing,
in as large and ample a manner after her mar∣riage
as before, without any title or claim accruing to
the prince of Spain, either as tenant by courtesy of the
realm, or by any other means<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. I.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>A LAW passed in this Parliament for re-erecting the
bishopric of Durham, which had been dissolved by the
last Parliament of Edward<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ib. cap. 3.</NOTE>. The Queen had already,
by an exertion of her absolute power, put Tonstal in
possession of that see: But tho' it was usual at that time
for the crown to assume authority which might seem
entirely legislative, it was always deemed more safe and
satisfactory to procure the sanction of Parliament. Bills
were introduced for suppressing erroneous opinions con∣tained
in books, and for reviving the law of the six ar∣ticles,
together with those against the Lollards, against
heresy and erroneous preaching: But none of these laws
could pass the two houses. A proof, that the Parliament
had reserves even in their concessions with regard to re∣ligion;
about which they seem to have been less scrupu∣lous.
The Queen, therefore, finding that they would
not serve all her purposes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th May.</NOTE> finished the session by dissolving
them.</P>
<P>MARY's thoughts were now entirely employed about re∣ceiving
Don Philip, whose arrival she hourly expected.
This princess, who had lived so many years in a very re∣served
and private manner, without any prospect or hopes
of a husband, was so smit with affection for her young
spouse, whom she had never seen, that she waited with
the utmost impatience for the completion of the marriage;
<PB N="426" REF="458"/>
and every obstacle was to her a source of anxiety and dis∣content<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. iii. p. 125.</NOTE>. She complained of Philip's delays as affected;
and she could not conceal her vexation, that, though she
brought him a kingdom as a dowry, he treated her with
such neglect, that he had never yet favoured her with a
single letter. Her fondness was but the more encreased
by this supercilious treatment; and when she found that
her subjects had entertained the greatest aversion for the
event, to which she directed her fondest wishes, she made
the whole English nation the object of her resentment.
A squadron, under the command of lord Essingham, had
been fitted out to convoy Philip from Spain, where he
then resided; but the admiral informing her, that the
discontents ran very high among the seamen, and that
it was not safe for Philip to entrust himself into their
hands, she gave orders to dismiss them. She then dread∣ed,
that the French fleet, being masters of the sea, might
intercept her husband; and every rumour of danger, every
blast of wind, threw her into panics and convulsions.
Her health, and even her understanding, were visibly
impaired by this extreme impatience; and she was struck
with a new apprehension, lest her person, impaired by
time, and blasted by sickness, should render her less ac∣ceptable
to her future spouse. Her glass discovered to
her how hagard she was become, and when she remarked
the decay of her person, she knew not whether she ought
more to desire or apprehend the arrival of Philip.</P>
<P>AT last came the moment so impatiently expected;
and news were brought the Queen of Philip's arrival at
Southampton<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 99. Heylin, p. 39. Burnet, vol. iii. p. 392. Godwin, p. 345. We are told by Sir William Monson, p. 225, that the admiral of England fired at the Spanish navy, when Philip was on board; because they had not lowered their topsails, as a mark of defe∣rence to the English navy in the narrow seas. A very spirited behaviour, and very unlike those times.</NOTE>. A few days after, they were married in
<PB N="427" REF="459"/>
Westminster; and having made a pompous entry into
London, where Philip displayed his wealth with great
ostentation, she carried him to Windsor, the palace in
which they afterwards resided. The prince's behaviour
was ill calculated to cure the prejudices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th July. Philip's ar∣rival in England.</NOTE> which the Eng∣lish
nation had entertained against him. He was distant
and reserved in his address; took no notice of the salutes
even of the most considerable noblemen; and so en∣trenched
himself in forms and ceremonies, that he was in
a manner inaccessible<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Baker, p. 320.</NOTE>: But this circumstance rendered
him the more acceptable to the Queen, who desired to
have no company but her husband's, and who was impa∣tient
when she met with any interruption to her fondness.
The shortest absence gave her vexation; and when he
showed civilities to any other woman, she could not con∣ceal
her jealousy and resentment.</P>
<P>THE Queen soon found, that Philip's ruling passion
was ambition; and that the only method of gratifying
him and securing his affections was to render him master
of England. The interest and liberty of her people were
considerations of small moment, in comparison of her
obtaining this favourite point. She summoned a new
Parliament, in hopes of finding them entirely compliant;
and that she might acquire the greater authority over
them, she imitated the precedent of the former reign,
and wrote circular letters directing a proper choice of
members<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Cranm. p. 344. Strype's Eccl. Mem, vol. iii. p. 154, 155.</NOTE>. The zeal of the catholics, the influence of
Spanish gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th November.</NOTE> the powers of prerogative, the discourage∣ment
of the gentry, particularly of the protestants; all these
<PB N="428" REF="460"/>
causes, seconding the intrigues of Gardiner, had procured
her a house of commons which was, in a great measure,
to her satisfaction; and it was thought, from the disposi∣tion
of the nation, that she might now safely omit, in
her summons of the Parliament, the title of <HI>supreme head
of the church,</HI> though inseparably annexed by law to the
crown of England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 291. Strype, vol. iii. p. 155.</NOTE>. Cardinal Pole was arrived in Flan∣ders,
invested with legantine power from the pope: In
order to prepare the way for his arrival in England, the
Parliament passed an act, reversing his attainder, and re∣storing
his blood; and the Queen, dispensing with the old
statute of provisors, granted him permission to act as le∣gate.
The cardinal came over to London; and after
being introduced to the King and Queen, he invited the
Parliament to reconcile themselves and the kingdom to
the apostolic see, from which they had been so long and
so unhappily separated. This message was taken in good
part: and both houses voted an address to Philip and
Mary, acknowledging that they had been guilty of a most
horrible defection from the true church; professing a sin∣cere
repentance for their past transgressions; declaring
their resolution to repeal all laws enacted in prejudice of
the church of Rome; and praying their majesties, that
since they were happily uninfected with that criminal
schism, they would intercede with the holy father for
their absolution and forgiveness<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 3. Heylin, p. 42. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 293. Godwin, p. 247.</NOTE>. Their request was
easily granted. The legate, in name of his holiness,
gave the Parliament and kingdom absolution, freed them
from all censures, and received them again into the bosom
of the church. The pope, then Julius the third, being
informed of these transactions, said, that it was an un∣exampled
instance of his felicity, to receive thanks from
<PB N="429" REF="461"/>
the English, for allowing them to do what he ought to
give them thanks for performing<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the extreme zeal of those times,
for and against popery, the object always uppermost with
the nobility and gentry, was their money and estates;
and they were not brought to make these concessions in
favour of Rome, till they had received repeated assur∣ances,
from the pope as well as the Queen, that the
plunder which they had made of the ecclesiastics, should
never be enquired into; and that the abbey and church
lands should remain with the present possessors<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 41.</NOTE>. But
not trusting altogether to these promises, the Parliament
took care, in the law itself<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 8.</NOTE>, by which they repealed the
former statutes enacted against the pope's authority, to
insert a clause, in which, besides bestowing validity on
all marriages celebrated during the schism, and fixing the
right of incumbents to their benefices, they gave security
to the possessors of church lands, and freed them from
all danger of ecclesiastical censures. The convocation
also, in order to remove all apprehensions on that head,
were induced to present a petition to the same purpose<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 43. I &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 8. Strype, vol. iii. p. 159.</NOTE>;
and the legate, in his master's name, ratified all these
transactions. It now appeared, that, notwithstanding the
efforts of the Queen and King, the power of the papacy
was effectually suppressed, and invincible barriers fixed
against its re-establishment. For though the jurisdiction
of the ecclesiastics was, for the present, restored, their
property, on which their power much depended, was ir∣retrievably
lost, and no hopes remained of recovering it.
Even these arbitrary, powerful, and bigotted princes,
while the transactions were yet recent, could not regain
<PB N="430" REF="462"/>
to the church her possessions so lately ravished from her;
and no expedients were left the clergy for enriching
themselves, but those which they had at first practised,
and which had required many ages of ignorance, barba∣rism,
and superstition to operate their effect on man∣kind<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The pope at first gave cardinal Pole powers to transact only with regard to the past fruits of the church lands; but being admonished of the danger attending any attempt towards a resumption of the lands, he enlarged the cardinal's power, and granted him authority to ensure the future possession of the church lands to the present proprietors. There was only one clause in the cardinal's powers that has given oc∣casion for some speculation. An exception was made of such cases as Pole should think important enough to merit the being communicated to the holy see. But Pole simply ratified the possession of the whole church lands; and his commission had given him full powers to that purpose. See Harleyan Miscellany, vol. vii. p. 264, 266. It is true, some councils have declared, that it exceeds even the power of the pope to alienate any church lands; and the pope, according to his convenience, may either adhere to or recede from this declaration.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament having secured their own possessions,
were more indifferent with regard to religion, or even
the lives of their fellow-citizens; and they revived the
old sanguinary laws against heretics<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">I &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 6.</NOTE>, which had been
rejected in the former Parliament. They also enacted
several laws against seditious words and rumours<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 3, 9.</NOTE>; and
they made it treason to imagine or attempt the death of
Philip, during his marriage with the Queen<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">I &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 10.</NOTE>. Each
Parliament hitherto had been induced to go a step farther
than their predecessors; but none of them had entirely
lost all regard to national interests. Their hatred against
the Spaniards, as well as their suspicion of Philip's pre∣tensions,
still prevailed; and though the Queen attempted
to get her husband declared presumptive heir of the crown,
<PB N="431" REF="463"/>
and to have the administration put into his hands; she
failed in all her hopes, and could not so much as procure
the Parliament's consent to his coronation<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 348. Baker, p. 322.</NOTE>. All at∣tempts
likewise to obtain subsidies from the commons, in
order to support the emperor in his war against France,
proved fruitless; and the usual animosity and jealousy of
the English against that kingdom, seemed to have given
place, for the present, to like passions against Spain.
Philip, sensible of the prepossessions entertained against
him, endeavoured to acquire popularity by procuring the
release of several prisoners of distinction; the lord Henry
Dudley, Sir George Harper, Sir Nicholas Throcmorton,
Sir Edmond Warner, Sir William St. Lo, Sir Nicholas
Arnold, Harrington, Tremaine, who had been confined
from the suspicions or resentment of the court<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 39. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 287. Stowe, p. 626.</NOTE>. But
nothing was more agreeable to the nation than his protec∣tion
of the lady Elizabeth, from the spite and malice of
the Queen, and the restoring her to liberty. This mea∣sure
was not the effect of any generosity in Philip, a sen∣timent
of which he was wholly incapable; but of a re∣fined
policy, which made him foresee, that, if that princess
were put to death, the next lawful heir was the Queen
of Scots, whose succession would for ever annex England
to the crown of France. The earl of Devonshire also
reaped some benefit from the affected popularity of Philip,
and recovered his liberty: But that nobleman, finding
himself exposed to suspicion, begged permission to travel<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 40. Godwin, p. 349.</NOTE>;
and he soon after died in Padua, from poison, as is pre∣tended,
given him by the Imperialists. He was the
eleventh and last earl of Devonshire of that noble family,
allied to the royal family of France.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="464"/>
THE Queen's extreme desire of having issue, had made
her fondly give credit to any appearance of her pregnancy;
and when the legate was introduced to her, she fancied,
that she felt the embryo stir in her womb. Her flatterers
compared this motion of the infant to that of John the
Baptist, who leaped in his mother's belly at the salutation
of the virgin<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 292. Godwin, p. 348.</NOTE>. Dispatches were immediately sent to in∣form
foreign courts of this event: Orders were issued to
give public thanks: Great rejoicings were made: The
family of the young prince was already settled<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 46.</NOTE>; for the
catholics held themselves assured that the child was to be
a male: And Bonner, bishop of London, made public
prayers be said, that Heaven would please to render him
beautiful, vigorous, and witty. But the nation remained
still somewhat incredulous; and men were persuaded,
that the Queen laboured under infirmities, which render∣ed
her incapable of having children. Her infant proved
only the commencement of a dropsy, which the disor∣dered
state of her health had brought upon her. The
belief, however, of her pregnancy was still maintained
with all possible care; and was one artifice, by which
Philip endeavoured to support his authority in the king∣dom.
The Parliament passed a law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1555.</NOTE> which, in case of
the Queen's death, appointed him protector during the
minority; and the King and Queen, finding they could
obtain no further concessions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 January.</NOTE> came unexpectedly to
Westminster Hall, and dissolved them.</P>
<P>THERE happened a remarkable affair this session,
which must not be passed over in silence. Several mem∣bers
of the lower house, dissatisfied with the measures of
the Parliament, but finding themselves unable to prevent
them, made a secession, in order to show their disappro∣bation,
<PB N="433" REF="465"/>
and refused any longer to attend the house<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Coke's Institutes, part iv, p. 17. Strype's Memor. vol. iii. p. 165.</NOTE> For
this instance of contumacy they were indicted in the
King's-bench after the dissolution of the Parliament: Six
of them submitted to the mercy of the court, and paid
their fines: The rest traversed; and the Queen died be∣fore
the affair was brought to an issue. Judging of the
matter by the subsequent pretensions of the house of
commons, and, indeed, by the true principles of a free
government, this attempt of the Queen's ministers must
be regarded as a breach of privilege; but it gave little
umbrage at that time, and was never called in question
by any future house of commons which sat during this
reign.</P>

<P>THE success which Gardiner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXVII.</NOTE> from his cautious and
prudent conduct, had met with in governing the
Parliament, and engaging them both to approve of the
Spanish alliance, and the re-establishment of the ancient
religion, two points, to which, it was believed, they
bore an extreme aversion, had so raised his character for
wisdom and policy, that his opinion was received as an
oracle in the Queen's councils; and his authority, as it
was always great in his own party, no longer suffered
any opposition or controul. Cardinal Pole himself, tho'
more beloved on account of his virtue and candour, and
tho' superior in birth and station, had not equal weight
in public deliberations; and while his learning, piety,
and humanity were extremely respected, he was repre∣sented
more as a good man than a great minister. A very
important question was frequently debated, before the
Queen and council, by these two ecclesiastics; whether
the laws lately revived against heretics should be put in
execution, or should only be employed to restrain, by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rror, the bold attempts of these zealots. Pole was very
<PB N="435" REF="467"/>
sincere in his religious principles; and tho' his modera∣tion
had made him be suspected at Rome of a tendency
towards Lutheranism; he was seriously persuaded of the
catholic doctrines, and thought that no consideration of
human policy ought ever to come in competition with
such important interests. Gardiner, on the contrary,
had always made his religion subservient to his schemes
of safety or advancement; and by his unlimited com∣plaisance
to Henry, he had shown, that, had he not been
pushed to extremity under the late minority, he was suf∣ficiently
disposed to make a sacrifice of his principles to
the established theology. This was the well-known
character of these two great counsellors; yet such is the
prevalence of temper above system, that the benevolent
disposition of Pole led him to advise a toleration of the
heretical tenets which he highly blamed; while the severe
manners of Gardiner inclined him to support, by perse∣cution,
that religion which, at the bottom, he regarded
with great indifference<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 47.</NOTE>. This circumstance of public
conduct was of the highest importance; and from being
the object of deliberation in the council, it soon became
the subject of discourse throughout the nation. We
shall represent, in a few words, the topics by which each
side supported, or might have supported, their scheme of
policy; and shall display the opposite reasons which have
been employed, with regard to an argument that ever
has been, and ever will be so much canvassed.</P>
<P>THE practice of persecution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for and against toleration.</NOTE>said the defenders of
Pole's opinion, is the scandal of all religion; and the
theological animosity, so fierce and violent, far from be∣ing
an argument of men's conviction in their opposite
tenets, is a certain proof, that they have never reached
<PB N="436" REF="468"/>
any serious persuasion with regard to these remote and
sublime subjects. Even those who are the most impatient
of contradiction in other controversies, are mild and
moderate in comparison of polemical divines; and where∣ever
a man's knowlege and experience give him a perfect
assurance of his own opinion, he regards with contempt,
rather than anger, the opposition and mistakes of others.
But while men zealously maintain what they neither
clearly comprehend, nor entirely believe, they are sha∣ken
in their imagined faith, by the opposite persuasion,
or even doubts of other men; and vent on their antago∣nists
that impatience which is the natural result of so dif∣agreeable
a state of the understanding. They then em∣brace
easily any pretence for representing opponents as
impious and prophane; and if they can also find a co∣lour
for connecting this violence with the interests of civil
government, they can no longer be restrained from giv∣ing
uncontrouled scope to vengeance and resentment.
But surely never enterprize was more unfortunate than
that of founding persecution upon policy, or endeavour∣ing,
for the sake of peace, to settle an entire uniformity
of opinion, in questions which, of all others, are least
subjected to the criterion of human reason. The univer∣sal
and uncontradicted prevalence of one opinion in reli∣gious
subjects, can only be owing at first to the stupid
ignorance and barbarism of the people, who never in∣dulge
themselves in any speculation or enquiry; and there
is no other expedient for maintaining that uniformity, so
fondly fought after, but by banishing for ever all curio∣sity
and all improvement in science and cultivation. It
may not, indeed, appear difficult to check, by a steady
severity, the first beginnings of controversy; but besides
that this policy exposes for ever the people to all the ab∣ject
terrors of superstition, and the magistrate to the end∣less
encroachments of ecclesiastics, it also renders men so
<PB N="437" REF="469"/>
delicate, that they can never endure to hear of opposition;
and they will some time pay dearly for that false tranquil∣lity
in which they have been so long indulged. As
healthful bodies are ruined by too nice a regimen, and are
thereby rendered incapable of bearing the unavoidable
incidents of human life; a people who never were allowed
to imagine, that their principles could be contested, fly
out into the most outrageous violence when any event
(and such events are common) produces a faction among
their clergy, and gives rise to any difference in tenet or
opinion. But whatever may be said in favour of suppres∣sing,
by persecution, the first beginnings of heresy, no
solid argument can be alledged for extending severity to∣wards
multitudes, or endeavouring, by capital punish∣ments,
to extirpate an opinion, which has diffused itself
through men of every rank and station. Besides the ex∣treme
barbarity of such an attempt, it proves commonly
ineffectual to the purpose intended; and serves only to
make men more obstinate in their persuasion, and to en∣crease
the number of their proselytes. The melancholy
with which the fear of death, torture, and persecution
inspires the sectaries, is the proper disposition for fostering
religious zeal: The prospect of eternal rewards, when
brought near, overpowers the dread of temporal punish∣ment:
The glory of martyrdom stimulates all the more
furious zealots, especially the leaders and preachers:
Where a violent animosity is excited by oppression, men
pass naturally from hating the persons of their tyrants, to
a more violent abhorrence of their doctrines: And the
spectators, moved with pity towards the supposed martyrs,
are naturally seduced to embrace those principles which
can inspire men with a constancy that appears almost
supernatural. Open the door to toleration, the mutual
hatred relaxes among the sectaries; their attachment to
<PB N="438" REF="470"/>
their particular religion decays; the common occupations
and pleasures of life succeed to the acrimony of disputa∣tion;
and the same man, who, in other circumstances,
would have braved flames and tortures, is engaged to
change his religion from the smallest prospect of favour
and advancement, or even from the frivolous hopes of
becoming more fashionable in his principles. If any ex∣ception
can be admitted to this maxim of toleration, it
will only be where a theology altogether new, nowise
connected with the ancient religion of the state, is im∣ported
from foreign countries, and may easily, at one
blow, be eradicated, without leaving the seeds of future
innovations. But as this instance would involve some
apology for the ancient pagan persecutions, or for the
extirpation of Christianity in China and japan; it ought
surely, on account of this detested consequence, to be
rather buried in eternal silence and oblivion.</P>
<P>THOUGH these arguments appear entirely satisfac∣tory,
yet such is the subtilty of human wit, that Gardiner,
and the other enemies to toleration, were not reduced to
silence, and they still found topics on which to support
the controversy. The doctrine, said they, of liberty of
conscience is founded on the most flagrant impiety, and
supposes such an indifference among all religions, such an
obscurity in theological doctrines, as to render the church
and magistrate incapable of distinguishing, with certainty,
the dictates of Heaven from the mere fictions of human
imagination. If the Divinity reveals principles to man∣kind,
he will surely give a criterion by which they may
be ascertained; and a prince, who knowingly allows these
principles to be perverted, or adulterated, is infinitely
more criminal than if he gave permission for the vending
of poison, under the shape of bread, to all his subjects,
Persecution may, indeed, seem better calculated to make
<PB N="439" REF="471"/>
hypocrites than converts; but experience teaches us, that
the habits of hypocrisy often turn into reality; and the
children at least, ignorant of their parents dissimulation,
may happily be educated in more orthodox tenets. It is
absurd, in opposition to considerations of such unspeak∣able
importance, to plead the temporal and frivolous in∣terests
of civil society; and if matters be thoroughly ex∣amined,
even that topic will not appear so certain and
universal in favour of toleration as by some it is repre∣sented.
Where sects arise, whose fundamental principle
on all sides, is to execrate, and abhor, and damn, and
extirpate each other; what choice has the magistrate left
but to take party, and by rendering one sect entirely
prevalent, restore, at least for a time, the public tran∣quillity?
The political body, being here sickly, must
not be treated as if it were in a state of sound health;
and an affected neutrality in the prince, or even a cool
preference, may serve only to encourage the hopes of all
the sects, and keep alive their animosity. The protes∣tants,
far from tolerating the religion of their ancestors,
regard it as an impious and detestable idolatry; and
during the late minority, when they were entirely masters,
enacted very severe, tho' not capital, punishments against
all exercise of the catholic worship, and even against
such as barely abstained from their profane rites and sa∣craments.
Nor are instances wanting of their endea∣vours
to secure an imagined orthodoxy by the most rigor∣ous
executions: Calvin has burned Servetus at Geneva:
Cranmer brought Arians and Anabaptists to the stake:
And if persecution o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kind is to be admitted, the
most bloody and violen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ll surely be allowed the most
justifiable, as the most effectual. Imprisonments, fines,
confiscations, whippings, serve only to irritate the sects,
without disabling them from resistance: But the stake,
<PB N="440" REF="472"/>
the wheel, or the gibbet, must soon terminate in the ex∣tirpation
or banishment of all the heretics, who are in∣clined
to give disturbance, and in the entire silence and
submission of the rest.</P>
<P>THE arguments of Gardiner being more agreeable to
the cruel bigotry of Mary and Philip, were better re∣ceived;
and though Pole pleaded, as is affirmed<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Burn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, vol. ii. Heylin, p. 47. It is not likely, however, that Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s gave any such advice: For he himself was at this very time proceeding with great violence i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> persecuting the reformed in Flanders. Bentivoglio, part i. lib. 1.</NOTE>, the
advice of the emperor, who recommended it to his
daughter-in-law, not to practise violence against the pro∣testants, and desired her to consider his own example,
who, after endeavouring through his whole life to extir∣pate
heresy, had, in the end, reaped nothing but con∣fusion
and disappointment, the scheme of toleration was
entirely rejected. It was determined to let loose the
laws in their full rigour against the reformed religion;
and England was soon filled with scenes of horror, which
have ever since rendered the catholic religion the object
of general detestation, and which prove, that no human
depravity can equal revenge and cruelty, covered with
the mantle of religion.</P>
<P>THE persecutors began with Rogers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violent persecu∣tions in England.</NOTE> who was pre∣bendary
of St. Paul's, and a man eminent in his party for
virtue as well as for learning. Gardiner's plan was first
to attack men of that character, whom, he hoped, ter∣ror
would bend to submission, and whose example, either
of punishment or recantation, would naturally have in∣fluence
on the multitude: But he found a perseverance
and courage in Rogers, which it may seem strange to
find in human nature, and of which all ages, and
all sects, do notwithstanding furnish many examples.
<PB N="441" REF="473"/>
Rogers, beside the care of his own preservation, lay
under other very powerful temptations to compli∣ance:
He had a wife, whom he tenderly loved, and
ten children; yet such was his serenity after his condem∣nation,
that the jailors, it is said, waked him from a
sound sleep, when the hour of his execution approached.
He had desired to see his wife before he died; but Gar∣diner
told him, that he was a priest; he could not pos∣sibly
have a wife: Thus joining insult to cruelty, Ro∣gers
was burnt in Smithfield<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 119. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 302.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HOOPER, bishop of Glocester, had been tried at the
same time with Rogers; but was sent to his own diocese
to be executed. This circumstance was contrived to
strike the greater terror into his flock; but it was a
source of satisfaction to Hooper, who rejoiced in giving
testimony by his death, to that doctrine which he had
formerly taught them. When he was tied to the stake,
a stool was set before him, and the Queen's pardon laid
upon it, which it was still in his power to merit by his
recantation: But he ordered it to be removed; and
chearfully prepared himself for that dreadful punishment
to which he was sentenced. He suffered it in its full se∣verity:
The wind, which was vehement, blew the flame
of the reeds from his body: The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aggots were green, and
did not kindle easily: All his lower parts were consumed,
before his vitals were attacked: One of his hands dropt
off: With the other he continued to beat his breast: He
was heard to pray and exhort the people, till his tongue,
swoln with the violence of his agony, could no longer
permit him utterance. He was three quarters of an
hour in torture, which he bore with inflexible con∣stancy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 145. &amp;c. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 302. Heylin, p. 48, 49. Godwin, p. 349.</NOTE>.</P>

executioners had been so merciful (for that clemency
may more naturally be ascribed to them than to the reli∣gious
zealots) as to tye bags of gunpowder about these
prelates, in order to put a speedy period to their tortures:
The explosion immediately killed Latimer, who was in
an extreme old age: Ridley continued alive during some
time in the midst of the flames<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 318. Heylin, p. 52.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE Hunter, a young man of nineteen, an appren∣tice,
having been seduced by a priest into a dispute, had
unwarily denied the real presence. Sensible of his dan∣ger,
he immediately concealed himself; and Bonner lay∣ing
hold of his father, threatened him with the greatest
severities, if he did not produce the young man to stand
his trial. Hunter, hearing the vexations to which his
father was exposed, voluntarily delivered himself up to
Bonner, and was condemned to the flames by that bar∣barous
prelate.</P>
<P>THOMAS Haukes, when conducted to the stake,
agreed with his friends, that if he found the torture to∣lerable,
he would make them a signal to that purpose in
the midst of the flames. His zeal for the cause in which
he suffered, so supported him, that he stretched out his
arms, the signal agreed on; and in that posture he ex∣pired<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 265.</NOTE>. This example, with many others of like con∣stancy,
encouraged multitudes, not only to suffer, but
even to aspire to martyrdom.</P>
<P>THE tender sex itself, as they have commonly a greater
propensity to religion, produced many instances of the
most inflexible courage in supporting the profession of
it, against all the fury of the persecutors. One execu∣tion
in particular was attended with circumstances which,
even at that time, excited astonishment, by reason of their
<PB N="445" REF="475"/>
unusual barbarity. A woman in Guernsey, being near
the time of her labour when brought to the stake, was
thrown into such agitation by the torture, that her belly
burst, and she was delivered in the midst of the flames.
One of the guards immediately snatched the infant from
the fire, and attempted to save it: But a magistrate who
stood by, ordered it to be thrown back; being deter∣mined,
he said, that nothing should survive which sprung
from such an obstinate and heretical parent<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 747. Heylin, p. 57. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 337.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE persons condemned to these punishments were
not convicted for teaching, or dogmatizing, contrary to
the established religion: They were seized merely on
suspicion; and articles being offered them to subscribe,
they were immediately, upon their refusal, condemned to
the flames<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 306.</NOTE>. These instances of barbarity, so unusual in
the nation, excited horror; the constancy of the martyrs
was the object of admiration; and as men have a prin∣ciple
of equity engraven in their minds, which even false
religion is not able totally to obliterate, they were shocked
to see persons of probity, of honour, of pious dispo∣sitions,
exposed to punishments more severe than were
inflicted on the greatest ruffians, for crimes subversive of
civil society. To exterminate the whole protestant party,
was known to be impossible; and nothing could appear
more iniquitous, than to subject to torture, the most
conscientious and courageous among them; and allow
the cowards and hypocrites to escape. Each martyrdom,
therefore, was equivalent to a hundred sermons against
popery; and men either avoided such horrid spectacles, or
returned from them full of a violent, though secret, in∣dignation
against the persecutors. Repeated orders were
sent from the council, to quicken the diligence of the
<PB N="446" REF="476"/>
magistrates in searching after heretics; and, in some
places, the gentry were obliged to countenance, by their
presence, these barbarous executions. These violences
tended only to render the Spanish government daily more
odious; and Philip, sensible of the hatred which he in∣curred,
endeavoured to remove the reproach from himself
by a very gross artifice: He ordered his confessor to deli∣ver
in his presence a sermon in favour of toleration; a
doctrine somewhat extraordinary in the mouth of a Spa∣nish friar<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 56.</NOTE>. But the court, finding that Bonner, how∣ever
shameless and savage, would not bear alone the
whole infamy, soon threw off the mask; and the unre∣lenting
temper of the Queen, as well as of the King,
appeared without controul. A bold step was even taken
towards the introduction of the inquisition into England. As the bishops' courts, though extremely arbitrary, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> confined by any ordinary forms of law, appeared not
to be invested with sufficient power, a commission was
appointed by authority of the Queen's prerogative, more
effectually to extirpate heresy. Twenty-one persons were named; but any three were armed with the powers
of the whole. The commission runs in these terms;
“That since many false rumours were published among
the subjects, and many heretical opinions were also
spread among them, therefore they were to enquire
into those, either by presentments by witnesses, or
any other political way they could devise, and to search
after all heresies; the bringers in, the sellers, the
readers of all heretical books: They were to examine
and punish all misbehaviours or negligences, in any
church or chappel; and to try all priests that did not
preach the sacrament of the altar; all persons that did
not hear mass, or come to their parish church to ser∣vice,
that would not go in processions, or did not take
<PB N="447" REF="477"/>
holy bread or holy water: And if they found any that
did obstinately persist in such heresies, they were to
put them into the hands of their ordinaries, to be pu∣nished
according to the spiritual laws: Giving the
commissioners full power to proceed, as their discre∣tions
and consciences should direct them, and to use
all such means as they would invent for the searching
of the premises; empowering them also to call before
them such witnesses as they pleased, and to force them
to make oath of such things as might discover what
they sought after<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. Coll. 32.</NOTE>.” Some civil powers were also
given the commissioners to punish vagabonds and quar∣relsome
persons.</P>
<P>TO bring the methods of proceeding in England still
nearer the practice of the inquisition, letters were written
to the lord North, and others, enjoining them, “To
put to the torture such obstinate persons as would not
confess, and there to order them at their discretion<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii. p. 243.</NOTE>.”
Secret spies also, and informers, were employed, accord∣ing
to the practice of that iniquitous tribunal. Instruc∣tions
were given to the justices of peace, “That they
should call secretly before them one or two honest per∣sons
within their limits, or more, at their discretion,
and command them by oath, or otherwise, that they
shall secretly learn and search out such persons as shall
evil-behave themselves in church, or idly, or shall de∣spise
openly by words, the King's or Queen's pro∣ceedings,
or go about to make any commotion, or
tell any seditious tales or news. And also, that the
same persons so to be appointed, shall declare to the
same justices of peace, the ill behaviour of lewd dis∣ordered
persons, whether it shall be for using unlawful
games, and such other light behaviour of such suspect∣ed
<PB N="448" REF="478"/>
persons: And that the same information shall be
given secretly to the justices; and the same justices
shall call such accused persons before them, and exa∣mine
them, without declaring by whom they were
accused. And that the same justices shall, upon their
examination, punish the offenders, according as their
offences shall appea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, upon the accusement and exa∣mination,
by their discretion, either by open punish∣ment
or by good abearing<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii. p. 246, 247.</NOTE>.” In some respects, this
tyrannical edict even exceeded the oppression of the in∣quisition;
by introducing into every part of government,
the same iniquities which that tribunal practises only for
the extirpation of heresy, and which are, in some mea∣sure,
necessary, wherever that end is earnestly pursued.</P>
<P>BUT the court had devised a more expeditious and
summary method of suppressing heresy than even the in∣quisition
itself. They issued a proclamation against books
of heresy, treason, and sedition; and declared, “That
whosoever had any of these books, and did not pre∣sently
burn them, without reading them, or shewing
them to any other person, should be esteemed rebels;
and without any farther delay, be executed by martial
law<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 363. Heylin, p. 79.</NOTE>.” From the state of the English government,
during that period, it is not so much the illegality of
these proceedings, as their violence and their pernicious
tendency, which ought to be the object of our censure.</P>
<P>WE have thrown together almost all the transactions
against heretics, though carried on during a course of
three years; that we may be obliged, as little as possible,
to return to such shocking violences and barbarities. It
is computed, that in that time two hundred and seventy-seven
persons suffered by fire; besides those punished by
<PB N="449" REF="479"/>
imprisonment, fines, and confiscations. Among those
who suffered by fire, were five bishops, twenty-one cler∣gymen,
eight lay gentlemen, eighty-four tradesmen, one
hundred husbandmen, servants, and labourers, fifty-five
women, and four children. This persevering cruelty ap∣pears
astonishing; yet is it much inferior to what has
been practised in other countries. A great author<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE> com∣putes,
that in the Low Countries alone, from the time
that the edict of Charles the fifth was promulgated against
the reformers, there had been fifty thousand persons
hanged, beheaded, buried alive, or burnt, on account of
religion; and that in France the number had also been
considerable. Yet in both countries, as the same author
subjoins, the progress of the new opinions, instead of
being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cked, was rather forwarded by these perse∣cutio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>TH<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing of heretics was a very natural method
of recon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ng the kingdom to the church of Rome, and
little solicitation was requisite to engage the pope to re∣ceive
the strayed flock, from which he reaped such
profit: Yet was there a solemn embassy sent to Rome,
consisting of Sir Anthony Brown, created viscount Mon∣tacute,
the bishop of Ely, and Sir Edward Carne; in
order to carry the submissions of England, and beg to be
re-admitted into the bosom of the catholic church<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 45.</NOTE>. Paul
the fourth, after a short interval, now filled the papal
chair; the most haughty pontiff, that during several ages
had been elevated to that dignity. He was offended, that
Mary still retained among her titles, that of Queen of
Ireland; and he affirmed, that it belonged to him alone,
as he saw proper, either to erect new kingdoms or abo∣lish
the old: But to avoid all dispute with the new con∣verts,
he thought proper to erect Ireland into a kingdom,
<PB N="450" REF="480"/>
and then admitted the title, as if it had been assumed
from his own concession. This was an usual artifice of
the popes to give allowance to what they could not
prevent<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 45. Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE>,
and afterwards pretend, that persons, while
they exercised their own power, were only acting by
authority from the papacy. And though Paul had at first
intended to oblige Mary formally to recede from this
title, before he would bestow it upon her; he found
it wiser to proceed in a more political, and less haughty
manner<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE other point of discussion between the pope and
the English ambassadors was not so easily terminated.
Paul insisted, that the property and possessions of the
church should be restored even to the uttermost farthing:
That whatever belonged to God, could never by any
law be converted to profane uses, and every person who
detained such possessions was in a state of eternal dam∣nation:
That he would willingly, in consideration of
the humble submissions of England, make them a present
of these ecclesiastical revenues; but such a concession
exceeded his power, and the people might be certain
that so great a profanation of holy things would be a
perpetual anathema upon them, and would blast all their
future felicity: That if they would truly shew their filial
piety, they must restore all the privileges and emoluments
of the Roman church, and Peter's pence among the
rest; nor could they expect, that that apostle would open
to them the gates of paradise, while they detained from
him his possessions on earth<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 5. Heylin, p. 45.</NOTE>. These earnest remon∣strances,
being transmitted to England, though they had
little influence on the nation, operated powerfully on
the Queen; and she was determined, in order to ease
<PB N="451" REF="481"/>
her conscience, to restore all the church lands which
were still in the possession of the crown; and the more
to express her zeal, she erected anew some convents and
monasteries, notwithstanding the low condition of the
public revenues. When this measure was debated in
council, some members objected, that if such a con∣siderable
part of the revenue was dismembered, the dig∣nity
of the crown would fall to decay: But the Queen
replied, that she preferred the salvation of her soul to
ten such kingdoms as England<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 53, 65. Hollingshed, p. 1127. Speed, p. 826.</NOTE>. These imprudent
measures would not probably have taken place so easily,
had it not been for the death of Gardiner, which hap∣pened
about this time: The seals were given to Heathe,
archbishop of York; that an ecclesiastic might still be
possessed of that high office, and be better enabled by
his authority to forward the persecutions against the
reformed.</P>
<P>THESE persecutions were now become extremely
odious to the nation; and the effects of the public dis∣contents
appeared in the new Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st Oc∣tober.</NOTE> which was
summoned to meet at Westminster<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 322.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE>. A bill<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">2 and 3 Phil. and Mar. cap. 4.</NOTE> was passed
restoring to the church the tenths and first fruits, and all
the impropriations which remained in the hands of the
crown; but though this matter directly concerned none
but the Queen herself, great opposition was made to the
bill in the house of commons. An application being
made for a subsidy during two years, and for two fif∣teenths,
the latter was refused by the commons; and
many members said, that while the crown was thus de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oiling
itself of its revenues, it was in vain to bestow
riches upon it. The Parliament rejected a bill for obliging
the exiles to return under certain penalties, and another
<PB N="452" REF="482"/>
for incapacitating such as were remiss in the prosecution
of heresy from being justices of peace. The Queen
finding the intractable humour of the commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th De∣cember.</NOTE> thought
proper to dissolve the Parliament.</P>
<P>THE spirit of opposition, which began to prevail in
Parliament, was likely to be the more vexatious to
Mary, as she was otherwise in very bad humour on ac∣count
of her husband's absence, who, tired of her im∣portunate
love and jealousy, and finding his authority ex∣tremely
limited in England, had laid hold of the first op∣portunity
to leave her, and had gone over last summer
to the emperor in Flanders. The indifference and ne∣glect
of her husband, added to the disappointment in her
imagined pregnancy, threw her into a deep melancholy;
and she gave vent to her spleen by enforcing daily the
persecutions against the protestants, and even by expres∣sions
of rage against all her subjects, by whom she knew
herself to be hated, and whose opposition, in refusing an
entire compliance with Philip, was the cause, she be∣lieved,
why he had alienated his affections from her, and
afforded her so little of his company. The less return
her love met with, the more it increased; and she passed
most of her time in solitude, where she gave vent to her
passion, either in tears, or in writing fond epistles to
Philip, who seldom returned her any answer, and scarce
deigned to counterfeit any sentiment of love or even of
gratitude towards her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's ex∣tortions.</NOTE> The chief part of government,
to which she attended, was the extorting money from
her people, in order to satisfy his demands; and as the
Parliament had granted her but a small supply, she had
recourse to expedients the most violent and most irregu∣lar.
She levied a loan of 60,000 pounds upon a thou∣sand
persons, of whose compliance, either on account
of their riches or their affections to her, she held herself
best assured: But that sum not sufficing, she exacted a
<PB N="453" REF="483"/>
general loan of an hundred pounds a-piece on every one
who possessed twenty pounds a year. This grievous im∣position
lay very heavy on the gentry, who were obliged,
many of them, to retrench their expences, and dismiss
their servants, in order to enable them to comply with
her commands: And as these servants, accustomed to
idleness, and having no means of subsistance, betook
themselves very commonly to theft and robbery, the
Queen published a proclamation, by which she obliged
their former masters to take them back to their service.
She levied 60,000 marks from 7000 yeomen, who had
not contributed to the former loan; and she exacted
36,000 pounds more from the merchants. In order to
engage some Londoners to comply the more willingly
with her multiplied extortions, she passed an edict, pro∣hibiting,
for four months, the exporting any English
cloths or kerseys for Flanders; an expedient which pro∣cured
a good market for such as had already sent any
quantity of cloth thither. Her rapaciousness engaged
her to give endless disturbance and interruption to com∣merce.
The English company settled in Antwerp hav∣ing
refused her a loan of 40,000 pounds, she dissembled
her resentment, till she found, that they had bought
and shipped great quantities of cloth for Antwerp fair,
which was approaching: She then laid an embargo on
the ships, and obliged the merchants to grant her a loan
of the 40,000 pounds at first demanded, to engage for
the payment of 20,000 pounds more at a limited time,
and to submit to an arbitrary imposition of twenty shil∣lings
on each piece. Some time after, she was informed,
that the Italian merchants had shipped above 40,000
pieces of cloth for the Levant, for which they were to
pay a crown a piece, the usual imposition: She struck
a bargain with the merchant adventurers in London;
prohibited entirely the foreigners to make any exporta∣tion;
<PB N="454" REF="484"/>
and received, from the English merchants, in
consideration of this iniquity, the sum of 50,000 pounds,
and an imposition of four crowns on each piece of cloth
which they shouid export. She attempted to borrow
great sums abroad; but her credit ran so low, that, tho'
she offered 14 per cent, to the city of Antwerp for a loan
of 30,000 pounds, she could not obtain it, till she con∣strained
the city of London to be surety for her<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 359. Cowper's Chronicle. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 359. Carte, p. 330, 333, 337, 341. Strype's Memor. vol. iii. p. 428, 558. Annals, vol. i. p. 15.</NOTE>. All these violent expedients were employed while she herself
was in profound peace with all the world, and had visi∣bly
no other occasion for money but to supply the de∣mands

her interests.</P>

in Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The empe∣ror resigns his crown.</NOTE> by the voluntary resignation of the em∣peror,
Charles the fifth, who, though still in the vigour
of his age, had taken a disgust to the world, and was
determined to seek, in the tranquillity of retreat, for that
happiness which he had m vain pursued, amidst the tu∣mults
of war, and the restless projects of ambition. He
summoned the states of the Low Countries;<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Octo∣ber.</NOTE> and seating
himself on the throne for the last time, explained to his
subjects the reasons of his resignation, absolved them
from all oaths of allegiance, and devolving his authority
on Philip, told him, that his paternal tenderness made
him weep, when he reflected on the burthen which he
imposed upon him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Thuan, lib. xvi. c. 20.</NOTE>. He inculcated on him the great
and only duty of a prince, the study of his people's hap∣piness; and represented how much preferable it was to
<PB N="455" REF="485"/>
govern, by affection rather than fear, the nations sub∣jected
to his dominion. The cool reflections of age now
discovered to him the emptiness of his former pursuits;
and he found, that the vain schemes of extending his
empire had been the source of endless opposition and dis∣appointment,
had kept himself, his neighbours, and his
subjects in perpetual inquietude, and had frustrated the
sole end of government, the felicity of the nations com∣mitted
to his care; an object which meets with no op∣position,
and which, if steadily pursued, can alone con∣vey
a lasting and solid satisfaction.</P>
<P>A FEW months after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1556.</NOTE> he resigned to Philip his other
dominions; and embarking on board a fleet, sailed to
Spain, and took his journey to St. Just, a monastery in
Estramedura, which, being situated in a happy climate,
and amidst the greatest beauties of nature, he had chosen
for the place of his retreat. When he arrived at Burgos,
he found, by the thinness of his court, and the negligent
attendance of the Spanish grandees, that he was no
longer emperor; and though this observation might con∣vince
him still more of the vanity of the world, and
make him more heartily despise what he had renounced,
he sighed to find that all the former adulation and obei∣sance
had been paid to his fortune, not to his person.
With better reason, was he struck with the ingratitude of
his son Philip, who allowed him to wait a long time for
the payment of the small pension which he had reserved;
and this disappointment in his domestic enjoyments gave
him a very sensible concern. He pursued however his
resolution with inflexible constancy; and shutting himself
up in his retreat, he exerted such self-command, that he
restrained even his curiosity from any enquiry concerning
the transactions of the world, which he had entirely
abandoned. The fencing against the pains and infirmi∣ties
<PB N="456" REF="486"/>
under which he laboured, occupied a great part of
his time; and during the intervals, he employed his lei∣sure
hours either in examining the controversies of the∣ology,
with which his age had been so much agitated,
and which he had hitherto considered only in a political
light, or in imitating the works of renowned artists,
particularly in mechanics, of which he had always been
a great admirer and encourager. He is said to have here
discovered a propensity to the new doctrines; and to have
frequently dropped hints of this unexpected alteration in
his sentiments. Having amused himself with the con∣struction
of clocks and watches, he thence remarked
how impracticable the object was, in which he had so
much employed himself during his grandeur; and how
impossible that he, who never could frame two machines
that would go exactly alike, could ever be able to make
all mankind concur in the same belief and opinion. He
survived his retreat two years.</P>
<P>THE emperor Charles had very early, in the beginning
of his reign, found the difficulty of governing such
distant dominions; and he had made his brother Ferdi∣nand
be elected King of the Romans; with a view of
his succeeding to the imperial dignity, as well as to his
German dominions. But having afterwards enlarged his
views, and formed plans of aggrandizing his family, he
regretted, that he must dismember such considerable
states; and he endeavoured to engage Ferdinand, by the
most tempting offers, and most earnest solicitations,
to yield up his pretensions in favour of Philip. Finding his
attempts fruitless, he had resigned the imperial crown
with his other dignities; and Ferdinand, according to
common form, applied to the pope for his coronation.
The arrogant pontiff refused the demand; and pretended,
that, though, on the death of an emperor, he was obli∣ged
to crown the prince elected, yet in the case of a re∣signation,
<PB N="457" REF="487"/>
the right devolved to the holy see, and it be∣longed
to the pope alone to appoint an emperor. The
conduct of Paul was in every thing conformable to these
lofty pretensions. He thundered always in the ears of
all ambassadors, that he stood in no need of the assistance
of any prince, that he was above all potentates of the
earth, that he would not accustom monarchs to pretend
to a familiarity or equality with him, that it belonged to
him to alter and regulate kingdoms, that he was succes∣sor
of those who had deposed kings and emperors, and
that, rather than submit to any thing below his dignity,
he would set fire to the four corners of the world. He
went so far, as at table, in the presence of many per∣sons,
and even openly, in a public consistory, to say,
that he would not admit any Kings for his companions;
they were all his subjects, and he would hold them under
these feet: So saying, he stamped the ground with his
old and infirm limbs: For he was now past fourscore
years of age<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE world could not forbear making a comparison
between Charles the fifth, a prince, who, though edu∣cated
amidst wars and intrigues of state, had prevented
the decline of age, and had descended from the throne,
in order to set apart an interval for thought and re∣flection,
and a priest, who in the extremity of old age
exulted in his dominion, and from restless ambition and
revenge was throwing all nations into combustion. Paul
had entertained the most inveterate animosity against the
house of Austria; and though a truce of five years had
been concluded between France and Spain, he excited
Henry by his solicitations to break it, and promised to
assist him in recovering Naples and the dominions to
which he laid claim in Italy; a project which had ever
<PB N="458" REF="488"/>
proved fatal to his predecessors. He himself engaged in
hostilities with the duke of Alva, viceroy of Naples;
and the duke of Guise being sent with forces to support
him, the renewal of war between the two crowns seemed
almost inevitable. Philip, though less warlike than his
father, was no less ambitious; and he trusted, that by
the intrigues of the cabinet, where, he believed, his
caution and secrecy and prudence gave him the superi∣ority,
he should be able to subdue all his enemies, and
extend his authority and dominion. For this reason, as
well as from the desire of settling his new empire, he
was desirous to maintain peace with France; but when
he found, that, without sacrificing his honour, it was
impossible for him to overlook the hostile attempts of
Henry, he prepared for war with great industry. In
order to give himself the more advantage, he was desirous
to embark England in the quarrel; and though the
Queen was of herself extremely averse to that design,
he hoped, that the devoted fondness, which, notwith∣standing
repeated instances of his indifference, she still
bore him, would effectually second his applications.
Had the matter indeed depended solely on her, she was
incapable of resisting her husband's commands; but
she had little weight with her council, still less with
her people; and her government, which was every day
becoming more odious, seemed unable to support itself
even during the most profound tranquillity, much more
if a war was kindled with France, and what seemed an
inevitable consequence, with Scotland, supported by that
powerful kingdom.</P>
<P>AN act of barbarity was this year exercised in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of Cran∣mer.</NOTE>
which, added to many other instances of the same kind,
tended to render the government extremely unpopular.
Cranmer had long been detained a prisoner; but the Queen
now determined to bring him to punishment; and in
<PB N="459" REF="489"/>
order the more fully to satiate her vengeance, she resol∣ved
to punish him for heresy, rather than for treason.
He was cited by the pope to stand his trial at Rome; and
though he was known to be kept in close custody at Ox∣ford,
he was, upon his not appearing, condemned as
contumacious. Bonner, bishop of London, and Thirleby
of Ely, were sent down to Oxford to degrade him; and
the former executed that melancholy ceremony with all
the joy and exultation, which suited his savage nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Cranm. p. 375.</NOTE>.
The revenge of the Queen, not satisfied with the eter∣nal
damnation of Cranmer, which she believed inevitable,
and with the execution of that dreadful sentence to which
he was condemned, prompted her also to seek the ruin of
his honour, and the infamy of his name. Persons were
employed to attack him, not in the way of disputation,
against which he was sufficiently armed; but by flattery,
insinuation and address; by representing the dignities to
which his character still entitled him, if he would merit
them by a recantation; by giving hopes of long enjoying
those powerful friends, whom his beneficent disposition
had attached to him during the course of his prosperity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 55. Mem. p. 383.</NOTE>.
Overcome by the fond love of life, terrified by the pros∣pect
of those tortures which awaited him; he allowed,
in an unguarded hour, the sentiments of nature to pre∣vail
over his resolution, and he agreed to sign a paper, in
which he acknowledged the doctrines of the papal su∣premacy
and of the real presence. The court, equally
perfidious and cruel, were determined, that this recant∣ation
should avail him nothing; and they sent orders,
that he should be required to acknowledge his errors in
church before the whole people, and that he should
thence be immediately led to execution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st March.</NOTE>. Cranmer, whe∣ther,
that he had received a secret intimation of their
<PB N="460" REF="490"/>
design, or had repented of his weakness, surprized the
audience by a contrary declaration. He said, that he was
well apprized of the obedience which he owed to his
Sovereign and the laws, but this duty extended no farther
than to submit patiently to their commands, and to bear
without resistance whatever hardships they should impose
upon him: That a superior duty, the duty which he
owed his Maker, obliged him to speak truth on all occa∣sions,
and not to relinquish, by a base denial, the holy
doctrine which the supreme Being had revealed to man∣kind:
That there was one miscarriage in his life, of
which, above all others, he severely repented; the insin∣cere
declaration of faith to which he had the weakness to
consent, and which the fear of death alone had extorted
from him: That he took this opportunity of atoning for
his error, by a sincere and open recantation; and was
willing to seal with his blood that doctrine which he
firmly believed to be communicated from heaven: And
that as his hand had erred by betraying his heart, it should
first be punished, by a severe but just doom, and sould
first pay the forfeit of its offences. He was thence led to
the stake amidst the insults of the catholics; and having
now summoned up all the force of his mind, he bore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
scorn as well as the torture of his punishment with singular
fortitude. He stretched out his hand, and without be∣traying,
either by his countenance or motions, the least
sign of weakness or even of feeling, he held it in the
flames till it was entirely consumed. His thoughts seem∣ed
wholly occupied with reflections on his former fault;
and he called aloud several times, <HI>This hand has offended.</HI>
Satisfied with that atonement, he then discovered a sere∣nity
in his countenance; and when the fire attacked his
body, he seemed to be quite insensible of his outer suffer∣ings,
and by the force of hope and resolution to have
<PB N="461" REF="491"/>
collected his mind altogether within itself, and to repel
the fury of the flames. It is pretended, that, after his
body was consumed, his heart was found entire and un∣touched
amidst the ashes; an event, which, as it was the
emblem of his constancy, was fondly believed by the zeal∣ous
protestants. He was undoubtedly a man of merit;
possessed of learning and capacity; and adorned with can∣dour,
sincerity and beneficence, and all those virtues,
which were fitted to render him useful and amiable in
society. His moral qualities procured him universal re∣spect;
and the courage of his martyrdom, though he fell
short of the rigid inflexibility observed in many, made
him the hero of the protestant party<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 331, 332, &amp;c. Godwin, p. 352.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER Cranmer's death, cardinal Pole, who had now
taken priest's orders, was installed in the see of Canterbury;
and was thus by this office, as well as his commission of
legate, placed at the head of the church of England. But
though he was averse to all the sanguinary methods of
converting heretics, and esteemed the reformation of the
clergy the more effectual, as the more laudable expedient
for that purpose<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 324, 325.</NOTE>; he found his authority too weak to
oppose the barbarous and bigotted disposition of the Queen
and of her counsellors. He himself, he knew, had been
suspected of Lutheranism; and as Paul, the reigning
pope, was a furious persecutor and his personal enemy,
he was prompted, by the modesty of his disposition, to
reserve his credit for other occasions, in which he had
a greater probability of success<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 68, 69. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 327.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE great object of the Queen was to engage the na∣tion
in the war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1557.</NOTE> which was kindled between France and
Spain; and cardinal Pole, with many other counsellors,
<PB N="462" REF="492"/>
very openly and zealously opposed this measure. Besides
insisting on the marriage articles, which provided against
such an attempt, they represented the violence of the do∣mestic
factions in England, and the disordered state of
the finances; and they foreboded, that the tendency of
all these measures was to reduce the kingdom to a total
dependance on Spanish councils. Philip had come to
London in order to support his partizans; and he told
the Queen, that, if he was not gratified in so reasonable
a request, he never more would set foot in England.
This declaration heightened extremely her zeal for pro∣moting
his interests, and overcoming the inflexibility of
her council. After employing other menaces of a more
violent nature, she threatened to dismiss them all from the
board, and to appoint counsellors more obsequious; yet
could she not procure a vote for declaring war with
France. At last, one Stafford and some other conspira∣tors
were detected in a design of surprizing Scarborow<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 72. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 351. Sir James Melvil's Memoirs.</NOTE>; and a confession being extorted from them, that they had
been encouraged by Henry in that attempt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> the Queen's
importunity prevailed; and it was determined to make
this act of hostility, with others of a like secret and
doubtful nature, the ground of the quarrel. War was
accordingly declared against France; and preparations
were every where made for attacking that kingdom.</P>
<P>THE revenue of England at that time little exceeded
300,000 pounds<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rosso, Successi d'Inghilterra.</NOTE>. Any considerable supplies could scarce
be expected from Parliament, considering the present dis∣position
of the nation; and as the war would sensibly
diminish the branch of the customs, the finances, it was
foreseen, would fall short even of the ordinary charges of
the government; much more, prove unequal to the vast
<PB N="463" REF="493"/>
expences of war. But though the Queen owed great
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ears to all her servants, besides the loans extorted from
her subjects; these considerations had no influence on
her, and she continued to levy money in the same arbi∣trary
and violent manner, which she had formerly prac∣tised.
She obliged the city of London to supply her with
60,000 pounds on her husband's entry; she levied before
the legal time the second year's subsidy voted by Parlia∣ment;
she issued anew many privy seals, by which she
procured loans from her people; and having equipped a
fleet, which she could not victual by reason of the dear∣ness
of provisions, she seized all the corn she could find
in Suffolk and Norfolk, without paying any price to the
owners. By all these expedients, assisted by the power
of pressing, she levied art army of ten thousand men,
which she sent over to the Low Countries, under the
command of the earl of Pembroke. Meanwhile, in order
to prevent any disturbance at home, many of the most
considerable gentry were thrown into the Tower; and
lest they should be known, the Spanish practice was fol∣lowed:
They were either carried thither in the night∣time,
or were hood-winked and muffled by the guards
who conducted them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Strype's Eccles. Memorials, vol. iii. p. 377.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of Spain had assembled an army, which,
after the junction of the English, amounted to above
sixty thousand strong, commanded by Philibert, duke of
Savoy, one of the greatest captains of the age. The
constable, Montmorency, who commanded the French
army, had not half the number to oppose him. The
duke of Savoy, after menacing Mariembourg and Rocroy,
sat down suddenly before St. Quintin; and as the place
was weak, and ill provided of a garrison, he expected in
a few days to become master of it. But the admiral
<PB N="464" REF="494"/>
Coligny, governor of the province, thinking his honour
interested to save so important a fortress, threw himself
into St. Quintin, with some troops of French and Scots
gensdarmes; and by his exhortation and example animated
the soldiers to a vigorous defence. He dispatched a messenger
to his uncle, the constable, desiring a supply of men; and
that general approached the place with his whole army,
in order to facilitate the entry of these succours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Aug.</NOTE> But the
duke of Savoy falling on the reinforcement, executed such
slaughter upon them, that not above five hundred men
got into the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of St. Quintin.</NOTE> He next made an attack on the
French army, and put them to a total rout, killing four
thousand men, and dispersing the rest. In this unfortu∣nate
action many of the chief nobility of France were
either slain or taken prisoners: Among the latter was the
old constable himself, who fighting valiantly, and resolute
to die rather than survive his defeat, was surrounded by
the enemy, and thus fell alive into their hands. The
whole kingdom of France was thrown into consternation:
Paris was attempted to be fortified in a hurry: And had
the Spaniards presently marched thither, it could not fail
to have fallen into their hands. But Philip was of a
cautious temper; and he determined first to take St.
Quintin, in order to secure a communication with his
own dominions. A very little time, it was expected,
would finish this enterprize; but the bravery of Coligny
still prolonged the siege seventeen days, which proved the
safety of France. Some troops were levied and assembled.
Couriers were sent to recall the duke of Guise and his
army from Italy: And the French having recovered from
their first alarm, put themselves in a posture of defence.
Philip, after taking Ham and Castelet, found the season
so far advanced, that he could attempt no farther enter∣prize,
and he broke up his camp and retired to winter quarters.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="495"/>
BUT the vigilant activity of Guise, not satisfied with
securing the frontiers, prompted him, in the depth of
winter, to attempt an enterprize which France, during
her greatest successes, had always regarded as impossible,
and had never thought of undertaking. Calais was, in
that age, deemed an impregnable fortress; and as it was
known to be the favourite of the English nation, by
whom it could easily be succoured, the recovery of that
place by France, was considered as totally desperate. But
Coligny had remarked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calaistaken by the French.</NOTE> that, as the town of Calais was
surrounded with marshes, which, during the winter, were
impassible, except over a dyke guarded by two castles,
St. Agatha and Newnam bridge, the English were of
late accustomed, on account of the lowness of their finan∣ces,
to dismiss a great part of the garrison at the end of
autumn, and to recall them in the spring, at which time
alone they judged their attendance necessary. On this
circumstance he had founded his design of making a sud∣den
attack on the place; he had caused it to be secretly
surveyed by some engineers; and a plan of the whole
enterprize being found among his papers, it served, tho'
he himself was made prisoner on the taking of St. Quin∣tin,
to suggest the project of that undertaking, and to
direct the conduct of the duke of Guise.</P>
<P>SEVERAL bodies of troops defiled towards the frontiers
on various pretences;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1558.</NOTE> and the whole being suddenly as∣sembled,
formed an army with which the duke of Guise
made an unexpected march towards Calais. At the same
time a great number of French ships, being ordered into
the channel, under colour of cruising on the English,
composed a fleet which made an attack by sea on the for∣tifications.
The French assaulted St. Agatha with three
thousand harquebusiers; and though the garrison made a
vigorous defence, they were soon obliged to abandon the
<PB N="464" REF="496"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="465" REF="497"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="466" REF="498"/>
place, and retreat towards Newnam bridge. The siege
of this latter place was immediately undertaken, and at
the same time the fleet battered the risbank, which guard∣ed
the entry of the harbour; and both these castles
seemed exposed to imminent danger. The governor, lord
Wentworth, was a brave officer, but finding that the
greater part of his weak garrison was enclosed in New∣nam
or the risbank, he ordered them to capitulate, and to
join him in Calais, which, without their assistance, he
was utterly unable to defend. The garrison of Newnam
bridge were so happy as to effectuate this purpose; but
that of the risbank could not obtain such favourable con∣ditions,
and were obliged to surrender themselves pri∣soners.</P>
<P>THE duke of Guise, now holding the place blockaded
by sea and land, thought himself secure of succeeding in
his enterprize; but in order to prevent all accidents, he
delayed not a moment the attack of the place. He
pointed his batteri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> towards the castle, where he made a
large breach; and having ordered Andelot, Coligny's
brother, to drain the fossée, he commanded an assault,
which succeeded, and the French made a lodgement in
the castle. On the night following Wentworth attempted
to recover this post; but having lost two hundred men in
a furious attack which he made upon it<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. xx. cap. 2.</NOTE>, he found his
garrison so weak, that he was obliged to capitulate. Ham,
and Guisnes fell soon after; and thus the duke of Guise,
in eight days, during the depth of winter, recovered this
important place, that had cost Edward the third a siege
of eleven months, at the head of a numerous army,
which had that very campaign been victorious in the bat∣tle
of Cressy. The English had held it above two hun∣dred
years; and as it gave them, whenever they pleased,
<PB N="467" REF="499"/>
an entry into France, it was regarded as the most impor∣tant
possession belonging to the crown. The joy of the
French was extreme, as well as the glory acquired by the
duke of Guise, who, at the time that all Europe ima∣gined
France to be sunk by the unfortunate battle of St.
Quintin, had, in opposition to the English, and their
allies the Spaniards, acquired possession of a place which
no former King of France, even during the distractions
of the civil wars, between the houses of York and Lan∣caster,
had ever ventured to attempt. The English, on
the other hand, bereaved of this valuable fortress, mur∣mured
loudly against the imprudence of the Queen and
her council; who, after engaging in a fruitless war, for
the sake of foreign interests, had thus exposed the nation
to so severe a disgrace. A treasury exhausted by expen∣ces,
and burthened with debts; a people divided and de∣jected;
a Sovereign negligent of her people's welfare;
were circumstances which, notwithstanding the fair offers
made by Philip, gave them small hopes of recovering Ca∣lais.
And as the Scots, instigated by French councils,
began to move on the borders, they were now necessitated
rather to look to their defence at home, than to think of
foreign conquests.</P>
<P>AFTER the peace, which, in consequence of King
Edward's treaty with Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> took place between Scot∣land
and England, the Queen-dowager, on pretence of
visiting her daughter and her relations, made a journey
to France, and she carried along with her the earls of
Huntley, Sutherland, Marischal, and many of the prin∣cipal
nobility. Her secret design was to take measures
for engaging the earl of Arran to resign to her the govern∣ment
of the kingdom; and as her brothers, the duke of
Guise, the cardinal of Lorraine, and the duke d'Aumale,
had uncontrouled authority in the court of France, she
<PB N="468" REF="500"/>
easily persuaded Henry, and by his means the Scots no∣bles,
to enter into her measures. Having also gained over
Carnegy of Kinnaird, Panter, bishop of Ross, and Gavin
Hamilton, commendator of Kilwinning, three creatures
of the governor's, she persuaded him, by their means, to
consent to this resignation<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. xiv. Keith, p. 56. Spotswood, p. 92.</NOTE>; and when every thing was
thus prepared for her purpose, she took her journey to
Scotland, and passed through England in her way thither.
Edward received her with great respect and civility; tho'
he could not forbear attempting a renewal of the old
treaty for his marriage with her daughter: A marriage,
he said so happily calculated for the tranquillity, interest,
and security of both kingdoms, and the only means of
ensuring a durable peace between them. For his part,
he added, he never could entertain a cordial amity for any
other husband whom she should choose; nor was it easy
for him to forgive a man, who, at the same time that he
disappointed so natural an alliance, had bereaved him of a
bride, to whom his affections, from his earliest infancy,
had been entirely engaged. The Queen eluded these ap∣plications,
by telling him, that if any measures had been
taken disagreeable to him, they were entirely owing to
the imprudence of the duke of Somerset, who, instead of
imploying courtesy, caresses, and gentle offices, the pro∣per
means of gaining a young princess, had had recourse
to arms and violence, and had constrained the Scots no∣bility
to send their sovereign into France, in order to in∣terest
that kingdom in protecting their liberty and inde∣pendence<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the Queen-dowager arrived in Scotland, she
found the governor very unwilling to fulfil his engage∣ments;
and it was not till after many delays that he could be
<PB N="469" REF="501"/>
persuaded to resign his authority. But finding that the
majority of the young princess was approaching, and that
the Queen-dowager had gained the affections of all the
principal nobility, he thought it more prudent to submit;
and having stipulated, that he should be declared next
heir to the crown, and should be freed from giving any
account of his past administration, he placed her in pos∣session
of the power; and she thenceforth assumed the
name of regent<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">12 April 1554.</NOTE>. It was an usual saying of this princess,
that provided she could render her friends happy, and
could ensure to herself a good reputation, she was entirely
indifferent what befel her; and though this sentiment is
greatly censured by the zealous reformers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 89.</NOTE>, as being
founded wholly on secular motives, it discovers a mind
well calculated for the administration of kingdoms.
D' Oisel, a Frenchman, celebrated for capacity, had at∣tended
her as ambassador from Henry, but in reality to
assist her with his counsels in so delicate an undertaking as
the government of Scotland; and this man had formed a
scheme for laying a general tax on the kingdom, in
order to support a standing military force, which might
at once repulse the inroads of foreign enemies, and check
the turbulence of the Scots nobility. But though some
of the courtiers were gained over to this project, it gave
great and general discontent to the nation; and the
Queen-regent, after ingenuously confessing, that it would
prove pernicious to the kingdom, had the prudence to
desist from it, and to trust entirely for her security to the
good-will and affections of her subjects<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 70. Buchanan, lib. xvi.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS laudable purpose seemed to be the chief object
of her administration; yet was she sometimes drawn from
it by her connections with France, and by the influence
<PB N="470" REF="502"/>
which her brothers had acquired over her. When Mary
declared war against that kingdom, Henry required the
Queen-regent to take part in the quarrel; and she sum∣moned
a convention of states at Newbottle, and requested
them to concur in a declaration of war against England.
The Scots nobles, who were as jealous of French as
the English were of Spanish influence, refused their assent;
and the Queen was obliged to have recourse to artifice,
in order to effectuate her purpose. She ordered d' Oisel
to begin some fortifications at Eymouth, a place which
had been dismantled by the last treaty with Edward; and
when the garrison of Berwic, as she foresaw, made an
inroad to prevent the undertaking, she effectually em∣ployed
this pretence to inflame the Scots nation, and to
engage them in hostilities against England<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. xvi. Thuan. lib. xix. c. 7.</NOTE>. The enter∣prize,
however, of the Scots proceeded no farther than
some inroads on the borders; and when d' Oisel, of
himself, conducted artillery and troops of besiege the castle
of Werke, he was recalled, and very sharply rebuked by
the council<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Knox, p 93.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to connect Scotland more closely with France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the dauphin and the Queen of Scots.</NOTE>
and to encrease the influence of the latter kingdom, it was
thought proper by Henry to compleat the marriage be∣tween
the young Queen and the dauphin; and a deputa∣tion
was sent by the Scots Parliament, to assist at this
ceremony, and to settle the terms of the contract. This
deputation consisted of the archbishop of Glasgow, the
bishops of Ross and the Orkneys, the earls of Rothes,
and Cassilis, the lords Fleming and Seton, James Stuart,
prior of St Andrews, natural brother to the Queen, and
Erskine of Dun. The principal conditions recommended
to these commissioners, was to obtain a solemn engage∣ment
<PB N="471" REF="503"/>
from the Queen and dauphin, that they would pre∣serve
the laws and privileges of Scotland, and to procure
a renewal of the French King's promise, to support, in
case of the Queen's death, the succession of the earl of
Arran, now created duke of Chatelraut. Both these
conditions were easily obtained; but the court of France
took a very perfidious step, directly contrary to these sti∣pulations:
They secretly engaged the young Queen to
sign three papers; by one of which she made over the
kingdom of Scotland in gift to the King of France, in
case of her decease without children; by another, she
mortgaged it to him for a million of crowns of gold, or
such greater sum as he should have expended for her
maintenance and support; and by a third she declared,
that whatever deed she had been obliged, or should here∣after
be obliged to perform, relative to the succession of the
crown, should be entirely invalid, and that her real
sense and intention was contained in the first paper.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 April.</NOTE> The
marriage was solemnized at Paris: The commissioners,
in the name of the states of Scotland, swore allegiance
to the Queen, and, during the continuance of the mar∣riage,
to the King-dauphin, so he was called: And
every thing seemed to proceed with great unanimity and
concord. But the commissioners being required to deliver
up the crown, and other ensigns of royalty, made answer,
that they had received no authority for that purpose; and
they soon after set out on their journey for Scotland. It
is remarkable, that before they embarked, four of the
commissioners died, within a few days of each other;
and a violent, though absurd suspicion prevailed, that
they had been poisoned by orders from the family of Guise,
on account of this refusal<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. xvi. Keith, p. 75. Spotswood, p 95.</NOTE>. It was not considered, that
that accident, however rare, might have happened by the
<PB N="472" REF="504"/>
course of nature; and that the present season, though
not attended with any pestilential disorder, was, to a re∣markable
degree, unhealthy all over Europe.</P>
<P>THE close alliance between France and Scotland
threatned very nearly the repose and security of England;
and it was foreseen, that, though the factions and dis∣orders
which might naturally be expected in the Scots
government during the absence of their sovereign, would
make its power less formidable, that kingdom would at
least afford to the French a means of invading England.
The Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Jan.</NOTE> therefore, found it necessary to summon a
Parliament, and to demand of them some supplies to her
exhausted exchequer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> As such an emergency usually gives
great advantage to the people, and as the Parliaments,
during this reign, had shewn, that, where the liberty
and independency of the kingdom were menaced with
imminent danger, they were not entirely overawed by
the court; we shall naturally expect, that the late arbi∣trary
methods of extorting money should, at least, be
censured, and, perhaps, some remedy be for the future
provided against them. But such an exorbitant preroga∣tive
was at this time acknowleged to belong to the crown,
that, though men might complain of its present abuses,
all attempts to retrench it would have been regarded as
the most criminal enterprize; and as that prerogative
involved a large discretionary power, any parliamentary
enquiry into its exercise, would have passed for insolent
and presumptuous. The commons, therefore, without
making any reflections on the past, voted, besides a fif∣teenth,
a subsidy of four shillings in the pound on land,
and two shillings and eight pence on goods. The clergy
granted eight shillings in the pound, payable in four years
by equal portions.</P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="505"/>
THE Parliament also passed an act, confirming all the
sales and grants of crown lands, which were either made
already by the Queen, or should be made during the
seven ensuing years. It was easy to foresee, that, in the
Queen's present disposition and situation, this power would
be followed by a great alienation of the royal demesnes;
and nothing could be more contrary to the principles of
good government, than a prince armed with very exten∣sive
authority, and yet reduced to beggary. This act
met with opposition in the house of commons. One
Copley expressd his fears lest the Queen, under colour
of the power there granted, might alienate the crown
from the lawful heir: But his words were thought <HI>irre∣verent</HI>
to her majesty: He was committed to the custody
of the serjeant at arms; and though he expressed sorrow
for his offence, he was not released till the Queen was
applied to for his pardon.</P>
<P>THE English nation, during this whole reign, were
in continual apprehensions with regard not only to the
succession, but the life of the lady Elizabeth. The vio∣lent
hatred which the Queen bore her, broke out on
every occasion; and it required all the authority of Philip,
as well as her own great prudence, to prevent the fatal
effects of it. The princess retired into the country; and
knowing that she was surrounded with spies, she past her
time wholly in reading and study, intermeddled in no
business, and saw very little company. While she re∣mained
in this situation, which was for the present very
melancholy, but which prepared her mind for those great
actions by which her life was afterwards so much distin∣guished;
proposals of marriage were made her by the
Swedish ambassador, in his master's name. As her first
question was, whether the Queen had been informed of
these proposals; the ambassador told her, that his master
<PB N="474" REF="506"/>
thought, as he was a gentleman, it was his duty first to
make his addresses to herself; and having obtained her
consent, he would next as a King, apply to her sister.
But the princess would allow him to proceed no further;
and the Queen, after thanking her for this instance of
duty, desired to know how she stood affected to the Swe∣dish
proposals. Elizabeth, though exposed to many pre∣sent
dangers and mortifications, had the magnanimity to
reserve herself for better fortune; and she covered her
refusal with professions of a passionate attachment to a
single life, which, she said, she infinitely preferred be∣fore
any other<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. Collect. N<SUP>o</SUP> 37.</NOTE>. The princess showed like prudence in
concealing her sentiments of religion, in complying with
the present modes of worship, and in eluding all questions
with regard to that delicate subject<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>The common net at that time, says Sir Richard Baker, for catching of protestants, was the real presence; and this net was used to catch the lady Elizabeth: For being asked one time what she thought of the words of Christ, <HI>This is my body,</HI> whether she thought it the true body of Christ that was in the Sacrament; it is said, that, after some pausing, she thus answered:
<Q><L>Christ was the word that spake it;</L>
<L>He took the bread and brake it;</L>
<L>And what the word did make it,</L>
<L>That I believe and take it.</L></Q>
Which, though it may seem but a slight expression, yet hath it more solidness than at first sight appears; at least it served her turn at that time, to escape the net, which by direct answer she could not have done. Baker's Chronicle, p. 320.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE money granted by Parliament, enabled the Queen
to fit out a fleet of a hundred and forty sail, which, being
joined by thirty Flemish ships, and carrying six thousand
land sorces on board, was sent to make an attempt on the
coast of Brittany. The fleet was commanded by lord
<PB N="475" REF="507"/>
Clinton; the land forces by the earls of Huntingdon and
Rutland. But the equipment of the fleet and army was
so dilatory, that the French got intelligence of the design,
and were prepared to receive them. The English found
Brest too well guarded to make an attempt on that place;
but landing at Conquet, they plundered and burnt the
town with some adjoining villages, and were proceeding
to commit greater disorders, when Kersimon, a Breton
gentleman, at the head of some militia, fell upon them,
put them to rout, and drove them to their ships with
considerable loss. But a small squadron of ten English
ships, had an opportunity of amply revenging this dis∣grace
upon the French. The Mareschal de Thermes,
governor of Calais, had made an irruption into Flanders,
with an army of fourteen thousand men; and having
forced a passage over the river Aa, had taken Dunkirk,
and Berg St. Winoc, and had advanced as far as New∣port.
But count Egmont coming suddenly upon him,
with superior forces, he was obliged to retire; and be∣ing
overtaken by the Spaniards near Gravelines, he chose
very skilfully his ground for the engagement. He fortified
his left wing with all the precautions possible; and posted
his right along the river Aa, which, he reasonably
thought, gave him a full security from that quarter.
But the English ships, which were accidentally on the
coast, being drawn by the noise of the firing, sailed up the
river, and flanking the French, did such execution by
their artillery, that they put them to flight, and the Spa∣niards
gained a compleat victory<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 1150.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the principal army of France, under
the duke of Guise, and that of Spain, under the duke
of Savoy, approached very near each other on the fron∣tiers
of Picardy; and as the two Kings had come into
<PB N="476" REF="508"/>
their respective camps, attended by the flower of their
nobility, men expected that some great and important
event would follow, from the emulation of these warlike
nations. But Philip, though actuated by ambition, pos∣sessed
not the enterprize, of a conqueror; and he was
willing, notwithstanding the superiority of his numbers,
and the two great victories which he had gained at St.
Quintin and Gravelines, to put a period to the war by a
treaty. Negociations were entered into for that purpose;
and as the terms offered by the two monarchs were some∣what
wide of each other, the armies were put into winter
quarters, till the princes could come to better agree∣ment.
Among other conditions, Henry demanded the
restitution of Navarre to its lawful owner; Philip that
of Calais and its territory to England: But in the midst
of these negociations and debates, news arrived of the
death of Queen Mary; and Philip, no longer connected
with England, began to relax in his instances on that
capital article. This was the only circumstance which
could have made the death of that princess a loss to the
kingdom.</P>
<P>MARY had been long in a very declining state of
health; and having mistaken her dropsy for a pregnancy,
she had made use of an improper regimen, and her ma∣lady
daily augmented. Every reflection now tormented
her: The consciousness of being hated by her subjects,
the prospect of Elizabeth's succession, apprehensions of
the danger to which the catholic religion stood exposed,
dejected for the loss of Calais<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The loss of Calais so much affected her, that she said to her atten∣dants, that when she was dead, they would find Calais at her heart.</NOTE>, concern for the ill state
of her affairs, and, above all, anxiety for the absence of
her husband, who, she knew, intended soon to depart
for Spain, and to settle there during the rest of his life:
<PB N="477" REF="509"/>
All these melancholy circumstances preyed upon her
mind, and threw her into a lingering fever, of which she
died, after a short and unfortunate reign of five years,
four months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Queen. 17th Nov.</NOTE> and eleven days.</P>
<P>IT is not necessary to employ many words in drawing
the character of this princess. She possessed few quali∣ties,
either estimable or amiable; and her person was as
little engaging as her behaviour and address. Obstinacy,
bigotry, violence, cruelty, malignity, revenge, tyranny;
every circumstance of her character took a tincture from
her bad temper and narrow understanding. And amidst
that complication of vices, which entered into her com∣position,
we shall scarce find any virtue but sincerity; a
quality, which she seems to have maintained throughout
her whole life; except in the beginning of her reign,
when the necessity of her affairs obliged her to make
some promises to the protestants, which she certainly
never intended to perform. But in these cases a weak
bigotted woman, under the government of priests, easily
finds casuistry sufficient to justify to herself the violation
of an engagement. She appears also, as well as her
father, to have been susceptible of some attachments of
friendship; and that without the caprice and incon∣stancy
which were so remarkable in the conduct of
that monarch. To which we may add, that, in many
circumstances of her life, she gave indications of reso∣lution
and vigour of mind; a quality, which seems to
have been inherent in her family.</P>
<P>CARDINAL Pole had been long in a declining state
of health from an intermiting fever; and he died the
same day with the Queen, about sixteen hours after
her. The benign character of this prelate, the modesty
and humanity of his deportment, made him be univer∣sally
beloved; insomuch that in a nation, where the
most furious persecution was carried on, and the most
<PB N="478" REF="510"/>
violent religious factions prevailed, entire justice, even
by most of the reformers, has been done to his merit.
The haughty pontiff, Paul the fourth, had entertained
some prejudices against him; and when England declared
war against Henry, the ally of that pope, he seized the
opportunity of revenge, and revoking Pole's legantine
commission, appointed in his room cardinal Peyto, an
observantine friar and confessor to the Queen. But
Mary would never permit the new legate to exercise his
power; and Paul was afterwards obliged to restore car∣dinal
Pole to his authority.</P>
<P>THERE occur few general remarks, besides what have
been already made in the course of our narration, with
regard to the general state of the kingdom during this
reign. The naval power of England was then so incon∣siderable,
that fourteen thousand pounds being ordered
to be applied to the fleet by the treasurer and admiral,
both for repairing and victualling it, they computed,
that, when the money was expended, ten thousand
pounds a year would afterwards answer all necessary
charges<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii. p. 259.</NOTE>. The arbitrary proceedings of the Queen,
abovementioned, joined to many monopolies granted by
this princess, as well as by her father, checked very
much the growth of trade; and so much the more, as
all other princes in Europe either were not permitted or
did not find it necessary to act in so tyrannical a manner.
Acts of Parliament, both in the last reign and in the
beginning of the present, had laid the same impositions
on the merchants of the still-yard as on other aliens:
Yet the Queen, immediately after her marriage, com∣plied
with the solicitations of the emperor, and, by her
prerogative, suspended these acts of Parliament<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xv. p. 364.</NOTE>. No
body in that age pretended to question this exercise of
<PB N="479" REF="511"/>
the prerogative. The historians are entirely silent with
regard to it; and it is only by the collection of public
papers that it is handed down to us.</P>
<P>AN absurd law had been made in the preceding reign,
by which every one was prohibited from making cloth
unless he had served an apprenticeship for seven years.
This law was repealed in the first year of the Queen's
reign; and this plain reason given, that it had occasioned
the decay of the woollen manufactory, and had ruined
several towns<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. 7.</NOTE>. It is strange that Edward's law should
have been revived during the reign of Elizabeth; and
still more strange, that it should still subsist.</P>
<P>A PASSAGE to Archangel had been discovered by the
English during the last reign; and a beneficial trade with
Muscovy had been established. A solemn embassy was
sent by the Czar to Queen Mary. The ambassadors
were shipwrecked on the coast of Scotland; but being
hospitably entertained there, they proceeded on their
journey, and were received at London with great pomp
and solemnity<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 732. Heylin, p. 71.</NOTE>. This seems to have been the first inter∣course,
which that empire had with any of the western
potentates of Europe.</P>
<P>A LAW was passed in this reign<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 2.</NOTE>, by which the
number of horses, arms, and furniture, was fixed, which
each person; according to the extent of his property,
should be provided of for the defence of the kingdom.
A man of a thousand pounds a year, for instance, was
obliged to maintain at his own charge six horses fit for
demi-lances, of which three at least to be furnished with
sufficient harnesses, steel saddles, and weapons proper
for the demi-lances; and ten light horses fit for light
<PB N="480" REF="512"/>
horsemen, with furniture and weapons requisite for them,
He was also obliged to have forty corslets furnished; fifty
almain revets, or instead of them, forty coats of plate,
corslets or brigandines furnished; forty pikes, thirty long
bows, thirty sheafs of arrows, thirty steel caps or skulls,
twenty black bills or halberts, twenty haquebuts, and
twenty morions or sallets. We may remark, that a man
of a thousand marks of stock was rated equal to one of
two hundred pounds a year: A proof that few or none
at that time lived on their stock in money, and that great
profits were made by the merchants in the course of
their trade. There is no class above a thousand pounds
a year.</P>
