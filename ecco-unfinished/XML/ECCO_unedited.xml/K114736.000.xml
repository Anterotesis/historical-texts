<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ITH all duty and submission comes into the world the last part of this History under Your Majesty's pro∣tection; a just Tribute to Your Ma∣jesty, as well on the account of the Memory of the Author, so long en∣gaged, and so usefully, in the Ser∣vice
<PB REF="60"/>
of the Crown, as of the work it self, so worthily memorable for the great Subject He treats of; and so instructive, by his noble way of treating it.</P>
<P>This work, now it is compleately published, relates the Trans∣actions of near twenty years; hardly to be parallel'd in any other time, or place, for the wonderful turns, and passages in it. In this space of time, Your Majesty sees Your own Country at the highest pitch of happiness and prosperity, and the lowest degree of adversity and misery. So that, when a man carries his Thoughts and his Me∣mory over all the Occurrences of those Times, he seems to be under the power of some Enchantment, and to dream, rather than read, the Relations of so many surprising Revolutions. The peace and the plenty of this Kingdom, and, in so short a space of time, the bloody desolation of it by a most wicked Rebellion, the ruin of so many noble and great Families, and the devastation of their Estates; and, af∣ter this, the Restitution of all things <HI>as at the beginning,</HI> is hardly credible at this time, even so soon after all these things came to pass.</P>
<P>When Your Majesty sees one of Your Royal Ancestors, the first who liv'd to reign as Heir to the two Crowns of Great <HI>Britain</HI> united, and, on that account, higher in reputation, honour, and power, than any of his Predecessors, brought, by unaccountable Administrations on the one hand, and by vile Contrivances on the other, into the greatest difficulties and distresses throughout all his Kingdoms; then left and abandon'd by most of his Servants, whom he had himself raised to the greatest honours, and preferments; thus reduced to have scarce one faithful able Counsellor about him, to whom he could <HI>breath his Conscience and Complaints,</HI> and from whom he might expect one honest, sound, disinteressed Advice: after this, how he was obliged to take up Armes, and to contend with his own Subjects in the Field for his Crown, the Laws, his Liberty, and Life; there meeting with unequal for∣tune,
<PB REF="70"/>
how he was driven from one part of the Kingdom, and from one Body of an Army to another, till at last he was brought under the power of cruel and merciless Men, imprison'd, arraign'd, con∣demn'd, and executed like a common Malefactor: And after this still, when Your Majesty sees his Enemies triumphing for a time in their own guilt, and ruling over their fellows, and first compa∣nions in wickedness, with successful Insolence, till these very Men by force, and fraud, and sundry artifices, still getting the better of one another, brought all Government into such Confusion and Anarchy, that no one of them could subsist; and how then, by God's Providence, the Heir of the Royal Martyr was invited and brought home by the Generality of the People, and their Represen∣tatives, to return, and take on him the Government, in as full an Exercise of it as any of his Predecessors had ever enjoyed; not subject to any of those Treaties, or Conditions, which had been so often offer'd by his Father to the Men then in credit, and power, and, in their pride and fury, had been as often rejected by them: When Your Majesty sees before You all this begun, and carried on in Violence and War, and concluded in a peaceful Restoration, within the space of twenty years, by <HI>English-</HI>men alone amongst themselves, without the Intervention of any foreign power; many of the same hands joyning in the recovery and settlement, as they had done before in the Destruction of their Country; Your Majesty will certainly say,</P>
<P>This was the Lord's doing, and it must ever be mar∣vellous in our eyes.</P>
<P>An Account of this great work of God coming to be publish'd in Your Majesty's time, it is humbly conceiv'd not improper to con∣gratulate Your good fortune, that, in the beginning of Your Reign, such a History of the greatest Matters, pass'd within Your own Dominions, comes to light; as well for the necessity there may be,
<PB REF="80"/>
after above forty years run out in a very unsettled and various management of the publick Affairs, to put men in mind again of those mischiefs under which so many great Men fell on both sides, as in hopes, that on Your Majesty's account, and for the Glory of Your Name, whom Your People have universally receiv'd with joy, this Generation may be inclined to let these fresh examples of Good and Evil sink into their minds, and make the deeper impres∣sion in them to follow the one, and avoid the other.</P>
<P>From the year <HI>1660</HI> to very near <HI>1685,</HI> which was the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Reign here in <HI>England,</HI> it must needs be own'd, that, with all the very good Understanding, and excellent good Nature of that King, there was a great mixture of Counsels, and great vicissitudes of good and bad Events, all∣most throughout that space of time attending his Government. They seem indeed to be somewhat like the four Seasons of the year; of which three Quarters are generally fair, hopeful, flourishing, and gay; but there come as constantly severe Winters, that freez, wither, destroy, and cut off many hopeful plants, and expectations of things to come.</P>
<P>It must be own'd too, since it can never be concealed, that, from the beginning of the Restoration, there was, certainly, not such a Return to God Allmighty for the wonderful Blessings he had pour'd out with so liberal a hand, as, no doubt was due to the great Au∣thor and Giver of all that Happiness: neither was there such a prudence in the Administration, or such a steadiness in the conduct of Affairs, as the fresh Experience of the foregone misfortunes might well have forewarn'd those that were entrusted in it, to have pursued with Courage and Constancy. It is but too notorious there was great forgetfulness of God, as well as manifest Mistakes to∣wards the World; which quickly brought forth fruits meet for such undutifulness, and ill conduct.</P>
<P><PB REF="90"/>
The next four years after that Reign, were attended with more fatal Miscarriages; over which it may be more decent to draw a Veil, than to enter into a particular enumeration of them. Many great Princes have been led unawares into irrecoverable Errors; and the greater they are, so many more particular Persons are usually involv'd in the Calamity.</P>
<P>What follow'd after this time, till Your Majesty's most happy coming to the Throne, is so fresh in the memory of all Men yet living, that every one will be best able to make his own observations upon it. Such Deliverances have their pangs in the Birth, that much weaken the Constitution, in endeavouring to preserve, and amend it.</P>
<P>And now Your Majesty, who succeeds to a Revolution, as well as a Restoration, has the advantage of a retrospect on all these Ac∣cidents, and the benefit of reviewing all the failings in those times: and whatsoever was wanting, at those opportunities of amending past Errors, in the management of Affairs, for the better establish∣ment of the Crown, and the security of the true old <HI>English</HI> Go∣vernment, it will be Your Majesty's happiness to supply in Your time: a time in some sort resembling the auspicious beginning of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Restoration; for in that time, as now in Your Majesty's, the People of this Kingdom ran chearfully into obedience; the chiefest Offenders lay quiet under a sense of their own Crimes, and an apprehension of the reward justly due to them; and all Your Subjects went out to meet Your Majesty with Duty, and most with Love.</P>
<P>Comparisons of Times may be as odious as that of Persons; and therefore no more shall be said here on that Subject, than that since the Restoration, and some few years after it, given up to joy, and the forgetfulness of past Miseries, there hath been no time that brought so much hope of quiet, and so general a satisfaction to these Kingdoms, as that on which we saw Your Majesty so happily
<PB REF="100"/>
seated upon the Throne of Your Ancestors. Among all the signs of greatness and glory in a Prince's Reign, there is none more really advantageous, none more comfortable, than that which <HI>Virgil</HI> re∣marks as a felicity in the time of <HI>Augustus,</HI></P>
<P>When abroad the Soveraign is prosperous, and at home does govern Subjects willing to obey:</P>
<P>When it is not fear that drives and compels them, but affection and loving-kindness that draws them, to their duty; and makes them rejoyce under the Laws by which they are govern'd. Such was certainly the time of Your Majesty's first Entrance; and such God grant it may be ever.</P>
<P>The two first Volumes of this History have laid before Your Majesty the original causes, and the foundations of the Rebellion, and Civil War; the contrivances, designs, and consultations in it; and the miserable events of it; and seem'd to have finish'd the whole War, when the Author, at the very end of the ninth Book, says, that <HI>from that time there remain'd no possibility for the King to draw any more Troops together in the Field.</HI> And when there's an end of Action in the Field, the inquiries into the consequences afterwards are usually less warm.</P>
<P>But it happens in the Course of this History, that several new Scenes of new Wars, and the Events of them, are open'd in this Vo∣lume; which, it is hoped, will prove exceeding useful, even in those parts, where, by reason of the sadness of the Subject, it cannot be de∣lightful, and, in all other parts of it, both useful and delightful.</P>
<P>Your Majesty especially, who must have Your heart perpetually intent to see what follow'd in the close of all those Wars, and by what means and methods the loss of all that noble and innocent Blood, and particularly that portion of the Royal Stream then spilt, was recompensed upon Their heads who were the wicked Contrivers of the Parricide, and how at last the miseries of these Nations, and
<PB REF="110"/>
the sufferings of Your Royal Family were all recover'd by God All∣mighty's own unerring hand, will, no doubt, be more agreeably en∣tertain'd in this Volume with the Relation of the secret steps of the return of God's Mercy, than when he still seem'd openly to have for∣saken his own oppressed Cause; wherein so much of what was dearest to Your self was so highly concern'd.</P>
<P>Of the Transactions within these Kingdoms, soon after the War was ended, especially just before, and after the barbarous Murther of the Blessed King, this Author could have but short and imperfect informations abroad. It cannot therefore justly be expected, that he should be so full, or minute in many circumstances relating to the actions and consultations of that Party here at home, as are to be found in some other Writers, whose business it was to intend only such matters.</P>
<P>One thing indeed were very much to be wish'd, that he had given the world a more distinct, and particular Narrative of that pious King's last most magnanimous sufferings in his Imprisonments, Tryal, and Death. But it seems the remembrance of all those deplorable passages was so grievous, and insupportable to the Writer's mind, that he abhorr'd the dwelling long upon them, and chose rather to contract the whole black Tragedy within too narrow a compass. But this is a loss that can only now be lamented, not repaired.</P>
<P>But when the History brings Your Majesty to what the noble Writer esteem'd one of his principal businesses in this Volume, to at∣tend King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and his two Royal Brothers, through∣out all their wandrings, which take up a considerable share of it, and are most accurately and knowingly described by him, as having been a constant Witness of most of them, it is presumed, This part may give Your Majesty equal satisfaction to any that is gone before it. It will not be unpleasant to Your Majesty, since You have known so well the happy conclusion of it, to see the banish'd King under his
<PB REF="120"/>
long adverse Fortune, and how many years of trouble and distress he patiently waited God Allmighty's appointed time, for his Re∣demption from that Captivity.</P>
<P>In that disconsolate time of distress and lowness of his Fortune, Your Majesty will find cause to observe, that there were Factions even Then in his little Court beyond Sea; so inseparable are such undecent and unchristian contentions from all Communities of men: They are like <HI>Tares sown by an Enemy amongst the Wheat, whilst good men sleep.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Subject of the Factions in those days, there is a parti∣cular passage in this History, of two Parties in that Court abroad, who thought it worth their while, even Then to be very industrious in prosecuting this Author with unjust and false accusations. And the Author himself observes, that, howsoever those Parties seem'd, on most other accounts, incompatible the one with the other, they were very heartily united in endeavouring to compass His destru∣ction; and for no other reason, that ever appear'd, but his being an unwearied Assertor of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Cause, and a con∣stant Friend and Servant to the true Interest of it; to which either of Them was really more irreconcileable, than they were to each other, whatsoever they pretended.</P>
<P>This passage seems to deserve a particular reflection, because, within few years after that King's Restoration, some of both those Parties joyn'd again in attacking this noble Author, and accusing him anew of the very same pretended crimes they had objected to him abroad; where there had been so much malice shew'd on one side, and so much natural and irresistible innocency appear'd on the other, that one would have thought, no Arrow out of the same Quiver, could have been enough envenom'd to have hurt so faithful, so con∣stant, and so tried a Servant to the Church and Crown.</P>
<P>This particular, and another, wherein Your Majesty will find
<PB REF="130"/>
what advice this Author gave his Royal Master, upon the occasion of his being much press'd to go to Church to <HI>Charenton,</HI> and how some Intrigues, and Snares, cunningly laid on one side, were very plainly and boldly withstood on the other by this Author, will let the world see, why this man was by any means to be removed, if his Adversaries could effect it, as one that was perpetually crossing their mischievous designs, by an habitual course of adhering unmoveably to the Interest of this Church and Nation.</P>
<P>In the progress of this Book, Your Majesty will also find some very near that King whilst he was abroad, endeavouring to take ad∣vantage of the forlorne and desperate circumstances of his fortune, to perswade him, that the Party who had fought for his Father, was an insignificant, a despicable, and undone Number of Men; and, on this account, putting him on the thoughts of marrying some Ro∣man Catholick Lady, who might engage those of that Religion, both at home and abroad, in his Majesty's Interest; Others at the same time, with equal importunity, recommending the power of the Pres∣byterians, as most able to do him service, and bring him home.</P>
<P>This noble Author all this while persisted, in the integrity of his Soul, to use that credit his faithfulness and truth had gain'd him, to convince the King, that foreign force was a strength not desirable for him to depend on, and, if it were suspected to be on the Interest of Popery, of all things most likely to prevent, and disappoint his Re∣storation; that for his own Subjects, none of them were to be ne∣glected; his Armes ought to be stretch'd out to receive them all; but the old Royal Party was that his Majesty should chiefly rely on, both to assist him in his Return, and afterwards to establish his Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>This noble Author had been a watchful observer of all that had passed in the time of the Troubles; and had the opportunity to have seen the actions, and penetrated, in a good measure, into the
<PB REF="140"/>
consultations of those days, and was no ill judge of the temper and nature of mankind; and He, it seems, could not be of opinion, but that They who had ventur'd all for the Father, would be the truest and firmest Friends to the Son.</P>
<P>Whether this grew up in him to be his judgement, from his ob∣servation of the Rules of Nature, and a general practice in all wise Men to depend most on the Service, and Affection of those who had been steady to them in their distresses; or whether a luke-warm Trimming indifferency, though sometimes dignified with the Cha∣racter of Politicks, did not suit with His plain dealing, it is cer∣tain, he never could advise a Prince to hold a Conduct that should grieve, and disoblige his old Friends, in hope of getting new ones, and make all his old Enemies rejoyce. But, however his malicious Prosecutors afterwards scandalized him, as being the Author of such Counsels, and objected to him what was their own advice and practice, He really thought this kind of Conduct weaken'd the hands, and tended to the subversion of any Government. And the success has approved this judgement; for in the very inconstant, and va∣riable Administration under that King, it was found by Experience, and to this day the Memorials of it are extant, that he had quiet and calm days, or more rough and boisterous weather, as he favour'd, or discountenanced his own <HI>Party;</HI> called indeed a <HI>Party</HI> by the Enemies of it, upon a levelling principle of allowing no distinctions; though all who have contended against it, were properly <HI>but Par∣ties;</HI> whilst that was then, and is still, on the advantage-ground of being established by the Laws, and incorporated into the Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>By degrees Your Majesty is brought, in the course of this Hi∣story, as it were to the top of some exalted height, from whence You may behold all the errors and misfortunes of the time past with ad∣vantage to Your self; may view Armies drawn up, and Battles
<PB REF="150"/>
fought, without Your part of the danger; and, by the experience of former Misfortunes, establish Your own Security.</P>
<P>It seems to be a Situation not unlike that of the Temple of Wis∣dom in <HI>Lucretius;</HI> from whence he advises his readers to look down on all the Vanity and Hurry of the World. And as that Phi∣losophical Poet does very movingly describe the pursuits of those whom he justly styles Miserable Men, distracting themselves in wearisom contentions about the Business and Greatness of an empty world; so does this noble Historian, with true and evident de∣ductions from one cause and event to another, and such an agree∣able thread of entertainment, that one is never content to give over reading, bring Your Majesty to an easy ascent over all the know∣ledge of those miserable times; from whence not in speculation onely, but really and experimentally, You may look down on all the folly, and madness, and wickedness of those secret Contrivances, and open Violences, whereby the Nation, as well as the Crown, was brought to desolation; and see how falsly and weakly those great and busy disturbers of peace pretended Reformation, and Religion, and to be seeking God in every one of their rebellious and sinful Actions; whereas God was not to be found in their Thunder, nor their Earth∣quakes, that seem'd to shake the foundations of the World; but in the still voice of peace he came at last, to defeat and disappoint all their Inventions: That God, to whom vengeance belongs, arose, and shew'd himself in defence of that righteous Cause of the Crown and Church; which Your Majesty will observe to have been com∣bined against, fought with, overthrown, and in the end raised, and reestablished together. <HI>Now these things happen'd for en∣samples, and they are written for our admonition.</HI></P>
<P>It is now most humbly submitted to Your Majesty's judgement, whether the consideration of these matters, set forth in this Hi∣story, be not the most useful prospect not for Your self onely, but
<PB REF="160"/>
Your noblest Train, Your great Council, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in Parliament assembled.</P>
<P>When Your Majesty is so attended, by God's blessing, no power on Earth will be able to disappoint Your Wisdom, or resist Your Will. And there may be need of all this power and authority, to preserve, and defend Your Subjects, as well as Your Crown, from the like distractions and invasions. There may want the con∣currence of a Parliament, to prevent the return of the same mis∣chievous practices, and to restrain the madness of Men of the same Principles in this Age, as destroyed the last: such as think them∣selves even more capable than those in the last, to carry on the like wicked designs; such as take themselves to be inform'd, even from this History, how to mend the mistakes then committed by the prin∣cipal Directors on that side, and by a more refin'd skill in wicked∣ness, to be able once again to overthrow the Monarchy, and then to perpetuate the destruction of it.</P>
<P>There is no doubt, Madam, but every thing that is represented to Your Majesty of this Nature, will find a Party ready to deny it; that will joyn hand in hand to assure the world there is no such thing. It is a common Cause, and it is their Interest, if they can, to perswade Men, that it is onely the heat and warmth of <HI>High-Church Inventions, that suggests such fears, and jea∣lousies.</HI></P>
<P>But let any impartial Person judge, to whom all the Liber∣tines of the Republican Party are like to unite themselves; and whether it is imaginable, that the establish'd Government, ei∣ther in Church or State, can be strengthen'd, or serv'd by them. They must go to the Enemies of both, and pretend there is no such thing as a Republican Party in <HI>England,</HI> that they may be the less observ'd, and go on the more secure in their destructive projects.</P>
<P><PB REF="170"/>
They can have no better game to play, than to declare, that none but <HI>Jacobites</HI> alarm the Nation with these Apprehensions; and that <HI>Jacobites</HI> are much greater Enemies than Themselves to Your Majesty. Let that be so: no Man, in his Wits, can say any thing to Your Majesty in behalf of any, let them be who they will, that will not own Your Government, and wish the pro∣sperity and the happiness of it, and contribute all they can to main∣tain it.</P>
<P>But whilst these Men most falsely asperse the Sons of the Church of <HI>England</HI> for being <HI>Jacobites,</HI> let them rather clear them∣selves of what they were lately charg'd before Your Majesty, that there are Societies of them which celebrate the horrid thir∣tieth of <HI>January,</HI> with an execrable Solemnity of scandalous mirth; and that they have Seminaries, and a sort of Universities, in <HI>England,</HI> maintain'd by great contributions, where the fiercest Doctrines against Monarchical, and Episcopal Government, are taught and propagated, and where they bear an implacable hatred to Your Majesty's Title, Name, and Family.</P>
<P>This seems to be a Torrent that cannot be resisted but by the whole Legislative Authority; neither can Your Throne, which they are thus perpetually assaulting, or undermining, be supported by a less power.</P>
<P>In these difficulties Your great Council will, over and above their Personal duty to Your Majesty, take themselves to be more concern'd to be zealous in the defence of Your Royal Prerogative, as well as of their own just Rights and Privileges, in that it was under the Name and Style of a Parliament, though very unjustly socall'd, that all the mischiefs mention'd in this History were brought upon the Kingdom.</P>
<P>They best can discover the Craft and Subtilty formerly used in those Consultations; which first inveigled, and drew men in from
<PB REF="180"/>
one wickedness to another, before they were aware of what they were doing; and engaged them to think themselves not safe, but by doing greater Evils than they began with.</P>
<P>They will, no doubt, be filled with a just indignation against all that Hypocrisy and Villany, by which the <HI>English</HI> Name, and Nation, were exposed to the censure of the rest of the world: They onely can be able to present Your Majesty with remedies pro∣per, and adequate to all these evils, by which God may be glori∣fied, and the ancient Constitution of this Government retriev'd, and supported.</P>
<P>There is one calamity more, that stands in need of a cure from Your own Soveraign hand. It is in truth a peculiar Calamity fallen most heavily on this Age, which though it took its chief rise from the disorderly, dissolute times of those Wars, and has monstrously increased ever since, yet was never own'd so much as Now, and that is a barefaced contempt, and disuse of all Religion what so∣ever. And indeed what could so much feign'd Sanctity, and so much real Wickedness, during that Rebellion begun in <HI>1641,</HI> produce else in foolish Mens hearts, than to say, <HI>There is no God?</HI></P>
<P>This Irreligion was then pretended to be cover'd with a more signal Morality and precise strictness in life and conversation, which was to be a recompence for the loss of Christianity. But now, even that Shadow of godliness and virtue is fled too. A∣theism, and Profaneness, diligently cultivated, have not failed to produce a prostitution of all Manners in contempt of all Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>This profaneness and impiety seems, next to the horrible confu∣sions of the late Rebellion, to have gain'd ground chiefly by this method, that, when many who have been in Authority have not, on several Accounts, been heartily affected to the support of the
<PB REF="190"/>
Church established by Law, there has crept in, by little and little, a liberty against all Religion. For where the chief Advisers or Managers of publick Affairs, have inclined to alterations, which the established rules have not countenanced, they durst not cause the Laws to be put in Execution, for fear of turning the force of them on Themselves; so their next refuge has been to suffer men to observe no discipline, or government at all.</P>
<P>Thus the Church of <HI>England,</HI> put to Nurse, as it were, some∣times to such as have been inclined to Popery, and sometimes to other Sects, and sometimes to men indifferent to all Religion, hath been in danger of being starv'd, or overlaid, by all of them; and the ill consequence has redounded not onely to the Members of that Communion, but to all the Professors of Christianity it self.</P>
<P>Whoever have ventur'd to give warning of these wicked de∣signs and practices, have been render'd as Persons of ill temper and very bad affections. They that have been in Credit and Au∣thority, have been frequently inclined to be favourable to the men complain'd of; it has been offer'd on their behalf, that their inten∣tions were good; and that it was even the Interest of the Govern∣ment to cover their Principles, whatever might be the consequences of them.</P>
<P>Thus these Mischiefs have been still growing, and no Laws have hitherto reached them; and, possibly, they are become inca∣pable of a remedy; unless Your Majesty's great example of Piety and Virtue shall have sufficient influence to amend them: No ho∣nest man can say it is not reasonable, and even necessary, to watch them; and that, in compassion to Your Subjects, as well as justice to Your self. This History hath shewn Your Majesty their fruits in the late times, by which You shall know them still; for Your Majesty well remembers Who has said, that</P>
<P>Men do not gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles.</P>
<P><PB REF="200"/>
That God may give Your Majesty a discerning Spirit, a wise, and understanding Heart, to judge aright of all things that belong to Your peace; that He may enable You to subdue Your Ene∣mies abroad by successful Counsels, and Armes, and to reduce Your Ill-willers at home by prudent Laws, administer'd with the meekness of Wisdom; that He would give You length of days in one hand, and Riches and Honour in the other; that You, in Your days, may have the glory to restore good Nature (for which the <HI>English</HI> Nation was formerly so celebrated) and good manners, as well as the sincere profession, and universal practice of the true Religion, in Your Kingdoms; and that His Allmighty power may defend You with his favourable Kindness as with a Shield, against all Your Adversaries of every kind, are the zealous, constant, and devout prayers of so many Millions, that it were the highest pre∣sumption in any One Person, to subscribe a particular Name to so Universal a Concern.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Actions of the last year were attended with so many dismal Accidents and Events, that there were no seeds of hope left to spring up in this ensuing ill year; for it was enough discern'd how little success the Treaty with the <HI>Scots</HI> would produce; <Q>which yet the King did not desire to put a period to, otherwise than by positively declaring, “that he would never consent to the alteration of the Church” Government, but was willing enough that <MILESTONE N="10"/> they should entertain any other hopes, and was not himself without hope, that by satisfying the Ambition, and Interest of particular Men, he might mitigate the rigour of the Presbyterian Faction;</Q> and to that purpose Monsieur <HI>Montrevil</HI> was gone from <HI>London</HI> to the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, then before <HI>Newark,</HI> having taken <HI>Oxford</HI> in his way, and so given an Account to the King of his observations, and receiv'd from him such Information and Instruction as was necessary for the work in hand.</P>
<P>IN the mean time no ways were left untryed to draw such a Body of an Army together, as might enable his Majesty to make some attempt upon the Enemy; and if he could, by all possible endeavours, have <MILESTONE N="20"/>
<PB N="2" REF="240"/>
drawn out of all his Garrisons left, a force of five thousand Horse and Foot (which at that time seem'd a thing not to be despaired of) he did more desire to have lost his life, in some signal attempt upon any part of the Enemies Army, than to have enjoyed any conditions which he foresaw he was ever like to obtain by Treaty; and he was not out of hope of a Body of five thousand Foot to be landed in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> which his Letters from <HI>France</HI> confidently promised, and which had been so much expected, and depended upon by the Prince, that it kept him from transporting himself into <HI>Silly,</HI> till <HI>Fairfax</HI> was march'd (as hath been said before) within little more than twenty Miles of <HI>Pendennis.</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> For S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Dudly Wyat</HI> had been sent expressly from the Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> to assure the Prince, that such a Body of five thousand Foot were actually raised under the Command of <HI>Ruvignie,</HI> and should be embarked for <HI>Pendennis</HI> within less than a month; and the Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> in a Post∣script to that Letter which he writ to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Dudly Wyat,</HI> wished him not to be too strict in the computation of the Month from the date of the Letter, because there might be ac∣cidents of Winds at that Season; but he desired him to be confident, that they should be all landed within the expiration of six Weeks, and by that Measure to conduct the resolutions, and to decline fighting <MILESTONE N="20"/> upon that Account: After all this, it is as true, that there was never a Man at this time levied, or design'd for that expedition, only the Name of <HI>Ruvignie</HI> (because he was of the Religion, and known to be a good Officer) had been mention'd, in some loose discourse by the Car∣dinal, as one who would be very fit to Command any Troops which might be sent into <HI>England</HI> for the relief of the King; which the other, according to his natural credulity, thought to be Warrant enough to give both the King and the Prince that unreasonable Expectation; the which and many other of that great Lord's Negotiations and Trans∣actions, the succeeding, and long continuing Misfortunes, kept from <MILESTONE N="30"/> being ever after examin'd, or consider'd and reflected upon.</P>
<P>THE Prince stayed in the Isle of <HI>Silly</HI> from <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 4<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI> till <HI>Thursday</HI> the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI> the Wind having continued so contrary, that the Lords <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Hopton</HI> came not to him from <HI>Corn∣wal</HI> till the <HI>Saturday</HI> before; at which time likewise arriv'd a Trum∣peter from S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> with such a Message from the Parliament to the Prince as might well be called a Summons, rather than an Invita∣tion; yet it was well it came not to <HI>Pendennis,</HI> where it would have found a Party among the Prince's Servants. The next Morning, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> a Fleet of about twenty seven, or twenty eight Sail of Ships, <MILESTONE N="40"/> incompassed the Island; but within three or four hours, by a very notable tempest, which continued two days, they were dispersed. Upon this, and a clear determination of the weakness of the Place, if it should be attacked by any considerable strength (which both by the Message and the Attendants of it they had reason to apprehend) together with the extreme scarcity of Provisions in that Island, which had not been, in the six weeks the Prince staid there, supplied with Victual for two days out of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> neither had there been any returns from <HI>France</HI> upon the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI>'s application to the Queen, which returns would every day grow more difficult by the Season of the year, his <MILESTONE N="50"/> Highness inclined to remove to <HI>Jersy;</HI> against which nothing could be objected of Weight, but the consideration of the King's being at <HI>Lon∣don</HI> (which was strongly reported still) in a Treaty; and then, that his
<PB N="3" REF="250"/>
Highness's remove, especially if by distress of Weather he should be forced into <HI>France,</HI> might be prejudicial to the King; and therefore it would be reasonable, first to expect some advertisement from his Ma∣jesty in what condition he was. Hereupon his Highness produced in Council this ensuing Letter from the King, which was writ shortly af∣ter the Battle of <HI>Naseby,</HI> and which he had conceal'd till that Morning from all the Lords, and which truly, I think, was the only secret he had ever kept from the four he had trusted.</P>

But let <MILESTONE N="20"/> their resolutions be never so barbarous, the saving of my Life by com∣plying with them would make me end my days with torture, and dis∣quiet of mind, not giving you my Blessing, and Cursing all the rest who are consenting to it.

I charge you to keep this Letter still safe by you, until you shall have cause to use it; and then, and not till then, and not till then, to shew it to all your Council; it being my command to them, as well as you; whom I pray God to make as prosperously glorious as any of the Pre∣decessors” <MILESTONE N="30"/> ever were of</Q></P>

<P>AFTER the reading this Letter, and a consideration of the proba∣bility that the Rebels would make some attempt upon his Highness there, and the impossibility of resisting such an attempt in the condi∣tion the Island then stood, it was by his Highness with great earnestness proposed, and by the whole Council (except the Earl of <HI>Berkshire)</HI> unanimously advised, that the opportunity should be then laid hold on, whilst the Rebels Ships were scatter'd; and that his Highness should <MILESTONE N="40"/> embark for <HI>Jersy;</HI> which he did accordingly on <HI>Thursday;</HI> and on the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>em∣barks from</HI> Silly, <HI>lands at</HI> Jersy, Apr 17.</NOTE> next day, being the 17<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI> with a prosperous wind landed at <HI>Jersy;</HI> from whence, the same Night, they sent an express to the Queen, of the Prince's safe arrival in that Island; and likewise Letters to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Maloes,</HI> and <HI>Havre de Grace,</HI> to advertise the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> of the same; who receiv'd the Information very seasonably, lying then at <HI>Havre</HI> with two Frigats in expectation of a wind for <HI>Silly,</HI> and with command to the Prince from the Queen, immediately to remove from thence. After the Prince had taken an Account of this Island, both himself, and all their Lordships were of opinion, that it was a place of <MILESTONE N="50"/> the greatest security, benefit, and conveniency to repose in, that could have been desired, and wished for; till upon a clear information, and observation of the King's condition, and the state of <HI>England,</HI> he should
<PB N="4" REF="260"/>
find a fit opportunity to act; and the Prince himself seem'd to have the greatest aversion, and resolution against going into <HI>France,</HI> except in case of danger of surprisal by the Rebels, that could be imagined. In few days M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Progers,</HI> who had been dispatched before (presently upon the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI>'s coming) from <HI>Paris</HI> for <HI>Silly,</HI> being hinder'd by contrary winds till he receiv'd the News of the Prince's being at <HI>Jersy,</HI> came thither, and brought this following Letter from her Majesty to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Cipher.</P>
<LETTER>

<P><Q>“MY Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> must witness for me that I have patiently and <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Letter from the Queen to the Chancellor of the Exchequer concerning the Prince's re∣moval into</HI> France.</NOTE> at large, heard all that he could say concerning the condition of <HI>Silly,</HI> and all that has been proposed for rendering of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> his abode there safe; yet I must confess to you, that I am so far from being satisfied in that point, that I shall not sleep in quiet until I shall hear that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> shall be removed from thence. It is confessed, it is not sufficiently Fortified, and is accessible in divers places; and the Manning the Works will require a thousand Men more than you have, or, for ought I see, can procure; neither can you be confident, that the loss of <HI>Cornwal</HI> may not suddainly have a dan∣gerous <MILESTONE N="20"/> influence upon that Garrison; most of your Soldiers being of that Country. The power of the Parliament at Sea is so great, that you cannot rely upon the seasonable and safe conveyance of such pro∣portions of Provisions, as so great a Garrison will require: I need not remember you of what importance to the King, and all his Party, the safety of the Prince's person is; If he should fall into the Rebels hands, the whole would thereby become desperate; therefore I must impor∣tunately conjure you to intend this work, as the principal service you can do to the King, Me, or the Prince. <HI>Colepepper</HI> will tell you how I have strain'd to assist you with present Provisions, Shipping, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> Money, necessary for the Prince's Remove to <HI>Jersy;</HI> where, be con∣fident of it, he shall want nothing. Besides, for satisfaction of others, I have moved the Queen Regent to give assurance, that if the Prince, in his way to <HI>Jersy,</HI> should be necessitated, by contrary winds, or the danger of the Parliament Shipping, to touch in <HI>France,</HI> he should have all freedom, and assistance from hence, in his immediate passage thither; which is granted with great chearfulness, and civility, and will be subscribed under the hands of the <HI>French</HI> King and Queen, my Brother, and Cardinal <HI>Mazarin:</HI> therefore I hope all scruples are now satisfied. <HI>Colepepper</HI> is hastening to you with good Frigats; but if you <MILESTONE N="40"/> shall find any danger before their arrival, I shall rely upon your care not to omit any opportunity to prevent that danger, according to the resolution in Council, which <HI>Colepepper</HI> hath acquainted me with; for which I thank you. I need not tell you how acceptable this ser∣vice will be to the King, who in every Letter presses me to write to you concerning my Son's safety; nor that I am, and allways will be,” most constantly,</Q></P>

<P>THE Prince and Council were very glad at the receipt of this Letter <MILESTONE N="50"/> conceiving that they had now done all that could be required at their hands; though they were advertised at their first landing there, that there was still an expectation of the Prince in <HI>France;</HI> and that he would
<PB N="5" REF="270"/>
be speedily importun'd from thence; which they could not believe; but assoon as the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> came, they plainly discern'd that Let∣ter had been written upon advice to <HI>Silly,</HI> and upon foreseeing that an immediate Journey into <HI>France</HI> would not have been submitted to; and that the Instrument mention'd for his Highness's quiet and uninterrupted Passage through <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Jersy,</HI> was only a colour, the sooner to have invited the Prince to have landed there, if there had been any accidents in his passage; but that the resolution was, that he should not then have come to <HI>Jersy,</HI> as it was now, that he should quickly come from thence; to which purpose, shortly after, came most importunate Let∣ters <MILESTONE N="10"/> from the Queen; and it seems, howsoever all the late Letters from the King to the Prince before his coming out of <HI>England,</HI> were for his repair into <HI>Denmark,</HI> his Majesty, upon what reasons I know not, conceiv'd his Highness to be in <HI>France;</HI> for after his coming to <HI>Jersy,</HI> this following Letter was sent to him, by the Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> in whose Cipher it was writ, and decipher'd by his Lordship.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THIS Letter, and the very passionate Commands from the Queen, <MILESTONE N="40"/> together with what was privately said to his Highness by the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> who from his being at <HI>Paris</HI> had changed his former opi∣nions, and was (though he express'd it tenderly; finding a general aver∣sion) positive for his going, wrought so far on the Prince, that he dis∣cover'd an Inclination to the Journey; whereupon the Council pre∣sented at large to him, the Inconveniences and dangers that naturally might be supposed would attend such a resolution: They remember'd, the Carriage of the <HI>French</HI> since the beginning of this Rebellion; how it had been originally somented, and afterwards countenanced by them; and that they had never, in the least degree, assisted the King; that <MILESTONE N="50"/> there was no Evidence that, at that time, they were more inclined to him than to the Rebels; that it would be necessary they should make some publick Declaration on his Majesties behalf, before the Heir ap∣parent
<PB N="6" REF="280"/>
of the Crown should put himself into their hands. There was nothing omitted that could be thought of, to render that resolution at least to be of that importance that it ought to be throughly weigh'd, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lords</HI> Capel <HI>and</HI> Colepepper <HI>sent to</HI> Paris, <HI>to disswade the Queen from sending for the Prince into</HI> France.</NOTE> and consider'd, before executed; and so, in the end they prevailed with the Prince (since at that time it was not known where the King was) to send the Lords <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Colepepper</HI> again to the Queen, to present the weightiness of the matter to her Majesty. One of their Instructions was as follows.</P>
<P><Q>“YOU shall inform her Majesty, that We have, with all duty and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their Instru∣ctions and Ar∣rival at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> submission, consider'd her Letters to Us concerning our speedy re∣pair <MILESTONE N="10"/> into the Kingdom of <HI>France;</HI> the which direction, We conceive to be grounded upon her Majesties apprehension of danger to our Per∣son by any residence here; the contrary whereof, We believe, her Majesty will be no sooner advertised of, than she will hold Us excused for not giving that present obedience which We desire allways to yield to the least Intimation of her Majesty; and therefore, you shall hum∣bly acquaint her Majesty, that We have great reason to believe this Island, to be defensible against a greater Force, than We suppose pro∣bable to be brought against it. That the Inhabitants of the Island ex∣press as much chearfulness, unanimity, and resolution, for the defence <MILESTONE N="20"/> of our Person, by their whole carriage, and particularly by a Protesta∣tion voluntarily undertaken by them, as can be desired; and that, if, contrary to expectation, the Rebels should take the Island, We can from the Castle (a place in it self of very great strength) with the least hazard remove our self to <HI>France;</HI> which in case of imminent danger We resolve to do. That our security being thus stated, We beseech her Majesty to consider, whether it be not absolutely necessary, before any thought of our remove from hence be entertain'd, that We have as clear an information as may be got, of the condition of our Royal Father, and the Affections of <HI>England;</HI> of the resolutions of the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and the strength of the Lord <HI>Montrose</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> of <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Affairs in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the conclusion of the Treaty there; that so, upon a full and mature prospect upon the whole, We may so dispose of our Person as may be most for the benefit and advantage of our Royal Father; or patiently attend such an alteration and conjuncture, as may administer a greater advantage than is yet offer'd; and whether our remove out of the Dominions of our Royal Father (except upon such a necessity, or apparent visible conveniency) may not have an Influence upon the Affections of the three Kingdoms to the disad∣vantage” of his Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>WITHIN two days after the two Lords were gone for <HI>Paris,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Dud∣ley</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Wyat</HI> arriv'd with the News of the King's being gone out of <HI>Oxford,</HI> before the break of day, only with two Servants, and to what place uncertain; it was believ'd by the Queen, as she said in her Letter to the Prince, that he was gone for <HI>Ireland,</HI> or to the <HI>Scots;</HI> and therefore her Majesty renewed her Command for the Prince's immediate repair into <HI>France;</HI> whereas the chief reason before was, that he would put himself into the <HI>Scots</HI> hands; and therefore it was necessary that his Highness should be in <HI>France,</HI> to go in the head of those Forces which should be immediately sent out of that Kingdom to assist his Majesty. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE two Lords found the Queen much troubled, that the Prince him∣self came not; <Q>she declared her self “not to be moved with any reasons that were, or could be, given for his stay; and that her resolution was”
<PB N="7" REF="290"/>
positive and unalterable:</Q> yet they prevailed with her, to respite any po∣sitive Declaration till she might receive full advertisement of the King's condition; who was by this time known to be in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army.</P>
<P>IT is remember'd before, that the Prince, upon his arrival at <HI>Silly,</HI> sent a Gentleman to <HI>Ireland</HI> to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> as well that he might be punctually inform'd of the State of that Kingdom (of which there were several reports) as that he might receive from thence a Com∣pany or two of Foot, for the better Guard of that Island; which he fore∣saw would be necessary, whether he should remain there or not. The Gentleman had a very quick passage to <HI>Dublin,</HI> and came thither very <MILESTONE N="10"/> quickly after the Peace was agreed upon with the <HI>Irish</HI> Roman Catho∣licks, and found the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> there; who, after his Enterprise, and disbanding in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had first transported himself into the Isle of <HI>Man,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Ireland;</HI> where he had been receiv'd, with great kindness and generosity, by the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> as a Man who had been in so eminent a Post in the King's Council and Affairs. He was a Person of so rare a composition by Nature and by Art (for Na∣ture alone could never have reach'd to it) that he was so far from being ever dismaied upon any Misfortune (and greater variety of Misfortunes never befel any Man) that he quickly recollected himself so vigorously, <MILESTONE N="20"/> that he did really believe his condition to be improv'd by that ill acci∣dent; and that he had an opportunity thereby to gain a new stock of reputation, and honour; and so he no sooner heard of the Prince's be∣ing in the Isle of <HI>Silly,</HI> and of his condition, and the condition of that place, than he presently concluded, that the Prince's presence in <HI>Ireland</HI> would settle and compose all the factions there; reduce the Kingdom to his Majesties Service; and oblige the Pope's Nuntio, who was an Enemy to the Peace, to quit his ambitious designs. The Lord Lieu∣tenant had so good an opinion of the Expedient, that he could have been very well contented, that when his Highness had been forced to <MILESTONE N="30"/> leave <HI>England</HI> he had rather chosen to have made <HI>Ireland</HI> than <HI>Silly</HI> his retreat; but, being a Wise Man, and having many difficulties before him in view, and the apprehension of many contingencies which might encrease those difficulties, he would not take upon him to give advice in a point of so great importance; but, forthwith, having a Couple of Frigats ready, he caused an hundred Men with their Officers to be pre∣sently put on board, according to his Highness's desire; and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> (who allways concluded, that that was fit to be done which his first thoughts suggested to him, and never doubted the Execution of any thing which he once thought fit to be attempted) put himself on board <MILESTONE N="40"/> those Vessels; resolving, that upon the strength of his own reason, he should be able to perswade the Prince, and the Council which attended him, forthwith to quit <HI>Silly,</HI> and to repair to <HI>Dublin;</HI> which, he did not doubt, if brought to pass in that way, would have been grateful to the Lord Lieutenant. But, by the suddain remove of the Prince from <HI>Silly,</HI> the two Frigats from <HI>Dublin</HI> miss'd finding him there; and that Lord, whose order they were obliged to observe, made all the hast he could to <HI>Jersy;</HI> where he found the Prince, with many other of his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Digby <HI>arrives at</HI> Jersy <HI>from</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> Friends who attended his Highness, the two Lords being gone but the day before to attend the Queen; he lost no time in informing his High∣ness <MILESTONE N="50"/> of the happy state and condition of <HI>Ireland;</HI> that the Peace was concluded; and an Army of twelve thousand Men ready to be trans∣ported into <HI>England;</HI> of the great Zeal, and Affection the Lord Lieu∣tenant

<P><Q>THE Prince told him, “that it was a matter of greater importance, than was fit to be executed upon so short deliberation; that he was no sooner arriv'd at <HI>Jersy</HI> than he receiv'd Letters from the Queen his Mo∣ther, requiring him forthwith to come to <HI>Paris,</HI> where all things were provided for his reception; that he had sent two of the Lords of the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Council to the Queen, to excuse him for not giving ready obedience to her Commands; and to assure her that he was in a place of unquestion∣able Security; in which he might safely expect, to hear from the King his Father before he took any other resolution: That it would be very incongruous now to remove from thence, and to go into <HI>Ireland,</HI> be∣fore his Messengers return from <HI>Paris;</HI> in which time, he might rea∣sonably hope to hear from the King himself; and so wish'd him to have” patience till the matter was more ripe for a determination.</Q> This rea∣sonable Answer gave him no satisfaction; he commended the Prince's aversness from going into <HI>France;</HI> <Q>“which, he said, was the most perni∣cious Counsel that ever could be given; that it was a thing the King <MILESTONE N="20"/> his Father abhorr'd, and never would consent to; and that he would take upon himself to write to the Queen, and to give her such solid ad∣vice, and reasons, that should infallibly convert her from that desire, and that should abundantly satisfy her that his going into <HI>Ireland</HI> was absolutely necessary; but that a little delay in the execution of it, might deprive him of all the fruit which was to be expected from that Journey; and therefore, renew'd his advice, and importunity, for losing no more” time, but immediately to embark;</Q> which when he saw was not like to prevail with his Highness, he repaired to one of those of the Privy Coun∣cil, <MILESTONE N="30"/> who attended the Prince, with whom he had a particular friend∣ship, and lamented to him, the loss of such an occasion, which would inevitably restore the King; who would be equally ruin'd if the Prince went into <HI>France;</HI> of which he spoke with all the detestation imaginable; <Q>and said, “he was so far satisfied in his Conscience of the benefit that would redound from the one, and the ruin which would inevitably fall out by the other, that, he said, if the Person with whom he held this conference, would concur with him, he would carry the Prince into” <HI>Ireland,</HI> even without, and against his consent.</Q> <Q>The other Person an∣swer'd, “that it was not to be attempted without his consent; nor could he imagin it possible to bring it to pass, if they should both endeavour” <MILESTONE N="40"/> it.</Q> <Q>He replied, “that he would invite the Prince on board the Frigats to a Collation; and that he knew well he could so commend the Vessels to him, that his own curiosity would easily invite him to a view of them; and that assoon as he was on board, he would cause the Sails to” be hoisted up, and make no stay till he came into <HI>Ireland.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE other was very angry with him for entertaining such imagina∣tions; <Q>and told him, “”they neither agreed with his Wisdom nor his Duty;</Q> and left him in despair of his conjunction, and, at the same time, of be∣ing able to compass it. He had no sooner discharged himself of this imagination, but in the Instant (as he had a most pregnant fancy) he <MILESTONE N="50"/> entertain'd another with the same vigour; and resolv'd, with all possible expedition, to find himself at <HI>Paris,</HI> not making the least question but
<PB N="9" REF="310"/>
that he should convert the Queen, from any farther thought of send∣ing for the Prince into <HI>France,</HI> and as easily obtain her consent and ap∣probation for his repairing into <HI>Ireland;</HI> and he made as little doubt, with the Queen's help, and by his own dexterity, to prevail with <HI>France</HI> to send a good supply of Money by him into <HI>Ireland;</HI> by which he should acquire a most universal reputation, and be the most welcome Man alive to the Lord Lieutenant: and transported with this happy auguration, he left <HI>Jersy;</HI> leaving at the same time his two Ships, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence he goes into</HI> France.</NOTE> his Soldiers, and half a douzen Gentlemen of Quality (who, upon his desire, and many promises, had kept him Company from <HI>Ireland)</HI> with∣out <MILESTONE N="10"/> one penny of Money to subsist on during his absence.</P>
<P>AS SOON as he came to <HI>Paris,</HI> and had seen the Queen (whom he found very well inclined to do all she could for the relief of <HI>Ireland,</HI> but <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Trans∣actions there with the Queen of</HI> Eng∣land <HI>and Car∣dinal</HI> Maza∣rin.</NOTE> resolute to have the Prince her Son immediately with her, notwith∣standing all the reasons press'd against it by the Lords of the King's Coun∣cil, who had been sent from <HI>Jersy)</HI> He attended the Cardinal; who un∣derstood him very well, and knew his foible; and receiv'd him with all the ceremony, and demonstration of respect, he could possibly express; enter'd upon the discourse of <HI>England;</HI> celebrated the part which he had acted upon that Stage, in so many Actions of Courage, and Sagacity, <MILESTONE N="20"/> of the highest prudence and circumspection, with an indefatigable In∣dustry and Fidelity. <Q>He told him, “that <HI>France</HI> found too late their own error; that they had been very well content to see the King's great puissance weaken'd by his Domestick troubles, which they wish'd on∣ly should keep him from being able to hurt his Neighbours; but that they never had desired to see him at the Mercy of his own Rebels, which they saw now was like to be the Case; and they were therefore resolv'd to wed his Interest in such a way and manner, as the Queen of <HI>England</HI> should desire; in which he well knew how much her Majesty” would depend upon his Lordship's Counsel.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P><Q>THE Cardinal said, “it was absolutely necessary, since the Crown of <HI>France</HI> resolv'd to wed the King's Interest, that the Person of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> should reside in <HI>France;</HI> that the method he had thought of proceeding in, was that the Queen of <HI>England</HI> should make choice of such a Person, whom she thought best affected, and best qua∣lified for such an imployment, whom the King of <HI>France</HI> would im∣mediately send as his Extraordinary Embassadour to the King and to the Parliament; that he should govern himself wholely by such In∣structions as the Queen should give him; which, he knew, would be his Lordship's work to prepare; that all things should be made ready <MILESTONE N="40"/> assoon as the Queen would nominate the Embassadour; and that, upon the arrival of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> in any part of <HI>France,</HI> assoon as no∣tice should be sent to the Court of it (for which due preparation should be made) the Embassadour should be in the same manner dispatched for <HI>England,</HI> with one only Instruction from <HI>France;</HI> which should be, That he should demand a speedy Answer from the Parliament, whether they would satisfy the demands the <HI>French</HI> Court had made? which if they should refuse to do, he should forthwith, in the King his Masters name, declare War against them, and immediately leave the Kingdom, and return home; and then there should be quickly <MILESTONE N="50"/> such an Army ready, as was worthy for the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to venture his own Person in; and that he should have the honour to redeem” and restore his Father.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="320"/>
THIS discourse ended, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> wanted not Language to ex∣tol the Generosity and the Magnanimity of the resolution, and to pay the Cardinal all his Complements in his own Coin, and, from thence, to enter upon the condition of <HI>Ireland;</HI> <Q>in which the Cardinal presently interrupted him, and told him, “he knew well he was come from thence, and meant to return thither, and likewise the Carriage of the Nuntio. That the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> was too brave a Gentleman, and had merited too much of his Master to be deserted, and <HI>France</HI> was re∣solv'd not to do its business by halves, but to give the King's Affairs an entire relief in all Places; that he should carry a good Supply of <MILESTONE N="10"/> Money with him into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that Armes and Ammunition should be speedily sent after him, and such direction to their Agent there, as should draw off all the <HI>Irish</HI> from the Nuntio, who had not” entirely given themselves up to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Interest.</Q></P>
<P>THE noble Person had that which he most desired; he was presently converted, and undertook to the Queen, that he would presently con∣vert all at <HI>Jersy;</HI> and that the Prince should obey all her Commands; and enter'd into consultation with her upon the Election of an Embas∣sadour, and what Instructions should be given him; which he took upon himself to prepare. Monsieur <HI>Bellievre</HI> was named by the Queen, whom <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Cardinal had design'd for that Office. The Cardinal approv'd the In∣structions, and caused six thousand Pistols to be paid to him, who was to go to <HI>Ireland;</HI> and though it was a much less Sum than he had pro∣mised himself, from the magnificent Expressions the Cardinal had used to him, yet it provided well for his own occasions; so he left the Queen with his usual professions, and confidence, and accompanied those Lords to <HI>Jersy,</HI> who were to attend upon his Highness with her Majesties Or∣ders for the Prince's repair into <HI>France;</HI> for the Advancement whereof the Cardinal was so sollicitous, that he writ a Letter to the old Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> (which he knew he would forthwith send to the Queen; <Q>as he <MILESTONE N="30"/> did) in which he said, “that he had receiv'd very certain advertisement out of <HI>England,</HI> that there were some Persons about the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> in <HI>Jersy,</HI> who had undertaken to deliver his Highness up into” the hands of the Parliament for twenty thousand Pistols;</Q> and this Let∣ter was forthwith sent by the Queen to overtake the Lords, that it might be shewed to the Prince; and that they who attended upon him, might discern, what would be thought of them, if they disswaded his Highness from giving a present obedience to his Mother's Commands.</P>
<P>ASSOON as they came to <HI>Jersy,</HI> the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> used all the means he could to perswade his Friend to concur in his advice for the Prince's <MILESTONE N="40"/> immediate repair into <HI>France.</HI> He told him all that had passed between the Cardinal and him, not leaving out any of the Expressions of the high value his Eminence had of his particular Person: <Q>“That an Embas∣sadour was chosen by his advice, and his Instructions drawn by him,” from no part of which the Embassadour durst swerve</Q> (and, which is very wonderful, he did really believe for that time, that he himself had nominated the Embassadour, and that his Instructions would be exactly observ'd by him; so great a power he had allways over himself, that he could believe any thing which was grateful to him) <Q>“That a War would be presently proclaimed upon their refusal to do what the Embassadour <MILESTONE N="50"/> required, and that there wanted nothing to the expediting this great Affair, but the Prince's repairing into <HI>France</HI> without farther delay; there being no other question concerning that matter, than whether his
<PB N="11" REF="330"/>
Highness should stay in <HI>Jersy?</HI> where there could be no question of his Security, until he could receive express direction from the King his” Father;</Q> and therefore he conjured his Friend to concur in that advice; which would be very grateful to the Queen, and be attended with much benefit to himself; <Q>telling him “how kind her Majesty was to him, and how confident she was of his Service, and that if he should be of another opinion, it would not hinder the Prince from going; who, he knew, was” resolv'd to obey his Mother;</Q> and so concluded his discourse, with those Arguments which he thought were like to make most impression on him; and gave him the Instructions by which the Embassadour was to be guided. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P><Q>HIS Friend, who in truth lov'd him very heartily, though no Man better knew his Infirmities, told him, “whatever the Prince would be disposed to do, he could not change his opinion in point of Counsel, until” the King's pleasure might be known:</Q> <Q>he put him in mind, “how he had been before deceiv'd at <HI>Oxford</HI> by the <HI>Comte de Harcourt,</HI> who was an Embassadour likewise, as We then thought, named by our selves, and whose Instructions he had likewise drawn; and yet, he could not but well remember how foully that business had been ma∣naged, and how disobligingly He himself had been treated by that Em∣bassadour; and therefore he could not but wonder, that the same Ar∣tifices <MILESTONE N="20"/> should again prevail with him; and that he could imagine that the Instructions he had drawn, would be at all consider'd, or pursued, farther than they might contribute to what the Cardinal for the pre∣sent design'd; of the integrity whereof, they had no Evidence, but” had reason enough to suspect it.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> staied at <HI>Paris</HI> with the Queen full three Weeks; having only prevailed with her to suspend her present commands for the Prince's remove from <HI>Jersy,</HI> until she should have clear Intelligence where the King was, and how he was treated, though she declared a positive resolution that his Highness should come <MILESTONE N="30"/> to <HI>Paris,</HI> let the Intelligence be what it could be; and, in the end, they were well assured that his Majesty had put himself into the <HI>Scots</HI> Army as it lay before <HI>Newark;</HI> and that, assoon as he came thither, he had caused that Garrison to deliver the Town into the hands of the <HI>Scots;</HI> and that thereupon the <HI>Scots</HI> marched presently away to <HI>New-Castle:</HI> That they had press'd the King to do many things, which he had abso∣lutely refused to do; and that thereupon they had put very strict Guards upon his Majesty, and would not permit any Man to repair to him, or to speak with him; so that his Majesty look'd upon himself as a Pri∣soner, and resolv'd to make another Escape from them assoon as he <MILESTONE N="40"/> could. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> who attended upon him in his Journey from <HI>Oxford</HI> as his sole Servant, was forbid to come any more near him; and if he had not put himself on board a Vessel, then at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and bound for <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> would have deliver'd him up to the Par∣liament. Monsieur <HI>Montrevil,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Envoy, pretended that they were so incensed against him for briskly expostulating with them for their ill Treatment of the King, that it was no longer safe for him to remain in their Quarters, and more dangerous to return to <HI>London;</HI> and therefore, he had likewise procured a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship to land him in <HI>France,</HI> and was come to <HI>Paris</HI> before the Lords return'd to <HI>Jersy.</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE Queen thought now she had more reason to be confirm'd in her former resolution for the speedy remove of the Prince, and it was pre∣tended that he had brought a Letter from the King, which was de∣cipher'd
<PB N="12" REF="340"/>
by the Lord <HI>Jermin;</HI> <Q>in which, he said, “that he did believe that the Prince could not be safe any where but with the Queen; and therefore wished, that if he were not there already, he should be speedi∣ly” sent for;</Q> and <HI>Montrevil</HI> professed to have a Message by word of mouth to the same purpose; whereas M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> who left the King but the day before <HI>Montrevil,</HI> and was as entirely trusted by the King as any Man in <HI>England,</HI> brought no such Message; <Q>and confess'd to the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> “that he thought it very pernicious to the King that the Prince should come into <HI>France</HI> in that conjuncture, and before it was known how the <HI>Scots</HI> would deal with him; and that the King's <MILESTONE N="10"/> opinion of the convenience of his coming into <HI>France,</HI> could proceed” from nothing but the thought of his insecurity in <HI>Jersy.</HI></Q> The Lord <HI>Capel</HI> offer'd to undertake a Journey himself to <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and to re∣ceive the King's positive Commands, which he was confident would be submitted to, and obeyed by all the Council as well as by himself; but the Queen was positive, that, without any more delay, the Prince should immediately repair to her; and, to that purpose, she sent the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> (who was Governour of <HI>Jersy)</HI> together with the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> and other Lords and Gentle∣men, who, with the two Lords who had been sent to her by the Prince, <MILESTONE N="20"/> should make hast to <HI>Jersy</HI> to see her Commands executed. Whilst they are upon their Journey thither, it will be seasonable to enquire how the King came to involve himself in that perplexity, out of which he was never able afterwards to recover his Liberty and Freedom.</P>
<P>MONSIEUR <HI>Montrevil</HI> was a Person utterly unknown to me, nor <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A farther Ac∣count of Mon∣sieur</HI> Montre∣vil<HI>'s Negotia∣tion with the</HI> Scots.</NOTE> had I ever intercourse or correspondence with him; so that what I shall say of him cannot proceed from affection or prejudice, nor if I shall say any thing for his vindication from those reproaches which he did, and does lie under, both with the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, countenanced enough by the discountenance he receiv'd from the Cardinal after his <MILESTONE N="30"/> return, when he was, after the first account he had given of his Nego∣tiation, restrain'd from coming to the Court, and forbid to remain in <HI>Paris,</HI> and lay under a form'd, declar'd dislike till his death; which with grief of mind shortly ensued. But as it is no unusual hard-heartedness in such chief Ministers, to sacrifice such Instruments, how innocent so∣ever, to their own dark purposes, so it is probable, that temporary Cloud would soon have vanished, and that it was only cast over him, that he might be thereby secluded from the conversation of the <HI>English</HI> Court; which must have been reasonably very inquisitive, and might thereby have discover'd somewhat which the other Court was carefully <MILESTONE N="40"/> to conceal: I say if what I hear set down of that transaction, shall ap∣pear some vindication of that Gentleman from those imputations un∣der which his memory remains blasted, it can be imputed only to the love of truth, which ought, in common honesty, to be preserv'd in History as the very Soul of it, towards all Persons who come to be men∣tion'd in it; and since I have in my hands all the original Letters which passed from him to the King, and the King's Answers and Directions thereupon, or such Authentick Copies thereof, as have been by my self examin'd with the Originals, I take it to be a duty incumbent on me to clear him from any guilt with which his memory lies unjustly charged, <MILESTONE N="50"/> and to make a candid interpretation of those Actions, which appear to have resulted from ingenuity, and upright Intentions, how unsuccess∣ful soever.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="350"/>
HE was then a young Gentleman of parts very equal to the trust the Cardinal reposed in him, and to the Imployment he gave him; and of a Nature not inclined to be made use of in ordinary dissimulation and couzenage. Whilst he took his Measures only from the <HI>Scotish</HI> Com∣missioners at <HI>London,</HI> and from those Presbyterians whom he had op∣portunity to converse with there, he did not give the King the least En∣couragement to expect a conjunction, or any complayance from the one or the other, upon any cheaper price or condition than the whole al∣teration of the Government of the Church by Bishops, and an entire conformity to the Covenant; and he used all the Arguments which oc∣curr'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> to him, to perswade his Majesty that all other hopes of Agree∣ment with them were desperate; and when he saw his Majesty unmove∣able in that particular, and resolute to undergo the utmost event of War, before he would wound his peace of mind, and conscience, with such an odious concession, he undertook that Journey we mention'd in the end of the last year, to discover whether the same rude and rigid spirit, which Govern'd those Commissioners at <HI>Westminster,</HI> possessed also the chief Officers of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, and that Committee of State that allways remain'd with the Army.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> Army was then before <HI>Newark;</HI> and, in his passage thi∣ther, <MILESTONE N="20"/> he waited upon the King at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and was confirm'd in what he had reason before to be confident of, that it was absolutely impossi∣ble ever to prevail with his Majesty to give up the Church to the most impetuous demands they could make, or to the greatest necessity him∣self could be environ'd with; but as to any other concessions which might satisfy their ambition or their profit, which were allways power∣ful and irresistible Spells upon that Party, he had ample Authority and Commission to comply with the most extravagant demands from Per∣sons like to make good what they undertook, except such Propositions as might be mischievous to the Marquis of <HI>Montrose;</HI> whom the King <MILESTONE N="30"/> resolv'd never to desert, nor any who had joyn'd with and assisted him; all which, he desired to unite to those who might now be perswaded to serve him. His Majesty, for his better information, recommended him to some Persons who had then Command in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; of whose affections and inclinations to his Service, he had as much confidence, at least, as he ought to have; and of their Credit, and Courage, and In∣terest, a greater than was due to them.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Montrevil</HI> came to the Army, and after he had endeavour'd to undeceive those who had been perswaded to believe, that a perem∣ptory and obstinate insisting upon the Alteration of the Church Govern∣ment <MILESTONE N="40"/> (the expectation, and assurance whereof, had indeed first enabled them to make that expedition) would at last prevail over the King's Spirit, as it had done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he found those in whom the Power, at least the Command of the Army was, much more moderate than he expected, and the Committee which presided in the Counsels, rather devising and projecting Expedients how they might recede from the rigour of their former demands, than peremptory to adhere to them, and willing he should believe that they stayed for the coming of the Lord Chancellor out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who was daily expected, before they would declare their resolution; not that they were, for the present, <MILESTONE N="50"/> without one. They were very much pleased that the King offer'd, and desir'd to come to them, and remain in the Army with them, if he might be secured of a good reception for himself, and for his Servants
<PB N="14" REF="360"/>
who should attend him, and his Friends who should resort to him; and the principal Officers of the Army spoke of that, as a thing they so much wished, that it could be in no body's power to hinder it, if there were any who would attempt it; and they who had the greatest power in the conduct of the most secret Counsels, took pains to be thought to have much franker resolutions in that particular, than they thought yet seasonable to express in direct Undertakings; and imployed those who were known to be most entirely trusted by them, and some of those who had been recommended to him by the King, to assure him that he might confidently advise his Majesty to repair to the Army, upon the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Terms himself had proposed; and that they would send a good Body of their Horse, to meet his Majesty at any place he should appoint to con∣duct him in safety to them. Upon which encouragement, <HI>Montrevil</HI> prepared a Paper to be fign'd by himself, and sent to the King as his Engagement; and shew'd it to those who had been most clear to him in their Expressions of duty to the King; which, being approv'd by them, he sent by the other who had appear'd to him to be trusted by those who were in the highest Trust to be communicated to them, who had in a manner excused themselves for being so reserv'd towards him, as being necessary in that conjuncture of their Affairs, when there evi∣dently <MILESTONE N="20"/> appear'd to be the most hostile jealousy between the Indepen∣dent Army and them. When the paper was likewise return'd to him with approbation after their perusal, he sent it to the King; which pa∣per is here faithfully translated out of the original.</P>
<P><Q>“I DO promise in the Name of the King and Queen Regent (my <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Paper Montrevil sent to the King, being a promise for the</HI> Scots <HI>re∣ceiving the King,</HI> Apr. 1.</NOTE> Master and Mistress) and by virtue of the powers that I have from their Majesties, That if the King of Great Britain shall put himself into the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, he shall be there receiv'd as their natural Soveraign; and that he shall be with them in all freedom of his Conscience and <MILESTONE N="30"/> Honour; and that all such of his Subjects and Servants as shall be there with him, shall be safely and honourably protected in their per∣sons; and that the said <HI>Scots,</HI> shall really and effectually joyn with the said King of Great Britain, and also receive all such Persons as shall come in unto him, and joyn with them for his Majesties preservation: And that they shall protect all his Majesties party to the utmost of their power, as his Majesty will command all those under his obe∣dience to do the like to them; and that they shall employ their Ar∣mies and Forces, to assist his Majesty in the procuring of a happy and well grounded Peace, for the good of his Majesty and his said King∣doms, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and in recovery of his Majesties just Rights.

<P><Q>THE King had proposed, “that there might be a Union between them and the Marquis of <HI>Montrose;</HI> and that his Forces might be” joyn'd with their Army;</Q> <Q>which they had said “they could not con∣sent to, with reference to the person of <HI>Montrose;</HI> who, after so much blood spilt by him of many of the greatest Families, they thought could not be safe among them: whereupon the King had declared,” that he would send him his Extraordinary Embassadour into <HI>France;</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="40"/> which they appear'd not to contradict, but had now changed their mind; of which <HI>Montrevil</HI> likewise gave an Account in the same Letter: <Q>“That they could not give their consent that the Marquis of <HI>Montrose</HI> should go Embassadour into <HI>France,</HI> but into any other place, he might; and that they again, without limiting the time, insisted upon” settling the Presbyterian Government;</Q> <Q>and he concluded his Letter with these words, “I will say no more but this, that his Majesty and You know the <HI>Scots</HI> better than I do; I represent these things naked∣ly to you, as I am obliged to do; I have not taken upon me the bold∣ness to give any Counsel to his Majesty; yet if he hath any other re∣fuge, <MILESTONE N="50"/> or means to make better conditions, I think he ought not to accept of these; but if he sees all things desperate every where else, and that he and his Servants cannot be secure with his Parliament of

<P>IN another Letter dated the next day after (the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April)</HI> to the same Secretary, he hath these words; <Q>“I have Orders from the Depu∣ties” of <HI>Scotland</HI> to assure you, that they will not herein fail (which related to sending the Horse to meet his Majesty)</Q> <Q>“assoon as they shall know his day; and that the King shall be receiv'd into the Army as” hath been promised; and that his Conscience shall not be forced.</Q> And in the last Letter, which his Majesty or the Secretary receiv'd from him, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and which was dated the 20<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April</HI> 1646, there are these words, <Q>“They tell me that they will do more than can be express'd; but let not his Majesty hope for any more than I send him word of; that he may not be deceiv'd; and let him take his Measures aright; for certainly” the Enterprise is full of danger:</Q> <Q>yet, in the same Letter, he says “the disposition of the Chiefs of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army is such as the King can de∣sire; they begin to draw off their Troops towards <HI>Burton,</HI> and the hindering his Majesty from falling into the hands of the <HI>English</HI> is of so great importance to them, that it cannot be believ'd but that they will” do all that lies in their power to hinder it.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THIS was the proceeding of Monsieur <HI>Montrevil</HI> in that whole Transaction; and if he were too sanguine upon his first conversation with the Officers of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, and some of the Committee, and when he sign'd that Engagement upon the first of <HI>April,</HI> he made hast to re∣tract that confidence, and was in all his dispatches afterwards phlegma∣tick enough; and, after his Majesty had put himself into their hands, he did honestly and stoutly charge all the particular Persons with the promises and Engagements they had given to him, and did all he could to make the Cardinal sensible of the indignity that was offer'd to that Crown in the violation of those promises, and Engagements; which <MILESTONE N="30"/> was the reason of his being commanded to return home, assoon as the King came to <HI>New-Castle;</HI> lest his too keen resentment might irritate the <HI>Scots,</HI> and make it appear to the Parliament how far <HI>France</HI> was en∣gaged in that whole Negotiation; which the Cardinal had no mind should appear to the world; and there can be no doubt, but that the cautions and animadversions which the King receiv'd from <HI>Montrevil</HI> after his Engagement, would have diverted him from that enterprise, if his Majesty had discern'd any other course to take that had been pre∣ferable even to the hazard that he saw he must undergo with the <HI>Scots;</HI> but he was clearly destitute of any other Refuge. Every day brought <MILESTONE N="40"/> the news of the loss of some Garrison; and as <HI>Oxford</HI> was already block'd up at a distance, by those Horse which <HI>Fairfax</HI> had sent out of the West to that purpose, or to wait upon the King, and follow him close, if he should remove out of <HI>Oxford;</HI> so he had soon reduced <HI>Exeter,</HI> and some other Garrisons in <HI>Devonshire.</HI> The Governours then, when there was no visible and apparent hope of being reliev'd, thought that they might deliver up their Garrisons before they were pressed with the last Extre∣mities, that they might obtain the better conditions; and yet it was ob∣serv'd that better and more honourable Conditions were not given to any, than to those who kept the Places they were trusted with, till they had <MILESTONE N="50"/> not one days Victual left; of which We shall observe more hereafter. By this means <HI>Fairfax</HI> was within three days of <HI>Oxford</HI> before the King left it, or fully resolv'd what to do.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="390"/>
<Q>HIS Majesty had before sent to two eminent Commanders of name, who had blocked up the Town at a distance, “that if they would pass” their words (how slender a security soever, from such Men who had broken so many Oaths, for the safety of the King)</Q> <Q>“that they would immediately conduct him to the Parliament, he would have put him∣self” into their hands;</Q> for he was yet perswaded to think so well of the City of <HI>London,</HI> that he would not have been unwilling to have found himself there; but those Officers would submit to no such Engage∣ments; and great care was taken to have strict Guards round about <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> that he might not get thither. What should the King do? There <MILESTONE N="10"/> was one thing most formidable to him, which he was resolv'd to avoid, that was, to be inclosed in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and so to be given up, or taken, when the Town should be surrender'd, as a Prisoner to the Indepen∣dents Army; which he was advertised, from all hands, would treat him very barbarously.</P>
<P>IN this perplexity, he chose rather to commit himself to the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; which yet he did not trust so far as to give them notice of his Journey, by sending for a party of their Horse to meet him, as they had profer'd; but early in the morning, upon the 27<SUP>th</SUP> day of <HI>April,</HI> he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King leaves</HI> Oxford Apr. 27. 1646.</NOTE> went out of <HI>Oxford,</HI> attended only by <HI>John Ashburnham,</HI> and a Divine <MILESTONE N="20"/> (one <HI>Hudson)</HI> who understood the by-ways as well as the common, and was indeed a very skilful Guide. In this Equipage he left <HI>Oxford</HI> on a <HI>Monday,</HI> leaving those of his Council in <HI>Oxford</HI> who were privy to his going out, not inform'd whether he would go to the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, or get privately into <HI>London,</HI> and lie there concealed, till he might choose that which was best; and it was generally believ'd, that he had not within himself at that time a fixt resolution what he would do; which was the more credited because it was nine days after his leaving <HI>Oxford,</HI> before it was known where the King was; insomuch as <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who came before it the fifth day after his Majesty was gone, was sate down, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> had made his circumvallation about <HI>Oxford,</HI> before he knew that the King was in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; but the King had wasted that time in se∣veral places; whereof some, were Gentlemens Houses (where he was not unknown, though untaken notice of) purposely to be inform'd of the condition of the Marquis of <HI>Montrose,</HI> and to find some secure pas∣sage that he might get to him; which he did exceedingly desire; but in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Puts himself into the</HI> Scots <HI>Army before</HI> Newark.</NOTE> the end, went into the <HI>Scots</HI> Army before <HI>Newark,</HI> and sent for <HI>Mon∣trevil</HI> to come to him.</P>
<P>IT was very early in the morning when the King went to the Ge∣neral's lodging, and discover'd himself to him; who either was, or seem'd <MILESTONE N="40"/> to be, exceedingly surprised, and confounded at his Majesties presence; and knew not what to say; but presently gave notice of it to the Com∣mittee, who were no less perplexed. An Express was presently sent to the Parliament at <HI>Westminster,</HI> to inform them of the unexpected News, as a thing the <HI>Scots</HI> had not the least imagination of. The Par∣liament were so disorder'd with the Intelligence, that at first they re∣solv'd to command their General to raise the Siege before <HI>Oxford,</HI> and to march with all expedition to <HI>Newark;</HI> <Q>but the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners at <HI>London,</HI> diverted them from that, by assuring them “that all their” Orders would meet with an absolute obedience in their Army:</Q> so they <MILESTONE N="50"/> made a short dispatch to them, in which it was evident that they be∣liev'd the King had gone to them by invitation, and not out of his own free choice; <Q>and implying, “that they should shortly receive farther”
<PB N="18" REF="400"/>
direction from them;</Q> <Q>and in the mean time, “that they should care∣fully watch that his Majesty did not dispose himself to go some whither” else.</Q> The great care in the Army, was, that there might be only re∣spect and good manners shew'd towards the King, without any thing of affection or dependence; and therefore the General never asked the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of treating his Majesty.</NOTE> Word of him, or any Orders, nor, willingly, suffer'd the Officers of the Army to resort to, or to have any discourse with his Majesty. <HI>Mon∣trevil</HI> was ill look'd upon, as the Man who had brought this inconve∣nience upon them without their consent; but he was not frighted from owning and declaring what had passed between them, what they had <MILESTONE N="10"/> promised, and what they were engaged to do. However, though the King liked not the treatment he receiv'd, he was not without apprehen∣sion, that <HI>Fairfax</HI> might be forthwith appointed to decline all other En∣terprises, and to bring himself near the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, they being too near together already; and therefore he forthwith gave order to the Lord <HI>Bellasis</HI> to surrender <HI>Newark,</HI> that the <HI>Scots</HI> might march North∣ward; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King or∣ders</HI> Newark <HI>to be surren∣der'd; where∣upon the</HI> Scots <HI>Army marches Northward with the King to</HI> New-Ca∣stle.</NOTE> which they resolv'd to do; and he giving up that place, which he could have defended for some Months longer from that Enemy, upon honourable conditions, that Army with great expedition marched to∣wards <HI>New-Castle;</HI> which the King was glad of, though their behaviour <MILESTONE N="20"/> to him was still the same; and great strictness used that he might not confer with any Man who was not well known to them, much less re∣ceive Letters from any.</P>
<P>IT was an observation in that time, that the first publishing of extra∣ordinary News was from the Pulpit; and by the Preacher's Text, and his manner of discourse upon it, the Auditors might judge, and com∣monly foresaw, what was like to be next done in the Parliament or Council of State. The first Sermon that was preach'd before the King, after the Army rose from <HI>Newark</HI> to march Northwards, was upon the 19. <HI>chap.</HI> of the 2 Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> the 41, 42, and 43. <HI>verses.</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<Q><P>41. <HI>And behold, all the men of Israel came to the King, and said unto the King, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the King and his houshold, and all Davids men with him over Jordan?</HI></P>
<P>42. <HI>And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the King is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the Kings cost? or hath he given us any gift?</HI></P>
<P>43. <HI>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>We have ten parts in the King, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our King? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</HI></P></Q>
<P>UPON which words, the Preacher gave Men cause to believe, that now they had gotten their King they resolv'd to keep him, and to ad∣here to him. But his Majesty came no sooner to <HI>New-Castle,</HI> than both Monsieur <HI>Montrevil</HI> was restrain'd from having any conference <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Where</HI> Mon∣trevil <HI>was re∣strain'd from him.</HI></NOTE> with him, <Q>and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham</HI> was advised “to shift for himself, or” <MILESTONE N="50"/> else that he should be deliver'd up to the Parliament;</Q> and both the one, and the other, were come to <HI>Paris</HI> when the Queen sent those Lords to hasten the Prince's remove from <HI>Jersy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="410"/>
WHEN those Lords, with their great Train, came to <HI>Jersy,</HI> which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Jer∣min <HI>and other Lords arrive at</HI> Jersy, <HI>about the end of</HI> June, <HI>from the Queen, to bring the Prince into</HI> France.</NOTE> was towards the end of <HI>June,</HI> they brought with them a Letter from the Queen to the Prince; <Q>in which she told him, “that she was now fully satisfied, from the Intelligence she had from <HI>New-Castle</HI> and <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> that he could not make any longer residence in <HI>Jersy</HI> without ap∣parent danger of falling into the Enemies hands; and that if he should continue there, all possible attempts would be suddainly made, as well by Treachery as by Force, to get his Person into their Power; and therefore, her Majesty did positively require him, to give immediate obedience to the King's Commands, mention'd in the Letter which” <MILESTONE N="10"/> she had lately sent by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Dudley Wyat</HI></Q> (which is set out before) <Q>“and reiterated in a Letter which she had since receiv'd from the King by” Monsieur <HI>Montrevil.</HI></Q> Her Majesty said, <Q>“that she had the greatest assurance from the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> that possibly could be given, for his honourable reception, and full liberty to continue there, and to depart from thence, at his pleasure; and she engaged her own word, that whenever his Council should find it fit for him to go out of <HI>France,</HI> she would never oppose it; and that during his residence in that King∣dom, all matters of importance which might concern himself, or re∣late to his Majesties affairs, should be debated and resolv'd by himself <MILESTONE N="20"/> and the Council, in such manner as they ought to have been, if he” had continued in <HI>England,</HI> or in <HI>Jersy:</HI></Q> and concluded, <Q>“that he should” make all possible hast to her.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lords which arrived with this dispatch from her Majesty, had no imagination that there would have been any question of his High∣ness's complyance with the Queen's command; and therefore, assoon as they had kiss'd the Prince's hand, which was in the afternoon, they de∣sired that the Council might presently be called; and when they came together, the Lords <HI>Jermin, Digby,</HI> and <HI>Wentworth,</HI> being likewise pre∣sent, and sitting in the Council, <Q>they desired the Prince “that his Mo∣ther's Letter might be read; and then, since they conceiv'd there <MILESTONE N="30"/> could be no debate upon his Highness's yielding obedience to the Com∣mand of the King and Queen, that they might only consider of the day when he might begin his Journey, and of the order he would ob∣serve” in it.</Q> The Lords of the Council represented to the Prince, <Q>“that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates in the Prince's Coun∣cil concerning his going.</NOTE> they were the only Persons that were accountable to the King, and to the Kingdom, for any resolution his Highness should take, and for the consequence thereof; and that the other Lords who were present, had no title to deliver their advice, or to be present at the debate, they being in no degree responsible for what his Highness should re∣solve to do; and therefore desired that the whole matter might be de∣bated; <MILESTONE N="40"/> the State of the King's present condition understood as far as it might be; and the reasons consider'd which made it counsellable for his Highness to repair into <HI>France,</HI> and what might be said against it; and the rather, because it was very notorious that the King had given no positive direction in the point, but upon a supposition that the Prince could not remain secure in <HI>Jersy;</HI> which was likewise the ground of the Queen's last command; and which they believ'd had no founda∣tion of reason; and that his residence there might be very unquestion∣ably” safe.</Q> This begot some warmth, and contradiction between Per∣sons; <MILESTONE N="50"/> insomuch as the Prince thought it very necessary to suspend the debate till the next day, to the end that by several and private con∣ferences together between the Lords who came from <HI>Paris,</HI> and those
<PB N="20" REF="420"/>
who were in <HI>Jersy,</HI> they might convert, or confirm each other in the same opinions; at least that the next debate might be free from passion and unkindness; and so the Council rose, and the several Lords betook themselves to use the same Arguments, or such as they thought more agreeable to the several Persons, as the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> had before done to his Friend, and with the same success. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Ca∣pel <HI>delivers his opinion a∣gainst at.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>THE next day when they were called together, the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> gave an account of all that had pass'd with the Queen from the time that the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> and he came thither; <Q>and “that the reasons they had carried from the Prince, had so far prevailed with the Queen, that <MILESTONE N="10"/> her Majesty resolv'd to take no final resolution till she receiv'd farther advertisement of the King's pleasure; and he did not think that the information she had receiv'd from Monsieur <HI>Montrevil,</HI> had weight enough to produce the quick resolution it had done: that he thought it still most absolutely necessary, to receive the King's positive Com∣mand before the Prince should remove out of his Majesties own Do∣minions; there being no shadow of cause to suspect his security there: That he had then offer'd to the Queen, that he would himself make a Journey to <HI>New-Castle</HI> to receive his Majesties Commands; and that he now made the same offer to the Prince; and because it did appear <MILESTONE N="20"/> that his Majesty was very strictly guarded, and that Persons did not easily find access to him, and that his own Person might be seised upon in his Journey thither, or his stay there, or his return back, and so his Highness might be disappointed of the Information he expected, and remain still in the same uncertainty as to a resolution, he did propose, and consent to, as his opinion, that if he did not return again to <HI>Jersy</HI> within the space of one Month, the Prince should resolve to remove into <HI>France,</HI> if in the mean time such preparatories were made” there, as he thought were necessary, and were yet defective.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE said, “he had been lately at <HI>Paris</HI> by the Prince's Command <MILESTONE N="30"/> and had receiv'd many graces from the Queen, who had vouchsafed to impart all her own reasons for the Prince's remove, and the grounds for the confidence she had of the Affections of <HI>France;</HI> but, that he did still wonder, if the Court of <HI>France</HI> had so great a desire, as was pretended, that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> should repair thither, that in the two Months time his Highness had been in <HI>Jersy,</HI> they had never sent a Gentleman to see him, and to invite him to come thither; nor had these who came now from the Queen, brought so much as a Pass for him to come into <HI>France:</HI> that he could not but observe, that all We had hitherto proposed to our selves from <HI>France,</HI> had proved in no <MILESTONE N="40"/> degree answerable to our expectations; as the five thousand Foot, which We had expected in the West before the Prince came from thence; and that We had more reason to be jealous now than ever, since it had been by the advice of <HI>France,</HI> that the King had now put himself into the hands of the <HI>Scots;</HI> and therefore We ought to be the more watch∣ful” in the disposing the Person of the Prince by their advice likewise.</Q> <Q>He concluded, “that he could not give his advice, or consent, that the Prince should repair into <HI>France,</HI> till the King's pleasure might be known, or such other circumstances might be provided in <HI>France,</HI> as” had been hitherto neglected.</Q> <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Digby</HI> and the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> wonder'd very much, <Q>“that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Argu∣ment of the Lord</HI> Digby <HI>and Lord</HI> Jer¦min <HI>for it</HI></NOTE> there should be any doubt of the affections of <HI>France,</HI> or that it should be believ'd that the Queen could be deceiv'd, or not well enough in∣form'd”
<PB N="21" REF="430"/>
in that particular:</Q> They related many particulars which had passed between the Cardinal and them in private conferences, and the great professions of affection he made to the King. <Q>They said, “that the Embassadour who was now appointed to go thither, was chosen by the Queen her self, and had no other Instructions but what she had given him; and that he was not to stay there above a Month; at the end of which he was to denounce War against the Parliament, if they did not comply with such propositions as he made; and so to return; and then, that there should be an Army of thirty thousand Men im∣mediately transported into <HI>England,</HI> with the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> in the <MILESTONE N="10"/> head of them; that the Embassadour was already gone from <HI>Paris,</HI> but was not to embark till he should first receive advertisement that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was landed in <HI>France;</HI> for that <HI>France</HI> had no rea∣son to interest themselves so far in the King's Quarrel, if the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> should refuse to venture his Person with them; or, it may be,” engage against them upon another Interest.</Q></P>
<P>THEY therefore besought the Prince, and the Lords, <Q>“that they would consider well, whether he would disappoint his Father and him∣self of so great fruit as they were even ready to gather, and of which they could not be disappointed but by unseasonable jealousies of the <MILESTONE N="20"/> Integrity of <HI>France,</HI> and by delaying to give them satisfaction in the” remove of the Prince from <HI>Jersy.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THESE Arguments press'd with all the assurance imaginable, by Per∣sons of that near trust and confidence with the King, who were not like to be deceiv'd themselves, nor to have any purpose to deceive the Prince, wrought so far with his Highness, that he declared <Q>“he would comply” <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince re∣solves to go into</HI> France.</NOTE> with the Commands of the Queen, and forthwith remove into <HI>France;</HI></Q> which being resolv'd, <Q>he wished “there might be no more debate upon that point, but that they would all prepare to go with him, and that there might be as great an Unity in their Counsels, as had hitherto” <MILESTONE N="30"/> allways been.</Q></P>
<P>THIS so positive Declaration of the Prince of his own Resolution, made all farther Arguments against it not only useless but indecent; <Q>and therefore they replied not to that point, yet every Man of the Coun∣cil, the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> only excepted, besought his Highness “that <NOTE PLACE="marg">All but one of his Council dis∣sent, and stay behind.</NOTE> he would give them his Pardon, if they did not farther wait upon him; for they conceiv'd their Commission to be now at an end; and that they could not assume any Authority by it to themselves, if they waited upon him into <HI>France;</HI> nor expect that their counsels there should be” hearken'd unto, when they were now rejected.</Q> And so, after some <MILESTONE N="40"/> sharp replies between the Lords of different judgements, which made the Council break up the sooner, they who resolv'd not to go into <HI>France</HI> took their leaves of the Prince, and kiss'd his hand; his Highness then declaring, <Q>“that he would be gone the next day by five of the Clock in the morning, though the cross winds, and want of some Provisions which were necessary for the Journey, detained him there four or five” days longer;</Q> during which time, the dissenting Lords every day waited upon him, and were receiv'd by him very graciously; his Highness well knowing and expressing to them a confidence in their Affections, and that they would be sure to wait upon him, when ever his occasions <MILESTONE N="50"/> should be ready for their Service. But between them and the other Lords, there grew by degrees so great a strangeness, that, the last day, they did not so much as speak to each other; they who came from the
<PB N="22" REF="440"/>
Queen taking it very ill, that the others had presumed to dissent from what her Majesty had so positively commanded. And though they nei∣ther loved their Persons, nor cared for their Company, and without doubt, if they had gone into <HI>France,</HI> would have made them quickly weary of theirs; yet, in that conjuncture, they believ'd that the dissent and separation of all those Persons who were trusted by the King with the Person of the Prince, would blast their counsel, and weigh down the single positive determination of the Queen her self.</P>
<P>ON the other side, the others did not think they were treated in that manner as was due to Persons so entrusted; but that in truth many ill <MILESTONE N="10"/> consequences would result from that suddain departure of the Prince out of the King's Dominions, where his residence might have been se∣cure in respect of the Affairs of <HI>England;</HI> where, besides the Garrisons of <HI>Silly</HI> and <HI>Pendennis</HI> (which might allways be reliev'd by Sea) there remain'd still within his Majesties obedience, <HI>Oxford, Worcester, Walling∣ford, Ludlow,</HI> and some other places of less name; which, upon any divisions among themselves, that were naturally to be expected, might have turn'd the Scale: Nor did they know, of what ill consequence it might be to the King, that in such a conjuncture the Prince should be removed, when it might be more counsellable that he should appear in <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham</HI>'s opinion, which he had deliver'd to the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> wrought very much upon them; for that a Man so entirely trusted by the King, who had seen him as lately as any Body, should bring no directions from his Majesty to his Son, and that he should believe, that it was fitter for the Prince to stay in <HI>Jersy</HI> than to remove into <HI>France,</HI> till his Majesties pleasure was better understood, confirm'd them in the judgement they had deliver'd.</P>
<P>BUT there was another reason that prevailed with those who had been made Privy to it, and which, out of Duty to the Queen, they <MILESTONE N="30"/> thought not fit to publish, or insist upon; it was the Instructions given to <HI>Bellievre</HI> (and which too much manifested the irresolution her Ma∣jesty had) not to insist upon what they well knew the King would never depart from; for, though that Embassadour was required to do all he could to perswade the Presbyterians to joyn with the King's Party, and not to insist upon the destruction of the Church, yet if he found that could not be compassed, He was to press, as the advice of the King his Master, his Majesty to part with the Church, and to satisfy the Presby∣terians in that point, as the advice of the Queen his Wife, and of his own Party; which method was afterwards observed and pursued by <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Bellievre;</HI> which those Lords perfectly abhorr'd; and thought not fit ever to concur in, or to be privy to those Counsels that had begun, and were to carry on that confusion.</P>
<P>WITHIN a day or two after the Prince's departure from <HI>Jersy,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Berkshire</HI> left it likewise, and went for <HI>England;</HI> the Lords <HI>Capel, Hopton,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, remain'd together in <HI>Jersy</HI> to expect the King's pleasure, and to attend a conjuncture to ap∣pear again in his Majesties Service; of all which they found an oppor∣tunity to inform his Majesty, who very well interpreted all that they had done according to the sincerity of their hearts; yet did believe, that <MILESTONE N="50"/> if they had likewise waited upon the Prince into <HI>France,</HI> they might have been able to have prevented or diverted those violent pressures, which were afterwards made upon him from thence, and gave him
<PB N="23" REF="450"/>
more disquiet than he suffer'd from all the Insolence of his Enemies.</P>
<P>IN a word, if the King's Fortune had been farther to be conducted by any fixt Rules of policy and discretion, and if the current towards his destruction had not run with such a torrent, as carried down all ob∣structions of sobriety and wisdom, and made the confusion inevitable, it is very probable that this so suddain remove of the Prince from <HI>Jersy</HI> with all the circumstances thereof, might have been look'd upon, and censured with severity, as an Action that swerv'd from that prudence which by the fundamental Rules of policy had been long established; <MILESTONE N="10"/> but by the fatal and prodigious Calamities which follow'd, all Counsels of wise and unwise Men proving equally unsuccessful, the Memory of what had passed before, grew to be the less thought upon and con∣sidered.</P>
<P>WHILST these things were thus transacted in other parts, the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Transactions relating to the King in the</HI> Scots <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> remain'd yet in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; that people behaving themselves in such a manner, that most Men believ'd they would never have parted with his Majesty till a full Peace had been made. The Parliament made many sharp instances <Q>“that the King might be deliver'd into their hands; and that the <HI>Scots</HI> Army would return into their own Country, having” <MILESTONE N="20"/> done what they were sent for, and the War being at an end.</Q> To which the Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> seem'd to answer with Courage enough, and in∣sisted most on those Arguments of the King's legal Rights, which had been, in all his Majesties Declarations, urged against the Parliaments proceedings; and which indeed could never be answer'd; and as much condemn'd Them, as the Parliament.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, though the King receiv'd all outward respect, he was in truth in the condition of a Prisoner; no Servant whom he could trust suffer'd to come to him; and though many Persons of Quality who had serv'd the King in the War, when they saw the resolute Answers made by the <HI>Scots,</HI> <Q>“that they neither would nor could compel their” <MILESTONE N="30"/> King to return to the Parliament,</Q> if his Majesty had no mind to do so, repaired to <HI>New-Castle,</HI> where his Majesty was, yet none of them were suffer'd to speak to him; nor could he receive from, or send any Letter to the Queen or Prince; and yet the <HI>Scots</HI> observ'd all distances, and perform'd all the Ceremonies as could have been expected if they had indeed treated him as their King; and made as great profession to him of their Duty and good purposes, <Q>“which they said they would mani∣fest assoon as it should be seasonable; and then his Servants, and Friends” should repair to him with all liberty,</Q> and be well receiv'd: and as they endeavour'd to perswade the King to expect this from them, so they pre∣vailed <MILESTONE N="40"/> with many Officers of that Army, and some of the Nobility, to believe that they meant well, but that it was not yet time to discover their Intentions.</P>
<P>THUS they prevailed with the King to send his positive Orders to the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sends to the Mar∣quis of</HI> Mon∣trose <HI>to dis∣band; which he did.</HI></NOTE> Marquis of <HI>Montrose,</HI> who had indeed done Wonders, to lay down his Armes, and to leave the Kingdom; till when, they pretended they could not declare for his Majesty: and this was done with so much earnestness, and by a particular Messenger known and trusted, that the Marquis obeyed, and transported himself into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THEN they imployed their <HI>Alexander Henderson,</HI> and their other <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They employ</HI> Henderson <HI>to the King to dispute with him concorn∣ing Church Government.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> Clergy, to perswade the King to consent to the extirpation of Episco∣pacy in <HI>England,</HI> as he had in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and it was, and is still believ'd, that if his Majesty would have been induced to have satisfied them in
<PB N="24" REF="460"/>
that particular, they would either have had a party in the Parliament at <HI>Westminster</HI> to have been satisfied therewith, or that they would thereupon have declared for the King, and have presently joyn'd with the Loyal party in all places for his Majesties defence. But the King was too conscientious to buy his Peace at so prophane and sacrilegious a price as was demanded, and he was so much too hard for M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henderson</HI> in the Argumentation (as appears by the papers that passed between them, which were shortly after communicated to the world) that the old Man himself was so far convinced, and converted, that he had a very deep sense of the mischief he had himself been the Author of, or <MILESTONE N="10"/> too much contributed to, and lamented it to his nearest Friends, and Confidents; and dyed of grief, and heart-broken, within a very short <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Hender∣son <HI>dyes short∣ly after.</HI></NOTE> time after he departed from his Majesty.</P>
<P>WHILST the King stayed at <HI>New-Castle, Bellievre</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Em∣bassadour, who was sent from <HI>Paris</HI> after the Prince arriv'd there, and by whom the Cardinal had promised to press the Parliament so impe∣riously, and to denounce a War against them if they refused to yield to what was reasonable towards an Agreement with the King, came to his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bellievre<HI>'s ne∣gotiations at</HI> London, <HI>and with the King afterwards at</HI> New-Castle.</NOTE> Majesty, after he had spent some time at <HI>London</HI> in all the Low appli∣cation to the Parliament that can be imagin'd, without any mention of <MILESTONE N="20"/> the King with any tenderness, as if his Interest were at all consider'd by the King his Master, and without any consultation with those of his Majesties party; who were then in <HI>London,</HI> and would have been very ready to have advised with him. But he chose rather to converse with the principal Leaders of the Presbyterian Party in the Parliament, and with the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners; from whose information he took all his Measures; and they assured him <Q>“that nothing could be done for the King, except he would give up the Church; extirpate Episcopacy; and grant all the Lands belonging to Cathedral Churches to such uses” as the Parliament should advise;</Q> so that, when he came to the King, <MILESTONE N="30"/> he press'd him very earnestly to that condescension.</P>
<P>BUT, besides the matter proposed, in which his Majesty was un∣moveable, he had no esteem of any thing the Embassadour said to him, having too late discover'd the little affection the Cardinal had for him, and which he had too much relied upon. For, as hath been already said, by his advice, and upon his undertaking and assurance that his Majesty should be well receiv'd in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, and that they would be firm to his Interest, his Majesty had ventur'd to put himself into their hands; and he was no sooner there, than all they with whom <HI>Montrevil</HI> had treat∣ed, disavow'd their undertaking what the King had been inform'd of; and <MILESTONE N="40"/> though the Envoy did avow, and justify, what he had inform'd the King, to the faces of the Persons who had given their Engagements, the Cardi∣nal chose rather to recal, and discountenance the Minister of that Crown, than to enter into any expostulation with the Parliament, or the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>THE Embassadour, by an Express, quickly inform'd the Cardinal that the King was too reserv'd in giving the Parliament satisfaction; and therefore wished, <Q>“that some body might be sent over, who was like to have so much credit with his Majesty as to perswade him to what was” necessary for his Service.</Q> Upon which, the Queen, who was never advised by those who either understood, or valued his true Interest, con∣sulted <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> William D'avenant <HI>sent from the Queen to the King to per∣swade him to give up the Church.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> with those about her; and sent S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William D'avenant,</HI> an honest Man, and a witty, but in all respects inferior to such a trust, with a Letter of credit to the King (who knew the Person well enough under
<PB N="25" REF="470"/>
another Character than was like to give him much credit in the Argu∣ment in which he was instructed) although her Majesty had likewise other ways declared her opinion to his Majesty, <Q>“that he should part” with the Church for his peace and security.</Q></P>
<P>SIR <HI>William D'avenant</HI> had, by the countenance of the <HI>French</HI> Em∣bassadour, easy admission to the King; who heard him patiently all he had to say, and answer'd him in that manner that made it evident he was not pleased with the advice. When he found his Majesty unsatisfied, and that he was not like to consent to what was so earnestly desired by them by whose advice he was sent, who undervalued all those scruples <MILESTONE N="10"/> of conscience which his Majesty himself was strongly possess'd with, he took upon himself the confidence to offer some reasons to the King to induce him to yield to what was proposed; and, among other things, said, <Q>“”it was the advice and opinion of all his Friends;</Q> his Majesty ask∣ing, <Q>“”what Friends? and he answering,</Q> <Q>“that it was the opinion of the” Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI></Q> the King said, <Q>“that the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> did not under∣stand” any thing of the Church.</Q> The other said, <Q>“the Lord <HI>Colepepper”</HI> was of the same mind.</Q> The King said, <HI>Colepepper</HI> had no Religion: and asked, <Q>“”whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer was of that mind?</Q> to which he answer'd, <Q>“he did not know; for that he was not there,” <MILESTONE N="20"/> and had deserted the Prince: and thereupon,</Q> said somewhat from the Queen of the displeasure she had conceiv'd against the Chancellor; to which the King said, <Q>“the Chancellor was an honest Man, and would never desert Him, nor the Prince, nor the Church; and that he was” sorry he was not with his Son;</Q> but that his Wife was mistaken. <HI>D'ave∣nant</HI> then offering some reasons of his own, in which he mention'd the Church slightingly, as if it were not of importance enough to weigh down the benefit that would attend the concession, his Majesty was transported with so much indignation, that he gave him a sharper re∣prehension than was usual for him to give to any other Man; and for∣bid <MILESTONE N="30"/> him to presume to come again into his presence. Whereupon the poor Man, who had in truth very good affections, was exceedingly de∣jected and afflicted; and return'd into <HI>France,</HI> to give an Account of his ill success to those who sent him.</P>
<P>AS all Men's expectations from the Courage and Activity of the <HI>French</HI> Embassadour in <HI>England,</HI> were thus frustrated, by his mean and low carriage both towards the Parliament and at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> so all the professions which had been made of respect and tenderness towards the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> when his Person should once appear in <HI>France,</HI> were as unworthily disappointed. The Prince had been above two Months <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince's treatment when He came into</HI> France</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"/> with the Queen his Mother, before any Notice was taken of his being in <HI>France,</HI> by the least Message sent from the Court to congratulate his arrival there; but that time was spent in debating the formalities of his reception; how the King should treat him? and how he should behave himself towards the King? whether he should take place of Monsieur the King's Brother? and what kind of Ceremonies should be observ'd between the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and his Uncle the Duke of <HI>Orleans?</HI> and many such other particulars; in all which they were resolv'd to give the Law themselves; and which had been fitter to have been adjusted in <HI>Jersy,</HI> before he put himself into their power, than disputed afterwards <MILESTONE N="50"/> in the Court of <HI>France;</HI> from which there could be then no Appeal.</P>
<P>THERE can be no doubt but that the Cardinal, who was the sole Minister of State, and directed all that was to be done, and dictated all
<PB N="26" REF="480"/>
that was to be said, did think the presence of the Prince there of the highest importance to their affairs; and did all that was in his power, to perswade the Queen that it was as necessary for the affairs of the King her Husband, and of her Majesty: but now that work was over, and the Person of the Prince brought into their power, without the least publick Act or Ceremony to invite him thither, it was no less his care that the Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> and the Officers of the Army, whom he fear'd more than the Parliament, should believe that the Prince came thither without their wish, and in truth against their will; that the Crown of <HI>France</HI> could not refuse to interpose, and mediate, to make <MILESTONE N="10"/> up the difference between the Parliament and the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, and that the Kingdoms might be restored to Peace; but that when they had perform'd that office of Mediation, they had perform'd their Function; and that they would no more presume to take upon them to judge be∣tween the Parliament and the <HI>Scots,</HI> than they had done between the King and the Parliament; and that since the Prince had come to the Queen his Mother, from which they could not reasonably restrain him, it should not be attended with any prejudice to the Peace of <HI>England;</HI> nor should he there find any means, or assistance, to disturb it. And it was believ'd by those who stood at no great distance from affairs, that <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Cardinal then laid the foundation for that friendship which was shortly after built up between him and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> by promising <Q>“that they should receive less inconvenience by the Prince's remaining in” <HI>France,</HI> than if he were in any other part of <HI>Europe.</HI></Q> And it can hard∣ly be believ'd, with how little respect they treated him during the whole time of his stay there. They were very careful that he might not be look'd upon as supported by them either according to his dignity, or for the maintenance of his Family; but a mean addition to the Pension which the Queen had before was made to her Majesty, without any mention of the Prince her Son; who was wholely to depend upon her <MILESTONE N="30"/> Bounty, without power to gratify and oblige any of his own Servants; that they likewise might depend only upon the Queen's goodness and favour, and so behave themselves accordingly.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Scots</HI> had secured the peace and quiet of their own Coun∣try, by disbanding the Forces under the Marquis of <HI>Montrose,</HI> and by his transporting himself beyond the Seas, and by putting to death se∣veral Persons of Name who had follow'd the Marquis, and had been taken Prisoners, among whom S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Spotswood</HI> was one, a worthy honest loyal Gentleman, and as wise a Man as that Nation had at that time (whom the King had made Secretary of State of that Kingdom, <MILESTONE N="40"/> in the place of the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> who was then in Armes against him; which, it may be, was a principal cause that the other was put to death) And when they had with such solemnity and resolution made it plain and evident, that they could not, without the most barefaced violation of their Faith and Allegiance, and of the fundamental princi∣ple of Christian Religion, ever deliver up their Native King, who had put himself into their hands, into the hands of the Parliament, against his own Will and Consent: <Q>And when the Earl of <HI>Lowden</HI> had publick∣ly declared to the two Houses of Parliament in a conference, “that an eternal infamy would lie upon them, and the whole Nation, if they <MILESTONE N="50"/> should deliver the Person of the King; the securing of which was equal∣ly their duty, as it was the Parliament's, and the disposal of his Person in order to that security did equally belong to Them as to the Parlia∣ment;”</Q>
<Q><PB N="27" REF="490"/>
however, they said, “they would use all the perswasion, and all the importunity they could with the King that his Majesty might yield,” and consent to the Propositions the Parliament had sent to him.</Q></P>
<P>THE Parliament had, upon the first notice of the King's being arriv'd in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, sent a positive Command to the Committee of both Kingdoms residing in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, that the Person of the King should be forthwith sent to <HI>Warwick</HI> Castle; but the <HI>Scots,</HI> who apprehended they could not be long without such an Order, had, within two days after his Majesties coming to them, and after he had caused <HI>Newark</HI> to be deliver'd up, with wonderful expedition marched towards <HI>New-Castle;</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> and were arriv'd there before they receiv'd that Order for send∣ing his Majesty to <HI>Warwick;</HI> which proceeding of theirs, pleased his Majesty very well, among many other things which displeased him; and perswaded him, that though they would observe their own method, they would, in the end, do somewhat for his Service.</P>
<P>UPON the receiving that Order, they renew'd their professions to the Parliament of observing punctually all that had been agreed between them; and besought them, <Q>“that since they had promised the King, before he left <HI>Oxford,</HI> to send Propositions to him, they would now do it; and said, that if he refused to comply with them, to which they” <MILESTONE N="20"/> should perswade him, they knew what they were to do.</Q> Then they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King, upon the</HI> Scots <HI>desire, sends Orders for the Surrender of</HI> Oxford, <HI>and all his other Garrisons.</HI></NOTE> advised the King, and prevailed with him, to send Orders to the Go∣vernour of <HI>Oxford</HI> to make conditions, and to surrender that place (where his Son the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was, and all the Council) into the hands of <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who with his Army then besieged them; and likewise to publish a general Order (which they caused to be printed) <Q>“that all Go∣vernours of any Garrisons for his Majesty, should immediately deliver them up to the Parliament upon fair and honourable Conditions, since his Majesty resolv'd in all things to be advised by his Parliament; and till this was done, they said, they could not declare themselves in that <MILESTONE N="30"/> manner for his Majesties Service, and Interest, as they resolv'd to do; for that they were, by their Treaty and Confederacy, to serve the Par∣liament in such manner as they should direct, until the War should be ended; but, that done, they had no more obligations to the Par∣liament; and that, when his Majesty had no more Forces on foot, nor Garrisons which held out for him, it could not be denied but that the War was at an end; and then they could speak and expostulate with” freedom.</Q> By which arts, they prevailed with the King to send, and publish such Orders as aforesaid; and which indeed, as the case then stood, he could have receiv'd little benefit by not publishing. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THE Parliament was contented, as the more expedite way (though <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment, upon the</HI> Scots <HI>re∣quest, sends Propositions of Peace to the King at</HI> New-Castle, <HI>about th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> end of</HI> July.</NOTE> they were much offended at the presumption of the <HI>Scots</HI> in neglecting to send the King to <HI>Warwick)</HI> to send their Propositions to the King (which they knew his Majesty would never grant) by Commissioners of both Houses, who had no other Authority, or power, than <Q>“to demand” a positive Answer from the King in ten days,</Q> and then to return. These Propositions were deliver'd about the end of <HI>July;</HI> and contain'd such an eradication of the Government of the Church and State, that the King told them, <Q>“he knew not what Answer to make to them, till <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesties Answer.</NOTE> he should be inform'd what Power or Authority they had left to him,” <MILESTONE N="50"/> and his Heirs,</Q> when he had given all that to them which they desired. <Q>He desired, “that he might be removed to some of his own Houses, and that he might reside there till, upon a Personal Treaty with his
<PB N="28" REF="500"/>
Parliament, such an agreement might be established as the Kingdom might enjoy peace and happiness under it; which, he was sure, it could” never do by the concessions they proposed.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots,</HI> who were enough convinced that his Majesty could ne∣ver be wrought upon to sacrifice the Church to their wild lusts and im∣piety, were as good as their words to the Parliament, and used all the rude importunity and Threats to his Majesty, to perswade him freely to consent to all: though they confessed <Q>“that the Propositions were higher in many things than they approv'd of, yet they saw no other means for him to close with his Parliament, than by granting what” <MILESTONE N="10"/> they required.</Q></P>
<P>THE Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> told him, <Q>“that the consequence of his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scots <HI>in∣force the Par∣liament Pro∣positions by their Chancel∣lor.</HI></NOTE> Answer to the Propositions, was as great, as the ruin, or preservation of his Crown or Kingdoms: That the Parliament after many bloody Battles, had got the strong-holds and Forts of the Kingdom into their hands: that they had his Revenue, Excise, Assessments, Sequestrations, and power to raise all the Men and Money of the Kingdom: that they had gained Victory over all, and that they had a strong Army to main∣tain it; so that they might do what they would with Church or State: that they desired neither Him, nor any of his race, longer to reign <MILESTONE N="20"/> over them; and had sent these Propositions to his Majesty, without the granting whereof, the Kingdom and his People could not be in safety: that if he refused to assent, he would lose all his Friends in Par∣liament, lose the City, and lose the Country; and that all <HI>England</HI> would joyn against him as one Man to process, and depose him, and to set up another Government; and so, that both Kingdoms, for ei∣thers safety, would agree to settle Religion and Peace without him,” to the ruin of his Majesty, and his Posterity:</Q> and concluded, <Q>“that if he left <HI>England,</HI> he would not be admitted to come and reign in” <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>AND it is very true that the General Assembly of the Kirk, which was then sitting in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had petition'd the Conservators of the Peace of the Kingdom, <Q>“that if the King should refuse to give satisfaction to” his Parliament,</Q> he might not be permitted to come into <HI>Scotland.</HI> This kind of Argumentation did more provoke than perswade the King; he told them, with great Resolution, and Magnanimity, <Q>“that no con∣dition <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesties Answer to them.</NOTE> they could reduce him to, could be half so miserable, and grievous to him, as that which they would perswade him to reduce himself to; and therefore, bid them proceed their own way; and” that though they had all forsaken him, God had not.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THE Parliament had now receiv'd the Answer they expected; and, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment require the</HI> Scots <HI>to quit the King∣dom, and to deliver up the Person of the King.</HI></NOTE> forthwith, required <Q>“the <HI>Scots</HI> to quit the Kingdom, and to deliver the Person of the King to such Persons as they should appoint to re∣ceive” him;</Q> who should attend upon his Majesty from <HI>New-Castle</HI> to <HI>Holmby,</HI> a House of his at a small distance from <HI>Northampton,</HI> a Town and Country of very eminent disaffection to the King throughout the War; and declared <Q>“that his Majesty should be treated, with respect to the safety and preservation of his Person, according to the Cove∣nant: And that after his coming to <HI>Holmby,</HI> he should be attended by such as they should appoint; and that when the <HI>Scots</HI> were removed <MILESTONE N="50"/> out of <HI>England,</HI> the Parliament would joyn with their Brethren of <HI>Scotland,</HI> again to perswade the King to pass the Propositions; which if he refused to do, the House would do nothing that might break
<PB N="29" REF="510"/>
the Union of the two Kingdoms, but would endeavour to preserve” the same.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> now begun again to talk sturdily, and denied <Q>“that the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> had power absolutely to dispose of the Person” of the King without their approbation;</Q> and the Parliament as loudly replied, <Q>“that they had nothing to do in <HI>England,</HI> but to observe their” Orders;</Q> and added such threats to their reasons, as might let them see they had a great contempt of their power, and would exact obedience from them, if they refused to yield it. But these discourses were only kept up till they could adjust all Accounts between them, and agree <MILESTONE N="10"/> what price they should pay for the delivery of His Person whom one side was resolv'd to have, and the other as resolv'd not to keep; and so <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scots <HI>agree to deli∣ver up the King.</HI></NOTE> they agreed; and, upon the payment of two hundred thousand pounds in hand, and security for as much more upon days agreed upon, the <HI>Scots</HI> deliver'd the King up into such hands as the Parliament appointed to receive him.</P>
<P>IN this infamous manner that excellent Prince was, in the end of <HI>January,</HI> given up, by his <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects, to those of his <HI>English</HI> who were intrusted by the Parliament to receive him; which had appointed a Committee of Lords and Commons, to go to the place agreed upon <MILESTONE N="20"/> with a Party of Horse and Foot of the Army, which were subject to the Orders of that Committee, and the Committee it self to go to <HI>New-Castle</HI> to receive that Town as well as the King; where, and to whom, his Majesty was deliver'd.</P>
<P>THEY receiv'd him with the same formality of respect as he had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commit∣tee appointed by the Parlia∣ment receive the King at</HI> New-Castle <HI>in the end of</HI> January.</NOTE> been treated with by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and with the same strictness restrain'd all resort of those to his Majesty, who were of doubtful affections to them, and their Cause. Servants were particularly appointed, and named by the Parliament, to attend upon his Person, and Service, in all rela∣tions; amongst which, in the first place, they prefer'd those who had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Servants ap∣pointed by the Parliament to attend his Majesty.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"/> faithfully adhered to them against their Master; and, where such were wanting, they found others who had manifested their affection to them. And, in this distribution, the Presbyterian Party in the Houses did what they pleased, and were thought to govern all. The Independents craftily letting them enjoy that confidence of their power and interest, till they had dismiss'd their Friends, the <HI>Scots,</HI> out of the Kingdom; and permitting them to put Men of their principles about the Person of the King, and to choose such a Guard as they could confide in, to attend his Majesty.</P>
<P>OF the Committee imploied to govern and direct all, Major General <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Brown</HI> was one, who had a great Name and Interest in the City, and with all the Presbyterian Party, and had done great Service to the Par∣liament in the War under the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and was a diligent and stout Commander. In this manner, and with this attendance, his Ma∣jesty was brought to his own House at <HI>Holmby</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire;</HI> a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King is brought to</HI> Holmby</NOTE> place he had taken much delight in: And there he was to stay till the Parliament and the Army (for the Army now took upon them to have a share, and to give their opinion in the settlement that should be made) should determine what should be farther done.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, the Committee paid all respects to his Majesty; <MILESTONE N="50"/> and he enjoyed those Exercises he most delighted in; and seem'd to have all liberty, but to confer with Persons he most desired, and to have such Servants about him as he could trust. That which most displeased him,
<PB N="30" REF="520"/>
was, that they would not permit him to have his own Chaplains; but order'd Presbyterian Ministers to attend for Divine Service: and his Majesty, utterly refusing to be present at their Devotions, was com∣pelled at those hours to be his own Chaplain in his Bed-Chamber; where he constantly used the Common Prayer by himself. His Majesty bore this constraint so heavily that he writ a Letter to the House of Peers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de∣sires certain of his Chaplains; is refused.</NOTE> in which he inclosed a List of the Names of thirteen of his Chaplains; any two of which he desired might have liberty to attend him for his Devotion. To which, after many days consideration, they return'd this Answer; <Q>“that all those Chaplains were disaffected to the establish'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> Government of the Church, and had not taken the Covenant; but that there were others who had, who, if his Majesty pleased, should be sent” to him.</Q> After this Answer, his Majesty thought it to no purpose to importune them farther in that particular; but, next to the having his own Chaplains, he would have been best pleased to have been without any; they who were sent by them, being Men of mean parts and of most impertinent and troublesome Confidence and Importunity.</P>
<P>WHILST those Disputes continued between the Parliament and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers Garri∣sons Surren∣der'd to the Parliament.</NOTE> <HI>Scots</HI> concerning the King's Person, the Army proceeded with great Suc∣cess in reducing those Garrisons which still continued in his Majesties <MILESTONE N="20"/> obedience; whereof though some surrender'd more easily and with less resistance than they might have made, satisfying themselves with the King's general Order, and that there was no reasonable expectation of relief, and therefore that it would not be amiss, by an early submission, to obtain better conditions for themselves; yet others defended them∣selves with notable obstinacy to the last, to the great damage of the Enemy, and to the detaining the Army from uniting together; with∣out which they could not pursue the great designs they had. And this was one of the reasons that made the Treaty with the <HI>Scots</HI> depend so long, and that the Presbyterians continued their Authority and Credit <MILESTONE N="30"/> so long; and We may observe again, that those Garrisons which were maintain'd, and defended with the greatest courage and virtue, in the end, obtain'd, as good and as honourable conditions, as any of those who surrender'd upon the first Summons.</P>
<P>THIS was the Case of <HI>Ragland</HI> and <HI>Pendennis</HI> Castles; which en∣dured the longest Sieges, and held out the last of any Forts or Castles in <HI>England;</HI> being bravely defended by two Persons of very great Age; but were at length deliver'd up within a day or two of each other. <HI>Ragland</HI> was maintain'd, with extraordinary Resolution and Courage, by the old Marquis of <HI>Worcester,</HI> against <HI>Fairfax</HI> himself, till it was <MILESTONE N="40"/> reduced to the utmost necessity. <HI>Pendennis</HI> refused all Summons; ad∣mitting no Treaty, till all their Provisions were so far consumed, that they had not Victual left for four and twenty hours; and then they treated, and carried themselves in the Treaty with such resolution, and unconcernedness, that the Enemy concluded they were in no streights; and so gave them the conditions they proposed; which were as good as any Garrison in <HI>England</HI> had accepted. This Castle was defended by the Governour thereof, <HI>John Arundel</HI> of <HI>Trerice</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> an old Gentleman of near fourscore years of age, and of one of the best Estates and Interest in that County; who, with the Assistance of his Son <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>Richard Arundel</HI> (who was then a Colonel in the Army; a stout and diligent Officer; and was by the King after his return made a Baron, Lord <HI>Arundel</HI> of <HI>Trerice,</HI> in memory of his Father's Service, and his

own eminent behaviour throughout the War) maintain'd, and defended the same to the last extremity.</P>
<P>THERE remain'd with him in that Service many Gentlemen of the Country of great Loyalty, amongst whom S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Killigrew</HI> was one; who, being an intimate Friend of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, re∣solv'd to go to <HI>Jersy;</HI> and, assoon as the Castle was Surrender'd, took the first opportunity of a Vessel then in the Harbour of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> to transport himself with some Officers and Soldiers to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Maloes</HI> in <HI>Bri∣tany;</HI> from whence he writ to the Chancellor in <HI>Jersy,</HI> that he would procure a Bark of that Island to go to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Maloes</HI> to fetch him thither; <MILESTONE N="10"/> which, by the kindness of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Carteret,</HI> was presently sent, with a longing desire to receive him into that Island; the two Lords, <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Hopton,</HI> and the Governour, having an extraordinary affection for him, as well as the Chancellor. Within two days after, upon view of the Vessel at Sea (which they well knew) they all made hast to the Har∣bour to receive their Friend; but, when they came thither, to their in∣finite regret they found his Body there in a Coffin, he having dyed at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Maloes</HI> within a day after he had written his Letter.</P>
<P>AFTER the Treaty was sign'd for delivering the Castle, he had walked out to discharge some Armes which were in his Chamber; among which, <MILESTONE N="20"/> a Carrabine that had been long charged, in the shooting off, broke; and a splinter of it struck him in the forehead; which, though it drew much blood, was not apprehended by him to be of any danger; so that his Friends could not perswade him to stay there till the wound was cured; but, the blood being stopp'd, and the Chirurgeon having bound it up, he prosecuted his intended Voyage; and at his landing at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Maloes,</HI> he writ that Letter; believing his wound would give him little trouble. But his Letter was no sooner gone than he sent for a Chirurgeon; who, opening the wound, found it was very deep and dangerous; and the next day he dyed, having desired that his dead Body might be sent to <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Jersy;</HI> where he was decently buried. He was a very Gallant Gentle∣man, of a noble Extraction, and a fair Revenue in Land; of excellent Parts and Courage; he had one only Son, who was killed before him in a Party that fell upon the Enemies Quarters near <HI>Bridgewater;</HI> where he behaved himself with remarkable Courage, and was generally la∣mented.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Harry</HI> was of the House of Commons; and though he had no other relation to the Court than the having many Friends there, as wherever he was known he was exceedingly belov'd, he was most zealous and passionate in opposing all the extravagant proceedings of the Par∣liament. <MILESTONE N="40"/> And when the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was chosen General, and the se∣veral Members of the House stood up, and declared, what Horse they would raise, and maintain, and that they would live and dye with the Earl their General, one saying he would raise ten Horses, and another twenty, He stood up and said, <Q>“he would provide a good Horse, and a good Buff Coat, and a good pair of Pistols, and then he doubted not” but he should find a good Cause;</Q> and so went out of the House, and rode Post into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> where his Estate and Interest lay; and there joyn'd with those Gallant Gentlemen his Friends, who first receiv'd the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and raised those Forces which did so many famous Actions <MILESTONE N="50"/> in the West.</P>
<P>HE would never take any Command in the Army; but they who had, consulted with no man more. He was in all actions, and in those
<PB N="32" REF="540"/>
places where was most danger, having great Courage and a pleasantness of humour in danger that was very exemplary; and they who did not do their duty, took care not to be within his view; for he was a very sharp Speaker, and cared not for angering those who deserv'd to be re∣prehended. The <HI>Arundels, Trelawnies, Slannings, Trevanions,</HI> and all the signal Men of that County, infinitely loved his Spirit, and since∣rity; and his Credit and Interest had a great influence upon all but those who did not love the King; and to those, he was very terrible; and exceedingly hated by them; and not loved by Men of moderate tem∣pers; for he thought all such prepared to Rebel, when a little success <MILESTONE N="10"/> should encourage them; and was many times too much offended with Men who wish'd well, and whose constitutions and complections would not permit them to express the same frankness, which his Nature and keenness of Spirit could not suppress. His loss was much lamented by all good Men.</P>
<P>FROM the time that the King was brought to <HI>Holmby,</HI> and whilst he stayed there, he was afflicted with the same pressures concerning the Church, which had disquieted him at <HI>New-Castle;</HI> the Parliament not remitting any of their insolencies in their demands: all which was im∣puted to the Presbyterians, who were thought to exercise the whole <MILESTONE N="20"/> power, and begun to give Orders for the lessening their great Charge by disbanding some Troops of their Army, and sending others for <HI>Ireland;</HI> which they made no doubt speedily to reduce; and declared, <Q>“that they would then disband all Armies, that the Kingdom might be govern'd” by the known Laws.</Q></P>
<P>THIS temper in the Houses raised another Spirit in the Army; which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences arise between the Parlia∣ment and the Army.</NOTE> did neither like the Presbyterian Government that they saw ready to be settled in the Church, nor that the Parliament should so absolutely dis∣pose of them, by whom they had gotten power to do all they had done; and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who had the sole influence upon the Army, under hand <MILESTONE N="30"/> made them Petition the Houses against any thing that was done con∣trary to his opinion. He himself, and his Officers, took upon them to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers Sects increase in the Army.</NOTE> Preach and Pray publickly to their Troops; and admitted few or no Chaplains in the Army, but such as bitterly inveighed against the Pres∣byterian Government, as more Tyrannical than Episcopacy; and the Common Soldiers, as well as the Officers, did not only Pray, and Preach among themselves, but went up into the Pulpits in all Churches, and Preached to the People; who quickly became inspired with the same Spirit; Women as well as Men taking upon them to Pray and Preach; which made as great a noise and confusion in all opinions concerning Re∣ligion, <MILESTONE N="40"/> as there was in the Civil Government of the State; scarce any Man being suffer'd to be called in question for delivering any opinion in Religion, by speaking or writing, how Prophane, Heretical, or Blas∣phemous soever it was; <Q>“”which, they said,</Q> <Q>“”was to restrain the Spirit.</Q></P>
<P>LIBERTY of Conscience was now the Common Argument and Quarrel, whilst the Presbyterian Party proceeded with equal bitterness against the several Sects as Enemies to all Godliness, as they had done, and still continued to do, against the Prelatical Party; and finding them∣selves superior in the two Houses, little doubted, by their Authority and Power there, to be able to reform the Army, and to new moddel it <MILESTONE N="50"/> again; which they would, no doubt, have attempted, if it had not pleased God to have taken away the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> some Months before <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Essex <HI>dyed in</HI> Sept. <HI>this year.</HI></NOTE> this; who dyed without being sensible of sickness, in a time when he
<PB N="33" REF="550"/>
might have been able to have undone much of the mischief he had for∣merly wrought; to which he had great inclinations; and had indigna∣tion enough for the indignities himself had receiv'd from the ungrateful Parliament, and wonderful apprehension, and detestation of the ruin he saw like to befall the King, and the Kingdom. And it is very probable, considering the present temper of the City at that time, and of the two Houses, he might, if he had lived, have given some check to the rage and fury that then prevailed. But God would not suffer a Man, who, out of the pride and vanity of his nature, rather than the wickedness of his heart, had been made an Instrument of so much mischief, to have <MILESTONE N="10"/> any share in so glorious a work; though his constitution, and temper, might very well incline him to the Lethargick indisposition of which he dyed, yet it was loudly said by many of his Friends, <Q>“that he was” Poyson'd.</Q></P>
<P>SURE it is that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Party (for he was now declared head of the Army, though <HI>Fairfax</HI> continued General in name) were wonderfully exalted with his death; he being the only Person whose Credit and Interest they fear'd without any esteem of his Person.</P>
<P>AND now, that they might more substantially enter into dispute, and competition with the Parliament, and go a share with them in <MILESTONE N="20"/> settling the Kingdom (as they called it) the Army erected a kind of Par∣liament among themselves. They had, from the time of the defeat of the King's Army, and when they had no more Enemy to contend with in the Field, and after they had purged their Army of all those incon∣venient Officers, of whose entire submission, and obedience to all their dictates, they had not confidence, set aside, in effect, their self denying Ordinance, and got their principal Officers of the Army, and others of their Friends, whose principles they well knew, to be elected Members of the House of Commons into their places who were dead, or who had been expell'd by them for adhering to the King. By this means, <HI>Fair∣fax</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> himself, <HI>Ireton, Harrison,</HI> and many other of the Independents, Officers and Gentlemen, of the several Counties, who were transported with new fancies in Religion, and were called by a new name <HI>Fanaticks,</HI> sate in the House of Commons; notwithstanding all which, the Presby∣terians still carried it.</P>
<P>BUT about this time, that they might be upon a nearer Level with the Parliament, the Army made choice of a number of such Officers as they liked; which they called the General's Council of Officers; who were to resemble the House of Peers; and the Common Soldiers made choice of three or four of each Regiment, most Corporals or Serjeants, few or none above the degree of an Ensign, who were called Agitators, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Agitators, as well as a Coun∣cil of Officers, appointed by the Army.</NOTE> and were to be as a House of Commons to the Council of Officers. These two Representatives met severally, and consider'd of all the Acts and Orders made by the Parliament towards settling the Kingdom, and towards reforming, dividing, or disbanding of the Army: and, upon mutual Messages and Conferences between each other, they resolv'd in the first place, and declared, <Q>“that they would not be divided, or dis∣banded, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their first Re∣solutions.</NOTE> before their full Arrears were paid, and before full Provision was made for Liberty of Conscience; which, they said, was the ground of the Quarrel, and for which so many of their Friends lives had been <MILESTONE N="50"/> lost, and so much of their own Blood had been spilt; and that hi∣therto there was so little security provided in that point, that there was a greater persecution now against Religious and Godly Men, than
<PB N="34" REF="560"/>
ever had been in the King's Government, when the Bishops were their” Judges.</Q></P>
<P>THEY said, <Q>“they did not look upon themselves as a Band of <HI>Jani∣zaries,</HI> hired and entertained only to Fight their Battles; but that they had voluntarily taken up Armes for the Liberty and Defence of the Nation of which they were a part; and before they laid down those Armes, they would see all those ends well provided for, that the People might not hereafter undergo those grievances which they had formerly suffer'd. They complain'd that some Members of the Army had been sent for by the Parliament, and committed to Prison, which <MILESTONE N="10"/> was against their Privilege; since all Soldiers ought to be tryed by a Council of War, and not by any other Judicatory; and therefore they desired redress in these, and many other particulars of as ingrateful a Nature; and that such as were Imprison'd and in Custody, might be forthwith set at Liberty; without which they could not think them∣selves” justly dealt with: and with this Declaration and Address,</Q> they sent three or four of their own Members to the House of Commons; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which they de∣liver'd to the Parliament:</NOTE> who deliver'd it at the Bar with wonderful Confidence.</P>
<P>THE Soldiers publish'd a vindication, as they call'd it, of their Pro∣ceedings and Resolutions, and directed it to their General; in which <MILESTONE N="20"/> they complain'd of a design to disband, and new model the Army; <Q>“”which, they said,</Q> <Q>“was a Plot contriv'd by some Men who had lately tasted of Soveraignty; and, being lifted up above the ordinary Sphere of Servants, endeavour'd to become Masters, and were degenerated” into Tyrants.</Q> They therefore declared, <Q>“that they would neither be imployed for the Service of <HI>Ireland,</HI> nor suffer themselves to be dis∣banded, till their desires were granted, and the Rights and Liberties” of the Subjects should be vindicated,</Q> and maintain'd. This Apology, or Vindication, being sign'd by many inferior Officers, the Parliament declared them to be Enemies to the State; and caused some of them, <MILESTONE N="30"/> who talked loudest, to be imprison'd. Upon which a new Address was <NOTE PLACE="marg">And to their General.</NOTE> made to their General; wherein they complain'd <Q>“how disdainfully they were used by the Parliament, for whom they had ventured their Lives, and lost their Blood: that the Privileges which were due to them as Soldiers, and as Subjects, were taken from them; and when they com∣plain'd of the Injuries they receiv'd, they were abused, beaten, and” dragg'd into Goals.</Q></P>
<P>HEREUPON, the General was prevailed with to write a Letter to a Member of Parliament, who shew'd it to the House; in which he took notice of several Petitions, which were prepared in the City of <HI>London,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> and some other Counties of the Kingdom, against the Army; and <Q>“that it was look'd upon as very strange, that the Officers of the Army might not be permitted to petition, when so many Petitions were re∣ceiv'd against them; and that he much doubted that the Army might draw to a Rendezvous, and think of some other way for their own” vindication.</Q></P>
<P>THIS manner of proceeding by the Soldiers, but especially the Ge∣neral seeming to be of their mind, troubled the Parliament; yet they resolv'd not to suffer their Counsels to be censured, or their Actions controled, by those who were retained by them, and who lived upon <MILESTONE N="50"/> their pay. And therefore, after many high Expressions against the pre∣sumption of several Officers and Soldiers, they declared, <Q>“that who∣soever <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment's Decla∣ration there∣upon.</NOTE> should refuse, being commanded, to engage himself in the”
<PB N="35" REF="570"/>
Service of <HI>Ireland,</HI> should be disbanded.</Q> The Army was resolv'd not to be subdued in their first so declared Resolution, and fell into a direct and high Mutiny, and called for the Arrears of pay due to them; which they knew where and how to Levy for themselves; nor could they be in any degree appeased, till the Declaration that the Parliament had made against them, was rased out of the Journal Book of both Houses, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Afterward rased out of their Books.</NOTE> and a Months pay sent to them; <Q>nor were they satisfied with all this, but talked very loud, “that they knew how to make themselves as con∣siderable as the Parliament, and where to have their Service better va∣lued,” and rewarded;</Q> which so frighted those at <HI>Westminster,</HI> that <MILESTONE N="10"/> they appointed a Committee of Lords and Commons, whereof some <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee appointed by the two Houses to treat with a Committee of the Army.</NOTE> were very acceptable to the Army, to go to them, and to treat with a Committee chosen of the Officers of the Army, upon the best expe∣dients that might be applied to the composing these distempers. Now the Army thought it self upon a Level with the Parliament, when they had a Committee of the one authorised to treat with a Committee of the other; which likewise raised the Spirits of <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who had never thought of opposing or disobeying the Parliament; and disposed him to more concurrence with the impetuous humour of the Army, when he saw it was so much complied with and submitted to by all Men. <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>CROMWELL, hitherto, carried himself with that rare dissimulation <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell<HI>'s behaviour at first in these Mutinies.</HI></NOTE> (in which sure he was a very great Master) that he seem'd exceedingly incensed against this Insolence of the Soldiers; was still in the House of Commons when any such addresses were made; and inveighed bitterly against the presumption, and had been the Cause of the Commitment, of some of the Officers. He proposed, <Q>“that the General might be sent” down to the Army;</Q> who, he said, <Q>“would conjure down this mu∣tinous” Spirit quickly;</Q> and he was so easily believ'd, that he himself was sent once or twice to compose the Army; where after he had stayed two or three days, <Q>he would again return to the House, and complain <MILESTONE N="30"/> heavily “of the great Licence that was got into the Army; that, for his own part, by the Artifice of his Enemies, and of those who desired that the Nation should be again imbrew'd in Blood, he was render'd so odious unto them, that they had a purpose to kill him, if, upon” some discovery made to him, he had not escaped out of their hands.</Q> And in these, and the like discourses, when he spake of the Nation's be∣ing to be involv'd in new troubles, he would weep bitterly, and appear the most afflicted Man in the world with the sense of the Calamities which were like to ensue. But, as many of the wiser sort had long dis∣cover'd his wicked intentions, so his hipocrisy could not longer be con∣cealed. <MILESTONE N="40"/> The most active Officers and Agitators were known to be his own Creatures, and such who neither did, nor would do, any thing but by his direction. So that it was privately resolv'd by the principal Per∣sons of the House of Commons, that when he came the next day into the House, which he seldom omitted to do, they would send him to the Tower; presuming, that if they had once sever'd his Person from the Army, they should easily reduce it to its former temper and obe∣dience. For they had not the least jealousy of the General <HI>Fairsax,</HI> whom they knew to be a perfect Presbyterian in his judgement; and that <HI>Crom∣well</HI> had the ascendent over him purely by his dissimulation, and pretence <MILESTONE N="50"/> of conscience and sincerity. There is no doubt <HI>Fairsax</HI> did not then, nor long after, believe, that the other had those wicked designs in his heart against the King, or the least imagination of disobeying the Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="580"/>
THIS purpose of seising upon the Person of <HI>Cromwell</HI> could not be carried so secretly, but that he had notice of it; and the very next morn∣ing after he had so much lamented his desperate misfortune in having lost all reputation, and credit, and authority in the Army, and that his life would be in danger if he were with it, when the House expected every minute his presence, they were inform'd that he was met out of the Town by break of day, with one Servant only, on the way to the Army; where he had appointed a Rendezvous of some Regiments of the Horse, and from whence he writ a Letter to the House of Com∣mons, <Q>“that having the night before receiv'd a Letter from some Of∣ficers <MILESTONE N="10"/> of his own Regiment, that the jealousy the Troops had conceiv'd of him, and of his want of kindness towards them, was much abated, so that they believ'd, if he would be quickly present with them, they would all in a short time by his advice be reclaim'd, upon this he had made all the hast he could; and did find that the Soldiers had been abused by misinformation; and that he hoped to discover the fountain from whence it sprung; and in the mean time desired that the General, and the other Officers in the House, and such as remain'd about the Town, might be presently sent to their Quarters; and that he believ'd it would be very necessary in order to the suppression of the late distem∣pers, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and for the prevention of the like for the time to come, that there might be a general Rendezvous of the Army; of which the Ge∣neral would best consider, when he came down; which he wished” might be hasten'd.</Q> It was now to no purpose to discover what they had formerly intended, or that they had any jealousy of a Person who was out of their reach; and so they expected a better conjuncture; and in few days after, the General and the other Officers left the Town, and went to their Quarters.</P>
<P>THE same morning that <HI>Cromwell</HI> left <HI>London,</HI> Cornet <HI>Joyce,</HI> who <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cornet</HI> Joyce <HI>seised upon the King at</HI> Holmby June 3. 1647.</NOTE> was one of the Agitators in the Army, a Taylor, a fellow who had two <MILESTONE N="30"/> or three years before serv'd in a very inferior imployment in M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hollis</HI>'s House, came with a Squadron of fifty Horse to <HI>Holmby,</HI> where the King was, about the break of day; and, without any interruption by the Guard of Horse or Foot which waited there, came with two or three more, and knock'd at the King's Chamber door, and said <Q>“he must pre∣sently” speak with the King.</Q> His Majesty, surprised with the manner of it, rose out of his bed; and, half dress'd, caused the door to be open'd, which he knew otherwise would be quickly broken open; they who waited in the Chamber being Persons of whom he had little knowledge, and less confidence. Assoon as the door was open'd, <HI>Joyce,</HI> and two or <MILESTONE N="40"/> three more, came into the Chamber, with their Hats off, and Pistols in their Hands. <HI>Joyce</HI> told the King, <Q>“”that he must go with him.</Q> His Majesty asked, <Q>“”whither?</Q> he answer'd, <Q>“”to the Army.</Q> The King asked him, <Q>“”where the Army was?</Q> he said, <Q>“they would carry him to the” Place where it was.</Q> His Majesty asked, <Q>“by what Authority they” came?</Q> <HI>Joyce</HI> answer'd, <Q>“”by this; and shew'd him his Pistol;</Q> and de∣sired his Majesty, <Q>“that he would cause himself to be dress'd, because” it was necessary they should make hast.</Q> None of the other Soldiers spoke a word; and <HI>Joyce,</HI> saving the bluntness, and positiveness of the few words he spoke, behaved himself not rudely. The King said, <Q>“he <MILESTONE N="50"/> could not stir before he spoke with the Committee to whom he had” been deliver'd,</Q> and who were trusted by the Parliament; and so ap∣pointed one of those who waited upon him, to call them. The Committee
<PB N="37" REF="590"/>
had been as much surprised with the noise as the King had been, and quickly came to his Chamber, and asked <HI>Joyce,</HI> <Q>“whether he had any” Orders from the Parliament?</Q> he said, <HI>No.</HI> <Q>“From the General? <HI>No.”</HI> What Authority he came by?</Q> to which he made no other Answer, than he had made to the King, and held up his Pistol. <Q>They said, “they would write to the Parliament to know their pleasure; <HI>Joyce</HI> said,” they might do so, but the King must presently go with him.</Q> Colonel <HI>Brown</HI> had sent for some of the Troops who were appointed for the King's Guard, but they came not; he spoke then with the Officer who Commanded those who were at that time upon the Guard, and found <MILESTONE N="10"/> that they would make no resistance: so that after the King had made all the delays he conveniently could, without giving them cause to be∣lieve that he was resolv'd not to have gone, which had been to no pur∣pose, and after he had broken his fast, he went into his Coach, attended by the few Servants who were put about him, and went whither Cornet <HI>Joyce</HI> would conduct him; there being no part of the Army known to be within twenty miles of <HI>Holmby</HI> at that time; and that which admi∣nister'd most cause of apprehension, was, that those Officers who were of the Guard, declared <Q>“that the Squadron which was Commanded by <HI>Joyce,</HI> consisted not of Soldiers of any one Regiment, but were Men <MILESTONE N="20"/> of several Troops, and several Regiments, drawn together under him,” who was not the proper Officer;</Q> so that the King did in truth believe, that their purpose was to carry him to some place where they might more conveniently murther him. The Committee quickly gave notice <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commit∣tee give notice of it.</NOTE> to the Parliament of what had passed, with all the circumstances; and it was receiv'd with all imaginable consternation; nor could any Body imagin what the purpose and resolution was.</P>
<P>NOR were they at the more ease, or in any degree pleased with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The General's Account of it to the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> Account they receiv'd from the General himself; who, by his Letter, inform'd them, <Q>“that the Soldiers at <HI>Holmby</HI> had brought the King <MILESTONE N="30"/> from thence; and that his Majesty lay the next Night at Colonel <HI>Mon∣tague</HI>'s House, and would be the next day at <HI>Newmarket:</HI> that the Ground thereof was from an Apprehension of some strength gather'd to force the King from thence; whereupon he had sent Colonel <HI>Wha∣ley</HI>'s” Regiment to meet the King.</Q> <Q>He protested “that his remove was without his consent, or of the Officers about him, or of the Body of the Army, and without their desire, or privity: that he would take” care for the security of his Majesties Person from danger;</Q> and assured the Parliament, <Q>“that the whole Army endeavour'd Peace, and were far from opposing Presbytery, or affecting Independency, or from any <MILESTONE N="40"/> purpose to maintain a licentious freedom in Religion, or the Interest of any particular Party, but were resolv'd to leave the absolute deter∣mination” of all to the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>IT was upon the third of <HI>June</HI> that the King was taken from <HI>Holmby</HI> by Cornet <HI>Joyce,</HI> well nigh a full year after he had deliver'd himself to the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Newark;</HI> in all which time, the Army had been at leisure to contrive allways to free it self from the servitude of the Parliament, whilst the Presbyterians believ'd, that in spight of a few factious Inde∣pendent Officers, it was entirely at their Devotion, and could never prove disobedient to their Commands; and those few wise Men, who <MILESTONE N="50"/> discern'd the foul designs of those Officers, and by what degrees they stole the Hearts and Affections of the Soldiers, had not credit enough to be believ'd by their own Party. The joynt confidence of the unanimous
<PB N="38" REF="600"/>
Affection of the City of <HI>London</HI> to all their purposes, made them despise all opposition; but now, when they saw the King taken out of their hands in this manner, and with these circumstances, they found all their Measures broke by which they had form'd all their Counsels. And as this Letter from the General administer'd too much cause of jealousy of what was to succeed, so a positive information about the same time by many Officers, confirm'd by a Letter which the Lord Mayor of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> had receiv'd, that the whole Army was upon its march, and would be in <HI>London</HI> the next day by noon, so distracted them that they ap∣pear'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Distractions at</HI> Westmin∣ster <HI>upon no∣tice of the Ar∣mies coming towards</HI> Lon∣don.</NOTE> besides themselves: <Q>however, they Voted, “that the Houses <MILESTONE N="10"/> should sit all the next day, being <HI>Sunday;</HI> and that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marshall</HI> should be there to pray for them: That the Committee of safety should sit up all that night to consider what was to be done: That the Lines of Communication should be strongly guarded, and all the Train'd-bands” of <HI>London</HI> should be drawn together upon pain of death.</Q> All Shops were shut up, and such a General confusion over all the Town, and in the faces of all Men, as if the Army had already enter'd the Town. <Q>The Parliament writ a Letter to the General, desiring him, “that no part of the Army might come within five and twenty miles of <HI>London;</HI> and that the King's Person might be deliver'd to the former Commis∣sioners, <MILESTONE N="20"/> who had attended upon his Majesty at <HI>Holmby;</HI> and that Co∣lonel <HI>Rossiter,</HI> and his Regiment, might be appointed for the Guard” of his Person.</Q> <Q>The General return'd for Answer, “that the Army was come to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Albans</HI> before the desire of the Parliament came to his hands; but that, in obedience to their Commands, he would advance no farther; and desired that a Month's pay might presently be sent for” the Army.</Q> In which they defer'd not to gratify them; though as to the redelivery of the King to the former Commissioners, no other An∣swer was return'd, than <Q>“that they might rest assured, that all care should” be taken for his Majesties security.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>FROM that time both <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton</HI> appear'd in the Council of Officers, which they had never before done; and their Expostula∣tions with the Parliament, begun to be more brisk, and contumacious than they had been. The King found himself at <HI>Newmarket</HI> attended <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King brought to</HI> Newmarket; <HI>where He was allowed his Chaplains by the Army.</HI></NOTE> by greater Troops and superior Officers; so that he was presently freed from any Subjection to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Joyce;</HI> which was no small satisfaction to him; and they who were about him appear'd Men of better breeding than the former, and paid his Majesty all the respect imaginable, and seem'd to desire to please him in all things. All restraint was taken off from Persons resorting to him, and he saw every day the Faces of many <MILESTONE N="40"/> who were grateful to him; and he no sooner desired that some of his Chaplains might have leave to attend upon him for his Devotion, but it was yielded to, and they who were named by him (who were D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Shel∣don,</HI> D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Morley,</HI> D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sanderson,</HI> and D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hammond)</HI> were presently sent, and gave their attendance and perform'd their Function at the ordinary hours, in their accustom'd formalities; all Persons who had a mind to it, being suffer'd to be present, to his Majesties infinite satisfaction; who begun to believe that the Army was not so much his Enemy as it was reported to be; and the Army had sent an Address to him full of Pro∣testation of duty, and besought him <Q>“that he would be content, for <MILESTONE N="50"/> some time, to reside among them, until the affairs of the Kingdom were put into such a Posture as he might find all things to his own content, and security; which they infinitely desired to see assoon as”
<PB N="39" REF="610"/>
might be; and to that purpose made daily instances to the Parliament.</Q> In the mean time his Majesty sate still, or removed to such places as <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty removes ac∣cording to the marches of the Army.</NOTE> were most convenient for the March of the Army; being in all places as well provided for and accommodated, as he had used to be in any Pro∣gress; the best Gentlemen of the several Counties through which he passed, daily resorted to him, without distinction; he was attended by some of his old Trusty Servants in the places nearest his Person; and that which gave him most encouragement to believe that they meant well, was, that in the Armies Address to the Parliament, they desired <Q>“that care might be taken for settling the King's Rights, according to <MILESTONE N="10"/> the several Professions they had made in their Declarations; and that” the Royal Party might be treated with more candour, and less rigour;</Q> and many good Officers who had serv'd his Majesty faithfully, were ci∣villy receiv'd by the Officers of the Army, and liv'd quietly in their Quarters; which they could not do any where else; which raised a great reputation to the Army, throughout the Kingdom, and as much re∣proach upon the Parliament.</P>
<P>THE Parliament at this time had recover'd its Spirit, when they saw the Army did not march nearer towards them, and not only stopp'd at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Albans,</HI> but was drawn back to a farther distance; which perswaded <MILESTONE N="20"/> them, that their General was displeased with the former advance: and so they proceeded with all passion, and vigour, against those principal Officers, who, they knew, contrived all these Proceedings. They pub∣lished Declarations to the Kingdom, <Q>“that they desired to bring the King in honour to his Parliament; which was their business from their beginning, and that he was detain'd Prisoner against his Will in the Army; and that they had great reason to apprehend the safety of his” Person.</Q> The Army, on the other hand, declared <Q>“that his Majesty was neither Prisoner, nor detain'd against his Will; and appeal'd to his Majesty himself, and to all his Friends, who had liberty to repair to <MILESTONE N="30"/> him, whether he had not more liberty, and was not treated with more respect, since he came into the Army than he had been at <HI>Holmby,</HI> or during the time he remain'd in those places, and with that retinue that” the Parliament had appointed?</Q> The City seem'd very unanimously de∣voted <NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions in the City upon those oc∣casions.</NOTE> to the Parliament, and incensed against the Army; and seem'd resolute, not only with their Train'd-bands and Auxiliary Regiments to assist, and defend the Parliament, but appointed some of the old Officers who had serv'd under the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and had been disbanded under the new Model, as <HI>Waller, Massey,</HI> and others, to list new Forces; towards which there was not like to be want of Men out of their old <MILESTONE N="40"/> Forces, and such of the King's as would be glad of the imployment. There was nothing they did really fear so much, as that the Army would make a firm conjunction with the King, and unite with his Party, of which there was so much shew; and many unskilful Men, who wished it, bragg'd too much; and therefore the Parliament sent a Committee to his Majesty, with an Address of another Style than they had lately used, with many professions of Duty; and declaring, <Q>“that if he was not, in all respects, treated as he ought to be, and as he desired, it was not Their fault, who desired he might be at full liberty, and do” what he would;</Q> hoping that the King would have been induced to <MILESTONE N="50"/> desire to come to <HI>London,</HI> and to make complaint of the Armies having taken him from <HI>Holmby;</HI> by which they believ'd the King's Party would be disabused, and withdraw their hopes of any good from
<PB N="40" REF="620"/>
the Army; and then, they thought, they should be hard enough for them.</P>
<P>THE King was in great doubt how to carry himself; he thought him∣self so barbarously used by the Presbyterians, and had so ill an opinion of all the principal Persons who govern'd them, that he had no mind to put himself into their hands. On the other side, he was far from being satisfied with the Armies good intentions towards him; and though many of his Friends were suffer'd to resort to him, they found that their being long about him, would not be acceptable; and though the Of∣ficers and Soldiers appear'd, for the most part, civil to him, they were all at least as vigilant, as the former Guards had been; so that he could <MILESTONE N="10"/> not, without great difficulty, have got from them if he had desired it. <HI>Fairfax</HI> had been with him, and kiss'd his hand, and made such Pro∣fessions as he could well utter; which was with no advantage in the de∣livery; his Authority was of no use, because he resign'd himself entirely to <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who had been, and <HI>Ireton</HI> likewise, with the King, with∣out either of them offering to kiss his hand; otherwise, they behaved themselves with good manners towards him. His Majesty used all the Address he could towards them to draw some promise from them, but they were so reserv'd, and stood so much upon their Guard, and used so few words, that nothing could be concluded from what they said: <MILESTONE N="20"/> they excused themselves <Q>“for not seeing his Majesty often, upon the great jealousies the Parliament had of them, towards whom they pro∣fess'd” all fidelity.</Q> The Persons who resorted to his Majesty, and brought Advices from others who durst not yet offer to come themselves, brought several opinions to him; some thinking the Army would deal sincerely with his Majesty, others expecting no better from them than they afterwards perform'd: so that the King well concluded that he would neither reject the Parliament Addresses by any neglect, nor dis∣oblige the Army by appearing to have jealousy of them, or a desire to be out of their hands; which he could hardly have effected, if he had <MILESTONE N="30"/> known a better place to have resorted to. <Q>So he desired both Parties “to hasten their Consultations, that the Kingdom might enjoy Peace and Happiness; in which he should not be without a share; and he” would pray to God to bring this to pass assoon as was possible.</Q></P>
<P>THE News of the King's being in the Army, of his freedom in the exercise of his Religion, which he had been so long without, and that some of his Servants, with whom he was well pleased had liberty to at∣tend upon him, made every Body abroad, as well as those at home, hope well; and the King himself writ to the Queen, as if he thought his condition much better than it had been among the <HI>Scots.</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Berkley</HI> after his surrender of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and the spending his six Months allowed by the Articles to sollicite his affairs where he would, had trans∣ported himself into <HI>France,</HI> and waited upon the Queen at <HI>Paris,</HI> being still a menial Servant to her Majesty, and having a Friend in that Court that govern'd, and loved him better than any Body else did. Assoon as the reports came thither of the King's being with the Army, he repeated many discourses he had held with the Officers of the Army, whilst they treated with him of the delivery of <HI>Exeter;</HI> <Q>how he had told them, “upon how slippery ground they stood; that the Parliament, when they had served their turn, would dismiss them with reproach, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> give them very small rewards for the great Service they had done for them; that they should do well, seasonably to think of a safe retreat,
<PB N="41" REF="630"/>
which could be no where but under the Protection of the King; who by their Courage was brought very low; and if they raised him again, he must owe it all to them; and his Posterity, as well as himself, and all his Party, must for ever acknowledge it; by which they would raise their fortunes, as well as their fame, to the greatest degree Men could” aime at;</Q> which, he said, made such an impression upon this and that Officer, whom he named, <Q>“that they told him at parting, that they should never forget what he had said to them; and that they already observ'd that every day produced somewhat that would put them in” mind of it.</Q> In a word, <Q>“he had foretold all that was since come to <MILESTONE N="10"/> pass, and he was most confident, that, if he were now with them, he should be welcome, and have credit enough to bring them to reason,” and to do the King great Service;</Q> and offer'd, without any delay, to make the Journey. The Queen believ'd all he said; and they who did not, were very willing he should make the experiment; for he that lov'd him best, was very willing to be without him; and so receiving <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John Berk∣ley <HI>sent from the Queen to the King.</HI></NOTE> the Queen's Letter of recommendation of him to the King, who knew him very little, and that little not without some prejudice, he left <HI>Paris,</HI> and made all possible hast into <HI>England. John Ashburnham,</HI> who was driven from the King by the <HI>Scots</HI> after he had conducted his Majesty <MILESTONE N="20"/> to them, had transported himself into <HI>France,</HI> and was at this time re∣siding in <HI>Roan;</HI> having found, upon his Address to the Queen at <HI>Paris</HI> upon his first arrival, that his abode in some other place would not be ungrateful to her Majesty, and so he removed to <HI>Roan;</HI> where he had the society of many who had serv'd the King in the most eminent qua∣lifications. When he heard where the King was, and that there was not <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Ashburn∣ham <HI>comes from</HI> France <HI>to the King.</HI></NOTE> the same restraint that had been formerly, he resolv'd to make an ad∣venture to wait on him; having no reason to doubt but that his pre∣sence would be very acceptable to the King; and though the other En∣voy from <HI>Paris,</HI> and He, did not make their Journey into <HI>England</HI> to∣gether, <MILESTONE N="30"/> nor had the least communication with each other, being in truth of several Parties and Purposes, yet they arriv'd there, and at the Army, near the same time.</P>
<P>BERKLEY first applied himself to those subordinate Officers with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John Berk∣ley <HI>and M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Ashburn∣ham<HI>'s Trans∣actions with some Officers of the Army.</HI></NOTE> whom he had some acquaintance at <HI>Exeter,</HI> and they informing their Superiors of his arrival, and application, they were well pleased that he was come. They were well acquainted with his Talent, and knew his soible, that, by flattering and commending, they might govern him; and that there was no danger of any deep design from His contrivance; and so they permitted him freely to attend the King, about whose Per∣son <MILESTONE N="40"/> he had no title, or relation, which required any constant waiting upon him.</P>
<P>ASHBURNHAM had, by some Friends, a recommendation both to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> who knew the credit he had with the King, and that his Majesty would be very well pleased to have his attendance, and look upon it as a Testimony of their respect to him. They knew like∣wise that he was an implacable Enemy to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and no Friend to the other Presbyterians, and though he had some ordinary craft in in∣sinuating, he was of no deep and piercing judgement to discover what was not unwarily exposed, and a free speaker of what he imagined: so <MILESTONE N="50"/> they likewise left Him at liberty to repair to the King; and these two Gentlemen came near about the same time to his Majesty, when the Army was drawing together, with a purpose, which was not yet publish'd,
<PB N="42" REF="640"/>
of marching to <HI>London;</HI> his Majesty being still quarter'd in those places which were more proper for that purpose.</P>
<P>THEY were both welcome to his Majesty, the one bringing a special recommendation from the Queen, and, to make himself the more va∣luable, assuring his Majesty <Q>“that he was sent for by the Officers of the Army, as one they would trust, and that they had receiv'd him with open Armes; and, without any scruple, gave him leave to wait upon” him: The other, needed no recommendation,</Q> the King's own incli∣nations disposing him to be very gracious to him; and so his Majesty wish'd them <Q>“to correspond with each other, and to converse with his <MILESTONE N="10"/> several Friends, who did not yet think fit to resort to him; and to receive their advice; to discover as much as they could of the Inten∣tions of both Parties, and impart what was fit to the King, till, upon” a farther discovery, his Majesty might better judge what to do.</Q> These two were the principal Agents (they conferring with all his Majesties Friends, and, as often as they desired, with the Officers of the Army) upon whose Information, and Advice, his Majesty principally depended, though they rarely conferr'd together with the same Persons, and never with any of the Officers, who pretended not to trust one another enough to speak with that freedom before each other, as they would to one of <MILESTONE N="20"/> them; and their Acquaintance among the Officers not being principally with the same Men, their Informations and advices were often very different, and more perplexed than informed his Majesty.</P>
<P>THE very high contests between the Parliament and the Army, in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The different designs of the Parliament and Army at this time re∣lating to the King.</NOTE> which neither side could be perswaded to yield to the other, or abate any of their asperity, made many prudent Men believe that both sides would, in the end, be willing to make the King the Umpire; which neither of them ever intended to do. The Parliament thought that their Name and Authority, which had carried them through so great under∣takings, and reduced the whole Kingdom to their obedience, could not <MILESTONE N="30"/> be overpower'd by their own Army, raised and paid by themselves, and to whose Dictates the People would never submit. They thought the King's presence amongst them, gave them all their present reputa∣tion; and were not without apprehension that the Ambition of some of the Officers, and their malice to the Parliament, when they saw that they could obtain their ends no other way, might dispose them to an entire conjunction with the King's Party and Interest; and then, all the Penalties of Treason, Rebellion, and Trespasses, must be discharged at their costs; and therefore they labour'd, by all the publick and private means they could, to perswade the King to own his being detain'd Pri∣soner <MILESTONE N="40"/> by the Army against his Will, or to withdraw himself by some way from them, and repair to <HI>White-Hall;</HI> and, in either of those Cases, they did not doubt, first, to divide the Army (for they still believ'd the General fast to them) and by degrees to bring them to reason, and to be disbanded, as many as were not necessary for the Service of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and then, having the King to themselves, and all his Party being ob∣noxious to those penalties for their Delinquency, they should be well able, by gratifying some of the greatest Persons of the Nobility with immunity and indemnity, to settle the Government in such a manner, as to be well recompenced for all the Adventures they had made, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> hazards they had run.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the Army had no dread of the Authority and Power of the Parliament; which they knew had been so far prostituted,
<PB N="43" REF="650"/>
that it had lost most of its reverence with the People. But it had great apprehension, that, by its conjunction with the City, it might indeed recover credit with the Kingdom, and withhold the pay of the Army, and thereby make some Division amongst them; and if the Person of the King should be likewise with them, and thereby his Party should likewise joyn with them, they should be to begin their work again, or to make their Peace with those who were as much provoked by them as the King himself had been. And therefore they were sensible that they enjoyed a present benefit by the King's being with them, and by their treating him with the outward respect that was due to his Majesty, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> the civilities they made profession of towards all his Party, and the per∣mission of his Chaplains, and other Servants, to resort to him; and cul∣tivated all these Artifices with great Address, suppressing, or discoun∣tenancing the Tyranny of the Presbyterians in the Country Committees, and all other places, where they exercised notable rigour against all who had been of the King's Party, or not enough of theirs (for Neuters found no excuse for being of no Party) When they found it fit to make any lusty Declaration against the Parliament, and exclaim against their Ty∣rannical proceedings against the Army, they allways inserted somewhat that might look like candour and tenderness towards the King's Party, <MILESTONE N="20"/> complain'd of <Q>“the Affront, and Indignity done to the Army by the Parliament's not observing the Articles which had been made upon surrender of Garrisons, but proceeding against those on whose behalf those Articles were made, with more severity than was agreeable to justice, and to the Intention of the Articles; whereby the honour and faith of the Army suffer'd, and was complain'd of; all which, they” said, they would have remedied.</Q> Whereupon many hoped that they should be excused from making any compositions, and entertain'd such other imaginations as pleased themselves, and the other Party well liked; knowing they could demolish all those Structures assoon as they receiv'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> no benefit by them themselves.</P>
<P>THE King had, during the time he stayed at <HI>Holmby,</HI> writ to the House of Peers, that his Children might have leave to come to him, and to reside for some time with him. From the time that <HI>Oxford</HI> had been surrender'd, upon which the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had fallen into their hands, for they would by no means admit that he should have liberty to go to such place as the King should direct, which was very earnestly pressed, and insisted on by the Lords of the Council there, as long as they could; but appointed their Committee to receive him with all respect, and to bring him to <HI>London;</HI> from that time, I say, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was <MILESTONE N="40"/> committed to the care of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> together with the Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and the Princess, who had been by the King left under the tuition of the Countess of <HI>Dorset,</HI> but from the Death of that Countess the Parliament had presumed, that they might be sure to keep them in their power, to put them into the Custody of the Lady <HI>Vere,</HI> an old Lady much in their favour, but not at all ambitious of that charge, though there was a competent allowance assign'd for their support. They were now removed from her, and placed all together with the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who receiv'd, and treated them, in all respects, as was suitable to their Birth, and his own Duty; but could <MILESTONE N="50"/> give them no more liberty to go abroad, than he was, in his Instructions from the Parliament, permitted to do; and they had absolutely refused to gratify the King in that particular; of which his Majesty no sooner
<PB N="44" REF="660"/>
took notice to <HI>Fairfax,</HI> than he writ a Letter to the Parliament, <Q>“that the King much desired to have the fight and company of his Children; and that if they might not be allow'd to be longer with him, that at” least they might dine with him;</Q> and he sent them word that, on such a day, <Q>“the King, who attended the motion of the Army and was quar∣ter'd” only where they pleased, would dine at <HI>Maidenhead.</HI></Q> There his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King al∣low'd to see his Children at</HI> Maiden∣head <HI>and</HI> Caversham.</NOTE> Children met him, to his infinite content and joy; and he being to quarter and stay some time at <HI>Caversham,</HI> a House of the Lord <HI>Craven</HI>'s, near <HI>Reading,</HI> his Children were likewise suffer'd to go thither, and re∣main'd with him two days; which was the greatest satisfaction the King <MILESTONE N="10"/> could receive; and the receiving whereof, he imputed to the civility of the General, and the good disposition of the Army; which made so much the more impression upon him, in that he had never made any one Proposition in which he had been gratified, where the Presbyterian Spirit had power do deny it.</P>
<P>IN the House of Commons, which was now the Scene of all the Action that displeased and incensed the Army (for the House of Peers was shrunk into so inconsiderable a Number, and their Persons not con∣siderable after the death of the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> except those who were affected to, or might be disposed by the Army) they were wholely <MILESTONE N="20"/> guided by <HI>Hollis,</HI> and <HI>Stapleton, Lewis,</HI> and <HI>Glyn,</HI> who had been very popular and notorious from the beginning, and by <HI>Waller,</HI> and <HI>Massey,</HI> and <HI>Brown,</HI> who had serv'd in Commands in the Army, and perform'd at some times very signal Service, and were exceedingly belov'd in the City, and two or three others who follow'd their Dictates, and were subservient to their Directions. These were all Men of Parts, Interest, and signal Courage, and did not only heartily abhor the Intentions which they discern'd the Army to have, and that it was wholely to be disposed according to the designs of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> but had likewise declared animo∣sities against the Persons of the most active and powerful Officers; as <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Hollis</HI> had one day, upon a very hot debate in the House, and some rude expressions which fell from <HI>Ireton,</HI> perswaded him to walk out of the House with him, and then told him, <Q>“that he should presently go” over the Water and fight with him.</Q> <HI>Ireton</HI> replying, <Q>“his conscience” would not suffer him to fight a Duel: <HI>Hollis,</HI> in choler, pulled him by the Nose;</Q> telling him, <Q>“if his conscience would keep him from giving” Men satisfaction, it should keep him from provoking them.</Q> This af∣front to the third Person of the Army, and to a Man of the most viru∣lent, malitious, and revengeful Nature of all the Pack, so incensed the whole Party, that they were resolv'd one way or other to be rid of him <MILESTONE N="40"/> who had that power in the House, and that reputation abroad, that when he could not absolutely controle their designs, he did so obstruct them, that they could not advance to any conclusion.</P>
<P>THEY resorted therefore to an expedient, which, they had observ'd, by the conduct of those very Men against whom they meant to apply it, had brought to pass all that they desired; and, in the Council of Of∣ficers, prepared an impeachment of High Treason in general Terms <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army im∣peach eleven Members of the House of Commons</NOTE> against M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hollis,</HI> and the Persons mention'd before, and others, to the number of eleven Members of the House of Commons. This impeach∣ment twelve Officers of the Army, Colonels, Lieutenant Colonels <MILESTONE N="50"/> Majors, and Captains, presented to the House; and within few days af∣ter, when they saw the same Members still inveigh against and arraign their proceedings, the General and Officers writ a Letter to the House,
<Q><PB N="45" REF="670"/>
“that they would appoint fit Persons on their and the Kingdom's be∣half, to make good the charge against those Members whom they had accused; and that they desired, that those Members impeach'd might be forthwith suspended from sitting in the House; since it could not be thought fit that the same Persons who had so much injured and pro∣voked” the Army, should sit Judges of their own Actions.</Q> This was an Arrow that the House of Commons did not expect would have been shot out of that Quiver; and though they were unspeakably dismayed, and distracted with this presumption, they answer'd positively, <Q>“that they neither would, nor could, sequester those Members from the <MILESTONE N="10"/> House, who had never said, or done any thing in the House worthy of Censure, till proof were made of such particulars as might render” them guilty.</Q> <Q>But the Officers of the Army replied, “that they could prove them guilty of such practices in the House, that it would be just in the House to suspend them: that by the Laws of the Land, and the Precedents of Parliament, the Lords had, upon the very presen∣tation of a general Accusation without being reduced in form, se∣quester'd from their House and committed the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> and therefore they must press, and insist upon the suspending at least of those accused Members from be∣ing <MILESTONE N="20"/> present in the House, where they stood impeach'd; and without” this, they said, the Army would not be satisfied.</Q> However the House of Commons seem'd still resolute, the accused Members themselves, who best knew their temper, thought it safer for them to retire, and by forbearing to appear in the House, to allay the heat of the present Contest.</P>
<P>UPON this so palpable Declension of Spirit in the House, the Army seem'd much quieter, and resolv'd to set other Agents on their work, that they might not appear too busy and active in their own concern∣ment. It is very true that the City, upon whose influence the Parlia∣ment <MILESTONE N="30"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temper of the City and the Changes of their Militia at this time.</NOTE> much depended, appear'd now entirely Presbyterian; the Court of Aldermen, and Common Council, consisted chiefly of Men of that spirit; the Militia of the City was committed to Commissioners care∣fully and factiously chosen of that Party; all those of another temper having been put out of Those Trusts, at or about the time that the King was deliver'd up by the <HI>Scots,</HI> when the Officers of the Army were con∣tent that the Presbyterians should believe, that the whole power of the Kingdom was in them; and that they might settle what Government they pleased: If there remain'd any Persons in any of those imploy∣ments in the City, it was by their dissimulation, and pretending to have <MILESTONE N="40"/> other Affections; most of those who were notorious to be of any other faction in Religion, had been put out; and liv'd as neglected and dis∣countenanced Men; who seem'd rather to depend upon the clemency, and indulgence of the State, for their particular liberty in the exercise of that Religion they adhered to, than to have any hope or ambition to be again admitted into any share, or part in the Government: yet, af∣ter all this dissimulation, <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton</HI> well knew, that the mul∣titude of inferior People were at their disposal, and would appear in any conjuncture they should think convenient; and that many Aldermen and substantial Citizens were quiet, and appear'd not to contradict or <MILESTONE N="50"/> oppose the Presbyterians, only by their directions; and would be ready upon their call. And now, when they saw those leading Men, who had govern'd the Parliament, prosecuted by the Army, and that they forbore
<PB N="46" REF="680"/>
to come to the House, there flocked together great Numbers of the lowest, and most inferior People, to the Parliament, with Petitions of several Natures, both with reference to Religion, and to the Civil Go∣vernment; with the noise and clamour whereof, the Parliament was so offended and disturbed, that they made an Ordinance, <Q>“that it should be criminal to gather, and sollicite the Subscriptions of hands to Pe∣titions.”</Q> But this Order so offended all Parties, that they were com∣pelled, within two days, to revoke it, and to leave all Men to their na∣tural Liberty. Whilst this confusion was in the City and Parliament, the Commissioners, which had been sent to the Army to treat with the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Officers, had no better success; but return'd with the positive and de∣clared Resolution of the Army, <Q>“that a Declaration should be publish'd” by the Parliament against the coming in of Forreign Force: for they apprehended,</Q> or rather were willing that the People should apprehend, a new combination by the <HI>Scots:</HI> <Q>“that the Pay of the Army should be put into a constant Course, and all Persons who had receiv'd Money, should be called to an account: that the Militia of <HI>London</HI> should be put into the hands of Persons well affected, and those who had been formerly trusted: that all Persons imprison'd for pretended Misde∣meanours, by Order of Parliament, or their Committees, might be <MILESTONE N="20"/> set at Liberty; and, if upon tryal they should be found innocent, that” they might have good reparation.</Q> And they particularly mention'd <HI>John Lilburn, Overton,</HI> and other Anabaptists and Fanaticks, who had been committed by the Parliament for many seditious meetings, un∣der pretence of Exercise of their Religion, and many insolent Actions against the Government. Upon the report of these demands, the Par∣liament grew more enraged; and voted, <Q>“that the yielding to the Ar∣my in these particulars, would be against their Honour, and their In∣terest,” and destructive to their Privileges;</Q> with many expressions against their presumption, and insolence: yet, when a new Rabble of <MILESTONE N="30"/> Petitioners demanded, with loud Cries, most of the same things, they were willing to compound with them; and consented that the Militia of the City of <HI>London</HI> should be put into such hands as the Army should desire.</P>
<P>THE Militia of the City had been in the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> shortly after the King's being brought to <HI>Holmby,</HI> settled with the consent, and upon the desire, of the Common Council, by Ordinance of Parliament, in the hands of Commissioners, who were generally of the Presbyterian Party, they who were of other inclinations being removed; and, as is said before, seem'd not displeased at their disgrace; and now, when <MILESTONE N="40"/> upon the Declarations and Demands of the Army, seconded by cla∣morous Petitions, they saw this Ordinance reversed, in <HI>July,</HI> without so much as consulting with the Common Council according to custome, the City was exceedingly startled; and said, <Q>“that if the imperious Com∣mand of the Army, could prevail with the Parliament to reverse such an Ordinance as that of the Militia, they had reason to apprehend they might as well repeal the other Ordinances for the security of Money, or for the purchase of Bishops and Church Lands, or whatsoever else” that was the proper security of the Subject.</Q> And therefore they caused a Petition to be prepared in the name of the City, to be presented <MILESTONE N="50"/> by the two Sheriffs, and others deputed by the Common Council to that purpose. But, before they were ready, many thousands, Apprentices and young Citizens, brought Petitions to the Parliament; in which
<PB N="47" REF="690"/>
they said, <Q>“that the Command of the Militia of the City was the Birth∣right of the City, and belonged to them by several Charters which had been confirm'd in Parliament; for defence whereof, they said, they had ventur'd their Lives as far and as frankly as the Army had done; and therefore, they desired that the Ordinance of Parliament of the fourth of <HI>May,</HI> which had passed with their consent, might stand in∣violable.”</Q> They first presented their Petition to the House of Peers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A tumultuous Petition of A prentices, and others, to both Houses concerning their Militia.</NOTE> who immediately revoked their late Ordinance of <HI>July,</HI> and confirm'd their former of <HI>May;</HI> and sent it down to the Commons for their con∣sent; who durst not deny their concurrence, the Apprentices behaving <MILESTONE N="10"/> themselves so insolently, that they would scarce suffer the door of the House of Commons to be shut; and some of them went into the House.</P>
<P>AND in this manner the Ordinance was reversed that had been made at the desire of the Army, and the other of <HI>May</HI> ratified and confirm'd; which was no sooner done than the Parliament adjourn'd till <HI>Friday,</HI> that they might have two or three days to consider how they should behave themselves, and prevent the like violences hereafter. The Ar∣my had quickly notice of these extraordinary proceedings, and the Ge∣neral writ a very sharp Letter to the Parliament from <HI>Bedford;</HI> in which he put them in mind, <Q>“how civilly the Army had complied with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon this the General writ a very sharp Letter to the Parliament.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"/> their desire, by removing to a greater distance, upon presumption that their own Authority would have been able to have secured them from any rudeness, and violence of the People; which it was now evi∣dent it could not do, by the unparallel'd violation of all their Privi∣leges, on the <HI>Monday</HI> before, by a Multitude from the City, which had been encouraged by several Common Council Men, and other Citizens in Authority; which was an Act so prodigious and horrid as must dissolve all Government, if not severely and exemplarily chastised: that the Army looked upon themselves as accountable to the King∣dom, if this unheard of outrage, by which the Peace and settlement <MILESTONE N="30"/> of the Nation, and the relief of <HI>Ireland,</HI> had been so notoriously in∣terrupted, should not be strictly examined, and justice speedily done” upon the Offenders.</Q> Upon <HI>Friday,</HI> to which both Houses had adjourn'd, the Members came together, in as full Numbers as they had used to meet, there being above one hundred and forty of the House of Com∣mons; but, after they had sate sometime in expectation of their Speaker, they were inform'd that he was gone out of the Town early that morn∣ing; and they observ'd that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> and some few other Mem∣bers <NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Speakers, with other Mem∣bers of the two Houses, withdrew to the Army</NOTE> who used to concur with him, were likewise absent. The House of Peers found likewise that the Earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> their Speaker, had <MILESTONE N="40"/> withdrawn himself, together with the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and some other Lords; but the Major part still remain'd there, full of In∣dignation against those who were absent, and who they all concluded were gone to the Army. Hereupon both Houses chose new Speakers; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Houses chose new Speakers; and their Votes.</NOTE> who accepted the Office; and the Commons presently voted, <Q>“that the eleven Members who stood impeach'd by the Army, and had discon∣tinued coming to the House, should presently appear, and take their” places.</Q> They made an Ordinance of Parliament, by which a Com∣mittee of safety was appointed to joyn with the City Militia, and had Authority to raise Men for the defence of the Parliament; which they <MILESTONE N="50"/> appear'd so vigorously resolv'd on, that no Man in the Houses, or in the City, seem'd to intend any thing else. The News of this roused up the Army, and the General presently sent a good Party of Horse into
<PB N="48" REF="700"/>
<HI>Windsor,</HI> and marched himself to <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> and appointed a general Rendezvous for the whole Army upon <HI>Hounslow</HI> Heath, within two days; when and where there appear'd twenty thousand Foot and Horse, with a Train of Artillery, and all other provisions proportionable to such an Army.</P>
<P>ASSOON as the Rendezvous was appointed at <HI>Hounslow</HI> Heath, at <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rendezvous of the Army ap∣pointed on</HI> Hounslow <HI>Heath, and the King re∣moved to</HI> Hampton <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> the same time the King removed to <HI>Hampron</HI> Court; which was pre∣pared, and put into as good order for his reception, as could have been done in the best time. The Houses seem'd for some time to retain their Spirit and Vigour, and the City talked of listing Men, and defending <MILESTONE N="10"/> themselves, and not suffering the Army to approach nearer to them; but, when they knew the day of the Rendezvous, those in both Houses who had been too weak to carry any thing, and so had look'd on whilst such Votes were passed as they liked not and could not oppose, now when their Friend the Army was so near, recover'd their Spirits, and talked very loud; and perswaded the rest, <Q>“to think in time of making” their peace with the Army, that could not be withstood.</Q> And the City grew every day more appalled, irresolute, and confounded, one Man proposing this, and another somewhat contrary to that, like Men amazed and distracted. When the Army met upon <HI>Hounslow</HI> Heath at <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Both Speakers, and the other Members, ap∣pear in the Army on</HI> Hounslow <HI>Heath.</HI></NOTE> their Rendezvous, the Speakers of both Houses, who had privately be∣fore met with the Chief Officers of the Army, appear'd there with their Maces, and such other Members as accompanied them; complaining to the General, <Q>“that they had not freedom at <HI>Westminster,</HI> but were” in danger of their lives by the Tumults;</Q> and appealed to the Army for their protection.</P>
<P>THIS looked like a new Act of Providence to vindicate the Army from all reproaches, and to justify them in all they had done, as abso∣lutely done for the preservation of the Parliament and Kingdom. If this had been a retreat of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane</HI> and some other discontented <MILESTONE N="30"/> Men, who were known to be Independents, and Fanaticks in their opi∣nions in Religion, and of the Army faction, who being no longer able to oppose the wisdom of the Parliament, had fled to their Friends for protection from Justice, they would have got no reputation, nor the Army been thought the better of for their Company; but neither of the Speakers were ever look'd upon as inclined to the Army; <HI>Lenthall</HI> was generally believ'd to have no malice towards the King, and not to be without good inclinations to the Church; and the Earl of <HI>Man∣chester,</HI> who was Speaker of the House of Peers, was known to have all the prejudice imaginable against <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and had formerly ac∣cused <MILESTONE N="40"/> him of want of Duty to the Parliament; and the other hated him above all Men, and desired to have taken away his life. The Earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> were the two Pillars of the Pres∣byterian Party; and that they two, with the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and some other of the Lords, and some of the Commons, who had ap∣pear'd to disapprove all the proceedings of the Army, should now joyn with S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> and appeal to the Army for protection, with that formality as if they had brought the whole Parliament with them, and had been entirely driven and forced away by the City, appear'd to every stander by so stupendious a thing, that it is not to this day understood <MILESTONE N="50"/> otherwise, than that they were resolv'd to have their particular shares in the Treaty, which they believ'd the Chief Officers of the Army to have near concluded with the King. For that they never intended to
<PB N="49" REF="710"/>
put the whole power into the hands of the Army, nor had any kind∣ness to, or confidence in the Officers thereof, was very apparent by their carriage and behaviour after, as well as before; and if they had continued together, considering how much the City was devoted to them, it is probable that the Army would not have used any force; which might have receiv'd a fatal repulse; but that some good Compro∣mise might have been made by the Interposition of the King. But this Schisme carried all the Reputation and Authority to the Army, and left none in the Parliament; for though it presently appear'd, that the Number of those who left the Houses was small in comparison of those <MILESTONE N="10"/> who remain'd behind, and who proceeded with the same Vigour in de∣claring against the Army, and the City seem'd as resolute in putting themselves into a posture, and preparing for their defence, all their works and fortifications being still entire, so that they might have put the Army to great trouble if they had steadily pursued their Resolu∣tions (which they did not yet seem in any degree to decline) yet this rent made all the accused Members, who were the Men of parts, and reputation to conduct their Counsels, to withdraw themselves upon the astonishment; some concealing themselves, till they had opportunity to make their Peace, and others withdrawing and transporting them∣selves <MILESTONE N="20"/> beyond the Seas; whereof <HI>Stapleton</HI> died at <HI>Calais</HI> assoon as he landed, and was denied burial, upon imagination that he had died of the Plague: others remain'd a long time beyond the Seas; and, though they long after return'd, never were receiv'd into any trust in those times, nor in truth concurr'd, or acted in the publick Affairs, but re∣tired to their own Estates, and liv'd very privately.</P>
<P>THE Chief Officers of the Army receiv'd the two Speakers, and the Members who accompanied them, as so many Angels sent from Heaven for their Good; paid them all the respect imaginable, and prosessed all submission to them, as to the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> and declared <Q>“that <MILESTONE N="30"/> they would reestablish them in their full power, or perish in the at∣tempt;”</Q> took very particular care for their accommodations, before the General; and assign'd a Guard to wait upon them for their security; acquainted them with all their consultations, and would not presume to resolve any thing without their approbation: and they had too much modesty to think they could do amiss, who had prosper'd so much in all their undertakings. No time was lost in pursuing their Resolution to establish the Parliament again at <HI>Westminster;</HI> and finding that the rest of the Members continued still to sit there with the same formality, and that the City did not abate any of their Spirit, they seem'd to make a <MILESTONE N="40"/> halt, and to remain quiet, in expectation of a better understanding be∣tween them, upon the Messages they every day sent to the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen, and Common Council (for of those at <HI>Westminster</HI> they took no notice) and Quarter'd their Army about <HI>Brentford,</HI> and <HI>Houn∣slow, Twittenham,</HI> and the adjacent Villages, without restraining any Provisions, which every day according to custom were carried to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> or doing the least Action that might disoblige, or displease the City; the Army being in truth under so excellent discipline, that no body could complain of any damage sustain'd by them, or any provo∣cation by word or deed. However, in this calm, they sent over Colonel <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>Rainsborough</HI> with a Brigade of Horse and Foot, and Cannon, at <HI>Ham∣pton</HI> Court, to possess <HI>Southwark,</HI> and those works which secured that end of <HI>London</HI> Bridge; which he did with so little Noise, that in one
<PB N="50" REF="720"/>
nights march, he found himself Master without any opposition, not only of the Borough of <HI>Southwark,</HI> but of all the Works and Forts which were to defend it; the Soldiers within, shaking hands with those with∣out, and refusing to obey their Officers which were to command them: So that the City, without knowing that any such thing was in agitation, found in the morning that all that Avenue to the Town was possessed by the Enemy; whom they were providing to resist on the other side, being as confident of this that they had lost, as of any Gate of the City.</P>
<P>THIS struck them dead; and put an end to all their Consultation for <MILESTONE N="10"/> defence; and put other thoughts into their heads, how they might pa∣cify those whom they had so much offended, and provoked; and how they might preserve their City from Plunder, and the fury of an en∣raged Army. They who had ever been of the Army party, and of late had shut themselves up, and not dared to walk the Streets for fear of the People, came now confidently amongst them, and mingled in their Councils; declared, <Q>“that the King and the Army were now agreed in all particulars, and that both Houses were now with the Army, and had presented themselves to the King; so that to oppose the Army would be to oppose the King and Parliament, and to incense them as” <MILESTONE N="20"/> much as the Army.</Q> Upon such confident discourses and insinuations from those with whom they would not have conversed, or given the least credit to, three days before, or rather upon the confusion and ge∣neral distraction they were in, they sent six Aldermen and six Com∣moners <NOTE PLACE="marg">The City sends six Aldermen to the General, and submits.</NOTE> to the General; who lamented, and complain'd, <Q>“that the City should be suspected, that had never acted any thing against the Par∣liament; and therefore, they desired him to forbear doing any thing” that might be the occasion of a new War.</Q> But the General little con∣sider'd this Message, and gave less countenance to the Messengers; but continued his slow marches towards the City: whereupon they sent an <MILESTONE N="30"/> humble Message to him, <Q>“that since they understood that the reason of his march so near <HI>London</HI> was to restore, and settle the Members (the Lords and Commons) of Parliament to the Liberty and Privilege of sitting securely in their several Houses (to which the City would contribute all their power, and service) they prayed him, with all sub∣mission, that he would be pleased to send such a Guard of Horse and Foot as he thought to be sufficient for that purpose; and that the Ports and all Passages should be open to them; and they should do any” thing else that his Excellency would Command.</Q> To which, he made no other Answer but <Q>“that he would have all the Forts of the West <MILESTONE N="40"/> side of the City to be deliver'd immediately to him; those of the other side being already, as is said, in the hands of <HI>Rainsborough</HI> and his” other Officers.</Q> The Common Council, that sate day and night, upon the receipt of this Message, without any pause return'd <Q>“that they would humbly submit to his Command; and that now, under Al∣mighty God, they did rely only upon his Excellencies honourable word” for their protection, and security.</Q> And so they caused their Militia to be forthwith drawn off from the Line, as well as out of the Forts, with all their Cannon and Ordnance; and the General appointed a bet∣ter Guard to both. At <HI>Hyde</HI> Park the Mayor and Aldermen met him, <MILESTONE N="50"/> and humbly congratulated his arrival; and besought him <Q>“to excuse what they had, out of their good meaning and desire of Peace, done” amiss;</Q> and as a Testimony of their Affection and Duty, the Mayor,
<PB N="51" REF="730"/>
on the behalf of the City, presented a great gold Cup to the General; which he sullenly refused to receive, and, with very little ceremony, dismissed them.</P>
<P>HE himself waited upon the two Speakers, and conducted them, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The General conducts the two Speakers and other Members to their several Houses of Parliament.</NOTE> their Members, to the several Houses, where the other Members were then sitting: even in the Instant when the Revolters, as they had called them, enter'd into the Houses, the old Speakers assumed their places again, and enter'd upon their business, as if there had been no separa∣tion. The first thing they did, was calling in the General into both Houses, and making him a large acknowledgement in the name of each <MILESTONE N="10"/> House, of the great favours he had done to them: they thanked him for the Protection he had given to their Persons, and his Vindication of the Privileges of Parliament. <Q>Then they voted “all that had been done by themselves in going to the Army, and in residing there, and” all that had been done by the Army, to be well and lawfully done;</Q> as, some time after, they also voted, <Q>“that all that had been done in the Houses since their departure, was against Law, and Privilege of” Parliament, invalid and void: Then they adjourn'd to the next day, without questioning or punishing any Member who had acted there.</Q></P>
<P>THE Army of Horse, Foot, and Cannon, marched the next day <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army marches thro' the City, and Quarters about it.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"/> through the City (which, upon the desire of the Parliament, undertook forthwith to supply an hundred thousand pounds for the payment of the Army) without the least disorder, or doing the least damage to any Person, or giving any disrespective word to any Man; by which they attained the reputation of being in excellent Discipline, and that both Officers and Soldiers were Men of extraordinary temper and sobriety. So they marched over <HI>London</HI> Bridge into <HI>Southwark,</HI> and to those Quarters to which they were assign'd; some Regiments were Quarter'd in <HI>Westminster,</HI> the <HI>Strand,</HI> and <HI>Holborn,</HI> under pretence of being a Guard to the Parliament, but intended as a Guard upon the City. The <MILESTONE N="30"/> General's head Quarters were at <HI>Chelsey,</HI> and the rest of the Army Quar∣ter'd between <HI>Hampton</HI> Court and <HI>London,</HI> that the King might be well look'd to; and the Council of Officers, and Agitators, sate constantly, and formally, at <HI>Fulham,</HI> and <HI>Putney,</HI> to provide that no other settle∣ment should be made for the Government of the Kingdom than what they should well approve.</P>
<P>WHILST these things were thus agitated between the Army, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King at</HI> Hampton <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> the Parliament, and the City, the King enjoyed himself at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, much more to his content than he had of late; the respects of the Chief Officers of the Army seeming much greater than they had <MILESTONE N="40"/> been; <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself came oftner to him, and had longer conferences with him; talked with more openness to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham</HI> than he had done, and appear'd more chearful. Persons of all conditions repaired to his Majesty of those who had serv'd him; with whom he conferr'd with∣out reservation; and the Citizens flocked thither as they had used to do at the end of a Progress, when the King had been some Months ab∣sent from <HI>London:</HI> but that which pleased his Majesty most, was, that his Children were permitted to come to him, in whom he took great delight. They were all at the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s House, at <HI>Sion,</HI> from the time the King came to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and had liberty to <MILESTONE N="50"/> attend his Majesty when he pleased; so that sometimes he sent for them to come to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and sometimes he went to them to <HI>Sion;</HI> which gave him great satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="740"/>
IN this conversation, as if his Majesty had foreseen all that befel him <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's discourse and conversation with his Chil∣dren that were in the Parliament's power.</NOTE> afterwards, and which at that time sure he did not suspect, he took great care to instruct his Children how to behave themselves if the worst should befal him that the worst of his Enemies did contrive, or wish; and <Q>“that they should preserve unshaken their Affection and Duty to” the Prince their Brother.</Q> The Duke of <HI>York</HI> was then about fourteen years of Age; and so, capable of any information or instruction the King thought fit to give him. <Q>His Majesty told him, “that he looked upon himself as in the hands and disposal of the Army, and that the Parliament had no more power to do him good or harm, than as the Army should direct or permit; and that he knew not, in all this time <MILESTONE N="10"/> he had been with them, what he might promise himself from those Officers of the Army at whose devotion it was: that he hoped well, yet with much doubt and fear; and therefore he gave him this general direction, and command, that if there appear'd any such alteration in the affection of the Army, that they restrain'd him from the liberty he then enjoyed of seeing his Children, or suffer'd not his Friends to re∣sort to him with that freedom that they enjoyed at present, he might conclude they would shortly use him worse, and that he should not be long out of a Prison; and therefore that from the time he disco∣ver'd such an alteration, he should bethink himself how he might make” <MILESTONE N="20"/> an escape out of their power, and transport himself beyond the Seas.</Q> The place he recommended to him, was <HI>Holland;</HI> where he presumed his Sister would receive him very kindly, and that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> her Husband would be well pleased with it, though, possibly, the States might restrain him from making those Expressions of his Affection his own inclination prompted him to. He wished him to think allways of this, as a thing possible to fall out, and so spake frequently to him of it, and of the circumstances and cautions which were necessary to at∣tend it. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE Princess <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was not above a year or two younger than the Duke, a Lady of excellent parts, great observation, and an early understanding; which the King discern'd, by the Account she gave him both of Things and Persons, upon the experience she had had of both. <Q>His Majesty enjoyn'd her, “upon the worst that could befal him, never to be disposed of in Marriage without the consent and approbation of the Queen her Mother, and the Prince her Brother; and allways to perform all Duty and Obedience to both those; and to obey the Queen in all things, except in matter of Religion; in which he commanded her, upon his Blessing, never to hearken or consent to her; but to continue firm in the Religion she had been instructed and educated in, <MILESTONE N="40"/> what discountenance and ruin soever might befal the poor Church, at” that time under so severe prosecution.</Q></P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Gloucester</HI> was very young, being at that time not above seven years old, and so might well be thought incapable of re∣taining that advice, and injunction, which in truth ever after made so deep impression in him. <Q>After he had given him all the advice he thought convenient in the matter of Religion, and commanded him, positively, “never to be perswaded or threaten'd out of the Religion of the Church, in which he hoped he would be well instructed, and for the purity <MILESTONE N="50"/> and integrity whereof he bid him remember that he had his Father's” Testimony, and Authority;</Q> his Majesty told him, <Q>“that his infancy, and the tenderness of his years, might perswade some Men to hope
<PB N="53" REF="750"/>
and believe, that he might be made an Instrument, and Property, to advance their wicked designs; and if they should take away his life, they might, possibly, the better to attain their own ends make him King; that under him, whilst his Age would not permit him to Judge, and Act for himself, they might remove many obstructions which lay in their way; and form and unite their Councils; and then they would destroy Him too. But he commanded him, upon his Blessing, never to forget what he said to him upon this occasion, nor to accept, or suffer himself to be made King, whilst either of his elder Brothers liv'd, in what part of the world soever they should be: that he should <MILESTONE N="10"/> remember that the Prince his Brother was to succeed him by the Laws of God and Man; and, if he should miscarry, that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was to succeed in the same Right; and therefore that he should be sure never to be made use of to interrupt, or disturb either of their Rights;” which would in the end turn to his own destruction.</Q> And this discourse the King reiterated to him, as often as he had liberty to see him, with all the earnestness, and passion he could express; which was so fixed in his Memory that he never forgot it. And many years after, when he was sent out of <HI>England,</HI> he made the full relation of all the particulars to Me, with that commotion of Spirit, that it appear'd to be deeply <MILESTONE N="20"/> rooted in him; and made use of one part of it very seasonably after∣wards, where there was more than an ordinary attempt made to have perverted him in his Religion, and to perswade him to become Roman Catholick for the advancement of his Fortune.</P>
<P>IN this manner, and with these kind of reflections, the King made use of the Liberty he enjoyed; and consider'd as well, what remedies to apply to the worst that could fall out, as to caress the Officers of the Army in order to the improvement of his condition; of which he was not yet in despair; the Chief Officers, and all the heads of that Party, looking upon it as their wisest Policy to cherish the King's hopes by the <MILESTONE N="30"/> liberty they gave him, and by a very flowing courtesy towards all who had been of his Party; whose expectation, and good word, and testi∣mony, they found did them much good both in the City and the Country.</P>
<P>AT this time the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> whom We left in <HI>Jersy,</HI> hearing of the difference between the Parliament and the Army, left his two Friends there; and made a Journey to <HI>Paris</HI> to the Prince, that he might re∣ceive his Highness's approbation of his going for <HI>England;</HI> which he very willingly gave; well knowing that he would improve all opportu∣nities, with great diligence, for the King his Father's Service: and then <MILESTONE N="40"/> that Lord transported himself into <HI>Zealand,</HI> his Friends having advised him to be in those parts before they endeavour'd to procure a Pass for him; which they easily did, assoon as he came thither; and so he had liberty to remain at his own House in the Country, where he was ex∣ceedingly belov'd, and hated no where. And in this general and illi∣mited <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Ca∣pel <HI>waits on the King at</HI> Hampton <HI>Court from</HI> Jersy.</NOTE> indulgence, he took the opportunity to wait upon the King at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court; and gave him a particular Account of all that passed at <HI>Jersy,</HI> before the Prince's remove from thence, and of the reasons which induced those of the Council to remain still there, and of many other particulars, of which his Majesty had never before been through∣ly <MILESTONE N="50"/> inform'd, and which put it out of any Bodies power to do the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer any ill offices: and from thence the King writ, with his own hand, a very gracious and kind Letter to the Chancellor
<PB N="54" REF="760"/>
at <HI>Jersy;</HI> full of hope <Q>“that he should conclude such a Treaty with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Substance of the King's Letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</NOTE> Army and Parliament that he should shortly draw Him, and some” other of his Friends, to him.</Q> He thanked him <Q>“for undertaking the work he was upon; and told him, he should expect speedily to receive” some contribution from him towards it;</Q> and, within a very short time afterwards, he sent to him his own Memorials (or those which by his command had been kept, and were perused, and corrected by him∣self) of all that had passed from the time he had left his Majesty at <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> when he waited upon the Prince into the West, to the very day that the King left <HI>Oxford</HI> to go to the <HI>Scots;</HI> out of which Memorials, <MILESTONE N="10"/> as hath been said before, the most important passages in the years 1644, and 1645, are faithfully collected. To the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> his Majesty im∣parted all his hopes and all his fears; and what great Overtures the <HI>Scots</HI> had again made to him; and <Q>“that he did really believe that it could not be long before there would be a War between the two Nations; in which the <HI>Scots</HI> promised themselves an universal concurrence from all the Presbyterians in <HI>England;</HI> and that, in such a conjuncture, he wished that his own Party would put themselves in Armes, without” which he could not expect great benefit by the success of the other:</Q> and therefore desired <HI>Capel</HI> <Q>“to watch such a conjuncture, and draw his” <MILESTONE N="20"/> Friends together;</Q> which he promised to do effectually; and did, very punctually, afterwards, to the loss of his own Life. Then the King en∣joyn'd him <Q>“to write to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that when∣ever the Queen, or Prince, should require him to come to them, he” should not fail to yield obedience to their Command;</Q> and himself writ to the Queen, <Q>“that whenever the Season should be ripe for the Prince to engage himself in any Action, she should not fail to send” for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to wait upon him in it.</Q> And ma∣ny things were then adjusted, upon the foresight of future contingencies, which were afterwards thought fit to be executed. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had, by special Command and Order from the King whilst he was with the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> deliver'd up the City of <HI>Dublin</HI> to the Parliament, after the <HI>Irish</HI> had so infamously broken the Peace they had made with the King, and brought their whole Army before <HI>Dublin</HI> to Besiege it; by which he was reduced to those streights that he had no other election than to deliver it to the <HI>Irish,</HI> or to the Parliament; of which his Majesty being inform'd, determin'd, he should give it to the Parliament; which he did, with full conditions for all those who had serv'd his Majesty; and so transported himself into <HI>England,</HI> and, from <HI>London,</HI> presented himself to the King at <HI>Hampton</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>likewise waits on the King at</HI> Hampton <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> Court; who receiv'd him with extraordinary Grace, as a Person who had serv'd him with great Zeal and Fidelity, and with the most universal Testimony of all good Men that any Man could receive. He used less Application to the Parliament and Army than other Men, relying upon the Articles the Parliament had sign'd to him; by which he had liberty to stay so many Months in <HI>England,</HI> and at the end thereof to transport himself into the parts beyond the Seas, if in the mean time he made no composition with the Parliament: which he never intended to do; and though he knew well that there were many jealous Eyes upon him, he repaired frequently to present his Duty to the King; who was exceed∣ingly <MILESTONE N="50"/> pleased to conser with him, and to find that he was resolv'd to undertake any enterprise that might advance his Service; which the King himself, and most other Men who wished well to it, did at that
<PB N="55" REF="770"/>
time believe to be in no desperate condition. And no Men were fuller <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> Scotish <HI>Commissioners.</HI></NOTE> of professions of Duty, and a resolution to run all hazards, than the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners; who, from the time they had deliver'd up the King, resided at <HI>London</HI> with their usual confidence, and loudly com∣plain'd of the presumption of the Army in seising upon the Person of the King; insinuated themselves to all those who were thought to be most constant, and inseparable from the Interest of the Crown, with passio∣nate undertaking that their whole Nation would be united, to a Man, in any Enterprise for his Service. And now, from the time his Majesty came to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, they came to him with as much presumption <MILESTONE N="10"/> as if they had carried him to <HI>Edenborough;</HI> which was the more noto∣rious, and was thought to signify the more, because their Persons were known to be most odious to all the great Officers in the Army, and to those who now govern'd in the Parliament. Here the foundation of that engagement was laid, which was endeavour'd to be perform'd the next year ensuing, and which the <HI>Scots</HI> themselves then communicated to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> and other trusty Persons; as if there was nothing else intended in it than a full vindication of all his Majesties Rights and Interest.</P>
<P>WHEN the Army had thus subdued all opposition, and the Parlia∣ment <MILESTONE N="20"/> and They seem'd all of a piece, and the refractory humours of the City seem'd to be suppress'd, and totally tamed, the Army seem'd less <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army be∣gins to be less regardful of the King</NOTE> regardful of the King than they had been; the chief Officers came rarely to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, nor had they the same countenances towards <HI>Ash∣burnham,</HI> and <HI>Berkley,</HI> as they used to have; they were not at leisure to speak with them, and when they did, asked captious Questions, and gave Answers themselves of no signification. The Agitators, and Coun∣cil of Officers, sent some Propositions to the King, as ruinous to the Church and destructive to the Regal Power, as had been yet made by the Parliament; and in some respects, much worse, and more disho∣nourable; <MILESTONE N="30"/> and said, <Q>“if his Majesty would consent thereunto, they would apply themselves to the Parliament, and do the best they could to” perswade them to be of the same opinion.</Q> But his Majesty rejected them with more than usual indignation, not without some reproaches upon the Officers, for having deluded him, and having prevailed in all their own designs, by making the world believe that they intended his Majesties Restoration and Settlement, upon better conditions than the Parliament was willing to admit. By this manner of resentment, the Army took it self to be disobliged, and used another language in their discourse of the King than they had, for some Months, done; and such <MILESTONE N="40"/> Officers who had formerly serv'd the King, and had been civilly treated and shelter'd in the Quarters of the Army, were now driven from thence. They who had been kind to them, withdrew themselves from their ac∣quaintance; and the Sequestrations of all the Estates of the Cavaliers, which had been intermitted, were revived with as much rigour as ever had been before practiced, and the declared Delinquents racked to as high compositions; which if they refused to make, their whole Estates were taken from them, and their Persons exposed to affronts, and inse∣curity; but this was imputed to the prevalence of the Presbyterian hu∣mour in the Parliament against the judgement of the Army: and it is <MILESTONE N="50"/> very true, that though the Parliament was so far subdued, that it no more found fault with what the Army did, nor complain'd that it meddled in determining what settlement should be made in the Govern∣ment,
<PB N="56" REF="780"/>
yet, in all their own Acts and Proceedings, they prosecuted a Presbyterian Settlement as earnestly as they could. The Covenant was pressed in all places, and the Anabaptists and other Sects, which begun to abound, were punished, restrained, and discountenanced; which the Army liked not, as a violation of the Liberty of tender Consciences; which, they pretended, was as much the Original of the Quarrel, as any other Grievance whatsoever.</P>
<P>IN this year, 1647, they had begun a Visitation of the University of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The University of</HI> Oxford <HI>vi∣sited by the Parliament.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Oxford;</HI> which they finished not till the next year; in which the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> had been contented to be imployed as Chancellor of the <MILESTONE N="10"/> University, who had taken an Oath to defend the Rights and Privileges of the University; notwithstanding which, out of the extreme weak∣ness of his understanding, and the miserable complyance of his Nature, he suffer'd himself to be made a Property in joyning with <HI>Brent, Pryn,</HI> and some Committee Men, and Presbyterian Ministers, as Commis∣sioners for the Parliament to reform the Discipline, and erroneous Doctrine of that famous University, by the Rule of the Covenant; which was the Standard of all Mens learning, and ability to govern; all Persons of what Quality soever being required to subscribe that Test; which the whole Body of the University was so far from submitting to, <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Oxford <HI>Reasons a∣gainst the Co∣venant pass'd in Convoca∣tion this time.</HI></NOTE> that they met in their Convocation, and, to their eternal renown (be∣ing at the same time under a strict and strong Garrison, put over them by the Parliament; the King in Prison; and all their hopes desperate) passed a publick Act, and Declaration against the Covenant, with such invincible Arguments of the Illegality, Wickedness, and Perjury con∣tained in it, that no Man of the contrary opinion, nor the Assembly of the Divines (which then sate at <HI>Westminster,</HI> forming a new Cate∣chism, and Scheme of Religion) ever ventur'd to make any Answer to it; nor is it indeed to be answer'd, but must remain, to the World's end, as a monument of the Learning, Courage, and Loyalty, of that excel∣lent <MILESTONE N="30"/> place, against the highest Malice and Tyranny that was ever exer∣cised in, or over any Nation; and which those famous Commissioners only answer'd by expelling all those who refused to submit to their ju∣risdiction, or to take the Covenant; which was, upon the matter, the whole University; scarce one Governour and Master of College or Hall, and an incredible small Number of the Fellows, or Scholars, submitting to either; whereupon that desolation being made, they placed in their rooms, the most notorious factious Presbyterians, in the Government of the several Colleges or Halls; and such other of the same leven in the Fellowships, and Scholars places, of those whom they had expelled, <MILESTONE N="40"/> without any regard to the Statutes of the several Founders, and the Incapacities of the Persons that were put in. The Omnipotence of an Ordinance of Parliament, confirm'd all that was this way done; and there was no farther contending against it.</P>
<P>IT might reasonably be concluded that this wild and barbarous de∣population, would even extirpate all that Learning, Religion, and Loyalty, which had so eminently flourished there; and that the suc∣ceeding ill Husbandry, and unskilful cultivation, would have made it fruitful only in Ignorance, Prophanation, Atheism, and Rebellion; but, by God's wonderful blessing, the goodness and richness of that Soil could <MILESTONE N="50"/> not be made barren by all that stupidity and negligence. It choaked the Weeds, and would not suffer the poysonous Seeds, which were sown with industry enough, to spring up; but after several Tyrannical Go∣vernments,
<PB N="57" REF="790"/>
mutually succeeding each other, and with the same malice and perversness endeavouring to extinguish all good Literature and Al∣legiance, it yielded a Harvest of extraordinary good and sound know∣ledge in all parts of Learning; and many who were wickedly introduced, applied themselves to the Study of good Learning, and the practice of Virtue; and had inclination to that duty and obedience they had never been taught; so that when it pleased God to bring King <HI>Charles</HI> the second back to his Throne, he found that University (not to undervalue the other, which had nobly likewise rejected the ill infusions which had been industriously poured into it) abounding in excellent Learning, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> devoted to Duty and Obedience, little inferior to what it was before its desolation; which was a lively instance of God's mercy, and purpose, for ever so to provide for his Church, that the Gates of Hell shall never prevail against it; which were never open'd wider, nor with more Ma∣lice, than in that time.</P>
<P>THESE violent Proceedings in all places, blasted all the King's hopes, and put an end to all the rest and quiet he had for some time enjoyed; nor could he devise any remedy. He was weary of depending upon the Army, but neither knew how to get from them, nor whither else to resort for help. The Officers of those Guards which were assign'd to <MILESTONE N="20"/> attend his Person, and who had behaved themselves with good Man∣ners, and Duty towards him, and very civilly towards those of his Party who had used to wait upon his Majesty, begun now to murmur at so great resort to him, and to use many, who came, rudely; and not to suffer them to go into the room where the King was; or, which was worse, put them out when they were there; and when his Majesty seem'd to take notice and be troubled at it, they appear'd not to be con∣cern'd, nor answer'd him with that Duty they had used to do. They affronted the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners very notably, and would not suffer them to speak with the King; which caused an expostulation from the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Parliament; which removed the obstruction for the future, but pro∣cured no satisfaction for the injury they had receiv'd, nor made the same Officers more civil towards their Persons. <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> and <HI>Berkley,</HI> receiv'd many advertisements from some Officers with whom they had most conversed, and who would have been glad that the King might have been restored by the Army for the preferments which they expected might fall to their share, <Q>“that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <HI>Ireton</HI> resolv'd never to” trust the King, or to do any thing towards his Restoration;</Q> and they two steer'd the whole Body; and therefore it was advised, <Q>“that some” way might be found to remove his Majesty out of their hands.</Q> Major <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Huntington,</HI> one of the best Officers they had, and Major to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s own Regiment of Horse, upon whom he relyed in any Enterprise of importance more than upon any Man, had been imployed by him to the King, to say those things from him which had given the King the most confidence, and was much more than he had ever said to <HI>Ashburn∣ham;</HI> and the Major did really believe that he had meant all he said, and the King had a good opinion of the Integrity of the Major, upon the Testimony he had receiv'd from some he knew had no mind to de∣ceive his Majesty; and the Man merited the Testimony they gave him. He, when he observ'd <HI>Cromwell</HI> to grow colder in his Expressions for <MILESTONE N="50"/> the King than he had formerly been, expostulated with him in very sharp terms, for <Q>“abusing him, and making him the Instrument to cou∣zen the King; and, though the other endeavour'd to perswade him”
<PB N="58" REF="800"/>
that all should be well, he inform'd his Majesty of all he had observ'd;</Q> and told him, <Q>“that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was a Villain, and would destroy him” if he were not prevented;</Q> and, in a short time after, he gave up his Commission, and would serve no longer in the Army. <HI>Cromwell</HI> him∣self expostulated with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> and complain'd <Q>“that the King could not be trusted; and that he had no affection or confidence in the Army, but was jealous of them, and of all the Officers: that he had Intreagues in the Parliament, and Treaties with the Presbyterians of the City, to raise new troubles; that he had a Treaty concluded with the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners to engage the Nation again in blood; and <MILESTONE N="10"/> therefore he would not be answerable if any thing fell out amiss, and” contrary to expectation;</Q> and that was the reason, besides the old Ani∣mosity, that had drawn on the Affront, which the Commissioners had complain'd of. What that Treaty was, and what it produced, will be mention'd in a more proper place.</P>
<P>THERE was at this time a new Faction grown up in the Army, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Levellers grew up in the Army.</NOTE> which were either by their own denomination, or with their own con∣sent, called <HI>Levellers;</HI> who spoke insolently and confidently against the King and Parliament, and the great Officers of the Army; and pro∣fessed as great malice against all the Lords, as against the King; and de∣clared <MILESTONE N="20"/> <Q>“that all degrees of Men should be levelled, and an equality should” be established, both in Titles and Estates, throughout the Kingdoms.</Q> Whether the raising this Spirit was a piece of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s ordinary witch∣craft, in order to some of his designs, or whether it grew amongst those Tares which had been sowed in that confusion, certain it is, it gave him real trouble at last (which must be set down hereafter) but the present use he made of it, was, that, upon the licentious discourse of that kind, which some Soldiers upon the Guard usually made, the Guard upon the King's Person was doubled; a restraint put upon the great resort of People who came to see the King; and all pretended to be for his secu∣rity, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and to prevent any violence that might be attempted upon his life; which they seem'd to apprehend, and detest. In the mean time, they neither hinder'd his Majesty from riding abroad to take the Air, nor from doing any thing he had a mind to, nor restrain'd those who waited upon him in his Bed-Chamber, nor his Chaplains from performing their functions; though towards all these there was less civility exercised than had been; and the Guards which waited nearest, were more rude, and made more noise at unseasonable hours than they had been accustom'd to do; the Captain who commanded them, Colonel <HI>Whaley,</HI> being a Man of a rough and brutal temper, who had offer'd great violence to <MILESTONE N="40"/> his Nature, when he appear'd to exercise any civility and good manners. The King, every day, receiv'd little Billets, or Letters, secretly con∣veyed to him without any Name, which advertised him of wicked de∣signs upon his life, and some of them advised him to make an Escape, and repair secretly into the City, where he should be safe; some Let∣ters directing him to such an Alderman's House; all which his Majesty looked upon as artifice to lead him into some streights, from whence he should not easily explicate himself; and yet many who repaired to him, brought the same advice from Men of unquestionable sincerity, by what reason soever they were swayed. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE King found himself in great perplexity, from what he discern'd, and observ'd himself, as well as what he heard from others; but what use to make of the one or the other, was very hard to resolve: he did
<PB N="59" REF="810"/>
really believe that their Malice was at the height, and that they did de∣sign his Murther, but knew not which was a probable way to prevent it. The making an escape, if it were not contrived with wonderful sa∣gacity, would expose him to be assassinated, by pretended Ignorance, and would be charged upon himself; and if he could avoid their Guards, and get beyond them undiscover'd, whither should he go? and what place would receive and defend him? The hope of the City seem'd not to him to have a foundation of reason; they had been too late subdued to recover Courage for such an adventure; and the Army now was much more Master of it than when they desponded. There is reason to <MILESTONE N="10"/> believe that he did resolve to transport himself beyond the Seas, which had been no hard matter to have brought to pass, but with whom he consulted for the way of doing it, is not to this day discover'd; they who were instrumental in his remove, pretending to know nothing of the resolution, or counsel. But, one morning, being the eleventh of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King escapes from</HI> Hampton <HI>Court</HI> No. 11.</NOTE> <HI>November,</HI> the King having, the night before, pretended some indispo∣sition, and that he would go to his rest, they who went into his Cham∣ber, found that he was not there, nor had been in his Bed that night. There were two or three Letters found upon his Table, writ all with his own hand, one to the Parliament, another to the General; in which <MILESTONE N="20"/> he declared <Q>“the reason of his remove to be, an apprehension that some desperate Persons had a design to Assassinate him; and therefore he had withdrawn himself with a purpose of remaining concealed, until the Parliament had agreed upon such Propositions as should be fit for him to consent to; and he would then appear, and willingly consent to any thing that should be for the Peace and Happiness of the King∣dom.”</Q> There were discover'd the treading of Horses at a Back door of the Garden into which his Majesty had a Passage out of his Chamber, and it is true that way he went, having appointed his Horse to be there ready at an hour, and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley, Ashburnham,</HI> and <HI>Legg,</HI> to wait <MILESTONE N="30"/> upon him, the two last being of his Bed-Chamber. <HI>Ashburnham</HI> alone seem'd to know what they were to do, the other two having receiv'd only Orders to attend. When they were free from the Apprehension of the Guards, and the Horse Quarters, they rode towards the South West, and towards that part of <HI>Hamshire</HI> which led to the New Forest. The King asked <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> where the Ship lay? which made the other two conclude that the King resolv'd to transport himself. After they had made some stay in that part next the Sea, and <HI>Ashburnham</HI> had been some time absent, he return'd without any news of the Ship; with which the King seem'd troubled. Upon this disappointment, the King <MILESTONE N="40"/> thought it best, for avoiding all high-ways, to go to <HI>Tichfield,</HI> a noble <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He comes to</HI> Tichfield <HI>in</HI> Hamshire.</NOTE> Seat of the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI>'s (who was not there) but inhabited by the old Lady his Mother with a small Family, which made the re∣treat the more convenient; there his Majesty alighted, and would speak with the Lady; to whom he made no scruple of communicating him∣self, well knowing her to be a Lady of that Honour, and Spirit, that she was superior to all kind of temptation. There he refreshed himself, and consulted with his three Servants, what he should next do, since there was neither Ship ready, nor could they presume that they could remain long there undiscover'd. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>IN this debate, the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> came to be mention'd (as they say) by <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> as a place where his Majesty might securely repose himself, until he thought fit to inform the Parliament where he was.
<PB N="60" REF="820"/>
Colonel <HI>Hammond</HI> was Governour there, an Officer of the Army, and of nearest trust with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> having by his advice been Married to a Daughter of <HI>John Hambden,</HI> whose memory he allways adored; yet, by some fatal mistake, this Man was thought a Person of Honour and Generosity enough to trust the King's Person to, and <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sends</HI> Ash∣burnham <HI>and</HI> Berkley <HI>to Col.</HI> Ham∣mond <HI>in the Isle of</HI> Wight.</NOTE> <HI>Berkley,</HI> were sent to him with Orders, <Q>“first to be sure that the Man would faithfully promise not to deliver his Majesty up though the Par∣liament or Army should require him, but to give him his Liberty to shift for himself, if he were not able to defend him; and except he would make that promise, they should not let him know where his” <MILESTONE N="10"/> Majesty was, but should return presently to him.</Q> With this Com∣mission they two crossed the Water to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> the King in the mean time reposing himself at <HI>Tichfield.</HI> The next day they found Co∣lonel <HI>Hammond;</HI> who was known to them both, who had conversation with him in the Army, when the King was well treated there (and their Persons had been very civilly treated by most of the Officers, who thought themselves qualified sufficiently for Court Preferments) <Q>They told him, “”that the King was withdrawn from the Army;</Q> of which he seem'd to have had no notice, and to be very much surprised with it. They then said, <Q>“that the King had so good an opinion of him, knowing him to <MILESTONE N="20"/> be a Gentleman, and for his relation to D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hammond</HI> (whose Nephew he was) that he would trust his Person with him, and would from thence write to the Parliament, if he would promise that if his Mes∣sage had not that effect which he hoped it would have, he would leave him to himself to go whither he thought fit, and would not deliver” him to the Parliament, or Army, if they should require it.</Q> His An∣swer was, <Q>“that he would pay all the Duty and Service to his Majesty that was in his power; and, if he pleased to come thither, he would receive and entertain him as well as he could; but that he was an In∣ferior Officer, and must obey his Superiors in whatsoever they thought” <MILESTONE N="30"/> fit to command him: with which when he saw they were not satisfied,</Q> he asked, <Q>“where the King was? to which they made no other Answer, but that they would acquaint his Majesty with his Answer, and, if he were satisfied with it, they would return to him again. He demanded that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham</HI> would stay with him, and that the other might” go to the King;</Q> which M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham</HI> refused to do.</P>
<P>AFTER some time spent in debate, in which he made many expres∣sions of his desire to do any Service to his Majesty, they were contented that he should go with them; and <HI>Ashburnham</HI> said, <Q>“he would con∣duct” him to the place where the King was;</Q> and so, he commanding <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They bring</HI> Hammond <HI>to the King.</HI></NOTE> three or four Servants or Soldiers to wait on him, they went together to <HI>Tichfield;</HI> and, the other staying below, <HI>Ashburnham</HI> went up to the King's Chamber. When he had acquainted him with all that had passed, and that <HI>Hammond</HI> was in the House, his Majesty broke out in a pas∣sionate exclamation, and said, <Q>“”O <HI>Jack,</HI> thou hast undone me!</Q> with which the other falling into a great passion of weeping, offer'd to go down, and to kill <HI>Hammond;</HI> to which his Majesty would not consent; and, after some pausing, and deliberation, sent for him up, and endea∣vour'd to perswade him to make the same promise, which had before been proposed; to which he made the same Answer he had done, but <MILESTONE N="50"/> with many professions of doing all the offices he could for his Majesty; and seem'd to believe that the Army would do well for him. The King believ'd that there was now no possible way to get from him, he having
<PB N="61" REF="830"/>
the Command of the Country, and could call in what help he would; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hammond <HI>removes the Kin to</HI> Caris∣brooke <HI>Castle.</HI></NOTE> and so went with him into the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and was lodged at <HI>Caris∣brooke</HI> Castle, at first with all demonstration of respect and duty.</P>
<P>IT never appear'd afterwards that the King was malitiously betrayed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's opinion of this whole business.</NOTE> to this unhappy peregrination, by the treachery and practice of those he trusted; and his Majesty himself never entertain'd the least jealousy, or suspicion of it; yet the whole design appear'd to be so weakly con∣trived, the not being sure of a Ship, if the resolution were fixed for em∣barking, which was never manifest, the making choice of the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and of <HI>Hammond</HI> to be trusted, since nothing fell out which was <MILESTONE N="10"/> not to be reasonably foreseen and expected, and the bringing him to <HI>Tichfield,</HI> without the permission of the King, if not directly contrary to it, seem'd to be all so far from a rational design and conduct, that most Men did believe there was Treason in the contrivance, or that his Majesty entrusted those who were grossly imposed upon and deceiv'd by his greatest Enemies. <HI>Legg</HI> had had so general a reputation of In∣tegrity, and Fidelity to his Master, that he never fell under the least imputation or reproach with any Man: he was a very punctual and steady observer of the Orders he receiv'd, but no contriver of them, and though he had in truth a better judgement and understanding than <MILESTONE N="20"/> either of the other two, his modesty and diffidence of himself never suf∣fer'd him to contrive bold Counsels. <HI>Berkley</HI> was less known among those Persons of Honour and Quality who had follow'd the King, being in a very private Station before the War, and his Post in it being in the farthest Corner of the Kingdom, and not much spoken of till the end of it, when he was not beholden to reports; Ambition and Vanity were well known to be predominant in him, and that he had great confidence in himself, and did not delight to converse with those who had not; but he never fell under any blemish of disloyalty, and he took care to pub∣lish that this Enterprise of the King's was so totally without his privity, <MILESTONE N="30"/> that he was required to attend on Horse-back at such an hour, and had not the least intimation of his Majesties purpose what he intended to do. Another particular, which was acknowledged by <HI>Hammond,</HI> did him much credit, that when <HI>Hammond</HI> demanded that <HI>Ashburnham</HI> should remain with him whilst the other went to the King, which <HI>Ash∣burnham</HI> refused to do, <HI>Berkley</HI> did offer himself to remain with him whilst <HI>Ashburnham</HI> should attend his Majesty; so that the whole weight of the prejudice and reproach was cast upon <HI>Ashburnham;</HI> who was known to have so great an Interest in the Affections of his Majesty, and so great an influence upon his counsels and resolutions, that he could <MILESTONE N="40"/> not be ignorant of any thing that moved him.</P>
<P>THE not having a Ship ready, if it were intended, was unexcusable; and the putting the King into <HI>Hammond</HI>'s hands without his leave, could never be wiped out. There were some who said, that <HI>Ashburnham</HI> resolv'd that the King should go to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> before he left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court; and the Lord <HI>Langdale</HI> often said, <Q>“that being in M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham</HI>'s Chamber at that time, he had the curiosity, whilst the other went out of the Room, to look upon a Paper that lay upon the Table; in which was writ, that it would be best for the King to withdraw from the Army, where he was in such danger; and that the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> would be a good retreat, where Colonel <HI>Hammond</HI> Com∣manded;”</Q> who was a very honest Man. And this was some days before his Majesty removed. And then it was observ'd, that <HI>Hammond</HI> him∣self

left the Army but two or three days before the King's remove, and went to the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> at a Season when there was no visible occasion to draw him thither, and when the Agitators in the Army were at highest; and it was looked upon with the more wonder, because <HI>Ash∣burnham</HI> was not afterwards called in Question for being instrumental in the King's going away, but liv'd unquestion'd long after in the sight of the Parliament, and in conversation with some of the Officers of the Army who had most deceiv'd him; and, which was more censured than all the rest, that after the Murther of the King he compounded, as was reported, at an easy rate, and liv'd at ease, and grew rich, for many <MILESTONE N="10"/> years together without interruption.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, he preserv'd his reputation and credit with the most eminent of the King's Party; and his remaining in <HI>England</HI> was upon the Marriage of a Lady by whom he had a great Fortune, and many conveniencies; which would have been seised by his leaving the Kingdom; and he did send over to the King, and had leave to stay there; and sometimes supplied the King with considerable Sums of Money. Afterwards he was committed to the Tower by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> where he remain'd till his death; and the King was known to have had, to the last, a clear opinion of his Affection, and Integrity; and when King <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Charles</HI> the Second return'd, most of those of greatest reputation, as the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> gave him a good Testimony; yet then, the old discourses were revived, and Major <HI>Huntington</HI> did affirm, <Q>“that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham</HI> did intend the King” should go to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> before he left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court.</Q> Many who did not believe him to be corrupted, did still think that <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton</HI> had overwitted him, and perswaded him, upon great pro∣mises, that it should prove for his Majesties benefit, and that they should the sooner do his business, that he should withdraw from the Army, and put himself into <HI>Hammond</HI>'s hands; for if in truth transportation had <MILESTONE N="30"/> been thought of, it is hard to believe that a Ship would not have been provided.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Berkley,</HI> who, shortly after the King's being in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> had transported himself into <HI>France,</HI> and remain'd still with the Duke of <HI>York</HI> to the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's return, and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> who continued in <HI>England,</HI> and so the more liable to reproach, had been so sollicitous to wipe off the aspersions which were cast upon them joyntly, that they had it in care to preserve the repu∣tation of a joynt innocence; but whilst each endeavour'd to clear him∣self, he objected or imputed somewhat to the other, that made him <MILESTONE N="40"/> liable to just censure; and, in this contention, their Friends mention'd their several discourses so loudly, and so passionately for the credit and reputation of him whom they lov'd best, that they contracted a very avow'd Animosity against each other; insomuch as it was generally be∣liev'd upon the King's Return, that they would, with some fierceness, have expostulated with each other in that way which angry Men choose to determine the right, or that both of them would have desired the King to have caused the whole to be so strictly examin'd, that the world might have discern'd, where the faults or oversights had been, if no worse could have been charged upon them: but they applied themselves <MILESTONE N="50"/> to neither of those expedients, and liv'd only as Men who took no de∣light in each others Conversation, and who did not desire to cherish any familiarity together. And the King, who was satisfied that there had
<PB N="63" REF="850"/>
been no Treasonable contrivance (from which his Father had absolv'd them) did not think it fit, upon such a Subject, to make strict inquisi∣tion into Inadvertencies, Indiscretions, and Presumptions, which could not have been punished proportionally.</P>
<P>IT is true that they both writ Apologies, or Narrations of all that had passed in that Affair, which they made not publick, but gave in writing to such of their Friends in whose opinions they most desired to be absolv'd, without any Inclination that one should see what the other had writ; in which, though there were several reflections upon each other, and differences in occurrences of less moment, there was nothing <MILESTONE N="10"/> in either that seem'd to doubt of the Integrity of the other; nor any clear relation of any probable inducement that prevailed with the King to undertake that Journey. I have read both their Relations, and con∣ferr'd with both of them at large, to discover in truth what the motives might be which led to so fatal an end; and, if I were obliged to deliver my own opinion, I should declare that neither of them were, in any degree, corrupted in their Loyalty or Affection to the King, or suborn'd to gratify any Persons with a disservice to their Master. They were both of them great Opiniators, yet irresolute, and easy to be shaken by any thing they had not thought of before; and exceedingly undervalued <MILESTONE N="20"/> each others understanding; but, as it usually falls out in Men of that kind of Composition, and Talent, they were both disposed to commu∣nicate more freely with, and, consequently, to be advised by new Ac∣quaintance, and Men they had lately begun to know, than old Friends, and such whose judgements they could not but esteem; who they had no mind should go sharers with them in the merit of any notable Ser∣vice which they thought themselves able to bring to pass. Then, in the whole managery of the King's business, from the time that they came into the Army, they never conversed with the same Persons; but go∣vern'd themselves by what they receiv'd from those whose correspon∣dence <MILESTONE N="30"/> they had chosen. <HI>Ashburnham</HI> seem'd wholely to rely upon <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> and <HI>Ireton;</HI> and rather upon what they said to others than to himself. For besides outward Civilities, which they both exercised to∣wards him more than to other Men, they seldom held private discourse with him, perswading him <Q>“that it was better for both their ends, in respect of the jealousy the Parliament had of them, that they should understand each others mind, as to the transaction of any particulars, from third Persons mutually intrusted between them, than from fre∣quent” consultations together;</Q> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Ford,</HI> who had Mar∣ried <HI>Ireton</HI>'s Sister, but had been himself an Officer in the King's Army <MILESTONE N="40"/> from the beginning of the War, and a Gentleman of good meaning, though not able to fathom the reserv'd and dark designs of his Brother in Law, was trusted to pass between them, with some other Officers of the Army, who had given <HI>Ashburnham</HI> reason to believe that they had honest Purposes.</P>
<P>BERKLEY had not found that respect, from <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> that he expected; at least discern'd it to be greater towards <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> than it was to Him; which he thought evidence enough of a defect of judgement in them; and therefore had applied himself to others, who had not so great Names, but greater Interest, as he thought, in the Sol∣diers. <MILESTONE N="50"/> His chief confidence was in D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Staines,</HI> who, though a D<SUP>r</SUP> in Phy∣sick, was Quarter Master General of the Army; and one <HI>Watson,</HI> who was Scout Master General of the Army; both of the Council of War,
<PB N="64" REF="860"/>
both in good credit with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and both notable Fanaticks, and professed Enemies to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Presbyterians, and, no doubt, were both permitted, and instructed to caress S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley,</HI> and, by admiring his wisdom and conduct, to oblige him to depend on theirs; and dissimulation had so great, and supreme an influence on the Hearts and Spirits of all those who were trusted, and imployed by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that no Man was safe in their Company, but he who resolv'd before, not to believe one word they said. These two Persons knew well how to humour S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley,</HI> who believ'd them the more, because they seem'd very much to blame <HI>Ireton</HI>'s stubbornness towards the King, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> to fear that he often prevailed upon <HI>Cromwell</HI> against his own Inclina∣tions: They inform'd him of many particulars which passed in the Coun∣cil of Officers, and sometimes of advice from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that was clean contrary to what the King receiv'd by <HI>Ashburnham</HI> as his opinion, and which was found afterwards to be true (as it may be the other was too) which exceedingly confirm'd S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John</HI> in the good opinion he had of his two Friends. They were the first who positively advertised the King by him, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> would never do him Service; and the first who seem'd to apprehend that the King's Person was in danger, and that there was some secret design upon his Life. <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>I DO not believe that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley</HI> knew any thing of the King's purpose in his intended escape, or whither he resolv'd to go, or, indeed, more of it than that he resolv'd at such an hour, and in such a place, to take Horse, and was himself required to attend him; nor do I, in truth, think that the King himself, when he took Horse, resolv'd whither to go. Some think he meant to go into the City; others, that he intended for <HI>Jersy;</HI> and that was the ground of the Question to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> <Q>“”where is the Ship?</Q> Certain it is that the King never thought of going to the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI> I am not sure that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> who had not yet given over all hope of the chief Officers of the Army, and be∣liev'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> the alterations, which had fallen out, proceeded from the barba∣rity of the Agitators, and the Levelling Party, had not the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> in his view from the beginning, that is, from the time his Majesty thought it necessary to make an escape from the Army. It had been a difficult task to go about to disswade the King from an apprehension of his own safety, when it was much more natural to sear an Assassination, than to apprehend any thing that they did afterwards do. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham</HI> had so great a detestation of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that he expected no good from their fraternity, the Presbyterians of the City; and did really believe that if his Majesty should put himself into their hands, as was advised by many, <MILESTONE N="40"/> with a purpose that he should be there concealed, till some favourable conjuncture should offer it self (for no body imagin'd that, upon his ar∣rival there, the City would have declared for him, and have enter'd into a Contest with that Army which had so lately subdued them) the security of such an escape was not to be relied on, and very earnestly disswaded his Master from entertaining the thought of it; and this opi∣nion of his was universally known, and, as hath been said before, was an ingredient into the composition of that civility and kindness the Of∣ficers of the Army had for him. They did, to him, frequently lament the Levelling Spirit that was gotten into the Soldiers, which they fore∣saw <MILESTONE N="50"/> would in the future be as inconvenient, and mischievous to them∣selves, as it was, for the present, dangerous to the Person of the King; which they seem'd wonderfully to apprehend, and protested <Q>“that they
<PB N="65" REF="870"/>
knew not how to apply any remedy to it, whilst his Majesty was in the Army; but that they would quickly correct or subdue it, if the” King were at any distance from them;</Q> and it is not impossible, that, in such discourses, some body who was trusted by them, if not one of themselves, might mention the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> as a good place to retire to, and Colonel <HI>Hammond</HI> as a Man of good intentions; the minutes of which discourse M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham</HI> might keep by him; for the Lord <HI>Langdale</HI>'s relation of such a Paper, which he himself saw, and read, cannot be thought by me to be a meer fiction; to which, besides that he was a Person of unblemished honour and veracity, he had not any <MILESTONE N="10"/> temptation; yet M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham</HI> did constantly deny that he ever saw any such Paper, or had any thought of the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> when the King left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and he never gave cause, in the subsequent Actions of his Life, to have his fidelity suspected. And it is probable, that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who many years afterwards committed him to the Tower, and did hate him, and desired to have taken his Life, would have been glad to have blasted his reputation, by declaring that he had carried his Master to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> without his privity, upon his own pre∣sumption; which, how well soever intended, must have been looked upon by all Men as such a transcendent crime, as must have deprived <MILESTONE N="20"/> him of all compassion for the worst that could befal him.</P>
<P>THE suddain unexpected withdrawing of the King, made a great impression upon the minds of all Men, every Man fancying that his Majesty would do that which He wished he would do. The Presbyte∣rians imagined that he lay concealed in the City (which they unreason∣ably thought he might easily do) and would expect a proper conjuncture, upon a new rupture between the Parliament, and the Army, and the many factions in the Army, which every day appear'd, to discover him∣self. The Cavaliers hoped that he would transport himself into the parts beyond the Seas, and quietly attend there, those alterations at <MILESTONE N="30"/> home, which might probably in a short time invite his return. The Army was not without this apprehension, as imagining it the worst that could fall out to their purposes.</P>
<P>THE Parliament, that is, that part of it that was devoted to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment's beha∣viour upon the news of the King's withdrawing, and where he was.</NOTE> Army, was most frighted with the imagination that the King was in the City, and would lurk there until some conspiracy should be ripe, and all his Party should be present in <HI>London</HI> to second it; and therefore they no sooner heard that he was gone from <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, than they passed an Ordinance of both Houses, by which they declared, <Q>“that it should be confiscation of Estate, and loss of Life, to any Man who <MILESTONE N="40"/> presumed to harbour and conceal the King's Person in his House,” without revealing,</Q> and making it known to the Parliament: which, no doubt, would have terrified them all in such a manner, that if he had been in truth amongst them, he would quickly have been disco∣ver'd, and given up. They caused some of the most notorious Presby∣terians Houses to be searched, as if they had been sure he had been there; and sent Posts to all Ports of the Kingdom, <Q>“that they might be shut, and no Person be suffer'd to embark, lest the King, in disguise,” transport himself;</Q> and a Proclamation was issued out, <Q>“for the ba∣nishing all Persons who had ever borne Armes for the King, out of” <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>London,</HI> or any place within twenty miles of it;</Q> and all Persons of that kind, who, upon strict search, were found, were apprehended, and put into several Prisons with all the circumstances of severity and
<PB N="66" REF="880"/>
rigour. But all these doubts were quickly clear'd, and, within two days, <HI>Cromwell</HI> inform'd the House of Commons, <Q>“that he had receiv'd Let∣ters from Colonel <HI>Hammond,</HI> of all the manner of the King's coming to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and the Company that came with him; that he remain'd there in the Castle of <HI>Carisbrooke,</HI> till the pleasure of the” Parliament should be known.</Q> <Q>He assured them, “that Colonel <HI>Ham∣mond</HI> was so honest a Man, and so much devoted to their Service, that they need have no jealousy that he might be corrupted by any” Body;</Q> and all this relation he made with so unusual a gaiety, that all Men concluded that the King was where He wished he should be. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>AND now the Parliament maintain'd no farther contests with the Army, but tamely submitted to whatsoever they proposed; the Pres∣byterians in both Houses, and in the City, being in a terrible Agony, that some close correspondences they had held with the King during his abode at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, would be discover'd; and therefore would give no farther occasion of jealousy by any contradictions, leaving it to their Clergy to keep the fire burning in the hearts of the People by their Pulpit-Inflamations; and they stoutly discharged their trust.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Cromwell</HI> had more cause to fear a fire in his own Quarters, and that he had raised a Spirit in the Army which would not easily be quieted <MILESTONE N="20"/> again. The Agitators, who were first form'd by him to oppose the Par∣liament, and to resist the destructive doom of their disbanding, and likewise to prevent any inconvenience, or mischief, that might result from the drowsy, dull Presbyterian humour of <HI>Fairfax;</HI> who wished nothing that <HI>Cromwell</HI> did, and yet contributed to bring it all to pass: These Agitators, had hitherto transcribed faithfully all the Copies he had given them, and offer'd such Advices to the Parliament, and insisted upon such expostulations and demands, as were necessary, whilst there was either any purpose to treat with the King or any reason to flatter his Party. But now the King was gone from the Army, and in such a <MILESTONE N="30"/> place as the Army could have no recourse to him, and that the Parlia∣ment was become of so soft a temper, that the Party of the Army that was in it, could make all necessary impression upon them, He desired to restrain the Agitators from that Liberty which they had so long en∣joyed, and to keep them within stricter Rules of obedience to their Su∣periors, and to hinder their future meetings, and consultations concern∣ing the settling the Government of the Kingdom; which, he thought, ought now to be solely left to the Parliament; whose Authority, for the present, he thought best to uphold, and by it to establish all that was to be done. But the Agitators would not be so dismiss'd from State Af∣fairs; <MILESTONE N="40"/> of which they had so pleasant a relish; nor be at the mercy of the Parliament, which they had so much provoked; and therefore, when they were admitted no more to consultations with their Officers, they continued their meetings without them; and thought there was as great need to reform their Officers, as any part of the Church or State. They enter'd into new Associations, and made many Propositions to their Of∣ficers, and to the Parliament, to introduce an equality into all condi∣tions, and a parity among all Men; from whence they had the Appel∣lation of <HI>Levellers;</HI> which appear'd a great Party. They did not only meet against the express Command of their Officers, but drew very con∣siderable <MILESTONE N="50"/> parties of the Army to Rendezvous, without the Order or Privity of their Superiors; and there perswaded them to enter into such Engagements, as would in a short time have dissolv'd the Government
<PB N="67" REF="890"/>
of the Army, and absolv'd them from a dependence upon their General Officers. The suppression of this Licence, put <HI>Cromwell</HI> to the expence of all his cunning, dexterity, and courage; so that after he had cajoled the Parliament, as if the preservation of Their Authority had been all he cared for and took to heart, and sent some salse Brothers to comply in the counsels of the Conspirators, by that means having notice of their Rendezvous, he was unexpectedly found with an ordinary Guard at those meetings; and, with a marvellous vivacity, having asked some Questions of those whom he observ'd most active, and receiving insolent Answers, he knocked two or three of them in the head with his own <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>suppresses a Tumult of the Levellers.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"/> hand, and then charged the rest with his Troop; and took such a num∣ber of them as he thought fit; whereof he presently caused some to be hanged, and sent others to <HI>London</HI> to a more formal Tryal. By two or three such encounters, for the obstinacy continued long, he totally sub∣dued that Spirit in the Army, though it continued and encreased very much in the Kingdom; and if it had not been encounter'd at that time with that rough and brisk temper of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> it would presently have produced all imaginable confusion in the Parliament, Army, and Kingdom.</P>
<P>ALL opposition being thus suppressed and quieted, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> needing no other assistance to the carrying on his designs, than the pre∣sent temper and inclination of the Parliament, they sent a Message to the King, briefly proposing to him, <Q>“that he would forthwith grant his” <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment sends a Message to the King to pass four Acts.</NOTE> Royal Assent to four Acts of Parliament,</Q> which they then sent to him. By one of them, he was to confess the War to have been raised by him against the Parliament; and so that he was guilty of all the Blood that had been spilt. By another, he was totally to dissolve the Government of the Church by Bishops, and to grant all the Lands belonging to the Church to such uses as they proposed; leaving the settling a future Go∣vernment in the place thereof to farther time and Counsels. By a third, <MILESTONE N="30"/> he was to grant, and settle the Militia in the Manner and in the Per∣sons proposed, reserving not so much power in himself as any Subject was capable of. In the last place, he was, in effect, to sacrifice all those who had serv'd, or adher'd to him, to the Mercy of the Parliament.</P>
<P>THE Persons who were sent with these four Bills, had liberty given to expect the King's Answer only four days, and were then required to return to the Parliament. With the Commissioners of Parliament there came likewise the Commissioners of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who, after the four Bills were deliver'd, and read to the King, the very next day, desired an Au∣dience; and, with much formality and confidence, deliver'd a Declara∣tion, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and Protestation on the behalf of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> against those Bills and Propositions. <Q>They said, “they were so prejudicial to Religion, the Crown, and the Union, and Interest of the Kingdoms, and so far different from the former proceedings and engagements be∣tween the two Kingdoms, that they could not concur therein; and therefore, in the name of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> did declare” their dissent.</Q> The King had receiv'd Advertisement, that assoon as he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commis¦sioners of</HI> Scotland <HI>enter a Protestation against them</HI></NOTE> should refuse to consent to the Bills, he should presently be made a close Prisoner, and all his Servants should be removed from him; upon which, and because the Commissioners had no power to treat with him, but <MILESTONE N="50"/> were only to receive his positive Answer, he resolv'd that his Answer should not be known till it was deliver'd to the Parliament; and that, in the mean time, he would endeavour to make his escape, before new
<PB N="68" REF="900"/>
Orders could be sent from <HI>Westminster:</HI> so when the Commissioners came to receive his Answer, he gave it to them sealed. The Earl of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King gives his An∣swer to the Parliament Commissioners.</NOTE> <HI>Denbigh,</HI> who was the chief of the Commissioners, and a Person very ungracious to the King, told him, <Q>“that though they had no Authority to treat with him, or to do any thing but to receive his Answer, yet they were not to be looked upon as Common Messengers, and to carry” back an Answer that they had not seen: and, upon the matter, refused to receive it;</Q> and said, <Q>“they would return without any, except they” might see what they carried.</Q></P>
<P>HIS Majesty conceiv'd that their return without his Answer would <MILESTONE N="10"/> be attended with the worst consequences; and therefore he told them, <Q>“that he had some reason for having offer'd to deliver it to them, in that manner; but if they would give him their words, that the communi∣cating it to them should be attended with no prejudice to him, he would” open it, and cause it to be read, which they readily undertook</Q> (as in truth they knew no reason to suspect it) and thereupon he open'd it, and gave it one to read. <Q>The Answer was, “that his Majesty had allways thought it a matter of great difficulty to comply in such a manner with all engaged Interests, that a firm and lasting Peace might ensue; in which opinion he was now confirm'd, since the Commissioners for <HI>Scot∣land</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> do solemnly protest against the several Bills, and Propositions, which the two Houses of Parliament had presented to him for his As∣sent; so that it was not possible for him to give such an Answer as” might be the foundation of a hopeful Peace.</Q> He gave them many un∣answerable reasons, <Q>“why he could not pass the four Bills as they were of∣fer'd to him; which did not only devest him of all Soveraignty, and leave him without any possibility of recovering it to him or his Suc∣cessors, but open'd a door for all intolerable oppressions upon his Sub∣jects, he granting such an arbitrary and illimited power to the two” Houses.</Q> He told them, <Q>“that neither the desire of being freed from that <MILESTONE N="30"/> tedious and irksome condition of Life, which he had so long suffer'd, nor the apprehension of any thing that might befal him, should ever prevail with him to consent to any one Act, till the conditions of the whole Peace should be concluded; and then that he would be ready to give all just and reasonable satisfaction, in all particulars; and for the adjusting of all this, he knew no way but a personal Treaty (and there∣fore very earnestly desired the two Houses to consent to it) to be either at” <HI>London,</HI> or any other place they would rather choose.</Q> Assoon as this Answer, or to the same effect, was read, he deliver'd it to the Commis∣sioners; who no sooner receiv'd it than they kiss'd his hand, and departed <MILESTONE N="40"/> for <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>THE Commissioners were no sooner gone than <HI>Hammond</HI> caused all <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Presently af∣ter,</HI> Ham∣mond <HI>re¦moves the King's old Servants from about him.</HI></NOTE> the King's Servants, who till then had all Liberty to be with him, to be immediately put out of the Castle; and forbid any of them to repair thi∣ther any more; and appointed a strong Guard to restrain any Body from going to the King, if they should endeavour it. This exceedingly troubled, and surprised him, being an absolute disappointment of all the hope he had left. <Q>He told <HI>Hammond,</HI> “that it was not suitable to his engage∣ment, and that it did not become a Man of honour or honesty to treat him so, who had so freely put himself into his hands. He asked him, <MILESTONE N="50"/> whether the Commissioners were acquainted with his purpose to pro∣ceed” in this manner?</Q> to which he Answer'd, <Q>“that they were not; but that he had an Order from the Parliament to do as he had done; and
<PB N="69" REF="910"/>
that he saw plainly by his Answer to the Propositions, that he acted” by other counsels than stood with the good of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THIS insolent and imperious proceeding, put the Island (which was generally inhabited by a People allways well affected to the Crown) into a high mutiny. <Q>They said, “they would not endure to see their King so” used, and made a Prisoner.</Q> There was at that time there one Captain <HI>Burly,</HI> who was of a good Family in the Island. He had been a Captain of one of the King's Ships, and was put out of his Command when the Fleet rebell'd against the King; and then he put himself into the King's Army, where he continued an Officer of good Account to the end of the <MILESTONE N="10"/> War, and was in one of the King's Armies General of the Ordnance. When the War was at an end, he repaired into his own Country, the Isle of <HI>Wight;</HI> where many of his Family still lived in good reputation. This Gentleman chanced to be at <HI>Newport,</HI> the Chief Town in the Island, when the King was thus treated, and when the People seem'd generally to resent it with so much indignation; and was so much transported <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thereupon Captain</HI> Burly <HI>stirs up the People in the Island; but is quickly sup∣press'd, con∣demn'd, and executed.</HI></NOTE> with the same fury, being a Man of more courage than of prudence and circumspection, that he caused a Drum to be presently beaten, and put himself at the head of the People who flocked together, and cryed <Q>“for” God, the King, and the People;</Q> and said, <Q>“he would lead them to the” <MILESTONE N="20"/> Castle, and rescue the King from his Captivity.</Q> The attempt was pre∣sently discern'd to be irrational, and impossible; and by the great dili∣gence, and activity of the King's Servants, who had been put out of the Castle, the People were quieted, and all Men resorted to their own Houses; but the poor Gentleman paid dear for his ill advised and precipitate Loyalty. For <HI>Hammond</HI> caused him presently to be made Prisoner; and the Parliament, without delay, sent down a Commission of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer;</HI> in which an infamous Judge, <HI>Wild,</HI> whom they had made Chief Baron of the Exchequer for such Services, presided; who caused poor <HI>Burly</HI> to be, with all formality, indicted of High Treason for Levy∣ing <MILESTONE N="30"/> War against the King, and engaging the Kingdom in a new War; of which the Jury they had brought together, found him guilty; upon which their Judge condemn'd him, and the honest Man was forthwith hanged, drawn, and quarter'd, with all the circumstances of barbarity and cruelty; which struck a wonderful terror into all Men, this being the first precedent of their having brought any Man to a formal Legal Trial by the Law to deprive him of his Life, and make him guilty of High Treason for adhering to the King; and it made a deeper impression upon the hearts of all Men, than all the cruelties they had yet exercised by their Courts of War; which, though they took away the Lives of many <MILESTONE N="40"/> innocent Men, left their Estates to their Wives and Children; but when they saw now, that they might be condemn'd of High Treason before a sworn Judge of the Law for serving the King, by which their Estates would be likewise confiscated, they thought they should be justified if they kept their Hearts entire, without being involved by their Actions in a Capital transgression.</P>
<P>UPON the receipt of the King's Answer, there appear'd a new spirit <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How the King's An∣swer is receiv'd by the Parlia∣ment; and</HI> Cromwell<HI>'s Speech of the King there∣upon.</HI></NOTE> and temper in the House of Commons; hitherto, no Man had mention'd the King's Person without duty and respect, and only lamented <Q>“that he was misled by evil and wicked Counsellors; who being removed from” <MILESTONE N="50"/> him, he might by the advice of his Parliament govern well enough.</Q> But now, upon the refusal to pass these Bills, every Man's mouth was open'd against him with the utmost sawciness, and licence; each man striving to

exceed the other in the impudence and bitterness of his Invective. <Q><HI>Crom∣well</HI> declared, “that the King was a Man of great parts, and great un∣derstanding”</Q> (faculties they had hitherto endeavour'd to have him thought to be without) <Q>“but that he was so great a dissembler, and so” false a Man, that he was not to be trusted.</Q> And thereupon, repeated many particulars, whilst he was in the Army, that his Majesty wish'd that such, and such things might be done, which being done to gratify him, he was displeased, and complain'd of it: <Q>“that whilst he professed with all solemnity that he referr'd himself wholely to the Parliament, and de∣pended only upon Their wisdom and counsel for the settlement and <MILESTONE N="10"/> composing the distractions of the Kingdom, he had, at the same time, secret Treaties with the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners, how he might imbroil the Nation in a new War, and destroy the Parliament. He concluded, that they might no farther trouble themselves with sending Messages to him, or farther Propositions, but that they might enter upon those counsels which were necessary towards the settlement of the Kingdom,” without having farther recourse to the King.</Q> Those of his Party se∣conded this advice with new reproaches upon the Person of the King charging him with such abominable Actions, as had been never heard <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and could be only suggested from the malice of their own hearts; whilst <MILESTONE N="20"/> Men who had any modesty, and abhorr'd that way of proceeding, stood amazed and confounded at the manner and presumption of it, and with∣out courage to give any notable opposition to their rage. So that, after several days spent in passionate debates to this purpose, they Voted <Q>“that they would make no more Addresses to the King, but proceed towards <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vote of no more Ad∣dresses to the King</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> settling the Government, and providing for the Peace of the Kingdom, in such manner as they should judge best for the benefit and liberty of” the Subject: and a Committee was appointed to prepare a Declaration to inform and satisfy the People of this their resolution,</Q> and the grounds thereof, and to assure them, <Q>“that they had Lawful Authority to pro∣ceed” <MILESTONE N="30"/> in this manner.</Q> In the mean time, the King, who had, from the time of his coming to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> enjoyed the liberty of taking the Air, and refreshing himself throughout the Island, and was attended by such Servants as he had appointed, or sent for, to come thither to him, to the time that he had refused to pass those Bills, from thenceforth was no more suffer'd to go out of the Castle beyond a little ill Garden that be∣longed to it. And now, after this Vote of the House of Commons, that there should be no more Addresses made to him, all his Servants being removed, a few new Men, for the most part, unknown to his Majesty, were deputed to be about his Person to perform all those Offices which <MILESTONE N="40"/> they believ'd might be requisite, and of whose fidelity to themselves they were as well assured, as that they were without any reverence or af∣fection for the King.</P>
<P>IT is very true, that within few days after the King's withdrawing from <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and after it was known that he was in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> there was a meeting of the General Officers of the Army at <HI>Wind∣sor;</HI> where <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton</HI> were present, to consult what should <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A meeting of</HI> Cromwell <HI>and the Offi∣cers at</HI> Wind∣sor, <HI>wherein they design the King's Destruction.</HI></NOTE> be now done with the King. For, though <HI>Cromwell</HI> was weary of the Agitators, and resolv'd to break their meetings, and though the Parlia∣ment concurr'd in all he desired, yet his entire confidence was in the Of∣ficers <MILESTONE N="50"/> of the Army; who were they who swayed the Parliament, and the Army it self, to bring what he intended to pass. At this conference, the preliminaries whereof were allways Fastings and Prayers, made at the very
<PB N="71" REF="930"/>
Council by <HI>Cromwell</HI> or <HI>Ireton,</HI> or some other <HI>inspired</HI> Person, as most of the Officers were, it was resolv'd <Q>“that the King should be prosecuted” for his Life as a criminal Person: of which his Majesty was advertised speedily by <HI>Watson,</HI></Q> Quarter Master General of the Army; who was pre∣sent; and had pretended, from the first coming of the King to the Army, to have a desire to serve him, and desired to be now thought to retain it; but the resolution was a great secret, of which the Parliament had not the least intimation, or jealousy; but was, as it had been, to be cozen'd by degrees to do what they never intended. Nor was his Majesty easily perswaded to give credit to the information; but though he expected, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and thought it very probable, that they would Murther him, he did not believe they would attempt it with that formality, or let the People know their Intentions. The great approach they made towards it, was, their Declaration <Q>“”that they would make no more Addresses to the King, that by an Interregnum they might feel the pulse of the People, and dis∣cover how they would submit to another form of Government;</Q> and yet all Writs, and Process of Justice, and all Commissions, still issued in the King's Name without his consent or privity; and little other change or alteration, but that what was before done by the King himself, and by his immediate Order, was now perform'd by the Parliament; and, instead <MILESTONE N="20"/> of Acts of Parliament, they made Ordinances of the two Houses to serve all their occasions; which found the same obedience from the People.</P>
<P>THIS Declaration of no more Addresses, contain'd a charge against <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vote of no more Ad¦dresses second∣ed by a Decla∣ration.</NOTE> the King of whatsoever had been done amiss from the beginning of his Government, or before, not without a direct Insinuation, as if <Q>“He had conspired with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> against the life of his Father; the prejudice he had brought upon the Protestant Religion in forreign parts, by lending his Ships to the King of <HI>France,</HI> who imployed them” against <HI>Rochel:</HI> they renew'd the remembrance,</Q> and reproach of all those grievances which had been mention'd in their first Remonstrance of the <MILESTONE N="30"/> State of the Kingdom, and repeated all the calumnies which had been contain'd in all their Declarations before and after the War; which had been all so fully Answer'd by his Majesty, that the world was convinced of their Rebellion and Treason: they charged him with being <Q>“the cause of all the blood that had been spilt, by his having made a War upon his Parliament, and rejecting all Overtures of Peace which had been made to him; and in regard of all these things, they resolv'd to make no more Address to him, but, by their own Authority, to provide for” the Peace and Welfare of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Declaration found much opposition in the House of Commons, <MILESTONE N="40"/> in respect of the particular reproaches they had now cast upon the Person of the King, which they had heretofore, in their own published Declara∣tions to the People, charged upon the evil Counsellors, and Persons about him; and some Persons had been sentenced, and condemn'd, for those very crimes which they now accused his Majesty of. But there was much more exception to their conclusion from those premises, that therefore they would address themselves no more to him; and <HI>John Maynard,</HI> a Member of the House, and a Lawyer of great eminence, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Maynard<HI>'s Argument a∣gainst it</HI></NOTE> who had too much complied and concurred with their irregular, and unjust proceedings, after he had with great vehemence opposed, and con∣tradicted <MILESTONE N="50"/> the most odious Parts of their Declaration, told them plainly, <Q>“that by this resolution of making no more Addresses to the King, they did, as far as in Them lay, dissolve the Parliament; and that, from the
<PB N="72" REF="940"/>
time of that determination, he knew not with what security, in point of Law, they could meet together, or any Man joyn with them in their counsels: That it was of the Essence of Parliament, that they should upon all occasions repair to the King; and that his Majesties refusal at any time to receive their Petitions, or to admit their Addresses, had been allways held the highest breach of their Privilege, because it tended to their dissolution without dissolving them; and therefore if they should now, on their parts, determine that they would receive no more Messages from him (which was likewise a part of their Declaration) nor make any more address to him, they did, upon the matter, declare <MILESTONE N="10"/> that they were no longer a Parliament; and then, how could the Peo∣ple” look upon them as such?</Q> This Argumentation being boldly press'd by a Man of that Learning and Authority, who had very seldom not been believ'd, made a great impression upon all Men who had not pro∣stituted themselves to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Party. But the other side meant not to maintain their resolution by discourses, well knowing where their strength lay; and so still called for the Question; which was carried by a plurality of Voices, as they foresaw it would; very many Persons who abhorr'd the determination, not having Courage to provoke the powerful Men by owning their dissent; others, satisfying themselves <MILESTONE N="20"/> with the resolution to withdraw themselves, and to bear no farther part in the counsels; which <HI>Maynard</HI> himself did; and came no more to the House in very many Months, nor till there seem'd to be such an al∣teration in the minds of Men, that there would be a reversal of that monstrous determination; and many others did the same.</P>
<P>WHEN this Declaration was thus passed the Commons, and by them sent to the House of Peers for their concurrence, the Manner or the Mat∣ter was of that importance as to need much debate; but, with as little formality as was possible, it had the concurrence of that House, and was immediately printed, and published, and new Orders sent to the Isle of <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Wight,</HI> for the more strict looking to, and guarding the King, that he might not escape.</P>
<P>THE publishing this Declaration wrought very different effects in the minds of the People, from what they expected it would produce; and it appear'd to be so publickly detested, that many who had serv'd the Par∣liament in several unwarrantable Imployments and Commissions, from the beginning of the War, in the City and in the Country, withdrew them∣selves from the Service of the Parliament; and much inveighed against it, for declining all the Principles upon which they had engaged them. Many private Persons took upon them to publish Answers to that De∣claration, <MILESTONE N="40"/> that, the King himself being under so strict a restraint that he could make no Answer, the People might not be poyson'd with the belief of it. And the several Answers of this kind wrought very much upon the People, who open'd their Mouths very loud against the Parliament and the Army; and the clamour was encreased by the increase of Taxes, and Impositions, which were raised by new Ordinances of Parliament upon the Kingdom; and though they were so entirely possessed of the whole Kingdom, and the Forces and Garrisons thereof, that they had no Ene∣my to fear or apprehend, yet they disbanded no part of their Army; and notwithstanding they raised incredible Sums of Money, upon the Sale <MILESTONE N="50"/> of the Church and the Crown Lands; for which they sound Purchasers enough amongst their own Party in the City, Army, and Country, and upon composition with Delinquents, and the sale of their Lands who
<PB N="73" REF="950"/>
refused, or could not be admitted to compound (which few refused to do who could be admitted, in regard that their Estates were all under Se∣questration, and the Rents thereof paid to the Parliament, so that till they compounded they had nothing to support themselves, whereby they were driven into extreme wants and necessities, and were compelled to make their Compositions, at how unreasonable rates soever, that they might thereby be enabled to sell some part, to preserve the rest, and their Houses from being pulled down, and their Woods from being wasted or spoiled) Notwithstanding all these vast receipts, which they ever pretended should ease the People of their Burthen, and should suffice to pay the Army their <MILESTONE N="10"/> expences at Sea, and Land, their debts were so great, that they raised the publick Taxes; and, besides all Customs, and Excise, they Levied a Monthly Contribution of above a hundred thousand pounds by a Land Tax throughout the Kingdom; which was more than had been ever done before, and it being at a time when they had no Enemy who contended with them, was an Evidence that it would have no end, and that the Ar∣my was still to be kept up, to make good the resolution they had taken, to have no more to do with the King; and that made the resolution gene∣rally the more odious. All this grew the more insupportable, by reason that upon the publishing this last monstrous Declaration, most of those <MILESTONE N="20"/> Persons of condition, who, as hath been said before, had been seduced to do them Service throughout the Kingdom, declined to appear longer in so detestable an imployment; and now a more inferior sort of the com∣mon People succeeded in those imployments, who thereby exercised so great insolence over those who were in Quality above them, and who all∣ways had a power over them, that it was very grievous; and for this, let the circumstances be what they would, no redress could be ever obtain'd, all distinction of Quality being renounced. They who were not above the condition of ordinary inferior Constables, six or seven years before, were now the Justices of Peace, and Sequestrators, and Commissioners; who <MILESTONE N="30"/> executed the Commands of the Parliament, in all the Counties of the Kingdom, with such rigour and Tyranny, as was natural for such Persons to use over and towards those upon whom they had formerly looked at such a distance. But let their sufferings be never so great, and the mur∣mur and discontent never so general, there was no shadow of hope by which they might discern any possible relief: so that they who had strug∣gled as long as they were able, submitted patiently to the Yoke, with the more satisfaction, in that they saw many of those who had been the prin∣cipal Contrivers of all the mischiefs to satisfy their own Ambition, and that they might govern others, reduced to allmost as ill a condition as <MILESTONE N="40"/> themselves, at least to as little Power, and Authority, and Security; whilst the whole Government of the Nation remain'd, upon the matter, wholely in Their hands who in the beginning of the Parliament were scarce ever heard of, or their names known but in the places where they inhabited.</P>
<P>THE King being in this melancholick neglected Condition, and the Kingdom possessed by the new Rulers, without controul, in the new me∣thod of Government, where every thing was done, and submitted to, which they propounded, they yet found that there was no foundation laid for their Peace, and future Security; that besides the general discontent of the Nation, which for the present they did not fear, they were to ex∣pect <MILESTONE N="50"/> new Troubles from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from <HI>Scotland;</HI> which would, in the Progress, have an influence upon <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>Ireland</HI> (which they had totally neglected from the time of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> Ireland</NOTE>
<PB N="74" REF="960"/>
differences and contests between the Parliament and the Army, and from the King's being in the Army) though they were possessed of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and, upon the matter, of the whole Province of <HI>Munster,</HI> by the activity of the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Broghill;</HI> yet the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebels had very great Forces, which cover'd all the other parts of the Kingdom. But they had no kind of fears of the <HI>Irish,</HI> whom they vanquished as often as they saw, and never declined fighting upon any inequality of Number: they had an apprehension of another Enemy. The Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had often attended the King at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and had great resort to him, whilst he stayed in <HI>London,</HI> by all those who had serv'd the King, and not <MILESTONE N="10"/> less by those who were known to be unsatisfied with the proceedings both of the Parliament and the Army; and by the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners, who had frequently private meetings with him; insomuch as the Officers of the Army, who gave the first motion to all extravagant Acts of power, had resolv'd to have apprehended and imprison'd him, as a Man worthy of their fear, though they had nothing to charge him with; and by his Articles, he had liberty to stay six Months where he would in <HI>England</HI> (which time was little more than half expired) and then he might trans∣port himself into what part he desired beyond the Seas. The Marquis had notice of this their purpose; and having conferr'd with his Majesty <MILESTONE N="20"/> as much as was necessary, upon a reasonable foresight of what was like to fall out, shortly after, or about the time that the King left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, he in disguise, and without being attended by more than one Ser∣vant, rid into <HI>Sussex;</HI> and in an obscure and unguarded Port or Harbour, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>transports himself out of</HI> England <HI>into</HI> France.</NOTE> put himself on board a Shallop, which safely transported him into <HI>Nor∣mandy;</HI> from whence he waited upon the Queen, and the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> at <HI>Paris;</HI> to whom he could not but be very welcome.</P>
<P>AT the same time, there were Commissioners arriv'd from <HI>Ireland</HI> from the Confederate Roman Catholicks; who, after they had driven the King's Authority from them, quickly found they needed it for their <MILESTONE N="30"/> own preservation. The Factions grew so great amongst the <HI>Irish</HI> them∣selves, and the Pope's Nuntio exercised his Authority with so great Ty∣ranny and Insolence, that all were weary of him; and found that the Par∣liament, assoon as they should send more Forces over, would easily, by reason of their divisions, reduce them into great streights, and necessities. They therefore sent Commissioners to the Queen and Prince to desire, <Q>“that by their favour, they might have the King's Authority again among” them;</Q> to which they promised, for the future, a ready obedience, with many acknowledgements of their former miscarriage and ill behaviour. It is very true that the Marquis of <HI>Antrim,</HI> who was one of the Commis∣sioners, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and was allways inseparable from the highest Ambition (though without any Qualifications for any great trust) had entertain'd the hope, that by the Queen's favour, who had too good an opinion of him, the Go∣vernment of <HI>Ireland</HI> should be committed to Him, and his conduct; which none of the other Commissioners thought of, nor had their Eyes fixed on any Man but the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> in whom the King's Au∣thority was vested; for he remain'd still Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland</HI> by the King's Commission; and they had reason to believe that all the <HI>English</HI> Protestants, who had formerly liv'd under his Government (without a conjunction with whom, they well foresaw the <HI>Irish</HI> would not be able to <MILESTONE N="50"/> defend or preserve themselves) would return to the same obedience, as∣soon as he should return to receive it. The Queen and the Prince thought not of trusting any other in that most hazardous and difficult Imploy∣ment,
<PB N="75" REF="970"/>
and so referr'd the Commissioners to make all their Overtures, and Propositions to him; who knew well enough, what they would not do if they could, and what they could not do if they had a mind to it; and how devoted soever he was to the King's Service, nothing proposed or undertaken by them, could have been the least inducement to him to engage himself, and to depend upon their fidelity. But there were three things, which with the great and entire Zeal for the King's Service, to which he had dedicated himself, made him believe that he might with some success appear again in that Kingdom, in this conjuncture; and that his so doing, might have a good effect upon the temper of <HI>England</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> towards the mending his Majesties condition there.</P>
<P>FIRST, the Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> (who then absolutely govern'd <HI>France)</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Reasons that moved the Marquis to go again into</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> seem'd very earnestly to advise it, and promised to supply him with a good Sum of Money, and store of Armes and Ammunition to carry with him; which he knew very well how to dispose of there. Secondly, he was privy to the <HI>Scots</HI> Engagement, and to a resolution of many Persons of great Honour in <HI>England,</HI> to appear in Armes at the same time; which was design'd for the Summer following; whereby the Parliament, and Army, which were like to have new divisions amongst themselves, would not be able to send any considerable Supplies into <HI>Ireland;</HI> without <MILESTONE N="20"/> which, their power there, was not like to be formidable. Thirdly, which was a greater Encouragement than the other two, he had, during his abode in <HI>England,</HI> held a close correspondence with the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> President of the Province of <HI>Munster</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who had the full Power and Command of all the <HI>English</HI> Army there; which was a better Body of Men than the Parliament had in any other part of that Kingdom. That Lord was weary of his Masters, and did not think the Service he had done the Parliament (which indeed had been very great, and without which it is very probable that whole Kingdom had been united to his Majesties Service) well requited; and did really and heartily abhor the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Proceedings of the Parliament, and Army, towards the King; and did therefore resolve to redeem what he had formerly done amiss, with ex∣posing all he had for his Majesties Restoration; and had frankly promised the Marquis to receive him into <HI>Munster,</HI> as the King's Lieutenant of that Kingdom; and that that whole Province, and Army, should pay him all obedience; and that against the time he should be sure of his presence, he would make a Cessation with the <HI>Irish</HI> in Order to a firm conjunction of that whole Kingdom for the King. After the Marquis came into <HI>France,</HI> he receiv'd still Letters from that Lord to hasten his Journey thither.</P>
<P>THESE were the motives which disposed the Marquis to comply with <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Queen's, and the Prince's Command to prepare himself for that Ex∣pedition; and so he concerted all things with the <HI>Irish</HI> Commissioners; who return'd into their Country, with promises to dispose their General Assembly to consent to those conditions as might not bring a greater pre∣judice to the King, than any conjunction with them could be of Ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>THE Parliament had too many Spies, and Agents at <HI>Paris,</HI> not to be inform'd of whatsoever was whisper'd there; but whether they underva∣lued any conjunction with the <HI>Irish</HI> (for of the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> they had no suspicion) or were confident of the Cardinal's kindness, that he would <MILESTONE N="50"/> not advance any design against them, they were not so apprehensive of trouble from <HI>Ireland</HI> as they were of their Brethren from <HI>Scotland;</HI> where they heard of great preparations, and of a purpose to call a Parlia∣ment,
<PB N="76" REF="980"/>
and to raise an Army; which, they believ'd, would find too many Friends in <HI>England,</HI> the Presbyterian Party holding up their heads again, both in the Parliament, and the City. Besides, they knew that some Per∣sons of Quality and Interest, who had serv'd the King in good Command in the late War, were gone into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and well receiv'd there; which, they thought, would draw the King's Party together upon the first ap∣pearance.</P>
<P>AFTER the King had been so infamously deliver'd up to the Parlia∣ment by the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and assoon as the Army had possessed themselves of him, that Nation was in terrible Apprehension that the Of∣ficers <MILESTONE N="10"/> of the Army would have made their Peace, and established their own greatness by restoring the King to his just Rights, of which they had so fouly depriv'd him; and then the conscience of their guilt made them presume, what Their Lot must be; and therefore, the same Commissioners who had been joyn'd with the Committee of Parliament in all the trans∣actions, made hast to <HI>Westminster</HI> again to their old Seats, to keep their Interest; which was great in all the Presbyterian Party, both of Parlia∣ment and City; for there remain'd still the same profession of maintain∣ing the strict Union between the two Kingdoms, and that all Transactions should be by joynt Counsels. And assoon as the King appear'd with some <MILESTONE N="20"/> shew of Liberty, and his own Servants had leave to attend him, no Men appear'd with more confidence than the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners; the Earl of <HI>Lowden,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and the rest; as if they had been the Men who had contriv'd his Restoration: No Men in so frequent Whispers with the King; and they found some way to get themselves so much believ'd by the Queen, with whom they held a diligent Correspon∣dence, that her Majesty very earnestly perswaded the King <Q>“to trust them, as the only Persons who had power and credit to do him Service, and to” redeem him from the captivity he was in. Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who had been sent Prisoner by the King to the Castle of <HI>Pendennis,</HI></Q> and had been deli∣ver'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> from thence by the Army, when that place was taken in the end of the War, had enjoyed his Liberty at <HI>London,</HI> and in his own House at <HI>Chelsey,</HI> as long as he thought fit, that is, near as long as the King was with the <HI>Scots</HI> Army and at <HI>New-Castle;</HI> and some time before his Ma∣jesty was deliver'd up to the Parliament Commissioners, he went into <HI>Scotland</HI> to his own House at <HI>Hamilton;</HI> looked upon by that Nation as <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke</HI> Hamil∣ton <HI>goes into</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> one who had unjustly suffer'd under the King's Jealousy, and displeasure, and who remain'd still very faithful to him; and during the time that he remain'd in and about <HI>London,</HI> he found means to converse with many of the King's Party, and made great professions that he would do the <MILESTONE N="40"/> King a very signal Service, which he desired them to assure his Majesty of; and seem'd exceedingly troubled and ashamed at his Country Men's giving up the King. His having no share in that infamy made him the more trusted in <HI>England,</HI> and to be receiv'd with the more respect in <HI>Scotland</HI> by all those who abhorr'd that Transaction.</P>
<P><Q>THE Commissioners who attended his Majesty, made great Apologies for what had been done, imputing it wholely to the “malice and power of the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and to his Credit, and Authority in the Council, and in the Army; so that nothing could be done which was desired by honest Men; but that now Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> was amongst them, who <MILESTONE N="50"/> they knew was most devoted to his Majesty, they should be able to over power <HI>Argyle;</HI> and the proceedings of the Army and the Parliament, were so foul, and so contrary to their publick Faith, that they were
<PB N="77" REF="990"/>
confident that all <HI>Scotland</HI> would rise as one Man for his Majesties de∣fence and vindication; and they were well assured, there would such a Party in <HI>England</HI> of those who were faithful to his Majesty, appear at the same time, that there would be little Question of being able, be∣tween them, to be hard enough for that part of the Army that would” oppose them;</Q> which his Majesty knew well was resolv'd by many Per∣sons of Honour, who afterwards perform'd what they had promised.</P>
<P>WHEN the Commissioners had, by these Insinuations, gain'd new cre∣dit with the King, and had undertaken, that their invading <HI>England</HI> with an Army equal to the undertaking, should be the foundation upon which <MILESTONE N="10"/> all other hopes were to depend (for no attempt in <HI>England</HI> could be rea∣sonable before such an Invasion, which was likewise to be hasten'd, that it might be at the same time when the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> should ap∣pear in <HI>Ireland)</HI> they begun to propose to him many conditions, which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commis∣sioners of</HI> Scotland<HI>'s private Trea∣ty with the King at</HI> Ham∣pton <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> would be necessary for his Majesty to engage himself to perform towards that Nation; without which it would not be easy to induce it into so unanimous a consent and engagement, as was necessary for such an enter∣prise. They required, as a thing without which nothing was to be under∣taken, <Q>“that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> should be present with them, and march in the head of their Army; and desired that advertisement, and order, <MILESTONE N="20"/> might be sent to that purpose to the Queen, and the Prince, at <HI>Paris;</HI> that so his Highness might be ready for the Voyage, assoon as they” should be prepared to receive him.</Q> The King would by no means con∣sent that the Prince should go into <HI>Scotland,</HI> being too well acquainted with the manners and fidelity of that Party there; but he was contented, that when they should have enter'd <HI>England</HI> with their Army, then the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> should put himself in the head of them. <Q>They demanded, “that such a Number of <HI>Scots-</HI>men should be allways in the Court, of the Bed-Chamber, and all other places about the Persons of the King, and Prince, and Duke of <HI>York:</HI> that <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Carlisle,</HI> should be put into” <MILESTONE N="30"/> the hands of the <HI>Scots;</HI></Q> and some other concessions with reference to the Northern Counties; which trenched so far upon the Honour and In∣terest of the <HI>English,</HI> that his Majesty utterly refused to consent to it; and so the Agreement was not concluded when the King left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court. But, assoon as he was at the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners re∣paired to him, at the same time with those who were sent to him from the Parliament for his Royal Assent to those four Bills spoken of before; then, in that season of despair, they prevailed with him to Sign the Proposi∣tions <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which Treaty was renew'd; and He Sign'd it at the Isle of</HI> Wight.</NOTE> he had formerly refused; and, having great apprehension from the Jealousies they knew the Army had of them, that they should be seised <MILESTONE N="40"/> upon, and searched in their return to <HI>London,</HI> they made up their pre∣cious Contract in Lead, and buried it in a Garden in the Isle of <HI>Wight;</HI> from whence they easily found means afterwards to receive it. So con∣stant were those Men to their Principles, and so wary to be sure to be no losers by returning to their Allegiance; to which neither Conscience nor Honour did invite or dispose them. So after a stay of some Months at <HI>London</HI> to adjust all Accounts, and receive the remainder of those Monies they had so dearly earned, or so much of it as they had hope would be paid, they return'd to <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the hatred and contempt of the Army, and the Parliament, that was then govern'd by it; but <MILESTONE N="50"/> with the veneration of the Presbyterian Party, which still had saith in them, and exceedingly depended upon their future Negotiation; which was now incumbent upon them: and in order thereunto, a fast inter∣course
<PB N="78" REF="1000"/>
and correspondence was settled, as well by constant Letters, as by frequent Emissaries of their Clergy, or other Persons, whose devo∣tion to their Combination was unquestionable.</P>
<P>IT can never be enough wonder'd at that the <HI>Scotish</HI> Presbyterians, being a watchful and crafty People, the principal of whom were as un∣restrain'd by Conscience as any of the Officers of the Army were, and only intended their particular advantage and ambition, should yet hope to carry on their Interest by such conditions, and limitations, as all wise Men saw must absolutely ruin and destroy it. They knew well enough the Spirit of their own People, and that though it would be no hard <MILESTONE N="10"/> matter to draw a numerous Army enough together, yet that being to∣gether it would be able to do very little towards any vigorous attempt; and therefore their chief dependence was upon the Assistance they should find ready to joyn with them in <HI>England.</HI> It is true, they did believe the Body of the Presbyterians in <HI>England</HI> to be much more considerable than in truth it was; yet they did, or might have known, that the most con∣siderable Persons who in the contest with the other Faction were content to be thought Presbyterians, were so only as they thought it might restore the King; which they more impatiently desired, than any alteration in the Government of the Church; and that they did heartily intend a con∣junction <MILESTONE N="20"/> with all the Royal Party, upon whose Interest, Conduct, and Courage, they did more rely than upon the power of the <HI>Scots;</HI> who did publickly profess that all the King's Friends should be most welcome, and receiv'd by them; nor did they trust any one Presbyterian in <HI>England</HI> with the knowledge of the Particulars contain'd in the Agreement with the King; but concealed it between the three Persons who transacted it; and if it had been known, <HI>Cromwell</HI> might as easily have overrun the Country before their Army invaded <HI>England,</HI> as he did afterwards; nor would one <HI>English</HI> Man have joyn'd with them. Besides the infamous circumstances by which they extorted Concessions from the King, which <MILESTONE N="30"/> would have render'd any Contract odious (it being made in those four days, which were all that were assign'd both to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners, so that his Majesty had not only no time to advise with others, but could not advise with Himself upon so many monstrous par∣ticulars as were demanded of him by both Kingdoms; which if he could have done, he would no more Then have submitted to them, than he did afterwards upon long deliberation, and when his life appear'd to be in more manifest danger by his refusal) the particulars themselves were the most scandalous, and derogatory to the honour and interest of the <HI>English</HI> Nation; and would have been abominated, if known and understood, by <MILESTONE N="40"/> all Men, with all possible indignation.</P>
<P>AFTER they had made his Majesty give a good Testimony of their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The substance of the Treaty Sign'd the</HI> 26 <HI>of Dec.</HI> 1647.</NOTE> League and Covenant, in the preface of their Agreement, and <Q>“that the Intentions of those who had enter'd into it, were real for the preserva∣tion of his Majesties Person and Authority, according to their Alle∣giance,”</Q> and no ways to diminish his just power and greatness, they obliged him <Q>“assoon as he could, with freedom, honour, and safety, be present in a free Parliament, to confirm the said League and Covenant by Act of Parliament in both Kingdoms, for the security of all who had” taken, or should take it.</Q> It is true, they admitted a Proviso, <Q>“that none” <MILESTONE N="50"/> who was unwilling, should be constrain'd to take it.</Q> They likewise obliged his Majesty <Q>“to confirm, by Act of Parliament, in <HI>England,</HI> Pres∣byterian Government; the Directory for worship; and the Assembly
<PB N="79" REF="1010"/>
of Divines at <HI>Westminster,</HI> for three years; so that his Majesty, and his Household, should not be hinder'd from using that form of Divine Ser∣vice he had formerly practiced; and that during those three years there should be a consultation with the Assembly of Divines, to which twenty of the King's nomination should be added, and some from the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and thereupon it should be determin'd by his Majesty, and the two Houses of Parliament, what form of Government should be established after the expiration of those years, as should be most agreeable to the word of God: that an effectual course should be taken by Act of Parliament, and all other ways needful or expedient, for the <MILESTONE N="10"/> suppressing the opinions and practices of Anti-Trinitarians, Arians, Socinians, Anti-Scripurists, Anabaptists, Antinomians, Arminians, Fa∣mylists, Brownists, Separatists, Independents, Libertines, and Seekers, and, generally, for the suppressing all Blasphemy, Heresy, Schism, and all such scandalous Doctrines and Practices as are contrary to the light of Nature, and to the known Principles of Christianity, whether con∣cerning Faith, Worship, or Conversation, or the power of Godliness, or which may be destructive to order and government, or to the peace of” the Church or Kingdom.</Q> <Q>The King promised, “that in the next Session of Parliament, after the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> should declare for his <MILESTONE N="20"/> Majesty, in pursuance of this Agreement, he should in Person, or by Commission, confirm the League and Covenant in that Kingdom; and” concerning all the Acts passed in the last Parliament of that Kingdom,</Q> his Majesty declared, <Q>“that he should then likewise be content to give assurance by Act of Parliament, that neither He, nor his Successors, should quarrel, call in question, or command the contrary of any of” them, nor question any for giving obedience to the same.</Q> Then they made a long recital of <Q>“the agreement the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> had made, when the <HI>Scots</HI> Army return'd to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the Army under <HI>Fairfax</HI> should be disbanded; and of that Army's submitting thereunto; <MILESTONE N="30"/> of their taking the King from <HI>Holmby,</HI> and keeping him Prisoner till he fled from them to the Isle of <HI>Wight;</HI> and since that time both his Ma∣jesty, and the Commissioners for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> had very earnestly desired that the King might come to <HI>London,</HI> in safety, honour, and freedom, for a Personal Treaty with the two Houses and the Com∣missioners of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> which, they said, had been granted, but that the Army had, in violent manner, forced away divers Members of the Parliament from the discharge of their trust, and pos∣sessed themselves of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and all the strengths, and Garri∣sons of the Kingdoms: And that by the strength, and influence of that <MILESTONE N="40"/> Army, and their adherents, Propositions and Bills had been sent to the King without the advice and consent of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> con∣trary to the Treaties which are between the two Kingdoms, and de∣structive to Religion, his Majesties just Rights, the Privileges of Parlia∣ment, and Liberty of the Subject; from which Propositions, and Bills, the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners had dissented, and protested against, in the” name of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AFTER this preamble, and recital, they said, <Q>“that forasmuch as his Majesty is willing to give satisfaction concerning the settling Religion, and other matters in difference, as is exprest in this agreement, the King∣dom <MILESTONE N="50"/> of <HI>Scotland</HI> doth oblige and engage it self, first, in a peaceable way and manner to endeavour that the King may come to <HI>London</HI> in safety, honour, and freedom, for a Personal Treaty with the Houses of Par∣liament
<PB N="80" REF="1020"/>
and the Commissioners of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon such Propositions as should be mutually agreed on between the Kingdoms, and such Propo∣sitions as his Majesty should think fit to make; and for this end all Ar∣mies should be disbanded; and in case that this should not be granted, that Declarations should be emitted by the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> in pur∣suance of this agreement, against the unjust proceedings of the two Houses of Parliament towards his Majesty and the Kingdom of <HI>Scot∣land;</HI> in which they would assert the Right that belonged to the Crown, in the power of the Militia, the Great Seal, bestowing of Honours and Offices of trust, choice of the Privy Counsellors, and the Right of the <MILESTONE N="10"/> King's Negative Voice in Parliament: And that the Queen's Majesty, the Prince, and the rest of the Royal Issue, ought to remain where his Majesty shall think fit in either of his Kingdoms, with safety, honour, and freedom: That, upon the issuing out this Declaration, an Army should be sent out of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> for the preservation, and establishment of Religion; for defence of his Majesties Person, and Au∣thority, and restoring him to his Government, to the just Rights of the Crown, and his full Revenues; for defence of the Privileges of Parlia∣ment, and Liberties of the Subject; for making a firm Union between the Kingdoms under his Majesty, and his Posterity, and settling a lasting” <MILESTONE N="20"/> Peace.</Q> In pursuance whereof, the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> was to endea∣vour <Q>“that there might be a free and full Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> and that his Majesty may be with them in honour, safety, and freedom; and that a speedy period be set to the present Parliament. And they undertook, that the Army which they would raise, should be upon its march, before” the Message and Declaration should be deliver'd to the Houses.</Q> It was farther agreed, <Q>“that all such in the Kingdoms of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> as would joyn with the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> in pursuance of this Agree∣ment, should be protected by his Majesty in their Persons, and Estates; and that all his Majesties Subjects in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> who would <MILESTONE N="30"/> joyn with him, in pursuance of this Agreement, might come to the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, and joyn with them, or else put themselves into other Bodies in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Wales,</HI> for prosecution of the same ends, as the King's Ma∣jesty should judge most convenient, and under such Commanders, or Generals of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, as his Majesty should think fit: And that all such should be protected by the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Army, in their Persons and Estates; and where any injury or wrong is done unto them, they would be careful to see them fully repaired, as far as it should be in their power to do; and likewise when any injury or wrong is done to those who joyn with the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> his” <MILESTONE N="40"/> Majesty shall be careful of their full reparation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEY obliged his Majesty to promise “that neither himself, nor any by his Authority or Knowledge, should make or admit of any Cessation, Pacification, or Agreement whatsoever for Peace, nor of any Treaty, Propositions, Bills, or any other ways for that end, with the Houses of Parliament, or any Army or Party in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> without the advice and consent of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and, reciprocally, that neither the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor any having their Authority, should make or admit of any of these any manner of way, with any whatsoever, without his Majesties advice or consent: And that, upon the settlement <MILESTONE N="50"/> of a Peace, there should be an Act of Oblivion to be agreed on by his Majesty, and both his Parliaments of both Kingdoms: That his Majesty, the Prince, or both, should come into <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the invitation of
<PB N="81" REF="1050"/>
that Kingdom, and their Declaration, that they should be in honour, freedom, and safety, when possibly they could come with safety, and convenience; and that the King should contribute his utmost endea∣vour, both at home and abroad, for assisting the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> for carrying on this War by Sea and Land, and for their Supplies by Monies, Armes, Ammunition, and all other things requisite, as also for guarding the Coasts of <HI>Scotland</HI> with Ships, and protecting all their Merchants in the free exercise of their Trade and Commerce with other Nations: and likewise that his Majesty was willing, and did authorize the <HI>Scots</HI> Army to possess themselves of <HI>Berwick, Carlisle, New-Castle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> with the Castle of <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> and the Town of <HI>Hartlepool:</HI> those places to be for retreat, and Magazines; and that, when the Peace of the King∣dom should be settled, the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> should remove their” Forces, and deliver back again those Towns and Castles.</Q></P>
<P>AND as if all this had not been recompence enough for the wonderful Service they were like to perform, they obliged the King to promise and undertake to pay, the remainder of that Brotherly Assistance which was yet unpaid upon the large Treaty after their first invasion of <HI>England,</HI> and likewise two hundred thousand pounds, which remain'd still due upon the last Treaty made with the Houses of Parliament for return of the <HI>Scots</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> Army, when they had deliver'd up the King; and also, <Q>“that payment should be made to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the charge, and expence of their Army in this future War, with due recompence for the losses which they should sustain therein; and that due satisfaction, according to the Treaty on that behalf betwixt the two Kingdoms, should be made to the <HI>Scots</HI> Army in <HI>Ireland,</HI> out of the Lands of the Kingdom, or otherwise: And that the King, according to the Intention of his Father, should endeavour a compleat Union of the two Kingdoms, so as they may be one under his Majesty, and his Posterity; or if that cannot spee∣dily be effected, that all Liberties and Privileges, concerning Commerce, <MILESTONE N="30"/> Traffick, Manufactures, peculiar to the Subjects of either Nation, shall be common to the Subjects of both Kingdoms without distinction; and that there be a Communication, and mutual capacity, of all other Li∣berties of the Subjects in the two Kingdoms: That a competent Num∣ber of Ships should be yearly assign'd, and appointed out of his Majesties Navy, which should attend the Coasts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for a Guard, and freedom of Trade of that Nation; and that his Majesty should declare that his Successors, as well as Himself, are obliged to the performance of the Articles, and conditions of this Agreement; but that his Majesty shall not be obliged to the performance of the aforesaid Articles, until <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall declare for him in pursuance of this Agreement; and that the whole Articles, and Conditions aforesaid, shall be finished, perfected, and perform'd, before the return of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; and that when they return into <HI>Scotland,</HI> at the same time,” <HI>simul &amp; semel,</HI> all Armies should be disbanded in <HI>England.</HI></Q> And for a complement, and to give a relish to all the rest, <Q>the King engaged himself “to imploy those of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation equally with the <HI>English</HI> in all For∣reign Implovments, and Negotiations; and that a third part of all the Offices and Places about the King, Queen, and Prince, should be con∣ferr'd upon some Persons of that Nation; and that the King and Prince, <MILESTONE N="50"/> or one of them, will frequently reside in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the Subjects of” that Kingdom may be known to them.</Q> This Treaty and Agreement be∣ing thus presented to the King by the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners in the Castle
<PB N="82" REF="1060"/>
of <HI>Carisbrook,</HI> his Majesty was prevailed with to sign the same the 26<SUP>th</SUP> day of <HI>December</HI> 1647; <Q>and to oblige himself, “in the word of a King,” to perform His part of the said Articles;</Q> and the Earl of <HI>Lowden,</HI> Chan∣cellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> being intrusted as Commissioners from that Kingdom, sign'd it likewise at the same time; <Q>and engaged themselves “upon their honour, faith, and conscience, and all that is dear to honest Men, to endeavour to the utmost of their power, that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> should engage to perform what was on its part to be perform'd; which they were con∣fident the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> would do, and they themselves would” <MILESTONE N="10"/> hazard their Lives and Fortunes in pursuance thereof.</Q></P>
<P>NO Man, who reads this Treaty (which very few Men have ever done) can wonder that such an Engagement met with the fate that attended it; which contain'd so many monstrous Concessions, that, except the whole Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> had been likewise imprisoned in <HI>Carisbrook</HI> Castle with the King, it could not be imagined that it was possible to be perform'd; and the three Persons who were Parties to it, were too wise to believe that it could be punctually observ'd; which they used as the best Argument, and which only prevailed with the King, <Q>“that the Treaty was only made to enable them to engage the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <MILESTONE N="20"/> raise an Army, and to unite it in his Majesties Service; which less than those Concessions would never induce them to do; but when that Ar∣my should be enter'd into <HI>England,</HI> and so many other Armies should be on foot of his <HI>English</HI> Subjects for the vindication of his Interest, there would be no body to exact all those particulars; but every body would” submit to what his Majesty should think fit to be done;</Q> which, though it had been urged more than once before to induce the King to consent to other inconveniencies, which they would never after release to him, did prevail with him at this time. And, to confirm him in the belief of it, they were contented that it should be inserted under the same Treaty, <MILESTONE N="30"/> as it was, <Q>“that his Majesty did declare, that by the Clause of confirming Presbyterian Government by Act of Parliament, he is neither obliged to desire the settling Presbyterian Government, nor to present any Bills to that effect; and that he likewise understands that no Person what∣soever shall suffer in his Estate, nor undergo any Corporal punishment, for not submitting to Presbyterian Government; his Majesty under∣standing that this indemnity should not extend to those who are men∣tion'd” in the Article against Toleration:</Q> and to this the three Earls likewise subscribed their hands, "as Witnesses only, as they said, <Q>“that his Majesty had made that Declaration in their presence, not as Assen∣ters;” <MILESTONE N="40"/> so wary they were of administring jealousy to their Masters,</Q> or of being thought to be less rigid in so Fundamental a Point, as they knew that would be thought to be.</P>
<P>THERE was a wonderful difference, throughout their whole proceed∣ings, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Author's judgement of the different Conduct of the two Parties, the Indepen∣dent</HI> English <HI>and the Pres∣byterian</HI> Scots.</NOTE> between the heads of those who were thought to sway the Presby∣terian counsels, and those who govern'd the Independents, though they were equally Masters of dissimulation, and had equally malice and wicked∣ness in their Intentions, though not of the same kind, and were equally unrestrain'd by any scruples or motions of Conscience, the Independents allways doing that, which how ill and unjustifiable soever, contributed <MILESTONE N="50"/> still to the end they aimed at, and to the conclusion they meant to bring to pass; whereas the Presbyterians, for the most part, did somewhat that reasonably must destroy their own end, and cross that which they first and
<PB N="83" REF="1030"/>
principally design'd; and there were two Reasons that might naturally produce this ill success to the Latter, at least hinder'd the even progress and current which favour'd the other. First, their Councils were most distracted and divided, being made up of many Men, whose humours and natures must be observ'd, and complied with, and whose concurrence was necessary to the carrying on the same designs, though their Inclinations did not concur in them; whereas the other Party was entirely led and govern'd by two or three, to whom they resign'd, implicitely, the con∣duct of their Interest; who advanced, when they saw it seasonable, and stood still, or retired, or even declined the way they best liked, when they <MILESTONE N="10"/> saw any inconvenient jealousy awaken'd by the Progress they had made.</P>
<P>IN the second place, the Presbyterians, by whom I mean the <HI>Scots,</HI> form'd all their counsels by the Inclinations, and Affections of the People; and first consider'd how they might corrupt, and seduce, and dispose them to second their purposes; and how far they might depend upon their con∣currence and assistance, before they resolv'd to make any attempt; and this made them in such a degree submit to their senseless, and wretched Clergy; whose infectious breath corrupted, and govern'd the People, and whose Authority was prevalent upon their own Wives, and in their do∣mestick affairs; and yet they never communicated to them more than <MILESTONE N="20"/> the outside of their designs: Whereas, on the other side, <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the few others with whom he consulted, first consider'd what was abso∣lutely necessary to their main and determin'd end; and then, whether it were right or wrong, to make all other means subservient to it; to couzen and deceive Men, as long as they could induce them to contribute to what they desired, upon motives how forreign soever; and when they would keep company with them no longer, or farther serve their pur∣poses, to compel them by force to submit to what they should not be able to oppose; and so the one resolv'd, only to do what they believ'd the Peo∣ple would like and approve; and the other, that the People should like <MILESTONE N="30"/> and approve what they had resolv'd. And this difference in the measures they took, was the true cause of so different success in all they undertook. <HI>Machiavel,</HI> in this, was in the right, though he got an ill name by it with those who take what he says from the report of other Men, or do not enough consider themselves what he says, and his method in speaking (He was as great an Enemy to Tyranny and Injustice in any Government, as any Man then was, or now is; and says) <Q>“that a Man were better be a Dog than be subject to those passions and appetites, which possess all” unjust, and ambitious, and tyrannical Persons;</Q> but he confesses, <Q>“that they who are so transported, and have entertain'd such wicked designs <MILESTONE N="40"/> as are void of all Conscience, must not think to prosecute them by the rules of Conscience, which was laid aside, or subdued, before they en∣ter'd upon them; they must make no scruple of doing all those impious things which are necessary to compass, and support the impiety to” which they have devoted themselves;</Q> and therefore he commends <HI>Cae∣sar Borgia</HI> for <Q>“not being startled with breach of Faith, Perjuries, and Murthers, for the removal of those Men who he was sure would cross, and enervate the whole Enterprise he had resolv'd, and addicted himself to; and blames those Usurpers, who had made themselves Tyrants, for hoping to support a Government by Justice, which they had assumed <MILESTONE N="50"/> unjustly, and which having wickedly attempted, they manifestly lost by” not being wicked enough.</Q> The common old Adage, <Q>“that he who hath drawn his Sword against his Prince, ought to throw away the Scabbard,”
<PB N="84" REF="1040"/>
never to think of sheathing it again, will still hold good;</Q> and they who enter upon unwarrantable Enterprises, must pursue many unwarrantable ways to preserve themselves from the penalty of the first guilt.</P>
<P>CROMWELL, though the greatest Dissembler living, allways made his Hypocrisy of singular use and benefit to him; and never did any thing, how ungracious or imprudent soever it seem'd to be, but what was ne∣cessary to the design; even his roughness and unpolishedness, which, in the beginning of the Parliament, he affected contrary to the smoothness, and complacency, which his Cousin, and bosom Friend, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden</HI> practiced towards all Men, was necessary; and his first publick Declara∣tion, in the beginning of the War, to his Troop when it was first muster'd, <MILESTONE N="10"/> <Q>“that he would not deceive or couzen them by the perplexed and involv'd” expressions in his Commission, to fight for King and Parliament;</Q> and therefore told them, <Q>“that if the King chanced to be in the Body of the Enemy that he was to charge, he would assoon discharge his Pistol upon Him, as any other private Person; and if their conscience would not permit them to do the like, he advised them not to list themselves in his” Troop, or under his Command;</Q> which was generally looked upon as imprudent, and malitious, and might, by the professions the Parliament then made, have prov'd dangerous to him; yet serv'd his turn, and sever'd <MILESTONE N="20"/> from others, and united among themselves, all the furious, and incensed Men against the Government, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, to look upon him as a Man for their turn, upon whom they might depend, as one who would go through his work that he undertook. And his strict and unsociable humour in not keeping company with the other Officers of the Army in their jollities, and excesses, to which most of the superior Officers under the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> were inclined, and by which he often made himself ridiculous or contemptible, drew all those of the like sour or reserv'd Natures, to his society and conversation, and gave him oppor∣tunity to form their Understandings, Inclinations, and Resolutions, to his <MILESTONE N="30"/> own Model. By this he grew to have a wonderful Interest in the Com∣mon Soldiers, out of which, as his Authority increased, he made all his Officers, well instructed how to live in the same manner with their Sol∣diers, that they might be able to apply them to their own purposes: whilst he looked upon the Presbyterian humour as the best incentive to Rebel∣lion, no Man more a Presbyterian; he sung all Psalms with them to their tunes, and lov'd the longest Sermons as much as they; but when he dis∣cover'd that they would prescribe some limits and bounds to their Re∣bellion, that it was not well breathed, and would expire assoon as some few particulars were granted to them in Religion, which he cared not for; <MILESTONE N="40"/> and then that the Government must run still in the same Channel; it con∣cern'd him to make it believ'd <Q>“that the State had been more delinquent than the Church, and that the People suffer'd more by the Civil than by the Ecclesiastical power; and therefore that the Change of one, would give them little ease, if there were not as great an alteration in the other,” and if the whole Government in both were not reform'd, and alter'd;</Q> which though it made him generally odious at first, and irreconciled ma∣ny of his old Friends to him, yet it made those who remain'd, more cor∣dial, and firm: he could better compute his own strength, and upon whom he might depend. This discovery made him contrive the new Model of <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Army; which was the most unpopular Act, and disobliged all those who first contrived the Rebellion, and who were the very Soul of it; and yet, if he had not brought that to pass, and changed a General, who,
<PB N="85" REF="1090"/>
though not very sharp sighted, would never be govern'd, nor applied to any thing he did not like, for another who had no Eyes, and so would be willing to be led, all his designs must have come to nothing, and He re∣main'd a private Colonel of Horse, not considerable enough to be in any figure upon an advantageous Composition.</P>
<P>AFTER all the Successes of his new Model, he saw his Army was bal∣lanced by that of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who took themselves to have equal merit with the other, and was thought to have contributed no less towards the sup∣pression of the King, than that under <HI>Fairfax</HI> had done; and after all the Victories, and reduction of the King to that lowness, desired still a com∣position, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and to submit again to the Subjection of the King; nor was it yet time for him to own or communicate his resolution to the contrary, lest even many of those who wished the extirpation of Monarchy, might be startled at the difficulty of the Enterprise, and with the Power that was like to oppose them. <Q>He was therefore first to incense the People against the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, “as being a mercenary aid, entertain'd at a vast Charge to the Kingdom, that was only to be paid their Wages, and to be dismissed, without having the honour to judge with them upon what conditions the King should be receiv'd, and restored; the accomplish∣ing whereof, ought to be the particular Glory of the Parliament with∣out” <MILESTONE N="20"/> a Rival, and that the King might owe the benefit wholely to Them.</Q> And this was as popular an Argument as he could embark himself in, the whole Kingdom in general having at that time a great detestation of the <HI>Scots;</HI> and they who most desired the King's Restoration, wish'd that he might have as little obligation to them as was possible, and that they might have as little credit afterwards with him. With this universal Ap∣plause, he compelled the <HI>Scots</HI> Army to depart the Kingdom, with that circumstance as must ever after render them odious and infamous. There now seem'd nothing more dangerous and destructive to the power and interest of the <HI>English</HI> Army, in so general a discontent throughout the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Kingdom, than a division, and mutiny within it self; that the Common Soldiers should erect an Authority distinct from their Officers, by which they would choose to govern against their Superior Commanders, at least without them, and to fancy that they had an Interest of their own sever'd from theirs, for the preservation whereof they were to trust none but themselves; which had scarce ever been heard of before in any Army, and was looked upon as a presage of the ruin of the whole, and of those who had adhered to them; yet, if he had not raised this seditious Spirit in the Army, he could not have prevented the disbanding some part of it, and sending another part of it into <HI>Ireland,</HI> before the <HI>Scots</HI> left <HI>New-Castle;</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> nor have been able to have taken the King from <HI>Holmby</HI> into the hands of the Army, after the <HI>Scots</HI> were gone. And after all his hypo∣crisy towards the King and his Party, by which he prevented many in∣conveniencies which might have befallen him, he could never have been rid of him again so unreproachfully, as by his changing his own counte∣nance, and giving cause to the King to suspect the safety of his Person, and thereupon to make his Escape from the Army; by which his Majesty quickly became a Prisoner, and so was deprived of any resort, from whence many mischiefs might have proceeded to have disturbed his Counsels. How constantly he pursued this method in his subsequent <MILESTONE N="50"/> Actions, will be observ'd in its place.</P>
<P>CONTRARY to this the Presbyterian <HI>Scots</HI> proceeded, in all their Actions after their first invasion in the year 1640, and allways interwove
<PB N="86" REF="1100"/>
some conditions in their Counsels and Transactions, which did not only prove, but, in the instant, might have been discern'd to be diametrically opposite to their publick interest, and to their particular designs. It is very true, that their first Invasion, saving their breach of Allegiance, might have some excuse from their Interest. They were a poor People, and though many particular Men of that Nation had receiv'd great Boun∣ties, and were exceedingly enriched in the Court of <HI>England</HI> by King <HI>James</HI> and the present King, yet those particular Men who had been, and then were in the Court, were, for the most part, Persons of little In∣terest in <HI>Scotland;</HI> nor was that Kingdom at all enriched by the con∣junction <MILESTONE N="10"/> with this; and they thought themselves exposed to some late pressures, which were new to them, and which their Preachers told them <Q>“”were against Conscience, and an Invasion of their Religion;</Q> from which they had vindicated themselves so rudely, and unwarrantably, that they might well expect to be called to an account hereafter, if those Persons whom they had most provoked, retain'd their interest still with the King, and in his Councils; from whom they were promised to be secured, and to be well paid for their pains, if they would, by marching into <HI>England</HI> with an Army, give their Friends their countenance to own their own grievances, and so to procure relief and security for both Kingdoms. In <MILESTONE N="20"/> this enterprise, the success crown'd their work; they were thought a wise, and a resolute Nation; and after an unbloody War of above a year, they return'd into their Country laden with Spoiles and great Riches; and were liberally rewarded, as well for going out, as for coming into <HI>England.</HI> But from their return from this Expedition, their whole true Interest consisted in, and depended upon, an entire adhering to the King, and vindicating his Honour and Interest from all Assaults; and their being suborn'd afterwards (when the King was in a hopeful way to have re∣duced his <HI>English</HI> Rebels to their obedience, by the strength and power of his Armes) to make a second Invasion of the Kingdom, was a weak <MILESTONE N="30"/> and childish Engagement, directly opposite to their Interest, except they had at the same time a resolution to have changed their own Govern∣ment, and for ever to have renounced subjection to Monarchy (which was never in their purpose to do) or to withdraw it from the present King. Again, when his Majesty had trusted them so far (which they had never reason to expect) as to put his Royal Person into their hands, and thereby given them an opportunity to redeem themselves in the Eyes of the world, and to undo some part of the mischief they had done, it was surely their Interest to have joyn'd cordially with him, and firmly to have united themselves to his Party in vindication of the Law, and the Go∣vernment <MILESTONE N="40"/> established; and if they had not had the Courage at that time to have looked the <HI>English</HI> Army in the face, as apparently they had not, it had been their Interest to have retired with the King in the head of their Army into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and, leaving good Garrisons in <HI>New-Castle, Berwick,</HI> and <HI>Carlisle,</HI> all which were in their possession, to have expected a revolution in <HI>England</HI> from the divisions amongst themselves, and from some conjunction with a strong Body of the King's <HI>English</HI> Party, which would quickly have found themselves together; but the delivery of the King up, besides the infamy of it, was, in view, destructive to all that could be thought their Interest. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>AFTER all this, when they found themselves couzen'd and deceiv'd in all the measures they had taken, and laughed at and despised by those who had deceiv'd them, to have a new opportunity to serve the King,
<PB N="87" REF="1070"/>
and then to insist upon such conditions as must make it impossible for them to serve him effectually, was such a degree of weakness, and a de∣prav'd understanding, that they can never be looked upon as Men who knew what their Interest was, or what was necessary to advance their own designs. And yet we shall be obliged to observe how incorrigibly they adher'd to this obstinate and froward Method, in all the Transactions they afterwards had with the King; all which turn'd, as it could not but do, to their own ruin, and the destruction of that Idol they adored, and paid their devotion to. But it is time to return to our discourse, from whence this tedious digression hath misled us. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>ALL designs and Negotiations, abroad and at home, being in this state <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's condition in the Isle of</HI> Wight <HI>at this time</HI></NOTE> and condition, the King remain'd under a strict, and disconsolate impri∣sonment, no Man being suffer'd to speak with him, and all diligence used to intercept all Letters which might pass to, or from him; yet he found means sometimes, by the affection and fidelity of some Inhabitants of the Island, to receive important advertisements from his Friends; and to write to and receive Letters from the Queen; and so he inform'd her of the <HI>Scots</HI> Transaction, and of all the other hopes he had; and seem'd to have some ease; and looked upon it as a good Omen, that in that desperate lowness of his Fortune, and notwithstanding all the care that was taken <MILESTONE N="20"/> that none should be about him but Men of inhuman tempers and natures, void of all reverence towards God and Man, his Majesties gracious dis∣position, and generous affability still wrought upon some Soldier, or other Person placed about him, to undertake, and perform some Offices of trust, in conveying Papers to and from him. So great a force and influence had Natural duty; or some desperate Men had so much craft, and forecast, to lay out a little application that might bring advantage to them in such a change as they neither looked for, nor desired. But many who did un∣dertake to perform those Offices, did not make good what they pro∣mised; which made it plain, they were permitted to get credit, that <MILESTONE N="30"/> they might the more usefully betray.</P>
<P>IN the Parliament, there was no opposition or contradiction in any <NOTE PLACE="marg">The present condition of the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> thing relating to the Publick; but in all those transactions which con∣cern'd particular Persons, with reference to Rewards, Preferments, or matter of profit, Men were consider'd according to the Party they were of; every day those receiv'd benefit who had appear'd most to adhere to the Army; the notorious Presbyterians were removed from places of Profit and Authority; which vexed them; and well prepared and dis∣posed them to be ready for revenge. But the Pulpit-Skirmishes were higher than ever; the Presbyterians, in Those fields, losing nothing of <MILESTONE N="40"/> their Courage, having a notorious power in the City, notwithstanding the emulation of the Independents, who were more Learned and Ra∣tional; who, though they had not so great Congregations of the Com∣mon People, yet insected, and were followed by, the most substantial, and wealthy Citizens; and by others of better condition. To these Men <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and most of the Officers of the Army adhered, with bitterness against the other. But the Divinity of the time was not to be judged by the Preaching, and Congregations in Churches, which were now thought not to be the fit and proper places for Devotion and Religious Assem∣blies, where the Bishops had exercised such illimited Tyranny, and which <MILESTONE N="50"/> had been polluted by their Original Consecrations. Liberty of Con∣science was now become the great Charter; and Men who were <HI>inspired,</HI> Preached and Prayed, when, and where they would. <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself
<PB N="88" REF="1080"/>
was the greatest Preacher; and most of the Officers of the Army, and many Common Soldiers, shew'd their <HI>gifts</HI> that way. Anabaptists grew very numerous, with whom the Independents concurr'd so far as to joyn with them for the utter abolishing of Tithes, as of Judaical Institution; which was now the patrimony of the Presbyterians, and therefore pro∣secuted by one Party, and defended by the other, with equal passion, and Animosity. If any honest Man could have been at so much ease as to have beheld the prospect with delight, never was such a scene of confusion, as at this time had spread it self over the face of the whole Kingdom. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>DURING all this time, the Prince remain'd at <HI>Paris</HI> under the Go∣vernment <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince's condition at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> of his Mother, exercised with that strictness, that though his Highness was above the Age of seventeen years, it was not desired that he should meddle in any business, or be sensible of the unhappy condi∣tion the Royal Family was in. The Assignation which was made by the Court of <HI>France</HI> for the better support of the Prince, was annexed to the Monthly allowance given to the Queen, and receiv'd by Her, and distributed as she thought fit; such Clothes and other necessaries pro∣vided for his Highness as were thought convenient; her Majesty desiring to have it thought that the Prince lived entirely upon Her, and that it <MILESTONE N="20"/> would not consist with the dignity of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to be a Pen∣sioner to the King of <HI>France.</HI> Hereby none of his Highness's Servants had any pretence to ask Money, but they were to be contented with what should be allow'd to them; which was dispensed with a very sparing hand; nor was the Prince himself ever Master of ten Pistols to dispose as he desired. The Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> was the Queen's chief Officer, and govern'd all her receipts, and he lov'd plenty so well, that he would not be without it, whatever others suffer'd. All who had any relation to the Prince, were to implore His aid; and the Prince himself could obtain nothing but by Him; which made most Persons of Honour of the <HI>English</HI> Na∣tion <MILESTONE N="30"/> who were driven into banishment, as many of the Nobility and chief Gentry of the Kingdom then were, choose rather to make their re∣sidence in any other place, as <HI>Caen, Roan,</HI> and the like, than in <HI>Paris,</HI> where the Prince was, and could do so little: nor was this Oeconomy well liked even in <HI>France,</HI> nor the Prince himself so much respected as he would have been if he had liv'd more like himself, and appear'd more concern'd in his own Business.</P>
<P>WHEN the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> came thither, he was receiv'd very graciously by the Queen, and consulted with in all things, being the Person most depended upon to begin to give a turn to their fortune, re∣commended <MILESTONE N="40"/> to them by the King, and of the most universal reputation of any Subject the King had. He pressed a speedy dispatch, that he might pursue his designs in <HI>Ireland;</HI> where he longed to be, whilst the Affairs of that Kingdom were no more taken to heart by the Parlia∣ment, who had yet sent no supplies thither. He inform'd the Queen, and the Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> of the necessity of hastning that work, which they understood well enough by the <HI>Irish</HI> Commissioners; who had been there, and had been sent back with a million of promises, a coyn that Court allways abounded with, and made most of its payments in.</P>
<P>WHEN the Queen, who was as zealous for the dispatch as was possi∣ble, <MILESTONE N="50"/> pressed the Queen Regent, and the Cardinal, upon it, she receiv'd in words all the satisfaction imaginable, and assurance that all things should be speedily provided; and when the Marquis spoke first with
<PB N="89" REF="1110"/>
the Cardinal upon the Subject, he found him well disposed; making such ample promises for a very good Sum of Money, and such a Propor∣tion of Armes, and Ammunition, as could be wished. So that he thought he had no more to do, but to appoint the place for his embrakation, that those provisions might be sent thither to meet him; and that he should be ready to transport himself within a very short time; of which he gave notice to those who expected him in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and prepared all his own Accommodations accordingly. But he was very much disap∣pointed in his expectation; the Cardinal was not so confident of the re∣covery of the King's Affairs as to disoblige the Parliament by contri∣buting <MILESTONE N="10"/> towards it: so that Affair advanced very slowly.</P>
<P>HAVING now, contrary to the order formerly observ'd by me, crowded in all the particular passages, and important Transactions of two whole years into this Book, that I might not interrupt, or discon∣tinue the relation of the mysterious Proceedings of the Army, their great Hypocrisy, and Dissimulation, practiced towards the King and his Party, and then their pulling off their Mask, and appearing in their na∣tural dress of inhumanity and savageness, with the vile Artifices of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners to draw the King into their hands, and then their low and base compliance, and gross folly, in delivering him up, and lastly <MILESTONE N="20"/> their absurd and merchandly trafficking with him for the price of re∣turning to their Allegiance, when there was no other way of preserving themselves, and their Nation from being destroyed, the many woeful Tragedies of the next year, which filled the world with amazement and horrour, must be the Subject of the discourse in the next Book.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F a universal discontent and murmuring of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temper of the Nation at this time.</NOTE> the three Nations, and allmost as general a de∣testation both of Parliament and Army, and a most passionate desire that all their follies and madness might be forgotten in restoring the King to all they had taken from him, and in settling that blessed Government they had de∣prived themselves of, could have contributed to his Majesties recovery, never People were better disposed to erect and repair again the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Building they had so maliciously thrown and pulled down. In <HI>England</HI> there was a general discontent amongst all sorts of Men; many Officers and Soldiers who had serv'd the Parliament from the beginning of the War, and given too great Testimonies of their courage and fidelity to their Party, and had been disbanded upon the new Model, looked upon the present Army with hatred, as those who reaped the harvest and re∣ward of Their labours, and spake of them and against them in all places accordingly: The Nobility and Gentry who had advanced the credit and reputation of the Parliament by concurring with it against the King, sound themselves totally neglected, and the most inferior People pre∣ferr'd <MILESTONE N="20"/> to all places of trust and profit: The Presbyterian Ministers talked very loud; their Party appear'd to be very numerous, and the expecta∣tion
<PB N="94" REF="1140"/>
of an attempt from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the importunity and clamour from <HI>Ireland,</HI> for supplies of Men and Money against the <HI>Irish,</HI> who grew powerful, raised the Courage of all discontented Persons to meet and confer together, and all to inveigh against the Army, and the Of∣ficers who corrupted it. The Parliament bore no reproach so con∣cernedly, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> Ireland <HI>during the Lord</HI> Lisle<HI>'s being there.</HI></NOTE> as that of <Q>“the want of supplies to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that, having so great an Army without an Enemy, they would not spare any part” of it to preserve that Kingdom.</Q> This Argument made a new warmth in the House of Commons, they who had been silent, and given over insisting upon the insolence and presumption of the Army, which had <MILESTONE N="10"/> prevailed, and crushed them, took now new Spirit, and pressed the re∣lief of <HI>Ireland</HI> with great earnestness, and in order thereunto made great inquisition into the Expences of the Money, and how such vast Sums receiv'd had been disbursed; which was a large Field, and led them to many Mens doors upon whom they were willing to be re∣venged.</P>
<P>THERE was a design this way to get the Presbyterians again into power, and that they might get the Command of an Army for the sub∣duing the Rebels in <HI>Ireland. Cromwell</HI> had, for the quieting the Cla∣mours from thence, got the Lord <HI>Lisle,</HI> eldest Son to the Earl of <HI>Lei∣cester,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> to be sent under the Title of Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom thither, with a Commission for a limited time. He had landed in <HI>Mun∣ster,</HI> either out of the Jealousy they had of the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> or be∣cause the best part of their Army of <HI>English</HI> were under his Command in that Province. But that Expedition gave the <HI>English</HI> no relief, nor weaken'd the power or strength of the <HI>Irish,</HI> but rather increased their reputation by the Faction and bitterness that was between the Lieute∣nant and the President, who writ Letters of complaint one against the other to the Parliament, where they had both their Parties which ad∣hered to them. So that, the time of his Commission being expired, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> the contrary Party not suffering it to be renew'd, the Lord <HI>Lisle</HI> re∣turn'd again into <HI>England,</HI> leaving the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> whom he meant to have destroyed, in the entire possession of the Command, and in greater reputation than he was before. And, in truth, he had preserv'd both with wonderful dexterity, expecting every day the Arrival of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and every day informing the Parliament of the ill condition he was in, and pressing for a supply of Men and Money, when he knew they would send neither.</P>
<P>UPON the return of the Lord <HI>Lisle</HI> the Presbyterians renew'd their design, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Waller <HI>nomi∣nated General there, but op∣posed by</HI> Cromwell; <HI>who proposed</HI> Lambert.</NOTE> and caused S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Waller</HI> to be named for Deputy or Lieu∣tenant <MILESTONE N="40"/> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the rather (over and above his merit, and the expe∣rience they had had of his Service) because he could quickly draw to∣gether those Officers and Soldiers which had serv'd under him, and were now disbanded, and would willingly again engage under their old Ge∣neral. At the first, <HI>Cromwell</HI> did not oppose this motion, but consented to it, being very willing to be rid both of <HI>Waller,</HI> and all the Officers who were willing to go with him; who he knew were not his Friends, and watched an opportunity to be even with him. But when he saw <HI>Waller</HI> insist upon great Supplies to carry with him, as he had reason to do, and when he consider'd of what consequence it might be to him <MILESTONE N="50"/> and all his designs, if a well form'd and disciplined Army should be un∣der the power of <HI>Waller,</HI> and such Officers, he changed his mind; and first set his Instruments to cross such a supply of Men and Money, as
<PB N="95" REF="1150"/>
he had proposed; <Q>“the one, as more than necessary for the Service, and” the other as more than they could spare from their other occasions: and when this check was put to <HI>Waller</HI>'s Engagement,</Q> he caused <HI>Lam∣bert</HI> to be proposed for that Expedition, a Man who was then fast to the same Interest He embraced, and who had gotten a great name in the Army. He formalized so long upon this, that <HI>Ireland</HI> remain'd still un∣supplied, and their Affairs there seem'd to be in a very ill condition.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> made so much noise of their purposes, even before their Commissioners left <HI>London,</HI> and gave such constant advertisements of the impatience of their Country-men to be in Armes for the King, <MILESTONE N="10"/> though they made no hast in providing for such an Expedition, that both the Presbyterians, who were their chief Correspondents, and the Royal Party, bethought themselves how they might be ready; the one, that they might redeem themselves from their former Guilt, and the other, that they might not only have a good part in freeing the King from his Imprisonment, but be able to preserve him in Liberty from any Presbyterian Impositions, which they still apprehended the <HI>Scots</HI> might endeavour to oppose, though they had no suspicion of the En∣gagement lately mention'd at the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who had done twice very notoriously amiss, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Holland <HI>pre∣pares to rise with the Duke of</HI> Bucks <HI>and others.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"/> and had been, since his return from <HI>Oxford,</HI> notably despised by all Per∣sons of credit in the Parliament and the Army, had a mind to redeem his former faults by a new and thorough Engagement. He had much credit by descent and by alliance with the Presbyterian Party, and was Privy to the undertakings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had constant Intelligence of the advance that was made there. His Brother, the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> had undergone some mortification with the rest, and had not that Au∣thotity in the Naval Affairs as he had used to have, though he was the High Admiral of <HI>England</HI> by Ordinance of Parliament, and had done them extraordinary Services. He did not restrain, or endeavour to sup∣press <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI>'s discontents, but inflamed them, and pro∣mised to joyn with him, as many others of that Gang of Men did; re∣solving that the <HI>Scots</HI> should not do all that work, but that they would have a share in the merit. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and his Brother, the Lord <HI>Francis Villiers,</HI> were newly return'd from travel, and though both very young, were strong and active Men, and being, in respect of their Infancy, uningaged in the late War, and so unhurt by it, and com∣ing now to the possession of large Estates, which they thought they were obliged to venture for the Crown upon the first opportunity, they fell easily into the friendship of the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and were ready to <MILESTONE N="40"/> embark themselves in his adventure. The Earl had made tender of his resolutions to his old Mistress the Queen at <HI>Paris,</HI> who was allways disposed to trust him, and the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> and He renewed their for∣mer friendship, the warmth whereof had never been extinguished.</P>
<P>So a Commission was sent from the Prince to the Earl to be General of an Army, that was to be raised for the redemption of the King from Prison, and to restore the Parliament to its freedom. The Earl of <HI>Pe∣terborough,</HI> and <HI>John Mordaunt</HI> his Brother, the Family of the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> and all the Officers who had serv'd the King in the War, with which the City of <HI>London,</HI> and all Parts of the Kingdom abounded, <MILESTONE N="50"/> applied themselves to the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and receiv'd Commissions from him for several Commands.</P>
<P>THIS Engagement was so well known, and so generally spoken of
<PB N="96" REF="1160"/>
that they concluded that the Parliament durst not take notice of it, or wished well to it. And there is no question, never undertaking of that nature was carried on with so little reservation; there was scarce a Coun∣ty in <HI>England,</HI> in which there was not some Association enter'd into to appear in Armes for the King. They who had the principal Command in <HI>Wales</HI> under the Parliament, sent to <HI>Paris</HI> to declare, <Q>“that, if they might have supply of Armes and Ammunition, and a reasonable Sum for the payment of their Garrisons, they would declare for the King,” having the chief places of those parts in their Custody.</Q> The Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> encouraged all those Overtures with most positive undertaking, <MILESTONE N="10"/> that they should be supplied with all they expected, within so many days after they should declare; which they depended upon, and he, ac∣cording to his custom, never thought of after; by which the Service miscarried, and many Gallant Men were lost.</P>
<P>CROMWELL, to whom all these Machinations were known, chose rather to run the hazard of all that such a loose Combination could pro∣duce, than, by seising upon Persons, to engage the Parliament in Exa∣minations, and in parties; the inconvenience whereof he apprehended more; finding already that the Presbyterian Party had so great an in∣fluence upon the General, that he declared to him, <Q>“he would not” <MILESTONE N="20"/> march against the <HI>Scots,</HI> whom he had a good mind to have visited be∣fore their counsels and Resolutions were form'd;</Q> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> had reason to believe, that <HI>Fairfax</HI> would be firm to the same mind, even after they should have invaded the Kingdom.</P>
<P>ALL things being in this forwardness in <HI>England,</HI> it is fit to enquire <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scots <HI>pre∣parations for an Expedition into</HI> England.</NOTE> how the <HI>Scots</HI> complied with their obligations, and what expedition they used in raising their Army. After the Commissioners return from <HI>London,</HI> upon the King's being made Prisoner in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> it was long before the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> could be prevailed with to con∣sent that a Parliament should be called. He had made a fast friendship <MILESTONE N="30"/> with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <HI>Vane;</HI> and knew that in this new stipulation with the King, the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Faction was the great Undertaker, and meant to have all the Honour of whatsoever should follow. And yet the Duke upon his return to <HI>Scotland</HI> liv'd at first very privately at his own House; seldom went abroad to any meeting; and to those who came to him, and to whom that resolution would be grateful, he used to speak darkly, and as a Man that thought more of revenge upon those who had imprison'd him, than of assisting the Crown to recover the Autho∣rity it had lost. <HI>Argyle,</HI> whose power was over that violent Party of the Clergy which would not depart from the most rigid clause in the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Covenant, and were without any reverence for the King or his Govern∣ment, discern'd that he should never be able to hinder the calling of a Parliament, which the People generally called for, and that he should sooner obtain his end by puzling their proceedings, and obstructing their determinations, after they should be assembled, than by obstinately opposing their coming together. So Summons were issued for the con∣vention of a Parliament; and they who appear'd most concern'd for the King, and to set him at Liberty from his Imprisonment (which was all they pretended) were the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> Brother to Duke <HI>Ha∣milton,</HI> and then restored to his Office of Secretary of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="50"/> had been imprison'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and made his escape from thence; and the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who had been with the forwardest from the beginning of the Rebellion, when he was scarce of Age, and pro∣secuted
<PB N="97" REF="1170"/>
it to the end with most eminent Fierceness and Animosity.</P>
<P>THEY were both Men of great Parts and Industry, though they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chara∣cters of</HI> Lan∣rick <HI>and</HI> Lau∣therdale</NOTE> lov'd pleasures too; both proud and ambitious; the Former, much the civiller and better bred, of the better Nature, and better Judgement, and an openness and clearness more to be trusted and relied upon than most Men of that Party: the Latter, insolent, imperious, flattering, and dissembling, fitter for Intrigues and Contrivances by the want of the ingenuity which the other had, and by the experience and practice he had in the Committee of both Kingdoms in their darkest designs. The Former, was a Man of Honour and Courage; the Latter, had <MILESTONE N="10"/> Courage enough not to fail where it was absolutely necessary, and no impediment of Honour to restrain him from doing any thing that might gratify any of his passions.</P>
<P>THESE two were the chief Managers and Contrivers to carry on this Affair, for though the Chancellor, the Earl of <HI>Lowden,</HI> had been a Commissioner in <HI>England,</HI> and as privy to the Treaty with the King, and had made as many professions and protestations of duty to him as They, and indeed was willing to perform them, yet he was so obnoxious for his loose and vitious life, which was notorious, that he durst not provoke <HI>Argyle</HI> or the Clergy by dissenting from them. They used all <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Interest and Skill they had, to get such Elections in the Boroughs of Members for the Parliament as might comply with them; and the People generally were exceedingly offended, and ashamed of the infa∣mous delivery up of the King to the <HI>English,</HI> to which they imputed all the danger that threaten'd them, and the reproach and infamy that lay upon their Country; and so had great prejudice to all Men who were thought to be the cause of it.</P>
<P>AT the opening of the Parliament, they did all they could to inflame <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment met in</HI> Scotland; <HI>and their Delibe∣rations.</HI></NOTE> the People against the Army in <HI>England;</HI> <Q>which, they said, “had forced the Parliament there to break the Treaty between the two Kingdoms <MILESTONE N="30"/> in their ill usage of the King, who was imprison'd by the Army, nor was it in the power of the Parliament to set him at liberty: That they had now, upon the matter, absolutely deposed him, by not suffering him to perform the Office of a King, nor permitting any of his Sub∣jects to repair to him; in which the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> was con∣cern'd, in that being independent upon <HI>England,</HI> and the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> they were by them deprived of their King, and could not be admitted to speak with him, nor his Majesty to send to them; which was such a presumption, and violation of the Law of Nations, and such a perfidious breach and contempt of the solemn League and <MILESTONE N="40"/> Covenant, and of the Treaty between the two Kingdoms, that they were bound by all the obligations humane and divine to be sensible of it, and to redeem their King's liberty, and their own honour, with the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes and all that was dear to them: and therefore they desired that they might enter upon those Counsels, which might soonest get an Army together, which should no sooner enter <HI>England,</HI> but it would find a conjunction from that whole King∣dom, except only the Army; and that it would then quickly appear that the Parliaments of both Kingdoms desired the same thing, and” to live happily under the Government of the same King.</Q> <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THIS discourse, urged and seconded by many of the principal Men, was entertain'd by the rest with so general a reception, that <HI>Argyle</HI> sound it would be to no purpose directly to contradict or oppose it.

He saw the Election of the Knights and Burgesses had succeeded ac∣cording to the wishes of the other Lords, and that they would concur with whatsoever was proposed; and he found likewise that they had wrought upon the greatest part of their Clergy; who believ'd all they said to them. He did not therefore oppose any thing proposed by them, but only desired, <Q>“that they would very well weigh the manner of their proceeding in an affair of so great concernment, which was like to ter∣minate in a bloody War between the two Kingdoms; which had hi∣therto proceeded as Brethren, and had both reaped great benefit and advantage from the conjunction: and he hoped there was no purpose <MILESTONE N="10"/> to shake any of those foundations which had been laid in the years by gone, which supported that Government, and made that Kingdom happy; which if dissolv'd, all the mischief and tyranny they had for∣merly felt and undergone, would break in upon them with a torrent” that should destroy them.</Q> Every Body declared, <Q>“that there was no purpose to swerve, in the least degree, from what was established for the Government in either Kingdom, by their solemn League and Co∣venant, which they had in perfect veneration, and looked upon it as” an obligation upon them to do all that had been proposed;</Q> upon which <HI>Argyle</HI> acquiesced as satisfied, not doubting but that, in the prosecution <MILESTONE N="20"/> of their counsels, he should find opportunity enough to obstruct the quick progress, and to interrupt the conclusion, and execution.</P>
<P>THE Lords who had been in <HI>England,</HI> and frequented <HI>Hampton</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> M. Lang∣dale <HI>and S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> P.

Of this kind there were two very notable Men, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave;</HI> both Men of large and plentiful Estates, the one in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> the other <MILESTONE N="30"/> in <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Westmoreland;</HI> who having been in the time of Peace eminent in their Country in the Offices of Justices of Peace, and Deputy Lieutenants, had, in the beginning of the War, engaged them∣selves in Commands in the King's Army with great reputation of stout, diligent, and active Officers; and continued to the end, and had not after applied themselves to make any composition, but expected a new opportunity to appear with their Swords in their hands. They were both looked upon by the Parliament, and the chief Officers of the Army, with great jealousy, as Men worthy to be fear'd, and who could never be induced to comply with them. The <HI>Scotish</HI> Lords had not been scru∣pulous <MILESTONE N="40"/> to let these two Gentlemen know what they intended, and <Q>“that they made no question but they should engage their whole Kingdom and Nation to enter into a present War with <HI>England</HI> on the King's behalf; and therefore desired them, by the Interest, and Influence they had upon the Northern Counties, to dispose them to a conjunction” with them.</Q> And because they knew that they two were too notorious to stay with any Security about <HI>London,</HI> much less in their own Coun∣try, they invited them into <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they assured them, <Q>“they should not only be safe, but very welcome; and should be Witnesses of their Proceedings, and have parts of their own to act in, assoon as” <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Season should be ripe.</Q></P>
<P>THESE Gentlemen, though they had been hitherto unhurt, and whilst the Army made those professions towards the King, had been
<PB N="99" REF="1190"/>
much courted by the chief Officers thereof, and had been Quarter'd with them as Friends, knew well, now the Mask was off, that if they did not immediately apply themselves to make their compositions, they should be apprehended, and imprisoned. And therefore, being perswaded that the <HI>Scots</HI> would engage for the King, they accepted their Invitation, and told them, <Q>“they should quickly find them in <HI>Scotland</HI> after their” own return.</Q> Accordingly, after having secretly spent some time in their own Countries, and directed their Friends to be in a readiness when they should be called upon, and in the mean time settled a way how to correspond together, they went into <HI>Scotland</HI> to those who had invited <MILESTONE N="10"/> them, and were receiv'd by them with civility enough. They own'd such a wariness, in respect of the jealousies amongst themselves, and the ill Arts of <HI>Argyle,</HI> that they desired them <Q>“for some time to withdraw” to some place</Q> (which they recommended to them) <Q>“and there to re∣main in secret, and under feigned Names, until the calling of the Par∣liament; at which time they might come to <HI>Edenborough,</HI> and ap∣pear” in their own likeness with all freedom.</Q> So after having remain'd in that private manner, where they were well treated for some Months, when the Parliament was assembled at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> they return'd thi∣ther; and were very well looked upon by all that knew them; which <MILESTONE N="20"/> made them behave themselves with the more freedom and confidence in their conversation, the foremention'd Lords telling them all they meant to do, and what Arts they were to use till they could get their Army up, towards which they believ'd they had master'd the greatest difficulties.</P>
<P>THOUGH the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners had withdrawn from <HI>London,</HI> shortly after they had protested loudly against the proceedings of the Parliament, both in imprisoning the King, and in refusing to give them leave to repair to him, or to receive from him any directions or orders concerning the Government of that Kingdom, and thought it high time <MILESTONE N="30"/> to provide for their own security by quitting their Station at <HI>London,</HI> where they receiv'd every day Affronts, and their Persons were exposed to contempt; yet there were no sooner Preparations towards a Parlia∣ment <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commissioners sent from the two Houses into</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> than Commissioners were sent from the Lords and Commons at <HI>Westminster</HI> to reside at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> as if they hoped to overvote them there too; and it was evident quickly that they were not without a strong or at least an active Party there. They were receiv'd with the same shew of respect, and the same care was taken for their Accommodation, as had been when they first came for contriving of the Covenant; not only the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and his Party, very dili∣gently <MILESTONE N="40"/> visited them, and perform'd all offices of respect towards them, but even the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Faction, and they who were most sollicitous to raise the War, attended them as officiously as others, and made the same professions to preserve the Peace and Amity between the two Nations.</P>
<P>THAT rigid Party of the Clergy which so adored the Covenant in the strictest sense of the Letter, that they did not desire to have any more dependence upon the King, but in effect to lay him aside, and to settle the Government without him, as their Brethren in <HI>England</HI> had resolv'd to do, were never from them, and willingly receiv'd such Presents and <MILESTONE N="50"/> Pensions from the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners, as they were prepared and provided to offer to them; and much Money was given to make them fast Friends. By this means nothing was resolv'd, or proposed in the most
<PB N="100" REF="1200"/>
secret Councils, that was not forthwith imparted, and made known to them; and they behaved themselves as haughtily and imperiously, as if they had their Army at hand to second them. They took notice of the resort of so many <HI>English</HI> to <HI>Edenborough,</HI> and that there were many amongst them who had been in Armes against the Parliament, and de∣manded <Q>“that they might either be banished that Kingdom, or deliver'd” to them to be sent to the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>THEY were so clamourous in this Argument, and found so much countenance to their clamour, that they who had invited the <HI>English</HI> thither, had not the Courage to own them; but advised them under∣hand, <MILESTONE N="10"/> <Q>“to absent themselves from the Town, till that storm should be” over.</Q> And even S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave,</HI> whom, over and above all the discourses held with them at <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Lords had sent to confer with as they passed through the Northern parts homewards, and had then conferr'd with them, and desired them <Q>“to prepare all things with their Friends for the surprisal of <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Carlisle,</HI> when the Season should be ripe; and that they would hasten their Journey into <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they might be out of danger” of imprisonment;</Q> <Q>even these Men were desired, “either to withdraw again from <HI>Edenborough,</HI> or to keep their Chambers there, and not <MILESTONE N="20"/> to be seen abroad, until their Army should be raised, and such a Ge∣neral” made choice of as would take care of their Protection.</Q> And they did not conceal from them, that they made no doubt but that Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> should be that General; who often conferr'd with them in private, and allways assured them, <Q>“that whatever was, in that place and season, discoursed of the Covenant, which was very necessary to bring their designs to pass, he should be no sooner invested in the Com∣mand his Friends design'd for him, than he would manifest his reso∣lution to joyn with the King's Party, upon the true Interest of the” Crown,</Q> without which he would hope for little success in <HI>England:</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> and he desired them, <Q>“though they saw little appearance yet of raising an Army, which would be assoon finished as begun, by the method they were accustom'd to use, that they would write very earnestly to their Friends in <HI>England</HI> to begin, assoon as might be, to execute the designs they had laid, in as many parts of the Kingdom as they could, upon confidence that they should receive relief before they could be oppressed. To the same purpose they writ to the Queen, and desired that the Prince might be in a readiness to be with them against the time their Army should be ready to march; which, they assured her,” should be by the beginning of <HI>May.</HI></Q> All which several Advertise∣ments, <MILESTONE N="40"/> being communicated in <HI>England,</HI> found a People too ready to give credit to what was promised, and to begin the work sooner than they ought to have done; and yet they were hasten'd by such Accidents, as, in truth, made their appearance even necessary.</P>
<P>THE King, whilst he was at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, when he foresaw that the Army would not comply with him, as he once believ'd, and re∣solv'd to get themselves out of their hands, had, as is mention'd before, directed the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who was of years to be trusted with the se∣cret, <Q>“that, when a fit opportunity should be offer'd, he should make his Escape into the parts beyond the Seas, and follow the directions of” <MILESTONE N="50"/> his Mother: and about this time,</Q> when so much Action was expected, which probably might produce many alterations, his Majesty, in all places, found some way to advertise the Duke, <Q>“that it would be a very”
<PB N="101" REF="1210"/>
proper Season for him to make his Escape.</Q> The Person who was en∣trusted to contrive it was Colonel <HI>Bamfield,</HI> a Man of an active and in∣sinuating Nature, and dextrous enough in bringing any thing to pass that he had the managing of himself. He had now no relation to the King's Service; he had serv'd the King in the late War as a Colonel of Foot, and had not behaved himself so well in it, as to draw any suspi∣cion upon himself from the other Party, and was in truth much more conversant with the Presbyterian Party than with the King's. So that his repair often to the place where the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and the other Chil∣dren were, drew nothing of suspicion upon him. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE Duke and his Brother and Sister were then kept at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Escape of the Duke of</HI> York <HI>beyond Sea from S<SUP>t</SUP></HI> James<HI>'s.</HI></NOTE> where they had the liberty of the Garden and Park to walk and exercise themselves in, and Lords, and Ladies, and other Persons of condition, were not restrain'd from resorting thither to visit them. In this manner <HI>Bamfield</HI> had been sometimes there; and after he had inform'd the Duke what he was to do, and found one or two more to be trusted between them, that he might not become suspected by being observ'd to speak too often with him, he provided a small Vessel to be ready about the Custom House, and to have its Pass for <HI>Holland,</HI> and then advertised the Duke to be ready in the close of an Evening, when playing, as he used <MILESTONE N="20"/> to do, with the other Children, in a Room from whence there was a pair of Stairs to the Garden, he might, untaken notice of, get thither; from whence there was a door into the Park; where <HI>Bamfield</HI> would meet him. And this was so well adjusted, that the Duke came at the hour to the place; where the other met him, and led him presently where a Coach was ready, and so carried him into a private House; where he only stayed whilst he put on Women's Apparel, that was pro∣vided for him; and presently, with Colonel <HI>Bamfield</HI> only, went into a pair of Oares that was ready; so passed the Bridge, and went on board the Vessel that was ready to receive him; which immediately hoisted <MILESTONE N="30"/> Sail, and arriv'd safe in <HI>Holland,</HI> without any Man of the Ship having the least imagination what freight they carried.</P>
<P>THE Duke, assoon as he was on Shore, and in a lodging, resolving no longer to use his Womans habit, stayed there till he advertised his Sister, the Princess Royal of <HI>Orange,</HI> of his arrival; who quickly took care to provide all such things as were necessary for his remove to the <HI>Hague;</HI> from whence the Queen was inform'd, and so knew assoon all∣most where he was, as she did of his escape from <HI>London.</HI> The Prince was not yet ready for his remove, nor was it resolv'd which way he should go; so that it was thought best that the Duke should, for the <MILESTONE N="40"/> present, stay at the <HI>Hague</HI> with his Sister, till farther resolutions might be taken; and though the Service which <HI>Bamfield</HI> had perform'd, was very well esteem'd, yet they thought the making him a Groom of his Bed-Chamber, would be an ample recompence, and that it was neces∣sary to put a Person of a better Quality about his Highness, who might have a superior Command over the other Servants; and because the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> who had been made Governour of the Duke of <HI>York</HI> by the King, was then in <HI>England,</HI> secretly attending the conjuncture to appear in Armes in a quarter assign'd to him, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley</HI> was sent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Berk∣ley <HI>made his Highness's Governour in the absence of the Lord</HI> By∣ron.</NOTE> by the Queen to wait upon the Duke, as Governour in the absence of <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> which <HI>Bamfield</HI> looked upon as a degradation, and bringing the Man he hated of all Men living, to have the command over him.</P>

THE Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> who was in the most secret part of all these In∣trigues in <HI>England,</HI> being entirely trusted by those who would not trust any of the Presbyterians nor communicate their purposes to them, had written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who remain'd still in <HI>Jersy,</HI> the hopes he had of a good conjuncture, and his own resolution to em∣bark himself in that attempt, assoon as it should be ripe; and had signi∣fied the King's Command to him, <Q>“that assoon as the Chancellor should be required to wait upon the Prince, he should without delay obey” the Summons: and the King had likewise writ to the Queen very po∣sitively,</Q> <Q>“that when it should be necessary for the Prince to remove out <MILESTONE N="10"/> of <HI>France,</HI> the Chancellor should have notice of it, and be required to give his attendance upon the Person of his Royal Highness, in the” condition he had formerly done.</Q> About the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> in the year 1648, the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> who had allways corresponded with the Chancellor, and inform'd him of the State of Affairs, and all that con∣cern'd himself, writ to him, <Q>“that all things were now so ripe, that he believ'd the Prince would not find it fit to remain longer in <HI>France;</HI> and thereupon conjured him that he would be ready, if he should be sent for, as he was confident he would be, to attend upon his High∣ness;”</Q> which, he said, all the King's Friends expected he should do; and <MILESTONE N="20"/> which he was resolv'd to do assoon as the Prince should be out of <HI>France,</HI> though he should receive no order or invitation so to do.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of <HI>May,</HI> the Queen, according to his Majesties <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancel∣lor of the Ex∣chequer sent for to the Prince from</HI> Jersy.</NOTE> Command, sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to <HI>Jersy,</HI> command∣ing <Q>“”that he would wait upon the Prince in the <HI>Louvre</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI></Q> upon a day that was past before the Letter came to his hands. But he no sooner receiv'd the Summons, than he betook himself to the Journey, and to transport himself into <HI>Normandy;</HI> where, after he was landed, he made what hast he could to <HI>Caen,</HI> supposing he should there find Se∣cretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who had given him notice, <Q>“that he had receiv'd the” <MILESTONE N="30"/> same Command.</Q> When he came to <HI>Caen,</HI> he found the Secretary's Lady there, but himself was gone to <HI>Roan,</HI> to the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and intended to stay there till the other should arrive, and to consult toge∣ther there upon their farther Journey. The old Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> who had liv'd likewise at <HI>Caen,</HI> was gone with the Secretary to <HI>Roan,</HI> having likewise receiv'd the same Summons with the others to attend the Prince at the <HI>Louvre.</HI> The Chancellor hasten'd to <HI>Roan,</HI> where he found the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> who had still the title and precedency of Lord High Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who were all his very good Friends, and very glad of his arrival. They had <MILESTONE N="40"/> receiv'd Advertisement, the day before, <Q>“that the Prince, with all his” small Train, was passed by towards <HI>Calais;</HI></Q> <Q>and direction was sent “that the Chancellor, whom they supposed to be on the way, and the rest, should stay at <HI>Roan,</HI> till they should receive new Orders from <HI>Calais,”</HI> where his Royal Highness would take new measures what he was to do.</Q> So they stayed together at <HI>Roan,</HI> where there were at the same time very many <HI>English</HI> of Quality in their own condition, who were driven out of <HI>England,</HI> as well as they, for their fidelity to the King, and had brought somewhat with them for their support abroad, till they might upon some good change return to their own Country. In the mean <MILESTONE N="50"/> time they liv'd very decently together in that City; where they were well esteem'd. The way between <HI>Roan</HI> and <HI>Calais</HI> was so dangerous with∣out a very strong Convoy, that no day passed without robberies and
<PB N="103" REF="1230"/>
murthers, so that they were glad of their Order not to stir from thence, till they should receive a very particular direction from the Prince; and within few days they receiv'd advice, <Q>“that the Prince had, assoon as he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince went into</HI> Holland <HI>from</HI> Calais.</NOTE> came to <HI>Calais,</HI> put himself on board a Ship that he found there bound for <HI>Holland,</HI> whence they were to hear from him, how they should” dispose of themselves.</Q> Whereupon they all resolv'd to remove from <HI>Roan</HI> to <HI>Diep,</HI> from whence they might embark themselves for <HI>Holland</HI> if they saw cause; the ways by Land, in regard that both the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Armies were in the Field, being very dangerous. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE Prince's remove from <HI>Paris</HI> on such a suddain, proceeded from <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Revolt of part of the Fleet to the King from</HI> Rains∣borough.</NOTE> an Accident in <HI>England</HI> that was very extraordinary, and looked like a call from Heaven. The Parliament about this time had prepared, ac∣cording to custom, a good Fleet of ten or a dozen Ships for the Summer Guard, and appointed <HI>Rainsborough</HI> to be Admiral thereof; who had been bred at Sea, and was the Son of an eminent Commander at Sea lately dead; but he himself, from the time of the new Model, had been an Officer of Foot in the Army, and was a Colonel of special note and account, and of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s chief confidents. This offended the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> much, and disposed him to that inclination to concur with his Brother lately mention'd. Captain <HI>Batten</HI> likewise was as much un∣satisfied, <MILESTONE N="20"/> who had acted a great part in the first alienating the Fleet, and the Affections of the Seamen from the King, and had ever been their Vice-Admiral afterwards, and one of the Persons upon whom they prin∣cipally relied at Sea. <HI>Rainsborough,</HI> as long as he remain'd in the Navy, had been under his Command, and both the Earl and <HI>Batten</HI> well knew that this Man was now made Admiral of this Fleet, because they, be∣ing Presbyterians, should have no credit or influence upon it; which made them sollicitous enough that the Seamen should not be well pleased with the Alteration; and They looked upon <HI>Rainsborough</HI> as a Man that had forsaken them, and preferr'd the Land before the Sea Service. The <MILESTONE N="30"/> Seamen are in a manner a Nation by themselves, a humerous, brave, and sturdy People; fierce, and resolute in whatsoever they are inclined to, somewhat unsteady and inconstant in pursuing it, and jealous of those to morrow by whom they are govern'd to day. These Men, ob∣serving the general discontent of the People, and that, however the Par∣liament was obeyed by the power of the Army, both Army and Parlia∣ment were grown very odious to the Nation, and hearing so much dis∣course of an Army from <HI>Scotland</HI> ready to enter into the Kingdom, concluded that the King would be restored; and then remembring that the revolt of the Fleet was the preamble to the loss of his Majesties Au∣thority <MILESTONE N="40"/> every where else, and a great cause of all his misfortunes, thought it would be a glorious thing to them, if they could lead the way to his Majesties Restoration by their declaring for him. This was an Agitation among the Common Seamen, without communicating it to any Officer of the Quality of Master of a Ship. This inclination was much improv'd in them by a general disposition in <HI>Kent</HI> to an Insurrection for the King, and by some Gentlemen's coming on board the Ships, according to the custom of that Country; who fomented the good disposition in the Sea∣men by all the ways they could.</P>
<P>AT this very time there appear'd generally throughout <HI>Kent</HI> the same <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commotions in</HI> Kent <HI>for the King</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> indigested Affection to the King, and inclination to serve him, as was among the Seamen, and was conducted with much less order and cau∣tion, neither the one nor the other having been design'd by those who
<PB N="104" REF="1240"/>
took care of the King's Affairs, and who design'd those Insurrections which happen'd in other parts of the Kingdom. They knew nothing, that is, contributed nothing to this good disposition in the Seamen, though they were not without some hope that, upon all other Revolu∣tions, somewhat might likewise fall out at Sea to the advantage of the King's Affairs. They had some expectation indeed from <HI>Kent,</HI> where they knew the People were generally well affected, and depended upon two or three Gentlemen of that Country, who had been Officers in the King's Army, and resolv'd to bring in some Troops of Horse, when oc∣casion should be ripe; but it was resolv'd and intended that the <HI>Scots</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> Army should be enter'd the Kingdom, by which the Parliament Army would be upon their March towards them, before they would have any appearance of force in the parts near <HI>London;</HI> and then they believ'd that both Country and City would rise together. And so those Gentle∣men of <HI>Kent,</HI> who were privy to any design, lay privately in <HI>London</HI> to avoid all Cabals in their Country; so that what now fell out there, was by meer chance and accident, that could never be foreseen, or pre∣vented.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd to be at some jovial meeting in <HI>Kent</HI> about that time, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>L'Estrange</HI> a younger Brother of a good Family in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> who had been allways of the King's Party, and for attempting somewhat in his own Country for his Majesties Service, had been taken Prisoner by the Parliament, and by a Court of War condemn'd to dye, but be∣ing kept in Prison till the end of the War, was then set at Liberty, as one in whom there was no more danger. But he retain'd his old Af∣fections, and more remember'd the cruel usage he had receiv'd, than that they had not proceeded as cruelly with him as they might have done. He had a great Friendship with a young Gentleman, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hales,</HI> who liv'd in <HI>Kent,</HI> and was Married to a Lady of a Noble Birth and Fortune, he being Heir to one of the greatest Fortunes of that Country, <MILESTONE N="30"/> but was to expect the Inheritance from the favour of an old severe Grandfather, who for the present kept the young couple from running into any excess; the Mother of the Lady being of as sour and strict a Nature as the Grandfather, and both of them so much of the Parliament Party, that they were not willing any part of their Estates should be hazarded for the King. At the House of this M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hales,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>L'Estrange</HI> was, when by the communication which that part of <HI>Kent</HI> allways hath with the Ships which lye in the <HI>Downs,</HI> the report first did arise that the Fleet would presently declare for the King, and those Seamen who came on Shore talked as if the City of <HI>London</HI> would joyn with them. <MILESTONE N="40"/> This drew many Gentlemen of the Country who wished well, to visit the Ships, and they return'd more confirm'd of the truth of what they had heard. Good fellowship was a Vice spread every where, and this young great Heir, who had been allways bred among his Neighbours, affected that which they were best pleased with, and so his House was a Rendezvous for those who delighted in that Exercise, and who every day brought him the news of the good inclinations in the Fleet for the King; and all Men's Mouths were full of the general hatred the whole Kingdom had against the Parliament as well as the Army. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>L'Estrange</HI> was a Man of a good Wit, and a fancy very luxuriant, and of an enter∣prising <MILESTONE N="50"/> Nature. He observ'd, by the good company that came to the House, that the Affections of all that large and populous Country were for the King. <Q>He begun to tell M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hales,</HI> “that though his Grandfather

did in his heart wish the King well, yet his carriage had been such in his conjunction with the Parliament, that he had more need of the King's favour than of his Grandfather's to be Heir to that great Estate; and that certainly nothing could be more acceptable to his Grandfa∣ther,” or more glorious to Him, than to be the Instrument of both;</Q> and therefore advised him <Q>“to put himself into the head of his own Country, which would be willing to be led by him, that when the <HI>Scots</HI> were enter'd into the Northern parts, and all the Kingdom should be in Armes, he might, with the Body of his Country-men, march towards <HI>London;</HI> which would induce both the City and the Parlia∣ment <MILESTONE N="10"/> to joyn with him, whereby he should have great share in the” honour of Restoring the King.</Q></P>
<P>THE Company that frequented the House thought the discourse ve∣ry reasonable, and saw that the issue must be very honourable: the young Lady of the House was full of Zeal for the King, and was willing her Husband should be the Instrument of his delivery: the young Gen∣tleman himself had not been enough conversant in the Affairs of the world to apprehend the danger, or hazard of the Attempt, and so re∣ferr'd himself and the whole Business to be govern'd, and conducted by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>L'Estrange,</HI> whom they all believ'd by his discourse to be an able <MILESTONE N="20"/> Soldier. He writ some Letters to particular Gentlemen, who he was inform'd would receive them willingly, and sign'd Warrants to the Con∣stables of hundreds with his own Name, which had been never heard of in the Country, requiring, <Q>“in his Majesties name, all Persons to appear, at a time and place appointed, to advise together, and to lay hold on such opportunities, as should be offer'd for relieving the King and de∣livering” him out of Prison.</Q> There was an incredible appearance of the Country at the place appointed, where M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>L'Estrange</HI> appear'd with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hales,</HI> and those Persons which had been used to their Company. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>L'Estrange</HI> spoke to them in a style very much his own; and being <MILESTONE N="30"/> not very clear to be understood, the more prevailed over them. He spake like a Man in Authority, inveighed against <Q>“the Tyranny of the Army, which had subdued the Parliament, against their barbarous im∣prisonment of the King, and against a conspiracy they had to murther” him.</Q> He added <Q>“that the Affections of that noble Country were well known to his Majesty, and that he had therefore appointed the Fleet that was in the <HI>Downs</HI> to joyn with them; and that he doubted not but they would together be too strong for his Enemies, who were like to have enough to do to defend themselves in many other places; and that his Majesty was willing they should have a Gentleman of their” <MILESTONE N="40"/> own Country, well known to them, to be their General;</Q> and named M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hales;</HI> who was present. There was not one Man who so much as asked for any Letter or Commission, or other Authority from the King; <Q>but all of them, very frankly and unanimously, declared “they would” be ready to joyn, and march as their General <HI>Hales</HI> should direct;</Q> and so another day and place was appointed for another appearance, and list∣ing and forming their Regiments; and in the mean time M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>L'Estrange</HI> set out such Declarations, and Engagements, as he thought most like to prevail with the People, <Q>and required “that they should be read in” all Churches; which was done accordingly.</Q> The next appearance was <MILESTONE N="50"/> greater than the former; and with the same forwardness, many coming Armed both Horse and Foot, and shewing a marvellous alacrity to the Engagement. Their General then gave out his Commissions for several
<PB N="106" REF="1260"/>
Regiments, and a new day was appointed for their Rendezvous, when all should come Armed, and keep together in a Body, until it should be fit to march to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>IT was known that the Fleet was gone out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> but it was as well known that it had absolutely renounced the Service of the Par∣liament, and rejected all their Officers. It was easy to perswade the Peo∣ple, that they were gone upon some important Enterprise, and would speedily return; and it was insinuated, <Q>“that it was gone to the Isle of” <HI>Wight</HI> to release the King, who would return with it into <HI>Kent;</HI></Q> which made them hasten their preparations. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>AT the time when the King made the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> Ad∣miral, he declared, and it was inserted in his Commission, <Q>“that he” should enjoy that Office during the Minority of the Duke of <HI>York;</HI></Q> and the Duke having made his Escape at this time, when there was this Commotion amongst the Seamen, it was no sooner known that his High∣ness was in <HI>Holland,</HI> but the Seamen talked aloud <Q>“that they would go” to their Admiral;</Q> and the Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI> stirring them up and in∣flaming them to that resolution, and the Seamen again pressing the Gen∣tlemen to hasten their rising in Armes, that they might assist and se∣cond each other, they both declared themselves sooner than they ought <MILESTONE N="20"/> to have done, and before they were prepared for an Enterprise of that importance.</P>
<P>THE Parliament was well inform'd of the distemper amongst the Sea∣men, and had therefore forborne putting the half of the Provisions aboard the Ships, which, for the greatest part, lay ready in the <HI>Downs,</HI> wanting only half the Victual they were to have for the Summer Ser∣vice. But those Officers which were on board, finding they had no Au∣thority, and that the Seamen mocked and laughed at them, sent every day to inform the Parliament, what mutinous humour the whole Fleet was in. Whereupon they sent <HI>Rainsborough</HI> and some other Officers <MILESTONE N="30"/> thither; presuming that the presence of the Admiral would quickly quiet all. He, being a Man of a rough imperious Nature, assoon as he came on board his Ship, begun to make a strict Enquiry into the for∣mer disorders and mutinous behaviour, upon which all the Men of his Ship retired into their old Fortress of One and All, and presently laid hold on him, and put Him, and such other Officers of the Ship as they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rainsborough <HI>and some other Officers put on Shore by the Seamen.</HI></NOTE> liked not, into the Boat, and sent them on Shore. Which was no sooner known to the rest of the Ships, but they followed their example, and used Their Officers in the same manner. After they had for some days been feasted and caressed by the People of <HI>Kent,</HI> some of the Gentlemen <MILESTONE N="40"/> putting themselves on board to joyn with them, and in order to assist them towards providing such necessaries as were wanting, they went out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> and stood for <HI>Holland,</HI> that they might find their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The revolted Ships went over to</HI> Hol∣land.</NOTE> Admiral; and let fall their Anchors before the <HI>Brill.</HI> What was done by the Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI> on Shore, and the success thereof, will be related hereafter.</P>
<P>THIS so very seasonable revolt of the Fleet, in a conjuncture when so many Advantages were expected, was looked upon as a sure Omen of the deliverance of the King. And the report that the Ships were be∣fore <HI>Calais,</HI> as if they had expected some Body there, which was true, <MILESTONE N="50"/> for some time, was the reason that it was thought fit that the Prince (who had hitherto thought of nothing but being sent for by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and how to find himself with them) should make all possible hast to
<PB N="107" REF="1270"/>
<HI>Calais.</HI> This was the Cause of that his suddain motion, which was yet retarded for want of Money, and all other things necessary for his Jour∣ney. The Cardinal shewed no manner of favouring all these Appearances of Advantage to the King; he gave less countenance to <HI>Scotland,</HI> than he had ever done when it was in Rebellion against the King; and, not∣withstanding all his promises with reference to <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> remain'd still at <HI>Paris,</HI> without obtaining Armes or Money in any proportion (both which had been promised so liberally) and was, after all importunities, compelled to transport himself into <HI>Ireland</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>goes out of</HI> France <HI>into</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> (where he was so importunately called for) without any manner of Sup∣plies, <MILESTONE N="10"/> which were expected. And now, when the remove of the Prince was so behoveful, the Cardinal utterly refused to furnish him with any Money; all which discountenances were shortly after remember'd to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> as high merit.</P>
<P>THE Prince's remove was by every Body thought so necessary, that the Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> as was pretended, found means to borrow so much Money as was necessary for the Journey; which the King paid long af∣ter with full Interest. D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Goffe,</HI> a Man well known in that time, as the chief Agent and Confident of my Lord <HI>Jermin,</HI> was presently sent into <HI>Holland,</HI> to dispose the Seamen to be willing to receive the Lord <HI>Jer∣min</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> to Command the Fleet. So sollicitous that Noble Man was to be in the head of any Action that was like to prosper, how unfit soever he was for it; having neither industry, nor knowledge of any thing of the Sea, and being less belov'd by the Seamen than any Man that could be named. The Prince made what hast he could to <HI>Calais,</HI> attended by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and some other Gentlemen, besides his own Domesticks; and finding one of the <HI>English</HI> Frigats before <HI>Calais,</HI> and understanding that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was gone from the <HI>Hague</HI> to <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> and had put himself on board the Fleet there, his Highness presently embarked, and made the <MILESTONE N="30"/> more hast lest his Brother should be in Action before him, and was re∣ceiv'd at the Fleet with all those acclamations and noises of joy, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince is receiv'd at the Fleet.</NOTE> that People are accustom'd to; they having expressed as much some days before, at the arrival of the Duke of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>ASSOON as it was known in <HI>Holland</HI> that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was arriv'd, the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with his Wife the Princess Royal, came presently thither to entertain his Highness the best that place would permit, but especially to rejoyce together, having not seen each other from the time they were Children. The Prince found the Fleet in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in the Prince's Fleet.</NOTE> Faction and Disorder, and great pains had been taken to corrupt them. <MILESTONE N="40"/> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley</HI>'s coming to the <HI>Hague</HI> to Assume the Government of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> had not been acceptable to his Royal Highness; who was perswaded by Colonel <HI>Bamfield,</HI> that he had been unfaithful, as well as unfortunate, in his attendance upon the King to the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI> The Colonel himself was so incensed with it, that he used all the skill and insinuation he had, to lessen his Highness's reverence to the Queen, and to dispute her Commands. Then taking the opportunity of the Fleet's being come to <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> he went thither, and having, as is said before, a wonderful Address to the disposing Men to mutiny, and to work upon Common Men, which the Fleet consisted of, there being <MILESTONE N="50"/> no Officers, for the most part, above the quality of a Boatswaine or Master's Mate, he perswaded them <Q>“to declare for the Duke of <HI>York,”</HI> without any respect to the King or Prince;</Q> and when his Highness
<Q><PB N="108" REF="1280"/>
“should be on board, that they should not meddle in the quarrel be∣tween the King and the Parliament, but entirely joyn with the Pres∣byterian Party, and the City of <HI>London;</HI> which by this means would” bring the Parliament to reason:</Q> and he prepared his Friends the Sea∣men when the Duke should come to them, that they would except against S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley,</HI> and cause him to be dismissed; and then he be∣liev'd he should be able to govern both his Highness and the Fleet.</P>
<P>AT the same time D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Goffe,</HI> who was a dextrous Man too, and could comply with all Men in all the Acts of good fellowship, had gotten ac∣quaintance with others of the Seamen, and made them jealous of <HI>Bam∣field</HI>'s <MILESTONE N="10"/> activity; and endeavour'd to perswade them <Q>“that they should all Petition the Prince (who, he knew, would be shortly with them) that the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> might be made their Admiral; who would be able to supply them with Money, and whatsoever else they wanted: that there was no hope of Money but from <HI>France,</HI> and that the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> had all the power and credit there, and might have what Mo∣ney” he desired;</Q> and by these Agitations, the infant Loyalty of the Seamen begun to be distracted.</P>
<P>AT the same time the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham,</HI> who had allways adhered to the Presbyterians, and was of great esteem amongst them, <MILESTONE N="20"/> though he was not tainted with their principles, had left the Parlia∣ment, and secretly transported himself into <HI>Holland;</HI> and was arrived at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> when <HI>Bamfield</HI> return'd from the Fleet, and went to wait upon the Duke of <HI>York</HI> at the <HI>Hague. Bamfield</HI> deliver'd such a Message from the Fleet as he thought would hasten the Duke's Journey thither; and told him, <Q>“the Seamen made great enquiry after the Lord” <HI>Willoughby,</HI> and much longed to have him with them;</Q> insinuating to the Duke, <Q>“that he had much contributed to that good disposition in the Seamen, and was privy to their revolt, and had promised speedi∣ly to come to them, and that it would be the most acceptable thing <MILESTONE N="30"/> his Highness could do to carry him with him to the Fleet, and make” him his Vice-Admiral.</Q> The Duke made all imaginable hast to <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> and immediately went on board the Admiral; where he was re∣ceiv'd with the usual marks of joy and acclamation. He declared the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> his Vice-Admiral, and appointed some other Officers in the several Ships, and seem'd very desirous to be out at Sea. In the mean time <HI>Bamfield</HI> continued his Activity; and the Doctor, finding he had little hope to raise his Patron to the heigth he proposed, did all he could to hinder the Operation of <HI>Bamfield,</HI> and took all the ways he could that the Prince might be advertised of it, and thereupon hasten <MILESTONE N="40"/> his own Journey; which did likewise contribute to the hast his Highness made. He arriv'd at <HI>Helvoet Sluce</HI> very seasonably to prevent many in∣conveniencies, which would have inevitably fallen out; and the Seamen, upon his Highness's appearance, return'd again into their old chearful humour; which the Prince knew would be best preserv'd by Action; and therefore exceedingly desired to be at Sea, where he was sure he must be Superior to any Force the Parliament could in a short time put out. But the Fleet already wanted many Provisions, of which Beer was the chief; which, by the countenance and assistance of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> was in a short time procured in a reasonable proportion; and then the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Prince set sail first for <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road, then for the <HI>Downs;</HI> having <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince comes into the</HI> Downs <HI>with the Fleet.</HI></NOTE> sent his Brother, the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> with all his Family to the <HI>Hague,</HI> to remain there.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="1290"/>
THOUGH the Duke was exceedingly troubled to leave the Fleet, which he had been perswaded to look upon as his Province, yet he could not but acknowledge, that right reason would not permit they should both be ventur'd at one time on board the Fleet; and, the Prince deter∣mining to engage his own Person, he submitted to the determination; and was well content to remain with his Sister. The Prince did not think fit to remove the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> (who, he knew, was much relied upon by the Presbyterian Party) from the Charge the Duke had given him; though he was not much known to the Seamen. But Captain <HI>Batten</HI> coming at the same time when his Highness did to the Fleet, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and bringing the <HI>Constant Warwick,</HI> one of the best Frigats the Parlia∣ment had built, with <HI>Jordan,</HI> and two or three Seamen of good Com∣mand, his Highness knighted him, and made him Rere Admiral of the Fleet; believing, that he could not do a more popular and acceptable thing to the Seamen, than by putting the same Man, who had Com∣manded them so many years, over them again at this time; whose ex∣perience and government would supply the defects and want of skill of the Vice-Admiral, who was very willing to be advised by him. But the Prince shortly after found he was mistaken in that expedient, and that the Seamen (who defired to serve the King upon the clear principles of <MILESTONE N="20"/> obedience, and loyalty) did not in any degree affect <HI>Batten,</HI> because he had failed in both, and was now of a Party towards which they had no veneration. The truth is, the Prince came prepared and disposed from the Queen, to depend wholely upon the Presbyterian Party, which, be∣sides the power of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, which was every day expected to invade <HI>England,</HI> was thought to be possessed of all the strength of the City of <HI>London;</HI> and the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long,</HI> the Prince's Secretary, were trusted by the Queen to keep the Prince steady and fast to that dependence; and his Highness was injoyn'd to be entirely advised by them; though all the other Lords about him were of another mind, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and the Prince himself not inclined that way. D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Steward,</HI> the Dean of the King's Chappel, whom his Majesty had recommended to his Son to instruct him in all matters relating to the Church, and D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Earles,</HI> and the rest of his Chaplains, waited diligently upon him to prevent those Infusions. But, by those two, the benefit of this Fleet was principally consider'd, as a happy means to put the Prince on Shore, that he might be in the head of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; and no doubt if that Army had been then enter'd into <HI>England,</HI> as it was very shortly after, the Prince would have been directed, with the Fleet, <Q>“to have followed all the advice” which should have been sent from the <HI>Scots.</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>IN the mean time it was thought most counselable, after the Prince had sailed some days about the Coast, that the Kingdom might generally know that his Highness was there, that they should all go into the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and lye still there; by which they expected two great Ad∣vantages; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence into the River of</HI> Thames.</NOTE> first, that the City would be thereby engaged to declare it self, when they saw all their Trade obstructed; and that their Ships home∣wards bound, of which, at that Season of the year, they expected many, must fall into the Prince's hands; and then, that the presence of the Prince in the River would hinder the Parliament from getting Seamen, and from setting out that Fleet which they were preparing to reduce the <MILESTONE N="50"/> other, under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> whom they thought fit, in this exigent, again to imploy; and who, by accepting the Charge, thought he should be in a better posture to choose his Party, in any other alteration that should happen at Land.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="1300"/>
<Q>WHEN the Parliament first heard of the Commotion in <HI>Kent,</HI> and saw the Warrants which were sent out and sign'd by <HI>L'Estrange,</HI> whom no body knew (and the Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI> who sate in the Parlia∣ment, assured them, “”that there was no such Gentleman in that County;</Q> <Q>and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> who likewise was present there, told them, “he was very confident that his Grandson could not be embarked in such” an Affair) they neglected it, and thought it a design to amuse them.</Q> But when they heard that the meetings were continued, and saw the De∣clarations which were published, and were well assured that young <HI>Hales</HI> appear'd with them as their General, they thought the matter worth <MILESTONE N="10"/> their care; <Q>and therefore appointed their General, “to send two or three” Troops of Horse into <HI>Kent</HI> to suppress that seditious Insurrection;</Q> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Hales</HI> now excusing himself with revilings, threats, and de∣testation of his Grandson; who, he protested, should never be his Heir.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who had a Commission to be General, and the rest who were engaged, were not yet ready, the <HI>Scots</HI> being not yet enter'd; nor did they understand any thing of the business of <HI>Kent;</HI> <Q>however when they were assured that they were drawn into a Body, and were so strong that the Officers who commanded the Troops which had been sent to suppress them, had sent to the Parliament word, “that <MILESTONE N="20"/> they durst not advance, for that the Enemy was much stronger than they, and increased daily; and that they had sent a Letter to the City” of <HI>London</HI> inviting them to joyn with them;</Q> the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> I say, and the others with him, thought it fit to send them all the coun∣tenance, and encouragement they could; and thereupon dispatched those Officers who had been design'd for the Troops of that County, when the Season should be ripe, and who had hitherto lurked private∣ly in <HI>London</HI> to avoid suspicion. They were desired to call their Friends together, assoon as was possible, to joyn with their neighbours; <Q>and were told “that they should very shortly receive a General from the” <MILESTONE N="30"/> King:</Q> for they did not think M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hales</HI> equal to the work, who found his power and credit to grow less, the greater the appearance grew to be; and they begun to enquire for the King's Commission. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> had form'd his Party of many Officers who had serv'd both the King and the Parliament; all which were in the City; and he had not yet a mind to call them together, but to expect the appearance of their Northern Friends, and therefore consulting with the rest, and finding the Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> who had been some Months in <HI>England</HI> under a Pass from the Parliament (upon pretence of making his com∣position, from which he had never been excluded) willing to engage <MILESTONE N="40"/> himself in the conduct of those in <HI>Kent,</HI> where he was well known and belov'd, his affection and zeal for the King's Service being not to be doubted, they resolv'd that he should go thither; <Q>and there being many blank Commissions ready to be disposed as the Service should require, they filled one with His name, by which the Command of all <HI>Kent</HI> was committed to him, “with power to lead them any whither as the good” of the King's Service should make requisite.</Q> And with this Commission he made hast into <HI>Kent,</HI> and found at <HI>Maidstone</HI> a better Body of Horse and Foot Armed than could have been expected; enough in number to have met any Army that was like to be brought against them. They <MILESTONE N="50"/> all receiv'd him with wonderful Acclamations, and vowed obedience to him. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hales,</HI> upon the news of another General to be sent thither, and upon the storms of threats and rage which fell upon him from his
<PB N="111" REF="1310"/>
Grandfather, on the one side, and on his Wife by her Mother on the other side, and upon the conscience that he was not equal to the Charge, though his Affection was not in the least declined, found means to transport himself, and Wife, together with his Friend M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>L'Estrange,</HI> who had lost his credit with the People, into <HI>Holland;</HI> resolving, as∣soon as he had put his Wife out of the reach of her Mother, to return himself, and to venture his Person in the Service which he could not conduct; which he did quickly after very heartily endeavour to do.</P>
<P>THE importunities from <HI>Scotland</HI> with the Presbyterians their Cor∣respondents, the fame of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI>'s being well receiv'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> and that many <HI>English</HI> Officers and Soldiers daily flocked thither, but especially the promises from <HI>Paris</HI> of Supplies of Armes, Ammunition, and Money, assoon as they could expect it, set all the other Wheels going in <HI>England</HI> which had been preparing all the Winter. There were in South <HI>Wales</HI> Colonel <HI>Laughorn,</HI> Colonel <HI>Powell,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Poyer,</HI> who commanded those parts under the Parliament, which they had serv'd from the beginning: the first of them a Gentle∣man of a good Extraction, and a fair Fortune in Land in those Counties, who had been bred a Page under the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> when he had a Com∣mand in the Low Countries, and continued his dependence upon him <MILESTONE N="20"/> afterwards, and was much in his favour, and by that relation was first engaged in the Rebellion, as many other Gentlemen had been without wishing ill to the King: the second was a Gentleman too, but a Soldier of fortune: the third, had from a low Trade raised himself in the War to the reputation of a very diligent and stout Officer, and was at this time trusted by the Parliament with the Government of the Town and Castle of <HI>Pembroke.</HI> These three communicated their discontents to each other, and all thought themselves ill requited by the Parliament for the Service they had done, and that other Men, especially Colonel <HI>Mit∣ton,</HI> was preferr'd before them; and resolv'd to take the opportunity of <MILESTONE N="30"/> the <HI>Scots</HI> coming in, to declare for the King upon the Presbyterian Ac∣count. But <HI>Laughorn,</HI> who was not infected with any of those freaks, and doubted not to reduce the other two, when it should be time, to sober resolutions, would not engage till he first sent a confident to <HI>Paris</HI> to inform the Prince of what he had determin'd, and of what their wants consisted, which if not reliev'd, they should not be able to pursue their purpose, desiring to receive Orders for the time of their declaring, and Assurance that they should in time receive those Supplies they stood in need of. And the Lord <HI>Jermin</HI> sent him a promise under his hand, <Q>“that he should not fail of receiving all the things he had desired, before he” <MILESTONE N="40"/> could be pressed by the Enemy;</Q> and therefore conjured him, and his Friends, <Q>“forthwith to declare for the King; which he assured them would be of singular benefit, and advantage to his Majesties Service; since, upon the first notice of their having declared, the <HI>Scots</HI> Army” would be ready to march into <HI>England.</HI></Q> Hereupon they presently de∣clared, before they were provided to keep the Field for want of Am∣munition and Money, and when <HI>Pembroke</HI> was not supplied with Pro∣visions for above two Months; and were never thought of after.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Byron</HI> had been sent from <HI>Paris,</HI> upon the importunities from <HI>Scotland,</HI> to get as many to declare in <HI>England</HI> in several places, <MILESTONE N="50"/> as might distract the Army, and keep it from an entire Engagement against them; to dispose his old Friends about <HI>Chester</HI> and North <HI>Wales</HI> to appear assoon as might be: and he presently, with the help of Colonel
<PB N="112" REF="1320"/>
<HI>Robinson,</HI> possessed himself of the Island of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and disposed all North <HI>Wales</HI> to be ready to declare assoon as the <HI>Scots</HI> should enter the Kingdom. But that which was of most importance, and seem'd already to have brought the War even into the heart of <HI>England,</HI> was that some Gentlemen, who had formerly serv'd the King in the Garrison of <HI>Newark,</HI> and in the Northern Army, under S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> had (by a design consulted with him before his going into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and upon Orders receiv'd from him since, when he believ'd the <HI>Scots</HI> would be in a short time ready to begin their March) surprised the strong Castle of <HI>Pontfret</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> (which had a Garrison in it for the Parliament) <MILESTONE N="10"/> and grew presently so numerous, by the resort of Officers and Soldiers from the adjacent Counties, that they grew formidable to all those parts, and made the communication between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>York</HI> insecure, except it was with strong Troops. Upon which Argument of the sur∣prise of <HI>Pontfret,</HI> We shall enlarge hereafter, before We speak of the Tragick conclusion of this Enterprise. All Affairs were in this motion in <HI>England,</HI> before there was any appearance of an Army in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which they had promised should be ready to march by the beginning of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED as to the raising an Army in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the difficulties were <MILESTONE N="20"/> well nigh over, nor did they ever look upon that as a thing that would trouble them, but who should Command, and be General of this Army was the matter upon which the success of all they proposed would de∣pend; and if they could not procure Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> to be made choice of for that Service, they would promise themselves no good issue of the Undertaking. It was a hard thing to remove the old General <HI>Lesley,</HI> who had been hitherto in the head of their Army in all their prosperous Successes; but he was in the confidence of <HI>Argyle,</HI> which was objection enough against him, if there were no other; and the Man was grown old, and appear'd, in the Actions of the last Expedition into <HI>England,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> very unequal to the Command. And therefore some expedient was to be found to be rid of him; and they found it no hard matter to prevail with him to decline the Command, upon pretence of his Age and In∣firmities, when in truth he had no mind to venture his honour against the <HI>English,</HI> except assisted by <HI>English,</HI> which had been his good fortune in all the Actions of Moment he had perform'd in this War; and when he had been destitute of that help, he had allways receiv'd some Affront. When by this means there was a new General to be named, Duke <HI>Ha∣milton</HI> was proposed, as a fit Man to be imployed to redeem the honour of the Nation. He had formerly discharged the office of General under <MILESTONE N="40"/> the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> where <HI>Lesley,</HI> that had now declined the imploy∣ment, was Major General under him; and therefore could not be thought to be without ample experience of War.</P>
<P>WHILST this was depending, <HI>Argyle</HI> took notice of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI>'s, and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave</HI>'s being in the Town, and of some discourses which they had used, or some other <HI>English</HI> Officers in their Company, and desired <Q>“that, if they were to have any Command in the Army, they might presently take the Covenant; and that there might be a general Declaration, that there should be neither Officer nor Soldier receiv'd into their Army, before he had first taken the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Covenant; and that, after they were enter'd into the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> they should make no conjunction with any Forces, or Per∣sons,” who had not done, or should refuse to do the same.</Q> This proposal
<PB N="113" REF="1330"/>
found no opposition; they who were most forward to raise the Army for the delivery of the King, being as violent as any to advance that Declaration. And though Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and his Brother of <HI>Lanrick</HI> did as well disapprove it in their own judgements, as they did foresee, out of the long experience they had of <HI>England,</HI> what prejudice it would bring upon them there, yet they had not the Courage in any degree to speak against it; and the Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lau∣therdale</HI> were as passionate for the Advancement of it, as <HI>Argyle</HI> him∣self; and seem'd to think that those two Gentlemen either had already taken, or would be willing to take it. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>IT can hardly be believ'd, that, after so long knowledge of <HI>England,</HI> and their observation of whom the King's Party did consist, after their so often conferences with the King without prevailing upon him, in any degree, either to preserve himself at <HI>New-Castle</HI> from being deli∣ver'd up to the Parliament, or in their last agitation with him, when he yielded to so many unreasonable particulars to gratify them, to con∣sent to or promise, <Q>“that any Man should be compelled to take the” Covenant;</Q> that they should still adhere to that fatal Combination against the Church, which they could never hope to bring to pass, ex∣cept they intended only to change the hand, and to keep the King un∣der <MILESTONE N="20"/> as strict a restraint, when they should get him into Their hands, as he was under the domination of the Parliament and Army: yet they were so infatuated with this resolution, that they discovered their ap∣prehension of the King's Party, and design'd no less to oppress Them than the Independents, and Anabaptists; and upon the news of the re∣volt of the Fleet from the Parliament to the King, the Insurrection in <HI>Kent,</HI> and other Places, and the general Inclinations throughout the Kingdom for the King, they slacken'd their preparations, that they might defer their March, to the end that all that strength might be op∣pressed and reduced, that so they might be absolute Masters after they <MILESTONE N="30"/> had prevailed over the Army. And at last, when they could defer their March no longer, upon the importunate pressure of their Friends in <HI>London,</HI> they sent the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> with those insolent In∣structions, which will be mention'd anon, and positively required the Prince immediately to repair to them; <Q>declaring, “that if his Person should not be forthwith in their Army, they would return again into” <HI>Scotland</HI> without making any attempt;</Q> and the knowing this resolu∣tion, was the reason that the Queen was so positive in her Instructions, notwithstanding the appearance of any other Advantage to the King in <HI>England.</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>SIR <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> no sooner heard of this Declaration, than they went to those Lords, and expostulated very sharply with them, for <Q>“having broken their Faiths, and betrayed” them into their Country;</Q> where they were looked upon as Enemies. They were Answer'd, <Q>“that they must give over their design to redeem the King, or yield to this determination, which their Parliament was” so firm and united in;</Q> and would never depart from. And therefore they entreated them with all imaginable importunity, that they would take the Covenant; some of them defiring to confer with them upon it, and undertaking to satisfy them, that the Covenant did not include <MILESTONE N="50"/> those things in it, which they thought it did. But when they saw those Gentlemen would not be prevailed with, but that on the contrary they resolv'd presently to leave the Country; <Q>and told them, “they would
<PB N="114" REF="1340"/>
undeceive those honest People in <HI>England,</HI> who were too much in∣clined to trust them; and that they should find that they had a harder” work in hand than they imagined;</Q> the <HI>Scotish</HI> Lords knew well enough of what importance their presence was to be to them, for their very entrance into <HI>England;</HI> and thereupon desired them, <Q>“that they would have a little patience, and again absent themselves from <HI>Edenborough,</HI> till the heat of this dispute was over, and till the Army should be” ready to march;</Q> and Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who had a marvellous insinua∣tion to get himself believ'd, assured them in confidence, <Q>“that assoon as he should find himself in the head of his Army, and upon their <MILESTONE N="10"/> march, there should be no more talk of Covenants, but that all the” King's Friends should be welcome, and without distinction.</Q> So they left <HI>Edenborough</HI> again, and went to their old Quarters; where they had not stayed long, before the Duke sent for them to come to him in private; and, after a very chearful reception, he told them, <Q>“he was now ready; and that their Friends in <HI>England</HI> called so importunately for them, that he was resolv'd to march in very few days; which he thought necessary to communicate to them, not only for the Friend∣ship he had for them; which would allways keep him without reserve towards them; but because he must depend upon them two to surprise <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Towns of <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Carlisle,</HI> against the time he should be able to march thither; for he intended to march between those two” Places.</Q></P>
<P>THE work was not hard to be perform'd by them, they having, from their first entrance into <HI>Scotland,</HI> adjusted with their Friends who inhabited near those places, to be ready for that enterprise when they should be called upon; which they then believ'd would have been much sooner; so that they were willing to undertake it, and demanded Com∣missions from the Duke for the doing thereof; which he excused him∣self for not giving, under pretence of <Q>“the secrecy that was necessary; <MILESTONE N="30"/> in respect whereof he would not trust his own Secretary; and like∣wise, as a thing unnecessary for the work; since it was their own re∣putation and interest, and their being known to have been allways trusted by the King, by which they could bring it to pass, and not His” Commission;</Q> for which those Towns would have no reverence. Be∣sides, he told them, <Q>“that the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> had still protested against their beginning the War by any Act of Hostility against the <HI>English,</HI> in forcing any of the Towns; which was not necessary in or∣der to the King's deliverance; but that an Army might march to the place where the King was, to the end that those Messengers who were <MILESTONE N="40"/> sent by the State to speak with the King, might have liberty to speak with his Majesty; which was a Right of the Kingdom, and the de∣manding it could be no breach of the Pacification between the two” Kingdoms.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Argument, they knew, was not reasonable enough to sway the Duke. But they foresaw two other reasons, which did prevail with him not to give those Commissions they desired, which otherwise might have been given with the same secrecy that the business was to be acted with; the one, the Order against giving any Commission to any Man before he had taken the Covenant: And how much Authority soever <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Duke might take upon him to dispense with that Order after he should be in <HI>England,</HI> it might not be convenient that he should assume it whilst he remain'd yet at <HI>Edenborough:</HI> the other was, that, when
<PB N="115" REF="1350"/>
they had done it without his Commission, he might, upon his March, or assoon as he came thither, dispossess them of the Government, and put <HI>Scots-</HI>men into their places; the last of which he did not dissemble to them; <Q>but confessed “that, though the Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> would not attempt the taking of those Towns, yet when They should be taken, they would expect the Government thereof should be in Their hands, and depend upon Them, without which they should not be able to” send him those continual supplies which he expected from them.</Q> And there being then a recruit of five or six thousand, which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Mon∣roe</HI> had near raised in the North, and from <HI>Ireland,</HI> who were to begin <MILESTONE N="10"/> their March after him, assoon as he should be out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the two Gentlemen had no purpose of remaining in those Governments, well knowing that their presence would be of importance to the Army, at least whilst they stayed in the Northern Counties; yet they knew well, it was for the Service that those Towns should remain in the hands of the <HI>English,</HI> without which few of the Gentlemen of those parts would declare themselves, how well affected soever they were; which when they had offer'd to the Duke, they left it to him, and accepted the im∣ployment he pressed them to undertake, and parted to put the same in execution in both places at one time, all things being concerted be∣tween <MILESTONE N="20"/> them to that purpose.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> had several Officers, and Soldiers, laid privately on the <HI>Scotish</HI> side to wait his Commands, and more on the <HI>English;</HI> there being two or three good Families within two or three miles of <HI>Berwick,</HI> who were well affected and ready to appear when they should be required; in expectation whereof they had harboured many Men. Some of them S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke</HI> appointed to meet him, on the <HI>Scotish</HI> side, at a place about a mile distant from <HI>Berwick,</HI> the night be∣fore he intended the surprise, and the rest to be in the Town by the rising of the Sun; some about the Market place, and some upon the Bridge, <MILESTONE N="30"/> by which he must enter. The next morning, being Market day, when great droves of little Horses, laden with sacks of Corn, allways resorted to the Town, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> with about a hundred Horse, and some few Foot, which walked with the Market People, presently after Sun rising, was upon the Bridge, before there was any apprehen∣sion; and finding his Friends there whom he expected, he caused the Bridge presently to be drawn up, and guarded by his Foot, and sent others to the other parts. Himself with most of his Troops went into the Market place, where he found his Country Friends ready to do all he would command. There was so general a consternation seised upon <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> M. Lang∣dale <HI>surprises'</HI> Berwick, <HI>and S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> P. Mus∣grave Carlisle <HI>soon after.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"/> the whole Town, there being no other Garrison but Townsmen, that after they had seised upon the Mayor, who was the Governour, all things were in a short time so quiet, that they open'd their Ports again, that the Market might not be interrupted. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave,</HI> with as little opposition, possessed himself of <HI>Carlisle;</HI> where he had a greater Interest; and the People were generally better affected to the King, and more disinclined to the <HI>Scots</HI> than those of <HI>Berwick</HI> used to be; and they both hasten'd advertisement to the Duke of what they had done.</P>
<P>IT will be much wonder'd at, that after <HI>Cromwell</HI> plainly foresaw they should have a War with <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had constant Intelligence <MILESTONE N="50"/> from thence of the Advances they made, he did not take care to put Garrisons into those two important places, the very strength of which could for some time have withstood all the power which <HI>Scotland</HI> could
<PB N="116" REF="1360"/>
have brought against them. But the same reason which had been cur∣rent at <HI>Edenborough</HI> to this very time, had prevailed at <HI>Westminster.</HI> It was specially provided for by the Act of Pacification between the two Kingdoms, when the Parliaments of both Kingdoms combined against the King, <Q>“that there should be no more Garrisons kept on either side” in <HI>Berwick</HI> or <HI>Carlisle;</HI></Q> where they were then disbanded, and some of their Fortifications slighted; which could easily have been repaired; and, without repairing, could have kept out an Enemy for some time. And the Parliament would not now permit any Men to be sent thither, that the <HI>Scots</HI> might not pretend that the War was begun by Them; but <MILESTONE N="10"/> left <HI>Berwick</HI> to the Government of the Mayor and the Citizens; who could have defended themselves against the <HI>Scots</HI> if they had expected them. But the truth is, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had so perfect a contempt of the whole strength of that Nation, that he never cared what Advantage ground they had upon any Field, or what place they ever possessed.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> were no sooner possessed of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and <HI>Carlisle,</HI> than all the Gentlemen, Officers, and Soldiers thereabouts, who had formerly serv'd the King, resorted and flocked to them well armed, appointed, and provided for the War; so that they had not only very sufficient Garrisons to keep those places, <MILESTONE N="20"/> but Troops enough of Horse to free the adjacent Counties from those Forces, and Committees, and other Persons, who were either publickly engaged in, or well known privately to wish well to the Parliament. It was upon the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April</HI> that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> possessed him∣self of <HI>Berwick;</HI> and soon after S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> surprised <HI>Carlisle,</HI> about eight of the Clock at night, many Gentlemen of the Neighbours being in, and about the Town, expecting his Arrival; so that the Ci∣tizens were in confusion, and made little resistance. It is very true, they had both given under their hands to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> that they would deliver up the Towns to him when he should require them; he having <MILESTONE N="30"/> assured them, <Q>“that the King had promised, under his hand, that those” two Towns should be deliver'd into the possession of the <HI>Scots;</HI></Q> which it must needs be supposed that they should first take from the Parlia∣ment, in whose possession they were both when the King sign'd the En∣gagement at <HI>Carisbrooke</HI> Castle. And the Duke had not only refused to give them any Men, or other Assistance towards the taking them, but, as hath been said, would not grant them his Commission to perform it; pretending <Q>“that he durst not do it, because they were bound not to” begin the War:</Q> only He, and the other Lords of his Fraternity, pro∣mised <Q>“to send five hundred Muskets, and ten Barrels of Powder to <MILESTONE N="40"/> each Garrison; and that their whole Army should march into <HI>England</HI> within twenty days; and that, if they were sooner in distress, they” should be sure to be reliev'd.</Q></P>
<P>BUT after he heard that both places were possessed by them, he de∣ferr'd not to send a Governour and Garrison to receive <HI>Berwick;</HI> to whom S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> deliver'd it according to his promise; and was required <Q>“to march with all the <HI>English</HI> to the parts adjacent to <HI>Carlisle,</HI> and there to encrease his Troops to what Number he could,” with what expedition was possible;</Q> which he perform'd so effectually, that, in very few days, he had a Rendezvous upon a Heath within five <MILESTONE N="50"/> Miles of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> where he muster'd above three thousand Foot well armed, and seven hundred Horse not so well armed; all which were raised in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> over and above the Garrison
<PB N="117" REF="1370"/>
of <HI>Carlisle;</HI> which yet remain'd under S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave;</HI> and, within two days, five hundred Horse, very well appointed, came out of <HI>York∣shire,</HI> the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> and the Neighbour parts; so that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> resolv'd presently to march into <HI>Lancashire,</HI> to reduce those who were for the Parliament there; which he could easily have done, the Lord <HI>Byron</HI> being ready upon the Borders of <HI>Cheshire</HI> to have joyn'd with him. But this quick advance and progress towards an Army, was not well looked upon at <HI>Edenborough;</HI> <Q>and an Express was dispatched, with positive Orders to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> “not to engage or fight with the Enemy, upon what advantage soever,” <MILESTONE N="10"/> until the <HI>Scots</HI> Army should come up.</Q> And wherever that Express should overtake S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke,</HI> he was immediately to retire with his Forces near <HI>Carlisle;</HI> which he obeyed assoon as he receiv'd the Order, and when he might have marched against <HI>Lambert;</HI> who was sent be∣fore with a less strength than S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke</HI> commanded, and which in all probability would have been defeated.</P>
<P>BUT, as if this had not been discouragement enough, within one or two days after that Express, Letters were sent from the Council in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> by which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> was very severly reprehended, <Q>“for receiving Papists into his Army, and not owning the Covenant in” <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Declarations which he had published;</Q> <Q>and told, “that he should receive no Assistance from Them, except the Covenant was embraced” by all his Army.</Q> <Q>This struck at the root of all their hopes; and was so contrary to all the Engagements they had receiv'd from the <HI>Scotish</HI> Lords, both by Words and Letters, “that they should never be troubled with any such motions, after they were once upon <HI>English</HI> ground; and that then they should proceed upon those Grounds as were like to” bring in most Men to their Assistance;</Q> that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke</HI> prevailed with S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> to make a Journey forthwith to <HI>Edenborough,</HI> to expostulate upon the whole matter, and declare their firm resolution <MILESTONE N="30"/> to the Lords there.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Philip Musgrave,</HI> that it might appear that they did not exclude any who had taken the Covenant, and were willing to joyn with them, carried a list with him of the names of many Officers in their Troops who had been compelled to take the Covenant before they could be ad∣mitted to composition, or procure the sequestrations to be taken from their Estates, and of some others who had taken it for quietness sake in the places where they liv'd; with which the <HI>Scots</HI> were in some degree mitigated, but seem'd to retain still their rigour, that it should be sub∣mitted to by the whole Army. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>IN the mean time <HI>Lambert,</HI> having gotten a strong Body of Horse <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>marches a∣gainst them.</HI></NOTE> and Foot, advanced upon S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale;</HI> <Q>who, being enjoyn'd not to Fight, was forced to retire to <HI>Carlisle,</HI> and suffer himself to be, upon the matter, blocked up on one side, whilst he sent Letter upon Letter to the Duke “to hasten his March, or to send some Troops to” his Assistance, and Liberty to Fight the Enemy.</Q></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> had found the Assembly at <HI>Maidstone</HI> very <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Norwich <HI>at</HI> Maidstone <HI>with the</HI> Ken∣tish <HI>Forces.</HI></NOTE> numerous, but likewise very disorderly, and without Government, nor easy to be reduced under any Command. They had been long enough together to enter into jealousies of one another, and from thence into <MILESTONE N="50"/> Factions, and were of several opinions what they were to do. And though they all pretended an entire submission and obedience to the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> as their General, yet no Man forbore to deliver his opinion
<PB N="118" REF="1380"/>
of Things and Persons, nor to enquire by what means they had first been drawn together; which implyed that many Men wished they had been to begin again. The Earl was a Man fitter to have drawn such a Body together by his frolick and pleasant humour, which reconciled People of all constitutions wonderfully to him, than to form and conduct them towards any Enterprise. He had allways liv'd in the Court in such a station of business as raised him very few Enemies; and his pleasant and jovial Nature, which was every where acceptable, made him many Friends, at least made many delight in his Company. So that by the great favour he had with the King and Queen, and the little prejudice <MILESTONE N="10"/> he stood in with any Body else, he was very like, if the fatal disorder of the time had not blasted his hopes, to have grown Master of a very fair Fortune; which was all that he proposed to himself. But he had no experience or knowledge of the War, nor knew how to exercise the Of∣fice he had taken upon him of General, but was very willing to please every Man, and comply with every Bodies humour; which was quickly discover'd; and so Men withdrew the Reverence they were prepared to have paid him, and grew more obstinate in their own opinions what was to be done; and the indisposition increased, when they heard that <HI>Fairfax</HI> himself was appointed to march towards them. They who best <MILESTONE N="20"/> understood the Affair, and how to apply the strength they had to the best advantage, advised <Q>“that they might retire beyond <HI>Rochester,</HI> and by breaking down the Bridge there, and Fortifying another Pass or two, which was easy to be done, they might keep the Enemy from” entring into the East of <HI>Kent</HI></Q> (which was the largest and best part of that rich and populous County) <Q>“longer than they would be able to continue the attempt, for fear of being inclosed by an Enemy at their back, if the City of <HI>London,</HI> or those of <HI>Essex,</HI> who were most spoken of, had a mind to declare for the King; and by this means they might” be sure of a correspondence with the Fleet;</Q> of the return whereof in <MILESTONE N="30"/> a short time they were most confident; and the more, because some Gen∣tlemen of their own Body were on board the Fleet in some Authority, who, they knew, would hasten their return all they could.</P>
<P>MANY were the more perswaded that the Fleet was gone to the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> for the rescue of the King, because those Gentlemen were gone in it. And without doubt that advice was the most reasonable, and if it had been pursued might have kept the Enemy at a Bay for some time. But other Men less reasonable were of another mind: they did not be∣lieve <Q>“that <HI>Fairfax</HI> could have leisure to look after them; they were confident that the Parliament had so many Enemies to look after, <MILESTONE N="40"/> those in <HI>Wales</HI> growing strong, and having beaten the Party that had been sent against them; and the Officers in the North, who had seised upon <HI>Pontfret</HI> Castle in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and had drawn in a strong Garrison from the parts adjacent, had a Body of Horse, that infested all those parts; and the <HI>Scots</HI> were upon their march for <HI>England;</HI> and there∣fore they concluded that <HI>Fairfax</HI> could not be at leisure to visit them: The retiring would be an Argument of fear, which would dishearten their Friends at <HI>London,</HI> and all those of that part of <HI>Kent,</HI> which must be deserted upon their Retreat, would desert them, assoon as that re∣solution” should be known;</Q> and therefore they desired, <Q>“that they <MILESTONE N="50"/> might all march towards <HI>Black-Heath;</HI> which would raise the Spirits of their Friends, and many would resort every day to them out of <HI>Lon∣don”</HI> and the parts adjacent; all which were eminently well affected.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="1390"/>
THE Noise for this was the greater, and the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> him∣self <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Kentish <HI>Army mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes towards</HI> Black-Heath</NOTE> was thereby swayed to be of that opinion; and so they resolv'd to advance, and a short day was appointed for a general Rendezvous upon <HI>Black-Heath;</HI> and Orders were sent out accordingly.</P>
<P>THE disturbance in so many places made the resolution of the Ge∣neral now to be known, which had been hitherto carefully concealed, <Q>“”that <HI>Fairfax</HI> himself was not willing to march against the <HI>Scots;</HI></Q> which was not now counselable for him to do. <HI>Cromwell</HI> was very willing to take that Province to himself, and had allways so great a contempt of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that he was willing to march with a much lesser Number than <MILESTONE N="10"/> he well knew the <HI>Scots</HI> Army to consist of; and being inform'd which way the <HI>Scots</HI> resolv'd to enter the Kingdom, and that they were even ready to march, he advanced to meet them, assoon as they should be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>ad∣vances against the</HI> Scots:</NOTE> enter'd, with those Troops which he had made choice of, having first suppressed the Risings in South <HI>Wales</HI> by taking of <HI>Pembroke</HI> Castle, and making Prisoners therein <HI>Laughorn, Powel,</HI> and <HI>Poyer,</HI> the heads of that Insurrection, and not troubling himself with <HI>Pontfret</HI> Castle, which he thought would not be of great consequence, if the <HI>Scots</HI> were subdued.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX, with a numerous part of the Army, remain'd in and about <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>London</HI> to suppress the Insurrection in <HI>Kent,</HI> and watch any other which should fall out in the City or thereabouts; of which they had more ap∣prehension than of all the power of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And so when the Parlia∣ment was advertised by their Troops which were first sent, that they were too weak to advance farther, and heard that the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> was declared General of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Troops, and was marching in the head of them towards <HI>Black-Heath, Fairfax</HI> drew all his Army together, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fairfax <HI>a∣gainst the</HI> Kentish <HI>Men.</HI></NOTE> and his Cannon, and marched over <HI>London</HI> Bridge to meet the Men of <HI>Kent</HI> at <HI>Black-Heath,</HI> and to stop their march to <HI>London.</HI> The Earl was now advanced so far, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> advanced too fast to put the for∣mer <MILESTONE N="30"/> Counsel in practice, of breaking down the Bridges, and keeping the Passes, and they who had opposed that Counsel, and were so forward to advance, thought they were now too far. The Country-men were weary of being all night in the Field, though it was the warmest Season of the Year, and many withdrew themselves every day; so that they who re∣main'd had no reason to believe themselves equal to the power that marched towards them, and yet there were more left than could hope to preserve themselves by flying, and by concealment. And therefore, as <HI>Fairfax</HI> advanced, the <HI>Kentish</HI> Forces drew back; made several stands; but, being hard press'd, they divided, some retiring to <HI>Rochester,</HI> others <MILESTONE N="40"/> to <HI>Maidstone.</HI> Those at <HI>Maidstone</HI> had a sharp Encounter with the Ge∣neral's whole strength, and fought very bravely, but were at last de∣feated. In the mean time the Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and divers other Of∣ficers who were with the Party at <HI>Rochester,</HI> quitting that place, marched back towards <HI>London,</HI> in hope still of the City's joyning with them. But that failing, and apprehending <HI>Fairfax</HI> would be soon in their Rear, the Earl and those who remain'd, and design'd to run the utmost hazard, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Norwich, <HI>and some Forces, transport themselves in∣to</HI> Essex; <HI>and six in</HI> Colche∣ster</NOTE> resolv'd to pass themselves and their Horses by such Boats as they had ready about <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and down the River, over into <HI>Essex;</HI> where they knew they had many Friends, and where <HI>Fairfax</HI> and his Army <MILESTONE N="50"/> could not visit them in some days. So they made a shift to transport themselves to the number of near a thousand Men, Horse and Foot; whereof many were Officers and Soldiers who had serv'd the King, and

young Gentlemen grown up in Loyal Families, who had been too young to appear before.</P>
<P>THEY found many Persons in <HI>Essex</HI> ready to joyn with them, who came sooner together than they intended, upon the alarm of <HI>Kent;</HI> and who had purposed to have passed over into <HI>Kent</HI> to have joyn'd with, and assisted those who had so frankly appear'd for the King, if they had not been prevented by their unexpected coming to Them. There was the brave Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Compton,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Lisle,</HI> all excellent Officers. There was S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bernard Gascoign,</HI> and many other Gentlemen, and Officers of Name, who had drawn together <MILESTONE N="10"/> many Soldiers. To these joyn'd Colonel <HI>Farr;</HI> who had serv'd the Par∣liament, and was a known creature and confident of the Earl of <HI>War∣wick</HI>'s, and had at that time the Command of <HI>Languard Point,</HI> a Fort of importance upon the Sea; so that when they were all come together, with those who came from <HI>Kent,</HI> they made a Body of above three thousand Horse and Foot, with Officers enough to have form'd and commanded a very good Army.</P>
<P>THEY well knew <HI>Fairfax</HI> would quickly visit them, and therefore they chose to post themselves in <HI>Colchester,</HI> a great and populous Town, which though unfortified, they cast up such works before the Avenues, <MILESTONE N="20"/> that they did not much fear to be forced by an assault; and resolv'd to expect a conjunction with other of their Friends; and were in great hopes that the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, which they heard was upon its march, would be with them before they could be distressed.</P>
<P>THEY had scarce put themselves and the Town, which was not glad of their company, into any order, before <HI>Fairfax</HI> came upon them; who made no stay in <HI>Kent,</HI> after he heard what was become of the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> and his Friends; but left two or three Troops of Horse to settle that County, with the assistance of their Committees, who had been driven from thence, and returning now victorious knew well enough <MILESTONE N="30"/> how to deal with those who had revolted from them. When he came <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fairfax <HI>be∣sieges them.</HI></NOTE> first before <HI>Colchester,</HI> and saw it without any Fortifications, he thought presently to have enter'd the Town with his Army; but he found so rude resistance, that by the advice of <HI>Ireton,</HI> who was left by <HI>Cromwell</HI> to watch the General as well as the Army, he resolv'd to encompass i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with his Troops, and without hazarding the loss of Men to block them up, till Famine should reduce them; and disposed his Army accordingly; which quickly stopped up all Passages, by which either Men or Provi∣sions should get into the Town; though by many brave Sallies from within, their Quarters were often beaten up, and many valiant Men <MILESTONE N="40"/> were lost on both sides.</P>
<P>THE Fleet, after it had, with all imaginable chearfulness, submitted to the command of the Prince, was not so active as it was expected it should be; and was very much the worse for the Factions, and Divi∣sions, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in the Prince's Fleet</NOTE> which were amongst those who attended upon the Prince; who, according to their several humours, endeavour'd to work upon the Sea∣men; a People capable of any impression, but not very retentive of it. Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> to whom the Prince was very kind, did not, upon many old contests in the late War, love the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> who was not of a temper that cared to court him: and there was one, who had the <MILESTONE N="50"/> greatest influence on Prince <HI>Rupert, Herbert</HI> the Atturney General, that of all Men living was most disposed to make discord and disagree∣ment between Men; all his faculties being resolv'd into a spirit of con∣tradicting,
<PB N="121" REF="1410"/>
disputing, and wrangling upon any thing that was proposed. He having no title or pretence to interpose in Councils, and yet there being no secret in the debates there, found it easy to infuse into Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who totally resign'd himself to his advice, such Arguments as might disturb any resolution: and there were so many who were angry that they were not admitted into the Council, as the Lords <HI>Piercy, Wilmot,</HI> and <HI>Wentworth,</HI> that it was no hard matter to get any thing disliked that was resolv'd there. They had all that admission and coun∣tenance from the Prince, that they had as much confidence to speak to, and before him, as any where else. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had a great mind <MILESTONE N="10"/> that somewhat should be attempted upon the Coast, which might have caused some Sea Towns, and the parts adjacent, to have declared for the King; which seem'd not a design that would bear a reasonable dis∣course. But Action was a very grateful word to the Seamen, and they who opposed any thing that tended toward it, were looked upon with great jealousy and prejudice. But the Prince was obliged, as hath been said, by his Instructions at <HI>Paris,</HI> not to engage himself in any thing that might divert him from being ready at the minute when the <HI>Scots</HI> should call for his presence; and they expected the first intimation of that from <HI>London;</HI> from whence they had the assurance already, that <MILESTONE N="20"/> Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> was enter'd into the Kingdom with an Army of above thirty thousand Men; which was then generally thought true, though they fell far short of the number.</P>
<P>WHEN the Prince came with the Fleet into the Sea from <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> he met a Ship of <HI>London</HI> bound for <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and laden with Cloath by the Company of Merchant Adventurers, who did not think that the Fleet could have been so soon ready for Sea. This Ship was taken, and the Decks being Sealed up, was kept under Guard with the Fleet; which, at their Entrance into the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> took many <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>It enters the River of</HI> Thames; <HI>takes several Ships.</HI></NOTE> other Ships of great value outward bound, and intercepted all Vessels <MILESTONE N="30"/> homeward bound, and amongst those an East India Ship richly laden, and the more welcome because the Ship it self was a very strong Ship, and would make an excellent Man of War, and the Captain thereof was a Seaman of Courage, and Experience, and was very well inclined to serve the King: and, without doubt, if all the Ships which were then taken, had been sent into some secure Ports, the value of the Goods would have mounted to so great a Sum, as might have countervailed a very great Expence at Sea and Land. But as it would have been very difficult to have found such a secure Port, where that Treasure might have been deposited, so it was not suitable to those measures which had <MILESTONE N="40"/> been taken, and were still pursued, for his Royal Highness's proceedings. The City of <HI>London</HI> was to be courted by all the Artifices imaginable, and that was so alarm'd by the Fleet's being in the River, and by the seizure of so many of their Ships, especially the Cloath Ship, that there was a general consternation amongst the People: and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen applied themselves to the Parliament, for leave to send down some Agents to the Fleet to procure a release of that Ship; and if that could not be brought to pass, that they might buy it at as good rate as they could get it. Which was the introducing such a Commerce and Correspondence between the Fleet and the City, in such a con∣juncture <MILESTONE N="50"/> of jealousy, that most Men believ'd the Parliament would ne∣ver have hearken'd to it; and concluded, from their granting it, that there was another sort of Treasure inclosed in that Ship, than what
<PB N="122" REF="1420"/>
belonged to the Merchant Adventurers; and that many of those who granted that indulgence to the City, had more Money on board that Vessel than the Cloath was worth, though the value thereof amounted to no less than forty thousand pounds.</P>
<P>UPON this liberty granted by the Parliament, a Committee was sent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Commissioners sent to the Prince from the City with a Petition.</NOTE> from the City with a Petition to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> <Q>“that he would” restore the Ship which belonged to his Father's good Subjects.</Q> With these Men came Letters from some of those who were well known to be very sollicitous at that time for the advancement of the King's Service, and privy to the Treaty with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and whatever was intended by <MILESTONE N="10"/> the Earl of <HI>Holland:</HI> The Countess of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> who was trusted by all that People, and had gotten again confidence with the Queen, trusted M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lowe,</HI> who was imployed by the City in this Negotiation, to say many things to the Prince of the good inclinations of the City, and how necessary it was not to irritate it. And he brought other Letters, and Testimonies to give him credit, as a Man trusted by all who intended to serve the King, who had with wonderful Address got him to be one of those imployed by the City, that he might, under that security, give such animadversions to the Prince, and to his Council, as was necessary. He was a Man intelligent enough of the spirit and humour of the City, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and very conversant with the Nobility and Gentry about the Town; and though he was trusted by the Presbyterian Party, as a Man entirely addicted to Them, he took pains to insinuate himself into many of the King's Party, which did believe him fit to be trusted in any thing that might concern them. But he was a Man of so voluble a Tongue, and so everlasting a Talker, and so undertaking and vain, that no sober Man could be imposed upon by him.</P>
<P>UPON the receipt of this Petition, the Prince writ a long Letter to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince writes to the City.</NOTE> the City, and inclosed in it a Declaration, for the publishing of both which in print care was taken, the substance of which was, <Q>“the great” <MILESTONE N="30"/> affection he bore to the City, and the prosperity thereof;</Q> the whole being in such a Style as might best please the Presbyterians, with less care than should have been used to preserve the Zeal of the King's Party; and desiring <Q>“that they would joyn with him for the delivery of the King his Father out of Prison, and to make a good understanding be∣tween” his Majesty and the Parliament, which his Highness desired with all imaginable concernment.</Q> The Citizens quickly found, that there was no hope to have their Ship released without a good Sum of Money, which the Prince told them <Q>“was absolutely necessary for the payment of the Seamen, and he would receive it as a loan from them, and re∣pay” <MILESTONE N="40"/> it when a Peace should be made.</Q> So some of them return'd to <HI>London,</HI> and the rest remain'd with the Fleet, coming and going for a Month, and driving many bargains for other Ships. By this means the Prince receiv'd advertisement of the <HI>Scots</HI> continuing their march, and that those who were inclosed in <HI>Colchester,</HI> were in a very good condi∣tion, and willing to expect relief; which they would be sure to receive in due time, the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> being ready to declare assoon as their pressures should require it. After near a Months negotiation, there was about twelve thousand pounds paid to the Prince, and thereupon that Cloath Ship was deliver'd to the Merchants, with a general opinion, <MILESTONE N="50"/> as hath been said, that there was somewhat else besides Cloath in the Body of it; for which there was not any Search suffer'd to be made.</P>
<P>WHILST the Prince lay in the <HI>Downs,</HI> there was an Enterprise
<PB N="123" REF="1430"/>
necessary to be made on Shore, which did not succeed to wish. Upon the first revolt of the Fleet from the Parliament, and before it set sail for <HI>Holland,</HI> it had taken one or two of those Block-Houses, or Castles, which are nearest the Downs; and had left some Seamen in them, with sufficient Provisions to defend themselves till the Fleet should return. The Prince found these Block-Houses besieged, and receiv'd Intelligence out of them, that their Provisions were so near spent, that they could not hold out above so many days. The strength that lay before them, consisted more in Horse than Foot; and at high Tyde the Boats might go so near, that there seem'd little difficulty of putting in relief, or to <MILESTONE N="10"/> compel the Besiegers to rise: and the Seamen, having nothing else to do, offer'd to undertake the Service for the redemption of their fellows; many Land Officers being likewise on board, and some Foot Soldiers, the Prince sent some of those with the Seamen to undertake the busi∣ness, but it had no good issue; the Tyde was too far spent before it be∣gun; whereby they had more ground to march between their landing and the Castle than they imagined, and the Horse charged them with such resolution, that many of the Men were killed, and more taken Pri∣soners, and the rest forced to their Boats with more disorder than be∣came them. And some other attempts being afterwards made with no <MILESTONE N="20"/> better success, the Block-Houses at last came into the hands of the Ene∣my; which, though of little inconvenience to the Prince, those Forts being of very small importance to do any prejudice, yet there was some disreputation in it; and it discredited the designs, which had not yet appear'd very prosperous in any place; and any access of good Fortune raised the Spirits of the Parliament's Party, who easily were perswaded to think it greater than it was, in a time when they lay under some Mortification.</P>
<P>BY this time another Fleet was prepared by the Parliament of more <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment prepares a Fleet against the Revolted Fleet, under Command of the Earl of</HI> Warwick.</NOTE> and better Ships than had revolted, and the Command thereof given <MILESTONE N="30"/> to the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> who very frankly accepted it; and was already on board, and with the Tyde was come within sight of the Prince; and there dropped Anchor. So that both Fleets lay within that distance of each other, that there was now nothing thought of but a Battle; to which there seem'd all alacrity in the Prince's Fleet; and, it may be, the more upon the Intelligence that the other was not well mann'd, and that many were put on board who had more affection for the King; which they would manifest when they came within distance: but whe∣ther that fancy was from imagination or intelligence, it seem'd to have no foundation in truth. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and his Fleet appear'd resolute and prepared enough for an Engagement: yet it was well known, that the Earl was privy to the Engagement of his Brother the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and had promised to joyn with him. And therefore it was thought fit, that the Prince should write to the Earl to summon, or invite him to return to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince writes to the Earl of</HI> War∣wick. <HI>His Answer.</HI></NOTE> his Allegiance. This was sent by <HI>Harry Seymour,</HI> who quickly return'd with an Answer from the Earl, which, in terms of Duty enough, hum∣bly besought his Highness <Q>“to put himself into the hands of the Par∣liament; and that the Fleet with him might submit to their obe∣dience;” upon which they should be pardoned for their Revolt.</Q> <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THOUGH this might well have satisfied concerning the Earl's incli∣nation, yet the Prince was prevailed with that M▪ <HI>Crofts</HI> might give the Earl a visit; who, having more acquaintance with him, having married
<PB N="124" REF="1440"/>
his Aunt, might be able to get a private Audience of the Earl; which <HI>Seymour</HI> endeavour'd, but could not obtain. But <HI>Crofts</HI> return'd as the other did; and now there wanted only a Wind to bring them together, which coming fair for the Prince, he resolv'd to attack them. All An∣chors were weighed, and preparations made to advance to the Assault, the whole Fleet being under Sail towards the other; which seem'd equal∣ly resolv'd and disposed, though the Wind, which drove the Prince upon them, compelled them a little to retire, where the River was somewhat narrower. In an instant the Wind ceased, and there was a calm; so that the Prince could not advance; and some doubts arose, upon the <MILESTONE N="10"/> narrowing of the River, as if some of his Ships might want Water in the Engagement. In this deliberation the Wind rose again, but from another Quarter, which was directly in the Prince's face; and would not suffer him to move towards the Enemy, but drove him back, and would carry him out of the River. Hereupon were new consultations; great want of Provisions was discover'd to be in the Fleet, insomuch as that they should not be able to stay at Sea above ten days, and many Ships would want sooner, and therefore since the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> as the Wind stood, could not be compelled to Fight, and they were in dan∣ger to be distressed for Provisions, it was thought most counselable to <MILESTONE N="20"/> put to Sea; where they could more commodiously engage in a Battle, if the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> would advance; and if he did not, there was great reason to hope, that the Prince might meet with those Ships which were coming from <HI>Portsmouth</HI> to joyn with the Earl, and which might easily be surprised or taken by the Prince's Fleet; which was much su∣perior to them in strength.</P>
<P>AT this time the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> arrived in a Ship from <HI>Scot∣land;</HI> and having left Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> upon his march towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> he was sent to demand the performance of the Treaty, and that the Prince would immediately repair to that Army. This confirm'd the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Prince in the purpose of putting out to Sea, since it was absolutely ne∣cessary to carry the Fleet first into <HI>Holland,</HI> before it could transport him into the Northern parts. So the whole Fleet went to Sea, and con∣tinued <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince went to Sea towards</HI> Hol∣land, <HI>after having at∣tempted to Fight the Earl of</HI> War∣wick.</NOTE> their course for <HI>Holland,</HI> with hope still to meet with those Ships which were coming from <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> And meet with them they did in the Night; which the Prince knew not till the Morning; when one put the fault upon another; and it was now necessary to make all possible hast to <HI>Holland,</HI> since by the conjunction with these Ships, be∣sides all other Advantages, the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was now become su∣perior in the number, as well as the strength and goodness of his Ships; <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Warwick <HI>fol∣lows him to∣wards</HI> Hol∣land.</NOTE> which appear'd by his coming before <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> within few days after the Prince's arrival there.</P>
<P>IT was near the middle of <HI>July,</HI> when Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> enter'd into <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke</HI> Hamil∣ton <HI>enters</HI> England <HI>a∣bout the mid∣dle of</HI> July.</NOTE> <HI>England</HI> with his Army, when he came to <HI>Carlisle,</HI> and immediately took that Government from S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave,</HI> and drew out all the <HI>English</HI> Garrison, and put <HI>Scots</HI> in their place. And after some few days stay there, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Forces met at a Rendezvous, in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke's march.</NOTE> way to that part of <HI>Cumberland</HI> where <HI>Lambert</HI> then Quarter'd: and if they had continued their March, as they ought to have done, it is very probable they had broken that Body of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s. But the Duke <MILESTONE N="50"/> would Quarter that Night two Miles short; and <HI>Lambert,</HI> in the same Night, marched from thence in great disorder and confusion to the edge of <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> The Duke rested many days, that all his Forces might
<PB N="125" REF="1450"/>
come up, which came slowly out of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Assoon as they were come up, he marched to <HI>Kendal;</HI> where he rested again several days; the rea∣son whereof no body could imagin. It was suspected it was that those Forces which were up in several parts of the Kingdom for the King, might undergo some defeat, that they might not be so united, as to controle or obstruct the Presbyterian design. For after that Army was enter'd into <HI>England,</HI> it moved, as hath been said, by such very slow marches, and so negligently, and with so little apprehension of an Ene∣my, and it was Quarter'd at so great a distance, that the head Quarter was very often twenty Miles distant from some part of the Army; the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Duke himself performing no part of the office of a General, but taking his ease, and being wholely govern'd by the Lieutenant General of the Army, and two or three other Officers.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> marched, with his Body of <HI>English,</HI> con∣sisting <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> M. Lang∣dale <HI>a day be∣fore him.</HI></NOTE> of near four thousand Foot, and seven or eight hundred Horse, allways a day before the Army; by which they intended to have timely advertisement of the Enemies motion, and likewise meant that he should bear the first brunt of them, desiring to weaken him by all the ways they could. They had not marched many days, it being now near the middle of <HI>August,</HI> when S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> advertised the Duke, <MILESTONE N="20"/> by an Express, <Q>“that he had receiv'd unquestionable Intelligence that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was within two or three days march, and resolv'd to engage his Army assoon as possibly he could, and that he would not be di∣verted from it, by the People's gathering together at any distance from” him, in what posture soever;</Q> <Q>and therefore desired his Grace, “that he would keep his Army close together; for they could not be far” asunder with any security;</Q> <Q>and declared; “that he himself would rest, and wait the advance of the Enemy, and then retire back as he should” find it necessary.</Q></P>
<P>THE Duke, notwithstanding this advertisement, reformed not the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Order of his March in any degree, but was perswaded <Q>“that the Enemy could not be so near; and that, if <HI>Cromwell</HI> was advanced to such a distance, it was only with such a Party, as he would not presume to” engage with their whole Army.</Q> In this confidence, he marched as he had done before. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke</HI> sent him every day advice that con∣firm'd the former, <Q>“and that his Horse had encounter'd some of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> M. Lang∣dale <HI>gives him an Account of the</HI> English <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> Enemy, and that their whole Body was at hand; but that it was true, it was not a Body equal in number to their Army, yet all that <HI>Crom∣well”</HI> expected was to joyn Battle with him.</Q> All this gain'd not credit, till S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke</HI> himself, making his retreat with very sharp Skir∣mishes, <MILESTONE N="40"/> in which many Men fell on both sides, was pursued into the head Quarters of the Duke; whither he likewise brought with him some Prisoners, who averr'd, that the whole Body of the Army was within five or six Miles, and marched as fast as they were able.</P>
<P>THE Duke was confounded with the Intelligence, and knew not what to do: the Army was not together; and that part that was about him, was without any order, and made no shew of any purpose to Fight. In this amazement, the Duke stayed himself with some Officers at <HI>Preston;</HI> and caused his Foot to be drawn over a Bridge, that they might march towards <HI>Wiggan,</HI> a Town in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> where he should, <MILESTONE N="50"/> as he thought, find some Regiments, and where they might make some stand till the rest should come up. In the mean time S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> return'd to his Troops, the Duke having promised to send him
<PB N="126" REF="1460"/>
some Troops to assist, and that some Foot should be sent to keep a Lane, that would Flank his Men upon his retreat. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke</HI> retired before the Enemy, and drew up his Troops into the Closes near <HI>Preston.</HI> The Enemy followed him close, and pressed him very hard; notwith∣standing which he maintain'd the dispute for above six hours with great Courage, and with very great loss to the Enemy in Officers, and Com∣mon Soldiers; insomuch as they seem'd to retire, at least to make a stand. And in all this time the <HI>Scots</HI> sent him no Assistance, but concluded that it was not <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s whole Army that assaulted him, but only some Party, which he would himself be well enough able to disengage him∣self <MILESTONE N="10"/> from. <Q>And S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> told me often afterwards, “that he verily believ'd, if one thousand Foot had then been sent to him, he should have gained the day: and <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself acknowledged,” that he never saw Foot Fight so desperately as They did.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> continued their march over the Bridge, without taking <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> M. Lang∣dale <HI>Fights, and is beaten; and Duke</HI> Ha∣milton <HI>routed.</HI></NOTE> care to secure the Lane, which he had recommended to them; by which <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Horse came upon his Flank, whilst he was equally pressed in the Van. So that his excellent Body of Foot being broken, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mar∣maduke,</HI> and such of his Horse as kept together, were driven into the Town; where the Duke remain'd yet with some Officers; who all re∣treated <MILESTONE N="20"/> over a Ford to the Foot, who were in equal disorder. For as∣soon as the <HI>English</HI> Forces were broken, the <HI>Scots</HI> were presently beaten from the Bridge, and forced to a very disorderly march. However, the Duke had still a great part of his own Army together; with which he continued to march two or three days to <HI>Wiggan;</HI> thence, to <HI>Warring∣ton;</HI> where <HI>Baily</HI> capitulated, and deliver'd up all the Foot; thence to <HI>Nantwich,</HI> and at last to <HI>Uxeter;</HI> and in all that time many of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Noblemen forsook him, and render'd themselves Prisoners to the Gentlemen of the Country; and <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Troops under <HI>Lambert,</HI> pressed so hard upon the Rear, that they killed, and took as many Pri∣soners <MILESTONE N="30"/> as they pleased, without hazarding their own Men. The Duke was scarce got into <HI>Uxeter,</HI> when his Troops, which made no resistance, were beaten in upon him, and so close pursued by <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Horse under <HI>Lambert,</HI> that himself and all the principal Officers (some few excepted, who, lying concealed, or by the benefit of the swiftness of their Horses, made their escape) were taken Prisoners: the Duke nei∣ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke taken.</NOTE> behaving himself like a General, nor with that Courage which he was before never thought to want; but making all submissions, and all excuses to those who took him.</P>
<P>THUS his whole Army was routed, and defeated; more killed out <MILESTONE N="40"/> of contempt, than that they deserv'd it by any opposition; the rest taken Prisoners, all their Cannon and Baggage taken, and their Colours; only some of their Horse, which had been Quarter'd most backward, made hast to carry news to their Country of the ill success of their Armes. They who did not take the way for <HI>Scotland,</HI> were for the most part taken by the activity of the Country, or the Horse that pur∣sued them; whereof S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> after he had made his way with some of his Officers and Soldiers, who stood with him till they found it safest to disperse themselves, had the ill Fortune to be discover'd; and was so taken Prisoner, and sent to the Castle of <HI>Not∣tingham.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> M. Lang∣dale <HI>taken.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> All this great Victory was got by <HI>Cromwell</HI> with an Army amounting to a third part of the <HI>Scots</HI> in Number, if they had been all together; and it was not diminished half a hundred in obtaining this
<PB N="127" REF="1470"/>
Victory, after the <HI>English</HI> Forces under <HI>Langdale</HI> had been defeated.</P>
<P>IT may be proper now to mention, that the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had many misadventures; which de∣tain'd them from attending upon the Prince in the Fleet. Assoon as they heard that his Highness had put himself on board a Ship at <HI>Calais</HI> to find the Fleet in <HI>Holland,</HI> they embarked at <HI>Diepe,</HI> in a <HI>French</HI> Man of War that was bound for <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> <Q>where when they arriv'd, they found a Gentleman, a Servant of the Prince's, who inform'd them, “that the Prince was with the whole Fleet in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and that he had sent him with a Letter to the Marshal <HI>Ranzaw,</HI> who was Gover∣nour” <MILESTONE N="10"/> of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> to borrow a Frigat of him;</Q> which he had there, and had by some civil Message offer'd to lend to his Highness; and the Marshal, who receiv'd them with great civillity, assured them that the Frigat should be ready the next day, and if they pleased to make use of it, should carry them to the Prince.</P>
<P>THEY looked upon it as a good opportunity, which would deliver them much sooner at the Fleet, than they had before expected to be; and so, without weighing the Dangers which might accompany it, and might very naturally have been foreseen, they embraced the occasion; there being no hazard which they apprehended at Sea, but that they <MILESTONE N="20"/> might be taken by the Parliament Ships; which, by the Prince's being with his Fleet in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and so being Master at Sea, was hardly possible. So they unwarily put themselves into that Frigat, and set Sail in the Evening from <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> presuming that they should, the next Morning, find themselves in the <HI>Downs</HI> with the Prince. But there was so dead a calm that Night, that they made very little way; and, the next Morning, they found that they were chased by six or seven Frigats of <HI>Ostend.</HI> In short, they were taken Prisoners, and plunder'd of all they had (which amounted to good value in Jewels and Money) and were carried into <HI>Ostend,</HI> where, though they were presently at liberty, they <MILESTONE N="30"/> were compelled to stay many days not without some hope, raised by the civility of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governour, and the Lords of the Admiralty there, who very liberally promised an entire restitution of all that they had lost. But that being without any effect, that brutish People, the Freebooters, being subject to no Government, they found means to give notice to the Prince of all that happen'd, and that they would attend his Command at <HI>Flushing;</HI> whither they easily went. Within few days af∣ter, the Prince, out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> sent a Frigat for them to Flushing; where they embarked several times, and were at Sea the whole Night, and in the Morning driven back by high Winds, sometimes into <HI>Flush∣ing,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> sometimes to <HI>Ramikins;</HI> and so were compelled to go to <HI>Middle∣borough;</HI> and after a Months stay in those places, and many attempts to get to Sea, they receiv'd Order from the Prince to attend him in <HI>Holland,</HI> whither he had resolv'd to go, assoon as the Earl of <HI>Lauther∣dale</HI> arrived from <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Fleet, and had deliver'd his imperious invitation for the Prince's immediate repair to the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; which was then enter'd into <HI>England.</HI> By this means they came not to the Prince, till the next day after he came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> having left <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince comes to the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> the Fleet before <HI>Goree</HI> and near <HI>Helvoet Sluce.</HI></P>
<P>THE Prince was receiv'd by the States with all outward respect, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> treated by them for four or five days at their charge; his Royal High∣ness every Night lodging in the Palace, which belonged to the States too, where the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the Princess lay, and where both
<PB N="128" REF="1480"/>
his Royal Highness and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had very good apartments; the Prince and Duke, after two or three days, allways eating with the Princess Royal, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> himself keeping his own Table open, according to custom, for the resort of such of the States, or Of∣ficers of the Army, or other Noble Persons, who frequently repaired thither.</P>
<P>THE Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Court was full of Faction, and Animosity <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Divisions among the Prince of</HI> Wales<HI>'s Court.</HI></NOTE> against each other, so that the new comers were not only very well re∣ceiv'd by the Prince, but very welcome to every Body, who being an∣gry with the other Counsellors there, believ'd that matters would be bet∣ter <MILESTONE N="10"/> carried now They were come. They had not been an hour in the <HI>Hague,</HI> when <HI>Herbert</HI> the Atturney General came to them, and con∣gratulated their arrival, and told them <Q>“how much they had been want∣ed,” and how much Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> longed for their Company.</Q> And within a very short time after, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> himself came to bid them welcome, with all possible grace, and profession of great kindness and esteem for them. They both inveighed bitterly against the whole admi∣nistration of the Fleet, in which most part of the Court, which had been present, and who agreed in nothing else, concurr'd with them.</P>
<P>THE whole clamour was against the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Long</HI> the Prince's Secretary, who, by the Queen's injunction, was wholely subservient to the Lord <HI>Colepepper.</HI> They accused them of corruption, not only with reference to the Cloath Ship, but to the release of very many other Ships, which they had discharged upon no other reason, but as it would be a very Popular thing, and make the Prince grateful to the City of <HI>London.</HI> Though there was much discourse of Money brought to both their Cabins by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lowe,</HI> yet there was never any proof made of any corruption in the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> who was not indeed to be wrought upon that way; but, having some infirmities, and a multi∣tude of Enemies, he was never absolv'd from any thing of which any <MILESTONE N="30"/> Man accused him; and the other was so notoriously inclined to that way of Husbandry, that he was allways thought guilty of more than he was charged with. It was true enough that great Riches were parted with, and had been released for little or no Money; which being now exceedingly wanted, made it easily believ'd that such unthrifty Counsel could not have been given, except by those who were well rewarded for it; which still fell upon those two.</P>
<P>THERE was a general murmur that the Fleet had lain so long idle at the mouth of the River, when it had been proposed that it might go to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> where they might, in the consternation the whole <MILESTONE N="40"/> Kingdom was then in, probably have been able to have released the King; <HI>Carisbrooke</HI> being near the Sea, a Castle not strong in it self, the Island well affected, and at that time under no such power as could sub∣due them. And why such an attempt, which, if unsuccessful, could have been attended with no damage considerable, was not made, was never fully answer'd.</P>
<P>THEY were very angry with <HI>Batten,</HI> and would have it Treachery in him, that the two Fleets did not Fight with each other, when they were so near engaging in the River; which, they said, they might well have done before the Wind changed, if he had not disswaded the Prince; <MILESTONE N="50"/> and in this the clamour of the Seamen joyn'd with them. But it was but clamour, for most dispassionate Men gave him a good Testimony in that affair, and that he behaved himself like a skilful Officer, and was
<PB N="129" REF="1490"/>
very forward to Fight whilst there was reason to effect it. The other reproach upon him of passing by the Ships which came from <HI>Ports∣mouth,</HI> in the Night, was not so well Answer'd: for it was known, though he said that they were passed by, and out of reach before he was inform'd of them, that he had notice time enough to have engaged them, and did decline it; which might reasonably enough have been done, out of apprehension, besides the inconvenience of a Night En∣gagement, that the noise of the conflict might have called the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> out of the River to their Assistance, before they could have master'd them; there being two or three of the best Ships of the Royal <MILESTONE N="10"/> Navy, which would have made a very notable resistance. But this be∣ing never urged by himself, and what would have been too much for him to have taken upon himself, it was imputed to his Cowardize, of which the Seamen, as well as the Courtiers, accused him; though, as was generally thought, without reason, and only with prejudice to the Man for what he had done before, and because he was a Man of a re∣gular and orderly course of Life, and Command, and of very few words, and less passion than at that time raised Men to reputation in that Pro∣vince. There was only one Man in the Council of whom no body spoke ill, nor laid any thing to his Charge; and that was the Lord <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Hopton.</HI> But there was then such a combination, by the countenance of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> with all the other Lords of the Court, and the At∣turney General, upon former grudges, to undervalue him, that they had drawn the Prince himself to have a less esteem of him than his sin∣gular Virtue, and Fidelity, and his unquestionable Courage, and In∣dustry (all which his Enemies could not deny that he excelled in) did deserve.</P>
<P>THIS State the Court was in, when the two lately mention'd Coun∣sellors came; who quickly discern'd, by the unsteady humours, and strong passions all Men were possessed with, that they should not pre∣serve <MILESTONE N="30"/> the reputation they seem'd to have with every Body for the pre∣sent, any long time, and foresaw that necessity would presently break in upon them like an armed Man, that would disturb and distract all their Counsels. And there was, even at the instant in which they ar∣riv'd at the <HI>Hague,</HI> the fatal advertisement of that defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, which must break all their measures, and render the condition of the Prince, and of the whole Kingdom, very deplorable, and leave that of the King his Father in the utmost despair.</P>
<P>THE Rumour of this defeat came to the <HI>Hague</HI> the next day after the Prince came thither, but not so particularly that the extent of it <MILESTONE N="40"/> was known, or the tragical effects yet throughly understood. And his Highness appointing his Council to meet together the next Morning after the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer came thither, he inform'd them of the Lord <HI>Lautherdale</HI>'s Message to him from the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that he very earnestly pressed him, even since the news of the defeat, that he would forthwith repair to their Army; and his Highness thought fit, that the Earl should give an Account of his Commission at the Board; whereupon he was sent for in; and, that all respect might be shewed to the Parliament of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> he had a Chair allow'd him to sit upon. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>HE first read his Commission from the Parliament, and then the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Letter of the Parlia∣ment of</HI> Scot∣land <HI>to the Prince.</HI></NOTE> Letter which the Parliament had writ to the Prince; in which, having at large magnified the great Affection of the Parliament, <Q>“that out of
<PB N="130" REF="1500"/>
their native, and constant Affection and Duty to their King, and find∣ing that, contrary to the Duty of Subjects, his Majesty was imprison'd by the Traiterous and Rebellious Army in <HI>England,</HI> they had raised an Army in that Kingdom, that, since their advice, counsel, and en∣treaty in an amicable way, could not prevail, might by force redeem his Majesties Person from that captivity; which they held themselves obliged by their solemn League and Covenant to endeavour to do, with the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes: That this Army was al∣ready enter'd into <HI>England,</HI> under the Command of <HI>James</HI> Duke <HI>Ha∣milton,</HI> whom, in respect of his known and eminent fidelity to his <MILESTONE N="10"/> Majesty, they had made General thereof; and having now done all that was in their power to do for the present, and having taken due care for the seasonable supply and recruit of that Army, they now sent to his Highness, that he would with all possible speed, according to the promise which the King his Father had made, transport his Royal Person, that he might himself be in the head of that Army to obtain” the Liberty of his Father;</Q> and they desired him, <Q>“that for the cir∣cumstances of his Journey he would be advised by the Earl of <HI>Lauther∣dale,”</HI> to whom they had given full Instructions;</Q> and they besought his Highness <Q>“”to give credit to him in all things.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THE Earl likewise shew'd his Instructions, by which none of the Prince's Chaplains were to be admitted to attend him, and great care to be taken, that none but <HI>Godly</HI> Men should be suffer'd to be about the Person of his Highness; and particularly that neither Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> nor the Chancellor of the Exchequer, nor some other Persons should be admitted to go with the Prince. And after all these things were read and enlarged upon, he pressed the Prince, with all imaginable instance, and without taking notice of any thing that was befallen their Army in <HI>England,</HI> of which he could not but have had particular relation, that he would lose no time from entring upon his Journey; and all this <MILESTONE N="30"/> with as insolent, and supercilious behaviour, as if their Army had been triumphant.</P>
<P>WHEN he had said all he meant to say, he sate still, as if he expected to hear what the Prince or any Body else would say to what he proposed. It was then moved, <Q>“that, if he had no more to say, he would with∣draw, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deliberation in the Prince's Council about it.</NOTE> to the end that the Council might debate the matter, before” they gave their advice to the Prince.</Q> He took this motion very ill, and said <Q>“he was a Privy Counsellor to the King in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and being likewise a Commissioner from the Parliament, he ought not to be ex∣cluded from any debate that concern'd the Affair upon which he was” <MILESTONE N="40"/> imployed.</Q> This he urged in so imperious, and offensive a manner, that drew on much sharpness; and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who knew him very well since the Treaty at <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> where they had often differ'd in matters of the highest importance, treated him with the same liberty they had then been accustom'd to. <Q>He told him, “he meant not to say any thing in that debate, when he should be withdrawn, that he desired should be concealed from him, or unheard by him; and that he was ready to say, that, in His judgement, all he had pro∣posed was very unreasonable; but he would not that the Dignity of the Board should be prostituted to his Demand, nor that he should be” <MILESTONE N="50"/> present there at any Debate.</Q> <Q>The Earl replied, “that he was sent by the Parliament, and Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and that he did protest against having any thing he proposed to be
<PB N="131" REF="1510"/>
treated, and debated by, or before the <HI>English</HI> Board; nor did he con∣sider what was, or should be said, by any Man but the Prince him∣self.”</Q> <Q>The Prince told him, “it was necessary that he himself should hear, and know what the opinion of the Council should be; and that” it was as unreasonable that He should be present;</Q> and thereupon com∣manded him to withdraw; which he presently submitted to with inde∣cency enough. <Q>The Prince then told them, “that there were some Persons come to the Town, the last night, who came out of <HI>England</HI> after the News of the Victory over the <HI>Scots</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> with” all the circumstances thereof;</Q> and of the Duke's being taken Prisoner; <MILESTONE N="10"/> and that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had told him, <Q>“that the States had re∣ceiv'd Intelligence of it from their Embassadour <HI>Newport,</HI> who resided” in <HI>London.</HI></Q> <Q>Upon the whole matter, the Prince resolv'd “to meet again the next morning to consult farther what he was to do, and that probably, in the mean time, the Intelligence would be more perfect, and unquestionable, and they should see whether <HI>Lautherdale</HI> would” take any notice of it.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the night made no alteration in him; he appeared the next morning with the same confidence, and the same importunity for the Prince to remove, and begin his Journey. <Q>He was asked, “whether he <MILESTONE N="20"/> had receiv'd no information of some ill fortune, that had befallen that Army, which might so change the case since he left <HI>Scotland,</HI> that what” might Then have been fit, would be Now unfit and uncounselable?</Q> <Q>The Earl said, “he knew well what the News was from <HI>England;</HI> and, whatever he hoped, that he was not confident it was not true; how∣ever he hoped, that would not change the Prince's purpose, but that it would more concern him to pursue the resolution he was formerly obliged to: that if any misfortune had befallen that Army, the Prince had the more reason to endeavour to repair it; which could be done no other way, than by his making all possible hast into <HI>Scotland;</HI> which <MILESTONE N="30"/> remain'd still a Kingdom entire, wholely devoted to his Service; and that, by the benefit of his presence, might quickly draw together an∣other Army, towards which there was a good beginning already by the preservation of that Body under <HI>Monroe:</HI> that if his Highness should decline this only probable way to preserve himself, and to re∣cover his other two Kingdoms, it would be thought he had little zeal for the Liberty of his Father, and as little for his own Interest, and for the preservation of the Crown; he therefore besought his High∣ness, that he would cause some of his Ships to be forthwith made ready, and would therein immediately transport himself into <HI>Scotland;</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> whereby the late wound would, in a short time, be healed; which” would otherwise prove incurable.</Q></P>
<P>BUT <HI>Scotland</HI> was so well known, and the power of <HI>Argyle</HI> (which must be now greater than ever by the total defeat of the contrary Par∣ty) that his Proposition was by all dispassionate Men thought to be very extravagant, and not to be hearken'd to: and the news from <HI>London,</HI> that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was marched into <HI>Scotland</HI> with his whole Army, con∣firm'd every honest Man in that opinion. And within few days the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> seem'd rather to think of going thither himself, where his own concernments were in great danger, than of pressing the Prince <MILESTONE N="50"/> to so hazardous a Voyage; and after a few Weeks more stay at the <HI>Hague,</HI> upon the Intelligence from his Friends in <HI>Scotland,</HI> how affairs went <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Lautherdale <HI>returns into</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> there, he return'd thither in the same Ship that transported him from
<PB N="132" REF="1520"/>
thence, with as much rage and malice against the Council about the Prince, as against <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself.</P>
<P>THE Defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army at <HI>Preston,</HI> though it was not at first believ'd to be an entire Victory over their whole Body, there being dou∣ble that number that was not there or that marched from thence, broke or disappointed most of the designs which were on Foot for raising Men, in those Northern Counties, for the King's Service, to have joyn'd and united under S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale.</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Tildesly,</HI> a Gentle∣man of a fair Estate, who had serv'd the King from the beginning of the War with good Courage, was then with a Body of <HI>English,</HI> with which he had Besieged the Castle of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and was upon the point of reducing it, when the News of <HI>Preston</HI> arriv'd. It was then necessary to quit that design; and hearing that Major General <HI>Monroe,</HI> who, shortly after the Duke, marched out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> followed him with a Recruit of above six thousand Horse and Foot, was come to the skirts of <HI>Lancashire,</HI> he retired thither to him, having gather'd up many of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Tho. Til∣desly <HI>retires to</HI> Monroe.</NOTE> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI>'s Men, who had been broken at <HI>Preston,</HI> and some others who had been newly levied. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Tildesly</HI> moved <HI>Monroe,</HI> <Q>“that his Forces, and some Regiments of <HI>Scots,</HI> who yet re∣main'd about <HI>Kendal,</HI> might joyn with the <HI>English</HI> under his Com∣mand, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and march together towards <HI>Preston,</HI> and follow <HI>Cromwell</HI> in” the Rear, as He pursued the <HI>Scots:</HI> which they might very well have done, being a Body, when in conjunction, of above eight thousand Men;</Q> which was equal in number to the Army under <HI>Cromwell.</HI> But the Major General would not consent to the motion, but retired to the far∣ther part of <HI>Westmoreland;</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> followed them in the Rear; presuming, that though they would not be perswaded to advance after <HI>Cromwell,</HI> yet that they would choose some other more convenient Post to make a stand in, if the Enemy follow'd them; and then that they would be glad to joyn with them: to which he was pressed again the <MILESTONE N="30"/> next day, but continued still fast in his Sullen resolution, without de∣claring what he meant to do; and retired through <HI>Cumberland,</HI> where he had lest a sad remembrance of his having passed that way a few days before, having then raised vast Sums of Money upon the poor People, and now in his retreat plunder'd allmost all they had left.</P>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> marched into the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> to joyn with such new Levies as were then raising there; and their Number being encreased by the addition of those Troops which were under the Com∣mand of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Bellingham,</HI> they met again Major General <HI>Monroe</HI> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and desired him <Q>“that they might unite together <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monroe <HI>hav∣ing enter'd</HI> England, <HI>upon</HI> Hamilton<HI>'s Deseat re∣treats to∣wards</HI> Scot∣land.</NOTE> against the Common Enemy, who equally desired the destruction of” them both.</Q> But he resolutely refused, and told them plainly, <Q>“that” he would march directly into <HI>Scotland</HI> and expect Orders there;</Q> which he did, with all possible Expedition.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> believ'd that he and his Foot might be wel∣come <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S</HI><SUP>r</SUP> Philip Mus∣grave <HI>to</HI> Car∣lisle.</NOTE> to <HI>Carlisle;</HI> and went thither; and sent S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Bellingham,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Strickland,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Chater,</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> and offer'd that they should carry their Troops into <HI>Scotland</HI> to joyn with him; who he knew well would stand in need of help. But he durst not accept their motion, saying, <Q>“if he should, <HI>Argyle</HI> would from thence” <MILESTONE N="50"/> take an excuse to invite <HI>Cromwell;</HI></Q> who they heard was then upon his march towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> to bring his Army into <HI>Scotland:</HI> upon which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Bellingham</HI> return'd with the Party he Commanded into
<PB N="133" REF="1530"/>
<HI>Cumberland,</HI> paying for all they had through that part of <HI>Scotland</HI> it was necessary for them to pass through.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> had no better success with S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Leving∣ston,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Carlisle;</HI> for though he receiv'd him very civilly, and enter'd into a Treaty with him (for he knew well enough that he was not able to Victual, or Defend the place without the assistance of the <HI>English,</HI> and therefore desired the assistance of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip</HI> in both) yet when Articles were agreed upon, and sign'd by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave,</HI> the Governour fell back, <Q>and refused to engage himself “not to deliver up” the Garrison without the consent of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave;</HI></Q> who was con∣tented <MILESTONE N="10"/> that none of his Men should come within the Walls, until it should be most apparent, that they could no longer keep the Field.</P>
<P>WITHIN a short time after, Orders were sent out of <HI>Scotland</HI> for <NOTE PLACE="marg">Berwick <HI>and</HI> Carlisle <HI>deli∣ver'd to the Parliament.</HI></NOTE> the delivery of <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Carlisle</HI> to the Parliament; in which Or∣ders there was not the least mention of making conditions for the <HI>English.</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> had yet <HI>Apleby</HI> Castle in his own possession, having taken it after he had deliver'd <HI>Carlisle</HI> to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and after he was marched from thence. By this good accident, upon the delivery of it up, which could not long have made any defence, he made conditions for himself, and one hundred and fifty Officers, many of them Gentle∣men <MILESTONE N="20"/> of Quality, who liv'd again to venture, and some, to lose their Lives for the King: after which, he soon transported himself into <HI>Holland,</HI></P>
<P>CROMWELL resolv'd to lose no advantage he had got, but assoon as he had perfected his defeat of Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> by gathering up as many Prisoners, as he could, of the dispersed Troops, he marched directly towards <HI>Scotland,</HI> to pull up the Roots there, from which any farther trouble might spring hereafter; though he was very earnestly called upon from <HI>Yorkshire</HI> to reduce those at <HI>Pontfret</HI> Castle; which grew very troublesome to all their Neighbours; and, not satisfied with drawing <MILESTONE N="30"/> contributions from all the parts adjacent, they made excursions into places at a great distance, and took divers substantial Men Prisoners, and carried them to the Castle; where they remain'd till they redeem'd them∣selves by great ransoms. However, he would not defer his Northern March; but, believing that he should be in a short time capable to take Vengeance upon those Affronts, he satisfied himself in sending Colonel <HI>Rainsborough,</HI> with some Troops of Horse and Foot, to restrain their adventures, and to keep them blocked up; and himself, with the rest <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>marches into</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> of his Army, continued their march for <HI>Scotland,</HI> it being about the end of <HI>August,</HI> or beginning of <HI>September,</HI> before the Harvest of that <MILESTONE N="40"/> Country was yet ripe; and so capable of being destroyed.</P>
<P>IT was generally believ'd, that the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> earnestly in∣vited him to this Progress; for the defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army in <HI>England</HI> had not yet enough made him Master of <HI>Scotland.</HI> There was still a Committee of Parliament sitting at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> in which, and in the Council, the Earl of <HI>Lanrick</HI> swayed without a Rival; and the Troops which had been raised under <HI>Monroe</HI> for the Recruit of the Duke's Ar∣my, were still together, and at the Earl's devotion; so that the Marquis was still upon his good behaviour. If he did not invite <HI>Cromwell,</HI> he was very glad of his coming; and made all possible hast to bid him wel∣come <MILESTONE N="50"/> upon his entring into the Kingdom. They made great shews of being mutually glad to see each other, being linked together by many promises, and professions, and by an entire conjunction in guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="1540"/>
THERE was no Act of Hostility committed; <Q><HI>Cromwell</HI> declaring, “that he came with his Army to preserve the Godly Party, and to free the Kingdom from a force, which it was under, of Malignant Men, who had forced the Nation to break the Friendship with their Brethren of <HI>England,</HI> who had been so faithful to them: That it having pleased God to defeat that Army under Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who endeavour'd to engage the two Nations in each others Blood, he was come thither to prevent any farther mischief, and to remove those from Authority who had used their Power so ill; and that he hoped he should, in very few days, return with an assurance of the Brotherly Affection of that <MILESTONE N="10"/> Kingdom to the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> which did not desire in any” degree to invade their Liberties, or infringe their Privileges.</Q> He was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Is receiv'd at</HI> Edenborough.</NOTE> conducted to <HI>Edenborough</HI> by the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> where he was re∣ceiv'd with all solemnity, and the respect due to the Deliverer of their Country, and his Army Quarter'd about, and supplied with all Provi∣sions the Country could yield.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> and all the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Faction (that is all who had a mind to continue of it) were withdrawn, and out of reach; and they who remain'd at <HI>Edenborough</HI> were resolv'd to obey <HI>Argyle;</HI> who they saw could protect them. There were then enough left of the <MILESTONE N="20"/> Committee of Parliament to take care of the safety and good of the Kingdom, without putting <HI>Cromwell</HI> to help them by the power of the <HI>English;</HI> which would have been a great discredit to their Govern∣ment. Whilst he remain'd their Guest (whom they entertain'd magni∣ficently) <HI>Argyle</HI> thought himself able, by the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to re∣form all that was amiss, and preserve the Government upon the true foundation. So the Committee of Parliament sent to <HI>Monroe</HI> an Order <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commit∣tee of the</HI> Scots <HI>Parliament order</HI> Monroe <HI>to Disband.</HI></NOTE> and Command to Disband his Troops; which when he seem'd resolv'd not to do, he quickly discern'd that <HI>Cromwell</HI> must be Arbitrator; and thereupon he observ'd the Orders of the Committee very punctually <MILESTONE N="30"/> so that there was no power in <HI>Scotland</HI> that could oppose the Command of <HI>Argyle;</HI> the Committee of Parliament, the Council, all the Magistrates of <HI>Edenborough,</HI> were at his devotion; and whoever were not so, were either in Prison, or fled. The Pulpits were full of Invectives against the sinfulness of the late Engagement, and solemn Fasts enjoyn'd by the Assembly to implore God's pardon and forgiveness for that heinous trans∣gression; the Chancellor <HI>Lowden</HI> giving the good example, by making his recantation and humble submission with many Teares. <HI>Cromwell</HI> had reason to believe that it would henceforward prove as peaceable a Kingdom as he could wish; and having thus concerted all things with <MILESTONE N="40"/> his bosome Friend <HI>Argyle</HI> (who resolv'd, assoon as he was withdrawn a distance from <HI>Edenborough,</HI> that he and his Army might not be thought to have an influence upon the Councils, to call the Parliament to con∣firm all he should think fit to do) he return'd for <HI>England;</HI> where he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>returns for</HI> England.</NOTE> thought his presence was like to be wanted.</P>
<P>THE Committee of Parliament at <HI>Edenborough</HI> (who had Authority to Convene the Parliament when the Major part of them should please; care being taken in the nomination of them, that they were such as were thought most like to pursue the way they were enter'd into) sent out their summons to call the Parliament. They who appear'd, were <MILESTONE N="50"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scots <HI>Parliament, being called, condemn Duke</HI> Hamilton<HI>'s Engagement.</HI></NOTE> of another mind from what they had been formerly, and with the same passion and zeal with which they had enter'd into the Engagement, they now declared it unlawful, and ungodly; and the Assembly joyning
<PB N="135" REF="1550"/>
with them, they excommunicated all who had the most eminent Parts in the promoting it; and made them incapable of bearing any Office in the State, or of sitting in Council, or in Parliament; subjecting those who had sinned in a less degree, to such penalties as would for ever make them subject to their Government. By these judgements, amongst others, the Earl of <HI>Lanrick</HI> was deprived of being Secretary of State, and that Office was conferr'd upon the Earl of <HI>Lothian;</HI> who, in the beginning of the Rebellion, had been imployed by the Conspirators into <HI>France,</HI> and coming afterwards into <HI>England</HI> was imprison'd thereupon, and being after set at liberty continued amongst those who, upon all <MILESTONE N="10"/> occasions, carried the Rebellion highest, and shewed the most impla∣cable malice to the Person of the King. And by this time <HI>Argyle</HI> was become so much more Master of <HI>Scotland</HI> than <HI>Cromwell</HI> was of <HI>England,</HI> that he had not so much as the shadow of a Parliament to contend, or to comply with, or a necessity to exercise his known great Talent of dissimulation, all Men doing as he injoyn'd them, without asking the reason of his direction.</P>
<P>To return to the State of the King's Affairs in <HI>England:</HI> when the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> and the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> with the <HI>Kentish</HI> and <HI>Essex</HI> Troops were inclosed in <HI>Colchester,</HI> their Friends could not reasonably hope <MILESTONE N="20"/> that the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, which had so long deferr'd their March into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> contrary to their promise, would, though they were now come in, march fast enough to relieve <HI>Colchester</HI> before they should be re∣duced by Famine. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> thought it necessary, since many who were in <HI>Colchester,</HI> had engaged themselves upon His pro∣mises and Authority, now to begin his Enterprise; to which the youth <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Holland <HI>Rises; goes to</HI> King∣ston:</NOTE> and warmth of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who was General of the Horse, the Lord <HI>Francis Villiers</HI> his Brother, and divers other young Noblemen, spurr'd him on. And he might have the better opinion of his Interest and Party, in that his purpose of rising, and putting himself into Armes <MILESTONE N="30"/> for the relief of <HI>Colchester,</HI> was so far from being a secret, that it was the common discourse of the Town. There was a great appearance every Morning, at his Lodging, of those Officers who were known to have serv'd the King; his Commissions shew'd in many hands; no que∣stion being more commonly asked, than <Q>“when doth my Lord <HI>Hol∣land”</HI> go out?</Q> and the Answer was, <Q>“”such and such a day;</Q> and the hour he did take Horse, when he was accompanied by an hundred Horse from his House, was publickly talked of two or three days before.</P>
<P>HIS first Rendezvous was at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames;</HI> where he stayed two nights, and one whole day, expecting a great resort to him, not <MILESTONE N="40"/> only of Officers, but of Common Men, who had promised, and listed themselves under several Officers; and he imputed the security he had enjoyed so long, notwithstanding his purpose was so generally known, to the apprehension both the Parliament and the Army had of the Af∣fections of the City to joyn with him; and he believ'd, that he should not only remain secure at <HI>Kingston,</HI> as long as he should think fit to stay there, but that some entire Regiments of the City would march out with him for the Relief of <HI>Colchester.</HI></P>
<P>DURING the short stay he made at <HI>Kingston,</HI> some Officers and Sol∣diers, both of Horse and Foot, came thither, and many Persons of Ho∣nour <MILESTONE N="50"/> and Quality, in their Coaches, came to visit Him and his Com∣pany from <HI>London;</HI> and return'd thither again to provide what was still wanting, and resolv'd to be with him soon enough. The principal Officer
<PB N="136" REF="1560"/>
the Earl relied upon (though he had better) was <HI>Dalbeer</HI> a <HI>Dutch-</HI>man, of name and reputation, and good experience in War; who had serv'd the Parliament as Commissary General of the Horse under the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and having been left out in the new model, was amongst those discontented Officers who looked for an opportunity to be revenged of the Army; which they despised for their ill breeding, and much preach∣ing. Thus <HI>Dalbeer</HI> was glad to depend upon the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who thought himself likewise happy in such an Officer. The keeping good Guards, and sending out Parties towards the <HI>Kentish</HI> parts, where it was known some Troops remain'd since the last commotion there, was <MILESTONE N="10"/> committed to His care. But he discharged it so ill, or his Orders were so ill observ'd, that the second or third morning after their coming to <HI>Kingston,</HI> some of the Parliament's Foot, with two or three Troops of Colonel <HI>Rich</HI>'s Horse, fell upon a Party of the Earl's about <HI>Nonsuch;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Is routed there:</NOTE> and beat, and pursued them into <HI>Kingston,</HI> before those within had no∣tice to be ready to receive them; the Earl and most of the rest making too much hast out of Town, and never offering to Charge those Troops. In this confusion the Lord <HI>Francis Villiers,</HI> a youth of rare Beauty and comliness of Person, endeavouring to make resistance, was unfortunately killed, with one or two more but of little note. Most of <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Foot made a shift to conceal themselves, and some Officers, until they found means to retire to their close Mansions in <HI>London.</HI> The Earl with near an hundred Horse (the rest wisely taking the way to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> where they were never inquired after) wander'd without purpose, or design, and was, two or three days after, beset in an Inn at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Neots</HI> in <HI>Huntingtonshire,</HI> by those few Horse who pursued him, being joyn'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Escapes to S<SUP>t</SUP></HI> Neots, <HI>where he is taken.</HI></NOTE> with some Troops of Colonel <HI>Scroop</HI>'s; where the Earl deliver'd him∣self Prisoner to the Officer without resistance: yet at the same time <HI>Dalbeer</HI> and <HI>Kenelm Digby,</HI> the eldest Son of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Kenelm,</HI> were killed upon the place; whether out of former grudges, or that they offer'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> to defend themselves, was not known; and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> escaped, and happily found a way into <HI>London;</HI> where he lay concealed, till he had an opportunity to secure himself by being transported into <HI>Holland;</HI> where the Prince was; who receiv'd him with great grace and kindness. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> remain'd Prisoner in the place where he was taken, till by Order from the Parliament he was sent to <HI>Warwick</HI> Castle, where he was kept Prisoner with great strictness.</P>
<P>THE total defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army lately mention'd succeeded this, and when those Noble Persons within <HI>Colchester,</HI> were advertised of both, they knew well that there was no possibility of relief, nor could <MILESTONE N="40"/> they subsist longer to expect it, being pressed with want of all kind of Victual, and having eaten near all their Horses. They sent therefore to <HI>Fairfax,</HI> to treat about the delivery of the Town upon reasonable con∣ditions, but he refused to treat, or give any conditions, if they would not render to mercy all the Officers, and Gentlemen; the Common Sol∣diers he was contented to dismiss. A day or two was spent in delibera∣tion. <Q>They within, proposed “to make a brisk Sally; and thereby to” shift for themselves, as many as could.</Q> But they had too few Horse, and the few that were left uneaten were too weak for that Enterprise. <Q>Then, “that they should open a Port, and every Man die with their” <MILESTONE N="50"/> Armes in their hands;</Q> but that way they could only be sure of be∣ing killed, without much hurting their Adversaries, who had ways enough securely to assault them. Hereupon, they were in the end obliged
<PB N="137" REF="1570"/>
to deliver themselves up Prisoners at mercy; and were, all the Officers <NOTE PLACE="marg">Colchester <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></NOTE> and Gentlemen, led into the publick Hall of the Town; where they were locked up, and a strong Guard set upon them. They were required presently to send a list of all their Names to the General; which they did; and, within a short time after, a Guard was sent to bring S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Lisle,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bernard Gascoigne</HI> to the General, being sate with his Council of War. <Q>They were carried in, and in a very short discourse told, “that after so long and so obstinate a defence un∣til they found it necessary to deliver themselves up to mercy, it was necessary, for the example of others, and that the Peace of the King∣dom <MILESTONE N="10"/> might be no more disturbed in that manner, that some Military justice should be executed; and therefore, that Council had deter∣min'd” they three should be presently shot to death;</Q> for which they were advised to prepare themselves; and without considering, or hear∣ing what they had a mind to say for themselves, they were led into a Yard there by; where they found three Files of Musqueteers ready for their dispatch.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Bernard Gascoigne</HI> was a Gentleman of <HI>Florence;</HI> and had serv'd the King in the War, and afterwards remain'd in <HI>London</HI> till the un∣happy adventure of <HI>Colchester,</HI> and then accompanied his Friends thi∣ther; <MILESTONE N="20"/> and had only <HI>English</HI> enough to make himself understood, that he desired a Pen and Ink and Paper, that he might write a Letter to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prince the Great Duke, that his Highness might know in what manner he lost his Life, to the end his Heirs might possess his Estate. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Of∣ficer that attended the execution thought fit to acquaint the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Council, without which he durst not allow him Pen and Ink, which he thought he might reasonably demand: When they were inform'd of it, they thought it a matter worthy some consideration▪ they had chosen him out of the list for his Quality, conceiving him to be an <HI>English</HI> Gen∣tleman; and preferr'd him for being a Knight, that they might sacrifice <MILESTONE N="30"/> three of that rank.</P>
<P>THIS delay brought the News of this bloody resolution to the Pri∣soners in the Town; who were infinitely afflicted with it; and the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> prevailed with an Officer, or Soldier of their Guard, to carry a Letter, sign'd by the chief Persons and Officers, and in the name of the rest, to the General; in which they took notice of that judgement, and desired him <Q>“either to forbear the execution of it, or that they might all, who were equally guilty with those three, undergo the same Sen∣tence” with Them.</Q> The Letter was deliver'd, but had no other effect than the sending to the Officer to dispatch his Order, reserving the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> to the last. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Charles Lucas</HI> was their first work; who fell dead; upon which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Lisle</HI> ran to him, embraced, and kissed him; and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>and S<SUP>•</SUP></HI> Lisle <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> death.</HI></NOTE> then stood up, and looked those who were to execute him in the face; and thinking they stood at too great a distance, spake to them to come nearer; to which one of them said, <Q>“”I'le warrant you,</Q> S<SUP>r</SUP>, Wee'll hit you: he Answer'd smiling, <Q>“Friends, I have been nearer you, when you have” miss'd me.</Q> Thereupon, they all fired upon him, and did their work home, so that he fell down dead of many wounds without speaking word. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bernard Gascoigne</HI> had his doublet off, and expected the next turn; but the Officer told him <Q>“”he had order to carry him back to his Friends;</Q> <MILESTONE N="50"/> which at that time was very indifferent to him. The Council of War had consider'd, that if they should in this manner have taken the Life of a Forreigner, who seem'd to be a Person of Quality, their Friends or
<PB N="138" REF="1580"/>
Children who should visit <HI>Italy,</HI> might pay dear for many Generations; and therefore they commanded the Officer, <Q>“when the other two should” be dead, to carry him back again to the other Prisoners.</Q></P>
<P>THE two who were thus murther'd, were Men of great name and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Chara∣cters</NOTE> esteem in the War; the one being held as good a Commander of Horse, and the other of Foot, as the Nation had; but of very different tem∣pers and humours. <HI>Lucas</HI> was the younger Brother of the Lord <HI>Lucas,</HI> and his Heir both to the Honour and Estate, and had a present Fortune of his own. He had been bred in the Low Countries under the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and allways amongst the Horse. He had little conversation <MILESTONE N="10"/> in that Court, where great civility was practiced, and learned. He was very brave in his Person, and in a day of Battle a gallant Man to look upon, and follow; but at all other times and places, of a Nature scarce to be liv'd with, of no good understanding, of a rough and proud hu∣mour, and very morose conversation; yet they all desired to accom∣pany him in his death. <HI>Lisle</HI> was a Gentleman who had had the same Education with the other, and at the same time an Officer of Foot; had all the Courage of the other, and led his Men to a Battle with such an alacrity, that no Man was ever better followed, his Soldiers never forsaking him; and the party which he commanded, never left any thing <MILESTONE N="20"/> undone which he led them upon. But then, to his fierceness of Cou∣rage he had the softest and most gentle nature imaginable; was kind to all, and belov'd of all, and without a Capacity to have an Enemy.</P>
<P>THE manner of taking the Lives of these worthy Men was new, and without Example, and concluded by most Men to be very barbarous; and was generally imputed to <HI>Ireton,</HI> who swayed the General, and was upon all occasions of an unmerciful and bloody Nature. Assoon as this bloody Sacrifice was ended, <HI>Fairfax,</HI> with the Chief Officers, went to the Town House to visit the Prisoners; and the General (who was an ill Orator on the most plausible occasion) applied with his civility to the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Capel;</HI> and, seeming in some degree to excuse the having done that, <Q>which he said “the Military justice re∣quired,”</Q> he told them, <Q>“that all the Lives of the rest were safe; and that they should be well treated, and disposed of as the Parliament” should direct.</Q> The Lord <HI>Capel</HI> had not so soon digested this so late barbarous proceeding, as to receive the visit of those who caused it, with such a return as his condition might have prompted to him; <Q>but said, “that they should do well to finish their work, and execute the same” rigour to the rest;</Q> upon which there were two or three such sharp and bitter replies between Him and <HI>Ireton,</HI> that cost him his Life in few <MILESTONE N="40"/> Months after. When the General had given notice to the Parliament of his proceedings, he receiv'd order to send the Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> and the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> to <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle; where they had afterwards the So∣ciety of Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> to lament each others misfortunes; and after some time they two were sent to the Tower.</P>
<P>THOUGH the City had undergone so many severe Mortifications, that it might very well have been discouraged from entring into any more dangerous Engagements, at least all other People might have been terrified from depending again upon such Engagements, yet the present fright was no sooner over than they recover'd new spirits for new un∣dertakings; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The behaviour of the City at this time.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> and seem'd allways to have observ'd somewhat in the last miscarriage which might be hereafter prevented, and no more obstruct their future proceedings; and many in the Parliament, as well as in the
<PB N="139" REF="1590"/>
City, who were controlled and dispirited by the presence of the Army, when that was at a distance appear'd resolute, and brisk in any contra∣diction and opposition of their Counsels. So that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had no sooner begun his March towards the North, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> his into <HI>Kent,</HI> but the Common Council deliver'd a Petition to the Parliament, <Q>“that <NOTE PLACE="marg">They Petition for a personal Treaty.</NOTE> they would entertain a personal Treaty with the King, that the King∣dom might be restored again to a happy Peace; which could be hoped” for no other way.</Q> This was the first presumption that had been offer'd, since their Vote of no more Addresses to be made to the King; which had been near half a year before: and this seem'd to be made with so <MILESTONE N="10"/> universal a concurrence of the City, that the Parliament durst not give a positive refusal to it. And in truth the Major part thereof did really desire the same thing; which made S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> and that Party in the Parliament to which the Army adher'd, or rather which adher'd to the Army, to contrive some specious way to defer and delay it by seem∣ing to consent to it, rather than to oppose the motion. And therefore they appointed a Committee of the House of Commons, to meet with <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee of Parliament treats with them about it.</NOTE> such a Committee of the Common Council, as they should make choice of, to confer together of the ways and means to provide for the King's safety and security during the time of the Treaty: which Committee <MILESTONE N="20"/> being met together, that of the House of Commons perplexed the other with many Questions, <Q>“what they meant by those Expressions, they” used in their Petition</Q> (and had been the Common Expressions, long used both by the King and the Parliament, in all applications which had concern'd a Treaty) <Q>“that his Majesty might treat with honour, free∣dom, and safety? what they intended by those words? and whether the City would be at the Charge in maintaining those Guards, which were to be kept for the security of the King during such Treaty; and if the King should in that Treaty refuse to give the Parliament satis∣faction,” how his Person should be disposed of?</Q> and many such Que∣stions, <MILESTONE N="30"/> to which they well knew that the Committee it self could make no Answer, but that there must be another Common Council called, to which they must repair for directions. And by this means, and ad∣ministring new Questions at every meeting; much time was spent, and the delays they wished could not be avoided. So that notwithstanding all the City's earnestness that the Treaty might be presently enter'd upon, it was delayed till the Insurrection in <HI>Kent,</HI> and the designs of the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> (to both which they had promised another kind of Assistance) were both disappointed, and expired. However, the Prince was still in the <HI>Downs</HI> with his Fleet, and the Gentlemen in <HI>Colchester</HI> defended <MILESTONE N="40"/> themselves resolutely, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Army was enter'd the Kingdom, all which kept up their Courage; insomuch as, after all the delays, the Par∣liament consented, and declared, <Q>“that they would enter into a per∣sonal <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment declares for a personal Treaty.</NOTE> Treaty with the King for the settling the Peace of the Kingdom; but that the Treaty should be in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> where his Majesty” should enjoy honour, freedom, and safety.</Q></P>
<P>THE City had offer'd before to the Committee, upon some of the Questions which had been administer'd to them, <Q>“that if the Treaty might be in <HI>London,</HI> they would be at the Charge of maintaining those Guards which should be necessary for the safety and security of the” <MILESTONE N="50"/> King;</Q> and therefore they were very much troubled, that the Treaty should be now in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> upon which they could have no in∣fluence; yet they thought not fit to make any new Instances for change
<PB N="140" REF="1600"/>
of the place, lest the Parliament might recede from their Vote, that there should be a Treaty enter'd upon. So they only renew'd their im∣portunity, that all expedition might be used; and in spight of all de∣lays, in the beginning of <HI>August</HI> a Committee was sent from both Houses <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Committee of both Houses sent to the King for that purpose in the beginning of</HI> August. <HI>The Substance of their Mes∣sage to the King.</HI></NOTE> to the King to <HI>Carisbrooke</HI> Castle, where he had been close shut up about half a year, without being suffer'd to speak with any but such who were appointed by them to attend, and watch him.</P>
<P><Q>THE Message the Committee deliver'd was, “that the Houses did desire a Treaty with his Majesty, in what place of the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> he would appoint, upon the Propositions tender'd to him at <HI>Hampton</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> Court, and such other Propositions, as they should cause to be pre∣sented to him; and that his Majesty should enjoy honour, freedom,” and safety to his Person.</Q> The Messengers, who were one of the House of Peers and two Commoners, were to return within ten days, no body being very strict in the limitation of time to a day, because the Treaty was so much the longer kept off, which they hoped still would by some accident be prevented.</P>
<P><Q>THE King receiv'd them very graciously, and told them, “they could not believe that any Man could desire a Peace more heartily than Him∣self, because no Man suffer'd so much by the want of it: that, though <MILESTONE N="20"/> he was without any Man to consult with, and without a Secretary to write what he should dictate, yet they should not be put to stay long” for an Answer;</Q> which he gave them within two or three days, all written in his own hand; <Q>in which, after he had lamented his present condition, and the extreme restraint he was under, he said, “he did very <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer.</NOTE> chearfully embrace their motion, and accepted a Treaty They promised should be with honour, freedom, and safety; which he hoped they did really intend should be perform'd; for that, in the condition he was in, he was so totally ignorant, and uniform'd of the present State of all his Dominions, that a blind Man was as fit to judge of Colours, as <MILESTONE N="30"/> He was to treat concerning the Peace of the Kingdom, except they would first revoke their Votes, and Orders, by which all Men were prohibited, and forbid to come, write, or speak to him. For the place, he could have wished, for the expedition that would have resulted from thence, that it might have been in or near <HI>London,</HI> to the end that the Parliament's resolution and determination might have been sooner known upon any emergent occasion that might have grown in the Treaty, than it could be at such a distance: however, since they had resolv'd that it should be in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> he would not ex∣cept against it, but named the Town of <HI>Newport</HI> for the place of the” <MILESTONE N="40"/> Treaty.</Q> <Q>He said, “though he desired all expedition might be used to∣wards the beginning and ending the Treaty, yet he should not think himself in any freedom to treat, except, before the Treaty begun, all such Persons might have liberty to repair to him, whose advice and” assistance he should stand in need of in the Treaty.</Q> He sent a List of the names of those his Servants which he desired might be admitted to come to him, and attend upon him; whereof the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and <HI>Lindsey,</HI> were the chief; all four Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, and of his Privy Council. He named likewise all the other Servants, whose attendance <MILESTONE N="50"/> he desired in their several Offices. He sent a List of the names of seve∣ral Bishops, and of such of his Chaplains, as he desired to confer with, and of many common Lawyers, and some Civilians, whose advice he
<PB N="141" REF="1610"/>
might have occasion to use, and desired, <Q>“that he might be in the same State of freedom, as he enjoyed whilst he had been at <HI>Hampton”</HI> Court.</Q></P>
<P>BY the time that the Commissioners return'd from the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and deliver'd this Answer to the Parliament, news was brought of the defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> had written to his Friends, <Q>“what a perpetual Ignominy it would be to the Parliament, that no body abroad or at home would ever give credit to them, if they should re∣cede from their former Vote, and Declaration of no farther Addresses” to the King, and conjured them to continue firm in that resolution.</Q> <MILESTONE N="10"/> But they had gone too far now to recede, and since the first motion and petition from the Common Council for a Treaty, very many Members, who had opposed the Vote and Declaration of no more Addresses, and from the time that had passed, had forborne ever to be present in the Parliament, upon the first mention of a Treaty, flocked again to the House, and advanced that Overture; so that they were much superior in Number to those who endeavour'd first to obstruct and delay, and now hoped absolutely to frustrate all that had been proposed towards a Treaty. And the great Victory which had been obtained against the <HI>Scots,</HI> and which they concluded must speedily reduce <HI>Colchester,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="20"/> put a quick period to all other attempts against the Parliament, made them more earnest and sollicitous for a Treaty; which was all the hope left to prevent that confusion they discern'd was the purpose of the Ar∣my to bring upon the Kingdom: and so with the more Vigour they pressed <Q>“that satisfaction might be given to the King, in all that he had” proposed in his Answer;</Q> and, notwithstanding all opposition, it was declared, <Q>“that the Vote for no more Addresses should stand repealed: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Vote of no more Ad∣dresses repeal∣ed; and the Treaty to be at</HI> Newport.</NOTE> that the Treaty should be at <HI>Newport;</HI> and that his Majesty should be there in the same freedom in which he was at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court; that <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Instructions to Colonel <HI>Hammond,</HI> by which the King had been in that manner restrain'd, and all Persons forbid from going to him, should be recalled; that all those Persons who were named by the King, should have free liberty to repair to him, and to remain with him” without being question'd, or troubled.</Q> And having proceeded thus far, they nominated five Lords, and ten Commoners to be the Commis∣sioners who should treat with the King, and who were enjoyn'd to pre∣pare all things to be in readiness for the Treaty with all possible ex∣pedition; but S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> being one of those Commissioners, used all his Arts to obstruct and delay it, in hope that <HI>Cromwell</HI> would dispatch his Affairs in <HI>Scotland</HI> time enough to return, and to use more <MILESTONE N="40"/> effectual and powerful Arguments against it, than He was furnished withal.</P>
<P>ALL these occurrences were very well known to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and were the motives which perswaded him to believe, that his presence at the Parliament was so necessary to suppress the Presbyterians, who ceased not to vex him at any distance, that he would not be prevailed with to stay and finish that only work of difficulty that remain'd to be done, which was the reducing <HI>Pontfret</HI> Castle; but left <HI>Lambert</HI> to make an end of it, and to revenge the death of <HI>Rainsborough,</HI> who had lost his Life by that Garrison, with some circumstances which deserve to <MILESTONE N="50"/> be remember'd; as in truth all that adventure in the taking, and de∣fending that place, should be preserv'd by a very particular relation, for the honour of all the Persons who were engaged in it.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="1620"/>
WHEN the first War had been brought to an end by the reduction <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the taking</HI> Pontfret <HI>Ca∣stle for the King.</HI></NOTE> of all places, and Persons, which had held for the King, and all Men's hopes had been render'd desperate, by the imprisonment of his Majesty in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> those Officers and Gentlemen who had serv'd, whilst there was any Service, betook themselves generally to the habi∣tations they had in the several Counties; where they liv'd quietly and privately, under the insolence of those Neighbours who had formerly, by the inferiority of their conditions, submitted to them. When the Parliament had finished the War, they reduced and slighted most of the Inland Garrisons, the maintainance whereof was very chargeable: yet <MILESTONE N="10"/> by the Interest of some Person who commanded it, or out of the con∣sideration of the strength and importance of the place, they kept still a Garrison in <HI>Pontfret</HI> Castle, a noble Royalty and Palace belonging to the Crown, and then part of the Queen's Joynture. The Situation in it self was very strong; no part whereof was commanded by any other ground: the House very large, with all offices suitable to a Princely Seat, and though built very near the top of a Hill, so that it had the prospect of a great part of the West Riding of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and of <HI>Lincoln-shire,</HI> and <HI>Nottingham-shire,</HI> yet it was plentifully supplied with Water. Colonel <HI>Cotterell,</HI> the Governour of this Castle, exercised a very severe <MILESTONE N="20"/> jurisdiction over his Neighbours of those parts; which were inhabited by many Gentlemen, and Soldiers, who had serv'd the King throughout the War, and who were known to retain their old Affections, though they liv'd quietly under the present Government. Upon the least jea∣lousy or humour, these Men were frequently sent for, reproached, and sometimes imprisoned by the Governour in this Garrison; which did not render them the more devoted to him. When there appeared some hopes that the <HI>Scots</HI> would raise an Army for the relief and release of the King, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> in his way for <HI>Scotland,</HI> had vi∣sited and conferr'd with some of his old Friends and Country-men, who <MILESTONE N="30"/> now liv'd quietly within some distance of <HI>Pontfret,</HI> who inform'd him of that Garrison, the place whereof was well known to him. And he acquainting them with the Assurance he had of the resolution of the principal Persons of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that they had invited him to joyn with them, in order to which he was then going thither, they agreed, <Q>“that, when it should appear that an Army was raised in <HI>Scotland</HI> upon that account, which must draw down the Parliament's Army into the other Northern Counties, and that there should be” Risings in other parts of the Kingdom</Q> (which the general indisposition and discontent, besides some particular designs, made like to fall out <MILESTONE N="40"/> <Q>“that then those Gentlemen should endeavour the surprise of that Ca∣stle, and after they had made themselves strong in it, and furnished it with Provisions to endure some restraint, they should draw as good” a Body to them as those Countries would yield: and having thus ad∣justed that design,</Q> they settled such a way of correspondence with S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke,</HI> that they frequently gave him an account, and receiv'd his directions for their proceeding. In this disposition they continued quiet, as they had allways been; and the Governour of the Castle liv'd towards them with less jealousy, and more humanity, than he had been accustom'd to. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THERE was one Colonel <HI>Morrice,</HI> who, being a very young Man, had, in the beginning of the War, been an Officer in some Regiments of the King's; and out of the folly and impatience of his Youth, had quitted
<PB N="143" REF="1630"/>
that Service, and engaged himself in the Parliament Army with some circumstances not very commendable; and by the clearness of his Cou∣rage, and pleasantness of his humour, made himself not only very ac∣ceptable, but was preferr'd to the command of a Colonel, and perform'd many notable Services for them, being a stout and bold undertaker in attempts of the greatest danger; wherein he had usually success. After the new modelling of the Army, and the introducing of a stricter disci∣pline, his Life of great Licence kept not his reputation with the new Officers; and being a free Speaker and Censurer of their affected beha∣viour, they left him out in their compounding their new Army, but <MILESTONE N="10"/> with many professions of kindness, and respect to his eminent Courage, which they would find some occasion to imploy, and reward. He was a Gentleman of a competent Estate in those parts in <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> and as he had grown elder, he had heartily detested himself for having quitted the King's Service, and had resolv'd to take some seasonable opportu∣nity to wipe off that blemish by a service that would redeem him; and so was not troubled to be set aside by the new General, but betook him∣self to his Estate; enjoyed his old humour, which was chearful and plea∣sant; and made himself most acceptable to those who were most trusted by the Parliament; who thought that they had dismissed one of the best <MILESTONE N="20"/> Officers they had, and were sorry for it.</P>
<P>HE now, as a Country Gentleman, frequented the Faires and Markets, and conversed with equal freedom with all his Neighbours, of what Party soever they had been, and renewed the friendship he had formerly held with some of those Gentlemen who had serv'd the King. But no friendship was so dear to him, as that of the Governour of <HI>Pontfret</HI> Castle, who lov'd him above all Men, and delighted so much in his Com∣pany, that he got him to be with him some times a week and more at a time in the Castle, when they allways lay together in one Bed. He declared to one of those Gentlemen, who were united together to make <MILESTONE N="30"/> that attempt, <Q>“that he would surprise that Castle, whenever they should” think the Season ripe for it,</Q> and that Gentleman, who knew him very well, believ'd him so entirely, that he told his Companies, <Q>“that they should not trouble themselves with contriving the means to sur∣prise the place; which, by trusting too many, would be liable to dis∣covery; but that he would take that charge upon himself, by a way” they need not enquire into;</Q> which he assured them should not fail: and they all very willingly acquiesced in his undertaking; to which they knew well he was not inclined without good grounds. <HI>Morrice</HI> was more frequently with the Governour, who never thought himself well <MILESTONE N="40"/> without him; and allways told him <Q>“he must have a great care of his Garrison, that he had none but faithful Men in the Castle; for that he was confident there were some Men, who liv'd not far off, and who” many times came to visit him, had some design upon the place;</Q> and would then in confidence name many Persons to him, some whereof were those very Men with whom he communicated, and others were Men of another temper, and were most devoted to the Parliament, all his particular Friends and Companions; <Q>“but that he should not be troubled; for he had a false Brother amongst them, from whom he” was sure to have seasonable Advertisement;</Q> <Q>and promised him, “that <MILESTONE N="50"/> he would, within few hours notice, bring him at any time forty or fifty good Men into the Castle to reinforce his Garrison, when there” should be occasion;</Q> and he would shew him the list of such Men, as
<PB N="144" REF="1640"/>
would be allways ready, and would sometimes bring some of those Men with him, and tell the Governour before them, <Q>“that those were in the list he had given him of the honest fellows, who would stick to him” when there should be need;</Q> and others would accidentally tell the Go∣vernour, <Q>“that they had listed themselves with Colonel <HI>Morrice</HI> to come” to the Castle, whenever he should call or send to them.</Q> And all these Men thus listed, were fellows very notorious for the bitterness and ma∣lice which they had allways against the King, not one of which he ever intended to make use of.</P>
<P>HE made himself very familiar with all the Soldiers in the Castle, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> used to play and drink with them; and when he lay there, would often rise in the night, and visit the Guards; and by that means would some∣times make the Governour dismiss, and discharge a Soldier whom he did not like, under pretence <Q>“”that he found him allways a sleep, or some other fault which was not to be examin'd;</Q> and then he would com∣mend some other to him as very fit to be trusted and relied upon; and by this means he had very much power in the Garrison. The Gover∣nour receiv'd several Letters from his Friends in the Parliament, and in the Country, <Q>“that he should take care of Colonel <HI>Morrice,</HI> who re∣solv'd” to betray him;</Q> and inform'd him, <Q>“that he had been in such <MILESTONE N="20"/> and such Company of Men, who were generally esteem'd most Ma∣lignant,” and had great Intrigues with them;</Q> all which was well known to the Governour; for the other was never in any of that Company, though with all the shew of secrecy, in the night, or in places remote from any House, but he allways told the Governour of it, and of many particular passages in those meetings; so that when these Letters came to him, he shewed them still to the other; and then both of them laughed at the Intelligence; after which <HI>Morrice</HI> frequently called for his Horse, and went home to his House, telling his Friend <Q>“that though he had, he knew, no mistrust of his friendship, and knew him too well to think <MILESTONE N="30"/> him capable of such baseness, yet he ought not for his own sake be thought to slight the information; which would make his Friends the less careful of him: that they had reason to give him warning of those meetings, which, if he had not known himself, had been very worthy of his suspicion; therefore he would forbear coming to the Castle again, till this jealousy of his Friends should be over; who would know of” this, and be satisfied with it: and no power of the Governour could prevail with him, at such times, to stay;</Q> but he would be gone, and stay away till he was, after some time, sent for again with great impor∣tunity, the Governour desiring his Counsel and Assistance as much as <MILESTONE N="40"/> his Company.</P>
<P>IT fell out, as it usually doth in Affairs of that nature, when many Men are engaged, that there is an impatience to execute what is projected before the time be throughly ripe. The business of the Fleet, and in <HI>Kent,</HI> and other places, and the daily Alarms from <HI>Scotland,</HI> as if that Army had been entring the Kingdom, made the Gentlemen who were engaged for this Enterprise, imagine that they deferr'd it too long, and that though they had receiv'd no Orders from S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> which they were to expect, yet they had been sent, and miscarried. Here∣upon They called upon the Gentlemen who had undertaken, and He <MILESTONE N="50"/> upon <HI>Morrice,</HI> for the Execution of the design. The time agreed upon was such a night, when the Surprisers were to be ready upon such a part of the Wall, and to have Ladders to mount in two places, where two
<PB N="145" REF="1650"/>
Soldiers were to be appointed for Sentinels who were privy to the at∣tempt. <HI>Morrice</HI> was in the Castle, and in Bed with the Governour, and, according to his custom, rose about the hour he thought all would be ready. They without, made the Sign agreed upon, and were Answer'd by one of the Sentinels from the Wall; upon which they run to both places where they were to mount their Ladders. By some Accident, the other Sentinel who was design'd, was not upon the other part of the Wall; but when the Ladder was mounted there, the Sentinel called out; and finding that there were Men under the Wall, run towards the Court of Guard to call for help; which gave an Alarm to the Garrison: <MILESTONE N="10"/> so that, for that time, the design was disappointed. But, shortly after, <HI>Morrice,</HI> and some of the same Gentlemen surprised the Castle, under the disguise of Country-men coming in with Carts of Provision; and presently seised on and master'd the main Guard, and made way for their Friends, Horse and Foot, to enter. Then two or three of them went to the Governour's Chamber, whom they found in his Bed, and told him <Q>“”the Castle was surprised, and himself a Prisoner.</Q> He betook him∣self to his Armes for his defence, but quickly found that his Friend had betrayed it, and the other Gentlemen appearing, of whom he had been before warn'd, his defence was to no purpose, yet he receiv'd some <MILESTONE N="20"/> wounds. <HI>Morrice</HI> afterwards comforted him with assurance <Q>“of good usage, and that he would procure his pardon from the King for his” Rebellion.</Q></P>
<P>THEY put the Garrison in good order, and so many came to them from <HI>Yorkshire, Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> that they could not in a short time be restrain'd, and had leisure to fetch in all sorts of Provisions for their support, and to make and renew such Fortifications as might be necessary for their defence. From <HI>Nottingham</HI> there came S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Digby,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hugh Cartwright,</HI> and a Son and Nephew of his, who had been good Officers in the Army, with many Soldiers who had been under their <MILESTONE N="30"/> Command; many other Gentlemen of the three Counties were present, and deserve to have their Names recorded, since it was an Action through∣out of great Courage and Conduct.</P>
<P>CROMWELL'S marching towards the <HI>Scots</HI> with the neglect of these Men after their first appearance, and only appointing some County Troops to inclose them from increasing their strength, gave them great opportunity to grow; so that driving those Troops to a greater distance, they drew contribution from all the parts about them, and made incur∣sions much farther, and render'd themselves so terrible, that, as was said before, after the <HI>Scots</HI> defeat, those of <HI>Yorkshire</HI> sent very earnestly <MILESTONE N="40"/> to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> <Q>“that he would make it the business of his Army to re∣duce” <HI>Pontfret.</HI></Q> But he, resolving upon his <HI>Scotish</HI> Expedition, thought it enough to send <HI>Rainsborough</HI> to perform that Service, with a Regi∣ment of Horse, and one or two of Foot, belonging to the Army; which, with a conjunction of the Country Forces under the same Command, he doubted not would be sufficient to perform a greater work. Assoon as the Castle had been reduced, they who were possessed of it were very willing to be under the Command of <HI>Morrice;</HI> who declared he would not accept the Charge, nor be Governour of the place, knowing well what jealousies he might be liable to, at least upon any change of for∣tune, <MILESTONE N="50"/> but under the direction of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Digby;</HI> who was Colonel Ge∣neral of those parts, and was a Man rather cordial in the Service, than equal to the Command; which made him refer all things still to the
<PB N="146" REF="1660"/>
counsel, and conduct of those Officers who were under him; by whose activity, as much was done as could be expected from such a knot of resolute Persons.</P>
<P>THE total defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army being now generally known, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Part of the Garrison's at∣tempt upon</HI> Rainsborough.</NOTE> that their Friends in all other places were defeated, they in the Castle well knew what they were presently to expect, and that they should be shortly shut up from making farther excursions. They heard that <HI>Rains∣borough</HI> was upon his march towards them, and had already sent some Troops to be Quarter'd near them, himself yet keeping his Head Quar∣ters at <HI>Doncaster,</HI> ten miles from the Castle. They resolv'd, whilst they <MILESTONE N="10"/> yet enjoyed this liberty, to make a noble attempt. They had been in∣form'd, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> (whom they still called their Ge∣neral) after the overthrow of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, had been taken Prisoner, and remained in <HI>Nottingham</HI> Castle under a most strict custody, as a Man the Parliament declared, <Q>“they would make an example of their” justice.</Q> A Party of about twenty Horse, but picked and choice Men, went out of the Castle, in the beginning of the Night, with a Resolu∣tion to take <HI>Rainsborough</HI> Prisoner, and thereby to ransom their Ge∣neral. They were all good Guides, and understood the ways, private and publick, very exactly; and went so far, that about the break of day or <MILESTONE N="20"/> a little after, in the end of <HI>August,</HI> they put themselves into the Com∣mon Road that led from <HI>York;</HI> by which ways the Guards expected no Enemy; and so slightly asked them <Q>“”whence they came? who negli∣gently Answer'd;</Q> and asked again, <Q>“where their General was? saying,” they had a Letter for him from <HI>Cromwell.</HI></Q> They sent one to shew them where the General was; which they knew well enough; and that he lay at the best Inn of the Town. And when the Gate of the Inn was opened to them, three of them only enter'd into the Inn, the other rode to the other end of the Town to the Bridge, over which they were to pass towards <HI>Pontfret;</HI> where they expected, and did find a Guard of <MILESTONE N="30"/> Horse and Foot, with whom they entertain'd themselves in discourse, saying <Q>“that they stayed for their Officer, who went only in to speak” with the General; and called for some drink.</Q> The Guards making no question of their being Friends, sent for drink, and talked negligently with them of News; and, it being broad day, some of the Horse alighted, and the Foot went to the Court of Guard, conceiving that Morning's work to be over. They who went into the Inn, where no body was a wake but the fellow who opened the Gate, asked in which Chamber the General (for so all the Soldiers called <HI>Rainsborough)</HI> lay; and the fellow shewing them from below the Chamber door, two of them went up, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and the other stayed below, and held the Horses, and talked with the Soldier who had walked with them from the Guard. The two who went up, open'd the Chamber door, found <HI>Rainsborough</HI> in his Bed, but awaked with the little noise they had made. <Q>They told him in short “that he was their Prisoner, and that it was in his power to choose” whether he would be presently killed</Q> (for which work he saw they were very well prepared) <Q>“or quietly, without making resistance, or delay, to put on his Cloaths and be mounted upon a Horse, that was” ready below for him, and accompany them to <HI>Pontfret.</HI></Q> The present danger awaken'd him out of the amazement he was in, so that he told <MILESTONE N="50"/> them he would wait upon them, and made the hast that was necessary to put on his Cloaths. One of them took his Sword, and so they led him down stairs. He that held the Horses, had sent the Soldiers away
<PB N="147" REF="1670"/>
to those who were gone before, to speak to them to get some drink, and any thing else, that could be made ready in the House, against they came. When <HI>Rainsborough</HI> came into the Street, which he expected to find full of Horse, and saw only one Man, who held the others Horses, and presently mounted that he might be bound behind him, he begun to struggle, and to cry out. Whereupon, when they saw no hope of car∣rying him away, they immediately run him through with their Swords; and, leaving him dead upon the ground, they got upon their Horses, and rode towards their fellows, before any in the Inn could be ready to follow them. When those at the Bridge saw their Companions coming, <MILESTONE N="10"/> which was their sign, being well prepared, and knowing what they were to do, they turn'd upon the Guard, and made them fly in distraction; so that the way was clear and free; and though they missed carrying home the prize for which they had made so lusty an adventure, they joyn'd together, and marched, with the Expedition that was necessary, a shorter way than they had come, to their Garrison; leaving the Town, and Soldiers behind in such a consternation, that, not being able to re∣ceive any information from their General, whom they found dead upon the ground without any Body in view, they thought the Devil had been there; and could not recollect themselves, which way they were to pur∣sue <MILESTONE N="20"/> an Enemy they had not seen. The Gallant Party came safe home without the least damage to Horse or Man, hoping to make some other attempt more successfully, by which they might redeem S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale.</HI> There was not an Officer in the Army whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> would not as willingly have lost as this Man; who was bold and barbarous to his wish, and fit to be entrusted in the most desperate Interest, and was the Man whom that Party allways intended to commit the Maritime Affairs to, when it should be time to dismiss the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> he having been bred in that Element, and knowing the duty of it very well, though he had that misfortune spoken of in the beginning of the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Summer.</P>
<P>AND now to finish this business of <HI>Pontsret</HI> altogether, which lasted near to the end of this year, when <HI>Lambert</HI> came to this charge (in∣structed by <HI>Cromwell</HI> to take full Vengeance for the loss of <HI>Rainsborough,</HI> to whose Ghost he design'd an ample sacrifice) and kept what Body of Men he thought fit for that purpose, he reduced them in a short time within their own circuit, making good Works round about the Castle, that they might at last yield to Hunger, if nothing else would reclaim them. Nor did they quietly suffer themselves to be cooped up without bold and frequent Sallies, in which many of the Besiegers, as well as <MILESTONE N="40"/> the others, lost their Lives. They discover'd many of the Country who held correspondence with, and gave Intelligence to the Castle, whom they apprehended, whereof there were two Divines, and some Women of Note, Friends and Allies to the besieged. After frequent Mortifica∣tions of this kind, and no human hope of relief, they were content to offer to Treat for the Delivery of the Castle, if they might have ho∣nourable Conditions; <Q>if not, they sent word “that they had Provisions yet for a good time; that they durst die, and would sell their Lives at as dear a price as they could. <HI>Lambert</HI> Answer'd, that he knew they were gallant Men, and that he desired to preserve as many of them, <MILESTONE N="50"/> as was in his power to do, but he must require six of them to be given up to him, whose Lives he could not save; which he was sorry for,” since they were brave Men; but his hands were bound.</Q> The six excepted
<PB N="148" REF="1680"/>
by him were Colonel <HI>Morrice,</HI> and five more whose Names he found to have been amongst those who were in the Party that had destroyed <HI>Rainsborough;</HI> which was an Enterprise no brave Enemy would have revenged in that manner: nor did <HI>Lambert</HI> desire it, but <HI>Cromwell</HI> had enjoyn'd it him: all the rest he <Q>“was content to release, that they might return to their Houses, and apply themselves to the Parliament for their Compositions, towards which he would do them all the good” Offices he could.</Q> They from within acknowledged <Q>“his civility in that particular, and would be glad to embrace it, but they would ne∣ver be guilty of so base a thing, as to deliver up any of their Compa∣nions;”</Q> <MILESTONE N="10"/> and therefore they desired <Q>“they might have six days allow'd them, that those six might do the best they could to deliver themselves;” in which it should be lawful for the rest to assist them;</Q> to which <HI>Lam∣bert</HI> generously consented, <Q>“so that the rest would Surrender at the” end of that time;</Q> which was agreed to. Upon the first day the Gar∣rison appear'd twice or thrice, as if they were resolv'd to make a Sally, but retired every time without Charging; but the second day they made a very strong and brisk Sally upon another place than where they had appear'd the day before, and beat the Enemy from their Post, with the loss of Men on both sides; and though the Party of the Castle was beaten <MILESTONE N="20"/> back, two of the six (whereof <HI>Morrice</HI> was one) made their escape, the other four being forced to retire with the rest. And all was quiet for two whole days; but, in the beginning of the night of the fourth day, they made another attempt so prosperously, that two of the other four likewise escaped: and the next day they made great shews of joy, and sent <HI>Lambert</HI> word, <Q>“”that their six Friends were gone</Q> (though there were two still remaining) <Q>“and therefore they would be ready the next” day to Surrender.</Q></P>
<P>THE other two thought it to no purpose to make another attempt, but devised another way to secure themselves, with a less dangerous <MILESTONE N="30"/> Assistance from their Friends, who had lost some of their own Lives in the two former Sallies to save theirs. The buildings of the Castle were very large and spacious, and there were great store of wast Stones from some Walls, which were fallen down. They found a convenient place, which was like to be least visited, where they walled up their two Friends in such a manner that they had Air to sustain them, and Victual enough to feed them a Month, in which time they hoped they might be able to escape. And this being done, at the hour appointed they open'd their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pontsret <HI>deli∣ver'd up to</HI> Lambert.</NOTE> Ports, and after <HI>Lambert</HI> had caused a strict inquisition to be made for those six, none of which he did believe had in truth escaped, and was <MILESTONE N="40"/> satisfied that none of them were amongst those who were come out, he receiv'd the rest very civilly, and observ'd his promise made to them very punctually, and did not seem sorry that the six gallant Men (as he called them) were escaped.</P>
<P>AND now they heard, which very much reliev'd their broken Spi∣rits, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> had made an escape out of the Castle of <HI>Nottingham;</HI> who shortly after transported himself beyond the Seas. <HI>Lambert</HI> presently took care so to dismantle the Castle, that there should be no more use of it for a Garrison, leaving the vast ruins still standing; and then drew off all his Troops to new Quarters; so that, <MILESTONE N="50"/> within ten days after the Surrender, the two who were left walled up, threw down their inclosure, and securely provided for themselves. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Digby</HI> liv'd many years after the King's Return, and was often with
<PB N="149" REF="1690"/>
his Majesty. Poor <HI>Morrice</HI> was afterwards taken in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and happen'd to be put to death in the same place where he had committed a fault against the King, and where he first perform'd a great Service to the Parliament.</P>
<P>IN this desperate condition, that is before described, stood the King's <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Condition of the Prince and the Duke of</HI> York <HI>at the</HI> Hague, <HI>and the fa∣ctions among their Fol∣lowers.</HI></NOTE> Affairs when the Prince was at the <HI>Hague,</HI> his Fleet already mutinying for Pay, his own Family factious and in necessity, and that of his Bro∣ther the Duke of <HI>York</HI> full of Intrigues, and Designs, between the rest∣less unquiet spirit of <HI>Bamfield,</HI> and the ambitious and as unquiet hu∣mour of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley.</HI> The Council, which was not numerous (for <MILESTONE N="10"/> the Prince had not Authority to add any to those who were his Father's Counsellors) wanted not unity in it self, so much as submission and respect from others, which had been lost to those who were in the Fleet, and the prejudice to those still remain'd, and so abated much of the re∣verence which most Men were willing to pay to the two who came last. And the great animosity which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had against the Lord <HI>Cole∣pepper</HI> infinitely disturbed the Counsels, and perplexed the Lord <HI>Cot∣tington,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had credit enough with the other two. But <HI>Colepepper</HI> had some passions and infirmities, which no Friends could restrain; and though Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was very <MILESTONE N="20"/> well inclined to the Chancellor, and would in many things be advised by him, yet his prejudice to <HI>Colepepper</HI> was so rooted in him, and that prejudice so industriously cultivated by <HI>Herbert</HI> the Atturney General, who had the absolute Ascendent over that Prince, and who did perfectly hate all the world that would not be govern'd by him, that every meet∣ing in Council was full of bitterness and sharpness between them.</P>
<P>ONE day the Council met (as it used to do when they did not attend the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> at his lodgings) at the Lord Treasurer's lodging (He and the Chancellor of the Exchequer being in one House) about giving direction for the sale of some Goods which had been taken at Sea, <MILESTONE N="30"/> for the raising of Money toward the payment of the Fleet. In such ser∣vices Merchants, and other proper Persons, were allways necessary to be trusted. <Q>Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> proposed “”that one S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Walsh</HI></Q> (a Person too well known to be trusted) <Q>“”might be employed in that Affair: it was to sell a Ship of Sugar.</Q> No Man who was present would ever have consented that he should have been employed; but the Lord <HI>Cole∣pepper</HI> spoke against him with some warmth, so that it might be thought to reflect a little upon Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who had proposed him. Upon which, He asking <Q>“what exceptions there were to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Walsh,</HI> why he might not be fit for it, <HI>Colepepper</HI> Answer'd with some quickness,” <MILESTONE N="40"/> that he was a known cheat;</Q> which, though notoriously true, the Prince seem'd to take very ill; <Q>and said, “he was His Friend, and a Gentleman; and if he should come to hear of what had been said, he knew not how” the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> could avoid Fighting with him.</Q> <HI>Colepepper,</HI> whose Courage no Man doubted, presently replied, <Q>“that he would not” Fight with <HI>Walsh,</HI> but he would Fight with his Highness;</Q> to which the Prince Answer'd very quietly, <Q>“”that it was well;</Q> and the Council rose in great perplexity.</P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Rupert</HI> went out of the House, and the Chancellor led the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> into the Garden, hoping that he should so far have <MILESTONE N="50"/> prevailed with him, as to have made him sensible of the excess he had committed, and to have perswaded him presently to repair to the Prince, and to ask his Pardon, that no more notice might have been taken of it.
<PB N="150" REF="1700"/>
But he was yet too warm to conceive he had committed any fault, but seem'd to think only of making good what he had so imprudently said. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> quickly inform'd his Confident the Atturney General of all that had passed; who was the unfittest Man living to be trusted with such a secret, having allways about him store of Oyl to throw upon such Fire. He soon found means to make it known to the Prince, who pre∣sently sent for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be inform'd of the whole matter; and when he understood it, was exceedingly troubled, and required him <Q>“to let <HI>Colepepper</HI> know, that he ought to make a” submission to Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI></Q> without which worse would fall out. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>HE went first to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> that he might pacify him till he could convince the other of his fault; and he so far prevailed with his Highness, who would have been more cholerick if he had had less Right of his side, that he was willing to receive a Submission; and promised <Q>“”that the other should receive no affront in the mean time.</Q> But he found more difficulty on the other side, the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> continu∣ing still in rage, thought the provocation was so great, that he ought to be excused for the Reply, and that the Prince ought to acknowledge the one as well as He the other. But after some days recollection, find∣ing no body with whom he conversed of his mind, and understanding <MILESTONE N="20"/> how much the Prince was displeased, and that he expected he should ask Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> pardon, and withal reflecting upon the place he was in, where he could expect no security from his Quality and Function, he resolv'd to do what he ought to have done at first; and so he went with the Chancellor to Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s lodging; where he behaved him∣self very well; and the Prince receiv'd him with all the Grace could be expected; so that so ill a business seem'd to be as well concluded as the nature of it would admit. But the worst was to come: the Atturney General had done all he could to disswade that Prince from accepting so small, and so private a satisfaction; but, not prevailing, he inflamed <MILESTONE N="30"/> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Walsh,</HI> who had been inform'd of all that had passed at the Council concerning himself, to take his own revenge; in which many Men thought, that he was assured Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> would not be offended. And the next Morning after his Highness had receiv'd satisfaction, as the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> was walking to the Council without a Sword, <HI>Walsh,</HI> coming to him, seem'd quietly to expostulate with him, for having mention'd him so unkindly. <Q>To the which the other Answer'd, “that he would give him satisfaction in any way he would require; though he ought not to be called in question for any thing he had said in that” place.</Q> On a suddain, whilst they were in this calm discourse, <HI>Walsh</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> struck him with all his force one blow in the face with his fist; and then stepped back, and drew his Sword; but seeing the other had none, walked away; and the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> with his nose and face all bloody, went back to his Chamber, from whence he could not go abroad in many days by the effect and disfiguring of the blow. This outrage was com∣mitted about ten of the Clock in the Morning in the sight of the Town; which troubled the Prince exceedingly; who immediately sent to the States to demand Justice; and they, according to their method and slow proceedings in matters which they do not take to heart, caused <HI>Walsh</HI> to be summon'd, and after so many days, for want of appearance, he <MILESTONE N="50"/> was by the sound of a Bell publickly banished from the <HI>Hague;</HI> and so he made his residence in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> or what other place he pleased. And this was the reparation the States gave the Prince for so Ruffianly
<PB N="151" REF="1710"/>
a transgression; and both the beginning and the end of this unhappy bu∣siness exposed the Prince himself, as well as his Council, to more disad∣vantage, and less reverence, than ought to have been paid to either.</P>
<P>THE improvidence that had been used in the Fleet, besides its un∣activity, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The ill condi∣tion of the Prince's Flees in</HI> Holland</NOTE> by the dismissing so many great Prizes, was now too apparent, when there was neither Money to pay the Seamen, who were not modest in requiring it, nor to new Victual the Ships, which was as important; since it was easy to be foreseen, that they could not remain long in the Station where they were for the present, and the extreme licence which all Men took to censure and reproach that improvidence, disturbed all <MILESTONE N="10"/> Counsels, and made Conversation it self very uneasy. Nor was it possi∣ble to suppress that Licence; every Man believing that his particular necessities, with which all Men abounded, might easily have been re∣liev'd, and provided for, if it had not been for that ill husbandry; which they therefore called treachery and corruption. It cannot be denied but there was so great a treasure taken, which turn'd to no account, and so much more might have been taken, if the several Ships had been applied to that end, that a full provision might have been made, both for the support of the Fleet, and supply of the Prince, and of all who depended upon him for a good time, if the same had been well managed, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> could have been deposited in some secure place, till all might have been sold at good Markets. And no body was satisfied with the Reasons which were given for the discharging, and dismissing so many Ships to gratify the City of <HI>London,</HI> and the Presbyterian Party throughout the Kingdom. For, besides that the value of what was so given away and lost, was generally believ'd to be worth more than all they would have done, if they had been able, those Bounties were not the natural mo∣tives which were to be applied to that People; whose Affections had been long dead, and could be revived by nothing but their sharp suf∣ferings, and their insupportable losses; the obstruction and destruction <MILESTONE N="30"/> of their Trade, and the seising upon their Estates, being, at that time, thought by many the most proper application to the City of <HI>London,</HI> and the best Arguments to make them in love with Peace, and to extort it from them in whose power it was to give it. And if the Fleet had applied it self to that, and visited all those Maritime parts which were in Counties well affected, and where some places had declared for the King (as <HI>Scarborough</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> did) if it had not been possible to have set the King at liberty in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> or to have reliev'd <HI>Colchesler,</HI> (both which many Men believ'd, how unskilfully soever, to be practi∣cable) it would have spent the time much more advantageously and <MILESTONE N="40"/> honourably than it did.</P>
<P>BUT let the ill consequence be never so great, if it had proceeded from any corruption, it would probably have been discover'd by the examination and inquisition that was made; and therefore it may be well concluded that there was none. And the truth is, the Queen was so fully possess'd of the purpose, and the power of the <HI>Scots</HI> to do the King's business, before the Insurrections in the several parts in <HI>England,</HI> and the revolt of the Fleet appear'd, that she did not enough weigh the good use that might have been made of those when they did happen, but kept her mind then so fixed upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> as the sole foundation <MILESTONE N="50"/> of the King's hopes, that she looked upon the benefit of the Fleet's re∣turning to their Allegiance, only as an opportunity offer'd by Providence to transport the Prince with security thither. And her Instructions to
<PB N="152" REF="1720"/>
those she trusted about the Prince, were so positive, <Q>“that they should not give consent to any thing that might divert or delay that Expedi∣tion,” that, if the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> had been arriv'd when the Prince came to the Fleet, it would have been immediately engaged to have transported the Prince into <HI>Scotland,</HI> what other conveniencies soever, preferable to that, had offer'd themselves.</Q> And the very next day after that Lord's coming to the Prince in the <HI>Downs,</HI> his injunctions and behaviour were so imperious for the Prince's present departure, that nothing but a direct Mutiny among the Seamen prevented it. His High∣ness's own Ship was under Sail for <HI>Holland,</HI> that he might from thence <MILESTONE N="10"/> have prosecuted his other Voyage: nor would he at that time have taken <HI>Holland</HI> in his way, if there had been any quantity of Provision in the Fleet for such a Peregrination. This Expedition for <HI>Scotland</HI> was the more grievous to all Men, because it was evident that the Prince himself was much more inclined to have pursued other occasions which were offer'd, and only resign'd himself implicitly to the pleasure of his Mother.</P>
<P>THE present ill condition of the Fleet, and the unsteady humour of the Common Seamen was the more notorious, and unseasonable, by the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s coming with another Fleet from the Parliament <MILESTONE N="20"/> upon the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> within few days after the Prince came to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Warwick <HI>with his Fleet comes upon the Coast of</HI> Hol∣land.</NOTE> the <HI>Hague,</HI> and Anchoring within view of the King's Fleet. And it is probable he would have made some hostile attempt upon it, well know∣ing that many Officers and Seamen were on Shore, if the States had not, in the very Instant, sent some of their Ships of War to preserve the Peace in Their Port. However, according to the insolence of his Ma∣sters, and of most of those imployed by them, the Earl sent a Summons of a strange Nature to the King's Ships, in which he took notice, <Q>“that a Fleet of Ships, which were part of the Navy Royal of the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> was then riding at Anchor off <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> and bearing <MILESTONE N="30"/> a Standard: That he did therefore, by the Parliament's Authority, by which he was constituted Lord High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> require the Admiral, or Commander in chief of that Fleet, to take down the Standard; and the Captains, and Mariners belonging to the Ships, to render themselves and the Ships to Him, as High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> and for the use of the King and Parliament: And he did, by the like” Authority, offer an indemnity to all those who should submit to him.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER which Summons, though receiv'd by the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> who remain'd on Board the Fleet in the Command of Vice-Admiral, with that indignation that was due to it, and though it made no im∣pression <MILESTONE N="40"/> upon the Officers, nor visibly, at that time, upon the Common Men, yet, during the time the Earl continued in so near a Neighbour∣hood, he did find means by private Insinuations, and by sending many of his Seamen on Shore at <HI>Helvoet Sluce</HI> (where they enter'd into con∣versation with their old Companions) so to work upon and corrupt many of the Seamen, that it afterwards appear'd many were debauched; some whereof went on Board his Ships, others stayed to do more mis∣chief. But that ill Neighbourhood continued not long; for the Season of the Year, and the Winds which usually rage on that Coast in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> removed him from that Station, and carried him <MILESTONE N="50"/> back to the <HI>Downs</HI> to attend new Orders.</P>
<P>ALL these disturbances were attended with a worse, which fell out at the same time, and that was the sickness of the Prince; who, after
<PB N="153" REF="1730"/>
some days indisposition, appear'd to have the small Pox; which allmost <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince of</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>for the small <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI></NOTE> distracted all who were about him, who knew how much depended upon his precious Life: And therefore the consternation was very uni∣versal whilst that was thought in danger. But, by the goodness and mercy of God, he recover'd in few days the peril of that distemper; and, within a Month, was restored to so perfect Health, that he was able to take an account himself of his melancholick and perplex'd Affairs.</P>
<P>THERE were two points which were chiefly to be consider'd, and provided for by the Prince; neither of which would bear delay for the <MILESTONE N="10"/> consultation, and resolution; the first, how to make provision to pay, and victual the Fleet, and to compose the mutinous Spirits of the Sea∣men; who paid no reverence to their Officers, insomuch as, in the short stay which the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> had made before <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> as hath been said, many of the Seamen had gone over to him, and the <HI>Constant Warwick,</HI> a Frigat of the best Account, had either voluntarily left the Prince's Fleet, or suffer'd it self willingly to be taken, and car∣ried away with the rest into <HI>England.</HI> The other was, what he should do with the Fleet, when it was both payed and victualled.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the first, there were some Ships brought in with the Fleet, <MILESTONE N="20"/> laden with several Merchandize of value, that, if they could be sold to the true worth, would amount to a Sum sufficient to pay the Seamen their Wages, and to put in Provisions enough to serve four Months; and there were many Merchants from <HI>London,</HI> who were desirous to buy their own Goods, which had been taken from them; and others had Commissions from thence to buy the rest. But then they all knew, that they could not be carried to any other Market, but must be sold in the place where they were; and therefore they were resolv'd to have very good Pennyworths. And there were many Debts claim'd, which the Prince had promised, whilst he was in the River, should be paid out of <MILESTONE N="30"/> the first Money that should be raised upon the sale of such and such Ships: particularly, the Prince believ'd that the Countess of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> who had committed faults enough to the King and Queen, had pawn'd her Necklace of Pearls for fifteen hundred pounds, which she had to∣tally disbursed in supplying Officers, and making other Provisions for the expedition of the Earl of <HI>Holland;</HI> which Sum of fifteen hundred pounds the Prince had promised the Lord <HI>Peircy</HI> her Brother, who was a very importunate Sollicitor, should be paid upon the Sale of a Ship that was laden with Sugar, and was then conceiv'd to be worth above six or seven thousand pounds. Others had the like Engagements upon other <MILESTONE N="40"/> Ships: so that when Money was to be raised upon the sale of Merchan∣dize, they who had such Engagements, would be themselves entrusted, or nominate those who should be, to make the bargain with Purchasers, to the end that they might be sure to receive what they claim'd, out of the first Monies that should be raised. By this means, double the value was deliver'd, to satisfy a debt that was not above the half.</P>
<P>BUT that which was worse than all this, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> adver∣tised the Prince, that some Questions had been started in the States, <Q>“”what they should do, if the Parliament of <HI>England</HI></Q> (which had now a very dreadful name) <Q>“should send over to them to demand the resti∣tution <MILESTONE N="50"/> of those Merchants Goods, which had been unjustly taken in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and had been brought into their Ports, and were offer'd to sale there, against the obligation of
<PB N="154" REF="1740"/>
that Amity which had been observ'd between the two Nations, during the late War? what Answer they should be able to make, or how they could refuse to permit the owners of those Goods to make their Ar¦rests, and to sue in their Admiralty for the same? which first proces<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would stop the present Sale of whatever others pretended a Title to” till the right should be determin'd.</Q> The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> said, <Q>“that” such Questions used not to be started there without design;</Q> and there¦fore advised the Prince <Q>“to lose no time in making compleat Sales of al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that was to be sold; to the end that they who were engaged in the” Purchase, might likewise be engaged in the defence of it.</Q> Upon this Ground, as well as the others which have been mention'd, hasty Bar∣gains were made with all who desired to buy, and who would not buy except they were sure to be good Gainers by all the Bargains which they made. Nor could this be prevented by the caution or wisdom of any who were upon the place, with no more Authority than they had. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long,</HI> who was Secretary to the Prince, had been possessed of the Office of receiving and paying all Monies, whilst the Prince was in the Fleet, and so could not well be removed from it when he came into <HI>Holland:</HI> though he was thought to love Money too well, yet no body who lov'd it less, would at that time have submitted to the imployment, which exposed him to the importunity and insolence of all necessitous Persons, when he could satisfy none; yet he liked it well with all its prejudice, and disadvantage.</P>
<P>ASSOON as the Money was raised, it was sent to the Fleet to pay the Seamen; and the Prince made a Journey to the Fleet to see, and keep up the Spirits of the Seamen, who were very mutinous, not with∣out the infusions of some who did not desire they should be too well pleased with their Officers. The Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> stayed on board purely out of Duty to the King, though he liked neither the place he had, nor the People over whom he was to Command, who had yet more respect <MILESTONE N="30"/> for Him than for any Body else. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Batten</HI> likewise remain'd with them, not knowing well how to refuse it, though he had too much reason to be weary of his Province, the Seamen having contracted an implacable jealousy and malice against him, more than they were na∣turally inclined to. And the truth is, though there was not any evi∣dence that he had any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul practices, he had an impatient desire to make his Peace, and to live in his own Country, as afterwards he did with the leave of the King; against whom he never after took imployment.</P>
<P>THE other point to be resolv'd was yet more difficult, <Q>“what should” be done with the Fleet, and who should Command it?</Q> and though <MILESTONE N="40"/> the advertisement the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had given his Royal Highness, of the Question started in the States, concern'd only the Merchants Ships, which were made prize, yet it was very easy to discern the Lo∣gick of that Question would extend as well, and be applied to those of the Royal Navy, as to Merchants Ships. And it was evident enough, that the united Provinces would not take upon them to determine whe∣ther they were in truth the Ships of the King, or of the Parliament. And it was only the differences which were yet kept up in the Houses, which kept them from being united in that demand. So that the Prince knew that nothing was more necessary than that they should be gone <MILESTONE N="50"/> out of the Ports of those Provinces, and that the States wished it ex∣ceedingly.</P>
<P>WHILST <HI>Bamfield</HI> was about the Person of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> he
<PB N="155" REF="1750"/>
had infused into him a marvellous desire to be possessed of the Govern∣ment of the Fleet: but the Duke was convinced with much ado, that it was neither safe for his Highness, nor for his Father's Service, that he should be embarked in it: and <HI>Bamfield,</HI> by an especial Command from the King, who had discover'd more of his foul practices than could be known to the Prince, was not suffer'd to come any more near the Person of the Duke. So he return'd into <HI>England;</HI> wherehe was never called in question for stealing the Duke away. From this time the Duke, who was not yet above fifteen years of age, was so far from desiring to be with the Fleet, that, when there was once a Proposition, upon oc∣casion <MILESTONE N="10"/> of a suddain mutiny amongst the Seamen, <Q>“that he should go to” <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> to appear amongst them, who professed great duty to his Highness, he was so offended at it that he would not hear of it;</Q> and he had still some Servant about him who took pains to perswade him, <Q>“that the Council had inclined the Prince to that designation, out of ill will to his Highness, and that the Ships might deliver him up to” the Parliament. So unpleasant, and uncomfortable a Province had those Persons, who, being of the King's Council, serv'd both with great fidelity;</Q> every body who was unsatisfied (and no body was satisfied) aspersing them, or some of them (for their prejudice was not equal to <MILESTONE N="20"/> them all) in such a manner as touched the honour of the rest, and most reflected upon the King's own Honour, and Service.</P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Rupert</HI> had a long desire to have that Command of the Fleet put into his hands; and that desire, though carried with all se∣crecy, had been the cause of so many Intrigues, either to inflame the Seamen, or to cherish their froward inclinations, and encrease the pre∣judice they had to <HI>Batten.</HI> The Atturney mention'd this to the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer, shortly after his coming to the <HI>Hague,</HI> as a thing, he thought, that Prince might be induced to accept out of his Zeal to the King's Service, if he were invited to it; and thereupon was <MILESTONE N="30"/> willing to debate, to what Person the Government of the Fleet could be committed, when it should set Sail from that Port, and whither it should go. The Chancellor made no other Answer to him, than <Q>“that it was like to be a charge of much danger and hazard; that he must not believe that any body would propose the undertaking it to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> or that the Prince would command him to undertake it; and that he thought it necessary, that it should be first resolv'd, what the Fleet should do, and whither it should go, before a Commander should” be appointed over it.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had waited so many Months at <HI>Pa∣ris</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of the Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>and the Lord</HI> Inch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quin <HI>in</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> for the Performance of those gaudy promises which the Cardinal had made, after he saw in what manner the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> himself was treated by him, and that he would not suffer the least assistance to be applied to the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> in a conjuncture when very little would probably have done the work, upon the revolt of the Fleet, upon so powerful Insurrections in <HI>England,</HI> and possessing so many places of importance on the King's behalf, and when the whole Kingdom of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> seem'd so united for his Majesties Service, and an Army of thirty thousand Men were said to be even ready to march; I say, after he dis∣cern'd that the Cardinal was so far from giving any countenance, or <MILESTONE N="50"/> warmth to their blooming hopes, that he left nothing undone towards the destroying them, but the imprisoning the Prince; he concluded that it was in vain for him to expect any relief for <HI>Ireland.</HI> And there∣fore
<PB N="156" REF="1760"/>
he resolv'd, though he had neither Men, nor Money, nor Armes, nor Ammunition, all which had been very liberally promised to trans∣port with him, he would yet transport his own Person, to what evi∣dent danger soever he was to expose it. Upon the full assurance the Car∣dinal had given him of very substantial aid, he had assured the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> <Q>“that he would be present with him with notable supply of Money, Armes, and Ammunition, and good Officers, and some com∣mon” Men</Q> (which were all in readiness, if the Money had been paid to entertain them) and had likewise sent to many, who had formerly serv'd the King, and liv'd now quietly in the Enemies Quarters, upon <MILESTONE N="10"/> the Articles which had been formerly granted the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <Q>“”that they should expect his speedy arrival.</Q></P>
<P>AND though he had, from time to time, sent advertisements of the delays and obstructions he met with in the <HI>French</HI> Court, so that he did allmost despair of any Assistance from it, yet the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> had advanced too far to retire; and the Lord <HI>Lisle,</HI> who had been suffi∣ciently provoked, and contemned by him, was gone into <HI>England</HI> with full malice, and such information (which was not hard for him to be furnished with) as would put <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the Army into such fury, that his Friends in the Parliament, who had hitherto sustain'd his cre∣dit, <MILESTONE N="20"/> would be very hardly able to support him longer. So that, as he was to expect a storm from thence, so he had a very sharp War to main∣tain against the <HI>Irish,</HI> led and commanded by the Pope's Nuntio; which War had been allways carried on in <HI>Munster</HI> with wonderful animosity, and with some circumstances of bloodiness, especially against Priests, and others of the Roman Clergy, that it was very hard to hope that those People would live well together. And indeed the <HI>Irish</HI> were near rooted out of the Province of <HI>Munster,</HI> though they were powerful enough, and strong in all the other Provinces. Hereupon the Lord <HI>In∣chiquin,</HI> with all possible earnestness, writ to the Lord of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <Q>“that <MILESTONE N="30"/> though without any other assistance, he would transport his own Per∣son:” by whose countenance and authority he presumed the <HI>Irish</HI> might be divided, and brought to reason;</Q> and desired him, <Q>“in the mean time, to send to such of the <HI>Irish</HI> as had dependence upon him, and who, he knew, in their hearts did not wish well to the Nuntio, that they would secretly correspond with Him, and dispose their Friends and Depen∣dents to concur in what might advance the King's Service; to which they did not know that he was inclined, but looked upon him, as the same malicious and irreconcilable Enemy to them, as he had allways” appear'd to be to their Religion, more than to their Persons.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>FROM the time that the <HI>Irish</HI> enter'd into that bloody, and foolish <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the Affairs of the</HI> Irish <HI>about this time.</HI></NOTE> Rebellion, they had very different Affections, Intentions, and Designs, which were every day improved in the carrying on the War. That part of them which inhabited the <HI>Pale,</HI> so called from a circuit of ground contain'd in it, was originally of <HI>English</HI> Extraction, since the first Plan∣tation by the <HI>English</HI> many Ages past. And though they were dege∣nerated into the manners and barbarous Customs of the <HI>Irish,</HI> and were as stupidly transported with the highest superstition of the Romish Re∣ligion, yet they had allways steadily adher'd to the Crown, and per∣form'd the duty of good Subjects during all those Rebellions which the <MILESTONE N="50"/> whole Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was seldom without. And of that temper most of the Province of <HI>Lemster</HI> was: <HI>Munster</HI> was the most planted with <HI>English</HI> of all the Provinces of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and though there
<PB N="157" REF="1770"/>
were many Noble Men of that Province who were of the oldest <HI>Irish</HI> extractions, and of those Families which had been Kings of <HI>Munster,</HI> yet many of them had intermarried with the best <HI>English</HI> Families, and so were better bred, and more civilized than the rest of the old <HI>Irish,</HI> and liv'd regularly in obedience to the Government, and by connivance enjoyed the exercise of their Religion, in which they were very zealous, with freedom and liberty enough.</P>
<P>THE Seat of the old <HI>Irish,</HI> who retained the Rites, Customs, Man∣ners, and Ignorance of their Ancestors, without any kind of reforma∣tion in either, was the Province of <HI>Ulster;</HI> not the better cultivated by <MILESTONE N="10"/> the neighbourhood of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who were planted upon them in great Numbers, with circumstances of great Rigour. Here the Rebellion was first contrived, cherished, and enter'd upon with that horrid Barbarity, by the <HI>O Neils,</HI> the <HI>Macguyres,</HI> and the <HI>Macmahoons;</HI> and though it quickly spread it self, and was entertain'd in the other Provinces (many Persons of Honour and Quality engaging themselves by degrees in it for their own security, as they pretended, to preserve themselves from the undistinguishing severity of the Lords Justices, who denounced the War against all <HI>Irish</HI> equally, if not against all Roman Catholicks; which kind of mixture and confusion was carefully declined in all the Orders <MILESTONE N="20"/> and directions sent to them out of <HI>England,</HI> but so unskilfully pursued by the Justices, and Council there, that as they found themselves with∣out any imployment or trust, to which they had chearfully offer'd their Service, they concluded, that the <HI>English Irish</HI> were as much in the jea∣lousy of the State as the other, and so resolv'd to prevent the danger by as unwarrantable Courses as the rest had done) yet, I say, they were no sooner enter'd into the War, which was so generally embraced, but there appear'd a very great difference in the temper and purposes of those who prosecuted it. They of the more moderate Party, and whose main end was to obtain liberty for the exercise of their Religion, with∣out <MILESTONE N="30"/> any thought of declining their subjection to the King, or of invading his Prerogative, put themselves under the Command of General <HI>Preston:</HI> the other, of the fiercer and more savage Party, and who never meant to return to their obedience of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and looked upon all the Estates which had ever been in the possession of any of their An∣cestors, though forfeited by their Treason and Rebellion, as justly due to them, and ravished from them by the Tyranny of the Crown, marched under the conduct of <HI>Owen Roe O Neile;</HI> both Generals of the <HI>Irish</HI> Na∣tion; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chara∣cters of</HI> Pre∣ston <HI>and</HI> O Neile <HI>their chief Generals.</HI></NOTE> the one descended of <HI>English</HI> extraction through many descents; the other purely <HI>Irish,</HI> and of the Family of <HI>Tyrone;</HI> both bred in the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Wars of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and both eminent Commanders there, and of per∣petual jealousy of each other: the one of the more frank and open Na∣ture; the other darker, less polite, and the wiser Man; but both of them then in the head of more numerous Armies apart, than all the King's power could bring into the Field against either of them.</P>
<P>THIS disparity in the temper and humour of those People, first dis∣posed those of the most moderate to desire a Peace shortly after the Re∣bellion was begun, and produced the Cessation that was first enter'd into, and the Peace, which did not soon enough ensue upon it; and which, upon the matter, did provide only for the exercise of the Roman Ca∣tholick <MILESTONE N="50"/> Religion; but did that in so immoderate and extravagant a manner, as made it obnoxious to all the Protestants of the King's Do∣minions.</P>

OWEN <HI>Roe O Neile</HI> refused to submit to the Conditions, and Arti∣cles of that Peace, though transacted and confirm'd by their Catholick Council at <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> which was the Representative the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation had chosen for the conduct of all the Counsels for Peace and War, and to which they all avowed, and had hitherto paid an entire obedience. The Pope's Nuntio, who about that time came from <HI>Rome,</HI> and trans∣ported himself into that Kingdom, applied himself to <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> and took that Party into his Protection; and so wrought upon their Clergy, generally, that he broke that Peace, and prosecuted those who had made it, with those circumstances which have been before remem∣ber'd, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and which necessitated the Lord Lieutenant to quit the King∣dom, and to leave the City of <HI>Dublin</HI> in the hands of the Parliament; the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> having likewise refused to consent, and submit to that Peace, and continued to make the War sharply and successfully against the <HI>Irish</HI> in the Province of <HI>Munster;</HI> whereof he was President. But the Nuntio was no sooner invested in the supreme Command of that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Pope's Nuntio Com∣mands the</HI> Irish.</NOTE> Nation both by Sea and Land, as over a People subject to the Pope, and of a Dominion belonging to Him, than, being a Man of a fantastical humour, and of an imperious and proud Nature, he behaved himself so insolently towards all (and having brought no Assistance to them but <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Pope's Bulls, endeavour'd by new exactions to enrich himself) that even the Men of <HI>Ulster</HI> were weary of him; and they, who had been the Instruments of the former Peace, were not wanting to foment those jealousies, and discontents, which had produced that application to the Queen and Prince at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Germains,</HI> and the resolution of sending the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> thither again, both which have been related before. And the Marquis now having given the Lord <HI>Muskerry</HI> (who had Mar∣ried his Sister, and was the most powerful Person, and of the greatest Interest in <HI>Munster</HI> of all the <HI>Irish)</HI> and other of his Friends notice that the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> would serve the King, and therefore required them <MILESTONE N="30"/> to hold secret correspondence with him, and to concur with him in what he should desire for the advancement of his Service, they found means to hold such intercourse with him, that, before the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> arriv'd there, against all the opposition the Nuntio could make, a Cessation of Armes was concluded between the Confederate Catholicks and the Lord <HI>Inchiquin;</HI> and the Nuntio was driven into <HI>Waterford;</HI> and, upon the matter, Besieged there by the Catholick <HI>Irish;</HI> and the Marquis arriving at the same time at <HI>Kingsale,</HI> and being receiv'd by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>arrives at</HI> Kingsale, <HI>and the Pope's Nuntio leaves</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> with all imaginable duty as the King's Lieutenant, the forlorne and contemned Nuntio found it necessary to transport him∣self <MILESTONE N="40"/> into <HI>Italy,</HI> leaving the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> under an Excommuni∣cation, and interdict, as an Apostate Nation; and all the Province of <HI>Munster</HI> (in which there are many excellent Ports) became immediately and entirely under the King's obedience. All which being well known to the Prince, and the Council, it was easily concluded, <Q>“that it was” the best, if not the only place, the Fleet could repair to;</Q> though the danger in conducting it thither was visible enough; and therefore they were glad that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had made that advance towards the Com∣mand of it, and well satisfied with the wariness of the Answer the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer gave to the Atturney <HI>Herbert.</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THERE was in truth no body in view to whom the Charge of the Fleet could be committed but Prince <HI>Rupert:</HI> for it was well known that the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> besides his being without much experience
<PB N="159" REF="1790"/>
of the Sea, was weary of it, and would by no means continue there; and the Seamen were too much broke loose from all kind of Order, to be reduced by a Commander of an Ordinary Rank. It was as true, that Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> at that time, was generally very ungracious in <HI>England,</HI> having the misfortune not to be much belov'd by the King's Party, and hated by the Parliament. This was an exception that was foreseen: there was no other choice of a place to which the Fleet must be carried, but <HI>Munster;</HI> and the passage thither could not but be full of danger, in respect that the Parliament was without question Master of the Sea (although the Island of <HI>Silly</HI> being then under the King's Authority, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> being the Governour thereof, made that passage some∣thing the more secure) therefore this purpose was to be concealed as the last secret; there being great danger that the Seamen would rather carry all the Ships back again to the Parliament, than into <HI>Ireland;</HI> against which People they had made a War at Sea with circumstances very barbarous; for they had seldom given any Quarter, but the <HI>Irish,</HI> as well Merchants and Passengers, as Mariners, which fell into their Hands, as hath been said before, were bound back to back and thrown into the Sea; so that they could have no inclination to go into a Coun∣try whose People had been handled so cruelly by them. <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>HERE again appear'd another objection against the Person of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who would never endure to be subject to the Command of the Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom: and yet it seem'd most reasonable that the Ships, whilst they stayed there, might be imployed towards the reducing of the other parts, which were in Rebellion: Besides that there was cause to fear, that the Prince would not live with that Amity towards the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> as was necessary for the publick Ser∣vice. Notwithstanding all this, when the little Stratagem of having Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> desired to take the Command of the Fleet upon him did not succeed, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> himself made the Proposition to the Prince <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Ru∣pert <HI>under∣takes the Com∣mand of the Prince's Fleet.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"/> to take the Command of it upon him, and to carry it whither his Royal Highness would be pleased to direct. And then, the whole matter be∣ing debated, necessity made that to be counsellable, against which very many reasonable objections might be made. So it was resolv'd that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> should be Admiral of that Fleet, and that it should Sail for <HI>Ireland.</HI> And the Charge, and Expedition appear'd to be the more hopeful by the presence of good Officers, who had long Commanded in the Royal Navy: S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Kettleby,</HI> whom the Prince made Captain of his own Ship the <HI>Antelope;</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Mennes,</HI> who had the Command of the <HI>Swallow,</HI> a Ship of which he had been Captain many years be∣fore; <MILESTONE N="40"/> and Colonel <HI>Richard Fielding,</HI> who was made Captain of the <HI>Con∣stant Reformation;</HI> all worthy and faithful Men to the King's Service, of long experience in the Service at Sea, and well known and lov'd by the Seamen. With these Officers, and some other Gentlemen, who were willing to spend their time in that Service, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> went to <HI>Hel∣voet Sluce,</HI> where the Ships lay, and seem'd to be receiv'd by the Fleet with great joy. They all bestirr'd themselves in their several places to get the Ships ready for Sea, and all those Provisions which were neces∣sary, in making whereof there had not diligence enough been used.</P>
<P>WHEN they took a strict Survey of the Ships, the Carpenters were <MILESTONE N="50"/> all of opinion, <Q>“that the <HI>Convertine,</HI> a Ship of the second Rank, that carried seventy Guns, was too old and decayed to be now set out in a Winter Voyage, and in so rough Seas, and that when a great deal of
<PB N="160" REF="1800"/>
Money should be laid out to mend her, she would not be serviceable” or safe.</Q> And it did appear, that when the Officers of the Navy had fitted her out at the beginning of the Summer, they had declared, <Q>“that, when she came in again, she would not be fit for more use, but must” be layed upon the Stocks.</Q> Whereupon the Ship was brought into <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> upon the next Spring Tyde, and examined by the best <HI>Dutch</HI> Carpenters and Surveyors; and all being of the same mind, in∣formation was sent by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> to the Prince of the whole, who thereupon gave direction for the Sale of the Ordnance, and whatsoever else would yield Money: all which was applied to the Victualling, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> setting out the rest, without which no means could have been found to have done it; so much ill husbandry had been used, and so much di∣rect cheating in the managing all the Money that had been raised upon the Prizes.</P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Rupert</HI> remain'd all the time at <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> till all was ready to set Sail, and had, with notable Vigour and Success, suppressed two or three mutinies, in one of which he had been compelled to throw two or three Seamen over board by the strength of his own Armes. All subordinate Officers were appointed, Commissioners for the Sale of all Prize Goods, and Ships that should be taken, Treasurers and Pay∣masters <MILESTONE N="20"/> for issuing and paying and receiving all Monies; and an establish∣ment for the whole too regular and strict to be observ'd: and though all Persons imployed were well known, and approv'd by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and most of them nominated by himself, yet he thought it fit after to change that constitution, and by degrees brought the whole receipts, and issues under his own management, and sole Government. When all was ready he came to the <HI>Hague</HI> to take leave of the Prince, and re∣turn'd, and about the beginning of <HI>December</HI> he set Sail for <HI>Ireland,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sets Sail for</HI> Ireland <HI>in</HI> De∣cember.</NOTE> met with good Prizes in the way, and arriv'd safely at <HI>Kingsale:</HI> nor had he been long gone out of <HI>Holland,</HI> when the Prince had a shrew'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> Evidence how unsecure a long abode would have been there, by some Parliament Ships coming into that Road, and sending their Men on Shore, who at noon day burnt the <HI>Convertine</HI> within the very Town of <HI>Helvoet Sluce,</HI> nor did the States make any expostulation, or do any justice for the Affront offer'd to themselves, and their Government.</P>
<P>IN this calamitous State of Affairs there seem'd to be no hope left, but that by Treaty the King might yet be restored to such a condition, that there might be those Roots left in the Crown, from whence its former Power, and Prerogative might sprout out hereafter, and flourish. The Commissioners for the Treaty arriv'd in the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> upon the <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commis∣sioners arrive in the Isle of</HI> Wight, Sept. 15.</NOTE> fifteenth day of <HI>September,</HI> whilst <HI>Cromwell</HI> yet remain'd in his Northern Progress, and his Army divided into several parts for the finishing his Conquest; which was the reason that all they who wished ill to the Treaty, and that it might prove ineffectual, had used and interposed all the delays they could, that he might return before it begun, as they who wished it might succeed well, were as sollicitous, that it might be concluded before that time; which made them the less to insist upon many particulars both in the Propositions, and the Instructions, which they hoped might be more capable of remedies in the Treaty than be∣fore it. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THEY stayed three days in the Island before the Teaty begun, which was time little enough to prepare the House for the King's reception at <HI>Newport,</HI> and adjusting many circumstances of the Treaty. In that
<PB N="161" REF="1810"/>
time they waited several times on the King, with great shew of outward duty and respect; and though none of them durst adventure to see the King in private, they communicated freely with some of those Lords, and others, who, with the Parliament's leave, were come to attend the King during the time of the Treaty. And so they found means to ad∣vertise his Majesty of many particulars, which they thought necessary for him to know; which made different impressions upon him, as the information proceeded from Persons better or worse affected to him. And many of those who had liberty to attend, were competent Consi∣derers of the truth of what they said. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE truth is there were amongst the Commissioners many who had been carried with the violence of the stream, and would be glad of those concessions which the King would very chearfully have granted; an Act of Indemnity and Oblivion being what they were principally concern'd in. And of all the rest, who were more passionate for the Militia, and against the Church, there was no Man, except S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> who did not desire that a Peace might be established by that Treaty. For as all the other Lords desired, in their own Natures and Affections, no more than that their Transgressions might never more be called to remem∣brance; so the Lord <HI>Say</HI> himself (who was as proud of his Quality, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> of being distinguished from other Men by his Title, as any Man alive) well foresaw what would become of his Peerage, if the Treaty proved ineffectual, and the Army should make their own model of the Govern∣ment they would submit to (as undoubtedly they resolv'd shortly to do) and therefore he did all he could to work upon the King to yield to what was proposed to him, and, afterwards, upon the Parliament, to be content with what his Majesty had yielded. But the advice they all gave, of what inclinations or affections soever they were, was the same, <Q>“that his Majesty should, forthwith, and without delaying it to the ex∣piration” of the Term assign'd by the Parliament for the Treaty</Q> (which <MILESTONE N="30"/> was forty days) <Q>“yield to the full demands which were made in the” Propositions.</Q> Their only Argument was, <Q>“that, if he did not, or not do it quickly, the Army would proceed their own way; and had enough declared, that they would depose the King, change the Go∣vernment,” and settle a Republick by their own Rules and Invention.</Q> And this advertisement was as well believ'd by those of the King's own Party, as by the Commissioners themselves.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Treaty begun, the Commissioners made it known to the King, <Q>“that they could not admit that any Person should be pre∣sent in the Room where the Treaty should be in debate: that they <MILESTONE N="40"/> were Commissioners sent from the Parliament to treat with his Ma∣jesty, and with Him alone; and that they might not permit any par∣ticular and private Persons to oppose, or confer with them upon the” demands of the Parliament.</Q> So that albeit the Parliament had given leave to the several Bishops, and other Divines, and to many Lawyers of eminency to wait on his Majesty, upon his desire, that they might instruct and inform him in all difficult cases which related to Religion or the Law of the Land, they were like to be of little use to him now they were come, if they might not be present at the debate, and offer such advice to his Majesty, as upon emergent occasions he should stand <MILESTONE N="50"/> in need of, or require from them. At last they were contented, and his Majesty was obliged to be contented too, that they might stand be∣hind a Curtain, and hear all that was said, and when any such difficulty
<PB N="162" REF="1820"/>
occurr'd as would require consultation, his Majesty might retire to his Chamber, and call those to him, with whom he would advise, to attend him, and might then return again into the Room for the Treaty, and declare his own Resolution. This was the unequal and unreasonable preliminary and condition, to which the King was compelled to submit before the Treaty could begin.</P>
<P>THEY who had not seen the King in a Years time (for it was little less from the time that he had left <HI>Hampton</HI> Court) found his Coun∣tenance extremely alter'd. From the time that his own Servants had been taken from him, he would never suffer his hair to be cut, nor <MILESTONE N="10"/> cared to have any new Cloaths; so that his aspect and appearance was very different from what it had used to be: otherwise, his health was good, and he was much more chearful in his discourses towards all Men than could have been imagined, after such mortification of all kinds. He was not at all dejected in his Spirits, but carried himself with the same Majesty he had used to do. His hair was all gray, which, making all others very sad, made it thought that he had sorrow in his coun∣tenance, which appear'd only by that shadow.</P>
<P>UPON <HI>Munday</HI> the 18<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>September,</HI> the Treaty begun, and the Commissioners presented their Commission to his Majesty, to treat with <MILESTONE N="20"/> him personally, upon the Propositions presented formerly at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, concerning the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> only, and upon such Propositions as should be offer'd either by his Majesty, or the two Houses of Parliament, according to their Instructions <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Though the King knew very well, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had so totally subdued <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> that he had not left any Man there in the least Authority or Power, who did so much as pretend to wish well to him, and that, in truth, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had as much the Command there as <HI>Argyle</HI> himself had, who was but his Creature, yet either to recover their broken Spirits, or to manifest his own Royal Compassion for them, he told the Commissioners, <MILESTONE N="30"/> <Q>“that, when the Propositions had been deliver'd to him at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, the <HI>Scots</HI> Interest was so involved in them, that it could be hardly separable from that of <HI>England:</HI> that it concern'd him, as King of both Kingdoms, to be just and equal between both; and that though they had no Authority to treat for any thing but what related to <HI>England,</HI> yet He, who was to provide for the publick Peace (which could hardly be provided for, except the <HI>Scots</HI> were comprehended in this Treaty) did desire, that they would send to the two Houses of Parliament, to give a Pass for one of his Servants to go into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to invite the Council there to send some body authorized by that King∣dom,”</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"/> who might treat with the Commissioners of Parliament: and to that purpose his Majesty deliver'd them a Paper in writing to be sent by them to the Parliament, telling them at the same time, <Q>“that it was never his desire or meaning, that they should meddle in the Govern∣ment of <HI>England,</HI> but only should treat concerning the Peace, to the end that that might be durable. But the Commissioners alledged, that it was not in Their power to receive and transmit that, or any other Paper, to the Parliament, that referr'd to that Kingdom; and they besought him to give them leave, as an evidence of their Duty, to inform him of what ill consequence the transmission of that Paper” <MILESTONE N="50"/> at that time might be to the Treaty it self.</Q> Whereupon he declined sending it by a Messenger of his own for the present (which he intended to have done) being unwilling to give any occasion of dispute or jealousy
<PB N="163" REF="1830"/>
so early, and believing that after he should have gotten a good under∣standing with the two Houses, in what was of immediate concernment to <HI>England,</HI> he should more effectually transmit that, or any other Pa∣per, for the more easy composing the affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>THEN they presented their first Proposition to his Majesty; <Q>“that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first Pro∣position for re∣voking all his Majesties De∣clarations</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> he would revoke all Declarations, and Commissions granted heretofore” by him against the Parliament.</Q> <Q>Whereupon his Majesty desired, “that he might see all the Propositions, they had to make to him, together; that he might the better consider what satisfaction he could give them” upon the whole: which they would not yield to without much im∣portunity, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and at last deliver'd them with reluctancy, as a thing they were not sure they ought to do.</Q> And though their Commission referr'd to Instructions, and his Majesty desired that he might have a view of those, they peremptorily refused to let him have a sight of them; and only told him, <Q>“that they were directed by their Instructions, first to treat upon the Proposition they had already presented to him, concern∣ing the revocation of the Declarations <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in the next place, of the Church, then of the Militia, and fourthly of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and after∣wards” of the rest of the Propositions in order;</Q> and they declared like∣wise that, <Q>“by their Instructions, they were not to enter upon any new <MILESTONE N="20"/> Propositions, before they should have receiv'd his Majesties final An∣swer” to what was first proposed.</Q></P>
<P>HEREUPON the King demanded of them, <Q>“whether they had power and authority to recede from any particular contained in their Propo∣sitions, or to consent to any alterations, if his Majesty should give” them good reason so to do?</Q> To which they Answer'd very magiste∣rially, <Q>“that they were ready to debate, to shew how reasonable their desires were, and that there could be no reason why they should alter, or recede from them; but if his Majesty did satisfy them, they should” do therein as they were warranted by their Instructions.</Q> These limi∣tations <MILESTONE N="30"/> and restrictions in a matter of that importance, which contain'd a new frame of Government, and an alteration of all Civil and Eccle∣siastical Constitutions, allmost damped and stifled all the hope his Ma∣jesty had entertain'd of good from this Treaty. However, he resolv'd to try if consenting to the substantial part of any Proposition would give them satisfaction; and so, without taking notice of the Preamble of that Proposition, which they had deliver'd to him, he declared in writing, which he deliver'd to them, <Q>“that he was willing to grant the” <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesties Answer to it.</NOTE> Body of their Proposition, that was to recal all Declarations <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> But they immediately return'd another Paper to him, in which they said, <MILESTONE N="40"/> <Q>“his Majesty had left unanswer'd the most essential part of their Propo∣sition,” repeating the words in the Preamble,</Q> which recited, <Q>“that the two Houses of Parliament had been necessitated to enter into a War in their just and lawful defence; and that the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> had” enter'd into a solemn League and Covenant to prosecute the same;</Q> and so justifying all that had been done <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To all which they very vehemently pressed <Q>“his Majesties approbation and consent, as the most necessary foundation of a lasting Peace, and the indispensable expecta∣tion of the two Houses and of the whole Kingdom; and that the two Houses, and the Kingdom, could not decline this particular demand, <MILESTONE N="50"/> without which they could not believe themselves to be in any security; since, by the Letter of the Law, they who had adhered to the Parlia∣ment, might seem Guilty of raising War against the King, and so to
<PB N="164" REF="1840"/>
be guilty of High Treason by the Statute of the 25<SUP>th</SUP> year of King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the third: whereas by the construction and Equity thereof they were justified; and therefore that the consenting to this Preamble was so essential, that without it the Parliament would be thought guilty;” which they hoped his Majesty did not desire it should.</Q> And tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this might make the deeper impression upon him, the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> in the de∣bate of it, twice repeated, with more passion than was natural to his Constitution, <Q>“that he did tremble to think how sad the consequence would be, if what they now pressed should be denied. And others said, that it was no more than his Majesty had heretofore granted in the Act of Indemnity that he had passed in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and if he should now <MILESTONE N="10"/> refuse to do it in <HI>England,</HI> there would be a speedy end put to the” Treaty, without entring upon any of the other Propositions.</Q> The King was so much perplexed, and offended with this haughty way of reasoning, that he told those with whom he consulted, and writ the same to the Prince his Son, <Q>“that the long restraint he had endured in the Castle of <HI>Carisbrooke,</HI> was not a greater evidence of the Captivity of his Person, nor was he more sensible of it, than this was of the Captivity of his Mind, by his being forced to decline those Answers and Arguments which were proper to the support of his Cause, and which must have brought blushes over the faces of the Commissioners, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and to frame others more seasonable and fit to be offer'd to Men in” that condition from him who was to receive, and not give conditions.</Q></P>
<P>HOWEVER, this Proposition was of so horrid and monstrous a Na∣ture, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dispute con∣cerning the Prea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble of it.</NOTE> so contrary to the known truth, and so destructive to justice and government, that it seem'd to naturalize Rebellion, and to make it cur∣rent in the Kingdom to all Posterity, that his Majesty could not forbear to tell them, <Q>“that no Act of Parliament could make that to be true which was notoriously known to be false; that this Treaty must be the foundation of the future peace and security, and what was herein provided for both could never be called in question; that he was most <MILESTONE N="30"/> willing, that it should be made very penal to every Man to reproach another for any thing he had done during the late Troubles, upon” what Provocation soever.</Q> <Q>He put them in mind, “that it was well known to some of them, that the Act of Indemnity in <HI>Scotland</HI> was passed when his Majesty was not there, nor any Commissioner appoint∣ed by him; that it was prepared, and drawn by his Atturney General of that Kingdom, who was then of the Party that was against his Ma∣jesty; and therefore it was no wonder that he called those of his own side, Loyal Subjects, and good Christians, in the Preamble of that Act; <MILESTONE N="40"/> which was never seen by his Majesty, though it was confirm'd indeed, with the other Acts which had passed in that disorderly time, by his Majesty upon the conclusion of the Peace, and their return to their obedience; and that, when that should be the case here, he would give them all the appellations they should desire, and as unquestionable se∣curity” as they could wish.</Q> To all which they made no other reply, and that unanimously, <Q>“but that they could not believe themselves se∣cure,” if that Preamble was not entirely consented to.</Q></P>
<P>THIS refractory obstinate adherence of the Commissioners to their own Will, without any shadow of reason, prevailed nothing upon the King; insomuch as he was enclined to run the hazard of the present <MILESTONE N="50"/> dissolution of the Treaty, and to undergo all the inconveniencies and mischiefs which probably might attend it, rather than to sacrifice his
<PB N="165" REF="1850"/>
Honour, and the Justice of his cause, to their insolent demand, until he had enter'd into a serious deliberation with those Persons who were about him, of whose affections to him he had all assurance, and of the great abilities, and understanding of most of them he had a very just esteem. They all represented to him, from the conference they had with such of the Commissioners, who, they were confident, spoke to them as they thought and believ'd, <Q>“that if there were no expedient found out to give more satisfaction upon this first Proposition, than his Majesty had yet offer'd, assoon as the Commissioners should give account of it to the two Houses, they would be presently recalled; <MILESTONE N="10"/> and the Treaty be at an end: and then it would be universally declared and believ'd, how untrue soever the assertion was, that the King re∣fused to secure the Parliament, and all who had adhered to them, from a Prosecution by Law; upon which they thought it to no purpose to proceed farther in the Treaty: whereas if his Majesty had condescended to them in that particular, which concern'd the Lives and Fortunes of their whole Party in the Kingdom, they would have given him such satisfaction in all other particulars, as a full and happy Peace must” have ensued.</Q></P>
<P>THEN the Lawyers inform'd him, <Q>“that his giving way to a recital <MILESTONE N="20"/> in a new Law, which was not a Declaratory Law of what the Law was formerly in being, concerning the business in question, and only in a Preamble to a Law for recalling Declarations <HI>&amp;c.</HI> did not make their Actions lawful, if they were not so before; nor did it take away from those who had adhered to him, any defence or benefit the for∣mer Laws had given to them; nor would his Party be in a worse con∣dition than they had allways been: for his Majesty had allways offer'd, in all his Declarations, that they who follow'd him, and who were by them called Delinquents, should, at all times, submit to a Trial by the Laws of the Land, and if they should be found guilty of any crime, they should not be protected by him. And it was evident, by their <MILESTONE N="30"/> not prosecuting any one, since they were fallen into their hands, in any legal way, that they do not think their transgressions can be pu∣nished” by Law.</Q></P>
<P>UPON these reasons, and the joynt advice and importunity of all about him, as well the Divines as the Lawyers, the King first deliver'd a Paper in writing to the Commissioners, in which he declared, <Q>“that nothing that should be put in writing concerning any Proposition, or part of any Proposition, should be binding, prejudicial, or made use” of, if the Treaty should break off without effect: and the Commis∣sioners <MILESTONE N="40"/> presented another Paper in writing, in which they fully consented to that Declaration, in the very terms of the said Declaration.</Q> There∣upon the King consented to pass the first Proposition, with the Preamble <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King con∣sents to it.</NOTE> to it, albeit, he said, <Q>“that he well foresaw the aspersions it would expose him to; yet he hoped his good Subjects would confess that it was but a part of the price he had paid for their benefit, and the peace of his” Dominions.</Q></P>
<P>THE first Proposition being thus consented to as they could wish, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Proposition concerning Re∣ligion and the Church.</NOTE> they deliver'd their second concerning Religion and the Church; which comprehended, <Q>“the utter abolishing Episcopacy, and all jurisdiction <MILESTONE N="50"/> exercised by Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Deans and Chapters, and alienating their Lands, which should be sold to the use and benefit of the Com∣mon-wealth; the Covenant; which was presented to his Majesty to

take himself, and to impose upon all others: the Common-Prayer, and publick Liturgy of the Church to be abolished, and taken away; and that the reformation of Religion, according to the Covenant, in such manner as both Houses had, or should agree, after consultation” with Divines, should be settled by Act of Parliament: which,</Q> the King told them, <Q>“exceeded the Implicit faith of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> which rather obliges her Proselytes to what she Does hold, than to what she” Shall.</Q> <Q>It required “the establishing the Presbyterian Government,” the Directory, the Articles of Christian Religion</Q> (a Body whereof they presented) <Q>“the suppressing Innovations in Churches; for the better <MILESTONE N="10"/> advancement of Preaching, the observation of the Lord's day; a Bill against Pluralities and Non-residency; several Acts against Papists; and” the taking and imposing the Covenant.</Q></P>
<P>THIS pregnant Proposition, containing so many monstrous particu∣lars, sufficiently warn'd his Majesty, how impossible it would be to give them satisfaction in all; and therefore having, by consenting to the en∣tire first Proposition, put it out of their power to break off the Treaty, and to tell the People, <Q>“that the King, at the entrance into it, had” denied to give them any security for their lives and fortunes, he thought it now fit to offer to the Commissioners a Proposition of his own, that <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of∣fers a Proposi∣tion of his own; which the Commis∣sioners refuse to send to the Houses.</NOTE> both the Parliament, and the People, might clearly discern how much of his own Right and Dignity he would sacrifice for their Peace;</Q> and which, he thought, might prevent the designs of those who might en∣deavour, upon one single Proposition, or part of a Proposition, to break the Treaty.</P>
<P>HIS own Proposition contained, in very few words, but three parti∣culars: 1. <Q>“That he might enjoy his Liberty: 2. That his Revenue” might be restored to him: 3. That an Act of Oblivion might pass: which, he very well knew, would be most grateful to those who seem'd to value it least, as it would exempt his own Friends from many illegal, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and unjust vexations.</Q></P>
<P>THE Commissioners absolutely refused to send it to the Houses, though they had no Authority to Answer it themselves. <Q>They said, “it rather contained an Answer to all their Propositions, than was a sin∣gle Proposition of his own; and that the sole end of making it, was” to cajole the People;</Q> which, the King told them, <Q>“better became Him” to do than any body else.</Q> But when they peremptorily refused to transmit it to the Houses, the King sent an Express of his own to de∣liver <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King sends it by Messen∣gers of his own; but it is voted unsatis∣factory.</NOTE> it; which being done, after some days deliberation, the Houses return'd no other Answer to the King, <Q>“than that his Proposition was” <MILESTONE N="40"/> not satisfactory.</Q> In the mean time the Commissioners press'd for his Answer to the first part of their Proposition, for the abolishing of Bishops. It would be very tedious and unnecessary to set down at large the dis∣pute, and Arguments which were used on both sides upon this Subject. The Commissioners, who would not suffer any of the King's Servants to be so much as present when any thing of the Treaty was agitated, thought fit now to let loose their own Clergy upon the King; who was much better versed in the Argument than They were.</P>
<P>THAT which they urged most, was the common Allegations <Q>“that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mini∣sters dispute with the King about the Bi∣shops.</NOTE> Bishop and Presbyter in the Scripture language signified one and the <MILESTONE N="50"/> same thing: that, if the Apostles exercised a larger jurisdiction, it had been granted to them as Apostles, and concern'd not their successors, to whom no such Authority had been granted, nor any superiority over”
<PB N="167" REF="1870"/>
other Presbyters, who were of the same Function with them.</Q> Then they inveighed vehemently against <Q>“Lords Bishops; their Pride, and” Lustre;</Q> and they all behaved themselves with that rudeness, as if they meant to be no longer subject to a King, no more than to a Bishop. And two of them very plainly and fiercely told the King, <Q>“that if he did” not consent to the utter abolishing of Episcopacy, he would be damn'd;</Q> with which his Majesty was not moved. The Men, <HI>Jenkins</HI> and <HI>Spur∣stow,</HI> liv'd after the return of King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, and, according to the modesty of that race of People, came to kiss his Majesties hand, and continued the same Zeal in all seditious attempts. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE King press'd them with those Texts of Scripture which have been constantly urged by those who maintain the <HI>jus Divinum</HI> of Bishops, the Authority of the Fathers, and the Government of all Christian Churches for fifteen hundred years, and particularly of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> before and since the Reformation, by constant and uniform practice and usage; which could not but be by themselves acknow∣ledged to have been by Bishops. The Commissioners reliev'd their ill manner'd Clergy, and urged, <Q>“that whatsoever was not of Divine insti∣tution might very Lawfully be alter'd; for if it had its Original from Men, it might by Men be changed, or reversed: that Episcopacy as <MILESTONE N="20"/> it was established in the Church by the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> was not that Episcopacy that was mention'd or prescribed in Scripture; and there∣fore the Laws which supported it, might be justly taken away; which, they said, was the reason that had induced many Men who were not Enemies to Episcopacy, to take the Covenant; which obliged them” to take the present Hierarchy away.</Q></P>
<P>IN a word they urged, <Q>“the practice of other Reform'd Churches, and that his Majesty insisting upon the preservation of Episcopacy, as essen∣tially” necessary, was to reproach and condemn Them.</Q> To which he Answer'd, <Q>“that both <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Beza,</HI> and most learned Men of the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Reform'd Churches, had approv'd, and commended the Episcopal Go∣vernment in <HI>England;</HI> and many of them had bewailed themselves,” that they were not permitted to retain that Government.</Q></P>
<P>BESIDES all their Arguments in publick, which his Majesty with wonderful acuteness fully Answer'd, and deliver'd his Answers in writing to them (which none of them ever after undertook to reply unto) they found means in private to advertise the King, that is, such of them who were known to wish well to him, <Q>“that they were of his Majesties judge∣ment with reference to the Government, which they hoped might yet be preserv'd, but not by the method his Majesty pursued: that all the <MILESTONE N="40"/> reasonable hope of preserving the Crown, was in dividing the Parlia∣liament from the Army; which could be only done by his giving sa∣tisfaction in what was demanded with reference to the Church; which would unite the Parliament in it self, some few Persons excepted, and the City to the Parliament; where the Presbyterians were most power∣ful; and this being done, the Parliament would immediately have power to reform their Army; and to disband those who would not be reform'd: That then the King would be removed to <HI>London,</HI> to per∣fect that by his own presence in Parliament, which should be prepared by this Treaty; and then the wording those Bills, and the formality <MILESTONE N="50"/> of passing them, would give opportunity for many alterations; which, being now attempted, would destroy all, and reconcile the Parliament to the Army; which would destroy the King: But then, what the
<PB N="168" REF="1880"/>
King urged as matter of Conscience in himself would find respect, re∣verence,” and concurrence.</Q> No doubt they who did make these Insi∣nuations, did in truth believe themselves; and did think, as well as wish, that the sequel would be such as they foretold. But that which had more Authority with the King, and which no body about him could put him in mind of, because none of them had been Privy to it, was the remembrance of what he had promised concerning the Church to the <HI>Scots,</HI> in the Engagement at the Isle of <HI>Wight;</HI> which he could not but conclude was well known to many of the Presbyterians in <HI>England:</HI> and he thought, that whatever he had promised to do then, upon the bare hope and probability of raising an Army, he might reasonably now offer when that Army was destroyed, and no hope left of raising an∣other. And thereupon he did, with much reluctancy, offer the same <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Concessions on this point.</NOTE> he had then promised to do; which was, <Q>“to suspend Episcopacy for three years, and then upon consultation with Divines, amongst which he would nominate twenty to be present, and to consult with them, such a Government of the Church as should be agreed upon might be established: that he would not force any Man to take the Covenant, and would have the Privilege of his own Chapel to use the Common Prayer, and observe the same worship he had used to do; and that all <MILESTONE N="$$"/> Persons, who desired it, might have liberty to take the Covenant, and” to use the Directory;</Q> in fine, he consented to all that he had offer'd in that Engagement with reference to the Government of the Church; and likewise, <Q>“that Money should be raised upon the sale of the Church Lands, and only the old Rent should be reserv'd to the just owners and” their successors.</Q> These, with some other Concessions of less impor∣tance, which related to other Branches of the same Proposition, <HI>magna inter suspiria,</HI> he deliver'd to the Commissioners as his final Answer; which the Major part of them, did then believe would have preserv'd his Majesty from farther importunity and vexation in that particular. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE next Proposition was concerning the Militia; which was their <NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Pro∣position con∣cerning the Militia.</NOTE> Darling; and distinguished the <HI>Scots</HI> from the <HI>English</HI> Presbyterians; the former never desiring to invade that unquestionable Prerogative of the Crown; the latter being in truth as fond of it (and as refractory without it) as of Presbytery it self; and in that particular concurr'd even with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and made little doubt of subduing him by it in a short time. In this demand they exercised their usual modesty, and to abridge the substance of it in few words, they required <Q>“a power to keep up the present Army, and to raise what other Armies they pleased for the future; which gave them Authority over the Persons of all Subjects <MILESTONE N="40"/> of what degree or quality soever. Secondly, a power to raise Money for the use and maintenance of those Forces, in such a manner, and” by such ways and means, as they should think fit.</Q> And hereby they had had the disposal of the Estates and Fortunes of all Men without re∣straint, or limitation. <Q>Thirdly, “all Forces by Land and Sea to be ma∣naged,” and disposed as They should think fit, and not otherwise.</Q> All this modest Power and Authority <Q>“must be granted to the Lords and” Commons for twenty years.</Q> And, as if this had not been enough, they required farther, <Q>“that in all Cases, when the Lords and Commons shall declare the safety of the Kingdom to be concern'd, unless the King give <MILESTONE N="50"/> his Royal Assent to such a Bill as shall be tender'd to him for raising Money, the Bill shall have the force of an Act of Parliament, as if he” had given his Royal Assent.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="1890"/>
THERE were other particulars included, of power to the City of <HI>London</HI> over the Militia, and for the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> of no impor∣tance to the King, if he once disposed, and granted the other as was re∣quired, nor need he take care to whom the rest belonged. Here the King was to consider whether he would wholely grant it, or wholely deny it, or whether he might reasonably hope so to limit it, that They might have Authority enough to please them, and He reserve some to himself for his own security. The King had thought with himself, upon revolving all Expedients, which he had too long warning to ruminate upon, to propose <Q>“that the Inhabitants of every County should be the <MILESTONE N="10"/> standing Militia of the Kingdom, to be drawn out of the Counties” upon any occasions which should occur;</Q> which would prevent all ex∣cessive Taxes and Impositions, when they were to be paid by themselves. But he quickly discern'd that such a Proposition would be presently called a Conspiracy against the Army, and so put an end to all other Ex∣pedients. Then he thought of limiting the extravagant power in such a manner, that it might not appear so monstrous to all intents and pur∣poses whatsoever; and therefore proposed, <Q>“that none should be com∣pelled <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Answer</NOTE> to serve in the War against their Wills, but in case of an Inva∣sion by Foreign Enemies: that the power concerning the Land Forces <MILESTONE N="20"/> should be exercised to no other Purposes, than for the suppressing of Forces which might at any time be raised without the Authority and C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent of the Lords and Commons, and for the keeping up, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntaining the Forts and Garrisons, and the present Army, so long as it should be thought fit by both Houses of Parliament: That what Monies should at any time be thought necessary to be raised, should be raised by general and equal Taxes, and Impositions; and lastly, that all Patents and Commissions to the purposes aforesaid might be made in the King's name, by Warrant signified by the Lords and Commons, or such other signification as they should direct, and” au∣thorise.</Q> <MILESTONE N="$$"/></P>
<P>THESE Limitations were sent to the Parliament, who, according to the method they had assumed, soon voted <Q>“that the Message was” unsa∣tis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>actory. <NOTE PLACE="marg">This <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the Parlia∣ment unsatis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>actory.</NOTE></Q> Hereupon, that he might at least leave some Monument and Record of his care and tenderness of his People (for after his ex∣torted concessions to the so great prejudice of the Church, he never con∣sider'd what might be dangerous to his own Person) he deliver'd his con∣sent to the Proposition it self to the Commissioners, with a Preamble to this purpose; <Q>“that whereas their Proposition concerning the Mili∣tia, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on∣sents to it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ble.</NOTE> required a far larger power over the Persons and Estates of his <MILESTONE N="40"/> Subjects, than had been ever hitherto warranted by the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom, yet in regard the present distractions might require more, and trusting in his two Houses of Parliament, that they would make no farther use of the power therein mention'd, after the present distempers should be settled, than should be agreeable to the legal Exercise thereof in times past, and for the purposes particularly mention'd in their Proposition, and to give satisfaction to his two Houses of Parliament that he intends a full security to them, and to express his real desires to settle the Peace of the Kingdom, his Majesty doth consent to the Proposition concerning the Militia as it was” de∣sired. <MILESTONE N="50"/></Q> This the Commissioners did by no means like, nor would ac∣quiesce in, and ailedged, <Q>“that as the Concession must be the Subject of an Act of Parliament, so this Preamble must be a part of it, and would
<PB N="170" REF="1900"/>
administer occasion of difference and dispute upon the interpretation of it; which being so clearly foreseen, ought not to be admitted in Any Act of Parliament, much less in such a One as is to be the prin∣cipal” Foundation of a lasting Peace of the Kingdom.</Q> After much vexa∣tion of this kind, and importunity of Friends, as well as of Enemies, and being allmost as weary of denying as of granting, he suffer'd the <NOTE PLACE="marg">At last con∣sents to it without the Preamble.</NOTE> Preamble to be left out, and his consent to be deliver'd without it.</P>
<P>IT may be well wonder'd at, that, after having so far complied with these three Propositions, there should be any pause or haesitation in the debate of the rest. For in that concerning the Church, and the other <MILESTONE N="$$"/> concerning the Militia, both the Church and the Militia of <HI>Ireland</HI> followed the Fate of <HI>England,</HI> and were in effect comprehended in the same Propositions: so that there remain'd nothing more with reference to that Kingdom, <Q>“but declaring the Peace that was made there with” <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fourth Proposition concerning</HI> Ireland</NOTE> the <HI>Irish,</HI> to be void;</Q> which they pressed with the same passion, as if they had obtain'd nothing; although his Majesty referr'd the carrying on the War to them, and told them, <Q>“that he knew nothing of the Peace, which had been made during his Imprisonment, when he could re∣ceive no Advertisement of what was doing, or done; and therefore he was content that it should be broken, and the War be carried on in” <MILESTONE N="20"/> such a manner as should please Them;</Q> which was all one to their ends and purposes, as what they desired. But this did by no means please them. If the Peace were not declared to be actually void, they could not so easily take that vengeance of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> as they re∣solv'd to do. Yet after all these general concessions, which so much con∣cern'd Himself, and the Publick, and when the necessity that had obliged him to that unwilling complyance, might well have excused him for satisfying them in all the rest of their demands, when they pressed his consent to what only concern'd private and particular Persons, as the revoking all Honours and Grants of Offices which he had conferr'd upon <MILESTONE N="$$"/> those who had serv'd him faithfully, and to except many of them from Pardon, and leave them to the unmerciful censure of the two Houses, both for their Lives and Fortunes; to submit others to pay, for their Delinquency in obeying and serving him, a full moiety of all they were worth; to deprive others of their practice in their several Professions, and Functions (which exposed all the Lawyers and Divines who had been faithful to him, to utter ruin) it cannot be exprest with what grief, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some other particulars the King at first sticks at:</NOTE> and trouble of mind he receiv'd those importunities; and without doubt, he would at that time with much more willingness have died, than sub∣mitted to it; <Q>but the Argument “”that he had done so much, was now <MILESTONE N="40"/> press'd upon him</Q> (by his Friends, and those who were to receive as much prejudice as any by his doing it) <Q>“that he should do more; and since he had condescended to many things which gave himself no sa∣tisfaction, he would give so full satisfaction to the Parliament, that He might receive that benefit, and the Kingdom that Peace and” se∣curity he desired.</Q></P>
<P>MANY Advertisements came from his Friends in <HI>London,</HI> and from other places, <Q>“that it was high time that the Treaty were at an end, and that the Parliament had all his Majesties Answers before them, to de∣termine what they would do upon them, before the Army drew nearer <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>London;</HI> which, infallibly, it would shortly do, assoon as those in the” North had finished their work.</Q> It was now near the end of <HI>October,</HI> and the appointed time for the conclusion of the Treaty was the fourth of
<PB N="171" REF="1910"/>
<HI>November;</HI> and so after all importunities, as well of those who were to suffer, as of those who were to triumph in their sufferings, his Ma∣jesties consent was procured to most that was demanded in the rest of <NOTE PLACE="marg">But consents at last.</NOTE> the Propositions; the King, and all Men, conceiving the Treaty to be at an end.</P>
<P>THE King had, about the middle of <HI>October,</HI> again deliver'd his own Proposition for his Liberty, his Revenue, and an Act of Oblivion, to the Commissioners; which they receiv'd. And though, at the beginning of the Treaty, they had refused to transmit it to the Houses, yet now, after so many concessions, they thought fit to send it; and did so assoon <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commis∣sioners now send the King's own Proposi∣tion to the Parliament.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"/> as they receiv'd it. But no Answer was return'd. Hereupon, when the Treaty was within two days of expiring, his Majesty demanded of them, <Q>“whether they had receiv'd any Instructions to treat upon, or to give an Answer to his own Proposition, which he had deliver'd to them so long since? or whether they had receiv'd any Order to prolong the” Treaty?</Q> To which they Answer'd, <Q>“”they had not as to either.</Q> And when he asked them the same Question, the very last hour of the limited time, they made the same Answer. So that the whole forty days assign'd for the Treaty were expired, before they vouchsafed to return any An∣swer to the single Proposition the King had made to them. However <MILESTONE N="20"/> they told him, <Q>“they had receiv'd new Command to make fresh instance to his Majesty, that he would forthwith publish a Declaration against <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They require a Declaration of the King a∣gainst the Marquis of</HI> Ormond.</NOTE> the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> who had very lately declared, that he had Authority to make a Peace with the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebels; and was then treat∣ing with them to that purpose. To which his Majesty Answer'd, that it was not reasonable to press him to publish any Declaration <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesties Answer.</NOTE> against the Marquis; since that if the Treaty should end happily, the desires of the two Houses were satisfied by the Concessions he had al∣ready” made;</Q> and so adhered to his first Answer. And conceiving the Treaty to be closed, he desired the Commissioners, <Q>“that since He had <MILESTONE N="30"/> departed from so much of his own Right to give his two Houses satis∣faction, They would be a means that he might be pressed no farther; since the few things he had not satisfied them in, had so near relation to his Conscience, that, with the Peace of that, he could not yield far∣ther;”</Q> and desired them <Q>“to use the same eloquence, and abilities, by which they had prevailed with Him, in representing to the two Houses the sad condition of the Kingdom, if it were not preserv'd by this” Treaty.</Q> And so concluded with many gracious expressions for their Personal civilities, and other kind Expressions; which made impression upon all of them who had any Bowels. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>ALL this being past, and the King believing and expecting that the Commissioners would take their leave of him the next morning, they came the same night to inform him, <Q>“that they had then receiv'd new Orders and Instructions for the continuing and enlarging the Treaty” <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia-ment enlarge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Treaty</HI> 14 <HI>days longer</HI></NOTE> for fourteen days longer;</Q> for which his Majesty was nothing glad; nor did they in the Houses who wished well to him, desire that Prolon∣gation. For it was easily discern'd, that it was moved and prosecuted only by them who did not intend that the Treaty it self should have any good effect; which they were not yet ready and prepared enough to prevent, the Army not having yet finished what they were to do in <MILESTONE N="50"/> all places; and was consented to unskilfully, by those who thought the continuance of the Treaty was the best sign that both sides desired Peace: and it quickly appear'd, by the new instances they made, that delay was
<PB N="172" REF="1920"/>
their only business. The Commissioners, with new importunity, and bit∣terness, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commis∣sioners renew their Demand about</HI> Or∣mond.</NOTE> begun upon their new Instructions, <Q>“that the King would im∣mediately” publish the Declaration against the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI></Q> without any other reasons than those which he had Answer'd before. His Majesty Answer'd, <Q>“there was no other difference between them <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesties Answer.</NOTE> but in point of time, whether presently, or at the conclusion of the Peace: upon the Peace, they had the substance of their desire already granted; and if there were no Peace, they had reason to believe that” no Declaration he should make would be believed or obeyed;</Q> and so adhered to what he had Answer'd formerly. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THEN they declared, <Q>“that the Parliament was not satisfied with <NOTE PLACE="marg">They urge far∣ther about the Church.</NOTE> his Concessions with reference to the Church; that the Presbyterian Government could be exercised with little profit, or comfort, if it should appear to be so short-liv'd as to continue but for three years; and that they must therefore press the utter extirpating the Function” of Bishops.</Q> Then, the perfect and entire alienation of their Lands was insisted on; whereas by the King's Concessions, the old Rent was still reserv'd to them. <Q>They said, “the Parliament did not intend to force,” but only to rectify his Conscience;</Q> and, to that end, they added more reasons to convince him in the several points. They repeated their old <MILESTONE N="20"/> distinction between the Scripture-Bishop, and the Bishop by Law. For the absolute alienation of their Lands, they urged many Precedents of what had been done in former times upon convenience, or necessity, not so visible and manifest as appear'd at present; and concluded with their usual threat, <Q>“that the consequence of his denial would be the con∣tinuance” of the publick disturbances.</Q></P>
<P>To all which his Majesty Answer'd, <Q>“that, for the Presbyterian Go∣vernment, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer.</NOTE> they might remember that their own first Order for the settling it, was only for three years; which they then thought a com∣petent time for a Probationary Law, that contain'd such an alteration <MILESTONE N="30"/> in the State; and therefore they ought to think the same now: and that it might be longer lived than three years, if it would in that time bear the test, and examination of it; and that nothing could be a greater honour to that discipline, than its being able to bear that test” and examination.</Q> <Q>He said, “he was well pleased with their Expression, that they did not intend to force his Conscience; yet the manner of pressing him looked very like it, after he had so solemnly declared that it was against his Conscience; that he did concur with them in their distinction of Bishops, and if they would preserve the Scripture-Bishop,” he would take away the Bishop by Law.</Q> <Q>He consessed, “that <MILESTONE N="40"/> Necessity might justify, or excuse many things, but it could never warrant him to deprive the Church of God of an Order instituted for continual use, and for establishing a succession of Lawful Ministers” in the Church.</Q> For the point of sacrilege, <Q>he said, “the concurrent opinion of all Divines was a much better information to his Conscience,” what is sacrilege, than any Precedents or Law of the Land could be.</Q> Upon the whole matter, he adhered to his former Answer in all the particulars, and concluded, <Q>“that he could with more comfort cast him∣self upon God's goodness to support him in, and defend him from all Afflictions, how great soever, that might befal him, than deprive <MILESTONE N="50"/> himself of the inward tranquillity of his mind, for any Politick consi∣deration” that might seem to be a means to restore him.</Q></P>
<P>IT must not be forgotten, that the last day, when the Treaty was to
<PB N="173" REF="1930"/>
end, they deliver'd to the King the Votes which the two Houses had passed concerning and upon his own Message (which had lain so long in their hands unanswer'd) which were in effect, <Q>1. “That from and after <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment's Votes upon the King's former Proposition.</NOTE> such time as the Agreements upon this Treaty should be ratified by Acts of Parliament, all his Houses, Mannors, and Lands, with the growing Rents and Profits thereof, and all other Legal Revenue of the Crown should be restored to him, liable to the maintenance of those Ancient Forts, and Castles, and such other Legal Charges as they were formerly charged withal, or liable to. 2. That he should be then like∣wise resettled in a condition of honour, freedom, and safety, agreeable <MILESTONE N="10"/> to the Laws of the Land. 3. That an Act of Indemnity should be then passed with such exceptions and limitations as should be agreed upon, with this addition, that it should be declared by Act of Parliament, that nothing contain'd in his Majesties Propositions should be under∣stood or made use of to abrogate, weaken, or in any degree to impair any Agreement in this Treaty, or any Law, Grant, or Commission agreed upon by his Majesty and the two Houses of Parliament, in pur∣suance” thereof;</Q> in all which his Majesty acquiesced,</P>
<P>THE time limited for the Prolongation of the Treaty was to end upon the one and twentieth of <HI>November,</HI> and the Commissioners be∣liev'd <MILESTONE N="20"/> it so absolutely concluded, that they took their leave of the King, and early the next morning went to <HI>Cows</HI> Harbour to embark them∣selves. But the Tyde not serving to transport them out of the Island, that night a Messenger arrived with Directions to them to continue the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Another Pro∣longation of the Treaty till</HI> Nov. 25.</NOTE> Treaty till the five and twentieth; which was four days more. So, the three and twentieth, they return'd and acquainted his Majesty with it.</P>
<P>AT the same time, the thundring Declaration of the Army was pub∣lished; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Declara∣tion of the Army.</NOTE> which declared the full resolution <Q>“to change the whole frame of the Government, and that they would be contented with no less an” alteration;</Q> which, as it was an Argument to the King to endeavour <MILESTONE N="30"/> all he could to unite the two Houses, that they might be able to bear that shock, so it was expected that it would have been no less an Ar∣gument to have prevailed with them to adhere to the King, since Their Interest was no less threaten'd than His.</P>
<P>THE fresh Instances the Commissioners made, were upon several <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commis∣sioners new Propositions against Delin∣quents since Jan</HI> 47. <HI>and others, espe∣cially the Mar∣quis of</HI> Or∣mond.</NOTE> Votes which had passed the two Houses against Delinquents; and a new Proposition concerning those who had engaged themselves against the Parliament since the last <HI>January,</HI> and particularly against the Marquis of <HI>Ormond.</HI> <Q>They proposed, “that there should be seven Persons, the” Lord <HI>New-Castle,</HI></Q> and six others (who were named) <Q>“who should be <MILESTONE N="40"/> excepted from pardon, and their Estates forseited: that the Delin∣quents, in the several Classes mention'd in their Proposition, should pay for their Composition, some a Moiety, others a third part of their Estates, and other Rates, as they were set down; and that all who had been engaged in the Land or Sea-Service since <HI>January</HI> 1647, should pay a full years value of their whole Estates more than the other Delinquents; and that none who had been against the Parlia∣ment should presume to come within either of the Courts belonging to the King, Queen, or Prince, or be capable of any Office or Preser∣ment, or of serving in Parliament, for the space of three years; and <MILESTONE N="50"/> that all Clergy Men who had been against the Parliament, should be deprived of all their Preserments, Places, and Promotions; which” should be all void as if they were naturally dead.</Q> To these the King
<PB N="174" REF="1940"/>
Answer'd, that, <Q>“to the excepting the seven Persons named from Par∣don, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer.</NOTE> and the forfeiture of their Estates, his Answer was, that, if they were proceeded against according to the ancient established Laws, and could not justify and defend themselves, he would not interpose on their behalf; but he could not, in justice or honour, joyn himself in any Act for taking away the Life or Estate of any that had adhered to him. For the Rates which were to be paid for Composition, he re∣ferr'd it to the two Houses of Parliament, and to the Persons them∣selves, who would be contented to pay it; and he did hope and de∣sire, that they might be moderately dealt with. And for the Clergy” <MILESTONE N="10"/> Men,</Q> whose Preferments he well knew were already disposed of, and in the hands of another kind of Clergy, who had deserv'd so well of the Parliament, that it would not be in his power to dispossess them, his Majesty desired, <Q>“that they might be allowed a third part of what was taken from them, till such time that they, or the present Incumbents,” should be better provided for.</Q> As to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> against whom they pressed what they had before done with extraordinary Ani∣mosity, the King Answer'd, <Q>“”that since what he had said before</Q> (and which would bring all to pass that they desired) <Q>“did not give them sa∣tisfaction,” he had written a Letter</Q> (which he deliver'd to them to be <MILESTONE N="20"/> sent, and read to them) <Q>“in which he directed him to desist; and said, if he refused to submit to his Command, he would then publish such” a Declaration against his power and his proceedings, as they desired.</Q></P>
<P>AND now the second limitation of time for the Treaty was at an <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Pro∣longation of the Treaty for a day, wherein they present two Proposi∣tions more.</NOTE> end. But that Night came another Vote; which continued it for a day longer, with a Command to the Commissioners to return on <HI>Thursday</HI> Morning; which was the eight and twentieth of <HI>November:</HI> and there∣upon they presented two Propositions to his Majesty, which were to be dispatched that day.</P>
<P>THE two Propositions they sent for one days work, were, the first, <MILESTONE N="30"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>One concern∣ing</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> concerning <HI>Scotland;</HI> the other, concerning the Church; which they did not think they had yet destroyed enough. <Q>For <HI>Scotland,</HI> they de∣manded “the King's consent, to confirm by Act of Parliament such Agreements as should be made by both Houses with that Kingdom, in the security of such thereof who had assisted or adhered to those of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> and for the settling and preserving a happy and durable Peace between the two Nations, and for the mutual de∣fence” of each other.</Q> The King put them in mind, <Q>“that at the be∣ginning <NOTE PLACE="marg">To that the King's An∣swer.</NOTE> of the Treaty they had inform'd him, that their Commission was only to treat concerning <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and that they had <MILESTONE N="40"/> no Authority to meddle in any thing that related to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that they had thereupon refused to receive a Paper from him, which was to preserve the Interest of that Kingdom; and demanded of them,” whether their Commission was enlarged?</Q> which they confess'd <Q>“was not; and that they had presented that Paper only in obedience to the” Order they had receiv'd.</Q> So that the King easily understood that the end was only that they might have occasion to publish, <Q>“that the King had rejected whatsoever was tender'd to him on the behalf of the King∣dom” of <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> To prevent which, <Q>he Answer'd, “that as he would joyn in any Agreement, to be confirm'd by Act of Parliament, for <MILESTONE N="50"/> the settling and preserving a happy and durable Peace between the two Nations, and for their mutual defence of each other under him as King of both; so he would secure all who had been formerly engaged with
<PB N="175" REF="1950"/>
them; but for any new Engagement, or Confederacy, which they would make hereafter, he would first know what it was, and be ad∣vised” with in the making it, before he would promise to confirm it.</Q> The other business with reference to the Church gave him much more <NOTE PLACE="marg">The other tou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> trouble. <Q>The Commissioners press'd him “to consider the Exigence of time, and that there was not a whole day left to determine the Fate of the Kingdom; and that nothing could unite the Counsels of those who wished and desired Peace, and to live happily under his Sub∣jection and obedience, against the bold attempts of the Army, which had enough declared and manifested what their intention was, but sa∣tisfying” <MILESTONE N="10"/> the Houses fully in what they demanded in that particular.</Q> His own Council, and the Divines, besought him <Q>“to consider the safety of his own Person, even for the Church's and his People's sakes, who had some hope still left whilst He should be preserv'd, which could not but be attended with many Blessings: whereas, if He were destroyed, there was scarce a possibility to preserve them: that the moral and un∣avoidable necessity that lay upon him, obliged him to do any thing that was not Sin; and that, upon the most prudential thoughts which occurr'd to them, the Order which He, with so much Piety and Zeal, endeavour'd to preserve, was much more like to be destroyed by his <MILESTONE N="20"/> not complying, than by his suspending it till his Majesty and his two Houses should agree upon a future Government; which, they said,” much differ'd from an abolition of it.</Q></P>
<P>HEREUPON he gave them his final Answer, <Q>“that after such con∣descensions, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's fi∣nal Answer.</NOTE> and weighed resolutions in the business of the Church, he had expected not to be farther press'd therein; it being his judgement,” and his conscience.</Q> <Q>He said, “he could not, as he was then inform'd, abolish Episcopacy out of the Church; yet, because he apprehended how fatal new distractions might be to the Kingdom, and that he be∣liev'd his two Houses would yield to truth, if it were made manifest <MILESTONE N="30"/> to them, as he had allways declared that he would comply with their Demands, if he were convinced in his Conscience, he did therefore again desire a consultation with Divines, in the manner he had before proposed, and would in the mean time suspend the Episcopal power, as well in point of Ordination of Ministers, as of Jurisdiction, till He and the two Houses should agree what Government should be establish'd for the future. For Bishop's Lands, he could not consent to the ab∣solute alienation of them from the Church, but would consent that Leases for Lives, or Years, not exceeding ninety nine, should be made” for the satisfaction of Purchasers or Contractors;</Q> little differing from <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Answer he had formerly given to this last particular: and in all the rest he adhered to his former Answers. And the Commissioners, having receiv'd this his final Answer, took their leaves, and the next morning begun their Journey towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>THE King had begun a Letter to the Prince his Son before the first forty days were expired, and continued it, as the Treaty was lengthen'd, even to the hour it was concluded, and finished it the nine and twentieth of <HI>November</HI> after the Commissioners were departed, and with it sent a very exact Copy of all the Papers which had passed in the Treaty, in the order in which they were passed, fairly engrossed by one of the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Clerks who attended. But the Letter it self was all in his own hand, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sum of the King's Letter to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Son concern∣ing th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whole Treaty</NOTE> contained above six Sheets of Paper; in which he made a very parti∣cular relation of all the motives and reasons which had prevailed with
<PB N="176" REF="1960"/>
him, or over him, to make those Concessions; out of which most of this relation is extracted. And it is allmost evident, that the Major part of both Houses of Parliament was, at that time, so far from desiring the execution of all those Concessions, that, if they had been able to have resisted the wild fury of the Army, they would have been themselves Suitors to have declined the greatest part of them. That which seem'd to afflict him most, next what referr'd to the Church and Religion, and which, he said, <Q>“”had a large share in his conscientious considerations, was the hard measure his Friends were subjected to;</Q> for whose Interest he did verily believe he should better provide in the execution of the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Treaty, than he had been able to do in the Preliminaries. <Q>For, he said, “he could not but think, that all who were willing that he should con∣tinue their King, and to live under his Government, would be far from desiring in the conclusion to leave so foul a Brand upon his Party, of which they would all desire to be accounted for the time to come. However, he hoped that all his Friends would consider, not what he had submitted to, but how much he had endeavour'd to relieve them” from;</Q> and conjured the Prince his Son, <Q>“that the less he had been able himself to do for them, the more, if God blessed him, He should” acknowledge and supply.</Q> <Q>He said, “he would willingly forget in how <MILESTONE N="20"/> high degree some Subjects had been disloyal, but never had Prince a Testimony in others of more Loyalty than He had had; and however that God, for their, and his punishment, had not blessed some of their Endeavours, yet, he said, more misguided Persons were at last reduced to their Loyalty, than could in any story be exampled; and that, by that, Subjects might learn how dangerous the neglect of seasonable duty is; and that Men cannot easily fix when they please what they” have unnecessarily shaken.</Q> The conclusion of the Letter, as it was dated, the five and twentieth of <HI>November</HI> (what was added to it after, till the nine and twentieth, was but the additional passages upon the <MILESTONE N="30"/> enlargement of time) deserves to be preserv'd in Letters of Gold, and gives the best Character of that excellent Prince; and was in these words.</P>
<P><Q>“BY what hath been said, you see how long We have labour'd in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conclusion of that Letter in the King's own words.</NOTE> the search of Peace: do not Yee be dishearten'd to tread in the same steps. Use all worthy ways to restore your self to your Right, but pre∣fer the way of Peace: shew the greatness of your mind, if God bless you (and let Us comfort you with that which is our own Comfort, that though Affliction may make us pass under the censures of Men, yet We look upon it so, as if it procure not, by God's Mercy, to Us a <MILESTONE N="40"/> Deliverance, it will to You a Blessing) rather to conquer your Enemies by pardoning, than punishing. If You saw how unmanly and unchri∣stian the implacable disposition is in our ill Willers, you would avoid that Spirit. Censure Us not for having parted with so much of our own Right; the price was great, but the commodity was security to Us, Peace to our People: and we were confident, another Parliament would remember how useful a King's power is to a People's liberty; of how much thereof We devested Our self, that We and They might meet once again in a due Parliamentary way, to agree the bounds of Prince and People. And in this give belief to our Experience, never <MILESTONE N="50"/> to affect more Greatness or Prerogative, than that which is really and intrinsically for the Good of Subjects, not the satisfaction of Favou∣rites. If you thus use it, you will never want means to be a Father to
<PB N="177" REF="1970"/>
all, and a bountiful Prince to any you would be extraordinary gracious to. You may perceive all Men entrust their Treasure where it returns them Interest; and if Princes, like the Sea, receive, and repay all the fresh streams the River entrusts with them, they will not grudge, but pride themselves to make them up an Ocean. These considerations may make You as great a Prince, as your Father is now a low one; and Your State may be so much the more established, as Mine hath been shaken. For our Subjects have learn'd (we dare say) that Victories over their Princes are but Triumphs over themselves; and so will be more unwilling to hearken to changes hereafter. The <HI>English</HI> Nation” <MILESTONE N="10"/> are a sober People, however at present infatuated.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“WE know not but this may be the last time We may speak to you, or the world, publickly: We are sensible into what hands We are fallen; and yet, We bless God, We have those inward refreshments the malice of our Enemies cannot perturb. We have learn'd to busy Our self by retiring into Our self; and therefore can the better digest what befalls us; not doubting but God's providence will restrain our” Enemies power, and turn their fierceness to his praise.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“TO conclude, if God gives you success, use it humbly and far from Revenge. If He restore you to your Right upon hard conditions, what∣ever you promise, keep.

</LETTER>
<P>WHILST the Treaty lasted, it was believ'd that his Majesty might have made his escape; which most Men who wished him well, thought in all respects ought to have been attempted; and before the Treaty, he <MILESTONE N="40"/> himself was inclined to it, thinking any Liberty preferable to the re∣straint he had endured. But he did receive some discouragement from pursuing that purpose, which both diverted him from it, and gave him great trouble of mind. It cannot be imagin'd how wonderfully fearful some Persons in <HI>France</HI> were that he should have made his Escape, and the dread they had of his coming thither; which, without doubt, was not from want of tenderness of his safety, but from the apprehension they had, that the little respect they would have shewed him there, would have been a greater mortification to him than all that he could <MILESTONE N="50"/> suffer by the closest imprisonment. And sure there was, at that time, no Court in <HI>Christendom</HI> so honourably, or generously constituted, that it would have been glad to have seen him; and it might be some reason
<PB N="178" REF="1980"/>
that they who wished him very well, did not wish his Escape, because they believ'd imprisonment was the worst his worst Enemies intended towards him; since they might that way more reasonably found, and settle their Republican Government; which Men could not so pru∣dently propose to bring to pass by a Murther; which, in the instant, gave the just Title to another who was at liberty to claim his Right, and to dispute it: I say, before the Treaty, and after the Votes and De∣clarations of no more Addresses, when his Treatment was so barbarous, his Majesty had proposed to himself to make an Escape, and was very near the perfecting it. He had none about him but such persons who <MILESTONE N="$$"/> were placed by those who wished worst to his safety; and therefore chose such Instruments as they thought to be of their own Principles. Amongst those there was a young Man, one <HI>Osborne,</HI> by extraction a Gentleman; who was recommended by the Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> (one who deserv'd not to be suspected by <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself) to Colonel <HI>Hammond,</HI> to be placed in some near attendance about the King; and he, from the recommendation, never doubting the fitness of the Man, immediately appointed him to wait as Gentleman Usher; which gave him oppor∣tunity to be allmost allways in the presence of the King. This young Man, after some months attendance, was wrought upon by the dignity <MILESTONE N="$$"/> of the King's carriage, and the great Affability he used towards those who were allways about him, to have a tenderness and loyal Sense of his sufferings; and did really desire to do him any service that might be acceptable. By his Office of Gentleman Usher he usually held the King's Gloves when he was at meat, and first took that opportunity to put a little Billet, in which he express'd his Devotion, into one of the fingers of his Glove. The King was not forward to be credulous of the Pro∣fessions of a Person he knew so little, and who, he knew, would not be suffer'd to be about him, if he were thought to have those Inclinations. However, after longer observation, and sometimes speaking to him <MILESTONE N="30"/> whilst he was walking amongst others in the Garden allowed for that purpose, his Majesty begun to believe that there was sincerity in him; and so frequently put some Memorial into fingers of his Glove, and by the same expedient receiv'd advertisement from him.</P>
<P>THERE was in the Garrison one <HI>Rolph,</HI> a Captain of a Foot Com∣pany, whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> placed there as a prime confident, a fellow of a low Extraction, and very ordinary parts; who, from a Common Sol∣dier, had been trusted in all the intriegues of the Army, and was one of the Agitators inspired by <HI>Cromwell</HI> to put any thing into the Soldier's minds, upon whom he had a wonderful Influence, and could not con∣tain <MILESTONE N="40"/> himself from speaking maliciously and wickedly against the King, when dissimulation was at the highest amongst the great Officers. This Man grew into great familiarity with <HI>Osborne,</HI> and knowing from what Person he came recommended to that Trust, could not doubt but that he was well inclined to any thing that might advance him; and so, ac∣cording to his custom of reviling the King, he wished <Q>“he were out of the world; for they should never make any settlement whilst He was alive. He said, he was sure the Army wish'd him dead, and that <HI>Ham∣mond</HI> had receiv'd many Letters from the Army to take him away by Poyson, or any other way; but he saw it would never be done in that <MILESTONE N="50"/> place; and therefore, if he would joyn with him, they would get him” from thence; and then the work would easily be done.</Q> <HI>Osborne</HI> asked him, <Q>“how it could be possible to remove him from thence, without”
<PB N="179" REF="1990"/>
<HI>Hammond</HI>'s, or the King's own consent?</Q> <HI>Rolph</HI> Answer'd, <Q>“that the King might be decoyed from thence, as he was from <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, by some Letters from his Friends, of some danger that threaten'd him, upon which he would be willing to make an Escape; and then he might” easily be dispatched.</Q> <HI>Osborne</HI> shortly found an opportunity to inform the King of all this.</P>
<P><Q>THE King bid him “continue his familiarity with <HI>Rolph,</HI> and to pro∣mise <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Attemps for the King's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scape.</NOTE> to joyn with him in contriving how his Majesty should make an” Escape;</Q> and he hoped thereby to make <HI>Rolph</HI>'s Villainy the means of getting away. He recommended one of the Common Soldiers to <HI>Osborne,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> <Q>“”who, he said,</Q> <Q>“”he thought, might be trusted;</Q> and wish'd him <Q>“to trust” one <HI>Doucet;</HI></Q> whom the King had known before, and who was then placed to wait upon him at his back staires, and was indeed an honest Man; for it was impossible for him to make an Escape, without the privity of such Persons, who might provide for him, when he was got out of the Castle, as well as help him from thence. <Q><HI>Osborne</HI> told <HI>Rolph,</HI> “he was confident he should in the end perswade the King to attempt an Escape, though he yet seem'd jealous and apprehensive of being dis∣cover'd,” and taken again.</Q> <HI>Doucet</HI> concurr'd very willingly in it, and the Soldier who was chosen by the King, prov'd likewise very honest, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and wrought upon one or two of his Companions who used to stand Sen∣tinels at the place where the King intended to get out. All things were provided; and the King had a File, and Saw; with which he had, with wonderful trouble, sawed an Iron Bar in the Window, by which he could be able to get out; and being in this readiness, the night was ap∣pointed, and <HI>Osborne</HI> at the place where he was to receive the King. But one of the Soldiers inform'd <HI>Rolph</HI> of more particulars than <HI>Osborne</HI> had done, by which he concluded that he was false, and directed the Soldier to proceed, and stand Sentinel in the same place to which he had been assign'd; and he, and some others trusted by him, were arm'd, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> stood very near with their Pistols. At midnight the King came to the Window, resolving to go out; but as he was putting himself out, he discern'd more Persons to stand thereabout than used to do, and there∣upon suspected that there was some discovery made; and so shut the Window, and retired to his bed. And this was all the ground of a dis∣course,. which then flew abroad, as if the King had got half out at the Window, and could neither draw his Body after, nor get his Head back, and so was compelled to call out for help; which was a meer fiction.</P>
<P>ROLPH acquainted <HI>Hammond</HI> with what the King had design'd; who presently went into his Chamber, and sound the King in his bed, <MILESTONE N="40"/> but the Bar of the Window cut in two, and taken out; by which he concluded his information to be true; and presently seised upon <HI>Doucet,</HI> but could not apprehend <HI>Osborne;</HI> who was either fled out of the Island, or concealed in it that he could not be found. <HI>Rolph</HI> could not forbear to insult upon <HI>Doucet</HI> in Prison, and scornfully asked him, <Q>“why his” King came not sorth when he was at the Window?</Q> and said, <Q>“he was” ready with a good Pistol charged to have receiv'd him.</Q> When <HI>Osborne</HI> had got into a place of present safety, he writ a Letter to his Patron the Lord <HI>Wharton,</HI> informing him of the whole matter; and desired him, <Q>“to acquaint the House of Peers of the design upon the King's Life,” <NOTE PLACE="marg">Osborne <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Rolph <HI>for a design upon the King's Life</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> and that he would be ready to appear and justify the Conspiracy.</Q> That Lord, after he had kept the Letter some time, sent it to <HI>Hammond,</HI> as the fittest Person to examine the truth of the Relation. <HI>Osborne</HI> was
<PB N="180" REF="2000"/>
not discouraged with all this; but sent two Letters to the Speakers o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both Houses, and inclosed the Letter he had formerly writ to the Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Wharton.</HI> In the House of Commons the information was slighted and laid aside; but it made more impression upon the House of Peers who sent, with more than ordinary earnestness, to the Commons, <Q>“that <HI>Rolph</HI> might be sent for, and a Safe-guard for forty days to <HI>Osborne”</HI> to appear, and prosecute.</Q></P>
<P>ROLPH brought with him a large Testimonial from <HI>Hammond</HI> of <Q>“”his Integrity, and of the many good Services he had done to the State.</Q> <HI>Osborne</HI> appear'd likewise at the Lords Bar, and made good upon Oath all that is before set down, and undertook to produce other Evidence. The House of Commons had no mind to have it examin'd farther, but the clamour of the People was so great, that, after many delays, they Voted <Q>“”that it should be tryed at the General Assizes at <HI>Winchester.</HI></Q> And thither they sent their well tryed Serjeant <HI>Wild,</HI> to be the sole Judge of that Circuit; before whom the Major part of the same Jury that had found Captain <HI>Burly</HI> guilty, was impannell'd for the Tryal of <HI>Rolph. Osborne,</HI> and <HI>Doucet,</HI> who upon Bail had liberty to be there, appear'd to make good the Indictment; and, upon their Oaths, declared all that <HI>Rolph</HI> had said to them, as is set down before. The Prisoner, <MILESTONE N="$$"/> if he may be called a Prisoner who was under no restraint, had two Lawyers assign'd to be of Council with him, contrary to the Law and Custom in those Cases; but he needed not to have had any Council but the Judge himself; who told the Jury, <Q>“that it was a business of great importance that was before them; and therefore that they should take heed what they did in it: that there Was a time indeed when Inten∣tions and Words were Treason, but God forbid it should be so now: how did any body know but that those two Men, <HI>Osborne</HI> and <HI>Doucet,</HI> would have made away the King, and that <HI>Rolph</HI> charged his Pistol to preserve him? or, perhaps, they would have carried him away to have” <MILESTONE N="30"/> engaged them in a second War.</Q> <Q>He told them, “they were mistaken who did believe the King in Prison; the Parliament did only keep him” safe to save the shedding of more Blood.</Q> Upon these good directions, the Grand Jury found an <HI>Ignoramus</HI> upon the Bill; and this was some little time before the Treaty.</P>
<P>WHEN the Commissioners who had treated with the King at the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commis∣sioner's Report of the Treaty to the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> were return'd to the Parliament, their report took up many days in the House of Commons, where the resolution was first to be taken; which commonly was final, the Lords rarely presuming to contradict what the others thought fit to determine. <Q>The Question upon <MILESTONE N="$$"/> the whole was, “whether the Answer that the King had made to their” <NOTE PLACE="marg">A long and sharp Debate upon it.</NOTE> Propositions, was satisfactory?</Q> which was debated with all the viru∣lence, and acrimony towards each other, that can fall from Men so possessed as both sides were.</P>
<P>YOUNG S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane</HI> had begun the Debate with the highest In∣solence, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Harry Vane<HI>'s Speech concerning it.</HI></NOTE> and Provocation; <Q>telling them, “that they should that day know and discover, who were their Friends, and who were their Foes; or, that he might speak more plainly, who were the King's Party in” the House, and who were for the People;</Q> and so proceeded with his usual grave bitterness against the Person of the King, and the Govern∣ment <MILESTONE N="50"/> that had been too long settled; put them in mind, <Q>“that they had been diverted from their old settled Resolution and Declaration, that they would make no more Addresses to the King; after which the

Kingdom had been govern'd in great Peace, and begun to tast the sweet of that Republican Government which they intended and begun to establish, when, by a Combination between the City of <HI>London</HI> and an ill affected Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with some small contemptible Insur∣rections in <HI>England,</HI> all which were fomented by the City, the Houses had, by clamour and noise, been induced and compelled to reverse their former Votes and Resolution, and enter into a Personal Treaty with the King; with whom they had not been able to prevail, not∣withstanding the low condition he was in, to give them any security; but he had still reserv'd a power in himself, or at least to his Posterity, <MILESTONE N="10"/> to exercise as Tyrannical a Government as he had done: that all the Insurrections, which had so terrified them, were now totally subdued; and the principal Authors and Abettors of them in their Custody, and ready to be brought to Justice, if they pleased to direct, and appoint it: that their Enemies in <HI>Scotland</HI> were reduced, and that Kingdom entirely devoted to a firm and good correspondence with their Bre∣thren, the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> so that there was nothing wanting, but their own consent and resolution, to make themselves the hap∣piest Nation and People in the world; and to that purpose desired, that they might, without any more loss of time, return to their for∣mer <MILESTONE N="20"/> resolution of making no more Addresses to the King; but pro∣ceed to the settling the Government without him, and to the severe punishment of those who had disturbed their peace and quiet, in such an exemplary manner, as might terrify all other Men for the future” from making the like bold attempts: which, he told them,</Q> <Q>“they might see would be most grateful to their Army, which had merited” so much from them by the Remonstrance they had so lately publish'd.</Q></P>
<P>THIS discourse appear'd to be exceedingly disliked, by that kind of Murmur which usually shews how the House stands inclined, and by which Men make their judgements there, of the success that is like to <MILESTONE N="30"/> be. And his Preface, and Entrance into the Debate, were taken notice of with equal sharpness; and, <Q>“his presumption in taking upon himself to divide the House, and to censure their Affections to the Publick, as” their sense and judgement should agree,</Q> or disagree with his own. <Q>One said, “that since he had, without Example, taken so much upon him, he was not to take it ill, if the contrary was assumed by other Men; and that it was as lawful for another Man, who said he was no gainer by the Troubles, to make another Division of the House, and to say, that they should find in the Debate of that day, that there were some who were desirous of Peace; and that They were all losers, or, at least, no <MILESTONE N="40"/> gainers by the War; and that others were against Peace; and that They by the War had gained large Revenues, and great Sums of Money, and much Wealth; and therefore his Motion was, that the Gainers might contribute to the Losers, if they would not consent that the one might enjoy what was left, and the other possess what they had” got, by a Peace that might be happy for both.</Q></P>
<P>WHILST this was debating in the House, which continued several <NOTE PLACE="marg">The large Re∣monstrance of the Army brought to the House by six Officers</NOTE> days, six Officers, from the head Quarters at <HI>Windsor,</HI> whither the Army had been brought before, or at the time when the Treaty ended at the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> brought their large Remonstrance to the House; in which <MILESTONE N="50"/> they desired, <Q>“that there might be no farther proceedings upon the Treaty; but that they would return to their former determination of no farther Addresses, and make what hast they could in settling the
<PB N="182" REF="2020"/>
Government: that the bargaining Proposition on the behalf of Delin∣quents, which was only upon a Contract with the King, and not in any Judicial way, might be laid aside; and that publick Justice might be done upon the principal Actors in the late Troubles, and that others, upon a true submission, might find Mercy: that a peremptory day might be set, when the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> should be required to appear; which if they should not do, they should stand exiled as Traitors; and if they should appear, yet they should be bound to make some satisfaction: that an end might be put to this Parlia∣ment, and a new Representative chosen of the People, for the go∣verning <MILESTONE N="10"/> and preserving the whole Body of the Nation. That no King might be hereafter admitted but upon Election of the People, and as upon trust for the People, who should be likewise limited and restrain'd” by the Representative,</Q> with many other impracticable Particulars, which troubled the Parliament the less for their incoherence, and im∣possibility to be reduced into practice.</P>
<P>BUT that which troubled most, and indeed which awaken'd them to the most dismal apprehensions, was, that they were advertised, that the King was taken away from <HI>Carisbrooke</HI> Castle by an Officer of the Ar∣my, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King taken from</HI> Carisbrooke <HI>Castle and carried to</HI> Hurst <HI>Castle.</HI></NOTE> and carried to <HI>Hurst</HI> Castle, not far from the other, but Situated <MILESTONE N="$$"/> on the main Land, and in so vile and unwholesome an Air, that the Common Guards there used to be frequently changed for the preserva∣tion of their health. Colonel <HI>Hammond</HI> had, before the expiration of the Treaty, writ many Letters to the Parliament, to be discharged from that Government, and from the care of the King's Person; and the Of∣ficers of the Army seem'd wonderfully offended with him for making the demand; and he got himself looked upon as under a Cloud. But the Treaty was no sooner ended (and before the Commissioners begun their Report to the Houses) but he was discharged of the Trust of the Person of the King, and another Colonel sent to take the Person of <MILESTONE N="30"/> the King, and to carry him to <HI>Hurst</HI> Castle.</P>
<P>THIS News being brought when they were in the heat of the Debate upon the King's Answer, they gave over that contest, and immediately Voted, <Q>“that the seising upon the King's Person, and carrying him Pri∣soner” <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vote of the House of Com∣mons there∣upon.</NOTE> to <HI>Hurst</HI> Castle,</Q> was without Their advice and consent: which Vote had little contradiction, because no Man would own the Advice. Then they caused a Letter to be written to the General, <Q>“that the Or∣ders” and Instructions to Colonel <HI>Ewre</HI></Q> (the Officer who had seised the King) <Q>“were contrary to their Resolutions, and Instructions to Colonel <HI>Hammond;</HI> and therefore, that it was the pleasure of the House, that <MILESTONE N="40"/> he should recal those Orders; and that Colonel <HI>Hammond</HI> should” again resume the care of the King's Person.</Q> But the General, without taking any notice of their Complaint, or of their Command, demanded the payment of the Arrears due to the Army; and told them, <Q>“that, unless there were present Money sent to that purpose, he should be” forced to remove the Army,</Q> and to draw them nearer to <HI>London.</HI> And at the same time a new Declaration was sent to the House from <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another De∣claration of the Army sent to the House.</NOTE> the Army, in pursuance of their late Remonstrance; which the House refused to take into consideration; and some sturdy Members moved, <Q>“that the Army might be declared Traitors, if they presumed to march <MILESTONE N="50"/> nearer <HI>London</HI> than they were at present; and that an impeachment” of High Treason might be drawn up against the principal Officers of it.</Q> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The General marches for</HI> London</NOTE> Hereupon, the General marches directly for <HI>London,</HI> and quarters at
<PB N="183" REF="2030"/>
<HI>White-Hall;</HI> the other Officers, with their Troops, in <HI>Durham</HI> House, the <HI>Mues, Covent</HI> Garden, <HI>Westminster,</HI> and S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s; and for the present necessity, that no inconvenience might fall out, they sent to the City without delay to supply forty thousand pounds, to be imme∣diately issued out to satisfy the Army. <Q>Notwithstanding all which mon∣strous proceeding, the House of Commons retained its Courage, and were resolute “to assert the Treaty; and that the King's Answers were satisfactory; or if they were not fully satisfactory, that the House might, and ought to accept thereof, and proceed to the settlement of Peace in Church and State, rather than to reject them as unsatisfactory,” <MILESTONE N="10"/> and thereby continue the Kingdom in War and Distraction.</Q></P>
<P>THEY who vehemently pressed this Conclusion, and would be thought to be for the King, to make themselves popular, took upon them to make all the Invectives both against the King, and all the time of his Government, that his bitterest Enemies could do, only that they might shew how much the concessions he had now granted, had provided Re∣medies for all those Evils, and made all the foundation of their future hope of happiness and peace, to be in the no-power they had left him in: so that if he should have a mind to continue the Distractions to mor∣row, he would find no Body ready ever to joyn with him, having at <MILESTONE N="20"/> this time sacrificed all his Friends to the Mercy of their mortal Ene∣mies. In conclusion, and when they had prosecuted the Debate most part of the Night, till allmost five of the Clock in the Morning, on <HI>Munday</HI> Night, they had first put the Question, <Q>“whether the Question” should be put?</Q> and carried it by a hundred and forty Voices against one hundred and four: the main Question, <Q>“That the Answer of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><Q>Vote “that the King's Answer was a ground for” Peace.</Q></NOTE> King to the Propositions of both Houses was a ground for the Houses” to proceed upon for the settlement of the Peace of the Kingdom,</Q> was so clearly Voted, that the House was not divided; and that there might be no after-claps, <Q>they appointed a Committee “to confer with the Ge∣neral, <MILESTONE N="30"/> for the better procuring a good Intelligence and correspondence” between the Army and the Parliament;</Q> and then they Adjourn'd the House to <HI>Wednesday</HI> Morning, it being then near the Morning of <HI>Tuesday.</HI></P>
<P>THE Committee that was appointed to confer with the General, waited that Afternoon upon him in his Lodging at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> that they might be able to give some Account to the House the next Morn∣ing. But they were forced to attend full three hours, before they could be admitted to his presence; and then he told them sullenly, and su∣perciliously, <Q>“that the way to correspond with the Army, was to com∣ply” <MILESTONE N="40"/> with their Remonstrance:</Q> and, the next Morning, there was a Guard of Musqueteers placed at the entry into, and door of the House, and the Officers thereof having a List in their hands of the Names of those who should be restrain'd from going into the House, all Those <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many of the Members en∣tring into the House seised upon by the Soldiers.</NOTE> were stopped, one by one, as they came, and sent into the Court of Wards, where they were kept together for many hours, under a Guard, to the number of near one hundred. Notwithstanding which there were so many of the same opinion got into the House, through the inadver∣tency of the Guard, or because they meant only to sequester the most notorious and refractory Persons, that the Debate, upon resuming the <MILESTONE N="50"/> same Question, continued very long; several Members who observ'd the force at the entrance of the House, and saw their Companions not suffer'd to come in, complain'd loudly of the Violence and Breach of
<PB N="184" REF="2040"/>
Privilege, and demanded remedy; but, in vain; the House would take no notice of it. In the conclusion, after a very long Debate, the Major part of those who were present in the House, Voted the Negative to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The remaining Members Vote the contrary to former Votes.</NOTE> what had been settled in the former Debate, and <Q>“that the Answer the” King had given to their Propositions was not satisfactory.</Q></P>
<P>THOSE Gentlemen who for some hours had been restrain'd in the Court of Wards, were afterwards led in triumph through <HI>Westminster-</HI>Hall (except some few, who were suffer'd for affection, or by negligence, to go away) by a strong Guard, to that place under the Exchequer which is commonly called <HI>Hell;</HI> where they might eat and drink, at <MILESTONE N="10"/> their own charge, what they pleased. And here they were kept in one room, till after twelve of the Clock in the Night: after which hour, in respect of the extreme cold Weather, and the Age of many of the Mem∣bers, they were carried to several Inns; where they were suffer'd to lodge as Prisoners, and remain'd under that confinement for two or three days. In which time, they published a Protestation in Print against the Proceedings of the House of Commons, declaring <Q>“the force and vio∣lence” that had been used against them:</Q> and then the House, with the remaining Members, having determin'd what they thought fit, most of the other were at liberty to do what they pleased. No body own'd this <MILESTONE N="20"/> Act of Violence in the Exclusion of so many Members: there was no Order made for it by the House. <HI>Fairfax</HI> the General knew nothing of it, and the Guards themselves being asked <Q>“”what Authority they had, gave no other Answer,</Q> <Q>“”but that they had Orders.</Q> But afterwards there <NOTE PLACE="marg"><Q>Vote, “that those who were absent at the Ne∣gative Vote should sit no more in the” House.</Q></NOTE> was a full and clear Order of the House, without taking notice of any exclusion, <Q>“that none of them who had not been present that day when the Negative Vote prevailed, should sit any more in the House, be∣fore they had first subscribed the same Vote, as agreeable to their judge∣ments; which if they subscribed, they were as well qualified Mem∣bers” as before.</Q> Many of these excluded Members, out of Conscience <MILESTONE N="30"/> or Indignation, forbore coming any more to the House for many years; some, not before the Revolution; others, sooner or later, return'd to their old Seates, that they might not be idle when so much business was to be done.</P>
<P>THEN the House renew'd their old Votes of no more Addresses, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vote of no more Ad∣dresses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> annull'd and made void all those which introduced the Treaty: and that they might find no more such contradiction hereafter, they committed to several Prisons Major General <HI>Brown</HI> (though he was then Sheriff of <HI>London)</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Clotworthy,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Waller,</HI> Major General <HI>Massey,</HI> and Commissary General <HI>Copley,</HI> who were the most active Members in <MILESTONE N="40"/> the House of the Presbyterian Party, and who had all as maliciously ad∣vanced the Service of the Parliament in their several Stations against the King as any Men of their Rank in the Kingdom, and much more than any Officer of the present Army had then credit to do: of these, <HI>Massey</HI> made his escape, and transported himself into <HI>Holland;</HI> and there, according to the natural modesty of that Sect, presented himself to the Prince, with as much confidence (and as a Sufferer for the King his Father) as if he had defended <HI>Colchester.</HI></P>
<P>THE Protestation that the secluded Members had published and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Protesta∣tion of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mem∣bers.</NOTE> caused to be printed, with the Narrative of the violence that had been <MILESTONE N="50"/> exercised upon them, and their declaring all Acts to be void which from that time had been done in the House of Commons, made a great noise over the Kingdom, and no less incensed those who remain'd and
<PB N="185" REF="2050"/>
sate in the House, than it did the Officers of the Army; and therefore, to lessen the credit of it, the House likewise made a Declaration against that Protestation; and declared it, <Q>“to be false, scandalous, and seditious, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Voted against by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Houses</NOTE> and tending to the destruction of the visible and Fundamental Govern∣ment” of the Kingdom:</Q> and to this wonderful Declaration they ob∣tain'd the concurrence of the small House of Peers, and joyntly ordain'd, <Q>“that that Protestation should be suppressed, and that no Man should” presume to sell, or buy, or to read the same.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN they had in this manner master'd all contradiction and oppo∣sition, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Votes of the House of Com¦mons</NOTE> they begun more directly to consult what they were to do, as <MILESTONE N="10"/> well as what they were Not to do, and to establish some Affirmative conclusions, as they had done Negatives. <Q>They were told, “that it was high time to settle some form of Government, under which the Na∣tion was to live: there had been much Treasure and Blood spent to re∣cover the liberty of the People, which would be to no purpose if there were not provision made for their secure enjoying it; and there would be allways the same attempts made, which had been of late, to disturb and to destroy the publick Peace, if there were not such exemplary penalties inflicted, as might terrify all Men, of what con∣dition” soever, from entring upon such desperate Undertakings.</Q> They <MILESTONE N="20"/> resolv'd to gratify the Army, by taking a view of a Paper formerly di∣gested by them as a model for a new Government, which was called <HI>the Agreement of the People,</HI> and for contriving and publishing where∣of, one of the Agitators had been, by <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s directions, the year before, shot to death, when he found the Parliament was so much of∣fended with it. They declared now, as the most popular thing they could do to please both the People and the Army, <Q>“that they would put an end to the Parliament on the last day of <HI>April</HI> next; and that there should be a Representative of the Nation, consisting of three hundred Persons chosen by the People; of which, for the Term of <MILESTONE N="30"/> seven years, no Person who had adher'd to the King, or who should oppose this Agreement, or not Subscribe thereunto, should be capa∣ble of being chosen to be one, or to have a voice in the Election; and that, before that time, and before the Dissolution of the present Par∣liament, it would be necessary to bring those signal Delinquents, who had lately disturbed the quiet and Peace of the Kingdom, and put it to so great an expence of Blood and Treasure, to exemplary punish∣ment. And it was with great impudence very vehemently urged, that they ought to begin with Him who had been the cause of all the miseries, and mischiefs, which had befallen the Kingdom, and whom <MILESTONE N="40"/> they had allready devested of all Power and Authority to govern them for the future; and they had had near two years experience, that the Nation might be very happily govern'd without any recourse to him: that they had already declared, and the House of Peers had con∣curr'd with them, that the King had been the cause of all the Blood which had been spilt; and therefore, that it was fit that such a Man of Blood should be brought to Justice, that he might undergo the pe∣nalty that was due to his Tyranny and Murthers: that the People expected This at their hands; and that having the principal Male∣factor in their power, he might not escape the punishment that was” <MILESTONE N="50"/> due to him.</Q></P>
<P>HOW new and monstrous soever this language and discourse was to all <HI>English</HI> Ears, they found a Major part still to concur with them:
<PB N="186" REF="2060"/>
so that they appointed a Committee for the present <Q>“to prepare a charge <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee appointed by them to pre¦pare a Charge against the King.</NOTE> of High Treason against the King, which should contain the several Crimes, and Misdemeanours of his Reign; which being made, they would consider of the best way and manner of Proceeding, that he” might be brought to Justice.</Q></P>
<P>THIS manner of proceeding in <HI>England</HI> was so unheard of, that it was very hard for any Body to propose any way to oppose it that might carry with it any hope of success. However, the pain the Prince was in, would not suffer him to rest without making some effort. He knew too well how far the States of <HI>Holland</HI> were from wishing that success, and honour to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> as it had deserv'd from them, and how much they had allways favour'd the Rebellion; that his own pre∣sence was in no degree acceptable or grateful to them; and that they were devising allways how they might be rid of him: yet he believ'd the way they were now upon in <HI>England,</HI> would be so universally odious to all Christians, that no Body of Men would appear to favour it. His Highness therefore sent to the States General, to desire them <Q>“to give <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>desires the States to intercede with the two Houses.</HI></NOTE> him an Audience the next day; and that he would come to the place” where they sate;</Q> which he did, being met by the whole Body at the bottom of the Stairs, and conducted into the Room where they sate. <MILESTONE N="$$"/></P>
<P>THE Prince was attended by four or five of his Council; and when he had said a little to the States of Complement, he referr'd them to a paper which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Boswell,</HI> the King's Resident there, was to de∣liver to them. The paper described the ill condition the King his Father was in; and the threats and menaces which his Enemies used to pro∣ceed against him in such a manner as must be abominated by all Chri∣stians, and which would bring the greatest reproach and obloquy upon the Protestant Religion, that ever Christianity had undergone: And therefore desired them, <Q>“that they would interpose their credit, and authority, in such a manner as they thought fit, with the two Houses <MILESTONE N="30"/> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> that, instead of such an unlawful and wicked prose∣cution, they would enter into Terms of accommodation with his Royal Father; for the observation whereof his Royal Highness would be∣come” bound.</Q></P>
<P>THE States assured his Highness, <Q>“that they were very much af∣flicted <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Answer.</NOTE> at the condition of the King, and would be glad any interpo∣sition of Theirs might be able to relieve him; that they would seriously” consider in what manner they might serve him.</Q> And, that day, they resolv'd to send an extraordinary Embassadour into <HI>England,</HI> who should repair to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and receive his Instructions to what Friends <MILESTONE N="40"/> of the King's he should resort, and consult with; who, being upon the place, might best inform him to whom to apply himself. And they made choice of <HI>Paw,</HI> the Pensioner of <HI>Holland,</HI> for their Embassadour; who immediately attended the Prince with the Offer of his Service, and many professions of his desire that his Journey might produce some good Effect.</P>
<P>THE Council that was about the Prince, had looked upon <HI>Paw</HI> as a Man that had allways favour'd the Rebellion in <HI>England,</HI> and as much obstructed all Civilities from the States towards the King, as was possi∣ble for him to do; and therefore they were very sorry that He was made <MILESTONE N="50"/> choice of for Embassadour in such a fatal conjuncture. But the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> assured the Prince, <Q>“that he had used all his credit to com∣pass that Election; that he was the Wisest Man of their Body; and
<PB N="187" REF="2070"/>
that neither He, nor any of the rest, who had cherished the <HI>English</HI> Rebellion more than he, ever desired it should prosper to that degree it had done, as to endanger the changing the Government; and there∣fore” wished</Q> <Q>“there might not appear any distrust of him, but that the Prince would treat him with confidence, and some of the Coun∣cil would confer with him with freedom, upon any particulars which” it would be necessary for him to be instructed in.</Q> But the wisdom of Angels was not sufficient to give any effectual advice for such a Nego∣tiation, since the States could not be brought so much to interest them∣selves, as to use any Menaces to the Parliament as if they would em∣bark <MILESTONE N="10"/> themselves in the quarrel. <Q>So that the Council could only wish, “that the Embassadour would confer with such of the King's Friends who were then at <HI>London,</HI> and whose relation had been most eminent towards his Majesty; and receive advice from them, how he might most hopefully prevail over particular Men, and thereby with the” Parliament.</Q> And so the Embassadour departed for <HI>England,</HI> within <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They send an Embassadour into</HI> England.</NOTE> less than a week after he was nominated for the Employment.</P>
<P>AT the same time, the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> being struck to the heart with amazement and confusion upon the report of what the Parliament intended, sent a Paper to the Agent who was employed there by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen sent a Paper to be deliver'd to the Parlia∣ment, but it was laid aside.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"/> Cardinal to keep a good correspondence; which she obliged him to de∣liver to the Parliament. The Paper contain'd a very passionate lamen∣tation of the sad condition the King her Husband was in; desiring <Q>“that they would grant her a Pass to come over to him, offering to use all the credit she had with him, that he might give them satisfaction. However, if they would not give her leave to perform any of those Offices towards the Publick, that she might be permitted to perform the Duty she owed Him, and to be near him in the uttermost Extre∣mity.”</Q> Neither of these Addresses did more than express the Zeal of those who procured them to be made: the Embassadour <HI>Paw</HI> could nei∣ther <MILESTONE N="30"/> get leave to see the King (which he was to endeavour to do, that he might from himself be instructed best what to do) nor be admitted to an Audience by the Parliament, till after the Tragedy was acted: and the Queen's Paper was deliver'd, and never consider'd in order to return any Answer to it.</P>
<P>WHEN the Committee had prepared such a Charge, which they <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Charge against the King approv'd by the Com∣mons▪</NOTE> called <Q>“an Impeachment of High Treason against <HI>Charles Stewart</HI> King” of <HI>England,</HI></Q> digested into several Articles, which contain'd all those Calumnies they had formerly heaped up in that Declaration of no more Addresses to be made to him, with some Additional Reproaches, it was <MILESTONE N="40"/> read in the House; and, after it was approv'd there, they sent it to the House of Peers for Their concurrence. That House had very little to do from the time that <HI>Cromwell</HI> return'd from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and were few in Number, and used to Adjourn for two or three days together for want of business; so that it was believ'd, that they who had done so many extravagant things, rather than they would dissent from the House of Commons, would likewise concur with them in This, rather than sever from them when they were so triumphant. But, contrary to this expectation, when this Impeachment was brought up to the Peers, it was so ill receiv'd, that there was not one Person who concurr'd <MILESTONE N="50"/> with them; which, considering the Men and what most of them had done, might seem very strange. And when they had, with some warmth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejected by the Lords; who adjourn'd for a week.</NOTE> rejected it, they Adjourn'd for a week; presuming they should thereby
<PB N="188" REF="2080"/>
at least give some interruption to that Career which the House of Com∣mons was upon, and, in that time, some expedient might be found to reconcile the Proceedings in both Houses. But they were as much de∣ceiv'd in this; the House of Commons was very well pleased with it, and thought they had given them ease, which they could not so well have contriv'd for themselves. So they proceeded in their own Method, and when the day came to which the Lords had Adjourn'd their House, they found their doors all locked, and fasten'd with Padlocks, that there <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Door of their House locked up a∣gainst the day to which they had adjourn'd</NOTE> should then be no more Entrance for them; nor did any of them ever after sit in that House as Peers above twice or thrice at most, till <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> long after, endeavour'd in vain to have erected a House of Peers of his own Creation; in which some of them then very willingly took their places.</P>
<P>THE Charge and Accusation, upon which they resolv'd to proceed against the King, being thus settled and agreed upon, they begun to consider in what manner and form to proceed, that there might be some appearance of Justice. Nothing could be found in the Common or Sta∣tute-Law, which could direct or warrant them; nor could the Pre∣cedent of deposing <HI>Richard</HI> the second (the sole Precedent of that kind) be applied to their purpose: for, how foul soever the circumstances pre∣cedent <MILESTONE N="20"/> had been, he had made a Resignation of his Royalty before the Lords in Parliament; so that his Deposition proceeded from Himself, and with his own Consent, and would not agree in any particular with the case in question. They were therefore to make a new form to war∣rant their Proceedings: and a new form they did erect, never before heard of. They constituted and erected a Court that should be called <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons constitute a High Court of Justice.</NOTE> <Q><HI>“the High Court of Justice,</HI> to consist of so many Judges, who should have Authority to try the King, whether he were guilty of what he was accused of, or no; and, in order thereunto, to examine such Wit∣nesses” as should be produced: the Number of the Judges named was <MILESTONE N="30"/> about an hundred and fifty, whereof the Major part might proceed.</Q></P>
<P>THEY could not have found such a number yet amongst themselves, after so many barbarities and impieties, upon whom they might depend in this last Tragical Act. And therefore they laid this for a ground; that if they should make only their own Members to be Judges in this case, they might appear in the Eyes of the People to be too much par∣ties, as having from the beginning maintain'd a War, though defensive, as they pretended, against the King, and so not so fit to be the only Judges who were in the fault: on the other hand, if they should name none of themselves, it might be interpreted that they looked upon it <MILESTONE N="40"/> as too dangerous a Province to engage themselves in, and therefore they had put it off to others; which would discourage others from under∣taking it. Wherefore they resolv'd, that the Judges should be nomi∣nated promiscuously, as well of Members of the House, as of such other of their good and Godly Men in the Kingdom. Whosoever would not be one himself when named, as there were yet many amongst them, who, out of Conscience, or of Fear, utterly protested against it, should take upon him to name another Man; which sure he could not but think was equally unlawful: So that few took upon them to nominate others, who would reject the Province themselves. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>ALL the Chief Officers of the Army were named, and divers accepted the Office; and such Aldermen and Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> as had been most violent against Peace, and some few Country Gentlemen, whose
<PB N="189" REF="2090"/>
Zeal had been taken notice of for the Cause, and who were like to take such a Preferment as a testimony of the Parliament's confidence in them, and would thereupon embrace it. When such a Number of Men were nominated as were thought in all respects to be equal to the work, they were to make choice of a Speaker, or Prolocutor, who should be called <HI>Lord President</HI> of that High Court, who must manage and govern all the proceedings there, ask the Witnesses all proper Questions, and an∣swer what the Prisoner should propose. And to that Office one <HI>Brad∣shaw</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bradshaw <HI>made Lord President.</HI></NOTE> was chosen, a Lawyer of <HI>Grays-Inn,</HI> not much known in <HI>West∣minster-</HI>Hall, though of good practice in his Chamber, and much em∣ployed <MILESTONE N="10"/> by the Factious. He was a Gentleman of an ancient Family in <HI>Cheshire</HI> and <HI>Lancashire,</HI> but of a Fortune of his own making. He was not without parts, and of great insolence and ambition. When he was first nominated, he seem'd much surprised, and very resolute to refuse it; which he did in such a manner, and so much enlarging upon his own want of abilities to undergo so important a Charge, that it was very evident he had expected to be put to that Apology. <Q>And when he was press'd with more importunity than could have been used by chance, he required “”time to consider of it;</Q> <Q>and said, “he would then give his” final Answer; which he did, the next day;</Q> and with great Humility <MILESTONE N="20"/> accepted the Office, which he administer'd with all the pride, impudence, and superciliousness imaginable. He was presently invested in great State, and many Officers, and a Guard assign'd for the security of his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawyers and other Officers appointed.</NOTE> Person, and the Dean's House at <HI>Westminster</HI> given to him for ever for his residence and habitation, and a good Sum of Money, about five thousand pounds, was appointed to be presently paid to him, to put himself in such an Equipage and way of living, as the dignity of the Office which he held would require. And now, the Lord President of the High Court of Justice, seem'd to be the greatest Magistrate in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> <Q>And though it was not thought seasonable to make any such De∣claration, <MILESTONE N="30"/> yet some of those whose opinions grew quickly into Ordi∣nances, upon several occasions, declared, “that they believ'd that Of∣fice was not to be looked upon as necessary <HI>pro hac vice</HI> only, but for continuance; and that he who executed it, deserv'd to have an ample” and a liberal Estate conferr'd upon him for ever: which suddain mu∣tation and exaltation of fortune, could not but make a great impression upon a vulgar spirit, accustom'd to no Excesses, and acquainted only with a very moderate fortune.</Q> All this being done, they made choice of some Lawyers (till that time very obscure, and Men scarce known or heard of in their profession) to perform the Offices of Atturney Ge∣neral, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and Sollicitor General for the State, to prosecute the Prisoner at his Trial, and to manage the Evidence against him. Other Officers, of all kinds, were appointed to attend, and perform the several Offices of their new Court; which was ordered to be erected in <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall.</P>
<P>THE King was now sent for from <HI>Hurst</HI> Castle, and was receiv'd by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sent for from</HI> Hurst <HI>Castle by</HI> Har∣rison.</NOTE> Colonel <HI>Harrison</HI> with a strong Party of Horse; by whom he was to be conducted to <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle. <HI>Harrison</HI> was the Son of a Butcher near <HI>Nantwich</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and had been bred up in the place of a Clerk un∣der <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Character of</HI> Harrison.</NOTE> a Lawyer of good Account in those parts; which kind of Educa∣tion <MILESTONE N="50"/> introduces Men into the language and practice of Business, and, if it be not resisted by the great ingenuity of the Person, inclines young Men to more pride than any other kind of breeding; and disposes them
<PB N="190" REF="2100"/>
to be pragmatical and insolent, though they have the Skill to conceal it from their Masters, except they find them (as they are too often) inclined to cherish it. When the Rebellion first began, this Man quitted his Master (who had relation to the King's Service, and discharged his Duty faithfully) and put himself into the Parliament Army, where, having first obtain'd the Office of a Cornet, he got up, by diligence and sobriety, to the State of a Captain, without any signal notice taken of him till the new model of the Army; when <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who, possi∣bly, had knowledge of him before, found him of a spirit and disposition fit for his Service, much given to Prayer and to Preaching, and, other∣wise, <MILESTONE N="10"/> of an understanding capable to be trusted in any business; to which his Clerkship contributed very much: and then he was preferr'd very fast; so that, by the time the King was brought to the Army, he had been a Colonel of Horse, and looked upon as inferior to few, after <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> in the Council of Officers, and in the Govern∣ment of the Agitators; and there were few Men with whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> more communicated, or upon whom he more depended for the con∣duct of any thing committed to him. He receiv'd the King with out∣ward respect, kept himself bare; but attended him with great strictness; and was not to be approached by any Address; answering questions in <MILESTONE N="20"/> short and few words, and when importuned, with rudeness. He mani∣fested an apprehension that the King had some thought of making an Escape, and did all things in order to prevent it. Being to lodge at <HI>Windsor,</HI> and so to pass by <HI>Bagshot,</HI> the King expressed a desire to see his little Park at <HI>Bagshot,</HI> and so to dine at the Lodge there, a place where he had used to take much pleasure; and did not dissemble the knowing that the Lord <HI>Newburgh,</HI> who had lately Married the Lady <HI>Aubigney,</HI> liv'd there; and said, <Q>“he would send a Servant to let that Lady know that he would dine with her, that she might provide a” dinner for him.</Q> <HI>Harrison</HI> well knew the Affection of that Lord and <MILESTONE N="30"/> Lady, and was very unwilling he should make any stay there; but find∣ing the King so fixt upon it, that he would not be otherwise removed from it than by absolutely refusing him to go thither, he chose to con∣sent, and that his Majesty should send a Servant; which he did the night before he intended to dine there.</P>
<P>BOTH Lord and Lady were of known Duty and Affection to the King; the Lady, after her Husband the Lord <HI>Aubigney</HI> had been kill'd at <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> having so far incensed the Parliament, that she had endured a long imprisonment, under a suspicion that she had been privy to the design which had been discover'd by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Waller,</HI> upon which <HI>Tomkins</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> and <HI>Challoner</HI> had been put to death, and had likewise her self been put to death, if she had not made her Escape to <HI>Oxford.</HI> After the War was ended, she had, with the King's approbation, married the Lord <HI>Newburgh;</HI> who had the same Affections. They had, from the time of the King's being at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, concerted with his Majesty upon such means, that, in the strictest restraint he was under, they found a way to write to, and to hear from him. And most of the Letters which passed between the King and the Queen, passed through Their hands; who had likewise a Cipher with the King, by which they gave him no∣tice of any thing they judged of importance for him to know. <Q>They <MILESTONE N="50"/> had given him notice that he would be sent for from <HI>Hurst</HI> Castle, and advised him “to find some way, that he might dine at the Lodge at <HI>Bagshot;</HI> and that he should take occasion, if he could, to lame the
<PB N="191" REF="2110"/>
Horse he rode upon, or to find such fault with his going, that he might take another Horse out of the Lord <HI>Newburgh</HI>'s Stables to continue” the rest of his Journey upon.</Q> That Lord much delighted in Horses, and had, at that time, in his Stables one of the fleetest that was in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> and the purpose was, to mount the King upon that Horse, that, when he found a fit opportunity, he might, upon the suddain, set spurs to him; and if he could get out of the Company that encompassed him, he might, possibly, by the swiftness of his Horse, and his own skill in the most obscure ways of that Forrest, convey himself to an∣other place in their view; and so, three or four good Horses were laid <MILESTONE N="10"/> in several places. And this was the reason that the King had so earnest∣ly insisted upon dining at <HI>Bagshot;</HI> which being in his way, and his custom being allways to dine, they could not reasonably deny him that liberty.</P>
<P>BEFORE the King came thither, <HI>Harrison</HI> had sent some Horse with an Officer to search the House, and all about the Park, that he might be sure that no Company lurked, which might make some attempt. And the King, all the morning, found fault with the going of his Horse; and said, <Q>“”he would change it, and procure a better.</Q> When his Ma∣jesty <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King dines at the Lord</HI> Newburgh<HI>'s; where was a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> intention of making the King's Escape, but in vain.</HI></NOTE> came to the Lodge, he found his dinner ready, but was quickly in∣form'd, <MILESTONE N="20"/> <Q>“that the Horse, so much depended upon, was, the day before, by the blow of another Horse, so lamed, that he could not be of use to” the purpose he was design'd for.</Q> And though that Lord had other good Horses, which in such an exigent might be made use of, yet the King had observ'd so great difficulty to be in the attempt all his Journey, when he was encompass'd allways in the middle of a hundred Horse, the Officers all exceedingly well Horsed, and every Man, Officer, and Sol∣dier, having a Pistol ready spann'd in one hand, that he resolv'd not to pursue that design. And <HI>Harrison</HI> had already told him, <Q>“that he had” provided a better Horse for him: and it was believ'd he would never <MILESTONE N="30"/> have permitted him to have made use of one of the Lord <HI>Newburgh</HI>'s.</Q> So that after having spent three or four hours there, with very much satisfaction to himself, though he was not suffer'd to be in any Room without the Company of six or seven Soldiers, who suffer'd little to be spoken, except it was so loud that▪ They could hear it too, he took a sad farewel of them, appearing to have little hope ever to see them again. The Lord <HI>Newburgh</HI> rode some Miles in the Forrest to wait upon the King, till he was required by <HI>Harrison</HI> to return. His Majesty lodged that night at his Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and was soon after carried to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s. In this Journey, <HI>Harrison</HI> observing that the King had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King brought to S<SUP>t</SUP></HI> James<HI>'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"/> allways an apprehension that there was a purpose to Murther him, and had once let fall some words of <Q>“the odiousness and wickedness of such an Assassination and Murther, which could never be safe to the Person who” undertook it,</Q> he told him plainly, <Q>“that he needed not to enter∣tain any such imagination or apprehension; that the Parliament had” too much Honour and Justice to cherish so foul an intention;</Q> and as∣sured him, <Q>“that whatever the Parliament resolv'd to do, would be very Publick, and in a way of Justice; to which the world should be” Witness;</Q> and would never endure a thought of secret violence: which his Majesty could not perswade himself to believe; nor did imagine <MILESTONE N="50"/> that they durst ever produce him in the fight of the People, under any form whatsoever of a publick Trial.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="2120"/>
IT hath been acknowledged since by some Officers, and others who <NOTE PLACE="marg">The several Consultations, before and af∣ter this time, among the Of∣ficers, what to do with the King:</NOTE> were present at the consultations, that from the time of the King's be∣ing at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and after the Army had master'd both the Par∣liament and the City, and were weary of having the King with them, and knew not well how to be rid of him, there were many secret con∣sults what to do with him. And it was generally concluded, <Q>“they should never be able to settle their new form of Government, whilst” He liv'd: and after he was become a Prisoner in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI></Q> they were more sollicitous for a Resolution and Determination in that par∣ticular: and after the Vote of the no more Addresses, the most violent <MILESTONE N="10"/> Party thought <Q>“they could do nothing in order to their own ends, till He should be first dead; and therefore, one way or other, that was to” be compassed in the first place.</Q> Some were for <Q>“an actual deposing him; which could not but be easily brought to pass, since the Parlia∣ment would Vote any thing they should be directed: Others were for” the taking away his Life by Poyson;</Q> which would make least noise; or, <Q>“if that could not be so easily contrived, by Assassination; for which” there were hands enough ready to be employed.</Q> There was a Third sort, as violent as either of the other, <Q>who press'd “to have him brought” to a publick Trial as a Malefactor;</Q> which, they said, <Q>“would be most <MILESTONE N="20"/> for the honour of the Parliament, and would teach all Kings to know that they were accountable, and punishable for the wickedness of” their Lives.</Q></P>
<P>MANY of the Officers were of the first opinion, <Q>“as a thing they had Precedents for; and that he being once deposed, they could better settle the Government than if he were dead; for his Son could pretend no Right, whilst He was alive; whereas, if the Father were dead, he would presently call himself King, and others would call him so too; and, it may be, other Kings and Princes would own him for such. If he were kept alive in a close Prison, he might afterwards be made use” <MILESTONE N="30"/> of, or removed upon any appearance of a Revolution.</Q></P>
<P>THERE were as many Officers of the second Judgement, <Q>“that he” should be presently dispatch'd.</Q> <Q>They said, “it appear'd by the expe∣rience they had, that whilst He was alive (for a more strict imprison∣ment than he had undergone, he could never be confined to) there would be allways Plots and Designs to set him at liberty; and he would have Parties throughout the Kingdom; and, in a short time, a Faction in their most secret Councils, and it may be in the Army it self; and, where his liberty would yield so great a price, it would be too great a Trust to repose in any Man, that he would long resist the temptation. <MILESTONE N="40"/> Whereas, if he were confessedly dead, all those fears would be over; especially if they proceeded with that circumspection and severity to∣wards” all his Party, as in prudence they ought to do.</Q> This Party might probably have carried it, if <HI>Hammond</HI> could have been wrought upon to have concurr'd; but he had yet too much Conscience to expose him∣self to that infamy; and without His privity or connivance it could not be done.</P>
<P>THE third Party, which were all the Levellers and Agitators of the Army, in the head of which <HI>Ireton</HI> and <HI>Harrison</HI> were, would not en∣dure either of the other ways; and said, <Q>“they could as easily bring <MILESTONE N="$$"/> him to Justice in the sight of the Sun, as Depose him; since the Au∣thority of the Parliament could do one as well as the other: That their Precedent of Deposing, had no reputation with the People; but was
<PB N="193" REF="2130"/>
looked upon as the effect of some potent Faction, which allways op∣pressed the People more after, than they had been before. Besides, those Deposings had allways been attended with Assassinations and Murthers, which were the more odious, and detested, because no body own'd and avow'd the bloody Actions they had done. But if he were brought to a publick Trial, for the notorious ill things he had done, and for his misgovernment, upon the complaint and prosecution of the People, the Superiority of the People would be hereby vindicated and made manifest; and They should receive the benefit, and be for ever free from those oppressions which he had imposed upon them, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and for which he ought to pay so dear; and such an exemplary pro∣ceeding and execution as This, where every circumstance should be clear and notorious, would be the best foundation and security of the Government they intended to establish; and no Man would be ambi∣tious to succeed him, and be a King in his place, when he saw in” what manner he must be accountable to the People.</Q> This Argumen∣tation, or the strength and obstinacy of that Party, carried it: and, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Concluded to have him pub∣lickly tryed.</NOTE> hereupon, all that formality of proceeding, which afterwards was exer∣cised, was resolv'd upon and consented to.</P>
<P>WHETHER the incredibility, or monstrousness of such a kind of <MILESTONE N="20"/> proceeding, wrought upon the minds of Men, or whether the princi∣pal Actors took pains, by their Insinuations, to have it so believ'd, it fell out however that they among them who wish'd the King best, and stood nearest to the Stage where these parts were acted, did not believe that there were those horrid Intentions that shortly after appear'd. The Preachers, who had sounded the Trumpets loudest to, and throughout the War, preached now as furiously against all wicked attempts and vio∣lence against the Person of the King, and foolishly urged the obligation of the Covenant (by which they had involv'd him in all the danger he was in) for the security of his Person. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>ASSOON as the Prince heard of the King's being carried by <HI>Harri∣son</HI> to <HI>Windsor,</HI> and from thence to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s, though he had lately sent a Servant on purpose to see his Majesty, and to bring him an Ac∣count of the State he was in, which Servant was not permitted to see him, he sent now another with a Letter to <HI>Fairfax</HI> and the Council of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince sends a Letter to</HI> Fairfax <HI>and the Council of War:</HI></NOTE> War (for he knew the Parliament had no Authority) in which he told them, <Q>“that he had no other means to be inform'd of the health and condition of the King his Royal Father, but by the Common Prints, and general Intelligences that arriv'd in those parts: he had reason by those to believe, that after the expiration of the Treaty in the Isle of <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Wight</HI> (where he hoped the foundation for a happy Peace had been laid) his Majesty had been carried to <HI>Hurst</HI> Castle; and since, by some Officers of the Army, to <HI>Windsor,</HI> not without purpose of a more violent prosecution; the rumour whereof, though of so monstrous and incredible a nature, had called upon his Piety to make this Ad∣dress to them; who had at this time the power to choose, whether they would raise lasting Monuments to themselves of Loyalty and Piety, by restoring their Soveraign to his just Rights, and their Coun∣try to Peace and Happiness, a Glory which had been seldom absolute∣ly vouchsafed to so small a number of Men, or to make themselves <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Authors of endless misery to the Kingdom, by contributing or consenting to an Act which all Christians, into how different opinions soever divided, must abhor as the most inconsistent with the Elements
<PB N="194" REF="2140"/>
of any Religion, and destructive to the security and Being of any kind of Government: he did therefore earnestly desire and conjure them, sadly to consider the vast and prodigious disproportion in that” Election;</Q> and then, he said, <Q>“he could not doubt but that they would choose to do that which is most just, safe, and honourable for them to do; make themselves the blest Instruments to preserve, defend, and restore their King; to whom only their Allegiance was due; by which every one of them might justly promise themselves peace of Conscience, the singular good Will and Favour of his Majesty, the ample thanks and acknowledgement of all good Men, and the par∣ticular” and unalterable Affection of the Prince himself.</Q> This Letter was, with much ado, deliver'd into the hands of <HI>Fairfax</HI> himself; but the Messenger could never be admitted to speak with him; nor was there more known, than that it was read in the Council of War, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which was read in the Council of War, and laid aside.</NOTE> laid aside.</P>
<P>FROM the time of the King's being come to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s, when he was deliver'd into the hands and custody of Colonel <HI>Tomlinson,</HI> a Co∣lonel of Foot, though the Officer seem'd to be a Man of a better breed∣ing, and of a nature more civil than <HI>Harrison,</HI> and pretended to pay much Respect and Duty to the King in his outward Demeanour, yet his Majesty, after a short time, was treated with more rudeness and bar∣barity <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The usage of the King at S<SUP>t</SUP></HI> James<HI>'s.</HI></NOTE> than he had ever been before. They were so jealous of their own Guards, lest they should be wrought upon by the influence of this in∣nocent Prince, or by the remorse of their own Conscience upon the exercise of so much Barbarity, that they caused the Guards to be still changed; and the same Men were never suffer'd twice to perform the same monstrous Duty.</P>
<P>WHEN He was first brought to <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall, which was upon <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is brought to</HI> Westmin∣ster <HI>Hall,</HI> Jan. 20.</NOTE> the twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> before their <HI>High Court of Justice,</HI> he looked upon them, and sate down, without any manifestation of trouble, ne∣ver <MILESTONE N="30"/> stirring his Hat; all the impudent Judges sitting cover'd, and fixing their Eyes upon him, without the least shew of respect. The odious <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sum of his Charge.</NOTE> Libel, which they called a Charge and Impeachment, was then read by the Clerk; which, in effect, contain'd, <Q>“that he had been admitted King of <HI>England,</HI> and trusted with a limited power to govern accord∣ing to Law; and, by his Oath and Office, was obliged to use the power committed to him for the good and benefit of the People; but that he had, out of a wicked design to erect to himself an Illimited and Tyrannical power, and to overthrow the Rights and Liberties of the People, Trayterously levied War against the present Parliament, and” <MILESTONE N="40"/> the People therein represented.</Q> And then it mention'd his first ap∣pearance at <HI>York</HI> with a Guard, then his being at <HI>Beverly,</HI> then his setting up his Standard at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the day of the Month and the Year in which the Battle had been at <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> and all the other several Battles which had been fought in his presence; <Q>“”in which, it said,</Q> <Q>“he had caused and procured many thousands of the free-born People of the Nation to be slain: that after all his Forces had been defeated, and Himself become a Prisoner, he had, in that very year, caused ma∣ny Insurrections to be made in <HI>England,</HI> and given a Commission to the Prince his Son to raise a new War against the Parliament; where∣by <MILESTONE N="50"/> many who were in their Service, and trusted by them, had re∣volted, broken their Trust, and betook themselves to the Service of the Prince against the Parliament and the People: that he had been
<PB N="195" REF="2150"/>
the Author and Contriver of the unnatural, cruel, and bloody Wars; and was therein guilty of all the Treasons, Murthers, Rapines, Burn∣ings, and Spoiles, Desolations, Damage, and Mischief to the Nation, which had been committed in the said War, or been occasion'd there∣by; and that he was therefore impeached for the said Treasons, and Crimes, on the behalf of the People of <HI>England,</HI> as a Tyrant, Tray∣tor, and Murtherer, and a publick implacable Enemy to the Com∣mon-wealth” of <HI>England.</HI></Q> And it was prayed, <Q>“that he might be put to Answer to all the particulars, to the end that such an Examination, Trial, and Judgement, might be had thereupon, as should be agree∣able” <MILESTONE N="10"/> to Justice.</Q></P>
<P>WHICH being read, their President <HI>Bradshaw,</HI> after he had insolent∣ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">What pass'd the first day of his Trial.</NOTE> reprehended the King <Q>“for not having shew'd more respect to that” High Tribunal,</Q> told him, <Q>“that the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> had ap∣pointed that Court to try him for the several Treasons, and Misde∣meanours, which he had committed against the Kingdom during the evil administration of his Government; and that, upon the Exami∣nation” thereof, Justice might be done.</Q> And, after a great sawciness and impudence of talk, he asked the King, <Q>“what Answer he had to” make to that Impeachment.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THE King, without any alteration in his Countenance by all that insolent provocation, told them, <Q>“he would first know of them, by what Authority they presumed by force to bring him before them, and who gave them power to judge of his Actions, for which he was accountable to none but God; though they had been allways such as” he need not be ashamed to own them before all the world.</Q> He told them, <Q>“that He was their King, They his Subjects; who owed him Duty and Obedience: that no Parliament had Authority to call him before them; but that They were not the Parliament, nor had any Authority from the Parliament to sit in that manner: That of all the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Persons who sate there, and took upon them to judge him, except those Persons who being Officers of the Army he could not but know whilst he was forced to be amongst them, there were only two faces” which he had ever seen before, or whose names were known to him.</Q> <Q>And, after urging “their Duty, that was due to him, and his Supe∣riority” over them,</Q> by such lively Reasons, and Arguments, as were not capable of any Answer, he concluded, <Q>“that he would not so much betray himself, and his Royal Dignity, as to Answer any thing they objected against him, which were to acknowledge their Autho∣rity; though he believ'd that every one of Themselves, as well as the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Spectators, did, in their own Consciences, absolve him from all the” Material things which were objected against him.</Q></P>
<P>BRADSHAW advised him, in a very arrogant manner, <Q>“not to de∣ceive himself with an opinion that any thing he had said would do him any good: that the Parliament knew their own Authority, and” would not suffer it to be called in question or debated:</Q> therefore re∣quired him, <Q>“to think better of it, against he should be next brought thither, and that he would Answer directly to his Charge; otherwise, he could not be so ignorant, as not to know what Judgement the Law pronounced against those who stood mute, and obstinately re∣fused” <MILESTONE N="50"/> to plead.</Q> So the Guard carried his Majesty back to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s; where they treated him as before.</P>

THERE was an accident happen'd that first day, which may be fit <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Disturbance in the Court by the Lady</HI> Fair∣fax <HI>the Gene∣ral's Wife.</HI></NOTE> to be remember'd. When all those who were Commissioners had taken their places, and the King was brought in, the first ceremony was, to read their Commission; which was the Ordinance of Parliament for the Trial; and then the Judges were all called, every Man answering to his name as he was called, and the President being first called and making Answer, the next who was called being the General, Lord <HI>Fair∣fax,</HI> and no Answer being made, the Officer called him the second time, when there was a voice heard that said, <Q>“he had more Wit than to be” there;</Q> which put the Court into some disorder, and some body ask∣ing, <MILESTONE N="10"/> who it was, there was no other Answer but a little murmuring. But, presently, when the Impeachment was read, and that expression used, of <Q>“”All the good People of <HI>England,</HI></Q> the same voice in a louder tone, Answer'd, <Q>“”No, nor the hundreth part of them: upon which, one of the Officers bid the Soldiers give fire into that Box whence those presumptuous words were utter'd.</Q> But it was quickly discern'd that it was the General's Wife, the Lady <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who had utter'd both those sharp sayings; who was presently perswaded or forced to leave the place, to prevent any new disorder. She was of a very noble Ex∣traction, one of the Daughters and Heirs of <HI>Horace</HI> Lord <HI>Vere</HI> of <HI>Til∣bury;</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> who, having been bred in <HI>Holland,</HI> had not that reverence for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as she ought to have had, and so had unhap∣pily concurr'd in her Husband's entring into Rebellion, never imagin∣ing what misery it would bring upon the Kingdom; and now abhorr'd the work in hand as much as any Body could do, and did all she could to hinder her Husband from acting any part in it. Nor did he ever sit in that bloody Court, though he was throughout overwitted by <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> and made a property to bring that to pass which could very hardly have been otherwise effected.</P>
<P>AS there was in many Persons present at that woful Spectacle a real <MILESTONE N="30"/> Duty and Compassion for the King, so there was in others so barbarous and brutal a behaviour towards him, that they called him Tyrant, and Murtherer; and one spit in his face; which his Majesty, without ex∣pressing any trouble, wiped off with his Handkerchief.</P>
<P>THE two Men who were only known to the King before the Trou∣bles, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> were S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Mildmay,</HI> Master of the King's Jewel House, who had been bred up in the Court, being younger Brother of a good Fa∣mily in <HI>Essex,</HI> and who had been prosecuted with so great favours and bounties by King <HI>James,</HI> and by his Majesty, that he was raised by them to a great Estate, and preferr'd to that Office in his House, which <MILESTONE N="40"/> is the best under those which entitle the Officers to be of the privy Council. No Man more obsequious to the Court than He, whilst it flourished; a great flatterer of all Persons in Authority, and a Spie in all places for them. From the beginning of the Parliament, he con∣curr'd with those who were most violent against the Court, and most like to prevail against it; and being thereupon branded with ingrati∣tude, as that brand commonly makes Men most impudent, he conti∣nued his desperate pace with them, till he became one of the Mur∣therers of his Master. The other was S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Danvers,</HI> the younger Brother and Heir of the Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> who was a Gentleman of the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Privy Chamber to the King, and being neglected by his Brother, and having by a vain Expence in his way of living, contracted a vast debt, which he knew not how to pay, and being a proud formal weak Man,
<PB N="197" REF="2170"/>
between being seduced and a Seducer, became so far involv'd in their Counsels that he suffer'd himself to be applied to their worst Offices, taking it to be a high honour to sit upon the same Bench with <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> who employed and contemned him at once: nor did that Party of Miscreants, look upon any two Men in the Kingdom with that scorn and detestation as they did upon <HI>Danvers,</HI> and <HI>Mildmay.</HI></P>
<P>THE several unheard of insolencies which this excellent Prince was <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Summar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passing over the rest of the King's T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tal</NOTE> forced to submit to, at the other times he was brought before that odious Judicatory, his Majestick behaviour, and resolute insisting upon his own dignity, and defending it by manifest Authorities in the Law, <MILESTONE N="10"/> as well as by the clearest deductions from Reason, the pronouncing that horrible sentence upon the most innocent Person in the world, the Execution of that Sentence by the most execrable Murther that was ever committed since that of our Blessed Saviour; and the circum∣stances thereof; the application and interposition that was used by some noble Persons to prevent that woful Murther, and the hypocrisy with which that interposition was eluded, the Saint-like behaviour of that Blessed Martyr, and his Christian courage and patience at his death, are all particulars so well known, and have been so much enlarged upon in a Treatise peculiarly writ to that purpose, that the farther mention∣ing <MILESTONE N="20"/> it in this place would but afflict and grieve the Reader, and make the Relation it self odious as well as needless; and therefore no more shall be said here of that deplorable Tragedy, so much to the dis∣honour of the Nation, and the Religion professed by it, though un∣deservedly.</P>
<P>BUT it will not be unnecessary to add a short Character of his Per∣son, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character</NOTE> that Posterity may know the inestimable loss which the Nation then underwent, in being depriv'd of a Prince whose example would have had a greater influence upon the manners, and piety of the Na∣tion, than the most strict Laws can have. To speak first of his private <MILESTONE N="30"/> Qualifications as a Man, before the mention of his Princely and Royal Virtues; He was, if ever any, the most worthy of the title of an Ho∣nest Man; so great a lover of Justice, that no temptation could dispose <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Justice and Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> him to a wrongful Action, except it was so disguised to him that he believ'd it to be just. He had a tenderness and compassion of Nature, which restrain'd him from ever doing a hard-hearted thing: and there∣fore he was so apt to grant pardon to Malefactors, that the Judges of the Land represented to him the damage and insecurity to the Publick, that flowed from such his Indulgence. And then he restrain'd himself from pardoning either Murthers, or High-way Robberies, and quick∣ly <MILESTONE N="40"/> discern'd the fruits of his severity by a wonderful Reformation of those Enormities. He was very punctual and regular in his Devotions; <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Devotion and Religion</NOTE> he was never known to enter upon his Recreations or Sports, though never so early in the Morning, before he had been at Publick Prayers; so that on hunting days his Chaplains were bound to a very early At∣tendance. He was likewise very strict in observing the hours of his private Cabinet Devotions; and was so severe an exactor of gravity and reverence in all mention of Religion, that he could never endure any light or prophane word, with what sharpness of Wit soever it was cover'd: and though he was well pleased, and delighted with reading <MILESTONE N="50"/> Verses made upon any occasion, no Man durst bring before him any thing that was prophane or unclean. That kind of Wit had never any
<PB N="198" REF="2180"/>
Countenance then. He was so great an Example of Conjugal Af∣fection, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Conjugal Chastity.</NOTE> that they who did not imitate him in that particular, durst not brag of their Liberty: and he did not only permit, but direct his Bishops, to prosecute those scandalous Vices, in the Ecclesiasti∣cal Courts, against Persons of eminence, and near Relation to his Service.</P>
<P>HIS Kingly Virtues had some mixture and allay, that hindred them from shining in full Lustre, and from producing those fruits they should have been attended with. He was not in his Nature very bountiful, <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was not very bounti∣ful.</NOTE> though he gave very much. This appear'd more after the Duke of <MILESTONE N="10"/> <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s death, after which those showres fell very rarely; and he paused too long in giving, which made those to whom he gave, less sensible of the benefit. He kept State to the full, which made his Court <NOTE PLACE="marg">He kept State in his Court.</NOTE> very orderly; no Man presuming to be seen in a place where he had no pretence to be. He saw, and observ'd Men long, before he receiv'd them about his Person; and did not love strangers, nor very confident Men. He was a patient hearer of Causes; which he frequently accu∣stom'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Patient in hearing Causes</NOTE> himself to at the Council-Board; and judged very well, and was dextrous in the mediating part: so that he often put an end to Causes by perswasion, which the stubborness of Men's humours made dilatory <MILESTONE N="20"/> in Courts of Justice.</P>
<P>HE was very fearless in his Person; but, in his riper years, not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fearless, not Enterprising.</NOTE> very Enterprising. He had an excellent understanding, but was not confident enough of it; which made him often times change his own <NOTE PLACE="marg">Not confident in his own judgement.</NOTE> opinion for a worse, and follow the advice of Men that did not judge so well as Himself. This made him more irresolute than the conjun∣cture of his Affairs would admit: if he had been of a rougher and more imperious Nature, he would have found more respect and duty. And his not applying some severe cures to approaching Evils, proceeded from the Lenity of his Nature, and the tenderness of his Conscience <MILESTONE N="30"/> which, in all cases of blood, made him choose the softer way, and not hearken to severe counsels, how reasonably soever urged. This only restrain'd him from pursuing his advantage in the first <HI>Scotish</HI> Expedi∣tion, when, humanly speaking, he might have reduced that Nation to the most entire obedience that could have been wished. But no Man can say he had then many who advised him to it, but the contrary, by a wonderful indisposition all his Council had to the War, or any other fatigue. He was allways a great Lover of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Nation, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lover of the</HI> Scotish <HI>Na∣tion.</HI></NOTE> having not only been born there, but educated by that People, and be∣sieged by them allways, having few <HI>English</HI> about him till he was King; <MILESTONE N="$0"/> and the major number of his Servants being still of that Nation, who he thought could never fail him. And among these, no Man had such an Ascendent over him, by the humblest insinuations, as Duke <HI>Ha∣milton</HI> had.</P>
<P>As he excelled in all other Virtues, so in temperance he was so strict, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abhorr'd De∣bauchery.</NOTE> that he abhorr'd all Debauchery to that degree, that, at a great festi∣val solemnity, where he once was, when very many of the Nobility of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> were entertain'd, being told by one who with∣drew from thence, what vast draughts of Wine they drank, and <Q>“that there was one Earl, who had drank most of the rest down, and was” <MILESTONE N="50"/> not himself moved or alter'd,</Q> the King said, <Q>“that he deserv'd to be” hanged;</Q> and that Earl coming shortly after into the room where his
<PB N="199" REF="2190"/>
Majesty was, in some gayety, to shew how unhurt he was from that Battle, the King sent one to bid him withdraw from his Majesties pre∣sence; nor did he in some days after appear before him.</P>
<P>So many miraculous circumstances contributed to his Ruine, that Men might well think that Heaven and Earth conspired it. Though he was, from the first declension of his power, so much betrayed by his own Servants, that there were very few who remain'd faithful to him, yet that treachery proceeded not allways from any treasonable pur∣pose to do Him any harm, but from particular, and personal Animo∣sities against other Men. And, afterwards, the terror all Men were un∣der <MILESTONE N="10"/> of the Parliament, and the guilt they were conscious of themselves, made them watch all opportunities to make themselves gracious to those who could do them good; and so they became Spies upon their Ma∣ster, and from one piece of knavery were harden'd and confirm'd to undertake another; till at last they had no hope of preservation but by the Destruction of their Master. And after all this, when a Man might reasonably believe that less than a universal Defection of three Nations, could not have reduced a great King to so ugly a fate, it is most cer∣tain, that, in that very hour when he was thus wickedly murther'd in the sight of the Sun, he had as great a share in the Hearts and Af∣fections <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Belov'd by his Subjects in ge∣neral when he was Mur∣ther'd</NOTE> of his Subjects in general, was as much belov'd, esteem'd, and longed for by the People in general of the three Nations, as any of his Predecessors had ever been. To conclude, He was the worthiest Gen∣tleman, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sum of his Character.</NOTE> the best Master, the best Friend, the best Husband, the best Father, and the best Christian, that the Age in which he liv'd produced. And if he were not the greatest King, if he were without some parts and qualities which have made some Kings great, and happy, no other Prince was ever unhappy who was possessed of half his Virtues and En∣dowments, and so much without any kind of Vice.</P>
<P>THIS unparallel'd Murther and Parricide was committed upon the <MILESTONE N="30"/> thirtieth of <HI>January,</HI> in the year, according to the Account used in <HI>England,</HI> 1648, in the forty and ninth year of his Age, and when he had such excellent health, and so great Vigour of Body, that when his Murtherers caused him to be open'd (which they did; and were some of them present at it with great curiosity) they confessed, and declared, <Q>“that no Man had ever all his vital parts so perfect and unhurt; and that he seem'd to be of so admirable a composition and constitution,” that he would probably have liv'd as long as nature could subsist.</Q> His Body was immediately carried into a room at <HI>White-Hall;</HI> where <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Funeral.</NOTE> he was exposed for many days to the publick view, that all Men might <MILESTONE N="40"/> know that he was not alive. And he was then imbalm'd, and put in∣to a Coffin, and so carried to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s; where he likewise remain'd several days. <Q>They who were qualified to order his Funeral, declar'd, “that he should be buried at <HI>Windsor</HI> in a decent manner, provided” that the whole Expence should not exceed five hundred pounds.</Q> The Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Southam∣pton</HI> and <HI>Lindsey,</HI> who had been of his Bed-Chamber, and allways very faithful to him, desired those who govern'd, <Q>“that they might have leave to perform the last duty to their dead Master, and to wait upon” him to his Grave;</Q> which, after some pauses, they were permitted to <MILESTONE N="50"/> do, with this, <Q>“that they should not attend the Corps out of the Town; since they resolv'd it should be privately carried to <HI>Windsor</HI> without
<PB N="200" REF="2200"/>
Pomp or noise, and then they should have timely notice, that, if they” pleased, they might be at his Interment.</Q> And accordingly it was committed to four of those Servants, who had been by them appointed to wait upon him during his Imprisonment, that they should convey the Body to <HI>Windsor;</HI> which they did. And it was, that Night, placed in that Chamber which had usually been his Bed-Chamber: the next Morning, it was carried into the great Hall; where it remain'd till the Lords came; who arriv'd there in the Afternoon, and immediately went to Colonel <HI>Whitchcot,</HI> the Governour of the Castle, and shew'd the Order they had from the Parliament to be present at the Burial; <MILESTONE N="10"/> which he admitted; but when they desired that his Majesty might be Buried according to the form of the Common-Prayer Book, the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> being present with them to officiate, he positively and rough∣ly refused to consent to it; and said, <Q>“it was not Lawful; that the Common-Prayer Book was put down, and he would not suffer it to” be used in that Garrison where He Commanded;</Q> nor could all the reasons, perswasions, and entreaties, prevail with him to suffer it. Then they went into the Church, to make choice of a place for burial. But when they enter'd into it, which they had been so well acquainted with, they found it so alter'd and transform'd, all Inscriptions, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> those Land-Marks pulled down, by which all Men knew every par∣ticular place in That Church, and such a dismal mutation over the whole, that they knew not where they were: nor was there one old Officer that had belonged to it, or knew where our Princes had used to be interr'd. At last there was a Fellow of the Town who under∣took to tell them the place, where, he said, <Q>“there was a Vault, in which King <HI>Harry</HI> the Eighth and Queen <HI>Jane Seymour</HI> were in∣terr'd.”</Q> As near that place as could conveniently be, they caused the Grave to be made. There the King's Body was laid without any words, or other Ceremonies than the tears and sighs of the few beholders <MILESTONE N="30"/> Upon the Coffin was a plate of Silver fixt with these words only, <HI>King Charles</HI> 1648. When the Coffin was put in, the black Velvet Pall that had cover'd it was thrown over it, and then the Earth thrown in; which the Governour stayed to see perfectly done, and then took the Keys of the Church.</P>
<P>I HAVE been the longer, and the more particular in this relation, that I may from thence take occasion to mention what fell out long after, and which administer'd a subject of much discourse; in which, according to the several humours and fancies of Men, they who were in nearest credit and trust about the King, underwent many very se∣vere <MILESTONE N="40"/> Censures and Reproaches, not without reflection upon the King himself. Upon the return of King <HI>Charles</HI> the second with so much congratulation, and universal Joy of the People, above ten years af∣ter the Murther of his Father, it was generally expected that the Body should be removed from that obscure burial, and, with such Cere∣mony as should be thought fit, should be solemnly deposited with his Royal Ancestors in King <HI>Harry</HI> the Seventh's Chapel in the Collegiate Church of <HI>Westminster.</HI> And the King himself intended nothing more, and spoke often of it, as if it were only deferr'd till some Circumstances and Ceremonies in the doing it might be adjusted. But, by degrees, <MILESTONE N="50"/> the discourse of it was diminished, as if it were totally laid aside upon some reasons of State, the ground whereof several Men guessed at
<PB N="201" REF="2210"/>
according to their fancies, and thereupon cast those reproaches upon the States-men as they thought reasonable, when the reasons which were suggested by their own imaginations, did not satisfy their under∣standing. For the satisfaction and information of all Men, I choose in this place to explain that matter; which, it may be, is not known to many; and at that time was not, for many reasons, thought fit to be published. The Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> was dead before the King re∣turn'd; the Marquis of <HI>Hertford</HI> died in a short time after, and was seldom out of his Lodging after his Majesty came to <HI>White-Hall:</HI> the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lindsey</HI> went to <HI>Windsor,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="10"/> took with them such of their own Servants as had attended them in that Service, and as many others as they remember'd had been then present, and were still alive; who all amounted to a small Number; there being, at the time of the Interment, great strictness used in ad∣mitting any to be present whose names were not included in the Or∣der which the Lords had brought. In a word, the confusion they had at that time observ'd to be in that Church, and the small alterations which were begun to be made towards decency, so totally perplexed their Memories, that they could not satisfy themselves in what place, or part of the Church the Royal Body was interr'd: Yet, where any <MILESTONE N="20"/> concurr'd upon this, or that place, they caused the ground to be open'd at a good distance, and, upon such Enquiries, found no Cause to be∣lieve that they were near the place: and, upon their giving this Ac∣count to the King, the thought of that remove was laid aside; and the reason communicated to very few, for the better discountenancing far∣ther Enquiry.</P>
<P>THOUGH this wicked and abominable Action had to a degree sa∣tisfied their malice, it had not enough provided for their ambition or security. They had no sooner freed themselves from one, than an∣other King was grown up in his place. And besides the old Royal Par∣ty, <MILESTONE N="30"/> which continued still vigorous, notwithstanding their loss of so much Blood, and (which weakens allmost as much) of so great Estates, they did apprehend that there were in the vast number of the guilty (who quietly looked on upon the removal of the old, whom they had so grievously offended) who would yet be very willing to submit, and be obedient to the new King; who was like to find more Friends abroad, as well as at home, than his Father had done. And therefore they made hast to prevent this threatning evil, by publishing a Procla∣mation, <Q>“that no Person whatsoever should presume to declare <HI>Charles</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proclama∣tion against proclaiming</HI> Charles Stuart <HI>King.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Stuart,</HI> Son of the late <HI>Charles,</HI> commonly called the Prince of <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Wales,</HI> or any other Person, to be King, or Chief Magistrate of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> or of any Dominions belonging thereunto, by co∣lour of Inheritance, Succession, Election, or any other Claim what∣soever; and that whoever, contrary to this Act, presume to pro∣claim <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should be deem'd and adjudged a Traytor, and suffer ac∣cordingly.”</Q></P>
<P>IN the next place, that their Infant Republick might be nursed, cherished, and brought up by those only who had gotten and brought it forth, they resolv'd to take away and abolish the House of Peers; and Voted, <Q>“that they would make no farther Addresses to the House <MILESTONE N="50"/> of Lords, nor receive any more from them: that the House of Peers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Common<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> abolish the House of Peers</NOTE> in Parliament, was useless and dangerous; and that an Act should
<PB N="202" REF="2220"/>
be brought in for abolishing it: that the Privilege of the Peers of be∣ing” freed from Arrests, should be declared null and void;</Q> all which was done within few days. However, they declared, <Q>“that the Peers” should have the Privilege to be elected Knights,</Q> or Burgesses; of which gracious concession some of them took the benefit soon after, and sate, upon their Election into vacant places, in the House of Commons.</P>
<P>THERE remain'd yet another provision to be made against their own Ambition; for it was well known, that there were yet amongst them many who were not equally fond of a Common-wealth; and <MILESTONE N="10"/> therefore they declared, <Q>“that it had been found by experience, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vote against the Office of Kingship.</NOTE> the Office of a King in this Nation, or to have the power thereof in any single Person, was unnecessary, burthensom, and dangerous to the liberty, and safety, and publick Interest of the Nation; and there∣fore that it should be utterly abolished; and to that purpose an Act” should be forthwith prepared: which was likewise done, and pass'd.</Q> And by this Triple Cord they believ'd their Republick would be strong∣ly compacted, and sufficiently provided for.</P>
<P>THEIR new Great Seal was by this time ready; whereon was en∣graven, <NOTE PLACE="marg">They make a new Great Seal.</NOTE> on one side, the Armes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> with this In∣scription, <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>The Great Seal of England;</HI> and on the other side the Por∣traiture of the House of Commons sitting, circumscribed, <HI>In the first year of freedom by God's blessing restored,</HI> 1648. The Custody of this Great Seal was committed to three Lawyers, whereof one had sate among the King's Judges, and the others had contributed too much to their Service. All things being now in this good Order, they sent for their Judges, to agree upon the formality and circumstances of Proceedings. <Q>For it was declared by the Parliament, “that they were fully resolv'd to maintain, and uphold the fundamental Laws of the Nation, in order to the preservation of the Lives, Property, and Li∣berty <MILESTONE N="30"/> of the People, notwithstanding all the alterations made in the” Government for the good of the People:</Q> And the Writs were no more to run in the King's Name, as they had allways done, but the Name, Style, and Test, to be <HI>Custodes Libertatis Angliae, authori∣tate Parliamenti.</HI> If it were not a thing so notoriously known, it could not be believ'd, that of twelve Judges, whereof ten were of their own making, and the other two had quietly submitted, from the be∣ginning of the War, to the Authority that govern'd, six laid down their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Six of their own Judges give up.</NOTE> places, and could not give themselves leave to accept Commissions from the new Established power. So aguish and fantastical a thing is <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Conscience of Men who have once departed from the Rule of Con∣science, in hope to be permitted to adhere to it again upon a less pressing occasion.</P>
<P>IT will be requisite, at least it may not be unfit, to rest and make <NOTE PLACE="marg">How some Neighbouring Princes took the King's Murther.</NOTE> a pause in this place, to take a view, with what Countenance the Kings and Princes of <HI>Christendom</HI> had their Eyes fixed upon this sad and bloody Spectacle; how they looked upon that issue of blood, at which their own seem'd to be so prodigally poured out; with what conster∣nation their Hearts labour'd to see the impious hands of the lowest and basest Subjects bathing in the Bowels, and reeking blood of their <MILESTONE N="50"/> Soveraign; a Brother King, the Anointed of the Lord, dismember'd as a Malefactor; what Combination, and Union was enter'd into, to
<PB N="203" REF="2230"/>
take vengeance upon those Monsters, and to vindicate the Royal blood thus wickedly spilt. Alas! there was scarce a murmur amongst any of them at it; but, as if they had been all called upon in the language of the Prophet <HI>Isaiah, Go, ye swift Messengers, to a Nation scat∣tered, and peeled, to a People terrible from the beginning hitherto, to a Nation meted out, and troden down, whose Lands the Rivers have spoiled,</HI> they made hast, and sent over, that they might get shares in the Spoiles of a murthered Monarch.</P>
<P>CARDINAL <HI>Mazarin,</HI> who, in the Infancy of the <HI>French</HI> King, managed that Scepter, had long adored the conduct of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="10"/> sought his Friendship by a lower and viler application than was suita∣ble to the purple of a Cardinal, sent now to be admitted as a Merchant to traffick in the purchase of the rich Goods and Jewels of the ris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Crown; of which he purchased the rich Beds, Hangings, and Carpets, which furnished his Palace at <HI>Paris.</HI> The King of <HI>Spain</HI> had, from the beginning of the Rebellion, kept <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</HI> who had been his Embassadour to the King, residing still at <HI>London;</HI> and He had, upon several occasions, many Audiences from the Parliament, and several Treaties on foot; and assoon as this dismal Murther was over, that Embassadour, who had allways a great malignity towards <MILESTONE N="20"/> the King, bought as many Pictures, and other precious Goods apper∣taining to the Crown, as, being sent in Ships to the <HI>Corunna</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> were carried from thence to <HI>Madrid</HI> upon Eighteen Mules. <HI>Christina</HI> Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> purchased the choice of all the Medals, and Jewels, and some Pictures of a great price, and receiy'd the Parliament's Agent with great Joy, and Pomp, and made an Alliance with them. The Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold,</HI> who was Governour of <HI>Flanders,</HI> disbursed a great Sum of Money for many of the best Pictures, which adorned the se∣veral Palaces of the King; which were all brought to him to <HI>Brussels,</HI> and from thence carried by him into <HI>Germany.</HI> In this manner did <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Neighbour Princes joyn to assist <HI>Cromwell</HI> with very great Sums of Money, whereby he was enabled to prosecute, and finish his wicked Victory over what yet remain'd unconquer'd, and to extinguish Mo∣narchy in this renown'd Kingdom; whilst they enriched and adorned themselves with the Ruins and Spoiles of the surviving Heir, without applying any part thereof to his Relief, in the greatest necessities which ever King was subject to. And that which is stranger than all this (since most Men, by recovering their fortunes, use to recover most of what they were before robbed of, many who joyn'd in the Rob∣bery pretending that they took care to preserve it for the true Owner) <MILESTONE N="40"/> not one of all these Princes ever restored any of their unlawful purchases to the King, after his blessed Restoration.</P>
<P>WHILST these perfidious wretches had their hands still reeking in the precious blood of their Soveraign, they were put upon a new piece of Butchery, as necessary to the Establishment of their new Tyranny. The King was no sooner dead, but they declared, as hath been said, <Q>“that from this time <HI>England</HI> should be govern'd as a Common-wealth” by the Parliament; that is, by that handful of Men, who by their wisdom and power had wrought this wonderful alteration.</Q> And be∣cause the number of those appear'd very small, and the number of those <MILESTONE N="50"/> they had excluded was as visible, they made an Order and Declaration, <Q>“that as many of the Members who had been excluded, as would, under
<PB N="204" REF="2240"/>
their hands, approve all that had been done during the time they were excluded, should return to their Seats in the House without” any prejudice for the future.</Q> Hereupon divers went again into the House, satisfying themselves that they were not guilty of the Inno∣cent Royal Blood that had been spilt; and so their number increased. They had made a new Great Seal, as hath been said, and called the Commissioners, who were entrusted with the keeping thereof, <HI>The Keepers of the Liberties of England.</HI> And the Court of King's Bench they called the <HI>Upper</HI> Bench, and appointed certain Persons to con∣sider of such alterations as were necessary to be made in the Laws of <MILESTONE N="$$"/> <HI>England,</HI> in regard of so important a mutation. That they might have some obligation of obedience from their Subjects for the future, who had broken all the former Oaths which they had taken, a new Oath <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Oath im∣posed called the Engage∣ment.</NOTE> was prepared and established, which they called an <HI>Engagement;</HI> the form whereof was, that every Man should swear, <Q>“that he would be true and faithful to the Government established without King or” House of Peers: and whosoever refused to take that Engagement should be incapable of holding any place, or office in Church or State.</Q> The necessity of taking which Oath did not only exclude all of the Royal Party, but freed them from very many who had Offices in Church <MILESTONE N="20"/> and State, who, being of the Presbyterian Party, durst not sacrifice their beloved Covenant to this new Engagement. And so they filled many considerable places both in the one, and the other, with Men throughly prepared for their Service. But before they could model and finish all this, and whilst it was preparing, they had, in several parts of the Kingdom, terrified the People with Blood-Spectacles, in the executing many of the Persons who had been taken. And that all hopes and pretences might be taken away from their Subjects, the Peers of <HI>England,</HI> that they should hereafter have any thing to do in declaring what the fundamental Laws of the Land were, a new <MILESTONE N="30"/> High Court of Justice was appointed to sit for the Trial of Duke <HI>Ha∣milton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new High Court of Ju∣stice sits; and several Trials before them.</NOTE> the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> and another Gentleman, one S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Owen</HI> (who, having been here∣tofore a Colonel in the King's Army, had, in a late Insurrection in <HI>Wales,</HI> killed the High Sheriff) that they might see there should here∣after be no more distinction of Quality in Trials for Life, but that the greatest Lord and the Commoners should undergo the same Judica∣tory, and form of Trial. Nor could it be thought unreasonable, that all the Creations of the Crown should be determin'd by that jurisdiction to which the Crown it self had been subjected. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>DUKE <HI>Hamilton</HI> could not well be thought other than a Prisoner <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke</HI> Hamil∣ton <HI>first tried.</HI></NOTE> of War, and so not liable to a Trial for his Life. He had attempted to make an Escape; in which he had so well succeeded, that he was out of his Enemies hands full three days; but, being impatient to be at a greater distance from them, he was apprehended as he was taking Horse in <HI>Southwark;</HI> and carried Prisoner into the Tower; from whence he was brought, with the others, before that High Court of Justice. He insisted upon <Q>“the Right and Privilege of the Kingdom of <HI>Scot∣land;</HI> that it had not the least Dependence upon the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> but was entirely Govern'd by its own Laws: that He, be∣ing <MILESTONE N="50"/> a Subject of that Kingdom, was bound to obey the Commands thereof; and the Parliament of that Kingdom having thought it
<PB N="205" REF="2250"/>
necessary to raise an Army for the relief of their King, and con∣stituted Him General of that Army, it was not Lawful for him to refuse the Command thereof; and whatever misfortune he had un∣dergone with it, he could not be understood to be liable to any pu∣nishment” but what a Prisoner of War was bound to undergo.</Q> He was told, <Q>“that the Rights and Laws of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> were not called in Question, nor could be violated by Their pro∣ceedings against Him, who was a Subject of <HI>England;</HI> against which he was charged with Rebellion and Treason: that they did not pro∣ceed against him as Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but as Earl of <HI>Cam∣bridge”</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> in <HI>England,</HI> and they would judge him as such.</Q> The Earl <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Then the Earl of</HI> Holland.</NOTE> of <HI>Holland</HI> was not at that time in a good disposition of Health, and so answer'd little, as a Man that would rather receive his life by their favour, than from the strength of his defence. The Earl of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Norwich.</NOTE> <HI>Norwich</HI> behaved himself with great submission to the Court, and with all those Addresses as were most like to reconcile his Judges to him, and to prevail over their Affections: spoke of <Q>“his being bred up in the Court, from his Cradle, in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> of his having been a Servant to King <HI>James</HI> all his Reign; of his dependence upon Prince <HI>Harry;</HI> afterwards, upon the late King; of the obliga∣tions” <MILESTONE N="20"/> he had to the Crown, and of his Endeavours to serve it;</Q> and concluded as a Man that would be beholding to them if they would give him leave to live.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Capel</HI> appear'd undaunted, and utterly refused to sub∣mit <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Capel.</NOTE> to their jurisdiction; <Q>“that in the condition and capacity of a Soldier and a Prisoner of War, he said, the Lawyers and Gown-men had nothing to do with him, and therefore he would not Answer” to any thing which they had said against him</Q> <HI>(Steel</HI> having treated him with great rudeness and insolence) but insisted upon <Q>“the Law of Nations, which exempted all Prisoners, though submitting to <MILESTONE N="30"/> Mercy, from death, if it was not inflicted within so many days;” which were long since expired.</Q> <Q>He urged “the Declaration which <HI>Fairfax</HI> the General had made to Him, and the rest of the Prisoners, after the death of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Charles Lucas</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Lisle,</HI> that no other of their Lives should be in danger, which he had Witnesses” ready to prove, if they might be admitted;</Q> and concluded, <Q>“that, if he had committed any Offence worthy of death, he might be tried by his Peers; which was his Right by the Laws of the Land; the” benefit whereof he required.</Q> <HI>Ireton,</HI> who was present, and sate as one of his Judges, denied <Q>“that the General had made any such pro∣mise, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and if he had, that the Parliament's Authority could not be” restrain'd thereby;</Q> and put him in mind of his Carriage at that time, and how much he neglected then the General's civility. <Q>The other insisted still on the promise; and urged “that the General might be sent” for, and examined;</Q> which they knew not how to deny, but, in re∣gard of his indisposition of Health, they said <Q>“they would send to” him, whilst they proceeded against S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Owen,</HI> who was the other Prisoner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE answer'd them without any application, “that he was a plain <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John Owen</NOTE> Gentleman of <HI>Wales,</HI> who had been allways taught to obey the King; <MILESTONE N="50"/> that he had serv'd him honestly during the War, and finding after∣wards that many honest Men endeavour'd to raise Forces, whereby
<PB N="206" REF="2260"/>
they might get him out of Prison, He did the like; and the High Sheriff endeavour'd to oppose him, and so chanced to be killed; which” he might have avoided if he had stayed at home:</Q> and concluded like a Man that did not much care what they resolv'd concerning him.</P>
<P>WHETHER the Question was well stated to <HI>Fairfax,</HI> or what was else said to him to disswade him from owning his Declaration and pro∣mise, he boggled so much in his Answer, that they would be of opi∣nion, <Q>“that he had not made such direct and positive promise; and that the same was never transmitted to the Parliament; which it <MILESTONE N="10"/> ought to have been; and that, at most, it could but exempt those Prisoners from being tried before a Court, or Council of War, and could not be understood as an obligation upon the Parliament, not to give direction to such a legal Proceeding against them, as they” should find necessary for the Peace, and Safety of the Kingdom.</Q> The President <HI>Bradshaw</HI> told the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> with many insolent expres∣sions, <Q>“that he was tried before such Judges as the Parliament thought” fit to assign him; and who had judged a better Man than himself.</Q> So the Sentence of death was pronounced against all five of them, <Q>“that” <NOTE PLACE="marg">All five con∣demn'd.</NOTE> they should lose their heads;</Q> upon which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Owen</HI> made a low <MILESTONE N="20"/> reverence, and gave them humble thanks, and being asked by a Stander by, <Q>“”what he meant?</Q> he said aloud, <Q>“it was a very great honour to a poor Gentleman of <HI>Wales</HI> to lose his head with such noble” Lords;</Q> and swore a great Oath, <Q>“that he was afraid they would have” hanged him.</Q></P>
<P>THE Prisoners were all carried to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s; where they were to remain till their Execution two days after; which time their Friends, and Relations, had to endeavour to preserve their lives by the Power and Authority of the Parliament; where there were so many sitting who had not sate in judgement upon them, and who were of several <MILESTONE N="30"/> Affections, and liable to several temptations, that there might be a reasonable hope to rescue them from the cruel and unjust Judgement. Their Wives, and Children, and Friends, left no way untried to pre∣vail; offer'd, and gave Money to some who were willing to receive it, and made promises accordingly. But they who had the greatest credit, and most power to terrify others who should displease them, were inexorable; yet dealt so much more honestly than the rest, that they declared to the Ladies, who sollicited for their Husbands and their Fathers, <Q>“”that they would not endeavour to do them Service.</Q> <HI>Ireton,</HI> above all Men, continued his insolent and dogged humour, and <MILESTONE N="40"/> told them, <Q>“”if He had credit, they should all dye. Others, who gave better Words, had no better Meaning than he.</Q></P>
<P>ALL their Petitions were read in order, being penn'd in such Styles as the Friends, who sollicited for them, were advised. Duke <HI>Hamil∣ton</HI>'s Petition being read, many, upon the motives of Justice, and as they imagined, his death might be the occasion of new troubles be∣tween the two Nations, since <HI>Scotland</HI> could not but resent it, would have been willing he should live. But he had fewer Friends to his Person than any of the rest; and <HI>Cromwell</HI> knew well that his being out of the way would not be unacceptable to them upon whom the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Peace of that Kingdom depended: so that when his Petition was read, it was rejected by very much the Major part of Voices. The con∣fideration
<PB N="207" REF="2270"/>
of the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> took up a long debate: the Interest and Interposition of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> his Brother, was apply'd; and every Presbyterian, to a Man, was sollicitous to preserve him. They urged <Q>“his merit towards the Parliament in the beginning of the Troubles; how much he had suffer'd in the Court for his affe∣ction to them: his Age, and Infirmities, which would not suffer him long to enjoy that life they should give him: and the consideration” of his Wife, and Children, which were numerous.</Q> But these Ar∣guments stirr'd up others, to inveigh against his backslidings with the more bitterness, and to undervalue the services he had ever done; <MILESTONE N="10"/> to tax his vanities, and his breach of faith. When the Question was put concerning him, they who were for the Negative, exceeded the number of the other by three or four Votes; <HI>Cromwell</HI> having more than an ordinary animosity against him, for his behaviour in the be∣ginning of the Summer, and for some words of neglect and contempt he had let fall concerning himself. The Earl of <HI>Norwich</HI> came next upon the stage; who having allways lived a chearful and jovial Life, without contracting many Enemies, had many there who wish'd him well, and few who had animosity against him; so that when the Que∣stion was put concerning him, the House was equally divided, the <MILESTONE N="20"/> Votes which rejected his Petition, and those which would preserve his Life, were equal: so that his life or death depended upon the sin∣gle Vote of the Speaker; who told the House, <Q>“that he had receiv'd many obligations from that Lord; and that once when he had been like to have incurr'd the King's displeasure, by some misinformation,” which would have been very penal to him,</Q> the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> (un∣der which style he was treated, the additional of <HI>Norwich</HI> not being allow'd by them upon their old Rule) <Q>“had by his credit preserv'd him, and remov'd the Prejudice that was against him; and there∣fore” he was oblig'd in gratitude to give his Vote for the saving him.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"/> By this good fortune he came to be preserv'd; whether the ground of it were true or no, or whether the Speaker made it only as an excuse for saving any Man's Life who was put to ask it in that place.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> shortly after he was brought Prisoner to the Tower from <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle, had by a wonderful adventure, having a Cord and all things necessary convey'd to him, let himself down out of the Window of his Chamber in the night, over the Wall of the Tower; and had been directed through what part of the Ditch he might be best able to wade. Whether he found the right place, <MILESTONE N="40"/> or whether there was no safer place, he found the Water and the Mud so deep, that, if he had not been by the head taller than other Men, he must have perish'd, since the Water came up to his Chin. The way was so long to the other side, and the fatigue of drawing himself out of so much Mud so intolerable, that his spirits were near spent, and he was once ready to call out for help, as thinking it better to be carried back again to the Prison, than to be found in such a place, from whence he could not extricate himself, and where he was ready to expire. But it pleased God, that he got at last to the other side; where his Friends expected him, and carried him to <MILESTONE N="50"/> a Chamber in the Temple; where he remain'd two or three nights secure from any discovery, notwithstanding the diligence that could
<PB N="208" REF="2280"/>
not but be used to recover a Man they design'd to use no better. After two or three days a Friend whom he trusted much, and who deserv'd to be trusted, conceiving that he might be more secure in a place to which there was less resort, and where there were so many harbour'd who were every day sought after, had provided a Lodging for him in a private House in <HI>Lambeth</HI> Marsh; and calling upon him in an Evening, when it was dark, to go thither, they chose ra∣ther to take any Boat they found ready at the Temple Stairs, than to trust one of that People with the secret; and it was so late that there was one only Boat left there. In that the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> (as well dis∣guis'd <MILESTONE N="$0"/> as he thought necessary) and his Friend, put themselves, and bid the Waterman to row them to <HI>Lambeth.</HI> Whether, in their pas∣sage thither, the other Gentleman call'd him <HI>my Lord,</HI> as was con∣fidently reported, or whether the Waterman had any jealousy by ob∣serving what he thought was a disguise, when they were landed, the wicked Waterman, undiscern'd, follow'd them, till he saw into what House they went; and then went to an Officer, and demanded, <Q>“what he would give him to bring him to the place where the Lord” <HI>Capel</HI> lay?</Q> and the Officer promising to give him ten pounds, he led him presently to the House, where that excellent Person was sei∣sed <MILESTONE N="$0"/> upon, and the next day carried to the Tower.</P>
<P>WHEN the Petition, that his Wife had deliver'd, was read, many Gentlemen spoke on his behalf; and mention'd the great virtues which were in him; and <Q>“that he had never deceiv'd them, or pretended to be of their Party; but allways resolutely declar'd himself for the” King: and <HI>Cromwell,</HI></Q> who had known him very well, spoke so much good of him, and profess'd to have so much kindness and re∣spect for him, that all Men thought he was now safe, when he con∣cluded, <Q>“that his affection to the Publick so much weigh'd down his private Friendship, that he could not but tell them, that the Que∣stion <MILESTONE N="30"/> was now, whether they would preserve the most bitter and the most implacable Enemy they had: that he knew the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> very well, and knew that he would be the last Man in <HI>England</HI> that would forsake the Royal Interest; that he had great Courage, Industry, and Generosity; that he had many Friends who would all∣ways adhere to him; and that as long as he liv'd, what condition soever he was in, he would be a thorn in their sides; and there∣fore, for the good of the Common-wealth, he should give his Vote” against the Petition.</Q> <HI>Ireton</HI>'s hatred was immortal: he spake of him, and against him, as of a Man of whom he was heartily afraid. Very <MILESTONE N="40"/> many were sway'd by the Argument that had been urg'd against Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> <Q>“that God was not pleas'd that he should Escape, because” he had put him into their hands again, when he was at liberty.</Q> And so, after a long debate, though there was not a Man who had not a value for him, and very few who had a particular malice, or prejudice towards him, the Question being put, the Negative was more by three or four Voices: So that, of the four Lords, three were without the mercy of that unmerciful People. There being no other Petition presented, <HI>Ireton</HI> told them, <Q>“there had been great Endea∣vours and Sollicitation us'd to save all those Lords; but that there <MILESTONE N="50"/> was a Commoner, another condemn'd Person, for whom no one Man had spoke a word, nor had he himself so much as petition'd
<PB N="209" REF="2290"/>
them; and therefore he desired, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Owen</HI> might be preserv'd” by the meer motive, and goodness of the House it self;</Q> which found little opposition; whether they were satiated with blood, or that they were willing, by this Instance, that the Nobility should see that a Com∣moner should be preferr'd before them.</P>
<P>A SCAFFOLD was erected before <HI>Westminster-</HI>Hall, and all the Pri∣soners condemn'd were brought from S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s (as well the two who were repriev'd, as the three who were to suffer) upon the ninth of <HI>March,</HI> that was at the end of the year 1648, a little more than a Month after the Murther of the King, to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Cotton</HI>'s House, <MILESTONE N="10"/> at the upper end of <HI>Westminster-</HI>Hall; where they were suffer'd to re∣pose themselves about the space of an hour, and then were led suc∣cessively through the Hall to the Scaffold, Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> being first; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke</HI> Hamil∣ton <HI>be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ade<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> March 9.</NOTE> who seem'd yet to have some hope of a Reprieve, and made some stay in the Hall, till the Earl of <HI>Denbigh</HI> came to him; and, after a short whisper, in which he found there was no hope, he ascended the Scaf∣fold. He complain'd much of <Q>“the injustice that was done him; and that he was put to death for obeying the Laws of his Country; which” if he had not done, he must have been put to death there.</Q> He ac∣knowledged the obligations he had to the King, and seem'd not sorry <MILESTONE N="20"/> for the gratitude he had expressed, how dear soever it cost him. His natural darkness, and reservation in his discourse, made him to be thought a Wise man, and his having been in Command under the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and his continual discourses of Battles, and Fortifications, made him be thought a great Soldier. And both these mistakes were the Cause that made him be looked upon as a worse and a more dan∣gerous Man, than in truth he deserv'd to be.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was brought next, who, by his long sickness, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Holland <HI>the same day.</HI></NOTE> was so spent, that his Spirits serv'd not to entertain the People with long discourse. <Q>He spoke of “his Religion, as a matter unquestion∣able, <MILESTONE N="30"/> by the education he had had in the Religious Family of which” he was a branch:</Q> which was thought a strange discourse for a dy∣ing Man, who, though a Son, knew enough of the iniquity of his Fa∣ther's House, which should rather have been buried in silence, than, by such an unseasonable Testimony, have been revived in the memory and discourse of Men. He took more care to be thought a good friend to Parliaments, than a good Servant to his Master, and was thought to say too little of his having failed so much in his Duty to him, which most good Men believ'd to be the Source from whence his present ca∣lamity sprung. He was a very well bred Man, and a fine Gentleman <MILESTONE N="40"/> in good times; but too much desired to enjoy ease and plenty, when the King could have neither; and did think Poverty the most insup∣portable evil that could befal any Man in this world. He was then so weak that he could not have liv'd long; and when his head was cut off, very little blood follow'd.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Capel</HI> was then called; who walked through <HI>Westmin∣ster-</HI>Hall, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Capel.</NOTE> saluting such of his Friends and Acquaintance as he saw there, with a very serene Countenance, accompanied with his Friend D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mor∣ley;</HI> who had been with him from the time of his Sentence; but, at the soot of the Scaffold, the Soldiers stopping the D<SUP>r</SUP>, his Lordship took <MILESTONE N="50"/> his leave of him; and, embracing him, thanked him; and said, he should go no farther, having some apprehension that he might receive
<PB N="210" REF="2300"/>
some affront by that rude People after his death; the Chaplains who attended the two other Lords, being Men of the time, and the D<SUP>r</SUP> being well known to be most contrary.</P>
<P>ASSOON as his Lordship had ascended the <HI>Scaffold,</HI> he looked very vigorously about, and asked, <Q>“whether the other Lords had spoken” to the People with their Hats on?</Q> and being told, that <Q>“they were” bare;</Q> he gave his Hat to his Servant, and then with a clear and a strong voice, he said, <Q>“that he was brought thither to dye for doing that which he could not repent of: that he had been born, and bred under the Government of a King whom he was bound in Conscience <MILESTONE N="10"/> to obey; under Laws, to which he had been allways obedient; and in the bosom of a Church, which he thought the best in the world: that he had never violated his Faith to either of those, and was now condemn'd to dye against all the Laws of the Land; to which sen∣tence” he did submit.</Q></P>
<P>HE enlarged himself in commending <Q>“the great Virtue and Piety of the King, whom they had put to death; who was so just and so” merciful a Prince;</Q> and prayed to God, <Q>“to forgive the Nation that innocent Blood. Then he recommended to them the present King;”</Q> who, he told them, <Q>“was their true and their Lawful Soveraign; <MILESTONE N="20"/> and was worthy to be so: that he had the honour to have been some” years near his Person, and therefore he could not but know him well;</Q> and assured them, <Q>“that he was a Prince of great understanding, of an excellent Nature, of great Courage, an entire Lover of Justice, and of exemplary Piety: that he was not to be shaken in his Reli∣gion; and had all those Princely Virtues, which could make a Na∣tion” happy:</Q> <Q>and therefore advised them “to submit to his Govern∣ment, as the only means to preserve themselves, their Posterity, and” the Protestant Religion.</Q> And having, with great vehemence, recom∣mended it to them, after some prayers very devoutly pronounced upon <MILESTONE N="30"/> his Knees, he submitted himself, with an unparallel'd Christian Cou∣rage, to the fatal stroke, which depriv'd the Nation of the noblest Cham∣pion it had.</P>
<P>HE was a Man in whom the Malice of his Enemies could discover <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Capel<HI>'s Cha∣racter.</HI></NOTE> very few faults, and whom his Friends could not wish better accom∣plished; whom <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s own Character well described; and who indeed would never have been contented to have liv'd under that Go∣vernment. His Memory all Men loved and reverenced, though few follow'd his Example. He had allways liv'd in a State of great plen∣ty and general estimation, having a very noble Fortune of his own <MILESTONE N="40"/> by descent, and a fair Addition to it by his Marriage with an excel∣lent Wife, a Lady of very worthy Extraction, of great Virtue and Beauty, by whom he had a numerous Issue of both Sexes, in which he took great Joy and Comfort: so that no Man was more happy in all his Domestick Affairs; and he was so much the more happy, in that he thought himself most blessed in them.</P>
<P>AND yet the King's Honour was no sooner violated, and his just power invaded, than he threw all those blessings behind him; and having no other obligations to the Crown, than those which his own Honour and Conscience suggested to him, he frankly engaged his Per∣son <MILESTONE N="50"/> and his Fortune from the beginning of the Troubles, as many others did, in all Actions and Enterprises of the greatest hazard and danger;
<PB N="211" REF="2310"/>
and continued to the end, without ever making one false step, as few others did, though he had once, by the iniquity of a Faction, that then prevailed, an indignity put upon him that might have excused him for some remission of his former warmth. But it made no other impression upon him, than to be quiet and contented, whilst they would let him alone, and, with the same chearfulness, to obey the first Summons when he was called out; which was quickly after. In a word, he was a Man, that whoever shall, after Him, deserve best of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, he can never think himself undervalued, when he shall hear, that his Courage, Virtue, and Fidelity, is laid in the <MILESTONE N="10"/> ballance with, and compared to that of the Lord <HI>Capel.</HI></P>
<P>So ended the year one thousand six hundred forty eight; a year <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Conclusion and Character of the year</HI> 1648.</NOTE> of reproach and infamy above all years which had passed before it; a year of the highest dissimulation and hypocrisy, of the deepest Vil∣lainy and most bloody Treasons, that any Nation was ever cursed with, or under: a year, in which the Memory of all the Transactions ought to be rased out of all Records, lest, by the success of it, Atheism, In∣fidelity, and Rebellion, should be propagated in the world: a year, of which We may say, as the Historian said of the time of <HI>Domitian, Sicut vetus aetas vidit, quid ultimum in libertate esset, it a nos quid in servi∣tute;</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> or, as the same Writer says of a time not altogether so wicked, <HI>is habitus animorum fuit, ut pessimum facinus auderent pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ci, plures vellent, omnes paterentur.</HI></P>

The truth is, it can hardly be conceiv'd, with what a consternation this terrible News was receiv'd by all, even by the Common People of that Country. There was a Woman at the <HI>Hague,</HI> of the midling rank, who, being with Child, with the horror of the mention of it, fell into travel, and in it died. There could not be more Evidence of a general detestation, than there was, amongst all Men of what Quality soever.

All which was done before he heard from the Queen his Mother; who, notwithstanding the great Agony she was in, which without doubt was as great a passion of sorrow as she was able to sustain, wrote to the King, <Q>“that he could <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's first Mess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge to him.</NOTE> not do better, than to repair into <HI>France</HI> assoon as was possible, and, in the mean time, desired him, not to swear any Persons to be of his” Council, till She could speak with him.</Q> Whether it was, that she did not think those Persons to be enough at her Devotion; or that she would have them receive that honour upon Her recommendation.</P>
<P>THE King himself had no mind to go into <HI>France,</HI> where he thought <MILESTONE N="$0"/> he had not been treated with excess of courtesy; and he resolv'd to per∣form all filial respect towards the Queen his Mother, without such a condescension and resignation of himself, as she expected; and to avoid all eclarcisments upon that Subject, he heartily desired that any other Course might be found more Counsellable than that he should go into <HI>France.</HI> He himself liv'd with, and upon the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> who supplied him with all things necessary for his own Person, for his Mourn∣ing, and the like: but towards any other support for himself and his Family, his Majesty had not enough to maintain them one day: and there were very few of them, who could maintain themselves in the <MILESTONE N="30"/> most private way: and it was visible enough, that they should not be long able to reside in the <HI>Hague;</HI> where there was, at that very time, an Agent for the Parliament, <HI>Strickland;</HI> who had been there some years, but pretended then to reside there with his Wife (who was born in <HI>Holland</HI> of <HI>English</HI> Parents) and without any publick Character, though he was still under the same Credentials. And their Advertise∣ments from <HI>London</HI> assured them, that the Parliament had nominated one, who was presently to be sent as their Embassadour, or Envoy to the States, to give them an Account of their Affairs, and to invite them to enter into an Alliance with them. So that it was time to think of <MILESTONE N="40"/> some other Retreat for the King; and none appeared then so seasonable in their view, as <HI>Ireland;</HI> from whence they heard, <Q>“that Prince <HI>Ru∣pert</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nk<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of go∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Af∣fair<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ther<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at that t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e.</HI></NOTE> was arriv'd safely at <HI>Kinsale</HI> with the Fleet: that the Lord <HI>In∣chiquin</HI> had made a Cessation with the <HI>Irish,</HI> before the Lord Lieute∣nant came thither; and the <HI>Irish</HI> had deserted the Pope's Nuntio, who was driven away, and had embarked himself for <HI>France:</HI> that the Mar∣quis of <HI>Ormond</HI> was receiv'd by the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> with all the obe∣dience imaginable, by which he became entirely possessed of the whole Province of <HI>Munster;</HI> and that the Confederate Roman Catholicks had invited him to <HI>Kilkenny;</HI> where he had made a full Peace with them: <MILESTONE N="50"/> so that they were preparing an Army to march under his Command” against <HI>Dublin.</HI></Q> This News made them hope, that every day would im∣prove it so much, that it would be fit for the King to transport his own Person thither in the Spring.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="2350"/>
IN this conjuncture there arriv'd a Gentleman, one S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Joseph Dou∣glass,</HI> with a Letter from the Privy Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by which they sent his Majesty word that they had proclaim'd him King of <HI>Scotland;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King pro∣claim'd in</HI> Scotland; <HI>and Commissioners thence sent to him.</HI></NOTE> and sent him the Proclamation; and wish'd, <Q>“that he would prepare himself to repair into that his Kingdom; in order to which they would” speedily send another Invitation to him.</Q> And that Invitation arriv'd at the same time with some Commissioners deputed by the Council, and three or four Preachers sent from the Commissioners of the Kirk. The Proclamation indeed declar'd, <Q>“For that as much as the late King was, contrary to the Dissent, and Protestation of that Kingdom, remov'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> by a violent death, that, by the Lord's Blessing, there was left unto them a righteous Heir, and lawful Successor, <HI>Charles</HI> &amp;c. who was” become their true and lawful King;</Q> but upon condition of <Q>“his good behaviour, and strict observation of the Covenant, and his entertain∣ing no other Persons about him but such as were Godly Men, and” faithful to that obligation.</Q> A Proclamation so strangely worded, that, though it call'd him their King, manifested enough to him, that he was to be subject to Their determinations, in all the parts of his Govern∣ment. And the Commissioners, both Laity and Clergy, spoke no other Language; and saving that they bow'd their Bodies, and made low Re∣verences, <MILESTONE N="20"/> they appear'd more like Embassadors from a free State to an equal Ally, than like Subjects sent to their own Soveraign. At the same time, though not in the same Ship, arriv'd likewise from <HI>Scotland</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lanrick, <HI>now Duke</HI> Hamil∣ton, <HI>and</HI> Lau∣therdale, <HI>came to him also.</HI></NOTE> Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Lautherdale;</HI> the former not knowing, till he came into <HI>Holland,</HI> that he was Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> by the slaughter of his Elder Brother. But they two were so far from having any Autho∣rity from their Country, that they were fled from thence as proscrib'd Persons and Malefactors. The Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> after his departure from the <HI>Hague,</HI> in that discontent that is mention'd before, bent his Course for <HI>Scotland.</HI> But before he came thither, he was inform'd, <MILESTONE N="30"/> that the state of all things had been revers'd, and the Engagement de∣clar'd unlawful, and to what penalties himself was liable, if he should be taken. Whereupon, without suffering his Ship to go into any Port, he found means to send on shore to some Friends, and so to concert all things, that without being discover'd, the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> and some other Persons, liable to danger if they were found, put themselves on board the same Ship, and arriv'd in <HI>Holland</HI> about that time when the other Messengers from the State and from the Kirk came from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and when the News came of the Execution of Duke <HI>Ha∣milton.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREUPON the new Duke kept his Chamber for some days, without so much as waiting on the King; who sent a gracious Message to him to condole for the loss of his Brother; and all the Lords, and other Persons of Quality about the King, made their visits to him with all civility. This Duke was not inferior in Wisdom, and Parts of Un∣derstanding, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Character of this Duke</HI> Hamilton.</NOTE> to the wisest Man of that Nation, and was very much esteem'd by those who did not like the complying, and insinuating Na∣ture of his Brother. He was a Man of great honour, courage, and sin∣cerity in his Nature, and, which was a rare virtue in the Men of that time, was still the same Man he pretended to be; and had very much <MILESTONE N="50"/> to say in his own defence for the Errors he had run into; which he ac∣knowledg'd allways with great ingenuity, and abhorr'd the whole pro∣ceedings of his Country-men; and, at this time, brought a heart, and
<PB N="218" REF="2360"/>
affection clearer and less clogg'd with scruples and reservations, for the King's service, than any other of them did.</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Cromwell,</HI> at his being in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had left <HI>Argyle</HI> in full <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The condition of</HI> Scotland <HI>about this time.</HI></NOTE> Possession of the Government there, and had reduc'd, and disbanded all those who were in Arms against him, and promis'd him all necessary assistance to subdue those who should rise against him in that Kingdom for the future, and thereby compell'd the Committee of Estates to con∣vene, and summon the Parliament to assemble, which they had autho∣rity to do; and so he had suppress'd the Party of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> driven the Earl of <HI>Lanrick</HI> to hide himself in some obscure place, and condemn'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> the Engagement as unlawful and sinful, and all the Persons who advanc'd and promoted it, as Deserters of the Covenant, and so to stand excom∣municated, and not to be capable of serving in Parliament, or in the Council of Estate; so that he was sure to find no opposition in what∣soever he propos'd; yet, after the Parliament had serv'd him so far, when they heard that the Parliament in <HI>England</HI> was broken, and their freedom and Privileges were taken from them by the insolence, and power of the Army (which they perfectly hated and detested, and all those Sects and Libertinism they heard were introduc'd in Religion con∣trary to their Covenant, which <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself had promis'd should <MILESTONE N="20"/> be strictly observ'd) they begun to examine, what the obligations were which were incumbent upon them even by the Covenant it self. The delivery of the King's Person into the hands of the Parliament at <HI>New∣castle</HI> had been, in the instant it was done, the most unpopular, and un∣gracious act to the whole Nation of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that it had been ever guilty of, and to the Army they had then on foot, which took it self to be deeply wounded by the infamy of it, and was therefore quickly dis∣banded by the cunning of <HI>Argyle:</HI> and the universal indignation against that action was the principal incitement to that general Engagement with Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> that the honour of the Nation might in some de∣gree <MILESTONE N="30"/> be repair'd, or redeem'd. It was a gross oversight in the <HI>Hamil∣tonian</HI> Party, and discern'd then to be so by the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> that, upon that popular advantage, in which he would have found an univer∣sal concurrence, <HI>Argyle</HI> himself and all his Faction had not been totally suppress'd, for the redemption of the honour of their Country. But that Duke's politicks did not lie that way; and, so he might return to his old Post of favour in <HI>England,</HI> of which he made little doubt, he was not willing to give a new beginning to those bloody Enterprises in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> which, he knew well, used not to be short-liv'd in that Climate after once begun, but had allways fresh sacrifices of Blood to perpetuate <MILESTONE N="40"/> the memory of them.</P>
<P>THEY had no sooner heard of the erection of a High Court of Justice, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commissioners had been sent from the Par∣liament of</HI> Scotland <HI>be∣fore the death of the King to the Parlia∣ment of</HI> Eng∣land.</NOTE> of a purpose of trying the King for his Life, than, notwithstanding all the Artifices <HI>Argyle</HI> could use, they were all in a flame. As well the Assembly of the Kirk, as the Parliament, renew'd the sense they allways had of reproach in the delivery of his Person, of which the present danger he was in was the consequence. And the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> had had too deep a share in that wickedness, to endure the shock of a new dispute, and inquisition upon that subject; and therefore gave not the least oppo∣sition to their passion; but seem'd equally concern'd in the honour of the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Nation, to prosecute an high Expostulation with those of <HI>England,</HI> for the breach of faith, and the promises, which had been made for the safety, and preservation of the King's Person, at the time he was deliver'd up;
<PB N="219" REF="2370"/>
and therefore propos'd, <Q>“that Commissioners should be forthwith sent to the Parliament at <HI>London,</HI> to require the performance of what they had promis'd, and to enter their dissent, and protestation against all their Proceedings against their King, in the name of the Kingdom” of <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> And the Earl of <HI>Lothian,</HI> and two others, who were known to be most zealous for the Covenant, and most enrag'd and in∣cens'd against the proceedings of the Army, were made choice of, and presently sent away, that they might make all possible hast to <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI> and were, immediately upon their arrival, to demand permission to wait upon the King, wherever he should be, and to receive from <MILESTONE N="10"/> him such farther directions, as he should judge necessary for his ser∣vice.</P>
<P>THUS far <HI>Argyle</HI> could not oppose; and therefore was as zealous as any Man to advance it; knowing that the particular Instructions must be prepar'd by a less number of Men, and not subjected to the examina∣tion and perusal of so many. And in those, he was sure to prevent any inconvenient powers to be granted to the Commissioners, with whom he had credit enough, having made the Earl of <HI>Lothian</HI> Secretary of State, in the place of the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> and the other two being (however sollicitous for the due observation of the Covenant, as he himself like∣wise <MILESTONE N="20"/> pretended to be) known to be most averse from the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Party. <Q>Their private Instructions were, “that they should not, in their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their private Instructions <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Party.</NOTE> enlargements and aggravations upon the subject of their Message, seem to take notice, or to imply, that any violence had been us'd against the Parliament, or any Member of it: that they should be so short in their expostulations, that they gave no occasion of offence: that no∣thing should fall from them justifying the King's proceedings, nor in approbation of the late engagement, or which might import a breach, or give, or be ground of a new War: they should urge, that the Par∣liament would delay to meddle with the King's Person, according to <MILESTONE N="30"/> their several promises, and Declarations at <HI>New castle,</HI> and at <HI>Holmby:</HI> that if they should proceed to sentence against the King, then they were to enter their dissent and protest, that this Kingdom may be free from the miseries which will inevitably follow, without offering in their reasons, that Princes are exempted from Trial and Justice: that none in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> hath, or had any hand in the proceedings against the King, or Members of Parliament in <HI>England.</HI> If they proceed, then to shew the calamities that will follow, and how grievous it must be to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> considering his being deliver'd up at <HI>New castle:</HI> That if the Papers which were in∣titul'd <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>the Agreement of the People,</HI> appear'd to be countenanc'd, and should import any thing concerning the Processing of the Prince, or changing the fundamental Government of the Kingdom, they should enter their dissent: that they should alter those their Instructions, and manage their Trust therein, according to the advice they should re∣ceive from their Friends there: that they should prosecute their In∣structions concerning the Covenant, and against any Toleration: that they should shew, that the King's last Concessions were unsatisfactory” to those Propositions which they had made in point of Religion.</Q></P>
<P>THESE were their private Instructions; and who those Friends at <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>London</HI> were, by whose advice they were to alter their Instructions, or manage their Trust therein, can be undestood of no other Men but <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and young S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane;</HI> with whom <HI>Argyle</HI> held close
<PB N="220" REF="2380"/>
Correspondence. The Commissioners observ'd their Instructions very faithfully, and after the King had been twice brought before the high Court of Justice, they gave in their very calm Protestation; in which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon the King's Trial they enter their Prote∣station and Dissent.</NOTE> they put them in mind, <Q>“that they had, near three Weeks before, re∣presented to them what Endeavours had been us'd for taking away the King's life, and for the change of the fundamental Government of the Kingdom, and introducing a sinful and ungodly Toleration in matters of Religion; and that therein they had express'd their thoughts, and fears of the dangerous consequences that might follow thereupon; and that they had also earnestly press'd, that there might be no farther <MILESTONE N="10"/> proceeding against his Majestie's Person, which would certainly conti∣nue the great distractions of the Kingdom, and involve them in many evils, troubles, and confusions; but that, by the free counsels of both Houses of Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> and with the advice and consent of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> such course might be taken in relation to the King, as might be for the good and happiness of both Kingdoms; both having an unquestionable, and undeniable right in his Person, as King of both; which duly consider'd, they had reason to hope, that it would have given a stop to all farther proceedings against his Ma∣jestie's Person. But now understanding that after the imprisonment, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and exclusion of divers Members of the House of Commons, and without, and against the consent of the House of Peers, by a single Act of their own, and Their's alone, power was given to certain Persons of their own Members, of the Army, and some others, to proceed against his Majestie's Person, in order whereunto he had been brought before that extraordinary new Court; they did therefore in the name of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for their vindication from false asper∣sions and calumnies, declare, that though they were not satisfied with his Majestie's late concessions, in the Treaty at <HI>Newport</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> especially in the matters of Religion, and were resolv'd not to <MILESTONE N="30"/> crave his Restoration to his Government, before satisfaction should be given by him to that Kingdom; yet they did all unanimously with one voice, not one Member excepted, disclaim the least knowledge of, or occasion to the late Proceedings of the Army here against the King; and did sincerely profess that it would be a great grief to their hearts, and lie heavy upon their Spirits, if they should see the trusting his Majestie's Person to the two Houses of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> to be made use of to his ruin, contrary to the declar'd Intentions of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and solemn Professions of the Kingdom of <HI>England:</HI> and to the end that it might be manifest to the World, how <MILESTONE N="40"/> much they did abominate and detest so horrid a design against his Maje∣stie's Person, they did, in the name of the Parliament and Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> declare their dissent from the said Proceedings, and the taking away of his Majestie's life; protesting, that as they were altogether free from the same, so they might be free from all the miseries, evil consequences, and calamities, that might follow thereupon to the dis∣tracted” Kingdoms.</Q></P>
<P>WHOEVER considers the wariness in the wording, and timing this Protestation, the best end whereof could be no other than the keeping the King allways in Prison, and so governing without him in both King∣doms <MILESTONE N="50"/> (which was thought to have been the purpose and agreement of <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Argyle</HI> when they parted) must conclude that both the Commissioners, and they who sent them, labour'd and consider'd more,
<PB N="221" REF="2390"/>
what they were to say in the future, than what they were to do to pre∣vent the present mischief they seem'd to apprehend. And the Parlia∣ment best knew their temper, when they deferr'd taking notice of their Protestation, till after they had executed their execrable Villainy; and then they sent them an Answer that might suit with all their palates. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment after the King's Murther send their Answer to it.</NOTE> <Q>They said, “they had heretofore told them, what power this Nation had in the fundamentals of Government: that if <HI>Scotland</HI> had not the same power and liberty, as they went not about to confine Them, so they would not be limited by them, but leaving them to act in Their's as they should see cause, they resolv'd to maintain their own liber∣ties <MILESTONE N="10"/> as God should enable them. And as they were very far from im∣posing upon them, so they should not willingly suffer impositions” from them, whilst God gave them strength or lives to oppose them.</Q> <Q>They said, “the Answer they made to their first and second Letter was, that after a long and serious deliberation of their own intrinsical power, and trust (deriv'd to them by the Providence of God, through the delegation of the People) and upon the like considerations of what themselves, and the whole Nation had suffer'd from the misgovern∣ment, and Tyranny of that King, both in Peace, and by the Wars, and considering, how fruitless, and full of danger and prejudice the <MILESTONE N="20"/> many Addresses to him for Peace had been, and being conscious how much they had provoked and tempted God, by the neglect of the im∣partial execution of Justice, in relation to the innocent Blood spilt and mischief done in the late Wars, they had proceeded in such a course of Justice against that Man of Blood, as they doubted not the just God (who is no respecter of Persons) did approve and would counte∣nance with his blessings upon the Nation; and though perhaps they might meet with many difficulties before their Liberties and Peace were settled, yet they hoped they should be preserv'd from confu∣sion, by the good Will of him who dwelt in the bush, which burn'd, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and was not consumed; and that the course they had taken with the late King, and meant to follow towards others the Capital Enemies of their Peace, was, they hoped, that which would be for the good and happiness of both Nations; of which if that of <HI>Scotland</HI> would think to make use, and vindicate their own liberty and freedom (which lay before them, if they gave them not away) they would be ready to give them all neighbourly and friendly Assistance in the establishing thereof; and desired them to take it into their most serious considera∣tion, before they espoused that quarrel, which could bring them no other advantage than the entailing upon Them, and their Posterities, <MILESTONE N="40"/> a lasting War, with all the miseries which attended it, and slavery” under a Tyrant and his Issue.</Q></P>
<P>IT cannot be denied, but that <HI>Scotland</HI> had by this a fair Invitation to have made themselves a poor Republick, under the Shelter and Pro∣tection of the other, that was already become terrible. But the Com∣missioners, who well knew how unsuitable such a change would be to the constitution of their Government, and that they might be welcome to their own Country, whither they were now to repair, made a reply <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commis∣sioners reply, and are im∣prison'd, but afterwards freed.</NOTE> to this Answer with more Courage than they had yet expressed; for which, notwithstanding their Qualification, they were imprison'd by the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Parliament; and, upon new Instance from <HI>Scotland,</HI> set at liberty af∣terwards.</P>

MATTERS being reduced to this State, the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> could <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Argyle <HI>clogs the Act for Proclaim∣ing of the King, with a Clause for the Covenant.</HI></NOTE> not hinder the new King's being acknowledged, and proclaimed King, nor from being invited home; which since he could not obstruct, it would be his Master-piece to clog the Proclamation it self with such conditions as might terrify the new King from accepting the invitation; and therefore he caused this Clause to be inserted in the Body of the Proclamation it self, <Q>“because his Majesty is bound, by the Law of God and the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, to rule in righteousness and equity to the honour of God, and the good of Religion, and the Wealth of the People; it is hereby declared, that before he be admitted <MILESTONE N="10"/> to the Exercise of his Royal power, he shall give satisfaction to this Kingdom in those things which concern the security of Religion, the unity betwixt the Kingdoms, and the good and Peace of this King∣dom, according to the national Covenant and solemn League and Co∣venant; for which end, they were resolv'd, with all possible expedi∣tion,” to make their humble and earnest Address to his Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was the Proclamation that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Joseph Douglass</HI> brought to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and the Subject upon which the Commissioners were to invite his Majesty to go for <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Instructions were very suitable to the Proclamation: and at the same time when the Commissioners came <MILESTONE N="$$"/> from thence, <HI>Middleton,</HI> and some other Officers, who had been in their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Middleton <HI>as∣sembles some Troops in</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> last Army, hearing that the Prince was proclaim'd King, thought it was seasonable to put themselves into a posture to serve him upon his ar∣rival; and so assembled some of those Troops which had formerly serv'd under them in the North of <HI>Scotland;</HI> whereupon <HI>David Lesley</HI> was appointed forthwith, with a Party of Horse and Foot, against those Royalists, whom they knew to be real Assertors of his Cause, without any other interest or design than of their performing their Duties, as Loyal Subjects ought to do: and the Kirk at the same time declared, <Q>“that, before the King should be receiv'd, albeit they had declared his <MILESTONE N="$$"/> Right by Succession, he should first sign the Covenant, submit to the Kirk's censure, renounce the Sins of his Father's House, and the ini∣quity” of his Mother, with other things of the like Nature.</Q> All which Information arriv'd at the same time with the Commissioners, that they who were about the King, might not be too much exalted with their Master's being declared King of one of his three Kingdoms. And it was very manifest, by all that passed then and afterwards, that the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> meant only to satisfy the People, in declaring that they had a King, without which they could not be satisfied, but that such con∣ditions should be put upon him, as he knew, he would not submit to; <MILESTONE N="$$"/> and so he should be able, with the concurrence of the <HI>Kirk,</HI> to govern the Kingdom, till, by <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s assistance and advice, he might re∣verse that little approach he had made towards Monarchy by Proclaim∣ing a King.</P>
<P>IT was a great misfortune to the King, and which allways attends <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Factions in the King's Court with reference to</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> Courts which labour under great wants and necessities, that, whilst the greatest union imaginable amongst the few friends he had was necessary, and of too little power to buoy him up from the distresses which over∣whelm'd him, there was yet so great a Faction, and Animosity amongst them, that destroyed any the most probable design that could offer it <MILESTONE N="$$"/> self; as it now fell out with reference to <HI>Scotland,</HI> which, if united, might yet be able to give reputation at least, if not a vigorous Assistance to the King's Interest.</P>

The truth is, he was somewhat elated with the great Actions he had done; which, upon his first coming to <HI>Paris,</HI> he caused to be published in a full Re∣lation in Latin, dedicated to the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> in which, as his own <MILESTONE N="10"/> Person, Courage, and Conduct, was well extolled, so the Reputation of all the rest of that Nation (upon whose Affections the Queen at that time depended) was exceedingly undervalued and depressed; which obliged the Queen, and the Prince, to look less graciously upon him; which he could not bear without expressing much disturbance at it. He was then a Man of <HI>eclat,</HI> had many Servants, and more Officers, who had serv'd under him, and came away with him, all whom he expected the Queen should enable him to maintain with some Lustre, by a li∣beral assignation of Moneys.

So that after a long attendance, and some overtures made by him to Cardinal <HI>Ma∣zarin,</HI> to raise an Army for the Service of that King, which he did not think were receiv'd with that regard his great name deserv'd, the Mar∣quis left <HI>France,</HI> and made a journey into <HI>Germany</HI> to the Emperour's <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence goes in∣to</HI> Germany.</NOTE> Court, desiring to see Armies, till he could come to command them; and was return'd to <HI>Brussels,</HI> about the time that the Prince came back into <HI>Holland</HI> with the Fleet; and lay there very privately, and as <HI>in∣cognito,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> for some time, till he heard of the Murther of the late King. Then he sent to the King with the tender of his Service, and to know, <Q>“if his Majesty thought his attendance upon him might bring any pre∣judice to his Majesty; and if so, that he would send over the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer to <HI>Sevenbergh,</HI> a Town in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he was at present to expect him, and had matters to communicate to” him of much importance to his Majestie's Service.</Q> Whether he did this out of modesty, and that he might first know his Majestie's pleasure, or out of some vanity, that he might seem to come to the King, after the coldness he had met at <HI>Paris,</HI> by a kind of Treaty, the King com∣manded <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Chancellor presently to go to him; and <Q>“if he could, with∣out” exasperating him</Q> (which he had no mind to do) wished, <Q>“he might be perswaded rather for some time to suspend his coming to the <HI>Hague,”</HI> than presently to appear there;</Q> which was an injunction very dis∣agreeable to the Chancellor; who in his judgement believ'd his Majesty should bid him very welcome, and prefer him before any other of that Nation in his esteem.</P>
<P>THE suddain violent frost, which shut up all the Rivers in less than four and twenty hours, kept them at that time from meeting; but, within a short time after, and upon another Message from him, they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor of the Exc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣quer sent t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er with him in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l∣lage near the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> met at a Village three or four miles off the <HI>Hague;</HI> whither the Mar∣quis was come. The Chancellor had never seen him from the time he had left <HI>Oxford,</HI> when he seem'd to have very much modesty, and
<PB N="224" REF="2420"/>
deference to the opinion and judgement of other Men. But he had, since that time, done so many signal Actions, won so many Battles, and in truth made so great a noise in the world, that there appear'd no less alteration to be in his humour, and discourse, than there had been in his Fortune. He seem'd rather to have desired that interview, that he might the better know what advice to give the King, and how to make a Party that would be fast to him, than out of any doubt that his presence would not be acceptable to his Majesty. There was yet no news from <HI>Scotland</HI> since the Murther of the King, and he seem'd to think of nothing but that the King would presently send him thither <MILESTONE N="10"/> with some Forces, to prepare the way for himself to follow after. They spent that night together in conference, and the next morning the Chan∣cellor prevailed with him, with great difficulty, that he would stay in that place, which did not abound with all things desirable, or some where else, until he might give him Notice, what the King's sense should be of the matters discoursed between them; insisting principally, <Q>“that, if his going into <HI>Scotland</HI> should be thought presently to be ne∣cessary, it would then be as necessary, that he should not be taken no∣tice” of publickly to have been with the King: with which reason he seem'd satisfied;</Q> and promised <Q>“not to come to the <HI>Hague,</HI> till he should” <MILESTONE N="$0"/> first receive advice from the Chancellor.</Q> But when he heard of the Commissioner's being come from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of the other Lords ar∣rival there, he would no longer defer his Journey thither, but came to the <HI>Hague</HI> well attended by Servants and Officers, and presented him∣self <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis comes to the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> to the King; who receiv'd him with a very good countenance.</P>
<P>THERE were at this time in the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Commissioners who came from the Council and the Kirk to invite the King into <HI>Scotland,</HI> or rather to let him know upon what terms he might come thither, Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and others of the Nobility of that Faction, who were now as odious, and as much persecuted by <MILESTONE N="30"/> that Party, which then govern'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which in that manner invited the King, as any Men were who had serv'd the King from the beginning. There was also the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose,</HI> with more of the Nobility, as the Earls of <HI>Seaford,</HI> and <HI>Kinoul,</HI> and others, who ad∣her'd to <HI>Mountrose,</HI> and believ'd his clear Spirit to be most like to advance the King's Service. Of these three Parties, it might reasonably <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parties of the</HI> Scots <HI>now at the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> have been hoped that the two last, being equally persecuted by the power that govern'd, should have been easily united to have suppress'd the other. But it was a business too hard for the King to bring to pass; and he could as easily have perswaded the Parliament to reject <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> as the Lords of the <HI>Engagement,</HI> and those who had joyn'd with Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> to be reconciled to <HI>Mountrose:</HI> so that when the King hoped to have drawn all the <HI>Scotish</HI> Nobility together, to have con∣sulted what Answer he should give to the Messages he had receiv'd from the Council and the Kirk, with which they themselves were enough offended, those Lords of the <HI>Engagement</HI> did not only refuse to meet with the Lord <HI>Mountrose,</HI> but, assoon as he came into the room where they were, though his Majesty himself was present, they immediately withdrew, and left the room; and had the confidence to desire the King, <Q>“that the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> (whom they called <HI>James Graham)</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/> might be forbidden to come into his Majesty's Presence, or Court, because he stood excommunicated by the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and de∣graded” and forfeited by the Judicatory of that Kingdom.</Q>
<PB N="225" REF="2430"/>
This proposition and demand they made confidently in writing under their hands, and abounded so much in this sense, that a learned and worthy <HI>Scotish</HI> Divine, D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Wishart,</HI> who was then Chaplain to a <HI>Scotish</HI> Regiment in the service of the States, being appointed to preach before the King on the <HI>Sunday</HI> following, they formally besought the King, <Q>“that he would not suffer him to preach before him, nor to come into his presence, because he stood excommunicated by the Kirk of <HI>Scot∣land,”</HI></Q> for having refus'd to take the Covenant; though it was known, that the true cause of the displeasure they had against that Divine was, that they knew he was the Author of the excellent Relation of the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Lord <HI>Mountrose</HI>'s Actions in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This carriage and behaviour of those Lords appear'd ridiculous to all sober Men, that any Men should have the presumption to accuse those who had serv'd the King with that fidelity, and were only branded by those Rebellious Judicatories for having perform'd their duties of Allegiance, and to demand that the King himself should condemn them for having serv'd his Father: which made those of his Majestie's Council full of indignation at their insolence, and his Majesty himself declar'd his being offended, by using the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> with the more countenance, and hearing the Doctor preach with the more attention. But from this very absurd be∣haviour, <MILESTONE N="20"/> besides his Majestie's desire being frustrated, of receiving the joynt advice of the Nobility of that Kingdom in an affair that so much concern'd himself and them; and besides the displeasure, and distance, that it caused between them and the King's Council (who thought the <HI>Scotish</HI> Lords might as reasonably move the King, that They might be remov'd, who lay under the same brand, and reproaches in <HI>England</HI> for adhering to the Crown, as the other did in <HI>Scotland)</HI> the King had reason to be troubled with another apprehension, which was, that the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> (who could not be ignorant of any thing which the other Persons said or did) would, out of just indignation, take re∣venge <MILESTONE N="30"/> upon those Persons whom he contemn'd too much; and so that the Peace of the Country, where his Majesty was but a Guest, would be violated by his Subjects, as it were in his own sight; which would make his absence from thence the more desirable.</P>
<P>HE, to whom this unreasonable Animosity was most imputed, and who indeed was the great fomenter, and Prosecutor of it, was the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale;</HI> whose fiery Spirit was not capable of any moderation. One of the Council conferring one day with him upon a Subject that could not put him into passion, and so being in a very fair conversation, desir'd him <Q>“to inform him, what foul Offence the Marquis of <HI>Mon∣trose</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> had ever committed, that should hinder those to make a conjun∣ction with him, who, in respect of the Rebels, were in as desperate a condition as himself, and who could not more desire the King's re∣stitution” than he did.</Q> The Earl told him calmly enough, <Q>“that he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Earl of</HI> Lau∣therdale<HI>'s dis∣course against</HI> Mountrose▪</NOTE> could not imagine, or conceive the barbarities and inhumanities <HI>Moun∣trose</HI> was guilty of, in the time he made a War in <HI>Scotland;</HI> that he never gave Quarter to any Man, but pursued all the Advantages he ever got, with the utmost outrage and cruelty: that he had in one Battle kill'd fifteen hundred of one family, of the <HI>Campbels,</HI> of the blood and name of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and that he had utterly rooted out several” <MILESTONE N="50"/> Names, and entire noble Families.</Q> The other told him, <Q>“that it was the nature and condition of that War, that Quarter was given on nei∣ther side; that those Prisoners which were taken by the <HI>Scots,</HI> as once
<PB N="226" REF="2440"/>
they did take some Persons of honour of his Party, were afterwards in cold blood hang'd reproachfully, which was much worse than if” they had been kill'd in the field;</Q> and ask'd him, <Q>“if <HI>Mountrose</HI> had ever caused any Man to dye in cold blood, or after the Battle was ended; since what was done in it <HI>flagrante,</HI> was more to be imputed” to the fierceness of his Soldiers, than to his want of humanity.</Q> The Earl confess'd, <Q>“that he did not know he was guilty of any thing but” what was done in the field;</Q> but concluded with more passion, <Q>“that his behaviour there was so savage, that <HI>Scotland</HI> would never forgive” him.</Q> And in other Company, where the same Subject was debated, <MILESTONE N="10"/> he swore with great passion, <Q>“that though he wish'd nothing more in this world than to see the King restor'd, he had much rather that he should never be restor'd, than that <HI>James Graham</HI> should be permitted” to come into the Court: of which Declaration of his the King was in∣form'd by <HI>William Legg</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Armorer,</HI> who were both present at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and in the Company, when he said it.</Q></P>
<P>THERE was at that time in the <HI>Hague</HI> the Lord <HI>Newburgh,</HI> who, after the Murther of the late King, was compell'd together with his Wife, the Lady <HI>Aubigney,</HI> to fly out of <HI>England, Cromwell</HI> every day making discoveries of correspondencies which had been between the <MILESTONE N="$$"/> King and them. And thereupon they made an escape from thence, and came to the <HI>Hague.</HI> That Lord having been too young to have had a part in the former War, had been then sent, by his Majestie's direction, to be bred in <HI>France;</HI> from whence he return'd not till his Majesty was in the hands of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; and from that time he perform'd all the Offices of fidelity, and duty to the King, that a generous and wor∣thy Person could find any opportunity for: with which his Majesty was abundantly satisfied and pleased: and he now transported himself and his Wife into <HI>Holland,</HI> that he might leave her there, and himself attend the King in any Expedition. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THIS Lady was a Woman of a very great Wit, and most trusted and conversant in those Intrigues, which at that time could be best ma∣nag'd and carried on by Ladies, who with less jealousy could be seen in all Companies: and so she had not been a stranger to the most secret transactions with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and had much conversation with the Lord <HI>Lanrick,</HI> during the time the King was at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and whilst he stay'd afterwards in <HI>London,</HI> when the King was imprison'd in the Isle of <HI>Wight;</HI> and being now both in the <HI>Hague,</HI> they had much conver∣sation together. She had likewise had long acquaintance, and friend∣ship with one of the Council, who, she knew, had been as much trusted <MILESTONE N="40"/> as any by the Father, and was believ'd to have credit with the present King. She lamented those Divisions amongst the <HI>Scots,</HI> which every Body spoke of, and every Body knew the disorder they produc'd in the King's Councils; and said, <Q>“she desir'd nothing more, than that there” were a good understanding between Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and Him;</Q> which, she said, <Q>“she was sure would easily be, if they two had but once a” frank conference together.</Q> The other, who indeed had an esteem for the Duke, seem'd very desirous of it: and she thereupon told him, that <Q>“the Duke had express'd to her, that he would be willing to embrace” the occasion: and it was so concerted, that within a day or two, they <MILESTONE N="50"/> met as by chance at her Lodgings.</Q> And she so dextrously introduc'd them to a civility towards each other, and to express their Inclinations to a mutual freedom, that after an hours general conversation there,
<PB N="227" REF="2450"/>
to which she left them, and went her self abroad, they parted with fair professions of future good Will; and the other promised to visit the Duke the next morning early, that they might have the more time without being interrupted, and he was with him accordingly, and found him in his bed. They continued together near two hours, the Duke having commanded his Servant to tell any who came to visit him, that he was asleep. <Q>The other, spoke of “the Proclamation, and the man∣ner <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Conference be∣tween Duke</HI> Hamilton <HI>and an</HI> English <HI>Privy Coun∣sellor concern∣ing the Af∣fairs of</HI> Scot∣land.</NOTE> of inviting the King into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of the strange spirit that possessed those who govern'd there, and perswaded them to imagine it possible, that the King could ever be prevailed with to take the Co∣venant, <MILESTONE N="10"/> or that it could be of Advantage to him to do so; since it could not but much alienate the Affections of all that Party in <HI>England</HI> that had serv'd his Father, upon whom he ought chiefly to depend” for his Restoration to the Government of that Kingdom.</Q> Then he spoke of <Q>“the differences and jealousies which were between those of that Nation who had an equal desire to serve the King, and seem'd to be equally prosecuted by the Party that now prevailed, which had” excluded both;</Q> and wish'd <Q>“that some Expedient might be found out to unite all those; and particularly that his Grace and the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> might be reconciled; towards which, he said, he was sure <MILESTONE N="20"/> that the Marquis had great inclination, and had allways esteem'd him a Man of honour; which appear'd by the book which was publish'd, where he was allways worthily mention'd, though he had not dealt so” well with many others.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the Duke had heard him with very civil attention, he told him as to the first part, <Q>“concerning the Proclamation, and the man∣ner of inviting the King to come to them, he was not to make any other judgement by it, than only of the Person of the Marquis of <HI>Argyle;</HI> who, with the Assistance of some few Ministers, and others his Creatures, did at present govern: that <HI>Argyle</HI> well knew there <MILESTONE N="30"/> was an absolute necessity, in respect of the whole People, to proclaim the King after the murther of his Father; and therefore he could find no other way to keep him from coming thither, but by clogging the Proclamation and Message with those unworthy Expressions, which might deter him from putting himself into their hands; which <HI>Ar∣gyle</HI> did not wish he should do, because in his absence he was sure he should govern all, being well agreed with <HI>Cromwell</HI> how the Govern∣ment should be carried; and so the King might be kept out, <HI>Crom∣well</HI> would support him against all other Parties; but that they both knew well enough, that if his Majesty were once there, the whole” <MILESTONE N="40"/> Nation would stick to him and obey him.</Q> <Q>He confess'd, “that there was generally so great a superstition for the Covenant, that whoso∣ever should speak against it for the present, would lose all credit, though he did acknowledge it had done much mischief, and would do” more whilst it should be insisted upon;</Q> but, he said, <Q>“that must be a work of time, and an effect of the King's Government; which would find it necessary, in many other respects, to lessen the power of the Ministers; which being lessen'd, the reverence of the Covenant would quickly fall too; and till then He, and all Men, must have patience.”</Q> <Q>For the second, he said, “he wish'd heartily that there could be a <MILESTONE N="50"/> union of all Parties which desired the King's Restoration, and that the Animosity against the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> might be extinguished. For his own part, that he had only one quarrel against him, which
<PB N="228" REF="2460"/>
was that, by his unjust calumnies and prosecution, he had driven him into Rebellion; which nothing else could have done. And for that he allways asked God forgiveness from his heart, and desired nothing more than to repair his fault by losing his life for the King; and would, with all his heart, joyn to morrow with the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose,</HI> in carrying on the King's Service, though he did believe, in that con∣juncture, the animosity against the Marquis was so great, that if he should declare such an inclination, all his own Friends would fall from” him, and abhor him.</Q> He said, <Q>“his own condition was very hard; for that having been allways bred up in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for <MILESTONE N="10"/> which he had a great reverence, he was forced to comply with the Covenant; which he perfectly detested, and looked upon it as the ruin of his Nation; and would be as glad as any Man of a good opportu∣nity” to declare against it.</Q> <Q>But, said he, “I dare not say this; and if” I did, I should have no power or credit to serve the King.</Q> <Q>There is, said he, “a very worthy Gentleman, who lodges in this House, the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> my Friend and my Kinsman; who, upon my Con∣science, loves me heartily; and yet I dare say nothing of this to him, either Against the Covenant, or For the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose:</HI> and, if I should, I believe he would rather choose to kill me, than to joyn <MILESTONE N="20"/> with me: so much he is transported with prejudice in both these par∣ticulars, and so incapable to hear reason upon either of those Argu∣ments, though, in all other things, few men have a better Understand∣ing,” or can discourse more reasonably.</Q></P>
<P>WHILST they continued in all possible freedom in this conference, the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who it seems was inform'd of the other's be∣ing there, came in his Night-Gown into the Chamber, and so broke off the discourse. The other, after sitting some time in general Conversa∣tion, departed. And there continued afterwards all civility between the Duke and him. <Q>But as himself told the Lady <HI>Aubigney,</HI> who shortly <MILESTONE N="30"/> after died there, “he could not, without giving jealousy to his Friend <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> which he had no mind to do, spend so much time with” the other in private as he could have been willing to have done: and the death of that Lady lessen'd the opportunities.</Q></P>
<P>IN this unsteady and irresolute condition of the King's Council, it was very manifest, that, how long soever his Majesty should defer the resolution, to what place he would remove, he should not be able to stay long in the place were he was. The States, especially those of <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> let fall somewhat every day in their Councils, and Consultations, <Q>“that the King's residing in the <HI>Hague</HI> would be very inconvenient to” <MILESTONE N="40"/> them;</Q> and it was the great Interest of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> not without much dexterity, that kept the States from sending a Message directly to his Majesty, to desire him, <Q>“that he would depart from that” Country, assoon as he could.</Q> And there happen'd an Accident at this time, which made the resolution necessary, and would inevitably have drawn on that Message, which had yet been kept back.</P>
<P>IT was touched before, that there was a purpose at <HI>London,</HI> to send over an Envoy from thence into <HI>Holland,</HI> to prepare the way for a far∣ther good Intelligence, and Negotiation, which might end in a firm Peace, and a reciprocal Alliance between the two Republicks. To that <MILESTONE N="50"/> purpose one <HI>Dorislaus,</HI> a D<SUP>r</SUP> in the Civil Law, was named; who, being born in <HI>Delphi</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> had been bred at <HI>Leyden,</HI> and afterwards liv'd long in <HI>London,</HI> having been receiv'd into <HI>Gresham</HI> College as a
<PB N="229" REF="2470"/>
Professor in one of those Chairs which are endow'd for publick Lectures in that Society, and had been, from the beginning of the troubles, in the Exercise of the Judge Advocate's Office in the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>'s Ar∣my. In this conjuncture this Man arriv'd at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and took his Lodging in a House where strangers used to repair, and were accom∣modated till they provided otherwise for their better accommodation. Whilst he was at Supper, the same Evening that he came to the Town, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dorislaus, <HI>an Agent of the Parliament, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lled at the</HI> Hague <HI>by so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> Scotish <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en.</HI></NOTE> in Company of many others who used to eat there, half a do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en Gen∣tlemen enter'd the room with their Swords drawn, and required those who were at the Table <Q>“not to stir; for that there was no harm intended <MILESTONE N="10"/> to any but the Agent who came from the Rebels in <HI>England,</HI> who” had newly murther'd their King.</Q> And one of them, who knew <HI>Do∣rislaus,</HI> pulled him from the Table, and killed him at his feet: and there∣upon they all put up their Swords, and walked leisurely out of the House, leaving those who were in the room, in much amazement and consternation. Though all who were engaged in the Enterprise, went quietly away, and so out of the Town, insomuch as no one of them was ever apprehended, or called in Question, yet they kept not their own counsel so well (believing they had done a very Heroick act) but that it was generally known they were all <HI>Scotish</HI> Men, and most of <MILESTONE N="20"/> them Servants, or Dependents upon the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose.</HI></P>
<P>THE King was exceedingly troubled and perplexed with this Acci∣dent, which he could not foresee, and easily discern'd that it would be applied to his prejudice; and that the States could not but highly re∣sent it, in many respects; that the Man who was killed, was in truth their own Subject, and imployed to them, as a publick Minister▪ by those with whom they had no mind to have any Quarrel. Upon all which his Majesty concluded, that his presence there, would quickly appear more unacceptable than ever: besides, that there had been the same night some quarrels, and fighting in the Streets between some <MILESTONE N="30"/> Servants of the King, and some Gentlemen of the Town; in which a Son of one of the States was dangerously hurt, though he recover'd afterwards.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied but that the States proceeded upon these disor∣ders, to which they had not been accustom'd, with great gravity, and more than ordinary respect to the King. They were highly offended with what was past, and sensible what expostulations, and clamour for Justice they must expect, and sustain from <HI>England,</HI> and what reproaches they must undergo for suffering all those who had been guilty of such a Crime, to escape the Ministers of Justice; which could not but be im∣puted <MILESTONE N="40"/> to them, as a great scandal to their Government: Yet they pro∣ceeded very slowly in their Inquisition, and with such formalities as were usual (and which could bring no prejudice to the Offenders; who were either gone out of their Dominions, or concealed themselves in other Towns, where the same formalities were to be used, if they were discover'd) and without so much reflection upon the King, as if they believ'd that the guilty Persons had any relation to his Service: yet they took notice of <Q>“the Multitude of Strangers which were in the Town, and how impossible it would be for them to preserve the Peace,” <MILESTONE N="50"/> and good Government thereof, if such resort were not restrain'd.</Q> They aggravated exceedingly <Q>“the indignity that had been offer'd to the State it self, in the attempt that had been made upon a Person under Their Protection, and for whose safety the Publick saith was, upon the”
<PB N="230" REF="2480"/>
matter, engag'd;</Q> with infinuation enough, <Q>“that it would be fit for” the King to remove from thence.</Q> Of all which his Majesty receiving advertisement, he thought it better himself to give them notice of his purpose to leave them, than to expect a plain Injunction from them to do so. He found this the more necessary to be done, since from the time that the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners were come thither, they had taken great pains to infuse into the opinions of that People, <Q>“that they were sent from the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that was entirely and unanimously at his Majestie's disposal, to invite him to repair thither, and to take possession of his Government there, where there was already an Army <MILESTONE N="10"/> preparing to assist him towards the recovery of his other Dominions; but that there was a Party of evil Counsellors about his Majesty, who disswaded him from accepting that their Invitation, except they would be content to change the Government of their Church, and to esta∣blish” Episcopacy there again.</Q> And by these insinuations they per∣swaded many of the States to believe, that the defence of Bishops, for whom they had no regard, was the sole difference between the King and Them, which kept the King from going into <HI>Scotland:</HI> So that the King was not without some apprehension, that by that mistake and false Information, the States might give him advice to accept the <HI>Scots</HI> In∣vitation. <MILESTONE N="$$"/> And therefore he sent to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> <Q>“that he had a desire to say somewhat to them, if they would assign him an” Audience the next day; which they readily did.</Q></P>
<P>THE King was receiv'd in the same manner he had been formerly, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King gives a visit to the States of</HI> Holland, <HI>and delivers them a Memo∣rial.</HI></NOTE> and being conducted into the room of Council, after a short Comple∣ment, he deliver'd a Paper to them, which he desir'd might be read, and that he might receive their advice thereupon assoon as they pleas'd. The Memorial contain'd, in the first place, his Majestie's acknowledge∣ment of the civilities he had receiv'd there, and his desire <Q>“that by” them the States General</Q> (who were not at that time assembled) <Q>“might <MILESTONE N="$$"/> be inform'd of such his Majestie's sense of their kindness; especially in the full and high detestation they had express'd of the impious, and unparallel'd Murther of his Royal Father, of Blessed Memo∣ry, their fast and unshaken Ally, by which the Forms and Rules of all kind of Government were no less violated and dissolv'd, than that of Monarchy: that he came to inform them that he did in∣tend, in a short time, so to dispose of his Person, as might with God's blessing most probably advance his Affairs; and that for the better doing thereof, and that he might in so important an Affair receive their particular advice, he should impart to them the true <MILESTONE N="40"/> state and condition of his several Dominions. That he needed not in∣form them of the deplorable condition of his Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> where the hearts and affections of his Loyal Subjects were so de∣press'd, and kept under by the power and cruelty of those who had Murther'd their late Soveraign, and who every day gave fresh and bloody instances of their Tyranny, to fright Men from their Al∣legiance, that for the present no Man could believe that miserable Kingdom could be fit for his Majesty to trust his Person in: that in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it is very true, that his Majesty is proclaim'd King, but with such limitations, and restriction sagainst his exercise of his Royal <MILESTONE N="$$"/> power, that in truth they had only given him the Name, and de∣nied him the Authority: that above five parts of six of the Nobility and chief Gentry of that Kingdom, were likewise excluded from their

just Right, and from any part in the administration of the Publick affairs; so that that Kingdom seem'd not sufficiently prepar'd for his Majestie's reception; but that he hoped, and doubted not, that there would be in a short time a perfect Union, and right understanding between all his Subjects of that his Kingdom, and a due submission and obedience from them all to his Majesty, for that he was resolv'd (and had never had the least purpose to the contrary) to preserve and maintain the Government of Church and State in that Kingdom, as it is establish'd by the Laws thereof, without any violation or altera∣tion on his part: so that there could be no difference between him <MILESTONE N="10"/> and his Subjects of that Kingdom, except they should endeavour, and press his Majesty to alter the Laws and Government of his other King∣doms; which as it would be very unreasonable to desire, so it is not in his power to do if he should consent, and joyn with his Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> to that purpose: which made him confident, that, when they had throughly weigh'd and consider'd what was good for them∣selves, as well as for Him, they would acquiesce with enjoying the Laws and Privileges of that Kingdom, without desiring to infringe” or impose upon those of their Brethren and Neighbours.</Q> And his Majesty desir'd the States, <Q>“that if any Persons had endeavour'd to make <MILESTONE N="20"/> any impressions upon them, that he hath, or ever had other inten∣tions or desires, with reference to his Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> than what himself now express'd to them to have, that they would give no credit to them: and assur'd them, that they should allways find him constant to those resolutions, and especially, that all ways and means which might lead to the advancement and propagation of the Protestant Religion, should be so heartily embrac'd by him, that the world should have cause to believe him to be worthy of his Title of <HI>Desender of the Faith,</HI> which he valued as his greatest At∣tribute.”</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THIS being the true present condition of his two Kingdoms of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and it being necessary for his Majesty, to give life to the afflicted state of his affairs by his own Personal activity and vi∣gour, he told them, <Q>“there remain'd only, that he should impart to them the like State of his other Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> which had like∣wise sent to him, and desir'd him to repair thither with great impor∣tunity: that the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> his Lieutenant there, had con∣cluded a Peace with the Roman Catholicks; and that thereby his Ma∣jesty was entirely possess'd of three parts of four of that his large and fruitful Kingdom, and of the Command of good Armies, and of many <MILESTONE N="40"/> good Ships to be joyn'd to his own Fleet; and that he had reason to hope and to believe that <HI>Dublin</HI> it self, and the few other places, which had submitted to the Rebellious power in <HI>England,</HI> either already were, upon the knowledge of that odious Parricide, return'd to their allegiance, or would speed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly be reduc'd; of which he expected every day to receive advertisement; which if it should fall out, yet he sore∣saw many objections might be made against his going thither, not only in regard of the difficulty and danger of his passage, but of the jealousies which would arise upon the large concessions which were made unto the Roman Catholicks of that Kingdom; which could not” <MILESTONE N="50"/> be avoided.</Q> And having thus given them a clear Information of the State of his three Kingdoms, his Majesty concluded with his desire, <Q>“that the States would give him their advice as freely, to which of
<PB N="232" REF="2500"/>
them he should repair; and that they would give him all necessary” assistance that he might prosecute their counsel.</Q></P>
<P>MANY Men fear'd, that the King would have brought great preju∣dice to himself by this Communication, and, upon the matter, oblig'd himself to follow their advice; which they apprehended would be con∣trary to his own judgement. For nothing was more commonly dis∣cours'd among the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and by many of the States themselves, than <Q>“that the King ought, without delay, to throw himself into the Arms of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to gratify them in all they desir'd: that Bishops were not worth the contending for; and that the supporting Them, had <MILESTONE N="$$"/> been the ruin of his Father, and would be His, if he continu'd in the” same obstinacy.</Q> But the King had reason to believe that they would not so much concern themselves in his broken Affairs, as to give him advice what to do: and it was necessary for him to get a little more time, upon some occurrences which would every day happen, before he took a positive resolution which way to steer: for though, in his own opinion, <HI>Ireland</HI> was the place to which he was to repair, yet he knew that notwithstanding the Peace that was made, there were se∣veral Parties still in Arms there, besides those who adher'd to the Par∣liament, who refus'd to submit to that Peace. Though the general <MILESTONE N="$$"/> Council at <HI>Kilkenny</HI> (which had been allways look'd upon as the Re∣presentative of the Confederate Catholicks of that Kingdom, and to which they had allways submitted) had fully consented to the Treaty of Peace with the Lord Lieutenant, yet <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> who had the Command of all the <HI>Irish</HI> in <HI>Ulster,</HI> and who was look'd upon as the best General they had, totally refus'd to submit to it, and positively protested against it, as not having provided for their Interest; and that Council was not sorry for his separation, there being little less animo∣sity between those of <HI>Ulster</HI> and the other <HI>Irish,</HI> than was between them both and the <HI>English:</HI> and they knew that <HI>O Neile</HI> more insisted upon <MILESTONE N="$$"/> recompence in Lands and Preferments, than upon any provision that concern'd Religion it self. Then the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Ulster,</HI> who were very numerous, and under good discipline, and well provided with Arms and Ammunition, would not submit to the Commands of the Lord Lieutenant; but were resolv'd to follow the Example of their Country∣men, and to see the King admitted and receiv'd, as well as proclaim'd, before they would submit to his Authority: which made the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> the less troubled at the Obstinacy of <HI>O Neile</HI> (though he had used all the means he had to draw him in) since he presumed the <HI>Scots</HI> and He would mortify each other, during the time that he should spend <MILESTONE N="40"/> in making himself strong enough to suppress them both: For the <HI>Scots,</HI> who would not joyn with the Marquis, were very vigorous in prose∣cuting the War against <HI>O Neile,</HI> and the <HI>Irish</HI> of <HI>Ulster.</HI> These Divisions, Factions, and Confusions in <HI>Ireland,</HI> made the King the more sollicitous that his Council should be unanimous for his going thither, at least that the <HI>Scots,</HI> how virulent soever against each other, should all concur in their Advice, <Q>“”that it was not yet seasonable for him to go for <HI>Scotland;</HI></Q> which made him labour so much to bring the <HI>Hamiltonians,</HI> and those who follow'd <HI>Mountrose,</HI> whom he believ'd both to be of that opinion, to meet together, and to own it joyntly to the King in Council: but it <MILESTONE N="50"/> is said before how impossible it was to obtain that Conjunction.</P>
<P>WHEN the King sound, that it was not possible to bring the Lords of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Nation together to confer upon the Affairs of that King∣dom,
<PB N="233" REF="2510"/>
he thought to have drawn them severally, that is, those of the <HI>Engagement</HI> by themselves, and the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> with His Friends by themselves, to have given him their Advice in the presence of his Council, that so, upon debate thereof between them, his Majesty might the more maturely have determin'd what he was to do. The Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> express'd a great willingness to give his Majesty satisfaction this, or any other way, being willing to deliver his opinion concerning things, or Persons, before any Body, and in any place. But the Lords of the <HI>Engagement</HI> positively refus'd to deliver their opinion, but to the King himself, and not in the presence of his Council; which, <MILESTONE N="10"/> they said, <Q>“would be to confess a kind of subordination of the Kingdom” of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was independent on the Council of <HI>England;</HI></Q> and Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> told the Counsellor, with whom he had before so freely conversed, and who expostulated with him upon it, <Q>“that it was the only ground of the heavy judgement in Parliament against the Earl of <HI>Traquair,</HI> that, having been the King's Commissioner in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he gave account to the King of transactions, and of the affairs of that Kingdom, at the Council Table in <HI>England;</HI> whereof he was likewise a Member; so jealous that Kingdom was, and still is, of their Native” Privileges;</Q> and therefore desir'd, <Q>“that he might not be pressed to” do what had been so penal to another in his own sight.</Q></P>
<P>THE King satisfied himself with having all their opinions deliver'd to himself, subscrib'd under all their hands, which every one consented to: though most of them would have been glad that the King would have gone into <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon what condescensions soever; because they all believ'd His presence would easily turn all, and that they should be quickly restor'd to their Estates, which they cared most for; yet no body presum'd to give that advice, or seem'd to think it seasonable. So that the King resum'd the former Debate of going directly for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and direction was given for providing Ships, and all other things ne∣cessary <MILESTONE N="30"/> for that Voyage. There remain'd only one doubt, whether his Majesty should take <HI>France</HI> in his way, that he might see his Mother, who by Letters and Messages pressed him very earnestly so to do; or whether he should imbark in <HI>Holland</HI> directly for <HI>Ireland;</HI> which would be less loss of time, and might be done early in the Spring, before the Parliament's Fleet should put out to Sea.</P>
<P>THEY who did not wish that the Queen should exercise any power over the King, or have too much credit with him, were against his going into <HI>France,</HI> as <Q>“an occasion of spending more time than his Af∣fairs would permit, and an obligation to make a greater Expence than” <MILESTONE N="40"/> he had, or knew where to have, means to defray:</Q> and they thought it an Argument of moment, <Q>“that from the time of the Murther of his Father, the King had never receiv'd Letter of condolement from” <HI>France,</HI> nor the least invitation to go thither.</Q> On the other side, they who wish'd, and hop'd that the Queen would have such an influence upon the King that his Council should have less credit with him, desir'd very much that his Majesty would make <HI>France</HI> his way. The <HI>Scots</HI> desir'd it very much, believing they should find her Majesty very propitious to their counsels, and inclin'd to trust their undertakings; and they were very sure that <HI>Mountrose</HI> would never go to <HI>Paris,</HI> or have credit <MILESTONE N="50"/> with the Queen.</P>
<P>THE Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Princess Royal his Wife, had a great desire to gratify the Queen, and that the King should see her in the way;
<PB N="234" REF="2520"/>
and propos'd <Q>“that his Majesty might appoint a place, where the Queen and He might meet, without going to <HI>Paris;</HI> and, after three or four days stay together, his Majesty might hasten his Journey to some con∣venient Port, from whence he might imbark for <HI>Ireland</HI> by a shorter passage than from <HI>Holland;</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> would appoint two Ships of War, to attend his Majesty in that <HI>French</HI> Port, before” he should get thither.</Q> His Majesty inclin'd this way, without posi∣tively resolving upon it; yet directed <Q>“that his own Goods of bulk, and his inferior Servants, should be presently imbark'd to take the di∣rectest” passage to <HI>Ireland;</HI></Q> and order'd <Q>“that the rest, who were to <MILESTONE N="10"/> wait upon his Person, should likewise send their Goods and Baggage, and such Servants who were not absolutely necessary for their present” Service, upon the same Ships for <HI>Ireland;</HI></Q> declaring, <Q>“that, if he made <HI>France</HI> his way, he would make all possible hast, and go with as light” a train as he could.</Q> Hereupon two Ships were shortly after provided, and many Persons (and great store of Baggage) imbark'd for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and arriv'd there in safety; but most of the Persons, and all the Goods, miscarried in their return, when they knew that the King was not to come thither, upon the accidents that afterwards fell out there.</P>
<P>THIS Resolution being taken, the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> who had a just <MILESTONE N="20"/> excuse from his Age, being then seventy five years old, to wish to be in some repose, consider'd with himself how to become disintangled from the fatigue of those Voyages and Journies, which he saw the King would be oblig'd to make. In <HI>Holland</HI> he had no mind to stay, having never lov'd that People, nor been lov'd by them; and he thought the Climate it self was very pernicious to his health, by reason of the Gout, which frequently visited him. <HI>France</HI> was as ungrateful to him, where he had not been kindly treated, and was look'd upon as one who had been allways addicted to <HI>Spain,</HI> and no friend to the Crown of <HI>France;</HI> so that he was willing to find a good occasion to spend the remainder <MILESTONE N="30"/> of his age where he had spent so much of his youth, in <HI>Spain,</HI> and where he believ'd that he might be able to do the King more service than any other way. And there was newly come to the <HI>Hague</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Gen∣tleman, who had been an Officer in the King's Army, and was in <HI>Ma∣drid</HI> when the News came thither of the Murther of the King: and he related many particulars of the passion and indignation of that Court, upon that occasion, against the Rebels; that <Q>“the King, and all the” Court,</Q> put themselves into solemn mourning: (and he repeated some Expressions which the King, and <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> had made of ten∣derness and compassion for our King) and that <Q>“the King of <HI>Spain</HI> spoke” <MILESTONE N="40"/> of sending an Embassadour to his Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>THESE relations, and any thing of that kind, how weakly soever founded, were very willingly heard. And from hence the Lord <HI>Cot∣tington</HI> took occasion to confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Conference be∣tween the Lord</HI> Cotting∣ton <HI>and the Chancellor of the Exchequer concerning the King's sending an Embassy into</HI> Spain.</NOTE> (with whom he held a strict Friendship, they living, and keeping House together) of <Q>“the ill condition the King was in, and that he ought to think, what Prince's kindness was like to be of most use and benefit to his Majesty, and from whom he might hope to receive a Sum of Money; if not as much as might serve for a Martial Expedition, yet such an annual Exhibition as might serve for his support: that he had <MILESTONE N="50"/> already experience of <HI>France,</HI> and knew well the Intelligence that the Cardinal had at that very time with <HI>Cromwell:</HI> but he did verily believe, that if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> were dextrously treated with, and
<PB N="235" REF="2530"/>
not more asked of him than could consist with his Affairs to spare, a good yearly support might be procured There, and the expectation” of it might be worth the King's sending an Embassadour thither.</Q> He said, <Q>“he was more of that opinion since the King had taken the reso∣lution of going for <HI>Ireland;</HI> where the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s credit might be of great benefit to him: that <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> and the old <HI>Irish</HI> of <HI>Ulster,</HI> were still in Armes against the King; and would not submit to the conditions which the general Council of the Confederate Ca∣tholicks had consented to with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond:</HI> that <HI>O Neile</HI> had been bred in <HI>Spain,</HI> and had a Regiment in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and so must <MILESTONE N="10"/> have an absolute dependence upon his Catholick Majesty, for whom all the old <HI>Irish</HI> had ever had a particular devotion; and if it were only to dispose Him and that People to the King's obedience, and to accept those conditions which might conveniently be given to them, it were well worth such a Journey; and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> would ne∣ver refuse to gratify the King to the utmost that could be desired in” that particular.</Q> The Chancellor thought this discourse not unreason∣able, and asked him, <Q>“”who would be fit to be sent thither?</Q> not imagin∣ing that he had any thought of going thither Himself. He answer'd, <Q>“that, if the King would be advised by him, he should send them two” <MILESTONE N="20"/> thither, and he did believe they should do him very good Service.</Q></P>
<P>THE Chancellor was weary of the Company he was in, and the busi∣ness, which, having no prospect but towards despair, was yet render'd more grievous by the continual Contentions and Animosities between Persons. He knew he was not in the Queen's savour at all, and should find no respect in that Court. However, he was very scrupulous, that the King might not suspect that he was weary of his Attendance, or that any Body else might believe that he withdrew himself from wait∣ing longer upon so desperate a Fortune. <Q>In the end, he told the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> “that he would only be passive in the point, and refer it <MILESTONE N="30"/> entirely to Him, if he thought fit to dispose the King to like it; and if the King approv'd it so much as to take notice of it to the Chancel∣lor, and commend it as a thing he thought for his Service, he would” submit to his Command.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Cottington</HI>'s heart was much set upon this imployment, and he managed so warily with the King, and presented the whole scheme to him so dextrously, that his Majesty was much pleased with it; and shortly after declared his resolution publickly, <Q>“to send the Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de∣clares those t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o to be his Embassadours.</NOTE> <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, his Embassadours” extraordinary into <HI>Spain;</HI></Q> and commanded them <Q>“to prepare their <MILESTONE N="40"/> own Commission, and Instructions; and to begin their Journey assoon” as was possible.</Q></P>
<P>BEFORE the King could begin his own Journey for <HI>France,</HI> and so to <HI>Ireland,</HI> his Majesty thought it necessary, upon the whole prospect of his Affairs with reference to all places, to put his business into as good a method as he could, and to dispose of that number of Officers, and Soldiers, and other Persons, who had presented themselves to be applied to his Service, or to leave them to take the best course they could for their own subsistence. Of these, many were sent into <HI>Ireland</HI> with the Ships which carried the King's Goods, with recommendation <MILESTONE N="50"/> to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <Q>“to put them into his Army till the King” came thither.</Q> Since the <HI>Scots</HI> were no better disposed to serve, or receive the King for the present, his Majesty was resolv'd to give the
<PB N="236" REF="2540"/>
Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> all the encouragement he desired to visit them, and to incline them to a better temper.</P>
<P>THERE was then at the <HI>Hague Cornificius Wolfelte,</HI> Embassadour extraordinary from the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> to the States General; who came with a great Train and great State, and was himself a Man of va∣nity and ostentation, and took pains to be thought so great a Man by his own Interest, that he did not enough extol the power of his Master; which prov'd his ruin after his return. He had left <HI>Denmark</HI> before the news came thither of the Murther of the King, and so he had no Credentials for his Majesty, by reason whereof he could not receive any <MILESTONE N="10"/> publick formal Audience; <Q>but desired “the King's leave that he might, as by accident, be admitted to speak to him at the Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI>'s” Court; where his Majesty used to be every day;</Q> and there the Em∣bassadour often spoke to him. The Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> had found means to endear himself much to this Embassadour, who gave him encouragement to hope for a very good reception in <HI>Denmark,</HI> if the King would send him thither, and that he might obtain Armes, and Ammunition there for <HI>Scotland.</HI> <Q>The Embassadour told him, “that, if the King would write a Letter to him to that purpose, he would presently supply him with some Money and Armes, in assurance that” <MILESTONE N="20"/> his Master would very well approve of what he should do.</Q> The Mar∣quis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> well knew, that the King was not able to supply him with the least proportion of Money to begin his Journey; and therefore he had only proposed, <Q>“that the King would give him Letters, in the form he prescribed, to several Princes in <HI>Germany,</HI> whose affections” he pretended to know;</Q> which Letters he sent by several Officers, who were to bring the Soldiers or Armes they should obtain, to a Rendez∣vous he appointed near <HI>Hamburg;</HI> and resolv'd himself to go into <HI>Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> in hope to get supplies in both those places, both from the Crowns, and by the contribution of many <HI>Scotish</HI> Officers, <MILESTONE N="$$"/> who had Command and Estates in those Countries; and to have Cre∣dentials, by virtue of which he might appear Embassadour extraordi∣nary from the King, if he should find it expedient; though he did in∣tend rather to negotiate his business in private, and without any pub∣lick Character. All this was resolv'd before his confidence, at least his familiarity with the Embassadour, was grown less. <Q>But, upon the En∣couragement he had from him, he moved the King “for his Letter to the Embassadour, to assist the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> with his Advice, and with his Interest in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and in any other Court, to the end that he might obtain the Loan of Monies, Armes, and Ammunition, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and whatever else was necessary to enable the Marquis to prosecute” his intended Descent into <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> The King, glad that he did not press for ready Money, which he was not able to supply him with, gave him such Letters as he desired to all Persons, and particularly to the Embassadour himself; who, having order from his Master to pre∣sent the King with a Sum of Money for his present occasions, never inform'd the King thereof, but advised <HI>Mountrose</HI> to procure such a Letter from his Majesty to him; which being done, the Marquis receiv'd that Money from him, and likewise some Armes; with which he be∣gun his unfortunate Enterprise; and prosecuted his Journey to <HI>Ham∣burg;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Mountrose <HI>goes to</HI> Ham∣burg.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="$$"/> where he expected to meet his <HI>German</HI> Troops, which he be∣liev'd the Officers he had sent thither with the King's Letters would be well able to raise, with the assistance of those Princes to whom they
<PB N="237" REF="2550"/>
had been sent. But he was carried on by a stronger assurance he had receiv'd from some prophecies, and predictions, to which he was na∣turally given, <Q>“that he should by his valour recover <HI>Scotland</HI> for the King, and from thence conduct an Army that should settle his Ma∣jesty” in all his other Dominions.</Q></P>
<P>THERE had been yet nothing done by the King with reference to <HI>England</HI> since the Murther of his Father; nor did there appear any thing, of any kind, to be attempted as yet there: there was so terrible a consternation, that still possessed the Spirits of that People, that though Men's Affections were greater, and more general for the King, out of <MILESTONE N="10"/> the horror and detestation they had of the late Parricide, yet the own∣ing it was too penal for their broken courage; nor was it believ'd possi∣ble for any Man to contribute any thing, at present, for their Deli∣verance. However, most Men were of opinion, <Q>“that it was necessary for the King to publish some Declaration, that he might not seem utterly to give over his Claim there; and to keep up the Spirits of” his Friends.</Q> And many from <HI>England,</HI> who in the midst of their despair would give some counsel, advised, <Q>“that there might be some∣what published by the King that might give some Check to the ge∣neral submitting to the <HI>Engagement,</HI> which was so universally press'd” <MILESTONE N="20"/> there.</Q> The King being every day advertised, how much this was de∣sired and expected, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Lords being of the same opinion, hoping that somewhat might be inserted in it that might favour the Presbyterians, his Majesty proposed at the Council <Q>“that there might be some draught prepared of a Proclamation, or Declaration, only” with reference to the Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI></Q> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had been most conversant in Instruments of that na∣ture, was appointed to make one ready; though he had declared, <Q>“that he did not know what such a Declaration could contain, and there∣fore” <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor of the Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e∣que<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppoi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣ed to make <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Declaration relating to</HI> England.</NOTE> that he thought it not seasonable to publish any.</Q> The Prince of <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Orange</HI> was present at that Council, and whether from his own opinion, or from the suggestion of the <HI>Scots</HI> Lords, who were much favour'd by him, he wish'd, <Q>“that, in regard of the great differences which were in <HI>England</HI> about matters of Religion, the King would offer, in this De∣claration, to refer all matters in controversy concerning Religion to a National Synod; in which there should be admitted some foreign” Divines from the Protestant Churches;</Q> which, he thought, would be a popular clause, and might be acceptable abroad as well as at home: and the King believ'd no objection could be made against it; and so thought fit such a Clause should be inserted. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>WITHIN a short time after the Council was parted, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> sent for the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and told him, <Q>“he was not enough acquainted with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but desired him to intreat him not to be too sharp in this Declaration, the end whereof was to unite, and reconcile different humours; and that he found many had a great apprehension, that the sharpness of His Style would” irritate them much more.</Q> The Chancellor knew well enough that this came from the Lord <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and he wish'd heartily that the charge might be committed to any Body else, protesting, <Q>“that he was never less disposed in his own conceptions, and reflections, to undertake any <MILESTONE N="50"/> such task in his Life; and that he could not imagine how it was pos∣sible for the King to publish a Declaration at that time (his first De∣claration) without much sharpness against the Murtherers of his”
<PB N="238" REF="2560"/>
Father;</Q> which no body could speak against; nor could he be excused from the Work imposed upon him: and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> assured him, <Q>“it was not That kind of sharpness which he wish'd should be de∣clined:” and though he seem'd not willing farther to explain himself,</Q> it was evident that he wish'd that there might not be any sharpness against the Presbyterians, for which there was at that time no occasion.</P>
<P>THERE was one particular, which, without a full and distinct In∣struction, the Chancellor could not presume to express. The great end of this Declaration was to confirm the affection of as many as was pos∣sible for the King, and, consequently, as few were to be made desperate, <MILESTONE N="10"/> as might consist with the King's Honour, and necessary Justice: so that how far that Clause, which was essential to a Declaration upon this sub∣ject, concerning the Indemnity of Persons, should extend, was the que∣stion. And in this there was difference of opinions; the most prevalent was, <Q>“that no Persons should be excepted from pardon, but only such who had an immediate hand in the execrable Murther of the King, by being his Judges, and pronouncing that Sentence, and they who” perform'd the Execution.</Q> Others said, they <Q>“knew that some were in the List of the Judges, and named by the Parliament, who found” Excuses to be absent;</Q> and others, that <Q>“some who were not named, <MILESTONE N="$0"/> more contrived and contributed to that odious proceeding, than ma∣ny” of the Actors in it.</Q> But the resolution was, that the former should be only comprehended.</P>
<P>WHEN the Declaration was prepared, and read at the Board, there was a deep silence, no Man speaking to any part of it. But another day was appointed for a second reading it, against which time every Man might be better prepared to speak to it: and in the mean time the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in regard he was not a perfect Master of the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, desired he might have a Copy of it, that he might the better understand it. <Q>And the Chancellor of the Exchequer desired, “that <MILESTONE N="30"/> not only the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> might have a Copy, but that his Ma∣jesty would likewise have one, and, after he should have perused it himself, he would shew it to any other, who he thought was fit to” advise with;</Q> there being many Lords and other Persons of Quality about him, who were not of the Council: and he moved, <Q>“that he might have liberty himself to communicate it to some who were like to make a judgement, how far any thing of that Nature was like to be” acceptable, and agreeable to the minds of the People;</Q> and named <HI>Herbert</HI> the Atturney General, and D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Steward,</HI> who was Dean of the Chapel; and His opinion, in all things relating to the Church, the King <MILESTONE N="40"/> had been advised by his Father to submit to. All which was approv'd by the King; and, for that reason, a farther day was appointed for the second reading. The Issue was, that, except two or three of the Coun∣cil, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Different opi∣nions in the King's Council about it when it was read.</NOTE> who were of one and the same opinion of the whole, there were not two Persons who were admitted to the perusal of it, who did not take some exception to it, though scarce two made the same exception.</P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Steward,</HI> though a Man of a very good understanding, was so exceedingly griev'd at the Clause of admitting Foreign Divines into a Synod that was to consult upon the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that he could not be satisfied by any Arguments that could be given of <Q>“the <MILESTONE N="50"/> impossibility of any effect, or that the Parliament would accept the Overture; and that there could be no danger if it did, because the” Number of those Foreign Divines must be still limited by the King;</Q>
<PB N="239" REF="2570"/>
but came one morning to the Chancellor, with whom he had a Friend∣ship, and protested <Q>“he had not slept that Night, out of the agony and trouble, that He, who he knew lov'd the Church so well, should con∣sent” to a Clause so much against the honour of it;</Q> and went from him to the King, to beseech him never to approve it. Some were of opi∣nion <Q>“that there were too few excepted from pardon; by which the King would not have confiscations enough to satisfy, and reward his” Party: and others though,</Q> <Q>“that there were too many excepted; and that it was not prudent to make so many Men desperate; but that it would be sufficient to except <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <HI>Bradshaw,</HI> and three or <MILESTONE N="10"/> four more of those whose malice was most notorious; the whole Num∣ber” not to exceed Six.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> did not value the Clause for Foreign Divines, who, they knew, could perswade little in an <HI>English</HI> Synod; but they were im∣placably offended, that the King mention'd the Government of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Book of Common-Prayer, with so much reverence and devotion; which was the sharpness they most fear'd of the Chancellor's style, when they thought now the Covenant to be ne∣cessary to be insisted upon more than ever. So that, when the Decla∣ration was read at the Board the second time, most Men being mov'd <MILESTONE N="20"/> with the discourses, and fears which were express'd abroad of some ill effects it might produce, it was more faintly debated, and Men seem'd not to think that the publishing any, at this time, was of so much im∣portance, as they formerly had conceiv'd it to be. By all which Men may judge, how hard a thing it was for the King to resolve, and act with that steadiness and resolution, which the most unprosperous con∣dition doth more require than the State that is less perplex'd and in∣tangled. Thus the Declaration slept without farther proposition to pu∣blish <NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which it was laid aside.</NOTE> any.</P>
<P>ALL things being now as much provided for as they were like to be, <MILESTONE N="30"/> the two Embassadours for <HI>Spain</HI> were very sollicitous to begin their journey, the King being at last resolv'd not to give his Mother the trouble of making a journey to meet him, but to go himself directly to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Germain</HI>'s, where her Majesty was. The Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to advance that resolution, had promis'd to supply the King with twenty thousand pounds; which was too great a Loan for him to make, who had already great debts upon him, though it was very little for the enabling the King to discharge the debts He and his Family had con∣tracted at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and to make his Journey. Out of this Sum the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor, were to receive so much as was <MILESTONE N="40"/> design'd to defray their journey to <HI>Paris:</HI> what was necessary for the discharge of their Embassy, or for making their journey from <HI>Paris,</HI> was not yet provided. The King had some hope, that the Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain</HI> would lend him some Money; which he design'd for this service; which made it necessary that they should immediately resort to <HI>Brusells,</HI> to finish that Negotiation, and from thence to prosecute their journey.</P>
<P>IN the solliciting their first dispatch at the <HI>Hague,</HI> they made a dis∣covery that seem'd very strange to them, though afterwards it was a truth that was very notorious. Their journey having been put off some days, only for the receipt of that small Sum, which was to be paid <MILESTONE N="50"/> them out of the Money to be lent by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and <HI>Hem∣slet</HI> the Prince's chief Officer in such affairs of Money, having been some days at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to negotiate that Loan, and no Money being
<PB N="240" REF="2580"/>
return'd, they believ'd that there was some affected delay; and so went to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who had advis'd, and was well pleas'd with that Embassy, to know when that Money would be ready for the King, that he might likewise resolve upon the time for his own Journey. The Prince told them, he believ'd, <Q>“that They, who knew <HI>London</HI> so well, and had heard so much discourse of the Wealth of <HI>Holland,</HI> would wonder very much that he should have been endeavouring above ten days to borrow twenty thousand pounds; and that the richest Men in <HI>Amsterdam</HI> had promised him to supply him with it, and that one half” of it was not yet provided.</Q> <Q>He said, “it was not that there was <MILESTONE N="$$"/> any question of his credit, which was very good; and that the secu∣rity he gave, was as good as any Body desir'd, and upon which he could have double the Sum in less time, if he would receive it in Pa∣per, which was the Course of that Country; where bargains being made for one hundred thousand pounds to be paid within ten days, it was never known that twenty thousand pounds was paid together in one Town; but by Bills upon <HI>Rotterdam, Harlem,</HI> the <HI>Hague,</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and other places, which was as convenient, or more, to all parties; and he did verily believe, that though <HI>Amsterdam</HI> could pay a Million within a Month, upon any good occasion, yet <MILESTONE N="20"/> they would be troubled to bring twenty thousand pounds together into any one room; and that was the true reason, that the Money was not yet brought to the <HI>Hague;</HI> which it should be within few” days; as it was accordingly.</Q></P>
<P>THE Embassadours took their leave of the King at the <HI>Hague</HI> before <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Embassa∣dours for</HI> Spain <HI>begin their Journey.</HI></NOTE> the middle of <HI>May,</HI> and had a Yatch from the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that attended them at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and transported them with great conve∣nience to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where the Chancellor's Wife and his Family were arriv'd ten days before, and were settled in a good and convenient House; where the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> and He both lodg'd whilst they stay'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> in that City. There they met the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> in his way towards the King, to hasten the King's journey into <HI>France,</HI> upon the Queen's great importunity. He was very glad they were both come away from the King, and believ'd he should more easily prevail with his Majesty in all things, as indeed he did. After two or three days stay at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> they went to <HI>Brussels</HI> to deliver their Credentials both to the Arch-Duke, and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and to visit the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ministers, and, upon their Landing at <HI>Brussels,</HI> they took it for a good Omen, that they were assur'd <Q>“that <HI>le Brune,</HI> who had been one of the Plenipotentiaries at the Treaty of <HI>Munster,</HI> on the behalf of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> was <MILESTONE N="$$"/> then in that Town with Credentials to visit the King, and to condole” with him.</Q> They had an audience, the next day, of the Arch-Duke: they perform'd the Compliments to him from the King, and inform'd him of their Embassy into <HI>Spain,</HI> and desir'd his recommendation, and good Offices in that Court; which he, according to his slow, and for∣mal way of speaking, consented to: and they had no more to do with Him, but receiv'd the visits from the Officers, in his Name, according to the style of that Court. Their main business was with the Duke of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They visit the Duke of</HI> Lor∣rain <HI>at</HI> Brus∣sels.</NOTE> <HI>Lorrain,</HI> to procure Money for their journey into <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>THE Duke was a Prince that liv'd in a different manner from all other <MILESTONE N="$$"/> Soveraign Princes in the world: from the time, that he had been driven out of his Country by <HI>France,</HI> he had retir'd to <HI>Brussels</HI> with his Army, which he kept up very strong; and serv'd the King of <HI>Spain</HI> with it
<PB N="241" REF="2590"/>
against the <HI>French,</HI> upon such terms, and conditions, as were made, and renew'd every year between them; by which he receiv'd great Sums of Money yearly from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and was sure very rich in Money. He allways commanded apart in the field: his Officers re∣ceiv'd no Orders but from himself: he allways agreed at the Council of War what he should do, and his Army was in truth the best part of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Forces. In the Town of <HI>Brussels</HI> he liv'd without any order, method, or state of a Prince, except towards the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in his Trea∣ties, and being present in their Councils, where he allways kept his full Dignity: otherwise, he liv'd in a jolly familiarity with the Bourgeois and <MILESTONE N="10"/> their Wives, and feasted with them, but scarce kept a Court or any num∣ber of Servants, or Retinue. The House wherein he liv'd was a very ordinary one, and not furnish'd; nor was he often there, or easy to be found; so that the Embassadours could not easily send to him for an Au∣dience. He receiv'd them in a lower room with great courtesy and fa∣miliarity; and visited them at their own Lodging. He was a Man of great wit, and presence of mind, and, if he had not affected extrava∣gancies, no man knew better how to act the Prince. He lov'd his Mo∣ney very much; yet the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI>'s dexterity and address, pre∣vail'd with him to lend the King two thousand Pistolls; which was all <MILESTONE N="20"/> that was in their view for defraying their Embassy. But they hoped they should procure some supply in <HI>Spain,</HI> out of which their own ne∣cessary expences must be provided for.</P>
<P>THERE were two <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by whom all the Councils there were govern'd and conducted, and which the Arch-Duke himself could not controle; the Conde of <HI>Pignoranda</HI> (who was newly come from <HI>Mun∣ster,</HI> being the other Plenipotentiary there; and stay'd only at <HI>Brussels,</HI> in expectation of renewing the Treaty again with <HI>France;</HI> but, whilst he stay'd there, was in the highest Trust of all the affairs) and the Conde of <HI>Fuensaldagna,</HI> who was the Governour of the Arms, and commanded <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Army next under the Arch-Duke; which was a subordination very little inferior to the being General. They were both very able and ex∣pert men in business, and if They were not very wise men, that Na∣tion had none. The former was a Man of the Robe, of a great wit, and much experience, proud, and, if he had not been a little to pedan∣tick, might very well be look'd upon as a very extraordinary Man, and was much improv'd by the excellent temper of <HI>le Brune</HI> (the other Ple∣nipotentiary) who was indeed a wise Man, and by seeming to defer in all things to <HI>Pignoranda,</HI> govern'd him. The <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Fuensaldagna</HI> was of a much better temper, more industry, and more insinuation <MILESTONE N="40"/> than <HI>Spaniards</HI> use to have: his greatest talent lay to Civil business; yet he was the best General of that time to all other offices and pur∣poses, than what were necessary in the hour of Battle, when he was not so present and compos'd as at all other seasons.</P>
<P>BOTH these receiv'd the Embassadours with the usual Civilities, and return'd their visits to their own Lodging, but seem'd not pleased with their Journey to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and spoke much of the necessities that Crown was in, and its disability to assist the King; which the Embassadours imputed to the influence <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas</HI> had upon them both; who remain'd still under the same Character in <HI>England</HI> he had done <MILESTONE N="50"/> for many years before. The same civilities were perform'd between <HI>le Brune</HI> and them; who treated them with much more freedom, and en∣courag'd them to hope well from their Negotiation in <HI>Spain;</HI> acquainted
<PB N="242" REF="2600"/>
them with his own Instructions, <Q>“to give the King all assurance of the affection of his Catholick Majesty, and of his readiness to do any thing” for him that was in his power.</Q> <Q>He said, “he only deferr'd his Jour∣ney, because he heard that the King intended to spend some time at” <HI>Breda;</HI></Q> and he had rather attend him There, than at the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Embassadours had dispatch'd all their business at <HI>Brussels,</HI> and receiv'd the Money from the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> they return'd to <HI>Antwerp;</HI> where they were to negotiate for the return of their Monies to <HI>Madrid;</HI> which requir'd very much wariness, the Bills from thence finding now more difficulties at <HI>Madrid,</HI> than they had done in former <MILESTONE N="$$"/> times.</P>
<P>BY the Letters my Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> brought, and the importunity he used, the King resolv'd to begin his Journey sooner than he thought to have done, that is, sooner than he thought he should have been able, all provisions being to begin to be made both for his Journey into <HI>France,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Ireland,</HI> after the Money was receiv'd that should pay for them. But the Queen's impatience was so great to see his Ma∣jesty, that the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Princess Royal his Wife, were as impatient to give her that satisfaction. Though her Majesty could not justly dislike any resolution the King had taken, nor could imagine <MILESTONE N="$$"/> whither he should go but into <HI>Ireland,</HI> she was exceedingly displeas'd that any resolution at all had been taken before she was consulted. She was angry that the Counsellors were chosen without her directions, and look'd upon all that had been done, as done in order to exclude Her from medling in the Affairs; all which she imputed principally to the Chancellor of the Exchequer: nevertheless she was not pleas'd with the design of the Negotiation in <HI>Spain.</HI> For though she had no confidence of his affection to Her, or rather of his complying with all her Commands, yet she had all confidence in his Duty and Integrity to the King, and therefore wish'd he should be still about his Person, and trusted in his <MILESTONE N="30"/> business; which she thought him much fitter for than such a Negotia∣tion, which she believ'd, out of her natural prejudice to <HI>Spain,</HI> would produce no advantage to the King.</P>
<P>THAT the Queen might receive some content, in knowing that the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣moves to</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re∣da.</NOTE> King had begun his Journey, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> desir'd him, <Q>“whilst his Servants prepar'd what was necessary at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that Himself, and that part of his Train that was ready, would go to <HI>Breda,</HI> and” stay there till the rest were ready to come up to him;</Q> that being his best way to <HI>Flanders,</HI> through which he must pass into <HI>France. Breda</HI> was a Town of the Prince's own, where he had a handsome Palace and <MILESTONE N="40"/> Castle, and a place where the King might have many Divertisements. Hither the <HI>Spanish</HI> Embassadour <HI>le Brune,</HI> came to attend his Majesty, and deliver'd his Master's Compliments to his Majesty, and offer'd his own services to him, whilst he should remain in those Provinces; he being at that time design'd to remain Embassadour to the united Pro∣vinces; as he did; and died shortly after at the <HI>Hague</HI> with a gene∣ral regret. He was born a Subject to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in that part of <HI>Burgundy</HI> that was under his Dominion; and having been from his youth allways bred in business, and being a Man of great parts, and temper, he might very well be look'd upon as one of the best States∣men <MILESTONE N="50"/> in Christendom, and who best understood the true interest of all the Princes of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>AS SOON as the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and the Chancellor, heard of the
<PB N="243" REF="2610"/>
King's being at <HI>Breda,</HI> and that he intended to hasten his journey for <HI>France,</HI> they resolv'd, having in truth not yet negotiated all things ne∣cessary for their Journey, to stay till the King passed by, and not to go to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Germain</HI>'s till the first interview, and eclarcisments were passed between the King and Queen, that they might then be the better able to judge what Weather was like to be.</P>
<P>THE King was receiv'd at <HI>Antwerp</HI> with great magnificence: he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Antwerp:</NOTE> enter'd in a very rich Coach with six Horses, which the Arch-Duke sent a present to him when he came into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions: he was treated there, at the Charge of the City, very splendidly for two days: <MILESTONE N="10"/> and went then to <HI>Brussels,</HI> where he was lodged in the Palace, and royal∣ly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Brussels.</NOTE> entertain'd. But the <HI>French</HI> Army, under the Command of the <HI>Conte de Harcourt,</HI> was two days before set down before <HI>Cambray;</HI> with the News whereof the <HI>Spanish</HI> Council was surprised, and in so much disorder, that the Arch-Duke was gone to the Army to <HI>Mons,</HI> and <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> whilst the King was in <HI>Antwerp;</HI> so that the King was receiv'd only by his Officers; who perform'd their parts very well.</P>
<P>HERE the <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Pignoranda</HI> waited upon the King in the qua∣lity of an Embassadour, and cover'd. And his Majesty stayed here three or four days, not being able suddainly to resolve which way he should <MILESTONE N="20"/> pass into <HI>France.</HI> But he was not troubled long with that doubt; for the <HI>French</HI> thought to have surprised that Town, and to have cast up their Line of Circumvallation before any supplies could be put in; but the <HI>Conde Fuensaldagna</HI> found a way to put seven or eight hundred Foot into the Town; upon which the <HI>French</HI> raised the Siege: and so the King made his Journey by the usual way; and, near <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King had an Interview with the Arch-Duke near</HI> Valen∣ciennes.</NOTE> had an interview with the Arch-Duke; and, after some short Ceremo∣nies, continued on his Journey, and lodged at <HI>Cambray;</HI> where he was likewise treated by the <HI>Conde de Garcies,</HI> who was Governour there, and a very civil Gentleman. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>ABOUT a week after the King left <HI>Brussels,</HI> the two Embassadours prosecuted their Journey for <HI>Paris;</HI> where they stayed only one day, and then went to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Germain</HI>'s; where the King and the Queen his Mo∣ther, with both their Families, and the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s, then were; by whom they were receiv'd graciously. They had no reason to repent their caution in staying so long behind the King, for they found the Court so full of jealousy and disorder, that every Body was glad that they were come. After the first two or three days that the King and Queen had been together, which were spent in tears and lamentations for the great alteration that had happen'd since their last parting, the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Queen begun to confer with the King of his business, and what course he meant to take; in which she found him so reserv'd, as if he had no mind She should be conversant in it. He made no Apologies to her; which she expected; nor any professions of resigning himself up to Her advice. On the contrary, upon some expostulations, he had told her plainly, <Q>“that he would allways perform his Duty towards her with great affection and exactness, but that in his business he would obey” his own reason and judgement;</Q> and did as good as desire her not to trouble her self in his Affairs: and finding her passions strong, he fre∣quently retired from her with some abruptness, and seem'd not to desire <MILESTONE N="50"/> to be so much in her Company as she expected; and prescribed some new rules to be observ'd in his own retirement, which he had not been accustom'd to.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="2620"/>
THIS kind of unexpected behaviour gave the Queen much trouble. She begun to think, that this distance, which the King seem'd to affect, was more than the Chancellor of the Exchequer could wish; and that there was some Body else, who did her more disservice: insomuch as to the Ladies who were about her, whereof some were very much his Friends, she seem'd to wish, that the Chancellor were come. There was a Gentleman, who was newly come from <HI>England,</HI> and who came to the <HI>Hague</HI> after the Chancellor had taken his leave of the King, and had been ever since very close about him, being one of the Grooms of his Bed-Chamber, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Elliot,</HI> a Person spoken of before; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Elliot <HI>comes to the King: his In∣fluence upon his Majesty.</HI></NOTE> whom the King's Father had formerly sent into <HI>France,</HI> at the same time that he resolv'd the Prince should go for the West; and for no other reason, but that he should not attend upon his Son. And he had given order, <Q>“that if he should return out of <HI>France,</HI> and come into” the West, the Council should not suffer him to be about the Prince;</Q> with whom he thought he had too much credit, and would use it ill; and he had never seen the Prince from the time he left <HI>Oxford</HI> till now. He was a bold Man, and spoke all things confidently, and had not that reverence for the late King which he ought to have had; and less for the Queen; though he had great obligations to both; yet being not so <MILESTONE N="$0"/> great as he had a mind to, he looked upon them as none at all. This Gentleman came to the King just as he left the <HI>Hague,</HI> and both as he was a new comer, and as one for whom his Majesty had formerly much kindness, was very well receiv'd; and being one who would re∣ceive no injury from his Modesty, made the favour the King shew'd him as bright, and to shine as much in the eyes of all Men, as was pos∣sible. He was never from the Person of the King, and allways whisper∣ing in his Ear, taking upon him to understand the sense and opinion of all the Loyal party in <HI>England:</HI> and when he had a mind that the King should think well, or ill of any Man, he told him, <Q>“that he was much” <MILESTONE N="30"/> belov'd by, or very odious to all his Party there.</Q> By these infusions, he had prevailed with him to look with less grace upon the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> who came from <HI>Caen</HI> (where he had hitherto resided) to kiss his hands, than his own good-nature would have inclined him to; and more to discountenance the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and to tell him plainly, <Q>“that” he should not serve him in the place of Secretary of State;</Q> in which he had serv'd his Father, and from which Men have seldom been re∣mov'd upon the Descent of the Crown; and not to admit either Father or Son to be of his Council; which was more extraordinary. He told the King, <Q>“it would be the most unpopular thing he could do, and <MILESTONE N="40"/> which would lose him more hearts in <HI>England</HI> than any other thing,” if he were thought to be govern'd by his Mother.</Q> And in a Month's time that he had been about the King, he begun already to be looked upon as very like to become the Favorite. He had used the Queen with wonderful neglect when she spoke to him, and had got so much Interest with the King, that he had procured a promise from his Majesty to make Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> whose Daughter M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Elliot</HI> had Married, Se∣cretary of State; an honest Gentleman, but extreme unequal to that Province; towards which he could not pretend a better qualification, than that his Wife had been Nurse to the Prince, who was now King <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>IN these kind of humours and indispositions the Embassadours found the Court, when they came to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Germain</HI>'s. They had, during their stay at <HI>Paris,</HI> in their way to Court, conferr'd with the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI>
<PB N="245" REF="2630"/>
and his Son the Lord <HI>Digby;</HI> who breath'd out their Griefs to them; and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was the more troubled to find that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Elliot,</HI> who was a known and declared Enemy of his, had gotten so much credit with the King, as to be able to satisfy his own malice upon him, by the countenance of his Majesty; in whom, he knew, the King his Fa∣ther desired, that he should of all Men have the least Interest. After they had been a day or two there, the Chancellor of the Exchequer thinking it his Duty to say somewhat to the Queen in particular, and knowing that she expected he should do so, and the King having told him at large all that had passed with his Mother, and the ill humour <MILESTONE N="10"/> she was in (all which his Majesty related in a more exalted Dialect than he had been accustom'd to) and his Majesty being very willing to un∣derstand what the Queen thought upon the whole, the Chancellor asked a private Audience; which her Majesty readily granted. And after she <NOTE PLACE="marg">A private Audience of the Chancel∣lor with the Queen.</NOTE> had gently expostulated upon the old passages at <HI>Jersey,</HI> she concluded with the mention of the great confidence the King her Husband had allways reposed in him, and thereupon renew'd her own gracious pro∣fessions of good will towards him. Then she complain'd, not without tears, of the King's unkindness towards her, and of his way of living with her, of some Expressions he had used in discourse in her own pre∣sence, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and of what he had said in other places, and of the great credit M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Elliot</HI> had with him, and of his rude behaviour towards her Ma∣jesty, and lastly of the incredible design of making <HI>Windham</HI> Secretary; <Q>“”who, besides his other unfitness,</Q> she said, <Q>“would be sure to joyn with” the other to lessen the King's kindness to her all they could.</Q> The Chan∣cellor, after he had made all the professions of duty to her Majesty which became him, and said what he really believ'd of the King's kindness and respect for her, asked her, <Q>“whether she would give him leave to take notice of any thing she had said to him, or, in general, that he found” her Majesty unsatisfied with the King's unkindness?</Q> The Queen re∣plied, <MILESTONE N="30"/> <Q>“that she was well contented he should take notice of every thing she had said; and, above all, of his purpose to make <HI>Windham”</HI> Secretary: of which the King had not made the least mention,</Q> though he had taken notice to him of most other things the Queen had said to him.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, shortly after, found an opportunity to inform the King of all that had passed from the Queen, in such a method as might give him occasion to enlarge upon all the particulars. <Q>The King heard him very greedily, and protested, “that he desired nothing more than to live very well with the Queen; towards whom he would never fail <MILESTONE N="40"/> in his Duty, as far as was consistent with his honour, and the good of his Affairs; which, at present, it may be, required more reservation towards the Queen, and to have it believ'd that he communicated less with Her than he did, or than he intended to do: that, if he did not seem to be desirous of her Company, it was only when she griev'd him by some importunities, in which he could not satisfy her; and that her exception against <HI>Elliot</HI> was very unjust; and that he knew well the Man to be very honest, and that he lov'd him well; and that the prejudice the King his Father had against him, was only by the malice of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who hated him without a cause, and had <MILESTONE N="50"/> likewise inform'd the Queen of some falsehoods, which had incensed” her Majesty against him;</Q> and seem'd throughout much concern'd to justify <HI>Elliot,</HI> against whom the Chancellor himself had no exceptions,
<PB N="246" REF="2640"/>
but receiv'd more respects from him than he paid to most other Men.</P>
<P>WHEN the Chancellor spoke of making <HI>Windham</HI> Secretary, the King did not own the having promised to do it, but <Q>“that he intended” to do it:</Q> the Chancellor said, <Q>“he was glad he had not promised it; and that he hoped, he would never do it: that he was an honest Gen∣tleman,” but in no degree qualified for that Office.</Q> He put him in mind of Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who was then there to present his Duty to him; <Q>“that he was a Person of such known affection and honesty,” that he could not do a more ungracious thing than to pass Him by.</Q> <Q>The King said, “he thought Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> to be a very honest <MILESTONE N="10"/> Man; but he had no title to that Office more than another Man: that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Windham</HI> had not any experience in that Employment, but that it depended so much upon forms, that he would quickly be in∣structed in it: that he was a very honest Man, for whom he had never done any thing, and had now nothing else to give him but this place; for which he doubted not but, in a short time, he would make him∣self” very fit.</Q> All that the Chancellor could prevail with his Majesty, was to suspend the doing it for some time, and that he would hear him again upon the Subject, before he took a final resolution. For the rest, he promised <Q>“to speak upon some particulars with the Queen, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and to live with her with all kindness and freedom, that she might” be in good humour.</Q> But he heard Her, and all others, very un∣willingly, who spoke against M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Windham</HI>'s parts for being Secretary of State.</P>
<P>ONE day the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> when the Chancellor and some others were present, told the King very gravely (according to his custom, who never smiled when he made others merry) <Q>“that he had an hum∣ble Suit to him, on the behalf of an old Servant of his Father's, and whom, he assured him upon his knowledge, his Father lov'd as well as he did any Man of that condition in <HI>England;</HI> and that he had <MILESTONE N="30"/> been for many years one of his Falconers; and he did really believe” him to be one of the best Falconers in <HI>England;</HI></Q> and thereupon en∣larged himself (as he could do very well, in all the terms of that Science) to shew how very skilful he was in that art. <Q>The King asked him, “”what he would have him do for him?</Q> <HI>Cottington</HI> told him, <Q>“it was very true that his Majesty kept no Falconers, and the poor Man was grown old, and could not ride as he had used to do; but that he was a very honest Man, and could read very well, and had as audi∣ble” a voice as any Man need to have;</Q> and therefore besought his Ma∣jesty, <Q>“”that he would make him his Chaplain;</Q> which speaking with <MILESTONE N="40"/> so composed a Countenance, and somewhat of earnestness, the King looked upon him with a smile to know what he meant; when He, with the same gravity, assured him, <Q>“the Falconer was in all respects as fit” to be his Chaplain, as Colonel <HI>Windham</HI> was to be Secretary of State;</Q> which so surprised the King, who had never spoken to him of the mat∣ter, all that were present being not able to abstain from laughing, that his Majesty was somewhat out of countenance: and this being mer∣rily told by some of the Standers by, it grew to be a story in all Com∣panies, and did really divert the King from the purpose, and made the other so much ashamed of pretending to it, that there was no more <MILESTONE N="$$"/> discourse of it.</P>
<P>WHILST all Endeavours were used to compose all ill humours here, that the King might prosecute his intended Voyage for <HI>Ireland,</HI> there
<PB N="247" REF="2650"/>
came very ill news from <HI>Ireland.</HI> Assoon as the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An account of the affairs in</HI> Ireland <HI>after the Marquis of</HI> Ormond<HI>'s arrival there.</HI></NOTE> was arriv'd, as hath been said before, the Confederate Catholicks, who held their assembly, as they had allways done, at <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> sent Com∣missioners to him to congratulate his Arrival, and to enter upon a Treaty of Peace, that they might all return to their obedience to the King. But the inconstancy of that Nation was such, that, notwithstanding their ex∣perience of the ruin they had brought upon themselves by their falling from their former Peace, and notwithstanding that themselves had sent to <HI>Paris</HI> to importune the Queen and the Prince to send the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> back to them, with all promises and protestations that they <MILESTONE N="10"/> would not insist upon any unreasonable concessions; now he was come upon their invitation to them, they made new demands in point of Re∣ligion, and insisted upon other things, which if he should consent to, would have irreconcil'd all the <HI>English,</HI> who were under the Lord <HI>Inchi∣quin,</HI> upon whom his principal confidence was placed: By this means so much time was spent, that the Winter passed without any agreement; whereby they might have advanc'd against the Parliament Forces, which were then weak, and in want of all manner of supplies, whilst the dis∣tractions continu'd in <HI>England</HI> between the Parliament and the Army, the divisions in the Army, and the prosecution of the King; during <MILESTONE N="20"/> which the Governours there had work enough to look to themselves; and left <HI>Ireland</HI> to provide for it self: and if that unfortunate People would have made use of the advantages that were offer'd, that Kingdom might indeed have been entirely reduced to the King's obedience.</P>
<P>THAT the Lord Lieutenant might even compel them to preserve themselves, he went himself to <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> where the Council sate, about <HI>Christmas,</HI> after three months had been spent from his arrival, that no more time might be lost in their Commissioner's coming and going, and that the Spring might not be lost as well as the Winter. And at last a Peace was made and concluded; by which, against such a day, <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Confederate Catholicks oblig'd themselves, <Q>“to bring into the field, a body of Horse and Foot, with all provisions for the field, which should be at the disposal of the Lord Lieutenant, and to march as” he should appoint.</Q> The Treaty had been drawn out into the more length, in hope to have brought the whole Nation to the same agree∣ment. And the General Assembly, to which they all pretended to submit, and from which all had receiv'd their Commissions, as hath been said, sent to <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> who remain'd in <HI>Ulster</HI> with his Army, and came not himself to <HI>Klikenny,</HI> as he had promis'd to have done, upon pre∣tence of his Indisposition of health. <Q>He profess'd “to submit to what∣soever” <MILESTONE N="40"/> the General Assembly should determine: but when they sent the Articles, to which they had agreed, to be sign'd by him, he took several exceptions, especially in matters of Religion;</Q> which he thought was not enough provided for; and, in the end, positively declar'd <Q>“that” he would not submit,</Q> or be bound by them: and at the same time he sent to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <Q>“that he would treat with him apart,” and not concern himself in what the Assembly resolv'd upon.</Q></P>
<P>THE truth is, there was nothing of Religion in this contention; which proceeded from the Animosity between the two Generals, <HI>O Neile</HI> and <HI>Pre∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> and the bitter Faction between the old <HI>Irish</HI> and the other, who were as <MILESTONE N="50"/> much hated by the old, as the <HI>English</HI> were; and lastly, from the ambition of <HI>Owen O Neile;</HI> who expected some concessions to be made to him in his own particular, which would very much have offended and incensed
<PB N="248" REF="2660"/>
the other party, if they had been granted to him: so that the Assembly was well pleas'd to leave him out, and concluded the Peace without him.</P>
<P>HEREUPON the Lord Lieutenant used all possible endeavours that the Army might be form'd, and ready to march in the beginning of the Spring. And though there was not an appearance answerable to their promise, yet their Troops seem'd so good, and were so numerous, that he thought fit to march towards <HI>Dublin:</HI> and, in the way, to take all Castles and Garrisons, which were possess'd by the Parliament: in which they had very good Success. For many of the Parliament Soldiers hav∣ing serv'd the King, they took the first opportunity, upon the Marquis <MILESTONE N="10"/> of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s approach within any distance, to come to him; and by that means several places surrender'd likewise to him. Colonel <HI>Monk,</HI> who had formerly serv'd the King, and remain'd, for the space of three or four years, Prisoner in the Tower, had been at last prevail'd with by the Lord <HI>Lisle</HI> to serve the Parliament against the <HI>Irish;</HI> pleasing himself with an opinion that he did not therein serve against the King. He was at this time Governour of <HI>Dundalk,</HI> a Garrison about thirty miles from <HI>Dublin;</HI> which was no sooner summon'd <HI>(Tredagh,</HI> and those at a nearer distance, being taken) but he was compell'd by his own Soldiers to deliver it up; and if the Officer who commanded the party which <MILESTONE N="20"/> summon'd him, had not been his Friend, and thereby hoped to have re∣duced him to the King's service, his Soldiers would have thrown him over the Walls, and made their own conditions afterwards; and most of that Garrison betook themselves to the King's service.</P>
<P>UPON all these Encouragements, before the Troops were come up to make the Army as numerous as it might have been, the Marquis was perswaded to block up <HI>Dublin</HI> at a very little distance; having good <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>blocks up</HI> Dublin.</NOTE> reason to hope, from the smallness of the Garrison, and a party of well affected People within the Town, that it would in a short time have been given up to him. In the mean time, he us'd all the means he could to <MILESTONE N="30"/> hasten the <HI>Irish</HI> Troops, some whereof were upon their march, and others not yet rais'd, to come up to the Army. By all their Letters from <HI>Lon∣don</HI> (with which, by the way of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and the Ports of <HI>Munster,</HI> there was good Intelligence) they understood, that there were fifteen hundred, or two thousand Men shipp'd for <HI>Ireland:</HI> and the wind hav∣ing been for some time against their coming for <HI>Dublin,</HI> there was an apprehension that they might be gone for <HI>Munster:</HI> whereupon the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> who was not confident of all his Garrisons there, very <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> In∣chiquin <HI>de∣parts from him for</HI> Mun∣ster.</NOTE> unhappily departed with some Troops of Horse to look after his Pro∣vince; there being then no cause to apprehend any sally out of <HI>Dublin,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> where they were not in a condition to look out of their own Walls. But he was not gone above two days, when the wind coming fair, the Ships expected came into the Port of <HI>Dublin;</HI> and landed a greater num∣ber <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Recruits land at</HI> Dublin <HI>from</HI> England.</NOTE> of Soldiers, especially of Horse, than was reported; and brought the News that <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself was made Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in∣tended to be shortly there with a very great supply of Horse and Foot. This Fleet that was already come, had brought arms, and cloaths, and mo∣ney, and victuals; which much exalted the Garrison and the City; which presently turn'd out of the Town some of those who were sus∣pected to wish well to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and imprison'd others. <MILESTONE N="50"/> The second day after the arrival of the succours, <HI>Jones,</HI> who had been a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jones <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s out of</HI> Dublin, <HI>and beats the Marquis of</HI> Ormond▪ <HI>Army</HI></NOTE> Lawyer, and was then Governour of <HI>Dublin,</HI> at Noon-day, march'd out of the City, with a Body of three thousand Foot, and three or four
<PB N="249" REF="2670"/>
Troops of Horse, and fell upon that Quarter which was next the Town; where they found so little resistance that they adventur'd upon the next; and in short so disorder'd the whole Army, one half whereof was on the other side the River, that the Lord Lieutenant, after he had, in the head of some Officers whom he drew together, charg'd the Enemy with the loss of many of those who follow'd him, was at last compell'd to draw off the whole Army, which was so discomfited, that he did not think fit to return them again to their Posts, till both the Troops which he had were refresh'd, and compos'd, and their Numbers encreas'd by the Le∣vies which ought to have been made before, and which were now in a <MILESTONE N="10"/> good forwardness.</P>
<P>IT may be remember'd, that the general Insurrections in the last year, the revolt of the Navy, and the Invasion of the <HI>Scots,</HI> encouraged and drawn in by the Presbyterian Party, had so disturb'd and obstructed the Counsels both in the Parliament, and in the Army, that nothing had been done in all that year towards the relief of <HI>Ireland,</HI> except the sending over the Lord <HI>Lisle</HI> as Lieutenant, with a Commission that was determin'd at the end of so many months, and which had given so little relief to the <HI>English,</HI> that it only discover'd more their weakness, and animosity towards each other, than obstructed the <HI>Irish</HI> in making <MILESTONE N="$0"/> their progress in all the parts of the Kingdom; and the more confirm'd the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> to pursue his Resolutions of serving the King, and of receiving the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> how meanly soever attended, and to unite with the <HI>Irish;</HI> the persecting of which conjunction, with so general a success, brought so great reproach upon the Parliament, with reference to the loss of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that the noise thereof was very great: So that <HI>Cromwell</HI> thought it high time, in his own Person, to appear <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>made Lord Lieutenant of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> upon a State of so great Action. There had been allways Men enough to be spar'd out of the Army to have been sent upon that Expedition, when the other difficulties were at highest; but the conducting it then <MILESTONE N="30"/> was of that importance, that it was, upon the matter, to determine which power should be superior, the Presbyterian or the Independent. And therefore the one had set up and design'd <HI>Waller</HI> for that command, and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> against Him and that party, had insisted, that it should be given to <HI>Lambert,</HI> the second Man of the Army, who was known to have as great a detestation of the Presbyterian power, as he had of the Prerogative of the Crown: and the Contests between the two Factions, which of these should be sent, had spent a great part of the last year, and of their Winter counsels. But now, when all the Domestick differences were compos'd by their successes in the field, and the bloody prosecution <MILESTONE N="40"/> of their civil counsels, so that there could be little done to the distur∣bance of the Peace of <HI>England,</HI> and when <HI>Waller</HI>'s friends were so sup∣press'd, that he was no more thought of, <HI>Cromwell</HI> began to think that the committing the whole Government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with such an Army as was necessary to be sent thither, was too great a Trust even for his beloved <HI>Lambert</HI> himself, and was to lessen his own power and autho∣rity, both in the Army which was commanded by <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and in the other, that, being in <HI>Ireland,</HI> would, upon any occasion, have great in∣fluence upon the Affairs of <HI>England.</HI> And therefore, whilst there appear'd no other obstructions in the relief of <HI>Ireland</HI> (which was every day loudly <MILESTONE N="50"/> call'd for) than the determining who should take that Charge, some of his Friends, who were allways ready upon such occasions, on a suddain propos'd <HI>Cromwell</HI> Himself the Lieutenant General, to conduct that Expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="2680"/>
CROMWELL himself was allways absent when such overtures were to be made; and whoever had propos'd <HI>Lambert,</HI> had propos'd it as a thing most agreeable to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s desire; and therefore, when they heard <HI>Cromwell</HI> Himself proposed for the service, and by those who they were sure intended him no affront, they immediatlely acquiesced in the Proposition, and look'd upon the change as a good expedient: on the other side, the Presbyterian party was no less affected, and concluded that this was only a trick to defer the service, and that he never did in∣tend to go thither in Person; or that if he did, his absence from <HI>England</HI> would give them all the advantages they could wish, and that they <MILESTONE N="$$"/> should then recover entirely their General <HI>Fairfax</HI> to their Party; who was already much broken in spirit upon the concurrence he had been drawn to, and declar'd some bitterness against the Persons who had led him to it. And so in a moment both Parties were agreed, and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> elected and declar'd to be Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with as ample, and independent a Commission, as could be prepar'd.</P>
<P>CROMWELL, how little surprised soever with this designation, ap∣pear'd the next day in the House full of confusion and irresolution; which the natural temper, and composure of his understanding could hardly avoid, when he least desir'd it; and therefore, when it was now to his <MILESTONE N="20"/> purpose, he could act it to the life. <Q>And after much hesitation, and ma∣ny expressions of “his own unworthiness, and disability to support so great a Charge, and of the entire resignation of himself to Their com∣mands, and absolute dependence upon God's providence and blessing,” from whom he had receiv'd many Instances of his Favour,</Q> he sub∣mitted to their good will and pleasure; and desir'd them <Q>“that no more time might be lost in the preparations which were to be made for so great a Work: for he did confefs that Kingdom to be reduced to so great streights, that he was willing to engage his own Person in this expedi∣tion, for the difficulties which appear'd in it; and more out of hope, with <MILESTONE N="30"/> the hazard of his life, to give some obstruction to the successes which” the Rebels were at present exalted with</Q> (for so he call'd the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and all who joyn'd with him) <Q>“that so the Common-Wealth might retain still some footing in that Kingdom, till they might be able to send fresh supplies, than out of any expectation, that, with the strength he carried, he should be able, in any signal degree, to prevail over” them.</Q></P>
<P>IT was an incredible expedition that he used from this minute after <NOTE PLACE="marg">He provides Forces for his going thither.</NOTE> his assuming that Charge, in the raising of money, providing of shipping, and drawing of Forces together, for this enterprise. Before he could <MILESTONE N="40"/> be ready gimself to march, he sent three thousand Foot and Horse to <HI>Milsord</HI> Haven, to be transported, assoon as they arriv'd there, to <HI>Dub∣lin;</HI> all things being ready there for their transportation; which Troops, by the contrary winds, were constrain'd to remain there for many days. And that caused the report in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the intelligence from <HI>London,</HI> that <HI>Cromwell</HI> intended to make a descent in <HI>Munster;</HI> which unhap∣pily divided the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> and a good Body of his Men from the Lord Lieutenant, as hath been said, when he march'd towards <HI>Dublin.</HI> Nor did the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> in truth at that time intend to have march'd thither with that expedition, until his Army should be grown <MILESTONE N="50"/> more numerous, and more accustom'd to discipline, but the wonderful successes of those Troops, which were sent before, in the taking of <HI>Trim, Dundalk,</HI> and all the out Garrisons, and the invitation and intelligence
<PB N="251" REF="2690"/>
he had from within <HI>Dublin,</HI> made him unwilling to lose any more time, since he was sure that the crossness of the Wind only hinder'd the ar∣rival of those Supplies, which were design'd thither out of <HI>England:</HI> and the arrival of those Supplies, the very day before his coming be∣fore <HI>Dublin,</HI> enabled the Governour thereof to make that Sally which is mention'd before; and had that Success which is mention'd.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> at that time, drew off his whole Army from <HI>Dublin</HI> to <HI>Tredagh,</HI> where he meant to remain till he could put it into such a posture, that he might prosecute his farther design. And a full account of all these particulars met <HI>Cromwell</HI> at his arrival at <MILESTONE N="10"/> <HI>Milford</HI> Haven, when he rather expected to hear of the loss of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and was in great perplexity to resolve what he was then to do. But all those clouds being dispersed, upon the news of the great success his Party had that he had sent before, he deferr'd not to embark his whole Army, and, with a very prosperous wind, arriv'd at <HI>Dublin</HI> within two <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>arrives at</HI> Dublin.</NOTE> or three days after the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had retired from thence; where he was receiv'd with wonderful Acclamation; which did not re∣tard him from pursuing his active resolutions, to improve those advan∣tages had already befallen him. And the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> was no sooner advertised of his arrival, than he concluded to change his for∣mer <MILESTONE N="20"/> resolution, and to draw his Army to a greater distance, till those Parties which were marching towards him from the several Quarters of the Kingdom, might come up to him; and in the mean while to put <HI>Tredagh</HI> into so good a posture, as might entertain the Enemy, till he might be able to relieve them. And so he put into that place, which was looked upon, besides the strength of the Situation, to be in a good degree fortified, the flower of his Army, both of Soldiers and Officers, most of them <HI>English,</HI> to the number of three thousand Foot, and two or three good Troops of Horse, provided with all things; and com∣mitted the charge and command thereof to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur Aston,</HI> who hath <MILESTONE N="30"/> been often mention'd before, and was an Officer of great name and ex∣perience, and who at that time made little doubt of defending it against all the power of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> for at least a Month's time. And the Mar∣quis of <HI>Ormond</HI> made less doubt, in much less time, to relieve and suc∣cour it with his Army; and so retired to those parts where he had ap∣pointed a Rendezvous for his new Levies.</P>
<P>THIS News coming to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Germain</HI>'s, broke all their Measures, at <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This News de∣lays the King's Voyage into</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> least as to the Expedition: the resolution continued for <HI>Ireland;</HI> but it was thought fit that they should expect another account from thence, before the King begun his journey; nor did it seem counsellable that <MILESTONE N="40"/> his Majesty should venture to Sea whilst the Parliament Fleet com∣manded the Ocean, and were then about the Coast of <HI>Ireland;</HI> but that he should expect the Autumn, when the Season of the year would call home, or disperse the Ships. But where to stay so long was the que∣stion; for it was now the Month of <HI>August,</HI> and as the King had re∣ceiv'd no kind of civility from <HI>France,</HI> since his last coming, so it was notorious enough that his absence was impatiently desired by that Court; and the Queen, who found her self disappointed of that Dominion which she had expected, resolv'd to merit from the Cardinal by freeing him from a Guest that was so unwelcome to them, though he had not been <MILESTONE N="50"/> in any degree chargeable to them; and so was not at all sollicitous for his longer stay. So his Majesty consider'd how he should make his de∣parture; and, upon looking round, he resolv'd, that he would make his
<PB N="252" REF="2700"/>
journey through <HI>Normandy,</HI> and embark himself for his Island of <HI>Jer∣sey;</HI> which still continued under his obedience, and under the Govern∣ment of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Carteret;</HI> who had in truth the power over the place, though he was but the Lieutenant of the Lord <HI>Jermyn;</HI> who, in those streights the King was in, and the great plenty he himself enjoyed, was wonderfully jealous that the King's being there would lessen some of the profit, which he challenged from thence; and therefore, when it was found, in order to the King's Support, whilst he should stay there, necessary to sell some of the King's demesnes in that Island, the yearly rent whereof used to be receiv'd by that Lord towards the discharge of <MILESTONE N="10"/> the Garrisons there, he insisted, with all possible importunity, <Q>“that some of the Money, which should be raised upon that Sale, should be paid to Him, because his receipt, for the time to come, would not” remain so great as it had been formerly: and though this demand ap∣pear'd so unjust,</Q> and unreasonable, that the Council could not admit it, yet he did prevail with the King in private, to give him such a Note under his hand, as enabled him to receive a good Su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Money, after the return of his Majesty into <HI>England,</HI> upon that consideration. <Q>This Resolution being taken for <HI>Jersey,</HI> the King sent to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> “that he would cause two Ships of War to ride in the rode before S<SUP>r</SUP>” <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Maloes</HI></Q> (which they might do without notice) <Q>“and that he might have a Warrant remain in his hands, by which the Ships might attend” his Majesty, when he should require them;</Q> which they might do in very few hours; and in these he meant to transport himself, assoon as it should be seasonable, into <HI>Ireland.</HI> These Ships did wait his pleasure there accordingly.</P>
<P>FRANCE had too good an excuse at this time for not giving the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> France <HI>whilst the King was at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> any assistance in Money, which he might expect, and did abundantly want, by the ill condition their own Affairs were in. Though the se∣dition which had been raised in <HI>Paris</HI> the last Winter, was at present <MILESTONE N="30"/> so much appeased by the courage, and conduct of the Prince of <HI>Condè</HI> (who brought the Army, which he commanded in <HI>Flanders,</HI> with so great expedition before <HI>Paris,</HI> that the City yielded to reason) so that his most Christian Majesty, the Queen his Mother, and the whole Court, were at this present there; yet the wound was far from being closed up. The Town continued still in ill humour; more of the great Men adher'd to them than had done before; the Animosities against the Car∣dinal increased, and, which made those Animosities the more terrible, the Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> who surely had merited very much, either unsa∣tisfied, or not to be satisfied, broke his friendship with the Cardinal, and <MILESTONE N="40"/> spoke with much bitterness against him: So that the Court was far from being in that tranquillity, as to concern it self much for the King our Master, if it had been otherwise well inclined to it.</P>
<P>ALL things standing thus, about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King leaves S<SUP>t</SUP></HI> Ger∣main<HI>'s; and goes towards</HI> Jersey.</NOTE> left S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Germain</HI>'s, and begun his journey towards <HI>Jersey;</HI> and the Queen, the next day, remov'd from thence to <HI>Paris</HI> to the <HI>Louvre.</HI> The two Embassadours for <HI>Spain</HI> waited upon her Majesty thither, having no∣thing now to do but to prepare themselves for their journey to <HI>Spain,</HI> where they longed to be, and whither they had sent for a Pass to meet them at S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sebastian</HI>'s, and that they might have a House provided for <MILESTONE N="50"/> them at <HI>Madrid,</HI> against the time they should come thither: both which they recommended to an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman, who liv'd there, to sollicite, and advertise them in their journey of the temper of that Court.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="2710"/>
THEY thought it convenient, since they were to desire a Pass to go from <HI>Paris</HI> into <HI>Spain,</HI> that they should wait upon the Queen Mother of <HI>France,</HI> and the Cardinal; and likewise upon the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Condè;</HI> who were then in a Cabal against the Court. The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> spoke so publickly, and so warmly against the Car∣dinal, that most People thought the Cardinal undone; and he himself apprehended some attempt upon his Person; and therefore had not in many days gone out of his House, and admitted few to come to him, and had a strong Guard in every room; so that his fear was not dis∣sembled. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>IN this so general disorder, the Embassadours declined any formal Audiences; for which their Equipage was not suitable: so the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> went privately to the Queen Regent, who receiv'd him gra∣ciously, and desired him <Q>“to recommend her very kindly to her Brother” the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> without enlarging upon any thing else.</Q> From Her he went to the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> whom he found in more disorder; and when the Embassadour told him, <Q>“he came to know whether he had” any Service to command him into <HI>Spain,</HI> the Duke,</Q> who scarce stood still whilst he was speaking, answer'd aloud, <Q>“that he had nothing to” do with <HI>Spain;</HI> and so went hastily into another room;</Q> and the Lord <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Cottington</HI> then withdrew. They intended both to have gone together to the Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> and to the Cardinal. But when they sent to the Prince, he wisely, but with great civility, sent them word, <Q>“that they could not be ignorant of the disorder that Court was in, and of” the jealousies which were of him;</Q> and therefore desired them <Q>“to ex∣cuse” him, that he did not see them.</Q></P>
<P>THE Cardinal appointed them a time; and accordingly they met, and conferr'd together about half an hour, the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> speak∣ing <HI>Spanish,</HI> and the Cardinal and He conferring wholely in that Lan∣guage. The Cardinal acknowledged the apprehension he was in, in his <MILESTONE N="30"/> looks; and took occasion in his discourse to mention <Q>“the unjust dis∣pleasure,” which Monsieur <HI>le Prince</HI> had conceiv'd against him.</Q> He seem'd earnestly to desire a Peace between the two Crowns; and said, <Q>“”that he would give a pound of his blood to obtain it;</Q> and desir'd the Embassadours <Q>“to tell <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> from him, that he would with all his heart meet him upon the Frontiers; and that he was con∣fident, if they two were together but three hours, they should com∣pose” all differences: which Message he afterwards disavow'd,</Q> when <HI>Don Lewis</HI> accepted the motion, and was willing to have met him. When they took their leave of him, he brought them to the top of <MILESTONE N="40"/> the stairs in disorder enough, his Guards being very circumspect, and suffering no stranger to approach any of the rooms.</P>
<P>THEY begun their journey from <HI>Paris</HI> upon <HI>Michaelmas</HI> day, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Cottin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton <HI>and the Chan∣cellor be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n their journey for</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pain, <HI>and arrive at</HI> Bourdeaux.</NOTE> continu'd it, without resting one day, till they came to <HI>Bourdeaux;</HI> which was then in Rebellion against the King. The City and the Par∣liament had not only sent several complaints, and bitter invectives against the Duke of <HI>Espernon,</HI> their Governour, for his Acts of Ty∣ranny in his Government, but had presum'd, in order to make his Per∣son the more ungracious, to asperse his life and manners with those reproaches which they believ'd would most reflect upon the Court. And <MILESTONE N="50"/> the truth is, their greatest quarrel against him was, that he was a fast friend to the Cardinal, and would not be divided from his Interest. They had driven the Duke out of the Town, and did not only desire
<PB N="254" REF="2720"/>
the King <Q>“that he might no more be their Governour; but that his” Majesty would give the Government to the Prince of <HI>Condè;</HI></Q> which made their complaints the less consider'd as just. And it was then one of the most avow'd exceptions that Prince had against the Cardinal, that he had not that Government upon the Petition of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> since he offer'd to resign his of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> which was held to be of as much Value, to accommodate and repair the Duke of <HI>Espernon.</HI> At <HI>Blay,</HI> the Embassadours were visited by the Marshal of <HI>Plessy Praslin,</HI> who had been sent by the Court to treat with the Parliament of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> but could bring them to no reason, they positively insisting upon the re∣move <MILESTONE N="10"/> of their old Governour, and conferring the Command upon the Prince. When they came to <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> they found the <HI>Château Trom∣pette,</HI> which still held for the King, shooting at the Town, the Town having invested it very close, that no Succour could be put into them, the Duke of <HI>Espernon</HI> being at his House at <HI>Cadilliac,</HI> from whence his Horse every day infested the Citizens when they stirr'd out of the Town. Here the Embassadours were compell'd to stay one whole day, the dis∣orders upon the River, and in the Town, not suffering their Coaches and Baggage to follow them so soon as they should have done. They were here visited by some Counsellors, and Presidents of the Parliament; <MILESTONE N="20"/> who professed duty to their King, but irreconcilable hatred to the Duke of <HI>Espernon;</HI> against whom they had published several Remonstrances in print, and dedicated them to the Prince of <HI>Condè.</HI> After a day's rest there, which was not unwelcome to them, they continued their journey to <HI>Bayonne;</HI> and arriv'd, upon the twentieth day from their leaving <HI>Paris,</HI> at the <HI>Taio;</HI> where they took boat, and in an hour or two ar∣riv'd at <HI>Girona.</HI> The next day they went by the River to <HI>Passage,</HI> and when they came out of their boats, which were row'd by Women, ac∣cording to their Privilege there, they found Mules, sent from S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Se∣bastian</HI>'s to carry them thither. About half a mile from the Town they <MILESTONE N="30"/> were met by the Governour of <HI>Guipuscoa, Don Antonio de Cardinas,</HI> an old Soldier, and a Knight of the Order, the <HI>Corregidor</HI> and all the Magistrates of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Sebastian</HI>'s, and the <HI>English</HI> Merchants which inhabited there; and were conducted by the Governour to one of the best Houses in the Town, which was provided for their reception; where they no sooner were, than the Governour, and the rest of the Magistrates, took their leave of them.</P>
<P>THEY had not been half an hour in their Lodging, conferring with the <HI>English</HI> Merchants, about conveniencies to prosecute their journey, when the <HI>Corregidor</HI> came to them, and desired to speak with them in <MILESTONE N="40"/> private, and after some compliment and apology, he shew'd them a Letter, which he had receiv'd from the Secretary of State; the contents whereof were, <Q>“that when the Embassadours of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> should arrive there, they should be receiv'd with all respect; but that he should find some means to perswade them to stay and remain there, till he should give the King notice of it, and receive his farther plea∣sure.”</Q> And at the same time an <HI>English</HI> Merchant of the Town, who had told them before, that he had Letters from <HI>Madrid</HI> for them, and had gone home to fetch them, brought them a Pacquet from S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ben∣jamin Wright;</HI> who was intrusted by them to sollicite at <HI>Madrid</HI> for <MILESTONE N="50"/> their Pass, and for a House to be prepared for them. In this Letter their Pass was inclosed, under the same Style, as Embassadours from the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> which he had observ'd upon the place, and desired
<PB N="255" REF="2730"/>
to have it mended, but could procure no alteration, nor could he ob∣tain any Order for the providing a House for them; but was told, <Q>“that” it should be done time enough.</Q> This was an unexpected mortification to them; but they seem'd not to be troubled at it, as if they had in∣tended to stay there a Month, to refresh themselves after their long journey, and in expectation of other Letters from the King their Ma∣ster. The <HI>Corregidor</HI> offer'd to send away an Express the same night, which they accepted of; and writ to <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> <Q>“that the King their Master had sent them his Embassadours to his Catholick Majesty, upon affairs of the highest importance: that they were come <MILESTONE N="10"/> so far on their way, but had, to their great wonder, met there with a signification of that King's pleasure, that they should stay and re∣main there, till they should receive his Majestie's farther Orders; which troubled them not so much, as to find themselves styled the Embassadours of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> which they thought very strange, after his Catholick Majesty had sent an Embassadour to the King their Master before they left him: they desired therefore to know, whe∣ther their Persons were unacceptable to his Catholick Majesty, and if That were the case, they would immediately return to their Master; otherwise, if his Majesty were content to receive them, they desired <MILESTONE N="20"/> they might be treated in that manner as was due to the honour and dignity of the King their Master. And they writ to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Benjamin Wright,</HI> to attend <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> and if he found that they were expected at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that they reform'd the Errors they had committed, he should then use those importunities, which were necessary for the pro∣viding” a House for them against they should come.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH the Court was then full of business, being in daily expecta∣tion of their new Queen; who was landed, and at that time within few days journey of <HI>Madrid;</HI> yet the very next day after the Letter was deliver'd to <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> he return'd an Answer full of civility, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and imputed the error that was committed, to the negligence, or igno∣rance of the Secretary; and sent them new Passes in the proper Style; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Passes are sent to them.</NOTE> and assured them, <Q>“that they should find a very good welcome from” his Majesty.</Q> And S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI> sent them word, <Q>“that he had receiv'd the Warrant for the providing the House; and the Officer, to whom it was directed, had called upon him to view two or three Houses; and that <HI>Don Lewis</HI> told him, that assoon as he had found a House that pleased him, Orders should be given to the King's Officers of the Wardrobe to furnish it; and then when the Embassadours came, there should be one of the King's Coaches to attend them whilst they” <MILESTONE N="40"/> stayed.</Q> Hereupon they made hast in their journey, with some satis∣faction and confidence that they should find a Court not so hard to treat with, that could begin to receive them with so bare-faced and form'd an Affront, and then so easily recede from it with weak Apologies. And it was plain enough, that they heartily wish'd that they had not come; and imagin'd that this might put them to return again, and then were ashamed of their own Expedient, and being pressed, chose rather to de∣cline than avow it: So unnatural a thing is it for that Court to stoop to any ugly Action, without doing it so ungraciously, as to confess it in their own Countenance, and quickly receding from it. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>IT was about the middle of <HI>November</HI> when they left S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Sebastian</HI>'s, the Weather yet continuing fair; and a Gentleman of Quality of the Country was appointed to accompany them out of the jurisdiction of
<PB N="256" REF="2740"/>
<HI>Guipuscoa,</HI> which was to the City of <HI>Victoria;</HI> and from thence they enter'd into <HI>Castile.</HI> When they came to <HI>Alcavendas,</HI> within three Leagues of <HI>Madrid,</HI> they sent to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI> to know what House was provided for them: he came to them, and told them, <Q>“all things were in the same state they were when he writ to them to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Se∣bastian</HI>'s; that though <HI>Don Lewis</HI> gave him very good words, and seem'd much troubled and angry with the Officers that the House was not ready, and the Officers excused themselves upon the jollities the Town was in during the <HI>Fiestas,</HI> which were held every day for the Queen's arrival, that no body could attend any particular affair, yet <MILESTONE N="$$"/> it was evident there was not that care taken from the Court that there ought to have been, and that <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas</HI> from <HI>England</HI> had done the Embassadours all the ill offices possible, as if their good reception in <HI>Spain</HI> would incense the Parliament, and make them more propitious to <HI>France,</HI> which valued it self upon having driven all the” Royal Family from thence.</Q></P>
<P>UPON this new Mortification, they writ again from thence to <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> to desire <Q>“that they might not be put to stay there for want of” a House, and so be exposed to contempt.</Q> Nor were they accommo∣dated in that place in any degree. He allways answer'd their Letters <MILESTONE N="20"/> with great punctuality, and with courtesy enough, as if all things should be ready by the next day. The <HI>English</HI> Merchants, who resided at <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI> came every day to visit them, but still brought them word, that there was no appearance of any provision made to receive them; so that, after a week's stay in that little Town, and ill accommodation, they ac∣cepted the civil offer and invitation, which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI> made them, of reposing themselves <HI>incognito</HI> in his House; which would only receive their Persons with a <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> for each; and the rest of their family was quarter'd in the next adjacent Houses for the re∣ception of Strangers; so they went privately in the evening into <HI>Ma∣drid</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They go into</HI> Madrid in∣cognito; <HI>and lodge at first at S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Benja∣min Wright<HI>'s House.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"/> in S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI>'s Coach, and came to his House: and if, by His generosity, they had not been thus accommodated, they must have been exposed to reproach and infamy, by the very little respect they receiv'd from the Court. This S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI> was a Gentle∣man of a good family in <HI>Essex;</HI> and, being a younger Brother, had been bred a Merchant in <HI>Madrid;</HI> where he had great business, and great reputation; and, having married a Wife of the Family of <HI>Toledo,</HI> was become a perfect <HI>Spaniard,</HI> not only in the Language, but in the generous part of their Nature and Customs.</P>
<P>THE Court well enough knew of their Arrival, but took no notice <MILESTONE N="40"/> of it. The Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> therefore sent to <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> to desire that he might have a private Audience of him <HI>incognito;</HI> which he presently consented to, and appointed, the next morning, to meet in the King's Gar∣den; which was at such a distance from the Court, that it was not in the view of it. There they met at the hour: <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was a Man of little ceremony, and used no flourishes in his discourses, which made most Men believe that he said all things from his heart; and he seem'd to speak so cordially, that the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> who was not easy to be imposed upon, did think that they should have a House very speedily, and that he had a good inclination to favour them in what they came <MILESTONE N="50"/> about. He spoke, with more commotion than was natural to him, in the business of the Murther of the King; excused all the omissions towards the Embassadours; <Q>“which should be repair'd out of hand, after
<PB N="257" REF="2750"/>
the few days, which yet remain'd to be spent in <HI>Fiestas</HI> for the Queen; during which time, he said, no Officers would obey any orders that” diverted them from the sight of the Triumphs;</Q> and wish'd <Q>“that the Embassadours would see the Masquerade that afternoon, and the <HI>Toros”</HI> the day following.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> return'd home very well satisfied; and had not been half an hour in the House, when a Gentleman came from <HI>Don Lewis</HI> to invite the Embassadours to see those Exercises, which are men∣tion'd before; and sent them word that there should be places provided for them. The Chancellor went that afternoon to the place assign'd, <MILESTONE N="10"/> where he saw the Masquerade, and the running of the Course, and, afterwards, the <HI>Toros.</HI></P>
<P>AT the running of the Course, the King and <HI>Don Lewis</HI> run several Courses, in all which <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was too good a Courtier to win any prize, though he allways lost it by very little. The appearance of the People was very great, and the Ladies in all the windows made a very rich shew, otherwise the shew it self had nothing wonderful. Here there happen'd to be some suddain sharp words between the <HI>Admirante</HI> of <HI>Castile,</HI> a haughty young Man, and the Marquis <HI>de Liche,</HI> the eldest Son of <HI>Don Lewis de Haro;</HI> the which being taken notice of, they <MILESTONE N="20"/> were both dismiss'd the Squadrons wherein they were, and committed to their Chambers.</P>
<P>AT the Entertainment of the <HI>Toros</HI> there was another accident, the mention whereof is not unfit to shew the discipline, and severity of that Nation in the observation of order. It was remember'd, that at the Masquerade, the <HI>Admirante</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Liche</HI> were sent to their Chambers: and afterwards, the matter being examin'd, they were both commanded to leave the Town, and retire each to a House of his own, that was within three or four Leagues of the Town. The Marquis of <HI>Liche</HI> was known to have gone the next day, and no body <MILESTONE N="30"/> doubted the same of the <HI>Admirante,</HI> those orders being never disputed or disobey'd. The King as he was going to the <HI>Toros,</HI> either himself discern'd at another Balcony, or some body else advertised him of it, that the Duchess, who was Wife to the <HI>Admirante,</HI> was there; and said, <Q>“he knew that Lady was a Woman of more honour than to come out of her House, and be present at the <HI>Fiesta,</HI> whilst her Husband” was under restraint, and in his Majestie's displeasure;</Q> and therefore concluded that her Husband was likewise there; and thereupon sent an <HI>Alguazil</HI> to that room, with command to examine carefully with his Eye, whether the <HI>Admirante</HI> was there; for there appear'd none but <MILESTONE N="40"/> Women. The <HI>Admirante,</HI> being a young rash Man, much in the King's favour, and a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, thought he might un∣discerned see the Triumph of that day; and therefore caused himself to be dress'd in the habit of a Lady, which his age would well bear, and forced his Wife to go with him; who exceedingly resisted his Commands, well knowing to what reproach she expos'd her own honour, though she had no fear of his being discover'd. The <HI>Alguazil</HI> brought the King word, that he was very sure that the <HI>Admirante</HI> was there, in the habit of a Woman, and sat next his Wife among many other Ladies. Whereupon the King sent the Officer to apprehend him in the habit he <MILESTONE N="$$"/> was in, and to carry him to the Officer's own House. And assoon as the King return'd to the Palace, there was an Order that the <HI>Alguazil</HI> should the next morning carry the <HI>Admirante</HI> to <HI>Valladolid,</HI> four days
<PB N="258" REF="2760"/>
journey from <HI>Madrid,</HI> to a House of his own there; where he was con∣fin'd not to go out of the limits of that City; and under this restraint remain'd for the space of full three years: So penal a thing it is amongst that People, for any Man, of how great Quality soever (there was not in <HI>Spain</HI> a Man of greater than the <HI>Admirante</HI> of <HI>Castile)</HI> to disobey, or elude the judgement of the King.</P>
<P>IT may be thought impertinent to the work in hand, to make a di∣gression upon this Embassy, and to enlarge upon many circumstances which occurr'd in it, of the formality and constitution of that Court, of the nature and humour of that People, which may seem foreign to <MILESTONE N="10"/> the affairs of <HI>England.</HI> But since the King, after his leaving <HI>Paris,</HI> re∣mained <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣mains several Months in</HI> Jer∣sey.</NOTE> in <HI>Jersey</HI> for many Months, waiting such a revolution as might administer an opportunity and occasion to quit that retirement, in all which time there was no Action, or Counsel to be mention'd, and this being the first, and the only Embassy, in which his Majestie's person was represented, until his blessed return into <HI>England</HI> (for though some other Persons were afterwards sent to other Princes, with Commissions to per∣form that function, if they found Encouragement so to do, yet none assum'd that Character, nor were treated as such in any Court in Chri∣stendom, <HI>Spain</HI> only excepted) it may therefore be reasonably thought <MILESTONE N="20"/> not improper in this History, to give such a relation of this Negotia∣tion, that it may appear what sense so great a Court as that of <HI>Spain</HI> had of those Revolutions in <HI>England,</HI> and of the deplorable condition to which this young innocent Prince was reduced, when it was fully press'd to them in the most efficacious terms possible; and every circumstance of their reception, and treatment, may serve to illustrate those parti∣culars; and therefore we shall proceed farther in the relation of them.</P>
<P>BEFORE their Audience, <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> sent them word of <NOTE PLACE="marg">An account of the Embassa∣dour's Au∣dience.</NOTE> the imprisonment of the Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Longueville,</HI> and that Marshal <HI>Turin</HI> had made his Escape into <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Flanders;</HI> the news whereof gave the <HI>Spanish</HI> Court much trouble; for they had promis'd themselves a better harvest from that Seed, which they had carefully and industriously sown, and that thereby the Car∣dinal, whom they perfectly hated, would have been totally suppress'd, and all his power entirely taken from him; which, they concluded, would forthwith produce a Peace, which was not less desir'd in <HI>France</HI> than in <HI>Spain;</HI> or that those Princes, and all their Dependents, would have appear'd in Arms in that Kingdom; by which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> should be able to recover much of what they had lost in <HI>Flanders;</HI> the hopes of either of which appear'd now blasted by this unexpected revival of <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Cardinal's power.</P>
<P>UPON the day assign'd for the Audience, it being resolv'd that when they had ended with the King, they should likewise have one of the Queen, <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> sent Horses to their Lodging, for the ac∣commodation of the Embassadours, and their Servants: it being the fashion of that Court, that the Embassadours ride to their first Audience. And so they rode, being attended by all their own Servants, and all the <HI>English</HI> Merchants who liv'd in the Town, together with many <HI>Irish</HI> Officers who were in the service of his Catholick Majesty, all on Horse∣back; so that their Cavalcade appear'd very fair, all the Coaches of other <MILESTONE N="50"/> Embassadours likewise following them. In this manner they came to the Court about ten of the Clock in the morning, being conducted by an Officer, who had been sent to their Lodging, and rode with them to the Court.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="2770"/>
THROUGH several rooms, where there was only one Officer, who attended to open and shut the doors, they came to the room next that where his Majesty was; where, after a little stay, whilst their Conductor went in and out, they found the King standing upright, with his back against the Wall, and the Grandees at a distance, in the same posture, against the Wall. When they had made their several respects, and came to the King, he lightly moved his hat, and bid them cover: the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> spoke only general things, <Q>“of the confidence the King had in his Majesty's kindness, and that He believ'd his condition such, as that all the Kings of the World were concern'd to vindicate the wrong <MILESTONE N="10"/> he sustain'd: that this was the first Embassy he had sent, relying more upon the honour of his Majesty's nature and generosity, than upon” any other Prince;</Q> with discourses of the same nature: then they pre∣sented their Credentials.</P>
<P>THE King expressed a very tender Sense of our King's condition, and acknowledged <Q>“that it concern'd all Kings to joyn together for the pu∣nishment of such an impious Rebellion and Parricide; and if his own Affairs would permit it, he would be the first that would undertake it; but that they could not but know how full his hands were; and whilst he had so powerful an Adversary to contend with, he could <MILESTONE N="20"/> hardly defend himself; but that when there should be a Peace with” <HI>France</HI> (which he desired) the King,</Q> his <HI>Sobrino</HI> (for so he still called the King, his Nephew) <Q>“should find all he could expect from him; in the mean time he would be ready to do all that was in his power to∣wards” his assistance and relief.</Q> After the formal part was over, the King asked many questions, most with reference to his Sister, the Queen of <HI>France;</HI> and discoursed very intelligently of every thing; so that his defects proceeded only from the laziness of his mind, not from any want of understanding; and he seem'd then, when he was about eight and forty years of Age, to have great vigour of Body, having a clear <MILESTONE N="30"/> ruddy complection; yet he had been accustom'd to feavours from his debauches with Women, by which he was much wasted.</P>
<P>FROM the King they were conducted to the Queen; who used very few words, and spoke so low that she could scarce be heard; she stood, in the same manner the King did, against a Wall, and her Ladies on both sides as the Grandees did; the <HI>Insanta</HI> at a little distance from her, to whom likewise they made a compliment from their Master. The Queen was then about eighteen years of Age, not tall, round faced, and inclined to be fat. The <HI>Insanta</HI> was much lower, as she ought to be by her Age, but of a very lovely complection, without any help of Art, <MILESTONE N="40"/> which every one else in the room, even the Queen her self, was be∣holding to: and she was then the fullest of Spirit and Wit of any Lady in <HI>Spain,</HI> which she had not improv'd afterwards, when she had more years upon her. Their Audience ended, they return'd; and at last they <NOTE PLACE="marg">They have an House assign'd them.</NOTE> had a House provided for them in the <HI>Calle de Alcala,</HI> belonging to the Marquis of <HI>Villa Magna,</HI> to whom the King paid four hundred pounds sterling by the year.</P>
<P>THE Council of State at this time consisted of <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Medina de los Torres,</HI> Duke <HI>de Mounterey,</HI> Marquis of <HI>Castille Roderigo,</HI> Marquis <HI>de Vall-Periso,</HI> the <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Castrilio,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>Don Francisco de Melo;</HI> there were no more residing in that Court then; the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> residing constantly at his Government of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lucar,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Leganez</HI> being General against <HI>Portugal,</HI>

and so remaining ad <HI>Badajoz,</HI> and coming seldom to <HI>Madrid;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Arcos</HI> stood confined to his House, since the defection of <HI>Na∣ples</HI> when it was under his Government; and the <HI>Conde de Pignoranda</HI> was not yet come out of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>DON <HI>Lewis</HI> was as absolute a Favourite in the eyes of his Master, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Character of</HI> Don Lewis de Haro.</NOTE> had as entire a disposal of all his affections and faculties, as any Favou∣rite of that Age: nor was any thing transacted at home, or abroad, but by His direction and determination: and yet of all the Favourites of that, or any other time, no Man ever did so little alone, or seem'd less to enjoy the delight and empire of a Favourite. In the most ordi∣nary <MILESTONE N="10"/> occurrences, which, for the difficulty, required little deliberation, and in the nature of them required expedition, he would give no Order without formal consultation with the rest of the Council; which hin∣der'd dispatch, and made his parts the more suspected. He was Son of the Marquis of <HI>Carpio,</HI> who had Married the Sister of <HI>Olivarez,</HI> and had been put about the Person of the King, being about the same Age with his Majesty, and had so grown up in his Affection, and was not thought to have been displeased at the disgrace of his Uncle, but rather to have contributed to it, though he did not succeed in the place of Fa∣vourite in many years, nor seem'd to be concern'd in any business till <MILESTONE N="20"/> after the death of the then Queen, and was rather drawn into it by the violence of the King's Affection, who had a great kindness for his Per∣son, than by the Ambition of his own Nature, or any delight in busi∣ness. His Education had not fitted him for it, and his natural parts were not sharp, yet his Industry was great, and the more commendable, because his Nature had some repugnancy to it, and his Experience had so fitted him for it, that he never spoke impertinently, but discoursed reasonably and weightily upon all Subjects. He was of a Melancholick complection; which, it may be, was the reason that he did not trust himself to himself, which was his defect. He seem'd to be a very honest, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and well natur'd Man, and did very rarely manifest his power in Acts of oppression, or hard-heartedness; which made him grateful to most particular Men, when he was hated enough by the generality. His port and grandeur was very much inferior to that of either of the <HI>French</HI> Cardinals, the last of which was favourite during His Admi∣nistration. Nor did he affect Wealth as They did, not leaving a For∣tune behind him much improv'd by his own Industry: yet it cannot be denied, that the Affairs of <HI>Spain</HI> declined more, in the time they were under His Government, than at any time before; and that less was done with the consumption of so much Money, than might have been expected. <MILESTONE N="40"/> But it must be likewise consider'd, that he enter'd upon that Administra∣tion in a very unhappy conjuncture, after the loss of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the defection in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> which made such a rent in that Crown, as would have required more than an ordinary States-man to have repaired, and make it flourish as before.</P>
<P>THE Embassadours had not been long at <HI>Madrid,</HI> when the <HI>Conde</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the</HI> Conde <HI>of</HI> Pignoran∣da</NOTE> of <HI>Pignoranda</HI> return'd thither from his Negotiation in the Treaty of <HI>Munster.</HI> He had been declared to be of the Council of State, after he had made that Peace with <HI>Holland,</HI> and was admitted to it assoon as he return'd. He was <HI>Conde</HI> in the right of his Wife only; and before <MILESTONE N="50"/> being of a good Family, <HI>Don Diego de Brachamonte,</HI> and bred in the study of the Law, was looked upon as a good Man of business, and so imployed in matters of greatest Trust. He was indeed a Man of great
<PB N="261" REF="2790"/>
parts, and understood the Affairs of the world better than most in that Court. He was proud to the height of his Nation, and retain'd too much of the Pedantry which he had brought with him from <HI>Salamanca.</HI> Assoon as he return'd, according to the method of that Court upon great and successful Employments, the Presidentship <HI>de los Ordines,</HI> an Office of great reputation, becoming void, it was the very next day conferr'd upon him. The Embassadours found no benefit by his Arrival, coming from <HI>Brussels,</HI> which was throughly infected by <HI>Don Alonzo.</HI> The truth is, <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> who had no Affection for the King, upon the memory of some disobligations when he first came over into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> and liked well his imployment, and residence there, used all the endeavours imaginable to have the King's condition thought to be irre∣coverable and desperate, and that therefore all civilities extended to∣wards him were cast away, and would yield no fruit, and that the Com∣mon-wealth was so established, that it could never be shaken. So that <HI>Spain</HI> thought only how to make a firm friendship there, and to forget that there ever Had been a King of <HI>England,</HI> in the confidence that there would be no more. And therefore when the Embassadours, after all Ce∣remonies were over, had a private Audience of the King, and desired, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Embassa∣dours private Audience and Demands.</NOTE> <Q>“that he would appoint Commissioners, with whom they might treat <MILESTONE N="20"/> about the renewing the Alliance between the two Crowns, which had been provided for by the last Treaty to be renew'd within so many Months after the death of either King, and with whom they might likewise confer upon such relief in Armes, and Money, as his Catho∣lick” Majesty would think proper to send to their Master into <HI>Ireland</HI></Q> (whither one of the Embassadours desired to hasten his Journey assoon as might be; and in that Memorial, which they then deliver'd to his Ca∣tholick Majesty, they had desired likewise <Q>“that he would write to” <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> to dispose him to submit to the King)</Q> they receiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Answer they rc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s.</NOTE> shortly after an Answer, sent to them by <HI>Don Francisco de Melo,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="30"/> told them, <Q>“that the King had sent him to them, to confer with them upon the substance of their last Memorial. He said, the King did not think it necessary to appoint any Committee to renew the last Treaty of Peace; which was still in force, and might well be observ'd between the two Nations; and that the renewing might be deferr'd till the” times should mend;</Q> implying very little less than that when the King should be in <HI>England,</HI> it would be a fit time to renew the Alliance. He said, <Q>“he was ready to receive any Propositions from them, wherein they might more particularly set down their desires, if they were ready” to depart;</Q> and for writing to <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> (whom he called <HI>Don Eu∣genio)</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <Q>“he had so misbehaved himself towards his Catholick Majesty, by leaving his Service in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and transporting himself into <HI>Ire∣land</HI> without his Licence, that his Majesty could not in honour write to him; but that he would take such care, that he should know it would be agreeable to his Majesty's good liking, that he betook him∣self to the Service of the King of great <HI>Britain</HI> without reserve; which” he did believe would dispose him to it: which Method the Embassa∣dours conceiv'd was proposed,</Q> because they should believe that the <HI>Spa∣niard</HI> had no hand in sending him into that Kingdom, or in fomenting the Rebellion there; whereas at the same time <HI>Don Diego de la Torre</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/> was with the <HI>Irish</HI> as Resident or Envoy from <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Answer was evidence enough to them, how little they were to expect from any avow'd friendship of that Crown, though they still
<PB N="262" REF="2800"/>
thought they might be able to obtain some little favour in private, as Armes, and Ammunition, and a small supply of Money for the King's Subsistence, that could hardly be taken notice of. And therefore the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was design'd by the King to attend him in <HI>Ireland,</HI> expected only to hear that he was arriv'd there, till when he could not present his Memorial so particularly as was demand∣ed, nor prepare himself for his Voyage thither: and so they rested for some time, without giving the Court any farther trouble by Audiences.</P>
<P>Now whilst they were in this impatient Expectation to hear from the King their Master, who yet remain'd at <HI>Jersey,</HI> by which they <MILESTONE N="10"/> might take their own resolutions, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> came upon the coast <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>comes upon the coast of</HI> Spain.</NOTE> of <HI>Spain</HI> with the Fleet under his Command; which he had brought from <HI>Ireland;</HI> and had sent a Letter on Shore to be sent to the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer; which the Officer upon the place, sent pre∣sently to <HI>Don Lewis de Haro;</HI> who, in the same moment, sent it to him with a very civil salutation. <Q>The Prince writ him word, “that he had brought away all the Fleet from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that he had receiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Letter to the Chancellor of the Exche∣quer.</NOTE> an Assurance from <HI>Portugal,</HI> that he should be very welcome thither; upon which he was resolv'd, after he had attended some days to meet with any <HI>English</HI> Ships that might be prize, to go for <HI>Lisbon;</HI> and de∣sired <MILESTONE N="20"/> him to procure Orders from the Court, that he might find a good reception in all the Ports of <HI>Spain,</HI> if his occasions brought him thi∣ther.”</Q> The Embassadours sent immediately for an Audience to <HI>Don Lewis;</HI> who receiv'd them with open Armes, and another kind of Coun∣tenance than he had ever done before. A Fleet of the King of <HI>England,</HI> under the Command of a Prince of the Blood, upon the coast of <HI>Spain,</HI> at a Season of the year when they expected the return of their Galeons from the Indies, made a great consternation amongst the People, and the Court receiv'd the News of it with disorder enough. All that the Embassadours asked, was granted without haesitation; and Letters were <MILESTONE N="30"/> dispatched away that very night (Copies whereof were sent to the Em∣bassadours) by several Expresses, to all the Governours of the Ports, and other Officers, for the good reception of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> or any Ships under his Command, if they came into any of the Ports; and for the furnishing them with any Provisions they should stand in need of, with as many friendly Clauses as could have been inserted if the King had been in possession of his whole Empire: so great an influence a lit∣tle appearance of Power had upon their Spirits; and the Embassadours found they liv'd in another kind of Air than they had done, and receiv'd every day visits and caresses from the Court, and from those in Au∣thority. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>BUT the Government of these benign Stars was very short: Within few days after, they receiv'd news, <Q>“that the Prince, with the gross of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince with the gross of his Fleet goes into the River of</HI> Lis∣bon.</NOTE> his Fleet, was gone into the River of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and that a Squadron of four or five Ships, under the Command of Captain <HI>Allen,</HI> being sever'd from the Prince by a Storm, was driven upon the Rocks at <HI>Cartagena;</HI> where the People of the Country had treated them very rudely, and seised both upon the Ships, and Persons of the Men, and the Storm continuing had wrecked two or three of their Vessels in the road,” though the Guns and all things in the Ships were saved.</Q> When the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Embassadours demanded Justice, <Q>“and that restitution might be made of all those goods, and Ordnance, and rigging of the Ships, which not only the People, but the Governours, and Officers themselves had”
<PB N="263" REF="2810"/>
seised upon, they were receiv'd with much more cloudy looks than before;</Q> nor was there the same Expedition in granting what they could not deny. Orders were at last given for the setting all the Men at li∣berty, and redelivery of the goods, that thereby they might be enabled to mend their Vessels, and transport their Men.</P>
<P>BUT as these Orders were but faintly given, so they were more slowly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The chief Com∣mander of the Parliament's Fleet comes o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the</HI> Spanish <HI>Coast.</HI></NOTE> executed; and a stronger Fleet set out by the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> then appear'd upon the Coast, which came into the road of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Andero's;</HI> from whence the Commander in chief writ a very insolent Letter in <HI>English</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> <Q>wherein he requir'd, “that none of those Ships <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Letter to the King of</HI> Spain.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"/> under the Command of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> which had revolted from the Parliament, and were in Rebellion against it, might be receiv'd into any of the Ports of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that those Ships which were in the Ports of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> might be deliver'd to him, and the Ordnance and tackling of the other which were wreck'd, might be carefully kept, and be deliver'd to such Person as should be authoriz'd to receive the” same by the Common-wealth of <HI>England;</HI></Q> to whom they belong'd: and concluded, <Q>“that as the Common-wealth of <HI>England</HI> was willing to live in Amity, and good Intelligence with his Catholick Majesty, so they knew very well how to do themselves right for any injury,” <MILESTONE N="20"/> or discourtesy, which they should sustain.</Q></P>
<P>THIS imperious style made such an impression upon the Court, that all the importunity the Embassadours could use, could get nothing done at <HI>Cartagena</HI> in pursuance of the Orders they had sent from the Court; but the poor Men were, after long attendance, forced to transport themselves as they were able; and two or three hundred of them march'd over land, and were compell'd to list themselves in the <HI>Spanish</HI> service at land; where they, for the most part, perish'd; care being in the mean time taken, that the Parliament Fleet should be receiv'd in all places, with all possible demonstration of respect and kindness; and the King <MILESTONE N="30"/> sent a Ring of the value of fifteen hundred pounds to the Commander. In this Triumph he sail'd from thence into <HI>Portugal,</HI> and dropped his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He sails into the River of</HI> Lisbon.</NOTE> Anchors in the River of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> at a very small distance from the Fleet of Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> and suffer'd not any Ship to enter into that River; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Requires Prince</HI> Ru∣pert<HI>'s Fleet to be delt∣ver'd up.</HI></NOTE> but denounced War against that Kingdom, if that Fleet were not pre∣sently deliver'd up into his hands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugueze</HI> had receiv'd Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> very civilly, bought all the Prizes he had brought thither, gave him the free use of all their Ports, and surnish'd him with all things he stood in need of. The Queen, and the Prince of <HI>Portugal</HI> then living, who was a young Man of great <MILESTONE N="40"/> hope and courage, made great professions of Friendship to our King, and of a desire to assist him by all the ways and means which could be proposed to them. But when their river was block'd up, their Ships taken, and the whole Kingdom upon the matter besieged by the Parlia∣ment Fleet, of which they knew the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would quickly make use, the Council was astonish'd, and knew not what to do: their free trade with <HI>England</HI> was not only their profit, but their reputation; and, if they should be depriv'd of that, they should not be able to preserve it any where else; which would put the whole Kingdom into a slame; and therefore they besought their King, that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> might be <MILESTONE N="50"/> desir'd to leave the river, and to carry his Fleet from thence; which was not possible for him to do without fighting with the Enemy, to whom he was much inferior in strength of Shipping, and number of Men, by the loss he had sustain'd at <HI>Cartagena.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="2820"/>
THE Prince of <HI>Portugal</HI> had so great indignation at this overture made by the Council, that he declar'd <Q>“he would have all the Ships in the Port made ready, and would himself go on board, and joyn with” Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI></Q> and fight the <HI>English,</HI> and drive them from thence: and he manifested a great desire to do so; but the Council prevaild with the Queen not to consent to that. So in the end, after some Months stay there, and the Fleet being fully supplied with whatever it stood in need of, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> found it necessary, upon the assurance the <HI>Por∣tugueze</HI> gave him that the other Fleet should not follow him till after two tides, to set sail and leave that Kingdom; which he did with so full <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>escapes out of the River of</HI> Lisbon <HI>with his Fleet.</HI></NOTE> a gale, that the Parliament's Commander, after so long a stay, found it to no purpose to follow him; but took full vengeance upon <HI>Portugal</HI> for rescuing his Prey from him; until they were compell'd, after great sufferings, to purchase their peace from <HI>Cromwell</HI> upon very hard con∣ditions.</P>
<P>IT seem'd no good sign to the Embassadours, that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had left <HI>Ireland;</HI> where there were so many good Ports, and where the Fleet <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The affairs of</HI> Ireland <HI>at this time.</HI></NOTE> had been so necessary for the carrying on his Majesty's service. But, in a short time after, they receiv'd advertisement, <Q>“that the King had laid” aside his purpose of going thither, and had taken new resolutions.</Q> Be∣fore <MILESTONE N="$$"/> the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> could draw his Army together, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had besieged <HI>Tredagh:</HI> and though the Garrison was so strong in point of number, and that number of so choice Men, that they could wish for nothing more than that the Enemy would attempt to take them by storm, the very next day after he came before the Town he gave a general Assault, and was beaten off with considerable loss. But, after a day more, he assaulted it again in two places, with so much courage, that he enter'd in both; and though the Governour and some of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tredagh <HI>ta∣ken by storm.</HI></NOTE> chief Officers retir'd in disorder into a Fort, where they hoped to have mad conditions, a panick fear so possess'd the Soldiers, that they threw <MILESTONE N="30"/> down their Arms upon a general offer of Quarter; so that the Enemy enter'd the works without resistance, and put every Man, Governour, Officer, and Soldier, to the Sword; and the whole Army being enter'd the Town, they executed all manner of cruelty, and put every Man that related to the Garrison, and all the Citizens who were <HI>Irish,</HI> Man, Woman, and Child, to the Sword; and there being three or four Offi∣cers of Name, and of good families, who had found some way, by the humanity of some Soldiers of the Enemy, to conceal themselves for four or five days, being afterwards discover'd they were butcher'd in cold blood. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THIS insupportable loss took away all hopes from the Marquis of <HI>Or∣mond</HI> of drawing an Army strong enough, and resolute enough, toge∣ther, to meet <HI>Cromwell</HI> in the field, during the Summer, which was drawing to an end; and obliged him to retire into those Quarters, where, in respect of the strong Passes, he might be secure, and from whence he might attempt upon the Enemy. <HI>Cromwell</HI> in the mean time took no rest, but having made himself terrible by that excess of rigour and cruelty, march'd into <HI>Munster</HI> against the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> and that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>marches into</HI> Munster</NOTE> Body of <HI>English</HI> which was under His Command. Here he defied For∣tune again; and march'd so far out of the places devoted to him, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> from whence he had any reasonable hope to receive supplies, that he must necessarily have been starv'd, and could not have retir'd, all the Bridges over which he had pass'd being broken down, if the City of
<PB N="265" REF="2830"/>
<HI>Cork,</HI> which he could not have forced, had not been by the Garrison <NOTE PLACE="marg">His success there.</NOTE> basely deliver'd up to him; those Officers who had been most obliged to the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> and in whom he had most confidence, unwor∣thily betraying him, and every day forsaking him: so that by the Exam∣ple of <HI>Cork,</HI> and by the terrour of <HI>Tredagh,</HI> the whole Province of <HI>Munster,</HI> in a very short time fell into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s hands, except some few Towns and Sea-Ports, which, being Garrison'd by the <HI>Irish,</HI> would, neither Officers nor Soldiers, receive or obey any Orders which were sent from the Lord of <HI>Ormond.</HI> The King receiving information of this at <HI>Jersey,</HI> gave over the thought very reasonably of adventuring <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King gives over the thought of go∣ing into</HI> Ire∣land.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"/> himself into <HI>Ireland;</HI> and dismiss'd the two Ships, which, by the dire∣ction of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> had attended so long at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Maloe</HI>'s, to have wafted him thither.</P>
<P>THOUGH Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and the other <HI>Scotish</HI> Lords, who remain'd in <HI>Holland</HI> when the King came into <HI>France,</HI> durst not return into their own Country, yet they held Intelli∣gence with their Party there. And though the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> had the sole power, yet he could not extinguish the impatient desire of that whole Nation, to have their King come to them. And every day pro∣duced instances enough, which inform'd him, how the affections of the <MILESTONE N="20"/> People were generally disposed, and upon how slippery ground himself stood, if he were not supported by the King; and that the Government, he was then possess'd of, could not be lasting, except he had another force to defend him, than that of his own Nation. And he durst not receive any from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who would willingly have assisted him, for fear of being entirely deserted by all his Friends, who had been still firm to him. Hereupon he thought of drawing the King into <HI>Scotland,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle <HI>designs designs to in∣vite the King into</HI> Scotland:</NOTE> and keeping the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Faction from entring with him, by the sentence that was already against them, and to oblige the King to sub∣mit to the Covenant, and all those other obligations which were at <MILESTONE N="30"/> that time establish'd; and if his Majesty would put himself into his hands upon those conditions, he should be sure to keep the power in himself under the King's name, and might reasonably hope that <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> who made no pretence to <HI>Scotland,</HI> might be well enough pleased that his Majesty might remain there under His Government, and As∣surance, that he should not give <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> any disturbance.</P>
<P>UPON this presumption, he wish'd the Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Provides, that a Message be sent to his Ma∣jesty to</HI> Jersey <HI>upon the old Conditions.</HI></NOTE> Committee of the Parliament in whom the Authority was vested, to send again to the King (who, they thought, by this time, might be weary of <HI>Jersey)</HI> to invite him to come to them upon the old condi∣tions; <MILESTONE N="40"/> and by gratifying them in this particular, which all the People did so passionately desire, he renew'd all the solemn obligations they had been before bound in, never to admit the King to come amongst them, but upon his first submitting to, and performing all those condi∣tions. All things being thus setled, and agreed, they sent a Gentleman with Letters into <HI>Jersey,</HI> to invite his Majesty again to come into his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> not without a rude insinuation that it was the last invitation he should receive. The <HI>Scotish</HI> Lords, who are men∣tion'd before to be then in <HI>Holland,</HI> were glad of this advance; and be∣liev'd that if the King were there, they should easily find the way home <MILESTONE N="50"/> again. And therefore they prevail'd with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to write very earnestly to the King, and to recommend it to the Queen; and themselves made great instance to the Queen, with whom they had much credit, <Q>“”that the King would not lose this opportunity to im∣prove
<PB N="266" REF="2840"/>
his condition.</Q> No body presum'd to advise him to submit to All that was propos'd; and yet it was evident, that if he did not submit to All, he could have the benefit of none; but <Q>“that he should make such an Answer as might engage the <HI>Scots</HI> in a Treaty, for the King's better information, and satisfaction in some particulars; which being done,” he should imply a purpose to transport his Person thither.</Q></P>
<P>THE Spring was now coming on, and though <HI>Jersey</HI> was a conve∣nient place to retire to, in order to consider what was next to be done, yet it was not a place to reside in, nor would be longer safe, than whilst the Parliament had so much else to do, that it could not spare where∣withal to reduce it. The design for <HI>Ireland</HI> was at an end, and the de∣spair of being welcome in any other place, compell'd the King to think better of <HI>Scotland:</HI> and so, according to the advice he had receiv'd, he return'd an Answer to the Message from <HI>Scotland,</HI> <Q>“that there were <NOTE PLACE="marg"><Q><HI>The King's an∣swer, “that he would have a Trea∣ty with them” in</HI> Holland.</Q></NOTE> many particulars contain'd in the Propositions which he did not un∣derstand, and which it was necessary for him to be advised in; and in order thereunto, and that he might be well inform'd and instructed in what so nearly concern'd him, he resolv'd, by such a time, which was set down, to find himself in <HI>Holland;</HI> where he desir'd to meet such Persons as his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> would send to him, and to <MILESTONE N="$$"/> confer, and treat, and agree with those upon all things that might give his Subjects of that Kingdom satisfaction; which his Majesty did” very much desire to do.</Q></P>
<P>THE Queen had so good an opinion of many of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Lords, and so ill a one of many of the <HI>English</HI> who were about the King (in truth, she had so entire a despair of all other ways) that she was very desirous that the overtures from <HI>Scotland</HI> should be hearken'd to, and embraced: besides that she found her Authority was not so great with the King, as she expected, she saw no possibility of their being long to∣gether: She knew well that the Court of <HI>France,</HI> that grew every day <MILESTONE N="30"/> into a closer correspondence with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> would not endure that the King should make his Residence in any part of that Kingdom, and so shorten'd the Assignations which they had made for her own support, that she was at no ease, and begun to think of dissolving her own Fa∣mily, and of her own retiring into a Monastery; which from that time she practised by degrees: and, no doubt, that consideration which made most impression upon the King, as it had done upon his Father, and ter∣rified him most from complying with the <HI>Scot</HI>'s demands, which was the alteration it would make in Religion, and the Government of the Church, seem'd not to Her of moment enough to reject the other con∣veniencies; <MILESTONE N="$$"/> nor did she prefer the order, and decency of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> before the sordidness of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but thought it the best expedient to advance her own Religion, that the latter should triumph over the former. She therefore writ earnestly to the King her Son, <Q>“that he would entertain this motion from <HI>Scotland,</HI> as his only <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen ad∣vises the King to agree with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Scots <HI>upon their Terms.</HI></NOTE> refuge; and that he would invite Commissioners to meet him in <HI>Hol∣land,”</HI> in such a place as the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> should advise;</Q> and de∣sir'd that, <Q>“in his passage thither, he would appoint some place where her Majesty would meet him; that they might spend some days toge∣ther” in consultation upon what might concern them joyntly.</Q> In all <MILESTONE N="50"/> which his Majesty complying, the City of <HI>Beauvais</HI> in <HI>Picardy</HI> was ap∣pointed for the interview; where both their Majesties met, and con∣versed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their Maje∣sties meet at</HI> Beauvais.</NOTE> together three or fourdays; and then the Queen return'd to <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> and the King pass'd through <HI>Flanders</HI> to <HI>Breda;</HI> which the Prince <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes to</HI> Breda.</NOTE>
<PB N="267" REF="2850"/>
of <HI>Orange</HI> thought to be the fittest place for the Treaty, the States having no mind that the King should come any more to the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners came to <HI>Breda</HI> with the very same Pro∣positions <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Scotish Commissioners come to</HI> Breda; <HI>and the terms they bring.</HI></NOTE> which had been formerly sent, and without the least mitiga∣tion, and as positive an exception to Persons: so that if the King should incline to go thither, he must go without any one Chaplain of his own: there were Ministers sent from <HI>Scotland</HI> to attend, and to instruct him. His Majesty must not carry with him any one Counsellor, nor any Per∣son who had ever serv'd his Father in the War against the Parliament, without taking the Covenant. And, that no body might have cause to <MILESTONE N="10"/> complain, if they did go thither, that they were worse treated than they had reason to expect, the King himself, and all who should attend upon him, were first to sign the Covenant before they should be admitted to en∣ter into the Kingdom. Very fair warning indeed: nor could any Man justly except against any thing that was afterwards done to him.</P>
<P>HERE was no great Argument for consultation: no Man had so ill an understanding, as not to discern the violence that was offer'd to ho∣nour, justice, and conscience; yet whoever objected against what was proposed, upon any of those considerations, was looked upon as a Party, because he himself could not be suffer'd to attend the King. It was <MILESTONE N="20"/> thought to be of great Weight, that they who disswaded the King from going into <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon those rude and barbarous terms, could not propose any thing else for him to do, nor any place where he might se∣curely repose himself, with any hope of subsistence: a very sad State for a Prince to be reduced to, and which made it manifest enough, that the Kings of the Earth are not such a Body as is sensible of the Indignity, and Outrage, that is offer'd to any Member of it. The <HI>Scotish Hamil∣tonian</HI> Lords were thought to be the most competent Counsellors, since They, by going, were to be exposed to great rigour, and to undergo the severest part of all Censures. They could not sit in the Parliament, <MILESTONE N="30"/> nor in the Council, and knew well that they should not be suffer'd to be about the Person of the King: yet all these resolv'd to wait upon him, and perswaded him to believe, <Q>“that his Majesty's presence would dissi∣pate those Clouds; and that a little time would produce many altera∣tions,” which could not be presently effected.</Q> For his Majesty's signing the Covenant, <Q>“he should tell the Commissioners, that he would defer it till he came thither, that he might think better of it; and that if then the Kirk should press it upon him, he would give them satis∣faction.”</Q> And they were confident, <Q>“that after he should be there, he should be no more importuned in it, but that even the Church-men” <MILESTONE N="40"/> themselves, would contend to make themselves gracious to him.</Q></P>
<P>THIS kind of Argumentation wrought much with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> but more with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had waited upon the King from the time of his Adventure with the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> (against whose Person there was no exception) and with <HI>Wilmot,</HI> and <HI>Wentworth</HI> (who resolv'd to go with his Majesty, and would submit to any conditions, which would be required of them) and with others about the King, who could not digest the Covenant; yet the hope that it would not be required from them, and the many promises those <HI>Scotish</HI> Lords made to them, who were like to grow into Authority again <MILESTONE N="$0"/> when they should be once in their native Air and upon their own Soyl, prevailed with them to use all their credit with the King to embark himself, and try how propitious fortune would be to him in <HI>Scotland.</HI> In the end, a saint hope in that, and a strong despair of any other ex∣pedient,
<PB N="268" REF="2860"/>
prevailed so far with his Majesty, that he resolv'd, upon what <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King resolves for</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> terms soever, to embark himself, in <HI>Holland,</HI> upon a Fleet which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> provided for him; and so with all the <HI>Scotish,</HI> and very few <HI>English</HI> Servants, to set Sail for <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were two very strong Arguments, which made deep impres∣sion <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arguments of some Lords against the King's going to</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> on those Lords who very vehemently disswaded, and ever protested against his Majesty's going for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which, as it often falls out in matters of the highest importance, they could not make use of to convert others, especially in the place and company in which they were to urge them. <Q>The first, “that the Expedition of Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> the <MILESTONE N="10"/> year before, with an Army as numerous, and much better furnish'd, and provided, than <HI>Scotland</HI> could in many years be again enabled to send out, made it manifest enough, how little that Nation, how united” soever, could prevail against the force of <HI>England:</HI></Q> the other, <Q>“that the whole, and absolute power of <HI>Scotland</HI> being, at that time, con∣fessedly vested in the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> it might reasonably be fear'd, and expected, that the King should no sooner arrive there, and the least appearance be discover'd of such resolutions, or alterations in the Affections of the People, upon which the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Faction wholely and solely depended, but <HI>Argyle</HI> would immediately deliver up the <MILESTONE N="20"/> Person of the King into the hands of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and with the Assistance He would willingly give, make that Kingdom tributary or subservient to him, whilst the King remain'd his Prisoner, and <HI>Argyle</HI> continued” his Vice-gerent in <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> No doubt these objections had too much weight in them not to be thought worthy of Apprehension, by many Men, who were not blinded with passion, or amazed with despair: and though they were not able to give any other Counsel, what Course the King might steer with reasonable hope and security, they might yet warrantably disswade his exposing himself to so many visible dangers as that Voyage was subject to both at Sea and Land; and might prudently <MILESTONE N="30"/> believe, that the enjoying the empty title of King, in what obscurity soever, in any part of the world, was to be preferr'd before the empty name of King in any of his own Dominions; which was the best, that could reasonably be expected from the conditions which were imposed upon him; to which he was compelled to submit.</P>
<P>DURING this time, when the Embassadours who were in <HI>Spain,</HI> ex∣pected <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The two Em∣bassadours in</HI> Spam <HI>had Or∣der from the King to stay where they were.</HI></NOTE> every day to hear of his Majesty's being arriv'd in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had thereupon importuned that Court for a dispatch, the King gave them notice of this his resolution, and directed them <Q>“to remain where” they were, till he could better judge of his own Fortune.</Q> They were <MILESTONE N="40"/> extremely troubled, both of them having allways had a strong aversion that the King should ever venture himself in the hands of that Party of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Nation, which had treated his Father so perfidiously. And they were now necessitated to stay there, where they had receiv'd so lit∣tle Encouragement, and had no reason to expect more. They therefore resolv'd to set the best face they could upon it, and desired an Audience from the King: in which they told his Catholick Majesty, <Q>“that they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They acquaint the King of</HI> Spain <HI>with their Master's resolution for</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> had receiv'd Letters from the King their Master; who commanded them to inform his Majesty, who, he knew well, would be glad to hear of any good fortune that befel him, that it had now pleased God <MILESTONE N="50"/> to work so far upon the hearts and affections of his Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they had given over all those Factions and Animosities, which had heretofore divided them, and made them rather Instruments of mischiefs, than benefit to his blessed Father, and to himself: that they
<PB N="269" REF="2870"/>
were now sensible of all those Miscarriages, and had sent unanimously to intreat his Majesty to come into that Kingdom, and to take them all into his Protection; with which his Majesty was so well satisfied, that he had laid aside the thought of transporting himself into <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> which he had intended to do; and was gone into <HI>Scotland;</HI> where the Kingdom was entirely at his devotion, and from whence he could visit <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> as he found it most convenient: and that he had reason to believe, that his friends in either of the Kingdoms, would quickly appear in Armes, when they were sure to be so power∣fully” assisted, and seconded.</Q> And they said, <Q>“they would, from time” <MILESTONE N="10"/> to time, inform his Majesty of the good success that should fall out.</Q> The King professed <Q>“to be very glad of this good News; and that they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King of</HI> Spain<HI>'s An∣swer to them.</HI></NOTE> should assure the King their Master, that he would be allways ready to make all the demonstration of a Brotherly Affection that the ill con∣dition of his own Affairs would permit, and that, if it pleased God to give a Peace to the two Crowns, the world should see how forward he would be to revenge the wrong, and indignity the King of great <HI>Bri∣tain”</HI> had undergone.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH the Embassadours themselves were afflicted with the News of his Majesty's being gone for <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the too much knowledge <MILESTONE N="20"/> they had of the treachery of that Faction there, yet they found his Ma∣jesty was much the more esteem'd in this Court by it. He was before looked upon as being dispossessed, and disinherited of all his Dominions, as if he had no more Subjects than those few who were banish'd with him, and that there was an entire defection in all the rest. But now that he was possessed of one whole Kingdom, in which no Man appear'd in Armes against him, a Kingdom which had been famous for many war∣like Actions, and which allways bred a very warlike People, which had borne good parts in all the Wars of <HI>Europe</HI> in this Age, and had been celebrated in them, was a happy advance, and administred reasonable <MILESTONE N="30"/> hope that he might be established in the other two Kingdoms, in one of which he was thought to have a good, and was known to have a nu∣merous Army on Foot at that very time: so that the Embassadours were much better look'd upon than they had been; and when they made any complaints of injuries done to any of the <HI>English</HI> Merchants who liv'd in the Ports of <HI>Spain,</HI> as they had sometimes occasion to do, upon Taxes and Impositions laid upon them, contrary to the Treaties which had been made, and which they said were still in force, they were heard with respect; the Merchants were reliev'd; and many favours were done to particular Persons upon their desires and interposition: so that <MILESTONE N="40"/> they were not so much out of Countenance as they had been, and all Men spoke with more freedom and detestation against the Rebellion in <HI>England,</HI> and the barbarity thereof, than they had used to do.</P>
<P>THERE fell out at this time, and before the King left <HI>Holland,</HI> an accident of such a prodigious nature, that, if Providence had not, for the reproach of <HI>Scotland,</HI> determin'd that the King should once more make experiment of the courage and fidelity of that Nation, could not but have diverted his Majesty from that Northern Expedition; which, how unsecure soever it appear'd to be for the King, was predestinated for a greater chastisement and mortification of that People, as it shortly <MILESTONE N="50"/> after prov'd to be. When the King had left <HI>Holland,</HI> the Summer be∣fore, and intended only to make <HI>France</HI> his way to <HI>Ireland,</HI> he had given his Commission to the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose,</HI> to gather such a force together, as by the help of the Northern Princes he might be
<PB N="270" REF="2880"/>
enabled to do. Upon which the Marquis, who was naturally full of great thoughts, and confident of Success, sent several Officers who had serv'd in <HI>Germany,</HI> and promised very much, to draw such Troops to∣gether as they should be enabled to do, and himself, with a great train of Officers and Servants, went for <HI>Hamburg;</HI> which he appointed for <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Mountrose <HI>goes for</HI> Ham∣burg <HI>to solli∣cite for Forces.</HI></NOTE> the Rendezvous for all these Troops, and from whence he could in the mean time visit such Courts of the Neighbour Princes and States, as he should be encouraged to do; and keep such Intelligence with his Friends in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as should provide for his reception.</P>
<P>BESIDES the hopes and encouragement he had receiv'd from the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Embassadour <HI>Wolfelte,</HI> to expect good Supplies in <HI>Denmark,</HI> there were many Officers of good name and account in <HI>Sweden,</HI> of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Na∣tion, who were grown rich, and liv'd in plenty in that Kingdom. With the principal of Them, the Marquis had held correspondence; who un∣dertook, as well for others as for themselves, <Q>“that if the Marquis en∣gaged himself in the King's Service in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> they” would give him notable Assistance in Money, Armes, and Men.</Q> In a word, he sent, or went in Person, to both those Kingdoms; where he found the performance very disproportionable to their promises. Queen <HI>Christina</HI> had receiv'd an Agent from <HI>England</HI> with wonderful civility <MILESTONE N="20"/> and grace, and express'd a great esteem of the Person of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> as a Man of glorious Atchievements; and before she resign'd the Crown, which she in few years after did, she engaged it in a fast Alliance with the new Common-wealth, and disposed her Successour to look upon it as a necessary Support to his Crown. In <HI>Denmark,</HI> the Marquis found good Wishes enough, a hearty detestation of all the Villanies which had been acted in <HI>England,</HI> and as hearty wishes for the advancement and prosperity of the King's Affairs; but the Kingdom it self was very poor, and full of discontent, the King not so much esteem'd, because not so much fear'd as his Father had been, and he had been compelled to make <MILESTONE N="30"/> many unreasonable Concessions to <HI>Holland,</HI> that he might have As∣sistance from them, to protect him from those assaults and invasions which were threaten'd from <HI>Sweden.</HI> So that the Marquis was obliged to return to <HI>Hamburg,</HI> with very small Supplies, from either or both those King∣doms: and there he receiv'd no better account from those Officers who had been sent into <HI>Germany.</HI> His design had allways been to Land in the High-lands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> before the Winter Season should be over, both for the safety of his imbarkation, and that he might have time to draw those People together, who, he knew, would be willing to repair to him, before it should be known at <HI>Edenborough</HI> that he was landed in the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Kingdom. He had, by frequent Messages, kept a constant correspondence with those principal heads of the Clans who were most powerful in the High-lands, and were of known, or unsuspected Affection to the King, and advertised them of all his motions and designs. And by them ac∣quainted those of the Low-lands of all his resolutions; who had pro∣mised, upon the first notice of his arrival, to resort with all their Friends and Followers to him.</P>
<P>WHETHER these Men did really believe, that their own strength would be sufficient to subdue their Enemies, who were grown generally odious, or thought the bringing over Troops of Foreigners would lessen <MILESTONE N="50"/> the numbers, and affections of the Natives, they did write very earnestly to the Marquis, <Q>“to hasten his coming over with Officers, Armes, and” Ammunition;</Q> for which he should find hands enough; and gave him notice, <Q>“that the Committee of Estates at <HI>Edenborough</HI> had sent
<PB N="271" REF="2890"/>
again to the King to come over to them; and that the People were so impatient for his presence, that <HI>Argyle</HI> was compell'd to consent to the” Invitation.</Q> It is very probable that this made the greatest impression upon him. He knew very well how few Persons there were about the King, who were like to continue firm in those principles, which could only confirm his Majesty in his former resolutions against the perswa∣sions, and importunities of many others, who knew how to represent to him the desperateness of his condition any other way, than by re∣pairing into <HI>Scotland</HI> upon any conditions. <HI>Mountrose</HI> knew, that of the two Factions there, which were not like to be reconciled, each of <MILESTONE N="10"/> them were equally his implacable Enemies; so that which soever pre∣vail'd, He should be still in the same State, the whole Kirk, of what temper soever, being alike malicious to Him; and hearing likewise of the successive misfortunes in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he concluded, the King would not trust himself there. Therefore upon the whole, and concluding that all his hopes from <HI>Germany</HI> and those Northern Princes would not en∣crease the strength he had already, he caused, in the depth of the Win∣ter, those Soldiers he had drawn together, which did not amount to above five hundred, to be imbark'd, and sent Officers with them, who knew the Country, with directions that they should land in such a place <MILESTONE N="20"/> in the High-lands, and remain there, as they might well do, till he came to them, or sent them Orders. And then in another Vessel mann'd by People well known to him, and commanded by a Captain very faith∣ful to the King, and who was well acquainted with that Coast, he em∣bark'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountrose <HI>embarks for</HI> Scotland; <HI>lands there in</HI> March 1649.</NOTE> himself, and near one hundred Officers, and landed in another Creek, not far from the other place, whither his Soldiers were directed. And both the one and the other party were set safely on shore in the places they design'd; from whence the Marquis himself with some Ser∣vants, and Officers, repair'd presently to the House of a Gentleman of Quality, with whom he had corresponded, who expected him; by whom <MILESTONE N="30"/> he was well receiv'd, and thought himself to be in security till he might put his Affairs in some method: and therefore order'd his other small Troops to contain themselves in those uncouth Quarters, in which they were, and where he thought they were not like to be disturb'd by the visitation of any Enemy.</P>
<P>AFTER he had stay'd there a short time, it being in <HI>March</HI> about the end of the year 1649, he quickly possess'd himself of an old Castle; which, in respect of the situation in a Country so impossible for any Army to march in, he thought strong enough for his purpose: thither he convey'd the Arms, Ammunition, and Troops, which he had brought <MILESTONE N="40"/> with him. And then he publish'd his Declaration, <Q>“that he came with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Publishes his Declaration</NOTE> the King's Commission, to assist those his good Subjects, and to pre∣serve them from oppression: that he did not intend to give any in∣terruption to the Treaty that he heard was enter'd into with his Ma∣jesty; but, on the contrary, hoped that his being in the head of an Army, how small soever, that was faithful to the King, might ad∣vance the same. However, he had given sufficient proof in his former Actions, that if any Agreement were made with the King, upon the first Order from his Majesty, he should lay down his Arms, and dispose” himself according to his Majesty's good pleasure.</Q> These Declarations <MILESTONE N="50"/> he sent to his Friends to be scatter'd by them, and dispersed amongst the People, as they could be able. He writ likewise to those of the Nobility, and the heads of the several Clans, <Q>“to draw such sorces to∣gether,” as they thought necessary to joyn with him;</Q> and he receiv'd
<PB N="272" REF="2900"/>
Answers from many of them, by which they desir'd him <Q>“to advance more” into the Land</Q> (for he was yet in the remotest parts of <HI>Cathness)</HI> and assur'd him, <Q>“”that they would meet him with good Numbers;</Q> and they did pre∣pare so to do, some really; and others, with a purpose to betray him.</P>
<P>IN this state stood the Affair in the end of the year 1649: but be∣cause the unfortunate Tragedy of that noble Person succeeded so soon after, without the intervention of any notable circumstances to inter∣rupt it, we will rather continue the relation of it in this place, than de∣fer <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The continua∣tion of</HI> Moun∣trose<HI>'s Affairs, after the end of the year</HI> 49, <HI>to his death.</HI></NOTE> it to be resum'd in the proper season; which quickly ensued, in the beginning of the next year. The Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> was vigilant enough, <MILESTONE N="10"/> to observe the motion of an Enemy that was so formidable to him; and had present information of his Arrival in the High-lands, and of the small Forces which he had brought with him. The Parliament was then sitting at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> their Messenger being return'd to them from <HI>Jersey</HI> with an account, <Q>“that the King would treat with their Commis∣sioners” at <HI>Breda;</HI></Q> for whom they were preparing their Instructions.</P>
<P>THE Alarm of <HI>Mountrose</HI>'s being landed startled them all, and gave them no leisure to think of any thing else than of sending Forces to hinder the recourse of others to joyn with him. They immediately sent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colonel</HI> Stra∣ghan <HI>sent a∣gainst him and his small Forces.</HI></NOTE> Colonel <HI>Straghan</HI> a diligent and active Officer, with a choice party of <MILESTONE N="20"/> the best Horse they had, to make all possible hast towards him, and to prevent the Insurrections, which they fear'd would be in several parts of the High-lands. And, within few days after, <HI>David Lesley</HI> follow'd with a stronger party of Horse and Foot. The encouragement the Mar∣quis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> receiv'd from his Friends, and the unpleasantness of the Quarters in which he was, prevail'd with him to march, with these few Troops, more into the Land. And the High-landers flocking to him from all quarters, though ill arm'd, and worse disciplin'd, made him undervalue any Enemy who, he thought, was yet like to encoun∣ter him. <HI>Straghan</HI> made such hast, that the Earl of <HI>Southerland,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="30"/> at least pretended to have gather'd together a Body of fifteen hundred Men to meet <HI>Mountrose,</HI> chose rather to joyn with <HI>Straghan:</HI> others did the like, who had made the same promises, or stay'd at home to ex∣pect the event of the first Encounter. The Marquis was without any Body of Horse to discover the motion of an Enemy, but depended upon all necessary Intelligence from the affection of the People; which he be∣liev'd to be the same it was when he left them. But they were much degenerated; the Tyranny of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and his having caused very many to be barbarously murther'd, without any form of law or justice, who had been in Arms with <HI>Mountrose,</HI> notwithstanding all Acts of pardon, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and indemnity, had so broken their hearts, that they were ready to do all Offices that might gratify and oblige him. So that <HI>Straghan</HI> was within a small distance of him, before he heard of his approach; and those High-landers, who had seem'd to come with much zeal to him, whether terrified, or corrupted, left him on a suddain, or threw down their Arms; so that he had none left, but a Company of good Officers, and five or six hundred Foreigners, <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> who had been acquainted with their Officers. With these, he betook himself to a place of some advantage by the inequality of the ground, and the bushes and small shrubs which fill'd it: and there they made a defence for some <MILESTONE N="50"/> time with notable Courage.</P>
<P>BUT the Enemy being so much superiour in number, the Common Soldiers, being all Foreigners, after about a hundred of them were kill'd upon the Place, threw down their Arms; and the Marquis, seeing all
<PB N="273" REF="2910"/>
lost, threw away his Ribban and <HI>George</HI> (for he was Knight of the Gar∣ter) <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By whom</HI> Mountrose <HI>is routed.</HI></NOTE> and found means to change his Cloaths with a fellow of the Country, and so after having gone on foot two or three miles, he got into a House of a Gentleman, where he remain'd conceal'd about two days: most of the other Officers were shortly after taken Prisoners, all the Country desiring to merit from <HI>Argyle</HI> by betraying all those into his hands which they believ'd to be his Enemies. And thus, whether by the owner of the House, or any other way, the Marquis himself became their Prisoner. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Mountrose <HI>taken Prisoner.</HI></NOTE> The Strangers who were taken, were set at Liberty, and transported themselves into their own countries; and the Castle, in which there was <MILESTONE N="10"/> a little Garrison, presently render'd it self; so that there was no more fear of an Enemy in those parts.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Mountrose,</HI> and the rest of the Prisoners, were the next day, or soon after, deliver'd to <HI>David Lesley;</HI> who was come up with his Forces, and had now nothing left to do but to carry them in Triumph to <HI>Edenborough;</HI> whither Notice was quickly sent of their great Victory; which was receiv'd there with wonderful joy, and accla∣mation. <HI>David Lesley</HI> treated the Marquis with great insolence, and for some days carried him in the same cloaths, and habit, in which he was taken; but at last permitted him to buy better. His behaviour was, in <MILESTONE N="20"/> the whole time, such as became a great Man; his countenance serene and chearful, as one that was superior to all those reproaches, which they had prepar'd the People to pour out upon him in all the places through which he was to pass.</P>
<P>WHEN he came to one of the Gates of <HI>Edenborough,</HI> he was met by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Brought to</HI> Edenborough.</NOTE> some of the Magistrates, to whom he was deliver'd, and by them pre∣sently put into a new Cart purposely made, in which there was a high Chair, or Bench, upon which he sate, that the People might have a full view of him, being bound with a Cord drawn over his breast and shoul∣ders, and fasten'd through holes made in the Cart. When he was in <MILESTONE N="30"/> this posture, the Hangman took off his hat, and rode himself before the Cart in his Livery, and with his Bonnet on; the other Officers, who were taken Prisoners with him, walking two and two before the Cart; the Streets, and Windows being full of People to behold the Triumph over a Person whose Name had made them tremble some few years be∣fore, and into whose hands the Magistrates of that place had, upon their Knees, deliver'd the Keys of that City. In this manner he was car∣ried to the Common Goal, where he was receiv'd and treated as a Com∣mon Malefactor. Within two days after, he was brought before the <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is brought before the Par∣liament.</NOTE> Parliament, where the Earl of <HI>Lowden,</HI> the Chancellor, made a very <MILESTONE N="40"/> bitter and virulent Declamation against him: told him, <Q>“he had broken all the Covenants by which that whole Nation stood obliged; and had impiously rebell'd against God, the King, and the Kingdom; that he had committed many horrible Murthers, Treasons, and Impieties, for all” which he was now brought to suffer condign punishment;</Q> with all those insolent reproaches upon his Person, and his actions, which the li∣berty of that place gave him leave to use.</P>
<P>PERMISSION was then given to him to speak; and without the least <NOTE PLACE="marg">His behaviour there.</NOTE> trouble in his countenance, or disorder, upon all the indignities he had suffer'd, he told them, <Q>“since the King had own'd them so far as to treat <MILESTONE N="50"/> with them, he had appear'd before them with reverence, and bare∣headed, which otherwise he would not willingly have done: that he had done nothing of which he was asham'd, or had cause to repent; that the first Covenant, he had taken, and comply'd with it, and with

them who took it, as long as the ends for which it was ordain'd were ob∣serv'd; but when he discover'd, which was now evident to all the world, that private and particular Men design'd to satisfy their own ambition and interest, instead of considering the Publick benefit; and that, under the pretence of reforming some errors in Religion, they resolv'd to abridge, and take away the King's just power, and lawful authority, he had withdrawn himself from that Engagement: that for the League and Covenant, he had never taken it, and therefore could not break it: and it was now too apparent to the whole Christian World, what mon∣strous mischiefs it had produced: that when, under colour of it, an Ar∣my <MILESTONE N="10"/> from <HI>Scotland</HI> had invaded <HI>England</HI> in Assistance of the Rebellion that was then against their Lawful King, he had, by his Majesty's Com∣mand, receiv'd a Commission from him to raise Forces in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that he might thereby divert them from the other odious prosecution: that he had executed that Commission with the obedience and duty he ow'd to the King; and, in all the circumstances of it, had proceeded like a Gentleman; and had never suffer'd any Blood to be shed but in the heat of the Battle; and that he saw many Persons there, whose lives he had saved: that when the King commanded him, he laid down his Armes, and withdrew out of the Kingdom; which they could not have com∣pell'd” <MILESTONE N="20"/> him to have done.</Q> He said, <Q>“he was now again enter'd into the Kingdom by his Majesty's Command, and with his Authority: and what Success soever it might have pleased God to have given him, he would” allways have obeyed any commands he should have receiv'd from him.</Q> He advised them, <Q>“to consider well of the consequence before they pro∣ceeded against him, and that all his Actions might be examin'd, and” judg'd by the Laws of the Land, or those of Nations.</Q></P>
<P>ASSOON as he had ended his discourse, he was order'd to withdraw; and, after a short space, was again brought in; and told by the Chancellor, <Q>“that he was, on the morrow, being the one and twentieth of <HI>May</HI> 1650, <MILESTONE N="30"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sentence against him.</NOTE> to be carried to <HI>Edenborough</HI> Cross, and there to be hanged upon a Gal∣lows thirty foot high, for the space of three hours, and then to be taken down, and his head to be cut off upon a Scaffold, and hanged on <HI>Eden∣borough</HI> Tolbooth; his legs and armes to be hanged up in other publick Towns of the Kingdom, and his body to be buried at the place where he was to be executed, except the Kirk should take off his Excommuni∣cation; and then his body might be buried in the common place of bu∣rial.”</Q> <Q>He desired, “”that he might say somewhat to them;</Q> but was not suffer'd, and so was carried back to the Prison.</P>
<P>THAT he might not enjoy any ease or quiet during the short remainder <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Discourse with the Pres∣byterian Mi∣nisters.</NOTE> of his life, their Ministers came presently to insult over him with all the reproaches imaginable; pronounced his damnation; <Q>and assured him, “that the judgement he was the next day to suffer, was but an easy Pro∣logue” to that which he was to undergo afterwards.</Q> After many such barbarities, they offer'd to intercede for him to the Kirk upon his repen∣tance, and to pray with him; but he too well understood the form of Their Common Prayer, in those Cases, to be only the most virulent, and insolent imprecations upon the Persons of those they prayed against
<Q>“(Lord, vouchsafe Yet to touch the obdurate heart of this proud incor∣rigible Sinner, this wicked, perjured, traiterous, and prophane Person,” <MILESTONE N="50"/> who refuses to hearken to the voice of thy Kirk, and the like charitable expressions)</Q> and therefore he desired them <Q>“to spare their pains, and to” leave him to his own Devotions.</Q> <Q>He told them, “that they were a mi∣serable, deluded, and deluding People; and would shortly bring that
<PB N="275" REF="2930"/>
poor Nation under the most insupportable Servitude, ever People had” submitted to.</Q> <Q>He told them, “he was prouder to have his head set upon the place it was appointed to be, than he could have been to have had his picture hang in the King's Bed-Chamber: that he was so far from being troubled that his four Limbs were to be hang'd in four Cities of the Kingdom, that he heartily wish'd that he had flesh enough to be sent to every City in <HI>Christendom,</HI> as a testimony of the Cause” for which he suffer'd.</Q></P>
<P>THE next day, they executed every part and circumstance of that <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Execution</NOTE> barbarous Sentence, with all the inhumanity imaginable; and he bore <MILESTONE N="10"/> it with all the courage and magnanimity, and the greatest piety, that a good Christian could manifest. He magnified the virtue, courage, and Religion of the last King, exceedingly commended the justice, and good∣ness, and understanding of the present King; and prayed, <Q>“that they” might not betray Him, as they had done his Father.</Q> When he had ended all he meant to say, and was expecting to expire, they had yet one Scene more to Act of their Tyranny. The Hangman brought the book that had been publish'd of his truly Heroick Actions, whilst he had com∣manded in that Kingdom, which Book was tied in a small Cord that was put about his Neck. The Marquis smiled at this new instance of their <MILESTONE N="20"/> Malice, and thanked them for it; and said, <Q>“he was pleased that it should be there; and was prouder of wearing it than ever he had been of the” Garter;</Q> and so renewing some devout ejaculations, he patiently en∣dured the last Act of the Executioner.</P>
<P>SOON after, the Officers who had been taken with him, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Execution of his Officers.</NOTE> <HI>Hurry,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Francis Hay,</HI> and many others, of as good Families as any in the Kingdom, were executed, to the number of thirty or forty, in several quarters of the Kingdom; many of them being suffer'd to be beheaded. There was one whom they thought fit to save, one Colonel <HI>Whitford;</HI> who, when he was brought to dye, said <Q>“he knew the reason why he was <MILESTONE N="30"/> put to death; which was only because he had killed <HI>Dorislaus</HI> at the” <HI>Hague;</HI></Q> who was one of those who had joyn'd in the Murther of the last King. One of the Magistrates, who were present to see the Execu∣tion, caused it to be suspended, till he presently inform'd the Council what the Man had said; and they thought fit to avoid the reproach; and so preserv'd the Gentleman; who was not before known to have had a hand in that Action.</P>
<P>THUS died the gallant Marquis of <HI>Mountrose,</HI> after he had given as great a testimony of Loyalty, and Courage, as a Subject can do, and per∣form'd as wonderful Actions in several Battles, upon as great inequality <MILESTONE N="40"/> of Numbers, and as great disadvantages in respect of Armes, and other preparations for War, as have been perform'd in this Age. He was a Gen∣tleman <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> of a very ancient Extraction, many of whose Ancestors had exer∣cised the highest Charges under the King in that Kingdom, and had been allied to the Crown it self. He was of very good parts, which were im∣prov'd by a good Education: he had allways a great emulation, or rather a great contempt of the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> (as he was too apt to contemn those he did not love) who wanted nothing but honesty and courage to be a very extraordinary Man, having all other good Talents in a very great degree. <HI>Mountrose</HI> was in his nature fearless of danger, and never <MILESTONE N="$$"/> declined any Enterprise for the difficulty of going through with it, but exceedingly affected those which seem'd desperate to other Men, and did believe somewhat to be in himself above other Men, which made him live more easily towards those who were, or were willing to be, in∣ferior
<PB N="276" REF="2940"/>
to him (towards whom he exercised wonderful civility, and ge∣nerosity) than with his superiors or equals. He was naturally jealous, and suspected those who did not concur with him in the way, not to mean so well as he. He was not without Vanity, but his Virtues were much su∣perior, and he well deserv'd to have his Memory preserv'd, and celebrated amongst the most illustrious Persons of the Age in which he liv'd.</P>
<P>THE King receiv'd an Account and Information of all these particu∣lars, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re∣serves the News of all this.</NOTE> before he embarked from <HI>Holland,</HI> without any other Apology for the Affront and Indignity to himself, than that they assured him, <Q>“that the proceeding against the late Marquis of <HI>Mountrose</HI> had been for his” <MILESTONE N="10"/> Service.</Q> They who were most displeased with <HI>Argyle</HI> and his Faction, were not sorry for this inhuman, and monstrous prosecution; which at the same time must render him the more odious, and had rid them of an Enemy that they thought would have been more dangerous to them; and they perswaded the King, who was enough afflicted with the News, and all the circumstances of it, <Q>“that he might sooner take revenge upon that People by a temporary complying with them, and going to them, than staying away, and absenting himself, which would invest them in an absolute Dominion in that Kingdom, and give them power to cor∣rupt or destroy all those who yet remain'd faithful to him, and were” <MILESTONE N="20"/> ready to spend their lives in his Service: and so his Majesty pursued his former resolution of embarking for <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN <HI>Ireland,</HI> after the Massacre of that Body of <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Tredagh,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> and the treacherous giving up the Towns in <HI>Munster,</HI> by the Officers of the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> there broke out so implacable a jealousy amongst the <HI>Irish</HI> against all the <HI>English,</HI> that no Orders of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> found any obedience, nor could he draw an Army together. At the making of the Peace, he had consented that the Confederate Roman Ca∣tholicks should name a Number of the Commissioners, by whose Orders and Ministry all Levies of Men, and all Collections of Money were to be <MILESTONE N="30"/> made, according to the directions of the Lord Lieutenant. And such Per∣sons were named, in whose Affections, for the most part, the Lieutenant was well satisfied, and the rest were such as were not like to be able to give any interruption. A certain Number of these were appointed to be allways in the Army, and near the Person of the Lord Lieutenant, and the rest in their several Stations, where they were most like to advance the Service. Many of these Commissioners were of the Roman Catholick Nobility, Persons of honour, and very sensible of the weakness, wilful∣ness, and wickedness of that Rebellion; and did manifest all possible zeal and affection to the King's Service, engaging their Persons in all Enter∣prises <MILESTONE N="40"/> of danger, and using all possible industry to raise Men and Money, whereby the Lord Lieutenant might be enabled to carry on the War in the Spring. But many of the other, after those misfortunes had fallen out, which are mention'd before, either totally desponded, and rather thought of providing for themselves than for the preservation of the Publick; or somented the jealousies which were amongst the <HI>Irish,</HI> and incensed them against the <HI>English,</HI> who were still with the Lord Lieute∣nant; so that his Orders were not obeyed at all, or not in time, which was as bad; and their Clergy and Fryars publickly incensed the People against the Articles of the Peace, and desired to have an Army raised <MILESTONE N="50"/> apart under a General of their own.</P>
<P>THE Lord Lieutenant now discover'd the Reason, why <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> had refused to consent to the Peace which the Confederate Roman Ca∣tholicks had made with the King, and kept his Army in <HI>Ulster</HI> from
<PB N="277" REF="2950"/>
submitting thereunto, and pretended to desire to treat apart with the Lord Lieutenant for himself; which was then thought to proceed from the jealousy that was between Him and <HI>Preston,</HI> and the animosity be∣tween those old <HI>Irish</HI> of <HI>Ulster,</HI> and the other of the other Provinces. But the truth was, from the time of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s transport∣ing himself out of <HI>France,</HI> and that the correspondence was discover'd to be between Him and the Lord <HI>Inchiquin,</HI> and the Treaty begun with the Confederate Catholicks, the close Committee at <HI>Westminster</HI> sent secret Instructions to <HI>Monk,</HI> who Commanded part of their Forces in <HI>Ireland,</HI> <Q>“that he should endeavour to treat with <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> and so” <MILESTONE N="10"/> divide him from the rest of the <HI>Irish;</HI></Q> which <HI>Monk</HI> found opportunity to do: and it was no sooner proposed than hearken'd unto by <HI>O Neile;</HI> who presently sent a trusty Messenger with such Propositions to <HI>Monk,</HI> as he desired to have granted to him. <Q>He offer'd, “with his Army, which should allways consist of such a Number of Horse and Foot, and Ar∣tillery, as should be agreed between them, to serve the Parliament;” and not to separate from their Interest;</Q> and proposed, <Q>“that he, and all his Party that should adhere to him, should enjoy the Exercise of their Religion, without any prejudice or disadvantage: that himself might be restored to those Lands which his Ancestors had been pos∣sess'd <MILESTONE N="20"/> of in <HI>Tyrone, London-Derry,</HI> or any other parts of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and that all those, who had or would adhere to him, should be likewise re∣stored” to their Estates;</Q> and that an Act of Oblivion might be granted. <HI>Monk</HI> receiv'd these Propositions; and after he had perused them, he sent him word, <Q>“that there were some particulars, which, he doubted, would shock and offend the Parliament, and therefore desired they” might be alter'd;</Q> and proposed the Alterations he advised; which principally concern'd the publick Exercise of their Religion; which he so qualified, that they might well enough satisfy; and proposed, <Q>“that, if <HI>O Neile</HI> would consent to those Alterations, he would return the Treaty <MILESTONE N="30"/> sign'd by him; which he would immediately send over to the Parlia∣ment for their confirmation; and that, in the mean time, there might be a Cessation of Armes between them for three Months; in which time, and much less, he presumed, he should receive a ratification of” the Treaty from the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>OWEN <HI>O Neile</HI> consented to the Alterations, set his Hand and Seal to the Treaty, and return'd it to <HI>Monk,</HI> with his consent likewise to the Cessation for three Months. And at this time it was, that he refused to agree with the Confederate Council at <HI>Kilkenny</HI> in the Peace with the King. <HI>Monk</HI> sent it presently to the Committee, which had given him <MILESTONE N="40"/> Authority to do what he had done. But their Affairs were now better composed at home, and some preparations were made towards sending relief for <HI>Ireland;</HI> besides, they had not Authority to make any such ratification, but presented it to the Parliament, which could only give it. It was no sooner reported there but the House was on fire; all Men in∣veighed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The House re∣fuses to ratify</HI> Monk's <HI>Trea∣ty with</HI> Owen O Neile.</NOTE> against <Q>“the presumption of <HI>Monk,</HI> who deserv'd to be displaced, and to have his Command taken from him, and to have exemplary punishment inflicted on him. They remember'd how criminal they had declared it to be in the King himself, to have treated, and made a Peace with the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebels: and what would the People think, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> say, if any countenance should be given to the same transgression by the Parliament? if they should ratify a Treaty made by the most no∣torious of the Rebels, and with that People under his Command, who
<PB N="278" REF="2960"/>
were the most notorious Contrivers of that Rebellion, and the most” bloody Executioners of it?</Q> for the most mercyless Massacres had been committed in <HI>Ulster,</HI> by that very People who now constituted that Army of which <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> was now General. After all the passion and choler which they thought necessary to express upon this subject, they declar'd, <Q>“that they had given no Authority to <HI>Monk</HI> to enter into that Treaty; and therefore, that it was void, and should never be con∣firm'd by them; but that, since he had proceeded out of the sincerity of his heart, and as he thought (how erroneously soever) for the good and benefit of the Common-wealth, he should be excused; and no far∣ther” <MILESTONE N="10"/> question'd thereupon.</Q> For they knew well, that he could pro∣duce such a Warrant from those in Authority, as would well justify his proceeding: and so the Treaty with <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> became void, though they had receiv'd a very considerable benefit by it; for though the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Ulster</HI> had not yet submitted to the Peace, and had not receiv'd di∣rections from <HI>Edenborough</HI> to acknowledge the authority of the Lord Lieutenant, which they ought to have had before that time, yet, after the Murther of the late King, they had used all acts of hostility against the Parliament Forces, and had besieged <HI>London-Derry;</HI> the only con∣siderable place that yielded obedience to the Parliament; which was <MILESTONE N="20"/> defended by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Charles Coote,</HI> and when it was brought to some extre∣mity, by the Cessation made with <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> and by his connivance and assistance, <HI>London-Derry</HI> was reliev'd; and <HI>O Neile</HI> finding himself deluded by the Parliament, sent then to offer his service and conjunction to the Lord Lieutenant, with abundant professions of fidelity, and re∣venge.</P>
<P>CROMWELL made notable use of this animosity between the <HI>Irish</HI> amongst themselves, and of the jealousy they all appear'd to have of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> and of those who adhered to him; and used all the Endeavours he could, by some Prisoners who were taken, and by others <MILESTONE N="30"/> who were in the Towns which were betray'd to him, and were well known to have affection for the Marquis, to procure a conference with him. <Q>He used to ask in such Company, “what the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had to do with <HI>Charles Stuart,</HI> and what obligations he had ever re∣ceiv'd” from him?</Q> and then would mention the hard measure his Grand∣father had receiv'd from King <HI>James,</HI> and the many years imprisonment he had sustain'd by him, for not submitting to an extrajudicial and pri∣vate determination of his; which yet he was at last compell'd to do. He said <Q>“he was confident, if the Marquis and He could meet together,” upon conference, they should part very good friends.</Q> And many of <MILESTONE N="40"/> those with whom he held these discourses, by his permission and licence, inform'd the Marquis of all he said; who endeavour'd nothing but to put himself into such a Posture, as to be able to meet him as he desir'd to do.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Cromwell</HI> saw that he should be able to do nothing that way, and knew well enough that, besides the Army that yet remain'd under <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> so much disobliged, and provok'd, there were still vast Bodies of the <HI>Irish,</HI> which might be drawn together into several Armies, much greater and superior in number to all his forces, and that they had several great Towns, and strong holds in their power, he declar'd a full <MILESTONE N="50"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>the</HI> Irish <HI>haue to trans∣port them∣selves vnto any</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> liberty, and authority to all the Officers with the <HI>Irish,</HI> and to all other Persons whatsoever, to raise what Men they would, and to transport them for the service of any foreign Princes with whom they could make
<PB N="279" REF="2970"/>
the best conditions; and gave notice to the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Ministers, and Agents at <HI>London,</HI> of the liberty he had granted. Upon which many Officers who had serv'd the King, and remain'd in <HI>London</HI> in great po∣verty and want, made conditions with <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</HI> to raise Regiments and transport them into <HI>Spain;</HI> and many Officers, who were already in <HI>Spain,</HI> as well <HI>English</HI> as <HI>Irish,</HI> contracted with the Mi∣nisters in that Court to raise and transport several Regiments into that Kingdom from <HI>Ireland;</HI> for which they receiv'd very great sums of Mo∣ney in hand; many Merchants joyning with them in the Contract, and undertaking the transportation upon very good conditions; there being <MILESTONE N="10"/> no other danger but of the Sea in the undertaking; insomuch that, in very few months above a year, there were embark'd in the Ports of <HI>Ire∣land</HI> above five and twenty thousand Men for the Kingdom of <HI>Spain;</HI> whereof not half were ever drawn into the field there, and very few ever liv'd to return. For the Officers and Masters of Ships, who contracted, and were bound to deliver their Men at such Ports as were assign'd to them, and where care was taken for their reception, and conduct to the Quarters which were appointed, according to the service to which they were design'd, either for <HI>Catalonia,</HI> or <HI>Portugal</HI> (after they had been long at Sea, by which the Soldiers, who were crowded more together into <MILESTONE N="20"/> one Ship than was fit for so long voyages, had contracted many diseases, and many were dead, and thrown over board) assoon as they came upon the Coast made all hast to land, how far soever from the place at which they stood bound to deliver their Men; by which, in those places that could make resistance, they were not suffer'd to land, and in others no provision was made for their reception or march, but very great Num∣bers were starv'd or knock'd in the head by the Country People, and few ever came up to the Armies, except Officers; who flock'd to <HI>Ma∣drid</HI> for the remainder of their Monies; where the Ministers receiv'd them with reproaches for not observing their conditions, and refused to <MILESTONE N="30"/> pay either them, or the Masters of the Ships, what remain'd to be paid by them. This was the Case of too many: though the truth is, where the Articles were punctually observ'd, and the Ships arriv'd in the very Ports assign'd, by the defect in the Orders sent from the Court, or the negligent execution of them, the poor Men were often kept from dis∣embarking, till some Officers went to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and return'd with more positive Orders, and afterwards so ill provision was made for their re∣freshing and march, that rarely half of those who were shipp'd in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> ever liv'd to do any service in <HI>Spain:</HI> and nothing could be more wonderful, than that the Ministers there should issue out such vast Sums <MILESTONE N="40"/> in Money for the raising of Soldiers, and bringing them into the King∣dom at very liberal and bountiful rates to the Officers, and take so very little care to cherish, and nourish them, when they came thither; which manifested how loose the Government was.</P>
<P>IT is very true, that there was at that time a much greater inclina∣tion in the <HI>Irish</HI> for the service of <HI>Spain</HI> than of <HI>France;</HI> yet the Cardi∣nal imploy'd more active and dextrous Instruments to make use of the Liberty that was granted, and Shipping was more easily procur'd, the passage being shorter; insomuch that there were not fewer than twenty thousand Men at the same time transported out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into the King∣dom <MILESTONE N="$$"/> of <HI>France;</HI> of whose behaviour in the one Kingdom and the other, there will be abundant Argument hereafter to discourse at large. In the mean time, it is enough to observe that when the King's Lieutenant,
<PB N="280" REF="2980"/>
notwithstanding all the promises, obligations, and contracts, which the Confederate Roman Catholicks had made to, and with him, could not draw together a Body of five thousand Men (by which he might have been able to have given some stop to the current of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s suc∣cesses) <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself found a way to send above forty thousand Men out of that Kingdom for service of foreign Princes; which might have been enough to have driven him from thence, and to have restor'd it to the King's entire obedience.</P>
<P>IN <HI>England,</HI> the Spirits of all the loyal Party were so broken and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The low Con∣dition of the Loyal Party in</HI> England.</NOTE> subdued, that they could scarce breath under the insupportable bur∣thens <MILESTONE N="$$"/> which were laid upon them by imprisonments, compositions, and sequestrations. Whatever Articles they had made in the War, and whatever promises had been made of Pardon and Indemnity, they were now call'd upon to finish their Composition for their delinquency, and paid dear for the credit they had given to the professions and declara∣tions of the Army, when it seem'd to have pity, and complain'd of the severe and rigorous proceeding against the King's Party, and extorting unreasonable penalties from them; which then they desir'd might be moderated. But now the Mask was off they sequester'd all their Estates, and left them nothing to live upon, till they should compound; which <MILESTONE N="$$"/> they were forced to do at so unreasonable rates, that many were com∣pell'd to sell half, that they might enjoy the other towards the support of their families; which remainder was still liable to whatever imposi∣tions they at any time thought fit to inflict upon them, as their Per∣sons were to imprisonment, when any unreasonable and groundless re∣port was raised of some Plot, and Conspiracy against the State.</P>
<P>THE Parliament, which consisted only of those Members who had sate in Judgement, and solemnly murther'd the King, and of those who as solemnly under their hands had approv'd, and commended what the others had done, met with no opposition or contradiction from any, <MILESTONE N="30"/> but an entire submission from all to all they did, except only from that part of their own Army which had contributed most to the Gran∣deur and Empire of which they were possess'd, the Levellers. That <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Levellers mutiny; and are suppress'd by</HI> Fairfax.</NOTE> People had been countenanced by <HI>Cromwell</HI> to enter into Cabals and Confederacies to corrupt, and dissolve the discipline of the Army, and by his Artifices had been apply'd to bring all his crooked designs to pass. By them he broke the strict union between the Parliament and the <HI>Scots,</HI> and then took the King out of the hands of the Parliament, and kept him in the Army, with so many fair professions of intending better to his Majesty, and his Party, than the other did; by them the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Presbyterians had been affronted, and troden under foot, and the City of <HI>London</HI> exposed to disgrace and infamy; by them he had broken the Treaty of the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> driven out of the Parliament, by force of Arms, all those who desir'd peace, and at last executed his barbarous malice upon the sacred Person of the King: and when he had apply'd them to all those uses, for which he thought them to be most fit, he hoped, and endeavour'd to have reduced them again, by a severe hand, into that order and obedience from whence he had seduced them, and which was now as necessary to his future purpose of Government. But they had tasted too much of the pleasure of having their part, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> share in it, to be willing to be stripp'd, and depriv'd of it; and made an unskilfull computation of what they should be able to do for the fu∣ture, by the great things they had done before in those Changes and Re∣volutions
<PB N="281" REF="2990"/>
which are mention'd; not considering, that the superior Of∣ficers of the Army were now united with the Parliament, and concurr'd entirely in the same designs. And therefore when they renew'd their former Expostulations and Demands from the Parliament, they were casheer'd, and imprison'd, and some of them put to death. Yet about the time that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who had prosecuted them with great fury, was going for <HI>Ireland,</HI> they recover'd their courage, and resolv'd to obtain those Concessions by force, which were refused to be granted upon their request: and so they mutiny'd in several Parts, upon presumption that the rest of the Army, who would not joyn with them in publick, would <MILESTONE N="1"/> yet never be prevailed with to oppose, and reduce them by force. But this confidence deceiv'd them; for the Parliament no sooner commanded their General <HI>Fairfax</HI> to suppress them, than he drew Troops together, and fell upon them at <HI>Banbury, Burford,</HI> and in other places; and by killing some upon the place, and executing others to terrify the rest, he totally suppress'd that Faction; and the Orders of those at <HI>West∣minster</HI> met with no more opposition.</P>
<P>THIS was the State and Condition of the three Kingdoms at the end of the year 1649, some few Months after the King embarked himself in <HI>Holland</HI> for <HI>Scotland.</HI> And since the next year afforded great variety <MILESTONE N="10"/> of unfortunate Actions, We will end this discourse, according to the method We have used, with this year: though hereafter We shall not continue the same method; but comprehend the occurrences of many years in less room, whilst the King rested in a patient Expectation of God's Blessing, and Deliverance.</P>

<P><Q><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who did not believe that the King would ever have ventur'd into <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the conditions he had sent, was surprised with the account the Commissioners had given him, “that his Majesty resolv'd to embark the next day; that he would leave all his Chaplains, and his other Servants be∣hind him, and only deferr'd to take the Co∣venant himself till he came thither, with a resolution to satisfy the Kirk if they press'd” <MILESTONE N="10"/> it.</Q> Thereupon he immediately dispatched away another Vessel with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle <HI>sends new Proposi∣tions; which missed the King.</HI></NOTE> new Propositions, which the Commissioners were to insist upon, and not to consent to the King's coming into that Kingdom, without He likewise consented to those. But that Vessel met not with the King's Fleet, which, that it might avoid that of the Parliament, which attended to intercept the King, had held its course more Northward, where there are good Harbours; and so had put into a Harbour near <HI>Sterlin,</HI> that is, within a days Journey of it, but where there was no Town nearer than that for his Majesty's reception, or where there was any accommoda∣tion even for very ordinary Passengers. <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P><Q>FROM thence notice was sent to the Council of the King's arrival <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King ar∣rives in</HI> Scot∣land.</NOTE> the first welcome he receiv'd, was a new demand “that he would sign” the Covenant himself, before he set his foot on shore;</Q> which all about him press'd him to do: and he now found, that he had made hast thi∣ther upon very unskilful imaginations, and presumptions: yet he con∣sented <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King takes the Co∣venant.</NOTE> unto what they so imperiously required, that he might have
<PB N="286" REF="3020"/>
leave to put himself into the hands of those who resolv'd nothing less than to serve him. The Lords of the other Party, who had prevailed with him to submit to all that had been required of him, quickly found that they had deceiv'd both Him and Themselves, and that no body had any authority but those Men who were their mortal Enemies. So that they would not expose themselves to be imprison'd, or to be removed from the King; but, with his Majesty's leave, and having given him the best advice they could, what he should do for Himself, and what he should do for Them, they put themselves on Shore before the King disembark'd; and found means to go to those places where they might be some time concealed, and which were like to be at distance enough <MILESTONE N="10"/> from the King. And shortly after Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> retired to the Island <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hamilton <HI>and</HI> Lautherdale <HI>depart from the King.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Arran,</HI> which belonged to himself; where he had a little House well enough accommodated, the Island being for the most part inhabited with wild Beasts: <HI>Lautherdale</HI> concealed himself amongst his Friends; taking care both to be well inform'd of all that should pass about the King, and to receive their advice upon any occasions.</P>
<P>THE King was receiv'd by the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> with all the out∣ward <NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle <HI>re∣ceives the King. Most of the King's</HI> Eng∣lish <HI>Servants removed from him.</HI></NOTE> respect imaginable; but, within two days after his landing, all the <HI>English</HI> Servants he had of any Quality, were removed from his Person, <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> only excepted. The rest, for the most part, were receiv'd into the Houses of some Persons of Honour, who liv'd at a distance from the Court, and were themselves under a cloud for their known affections, and durst only attend the King to kiss his hand, and then retired to their Houses, that they might give no occasion of jea∣lousy; others of his Servants were not suffer'd to remain in the King∣dom, but were forced presently to reimbark themselves for <HI>Holland;</HI> amongst which was <HI>Daniel O Neile,</HI> who hath been often mention'd be∣fore, and who came from the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> into <HI>Holland,</HI> just when his Majesty was ready to embark, and so waited upon him; and <MILESTONE N="30"/> was no sooner known to be with his Majesty (as he was a Person very <NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel O Neile <HI>apprehended by order of the Council of</HI> Scotland; <HI>and banished.</HI></NOTE> generally known) but he was apprehended by order from the Council, for being an <HI>Irish</HI> man, and having been in Armes on the late King's be∣half in the late War; for which they were not without some discourse of putting him to death; but they did immediately banish him the Kingdom, and obliged him to sign a paper, by which he consented to be put to death, if he were ever after found in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>THEY sent away likewise M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Long,</HI> who was his Principal, if <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Long <HI>also sent away.</HI></NOTE> not only, Secretary of State, and had very much perswaded his going thither; and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Walker,</HI> who was Clerk of the Council, and <MILESTONE N="40"/> had been Secretary at War during the late War, and some others, upon the like exceptions. They placed other Servants of all conditions about <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Clergy allways about the King.</NOTE> the King, but principally relied upon their Clergy; who were in such a continual attendance about him, that he was never free from their importunities, under pretence of instructing him in Religion: and so they obliged him to their constant hours of their long Prayers, and made him observe the <HI>Sundays</HI> with more rigour than the <HI>Jews</HI> accustom'd to do their Sabbath; and reprehended him very sharply if he smiled on those days, and if his looks and gestures did not please them, whilst all their Prayers and Sermons, at which he was compelled to be present, <MILESTONE N="50"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Sermons b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m.</NOTE> were libels, and bitter invectives against all the Actions of his Father, the Idolatry of his Mother, and his own Malignity.</P>
<P>HE was not present in their Councils, nor were the results thereof
<PB N="287" REF="3030"/>
communicated to him; nor was he, in the least degree, communicated with, in any part of the Government: Yet they made great shew of outward reverence to him, and even the Chaplains, when they used rudeness and barbarity in their reprehensions and reproaches, approach'd him still with bended knees, and in the humblest postures. There was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle<HI>'s beha∣viour to him.</HI></NOTE> never a better Courtier than <HI>Argyle;</HI> who used all possible address to make himself gracious to the King, entertain'd him with very pleasant discourses, with such insinuations, that the King did not only very well like his conversation, but often believ'd that he had a mind to please and gratify him: but then, when his Majesty made any attempt to get some <MILESTONE N="10"/> of his Servants about him, or to reconcile the two Factions, that the Kingdom might be united, he gather'd up his countenance, and retir'd from him, without ever yielding to any one proposition that was made to him by his Majesty. In a word, the King's table was well serv'd; there he sate in Majesty, waited upon with decency: he had good Horses to ride abroad to take the air, and was then well attended; and, in all publick appearances, seem'd to want nothing that was due to a great King. In all other respects, with reference to power to oblige or gra∣tify any Man, to dispose or order any thing, or himself to go to any other place than was assign'd to him, he had nothing of a Prince, but <MILESTONE N="20"/> might very well be look'd upon as a Prisoner.</P>
<P>BUT that which was of state and lustre made most noise, and was in∣dustriously transmitted into all Nations and States; the other of disre∣spect or restraint, was not communicated; and if it could not be en∣tirely conceal'd, it was consider'd only as a Faction between particular great Men, who contended to get the power into their hands, that they might the more notoriously and eminently serve that Prince whom they all equally acknowledged. The King's condition seem'd wonder∣fully advanced, and his being possessed of a Kingdom without a Rival, in which there was no appearance of an Enemy, look'd like an earnest <MILESTONE N="30"/> for the recovery of the other Two, and, for the present, as a great addi∣tion of power to him in his Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> by a conjunction, and absolute submission of all the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Ulster</HI> to the Marquis of <HI>Or∣mond,</HI> the King's Lieutenant there.</P>
<P>ALL Men who had disluaded his Majesty's repair into <HI>Scotland,</HI> were look'd upon as very weak Politicians, or as Men who opposed the Publick good, because they were excluded, and might not be suffer'd to act any part in the adventure; and they who had advanced the design, valued themselves exceedingly upon their activity in that service. The States of <HI>Holland</HI> thought they had merited much in suffering their <MILESTONE N="40"/> Ships to transport him, and so being ministerial to his greatness; which they hoped would be remember'd; and they gave all countenance to the <HI>Scotish</HI> Merchants and Factors who liv'd in their Dominions, and some secret credit, that they might send Armes and Ammunition, and whatsoever else was necessary for the King's service into that Kingdom. <HI>France</HI> it self look'd very chearfully upon the change; congratulated the Queen with much ceremony, and many professions; and took pains to have it thought and believ'd, that they had had a share in the Counsel, and contributed very much to the reception the King found in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by their influence upon <HI>Argyle</HI> and his Party. And it hath been men∣tion'd <MILESTONE N="50"/> before, how great a reputation this little dawning of power, how clouded soever, gave to the Embassadours in <HI>Spain,</HI> and had raised them, from such a degree of disrespect, as was near to contempt, to the full
<PB N="288" REF="3040"/>
dignity and estimation in that Court that was due to the Station in which they were.</P>
<P>THERE fell out there an accident at this time, which was a great manifestation of the affection of that Court, and indeed of the Nation. <Q>As <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas</HI> had used all the credit he had, to dispose that Court to a good correspondence with the Parliament, so he had employ'd as much care to encline those in <HI>England</HI> to have a confidence in the affection of his Master, and assur'd them, “that if they would send an Embassadour, or other Minister into <HI>Spain,</HI> he should find a good” reception.</Q> The Parliament, in the infancy of their Common-wealth, had more inclination to make a friendship with <HI>Spain</HI> than with <HI>France,</HI> having at that time a very great prejudice to the Cardinal; and therefore, upon this encouragement from <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> they resolv'd to send an Envoy to <HI>Madrid;</HI> and made choice of one <HI>Ascham,</HI> a Scholar, who <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ascham <HI>sent Agent into</HI> Spain <HI>from the Parliament of</HI> England.</NOTE> had been concern'd in drawing up the King's Tryal, and had written a book to determine in what time, and after how many years, the Alle∣giance which is due from Subjects to their Soveraigns, comes to be de∣termin'd after a Conquest; and that, from that term, it ought to be paid to those who had subdued them: a speculation they thought fit to cherish.</P>
<P>THIS Man, unacquainted with business, and unskill'd in language, <MILESTONE N="$$"/> attended by three others, the one a Renegado <HI>Franciscan</HI> Friar, who had been bred in <HI>Spain,</HI> and was well versed in the language; another, who was to serve in the condition of a Secretary; and the third, an in∣ferior fellow for any service, arriv'd all in <HI>Spain</HI> in an <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chant's Ship: of which <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> gave such timely notice, that he was receiv'd and entertain'd by the chief Magistrate at his landing, un∣till they gave notice of it to the Court. The Town was quickly full of the rumour, that an Embassadour was landed from <HI>England,</HI> and would be receiv'd there; which no body seem'd to be well pleased with. <Q>And <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Embassa∣dours there expostulate with</HI> Don Lewis <HI>about it.</HI></NOTE> the Embassadours expostulated with <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> with some <MILESTONE N="30"/> warmth, “that his Catholick Majesty should be the first Christian Prince that would receive an Embassadour from the odious, and execrable Murtherers of a Christian King, his Brother and Ally; which no other” Prince had yet done, out of the detestation of that horrible Parricide:</Q> <Q>and therefore they desired him, “that <HI>Spain</HI> would not give so infa∣mous” an example to the other parts of the world.</Q> <Q><HI>Don Lewis</HI> assur'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> them, “that there was no such thing as an Embassadour coming from <HI>England,</HI> nor had the King any purpose to receive any: that it was true, they were inform'd that there was an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman landed <MILESTONE N="40"/> at <HI>Cales,</HI> and come to <HI>Sevil;</HI> who said, he was sent from the Parlia∣ment with Letters for the King; which was testified by a Letter from <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Medina Celi;</HI> who thereupon had given Order for his entertainment at <HI>Sevil,</HI> till the King should give further order: That it was not possible for the King to refuse to receive the Letter, or to see the Man who brought it; who pretended no kind of Character: That having an Embassadour residing in <HI>England</HI> to preserve the Trade and Commerce between the two Nations, they did believe that this Messenger might be sent with some Propositions from the <HI>English</HI> Merchants for the advancement of that trade, and if <MILESTONE N="50"/> they should refuse to hear what he said, it might give a just offence, and destroy all the Commerce; which would be a great damage to” both Nations.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="3050"/>
THAT this new Agent might come securely to <HI>Madrid,</HI> an old Offi∣cer of the Army was sent from <HI>Sevil</HI> to accompany him thither; who came with him in the Coach, and gave notice every night to <HI>Don Lewis</HI> of their advance. There were at that time, over and above the <HI>English</HI> Merchants, many Officers and Soldiers in <HI>Madrid,</HI> who had serv'd in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Armies, both in <HI>Catalonia</HI> and in <HI>Portugal;</HI> and these Men had consulted amongst themselves how they might kill this fellow, who came as an Agent from the new Republick of <HI>England;</HI> and half a do∣zen of them, having notice of the day he was to come into the Town, which was generally discoursed of, rode out of the Town to meet him; but, missing him, they return'd again, and found that he had enter'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> into it by another way; and having taken a view of his lodging, they met again the next Morning; and finding, accidentally, one of the Em∣bassadours Servants in the streets, they perswaded him to go with them, and so went to the House where <HI>Aschan</HI> lodged; and, without asking any Questions, walked directly up the stairs into his Chamber, leaving a couple of their number at the door of the street, lest, upon any noise in the house, that door might be shut upon them. They who went up, drew their swords; and besides their intentions, in disorder, kill'd the Fryar as well as the Agent; and so return'd to their Companions with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ascham <HI>kill'd by some Officers at his lodgings in</HI> Madrid.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"/> their swords naked and bloody, and some foolish expressions of triumph, as if they had perform'd a very gallant and a justifiable service. Not∣withstanding all which, they might have dispersed themselves, and been secure, the People were so little concern'd to enquire what they had done. But they being in confusion, and retaining no composed thoughts about them, finding the door of a little Chapel open, went in thither <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>All but one fly to a Chapel for sanctuary; he, to the</HI> Vene∣tian <HI>Embassa∣dours.</HI></NOTE> for sanctuary: Only he who was in service of the Embassadours, sepa∣rated himself from the rest, and went into the house of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Embassadour. By this time the people of the house where the Man lay, had gone up into the chamber; where they found two dead, and the <MILESTONE N="30"/> other two crept, in a terrible fright, under the bed; and the Magistrates and people were about the Church, and talking with, and examining the persons who were there: <Q>and the rumour was presently divulged about the Town, “”that one of the <HI>English</HI> Embassadours was kill'd.</Q></P>
<P>THEY were at that time entring into their Coach to take the air, ac∣cording to an appointment which they had made the day before. When they were inform'd of what had passed, and that <HI>Harry Progers,</HI> who was their Servant, had been in the action, and was retir'd to the House of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Embassadour, they were in trouble and perplexity; dis∣miss'd their Coach; and return'd to their lodging. <Q>Though they ab∣horr'd <MILESTONE N="40"/> the action that was committed, they foresaw, the presence of one of their own Servants in it, and even some passionate words they had used, in their expostulation with <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> against the reception of such a Messenger, as if “the King their Master had too many Sub∣jects” in that place, for such a fellow to appear there with any security, would make it be believ'd by many, that the attempt had not been made without their consent or privity.</Q> In this trouble of mind, they immediately writ a Letter to <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> to express the sense <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Embassa∣dours write to</HI> Don Lewis <HI>a∣bout this action.</HI></NOTE> they had of this unfortunate rash action; <Q>“of which, they hoped, he did believe, if they had had any notice or suspicion, they would have” <MILESTONE N="50"/> prevented it.</Q> <HI>Don Lewis</HI> return'd them a very dry Answer; <Q>“That he could not imagine that they could have a hand in so foul an as∣sassination” <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> in the Court (for all <HI>Madrid</HI> is call'd, and look'd upon as
<PB N="290" REF="3060"/>
the Court)</Q> <Q>“of a person under the immediate protection of the King: however, that it was an action so unheard of, and so dishonourable to the King, that his Majesty was resolv'd to have it examin'd to the bot∣tom, and that exemplary justice should be done upon the Offenders: that his own Embassadour in <HI>England</HI> might be in great danger upon this Murther; and that they would send an Express presently thither, to satisfy the Parliament how much his Catholick Majesty detested, and was offended with it, and resolv'd to do justice upon it; and if his Em∣bassadour underwent any inconvenience There, they were not to won∣der,” if his Majesty were severe Here;</Q> and so left it to Them to imagine <MILESTONE N="10"/> that their own Persons might not be safe.</P>
<P>BUT they knew the temper of the Court too well, to have the least apprehension of that: yet they were a little surprised, when they first saw the multitude of people, gather'd together about their house, upon the first News of the action; insomuch that the street before their house, which was the broadest in <HI>Madrid</HI> (the <HI>Calle de Alcala)</HI> was so throng'd, that Men could hardly pass. But they were quickly out of that appre∣hension, being assured, that the jealousy that one of the <HI>English</HI> Embas∣sadours had suffer'd violence, had brought that multitude together; which they found to be true; for they no sooner shew'd themselves in <MILESTONE N="20"/> a Balcony to the people, but they saluted them with great kindness, pray'd for the King their Master, cursed and reviled the Murtherers of his Father; and so departed. They who had betaken themselves to the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Those that fled to the Chapel are taken thence, and im∣prisoned; the other escapes into</HI> France.</NOTE> Chapel, were, the next day or the second, taken from thence by a prin∣cipal Officer after examination, and sent to the prison: the other was not inquir'd after; but, having conceal'd himself for ten or twelve days, he went out of the Town in the night; and, without any interruption or trouble, went into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Of all the Courts in Christendom <HI>Madrid</HI> is that where Embassa∣dours, and Publick Ministers, receive the greatest respect; which, be∣sides <MILESTONE N="30"/> the honour and punctuality of that People, bred up in the obser∣vation of distances and order, proceeds from the excellent method the Embassadours have of living with mutual respect towards each other, and in mutual concernment for each others honour and privileges: so that, if any Embassadour, in Himself for his Servants, receive any affront or disrespect, all the other Embassadours repair to him; and offer their service, and interposition; by which means they are not only preserv'd from any invasion by any private and particular insolence, but even from some Acts of Power, which the Court it self hath some time thought fit to exercise, upon an extraordinary occasion, towards a Minister of whom they had no regard. All are united on the behalf of the Character; <MILESTONE N="40"/> and will not suffer that to be done towards one, which, by the conse∣quence, may reflect upon all.</P>
<P>IT cannot be imagin'd, with what a general compassion all the Em∣bassadours look'd upon these unhappy Gentlemen, who had involv'd themselves by their rashness in so much peril. They came to the <HI>English</HI> Embassadours to advise, and consult what might be done to preserve them, every one offering his assistance. <Q>The Action could in no degree be justified; all that could be urged and insisted upon in their behalf, was the Privilege of Sanctuary, “They had betaken themselves to the Church; and the taking them from thence, by what Authority soever, was a <MILESTONE N="50"/> violation of the rights and immunities of the Church, which, by the Law of the Kingdom, was ever defended with all tenderness. So that
<PB N="291" REF="3070"/>
before the guilt of the blood could be examin'd, the Prisoners desired that their Privilege might be examin'd, and that they might have” Council assign'd them to that purpose;</Q> which was granted; and se∣veral Arguments were made upon the matter of Law before the Judges; who were favourable enough to the Prisoners. <Q>The King's Council urged, “that, in case of Assassination, the Privilege of Sanctuary was” never allow'd (which is true) and cited many Presidents of late years in <HI>Madrid</HI> it self,</Q> where, for less crimes than of blood, Men had been taken out of the Sanctuary, and tried, and executed. The <HI>English</HI> Em∣bassadours thought not fit to appear on their behalf, and yet were not <MILESTONE N="10"/> willing that the new Republick should receive so much countenance from that Court, as would have resulted from putting those Gentlemen to death as if they had killed a publick Minister. The Pope's Nuntio, <HI>Julio Rospigliosi,</HI> who was afterwards <HI>Clement</HI> the Ninth, could not, ac∣cording <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Nuntio</HI> Rospigliosi <HI>required them to be deliver'd back.</HI></NOTE> to the Style of the Roman Court, either give, or receive visits from the <HI>English</HI> Embassadour: but they perform'd civilities to each other by Messages, and passed mutual Salutations, with all respect to each other, as they met abroad. <Q>And the <HI>Venetian</HI> Embassadour brought them frequent assurances, “that the Nuntio had spoken very effectually to the King, and to <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> for the redelivery of the Prisoners to <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Church, and pressed it so hard upon the Conscience of the King,” that he had some promise that they should not suffer.</Q></P>
<P>IN the mean time, thundering Letters came from the Parliament, with great menaces what they would do, if exemplary justice was not inflicted upon those who had murther'd their Envoy; <Q>and <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> urged it, as if “he thought himself in danger till full satisfaction should be given in that particular; all which for the present made deep im∣pression, so that they knew not what to do; the King often declaring that he would not infringe the privilege of the Church, and so under∣go the censure of the Pope, for any advantage he could receive with” <MILESTONE N="30"/> reference to any of his Dominions.</Q> In the end (that the discourse of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Issue of this business after the Em∣bassadours de∣parture.</NOTE> this Affair may not be resumed again hereafter) after a long imprison∣ment (for during the Embassadours stay they would not bring them to any Trial, lest they might seem to do any thing upon their sollicitation) the Prisoners were proceeded against assoon, or shortly after the Em∣bassadours had left <HI>Madrid,</HI> and were all condemn'd to dye; and assoon as the Sentence was declared, all the Prisoners were again deliver'd into the same Church; where they remain'd many days, having Provisions of Victuals sent to them by many Persons of Quality, until they had all opportunity to make their escape; which was very successfully done <MILESTONE N="40"/> by all but one; who, being the only Protestant amongst them, was more maliciously looked after and watch'd, and was follow'd, and apprehended after he had made three days Journey from <HI>Madrid,</HI> and carried back thither, and put to death: which was all the satisfaction the Parliament could obtain in that Affair; and is an instance, how far that People was from any affection to those of <HI>England</HI> in their hearts, how much so∣ever they complied with them out of the necessity of their fortune.</P>
<P>WHEN some weeks were passed after that unlucky accident, the Embassadours went to confer with <HI>Don Lewis</HI> upon some other occur∣rence, with no purpose of mentioning any thing of the Prisoners. <Q><HI>Don</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>Lewis</HI> spoke of it in a manner they did not expect, one expression was <HI>“Yo tengo invidia de estos Cavaleros &amp;c.</HI> I envy those Gentlemen for having done so noble an action, how penal soever it may prove to”
<PB N="292" REF="3080"/>
them, to revenge the blood of their King.</Q> <Q>Whereas, he said, “the King his Master wanted such resolute Subjects; otherwise he would never have lost a Kingdom, as he had done <HI>Portugal,</HI> for want of one brave Man; who, by taking away the life of the Usurper, might at any time,” during the first two years, have put an end to that Rebellion.</Q></P>
<P>To return now to the Affairs of <HI>Scotland:</HI> whether when the Mar∣quis of <HI>Argyle</HI> first knew that the King would venture himself into <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> he suspected his own strength, and so sent for his Friend <HI>Cromwell</HI> to assist him; or whether it seem'd more reasonable to the Parliament, when it was assured of the King's being there, to visit him in that King∣dom, <MILESTONE N="10"/> than to expect a Visit from him, is not enough clear at this time. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell, <HI>sent for by the Parliament out of</HI> Ireland, <HI>leaves</HI> Ireton <HI>his Deputy.</HI></NOTE> But assoon as the King was in <HI>Scotland, Cromwell,</HI> being sent for by the Parliament, left what remain'd to be done in <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Ireton</HI> (who had married his Daughter) and made him Deputy; and transported himself into <HI>England;</HI> where the Parliament, not without great opposition from all the Presbyterian Party, resolv'd to send an Army into <HI>Scotland.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment resolv'd to send an Ar∣my into</HI> Scot∣land.</NOTE> Many opposed it, as they thought it an unjust and unprofitable War, and knew it must be a very expensive one; and others, because it would keep up, and increase the power and authority of the Army in <HI>England;</HI> which was already found to be very grievous. <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THIS resolution produced another great alteration: <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who had hitherto worne the name of General, declared positively that he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fairfax <HI>gives up his Com∣mission.</HI></NOTE> would not command the Army against <HI>Scotland.</HI> <Q>The Presbyterians said, “it was because he thought the War unlawful, in regard it was against” those of the same Religion;</Q> but his Friends would have it believ'd, that he would not fight against the King. Hereupon <HI>Cromwell</HI> was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>made General.</HI></NOTE> chosen General; which made no alteration in the Army; which he had modell'd to his own mind before, and commanded as absolutely. But in all other places he grew more absolute and more imperious; he dis∣countenanced, and suppressed the Presbyterians in all places; who had <MILESTONE N="30"/> been supported by <HI>Fairfax.</HI> The Independents had all credit about him; and the Churches and Pulpits were open to all kind of People who would shew their gifts there; and a general distraction and confusion in Reli∣gion cover'd the whole Kingdom; which raised as general a discontent in the minds of the People, who, finding no ease from the burthens they had so long sustain'd, but an increase of the Taxes and Impositions every day, grew weary of their new Government; and heartily prayed, that their General might never return from <HI>Scotland,</HI> but that, he being de∣stroyed there, the King might return victorious into <HI>London.</HI> The bit∣terness and persecution against their Brethren in <HI>England,</HI> and the old <MILESTONE N="40"/> animosity they had long borne against the Person of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> made those in Authority in that Kingdom resolve to defend themselves against his Invasion, and to draw together a very numerous body of Men well <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scots <HI>raise an Army a∣gainst him.</HI></NOTE> provided, and supplied with all things necessary but courage and con∣duct. They were so careful in the modelling this Army, that they suf∣fer'd few or no Officers, or Soldiers, who had been in the Engagement of Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> or who gave the least occasion to be suspected to wish well to the King or to the <HI>Hamiltonian</HI> Party, to be listed or re∣ceiv'd into their Service. So that they had only some old discredited Of∣ficers, who, being formerly thought unworthy of Command, had stuck <MILESTONE N="50"/> close to <HI>Argyle</HI> and to the Party of the Kirk. The truth is, the whole Army was under the Government of a Committee of the Kirk and the State; in which the Ministers exercised the sole Authority, and prayed

and preached against the Vices of the Court, and the impiety and ty∣ranny of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> equally; and promised their Army Victory over the Enemy as positively, and in as confident terms, as if God himself had directed them to declare it. The King desired that he might command this Army, at least run the fortune of it. But they were hardly prevail'd with to give him leave once to see it; and, after he had been in it three or four hours, upon the observation that the Common Soldiers seem'd to be much pleased to see him, they caused him to return, and the next day carried him to a place at a greater distance from the Army; <Q>de∣claring, “that they found the Soldiers too much inclined to put their <MILESTONE N="10"/> confidence in the Arme of Flesh; whereas their hope and dependence was to be only in God; and they were most assured of Victory by the” prayers, and piety of the Kirk.</Q></P>
<P>IN <HI>July Cromwell</HI> enter'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> and marched without any oppo∣sition <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>en∣ters</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> till he came within less than a days Journey of <HI>Edenborough;</HI> where he found the <HI>Scots</HI> Army encamped upon a very advantageous ground; and he made his Quarters as near as he could conveniently, and yet with disadvantages enough. For the Country was so destroyed behind him, and the Passes so guarded before, that he was compelled to send for all his Provision for Horse and Foot from <HI>England</HI> by Sea; <MILESTONE N="20"/> insomuch as the Army was reduced to great streights; and the <HI>Scots</HI> really believ'd, that they had them all at their Mercy, except such as would embark on board their Ships. But assoon as <HI>Cromwell</HI> had reco∣ver'd some Provisions, his Army begun to remove, and seem'd to pro∣vide for their March. Whether that March was to retire out of so barren a Country for want of Provisions (which no doubt were very scarce; and the Season of the year would not permit them to depend upon all necessary Supplies by Sea, for it was now the Month of <HI>Septem∣ber)</HI> or whether that motion was only to draw the <HI>Scots</HI> from the ad∣vantageous post of which they were possessed, is not yet understood. <MILESTONE N="30"/> But it was confessed on all sides, that, if the <HI>Scots</HI> had remain'd within their Trenches, and sent Parties of Horse to have follow'd the <HI>English</HI> Army closely, they must have so disorder'd them, that they would have <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The distress of</HI> Cromwell<HI>'s Army.</HI></NOTE> left their Cannon, and all their heavy Carriage behind them, besides the danger the Foot must have been in. But the <HI>Scots</HI> did not intend to part with them so easily; they doubted not but to have the Spoil of the whole Army. And therefore they no sooner discern'd that the <HI>English</HI> were upon their march, but they decamped, and followed with their whole Body all the night following, and found themselves in the morning within a small distance of the Enemy: for <HI>Cromwell</HI> was quick∣ly <MILESTONE N="40"/> advertised that the <HI>Scots</HI> Army was dislodged, and marched after him; and thereupon he made a stand, and put his Men in good order. The <HI>Scots</HI> found they were not upon so clear a chase as they imagin'd, and placed themselves again upon such a side of a Hill, as they believ'd the <HI>English</HI> would not have the Courage to attack them there.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Cromwell</HI> knew them too well to fear them upon any ground, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>en¦tirely routs the</HI> Scots <HI>in the Battle of</HI> Dunba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> when there were no Trenches, or Fortifications to keep him from them; and therefore he made hast to charge them on all sides, upon what ad∣vantage-ground soever they stood. Their Horse did not sustain one Charge; but fled, and were pursued with a great execution. The Foot depended much upon their Ministers, who preached, and prayed, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> assured them of the Victory, till the <HI>English</HI> were upon them; and some of their Preachers were knocked in the head, whilst they were promising
<PB N="294" REF="3100"/>
the Victory. Though there was so little resistance made, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> lost very few Men by that days Service, yet the Execution was very terrible upon the Enemy; the whole Body of the Foot being, upon the matter, cut in pieces: no quarter was given till they were weary of killing; so that there were between five and six thousand dead upon the place; and very few, but they who escaped by the heels of their Horse, were without terrible wounds; of which very many died shortly after; especially such of their Ministers who were not kill'd upon the place, as very many were, had very notable marks about the head, and the face, that any Body might know that they were not hurt by chance, or in <MILESTONE N="10"/> the croud, but by very good will. All the Cannon, Ammunition, Car∣riages, and Baggage, were entirely taken, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> with his victo∣rious Army marched directly to <HI>Edenborough;</HI> where he found plenty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>en∣ters</HI> Eden∣borough.</NOTE> of all things which he wanted, and good accommodation for the refresh∣ing his Army; which stood in need of it.</P>
<P>NEVER Victory was attended with less lamentations: for as <HI>Crom∣well</HI> had great argument of Triumph in the total defeat and destruction of the only Army that was in <HI>Scotland;</HI> which defeat had put a great part of that Kingdom, and the chief City of it, under his obedience; so the King, who was then at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Johnston</HI>'s, was glad of it, as the greatest <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King gets Advantage by this.</NOTE> happiness that could befall him, in the loss of so strong a Body of his Enemies; who, if they should have prevailed, his Majesty did believe that they would have shut him up in a Prison the next day; which had been only a stricter confinement than he suffer'd already: for the Lord <HI>Lorne,</HI> eldest Son to the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> being Captain of his Guard, had so watchful a care of him both night and day, that his Majesty could not go any whither without his leave. But, after this defeat, they all looked upon the King as one they might stand in need of: they per∣mitted his Servants, who had been sequester'd from him from his Ar∣rival in the Kingdom, to attend, and wait upon him, and begun to talk of calling a Parliament, and of a time for the King's Coronation; which <MILESTONE N="30"/> had not hitherto been spoken of. Some Ministers begun to Preach obe∣dience to the King; <Q>the Officers, who had been cashier'd for their Ma∣lignity, talked a loud of “the miscarriages in the Government, and that the Kingdom was betrayed to the Enemy for want of confidence” in the King, who alone could preserve the Nation.</Q> They of the Coun∣cil seem'd not to have so absolute a dependence upon the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> but spoke more freely than they had used to do; and the Mar∣quis applied himself more to the King, and to those about him: so that the King did, in a good degree, enjoy the fruit of this Victory, as well <MILESTONE N="40"/> as <HI>Cromwell,</HI> though his Majesty's advantage was discern'd by a few Men only, and those reduced into an obscure quarter of the Kingdom; but the other made the <HI>éclat.</HI> The destruction of the only Army, and the possessing of <HI>Edenborough,</HI> was looked upon, in all places, as the entire conquest of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P><Q>DON <HI>Alonzo</HI> made hast to send the News into <HI>Spain</HI> of “the total and irrecoverable defeat of the King; that he was driven into the High∣lands; from whence he would be compelled to fly, assoon as he could get means to escape: that the Republick was now settled, and no” more fear or hope of the King:</Q> the effect of all which, the Embassa∣dours <MILESTONE N="50"/> quickly found at <HI>Madrid,</HI> by the carriage and countenance of that King and the Council; though it cannot be denied that the Common People appear'd to have a much more generous sense of the Alteration,
<PB N="295" REF="3110"/>
than the others did. <Q>The Embassadours receiv'd shortly a full advertise∣ment of the truth; and “that the King thought his condition much im∣prov'd” by the defeat;</Q> and they used all the means they could, by se∣veral Audiences, to inform the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Don Lewis</HI> of the truth; <Q>and “that they were misinform'd, as if the Army overthrown was the King's; whereas they were indeed as much his Enemies, as” <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s was.</Q> But in this they could obtain no credit, and all ways were taken to make them perceive, that it was heartily wish'd they were gone; which they were resolv'd to take no notice of.</P>
<P><Q>IN the end, one morning, the Secretary of State came to them from <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Secretary of State brings a Message from the King of</HI> Spain <HI>to the Embassadours to desire them to be gone.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="01"/> the King; and told them, “that they had been now above a year in that Court, where they had been well treated, notwithstanding some miscarriages, which might very justly have incensed his Catholick Ma∣jesty” (mentioning the death of <HI>Ascham)</HI></Q> <Q>“that they were Extraordi∣nary Embassadours, and so needed not any Letters of Revocation; that they had receiv'd Answers to all they had proposed, and were at liberty to depart; which his Catholick Majesty desir'd they would do,” since their presence in the Court would be very prejudicial to his Affairs.</Q> <Q>This unexpected and unusual Message, deliver'd ungracefully enough by an old Man, who, notwithstanding his Office, was look'd upon with <MILESTONE N="20"/> little reverence to his parts, made them believe “that he had mistaken “his Message, at least that he had deliver'd it with less courtly circum∣stances” than he ought to have done.</Q> <Q>And therefore they return'd no other Answer, than “that they would attend <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> and” understand from Him the King's pleasure.</Q> The next day, they sent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They apply to</HI> Don Lewis.</NOTE> for an Audience to <HI>Don Lewis;</HI> whom they found with a less open Countenance than he used to have; nor did he appear any thing more courtly than the Secretary had done; but told them, that there were Orders sent to such a Person (whom he named) to prepare their present; which should be ready within very few days; and press'd them very <MILESTONE N="30"/> plainly, and without any regard to the season of the year, it being then towards the end of <HI>January,</HI> to use all possible expedition for their de∣parture, as a thing that, even in that respect, did exceedingly concern the service of the King. This made the Embassadours imagine, which was likewise reported, that there was a formal Embassadour upon his way from <HI>England,</HI> and that the Court would be no more liable to the like Accidents. But they knew afterwards, that the cause of all this <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The reason of their being prest to depart</HI> Madrid <HI>in such hast</HI></NOTE> hast was, that they might bring into the Town as many Pictures, and other choice and rich furniture, as did load eighteen Mules; which, as was said before, <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> had bought of the King's goods, and <MILESTONE N="40"/> then sent to the <HI>Groyne,</HI> and which they did not then think could be decently brought to the Palace, whilst the Embassadours should continue and remain in the Town.</P>
<P>THIS injunction to leave <HI>Madrid,</HI> in so unseasonable a time of the year, was very severe to the Embassadours. The Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> was at this time seventy six years of Age, once or twice in a year troubled with the Gout, in other respects of great vigour of Body and Mind; nor did there appear in his natural parts any kind of decay. He had re∣solv'd, when he first proposed this Embassy to the King, and, it may be, it was the chief reason of proposing it, that, if there should be no <MILESTONE N="50"/> door open to let him return into <HI>England,</HI> by the time that his Em∣bassy should expire, he would remain and die in <HI>Spain.</HI> But he did then believe, that he should have sound another kind of Entertainment
<PB N="296" REF="3120"/>
there than he had done. He had, without doubt, deserv'd very well from that Nation, having allways perform'd those Offices towards them which made him look'd upon at home as too well affected to that Peo∣ple, which, together with his constant opposition of the <HI>French,</HI> had render'd him very ungracious to the Queen: yet there were some sea∣sons, in which his credit and authority was not great enough to obtain all things for them which they desir'd, and expected; as when their Fleet, under the command of <HI>Oquendo,</HI> about the year 1639, had been assaulted in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and defeated by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, for want of that protection which they thought the King might have given to them. <MILESTONE N="10"/> And it is probable their Embassadours, who were then in <HI>England,</HI> whereof <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> was one, did not find that readiness and alacrity in him to appear in their service, as they had formerly done; he very well knowing, that the being sollicitous for them, in that conjuncture▪ might do Himself harm, and could do Them no good. But these Omis∣sions were now remember'd, and all his services forgotten: so that (as hath been touch'd before) his reception, from the first hour of his coming last thither, was very cold both from the King and the Court. And though he was now willing to resume his former resolution of staying there; yet the treatment he had receiv'd, and this last farewel, made <MILESTONE N="20"/> him doubt, very reasonably, whether he should be permitted to stay there or not.</P>
<P>THERE was another circumstance, which was necessary to his residing in <HI>Spain,</HI> in which he met with some difficulties that he had not fore∣seen, and which did exceedingly perplex him; and which he plainly enough discern'd, and knew to be the true cause of all the discounte∣nance he had met with in that Court (though he was willing the other Embassadour, who knew nothing of it, should believe that it proceeded from what had passed in <HI>England)</HI> which was then remember'd in the discourse of the Court, and was the true cause of the general prejudice <MILESTONE N="30"/> to him there. He had been formerly reconciled in that Kingdom to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and had constantly gone to the Mass there; and declaring himself afterwards in <HI>England</HI> to be of the Religion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he was Apostatiz'd from the other; which, in that Country, is look'd upon as such a Brand, as the infamy of it can never be wiped out; and this indeed was the reason of that King's so notable aversion from him. The truth is, he had never made any enquiry into Religion to inform himself, but had conform'd to that which the Pro∣vince he held obliged him to; and though he could never get the repu∣tation in <HI>England</HI> of being well affected to that Church, and was all∣ways <MILESTONE N="40"/> look'd upon as most inclin'd to the <HI>Roman,</HI> yet he convinced those who would have taken advantage of that guilt, by being present at Prayers, and Sermons, and sometimes receiving the Sacrament, as he did the very last <HI>Sunday</HI> he stay'd in the <HI>Hague</HI> before he begun his journey towards <HI>Spain;</HI> and even after his arrival there, was constant at the reading the Common-prayers both morning, and evening, by their own Chaplain, in their House, as long as the Chaplain liv'd: and many, who knew him very well, did believe that if he had died in <HI>England,</HI> he would have died in the Communion of that Church. But there is no doubt, he did resolve, from the time that he meant to remain and <MILESTONE N="50"/> die in <HI>Spain,</HI> that he would become a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick again, which he thought to be a much easier thing than it was; and that he might have been reconciled by any Priest in as private a manner as he could desire.
<PB N="297" REF="3130"/>
But when he consulted that affair with a Jesuit, who frequently came to the House, he found, that after an Apostacy, as they term'd it, it was not in the power of any Priest to reconcile him, but that it was reserv'd to the Pope himself; who rarely gives the faculty to any but to his own Nuntio's. This obliged him to resort thither; which he could not easily do without communicating it to the other Embassa∣dour; towards whom this was the only secret he reserv'd. And he found a way, as he thought, to elude him in this particular. He told him, several days, that the Nuntio had sent him such, and such Mes∣sages by that Jesuit concerning those Gentlemen who were in Prison, the substance whereof did not differ from what the <HI>Venetian</HI> Embassa∣dour <MILESTONE N="1$"/> had formerly deliver'd from him: <Q>at last, he told him, “that he found the Nuntio had somewhat to say in that Affair which he would not communicate by Message, but wish'd to speak with him in private; for publickly he must not be known to have any conference with him; and that hereupon he resolv'd to go <HI>incognito</HI> in S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Benjamin Wright</HI>'s” Coach to him: which he did, and was then reconciled;</Q> and return'd home making such a relation of their conference to his Companion as he thought fit; and deliver'd the Nuntio's salutation to him. But within two or three days he knew what the Affair was: for, besides that the Nuntio could not perform the Office alone, but was to have the assistance of two or three so qualified, there was really care taken that the other Embassadour might know it. <Q>And, before that time, when they both visited the President <HI>de la Hazienda,</HI> who carried them into his Library, whilst the other Embassadour was casting his Eyes upon some Books (it being the best private Library in <HI>Madrid)</HI> the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> told the President, “that he was himself a Catholick, but that his Companion” was an obstinate Heretick;</Q> of which the President sent him informa∣tion the next day. But since himself forbore ever to communicate this secret to him, out of an opinion, it is very probable, that he might give some disturbance to his resolution, he likewise took no manner of no∣tice of it to him to the minute of their parting.</P>
<P>THIS difficulty being over, there remain'd yet another; which was, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Cot∣tington <HI>re∣solves to stay as a private Man in</HI> Spain</NOTE> his having permission to stay in that Country; <Q>for which he address'd himself to <HI>Don Lewis;</HI> mention'd “his Age; his infirmity of the Gout; which would infallibly seize upon him, if, in that season of the year, he should provoke it by an extraordinary Motion; in a word, that it was impossible for him to make the journey. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> told him, he could answer him to part of what he said without speaking to the King; that he must not think of staying with the Character of an Em∣bassadour, nor of residing in <HI>Madrid,</HI> in how private a condition soe∣ver; if he desired any thing with these two restraints, he would move” the King in it.</Q> <Q>The other told him, “that he submitted to both these conditions; and only desired licence to reside in <HI>Valladolid,</HI> where he had liv'd many years, when the Court remain'd there, in the time of” King <HI>Philip</HI> the third.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS place was not dislik'd; and within few days, <HI>Don Lewis</HI> sent him word “that the King approv'd it; and that he should have a Letter to the chief Magistrate there, to treat him with all respect; and that his Majesty would take care that he should not undergo any distress,” but would supply him as his necessities required.</Q> And, shortly after, a Message was sent to the Embassadours to let them know, that the King had appointed such a day for to give them an Audience to take
<PB N="298" REF="3140"/>
their leave. This new importunity was as extraordinary as the former; however, they perform'd their Ceremonies; and about the beginning <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Emb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssa∣dours have A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dience of have. The Lord</HI> Cot∣tington <HI>lives at</HI> Valladolid <HI>till he dies.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>March,</HI> after they had been in that Court near fifteen Months, they both left <HI>Madrid</HI> in the same hour: the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> taking his Course for <HI>Valladolid;</HI> where he had the same House provided, and made ready for him by the care of the <HI>English</HI> Jesuits there, in which he had dwelt at the time of his Agency, when the Court resided there; where he died within one year after, in the 77<SUP>th</SUP> year of his Age.</P>
<P>HE was a very wise Man, by the great and long experience he had <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> in business of all kinds; and by his natural temper, which was not liable to any transport of Anger, or any other passion, but could bear con∣tradiction, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and even reproach, without being moved, or put out of his way: for he was very steady in pursuing what he proposed to himself, and had a courage not to be frighted with any opposition. It is true he was illiterate as to the Grammar of any Language, or the principles of any Science, but by his perfectly understanding the <HI>Spanish</HI> (which he spoke as a <HI>Spaniard)</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Languages, and having read very much in all, he could not be said to be ignorant in any part of Learning, Divinity only excepted. He had a very fine and extraor∣dinary understanding in the Nature of Beasts and Birds, and above all <MILESTONE N="20"/> in all kind of Plantations and Arts of Husbandry. He was born a Gen∣tleman both by Father and Mother, his Father having a pretty entire Seat near <HI>Bruton</HI> in <HI>Somerset-shire,</HI> worth above two hundred pounds a year, which had descended from Father to Son for many hundred years, and is still in the possession of his Elder Brother's Children, the Family having been allways Roman Catholick. His Mother was a <HI>Stafford,</HI> nearly allied to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Stafford;</HI> who was Vice-Chamberlain to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and had been Embassadour in <HI>France;</HI> by whom this Gentleman was brought up, and was Gentleman of his Horse, and left one of his Executors of his will, and by him recommended to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Cecil,</HI> then Principal Secretary of State; who preferr'd him to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Charles</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Conwallis,</HI> when he went Embassadour into <HI>Spain,</HI> in the beginning of the reign of King <HI>James;</HI> where he remain'd, for the space of eleven or twelve years, in the condition of Secretary or Agent, without ever returning into <HI>England</HI> in all that time. He raised by his own Virtue and Industry a very fair Estate, of which, though the Revenue did not exceed above four thousand pounds by the year; yet he had four very good Houses, and three Parks, the value whereof was not reckon'd into that computation. He liv'd very nobly, well serv'd, and attended in his House; had a better Stable of Horses, better provision for Sports (espe∣cially <MILESTONE N="40"/> of Hawks, in which he took great delight) than most of his Qua∣lity, and liv'd allways with great splendour; for though he lov'd Money very well, and did not warily enough consider the circumstances of getting it, he spent it well all ways but in giving, which he did not affect. He was of an excellent humour, and very easy to live with; and, under a grave countenance, cover'd the most of mirth, and caused more, than any Man of the most pleasant disposition. He never used any Body ill, but used many very well for whom he had no regard: his greatest fault was, that he could dissemble, and make Men believe that he lov'd them very well, when he cared not for them. He had not very tender Af∣fections, <MILESTONE N="50"/> nor Bowels apt to yearn at all objects which deserv'd com∣passion. He was heartily weary of the world, and no Man was more willing to die; which is an Argument that he had peace of Conscience.
<PB N="299" REF="3150"/>
He left behind him a greater esteem of his Parts, than love to his Person.</P>
<P>THE other Embassadour was dismissed with much more courtesy <NOTE PLACE="marg">The other Em∣bassadour dis∣miss'd very courteously.</NOTE> for when they heard that his Family remain'd at <HI>Antwerp</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and that he intended to go thither, and stay there till he receiv'd other Orders from the King his Master, they gave him all dispatches thither which might be of use to him in those parts. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> him∣self used many gracious Expressions to him at his last Audience, and sent afterwards to him a Letter for the Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold;</HI> in which he expressed the good opinion he had of the Embassadour; <Q>and com∣manded <MILESTONE N="10"/> “that, whilst he should choose to reside in those parts, under his Government, he should receive all respect, and enjoy all Privileges” as an Embassadour:</Q> <Q>and <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> writ likewise to the Arch-Duke, and the Count of <HI>Fuensaldagna,</HI> “to look upon him as His” particular Friend:</Q> all which Ceremonies, though they cost them no∣thing, were of real benefit and advantage to the Embassadour: for be∣sides the treatment he receiv'd from the Arch-Duke himself in <HI>Brussels,</HI> as Embassadour, such directions, or recommendations, were sent to the Magistrates at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> that he enjoyed the privilege of his Chapel, and all the <HI>English,</HI> who were numerous then in that City, repaired <MILESTONE N="20"/> thither with all freedom for their devotion, and the exercise of their Religion: which liberty had never been before granted to any Man there, and which the <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Priests, and the Roman Catho∣licks of those Nations, exceedingly murmur'd at, and used all the En∣deavours they could to have taken away, though in vain.</P>
<P>IN his passage through <HI>France</HI> he waited upon the Queen Mother, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In his pas∣sage through</HI> France <HI>he waits on the Queen Mo∣ther.</HI></NOTE> who receiv'd him very graciously; and he found there, that the success which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had obtain'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> (though the King was still there, and in a better condition than before) had the same effect in the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> it gave over all thoughts of the King, as in a condition not only deplorable, but as absolutely desperate. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THERE had, a little before, fallen out an accident that troubled <HI>France</HI> very much, and no less pleased <HI>Spain;</HI> which was the death of the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> a young Prince of great hope and expectation, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of the Prince of</HI> Orange.</NOTE> and of a spirit that desired to be in Action. He had found, that the Peace between <HI>Spain</HI> and the Low-Countries, which his Father had been so sollicitous to make, even at his expiration, was not like to pre∣serve him in equal lustre to what the three former Princes had enjoyed; and therefore he wished nothing more, than that an opportunity might be offer'd to enter upon the War. He complain'd loudly, that the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> had not observ'd, nor perform'd, many of those Conditions <MILESTONE N="40"/> which it was obliged to do for the particular benefit of him, and his family: whereby he continued involv'd in many debts, which were un∣easy to him; and so, upon all occasions which fell out, he adher'd to that Party in the States which were known most to favour the Interest of <HI>France;</HI> which inclination the Cardinal, and the other Ministers of that Crown, used all possible care and endeavour to cultivate: and <HI>Spain</HI> was so much affected with the apprehension of the consequence of that alteration, and with the conscience of their own having promoted it, by not having complied with their obligations, that they resolv'd to redeem their error, and to reconcile him again, if possible, to them. <MILESTONE N="50"/> To this purpose, a very great present was prepared at <HI>Madrid</HI> to be sent to him, ten brave <HI>Spanish</HI> Horses, the worst of which cost there
<PB N="300" REF="3160"/>
three hundred pounds sterling, with many other rarities of great value; and likewise a present of Plate, Jewels, and perfum'd Leather, to the Princess Royal his Wife; <Q>and a full assurance, “that they would forth. with begin to perform all the Articles which were to be done by them,” and finish all within a short time.</Q></P>
<P>THE Express, who was appointed to accompany the present, and to perform the other functions, was to begin his journey within two days, when the News arriv'd, by an Express from <HI>Brussels,</HI> who came in as short a time as could be imagin'd, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was dead of the small Pox, and had left the Princess with Child, and very near <MILESTONE N="10"/> her time; who was brought to bed of a Son within few days after his <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Princess deliver'd of a Son shortly af∣ter.</NOTE> decease. The Court at <HI>Madrid</HI> could not conceal its joy, nor dissemble their opinion, that the Enemy whose influence they most apprehended, was fortunately taken out of the way. On the other hand, <HI>France</HI> own'd a great sorrow and grief for the loss of a Man whom they believ'd to be more than ordinarily affected to them; and who, by a conjunction with their Friends in <HI>Holland,</HI> might, in a short time, be much superior to that Party in the States which adher'd to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Interest.</P>
<P>BUT no body receiv'd so insupportable prejudice, and damage, by this fatal blow, as the King of Great <HI>Britain</HI> did; towards whom that <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King lost a sure Friend in the Prince.</NOTE> brave Prince gave all the testimony and manifestation of the most entire, fast, and unshaken Affection and Friendship, that hath ever been per∣form'd towards any Person under any signal misfortune. <Q>Besides the assisting him upon several emergent occasions, with greater Sums of Money than were easy to his incumber'd fortune, his reputation, and his declared resolution, “that he would venture all he had in that quar∣rel,” disposed many to be more concern'd for his Majesty.</Q> Though he could not prevail over that Faction in <HI>Holland,</HI> which were known to favour <HI>Cromwell</HI> (and the more out of their aversion to him, and to his power and greatness) to induce them to serve the King, yet he kept the <MILESTONE N="30"/> States General from consenting to that infamous Alliance and Con∣junction, which, shortly after his death, they enter'd into with the new Republick; and which they would never have yielded to, if He had liv'd. And, no doubt, the respect both <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> had for him, and his interposition, had prevailed with both to be more restrain'd than they afterwards appear'd to be, in a total declining all consideration of the King, and rejecting all thoughts of his Restoration. It contributed very much to the negligent Farewel the Embassadous had receiv'd in <HI>Spain:</HI> for the news of the Prince's death had arriv'd there some time before their departure; and it did not only extinguish all imaginations <MILESTONE N="40"/> in <HI>France</HI> of any possible hope for our King, but very much lessen'd the respect, and civility, which that Court had allways shew'd to the Queen her self, as a Daughter of <HI>France;</HI> towards whom they expressed not that regard they had formerly done.</P>
<P>BUT there was another accident, which, at this time, gave the Queen more trouble than this; and of which her Majesty made great complaint to the Chancellor of the Exchequer at his return from <HI>Spain.</HI> Upon the Interview which had been between the King and the Queen at <HI>Beauvais,</HI> when the King went for <HI>Holland,</HI> upon the foresight, if not the resolution, that it would be fit for him to adventure his own Per∣son <MILESTONE N="50"/> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> he had left his Brother the Duke of <HI>York</HI> with the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Touching the Duke of</HI> York <HI>left with the Queen.</HI></NOTE> Queen, with direction <Q>“that he should conform himself entirely to the will and pleasure of the Queen his Mother, matters of Religion only”
<PB N="301" REF="3170"/>
excepted.</Q> And there was the less doubt of his conformity to her com∣mands, because, besides his piety and duty, which was very entire to∣wards her, he was to depend wholely upon Her bounty for his Support; the Court of <HI>France</HI> not taking any notice of this increase of her ex∣pence, nor paying her own narrow assignation with any punctuality; so that she was not able, besides the reservedness in her Nature, so to supply him as to make his condition pleasant to him; but exercised the same austere carriage towards Him, which she had done to the Prince his Brother, and as unsuccessfully. The Duke was very young, with a numerous Family of his own, not well enough inclined to be contented, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and consisting of Persons who lov'd not one another, nor their Master well enough to consider him before themselves: which wrought that effect upon him, that none of them had that credit with him, that, at such an Age, some good Men ought to have had: which proceeded from want of reasonable providence and circumspection. For when he made his Escape out of <HI>England</HI> (as is mention'd before) he had only one Person attending him (who had, before, no relation or pretence to his Service) whose merit might have been otherwise requited, than by giving him a title and dependence upon him; and he quickly appear'd to be so unworthy of it, that he was remov'd from it. Then was the <MILESTONE N="20"/> time that such Persons should have been placed about him, as might have both discover'd such infirmities, as his Nature might incline him to, and have infused those Principles of Virtue, and Honour, as he was most capable of, and disposed to; and which had been as proper for his present misfortune, as for his highest dignity. But that Province was wholely committed to the Queen his Mother by the late King, who was then in Prison; and her Majesty being then at <HI>Paris,</HI> when the Duke landed in <HI>Holland,</HI> she could not deliberate so long upon it as such a subject required; and so was perswaded by others to consider Them more than her Son; and made hast to put such a family about him, <MILESTONE N="30"/> with reference to the number, and to the Offices which they were de∣sign'd to serve in, as was above the greatness to which the younger Son of the Crown of <HI>England</HI> could pretend, by the usage and custom of that Kingdom, when it was in the greatest splendour; and all this, when there was not in view the least Revenue to support it, but that the whole charge and burthen of it must inevitably fall upon Her; of which her Majesty was quickly sensible, and paid the penalty at least in the peace and quiet of her mind.</P>
<P>THE Duke was full of Spirit and Courage, and naturally lov'd de∣signs, and desired to engage himself in some Action that might improve and advance the low condition of the King his Brother; towards whom <MILESTONE N="40"/> he had an inviolable Affection and Fidelity, superior to any temptation. He was not pleased with the treatment he receiv'd in <HI>France,</HI> nor had confidence enough in any of his Servants, to be advised by them towards the contriving any expedient that he might reasonably dispose himself to, or to be disswaded from any Enterprise which his own passion might suggest to him; though too many had too much credit with him in con∣tributing to his discontents, and in representing the uncomfortableness of his own condition to him; <Q>“the little regard the Queen appear'd to have of him, the lustre that some of her Servants liv'd in, and those who depended upon them, whilst his Royal Highness wanted all that <MILESTONE N="50"/> was necessary, and his Servants were exposed to the most scandalous” necessities and contempt;</Q> which suggestions, by degrees, began to
<PB N="302" REF="3180"/>
abate that reverence in him to the Queen his Mother, to which he was very dutifully inclined.</P>
<P>THERE were at that time two Persons, who, though without any relation to the Court, very much frequented the Duke's lodgings, and had frequent discourses with him, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Herbert,</HI> the late King's <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Edward Herbert <HI>and S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> G. Ratcliff <HI>have great in∣terest in him.</HI></NOTE> Atturney General (of whom much is said before) and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Rat∣cliff,</HI> who had been design'd by that King to attend upon the Duke of <HI>York</HI> into <HI>Ireland,</HI> when he once thought of sending him thither. But that design being quickly laid aside, there was no more thought of using his Service there. The Duke looked upon them both as wise Men, and fit to give him advice; and finding that they both applied themselves <MILESTONE N="10"/> to him with diligence, and address, he communicated his thoughts more freely to Them than to any others. And they took pains to perswade him to dislike the condition he was in, and that he might spend his time more to his advantage in some other place than in <HI>France.</HI> <Q>They spoke <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They recom∣mend to him the pattern of the Duke of</HI> Lorraine.</NOTE> often to him of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> “as a pattern and example for all unfortunate Princes to follow: that he being, by the power and in∣justice of the King of <HI>France,</HI> driven out of his Principality and Do∣minions, had, by his own Virtue and Activity, put himself in the head of an Army; by which he made himself so considerable, that he was courted by both the Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and might <MILESTONE N="20"/> make his conditions with either according to his own election; and in the mean time liv'd with great reputation, and in great plenty, esteem'd” by all the world for his courage and conduct.</Q> With these, and the like discourses, the Duke was much pleased, and amused, and wish'd in himself that he could be put into such a condition, when in truth there could not a more improper Example have been proposed to him, whose condition was more unlike his, or whose fortune and manners he was less to wish to follow, or less able to imitate. For the Duke of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Lorraine<HI>'s Character.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lorraine</HI> had, for many years before his misfortunes, had a great name in War, and was looked upon as one of the greatest Captains of <HI>Christen∣dom;</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> and had drawn the Armes, and power of <HI>France</HI> upon him, by his inconstancy, and adhering to <HI>Spain,</HI> contrary to his Treaty and obli∣gation with the other Crown; and when he was driven out of his own Country, and not able to defend it, he was in the head of a very good Army, and possessed of great Wealth, which he carried with him, and could not but be very welcome, as he well knew, into <HI>Flanders,</HI> both as his misfortune proceeded from his Affection to their King, and as his Forces were necessary for their defence. And so he made such con∣ditions with them, as were most beneficial to himself, and yet, in the <MILESTONE N="40"/> consequence, so unsuccessful, as might well terrify all other Princes from treading in the same footsteps.</P>
<P>WITH the report of the defeat of that Army by <HI>Cromwell</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King be∣liev'd in</HI> France <HI>to be dead.</HI></NOTE> (which was the first good fortune to the King) or shortly after, some Letters from <HI>England</HI> brought Intelligence, without any ground, that the King was dangerously sick; and, shortly after, that he was dead; which was believ'd in <HI>England,</HI> and from thence transmitted into <HI>France.</HI> This gave a new Alarm to those two Gentlemen mention'd before, who receiv'd this information from such Friends in <HI>England,</HI> that they did really believe it to be true; and thereupon concluded, that both the <MILESTONE N="50"/> place and the company would not be fit for the new King to be found in: and therefore that it would be necessary for him to remove from thence, before the report should be confirm'd, and believ'd.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="3190"/>
<Q>WHETHER they imparted this nice consideration to the Duke or not, his Highness, without any preface of the motives, told the Queen, “”he was resolv'd to make a journey to <HI>Brussels;</HI></Q> who, being exceedingly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>ac∣quaints his Mother that he will go to</HI> Brussels; <HI>Whi∣ther he gos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> surprised, ask'd him the reason; <Q>and “”how he could be able to make such a journey:</Q> which she in truth believ'd impossible for him, since she knew he had no Money. <Q>His Answer in short was, “that he would visit the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> who had been allways a friend to his Father, and continued his Affection to the King his Brother; and he had some reason to believe, that Duke would enable him to appear in action, that might be for his Majesty's service; and that he was resolv'd to be∣gin” his journey the next day;</Q> from which, neither the Queen's advice, <MILESTONE N="10"/> nor Authority, could divert him. Her Majesty quickly discern'd, that neither the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> nor S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkeley,</HI> nor M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bennet,</HI> his Se∣cretary, knew any thing of it; and therefore easily concluded who the Counsellors were; who were both very ungracious to her, and she had long done all she could to lessen the Duke's esteem of them. They well foresaw that the want of Money would be of that force, that, without any other difficulty, the journey would be render'd impossible. They had therefore, upon their own credit, or out of their own store, pro∣cur'd as much as would defray the journey to <HI>Brussels;</HI> which, by the <MILESTONE N="20"/> Duke's directions, was put into the hands of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Ratcliffe,</HI> and to be managed by his providence and discretion. And then he publickly declar'd his resolution to begin his journey the next day for <HI>Brussels,</HI> leaving his Servants to make what shift they could to stay there, or follow him.</P>
<P>SINCE there was no remedy, the Queen thought it necessary that his chief Servants should wait on him, that she might receive an Account what progress he made, and what his design could be: so the Lord <HI>By∣ron,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bennet,</HI> made themselves ready for the journey; S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkeley</HI> choosing to stay behind, that he might not appear inferior where he had exercised the supreme Charge. And so, with the other <MILESTONE N="30"/> two Counsellors, and many of the inferiour Servants, the Duke, ac∣cording to his resolution, left the Queen; and, when he came to <HI>Brus∣sels,</HI> he lodged at the House of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry de Vic</HI> the King's Resident, without being taken notice of by any of that Court. There the two Coun∣sellors begun to form his family, and to confer Offices upon those who were most acceptable to them; presuming that they should shortly re∣ceive News from <HI>England,</HI> which would confirm all that they had done under other titles. In the mean time the Government of the House, and ordering the expence, was committed wholely to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Ratcliff,</HI> whilst the other contented himself with presiding in the Counsels, and <MILESTONE N="40"/> directing all the politick designs. The Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> had visited the Duke upon his first arrival, and being inform'd of the streights his Royal Highness was in, presented him with one thousand Pistols. But now the secret ground of all their Counsels, was found to be without any reality: the King was not only alive, and in good health, but known to be in the head of an Army that look'd <HI>Cromwell</HI> in the face; which destroy'd all the Machine they had raised: yet, being too far embark'd to retire with any grace, and being encouraged by the civility the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> had shew'd towards the Duke, they had the presumption to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His two Coun∣sellors propose a Match for him with the Duke of</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame<HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astard Da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</HI></NOTE> propose that there might be a Marriage between the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and <MILESTONE N="$$"/> the daughter of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> by the Countess of <HI>Canteeroy;</HI> whom he had publickly married, but which Marriage was declar'd
<PB N="304" REF="3200"/>
at <HI>Rome</HI> to be void, by reason that his former Wife was still alive.</P>
<P>WHEN the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> saw how the Affairs of this young Prince were conducted, and that the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bennet,</HI> who were Men well bred, and able to have discoursed any business to him, one whereof was his Governour and the other his Secretary, who by their Offices ought to be more trusted in an Affair of that moment, were not at all acquainted with it, and that the other two Persons, who were Men of a very unusual mien, appear'd in it, and that only S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Ratcliff</HI> undertook to speak to him about it, who could only make him∣self understood in <HI>Latin,</HI> which the Duke cared not to speak in, he de∣clin'd entertaining the motion, till he might know that it was made <MILESTONE N="10"/> with the King's approbation; <Q>which the other did not pretend it to be, but “that he did not doubt it would be afterwards approv'd by his Ma∣jesty.”</Q> Thus they were at the end of their projects; and there being no means to stay longer at <HI>Brussels,</HI> they perswaded the Duke to visit his Sister at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and there to consider, and advise what was next <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke vi∣sits his Sister at the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> to be done.</P>
<P>OF all these particulars the Queen complain'd to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with great bitterness against the folly and presumption of those two Gentlemen, whose fidelity to the King she did not suspect; nor could she imagine the motive that had engaged them in such a bold <MILESTONE N="20"/> undertaking; <Q>but she requir'd him, “that, assoon as he should come into <HI>Flanders,</HI> he would make a journey to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and prevail with” the Duke (to whom she writ to the same purpose)</Q> <Q>“to return again” to <HI>Paris,</HI> which the Chancellor promised to endeavour heartily to do, being exceedingly troubled at the general discourse, which that Sally had administer'd, as if there were a Schism in the Royal family in a season when so much union was requisite.</Q></P>
<P>THERE was another instance of the King's extreme low condition, and of the highest disrespect the Court of <HI>France</HI> could express towards him, and of which all the Protestant Party of the Queen's family com∣plain'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> very vehemently. From the time of the Queen's being in <HI>France,</HI> the late King had appointed a Chaplain of his own, D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Cosins,</HI> who was afterwards Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> to attend upon her Majesty for the con∣stant service of that part of her Houshold, the number of her Protestant Servants being much superior to those who were Roman Catholicks. And the Queen had allways punctually comply'd with the King's di∣rections, and used the Chaplain very graciously, and assign'd him a competent support with the rest of her Servants. An under room in the <HI>Louvre,</HI> out of any common passage, had been assign'd for their morning and evening devotions; the Key whereof was committed to <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Chaplain; who caused the room to be decently furnish'd, and kept; being made use of to no other purpose. Here, when the Prince first came thither, and afterwards, whilst he stay'd, he perform'd his Devo∣tions all the week, but went <HI>Sundays</HI> still to the Resident's House to hear Sermons. <Q>At this time an Order was sent from the Queen Regent, “that that room should be no more apply'd to that purpose, and that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Cosins <HI>for∣bid to officiate to the Prote∣stants in the Queen's fami∣ly at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> the <HI>French</HI> King would not permit the Exercise of any other Religion” in any of his Houses than the Roman Catholick:</Q> <Q>and the Queen gave notice to the Chaplain, “that she was no longer able to continue the” payment of the Exhibition she had formerly assign'd to him.</Q> The Pro∣testants, <MILESTONE N="50"/> whereof many were of the best Quality, lamented this Altera∣tion to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and desired him to intercede
<PB N="305" REF="3210"/>
with the Queen, which he had the more title to do, because, at his go∣ing into <HI>Spain,</HI> she had vouchsafed to promise him (upon some Rumours, of which he took notice) <Q>“that the same Privilege which had been, should still be continued, and enjoy'd by the Protestants of her Houshold; and that she would provide for the Chaplain's Subsistence. He pre∣sum'd therefore to speak with her Majesty upon it; and besought her <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancellor speaks with the Queen about it.</NOTE> to consider, what ill impression this new Order would make upon the Protestants of all the King's Dominions; upon whom he was chiefly to depend for his Restoration; and how much prejudice it might be to her self, to be look'd upon as a greater Enemy to Protestants, than she had been taken notice of to be; and likewise, whether this Or∣der, <MILESTONE N="10"/> which had been given since the departure of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> might not be made use of as an excuse for his not returning, or indeed for his going away at first, since the precise time when it issued, would” not be generally understood.</Q> <Q>The Queen heard him very graciously, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's Answer.</NOTE> and acknowledged “that what he said had reason in it; but protested that she knew not what remedy to apply to it; that she had been her self surprised with that Order, and was troubled at it; but that the Queen Regent was positive in it, and blamed her for want of Zeal in her Religion; and that she cared not to advance it, or to convert any” <MILESTONE N="20"/> of her Children.</Q> <Q>She wish'd him “to confer with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mountague”</HI> upon it;</Q> <Q>and imply'd, “that His bigotry in his new Religion, had con∣tributed” much to the procuring that Order.</Q> He had newly taken Or∣ders, and was become Priest in that Church, and had great power with the Queen Regent, as well for his Animosity against that Religion he Had professed, as for his vehement Zeal for the Church of which he now was. <Q>Upon this occasion, her Majesty expressed a great sense of the loss she had sustain'd by the death of her old Confessor, Father <HI>Phillips;</HI> who, she said, “was a prudent and discreet Man; and would never suffer her to be pressed to any passionate undertakings, under pretence of doing good for Catholicks; and allways told her, that, as she ought <MILESTONE N="30"/> to continue firm and constant to her own Religion, so she was to live well towards the Protestants, who deserv'd well from her, and to” whom she was beholding.</Q> <Q>She said, “it would not be possible to have the same or any other room set aside, or allow'd to be used as a Cha∣pel; but that she would take such course, that the family might meet for the Exercise of their devotion in some private room that belong'd to their Lodgings: and that though her own Exhibition was so ill paid, that she was indebted to all her Servants, yet she would give Order that Doctor <HI>Cosins</HI> (against whom she had some personal exceptions)” should receive his Salary, in proportion with the rest of her Servants.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <Q>She bid him “assure the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> that he should have a free Exer∣cise of his Religion, as he had before, though it must not be in the same” place.</Q></P>
<P>THE Chancellor conferr'd with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mountague</HI> upon the Subject; and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor confers with Mr</HI> Mounta¦gue <HI>about it</HI></NOTE> offer'd the same reasons which he had done to the Queen; which he looked upon as of no moment; <Q>but said, “that the King of <HI>France</HI> was Master in his own House, and he was resolv'd, though the King of <HI>England</HI> himself should come thither again, never to permit any so∣lemn” exercise of the Protestant Religion in any House of his.</Q> The consideration of what the Protestants in <HI>England</HI> might think on this <MILESTONE N="50"/> occasion, was of least moment to him <Q>and it was indeed the Common discourse there, “that the Protestants of the Church of <HI>England</HI> could
<PB N="306" REF="3220"/>
never do the King Service, but that all his hopes must be in the Ro∣man Catholicks, and the Presbyterians; and that he ought to give all” satisfaction to both those Parties.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHEN the Chancellor of the Exchequer came to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> with a purpose to make a journey speedily to the <HI>Hague,</HI> he was inform'd, “that the States were much offended that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> remain'd there;” and therefore that the Princess Royal (who now more depended upon their favour than ever;</Q> <Q>her own joynture, as well as the fortune of her Son, being to be be setled in their judicatory) “could no longer enter∣tain” him, but that he would be the next day at <HI>Breda.</HI></Q> Thither the Chancellor immediately went; and found the Duke there with a fa∣mily <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor finds the Duke of</HI> York <HI>at</HI> Breda▪ <HI>and the sactions of the Duke's family there.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"/> in all the confusion imaginable, in present want of every thing, and not knowing what was to be done next. They all censur'd and re∣proach'd the Counsel by which they had been guided, and the Counsellors as bitterly inveigh'd against each other, for undertaking many things which had no foundation in truth. They who concurr'd in nothing else, were equally severe against the Atturney, as a Man of that intolerable pride that it was not possible for any Man to converse with him. He as frankly reproach'd them all with being Men of no parts, of no under∣standing, nor learning, no principles, and no resolution, and was so just to them all, as to contemn every Man of them alike. In truth he had <MILESTONE N="20"/> render'd himself so grievous to them all, that there was no Man who desir'd to be in his Company; yet, by the knack of his talk, which was the most like reason without being it, he retain'd still too much credit with the Duke; who, being amused and confounded with his positive discourse, thought him to be wiser than those who were more easily un∣derstood; and was himself so young, that he was rather delighted with the journeys he had made, than sensible that he had not enter'd upon them with reason enough; and was fortified with a firm resolution never to acknowledge that he had committed any error. However, he was <MILESTONE N="30"/> very glad to receive the Queen's Letter, which the Chancellor deliver'd to him; heard his advice very willingly, and resolv'd to begin his jour∣ney to <HI>Paris</HI> without any delay; and look'd upon the occasion, as a very seasonable redemption. The next day he went to <HI>Antwerp;</HI> and from thence, with the same retinue he had carried with him, made hast to <HI>Paris,</HI> and was receiv'd by the Queen his Mother without those <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke re∣turns to</HI> Paris <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Queen.</HI></NOTE> expostulations and reprehensions which he might reasonably have ex∣pected; though her severity was the same towards all those, who, she thought, had had the credit and power to seduce him; and they were not sollicitous, by any Apologies or Confession, to recover her favour: for the true reason that had sway'd them being not to be avow'd, any <MILESTONE N="40"/> other that they could devise and suggest, would have render'd them more inexcusable.</P>
<P>DURING this time, the King underwent all kind of Mortifications <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's af∣fairs in</HI> Scot∣land.</NOTE> in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But after the defeat of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army in <HI>September,</HI> with which the King and <HI>Cromwell</HI> were equally delighted, as hath been said before, the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Empire seem'd not to be so ab∣solute. A new Army was appointed to be raised; the King himself in∣terposed more than he had done; and the Noblemen and Officers came to him with more confidence; and his Majesty took upon him to com∣plain <MILESTONE N="50"/> and expostulate, when those things were done which he did not like: Yet the power was still in <HI>Argyle</HI>'s hands; who, under all the professions of humility, exercised still the same Tyranny; insomuch as
<PB N="307" REF="3230"/>
the King grew weary of his own patience, and resolv'd to make some attempt to free himself. D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Frazier,</HI> who had been the King's Physician many years before, and had constantly attended upon his Person, and very much contributed to the King's journey into <HI>Scotland,</HI> was, shortly after his coming thither, disliked by <HI>Argyle;</HI> who knew that he was a Creature of the <HI>Hamiltonians,</HI> and found him to be of an unquiet and over active Spirit; and thereupon sequester'd him from his attendance. There were many Officers who had serv'd in Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Engage∣ment, as <HI>Middleton,</HI> and others, who had very entire Affections for the King; and many of them had corresponded with <HI>Mountrose,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="10"/> resolv'd to have joyn'd with him; and finding themselves excluded, as all of them were, from any employment by the power of <HI>Argyle,</HI> had retired into the High-lands, and remain'd there conceal'd in expectation of some good Season, in which they might avowedly appear. With some of these D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Frazier</HI> had held correspondence whilst he was in the Court, and had often spoken to the King of their Affection, and readi∣ness to serve him, and of their power to do it, and had return'd his Ma∣jesty's gracious Acceptation of their Service, and his resolution to em∣ploy them. And now not being himself suffer'd to come to the Court, he found means to meet and confer with many of them; and held In∣telligence <MILESTONE N="20"/> with the Lord <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who had allways great confidence in him; and the Officers undertaking to do more than they could, or the D<SUP>r</SUP> understanding them to undertake more than they did (for his fi∣delity was never suspected) he gave the King such an Account of their numbers, as well as resolutions, that his Majesty appointed a day for their Rendezvous, and promised to be present with them, and then to publish a Declaration (which was likewise prepared) of the ill treat∣ment he had endured, and against the Person of <HI>Argyle;</HI> to whom the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> gave himself wholely up, and imparted to him all this correspondence, having found some of the Letters which had passed, <MILESTONE N="30"/> by the King's having left his Cabinet open; for he was not at all trusted in it.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Argyle</HI> did not think the time so near; so that the King did <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> prosecute this purpose so far, that he rode one day, with a dozen or twenty Horse, into the High-lands, and lodged there one Night; nei∣ther the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> nor any body else, knowing what was be∣come of him; which put them all into great distraction. It was indeed a very empty and unprepared design, contriv'd and conducted by D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Frazier,</HI> without any foundation to build upon; and might well have ruin'd the King. It was afterwards called the <HI>Start;</HI> yet it prov'd, con∣trary <MILESTONE N="40"/> to the expectation of wise Men, very much to his Majesty's ad∣vantage. For though he was compell'd the next day to return, with a <NOTE PLACE="marg">But is per∣swaded to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> turn the n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t day</NOTE> circumstance that seem'd to have somewhat of force in it (for as the Company he looked for failed to appear, so there was a Troop of Horse, which he looked not for, sent by <HI>Argyle,</HI> who used very effectual in∣stance with him to return) yet notwithstanding, this Declaration of his Majesty's resentment, together with the observation of what the Peo∣ple generally spoke upon it, <Q>“that the King was not treated as he ought” to be,</Q> made the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> change his Counsels, and to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> King's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</NOTE> more sollicitous to satisfy the King. A Summons was sent out, in the <MILESTONE N="50"/> King's name, to call a Parliament; and great preparations were really made for the Coronation; and the Season of the year, against which <HI>Cromwell</HI> was securing himself in <HI>Edenborough,</HI> and making Provisions
<PB N="308" REF="3240"/>
for his Army, the Winter coming on, and the strong passes which were easy then to be guarded, hindred the Enemies advance: so that the King resided, sometimes at <HI>Sterling,</HI> and sometimes at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Johnston</HI>'s, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>It meets at</HI> Sterling, <HI>and reconciles the Lords.</HI></NOTE> with convenience enough. The Parliament met at <HI>Sterling,</HI> and shortly after brought all the Lords of the other Party thither, who appear'd to have credit enough to wipe off those stains with which the Engagement had defaced them, yet with submission to stand publickly in the Stool of Repentance, acknowledging their former transgressions; as they all did.</P>
<P>DUKE <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Lautherdale</HI> were welcome to the King, and nearest his confidence; which neither the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="10"/> had cast off their friendship as unuseful, nor the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> were pleased with. The King himself grew very popular, and, by his frequent conferences with the Knights and Burgesses, got any thing passed in the Parliament which he desired. He caused many infamous Acts to be repeal'd, and provided for the raising an Army, whereof himself was General; and no exceptions were taken to those Officers <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Army raised, of which the King is Ge∣neral. The Corona∣tion.</NOTE> who had formerly serv'd the King his Father.</P>
<P>THE Coronation was passed with great solemnity and magnificence, all Men making shew of Joy, and of being united to serve his Majesty: <MILESTONE N="20"/> yet the Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> preserv'd his greatness and interest so well, and was still so considerable, that it was thought very expedient to raise an imagination in him, that the King had a purpose to marry one of his Daughters; which was carried so far, that the King could no other∣wise defend himself from it, than by sending an Express into <HI>France</HI> for the Queen his Mother's consent (which seem'd not to be doubted of) and to that purpose Captain <HI>Titus,</HI> a Person grateful to <HI>Argyle,</HI> and to all the Presbyterian Party, was sent; who, finding the Queen less warm upon the Proposition than was expected, made less hast back; so that the fate of <HI>Scotland</HI> was first determin'd. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE King's Army was as well modelled, and in as good a condition as it was like to be whilst he stayed in <HI>Scotland.</HI> By that time that <HI>Crom∣well</HI> was ready to take the field, his Majesty was perswaded to make <HI>David Lesley</HI> his Lieutenant General of the Army; who had very long experience, and a very good Name in War; and <HI>Middleton</HI> commanded the Horse. The Artillery was in very good order under the command of <HI>Wemmes,</HI> who had not the worse reputation there for having been ungrateful to the King's Father. He was a confessed good Officer; and there were, or could be, very few Officers of any Superior Command, but such who had drawn their Swords against his late Majesty; most of <MILESTONE N="40"/> those who had serv'd under the Marquis of <HI>Mountrose,</HI> having been put to death. Many of the greatest Noblemen had raised Regiments, or Troops; and all the young Gentlemen of the Kingdom appear'd very hearty and chearful in Commands, or Voluntiers: and, in all ap∣pearance, they seem'd a Body equal in any respect, and superior in Num∣ber, to the Enemy; which advanced all they could, and made it mani∣fest that they desired nothing more than to come to Battle; which was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>en∣deavours to fight the King's Army.</HI></NOTE> not thought counsellable for the King's Army to engage in, except upon very notable Advantages; which they had reason every day to expect; for there was a very broad and a deep River between them; and if they <MILESTONE N="50"/> kept the Passes, of which they were possessed, and could hardly choose but keep, <HI>Cromwell</HI> must in a very few days want Provisions, and so be forced to retire, whilst the King had plenty of all things which he stood
<PB N="309" REF="3250"/>
in need of, and could, by the advantage of the Passes, be in his Rere assoon as he thought fit.</P>
<P>IN this posture both Armies stood in view of each other near the two <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Both Armies near each other in the Months of</HI> June <HI>and</HI> July.</NOTE> Months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> with some small attempts upon each other, with equal Success. About the end of <HI>July,</HI> by the cowardise or trea∣chery of Major General <HI>Brown,</HI> who had a Body of four thousand Men to keep it, <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Forces under <HI>Lambert</HI> gain'd the Pass, by which they got behind the King; and though they could not compel his Ma∣jesty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>gains a Pass, and gets be∣hind the King</HI></NOTE> to fight, for there was still the great River between them, they were possessed, or might quickly be, of the most fruitful part of the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Country; and so would not only have sufficient Provision for their own Army, but in a short time would be able to cut off much of that which should supply the King's. This was a great surprise to the King, and put him into new counsels; and he did, with the unanimous Advice of allmost all the principal Officers, and all those who were admitted to the Council, take a resolution worthy of his Courage; which, how un∣fortunate soever it prov'd, was evidence enough that the same misfor∣tune would have fallen out if he had not taken it.</P>
<P>THE King was now, by <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s putting himself behind him, much nearer to <HI>England</HI> than He: nor was it possible for him to over∣take <MILESTONE N="20"/> his Majesty, in regard of the ways he was unavoidably to pass, till after the King had been some days march before him: his Majesty's fate depended upon the Success of one Battle: for a possible Escape into the High-lands, after a Defeat, there was no Kingly prospect: all the Northern parts of <HI>England</HI> had given him cause to believe that they were very well affected to his Service, and if he could reach those Coun∣tries, he might presume to encrease his Army, which was numerous enough, with an Addition of such Men as would make it much more considerable. Hereupon, with the concurrence aforesaid, it was resolv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣solves to march into</HI> England.</NOTE> that the Army should immediately march, with as much Expedition as was possible, into <HI>England,</HI> by the nearest ways, which led into <HI>Lan∣cashire,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> whither the King sent Expresses to give those, of whom he ex∣pected much (by reason some of them had been in <HI>Scotland</HI> with him, with promise of large undertakings) notice of his purpose, that they might get their Soldiers together to receive him. <Q>His Majesty sent like∣wise an Express to the Isle of <HI>Man,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> had se∣curely reposed himself from the end of the former War, “that he should” meet his Majesty in <HI>Lancashire.</HI></Q> The Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> was the only <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Argyle <HI>only disswaded it and stayed be∣hind and re∣tired to his House</HI></NOTE> Man who disswaded his Majesty's march into <HI>England,</HI> with reasons which were not frivolous; but the contrary prevailed; and he stayed behind; and, when the King begun his march, retired to his House in <MILESTONE N="40"/> the High-lands. Some were of opinion, that he should then have been made Prisoner, and left so secured that he might not be able to do mis∣chief when the King was gone, which most Men believ'd he would in∣cline to. <Q>But his Majesty would not consent to it, because he was con∣fident “he would not attempt any thing while the Army was entire: if it prevailed, he neither would, nor could do any harm; and if it” were defeated, it would be no great matter what he did.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Cromwell</HI> was not frequently without good Intelligence what was done in the King's Army, and Councils, yet this last resolu∣tion was consulted with so great secrecy, and executed with that won∣derful <MILESTONE N="50"/> expedition, that the King had marched a whole day without his comprehending what the meaning was, and before he receiv'd the least
<PB N="310" REF="3260"/>
advertisement of it. It was not a small surprise to him, nor was it easy <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell<HI>'s Resolutions and Counsels upon this News.</HI></NOTE> for him to resolve what to do. If he should follow with his whole Ar∣my, all the Advantages he had got in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would be presently lost, and the whole Kingdom be again united in any new mischief. If he followed but with part, he might be too weak when he overtook the King; whose Army, he knew, would bear the fatigue of a long march better than His could do. There were two considerations which trou∣bled him exceedingly; the one, the terrible consternation he foresaw the Parliament would be in, when they heard that the King with his Army was nearer to them, than their own Army was for their defence; <MILESTONE N="10"/> and he knew that he had Enemies enough to improve their fear, and to lessen his Conduct: the other was, the Apprehension, that, if the King had time given to rest in any place, he would infinitely encrease and strengthen his Army by the resort of the People, as well as the Gentry and Nobility, from all parts. And though he did so much un∣dervalue the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, that he would have been glad to have found himself engaged with it, upon any inequality of Numbers, and disad∣vantage of ground, yet he did believe, that, by a good mixture with <HI>English,</HI> they might be made very considerable. He took a very quick resolution to provide for all the best he could: he dispatched an Express <MILESTONE N="20"/> to the Parliament, to prevent their being surprised with the News; <Q>and to assure them, “that he would himself overtake the Enemy be∣fore” they should give them any trouble;</Q> and gave such farther Orders for drawing the Auxiliary Troops together in the several Counties, as he thought fit.</P>
<P><Q>HE gave <HI>Lambert</HI> Order, “immediately to follow the King with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Orders</HI> Lam∣bert <HI>to follow the King with a Body of Horse.</HI></NOTE> seven or eight hundred Horse, and to draw as many others, as he could, from the Country Militia; and to disturb his Majesty's march the most he could, by being near, and obliging him to march close; not engaging his own Party in any sharp Actions, without a very notorious” advantage;</Q> but to keep himself entire till he should come up to him. <MILESTONE N="30"/> With this Order <HI>Lambert</HI> marched away the same day the advertise∣ment came.</P>
<P><Q>CROMWELL resolv'd then to leave Major General <HI>Monk,</HI> upon <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leaves</HI> Monk <HI>in</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> whom he look'd with most confidence, as an excellent Officer of Foot, and as entirely devoted to him, with a strong Party of Foot, and some Troops of Horse, strong enough to suppress any Forces which should rise after his departure, “to keep <HI>Edenborough,</HI> and the Harbour of <HI>Lieth;</HI> to surprise and apprehend as many of the Nobility, and consi∣derable Gentry, as he should suspect, and keep them under custody; <MILESTONE N="40"/> to use the highest severity against all who opposed him; and, above all, not to endure or permit the Licence of the Preachers in their Pulpits; and to make himself as formidable as was possible: in the last place, that, assoon as there appear'd no visible force in the field, he should” besiege <HI>Sterlin;</HI></Q> whither most Persons of condition were retired with their Goods of Value, as to a place of strength, and capable of being desended; where the Records of the Kingdom, and many other things of most account were deposited; <Q>it being the place where the King had, for the most part, resided. He charged him, “if at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Johnston</HI>'s, or any other place, he found a stubborn resistance, and were forced to spend much <MILESTONE N="50"/> time, or to take it by Storm, that he should give no Quarter, nor” exempt it from a general Plunder;</Q> all which Rules <HI>Monk</HI> observ'd with the utmost rigour; and made himself as terrible as Man could be.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="3270"/>
WHEN <HI>Cromwell</HI> had dispatch'd all these Orders and Directions, with marvellous Expedition, and seen most of them advanced in some de∣gree, he begun his own March with the remainder of his Army, three <NOTE PLACE="marg">And follows the King three days after</NOTE> days after the King was gone, with a wonderful chearfulness, and as∣surance to the Officers and Soldiers, that he should obtain a full Victory in <HI>England</HI> over those who fled from him out of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>THE King had, from the time that he had recover'd any Authority in <HI>Scotland,</HI> granted a Commission to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> to raise a Regiment of Horse which <HI>Massey</HI> was to command under him, and to raise another Regiment of Foot. And the <HI>English</HI> which should resort <MILESTONE N="10"/> thither, of which they expected great Numbers, were to list themselves in those Regiments. And there were some who had listed themselves accordingly; but the discipline the <HI>Scots</HI> had used to the King, and their adhering to their old Principles, even after they seem'd united for his Majesty, had kept the King's friends in <HI>England</HI> from repairing to them in <HI>Scotland.</HI> They who came from <HI>Holland</HI> with the King, had dis∣posed themselves as is said before, and there was little doubt but that, assoon as the King should enter <HI>England,</HI> those two Regiments would be immediately full. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> had lost much ground (and the more because the King was not pleased with it) by his having <MILESTONE N="20"/> broken off all manner of friendship with Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> (to whom he had professed so much) and had enter'd into so fast a conjunction with the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> their declar'd ir∣reconcilable Enemy, and adhered so firmly to him, when he was less dutiful to the King than he ought to have been. <HI>Massey</HI> had got a great Name by his defending <HI>Glocester</HI> against the late King, and was look'd upon as a Martyr for the Presbyterian Interest, and so very dear to that Party; and therefore, assoon as they came within the borders of <HI>England,</HI> he was sent with some Troops before, and was allways to march at least <NOTE PLACE="marg">Massey <HI>sent to march before the King.</HI></NOTE> a day before the Army, to the end that he might give notice of the King's <MILESTONE N="30"/> coming, and draw the Gentry of the Counties through which he pass'd, to be ready to attend upon his Majesty. Besides, he had particular ac∣quaintance with most of the Presbyterians of <HI>Lancashire;</HI> whom No∣body imagin'd to be of the <HI>Scotish</HI> temper, or unwilling to unite and joyn with the Royal Party; nor indeed were they.</P>
<P>BUT it was fatal at that time to all <HI>Scotish</HI> Armies, to have allways in them a Committee of Ministers, who ruin'd all; and though there <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee of Ministers in the King's Army, who ruin all.</NOTE> had been now all the care taken that could be, to choose such Men for that service as had the reputation of being the most sober, and mode∣rate of that whole Body, and who had shew'd more Affection, and ad∣vanced <MILESTONE N="40"/> the King's Service more than the rest; yet this moderate Peo∣ple no sooner heard that <HI>Massey</HI> was sent before to call upon their friends, and observ'd that, from the entrance into <HI>England,</HI> those about the King seem'd to have less regard for the Covenant than formerly, but they sent an Express to him, without communicating it in the least degree with the King, with Letters, and a Declaration, wherein they requir'd him <Q>“to publish that Declaration, which signified the King's, and the whole Army's Zeal for the Covenant, and their resolution to” prosecute the true intent of it;</Q> <Q>and forbid him “to receive or enter∣tain any Soldiers in his Troops, but those who would subscribe that” <MILESTONE N="50"/> obligation.</Q> <Q>The King had soon notice of this, and lost no time in send∣ing to <HI>Massey</HI> “not to publish any such Declaration, and to behave him∣self with equal civility towards all Men who were forward to serve”
<PB N="312" REF="3280"/>
his Majesty.</Q> But before this inhibition was receiv'd, the matter had taken Air in all places, and was spread over the Kingdom; all Men fled from their Houses, or concealed themselves, who wished the King very well; and besides, his Motion was so quick, that none of them could repair to him.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Lancashire</HI> the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> met him; who, assoon as he receiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Derby <HI>met the King in</HI> Lancashire.</NOTE> his Summons, left the Isle of <HI>Man.</HI> When the King's Army came about <HI>Warrington</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> they found, that there was a Body of the Ene∣my drawn up in a fair Field, which did not appear considerable enough to stop their march. This was <HI>Lambert;</HI> who had made so much hast, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>fol∣lows, but is forced to re∣tire.</HI></NOTE> that he had that day fallen upon some of their Troops, and beaten them <MILESTONE N="10"/> into the Army; but when the Army came up, <HI>Lambert,</HI> according to his Order and purpose, retir'd, and, being pursued by the King's Horse with a greater party, made more hast than a well order'd retreat requires, but with no considerable loss. This Success made a great noise, as if <HI>Lambert</HI> had been defeated.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Warrington</HI> it was thought Counsellable, very unfortunately, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At</HI> Warring∣ton <HI>the Earl of</HI> Derby <HI>parts from the King, and is sent to</HI> Lancashire <HI>with other Of∣ficers to raise Forces.</HI></NOTE> that the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Withrington,</HI> and several other Officers of good name, should return into <HI>Lancashire,</HI> in order to raise the well affected in those two Counties of <HI>Lancashire</HI> and <HI>Cheshire;</HI> who <MILESTONE N="20"/> could not come in upon so quick a march, as the King had made: and yet it being out of the road that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was to follow, who was enter'd into <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> the remaining of those Persons there, was thought a good Expedient to gather a Body of <HI>English,</HI> which the King extremely desir'd: and if they found any great difficulties, they were to follow the Army. In order to which, the Earl had a Body of near two hundred Horse, consisting, for the most part, of Officers, and Gentlemen; which depriv'd the Army of a strength they wanted; and was afterwards ac∣knowledged to be a Counsel too suddainly enter'd upon.</P>
<P>UPON appearance of that Body of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s, the whole Army was drawn up, and appear'd very chearful. The King having observ'd <HI>David</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Lesley,</HI> throughout the whole march, sad and melancholy, and, at that time when the Enemy retired, and plainly in a quicker pace than a good retreat used to be made, slow in giving Orders, and residing by himself, his Majesty rode up to him, and ask'd him, with great alacrity, <Q>“how he could be sad, when he was in the head of so brave an Army? (which he said look'd well that day) and demanded of him, how he” lik'd them?</Q> <Q>To which <HI>David Lesley</HI> answer'd him in his ear, being <NOTE PLACE="marg">David Lesley<HI>'s saying concern∣ing the</HI> Scot∣ish <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> at some distance from any other, “that he was melancholy indeed, for” he well knew that Army,</Q> how well soever it look'd, would not fight: <MILESTONE N="40"/> which the King imputed to the chagrin of his humour, and gave it no credit, nor told it to any Man till, some years after, upon another oc∣casion which will be remember'd in it's place, he told the Chancellor of the Exchequer of it.</P>
<P>IT was not thought fit to pursue <HI>Lambert;</HI> who, being known to be a Man of Courage and Conduct, and his Troops to be of the best, was suspected, by so disorderly a Retreat, to have only design'd to have drawn the Army another way, to disorder and disturb their march; which they resolv'd to continue with the same expedition they had hi∣therto used, which was incredible; until they should come to such a Post as they might securely rest themselves. And there was an imagi∣nation, <MILESTONE N="50"/> that they might have continu'd it even to <HI>London;</HI> which would have produced wonderful Effects. But they quickly found that to be
<PB N="313" REF="3290"/>
impossible, and that both Horse and Foot grew so weary, that they must have rest: the weather was exceedingly hot; the march having been begun near the beginning of <HI>August;</HI> so that if they had not some rest before an Enemy approach'd them, how willing soever they might be, they could not be able to fight.</P>
<P>THERE was a small Garrison in <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> commanded by a Gen∣tleman, who, it was thought, might be prevail'd with to give it up to the King; but his Majesty sending to him, he return'd a rude denial: so <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sum∣mons</HI> Shrews∣bury <HI>in vain</HI></NOTE> that his Majesty's eye was upon <HI>Worcester;</HI> that was so little out of his way to <HI>London,</HI> that the going thither would not much retard the march, <MILESTONE N="10"/> if they found the Army able to continue it. <HI>Worcester</HI> had allways been a place very well affected in it self, and most of the Gentlemen of that County had been engaged for the King in the former War, and the City was the last that had surrender'd to the Parliament, of all those which had been Garrison'd for his Majesty; when all the Works were thrown down, and no Garrison from that time had been kept there; the Sheriff, and Ju∣stices, and Committees, having had power enough to defend it against any malignity of the Town, or County; and at this time, all the prin∣cipal Gentry of that County had been seiz'd upon, and were now Pri∣soners there. Thither the King came with his Army even assoon as they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to</HI> Worcester</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"/> had heard that he was in <HI>England:</HI> whereupon the Committee, and all those who were imploy'd by the Parliament, fled in all the confusion imaginable, leaving their Prisoners behind them, lest they themselves should become Prisoners to them; and the City open'd their Gates, and receiv'd the King, with all the demonstration of Affection and Duty that could be expressed; and made such provision for the Army, that it wanted nothing it could desire; the Mayor taking care for the pre∣sent provision of Shooes and Stockings, the want whereof, in so long a march, was very apparent and grievous. The principal Persons of the Country found themselves at liberty; and They, and the Mayor and al∣dermen, with all the solemnity they could prepare, attended the Herald, <MILESTONE N="30"/> who proclaim'd the King, as he had done, in more hast, and with less <NOTE PLACE="marg">Where he proclaim'd</NOTE> formality, in all those considerable Towns through which his Majesty had passed.</P>
<P>THE Army lik'd their Quarters here so well, that neither Officer, nor Soldier was in any degree willing to quit them, till they should be throughly refresh'd: and it could not be deny'd that the fatigue had been even insupportable; never had so many hundred Miles been march'd in so few days, and with so little rest; nor did it in truth appear reason∣able to any that they should remove from thence, since it was not pos∣sible that they should be able to reach <HI>London,</HI> though it had been bet∣ter <MILESTONE N="40"/> prepar'd for the King's reception than it appear'd to be, before <HI>Crom∣well</HI> would be there: who, having with great hast continu'd his march in a direct Line, was now as near to it as the King's Army was, and stood only at a gaze to be inform'd what his Majesty meant to do. <HI>Wor∣cester</HI> was a very good Post, seated allmost in the middle of the King∣dom, and in as fruitful a Country as any part of it; a good City, serv'd by the noble River of <HI>Severn</HI> from all the adjacent Counties; <HI>Wales</HI> be∣hind it, from whence Levies might be made of great Numbers of stout Men: it was a place where the King's friends might repair, if they had <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Affections they pretended to have; and it was a place where he might defend himself, if the Enemy would attack him, with many advantages, and could not be compell'd to engage his Army in a Battle, till <HI>Crom∣well</HI>
<PB N="314" REF="3300"/>
had gotten Men enough to encompass him on all sides: and then the King might choose on which side to fight, since the Enemy must be on both sides the River, and could not come suddainly to relieve each other, and the straitning the King to this degree would require much time; in which there might be an opportunity for several Insurrections in the Kingdom, if they were so weary of the present Tyranny, and so sollicitous to be restor'd to the King's Government, as they were con∣ceiv'd to be: for no body could ever hope for a more secure season to manifest their Loyalty, than when the King was in the heart of the King∣dom, with a form'd Army of about fifteen thousand Men, Horse, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> Foot (for so they might be accounted to be) with which he might re∣lieve those who were in danger to be oppressed by a more powerful party. These considerations produced the resolution to provide, in the best manner, to expect <HI>Cromwell</HI> there; and a hope that he might be delay'd by other diversions: and there was like to be time enough to cast up such Works upon the Hill before the Town, as might keep the Enemy at a distance, and their own Quarters from being suddainly streighten'd: all which were recommended to General <HI>Lesley</HI> to take care of, and to take such a perfect View of the Ground, that no advan∣tage might be lost when the time requir'd it.</P>
<P>THE first ill Omen that happen'd, was the News of the defeat of the <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The ill success of the Earl of</HI> Derby.</NOTE> Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> and the total destruction of those gallant Persons who accompanied him. The Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> within two or three days after he had left the King, with a Body of near two hundred Horse, all gal∣lant Men, imploy'd his Servants, and Tenants, to give the Country no∣tice of his staying behind the King, to head and command those Per∣sons who should repair to his service; which the quick march his Ma∣jesty made through the Country would not permit them to do. In ex∣pectation of a good appearance of the People, he went to a little Market Town, call'd <HI>Wigan,</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> where he stay'd that Night; when <MILESTONE N="30"/> in the morning a Regiment or two of the Militia of the neighbour Counties, and some other Troops of the Army, commanded by a Man of courage, whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> had sent to follow in the track of the King's march, to gather up the Straglers, and such as were not able to keep pace with the Army, having receiv'd some Advertisement that a Troop of the King's Horse were behind the Army in that Town, fell very early into it, before the Persons in the Town were out of their beds, having assurance, upon all the enquiry they could make, that there was no Ene∣my near them. Nor indeed was there any suspicion of those Forces, which consisted of the several Troops of the several Counties with others <MILESTONE N="40"/> of the Army, and passed that way by Accident. As many as could get to their Horses, presently mounted; they who could not, put them∣selves together on foot, and all endeavour'd to keep the Enemy from en∣tring into the Town; and the few who were got on Horseback, charged them with great courage. But the Number of the Enemy was too great, and the Town too open, to put a stop to them in any one place, when they could enter at so many, and encompass those who opposed them. The Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> after his Horse had been kill'd under him, made a shift to mount again; and so, with a small Party of Horse, through many difficulties and dangers, escaped wounded to the King to <HI>Wor∣cester.</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Withrington,</HI> after he had receiv'd many Wounds, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Wi∣thrington <HI>kill'd upon the place</HI></NOTE> given as many, and merited his death by the vengeance he took upon
<PB N="315" REF="3310"/>
those who assaulted him, was killed upon the place; and so was S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Tho∣mas Tildesley,</HI> and many other gallant Gentlemen, very few escaping to carry News of the defeat. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Throgmorton,</HI> who had been formerly Major General of the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle</HI>'s Army, and was left to command in the same function, receiv'd so many wounds, that he was looked upon as dead, and not fit to be carried away with the Pri∣soners; and so fell into such charitable and generous hands in the Town, that, being believ'd to be dead, he was afterwards so well recover'd, though with great maimes and loss of blood, that he at last got him∣self transported into <HI>Holland;</HI> where he was, at first appearance, taken <MILESTONE N="10"/> for a Ghost, all Men believing him to have been buried long before. Most of those who were taken Prisoners, of any Quality, were after∣wards sacrificed as a spectacle to the People, and barbarously put to death in several places; some, with the Earl of <HI>Derby;</HI> and others, near the same time, in other places.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Withrington</HI> was one of the most goodly Persons of that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Wi∣thrington<HI>'s Character.</HI></NOTE> Age, being near the head higher than most tall Men, and a Gentleman of the best and most ancient extraction of the County of <HI>Northumber∣land,</HI> and of a very fair Fortune, and one of the four which the last King made choice of to be about the Person of his Son the Prince as <MILESTONE N="20"/> Gentleman of his Privy Chamber, when he first settled his Family. His affection to the King was allways remarkable; and serving in the House of Commons as Knight of the Shire for the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> he quickly got the reputation of being amongst the most Malignant. Assoon as the War broke out, he was of the first who raised both Horse and Foot at his own Charge, and serv'd eminently with them under the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle;</HI> with whom he had a very particular and entire friendship. He was very nearly allied to the Marquis; and by his Testimony that he had perform'd many signal Services, he was, about the middle of the War, made a Peer of the Kingdom. He was a Man of great courage, but of some passion, by which he incurr'd the <MILESTONE N="30"/> ill Will of many, who imputed it to an insolence of Nature, which no Man was farther from; no Man of a Nature more civil, and candid towards all, in business, or conversation. But having sate long in the House of Commons, and observ'd the disingenuity of the proceedings there, and the gross cheats, by which they deceiv'd and consen'd the People, he had contracted so hearty an indignation against them, and all who were consen'd by them, and against all who had not his Zeal to oppose and destroy them, that he often said things to slow and flegma∣tick Men, which offended them, and, it may be, injured them; which <MILESTONE N="40"/> his good Nature often obliged him to acknowledge, and ask pardon of those who would not question him for it. He transported himself into the parts beyond the Sea at the same time with the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> to accompany him, and remain'd still with him till the King went into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and then waited upon his Majesty, and endured the same Affronts which others did, during the time of his Residence there. And, it may be, the observation of their behaviour, the know∣ledge of their Principles, and the disdain of their treatment, produced that aversion from their conversation, that prevailed upon his impa∣tience to part too soon from their Company, in hope that the Earl of <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>Derby,</HI> under whom he was very willing to serve, and he himself, might quickly draw together such a Body of the Royal Party, as might give some check to the unbounded imaginations of that Nation. It was
<PB N="316" REF="3320"/>
reported by the Enemy, that, in respect of his brave Person and beha∣viour, they did offer him Quarter; which he refused; and that they were thereby compelled, in their own defence, to kill him; which is probable enough; for he knew well the Animosity the Parliament had against him, and it cannot be doubted but that, if he had fallen into their hands, they would not have used him better than they did the Earl of <HI>Derby;</HI> who had not more Enemies.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Thomas Tildesly</HI> was a Gentleman of a good Family, and a good <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Tho∣mas Tildesly<HI>'s</HI></NOTE> Fortune; who had raised Men at his own Charge at the beginning of the War, and had serv'd in the Command of them till the very end of it, with great courage; and refusing to make any composition after the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Murther of the King, he found means to transport himself into <HI>Ireland</HI> to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> with whom he stayed, till he was, with the rest of the <HI>English</HI> Officers, dismissed, to satisfy the barbarous jea∣lousy of the <HI>Irish;</HI> and then got over into <HI>Scotland</HI> a little before the King marched from thence, and was desired by the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> to remain with him. The Names of the other Persons of Quality who were killed in that Encounter, and those who were taken Prisoners, and af∣terwards put to death, ought to be discover'd, and mention'd honoura∣bly, by any who shall propose to himself to communicate particularly <MILESTONE N="20"/> those Transactions to the view of Posterity.</P>
<P>WHEN the News of this Defeat came to <HI>Worcester,</HI> as it did even allmost assoon as the King came thither, it exceedingly afflicted his Ma∣jesty, and abated much of the hope he had of a general Rising of the People on his behalf. His Army was very little increased by the access of any <HI>English;</HI> and though he had passed near the habitation of many Persons of Honour and Quality, whose Affections and Loyalty had been eminent, not a Man of them repaired to him. The sense of their former Sufferings remain'd, and the smart was not over; nor did his stay in <HI>Worcester</HI> for so many days add any resort to his Court. The <MILESTONE N="30"/> Gentlemen of the Country whom his coming thither had redeem'd from imprisonment, remain'd still with him, and were useful to him; they who were in their Houses in the Country, though as well affected, re∣main'd there, and came not to him; and though Letters from <HI>London</HI> had given him cause to believe that many prepared to come to him, which for some days they might easily have done, none appear'd, except only some few Gentlemen, and some common Men who had formerly serv'd the last King, and repaired again to <HI>Worcester.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were some other Accidents and Observations which admi∣nister'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Transactions of the King at</HI> Worcester.</NOTE> matter of Mortification to the King. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> had a mind very restless, and thought he had not credit enough with the King, if it were not made manifest that he had more than any Body else: <Q>and therefore, assoon as the King had enter'd <HI>England,</HI> though he had reason to believe that his Majesty had not been abundantly satis∣fied with his behaviour in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he came to the King, and told him, “the business was now to reduce <HI>England</HI> to his obedience; and there∣fore he ought to do all things gracious, and popular in the eyes of the Nation; and nothing could be less so, than that the Army should be under the Command of a <HI>Scotish</HI> General: that <HI>David Lesley</HI> was only Lieutenant General; and it had been unreasonable, whilst he remain'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to have put any other to have commanded over him; <MILESTONE N="50"/> but that it would be as unreasonable, now they were in <HI>England,</HI> and had hope to increase the Army by the access of the <HI>English,</HI> upon
<PB N="317" REF="3330"/>
whom his principal dependence must be, to expect that they would be willing to serve under <HI>Lesley:</HI> that it would not consist with the honour of any Peer of <HI>England</HI> to receive His Orders; and, he believ'd, that very few of that Rank would repair to his Majesty, till they were” secure from that apprehension;</Q> and used much more discourse to that purpose. The King was so much surprised with it, that he could not imagine what he meant, and what the end of it would be; <Q>and asked him, “who it was that he thought fit his Majesty should give that Com∣mand to? when, to his astonishment, the Duke told him, he hoped” his Majesty would confer it upon himself.</Q> At which the King was so <MILESTONE N="10"/> amazed, that he found an occasion to break off the discourse, by calling upon some Body who was near, to come to him; and, by asking many questions, declined the former Argument. The Duke would not be so put off; but, the next day, in the march, renew'd his importunity; <Q>and told the King, “that, he was confident, what he had proposed to him, was so evidently for his Service, that <HI>David Lesley</HI> himself would” willingly consent to it.</Q> <Q>The King, angry at his prosecuting it in that manner, told him, “he could hardly believe that he was in earnest, or” that he could in truth believe that he could be fit for such a Charge;</Q> <Q>which the Duke seem'd to wonder at, and asked, “wherein his unfitness” <MILESTONE N="20"/> lay?</Q> <Q>to which the King replied, “”that he was too young:</Q> <Q>and he as readily alledged, “that <HI>Harry</HI> the fourth of <HI>France</HI> commanded an Ar∣my,” and won a Battle, when he was younger than He:</Q> <Q>so that, in the end, the King was compelled to tell him, “that he would have no” Generalissimo but Himself:</Q> upon which the Duke was so discontented, that he came no more to the Council, scarce spoke to the King, neglected every Body else and himself, insomuch as for many days he scarce put on clean Linen, nor conversed with any Body; nor did he recover this ill humour whilst the Army stayed at <HI>Worcester.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was another worse Accident fell out soon after the King's <MILESTONE N="30"/> coming thither: Major General <HI>Massey,</HI> who thought himself now in his own Territory, and that all between <HI>Worcester</HI> and <HI>Glocester</HI> would be quickly his own Conquest, knowing every step both by Land and the River, went out with a Party to secure a Pass, which the Enemy might make over the River; which he did very well; but would then make a farther in road into the Country, and possess a House which was of small importance, and in which there were Men to defend it; where he receiv'd a very dangerous Wound, that tore his Arme, and Hand, in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>General</HI> Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sey <HI>wounded in an attempt</HI></NOTE> such manner that he was in great torment, and could not stir out of his bed, in a time when his Activity and Industry was most wanted. By this means, the Pass he had secured, was either totally neglected, or <MILESTONE N="40"/> not enough taken care for.</P>
<P>THERE was no good understanding between the Officers of the Ar∣my: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill disposi∣tion of the King's Of∣ficers▪</NOTE> <HI>David Lesley</HI> appear'd dispirited, and confounded; gave, and re∣voked his Orders, and sometimes contradicted them. He did not love <HI>Middleton,</HI> and was very jealous that all the Officers lov'd him too well; who was indeed an excellent Officer, and kept up the Spirits of the rest, who had no esteem of <HI>Lesley.</HI> In this very unhappy distemper was the Court, and the Army, in a Season when they were ready to be swallow'd by the power, and multitude of the Enemy, and when nothing could preserve them, but the most sincere Unity in their prayers to <MILESTONE N="50"/> God, and a joynt concurrence in their counsels and endeavours; in all which they were miserably divided.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="3340"/>
THE King had been several days in <HI>Worcester,</HI> when <HI>Cromwell</HI> was known to be within less than half a day's march, with an addition of very many Regiments of Horse and Foot to those which he had brought with him from <HI>Scotland;</HI> and many other Regiments were drawing towards him of the Militia of the several Counties, under the command of the principal Gentlemen of their party in the Countries: so that he was already very much superior, if not double in Number to the Army the King had with him. However, if those Rules had been observ'd, those Works cast up, and that order in quartering their Men, as were resolv'd upon when the King came thither, there must have been a good defence made, and the Advantages of the ground, the River, and the <MILESTONE N="10"/> City, would have preserv'd them from being presently overrun. But, alas! the Army was in amazement and confusion. <HI>Cromwell,</HI> without troubling himself with the formality of a Siege, marched directly on as to a Prey, and possess'd the Hill and all other places of Advantage, with very little opposition. It was upon the third of <HI>September,</HI> when <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's de∣feat at</HI> Wor∣cester 3<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>of September.</HI></NOTE> the King having been upon his Horse most part of the Night, and having taken a full view of the Enemy, and every body being upon the Post they were appointed, and the Enemy making such a stand, that it was concluded he meant to make no Attempt then, and if he should, he might be repelled with ease; his Majesty, a little before noon, retired <MILESTONE N="20"/> to his Lodging to eat, and refresh himself: <Q>where he had not been near an hour, when the Alarm came, “”that both Armies were engaged;</Q> and though his Majesty's own Horse was ready at the door, and he presently mounted, before or assoon as he came out of the City, he met the whole Body of his Horse running in so great disorder, that he could not stop them, though he used all the means he could, and called to many Of∣ficers by their Names; and hardly preserv'd himself, by letting them pass by, from being overthrown, and overrun by them.</P>
<P>CROMWELL had used none of the delay, nor circumspection which was imagin'd; but directed the Troops to fall on in all places at once; <MILESTONE N="30"/> and had caused a strong Party to go over the River at the Pass, which <HI>Massey</HI> had formerly secured, at a good distance from the Town. And that being not at all guarded, they were never known to be on that side the River, till they were even ready to charge the King's Troops. On that part where <HI>Middleton</HI> was, and with whom Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> charged, there was a very brave resistance; and they charged the Ene∣my so vigorously, that they beat the Body that charged them back, but they were quickly overpower'd; and many Gentlemen being kill'd, and <HI>Middleton</HI> hurt, and Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Leg broke with a Shot, the rest were forced to retire and shift for themselves. In no other part was <MILESTONE N="40"/> there resistance made; but such a general consternation possessed the whole Army, that the rest of the Horse fled, and all the Foot threw down their Armes before they were charged. When the King came back into the Town, he found a good Body of Horse, which had been per∣swaded to make a stand, though much the major part passed through upon the Spur. <Q>The King desired those who stayed, “that they would follow him, that they might look upon the Enemy, who, he believ'd,” did not pursue them.</Q> But when his Majesty had gone a little way, he found most of the Horse were gone the other way, and that he had none but a few Servants of his own about him. Then he sent to have <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Gates of the Town shut, that none might get in one way, nor out the other: but all was confusion; there were few to command, and
<PB N="319" REF="3350"/>
none to obey: so that the King stay'd, till very many of the Enemy's Horse were enter'd the Town, and then he was perswaded to withdraw himself.</P>
<P>DUKE <HI>Hamilton</HI> fell into the Enemy's hands; and, the next day, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke</HI> Hamil∣ton <HI>died of his wounds.</HI></NOTE> died of his Wounds; and thereby prevented the being made a Spectacle, as his Brother had been; which the pride and animosity of his Enemies would no doubt have caused to be, having the same pretence for it by his being a Peer of <HI>England,</HI> as the other was. He was in all respects to <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character</NOTE> be much preferr'd before the other, a much wiser, though, it may be, a less cunning Man: for he did not affect dissimulation, which was the <MILESTONE N="10"/> other's Master-piece. He had unquestionable courage: he was in truth a very accomplish'd Person, of an excellent Judgement, and clear and ready Expressions: and though he had been driven into some unwar∣rantable Actions, he made it very evident he had not been led by any Inclinations of his own, and passionately and heartily run to all oppor∣tunities of redeeming it: <Q>and, in the very Article of his death, he ex∣pressed a marvellous chearfulness, “that he had the honour to lose his life in the King's Service, and thereby to wipe out the memory of” his former transgressions;</Q> which he allways professed were odious to himself.</P>
<P>AS the Victory cost the Enemy little blood, so after it there was not <MILESTONE N="20"/> much cruelty used to the Prisoners who were taken upon the spot. But very many of those who run away, were every day knock'd in the head by the Country People, and used with barbarity. Towards the King's menial Servants, whereof most were taken, there was nothing of severity; but within few days they were all discharged, and set at liberty.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King could not get a Body of Horse to fight, he could <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Re∣treat, and con∣cealment.</NOTE> have too many to fly with him; and he had not been many hours from <HI>Worcester,</HI> when he found about him near, if not above four thousand of his Horse. There was <HI>David Lesley</HI> with all his own Equipage, as <MILESTONE N="30"/> if he had not fled upon the suddain; so that good order, and regularity, and obedience, might yet have made a retreat even into <HI>Scotland</HI> it self. But there was paleness in every Man's looks, and jealousy, and confu∣sion, in their faces; and scarce any thing could worse befal the King, than a return into <HI>Scotland;</HI> which yet he could not reasonably pro∣mise to himself in that company. But when the night cover'd them, he found means to withdraw himself with one or two of his own Ser∣vants; whom he likewise discharged, when it begun to be light; and after he had made them cut off his hair, he betook himself alone into an <MILESTONE N="40"/> adjacent Wood, and relied only upon Him for his preservation who alone could, and did Miraculously deliver him.</P>
<P>WHEN it was morning, and the Troops, which had march'd all Night, and who knew that when it begun to be dark the King was with them, found now that he was not there, they cared less for each others com∣pany; and most of them who were <HI>English</HI> separated themselves, and went into other Roads; and wherever twenty Horse appear'd of the Country, which was now awake, and upon their Guard to stop and ar∣rest the runaways, the whole Body of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Horse would fly, and run several ways; and twenty of them would give themselves Prisoners to two Country fellows: however, <HI>David Lesley</HI> reach'd <HI>Yorkshire</HI> with <MILESTONE N="50"/> above fifteen hundred Horse in a Body. But the jealousies increas'd every day; and those of his own Country were so unsatisfied with his whole
<PB N="320" REF="3360"/>
conduct and behaviour, that they did, that is many of them, believe that he was corrupted by <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and the rest, who did not think so, believ'd him not to understand his profession, in which he had been bred from his Cradle. When he was in his flight, considering one mor∣ning with the principal Persons, which way they should take, some proposed this, and others that way; <Q>S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Armorer</HI> ask'd him, “which way he thought best? which when he had named, the other said he would then go the other; for, he swore, he had betray'd the King” and the Army all the time;</Q> and so left him.</P>
<P>WELL nigh all of them in this long flight were taken, and amongst <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">David Lesley <HI>and the rest taken.</HI></NOTE> them the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and many of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Nobility, and the Earls of <HI>Cleveland</HI> and <HI>Derby,</HI> and divers other Men of Quality of the <HI>English</HI> Nation. And it is hard to be believ'd how very few of that nu∣merous Body of Horse (for there can be no imagination that any of the Foot escap'd) return'd into <HI>Scotland.</HI> Upon all the enquiry that was made, when most of the false and treacherous Actions which had been committed were discover'd, there appear'd no cause to suspect that <HI>David Lesley</HI> had been unfaithful in his Charge: though he never recover'd any reputation with those of his own Country who wedded the King's In∣terest. And it was some vindication to him, that, from the time of his im∣prisonment, <MILESTONE N="20"/> he never receiv'd any favour from the Parliament, whom he had serv'd so long; nor from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> in whose Company he had serv'd; but underwent all the Severities, and long imprisonment, the rest of his Country-men suffer'd. The King did not believe him false; and did all∣ways think him an excellent Officer of Horse, to distribute and execute Orders, but in no degree capable of commanding in chief. And without doubt he was so amaz'd in that fatal day, that he perform'd not the Office of a General, or of any competent Officer.</P>
<P>THEY who fled out of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and were not kill'd, but made Pri∣soners, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Foot driven Prisoners to</HI> London, <HI>and sold to the Plantations.</HI></NOTE> and all the Foot, and others who were taken in the Town, ex∣cept some few Officers and Persons of Quality, were driven like Cattle <MILESTONE N="30"/> with a Guard to <HI>London,</HI> and there treated with great rigour; and many perish'd for want of food; and being inclosed in little room, till they were sold to the Plantations for Slaves, they died of all diseases. <HI>Crom∣well</HI> return'd in Triumph; was receiv'd with universal joy and accla∣mation, as if he had destroy'd the Enemy of the Nation, and for ever secured the Liberty, and Happiness of the People: a price was set upon the King's head, whose escape was thought to be impossible; and order taken for the Trial of the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> and such other notorious Pri∣soners as they had voted to destruction. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> was a Man of unquestionable Loyalty to the late <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Derby <HI>his Character and Execution.</HI></NOTE> King, and gave clear testimony of it before he receiv'd any obligations from the Court, and when he thought himself disobliged by it. This King, in his first year, sent him the Garter; which, in many respects, he had expected from the last. And the sense of that Honour made him so readily comply with the King's Command in attending him, when he had no confidence in the Undertaking, nor any inclination to the <HI>Scots;</HI> who, he thought, had too much guilt upon them, in having de∣pressed the Crown, to be made Instruments of repairing and restoring it. He was a Man of great honour and clear courage; and all his de∣fects, and misfortunes, proceeded from his having liv'd so little time <MILESTONE N="50"/> among his equals, that he knew not how to treat his Inferiors; which was the source of all the ill that befell him, having thereby drawn such
<PB N="321" REF="3370"/>
prejudice against him from Persons of inferior Quality, who yet thought themselves too good to be contemn'd, that they pursued him to death. The King's Army was no sooner defeated at <HI>Worcester,</HI> but the Parlia∣ment renew'd their old Method of murthering in cold blood, and sent a Commission to erect a High Court of Justice to Persons of ordinary Qua∣lity, many not being Gentlemen, and all notoriously his Enemies, to try the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> for his Treason and Rebellion; which they easily found him guilty of; and put him to death in a Town of his own, against which he had expressed a severe displeasure for their obstinate Rebellion against the King, with all the circumstances of rudeness and barbarity <MILESTONE N="10"/> they could invent. <Q>The same Night, one of those who was amongst his Judges, sent a Trumpet to the Isle of <HI>Man</HI> with a Letter directed to the Countess of <HI>Derby,</HI> by which he requir'd her “to deliver up the” Castle and Island to the Parliament:</Q> Nor did their malice abate, till they had reduced that Lady, a Woman of very high and Princely ex∣traction, being the Daughter of the Duke <HI>de Trimouille</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and of the most exemplary Virtue and Piety of her time, and that whole most noble Family, to the lowest penury and want, by disposing, giving, and selling, all the fortune and estate that should support it.</P>
<P>THEY of the King's friends in <HI>Flanders, France,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="20"/> had not been permitted to attend upon his Majesty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> were much exalted with the News of his being enter'd <HI>England</HI> with a power∣ful Army, and being possessed of <HI>Worcester,</HI> which made all Men pre∣pare to make hast thither. <Q>But they were confounded with the News of that fatal day, and more confounded with the various reports of the Person of the King, “of his being found amongst the dead; of his being” Prisoner;</Q> and all those imaginations which naturally attend upon such unprosperous events. Many who had made escapes, arriv'd every day in <HI>France, Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> but knew no more what was be∣come of the King, than They did who had not been in <HI>England.</HI> The only comfort that any of them brought, was, that he was amongst those <MILESTONE N="30"/> that fled, and some of them had seen him that evening after the Battle, many miles out of <HI>Worcester.</HI> These unsteady degrees of hope and fear tormented them very long; sometimes they heard he was at the <HI>Hague</HI> with his Sister, which was occasion'd by the arrival of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in <HI>Holland;</HI> and it was thought good Policy to publish that the King himself was landed, that the Search after him in <HI>England</HI> might be discontinued. But it was quickly known that he was not there, nor in any place on that side the Sea. And this anxiety of mind dis∣quieted the hearts of all honest Men during the whole Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> and part of <HI>November;</HI> in which Month his <MILESTONE N="40"/> Majesty was known to be at <HI>Roan;</HI> where he made himself known, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King came to</HI> Roa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>in</HI> November</NOTE> stay'd some days to provide Cloaths; and from thence gave notice to the Queen of his Arrival.</P>

during the War, and had now been one of the few who resorted to the King after his coming to <HI>Worcester.</HI> His name was <HI>Careless,</HI> who had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King meets</HI> Captain Careless <HI>in a Wood, who per∣swades him to get up into an Oak</HI></NOTE> had a Command of Foot, about the degree of a Captain, under the Lord <HI>Loughborough.</HI> He perswaded the King, since it could not be safe for him to go out of the Wood, and that, assoon as it should be fully light, the Wood it self would probably be visited by those of the Country, who would be searching to find those whom they might make Prisoners, that he would get up into that Tree, where He had been; where the Boughs were so thick with leaves, that a Man would not be discover'd there without a narrower Enquiry than People usually make in places which <MILESTONE N="10"/> they do not suspect. The King thought it good Counsel; and, with the other's help, climb'd into the Tree; and then help'd his Companion to ascend after him; where they sate all that day, and securely saw Many who came purposely into the Wood to look after them, and heard all their discourse, how they would use the King himself if they could take him. This Wood was either in, or upon the Borders of <HI>Staffordshire;</HI> and though there was a high-way near one side of it, where the King had enter'd into it, yet it was large, and all other sides of it open'd amongst Inclosures, and <HI>Careless</HI> was not unacquainted with the Neigh∣bour Villages, and it was part of the King's good fortune, that this Gen∣tleman <MILESTONE N="20"/> by being a Roman Catholick, was acquainted with those of that profession of all degrees, who had the best opportunities of concealing him: for it must never be denied, that some of that Religion had a very great share in his Majesty's preservation.</P>
<P>THE day being spent in the Tree, it was not in the King's power to forget that he had liv'd two days with eating very little, and two Nights with as little sleep; so that, when the night came, he was willing to make some provision for both: and he resolv'd, with the advice and assistance of his Companion, to leave his blessed Tree; and, when the Night was dark, they walk'd through the Wood into those Inclosures <MILESTONE N="30"/> which were farthest from any high-way, and making a shift to get over Hedges and Ditches, after walking at least eight or nine Miles, which were the more grievous to the King by the weight of his Boots (for he could not put them off, when he cut off his hair, for want of Shooes) before morning they came to a poor Cottage, the Owner whereof being <NOTE PLACE="marg">Then the came to a Cottage nine miles off, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a Barn.</NOTE> a Roman Catholick was known to <HI>Careless.</HI> He was call'd up, and assoon as he knew one of them, he easily concluded in what condition they both were; and presently carried them into a little Barn, full of hay; which was a better lodging than he had for himself. But when they were there, and had conferr'd with their Host of the news and temper of <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Country, it was agreed, that the danger would be the greater if they stay'd together; and therefore that <HI>Careless</HI> should presently be gone; and should, within two days, send an honest Man to the King, to guide him to some other place of security; and in the mean time his Majesty should stay upon the Hay-mow. The poor Man had nothing for him to eat, but promised him good Butter-milk; and so he was once more left alone, his Companion, how weary soever, departing from him before day, the poor Man of the House knowing no more, than that he was a friend of the Captain's, and one of those who had escaped from <HI>Wor∣cester.</HI> The King slept very well in his lodging, till the time that his <MILESTONE N="50"/> Host brought him a piece of Bread, and a great Pot of Butter-milk, which he thought the best food he ever had eaten. The poor Man spoke very intelligently to him of the Country, and of the People who were well,
<PB N="323" REF="3390"/>
or ill affected to the King, and of the great fear, and terror, that possess'd the hearts of those who were best affected. <Q>He told him, “that he him∣self liv'd by his daily Labour, and that what he had brought him was the sare he and his Wife had; and that he feared, if he should endea∣vour to procure better, it might draw suspicion upon him, and Peo∣ple might be apt to think he had some body with him that was not of his own Family. However, if he would have him get some Meat, he would do it; but if he could bear this hard diet, he should have enough” of the Milk, and some of the Butter that was made with it.</Q> The King was satisfied with his reason, and would not run the hazard for a change <MILESTONE N="10"/> of diet; <Q>desired only the Man, “that he might have his Company as” often, and as much as he could give it him;</Q> there being the same reason against the poor Man's discontinuing his labour, as the alteration of his fare.</P>
<P>AFTER he had rested upon this Hay-mow, and fed upon this diet two days and two nights, in the evening before the third night, an∣other fellow, a little above the condition of his Host, came to the House, sent from <HI>Careless,</HI> to conduct the King to another House, more out <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence he is conducted to another House</HI> 12 <HI>miles off:</HI></NOTE> of any Road near which any part of the Army was like to march. It was above twelve Miles that he was to go, and was to use the same cau∣tion he had done the first night, not to go in any common Road; which <MILESTONE N="20"/> his Guide knew well how to avoid. Here he new dressed himself, chang∣ing Cloaths with his Landlord; he had a great mind to have kept his own Shirt, but he consider'd, that Men are not sooner discover'd by any mark in disguises, than by having fine Linen in ill Cloaths; and so he parted with his Shirt too, and took the same his poor Host had then on. Though he had foreseen that he must leave his Boots, and his Land∣lord had taken the best care he could to provide an old pair of Shooes, yet they were not easy to him when he first put them on, and, in a short time after, grew very grievous to him. In this Equipage he set out from his first Lodging in the beginning of the night, under the conduct <MILESTONE N="30"/> of this Guide; who guided him the nearest way, crossing over Hedges and Ditches, that they might be in least danger of meeting passengers. This was so grievous a march, and he was so tired, that he was even ready to despair, and to prefer being taken and suffer'd to rest, before purchasing his safety at that price. His Shooes had, after a few miles, hurt him so much, that he had thrown them away, and walked the rest of the way in his ill Stockings, which were quickly worne out; and his Feet, with the Thorns in getting over Hedges, and with the Stones in other places, were so hurt and wounded, that he many times cast himself upon the ground, with a desperate and obstinate resolution to <MILESTONE N="40"/> rest there till the morning, that he might shift with less torment, what hazard soever he run. But his stout Guide still prevailed with him to make a new attempt, sometimes promising that the way should be bet∣ter, and sometimes assuring him that he had but little farther to go: and in this distress and perplexity, before the morning, they arriv'd at the House design'd; which though it was better than that which he had left, his lodging was still in the Barn, upon Straw instead of Hay, a place being made as easy in it, as the expectation of a Guest could dispose it. Here he had such Meat and Porridge as such People use to have; with which, but especially with the Butter and the Cheese, he thought <MILESTONE N="50"/> himself well feasted; and took the best care he could to be supplied with other, little better, Shooes and Stockings: and after his Feet were enough
<PB N="324" REF="3400"/>
recover'd that he could go, he was conducted from thence to another <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence to an∣other; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o to others</NOTE> poor House, within such a distance as put him not to much trouble: for having not yet in his thought which way, or by what means to make his escape, all that was design'd was only by shifting from one House to another, to avoid discovery. And being now in that Quarter, which was more inhabited by the Roman Catholicks than most other parts in <HI>England,</HI> he was led from one to another of that perswasion, and con∣cealed with great fidelity. But he then observ'd that he was never carried to any Gentleman's House, though that Country was full of them, but only to poor Houses of poor Men, which only yielded him rest with very unpleasant sustenance; whether there was more danger in those <MILESTONE N="10"/> better Houses, in regard of the resort, and the many Servants; or whe∣ther the Owners of great Estates, were the Owners likewise of more fears and apprehensions.</P>
<P>WITHIN few days, a very honest and discreet Person, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hud∣leston,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Hudleston <HI>sent to him by</HI> Careless; <HI>who brought him to the Lord</HI> Wilmot</NOTE> a Benedictine Monk, who attended the Service of the Roman Catholicks in those parts, came to him, sent by <HI>Careless;</HI> and was a very great assistance and comfort to him. And when the places to which he carried him, were at too great a distance to walk, he provided him a Horse, and more proper Habit than the Rags he wore. <Q>This Man told him, “that the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> lay concealed likewise in a Friend's <MILESTONE N="20"/> House of his; which his Majesty was very glad of; and wished him” to contrive some means, how they might speak together;</Q> which the other easily did; and, within a night or two, brought them into one place. <Q><HI>Wilmot</HI> told the King “that he had, by very good fortune, fallen into the House of an honest Gentleman, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lane,</HI> a Person of an excellent reputation for his fidelity to the King, but of so universal and general a good Name, that, though he had a Son, who had been a Colonel in the King's Service, during the late War, and was then upon his way with Men to <HI>Worcester</HI> the very day of the defeat, Men of all Affections in the Country, and of all opinions, paid the old Man <MILESTONE N="30"/> a very great respect: that he had been very civilly treated there, and that the old Gentleman had used some diligence to find out where the King was, that he might get him to his House; where, he was sure,” he could conceal him till he might contrive a full deliverance.</Q> <Q>He told him, “he had withdrawn from that House, in hope that he might, in some other place, discover where his Majesty was, and having now happily found him, advised him to repair to that House, which stood” not near any other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King enquired of the Monk of the reputation of this Gentle∣man; who told him, “that he had a fair Estate; was exceedingly be∣lov'd; <MILESTONE N="40"/> and the eldest Justice of Peace of that County of <HI>Stafford;</HI> and though he was a very zealous Protestant, yet he liv'd with so much civility and candour towards the Catholicks, that they would all trust him, as much as they would do any of their own profession; and that he could not think of any place of so good repose and security for his” Majesty's repair to.</Q> The King liked the Proposition, yet thought not sit to surprise the Gentleman; but sent <HI>Wilmot</HI> thither again, to assure himself that he might be receiv'd there; and was willing that he should know what Guest he receiv'd; which hitherto was so much concealed, <MILESTONE N="50"/> that none of the Houses where he had yet been, knew, or seem'd to sus∣pect more than that he was one of the King's Party that fled from <HI>Wor∣cester.</HI> The Monk carried him to a House at a reasonable distance,
<PB N="325" REF="3410"/>
where he was to expect an Account from the Lord <HI>Wilmot;</HI> who re∣turn'd very punctually, with as much assurance of welcome as he could wish. And so they two went together to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lane</HI>'s House; where the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him to M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Lane<HI>'s House</HI></NOTE> King found he was welcome, and conveniently accommodated in such places, as in a large House had been provided to conceal the Persons of Malignants, or to preserve goods of value from being plunder'd. Here he lodged, and eat very well; and begun to hope that he was in present safety. <HI>Wilmot</HI> return'd under the care of the Monk, and expected Summons, when any farther motion should be thought to be necessary.</P>
<P>IN this Station the King remain'd in quiet and blessed security many <MILESTONE N="1"/> days, receiving every day information of the general consternation the Kingdom was in, out of the apprehension that his Person might fall into the hands of his Enemies, and of the great diligence they used to enquire for him. He saw the Proclamation that was issued out and printed; in which a thousand pounds were promised to any Man who would deliver and discover the Person of <HI>Charles Stuart,</HI> and the pe∣nalty of High Treason declared against those who presumed to harbour or conceal him: by which he saw how much he was beholding to all those who were faithful to him. It was now time to consider how he might get near the Sea, from whence he might find some means to <MILESTONE N="2"/> transport himself: and he was now near the middle of the Kingdom, saving that it was a little more Northward, where he was utterly un∣acquainted with all the Ports, and with that Coast. In the West he was best acquainted, and that Coast was most proper to transport him into <HI>France;</HI> to which he was inclined. Upon this matter he communicated with those of this Family to whom he was known, that is, with the old Gentleman the Father, a very grave and venerable Person, the Co∣lonel his Eldest Son, a very plain Man in his discourse and behaviour, but of a fearless Courage, and an integrity superior to any temptation, and a Daughter of the House, of a very good wit and discretion, and <MILESTONE N="3"/> very fit to bear any part in such a Trust. It was a benefit, as well as an inconvenience, in those unhappy times, that the Affections of all Men were allmost as well known as their faces, by the discovery they had made of themselves, in those sad Seasons, in many trials and Persecu∣tions: so that Men knew not only the minds of their next Neighbours, and those who inhabited near them, but, upon conference with their Friends, could choose fit Houses, at any distance, to repose themselves in security, from one end of the Kingdom to another, without trusting the Hospitality of a common Inn: and Men were very rarely deceiv'd in their confidence upon such occasions, but the Persons with whom they were at any time, could conduct them to another House of the <MILESTONE N="4"/> same Affection.</P>
<P>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> LANE had a Niece, or very near Kinswoman, who was married to a Gentleman, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Norton,</HI> a Person of eight or nine hundred pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> who liv'd within four or five Miles of <HI>Bristol,</HI> which was at least four or five days journey from the place where the King then was, but a place most to be wish'd for the King to be in, be∣cause he did not only know all that Country very well, but knew many Persons also, to whom, in an extraordinary case, he durst make him∣self known. It was hereupon resolv'd, that M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Lane</HI> should visit this <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Here it was resolv'd the King should go to M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Nor∣ton<HI>'s, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding before M<SUP>•</SUP></HI> Lane</NOTE> Cousin, who was known to be of good affections: and that she should ride behind the King; who was fitted with Cloaths and Boots for such a Service; and that a Servant of her Father's, in his Livery, should
<PB N="326" REF="3420"/>
wait upon her. A good House was easily pitch'd upon for the first night's Lodging; where <HI>Wilmot</HI> had notice given him to meet. And in this Equipage the King begun his journey; the Colonel keeping him Com∣pany at a distance, with a Hawk upon his fist, and two or three Spaniels; which, where there were any Fields at hand, warranted him to ride out of the way, keeping his Company still in his eye, and not seeming to be of it. In this manner they came to their first night's Lodging; and they need not now Contrive to come to their journey's end about the close of the evening, for it was in the Month of <HI>October</HI> far ad∣vanced, that the long journies they made could not be dispatch'd sooner. <MILESTONE N="10"/> Here the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> found them; and their journies being then ad∣justed, he was instructed where he should be every night: so they were seldom seen together in the journey, and rarely lodged in the same House at night. In this manner the Colonel hawked two or three days, till he had brought them within less than a day's journey of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Norton</HI>'s House; and then he gave his Hawk to the Lord <HI>Wilmot;</HI> who con∣tinued the journey in the same Exercise.</P>
<P>THERE was great care taken when they came to any House, that the King might be presently carried into some Chamber; <Q>M<SUP>rs</SUP> <HI>Lane</HI> declaring “that he was a Neighbour's Son, whom his Father had lent <MILESTONE N="20"/> her to ride before her, in hope that he would the sooner recover from a Quartan Ague, with which he had been miserably afflicted, and was” not yet free.</Q> And by this Artifice she caused a good bed to be still provided for him, and the best meat to be sent; which she often carried her self, to hinder others from doing it. There was no resting in any place till they came to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Norton</HI>'s, nor any thing extraordinary that happen'd in the way, save that they met many People every day in the way, who were very well known to the King; and the day that they went to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Norton</HI>'s, they were necessarily to ride quite through the City of <HI>Bristol;</HI> a place, and People, the King had been so well ac∣quainted <MILESTONE N="30"/> with, that he could not but send his eyes abroad to view the great alterations which had been made there, after his departure from thence: and when he rode near the place where the great Fort had stood, he could not forbear putting his Horse out of the way, and rode with his Mistress behind him round about it.</P>
<P>THEY came to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Norton</HI>'s House sooner than usual, and it being <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They came safe to M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Nor∣ton<HI>'s through</HI> Bristol.</NOTE> on a Holy-day, they saw many People about a bowling-Green that was before the door, and the first Man the King saw was a Chaplain of his own, who was ally'd to the Gentleman of the House, and was sitting upon the rails to see how the Bowlers play'd. <HI>William,</HI> by which name <MILESTONE N="40"/> the King went, walk'd with his Horse into the Stable, until his Mistress could provide for his retreat. M<SUP>rs</SUP> <HI>Lane</HI> was very welcome to her Cou∣sin, and was presently conducted to her Chamber; <Q>where she no sooner was, than she lamented the condition of “a good Youth, who came with her, and whom she had borrow'd of his Father to ride before her,” who was very sick, being newly recover'd of an Ague;</Q> <Q>and desired her Cousin, “that a Chamber might be provided for him, and a good fire made: for that he would go early to bed, and was not fit to be below” stairs.</Q> A pretty little Chamber was presently made ready, and a fire prepared, and a Boy sent into the stable to call <HI>William,</HI> and to shew <MILESTONE N="50"/> him his Chamber; who was very glad to be there, freed from so much Company as was below. M<SUP>rs</SUP> <HI>Lane</HI> was put to find some excuse for making a visit at that time of the year, and so many days journey from
<PB N="327" REF="3430"/>
her Father, and where she had never been before, though the Mistress of the house and she had been bred together, and friends as well as kindred. <Q>She pretended “that she was, after a little rest, to go into” <HI>Dorsetshire</HI> to another friend.</Q> <Q>When it was supper time, there being Broath brought to the Table, M<SUP>rs</SUP> <HI>Lane</HI> fill'd a little dish, and desired the Butler, who waited at the Table, “to carry that dish, of Porridge to <HI>William,</HI> and to tell him that he should have some Meat sent to him” presently.</Q> The Butler carried the Porridge into the Chamber with a Napkin, and Spoon, and Bread, and spoke kindly to the young Man; who was willing to be eating. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P><Q>THE Butler looking narrowly upon him, fell upon his Knees, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King is known to the Butler of the House.</NOTE> with tears told him, “he was glad to see his Majesty. The King was infinitely surprised, yet recollected himself enough to laugh at the Man, and to ask him” what he meant?</Q> The Man had been Falconer to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Tho∣mas Jermyn,</HI> and made it appear that he knew well enough to whom he spoke, repeating some particulars, which the King had not forgot. <Q>Whereupon the King conjured him “not to speak of what he knew, so” much as to his Master, though he believ'd him a very honest Man.</Q> The Fellow promised, and kept his word; and the King was the better waited upon during the time of his abode there. <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P><Q>D<SUP>r</SUP> GORGES, the King's Chaplain, being a Gentleman of a good fa∣mily near that place, and allied to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Norton,</HI> supped with them, and being a Man of a chearful Conversation, ask'd M<SUP>rs</SUP> <HI>Lane</HI> many questions concerning <HI>William,</HI> of whom he saw she was so careful by sending up Meat to him, “how long his Ague had been gone? and whether he had” purged since it left him? and the like;</Q> to which she gave such An∣swers as occurr'd. The Doctor, from the final prevalence of the Par∣liament, had, as many others of that function had done, declined his Profession, and pretended to study Physick. Assoon as Supper was done, out of good Nature, and without telling any Body, he went to see <HI>William.</HI> The King saw him coming into the Chamber, and withdrew to the in∣side <MILESTONE N="30"/> of the bed, that he might be farthest from the Candle, and the Doctor came, and sate down by him, felt his pulse, and ask'd him many que∣stions, which he answer'd in as few words as was possible, and expressing great inclination to go to his bed; <Q>to which the Doctor left him, and went to M<SUP>rs</SUP> <HI>Lane,</HI> and told her, “that he had been with <HI>William,</HI> and” that he would do well;</Q> and advised her, what she should do if his Ague return'd. The next morning, the Doctor went away, so that the King saw him no more. The next day the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> came to the House with his Hawk, to see M<SUP>rs</SUP> <HI>Lane,</HI> and so conferr'd with <HI>William;</HI> who was to consider what he was to do. They thought it necessary to rest <MILESTONE N="40"/> some days, till they were inform'd what Port lay most convenient for them, and what Person liv'd nearest to it, upon whose fidelity they might rely: and the King gave him directions to enquire after some Persons, and some other particulars, of which when he should be fully instructed, he should return again to him. In the mean time, <HI>Wilmot</HI> lodged at a House not far from M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Norton</HI>'s, to which he had been re∣commended.</P>
<P>AFTER some days stay here, and communication between the King and the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> by Letters, the King came to know that Colonel <HI>Francis Windham</HI> liv'd within little more than a days Journey of the place where he was; of which he was very glad; for besides the inclina∣tion he had to his elder Brother, whose Wife had been his Nurse, this
<PB N="328" REF="3440"/>
Gentleman had behaved himself very well during the War, and had been Governour of <HI>Dunstar</HI> Castle, where the King had lodged when he was in the West. After the end of the War, and when all other places were surrender'd in that County, He likewise surrender'd That, upon fair Conditions, and made his Peace, and afterwards married a Wife with a competent Fortune, and liv'd quietly, without any suspi∣cion of having lessen'd his affection towards the King.</P>
<P><Q>THE King sent <HI>Wilmot</HI> to him, and acquainted him where he was, and “”that he would gladly speak with him.</Q> It was not hard for him to choose a good place where to meet, and thereupon the day was appointed. After the King had taken his leave of M<SUP>rs</SUP> <HI>Lane,</HI> who remain'd with her <MILESTONE N="10"/> Cousin <HI>Norton,</HI> the King, and the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> met the Colonel; and, in the way, he met in a Town, through which they passed, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Kirton,</HI> a Servant of the King's, who well knew the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who had no other disguise than the Hawk, but took no Notice of him, nor suspected the King to be there; yet that day made the King more wary of having him in his Company upon the Way. At the place of meeting, they rested only one night, and then the King went to the Colonel's House; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes to Colonel</HI> Francis Wind∣ham<HI>'s House.</HI></NOTE> where he rested many days, whilst the Colonel projected at what place the King might embark, and how they might procure a Vessel to be ready there; which was not easy to find; there being so great a fear possessing <MILESTONE N="20"/> those who were honest, that it was hard to procure any Vessel that was outward bound to take in any passenger.</P>
<P>THERE was a Gentleman, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ellison,</HI> who liv'd near <HI>Lyme</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> and was well known to Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> having been a Captain in the King's Army, and was still looked upon as a very honest Man. With him the Colonel consulted, how they might get a Vessel to be ready to take in a couple of Gentlemen, friends of his, who were in danger to be arrested, and transport them into <HI>France.</HI> Though no Man would ask who the Persons were, yet it could not but be suspected who they were, at least they concluded, that it was some of <HI>Worcester</HI> Party. <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Lyme</HI> was generally as malicious and disaffected a Town to the King's Interest, as any Town in <HI>England</HI> could be: yet there was in it a Master of a Bark, of whose honesty this Captain was very confident. <Q>This Man was lately return'd from <HI>France,</HI> and had unladen his Vessel, when <HI>El∣lison</HI> asked him, “when he would make another Voyage? and he an∣swer'd,” assoon as he could get Lading for his Ship.</Q> <Q>The other asked, “whether he would undertake to carry over a couple of Gentlemen, and land them in <HI>France,</HI> if he might be as well paid for his Voyage as” he used to be when he was fraighted by the Merchants.</Q> <Q>In conclusion, he told him, “he should receive fifty pounds for his fare: the large re∣compence <MILESTONE N="40"/> had that effect, that the Man undertook it; though he said he must make his provision very secretly; for that he might be well suspected for going to Sea again without being fraighted, after he was” so newly return'd.</Q> Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> being advertised of this, came together with the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> to the Captain's House, from whence the Lord and the Captain rid to a House near <HI>Lyme;</HI> where the Master of the Bark met them; and the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> being satisfied with the discourse of the Man, and his wariness in foreseeing Suspicions, which would arise, it was resolv'd that on such a night, which, upon considera∣tion <MILESTONE N="50"/> of the Tydes, was agreed upon, the Man should draw out his Vessel from the Peer, and, being at Sea, should come to such a point about a Mile from the Town, where his Ship should remain upon the Beach
<PB N="329" REF="3450"/>
when the Water was gone; which would take it off again about break of day the next morning. There was very near that point, even in the view of it, a small Inn, kept by a Man who was reputed honest, to which the Cavaliers of the Country often resorted; and <HI>London</HI> road passed that way; so that it was seldom without Company. Into that Inn the two Gentlemen were to come in the beginning of the night, that they might put themselves on board. All things being thus con∣certed, and good earnest given to the Master, the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> and the Colonel return'd to the Colonel's house, above a day's journey from the place, the Captain undertaking every day to look that the Master should <MILESTONE N="10"/> provide, and, if any thing fell out contrary to expectation, to give the Colonel notice at such a place, where they intended the King should be the day before he was to embark.</P>
<P>THE King, being satisfied with these preparations, came, at the time <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e He is brought to an Inn near</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e; <HI>and a Ship hired by Captain</HI> Elli∣son.</NOTE> appointed, to that House where he was to hear that all went as it ought to do; of which he receiv'd assurance from the Captain; who sound that the Man had honestly put his Provisions on Board, and had his Com∣pany ready, which were but four Men; and that the Vessel should be drawn out that night: so that it was fit for the two Persons to come <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the aforesaid Inn, and the Captain conducted them within sight of it; and then went to his own House, not distant a mile from it; the Colo∣nel <MILESTONE N="20"/> remaining still at the House where they had lodged the night before, till he might hear the news of their being embark'd.</P>
<P>THEY found many Passengers in the Inn; and so were to be con∣tented <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ship fail'd by an accident; and the King left the Inn.</NOTE> with an ordinary Chamber, which they did not intend to sleep long in. But assoon as there appear'd any light, <HI>Wilmot</HI> went out to discover the Bark, of which there was no appearance. In a word, the Sun arose, and nothing like a Ship in view. They sent to the Captain, who was as much amaz'd; and He sent to the Town; and his Servant could not find the Master of the Bark, which was still in the Peer. They suspected the Captain, and the Captain suspected the Master. <MILESTONE N="30"/> However, it being past ten of the Clock, they concluded it was not fit for them to stay longer there, and so they mounted their Horses again to return to the House where they had left the Colonel, who, they knew, resolv'd to stay there till he were assur'd that they were gone.</P>
<P>THE truth of the disappointment was this; the Man meant honestly, and made all things ready for his departure; and the night he was to go out with his Vessel, he had stay'd in his own House, and slept two or three hours, and the time of the Tide being come, that it was necessary to be on board, he took out of a Cupboard some Linen, and other things, which he used to carry with him to Sea. His Wife had observ'd, that <MILESTONE N="40"/> he had been for some days fuller of thoughts than he used to be, and that he had been speaking with Seamen, who used to go with him, and that some of them had carried provisions on board the Bark; of which she had ask'd her Husband the reason; <Q>who had told her, “that he was” promised fraight speedily, and therefore he would make all things ready.</Q> She was sure that there was yet no lading in the Ship, and therefore, when she saw her Husband take all those Materials with him, which was a sure sign that he meant to go to Sea, and it being late in the night, she shut the door, and swore he should not go out of his House. <Q>He <MILESTONE N="50"/> told her, “he must go, and was engaged to go to Sea that night; for” which he should be well paid.</Q> <Q>His Wife told him, “she was sure he was doing somewhat that would undo him, and she was resolv'd he should
<PB N="330" REF="3460"/>
not go out of his House; and if he should persist in it, she would tell the Neighbours, and carry him before the Mayor to be examin'd, that” the truth might be found out.</Q> The poor Man, thus master'd by the passion and violence of his Wife, was forced to yield to her, that there might be no farther noise; and so went into his bed.</P>
<P>AND it was very happy that the King's jealousy hasten'd him from that Inn. It was the solemn fast day, which was observ'd in those times principally to enflame the People against the King, and all those who were loyal to him, and there was a Chapel in that Village over against that Inn, where a Weaver, who had been a Soldier, used to preach, and utter all the villainy imaginable against the old Order of Government: <MILESTONE N="10"/> <Q>and he was then in the Chapel preaching to his Congregation, when the King went from thence, and telling the People “that <HI>Charles Stuart</HI> was lurking somewhere in that Country, and that they would merit” from God Almighty, if they could find him out.</Q> The Passengers, who had lodged in the Inn that night, had, assoon as they were up, sent for a Smith to visit their Horses, it being a hard frost. The Smith, when <NOTE PLACE="marg">Like to be dis∣cover'd by a Smith shooing their Horses.</NOTE> he had done what he was sent for, according to the custom of that Peo∣ple, examin'd the feet of the other two Horses to find more work. <Q>When he had observ'd them, he told the Host of the House, “that one of those <MILESTONE N="20"/> Horses had travel'd far; and that he was sure that his four Shooes had” been made in four several Counties;</Q> which, whether his skill was able to discover or no, was very true. The Smith going to the Sermon told this story to some of his Neighbours; and so it came to the ears of the Preacher, when his Sermon was done. Immediately he sent for an Officer, and search'd the Inn, and enquir'd for those Horses; and being inform'd that they were gone, he caused Horses to be sent to follow them, and to make enquiry after the two Men who rid those Horses, and positively declared "that one of them was <HI>Charles Stuart.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN they came again to the Colonel, they presently concluded that they were to make no longer stay in those parts, nor any more to <MILESTONE N="30"/> endeavour to find a Ship upon that Coast; and without any farther delay, they rode back to the Colonel's House; where they arriv'd in the night. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King goes back to the Co∣lonel's House.</NOTE> Then they resolv'd to make their next attempt in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> where Colonel <HI>Windham</HI> had no Interest. They must pass through all <HI>Wiltshire</HI> before they came thither; which would require many days journey: and they were first to consider what honest Houses there were in or near the way, where they might securely repose; and it was thought very dangerous for the King to ride through any great Town, as <HI>Salis∣bury,</HI> or <HI>Winchester,</HI> which might probably lie in their way. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THERE was between that and <HI>Salisbury</HI> a very honest Gentleman, Colonel <HI>Robert Philips,</HI> a younger Brother of a very good Family, which had allways been very Loyal; and he had serv'd the King during the War. The King was resolv'd to trust him; and so sent the Lord <HI>Wil∣mot</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sends</HI> Wilmot <HI>for</HI> Robert Phi∣lips.</NOTE> to a place from whence he might send to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philips</HI> to come to him, and when he had spoken with him, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philips</HI> should come to the King, and <HI>Wilmot</HI> was to stay in such a place as they two should agree. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philips</HI> accordingly came to the Colonel's House; which he could do without suspicion, they being nearly ally'd. The ways were very full of Soldiers; which were sent now from the Army to their Quarters, <MILESTONE N="50"/> and many Regiments of Horse and Foot were assign'd for the West; of which division <HI>Desborough</HI> was Commander in chief. These marches were like to last for many days, and it would not be fit for the King to
<PB N="331" REF="3470"/>
stay so long in that place. Thereupon, he resorted to his old Security <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Who conducts him to a place near</HI> Salisbury</NOTE> of taking a Woman behind him, a Kinswoman of Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> whom he carried in that manner to a place not far from <HI>Salisbury;</HI> to which Colonel <HI>Philips</HI> conducted him. In this journey he passed through the middle of a Regiment of Horse; and, presently after, met <HI>Des∣borough</HI> walking down a Hill with three or four Men with him; who had lodged in <HI>Salisbury</HI> the night before; all that road being full of Soldiers.</P>
<P>THE next day, upon the Plains, D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hinchman,</HI> one of the Prebends <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Hinchman <HI>meets the King on the Plains; and conducts him to</HI> Heale <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Hyde<HI>'s House</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> met the King, the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> and <HI>Philips</HI> then leaving <MILESTONE N="10"/> him to go to the Sea Coast to find a Vessel, the D<SUP>r</SUP> conducting the King to a place called <HI>Heale,</HI> three miles from <HI>Salisbury,</HI> belonging then to Serjeant <HI>Hyde,</HI> who was afterwards Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and then in the possession of the Widow of his elder Brother; a House that stood alone from Neighbours, and from any high-way; where coming in late in the evening, he supp'd with some Gentlemen who ac∣cidentally were in the House; which could not well be avoided. But, the next morning, he went early from thence, as if he had continued his journey; and the Widow, being trusted with the knowledge of her Guest, sent her Servants out of the way; and, at an hour appointed, <MILESTONE N="20"/> receiv'd him again, and accommodated him in a little room, which had been made since the beginning of the Troubles for the concealment of Delinquents, the Seat allways belonging to a Malignant Family.</P>
<P>HERE he lay concealed, without the knowledge of some Gentlemen who liv'd in the House, and of others who daily resorted thither, for many days, the Widow her self only attending him with such things as were necessary, and bringing him such Letters as the D<SUP>r</SUP> receiv'd from the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Philips.</HI> A Vessel being at last provided upon the coast of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and notice thereof sent to D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hinchman,</HI> he sent to the King to meet him at <HI>Stone-henge</HI> upon the plains three miles <MILESTONE N="30"/> from <HI>Heale;</HI> whither the Widow took care to direct him; and being there met, he attended him to the place where Colonel <HI>Philips</HI> receiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to a House in</HI> Sus∣sex <HI>near Bright-hem∣sted; where a Bark was pro∣vided by Colo∣nel</HI> Gunter. <HI>He arrives in</HI> Normandy <HI>in a small Creek in</HI> Novemb.</NOTE> him. He, the next day, deliver'd him to the Lord <HI>Wilmot;</HI> who went with him to a House in <HI>Sussex,</HI> recommended by Colonel <HI>Gunter,</HI> a Gentleman of that Country, who had serv'd the King in the War; who met him there; and had provided a little Bark at <HI>Bright-hemsted,</HI> a small fisher Town; where he went early on board, and, by God's Blessing, arriv'd safely in <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P><Q>THE Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> who was then at his House at <HI>Titchfield</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> had been advertised of the King's being in the West, and <MILESTONE N="40"/> of his missing his passage at <HI>Lyme,</HI> and sent a trusty Gentleman to those faithful Persons in the Country, who, he thought, were most like to be employed for his Escape if he came into those parts, to let them know, “that he had a Ship ready, and if the King came to him, he should be” safe;</Q> which advertisement came to the King the night before he em∣barked, and when his Vessel was ready. But his Majesty ever acknow∣ledged the obligation with great kindness, he being the only Person of that condition, who had the Courage to sollicite such danger, though all good Men heartily wished his deliverance. It was in <HI>November,</HI> that the King landed in <HI>Normandy,</HI> in a small Creek; from whence he got <MILESTONE N="50"/> to <HI>Roan,</HI> and then gave notice to the Queen of his arrival, and freed his Loyal Subjects in all places from their dismal Apprehensions.</P>
<P>THOUGH this wonderful deliverance and preservation of the Person
<PB N="332" REF="3480"/>
of the King, was an Argument of general joy and comfort to all his good Subjects, and a new seed of hope for future blessings, yet his present condition was very deplorable. <HI>France</HI> was not at all pleased with his being come thither, nor did quickly take notice of his being there. The Queen his Mother was very glad of his Escape, but in no degree able to contribute towards his Support; they who had Interest with her, find∣ing all she had, or could get, too little for their own unlimited Expence. Besides, the distraction that Court had been lately in, and was not yet free from the effects of, made her Pension to be paid with less pun∣ctuality than it had used to be; so that she was forced to be in debt <MILESTONE N="10"/> both to her Servants, and for the very Provisions of her House; nor had the King one shilling towards the support of Himself, and his Fa∣mily.</P>
<P>ASSOON as his Majesty came to <HI>Paris,</HI> and knew that the Chancel∣lor of the Exchequer was at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> he commanded <HI>Seymour,</HI> who was of his Bed-Chamber, to send to him to repair thither; <Q>which whilst <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sends to the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer to repair to him at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> he was providing to do, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long,</HI> the King's Secretary, who was at <HI>Am∣sterdam,</HI> and had been remov'd from his Attendance in <HI>Scotland</HI> by the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> writ to the Chancellor, “that he had receiv'd a Let∣ter from the King, by which he was required to let all his Majesty's <MILESTONE N="20"/> Servants who were in those parts, know, it was his pleasure that none of them should repair to him to <HI>Paris,</HI> until they should receive far∣ther order, since his Majesty could not yet resolve how long he should” stay there:</Q> <Q>of which, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI> said, “he thought it his duty to give him notice; with this, that the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> and himself, who had resolv'd to have made hast thither, had in obedience to this com∣mand” laid aside that purpose.</Q> The Chancellor concluded that this in∣hibition concern'd not Him, since he had receiv'd a command from the King to wait upon him. Besides, he had still the Character of Embassa∣dour upon him, which he could not lay down till he had kissed his Ma∣jesty's <MILESTONE N="30"/> hand. So he pursued his former purpose, and came to <HI>Paris</HI> in the <HI>Christmas,</HI> and found that the command to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI> had been pro∣cured <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor of the Exche∣quer comes to him in</HI> Christ∣mas <HI>at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> with an eye principally upon the Chancellor, there being some there who had no mind he should be with the King; though, when there was no remedy, the Queen receiv'd him graciously. But the King was very well pleased with his being come; and, for the first four or five days, he spent many hours with him in private, and inform'd him of very many particulars, of the harsh treatment he had receiv'd in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e re∣ceives from the King this Account of his Majesty's Deliverance.</NOTE> the reason of his march into <HI>England,</HI> the confusion at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and all the circumstances of his happy escape and deliverance; many <MILESTONE N="40"/> parts whereof are comprehended in this relation, and are exactly true. For besides all those particulars which the King himself was pleased to communicate to him, so soon after the transactions of them, when they had made so lively an impression in his memory, and of which the Chan∣cellor at that time kept a very punctual Memorial; he had, at the same time, the daily conversation of the Lord <HI>Wilmot;</HI> who inform'd him of all he could remember: and sometimes the King and He recollected many particulars in the discourse together, in which the King's memory was much better than the other's. And after the King's blessed return into <HI>England,</HI> he had frequent conferences with many of those who had <MILESTONE N="50"/> acted several parts towards the Escape; whereof some were of the Chan∣cellor's nearest Alliance, and others his most intimate Friends; towards whom his Majesty allways made many gracious expressions of his ac∣knowledgement:
<PB N="333" REF="3490"/>
so that there is nothing in this short relation the ve∣rity whereof can justly be suspected, though, as is said before, it is great pity, that there could be no Diary made, indeed no exact Account of every Hours adventure from the coming out of <HI>Worcester,</HI> in that dis∣mal confusion, to the hour of his embarkation at <HI>Bright-hemsted;</HI> in which there was such a concurrence of good-nature, charity, and ge∣nerosity, in Persons of the meanest and lowest extraction and condition, who did not know the value of the precious Jewel that was in their Custody, yet all knew him to be escaped from such an Action as would make the discovery and delivery of him to those who govern'd over and <MILESTONE N="10"/> amongst them, of great benefit, and present advantage to them; and in those who did know him, of such courage, loyalty, and activity, that all may reasonably look upon the whole, as the inspiration and conduct of God Almighty, as a manifestation of his power and glory, and for the conviction of the whole Party, which had sinn'd so grievously; and if it hath not wrought that effect in them, it hath render'd them the more inexcusable.</P>
<P>AS the greatest Brunt of the danger was diverted by these poor Peo∣ple, in his Night-marches on foot, with so much pain and torment, that he often thought that he paid too dear a price for his Life, before <MILESTONE N="20"/> he fell into the hands of Persons of better Quality, and places of more conveniency, so he owed very much to the diligence and fidelity of some Ecclesiastical Persons of the Romish perswasion; especially to those of the Order of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Bennet;</HI> which was the reason that he expressed more favours, after his Restoration, to that Order than to any other, and granted them some extraordinary Privileges about the Service of the Queen, not concealing the reason why he did so; which ought to have satisfied all Men, that his Majesty's indulgence towards all of that pro∣fession, by restraining the severity and rigour of the Laws which had been formerly made against them, had its rise from a Fountain of Prince∣ly <MILESTONE N="30"/> justice and gratitude, and of Royal bounty and clemency.</P>
<P>WHILST the Counsels and Enterprises in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> had this woeful issue, <HI>Ireland</HI> had no better Success in its Undertakings. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> Ireland <HI>at this time.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cromwell</HI> had made so great a Progress in his Conquests, before he left that Kingdom to visit <HI>Scotland,</HI> that he was become, upon the matter, entirely possessed of the two most valuable, and best inhabited Provinces, <HI>Lemster,</HI> and <HI>Munster;</HI> and plainly discern'd, that what remain'd to be done, if dextrously conducted, would be with most ease brought to pass by the folly, and perfidiousness of the <HI>Irish</HI> themselves; who would save their Enemies a labour, in contributing to, and hastning their own <MILESTONE N="40"/> destruction. He had made the bridge fair, easy, and safe for them to pass over into foreign Countries, by Levies and Transportations; which liberty they embraced, as hath been said before, with all imaginable greediness: and he had entertain'd Agents, and Spies, as well Fryars, as others amongst the <HI>Irish,</HI> who did not only give him timely advertise∣ments of what was concluded to be done, but had interest and power enough to interrupt, and disturb the consultations, and to obstruct the execution thereof: and having put all things in this hopeful Method of proceeding, in which there was like to be more use of the Halter than the Sword, he committed the managing of the rest, and the Govern∣ment <MILESTONE N="50"/> of the Kingdom, to his Son in Law <HI>Ireton;</HI> whom he made De∣puty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ireton <HI>made Lord Deputy by</HI> Cromwell</NOTE> under him of <HI>Ireland:</HI> a Man, who knew the bottom of all his Counsels and Purposes, and was of the same, or a greater pride and
<PB N="334" REF="3500"/>
fierceness in his Nature, and most inclined to pursue those Rules, in the forming whereof he had had the chief influence. And He, without fighting a Battle, though he liv'd not many Months after, reduced most of the rest that <HI>Cromwell</HI> left unfinished.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> knew, and understood well the desperate <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Mar∣quis of</HI> Or∣mond<HI>'s con∣dition there.</HI></NOTE> condition and state he was in, when he had no other strength and power to depend upon, than that of the <HI>Irish,</HI> for the support of the King's Authority: yet there were many of the Nobility, and principal Gentry of the <HI>Irish,</HI> in whose Loyalty towards the King, and affection and friend∣ship towards his own Person, he had justly all confidence; and there <MILESTONE N="10"/> were amongst the Romish Clergy some moderate Men, who did detest the savage ignorance of the rest: so that he entertain'd still some hope, that the Wiser would by degrees convert the weaker, and that they would all understand how inseparable their own preservation and interest was from the support of the King's dignity and authority, and that the wonderful judgements of God, which were every day executed by <HI>Ireton</HI> upon the principal, and most obstinate Contrivers of their odious Re∣bellion, and who perversly and peevishly opposed their return to their obedience to the King, as often as they fell into his power, would awaken them out of their Sottish Lethargy, and unite them in the defence of <MILESTONE N="20"/> their Nation. For there was scarce a Man, whose bloody and brutish behaviour in the beginning of the Rebellion, or whose barbarous Vio∣lation of the Peace that had been consented to, had exempted them from the King's mercy, and left them only Subjects of his Justice, assoon as they could be apprehended, who was not taken by <HI>Ireton,</HI> and hanged with all the circumstances of Severity that was due to their wicked∣ness; of which innumerable Examples might be given.</P>
<P>THERE yet remain'd free from <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Yoke, the two large Pro∣vinces of <HI>Connaught</HI> and of <HI>Ulster,</HI> and the two strong Cities of <HI>Limrick</HI> and of <HI>Galloway,</HI> both Garrison'd with <HI>Irish,</HI> and excellently supplied <MILESTONE N="30"/> with all things necessary for their defence, and many other good Port Towns, and other strong places; all which pretended and professed to be for the King, and to yield obedience to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> his Majesty's Lieutenant. And there were still many good Regiments of Horse and Foot together under <HI>Preston,</HI> who seem'd to be ready to per∣form any Service the Marquis should require: so that he did reasonably hope, that by complying with some of their humours, by sacrificing somewhat of his Honour, and much of his Authority, to their jealousy and peevishness, he should be able to draw such a strength together, as would give a stop to <HI>Ireton</HI>'s Career. <Q><HI>O Neile</HI> at this time, after he had <MILESTONE N="40"/> been so baffled and affronted by the Parliament, and after he had seen his bosome Friend, and sole Counsellor, the Bishop of <HI>Clogher</HI> (who had managed the Treaty with <HI>Monk,</HI> and was taken Prisoner upon the de∣feat of his Forces) hanged, drawn, and quarter'd as a Traytor, sent “to offer his Service to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> with the Army under his command, upon such conditions as the Marquis thought fit to send to” him;</Q> and it was reasonably believ'd that he did intend very sincerely, and would have done very good Service; for he was the best Soldier of the Nation, and had the most command over his Men, and was best obeyed by them. But, as he was upon his march towards a conjunction <MILESTONE N="50"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Owen Row O Neile <HI>died, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was go∣ing to joyn with the Mar∣quis of</HI> Or∣mond</NOTE> with the Lord Lieutenant, he fell sick; and, in a few days, died: so that that Treaty produced no effect; for though many of his Army pro∣secuted his resolution, and joyn'd with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> yet
<PB N="335" REF="3510"/>
their Officers had little power over their Soldiers; who, being all of the old <HI>Irish</HI> Septs of <HI>Ulster,</HI> were entirely govern'd by the Fryars, and were shortly after prevail'd upon, either to transport themselves, or to retire to their Boggs, and prey for themselves upon all they met, with∣out distinction of Persons or Interest.</P>
<P>THE Marquis's Orders for drawing the Troops together to any Ren∣dezvous, were totally neglected and disobey'd; and the Commissioner's Orders for the collection of money, and contribution in such proportions as had been settled and agree'd unto, were as much contemn'd: so that such Regiments, as with great difficulty were brought together, were <MILESTONE N="10"/> assoon dissolv'd for want of pay, order, and accommodation; or else dispersed by the power of the Fryars; as in the City of <HI>Limrick,</HI> when the Marquis was there, and had appointed several Companies to be drawn into the Market-place, to be employ'd upon a present Expedition, an Officer of good Affections, and thought to have much credit with his Soldiers, brought with him two hundred very likely Soldiers well arm'd, and disciplin'd, and having receiv'd his Orders from the Marquis (who was upon the place) begun to march; <Q>when a Franciscan Fryar in his habit, and with a Crucifix in his hand, came to the head of the Com∣pany, and commanded them all, “upon pain of damnation, that they” should not march: upon which they all threw down their Arms, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> did as the Fryar directed them;</Q> who put the whole City into a Mutiny: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Limrick, <HI>whence the Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> caped.</HI></NOTE> insomuch as the Lord Lieutenant was compell'd to go out of it, and not without some difficulty escaped; though most of the Magistrates of the City did all that was in their power to suppress the disorder, and to re∣duce the People to obedience; and some of them were kill'd, and many wounded in the Attempt. As an Instance of those judgements from Heaven which we lately mention'd in general, <HI>Patrick Fanning,</HI> who with the Fryar had the principal part in that Sedition, the very next night after <HI>Ireton</HI> was possessed of that strong City, was apprehended, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and the next day hang'd, drawn, and quarter'd. Such of the Commis∣sioners who adhered firmly to the Lord Lieutenant, in using all their power to advance the King's Service, and to reduce their miserable Country-men from effecting, and contriving their own destruction, were without any credit, and all their Warrants and Summons neglected; when the others, who declin'd the Service, and desired to obstruct it, had all respect and submission paid to them.</P>
<P>THEY who appear'd, after the first misfortune before <HI>Dublin,</HI> to cor∣rupt, and mislead, and dishearten the People, were the Fryars, and some of their inferior Clergy. But now the titular Bishops, who had been all made at <HI>Rome</HI> since the beginning of the Rebellion, appear'd more active <MILESTONE N="40"/> than the other. They call'd an Assembly of the Bishops (every one of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Popish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i¦shops make a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Assembly, and publish a De¦claration a¦gainst the</HI> En¦glish.</NOTE> which had sign'd the Articles of the Peace) and chose some of their Clergy as a Representative of their Church to meet at <HI>James</HI> Town; where, under the pretence of providing for the security of Religion, they examin'd the whole proceedings of the War, and how the Monies which had been collected, had been issued out. <Q>They call'd the giving up the Towns in <HI>Munster</HI> by the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI>'s Officers, “the Con∣spiracy and Treachery of all the English, out of their malice to Catho∣lick” Religion;</Q> and thereupon pressed the Lord Lieutenant to dismiss all the <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen who yet remain'd with him. <Q>They call'd every <MILESTONE N="50"/> unprosperous Accident that had fallen out, “a foul miscarriage; and publish'd a Declaration full of libellous Invectives against the <HI>English,</HI>

without sparing the Person of the Lord Lieutenant; who, they said, being of a contrary Religion, and a known inveterate Enemy to the Catholick, was not fit to be intrusted with the conduct of a War that” was raised for the support, and preservation of it;</Q> <Q>and shortly after sent an Address to the Lord Lieutenant himself, in which they told him, “that the People were so far unsatisfied with his conduct, espe∣cially for his aversion from the Catholick Religion, and his favouring Hereticks, that they were unanimously resolv'd, as one Man, not to <NOTE PLACE="marg">They declare to the Lord Lieu∣tenant they will no longer submit to him; and require him to commit the Govern∣ment to a Ro∣man Catholick.</NOTE> submit any longer to his Command, nor to raise any more Money, or” Men, to be apply'd to the King's Service under his Authority.</Q> <Q>But, <MILESTONE N="10"/> on the other side, they assured him, “that their duty and zeal was so entire, and real for the King, and their resolution so absolute never to withdraw themselves from his obedience, that, if he would depart the Kingdom, and commit the Command thereof into the hands of any Person of honour of the Catholick Religion, he would thereby unite the whole Nation to the King; and they would immediately raise an” Army that should drive <HI>Ireton</HI> quickly again into <HI>Dublin;</HI></Q> and that the Lord Lieutenant might know that they would not depart from this determination, they publish'd soon after an Excommunication against all Persons who should obey any of the Lieutenant's Orders, or raise <MILESTONE N="20"/> Money or Men by virtue of his Authority.</P>
<P>DURING all these Agitations, many of the Roman Catholick Nobi∣lity, and other Persons of the best Quality, remain'd very faithful to the Lord Lieutenant; and cordially interposed with the Popish Bishops to prevent their violent proceedings; but had not power either to per∣swade, or restrain them. The Lord Lieutenant had no reason to be de∣lighted with his empty title to command a People who would not obey, and knew the daily danger he was in, of being betray'd, and deliver'd into the hands of <HI>Ireton,</HI> or being assassinated in his own Quarters. And though he did not believe that the <HI>Irish</HI> would behave themselves with <MILESTONE N="30"/> more fidelity, and courage for the King's Interest, when he should be gone; well knowing that their Bishops and Clergy design'd nothing but to put themselves under the Government of some Popish Prince, and had at that time sent Agents into foreign parts for that purpose; yet he knew likewise that there were in truth Men enough, and Armes, and all provisions for the carrying on the War, who, if they were united, and heartily resolv'd to preserve themselves, would be much superior in number to any power <HI>Ireton</HI> could bring against them. He knew like∣wise, that he could safely deposite the King's Authority in the hands of a Person of unquestionable fidelity, whom the King would, without <MILESTONE N="40"/> any scruple, trust, and whom the <HI>Irish</HI> could not except against, being of their own Nation, of the greatest Fortune and Interest amongst them, and of the most eminent Constancy to the Roman Catholick Religion of any Man in the three Kingdoms; and that was the Marquis of <HI>Clan∣rickard.</HI> And therefore, since it was to no purpose to stay longer there himself, and it was in his power safely to make the experiment, whether the <HI>Irish</HI> would in truth perform what was in their power to perform, and which they so solemnly promised to do, he thought he should be inexcusable to the King, if he should not consent to that Expedient. The great difficulty was to perswade the Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard</HI> to accept <MILESTONE N="50"/> the trust, who was a Man, though of an unquestionable courage, yet, of an infirm health; and lov'd, and enjoy'd great ease throughout his whole life; and of a constitution not equal to the satigue, and distresses,
<PB N="337" REF="3530"/>
that the conducting such a War must subject him to. He knew well, and exceedingly detested, the levity, inconstancy, and infidelity of his Country-men: nor did he in any degree like the presumption of the Popish Bishops, and Clergy, and the exorbitant power which they had assumed, and usurped to themselves; and therefore he had no mind to engage himself in such a Command. But by the extraordinary impor∣tunity of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> with whom he had preserv'd a fast and unshaken friendship, and his pressing him to preserve <HI>Ireland</HI> to the King, without which it would throw it self into the Armes of a Foreigner; <Q>and then the same importunity from all the <HI>Irish</HI> Nobility, Bishops, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and Clergy (after the Lord Lieutenant had inform'd them of his pur∣pose) “that he would preserve his Nation, which, without his Ac∣ceptance” of their Protection,</Q> <Q>would infallibly be extirpated, and their joynt promise “that they would absolutely submit to all his Commands, and hold no assembly, or meeting amongst themselves, without his” permission and commission,</Q> together with his unquestionable desire to do any thing, how contrary soever to his own inclination and benefit, that would be acceptable to the King, and might possibly bring some advantage to his Majesty's Service, he was in the end prevail'd upon to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>makes the Marquis of</HI> Clanrickard <HI>his Deputy.</HI></NOTE> receive a Commission from the Lord Lieutenant to be Deputy of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> and undertook that Charge.</P>
<P>HOW well they complied afterwards with their promises, and pro∣testations, and how much better Subjects they prov'd to be under their Catholick Governour, than they had been under their Protestant, will be related at large hereafter. In the mean time the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> would not receive a Pass from <HI>Ireton,</HI> who would willingly have granted it, as he did to all the <HI>English</HI> Officers that desired it; but embark'd him∣self, with some few Gentlemen besides his own Servants, in a small Fri∣gat, and arriv'd safely in <HI>Normandy;</HI> and so went to <HI>Caen;</HI> where his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>embarks for</HI> France, <HI>and waits on the King at</HI> Paris <HI>after his Ma∣jesty's escape from</HI> Wor∣cester.</NOTE> Wife and Family had remain'd from the time of his Departure thence. <MILESTONE N="30"/> This was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tly after the King's defeat at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and, assoon as his Majesty arriv'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> he forthwith attended him, and was most wel∣come to him.</P>
<P>SCOTLAND being subdued, and <HI>Ireland</HI> reduced to that obedience as the Parliament could wish, nothing could be expected to be done in <HI>England</HI> for the King's advantage. From the time that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was chosen General in the place of <HI>Fairfax,</HI> he took all occasions to discoun∣tenance the Presbyterians, and to put them out of all Trust and imploy∣ment, as well in the Country as in the Army; and, whilst he was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he had intercepted some Letters from one <HI>Love,</HI> a Presbyte∣rian <MILESTONE N="40"/> Minister in <HI>London</HI> (a fellow who hath been mention'd before, in the time the Treaty was at <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> for preaching against Peace) to a leading Preacher in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and sent such an information against him, with so many successive Instances that Justice might be exemplarily done upon him, that, in spight of all the opposition which the Presbyterians could make, who appear'd publickly with their utmost power, the Man was condemn'd and executed upon <HI>Tower-</HI>hill. And to shew their im∣partiality, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Love, <HI>a Pres∣byterian Mi∣nister, exe∣cuted.</HI></NOTE> about the same time they executed <HI>Brown Bushel,</HI> who had formerly serv'd the Parliament in the beginning of the Rebellion, and shortly after serv'd the King to the end of the War, and had liv'd some years in <HI>England</HI> after the War expired, untaken notice of, but, upon <MILESTONE N="50"/> this occasion, was enviously discover'd, and put to death.</P>
<P>IT is a wonderful thing what operation this Presbyterian Spirit had
<PB N="338" REF="3540"/>
upon the minds of those who were possessed by it. This poor Man <HI>Love,</HI> who had been guilty of as much Treason against the King, from the be∣ginning of the Rebellion, as the Pulpit could contain, was so much with∣out remorse for any wickedness of that kind that he had committed, that he was jealous of nothing so much, as of being suspected to repent, or that he was brought to suffer for his Affection to the King. And there∣fore when he was upon the Scaffold, where he appear'd with a mar∣vellous undauntedness, he seem'd so much delighted with the memory of all that he had done against the late King, and against the Bishops, that he could not even then forbear to speak with animosity and bitter∣ness <MILESTONE N="10"/> against both, and expressed great satisfaction in mind for what he had done against them, and was as much transported with the inward Joy of mind, that he felt in being brought thither to die as a Martyr, and to give testimony for the Covenant; <Q>“whatsoever he had done being in the pursuit of the ends, he said, of that sanctified obligation, to which” he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and by his Conscience engaged.</Q> And in this raving fit, with∣out so much as praying for the King, otherwise than that he might pro∣pagate the Covenant, he laid his head upon the block with as much Courage as the bravest, and honestest Man could do in the most pious occasion. <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Cromwell</HI> return'd to <HI>London,</HI> he caused several High Courts <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>causes several HighCourts of Justice to be erected.</HI></NOTE> of Justice to be erected, by which many Gentlemen of quality were con∣demn'd, and executed in many parts of the Kingdom, as well as in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> who had been taken Prisoners at <HI>Worcester,</HI> or discover'd to have been there. And that the terrour might be universal, some suffer'd for loose discourses in Taverns, what they would do towards restoring the King, and others for having blank Commissions found in their hands sign'd by the King, though they had never attempted to do any thing thereupon, nor, for ought appear'd, intended to do. And under these desolate apprehensions all the Royal and Loyal Party lay groveling, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and prostrate, after the defeat of <HI>Worcester.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was at this time with the King the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> who came thither before the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Though his Majesty was now in unquestionable safety, the streights and necessities <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's ne∣cessities at</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> he was in were as unquestionable; which exposed him to all the trou∣bles and uneasiness that the Masters of very indigent families are sub∣jected to; and the more, because all Men consider'd only his Dignity, and not his Fortune: so that Men had the same emulations, and ambi∣tions, as if the King had all to give which was taken from him, and thought it a good Argument for them to ask, because he had nothing to <MILESTONE N="40"/> give; and ask'd very improper Reversions, because he could not grant the possession; and were sollicitous for Honours, which he had power to grant, because he had not Fortunes to give them.</P>
<P>THERE had been a great acquaintance between the Marquis of <HI>Or∣mond,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The friendship <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Exche∣quer</NOTE> when he was Lord <HI>Thurles,</HI> in the life of his Grandfather, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which was renew'd, by a mutual cor∣respondence, when they both came to have shares in the publick busi∣ness, the one in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the other in <HI>England:</HI> so that when they now met at <HI>Paris,</HI> they met as old friends, and quickly understood each other so well, that there could not be a more entire confidence between <MILESTONE N="50"/> Men. The Marquis consulted with him in his nearest concernments, and the Chancellor esteem'd, and cultivated the friendship with all pos∣sible industry and application. The King was abundantly satisfied in
<PB N="339" REF="3550"/>
the friendship they had for each other, and trusted them both entirely; nor was it in the power of any, though it was often endeavour'd by Persons of no ordinary Account, to break or interrupt that mutual confidence between them, during the whole time the King remain'd be∣yond the Seas; whereby the King's perplexed Affairs were carried on with the less trouble. And the Chancellor did allways acknowledge, that the benefit of this friendship was so great to him, that, without it, he could not have borne the weight of that part of the King's business which was incumbent on him, nor the envy and reproach that attended the trust. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>BESIDES the wants and necessities which the King was pressed with in respect of himself, who had nothing, but was obliged to find himself by credit in Cloaths, and all other necessaries for his Person, and of his Family, which he saw reduced to all extremities; he was much dis∣quieted by the necessities in his Brother the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Family, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Necessities and Factions of the Duke of</HI> York<HI>'s Fa∣mily.</HI></NOTE> by the disorder and faction in it. The Queen complain'd heavily of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Ratcliff,</HI> and the Atturney; and more of the first, because that he pretended to some Right of being of the Duke's Family by a Grant of the late King; which his present Majesty determin'd against him; and reprehended his Activity in the last Summer. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley</HI> had <MILESTONE N="20"/> most of the Queen's favour; and though he had at that time no Interest in the Duke's Affection, he found a way to ingratiate himself with his Royal Highness, by insinuating into him two particulars, in both which he foresaw advantage to himself. Though no Man acted the Governour's part more imperiously than He had done whilst the Lord <HI>Byron</HI> was absent, finding that he himself was liable in some degree to be govern'd upon that Lord's return, he had used all the ways he could, that the Duke might be exempted from any Subjection to a Governour, pre∣suming, that, when that Title should be extinguished, he should be possessed of some such Office and relation, as should not be under the <MILESTONE N="30"/> controle of any but the Duke himself. But he had not yet been able to bring that to pass; which was the reason that he stayed at <HI>Paris</HI> when his Highness visited <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> <Q>Now he took advantage of the Activity of the Duke's Spirit, and infused into him, “that it would be for his Honour to put himself into Action, and not to be learning” his Exercises in <HI>Paris</HI> whilst the Army was in the Field:</Q> <Q>a Proposition first intimated by the Cardinal, “that the Duke was now of years to learn his <HI>mestier,</HI> and had now the opportunity to improve himself, by being in the care of a General reputed equal to any Captain in <HI>Christendom,</HI> with whom he might learn that experience, and make those observations, as might enable him to serve the King his Brother,” <MILESTONE N="40"/> who must hope to recover his Right only by the Sword.</Q> This the Car∣dinal had said both to the Queen, and to the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> whilst the King was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when no Man had the hardiness to advise it in that conjuncture. But, after the King's Return from <HI>England,</HI> there wanted nothing but the Approbation of his Majesty; and no Man more desired it than the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> who had had good Command, and pre∣ferr'd that kind of Life before that which he was obliged to live in at <HI>Paris.</HI> There was no need of Spurs to be employed to incite the Duke; who was most impatient to be in the Army. <Q>And therefore S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/> could not any other way make himself so grateful to him, as by appearing to be of that mind, and by telling the Duke, “that who∣soever opposed it, and disswaded the King from giving his consent,
<PB N="340" REF="3560"/>
was an Enemy to his Highness's Glory, and desired that he should live” allways in Pupillage;</Q> <Q>not omitting to put him in mind, “that his very entrance into the Army set him at Liberty, and put him into his own disposal; since no Man went into the Field under the direction of a” Governour;</Q> still endeavouring to improve his prejudice against those who should either disswade him from pursuing that resolution, or en∣deavour to perswade the King not to approve it; <Q>“which, he told him,” could proceed from nothing but want of Affection to his Person.</Q> By this means he hoped to raise a notable dislike in him of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, he believ'd, did not like the design, because he having spoken to him of it, the other had not enlarged upon it as <MILESTONE N="10"/> an Argument that pleased him.</P>
<P>THE Duke pressed it with earnestness and passion, in which he dis∣sembled not; and found the Queen, as well as the King, very reserv'd in the point; which proceeded from their tenderness towards him, and lest they might be thought to be less concern'd for his safety than they ought to be. His Highness then conferr'd with those, who, he thought, were most like to be consulted with by the King, amongst whom he knew the Chancellor was one; and finding him to speak with less warmth than the rest, as if he thought it a matter worthy of great deliberation, <MILESTONE N="20"/> his Highness was confirm'd in the jealousy which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley</HI> had kindled in him, that He was the principal Person who obstructed the King's condescension. There was at that time no Man with the King, who had been a Counsellor to his Father, or sworn to Himself, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> though he had administred the Affairs in <HI>Ireland,</HI> was never sworn a Counsellor in <HI>England;</HI> yet his Majesty look'd upon him in all respects most fit to ad∣vise him; and thought it necessary to form such a Body, as should be esteem'd by all Men as his Privy Council, without whose advice he would take no resolutions. The King knew the Queen would not be <MILESTONE N="30"/> well pleased, if the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> were not one; who in all other respects was necessary to that Trust, since all Addresses to the Court of <HI>France</HI> were to be made by him: and the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who had cultivated the King's Affection during the time of their Peregrination, and drawn many promises from him, and was full of projects for his Service, could not be left out. The King therefore called the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ap∣points a new Council</NOTE> Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> to the Council-Board; <Q>and de∣clared “that they three, together with the Chancellor of the Exche∣quer,” should be consulted with in all his Affairs.</Q> <Q>The Queen very earnestly pressed the King, “that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley</HI> might likewise be” <MILESTONE N="40"/> made a Counsellor;</Q> which his Majesty would not consent to; and thought he could not refuse the same honour to the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> or any other Person who should wait upon him, if he granted it to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley,</HI> who had no manner of pretence.</P>
<P>BERKLEY took this refusal very heavily, and thought his great parts, and the services he had perform'd, which were known to very few, might well enough distinguish him from other Men. But because he would not be thought without some just pretence which others had not, he very confidently insisted upon a Right he had, by a promise of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> John Berk∣ley <HI>pretends to the Mastership of the Wards</HI></NOTE> late King, to be Master of the Wards; and that Officer had usually been <MILESTONE N="50"/> of the Privy Council. The evidence he had of that promise, was an in∣tercepted Letter from the late King to the Queen, which the Parlia∣ment had caused to be printed. In that Letter the King answer'd a
<PB N="341" REF="3570"/>
Letter he had receiv'd from her Majesty, in which she put him in mind, <Q>“that he had promised her to make <HI>Jack Berkley</HI> (which was the Style in the Letter)” Master of the Wards;</Q> <Q>which, the King said, “he won∣der'd at, since he could not remember that she had ever spoken to” him to that purpose;</Q> <Q>implying likewise that he was not fit for it. He pressed the Chancellor of the Exchequer “to urge this matter of” Right to the King (and said,</Q> <Q>“the Queen would declare the King had promised it to her) and to prevail with his Majesty to make him pre∣sently Master of the Wards; which would give him such a Title to the Board, that others could not take his being called thither as a” <MILESTONE N="10"/> prejudice to them.</Q></P>
<P>THE Chancellor had at that time much kindness for him, and did really desire to oblige him, but he durst not urge that for a reason to the King, which could be none, and what he knew, as well as a Nega∣tive could be known, had no foundation of truth. For besides that he very well knew the late King had not so good an opinion of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley,</HI> as he himself did at that time heartily wish, and endeavour to infuse into him, the King had, after that promise was pretended to be made, granted that Office at <HI>Oxford</HI> to the Lord <HI>Cottington;</HI> who exe∣cuted it as long as Offices were executed under the Grant of the Crown, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and was possessed of the Title to his death. The Chancellor did there∣fore very earnestly endeavour to disswade him from making that pre∣tence and demand to the King; <Q>and told him, “the King could not at this time do a more ungracious thing, that would lose him more the hearts and affections of the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> than in making a Master of the Wards, in a time when it would not be the least Advantage to his Majesty or the Officer, to declare that he re∣solv'd to insist upon that part of his Prerogative which his Father had consented to part with; the resuming whereof in the full rigour, which he might lawfully do, would ruin most of the Estates of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> as well of his Friends as Enemies, in regard of the vast Arrears incurr'd in so many years; and therefore whatever his Majesty might think to resolve hereafter, when it should please God to restore him,” for the present there must be no thought of such an Officer.</Q></P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Berkley</HI> was not satisfied at all with the reason that was alledged; and very unsatisfied with the unkindness (as he called it) of the refusal to interpose in it; <Q>and said, “since his friends would not, he” would himself require justice of the King;</Q> and immediately, hearing that the King was in the next room, went to him; <Q>and, in the warmth he had contracted by the Chancellor's contradiction, pressed his Majesty “”to make good the promise his Father had made;</Q> and magnified the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Services he had done; which he did really believe to have been very great, and, by the custom of making frequent relations of his own Actions, grew in very good earnest to think he had done many things which no body else ever heard of. The King who knew him very well, and believ'd little of his History, and less of his Father's promise, was willing rather to reclaim him from his importunity, than to give him a positive denial (which in his Nature his Majesty affected not) lest it might indispose his Mother or his Brother: and so, to every part of his request concerning the being of the Council, and concerning the Office, gave him such reasons against the gratifying him for the present, that <MILESTONE N="50"/> he could not but plainly discern that his Majesty was very averse from it. But that consideration prevailed not with him; he used so great im∣portunity,
<PB N="342" REF="3580"/>
notwithstanding all the reasons which had been alledged, that at the last the King prevailed with himself, which he used not to do in such Cases, to give him a positive denial, and reprehension, at once; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de∣nies it him.</NOTE> and so left him.</P>
<P>ALL this he imputed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and though he knew well he had not, nor could have spoken with the King from the time they had spoken together, before himself had that Audience from his Majesty; <Q>he declared, “that he knew all that Indisposition had been infused by him; because many of the reasons, which his Ma∣jesty had given against his doing what he desired, were the very same” that the Chancellor had urged to him;</Q> though they could not but <MILESTONE N="10"/> have occurr'd to any reasonable Man, who had been called to consult upon that Subject. This passion prevailed so far upon him, that, not∣withstanding the advice of some of his best Friends to the contrary, he took an opportunity to walk with the Chancellor shortly after; <Q>and, in a very calm, though a very confused discourse, told him, “that, since he was resolv'd to break all friendship with him, which had continued now near twenty years, he thought it but just to give him notice of it, that from hence forward he might not expect any friendship from him, but that they might live towards each other with that civility” <MILESTONE N="20"/> only that Strangers use to do.</Q> <Q>The Chancellor told him, “that the same justice that disposed him to give this notice, should likewise oblige” him to declare the reason of this resolution;</Q> <Q>and asked him, “whe∣ther he had ever broken his word to him? or promised to do what he” had not done?</Q> <Q>He answer'd, “his Exception was, that he could not be brought to make any promise; and that their judgements were so” different, that he would no more depend upon him:</Q> and so they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whereupon S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John <HI>breaks with the Chancellor.</HI></NOTE> parted, without ever after having conversation with each other whilst they remain'd in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><Q>THE Spring was now advanced, and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> continued his importunity with the King, “that he might have his leave to repair to” <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Army.</Q> And thereupon his Majesty called his Council together, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eliberation in the Council, whether the Duke of</HI> York <HI>should go into the</HI> French <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> the Queen his Mother, and his Brother, being likewise present. <Q>There his Majesty declared “what his Brother had long desired of him; to which he had hitherto given no other Answer, than that he would think of it; and before he could give any other, he thought it neces∣sary” to receive their advice:</Q> nor did his Majesty in the least discover what he himself was inclined to. The Duke then repeated what he had desired of the King; <Q>and said, “he thought he asked nothing but what became him; if he did not, he hoped the King would not deny it to” him, and that no body would advise he should.</Q> The Queen spoke <MILESTONE N="40"/> not a word; and the King desired the Lords to deliver their opinion; who all sate silent, expecting who would begin; there being no fixed Rule of the Board, but sometimes, according to the Nature of the busi∣ness, he who was first in place begun, at other times he who was last in Quality; and when it required some debate before any opinion should be deliver'd, any Man was at liberty to offer what he would. But after a long silence, the King commanded the Chancellor of the Exchequer to speak first. <Q>He said, “it could not be expected, that he would deli∣ver his opinion in a Matter that was so much too hard for him, till he heard what others thought; at least, till the Question was other∣wise” <MILESTONE N="50"/> stated than it yet seem'd to him to be.</Q> <Q>He said, “he thought the Council would not be willing to take it upon Them to advise that the

Duke of <HI>York,</HI> the next Heir to the Crown, should go a Voluntier into the <HI>French</HI> Army, and that the exposing himself to so much dan∣ger, should be the effect of Their Counsel who ought to have all possi∣ble tenderness for the safety of every Branch of the Royal Family; but if the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> out of his own Princely courage, and to at∣tain experience in the Art of War, of which there was like to be so great use, had taken a resolution to visit the Army, and to spend that Campagne in it, and that the question only was, whether the King should restrain him from that Expedition, he was ready to declare his opinion, that his Majesty should not; there being great difference be∣tween the King's advising him to go, which implies an approbation,” <MILESTONE N="10"/> and barely suffering him to do what his own Genius inclined him to.</Q> The King and Queen lik'd the stating of the Question, as suiting best with the tenderness they ought to have; and the Duke was as well pleased with it, since it left him at the Liberty he desired; and the Lords thought it safest for Them: and so all were pleased; and much of the prejudice which the Duke had entertain'd towards the Chancellor, was abated: and his Royal Highness, with the good liking of the <HI>French</HI> Court, went to the Army; where he was receiv'd by the Marshal of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke goes to the Army.</NOTE> <HI>Turenne,</HI> with all possible demonstration of respect; where, in a short time, he got the reputation of a Prince of very signal Courage, and to <MILESTONE N="20"/> be universally belov'd of the whole Army by his assable behaviour.</P>
<P>THE insupportable necessities of the King were now grown so noto∣rious, that the <HI>French</HI> Court was compell'd to take notice of them; and thereupon, with some dry Compliments for the smallness of the Assigna∣tion in respect of the ill condition of their Affairs, which indeed were not in any good posture, they settled an Assignation of six thousand Li∣vers <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Assigna∣tion of six thousand Li∣vers by the month settled upon the King by the</HI> French <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> by the Month upon the King, payable out of such a Gabel; which, being to begin six Months after the King came thither, sound too great a debt contracted to be easily satisfied out of such a Monthly receipt, though it had been punctually complied with; which it never was. <Q>The <MILESTONE N="30"/> Queen, at his Majesty's first arrival, had declared, “that she was not able to bear the charge of the King's dyet, but that he must pay one half of the expence of her Table, where both their Majesties eat, with” the Duke of <HI>York,</HI></Q> and the Princess <HI>Henrietta</HI> (which two were at the Queen's charge till the King came thither, but from that time, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was upon the King's Account) and the very first night's Supper which the King eat with the Queen, begun the Account; and a Moiety thereof was charged to the King: so that the first Money that was receiv'd for the King upon his Grant, was entirely stopp'd by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Wood,</HI> the Queen's Treasurer, for the discharge of his Majesty's part of the Queen's <MILESTONE N="40"/> Table (which expence was first satisfied, as often as Money could be procured) and the rest for the payment of other debts contracted, at his first coming, for Cloaths and other Necessaries, there being great care taken that nothing should be left to be distributed amongst his Servants; the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> himself being compell'd to put himself in Pen∣sion, with other Gentlemen, at a Pistole a Week for his dyet, and to walk the Streets on foot, which was no honourable custom in <HI>Paris;</HI> whilst the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> kept an excellent Table for those who courted him, and had a Coach of his own, and all other accommodations inci∣dent to the most full fortune; and if the King had the most urgent oc∣casion <MILESTONE N="50"/> for the Use but of twenty Pistoles, as sometimes he had, he could not find credit to borrow it; which he often had experiment of. Yet
<PB N="344" REF="3600"/>
if there had not been as much care to take that from him which was his own, as to hinder him from receiving the supply assign'd by the King of <HI>France,</HI> his Necessities would not have been so extraordinary. For when the King went to <HI>Jersey</HI> in order to his journey into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and at the same time that he sent the Chancellor of the Exchequer into <HI>Spain,</HI> he sent likewise the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> into <HI>Mosco,</HI> to borrow Mo∣ney of that Duke; and into <HI>Poland</HI> he sent M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Crofts</HI> upon the same er∣rand. The former return'd whilst the King was in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the latter about the time that his Majesty made his escape from <HI>Worcester.</HI> And both of them succeeded so well in their journey, that he who re∣ceiv'd least for his Majesty's Service, had above ten thousand pounds <MILESTONE N="10"/> over and above the expence of their journies.</P>
<P>BUT, as if the King had been out of all possible danger to want Mo∣ney, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How the Mo∣ney was dis∣posed that was sent the King from</HI> Mosco <HI>and</HI> Poland.</NOTE> the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> had sent an Express into <HI>Scotland,</HI> assoon as he knew what success the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> had at <HI>Mosco,</HI> and found there were no less hopes from M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Crofts,</HI> and procured from the King (who could with more ease grant, than deny) Warrants under his hand to both those Envoys, to pay the Monies they had receiv'd to several Per∣sons; whereof a considerable Sum was made a present to the Queen, more to the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> upon pretence of debts due to him, which were not diminish'd by that receipt, and all disposed of according to the <MILESTONE N="20"/> modesty of the Askers; whereof D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Goffe</HI> had eight hundred pounds for Services he had perform'd, and, within few days after the receipt of it, changed his Religion, and became one of the Fathers of the Oratory: so that, when the King return'd in all that distress to <HI>Paris,</HI> he never re∣ceiv'd five hundred Pistoles from the proceed of both those Embassies; nor did any of those who were supplied by his bounty, seem sensible of the obligation, or the more disposed to do him any Service upon their own expence; of which the King was sensible enough, but resolv'd to bear that and more, rather than, by entring into any Expostulation with those who were faulty, to give any trouble to the Queen. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> who, in his own judgement, was very indifferent in all matters relating to Religion, was allways of some Faction that re∣garded it. He had been much addicted to the Presbyterians from the time that there had been any Treaties with the <HI>Scots,</HI> in which he had too much privity. And now, upon the King's Return into <HI>France,</HI> he had a great design to perswade his Majesty to go to the Congregation at <HI>Charenton,</HI> to the end that he might keep up his Interest in the Presby∣terian Party; which he had no reason to believe would ever be able to do the King service, or willing, if they were able, without such odious conditions as they had hitherto insisted upon in all their Overtures. The <MILESTONE N="40"/> Queen did not, in the least degree, oppose this, but rather seem'd to countenance it, as the best Expedient that might incline him, by degrees, to prefer the Religion of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> For though the Queen had never, to this time, by her self, or by others with her advice, used the least means to perswade the King to change his Religion, as well out of observation of the Injunction laid upon her by the deceased King, as out of the conformity of her own judgement, which could not but perswade her that the Change of his Religion would infallibly make all his hopes of recovering <HI>England</HI> desperate; yet it is as true, that, from the King's return from <HI>Worcester,</HI> she did really despair of his being <MILESTONE N="50"/> restored by the Affections of his own Subjects; and believ'd that it could never be brought to pass without a conjunction of Catholick Princes on
<PB N="345" REF="3610"/>
his behalf, and by an united force to restore him; and that such a Con∣junction would never be enter'd into, except the King himself became Roman Catholick. Therefore from this time she was very well con∣tent that any Attempts should be made upon him to that purpose; and, in that regard, wish'd that he would go to <HI>Charenton;</HI> which she well knew was not the Religion he affected, but would be a little discounte∣nance to the Church in which he had been bred; and from which assoon as he could be perswaded in any degree to swerve, he would be more exposed to any other temptation. The King had not positively refused to gratify the Ministers of that Congregation; who, with great pro∣fessions <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Minister▪ of</HI> Charenton <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King to come to their Church; and are se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onded by the Lord</HI> Jermyn.</NOTE> of duty, had besought him to do them that honour, before the Chancellor of the Exchequer came to him; in which it was believ'd, that they were the more like to prevail by the Death of D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Steward;</HI> for whose judgement in matters of Religion the King had reverence, by the earnest recommendation of his Father: and he died after the King's return within fourteen days, with some trouble upon the importunity <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr</HI> Steward <HI>dies presently after the King's return into</HI> France</NOTE> and artifice he saw used to prevail with the King to go to <HI>Charenton,</HI> though he saw no disposition in his Majesty to yield to it.</P>
<P><Q>THE Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> still pressed it, “as a thing that ought in policy and discretion to be done, to reconcile that People, which was a great <MILESTONE N="20"/> Body in <HI>France,</HI> to the King's Service, which would draw to him all the foreign Churches, and thereby he might receive considerable” Assistance.</Q> <Q>He wonder'd, he said, “why it should be opposed by any Man; since he did not wish that his Majesty would discontinue his own Devotions, according to the course he had allways observ'd; nor propose that he should often repair thither, but only sometimes, at least once, to shew that he did look upon them as of the same Religion with him; which the Church of <HI>England</HI> had allways acknowledged; and that it had been an Instruction to the <HI>English</HI> Embassadours, that they should keep a good correspondence with those of the Religion, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> frequently resort to Divine Service at <HI>Charenton;</HI> where they had all∣ways” a Pew kept for them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE Chancellor of the Exchequer disswaded his Majesty from going <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancellor of the Exche¦quer disswaded him from it.</NOTE> thither with equal earnestness; told him, “that, whatever counte∣nance or favour, the Crown or Church of <HI>England,</HI> had heretofore shew'd to those Congregations, it was in a time when they carried them∣selves with modesty and duty towards both, and when they professed great duty to the King, and much reverence to that Church; lament∣ing themselves, that it was not in their power, by the opposition of the State, to make their Reformation so perfect as it was in <HI>England.</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> And by this kind of behaviour they had indeed receiv'd the Protection and Countenance from <HI>England</HI> as if they were of the same Religion, though, it may be, the Original of that Countenance and Protection proceeded from another less warrantable foundation; which he was sure would never find credit from his Majesty. But, whatever it was, that People now had undeserv'd it from the King; for, assoon as the Troubles begun, the Hugonots of <HI>France</HI> had generally expressed great Malice to the late King, and very many of their Preachers and Mini∣sters had publikly and industriously justified the Rebellion, and pray'd for the good success of it; and their Synod it self had in such a manner <MILESTONE N="50"/> inveigh'd against the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that they, upon the matter, professed themselves to be of another Religion; and inveigh'd against Episcopacy, as if it were inconsistent with the Protestant Religion.
<PB N="346" REF="3620"/>
That one of their great Professors at their University of <HI>Saumur,</HI> who was look'd upon as a Man of the most moderate spirit amongst their Ministers, had publish'd an Apology for the general inclination of that Party to the proceedings of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> lest it might give some jealousy to their own King of their inclination to Rebellion, and of their opinion that it was lawful for Subjects to take up Armes against their Prince; which, he said, could not be done in <HI>France</HI> without manifest Rebellion, and incurring the displeasure of God for the manifest breach of his Commandments; because the King of <HI>France</HI> is an absolute King, independent upon any other Authority. But that the Constitution of the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> was of another Nature; because the King there is subordinate to the Parliament, which hath Authority to raise Armes for the Reformation of Religion, or for the executing the publick Justice of the Kingdom against all those who vio∣late the Laws of the Nation, so that the War might be just There,” which in no case could be warrantable in <HI>France.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>THE Chancellor told the King, “that, after such an indignity offer'd to him, and to his Crown, and since they had now made such a distinction between the Episcopal and the Presbyterian Government, that they thought the Professors were not of the same Religion, his going to <HI>Cha∣renton</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> could not be without this effect, that it would be concluded every where, that his Majesty thought the one or the other Profession to be indifferent; which would be one of the most deadly wounds to” the Church of <HI>England</HI> that it had yet ever suffer'd.</Q> <Q>These reasons prevail'd so far with the King's own natural aversion from what had been proposed, that he declared positively, “he would never go to <HI>Cha∣renton;”</HI></Q> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de∣clar'd he would not go.</NOTE> which determination eased him from any farther application of that People. The reproach of this resolution was wholely charged upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as the implacable Enemy of all Presbyterians, and as the only Man who diverted the King from having <MILESTONE N="30"/> a good opinion of them; whereas in truth, the daily information he re∣ceiv'd from the King himself of their barbarous behaviour in <HI>Scotland</HI> towards him, and of their insupportable pride and pedantry in their Manners, did confirm him in the judgement he had allways made of their Profession; and he was the more grievous to those of that Pro∣fession, because they could not, as they used to do all those who opposed and crossed them in that manner, accuse him of being Popishly affected, and govern'd by the Papists; to whom they knew he was equally odious; and the Queen's knowing him to be most disaffected to her Religion, made her willing to appear most displeased for his hindering the King from going to <HI>Charenton.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was another Accident, which fell out at this time, and which the Chancellor of the Exchequer foresaw would exceedingly increase the Queen's prejudice to him; which he did very heartily desire to avoid, and to recover her Majesty's favour by all the ways he could pursue with his duty; and, in consistence with that, did never, in the least degree, dispose his Majesty to deny any thing to her which she own'd the de∣sire of. Lieutenant General <HI>Middleton,</HI> who had been taken Prisoner after <HI>Worcester</HI> Fight, after he was recover'd of his wounds was sent Pri∣soner to the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> where were likewise many Noble Per∣sons of that Nation, as the Earl of <HI>Crawford,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> and many others. But as They of the Parliament had a greater regard for <HI>Middleton</HI> than for any other of that Country, knowing him to be
<PB N="347" REF="3630"/>
a Man of great honour and courage, and much the best Officer the <HI>Scots</HI> had, so they had a hatred of him proportionable; and they thought they had him at their Mercy, and might proceed against him more war∣rantably for his life, than against their other Prisoners; because he had heretofore, in the beginning of the War, serv'd them; and though he had quitted their Service at the same time when they cashier'd the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and made their new Model, and was at liberty to do what he thought best for himself, yet they resolv'd to free themselves from any farther apprehensions and fear of him: to that purpose they erected a new High Court of Justice, for the Trial of some Persons who had been <MILESTONE N="10"/> troublesome to them, and especially <HI>Middleton</HI> and <HI>Massey.</HI></P>
<P>THIS last, after he had escaped from <HI>Worcester,</HI> and travelled two or three days, found himself so tormented and weaken'd by his Wounds, that being near the Seat of the Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> whose Lieutenant Co∣lonel he had been in the beginning of the War, and being well known to his Lady, he chose to commit himself to Her rather than to her Husband; hoping, that in honour she would have found some means to preserve him. But the Lady had only charity to cure his Wounds, not courage to conceal his Person; and such advertisements were given of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Middleton <HI>and</HI> Massey, <HI>Prisoners in the Tower, de∣sign'd to be tried by a High Court of Ju∣stice.</HI></NOTE> him, that, assoon as he was fit to be remov'd, he was likewise sent to <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Tower, and destin'd to be sacrificed by the High Court of Justice together with <HI>Middleton,</HI> for the future security of the Common∣wealth.</P>
<P>BUT now the Presbyterian interest shew'd it self, and doubtless, in enterprises of this Nature, was very powerful; having in all places Per∣sons devoted to them, who were ready to obey their Orders, though they did not pretend to be of their Party. And the time Approaching that they were sure <HI>Middleton</HI> was to be tried, that is, to be executed, they gave him so good and particular Advertisement, that he took his leave of his Friends in the Tower, and made his Escape; and having <NOTE PLACE="marg">Middleton <HI>makes his escape into</HI> France.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"/> Friends enough to shelter him in <HI>London,</HI> after he had concealed him∣self there a fortnight or three Weeks, that the diligence of the first exa∣mination and enquiry was over, he was safely transported into <HI>France.</HI> And within few days after, <HI>Massey</HI> had the same good fortune, to the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> Massey <HI>escapes.</HI></NOTE> grief and vexation of the very Soul of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who thirsted for the blood of those two Persons.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Middleton</HI> came to the King to <HI>Paris,</HI> he brought with him <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of</HI> Scotland <HI>brought to the King by a</HI> Scotish <HI>Vicar that</HI> Middle∣ton <HI>brought with him.</HI></NOTE> a little <HI>Scotish</HI> Vicar, who was known to the King, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Knox,</HI> who brought Letters of credit to his Majesty, and some Propositions from his Friends in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and other Dispatches from the Lords in the Tower, with whom he had conferr'd after <HI>Middleton</HI> had escaped from <MILESTONE N="40"/> thence. He brought the relation of the terror that was struck into the hearts of that whole Nation by the severe proceedings of General <HI>Monk,</HI> to whose care <HI>Cromwell</HI> had committed the Reduction of that Kingdom, upon the taking of <HI>Dundee,</HI> where Persons of all degrees and qualities were put to the Sword after the Town was enter'd, and all left to plun∣der; upon which all other places render'd. All Men complain'd of the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who prosecuted the King's Friends with the utmost malice, and protected and preserv'd the rest according to his desire. <Q>He gave the King assurance from the most considerable Persons, who had <MILESTONE N="50"/> retired into the High-lands, “that they would never swerve from their duty; and that they would be able, during the Winter, to infest the Enemy by incursions into their Quarters; and that, if <HI>Middleton</HI>
<PB N="348" REF="3640"/>
might be sent to them with some Supply of Armes, they would have” an Army ready against the Spring, strong enough to meet with <HI>Monk.</HI></Q> <Q>He said, “he was Addressed from <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Lords in the Tower, who did not then know that <HI>Middleton</HI> had arriv'd in safety with the King; and therefore they had commanded him, if neither <HI>Middleton,</HI> nor the Lord <HI>Newburgh</HI> were about his Majesty, that then he should repair to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and desire him to present him to the King; but that, having found both those Lords there, he had made no farther application than to them, who had brought him to” his Majesty.</Q> <Q>He told the King, “that both those in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Requests to the King of his Friends there.</NOTE> those in the Tower, made it their humble request, or rather a con∣dition to his Majesty; that, except it were granted, they would no more think of serving his Majesty: the condition was, that what∣ever should have relation to his Service in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to Their Persons who were to venture their lives in it, might not be commu∣nicated to the Queen, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> or the Lord <HI>Wilmot.</HI> They professed all duty to the Queen, but they knew she had too good an opinion of the Marquis of <HI>Argyle;</HI> who would infallibly come to know whatever was known to either of” the other.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THE King did not expect that any notable Service could be per∣form'd by his Friends in <HI>Scotland</HI> for his Advantage, or their own re∣demption; yet did not think it fit to seem to undervalue the professions, and Overtures of those who had, during his being amongst them, made all possible demonstration of Affection, and Duty to him; and therefore resolv'd to grant any thing they desired; and so promised not to com∣municate any thing of what they proposed to the Queen, or the other three Lords. But since they proposed present Dispatches to be made of Commissions, and Letters, he wished them to consider, whom they would be willing to trust in the performing that Service. <Q>The next day <MILESTONE N="30"/> they attended his Majesty again, and desired, “that all matters relating to <HI>Scotland</HI> might be consulted by his Majesty with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Lord <HI>Newburgh,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer;” and that all the dispatches might be made by the Chancellor;</Q> which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King ap∣points the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make all Dispatches for</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> the King consented to; and bid the Lord <HI>Newburgh</HI> go with them to him, and let him know his Majesty's pleasure. And thereupon the Lord <HI>Newburgh</HI> brought <HI>Middleton</HI> to the Chancellor; who had never seen his face before.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, be∣liev'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond<HI>'s and the Chan∣cellor's opinion concerning the King's Af∣fairs at that time.</HI></NOTE> that the King had nothing at this time to do but to be quiet, and <MILESTONE N="40"/> carefully avoid doing any thing that might do him hurt, and to expect some blessed conjuncture from the Amity of Christian Princes, or some such revolution of Affairs in <HI>England</HI> by their own discontents, and divisions amongst themselves, as might make it seasonable for his Ma∣jesty again to shew himself. And therefore they proposed nothing to themselves but patiently to expect one of those conjunctures, and, in the mean time, so to behave themselves to the Queen, that without be∣ing receiv'd into her trust and confidence, which they did not affect, they might enjoy her Grace and good Acceptation. But the designa∣tion of them to this <HI>Scotish</HI> Intrigue, crossed all this imagination, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> shook that foundation of Peace and tranquillity, upon which they had raised their present hopes.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="3650"/>
<Q>THE Chancellor therefore went presently to the King, and besought <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor of the Exche∣quer desires the King not to employ him in the</HI> Scotish <HI>Affairs.</HI></NOTE> him with earnestness, “that he would not lay that Burthen upon him,” or engage him in any part of the Counsels of that People.</Q> <Q>He put his Majesty in mind of “the continued avow'd jealousy, and displeasure, which that whole Party in that Nation had ever had against him; and that his Majesty very well knew, that those Noble Persons who serv'd him best when he was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in whose affection and fidelity he had all possible satisfaction, had some prejudice against him, and would be troubled when they should hear that all their Secrets were committed to Him. He told his Majesty, this Trust would for ever <MILESTONE N="10"/> deprive him of all hope of the Queen's favour; who could not but discern it within three or four days, and, by the frequent resort of” the <HI>Scotish</HI> Vicar to him</Q> (who had the vanity to desire long conferences with him) <Q>“that there was some secret in hand which was kept from Her; and she would as easily discover, that the Chancellor was privy to it, by his reading Papers to his Majesty, and his Signing them; and would from thence conclude, that He had perswaded him to exclude” her Majesty from that Trust; which she would never forgive.</Q> <Q>Upon the whole, he renew'd his importunity, “that he might be excused” from this confidence.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P><Q>THE King heard him with patience and attention enough; and con∣fessed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's re¦ply to him</NOTE> “”that he had reason not to be sollicitous for that employment; but he wish'd him to consider withal,</Q> <Q>“that he must either undertake it, or that his Majesty must in plain terms reject the correspondence; which, he said, he thought he would not advise him to do. If his Ma∣jesty entertain'd it, it could not be imagin'd that all those transactions could pass through his own hand, or, if they could, his being shut up so long alone would make the same discovery. Whom then should he trust? The Lord <HI>Newburgh,</HI> it was very true, was a very honest Man, and worthy of any Trust; but he was not a Counsellor, and no∣thing <MILESTONE N="30"/> could be so much wonder'd at, as his frequent being shut up with him; and more, his bringing any Papers to him to be sign'd. As to the general prejudice which he conceiv'd was against him by that” Party, his Majesty told him,</Q> <Q>“the Nation was much alter'd since he had to do with them, and that no Men were better lov'd by them now than They who had from the beginning been faithful to his Father,” and Himself.</Q> <Q>To which he added, “that <HI>Middleton</HI> had the least in him, of any infirmities most incident to that Party, that he knew; and that he would find him a Man of great honour and ingenuity, with” whom he would be well pleased.</Q> <Q>His Majesty said, “he would frank∣ly <MILESTONE N="40"/> declare to his Mother, that he had receiv'd some Intelligence out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that he was obliged, and had given his word to those whose lives would be forfeited if known, that he would not commu∣nicate it with any but those who were chosen by themselves; and,” after this, she could not be offended with his reservation:</Q> <Q>and con∣cluded with a gracious conjuration, and command to the Chancellor, “that he should chearfully submit, and undergo that employment; which, he assured him, should never be attended with prejudice or” inconvenience to him.</Q> In this manner, he submitted himself to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancellor submit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and was a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng∣ly trusted in these Affair:</NOTE> King's disposal, and was trusted throughout that Affair; which had se∣veral <MILESTONE N="50"/> Stages in the years following, and did produce the inconveniencies he had foreseen, and render'd him so unacceptable to the Queen, that she easily entertain'd those prejudices against him, which those she most
<PB N="350" REF="3660"/>
trusted were allways ready to infuse into her, and under which he was compelled to bear many hardships.</P>
<P>THIS uncomfortable condition of the King was render'd yet more <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Troubles of the</HI> French <HI>Court about this time.</HI></NOTE> desperate, by the Streights, and Necessities, into which the <HI>French</HI> Court was about this time plunged: so that they who hitherto had shew'd no very good will to assist the King, were now become really unable to do it. The Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> had behaved themselves so refractorily to all their King's commands, pressed so importunately for the liberty of the Princes, and so impatiently for the remove of the Cardinal, that the Cardinal was at last compelled to perswade the Queen to consent to both: and so himself rid to <HI>Havre de Grace,</HI> and deli∣ver'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> the Queen's Warrant to set them at Liberty, and after a short con∣ference with the Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> he continued his own Journey to∣wards <HI>Germany,</HI> and passed in disguise, with two or three Servants, till he came near <HI>Cologne,</HI> and there he remain'd at a House belonging to that Elector.</P>
<P>WHEN the Princes came to <HI>Paris,</HI> they had receiv'd great welcome from the Parliament, and the City; and instead of closing with the Court, which it was thought they would have done, the wound was widen'd without any hope of reconciliation: so that the King, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> Queen Regent, withdrew from thence; the Town was in Armes; and Fire and Sword denounced against the Cardinal; his Goods sold at an outery; and a price set upon his head; and all Persons who professed any duty to their King, found themselves very unsafe in <HI>Paris.</HI> During all this time the Queen of <HI>England</HI> and the King, with their Families, remain'd in the <HI>Louvre,</HI> not knowing whither to go, nor well able to stay there; the Assignements, which had been made for their subsistence, not being paid them: and the loose People of the Town begun to talk of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s being in Armes against them. But the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> under whose name all the disorders were committed, and the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> visited our King and Queen with many Professions of civility; but those were shortly abated likewise, when the <HI>French</HI> King's Army came upon one side of the Town, and the <HI>Spanish,</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI>'s, upon the other. The <HI>French</HI> Army thought they had the Enemy upon an advantage, and desired to have a Battle with them; which the other declined; all which time, the Court had an un∣derhand Treaty with the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> and, upon a day appointed, the <HI>French</HI> King sent to the King of <HI>England,</HI> to desire him to confer with the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> who lay then with his Army within a mile of the Town. There was no reason visible for that desire, nor could it <MILESTONE N="40"/> be conceiv'd, that his Majesty's interposition could be of moment: yet his Majesty knew not how to refuse it; but immediately went to the place assign'd; where he found both Armies drawn up in Battalia within Cannon shot of each other. Upon his Majesty's coming to the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> the Treaty was again reviv'd, and Messages sent be∣tween the Duke and Marshal <HI>Turenne.</HI> In fine, the night approaching, both Armies drew off from their ground, and his Majesty return'd to the <HI>Louvre;</HI> and before the next morning, the Treaty was finish'd be∣tween the Court and the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> and he march'd away with his whole Army towards <HI>Flanders,</HI> and left the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to support <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Parliament against the power of the <HI>French</HI> Army; which advanced upon them with that resolution, that, though they defended themselves very bravely, and the Prince of <HI>Condè</HI> did the Office of a brave General
<PB N="351" REF="3670"/>
in the <HI>Fauxbourg</HI> S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Marceaux,</HI> and at the Port S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Antoine,</HI> in which places many gallant Persons of both sides were slain, they had been all cut off, if the City had not been prevail'd with to suffer them to retire into it; which they had no mind to do. And thereupon the King's Army retired to their old Post, four Leagues off, and attended future advantages: the King having a very great Party in the Parliament and the City, which abhorr'd the receiving and entertaining the <HI>Spaniards</HI> into their bowels.</P>
<P>THIS Retreat of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> broke the neck of the Prince of <HI>Condè's</HI> design. He knew well he should not be long able to retain <MILESTONE N="10"/> the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> from treating with the Court, or keep the <HI>Parisians</HI> at his Devotion; and that the Duke <HI>de Beaufort,</HI> whom they had made Governour of <HI>Paris,</HI> would be weary of the contention. For the pre∣sent, they were all incensed against the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> and were well enough contented that the People should believe, that this defection in the Duke was wrought by the activity, and interposition of the King of <HI>England;</HI> and they who did know that his Interest could not have pro∣duced that effect, could not tell how to interpret his Majesty's journey to speak with the Duke in so unseasonable a conjuncture: so that, as the People expressed, and used all the insolent reproaches against the <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>English</HI> Court at the <HI>Louvre,</HI> and loudly threaten'd to be revenged, so neither the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> nor the Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> made any visit there, or expressed the least civility towards it. In truth, our King and Queen did not think themselves out of danger, nor stirr'd out of the <HI>Louvre</HI> for many days, until the <HI>French</HI> Court thought themselves obliged to provide for their security, by advising the King and Queen to remove, and assign'd S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Germain</HI>'s to them for their Retreat. <Q>Then his Majesty sent to the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> “that their purpose” was to leave the Town:</Q> upon which, there was a Guard that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King of</HI> England <HI>and his Mother <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> move to S<SUP>•</SUP></HI> German<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> attended them out of the Town at the evening; which could not be got to be in readiness till then; and they were shortly after met by some <MILESTONE N="30"/> Troops of Horse sent by the <HI>French</HI> King, which conducted them by Torch light to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Germain</HI>'s; where they arriv'd about midnight; and remain'd there without any disturbance, till <HI>Paris</HI> was reduced to that King's obedience.</P>
<P>IT is a very hard thing for People who have nothing to do, to for∣bear doing something which they ought not to do; and the King might well hope that, since he had nothing else lest to enjoy, he might have enjoy'd quiet and repose; and that a Court which had nothing to give, might have been free from Faction and Ambition; whilst every Man had composed himself to bear the ill fortune he was reduced to for Con∣science
<MILESTONE N="40"/> sake; which every Man pretended to be his case, with submission and content, till it should please God to buoy up the King from the low∣ness he was in; who in truth suffer'd much more than any body else. But whilst there are Courts in the world, emulation and ambition will be inseparable from them; and Kings who have nothing to give, shall be pressed to promise; which oftentimes proves more inconvenient and mischievous than any present gifts could be, because they allways draw on more of the same title, and pretence; and as they who receive the fa∣vours, are not the more satisfied, so they who are not paid in the same kind, or who, out of modesty and discretion, forbear to make such Suits, <MILESTONE N="50"/> are griev'd and offended to see the vanity, and presumption of bold Men, so unseasonably gratified and encouraged.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="3680"/>
THE King found no benefit of this kind in being stripp'd of all his Do∣minions, and all his Power. Men were as importunate, as hath been <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sollicitations for places in the King's Court.</NOTE> said before, for Honours, and Offices, and Revenues, as if they could have taken possession of them assoon as they had been granted, though but by promise: and Men who would not have had the presumption to have ask'd the same thing, if the King had been in <HI>England,</HI> thought it very justifiable to demand it, because he was Not there; since there were so many hazards that they should never live to enjoy what he pro∣mised. The vexations he underwent of this kind, cannot be expressed; and whosoever succeeded not in his unreasonable desires imputed it only to the ill nature of the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and concluded, <MILESTONE N="10"/> that He alone obstructed it, because they allways receiv'd very gracious Answers from his Majesty: so that though his wants were as visible and notorious as any Man's, and it appear'd he got nothing for himself, he paid very dear in his peace and quiet for the credit, and interest he was thought to have with his Master.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> had, by the opportunity of his late conversation with the King in his Escape, drawn many kind expressions from his Ma∣jesty; and he thought he could not be too sollicitous to procure such a Testimony of his Grace and Favour, as might distinguish him from <MILESTONE N="20"/> other Men, and publish the esteem the King had of him. Therefore he importuned his Majesty that he would make him an Earl, referring the time of his Creation to his Majesty's own choice: and the mo∣desty of this reference prevail'd; the King well knowing, that the same Honour would be desired on the behalf of another, by one whom he should be unwilling to deny. But since it was not ask'd for the pre∣sent, he promised to do it in a time that should appear to be convenient for his Service.</P>
<P>THERE were Projects of another kind, which were much more trou∣blesome; in which the Projectors still consider'd Themselves in the first place, and what their condition might prove to be by the success. The <MILESTONE N="30"/> Duke of <HI>York</HI> was so well pleased with the fatigue of the War, that he thought his condition very agreeable; but his Servants did not like that course of life so well, at least desired so far to improve it, that they might reap some Advantages to themselves out of His Appointments. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley</HI> was now, upon the death of the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> by which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> By∣ron, <HI>the Duke's Governour, dies.</HI></NOTE> the Duke was depriv'd of a very good Servant, become the superior of his Family, and call'd himself, without any Authority for it, <HI>Intendant des Affaires de son Altesse Royale;</HI> had the management of all his re∣ceipts and disbursements; and all the rest depended upon him. He de∣sired, by all ways, to get a better Revenue for his Master, than the small <MILESTONE N="40"/> Pension he receiv'd from <HI>France;</HI> and thought no expedient so proper for him, as a Wife of a great and noble Fortune; which he presumed he should have the managing of.</P>
<P>THERE was then a Lady in the Town, <HI>Mademoiselle de Longue∣ville,</HI> the Daughter of the Duke <HI>de Longueville</HI> by his first Wise, by whom she was to inherit a very fair Revenue, and had title to a very considerable Sum of Money, which her Father was obliged to account for: so that she was look'd upon, as one of the greatest and richest Mar∣riages in <HI>France,</HI> in respect of her fortune; in respect of her Person not <MILESTONE N="50"/> at all attractive, being a Lady of a very low stature, and that stature <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John Berk∣ley <HI>des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Ma∣demoiselle de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Duke▪<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se</HI></NOTE> somewhat deform'd. This Lady S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John</HI> design'd for the Duke; and treated with those Ladies who were nearest to her, and had been trusted
<PB N="353" REF="3690"/>
with the Education of her, before he mention'd it to his Royal Highness. Then he perswaded him, <Q>“that all hopes in <HI>England</HI> were desperate: that the Government was so settled there, that it could never be shaken; so that his Highness must think of no other fortune than what he should make by his Sword: that he was now upon the Stage where he must act out his Life, and that he should do well to think of pro∣viding a Civil fortune for himself, as well as a Martial; which could” only be by Marriage:</Q> and then spoke of <HI>Mademoiselle de Longueville,</HI> and made her fortune at least equal to what it was; <Q>“which, he said, when once his Highness was possessed of, he might sell; and thereby raise Money to pay an Army to invade <HI>England,</HI> and so might become the Restorer of the King his Brother: this he thought very practica∣ble,” if his Highness seriously and heartily would endeavour it.</Q> The Duke himself had no aversion from Marriage, and the consideration of the fortune, and the circumstances which might attend it, made it not the less acceptable; <Q>yet he made no other Answer to it, “than that he must first know the King's and Queen's judgement of it, before he could take” any resolution what to do.</Q> Upon which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John</HI> undertook, with his Highness's approbation, to propose it to their Majesties himself, and ac∣cordingly first spoke with the Queen, enlarging on all the benefit which <MILESTONE N="20"/> probably might attend it.</P>
<P>IT was believ'd, that the first Overture and Attempt had not been made without her Majesty's privity, and Approbation; for the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> had been no less active in the contrivance than S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley:</HI> yet her Majesty refused to deliver any opinion in it, till she knew the King's: and so at last, after the young Lady her self had been spoken to, his Majesty was inform'd of it, and his Approbation desired; with which he was not well pleased; and yet was unwilling to use his Authority to ob∣struct what was look'd upon as so great a benefit and advantage to his Bro∣ther; though he did not dissemble his resentment of Their presumption <MILESTONE N="30"/> who undertook to enter upon Treaties of that Nature, with the same liberty as if it concern'd only their own kindred and allies: however, he was very reserv'd in saying what he thought of it. Whilst his Majesty was in deliberation, all the ways were taken to discover what the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer's judgement was; and the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> spoke to him of it, as a matter that would not admit any doubt on the King's part, otherwise than from the difficulty of bringing it to pass, in regard the Lady's friends would not easily be induced to give their consent. <Q>But the Chancellor could not be drawn to make any other Answer, than “that it was a Subject so much above his comprehension, and the consequences might be such, that he had not the ambition to desire to be consulted <MILESTONE N="40"/> with upon it; and that less than the King's or Queen's Command should” not induce him to enter upon the discourse of it.</Q></P>
<P>IT was not long before the Queen sent for him; and seeming to com∣plain <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen con∣sults the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer a∣bout the Mar¦riage.</NOTE> of the importunity, which was used towards her in that affair, and as if it were not grateful to her, ask'd him, what his opinion of it was? <Q>to which he answer'd, “that he did not understand the convenience of it so well, as to judge whether it were like to be of benefit to the Duke of <HI>York:</HI> but he thought, that neither the King, nor her Majesty, should be will∣ing that the Heir of the Crown should be married before the King him∣self; or that it should be in any Woman's power to say, that, if there were but one Person dead, she should be a Queen: with which her Ma∣jesty, who no doubt did love the King with all possible tenderness, seem'd” to be moved, as if it had been a consideration she had not thought of be∣fore;</Q>
<Q><PB N="354" REF="3700"/>
and said, with some warmth, “that she would never give her con∣sent” that it should be so.</Q> However, this Argument was quickly made known to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and several glosses made upon it, to the re∣proach of the Chancellor: yet it made such an impression, that there were then as active endeavours to find a convenient Wife for the King himself, and <HI>Mademoiselle</HI> the Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> by his first Wife, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mademoiselle <HI>likewise thought on for the King.</HI></NOTE> who, in the Right of her Mother, was already possessed of the fair inhe∣ritance of the Dutchy of <HI>Mompensier,</HI> was thought of. To this the Queen was much inclined, and the King himself not averse; both looking too much upon the relief it might give to his present necessities, and the con∣venience <MILESTONE N="10"/> of having a place to repose in, as long as the storm should conti∣nue. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had no thought, by the conclu∣sion he had made in the other Overture, to have drawn on this proposi∣tion; and the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> and He were no less troubled with this, than with the former; which made them be look'd upon as Men of con∣tradiction.</P>
<P><Q>THEY represented to the King, “that, as it could administer only some <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond<HI>'s and the Chancellor of the Exche∣quer's exce∣ption's against this.</HI></NOTE> competency towards his present Subsistence, so it might exceedingly prejudice his future hopes, and alienate the affections of his Friends in <HI>England:</HI> that the Lady was elder than He by some years; which was <MILESTONE N="20"/> an exception amongst private Persons; and had been observ'd not to be prosperous to Kings: That his Majesty must expect to be pressed to those things in point of Religion which he could never consent to; and yet he should undergo the same disadvantage as if he had consented, by many” Men's believing he had done so.</Q> <Q>They besought him “to set his heart entirely upon the recovery of <HI>England,</HI> and to indulge to nothing that might reasonably obstruct That, either by making him less intent upon” it, or by creating new difficulties in the pursuing it.</Q> <Q>His Majesty assur'd them “that his heart was set upon nothing else; and, if he had inclina∣tion to this Marriage, it was because he believ'd it might much facili∣tate <MILESTONE N="30"/> the other: that he look'd not upon her Fortune, which was very great, as an annual support to him, but as a stock that should be at his disposal; by Sale whereof he might raise Money enough to raise a good Army to attempt the recovery of his Kingdoms: and that he would be well assured, that it should be in his power to make that use of it, before he would be engaged in the Treaty: that he had no apprehension of the pressures which would be made in matters of Religion, because, if the Lady did once consent to the Marriage, she would affect nothing but what might advance the recovery of his Dominions; which she would quickly understand any unreasonable Concessions in Religion could ne∣ver” <MILESTONE N="40"/> do.</Q> In a word, his Majesty discover'd enough to let them see that he stood well enough inclined to the Overture it self; which gave them trou∣ble, as a thing which, in many respects, was like to prove very inconvenient.</P>
<P>BUT they were quickly freed from that Apprehension. The Lady carried her self in that manner, on the behalf of the Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> and so offensively to the <HI>French</HI> Court, having given fire her self to the Cannon in the <HI>Bastile</HI> upon the King at the Port S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Antoine,</HI> and done so many blameable things against the <HI>French</HI> King and Queen, that they no sooner heard of this discourse, but they quickly put an end to it; the Cardinal, who was now return'd again, having long resolv'd, that <MILESTONE N="50"/> our King should never owe any part of his Restitution to any coun∣tenance, or assistance, he should receive from <HI>France;</HI> and, from the same conclusion, the like end was put to all Overtures which had con∣cern'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and the other Lady.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="3710"/>
THERE was, shortly after, an unexpected Accident, that seem'd to make some alteration in the affairs of <HI>Christendom;</HI> which many very reasonably believ'd, might have prov'd advantageous to the King. The Parliament, assoon as they had settled their Common-wealth, and had no Enemy they fear'd, had sent Embassadours to their Sister Republick, the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment sent Em∣bassadours to</HI> Holland <HI>to in∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te them to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct Union.</HI> Saint-Johns <HI>being the chief.</HI></NOTE> States of the united Provinces, to invite them to enter into a stricter Al∣liance with them, and, upon the Matter, to be as one Common-wealth; and to have one Interest. They were receiv'd in <HI>Holland</HI> with all imagi∣nable respect, and as great Expressions made, as could be, of an equal de∣sire <MILESTONE N="10"/> that a firm Union might be establish'd between the two Common∣wealths: and, for the forming thereof, Persons were appointed to treat with the Embassadours; which was look'd upon as a matter that would easily succeed, since the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who could have given power∣ful obstructions in such Cases, was now dead, and all those who adher'd to him, discountenanced, and remov'd from places of trust and power in all the Provinces, and his Son an Infant, born after the Death of his Fa∣ther, at the Mercy of the States even for his Support; the two Dowa∣gers, his Mother and Grandmother, having great Joyntures out of the Estate, and the rest being liable to the payment of vast debts. In the <MILESTONE N="20"/> Treaty, <HI>Saint-Johns,</HI> who had the whole trust of the Embassy, being very powerful in the Parliament, and the known confident of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> pressed such a kind of Union as must disunite them from all their other Allies: so that, for the friendship of <HI>England,</HI> they must lose the friendship of other Princes, and yet lose many other Advantages in Trade, which they enjoyed, and which they saw the younger and more powerful Com∣mon-wealth would in a short time deprive them of. This the States could not digest, and used all the ways they could to divert them from insisting upon so unreasonable conditions; and made many large Over∣tures and Concessions, which had never been granted by them to the <MILESTONE N="30"/> greatest Kings, and were willing to quit some Advantages they had en∣joyed by all the Treaties with the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and to yield other considerable benefits which they allways before denied to grant.</P>
<P>BUT this would not satisfy, nor would the Embassadours recede from any particular they had proposed: so that, after some Months stay, during which time they receiv'd many Affronts from some <HI>English,</HI> and from others, they return'd with great Presents from the States, but with∣out <NOTE PLACE="marg">They return without any Effect</NOTE> any effect by the Treaty, or entring into any terms of Alliance, and with the extreme indignation of <HI>Saint-Johns;</HI> which he manifested as∣soon as he return'd to the Parliament; who disdaining likewise to find <MILESTONE N="40"/> themselves undervalued (that is, not valued above all the world besides) presently enter'd upon Counsels how they might discountenance and controle the Trade of <HI>Holland,</HI> and encrease their own.</P>
<P><Q>HEREUPON they made that Act that “inhibits all Foreign Ships <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment there upon make the Act of Na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣gation.</NOTE> from bringing in any Merchandise or Commodities into <HI>England,</HI> but such as were the proceed or growth of their own Country, upon the pe∣nalty” of forfeiture of all such Ships.</Q> This indeed concern'd all other Coun∣tries; but it did, upon the matter, totally suppress all Trade with <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> which had very little Merchandise of the growth of their own Coun∣try, but had used to bring in their Ships the growth of all other King∣doms <MILESTONE N="50"/> in the world; Wine from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Spices from the In∣dies, and all Commodities from all other Countries; which they must now do no more. <Q>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Embassadour expostulated this matter very warmly, “as a breach of Commerce and Amity, which could not con∣sist with the Peace between the two Nations; and that his Masters could”
<PB N="356" REF="3720"/>
not look upon it otherwise than as a Declaration of War.</Q> <Q>The Par¦liament Answer'd him superciliously, “that his Masters might take it in what manner they pleased; but They knew what was best for their own” State, and would not repeal Laws to gratify their Neighbours;</Q> and caused the Act to be executed with the utmost rigour and severity.</P>
<P>THE United Provinces now discern'd, that they had help'd to raise an Enemy that was too powerful for them, and that would not be treated as the Crown had been. However, they could not believe it possible, that in the Infancy of their Republick, and when their Government was manifestly odious to all the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> the People generally weary of the Taxes and Impositions upon the Na∣tion for the support of their Land-Armies, the Parliament would venture to increase those Taxes and Impositions proportionably to maintain a new War at Sea, at so vast an Expence, as could not be avoided; and therefore believ'd that they only made shew of this Courage to amuse and terrify them. However, at the Spring, They set out a Fleet stronger than of course they used to do; which made no impression upon the <HI>English;</HI> who never suspected that the <HI>Dutch</HI> durst enter into a War with them. Be∣sides that they were confident no such Counsel and Resolution could be taken on a suddain, and without their having first Notice of it, they <MILESTONE N="20"/> having several of the States General, and more of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> very devoted to them. And therefore they increased not their expence, but sent out their usual Fleet for the Guard of the Coast at their Season, and with no other Instructions than they had been accustom'd to.</P>
<P><Q>THE Council of the Admiralty of <HI>Holland,</HI> which govern'd the Ma∣ritime <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Orders from the Admiralty in</HI> Holland <HI>to their Fleet,</HI> <Q><HI>“not to strike to the</HI> Eng∣lish.”</Q></NOTE> Affairs, without communication with the States General, gave their Instructions to the Admiral <HI>Van Trump,</HI> “that when he met any of the <HI>English</HI> Ships of War, he should not strike to them, nor shew them any other respect than what they receiv'd from them; and if the <HI>English</HI> expostulated the matter, they should answer frankly, that the <MILESTONE N="30"/> respect they had formerly shew'd upon those Encounters, was because the Ships were the King's, and for the good intelligence they had with the Crown; but they had no reason to continue the same in this altera∣tion of Government, except there were some Stipulation between them to that purpose: and if this Answer did not satisfy, but that force was used towards them, they should defend themselves with their utmost” vigour.</Q> These Instructions were very secret, and never suspected by the <HI>English</HI> Commanders; who had their old Instructions to oblige all Foreign Vessels to strike sail to them; which had never been refused by any Nation. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>IT was about the beginning of <HI>May</HI> in the year 1652, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, consisting of above forty Sail, under the Command of <HI>Van Trump,</HI> rode at Anchor in <HI>Dover</HI> Road, being driven by a strong Wind, as they pretended, from the <HI>Flanders</HI> Coast, when the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, un∣der the Command of <HI>Blake,</HI> of a much less Number, appear'd in view; upon which the <HI>Dutch</HI> weighed Anchor, and put out to Sea, without striking their Flag; which <HI>Blake</HI> observing, caused three Guns to be fired <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The War be∣gun upon thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Account with the</HI> Dutch</NOTE> without any Ball. It was then observ'd, that there was an Express Ketch came, at the very time, from <HI>Holland,</HI> on board their Admiral; and it was then conceiv'd, that he had, by that Express, receiv'd more positive <MILESTONE N="50"/> Orders to Fight: for upon the Arrival of that Express, he tacked about, and bore directly towards the <HI>English</HI> Fleet; and the three Guns were no sooner fired, but, in contempt of the Advertisement, he discharged one single Gun from his Poop, and hung out a red Flag; and came up to
<PB N="357" REF="3730"/>
the <HI>English</HI> Admiral, and gave him a broad side; with which he killed many of his Men, and damaged the Ship. Whereupon, though <HI>Blake</HI> was surprised, as not expecting such an Assault, he deferr'd not to give him the same rude salutation; and so both Fleets were forthwith en∣gaged in a very fierce Encounter; which continued for the space of four hours, till the night parted them, after the loss of much blood on both sides. On the part of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they lost two Ships, whereof one was sunk, and the other taken, with both the Captains, and near two hundred Prisoners. On the <HI>English</HI> side, there were many slain, and more wounded, but no Ship lost, nor Officer of Name. When the <MILESTONE N="10"/> morning appear'd, the <HI>Dutch</HI> were gone to their Coast. And thus the War was enter'd into, before it was suspected in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>WITH what consideration soever the <HI>Dutch</HI> had embarked themselves in this suddain Enterprise, it quickly appear'd they had taken very ill measures of the Peoples Affections. For the News of this conflict was no sooner arriv'd in <HI>Holland,</HI> but there was the most general consterna∣tion, amongst all sorts of Men, that can be imagin'd; and the States themselves were so much troubled at it, that, with great expedition, they dispatched two extraordinary Embassadours into <HI>England;</HI> <Q>by whom <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The States send two Em∣bassadours in∣to</HI> England <HI>a¦bout it.</HI></NOTE> they protested, “that the late unhappy Engagement between the Fleets <MILESTONE N="20"/> of the two Common-wealths, had happen'd without their knowledge, and contrary to the intention of the Lords the States General: that they had receiv'd the fatal tidings of so rash an Attempt, and Action, with amazement, and astonishment; and that they had immediately enter'd into consultation, how they might best close this fresh bleeding Wound, and to avoid the farther Effusion of Christian blood, so much desired by the Enemies of both States: and therefore they most earnest∣ly desired them, by their mutual concurrence in Religion, and by their mutual love of Liberty, that nothing might be done with passion and heat; which would widen the breach; but that they might speedily re∣ceive <MILESTONE N="30"/> such an Answer, that there might be no farther obstruction to the” Trade of both Common-wealths.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To which this Answer was presently return'd to them, “that the civi∣lity <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment's An∣swer to them.</NOTE> which they had allways shew'd towards the States of the United Provinces, was so notorious, that nothing was more strange than the ill return they had made to them: that the extraordinary preparations, which they had made, of a hundred and fifty Ships, without any appa∣rent necessity, and the Instructions which had been given to their Sea Officers, had administer'd too much cause to believe, that the Lords the States General of the United Provinces had a purpose to usurp the known Right which the <HI>English</HI> have to the Seas, and to destroy their <MILESTONE N="40"/> Fleets; which, under the protection of the Almighty, are their Walls and Bulwarks; that so they might be exposed to the invasion of any powerful Enemy: therefore they thought themselves obliged to endea∣vour, by God's Assistance, to seek reparation for the injuries and damage they had already receiv'd, and to prevent the like for the future: How∣ever, they should never be without an intention and desire, that some effectual means might be found to establish a good peace, union, and” right Understanding, between the two Nations.</Q></P>
<P>WITH this haughty Answer they vigorously prosecuted their revenge, <MILESTONE N="50"/> and commanded <HI>Blake</HI> presently to sail to the Northward; it being then the Season of the year for the great Fisheries of the <HI>Dutch</HI> upon the Coasts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Isles of <HI>Orkney</HI> (by the benefit whereof they drive a great part of their Trade over <HI>Europe)</HI> where he now found their multi∣tude
<PB N="358" REF="3740"/>
of fishing Boats, guarded by twelve Ships of War; most of which, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Blake <HI>takes their fishing Busses, and their Guard-Ships.</HI></NOTE> with the fish they had made ready, he brought away with him as good prize.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Blake</HI> was sent to the North, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Ayscue,</HI> being just re∣turn'd from the West Indies, was sent with another part of the Fleet to the South; who, at his very going out, met with thirty Sail of their Mer∣chants between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Calais;</HI> a good part whereof he took, or sunk; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> G. Ayscue <HI>takes or sinks</HI> 20 <HI>Sail of their Merchants: fights the</HI> Dutch <HI>Fleet near</HI> Ply∣mouth.</NOTE> and forced the rest to run on Shore upon the <HI>French</HI> Coast; which is very little better than being taken. From thence he stood Westward; and near <HI>Plymouth,</HI> with thirty Sail of Men of War, he engaged the whole <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, consisting of sixty Ships of War, and thirty Merchants. It was near <MILESTONE N="10"/> four of the Clock in the afternoon when both Fleets begun to engage, so that the night quickly parted them; yet not before two of the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships of War were sunk, and most of the Men lost; the <HI>Dutch</HI> in that Action applying themselves most to spoil the tackling, and sailes of the <HI>English;</HI> in which they had so good success, that the next morning they were not able to give them farther chase, till their sailes and rigging could be repaired. But no day passed without the taking and bringing in ma∣ny and valuable <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships into the Ports of <HI>England;</HI> which, having begun their Voyages before any notice given to them of the War, were making hast home without any fear of their Security: so that, there be∣ing <MILESTONE N="20"/> now no hope of a Peace by the mediation of their Embassadours, who could not prevail in any thing they proposed, they return'd; and the War was proclaim'd on either side, as well as prosecuted.</P>
<P>THE King thought he might very reasonably hope to reap some be∣nefit and advantage from this War, so briskly enter'd upon on both sides; and when he had sate still till the return of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Embassadours from <HI>London,</HI> and that all Treaties were given over, he believ'd it might con∣tribute to his ends, if he made a journey into <HI>Holland,</HI> and made such Propositions upon the place as he might be advised to: but when his Majesty imparted this design to his Friends there, who did really desire <MILESTONE N="30"/> to serve him, he was very warmly disswaded from coming thither; <Q>and assured, “that it was so far from being yet seasonable, that it would more advance a Peace than any thing else that could be proposed; and would, for the present, bring the greatest prejudice to his Sister, and to the af∣fairs” of his Nephew the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that could be imagin'd.</Q></P>
<P>THE King hereupon took a resolution to make an attempt which could do him no harm, if it did not produce the good he desired. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Embassadour then resident at <HI>Paris,</HI> Monsieur <HI>Borrel,</HI> who had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King at</HI> Paris <HI>proposes to Monsieur</HI> Borrel <HI>the</HI> Dutch <HI>Em∣bassadour, that he would joyn his Interest with theirs</HI></NOTE> been Pensioner of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> was very much devoted to the King's Ser∣vice, <MILESTONE N="40"/> having been formerly Embassadour in <HI>England,</HI> and had allways dependence upon the Princes of <HI>Orange</HI> successively. He communicated in all things with great freedom with the Chancellor of the Exchequer; who visited him constantly once a Week, and receiv'd Advertisements, and Advices from him, and the Embassadour frequently came to His lodging. The King, upon conference only with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Chancellor, and enjoyning them secrecy, caused a Paper to be drawn up; <Q>in which he declared, “that he had very good reason to be∣lieve, that there were many Officers and Seamen engaged in the Service of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, who undertook that Service in hope to find a good <MILESTONE N="50"/> opportunity to serve his Majesty; and that, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> were willing to receive him, he would immediately put himself on board their Fleet, without requiring any Command, except of such Ships only, as, upon their notice of his being there, should repair to him out of the Rebel's”
<PB N="359" REF="3750"/>
Fleet:</Q> <Q>by this means, he presumed, “he should be able much to weaken their Naval power, and to raise Divisions in the Kingdom, by which” the <HI>Dutch</HI> would receive benefit and advantage.</Q> Having sign'd this Pa∣per, he sent the Chancellor with it open, to shew to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Embassa∣dour, and to desire him to send it enclosed in his Letter to the States. The Embassadour was very much surprised with it, and made some scruple of sending it, lest he might be suspected to have advised it. For they were extremely jealous of him for his Affection to the King, and for his de∣pendence upon the House of <HI>Orange.</HI> <Q>In the end, he desired “the King would inclose it in a Letter to him, and oblige him to send it to the States” General: which was done accordingly;</Q> and he sent it by the Post to the <MILESTONE N="10"/> States.</P>
<P>THE War had already made the Councils of the States less united than they had been, and the Party that was known to be inclined to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> recover'd courage, and joyn'd with those who were no friends to the War; and, when this Message from the King was read, magnified the King's Spirit in making this Overture, and wish'd that an Answer of very humble thanks and acknowledgement might be return'd to his Ma∣jesty. <Q>They said, “no means ought to be neglected that might abate the” pride and power of the Enemy:</Q> and assoon as the People heard of it, <MILESTONE N="20"/> they thought it reasonable to accept the King's Offer. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it,</HI> who was Pensioner of <HI>Holland,</HI> and had the greatest influence upon their Coun∣sels, had no mind to have any conjunction with the King; which, he fore∣saw, must necessarily introduce the pretences of the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> to whom he was an avow'd and declar'd Enemy. <Q>He told them, “indeed it was a very generous offer of the King; but if they should accept it, they could never recede from his Interest; which, instead of putting an end to the War, of which they were already weary, would make it with∣out end, and would be the ruin of their State: that, whilst they were free from being engaged in any Interest but their own, they might rea∣sonably <MILESTONE N="30"/> hope that both sides would be equally weary of the War, and then a Peace would easily ensue; which they should otherwise put out” of their own power;</Q> so that thanks were return'd to the King for his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Than<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s re∣turn'd to the King by the States, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> proposal laid as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></NOTE> good Will; and they pursued their own method in their Counsels, and were much superior to those who were of another opinion, desiring no∣thing so much, as to make a Peace upon any conditions.</P>
<P>NOR can it appear very wonderful, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> made shew of so much flegme in this Affair, when the very choler and pride of the <HI>French</HI> was, about the same time, so humbled by the Spirit of the <HI>English,</HI> that, though they took their Ships every day, and made them prize, and had <MILESTONE N="40"/> now seised upon their whole Fleet that was going to the relief of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a</HI> French <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> going to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of</HI> Dun∣kirk.</NOTE> (that was then closely besieged by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and by the taking that Fleet, was deliver'd into their hands) yet the <HI>French</HI> would not be pro∣vok'd to be angry with them, or to express any inclination to the King; but sent an Embassadour, which they had not before done, to expostu∣late <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>send an Em∣bassador <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto</HI> England</NOTE> very civilly with the Parliament for having been so unneighbourly, but in truth to desire their friendship upon what terms they pleased; the Cardinal fearing nothing so much, as that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would make such a conjunction with the new Common-wealth, as should disappoint and break all his designs.</P>
<P>THE insupportable losses which the <HI>Dutch</HI> every day sustain'd by the taking their Merchant's Ships, and their Ships of War, and the total ob∣struction of their Trade, broke their hearts, and encreased their factions and divisions at home. All the Seas were cover'd with the <HI>English</HI> Fleets;
<PB N="360" REF="3760"/>
which made no distinctions of Seasons, but were as active in the Winter as the Summer: and engaged the <HI>Dutch</HI> upon any inequality of Number The <HI>Dutch</HI> having been beaten in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> and <HI>Blake</HI> having receiv'd a brush from them in the Month of <HI>December,</HI> in the Month of <HI>February,</HI> the most dangerous season of the Year, They, having appointed a Rendezvous of about one hundred and fifty Merchant Men, sent a Fleet of above one hundred Sail of Men of War to convoy them; and <HI>Blake,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> February <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lake <HI>engages the</HI> Dutch <HI>Fleet, who are beaten</HI></NOTE> with a Fleet much inferior in number, engaged them in a very sharp Bat∣tle from noon till the night parted them: which disposed them to endea∣vour to preserve themselves by flight; but, in the morning, they found that the <HI>English</HI> had attended them so close, that they were engaged again <MILESTONE N="10"/> to fight, and so unprosperously, that, after the loss of above two thousand Men, who were thrown overboard, besides a multitude hurt, they were glad to leave fifty of their Merchant Men to the <HI>English,</HI> that they might make their flight the more securely.</P>
<P>THIS last loss made them send again to the Parliament to desire a Peace; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>send again to the Parlia∣ment for Peace.</HI></NOTE> who rejected the Overture, as they pretended, "for want of formality (for they allways pretended a desire of an honourable Peace) the Address being made only by the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and West<HI>-Friezland,</HI> the States General being at that time not assembled. It was generally believ'd, that this Address from <HI>Holland</HI> was not only with the Approbation, but by <MILESTONE N="20"/> the direction of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who had rather consented to those particu∣lars, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>ne∣ver zealous for this War with the</HI> Dutch, <HI>but go∣vern'd in it by</HI> Saint-Johns.</NOTE> which were naturally like to produce that War, to gratify <HI>Saint-Johns</HI> (who was inseparable from him in all his other Counsels, and was incensed by the <HI>Dutch)</HI> than approv'd the Resolution. And now he found, by the expence of the Engagements had allready passed on both sides, what an insupportable Charge that War must be attended with. Besides, he well discern'd that all Parties, Friends and Foes, Presbyterians, Inde∣pendents, Levellers, were all united as to the carrying on the War; which, he thought, could proceed from nothing, but that the excess of the Ex∣pence <MILESTONE N="30"/> might make it necessary to disband a great part of the Land Army (of which there appear'd no use) to support the Navy; which they could not now be without. Nor had he Authority to place his own Creatures there, all the Officers thereof being nominated and appointed solely by the Parliament: So that when this Address was made by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he set up his whole rest and interest, that it might be well accepted, and a Treaty thereupon enter'd into; which when he could not bring to pass, he laid to heart; and deferr'd not long, as will appear, to take vengeance upon the Parliament with a witness, and by a way they least thought of.</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Cromwell</HI> was exercised with these contradictions and vexa∣tions at home, by the Authority of the Parliament, he found not the <MILESTONE N="40"/> least opposition from abroad. He was more absolute in the other two Kingdoms, more fear'd, and more obey'd, than any King had ever been; and all the Dominions belonging to the Crown, own'd no other subjection than to the Common-wealth of <HI>England.</HI> The Isles of <HI>Guernsey,</HI> and <HI>Jer∣sey,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Guernsey <HI>and</HI> Jersey <HI>had been now reduced S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> George Carteret <HI>de¦fended this as long as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> could, and</HI> E∣lizabeth <HI>Ca∣stle</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Scilly,</HI> were reduced; the former presently after the Battle of <HI>Wor∣cester;</HI> and the other, after the King's return to <HI>Paris;</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Carteret</HI> having well defended <HI>Jersey</HI> as long as he could, and being so over-power'd that he could no longer defend the <HI>Island,</HI> he retired into Castle <HI>Eliza∣beth;</HI> which he had fortified, and provided with all things necessary for a Siege; presuming that, by the care and diligence of the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/> who was Governour thereof, he should receive Supplies of Men and Pro∣visions, as he should stand in need of them; as he might easily have done in spight of any power of the Parliament by Sea, or Land. But it had
<PB N="361" REF="3770"/>
been the principal reason that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had hitherto kept the better Quarter with the Cardinal, lest the bait of those two Islands, which the King could have put into his hands when he would, should tempt him to give his Majesty any Assistance. But the King was so strict and punctual in his care of the Interest of <HI>England,</HI> when he seem'd to be abandon'd by it, that he chose rather to suffer those places of great importance to fall into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s power, than to deposite them, upon any conditions, into <HI>French</HI> hands; which, he knew, would never restore them to the just owner, what obligations soever they enter'd into.</P>
<P>WHEN that Castle had been besieged three Months, and the Enemy <MILESTONE N="10"/> could not approach nearer to plant their Ordnance than, at least, half an <HI>English</HI> Mile, the Sea encompassing it round more than so far from any Land, and it not being possible for any of their Ships to come within such a distance, they brought notwithstanding Mortar-pieces of such an incre∣dible greatness, and such as had never been before seen in this part of the world, that from the highest point of the Hill, near S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hilary's,</HI> they shot Granadoes of a vast bigness into the Castle, and beat down many Houses; and, at last, blow'd up a great Magazine, where most of the provision of Victuals lay; and kill'd many Men. Upon which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Carteret</HI> sent an Express, to give the King an Account of the condition he was in, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> to desire a supply of Men and Provisions; which it being impossible for his Majesty to procure, he sent him Orders to make the best conditions he <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King send<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m Orders to make condi∣tions</NOTE> could; which he shortly after did; and came himself to <HI>Paris,</HI> to give the King a larger information of all that had passed in that Affair; and after∣wards remain'd in <HI>France</HI> under many mortifications, by the power and prosecution of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> till the King's happy Restoration.</P>
<P>ALL the Foreign Plantations had submitted to the Yoke; and indeed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Foreign Plantations also were sub∣dued</NOTE> without any other damage or inconvenience, than the having Citizens and inferior Persons put to govern them, instead of Gentlemen, who had been entrusted by the King in those places. <HI>New-England</HI> had been too much <MILESTONE N="30"/> allied to all the conspiracies and combinations against the Crown, not to be very well pleased that Men of their own Principles prevail'd; and settled a Government themselves were delighted with. The <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Barbadoes <HI>deliver'd up</HI></NOTE> which was much the richest Plantation, was principally inhabited by Men who had retired thither only to be quiet, and to be free from the noise and oppressions in <HI>England,</HI> and without any ill thoughts towards the King; many of them having serv'd him with fidelity and courage, during the War; and, that being ended, made that <HI>Island</HI> their Refuge from farther prosecutions. But having now gotten good Estates there (as it is incredi∣ble to what fortunes Men raised themselves in few years, in that Planta∣tion) <MILESTONE N="40"/> they were more willing to live in subjection to that Government at that distance, than to return into <HI>England,</HI> and be liable to the penalties of their former transgressions; which, upon the Articles of surrender, they were indemnified for: Nor was there any other alteration there, than the removing the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham</HI> (who was, upon many Ac∣counts, odious to the Parliament, as well as by being Governour there by the King's Commission) and putting an inferior mean Man in his place.</P>
<P>MORE was expected from <HI>Virginia;</HI> which was the most Ancient Plan∣tation; and so was thought to be better provided to defend it self, and to be better affected. Upon both which suppositions, and out of confidence in S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>William Berkley,</HI> the Governour thereof, who had industriously invited many Gentlemen, and others, thither as to a place of security, which he could defend against any attempt, and where they might live plentifully, many Persons of condition, and good Officers in the War, had transported
<PB N="362" REF="3780"/>
themselves, with all the Estate they had been able to preserve; with which the honest Governour, for no Man meant better, was so confirm'd in his confidence, that he writ to the King almost inviting him thither, as to a place that wanted nothing. And the truth is, that, whilst the Parliament had nothing else to do, that Plantation in a short time was more improv'd in People and Stock, than it had been from the beginning to that time, and had reduced the <HI>Indians</HI> to very good Neighbourhood. But, alas! they were so far from being in a condition to defend themselves, all their industry having been imploy'd in the making the best Advantage of their particular Plantations, without assigning time or Men to provide for the publick security in building Forts, or any places of retreat, that there no <MILESTONE N="10"/> sooner appear'd two or three Ships from the Parliament, than all thoughts <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> Virginia.</NOTE> of resistance were laid aside. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Berkley,</HI> the Governour, was suffer'd to remain there as a Private Man, upon his own Plantation; which was a better subsistence than he could have found any where else. And in that quiet posture he continued, by the reputation he had with the People, till upon the noise and fame of the King's Restoration, he did as quietly resume the Exercise of his former Commission, and found as ready an obedience. About this time also, <HI>Scilly,</HI> which had been vigorously de∣fended by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenville,</HI> till it wanted all things, was deliver'd up to <MILESTONE N="20"/> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Ayscue.</HI></P>
<P>WE shall not in this place enlarge upon the Affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> (which will be part of the Argument of the next Book) where <HI>Monk</HI> for the pre∣sent govern'd with a Rod of Iron, and at last found no contradiction, or opposition to his good Will and Pleasure. In <HI>Ireland,</HI> if that People had not been prepar'd and ripe for destruction, there had happen'd an altera∣tion which might have given some respite to it, and disposed the Nation to have united themselves under their new Deputy, whom they had them∣selves desired, under all the solemn obligations of obedience. Shortly after the departure of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond, Cromwell</HI>'s Deputy, <HI>Ireton,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="30"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ireton <HI>died in</HI> Limrick <HI>of the Plague</HI></NOTE> had married his Daughter, died in <HI>Limrick</HI> of the Plague; which was gotten into his Army, that was so much weaken'd by it, and there were so great Factions and Divisions among the Officers after his suddain death, that great Advantages might have been gotten by it. His Authority was so absolute, that he was entirely submitted to in all the Civil, as well as Martial Affairs. But his death was thought so little possible, that no pro∣vision had been made for that contingency. So that no Man had Authority to take the Command upon him, till <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s pleasure was farther known; who put the Charge of the Army under <HI>Ludlow,</HI> a Man of a very <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ludlow <HI>suc∣ceeds him in the Charge of the Army▪</HI></NOTE> different temper from the other; but appointed the Civil Government to <MILESTONE N="40"/> run in another chanel, so that there remain'd jealousy and discontent enough still between the Council and the Officers to have shaken a Govern∣ment that was yet no better establish'd.</P>
<P>IRETON, of whom we have had too much occasion to speak formerly, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r of</HI> Ireton.</NOTE> was of a melancholick, reserv'd, dark Nature, who communicated his thoughts to very few; so that, for the most part, he resolv'd alone, but was never diverted from any resolution he had taken; and he was thought often by his obstinacy to prevail over <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself, and to extort his concurrence contrary to his own inclinations. But that proceeded only from his dissembling less; for he was never reserv'd in the owning and <MILESTONE N="50"/> communicating his worst and most barbarous purposes; which the other allways conceal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and disavow'd. Hitherto their concurrence had been very natural, since they had the same ends and designs. It was generally conceiv'd by those who had the opportunity to know them both very well,
<PB N="363" REF="3790"/>
that <HI>Ireton</HI> was a Man so radically averse from Monarchy, and so fixt to a Republick Government, that, if he had liv'd, he would either, by his counsel and credit, have prevented those excesses in <HI>Cromwell,</HI> or publick∣ly opposed and declared against them, and carried the greatest part of the Army with him; and that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who best knew his nature, and his temper, had therefore carried him into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and left him there, that he might be without his counsels or importunities, when he should find it necessary to put off his Mask, and to act that part which he foresaw it would be requisite to do. Others thought, his parts lay more towards Civil Affairs; and were fitter for the modelling that Government, which <MILESTONE N="10"/> his heart was set upon (being a Scholar, conversant in the Law, and in all those Authors who had expressed the greatest animosity and malice against the Regal Government) than for the conduct of an Army to support it; his Personal Courage being never reckon'd among his other Abilities.</P>
<P>WHAT Influence soever his Life might have had upon the future transactions, certain it is, his Death had none upon the State of <HI>Ireland</HI> to the King's Advantage. The Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard</HI> left no way unat∣tempted <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion of the Marquis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> that might apply the visible strength, and power of the <HI>Irish</HI> Na∣tion, to the preservation of themselves, and to the support of the King's Government. He sent out his Orders and Warrants for the Levying of <MILESTONE N="20"/> new Men, and to draw the old Troops together, and to raise Money: but few Men could be got together, and when they were Assembled, they could not stay together for want of Money to pay them: so that he could never get a Body together to march towards the Enemy; and if he did prevail with them to march a whole day with him, he found, the next morning, that half of them were run away. And it quickly appear'd, that they had made those ample Vows and Protestations, that they might be rid of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> without any purpose of obeying the other. The greatest part of the Popish Clergy, and all the <HI>Irish</HI> of <HI>Ulster,</HI> had no mind to have any relation to the <HI>English</HI> Nation, and as little to return to <MILESTONE N="30"/> their obedience to the Crown. They blamed each other for having de∣serted the Nuntio, and thought of nothing but how they might get some Foreign Prince to take them into his Protection. They first chose a Com∣mittee, <HI>Plunket</HI> and <HI>Brown,</HI> two Lawyers, who had been eminent Con∣ductors of the Rebellion from the beginning, and Men of good parts, and joyn'd others with them, who were in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flanders.</HI> <Q>Then they moved the Lord Deputy, to send these Gentlemen into <HI>Flanders,</HI> “to in∣vite the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> to assist them with Armes, Money, and Am∣munition, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> undertaking to have good Intelligence from thence, that the Duke (who was known to wish well to the King) was well prepared to <MILESTONE N="40"/> receive their desire, and resolv'd, out of his Affection to the King, to en∣gage himself cordially in the defence of that Catholick Kingdom, his” Zeal to that Religion being known to be very great.</Q></P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard</HI> had no opinion of the Expedient, or that the Duke would engage himself on the behalf of a People who had so little reputation in the world; and therefore refused to give any Commis∣sion to those Gentlemen, or to any other to that purpose, without first re∣ceiving the King's Order, or at least the advice of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who was known to be safely arriv'd in <HI>France.</HI> But that was look'd upon as delay, which their condition could not bear, and the doubting the truth <MILESTONE N="50"/> of the intelligence, and information of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI>'s being will∣ing to undertake their Relief, was imputed to want of good will to receive it. And then all the Libels, and Scandals, and Declarations, which had been published against the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> were now renew'd, with

equal malice and virulency, against the Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard;</HI> <Q>and they declared, “that God would never bless his wither'd hand, which had all∣ways concurr'd with <HI>Ormond</HI> in the prosecution, and persecution of the Catholicks Confederates from the beginning of their Engagement for the defence of their Religion; and that he had still had more conversa∣tion with Hereticks than with Catholicks: that he had refused allways to submit to the Pope's Authority; and had treated his Nuntio with less respect than was due from any good Catholick; and that all the Catho∣licks who were cherished or countenanced by him, were of the same” Faction.</Q> In the end, he could not longer resist the importunity of the Assembly of the Confederate Catholicks (which was again brought toge∣ther) <MILESTONE N="10"/> and of the Bishops and Clergy that govern'd the other; but gave his consent to send the same Persons they recommended to him; and gave them his Credentials to the Duke of <HI>Lorraine;</HI> <Q>but required them “pun∣ctually to observe his own Instructions, and not to presume to depart” from them in the least degree.</Q> <Q>Their Instructions were, “to give the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> notice of their Arrival; and to shew him their In∣structions;”</Q> and to conclude nothing without his positive Advice; who, he well knew, would communicate all with the Queen; <Q>and that like∣wise, “when they came into <HI>Flanders,</HI> they should advise with such of <MILESTONE N="20"/> the King's Council as should be there, and proceed in all things as they” should direct.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT Instructions soever the Lord Deputy prescribed to them, the Commissioners receiv'd others from the Council and Assembly of their Clergy, which they thought more to the purpose, and resolv'd to follow; by which they were authorized to yield to any conditions which might prevail with the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> to take them into his Protection, and to engage him in their defence, even by delivering all they had of the Kingdom into his hands. Though they landed in <HI>France,</HI> they gave no notice of their business or their arrival to the Queen, or to the Marquis of <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Ormond;</HI> but prosecuted their journey to <HI>Brussels,</HI> and made their Ad∣dress, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commissioners sent to him to</HI> Brussels.</NOTE> with all secrecy, to the Duke of <HI>Lorraine.</HI> There were, at the same time, at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> the Chancellor of the Ex∣chequer (who was newly return'd from his Embassy in <HI>Spain)</HI> and Secre∣tary <HI>Nicholas;</HI> all three had been of the King's Council; to neither of whom they so much as gave a visit. And though the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> during this time, passed through <HI>Brussels,</HI> in his journey to <HI>Paris;</HI> they imparted not their Negotiations to his Highness.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> had a very good mind to get footing in <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> where, he was sure, there wanted no Men to make Armies enough, <MILESTONE N="40"/> which he thought were not like to want Courage to defend their Country and Religion. <Q>And the Commissioners very frankly offer'd “to deliver up <HI>Galloway,</HI> and all the places which were in their possession, into his hands, with the remainder of the Kingdom, assoon as it could be re∣duced;”</Q> and to obey him absolutely as their Prince. But he, as a reserve to decline the whole, if it appear'd to be a design fuller of difficulty than he then apprehended, discover'd much of his Affection to the King, <Q>and his resolution “not to accept any thing that was proposed, without his” Majesty's privity and full approbation.</Q> But in the mean time, and till that might be procured, he was content to send the Abbot of S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Cathe∣rine</HI>'s, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke sends an Ab∣bot into</HI> Ire∣land <HI>to be in∣form'd of the State of it.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> a <HI>Lorrainer,</HI> and a Person principally trusted by him, as his Embassa∣dour into <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be inform'd of the true State of that Kingdom, and what real strength the Confederate Catholicks were possessed of, and at what Unity among themselves. With him he sent about three or four
<PB N="365" REF="3810"/>
thousand Pistoles, to supply their present Necessities, and some Armes and Ammunition. The Duke writ to the Lord Deputy the Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> as the King's Governour, and the Person by whose Autho∣rity all those Propositions had been made to him by the Commissioners.</P>
<P>THE Abbot upon his Arrival (though he was civilly receiv'd) quickly found, that the Marquis knew nothing of what the Commissioners had proposed or offer'd; and would by no means, so much as enter upon any Treaty with him; <Q>but disavow'd all that they had said or done, with much vehemence, and with a Protestation, “that he would cause their” <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marquis renounces any consent to the Treaty.</NOTE> heads to be cut off, if they return'd, or came into his hands.</Q> And the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Marquis did, at the same time, write very large Letters both to the King, and the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> of their presumption and wicked∣ness; <Q>and very earnestly desired, “that they might be imprison'd, and” kept till they might undergo a just Tryal.</Q></P>
<P>AS the Marquis expressed all possible indignation, so many of the Ca∣tholick Nobility, and even some of their Clergy, who never intended to withdraw their Loyalty from the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> how weakly soever they had manifested it, indeed all the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation, but those of <HI>Ulster,</HI> who were of the old Septs, were wonderfully scandalized to find that all their strength was to be deliver'd presently up into the possession of a Foreign Prince; upon whose good nature only, it must be presumed that <MILESTONE N="20"/> he would hereafter restore it to the King. It was now time for the Popish Bishops, and their Confederates, to make good what had been offer'd by the Commissioners with their Authority; which though they thought not sit to own, they used all their endeavours now in procuring to have it consented to, and ratified. <Q>They very importunately advised, and pressed the Lord Deputy, “to confirm what had been offer'd, as the only visible means to preserve the Nation, and a Root out of which the King's Right” might again spring and grow up:</Q> and when they found, that he was so far from yielding to what they desired, that, if he had power, he would proceed against them with the utmost severity for what they had done, <MILESTONE N="30"/> that he would no more give Audience to the Embassadour, and remov'd from the place where they were, to his own House and Castle at <HI>Portumny,</HI> to be secure from their importunity or violence, they barefaced own'd all that the Commissioners had propounded, <Q>“as done by their Order, who” could make it good;</Q> <Q>and desired the Embassadour “to enter into a Trea∣ty” with them;</Q> <Q>and declared “that they would sign such Articles, with” which the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> should be well satisfied.</Q> They undervalued the power of the Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> as not able to oppose any agree∣ment they should make, nor able to make good any thing he should pro∣mise himself, without Their Assistance. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THE Embassadour was a wise Man, and of flegme enough; and though he heard all they would say, and receiv'd any Propositions they would give him in writing, yet he quickly discern'd, that they were so unskilful as to the managery of any great design, and so disjoynted among themselves, that they could not be depended upon to any purpose; and excused him∣self from entring upon any new Treaty with them, as having no Commis∣sion to treat but with the Lord Deputy. <Q>But he told them, “he would de∣liver all that they had, or would propose to him, to the Duke his Master; who, he presum'd, would speedily return his Answer, and proceed with” <MILESTONE N="50"/> their Commissioners in such a manner as would be grateful to them.</Q> So <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Abb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> turns to the Duke, where∣upon the Duke gi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues over the Negotiat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on▪</NOTE> he return'd in the same Ship that brought him, and gave the Duke such an Account of his Voyage, and that People, that put an end to that Negotiation; which had been enter'd into, and prosecuted, with less
<PB N="366" REF="3820"/>
wariness, circumspection, and good husbandry, than that Prince was ac∣custom'd to use.</P>
<P>WHEN the Embassadour was gone, they prosecuted the Deputy, with all Reproaches of betraying and ruining his Country; and had several de∣signs upon his Person, and communicated whatever Attempt was resolv'd to the Enemy: yet there were many of the Nobility and Gentry that con∣tinued firm, and adhered to him very faithfully; which defended his Person from any Violence they intended against him, but could not secure him against their Acts of Treachery, nor keep his Counsels from being betray'd. After the Defeat of <HI>Worcester</HI> was known and publish'd, they less consider'd all they did; and every one thought he was to provide for his own security <MILESTONE N="10"/> that way that seem'd most probable to him; <Q>and whosoever was most in∣tent upon that, put on a new face, and application to the Deputy, and loud∣ly urged “the necessity of uniting themselves for the publick safety, which” was desperate any other way:</Q> whilst in truth every Man was negotiating for his own indemnity with <HI>Ludlow</HI> (who commanded the <HI>English)</HI> or for leave to transport Regiments; which kept the Soldiers together, as if they had been the Deputy's Army.</P>
<P>THE Deputy had a suspicion of a fellow, who was observ'd every day to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Clanrickard <HI>discovers a correspondence managed by a Fryar between the Popish</HI> Iish <HI>Clergy and</HI> Ludlow.</NOTE> go out, and return'd not till the next; and appointed an Officer of trust, with some Horse, to watch him, and search him; which they did; and <MILESTONE N="20"/> found about him a Letter, which contain'd many Reproaches against the Marquis, and the Intelligence of many particulars; which the Messenger was carrying to <HI>Ludlow.</HI> It was quickly discover'd that the Letter was written by one Father <HI>Cohogan,</HI> a Franciscan Fryar in <HI>Galloway;</HI> where the Deputy then was; but much of the Intelligence was such as could not be known by him, but must come from some who were in the most pri∣vate consultations. The Deputy caused the Fryar to be imprison'd, and resolv'd to proceed exemplarily against him, after he had first discover'd his Complices. The Fryar confessed the Letter to be of his writing, but <MILESTONE N="30"/> refused to answer to any other Question; and demanded his Privilege of a Church-Man, and not to be tried by the Deputy's Order. <Q>The Conclusion was, the Popish Bishops caused him to be taken out of the Prison; and sent to the Deputy, “that if he would send to them his Evidence against the Fryar, who was an Ecclesiastical Person, they would take care that” justice should be done.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Proceeding convinced the Deputy, that he should not be able to do the King any service in that Company; nor durst he stay longer in that Town, lest they should make their own Peace by delivering up him and the Town together; which they would have made no scruple to have done <MILESTONE N="40"/> From that time he remov'd from place to place, not daring to lodge twice in the same place together, lest he should be betray'd; and sometimes without any Accommodations: so that, not having been accustom'd to those hardships, he contracted those diseases which he could never reco∣ver. In this manner he continued till he receiv'd Commands from the King. For assoon as he had advertisement of the King's Arrival at <HI>Paris,</HI> and it was very evident by the behaviour of the <HI>Irish,</HI> that they would be no more applied to the King's Service under His Command than under the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s, he sent the Earl of <HI>Castle-haven</HI> (who had been <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He sends the Earl of</HI> Castle∣haven <HI>to give an account of all to the King</HI></NOTE> formerly a General of the Confederate Catholicks, and remain'd with great <MILESTONE N="50"/> constancy with the Marquis of <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> as long as there was any hope) to the King, with so particular an account, under his own hand of all that had passed, from the time that he had receiv'd his Commission from the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> that it even contain'd almost a Diary, in which he
<PB N="367" REF="3830"/>
made so lively a description of the proceedings of the <HI>Irish,</HI> of their Over∣tures to the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and of their several tergiversations and treacheries towards him, that any Man might discern, especially they who knew the generosity of the Marquis, his Nature, and his custom of having, that he had submitted to a life very uncomfortable and melan∣cholick; and desired his Majesty's leave that he might retire, and procure a Pass to go into <HI>England;</HI> where he had some Estate of his own, and ma∣ny Friends, who would not suffer him to starve; which his Majesty made <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King sends <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> leave to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> hast to send to him, with as great a Testimony of his gracious Acceptation of his Service, and Affection, as his singular merit deserv'd. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THEREUPON the Marquis sent to <HI>Ludlow</HI> for a Pass to go into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and render himself to the Parliament; which he presently sent him; and so the Marquis transported himself to <HI>London;</HI> where he was civilly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> gets a Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s from</HI> Ludlow <HI>and goes into</HI> England, <HI>and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI></NOTE> treated by all Men, as a Man who had many Friends, and could have no Enemies but those who could not be Friends to any. But by the Infirmi∣ties he had contracted in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by those severe fatigues and distresses he had been exposed to, he liv'd not to the end of a year; and had resolv'd, upon the recovery of any degree of health, to have transported himself to the King, and attended his fortune. He left behind him so full a Relation of all material passages, as well from the beginning of that Rebellion, as <MILESTONE N="20"/> during the time of his own Administration, that I have been the less par∣ticular in the Accounts of what passed in the transactions of that King∣dom, presuming that more exact work of His will, in due time, be com∣municated to the World.</P>
<P>THE Affairs of the three Nations being in this posture at the end of the year 1652, and there being new Accidents, and Alterations of a very ex∣traordinary Nature, in the year following, which were attended with much variety of Success, though not with that benefit to the King as might have been expected naturally from those emotions, We shall here conclude this Book, and reserve the other for the Next. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AD not God reserv'd the Deliverance and Re∣storation of the King to Himself, and resolv'd to accomplish it when there appear'd least hope of it, and least worldly means to bring it to pass; there happen'd at this time another very great Alteration in <HI>England,</HI> that, together with the continuance of the War with <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> and Affronts every day offer'd to <HI>France,</HI> might very reasonably have administer'd great hopes to the King of a speedy change of Go∣vernment <MILESTONE N="10"/> there. From the time of the defeat at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and the re∣duction of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> to perfect obedience, <HI>Cromwell</HI> did not find the Parliament so supple to observe his Orders, as he expected they would have been. The Presbyterian Party, which he had discounte∣nanced all he could, and made his Army of the Independent Party, were bold in contradicting him in the House, and crossing all his designs in the City, and exceedingly inveighed against the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icence that was pra∣cticed in Religion, by the several factions of Independents, Anabaptists, and the several Species of these; who contemn'd all Magistrates, and the Laws establish'd. All these, how contradictory soever to one an∣other, <HI>Cromwell</HI> cherished and protected, that he might not be overrun by the Presbyterians; of whom the time was not yet come that he
<PB N="372" REF="3860"/>
could make use: yet he seem'd to shew much respect to some principal Preachers of that Party; and consulted much with them, how the distempers in Religion might be composed.</P>
<P>THOUGH he had been forward enough to enter upon the War of <HI>Holland,</HI> that so there might be no proposition made for the disband∣ing any part of his Army, which otherwise could not be prevented, yet he found the expence of it was so great, that the Nation could never bear that addition of burthen to the other of Land Forces; which how apparent soever, he saw the Parliament so fierce for the carrying on that War, that they would not hearken to any reasonable Conditions of Peace; which the <HI>Dutch</HI> appear'd most sollicitous to make upon any <MILESTONE N="10"/> terms. But that which troubled him most, was the jealousy that his own party of Independents, and other Sectaries, had contracted against him: that Party, that had advanced him to the height he was at, and made him superior to all opposition, even his beloved <HI>Vane,</HI> thought his Power and Authority to be too great for a Common-wealth, and that He, and his Army, had not dependence enough upon, or submission to the Parliament. So that he found those who had exalted him, now most sollicitous to bring him lower; and he knew well enough what any diminution of his Power and Authority must quickly be attended with. He observ'd, that those his old Friends very frankly united them∣selves <MILESTONE N="20"/> with His and Their old Enemies, the Presbyterians, for the pro∣secution of the War with <HI>Holland,</HI> and obstructing all the Overtures towards Peace; which must, in a short time, exhaust the Stock, and consequently disturb any settlement in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>IN this perplexity he resorts to his old remedy, his Army; and again <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>erects another Council of Of∣ficers; who expostulate with the Par∣liament about their Arrears, and their own Dissolution.</HI></NOTE> erects another Council of Officers, who, under the Style, first, of Peti∣tions, and then, of Remonstrances, interposed in whatsoever had any relation to the Army; <Q>used great importunity for “the Arrears of their pay; that they might not be compelled to take free Quarter upon their fellow Subjects, who already paid so great Contributions and <MILESTONE N="30"/> Taxes; which they were well assured, if well managed, would abun∣dantly” defray all the Charges of the War, and of the Government.</Q> The sharp Answers the Parliament gave to their Addresses, and the repre∣hensions for their presumption in medling with matters above them, gave the Army new matter to reply to; <Q>and put them in mind of some former professions they had made, “that they would be glad to be eased of the Burthen of their imployment; and that there might be succes∣sive” Parliaments to undergo the same trouble They had done.</Q> <Q>They therefore desired them, “that they would remember how many years they had sate; and though they had done great things, yet it was a <MILESTONE N="40"/> great injury to the rest of the Nation, to be utterly excluded from bearing any part in the Service of their Country, by their ingrossing the whole power into Their hands; and thereupon besought them, that they would settle a Council for the administration of the Govern∣ment during the Interval, and then dissolve themselves, and Summon” a new Parliament;</Q> <Q>which, they told them, “would be the most po∣pular” Action they could perform.</Q></P>
<P>THESE Addresses in the Name of the Army, being confidently de∣liver'd by some Officers of it, and as confidently seconded by others who were Members of the House, it was thought necessary, that they should <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment debate about the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</NOTE> receive a solemn debate, to the end that when the Parliament had de∣clared its resolution and determination, all Persons might be obliged
<PB N="373" REF="3870"/>
to acquiesce therein, and so there would be an end put to all Addresses of that kind.</P>
<P>THERE were many Members of the House, who either from the justice and reason of the Request, or seasonably to comply with the sense of the Army, to which they foresaw they should be at last compelled to submit, seem'd to think it necessary, for abating the great Envy, which was confessedly against the Parliament throughout the Kingdom, that they should be dissolv'd, to the end the People might make a new Ele∣ction of such Persons as they thought fit to trust with their Liberty and Property, and whatsoever was dearest to them. <Q>But M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Martyn</HI> told <NOTE PLACE="marg">Harry Mar¦tyn<HI>'s App<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣tion of the sto∣ry of</HI> Moses <HI>to this purpose</HI></NOTE> them, “that he thought they might find the best Advice from the Scri∣pture, <MILESTONE N="10"/> what they were to do in this particular: that when <HI>Moses</HI> was found upon the River, and brought to <HI>Pharoah</HI>'s Daughter, she took care that the Mother might be found out, to whose care he might be committed to be nursed; which succeeded very happily. He said, their Common-wealth was yet an Infant, of a weak growth, and a very tender constitution; and therefore his opinion was, that no body could be so fit to nurse it, as the Mother who brought it forth; and that they should not think of putting it under any other hands, until it” had obtained more years and vigour.</Q> <Q>To which he added, “that they <MILESTONE N="20"/> had another Infant too under their hands, the War with <HI>Holland;</HI> which had thrived wonderfully under Their Conduct; but he much doubted that it would be quickly strangled, if it were taken out of their” care who had hitherto govern'd it.</Q></P>
<P>THESE Reasons prevailed so far, that, whatsoever was said to the contrary, it was determin'd, that the Parliament would not yet think <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment deter∣min'd, that they would not yet think of Dissolving.</NOTE> of Dissolving, nor would take it well, that any Persons should take the presumption any more to make Overtures to them of that Nature, which was not fit for private and particular Persons to meddle with: and to put a Seasonable stop to any farther presumption of that kind, <MILESTONE N="30"/> they appointed a Committee <Q>“speedily to prepare an Act of Parliament for the filling up of their House; and by which, it should be declared to be High Treason, for any Man to propose, or contrive the chang∣ing” of the present Government settled, and established.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Bill being prepared by the Committee, they resolv'd to pass it with all possible expedition. So <HI>Cromwell</HI> clearly discern'd, that by this means they would never be perswaded to part with that Authority and Power, which was so profitable, and so pleasant to them: yet the Army declared they were not satisfied with the Determination, and con∣tinued their Applications to the same purpose, or to others as unagree∣able <MILESTONE N="40"/> to the sense of the House; and did all they could to insuse the same Spirit into all the parts of the Kingdom, to make the Parliament odious, as it was already very abundantly; and <HI>Cromwell</HI> was well pleased that the Parliament should express as much prejudice against the Army.</P>
<P>ALL things being thus prepared, <HI>Cromwell</HI> thought this a good sea∣son to expose these Enemies of Peace to the indignation of the Nation; which, he knew, was generally weary of the War, and hoped, if that were at an end, that they should be eased of the greatest part of their Contributions, and other Impositions: thereupon, having adjusted all things with the Chief Officers of the Army, who were at his Devotion, <MILESTONE N="50"/> in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> that was in the year 1653, he came into the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>and his Of∣ficers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Parlia∣ment</HI></NOTE> House of Parliament in a morning when it was sitting, attended with the Officers, who were likewise Members of the House, and told them,
<Q><PB N="374" REF="3880"/>
“that he came thither to put an end to their Power and Authority; which they had managed so ill, that the Nation could be no other∣wise preserv'd than by their Dissolution; which he advised them,” without farther Debate, quietly to submit unto.</Q></P>
<P>THEREUPON another Officer, with some Files of Musqueteers, en∣ter'd into the House, and stay'd there till all the Members walked out; <HI>Cromwell</HI> reproaching many of the Members by Name, as they went out of the House, with their Vices and Corruptions, and amongst the rest, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane</HI> with his breach of Faith and Corruption; and having given the Mace to an Officer to be safely kept, he caused the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Doors to be lock'd up; and so dissolv'd that Assembly, which had sat al∣most thirteen years, and under whose Name he had wrought so much mischief, and reduced three Kingdoms to his own entire obedience and subjection, without any example or Precedent in the Christian World that could raise his Ambition to such a presumptuous Undertaking, and without any rational dependence upon the friendship of one Man who had any other Interest to advance his designs, but what he had given him by preferring him in the War.</P>
<P>WHEN He had thus prosperously passed this <HI>Rubicon,</HI> he lost no time in publishing a Declaration of the grounds and reasons of his Proceeding, <MILESTONE N="20"/> for the satisfaction of the People: <Q>in which he put them in mind, “how miraculously God had appear'd for them in reducing <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land</HI> to so great a degree of Peace, and <HI>England</HI> to a perfect quiet; whereby the Parliament had opportunity to give the People the har∣vest of all their Labour, Blood, and Treasure, and to settle a due Li∣berty in reference to Civil and Spiritual things, whereunto they were obliged by their Duty, and those great and wonderful things God had wrought for them. But that they had made so little progress towards this good end, that it was matter of much grief to the good People of the Land, who had thereupon apply'd themselves to the Army, ex∣pecting Redress by their means; who, being very unwilling to med∣dle <MILESTONE N="30"/> with the Civil Authority, thought fit that some Officers, who were Members of the Parliament, should move, and desire the Par∣liament to proceed vigorously in reforming what was amiss in the Common-wealth, and in settling it upon a foundation of Justice and Righteousness: that they found this, and some other Endeavours they had used, produced no good effect, but rather an aversness to the things themselves, with much bitterness and aversion to the People of God, and his Spirit acting in them: insomuch as the Godly Party in the Army was now become of no other Use, than to countenance the <MILESTONE N="40"/> ends of a corrupt Party, that desired to perpetuate themselves in the supreme Government of the Nation: that, for the obviating those Evils, the Officers of the Army had obtain'd several meetings with some Members of the Parliament, to consider what remedies might properly be apply'd; but that it appear'd very evident unto them, that the Parliament, by want of Attendance of many of their Mem∣bers, and want of Integrity in others who did attend, would never answer those ends, which God, his People, and the whole Nation, ex∣pected from them. But that this Cause, which God had so greatly blessed, must needs languish under their hands; and by degrees be <MILESTONE N="50"/> lost, and the Lives, Liberties, and Comforts of his People, be deli∣ver'd into their Enemies hands. All which being seriously and sadly consider'd by the honest People of the Nation, as well as by the Army,

it seem'd a Duty incumbent upon them, who had seen so much of the power and presence of God, to consider of some effectual means, where∣by to establish Righteousness and Peace in these Nations: that, after much Debate, it had been judged necessary, that the supreme Govern∣ment should be, by the Parliament, devolv'd for a time upon known Persons, fearing God, and of approv'd Integrity, as the most hopeful way to countenance all God's People, preserve the Law, and admini∣ster Justice impartially; hoping thereby, that People might forget Monarchy, and understand their true Interest in the election of suc∣cessive Parliaments, and so the Government might be settled upon a right basis, without hazard to this glorious Cause, or necessity to keep <MILESTONE N="10"/> up Armies for the defence thereof: that being resolv'd, if possible, to decline all extraordinary Courses, they had prevailed with about twen∣ty Members of the Parliament to give them a conference; with whom they debated the justice and necessity of that Proposition; but found them of so contrary an opinion, that they insisted upon the continuance of the present Parliament, as it was then constituted, as the only way to bring those good things to pass which they seem'd to desire: that they insisted upon this with so much vehemence, and were so much transported with passion, that they caused a Bill to be prepared for the <MILESTONE N="20"/> perpetuating this Parliament, and investing the supreme power in themselves. And for the preventing the consummation of this Act, and all the sad and evil consequences, which, upon the grounds thereof, must have ensued, and whereby, at one blow, the Interest of all ho∣nest Men, and of this glorious Cause, had been in danger to be laid in the dust, they had been necessitated (though with much repugnance)” to put an end to the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>THERE needs not be any other description of the temper of the Na∣tion at that time, than the remembring that the dissolution of that Body of Men, who had reign'd so long over the three Nations, was gene∣rally very grateful and acceptable to the People, how unusual soever <MILESTONE N="30"/> the circumstances thereof had been; and that this Declaration, which was not only subscrib'd by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Council of Officers, but was own'd by the Admirals at Sea, and all the Captains of Ships, and by the Commanders of all the Land Forces in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> was look'd upon as very reasonable; and the Declaration, that issued thereupon, by which the People were required to live peacea∣bly, and quietly to submit themselves to the Government of the Coun∣cil of State, which should be nominated by the General, until such a time as a Parliament, consisting of Persons of approv'd fidelity and ho∣nesty, <MILESTONE N="40"/> could meet, and take upon them the Government of those Na∣tions, found an equal submission, and obedience.</P>
<P>THE Method he pursued afterwards, for the composing a Govern∣ment, by first putting it into a most ridiculous Confusion, and by de∣vesting himself of all pretences to Authority, and putting what he had no title to keep into the hands of Men so well chosen, that they should shortly after delegate the power in form of Law to him for the pre∣servation of the Nation, was not less admirable; <Q>and puts me in mind of what <HI>Seneca</HI> said of <HI>Pompey,</HI> “that he had brought the People of <HI>Rome</HI> to that pass, by magnifying their power and authority, <HI>ut salvus esse”</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>non possit nisi beneficio servitutis.</HI></Q> And if <HI>Cromwell</HI> had not now made himself a Tyrant, all Bonds being broken, and the universal Guilt diverting all inclinations to return to the King's obedience, they must
<PB N="376" REF="3900"/>
have perish'd together in such a confusion, as would rather have ex∣posed them as a Prey to Foreigners, than disposed them to the only rea∣sonable way for their preservation; there being no Man that durst men∣tion the King, or the old form of Government.</P>
<P>IT was upon the twentieth of <HI>April</HI> that the Parliament had been dissolv'd; and though <HI>Cromwell</HI> found that the People were satis∣fied in it, and the Declaration publish'd thereupon, yet he knew, it would be necessary to provide some other visible power to settle the Go∣vernment, than the Council of Officers; all whom he was not sure he should be able long entirely to govern, many of them having clear other Notions of a Republick than he was willing <HI>England</HI> should be <MILESTONE N="10"/> brought to. A Parliament was still a name of more veneration than any other Assembly of Men was like to be, and the contempt the last was fallen into, was like to teach the next to behave it self with more dis∣cretion. However the Ice was broken for dissolving them, when they should do otherwise; yet he was not so well satisfied in the general temper, as to trust the Election of them to the humour and inclination of the People.</P>
<P>HE resolv'd therefore to choose them himself, that he might with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>and his Of∣ficers choose a Parliament.</HI></NOTE> the more Justice unmake them when he should think fit; and with <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Advice of his Council of Officers, for he made yet no other Council of State, he made choice of a number of Men consisting of above one hundred Persons, who should meet as a Parliament to settle the Go∣vernment of the Nation. It can hardly be believ'd that so wild a No∣tion should fall into any Man's imagination, that such a People should be fit to contribute towards any settlement, or that from their Actions any thing could result, that might advance his particular design. <Q>Yet upon the view and consideration of the Persons made choice of, many did conclude, “that he had made his own scheme entirely to himself; and though he communicated it with no Man that was known, con∣cluded <MILESTONE N="30"/> it the most natural way to ripen, and produce the Effects, it did” afterwards, to the end he proposed to himself.</Q></P>
<P>THERE were amongst them divers of the Quality and degree of Gen∣tlemen, and who had Estates, and such a proportion of credit and re∣putation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conditions and Qualities of the Persons nominated.</NOTE> as could consist with the guilt they had contracted. But much the Major part of them consisted of inferior Persons, of no Quality, or Name, Artificers of the meanest Trades, known only by their gifts in Praying and Preaching; which was now practised by all degrees of Men, but Scholars, throughout the Kingdom. In which number, that there may be a better judgement made of the rest, it will not be amiss to <MILESTONE N="40"/> name one, from whom that Parliament it self was afterwards denomi∣nated, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>From one of the Members, this was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣named</HI> Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e-God But <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one<HI>'s Par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI></NOTE> who was <HI>Praise-God</HI> (that was his Christian Name) <HI>Barebone,</HI> a Leather-seller in <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> from whom (he being an eminent Speaker in it) it was afterwards call'd <HI>Praise-God Barebone</HI>'s Parliament. In a word they were generally a pack of weak senseless Fellows, fit only to bring the Name, and Reputation of Parliaments, lower than it was yet.</P>
<P>IT was fit these new Men should be brought together by some new way: and a very new way it was; <Q>for <HI>Cromwell</HI> by his Warrants, di∣rected <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Warrant t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meet</HI> July 4</NOTE> to every one of them, telling them “of the necessity of dissolving the late Parliament, and of an equal necessity, that the Peace, Safety, <MILESTONE N="50"/> and good Government of the Common-wealth should be provided for, and therefore that he had, by the Advice of his Council of Officers, nominated divers Persons fearing God, and of approv'd fidelity and
<PB N="377" REF="3910"/>
honesty, to whom the great Charge and Trust of so weighty Affairs was to be committed, and that having good assurance of their love to, and courage for God, and the Interest of his Cause, and the good Peo∣ple” of this Common-wealth;</Q> <Q>he concluded in these words, “I <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> Captain General and Commander in Chief of all the Forces raised, or to be raised within this Common-wealth, do hereby sum∣mon and require you personally to be, and appear at the Council Cham∣ber at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> upon the fourth day of <HI>July</HI> next, then and there to take upon you the said Trust. And you are hereby call'd, and ap∣pointed” to serve as a Member of the County of <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Upon this wild <MILESTONE N="10"/> Summons, the Persons so nominated appear'd at the Council-Chamber upon the fourth of <HI>July,</HI> which was near three Months after the Disso∣lution of the former Parliament.</P>
<P><Q>CROMWELL with his Council of Officers was ready to receive them, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>speaks to them, and delivers them an In∣strument for their Autho∣rity</HI></NOTE> and made them a long discourse of “the fear of God, and the honour” due to his Name, full of Texts of Scripture;</Q> <Q>and remember'd “the wonderful Mercies of God to this Nation, and the continued Series of Providence, by which he had appear'd in carrying on his Cause, and bringing Affairs into that present glorious condition, wherein they” now were.</Q> <Q>He put them in mind of “the noble Actions of the Army <MILESTONE N="20"/> in the famous Victory of <HI>Worcester,</HI> of the Applications they had made to the Parliament, for a good settlement of all the Affairs of the Com∣mon-wealth, the neglect whereof made it absolutely necessary to dis∣solve” it.</Q> <Q>He assured them by many Arguments, some of which were urged out of Scripture, “that they had a very lawful Call to take upon” them the supreme Authority of the Nation, and concluded with a very earnest desire,</Q> <Q>“that great tenderness might be used towards all conscientious Persons, of what judgement soever they appear'd” to be.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN he had finish'd his discourse, he deliver'd to them an Instru∣ment <MILESTONE N="30"/> engrossed in Parchment under his hand and seal, whereby, with the advice of his Council of Officers, he did devolve, and intrust the supreme Authority of this Common-wealth into the hands of those Per∣sons therein mention'd, and declared, <Q>“that they, or any forty of them were to be held and acknowledged the supreme Authority of the Na∣tion, to which all Persons within the same, and the Territories there∣unto belonging, were to yield obedience and subjection to the third” day of the Month of <HI>November,</HI></Q> which should be in the Year 1654, which was about a Year and three Months from the time that he spoke to them; and three Months before the time prescrib'd should expire, <MILESTONE N="40"/> they were to make choice of other Persons to succeed them, whose Power and Authority should not exceed one Year, and then They were like∣wise to provide, and take care for a like succession in the Government. Being thus invested with this Authority, they repair'd to the Parliament <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They repair to the Parlia∣ment House, and choose</HI> Rouse <HI>the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Speake<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE> House, and made choice of one <HI>Rouse</HI> to be their Speaker, an old Gen∣tleman of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> who had been a Member of the former Parlia∣ment, and in that time been preferr'd and made Provost of the College of <HI>Eton,</HI> which Office he then enjoy'd, with an opinion of having some knowledge in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Tongues, but of a very mean under∣standing, but throughly engaged in the guilt of the times. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>AT their first coming together, some of them had the modesty to doubt, that they were not, in many respects, so well qualified as to take upon them the Style and Title of a Parliament. But that modesty
<PB N="378" REF="3920"/>
was quickly subdued, and they were easily perswaded to assume that <NOTE PLACE="marg">They assume the Name of a Parliament▪</NOTE> Title, and to consider themselves as the supreme Authority in the Na∣tion. These Men thus brought together continued in this Capacity near six Months to the amazement, and even mirth of the People. In which time they never enter'd upon any grave and serious Debate, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Actings and Consulta∣tions</NOTE> might tend to any settlement, but generally expressed great sharpness, and animosity against the Clergy, and against all Learning, out of which they thought the Clergy had grown, and still would grow.</P>
<P>THERE were now no Bishops for them to be angry with; they had already reduced all that Order to the lowest distress. But their quarrel <MILESTONE N="10"/> was against all who had called themselves Ministers, and who, by be∣ing called so, receiv'd Tythes, and respect from their Neighbours. They looked upon the function it self to be Anti-Christian, and the Persons to be burthensome to the People, and the requiring, and payment of Tythes to be absolute Judaism, and they thought fit that they should be abolished altogether; <Q>and that there might not for the time to come be any race of People who might revive those pretences, they proposed “that all Lands belonging to the Universities, and Colleges in those Universities, might be sold, and the Monies that should arise thereby, be disposed for the publick Service, and to ease the People from the” <MILESTONE N="20"/> payment of Taxes and Contributions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHEN they had tired and perplexed themselves so long in such De∣bates, assoon as they were met in the morning upon the twelfth of <HI>De∣cember,</HI> and before many of them were come who were like to dissent from the Motion, one of them stood up and declared, “that he did be∣lieve, they were not equal to the Burthen that was laid upon them, and therefore that they might dissolve themselves, and deliver back” their Authority into Their hands from whom they had receiv'd it;</Q> which being presently consented to, their Speaker, with those who were of that mind, went to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and redeliver'd to <HI>Crom∣well</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Instrument they had receiv'd from him, acknowledged their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>On the</HI> 12 <HI>of</HI> December <HI>they deliver'd up their power to</HI> Cromwell.</NOTE> own Impotency, and besought him to take care of the Common∣wealth.</P>
<P>BY this frank Donation He and his Council of Officers were once more possessed of the Supreme Soveraign Power of the Nation. And in few days after, his Council were too modest to share with him in this Royal Authority, but declared, <Q>“that the Government of the Common∣wealth should reside in a single Person; that that Person should be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>and his Council of Officers make him Lord Pro∣tector</HI></NOTE> <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> Captain General of all the Forces in <HI>England, Scot∣land,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that his Title should be <HI>Lord Protector</HI> of the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Common-wealth of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and of the Do∣minions and Territories thereunto belonging; and that He should have a Council of one and twenty Persons to be Assistant to him in the” Government.</Q></P>
<P>MOST Men did now conclude, that the solly and sottishness of this last Assembly was so much foreseen, that, from their very first coming together, it was determin'd what should follow their Dissolution. For the method that succeeded, could hardly have been composed in so short a time after, by Persons who had not consulted upon the contingency some time before. It was upon the twelfth of <HI>December,</HI> that the small <MILESTONE N="50"/> Parliament was dissolv'd, when many of the Members, who came to the House as to their usual consultations, found that they who came before, were gone to <HI>White-Hall</HI> to be dissolv'd; which the other never
<PB N="379" REF="3930"/>
thought of: and upon the sixteenth day, the Commissioners of the Great <NOTE PLACE="marg">December <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>He is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in</HI> Westmin¦ster<HI>-Hall ac∣cording to an Instrument of Government</HI></NOTE> Seal, with the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, were sent for to attend <HI>Crom∣well</HI> and his Council to <HI>Westminster-</HI>Hall; it being then vacation time; and being come thither, the Commissioners sitting upon their usual Seat, and not knowing why they were sent for, the Declaration of the Coun∣cil of Officers was read, whereby <HI>Cromwell</HI> was made Protector; who stood in the Court uncover'd, whilst what was contain'd in a piece of Parchment was read, which was call'd the <HI>Instrument of Government;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of it.</NOTE> whereby it was ordain'd, <Q>“that the Protector should call a Parliament once in every three years; that the first Parliament should be con∣vened <MILESTONE N="10"/> upon the third day of <HI>September</HI> following, which would be in the year 1654; and that he should not dissolve any Parliament once met, till they had sate five Months; that such Bills as should be presented to him by the Parliament, if they should not be confirm'd by him within twenty days, should pass without him, and be look'd upon as Laws: that he should have a select Council to assist him, which should not exceed the Number of one and twenty, nor be less than thirteen: that immediately after his death, the Council should choose another Protector, before they rose: that no Protector after him should be General of the Army: that the Protector should have <MILESTONE N="20"/> power to make Peace and War: that, with the consent of his Council, he should make Laws, which should be binding to the Subjects during” the Intervals of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHILST this was reading, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had his hand upon the Bible; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it.</HI></NOTE> and it being read, he took his Oath, “that he would not violate any thing that was contain'd in that Instrument of Government; but would observe, and cause the same to be observ'd; and in all things, according to the best of his understanding, govern the Nation accord∣ing to the Laws, Statues, and Customs, seeking Peace and causing” Justice and Law to be equally administer'd.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THIS new invented Ceremony being in this manner perform'd, He himself was cover'd, and all the rest bare; and <HI>Lambert,</HI> who was then the second Person in the Army, carried the Sword before his High∣ness (which was the Style he took from thenceforth) to his Coach, all they whom he call'd into it, sitting bare: and so he return'd to <HI>White-Hall;</HI> and immediately Proclamation was made by a Herald, in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is pro∣clam'd Pro∣tector.</NOTE> <HI>Palace-Yard</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> <Q>“that the late Parliament having dissolv'd themselves, and resign'd their whole power and authority, the Go∣vernment of the Common-wealth of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> by a Lord Protector, and successive Triennial Parliaments, was now <MILESTONE N="40"/> establish'd: and whereas <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> Captain General of all the Forces of the Common-wealth, is declared Lord Protector of the said Nations, and had accepted thereof, publication was now made of the same; and all Persons, of what Quality or condition soever, in any of the said three Nations, were strictly charged and commanded to take notice thereof, and to conform and submit themselves to the Govern∣ment so establish'd; and all Sheriffs, Mayors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were required to publish this Proclamation, to the end that none might have cause to” pretend Ignorance therein.</Q> Which Proclamation was at the same time publish'd in <HI>Cheapside</HI> by the Lord Mayor of <HI>London;</HI> and, with all <MILESTONE N="50"/> possible expedition, by the Sheriffs, and other Officers, throughout <HI>Eng∣land, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> And in some time after, the City of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> invited their new Protector to a very splendid Entertainment at
<PB N="380" REF="3940"/>
<HI>Grocers-</HI>Hall, upon an <HI>Ash-Wednesday;</HI> the Streets being railed, and the Solemnity of his Reception such as had been at any time per∣form'd to the King: and He, as like a King, graciously conferr'd the honour of Knighthood upon the Lord Mayor at his departure.</P>
<P>IN this manner, and with so little pains, this extraordinary Man, without any other reason than because he had a mind to it, and without the assistance, and against the desire of all Noble Persons or Men of Qua∣lity, or of any Number of Men, who, in the beginning of the Trou∣bles, were possessed of three hundred pounds Lands by the year, mount∣ed himself into the Throne of three Kingdoms, without the Name of King, but with a greater Power and Authority than had ever been exer∣cised, <MILESTONE N="10"/> or claimed by any King; and receiv'd greater evidence and ma∣nifestation of respect, and esteem, from all the Kings and Princes in <HI>Christendom,</HI> than had ever been shew'd to any Monarch of those Na∣tions: which was so much the more notorious, in that they all ab∣horr'd him, when they trembled at his Power, and courted his Friendship.</P>
<P>THOUGH during this last year's unsettlement in <HI>England, Cromwell</HI> had, <HI>ex plenitudine potestatis,</HI> taken care that there was a good Winter Guard of Ships in the <HI>Downs,</HI> yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> had enjoyed a very fruit∣ful <MILESTONE N="20"/> harvest of Trade during that confusion, and suspension of Power; and had sent out their Fleets of Merchant Men under a Convoy, by the North of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and, by the return of that Convoy, receiv'd their Fleet from the <HI>Baltick</HI> with security: So that, upon the hope those domestick contentions in <HI>England</HI> would not be so soon composed, they begun to recover their Spirits again. But <HI>Cromwell</HI> had no sooner <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Fleet this year</HI> 1653 <HI>set forth under three Admi∣rals.</HI></NOTE> broke the long Parliament, but, with great diligence, he caused a strong Fleet to be made ready against the Spring; and committed the Com∣mand thereof to three Admirals joyntly; <HI>Blake,</HI> a Man well known, but not thought entirely enough devoted to <HI>Cromwell; Monk,</HI> whom <MILESTONE N="30"/> he called out of <HI>Scotland</HI> as his own Creature; and <HI>Dean,</HI> a meer Sea∣man, grown, from a common Mariner, to the reputation of a bold and excellent Officer.</P>
<P>THIS Fleet, in the beginning of <HI>June</HI> in the year 1653, met with the <HI>Dutch</HI> about the middle Seas over between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Zeeland;</HI> and made what hast they could to engage them. But the Wind not being favourable, it was noon before the Fight begun; which continued very sharp till the night parted them, without any visible advantage to either side, save that <HI>Dean,</HI> one of the <HI>English</HI> Admirals, was killed by a Can∣non shot from the Rere-Admiral of the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The next morning, the <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Dutch</HI> having the advantage of the small Wind that was, the <HI>English</HI> charged so furiously upon the thickest part of them, without discharging any of their Guns till they were at a very small distance, that they broke their Squadrons; and in the end forced them to fly, and make all the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>beaten at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a in</HI> June.</NOTE> Sail they could for their own Coasts, leaving behind them eleven of their Ships; which were all taken; besides six which were sunk. The Execution on the <HI>Dutch</HI> was very great, as was likewise the number of the Prisoners, as well Officers as Soldiers. The loss of the <HI>English</HI> was greatest in their General <HI>Dean:</HI> there was, besides him, but one Cap∣tain, and about two hundred Common Seamen, kill'd: the Number of <MILESTONE N="50"/> the wounded was greater; nor did they lose one Ship, nor were so disabled but that they follow'd with the whole Fleet to the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> whither the other fled; and being got into the <HI>Flie,</HI> and the
<PB N="381" REF="3950"/>
<HI>Texel,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> for some time blocked them up in their own Har∣bours, taking all such Ships as came bound for those parts.</P>
<P>THIS great Defeat so humbled the States, that they made all possible <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> hast to send four Commissioners into <HI>England</HI> to mediate for a Treaty, and a Cessation of Armes; who were receiv'd very lostily by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and with some reprehension for their want of wariness in entring into so unequal a Contention: yet He declared a gracious inclination to a Treaty, till the conclusion whereof he could admit no Cessation; which being known in <HI>Holland,</HI> they would not stay so long under the re∣proach and disadvantage of being besieged, and shut up in their Ports; <MILESTONE N="10"/> but made all possible hast to prepare another Fleet, strong enough to re∣move the <HI>English</HI> from their Coasts; which they believ'd was the best Expedient to advance their Treaty: and there cannot be a greater In∣stance of the opulency of that People, than that they should be able, after so many losses, and so late a great Defeat, in so short a time to set out a Fleet strong enough to visit those who had so lately overcome them, and who shut them within their Ports.</P>
<P>THEIR Admiral <HI>Trump</HI> had, with some of the Fleet, retired into the <HI>Wierings,</HI> at too great a distance from the other Ports for the <HI>English</HI> Fleet to divide it self. He had, with a marvellous Industry, caused his <MILESTONE N="20"/> hurt Ships to be repaired; and more severe punishment to be inflicted on those who had behaved themselves cowardly, than had ever been used in that State. And the States published so great and ample rewards to all Officers and Seamen who would, in that conjuncture, repair to their Service, that by the end of <HI>July,</HI> within less than two Months <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> after their Defeat, he came out of the <HI>Wierings</HI> with a Fleet of ninety and five Men of War; which assoon as the <HI>English</HI> had notice of, they made towards him. But the Wind rising, they were forced to stand more to Sea, for fear of the Sands and Shelves upon that Coast. Whereupon <HI>Van Trump,</HI> all that Night, stood into the <HI>Texel;</HI> where he joyn'd five <MILESTONE N="30"/> and twenty more of their best Ships; and with this Addition, which made an hundred and twenty Sail, he faced the <HI>English;</HI> who, being at this time under the Command of <HI>Monk</HI> alone, kept still to the Sea; and having got a little more room, and the Weather being a little clearer, tacked about, and were receiv'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> with great cou∣rage and gallantry.</P>
<P>THE Battle continued very hot, and bloody on both sides, from six <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Another Sea <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Trump <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the</HI> Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> of the Clock in the Morning till one in the Afternoon; when the Ad∣miral of <HI>Holland,</HI> the famous <HI>Van Trump,</HI> whilst he very signally per∣form'd the Office of a brave and bold Commander, was shot with a Mus∣quet <MILESTONE N="40"/> Bullet into the heart, of which he fell dead without speaking word. This blow broke the courage of the rest; who seeing many of their Companions burnt and sunk, after having endured very hot Service, be∣fore the evening, fled, and made all the Sail they could towards the <HI>Texel,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> were not in a condition to pursue them; but sound them∣selves obliged to retire to their own Coast, both to preserve and mend their maimed and torne Ships, and refresh their wounded Men.</P>
<P>THIS Battle was the most bloody that had been yet fought, both sides rather endeavouring the destruction of their Enemy's Fleet than the taking their Ships. On the <HI>Hollander</HI>'s part, between twenty and <MILESTONE N="50"/> thirty of their Ships of War were fired, or sunk, and above one thou∣sand Prisoners taken. The Victory cost the <HI>English</HI> dear too; for four hundred common Men, and eight Captains, were slain out right, and
<PB N="382" REF="3960"/>
above seven hundred Common Men, and five Captains, wounded. But they lost only one Ship, which was burn'd; and two or three more, though carried home, were disabled for farther service. The most sen∣sible part of the loss to the <HI>Dutch</HI> was the death of their Admiral <HI>Van Trump,</HI> who, in respect of his Maritime experience, and the frequent Actions he had been engaged in, might very well be reckon'd amongst the most eminent Commanders at Sea of that age, and to whose me∣mory his Country is farther indebted than they have yet acknowledged.</P>
<P>THIS was the last Engagement at Sea between the two Common∣wealths: for as the <HI>Dutch</HI> were, by this last Defeat, and loss of their brave Admiral, totally dispirited, and gave their Commissioners at <HI>Lon∣don</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> order to prosecute the Peace upon any conditions, so <HI>Cromwell,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>makes Peace with the</HI> Dutch, April 1654.</NOTE> being by this time become Protector, was weary enough of so chargea∣ble a War, and knew he had much to do to settle the Government at home, and that he might choose more convenient Enemies abroad, who would neither be able to defend themselves as well, or to do him so much harm, as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had done, and could do. And therefore when he had drawn the <HI>Dutch</HI> to accept of such conditions as he thought fit to give them; <Q>among which one was, “that they should not suffer any of the King's Party, or any Enemy to the Common-wealth of <HI>England,”</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> to reside within their Dominions:</Q> and another, which was contain'd in a secret Article, to which the Great Seal of the States was affix'd, by which they obliged themselves <Q>“never to admit the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to be their State-holder, General, or Admiral; and likewise to deliver” up the Island of <HI>Polerone</HI> in the <HI>East Indies</HI> (which they had taken from the <HI>English</HI> in the time of King <HI>James,</HI></Q> <Q>and usurped it ever since) “”into the hands of the <HI>East India English</HI> Company again;</Q> and to pay a good Sum of Money for the old barbarous violence exercised so many years since at <HI>Amboyna;</HI> for which the two last Kings could never ob∣tain satisfaction and reparation: about the middle of <HI>April</HI> 1654 He made a Peace with the States General, with all the advantages he could <MILESTONE N="30"/> desire, having indeed all the Persons of power and interest there, fast bound to him upon their joynt interest.</P>
<P>AND having now render'd himself terrible abroad, He forced <HI>Portu∣gal</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He makes</HI> Por∣tugal <HI>send an Embassadour for Peace.</HI></NOTE> to send an Embassadour to beg Peace, and to submit to expiate the offence they had committed in receiving Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> by the pay∣ment of a great Sum of Money; and brought the two Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> to sue for his Allyance. He suspended for a time to choose a new Enemy, that he might make himself as much obey'd at home, as he was fear'd abroad: and in order to that, he prosecuted all those who had been of <NOTE PLACE="marg">He persecutes the King's Party.</NOTE> the King's Party with the utmost Rigour; laid new impositions upon them; <MILESTONE N="40"/> and upon every light rumour of a Conspiracy, clapp'd up all those whom he thought fit to suspect, into close Prisons; enjoyn'd others not to stir from their own Houses, and banish'd all who had ever been in Arms for the King, from the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster;</HI> and laid other penal∣ties upon them, contrary to the Articles granted to them when they gave up their Arms, and to the indemnity upon making their Compositions.</P>
<P>THE discontents were general over the whole Kingdom, and among all sorts of People, of what Party soever. The Presbyterians preach'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">The general d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ontents in the Nation</NOTE> boldly against the Liberty of Conscience, and the monstrous Licence <MILESTONE N="50"/> that sprung from thence; and they who enjoy'd that Licence were as unsatisfied with the Government as any of the rest, talk'd more loudly, and threaten'd the Person of <HI>Cromwell</HI> more than any. But
<PB N="383" REF="3970"/>
into these distempers <HI>Cromwell</HI> was not inquisitive; nor would give those Men an opportunity to talk, by calling them in question, who, he knew, would say more than he was willing any body should hear; but intended to mortify those unruly Spirits at the charge of the King's Party, and with the Spectacle of their suffering upon any the most tri∣vial occasion. And if, in this general licence of discourse, any Man who was suspected to wish well to the King, let fall any light word against the Government, he was sure to be cast in Prison, and to be pur∣sued with all possible severity and cruelty: and he could not want fre∣quent opportunities of revenge this way. It was the greatest consola∣tion <MILESTONE N="10"/> to miserable Men, who had, in themselves or their friends, been undone by their Loyalty, to meet together, and lament their condi∣tions: and this brought on invectives against the Person of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> Wine, and good Fellowship, and the continuance of the discourse, dis∣posing them to take notice of the universal hatred that the whole Na∣tion had of him, and to fancy how easy it would be to destroy him. And commonly there was, in all those meetings, some corrupted Person of the Party, who fomented most the discourse, and, for a vile recom∣pence, betrayed his Companions, and inform'd of all, and more than had been said. Whereupon a new Plot was discover'd against the Com∣mon-wealth <MILESTONE N="20"/> and the Person of the Protector, and a high Court of Ju∣stice was presently erected to try the Criminals; which rarely absolv'd any Man who was brought before them. But to this kind of Trial they never exposed any Man but those of the King's Party; the other, of whom they were more afraid, had too many friends to suffer them to be brought before such a Tribunal; which had been first erected to mur∣ther the King himself, and continued to root out all who adher'd to him. No Man, who had ever been against the King (except he became afterwards for him) was ever brought before that extravagant Power; but such were remitted to the Trial of the Law by Juries, which seldom <MILESTONE N="30"/> condemn'd any.</P>
<P><Q>THE very next Month after the Peace was made, for the better esta∣blishment <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A High Court of Justice erected a month after the Peace with</HI> Holland.</NOTE> of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Empire, a High Court of Justice was erected for the Trial of Persons accused of “holding correspondence with <HI>Charles” Stuart</HI> (which was the Style they allow'd the King)</Q> <Q>“and for having a design against the life of the Protector, to seise upon the Tower, and” to proclaime the King.</Q> The chief Persons they accused of this were, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Gerard <HI>and M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Vowel <HI>tried before them.</HI></NOTE> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Gerard,</HI> a young Gentleman of a good Family, who had been an Ensigne in the King's Army, but was not at present above twenty two years of Age: the other, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Vowel;</HI> who kept a School, and taught <MILESTONE N="40"/> many Boys about <HI>Islington.</HI> <Q>M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Gerard</HI> was charged with “having been” at <HI>Paris,</HI> and having there spoken with the King;</Q> <Q>which he confessed; and declared “that he went to <HI>Paris</HI> upon a business that concern'd him∣self” (which he named)</Q> <Q>“and when he had dispatched it, and was to re∣turn for <HI>England,</HI> he desired the Lord <HI>Gerard,</HI> his Kinsman, to pre∣sent him to the King, that he might kiss his hand; which he did in a large room, where were many present; and that, when he asked his Majesty, whether he would command him any Service into <HI>England?</HI> his Majesty bid him to commend him to his Friends there, and to charge them that they should be quiet, and not engage themselves in <MILESTONE N="50"/> any Plots; which must prove ruinous to Them, and could do the King” no good:</Q> which was very true: for his Majesty had observ'd so much of the temper of the People at his being at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and his conceal∣ment
<PB N="384" REF="3980"/>
after, the fear they were under, and how fruitless any Insurrection must be, that he endeavour'd nothing more than to divert, and suppress all inclinations that way. However, this High Court of Justice receiv'd proof, that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Gerard</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Vowel</HI> had been present with some other Gentlemen in a Tavern, where discourse had been held, <Q>“how easy a thing it was to kill the Protector, and at the same time to seise upon the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and that, if at the same time the King were pro∣claim'd, the City of <HI>London</HI> would presently declare for his Majesty,” and no body would oppose him.</Q></P>
<P>UPON this Evidence, these two Gentlemen were condemn'd to be <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">They are con∣demn'd.</NOTE> hang'd; and upon the tenth of <HI>July,</HI> about two Months after they had been in Prison, a Gallowes was erected at <HI>Charing-Cross;</HI> whither M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Vowel</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Vowel <HI>exe¦cuted at</HI> Cha∣ring-Cross <HI>his magnani∣mous beha∣viour.</HI></NOTE> was brought; who was a Person utterly unknown to the King, and to any Person entrusted by him, but very worthy to have his name, and memory preserv'd in the List of those who shew'd most magnanimity and courage in sacrificing their Lives for the Crown. He expressed a marvellous contempt of death; <Q>“”which,</Q> he said, <Q>“he” suffer'd without having committed any fault.</Q> He professed his du∣ty to the King, and his reverence for the Church; and earnestly and pathetically advised the People to return to their fidelity to both; <MILESTONE N="20"/> <Q>“”which, he told them,</Q> <Q>“they would at last be compell'd to do after” all their Sufferings.</Q> He addressed himself most to the Soldiers; <Q>told them, “how unworthily they prostituted themselves to serve the Am∣bition” of an unworthy Tyrant;</Q> <Q>and conjured them “to forsake Him,” and to serve the King;</Q> which, he was sure, they would at last do. And so having devoutly recommended the King, and the Kingdom, and Himself, to God in very pious Prayers, he ended his Life with as much Christian Resolution, as can be expected from the most composed Conscience.</P>
<P>THE Protector was prevail'd with to shew more respect to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ge∣rard</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Gerard <HI>be∣headed on</HI> Tower-Hill <HI>in the after∣noon of the same day.</HI></NOTE> in causing him to be beheaded, who was brought the afternoon of the same day to a Scaffold upon the <HI>Tower-Hill.</HI> But they were so ill pleased with the behaviour of Him who suffer'd in the morning, that they would not permit the other to speak to the People, but pressed him to discover all the Secrets of the Plot and Conspiracy. <Q>He told them, “that if he had a hundred lives, he would lose them all to do the King any service; and was now willing to die upon that suspicion; but that he was very innocent of what was charged against him; that he had not enter'd into, or consented to any Plot or Conspiracy, nor given” any countenance to any discourse to that purpose;</Q> and offer'd again to <MILESTONE N="40"/> speak to the People, and to magnify the King: upon which they would not suffer him to proceed; and thereupon, with great and undaunted courage, he laid down his head upon the Block.</P>
<P>THE same day was concluded with a very exemplary piece of Justice, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The same day and place the</HI> Portugal <HI>Em∣bassadour's Brother be∣headed.</HI></NOTE> and of a very different nature from the other two. The Embassadour of <HI>Portugal</HI> had a very splendid Equipage, and in his Company his bro∣ther <HI>Don Pantaleon Sa,</HI> a Knight of <HI>Malta,</HI> and a Man eminent in ma∣ny great Actions; who out of curiosity accompanied his brother in this Embassy, that he might see <HI>England.</HI> This Gentleman was of a haughty and imperious nature; and one day being in the new Exchange, upon a <MILESTONE N="50"/> suddain accident, and mistake, had a quarrel with that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Gerard,</HI> whom we now left without his head; who had then return'd some negligence and contempt to the Rodomontadoes of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and had left
<PB N="385" REF="3990"/>
him sensible of receiving some affront. Whereupon the <HI>Don</HI> repair'd thither again the next day, with many Servants, better arm'd, and provided for any Encounter, imagining he should there find his former Adversary, who did not expect that visit. But the <HI>Portuguese</HI> not distin∣guishing Persons, and finding many Gentlemen walking there, and, amongst the rest, one he believ'd very like the other, he thought he was not to lose the occasion, and enter'd into a new quarrel; in which a Gentleman utterly unacquainted with what had formerly passed, and walking there accidentally, was kill'd, and others hurt; upon which, the People rising from all the Neighbour places, <HI>Don Pantaleon</HI> thought <MILESTONE N="10"/> sit to make his retreat to his Brother's House; which he did, and caused the Gates to be lock'd, and put all the Servants in Armes to defend the House against the People; which had pursued him, and flock'd now together from all parts to apprehend those who had caused the disorder, and had kill'd a Gentleman.</P>
<P>THE Embassadour knew nothing of the affair, but look'd upon him∣self as affronted, and assaulted by a rude Multitude; and took care to defend his House till the Justice should allay the Tumult. <HI>Cromwell</HI> was quickly advertised of the insolence, and sent an Officer with Sol∣diers to demand and seise upon all the Persons who had been engaged <MILESTONE N="20"/> in the Action: and so the Embassadour came to be inform'd of the truth of the story, with which he was exceedingly afflicted and astonish'd. The Officer demanded the Person of his Brother, who was well known, and the rest of those who were present, to be deliver'd to him, without which he would break open the House, and find them wherever they were conceal'd. The Embassadour demanded the Privilege that was due to his House by the Law of Nations, and which he would desend against any violence with his own life, and the lives of all his family; but find∣ing the Officer resolute, and that he should be too weak in the encoun∣ter, he desired respite till he might send to the Protector; which was <MILESTONE N="30"/> granted to him. He complain'd of the Injury that was done him, and desired an Audience. <Q><HI>Cromwell</HI> sent him word, “that a Gentleman had been murther'd, and many others hurt; and that Justice must be sa∣tisfied; and therefore required that all the Persons engaged might be de∣liver'd into the hands of his Officer; without which, if he should with∣draw the Soldiers, and desist the requiring it, the People would pull down the House, and execute Justice themselves; of which he would not answer for the effect. When this was done, he should have an” Audience, and all the satisfaction it was in his power to give.</Q> <Q>The Embassadour desired “that his Brother, and the rest, might remain in <MILESTONE N="40"/> his House, and he would be responsible, and produce them before the” Justice as the time should be assign'd.</Q> <Q>But nothing would serve but the delivery of the Persons, and the People increased their cry “that they” would pull down the House.</Q> Whereupon the Embassadour was com∣pell'd to deliver up his Brother, and the rest of the Persons; who were all sent Prisoners to <HI>Newgate.</HI> The Embassadour used all the Instances he could for his Brother, being willing to leave the rest to the mercy of the Law; <Q>but could receive no other answer but “that Justice must” be done;</Q> and Justice was done to the full; for they were all brought to their Tryal at the Sessions at <HI>Newgate,</HI> and there so many of them <MILESTONE N="50"/> condemn'd to be hang'd as were found guilty. The rest of those who were condemn'd, were executed at <HI>Tiburn;</HI> and <HI>Don Pantaleon</HI> him∣self was brought to the Scaffold on <HI>Tower</HI>-Hill, assoon as M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard</HI>
<PB N="386" REF="4000"/>
was executed; where he lost his head with less grace than his Antagonist had done.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Protector had nothing now to do but at home, <HI>Holland</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The condition of the Prote∣ctor in respect of his Neigh∣bours.</NOTE> having accepted Peace upon his own terms, <HI>Portugal</HI> bought it at a full price, and upon an humble Submission, <HI>Denmark</HI> being contented with such an Allyance as he was pleased to make with them, and <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> contending, by their Embassadours, which should render them∣selves <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The State of</HI> Scotland <HI>un∣der him▪</HI></NOTE> most acceptable to him; <HI>Scotland</HI> lying under a heavy Yoke by the strict Government of <HI>Monk,</HI> who after the Peace with the <HI>Dutch</HI> was sent back to govern that Province, which was reduced under the Government of the <HI>English</HI> Laws, and their Kirk, and Kirkmen, entire∣ly subdued to the obedience of the State with reference to Assemblies, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> or Synods; <HI>Ireland</HI> being confessedly subdued, and no opposition made to the Protector's Commands; so that Commissions were sent to divide all the Lands which had belong'd to the <HI>Irish,</HI> or to those <HI>English</HI> who had adhered to the King, amongst those Adventurers who had supplied Money for the War, and the Soldiers and Officers; who were in great Arrears for their pay, and who receiv'd liberal Assignations in Lands; one whole Province being reserv'd for the <HI>Irish</HI> to be confined to; and all these Divisions made under the Government of his younger Son, <HI>Harry</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Cromwell,</HI> whom he sent thither as his Lieutenant of that Kingdom; who liv'd in the full Grandeur of the Office; notwithstanding all this, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputes a∣mong his own Party</NOTE> <HI>England</HI> proved not yet so towardly as he expected. <HI>Vane,</HI> and the most considerable Men of the Independent Party, from the time he had turn'd them out of the Parliament, and so dissolv'd it, retired quietly to their Houses in the Country; poyson'd the Affections of their Neighbours to∣wards the Government; and lost nothing of their credit with the Peo∣ple; yet carried themselves so warily, that they did nothing to disturb the Peace of the Nation, or to give <HI>Cromwell</HI> any advantage against them upon which to call them in question. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THERE were another less wary, because a more desperate Party, <NOTE PLACE="marg">especially the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> which were the Levellers; many whereof had been the most active Agi∣tators in the Army, who had executed his Orders and Designs in in∣censing the Army against the Parliament, and had been at that time his sole Confidents and Bed-fellows; who, from the time that he assumed the Title of Protector, which to them was as odious as that of King, prosessed a mortal hatred to his Person; and he well knew both these People had too much credit in his Army, and with some principal Offi∣cers of it. Of these Men he stood in more fear than of all the King's Party; of which he had in truth very little apprehension, though he <MILESTONE N="40"/> colour'd many of the preparations he made against the other, as if pro∣vided against the dangers threaten'd from them.</P>
<P>BUT the time drew near now, when he was obliged by the Instru∣ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">He calls a Par∣liament after <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Method</NOTE> of Government, and upon his Oath, to call a Parliament; which seem'd to him the only means left to compose the minds of the People to an entire submission to his Government. In order to this Meeting, though he did not observe the old course in sending Writs out to all the little Boroughs throughout <HI>England,</HI> which use to send Burgesses (by which Method some single Counties send more Members to the Parlia∣ment, than six other Counties do) he thought he took a more equal <MILESTONE N="50"/> way by appointing more Knights for every Shire to be chosen, and sewer Burgesses; whereby the number of the whole was much lessen'd; and yet, the People being left to their own Election, it was not by
<PB N="387" REF="4010"/>
him thought an ill temperament, and was then generally look'd upon as an alteration fit to be more warrantably made, and in a better time. And so, upon the receipt of his Writs, Elections were made accord∣ingly in all places; and such Persons, for the most part, chosen and re∣turn'd, as were believ'd to be the best affected to the present Govern∣ment, and to those who had any Authority in it; <Q>there being strict Or∣der given, “that no Person who had ever been against the Parliament during the time of the Civil War, or the Sons of any such Persons,” should be capable of being chosen to sit in that Parliament;</Q> nor were any <MILESTONE N="10"/> such Persons made choice of.</P>
<P>THE day of their meeting was the third of <HI>September</HI> in the year <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Parlia∣ment meets</HI> Sept. 3. 1654.</NOTE> 1654, within less than a year after he had been declared Protector; when, after they had been at a Sermon in the Abby at <HI>Westminster,</HI> they all came into the Painted Chamber; where his Highness made them a large discourse; <Q>and told them, “that that Parliament was such a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Substance of his Speech to them</NOTE> Congregation of wise, prudent, and discreet Persons, that <HI>England</HI> had scarce seen the like: that he should forbear relating to them the Series of God's Providence all along to that time, because it was well known to them; and only declare to them, that the erection of his present power was a suitable providence to the rest, by shewing what a con∣dition <MILESTONE N="20"/> these Nations were in at its erection: that Then every Man's heart was against another's, every Man's interest divided against an∣other's, and allmost every thing grown Arbitrary: that there was grown up a general contempt of God and Christ, the Grace of God turn'd into wantonness, and his Spirit made a Cloak for all wickedness and prophaneness, nay, that the Ax was even laid to the root of the Ministry, and swarms of Jesuits were continually wafted over hither to consume, and destroy the Welfare of <HI>England:</HI> that the Nation was then likewise engaged in a deep War with <HI>Portugal, Holland,</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> so that the whole Nation was one heap of confusion; but that <MILESTONE N="30"/> this present Government was calculated for the People's Interest, let malignant Spirits say what they would; and that, with humbleness towards God, and modesty towards Them, he would recount some∣what in the behalf of the Government. First, it had endeavour'd to reform the Law; it had put into the Seat of Justice Men of known integrity, and ability; it had settled a way for probation of Ministers to Preach the Gospel: and besides all this, it had called a free Parlia∣ment: that, blessed be God, they that day saw a free Parliament: then as to Wars, that a Peace was made with <HI>Denmark, Sweden,</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and was likewise near concluding with <HI>France:</HI> that <MILESTONE N="40"/> these things were but entrances, and doors of hopes; but now he made no question to enable them to lay the top Stone of the Work, recom∣mending to them that maxim, that Peace, though it were made, was not to be trusted farther than it consisted with Interest: that the great Work which now lay upon this Parliament, was, that the Govern∣ment of <HI>England</HI> might be settled upon terms of Honour: that they would avoid confusions, lest Foreign States should take Advantage of them: that, as for himself, he did not speak like one that would be a Lord over them, but as one that would be a fellow-Servant in that” great Affair: and concluded,</Q> <Q>“that they should go to their House, and” <MILESTONE N="50"/> there make choice of a Speaker▪</Q> which they presently did, and seem'd very unanimous in their first Act, which was the making choice of <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">William. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Speaker.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lenthall</HI> to be their Speaker; which Agreement was upon very
<PB N="388" REF="4020"/>
disagreeing Principles. <HI>Cromwell</HI> having design'd him for lucks sake, and being well acquainted with his temper, concluded, that he would be made a property in This, as well as he had been in the long Parlia∣ment, when he allways complied with that Party that was most power∣ful. And the other Persons who meant nothing that <HI>Cromwell</HI> did, were well pleased, out of hope that the same Man's being in the Chair might facilitate the renewing and reviving the former House; which they looked upon as the true legitimate Parliament, strangled by the Tyranny of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and yet that it had life enough left in it.</P>
<P><Q>LENTHALL was no sooner in his Chair than it was proposed, “that <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Actings.</NOTE> they might in the first place consider by what Authority they came thither, and whether that which had conven'd them, had a Lawful” power to that purpose.</Q> From which Subject the Protector's Crea∣tures, and those of the Army, endeavour'd to divert them by all the Arguments they could. Notwithstanding which, the current of the House insisted upon the first clearing that point, as the foundation, upon which all their Counsels must be built: <Q>and as many of the Members positively enough declared against that power, so one of them, more confident than the rest, said plainly, “that they might easily discern the Snares which were laid to entrap the Privileges of the People; and <MILESTONE N="20"/> for his own part, as God had made him instrumental in cutting down Tyranny in one Person, so now he could not endure to see the Nation's Liberties shackled by another, whose Right to the Government could not be measured otherwise than by the length of his Sword, which” alone had embolden'd him to command his Commanders.</Q> <Q>This Spirit prevailed so far, that, for eight days together, those of the Council of Officers, and others (who were called the Court Party) could not divert the question from being put, “whether the Government should be by a” Protector and a Parliament,</Q> any other way than by lengthning the De∣bate, and then Adjourning the House when the question was ready to <MILESTONE N="30"/> be put, because they plainly saw that it would be carried in the Ne∣gative.</P>
<P>THE continuance of this warm Debate in the House, in which the Protector's own Person was not treated with much reverence, exceed∣ingly perplexed him; and obliged him once more to try, what respect his Soveraign presence would produce towards a better composure. So he came again to the Painted Chamber, and sent for his Parliament to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>speaks to them in the Painted Chamber.</HI></NOTE> come to him; <Q>and then told them, “that the great God of Heaven and Earth knew what grief and sorrow of heart it was to him, to find them falling into heats and divisions: that he would have them take notice <MILESTONE N="40"/> of this, that the same Government made Him a Protector, that made Them a Parliament: that as They were intrusted in some things, so was He in others: that in the Government were certain fundamentals, which could not be alter'd; to wit, that the Government should be in a single Person and a Parliament; that Parliaments should not be per∣petual, and allways sitting; that the Militia should not be trusted in∣to one hand, or power, but so as the Parliament might have a check on the Protector, and the Protector on the Parliament; that in mat∣ters of Religion there ought to be a Liberty of Conscience, and that persecution in the Church was not to be tolerated: These, he said, <MILESTONE N="50"/> were unalterable fundamentals: as for other things in the Govern∣ment, they were examinable and alterable as the State of Affairs did require: that, for his own part, he was even overwhelmed with grief,
<PB N="389" REF="4030"/>
to see that any of them should go about to overthrow what was settled, contrary to the Trust they had receiv'd from the People; which could not but bring very great inconveniences upon themselves and the Na∣tion.”</Q> When he had made this frank Declaration unto them what they were to trust to, the better to confirm them in their duty, he had ap∣pointed a Guard to attend at the door of the Parliament House, and there to restrain all Men from entring into the House who refused to <NOTE PLACE="marg">He admits none into the House but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h as subscribed an Engage∣ment to him.</NOTE> subscribe this following Engagement: <Q>“I do hereby promise and engage to be true and faithful to the Lord Protector of the Common-wealth of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and shall not (according to the tenour of this Indenture, whereby I am return'd to serve in Parliament) <MILESTONE N="10"/> propose or give any Consent to alter the Government as it is settled in” one Person and a Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Engagement a considerable part of the Members utterly re∣fused to sign, and called it a violation of the Privilege of Parliament, and an absolute depriving them of that freedom which was essential to it. So they were excluded, and restrain'd from entring into the House: and they who did subscribe it, and had thereupon Liberty to fit there, were yet so refractory to any Proposition that might settle him in the Government in the manner he desired it, that, after the five Months <MILESTONE N="20"/> near spent in wrangling, and useless discourses (during which he was not to attempt the dissolution of them, by his Instrument of Govern∣ment) he took the first opportunity to dissolve them; and upon the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He dissolves them</HI> Jan. 22.</NOTE> two and twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> with some reproaches, he let them know he could do the business without them; and so dismissed them with much evidence of his Displeasure: and They again retired to their ha∣bitations, resolv'd to wait another opportunity of revenge, and in the mean time to give no evidence of their submitting to his Usurpation, by undertaking any Imployment or Office under his Authority, He as carefully endeavouring and watching to find such an Advantage against them, as might make them liable to the penalty of the Laws. Yet even <MILESTONE N="30"/> his weakness and impotency upon such a notorious Advantage, appear'd in two very notable Instances, which happen'd about that time, in the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of</HI> John Wild∣man <HI>and</HI> John Lilburn, <HI>Le∣vellers</HI></NOTE> Case of two Persons, whose Names were then much taken Notice of upon the Stage of Affairs, <HI>John Wildman,</HI> and <HI>John Lilburn.</HI></P>
<P>THE former had been bred a Scholar in the University of <HI>Cambridge;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">John Wild∣man</NOTE> and being young, and of a pregnant Wit, in the beginning of the Re∣bellion meant to make his Fortune in the War; and chose to depend upon <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s countenance and advice when he was not above the degree of a Captain of a Troop of Horse himself, and was much esteem'd and valued by him, and made an Officer; and was so active in con∣triving <MILESTONE N="40"/> and somenting Jealousies and discontents, and so dextrous in composing, or improving any disgusts, and so inspired with the spirit of praying and preaching, when those gifts came into request, and be∣came thriving Arts, that about the time when the King was taken from <HI>Holmby,</HI> and it was necessary that the Army should enter into Contests with the Parliament, <HI>John Wildman</HI> grew to be one of the principal Agitators, and was most relied upon by <HI>Cromwell</HI> to infuse those things into the minds of the Soldiers, and to conduct them in the managery of their discontents, as might most advance those designs He then had; <MILESTONE N="50"/> and quickly got the reputation of a Man of parts; and, having a smooth Pen, drew many of the Papers which first kindled the fire between the Parliament and the Army, that was not afterwards extinguished but
<PB N="390" REF="4040"/>
in the ruin of both. His Reputation in those faculties made him quit the Army; where he was become a Major; and where he kept still a great Interest, and betook himself to Civil Affairs, in the sollici∣tation of Suites depending in the Parliament, or before Committees; where he had much credit with those who had most power to do Right or Wrong, and so made himself necessary to those who had need of such Protection from the Tyranny of the time. By these Arts he thrived, and got much more than he could have done in the Army, and kept, and encreased his credit there, by the Interest he had in other places. When <HI>Cromwell</HI> declined the ways of establishing the Common-wealth, <HI>Wildman,</HI> amongst the rest, forsook him; and enter'd, warily, into any <MILESTONE N="10"/> counsels which were like to destroy him: and upon the dissolution of this last Parliament, having less of flegme, and so less patience than other Men, to expect another opportunity, and in the mean time to leave him to establish his greatness, he did believe he should be able to make such a schism in the Army, as would give an opportunity to other enraged Persons to take vengeance upon him.</P>
<P>CROMWELL knew the Man, and his undermining faculties; knew he had some design in hand, but could not make any such discovery as might warrant a publick Prosecution; but appointed some trusty Spies <MILESTONE N="20"/> (of which he had plenty) to watch him very narrowly, and, by being often with him, to find his Papers; the spreading whereof, he knew, would be the Preamble to any conspiracy of His. Shortly after the dis∣solution of that Parliament, these Instruments of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s surprised him in a room, where he thought he had been safe enough, as he was writing a Declaration; and seised upon the Papers; <Q>the title whereof was, “a Declaration, containing the reasons and motives which oblige” Us to take up Armes against <HI>Oliver Cromwell;</HI></Q> and though it was not finish'd, yet in that that was done, there was all venom imaginable ex∣pressed against him, and a large and bitter Narration of all his soul breach of trust, and perjuries, enough to have exposed any Man to the <MILESTONE N="30"/> severest Judgement of that time; and as much as he could wish to dis∣cover against Him, or any Man whom he most desired to destroy. The Issue was, the Man was streightly imprison'd, and preparations made for his Trial, and towards his Execution, which all Men expected. But, whether <HI>Cromwell</HI> sound that there were more engaged with him than could be brought to Justice, or were fit to be discover'd (as many Men believ'd) or that <HI>Wildman</HI> obliged himself for the time to come not only to be quiet, but to be a Spy for him upon others (as others at that time suspected, and had reason for it afterwards) after a short time of Imprisonment, the Man was restored to his Liberty; and resorted, with <MILESTONE N="40"/> the same success and reputation, to his former course of Life; in which he thrived very notably.</P>
<P>THE Case of <HI>John Lilburn</HI> was much more wonderful, and admini∣ster'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">John Lilburn</NOTE> more occasion of discourse and observation. This Man, before the Troubles, was a poor Book-binder; and for procuring some sedi∣tious Pamphlets against the Church and State to be printed and dispersed, had been severely censured in the <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> and receiv'd a sharp Castigation, which made him more obstinate and malicious against them; and, as he afterwards confessed, in the melancholy of his Imprisonment and by reading the Book of Martyrs, he raised in himself a marvellous <MILESTONE N="50"/> inclination and appetite to suffer in the defence or for the vindication of any oppressed Truth; and found himself very much confirm'd in that
<PB N="391" REF="4050"/>
spirit; and in that time diligently collected, and read all those Libels and Books, which had anciently, as well as lately been written against the Church: from whence, with the venom, he had likewise contracted the impudence and bitterness of their Style; and by practice, brought himself to the faculty of writing like them: and so, when that Licence broke in of printing all that malice and wit could suggest, he publish'd some Pamphlets in his own Name, full of that confidence and virulency, which might asperse the Government most to the sense of the People, and to their humour. When the War begun, he put himself into the Army; and was taken Prisoner by the King's Forces in that Engagement at <HI>Brentford,</HI> shortly after the battle of <HI>Edge-Hill;</HI> and being then a <MILESTONE N="10"/> Man much known, and talk'd of for his qualities above-mention'd, he was not so well treated in Prison as was like to reconcile him; and being brought before the Chief Justice, to be tried for Treason by a Com∣mission of Oyer and Terminer (in which method the King intended then to have proceeded against the Rebels which should be taken) he behaved himself with so great impudence, in extolling the power of the Parlia∣ment, that it was manifest he had an ambition to have been made a Martyr for that Cause. <Q>But as he was liberally supplied from his Friends at <HI>London</HI> (and the Parliament in express terms declared, “that they would inflict punishment upon the Prisoners they had of the King's <MILESTONE N="20"/> Party, in the same manner as <HI>Lilburn</HI> and the rest should suffer at <HI>Ox∣ford)”</HI> so he did find means to corrupt the Marshal who had the custody of him;</Q> and made his escape into the Parliament Quarters; where he was receiv'd with publick Joy, as a Champion that had defied the King in his own Court.</P>
<P>FROM this time he was entertain'd by <HI>Cromwell</HI> with great familia∣rity, and, in his contests with the Parliament, was of much use to him, and privacy with him. But he begun then to find him of so restless and unruly a Spirit, and to make those advances in Religion against the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Presbyterians before he thought it seasonable, that he dispensed with his presence in the Army, where he was an Officer of Name, and made him reside in <HI>London,</HI> where he wish'd that temper should be improv'd. And when the Parliament was so much offended with his seditious hu∣mour, and the Pamphlets he publish'd every day in Religion, with re∣flections upon their proceedings, that they resolv'd to prosecute him with great rigour (towards which the Assembly of Divines, which he had likewise provok'd, contributed their desire, and demand) <HI>Cromwell</HI> writ a very passionate Letter to the Parliament, <Q>“that they would not so much discourage their Army, that was fighting for them, as to cen∣sure an Officer of it for his opinion in point of Conscience; for the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Liberty whereof, and to free themselves from the shackles in which” the Bishops would enslave them, that Army had been principally raised.</Q> Upon which, all farther prosecution against <HI>Lilburn</HI> was declin'd at that time, though he declined not the farther provocation; and continued to make the Proceedings of the Parliament as odious as he could. But from the time that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had dispersed that Parliament, and was in effect in possession of the Sovereign Power, <HI>Lilburn</HI> withdrew his favour for him; and thought him now an Enemy worthy of his displeasure; and, both in discourses and writings, in Pamphlets and Invectives, loaded <MILESTONE N="50"/> him with all the Aspersions of Hypocrisy, Lying, and Tyranny, and all other imputations and reproaches which either he deserv'd, or the ma∣lice or bitterness of the other's Nature could suggest to him, to make
<PB N="392" REF="4060"/>
him the most universally odious that a faithless perjured Person could be.</P>
<P>CROMWELL could bear ill language and reproaches with less dis∣turbance, and concernment, than any Person in Authority had ever done: yet the prosecution this Man exercised him with, made him plain∣ly discern that it would be impossible to preserve his Dignity, or to have any security in the Government, whilst His Licence continued; and therefore, after he had set spies upon him to observe his Actions, and collect his Words, and upon advice with the Council at Law of the State, was considently inform'd, <Q>“that, as well by the old establish'd Laws, as by new Ordinances, <HI>Lilburn</HI> was guilty of High Treason, and had for∣feited” his Life,</Q> if he were prosecuted in any Court of Justice, he caused <MILESTONE N="10"/> him to be sent to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and at the next Sessions to be indicted of High Treason: all the Judges being present, and the Council at Law to inforce the Evidence, and all care being taken for the return of such a Jury as might be fit for the importance of the Case, <HI>Lilburn</HI> appear'd undaunted, and with the confidence of a Man that was to play a Prize before the People for their own Liberty; he pleaded not-guilty, and heard all the Charge and Evidence against him with patience enough, save that, by interrupting the Lawyers, sometimes, who prosecuted him, and by sharp answers to some questions of the Judges, he shew'd that he had no reverence for their Persons, nor any submission to their <MILESTONE N="20"/> Authority. The whole day was spent in his Tryal; and when he came to make his Defence, he mingled so much Law in his discourse to in∣validate their Authority, and to make it appear so Tyrannical, that nei∣ther their Lives, Liberties, nor Estates were in any degree secure, whilst that Usurpation was exercised; <Q>and answer'd all the matters objected against him with such an assurance, making them “to contain nothing of High Treason, and That to be a Government against which High” Treason could not be committed;</Q> <Q>and telling them “that all true born <HI>English</HI> Men were obliged to oppose this Tyranny, as he had done purely for Their sakes, and that he had done it only for their sakes, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and to preserve them from being Slaves, contrary to his own profit” and worldly Interest:</Q> <Q>He told them “how much he had been in <HI>Crom∣well</HI>'s Friendship: that he might have receiv'd any benefit, or preser∣ment from him, if he would have sate still, and seen his Country en∣slav'd; which because he would not do, he was brought hither to have his life taken from him by their Judgement; which he appre∣hended” not:</Q> <Q>he defended himself with that vigour, and charm'd the Jury so powerfully, that, against all the direction and charge the Judges could give them (who assured them “that the words and actions fully proved against the Prisoner, were High Treason by the Law; and <MILESTONE N="40"/> that they were bound, by all the obligation of Conscience, to find him” guilty) after no long consultation between themselves,</Q> they return'd with their Verdict, <Q>“”that he was Not-guilty:</Q> nor could they be per∣swaded by the Judges to change or recede from their Verdict: which in∣finitely enraged and perplex'd <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who look'd upon it as a greater Defeat than the loss of a Battle would have been. And though <HI>Lilburn</HI> was thus acquitted in the year 1653, yet <HI>Cromwell</HI> would never suffer him to be set at Liberty, as by the Law he ought to have been, but sent him from Prison to Prison, and kept him enclosed there till He himself died. These two Instances of Persons not otherwise considera∣ble, <MILESTONE N="50"/> are thought pertinent to be inserted, as an evidence of the temper of the Nation; and how far the Spirits of that time were from paying
<PB N="393" REF="4070"/>
a submission to that power, when no body had the courage to lift up their hands against it.</P>
<P>WHATEVER uneasiness and perplexity <HI>Cromwell</HI> found in his condi∣tion at home, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's condition a∣broad.</NOTE> the King found no benefit from it abroad, or from the Friendship, or the Indignation of other Princes; They had all the same terrible Apprehension of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s power as if he had been landed with an Army in any of their Dominions, and look'd upon the King's condi∣tion as desperate, and not to be supported. The Treaty between <HI>France</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell<HI>'s Treaty with</HI> France.</NOTE> and <HI>England</HI> proceeded very fast; and every day produced fresh Evi∣dence of the good Intelligence between <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the Cardinal. The <MILESTONE N="10"/> Ships and Prisoners which had been taken when they went to relieve <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and by the taking whereof <HI>Dunkirk</HI> had been lost, were now restored, and set at liberty; and such mutual Offices perform'd between them, as, with frequent evidences of Aversion from the King and his Interest, made it very manifest to his Majesty, that his residence would not be suffer'd to continue longer in <HI>France,</HI> after the Alliance should be publish'd with <HI>Cromwell;</HI> which was not yet perfected, by the Car∣dinal's blushing to consent to some Propositions, without which the other's fast friendship was not to be obtain'd; and he was not willing that modesty should be conquer'd at once, though every body knew it <MILESTONE N="20"/> would quickly be prostituted.</P>
<P>THERE could be no doubt but that the King was heartily weary of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King thinks of re∣treating out of</HI> France; <HI>but whither? was the Question</HI></NOTE> being in a place where he was so ill treated; where he liv'd so uncom∣fortably, and from whence he foresaw that he should soon be driven. But as he had no Money to enable him to remove, or to pay the Debts he ow'd there, so he knew not to what place to repair, where he might find a Civil Reception. <HI>Holland</HI> was bound not to admit him into their Dominions, and by their Example had shew'd other Princes, and States, what conditions They must submit to who would be Allies to <HI>Cromwell.</HI> The King of <HI>Spain</HI> was at the same time contending with <HI>France</HI> for <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Friendship, and thought he had some Advantage with him by the Residence his Majesty had in <HI>France:</HI> so there could be no thought of repairing into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and that he could be admitted to stay there. The Protestants, in most places, expressed much more Inclination to his Rebels than to Him. The Roman Catholicks look'd upon him as in so desperate a condition, that he would in a short time be necessitated to throw himself into their Armes by changing his Religion, without which they generally declared, <Q>“”they would never give him the least Assistance.</Q> In this distress, his Majesty resumed the considerations he had formerly enter'd upon, of sending to the Diet; which was summon'd by the Em∣perour <MILESTONE N="40"/> to meet shortly at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> to make choice of a King of the <HI>Romans.</HI> And <HI>Germany</HI> being then in Peace, the Emperour made little doubt of finding a concurrence in the choice of the King of <HI>Hun∣gary</HI> his eldest Son to be made King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and thereby to be sure to succeed him in the Empire. Our King had long design'd to send the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> on that Errand, to try what the Emperour, and Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> would do, in such a conjuncture, towards the uniting all other Princes with themselves, in undertaking a quarrel they were all concern'd in, to restore a Prince so injur'd and oppressed by so odious a Rebellion; and in the mean time, of which there appear'd to be more hope, what <MILESTONE N="50"/> contribution they would make towards his Support; and likewise, upon this occasion, what fit place might be found, in the nearest parts of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> for the King to repair to; where he might attend his better destiny.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="4080"/>
IT was most suitable to the occasion, and the necessity of the King's condition, that this Affair should be dispatch'd in as private a way as was possible, and with as little expence, it being impossible to send an Embassadour in such an Equipage, as, at such an illustrious Convention of all the Princes of the Empire, was necessary. <HI>Wilmot</HI> pressed very much for that Character, that he might the more easily accomplish his being made an Earl; for which he had obtain'd the King's promise in a fit season. <Q>And he took great pains to perswade the King, “that this was a proper season, and very much for the Advancement of his ser∣vice: but, that if he had the Title of an Earl, which would be look'd upon as a high Qualification, he would not assume the Character of <MILESTONE N="10"/> Embassadour, though he would carry such a Commission with him, but” make all his Negotiations as a private Envoy;</Q> of which he promised the King wonderful Effects, and pretended to have great assurance of Money, and of making Levies of Men for any Expedition. The King, rather to comply with the general expectation, and to do all that was in his power to do, than out of any hope of notable Advantage from this Agitation, was contented to make him Earl of <HI>Rochester;</HI> and gave <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King makes</HI> Wilmot <HI>Earl of</HI> Ro∣chester; <HI>and sends him to the Diet at</HI> Ratisbone.</NOTE> him all such Commissions, and Credentials, as were necessary for the Employment; and sent him from <HI>Paris</HI> in the <HI>Christmas</HI> time, that he <MILESTONE N="20"/> might be at <HI>Ratisbone</HI> at the meeting of the Diet, which was to be in the beginning of <HI>April</HI> following; means having been found to procure so much Money as was necessary for that Journey, out of the Assign∣ment that had been made to the King for his support: of which there was a great Arrear due, and which the Cardinal caused at this time to be supplied, because he look'd upon this sending to <HI>Ratisbone</HI> as a pre∣paratory for the King's own remove.</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Scotland</HI> was vanquish'd, and subdued, to that degree, that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The affairs of</HI> Scotland <HI>at this time.</HI></NOTE> there was no place nor Person who made the least shew of opposing <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who, by the Administration of <HI>Monk,</HI> made the Yoke very <MILESTONE N="30"/> grievous to the whole Nation; yet the Preachers kept their Pulpit▪ Li∣cence; and, more for the affront that was offer'd to Presbytery, than the Conscience of what was due to Majesty, many of them presumed to pray for the King; and generally, though secretly, exasperated the minds of the People against the present Government. The High-landers by the advantage of their Situation, and the hardiness of that People, made frequent incursions in the night into the <HI>English</HI> Quarters; and kill'd many of their Soldiers, but stole more of their Horses: and where there was most appearance of Peace, and Subjection, if the Soldiers stragled in the night, or went single in the day, they were usually <MILESTONE N="40"/> knock'd on the head; and no Enquiry could discover the Malefactors.</P>
<P><Q>MANY Expresses were sent to the King, as well from those who were Prisoners in <HI>England,</HI> as from some Lords who were at liberty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> “that <HI>Middleton</HI> might be sent into the High-lands with his” Majesty's Commission;</Q> and in the mean time the Earl of <HI>Glencarne,</HI> a gallant Gentleman, offer'd, if he were authoriz'd by the King, to draw a Body of Horse and Foot together in the High-lands, and infest the Enemy, and be ready to submit to <HI>Middleton,</HI> assoon as he should ar∣rive there with a supply of Armes and Ammunition. Accordingly the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sent a Commission to the Earl of</HI> Glencarne.</NOTE> King had sent a Commission to the Earl of <HI>Glencarne;</HI> who behaved <MILESTONE N="50"/> himself very worthily, and gave <HI>Monk</HI> some trouble. But he pressing very earnestly, that <HI>Middleton</HI> might be sent over to compose some Animosities, and Emulations, which were growing up to the breaking
<PB N="395" REF="4090"/>
off that Union, without which nothing could succeed, his Majesty, about the time that the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> was dispatch'd for <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> sent likewise <HI>Middleton</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> with some few Officers of that Na∣tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> Middle¦ton <HI>is sent in to</HI> Scotland</NOTE> and such a poor supply of Armes and Ammunition, as, by the activity and industry of <HI>Middleton,</HI> could be got upon the credit and contribution of some Merchants and Officers in <HI>Holland</HI> of that Nation, who were willing to redeem their Country from the Slavery it was in With this very slender Assistance he transported himself in the Winter into the High-lands; where, to welcome him, he found the few, whom he look'd to find in Armes, more broken with Faction amongst them∣selves <MILESTONE N="10"/> than by the Enemy; nor was he able to reconcile them. But af∣ter <HI>Glencarne</HI> had deliver'd his thin unarm'd Troops to <HI>Middleton,</HI> and condescended to fight a duel with an Inferior Officer, who provoked him to it after he was out of his Command, whether he was troubled to have another command over him, who, upon the matter, had no other Men to command but what were raised by him, though he had exceedingly pressed <HI>Middleton</HI>'s being sent over to that purpose, or whether convinced with the impossibility of the Attempt, he retired first to his own House, and then made his Peace with <HI>Monk,</HI> that he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Glencarne <HI>re∣tires to his own House; and made his Peace with</HI> Monk</NOTE> might live quietly, and retain'd still his affection and fidelity to the King; <MILESTONE N="20"/> which he made manifest afterwards in a more favourable conjuncture: and at the same time he excused himself to the King, for giving over an Enterprize which he was not able to prosecute, though <HI>Middleton</HI> sustain'd it a full year afterwards.</P>
<P>THE truth is, the two Persons who were most concern'd in that Ex∣pedition, had no degree of hope that it would be attended with any success, the King, and <HI>Middleton;</HI> who had both seen an Army of that People, well provided with all things necessary, not able to do any thing where they fought upon terms more Advantageous. And how could those now, drawn together by chance, half arm'd and undisciplin'd, be <MILESTONE N="3"/> able to contend with victorious Troops, which wanted nothing, and would hardly part with what they had got? but his Majesty could not refuse to give them leave to attempt what they believ'd they could go through with; and <HI>Middleton,</HI> who had promised them to come to them, when he was assured he should be enabled to carry over with him two thousand Men, and good store of Armes, thought himself obliged to venture his Life with them who expected him, though he could carry no more with him than is mention'd; and by his behaviour there, not∣withstanding all discouragements, he manifested how much he would have done, if others had perform'd half their promises. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>IT will not be amiss in this place to mention an Adventure that was made during his being in the High-lands, which deserves to be recorded for the honour of the Undertakers. There was attending upon the King a young Gentleman, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Wogan,</HI> a very handsome Person, of the age of three or four and twenty. This Gentleman had, when he was a youth of fifteen or sixteen years, been, by the corruption of some of his nearest Friends, engaged in the Parliament Service against the King; where the eminency of his courage made him so much taken notice of, that he was of general estimation, and belov'd by all; but so much in the friendship of <HI>Ireton,</HI> under whom he had the Command of a Troop <MILESTONE N="50"/> of Horse, that no Man was so much in credit with him. By the time of the Murther of the King he was so much improv'd in Age and Un∣derstanding, that, by that horrible and impious Murther, and by the
<PB N="396" REF="4100"/>
information and advice of sober Men in his conversation, he grew into so great a detestation of all that People, that he thought of nothing but to repair his own Reputation, by taking vengeance of those who had cousen'd and misled him: and in order thereunto, assoon as the Mar∣quis of <HI>Ormond</HI> resum'd the Government of <HI>Ireland</HI> again for the King (which was the only place then where any Armes were borne for his Majesty) Captain <HI>Wogan</HI> repaired thither to him through <HI>Scotland;</HI> and behaved himself with such signal Valour, that the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> gave him the Command of his own Guards, and every Man the Testi∣mony of deserving it. He came over with the Marquis into <HI>France;</HI> and being restless to be in Action, no sooner heard of <HI>Middleton</HI>'s being <MILESTONE N="10"/> arriv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> than he resolv'd to find himself with him; and im∣mediately asked the King's leave not only for himself, but for as many of the young Men about the Court as he could perswade to go with him; <Q>declaring to his Majesty, “”that he resolv'd to pass through <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></Q> The King, who had much Grace for him, disswaded him from the Undertaking, for the difficulty and danger of it, and denied to give him leave. But neither his Majesty, nor the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> could divert him; and his importunity continuing, he was left to follow his Inclinations: and there was no News so much talked of in the Court, <MILESTONE N="20"/> as that Captain <HI>Wogan</HI> would go into <HI>England,</HI> and from thence march into <HI>Scotland</HI> to General <HI>Middleton;</HI> and many young Gentlemen, and others, who were in <HI>Paris,</HI> listed themselves with him for the Expedi∣tion. He went then to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; who, during the time of the King's stay in <HI>France,</HI> executed the Office of Secretary of State, to desire the dispatch of such Passes, Letters, and Commissions, as were necessary for the Affair he had in hand. <Q>The Chancellor had much kindness for him, and having heard of his design by the common talk of the Court, and from the free discourses of some of those who resolv'd to go with him, represented “the danger of the enterprise to <MILESTONE N="30"/> himself, and the dishonour that would reflect upon the King, for suf∣fering Men under his Pass, and with his Commission, to expose them∣selves to inevitable ruin: that it was now the discourse of the Town, and would without doubt be known in <HI>England</HI> and to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> be∣fore he and his Friends could get thither, so that it was likely they would be apprehended the first minute they set their foot on Shore; and how much his own particular Person was more liable to danger” than other Mens he knew well;</Q> and, upon the whole matter, very earnestly disswaded him from proceeding farther.</P>
<P>HE answer'd most of the particular considerations with contempt of <MILESTONE N="40"/> the danger, and confidence of going through with it, but with no kind of reason (a talent that did not then abound in him) to make it appear probable. Whereupon the Chancellor expressly refused to make his Dispatches, till he could speak with the King; <Q>“with whom, he said, he would do the best he could to perswade his Majesty to hinder his” journey;</Q> with which the Captain was provoked to so great passion, that he broke into tears, and besought him not to disswade the King; and seem'd so much transported with the resolution of the Adventure, as if he would not out live the disappointment. This passion so far pre∣vailed with the King, that he caused all his Dispatches to be made, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> deliver'd to him. And the very next day He and his Companions, be∣ing seven or eight in number, went out of <HI>Paris</HI> together, and took Post for <HI>Calais.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="4110"/>
THEY landed at <HI>Dover,</HI> continued their journey to <HI>London,</HI> and walked the Town; stayed there above three Weeks, till they had bought Horses, which they quarter'd at Common Inns, and listed Men enough of their friends and acquaintance to prosecute their purpose. And then they appointed their Rendezvous at <HI>Barnet,</HI> marched out of <HI>London</HI> as <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Soldiers, and from <HI>Barnet</HI> were full fourscore Horse well armed, and appointed, and quarter'd that night at S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Albans;</HI> and from thence, by easy journies, but out of the Common Roads, marched safely into <HI>Scotland;</HI> beat up some Quarters which lay in their way, and without any misadventure joyn'd <HI>Middleton</HI> in the High-lands; <MILESTONE N="10"/> where poor <HI>Wogan,</HI> after many brave Actions perform'd there, receiv'd upon a Party an ordinary flesh wound; which, for want of a good Sur∣geon proved mortal to him, to the very great grief of <HI>Middleton,</HI> and all who knew him. Many of the Troopers, when they could stay no longer there, found their way again through <HI>England,</HI> and return'd to the King.</P>
<P>IN the distress which the King suffer'd during his abode in <HI>France,</HI> the Chancellor of the Exchequer's part was the most uneasy and grievous. For though all who were angry with Him, were as angry with the Mar∣quis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who liv'd in great friendship with him, and was in <MILESTONE N="20"/> the same trust with the King in all his counsels which were reserv'd from others; yet the Marquiss's Quality, and the great Services he had per∣form'd, and the great sufferings he underwent for the Crown, made him above all their exceptions; and they believ'd his aversion from all their Devices to make marriages, and to traffick in Religion, proceeded most from the credit the other had with him. And the Queen's displea∣sure <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen's displeasure a∣gainst the Chancellor of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in</HI> France.</NOTE> grew so notorious against the Chancellor, that after he sound by degrees that she would not speak to him, nor take any notice of him when she saw him, he forbore at last coming in her presence; and for many Months did not see her face, though he had the honour to lodge in the same House, the Palace Royal, where both their Majesties kept <MILESTONE N="30"/> their Courts; which encouraged all who desired to ingratiate themselves with her Majesty, to express a great prejudice to the Chancellor, at least to withdraw from his conversation: and the Queen was not reserv'd in declaring, that she did exceedingly desire to remove him from the King; which nothing kept him from desiring also, in so uncomfortable a condition, but the conscience of his duty, and the confidence his Ma∣jesty had in his fidelity.</P>
<P>THIS disinclination towards him produced, at one and the same time, a contrivance of an odd Nature, and a Union between two seem∣ingly irreconcilable Factions, the Papists and the Presbyterians; which <MILESTONE N="40"/> was discover'd to the King by a false brother, before the Chancellor had any intimation of it. The Lord <HI>Balcarris,</HI> with D<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Frazier,</HI> and some <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Petition in∣tended of the</HI> Scotish <HI>Pres∣byterians by</HI> Balcarris <HI>and</HI> Frazier, <HI>that the Chancellor of the Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he∣quer migh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be remov'd</HI></NOTE> other <HI>Scots</HI> about the Court, thought themselves enough qualified to undertake in the name of all the Presbyterians; <Q>and caused a Petition to be prepared, in which they set out, “that the Presbyterian Party had great Affections to serve his Majesty, and much power to do it; and that they had many Propositions, and Advices to offer to his Majesty, for the Advancement thereof: but that they were discouraged, and hindred from offering the same, by reason that his Majesty entrusted his whole Affairs to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; who was an old <MILESTONE N="50"/> known and declared Enemy to all their Party; in whom they could repose no trust: and therefore they besought his Majesty, that He
<PB N="398" REF="4120"/>
might be remov'd from his Council, at least not be suffer'd to be privy to any thing that should be proposed by Them; and they should then make it appear how ready, and how able they were in a very short” time to advance his Majesty's Affairs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>ANOTHER Petition was prepared in the name of his Roman Ca∣tholick <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And of the</HI> Roman <HI>Ca∣tholicks also, against him:</HI></NOTE> Subjects; which said, “that all his Majesty's Party which had adher'd to him, were now totally suppressed; and had, for the most part, compounded with his Enemies, and submitted to their Govern∣ment: that the Church Lands were all sold, and the Bishops dead, except very few, who durst not exercise their Function: so that he <MILESTONE N="10"/> could expect no more aid from any who were concern'd to support the Government of the Church as it had been formerly established: that by the defeat of Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Party first, and then by his Ma∣jesty's ill success at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and the total reduction of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> afterwards by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> his Majesty might conclude what greater aid he was to expect from the Presbyterian Party. Nothing therefore remain'd to him of hope for his Restoration, but from the affection of his Roman Catholick Subjects; who, as they would never be wanting as to their Persons, and their Estates which were left, so they had hope to draw from the Catholick Princes, and the Pope him∣self, <MILESTONE N="20"/> such considerable assistance both in Men and Money, that his Ma∣jesty should owe his Restitution, under the Blessing of God, to the sole power and assistance of the Catholicks. But they had great reason to fear, that all these hopes would be obstructed and render'd of no use, not only by there being no Person about his Majesty in whom the Ca∣tholicks could have any confidence, but by reason that the Person most trusted by him, and through whose hands all Letters and Dis∣patches must pass, is a known Enemy to all Catholicks; and therefore they besought his Majesty, that that Person, the Chancellor of the Ex∣chequer, might be removed from him; whereupon he should find” <MILESTONE N="30"/> great benefit to accrue to his Service.</Q> It was concluded amongst them, that when these two Petitions should be weighed and consider'd, the Queen would easily convince his Majesty, that a Person who was so odious to all the Roman Catholicks, from whose Affections his Majesty had most reason to promise himself relief, and to all the Protestants who could contribute to his assistance or subsistence, could not be fit to be continued in any Trust about him.</P>
<P>WHEN matters were thus adjusted, which were the longer in pre∣paration, because the Persons concern'd could not, without suspicion and scandal, meet together, but were to be treated with by Persons mu∣tually employed, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Walsingham,</HI> a Person very well known to all <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The design dis∣cover'd by one M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Wallin∣gham, <HI>to the King; which qua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d them both.</HI></NOTE> Men who at that time knew the Palace Royal, who had been employed in the affair, came to the King, and, whether out of ingenuity, and dislike of so foul a combination, or as he thought the discovery would be grateful to his Majesty, informed him of the whole Intrigue, and gave a Copy of the Petitions to the King; who shew'd them to the Mar∣quis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and inform'd them of the whole Design. And from this time his Majesty made him∣self very merry with it, and spoke of it sometimes at dinner, when the Queen was present; <Q>and asked pleasantly, “when the two Petitions” <MILESTONE N="50"/> would be brought against the Chancellor of the Exchequer?</Q> which be∣ing quickly known to some of the Persons engaged in the prosecution, they gave it over, and thought not fit to proceed any farther in it;
<PB N="399" REF="4130"/>
though both Parties continued their implacable malice towards him, nor did he find any ease or quiet by their giving over that design, their Animosities against him still breaking out one after another, as long as the King remain'd in <HI>France;</HI> the Queen taking all occasions to complain to the Queen Regent of the King's unkindness, that she might impute all that she disliked to the Chancellor; and the Queen Mother of <HI>France</HI> was like to be very tender in a point that so much concern'd her self, that any Man should dare to interpose between the Mother and the Son.</P>
<P>THERE was an accident fell out, that administer'd some argument <MILESTONE N="10"/> to make those Complaints appear more reasonable. The Cardinal <HI>de Retz</HI> had allways expressed great civilities towards the King, and a de∣sire to serve him; and upon some occasional conference between them, the Cardinal ask'd the King, <Q>“whether he had made any attempt to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A discourse of the King's with Cardinal</HI> de Retz.</NOTE> draw any Assistance from the Pope, and whether he thought that no∣thing might be done that way to his advantage? The King told him, nothing had been attempted that way; and that He was better able to judge, whether the Pope was like to do any thing for a Man of His” Faith.</Q> <Q>The Cardinal smiling, said, “he had no thought of speaking of his Faith; yet in short, he spoke to him like a wise and honest Man; <MILESTONE N="20"/> that if any Overtures were made him of the change of his Religion, he must tell his Majesty, it becomes him as a Cardinal to wish his Ma∣jesty a Catholick for the saving his Soul; but he must declare too, that if he did change his Religion, he would never be restored to his King∣doms.”</Q> But he said, he did believe (though the Pope was old, and much decay'd in his generosity; <Q>for <HI>Innocent</HI> the 10<SUP>th</SUP> was then living) “that if some proper Application was made to the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> and to the Pope himself, though there would not be gotten wherewithal to raise and maintain Armies, there might be somewhat considerable ob∣tain'd for his more pleasant Support, wherever he should choose to” reside.</Q> <Q>He said, “he had himself some Alliance with the Great Duke, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and interest in other Courts, and in <HI>Rome</HI> it self, and if his Majesty would give him leave, and trust his discretion, he would write in such a manner in his own Name to some of his friends, as should not be of” any prejudice to his Majesty if it brought him no convenience.</Q> The King had reason to acknowledge the obligation, and to leave it to his own wisdom, what he would do. In the conclusion of the discourse, the Cardinal ask'd his Majesty a question or two of matter of fact, which he could not answer; <Q>but told him, “he would give a punctual infor∣mation” of it the next day in a Letter:</Q> which the Cardinal desired might <MILESTONE N="40"/> be assoon as his Majesty thought fit, because he would, upon the receipt of it, make his dispatches into <HI>Italy.</HI> The particular things being out of the King's Memory, assoon as he return'd, he ask'd the Chancellor of the Exchequer concerning them; and having receiv'd a punctual Ac∣count from him, his Majesty writ a Letter the next day to the Cardinal, and gave him information as to those particulars. Within very few days after this, the Cardinal coming one day to the <HI>Louvre</HI> to see the Queen Mother, he was arrested by the Captain of the Guard, and sent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cardinal</HI> de Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the</HI> Pastile</NOTE> Prisoner to the <HI>Baslile;</HI> and in one of his Pockets, which they search'd, that Letter the King had sent to him was found, and deliver'd to the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Queen Regent; who presently imparted it to the Queen of <HI>England;</HI> and after they had made themselves merry with some improprieties in the <HI>French,</HI> the King having, for the secrecy, not consulted with any
<PB N="400" REF="4140"/>
body, they discover'd some purpose of applying to the Pope, and to other Catholick Princes; and that his Majesty should enter upon any such Coun∣sel, without first consulting with the Queen his Mother, could proceed only from the instigation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>HER Majesty, with a very great proportion of sharpness, reproach'd the King for his Neglect, and gave him his Letter. The King was exceed∣ingly sensible of the little respect the Queen Mother had shew'd towards him, in communicating his Letter in that manner to his Mother; and expostulated with her for it; and took that occasion to enlarge more upon the injustice of his Mother's complaints, than he had ever done. And from that time the Queen Mother, who was in truth a very worthy <MILESTONE N="10"/> Lady, shew'd much more kindness to the King. And a little time after, there being a Masque at the Court that the King liked very well, he perswaded the Chancellor to see it; and vouchsafed, the next night, to carry him thither himself, and to place the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> and Him next the Seat where all their Majesties were to sit. <Q>And when they enter'd, the Queen Regent ask'd, “who that fat Man was who sate by” the Marquis of <HI>Ormond?</HI></Q> <Q>The King told her aloud, “that was the naughty Man who did all the Mischief, and set him against his Mo∣ther:”</Q> at which the Queen her self was little less disorder'd than the Chancellor was. But they within hearing laugh'd so much, that the <MILESTONE N="20"/> Queen was not displeased; and somewhat was spoken to his Advantage, whom few thought to deserve the Reproach.</P>
<P><Q>AT this time the King was inform'd by the <HI>French</HI> Court, “that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>with his Fleet arrives at</HI> Nantes.</NOTE> Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who had been so long absent, having gone with the Fleet from <HI>Holland</HI> before the Murther of the late King, and had not been heard of in some years, was now upon the Coast of <HI>France,</HI> and soon after at <HI>Nantes</HI> in the Province of <HI>Britain,</HI> with the <HI>Swallow,</HI> a Ship of the King's, and with three or four other Ships; and that the <HI>Constant Reformation,</HI> another Ship of the King's, in which Prince <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Maurice</HI> had been; was cast away in the <HI>Indies</HI> near two years before;” and that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> himself was return'd with very ill health.</Q> The King sent presently to welcome him, and to invite him to <HI>Paris</HI> to at∣tend his health; and his Majesty presumed that, by the Arrival of this Fleet, which he thought must be very rich, he should receive some Mo∣ney, that would enable him to remove out of <HI>France;</HI> of which He was as weary as It was of Him.</P>
<P>GREAT Expectation was raised in the <HI>English</HI> Court, that there would be some notable change upon the Arrival of this Prince; and though he had professed much kindness to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when <MILESTONE N="40"/> he parted from <HI>Holland,</HI> yet there was hope that he would not appear now his Friend, the rather for that he had left <HI>Ireland</HI> with some de∣clared unkindness towards the Marquis of <HI>Ormond.</HI> And all Men knew that the Atturney General, who was unsatisfied with every body, would have most influence upon that Prince; and that his Highness could not be without credit enough with the King to introduce him into business; which they thought would at least lessen the Chancellor. In order to which, it was no sooner known that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was landed in <HI>France,</HI> but the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> visited, and made great court to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Her∣bert;</HI> between whom and him there had been greater shew of Animosity <MILESTONE N="50"/> than between any two of the Nation who were beyond the Seas, they having for some years seldom spoken to, never well of, each other. And <HI>Herbert,</HI> who was of a rough and proud nature, had declared publickly,
<Q><PB N="401" REF="4150"/>
“that he would have no friendship with any Man who believ'd the other” to be an honest Man.</Q> Between these two a great friendship is suddain∣ly made; and the Atturney is every day with the Queen, who had shew'd a greater Aversion from him than from any Man, not only upon the business of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> but upon many other Occasions. <Q>But now she commended him to the King, “as a wise Man, of great Expe∣rience,” and of great Interest in <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>FROM the death of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Richard Lane,</HI> who had been Keeper of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen Mother moves the King to make</HI> Herbert <HI>Lord Keeper; and he is made.</HI></NOTE> Great Seal under his late Majesty, there had not only been no Officer in that place, but, from the defeat at <HI>Worcester,</HI> the King had been without <MILESTONE N="10"/> any Great Seal, it having been there lost. But he had lately imploy'd a Graver to prepare a Great Seal; which he kept himself, not intending to confer that Office, whilst he remain'd abroad. But now the Queen pressed the King very earnestly, to make the Atturney General Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; which was a promotion very natural, Men or∣dinarily rising from the one Office to the other. The King knew the Man very well, and had neither esteem nor kindness for him; yet he well foresaw, that when Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> came to him, he should be pressed both by his Mother and Him so importunately, that he should not with any ease be able to refuse it. Then he believ'd that, if the Man him∣self <MILESTONE N="20"/> were in good humour, he would be of great use in composing any ill humour that should arise in the Prince; to which it was apprehended he might be apt to be inclined. And therefore his Majesty thought it best (since no body disswaded him from the Thing) to oblige him frankly himself before the Prince came; and so call'd him to his Council, and made him Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; with which he seem'd won∣derfully delighted; and for some time liv'd well towards every Body; though, as to any thing of business, he appear'd only in his old excellent faculty of raising doubts, and objecting against any thing that was pro∣posed, and proposing nothing himself; which was a temper of Under∣standing <MILESTONE N="30"/> he could not rectify, and, in the present State of Affairs, did less mischief than it would have done in a time when any thing was to have been done.</P>
<P><Q>BEFORE the Prince came to <HI>Paris</HI> he gave the King such an Ac∣count, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>gives an ill Account of his Fleet.</HI></NOTE> as made it evident that his Majesty was to expect no Money: “that what Treasure had been gotten together, which, he confessed, had amounted to great value, had been all lost in the Ship in which” himself was (that sprung a plank in the <HI>Indies,</HI></Q> <Q>when his Highness was miraculously preserv'd) “and, in the Boat, carried to another Ship, when that the <HI>Antelope,</HI> with all the Men, and all that had been got∣ten, <MILESTONE N="40"/> sunk in the Sea; and that much of the other purchase had been” likewise cast away in the Ship in which his Brother perish'd;</Q> which was after his own misfortune: so that all that was brought into <HI>Nantes,</HI> would scarce pay off the Seamen, and discharge some debts at <HI>Toulon,</HI> which the Prince had contracted at his former being there, during the time that the King had been in <HI>Holland:</HI> <Q>And “that the Ships were all so eaten with worms, even the <HI>Swallow</HI> it self, that there was no possi∣bility” of setting them out again to Sea.</Q> This was all the Account the King could receive of that whole Affair, when the Prince himself came to <HI>Paris;</HI> with which though the King was not satisfied, yet he knew <MILESTONE N="50"/> not how to remedy it, the Prince taking it very ill that any Account should be required of him; and the Keeper quickly perswaded his High∣ness, that it was only the Chancellor of the Exchequer's influence, that
<PB N="402" REF="4160"/>
disposed the King with so much strictness to examine his Account.</P>
<P>THERE was another design now set on foot, by which they con∣cluded <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Affair concerning M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Long; <HI>who petitions the King to be re∣stored to the Secretary's Place:</HI></NOTE> they should sufficiently mortify the Chancellor; who, they thought, had still too much credit with his Master. When the King went into <HI>Scotland,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Long,</HI> who hath been mention'd before, was Secretary of State; who, having been allways a creature of the Queen's, and dependent upon the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> had so behaved himself towards them, during his short stay in <HI>Scotland</HI> (for he was one of those who was remov'd from the King there, and sent out of that Kingdom) that when his Majesty return'd from <HI>Worcester</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> they would <MILESTONE N="10"/> by no means suffer that he should wait upon his Majesty; and accused him of much breach of trust, and dishonesty, and, amongst the rest, that he should say, which could be prov'd, <Q>“that it was impossible for any Man to serve the King honestly, and to preserve the good opinion of” the Queen, and keep the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI>'s favour.</Q> The truth is, that Gentleman had not the good fortune to be generally well thought of, and the King did not believe him faultless; and therefore was contented to satisfy his Mother, and would not permit him to execute his Office, or to attend in his Councils. Whereupon he left the Court, and lived privately at <HI>Roan;</HI> which was the reason that the Chancellor had been commanded to execute that place, which intitled him to so much trou∣ble. <MILESTONE N="20"/> Upon this conjunction between the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> and the Keeper, the last of whom had in all times inveighed against M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI>'s want of fidelity, they agreed, that there could not be a better expedient found out to lessen the Chancellor's credit, than by restoring <HI>Long</HI> to the exe∣cution of the Secretary's Function. <Q>Whereupon they sent for him, and advised him to prepare a Petition to the King, “that he might be again restored to his Office and Attendance, or that he might be charged with his Crimes, and be farther punish'd, if he did not clear himself,” and appear innocent.</Q> This Petition was presented to the King, when he was in Council, by the Queen; who came thither only for that pur∣pose, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and desired that it might be read; which being done, the King was surprised, having not in the least receiv'd any notice of it; <Q>and said, “that her Majesty was the principal cause that induced his Majesty to remove him from his place, and that she then believ'd that he was” not fit for the Trust.</Q> <Q>She said, “she had now a better opinion of him,” and that she had been misinform'd.</Q> The King thought it unfit to re∣ceive <NOTE PLACE="marg">is refused by the King.</NOTE> a Person into so near a Trust, against whose fidelity there had been such publick exceptions; and his Majesty knew that few of his Friends in <HI>England</HI> would correspond with him; and therefore would not be <MILESTONE N="40"/> perswaded to restore him. This was again put all upon the Chancellor's Account, and the influence He had upon the King.</P>
<P>THEREUPON M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI> accused the Chancellor of having betray'd the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whereupon M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Long <HI>ac∣cuses the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer of his having been in</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>and con∣versed with</HI> Cromwell.</NOTE> King; and undertook to prove that he had been over in <HI>England,</HI> and had private conference with <HI>Cromwell:</HI> which was an aspersion so im∣possible, that every body laugh'd at it: <Q>yet because he undertook to prove it, the Chancellor pressed “that a day might be appointed for” him to produce his proof:</Q> and at that day, the Queen came again to the Council, that she might be present at the Charge. There M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The business heard in Coun∣cil:</NOTE> produced <HI>Massonet,</HI> a Man who had serv'd him, and afterwards been <MILESTONE N="50"/> an Under-Clerk for writing Letters and Commissions, during the time <NOTE PLACE="marg">Massonet <HI>is produced as a hear-for Wit∣ness of it.</HI></NOTE> of the King's being in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had been taken Prisoner at <HI>Worce∣ster;</HI> and, being released with the rest of the King's Servants, had been
<PB N="403" REF="4170"/>
employed, from the time of the King's return, in the same Service un∣der the Chancellor; the Man having, before the Troubles, taught the King, and the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and the rest of the King's Children to write, being indeed the best Writer, for the fairness of the hand, of any Man in that time.</P>
<P><Q>MASSONET said, “that after his release from his Imprisonment, and whilst he stayed in <HI>London,</HI> he spoke with a Maid, who had for∣merly serv'd him, that knew the Chancellor very well, and who assured him, that one evening she had seen the Chancellor go into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Chamber at <HI>White-Hall;</HI> and after he had been shut up with him some” <MILESTONE N="10"/> hours, she saw him conducted out again.</Q> And M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI> desired time, that he might send over for this Woman, who should appear and justify it. <Q>To this impossible discourse, the Chancellor said, “he would make no other defence, than that there were Persons then in the Town, who, he was confident, would avow that they had seen him once every day, from the time he return'd from <HI>Spain</HI> to the day on which he attended” his Majesty at <HI>Paris;</HI></Q> as indeed there were; and when he had said so, he offer'd to go out of the room; which the King would not have him to do. <Q>But he told his Majesty, “that it was the course; and that he” ought not to be present at the Debate that was to concern himself;</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"/> <Q>and the Keeper, with some warmth, said “it was true; and so he retired to his own Chamber. The Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> assoon as he was gone, said, he never thought the Accusation had any thing of probability in it; and that he believ'd the Chancellor a very honest Man; but the use that he thought ought to be made of this Calumny, was, that it appear'd that an honest and innocent Man might be calumniated, as he thought M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI> had likewise been; and therefore they ought both to be” clear'd.</Q> <Q>The Keeper said, “he saw not ground enough to condemn the Chancellor; but he saw no cause neither to declare him innocent: that there was one Witness which declared only what he had heard; <MILESTONE N="30"/> but that he undertook also to produce the Witness her self if he might have time; which in justice could not be denied; and therefore he proposed, that a competent time might be given to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI> to make out his proof; and that in the mean time the Chancellor might not” repair to the Council:</Q> <Q>with which Proposition the King was so of∣fended, that, with much warmth, he said, “he discern'd well the design; and that it was so false and wicked a Charge, that, if he had no other exception against M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI> than this foul and foolish Accusation, it was” cause enough never to trust him.</Q> <Q>And therefore he presently sent for the Chancellor, and assoon as he came in, commanded him to sit in his place; and told him, “he was sorry he was not in a condition to do” <MILESTONE N="40"/> him more Justice than to declare him innocent;</Q> which he did do, and commanded the Clerk of the Council to draw up a full Order for his <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ac∣quits the Chancellor.</NOTE> Vindication, which his Majesty himself would sign.</P>
<P><Q>THE Keeper could not contain himself from appearing very much <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Keeper accuses the Chancellor of the Exc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eque<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of having spoken all of the King</NOTE> troubled; and said, “if what he heard from a Person of honour, who, he thought, would justify it, were true, the Chancellor had aspersed the King in such a manner, and so much reviled his Majesty in point” of his honour, that he was not fit to sit there.</Q> The Chancellor was wonderfully surprised with the Charge; <Q>and humbly besought his Ma∣jesty, <MILESTONE N="50"/> “that the Lord Keeper might produce his Author, or be look'd” upon as the Contriver of the Scandal.</Q> <Q>The Keeper answer'd, “that if his Majesty would appoint an hour the next day for the Council to
<PB N="404" REF="4180"/>
meet, he would produce the Person, who, he was confident, would” justify all he had said.</Q></P>
<P>THE next day, the King being sate in Council, the Keeper desired <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Gerard <HI>pro∣duced to prove it.</HI></NOTE> that the Lord <HI>Gerard</HI> might be called in; <Q>who presently appear'd; and being asked, “whether he had at any time heard the Chancellor of the” Exchequer speak ill of the King?</Q> he answer'd, Yes. And thereupon made a relation of a conference that had passed between the Chancellor and Him a year before, when the King lay at <HI>Chantilly;</HI> <Q>“that one day, after dinner, the King took the Air, and being in the Field his Ma∣jesty alighted out of his Coach, and took his Horse, with other of the Lords, to ride into the next Field to see a Dog set patridge; and that <MILESTONE N="10"/> he, the Lord <HI>Gerard,</HI> and the Chancellor remain'd in the Coach, when he enter'd into discourse of the King's condition; and said, that he thought his Majesty was not active enough, nor did think of his busi∣ness; and, that the Chancellor, who was known to have credit with him, ought to advise him to be active, for his Honour and his Interest; otherwise, his Friends would fall from him. But, that it was generally believ'd, that he, the Chancellor, had no mind that his Majesty should put himself into Action, but was rather for sitting still; and therefore it concern'd him, for his own justification, to perswade the King to be Active, and to leave <HI>France,</HI> where he could not but observe that <MILESTONE N="20"/> every body was weary of him. To all which the Chancellor took great pains to purge himself from being in the fault; and said, that no body could think that he could take delight to stay in a place where he was so ill used; but laid all the fault upon the King; who, he said, was indisposed to business, and took too much delight in pleasures, and did not love to take pains; for which he was heartily sorry, but could” not help it;</Q> <Q>which <HI>Gerard</HI> said, “he thought was a great reproach and scandal upon the King, from a Man so obliged and trusted, who” ought not to asperse his Master in that manner.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P><Q>THE Chancellor was a little out of countenance; and said, “he did <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel∣lor's Defence.</NOTE> not expect that Accusation from Any body, less that the Lord <HI>Gerard</HI> should discover any private discourse that had passed a year before between them two, and which appear'd by his relation to have been introduced by himself, and by his own freedom: that whosoever be∣liev'd that he had a mind to traduce the King, would never believe that he would have chosen the Lord <HI>Gerard,</HI> who was known to be” none of his Friend, to have communicated it to.</Q> <Q>He said, “he did very well remember, that the Lord <HI>Gerard</HI> did, at that time when they two remain'd alone in the Coach, very passionately censure the <MILESTONE N="40"/> King's not being Active, and blamed him, the Chancellor, for not per∣swading his Majesty to put himself into Action; and that He was ge∣nerally believ'd to be in the fault: upon which he had asked him, what he did intend by being Active, and what that Action was, and where, to which he wish'd the King should be perswaded? He answer'd, with an increase of passion, and addition of Oaths, that rather than sit still in <HI>France,</HI> his Majesty ought to go to every Court in <HI>Christendom;</HI> that instead of sending an Embassadour who was not fit for any busi∣ness, he should have gone himself to the Diet at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> and solli∣cited his own business: which would have been more effectual; and <MILESTONE N="50"/> that, if he could not find any other way to put himself into Action, he ought to go into the High-lands of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Middleton,</HI> and there” try his Fortune.</Q> To all which the Chancellor said, he did remember
<PB N="405" REF="4190"/>
that he replied, <Q>“he believ'd the King was indisposed to any of that Action he proposed: and though he did not believe, that he had used those Expressions, of the King's delighting in pleasures, and not loving business so well as he ought to do, if the Lord <HI>Gerard</HI> would posi∣tively affirm he had, he would rather confess it, and submit himself to his Majesty's judgement, if he thought such words proceeded from any malice in his heart towards him, than, by denying it, continue” the Debate:</Q> And then he offer'd to retire; which the King forbid him to do; upon which the Keeper was very Angry; <Q>and said, “the words amounted to an Offence of a high Nature; and that he was sorry his <MILESTONE N="10"/> Majesty was no more sensible of them: that for Any Man, especially a Counsellor, and a Man in so near trust, to accuse his Master of not loving his business, and being inclined to pleasures, was to do all he” could to perswade all Men to forsake him;</Q> and proceeding with his usual warmth and positiveness, the King interrupted him; <Q>and said, “he did really believe the Chancellor had used those very words, because he had often said That, and much more to himself; which he had never taken ill: that he did really believe that he was himself in fault, and did not enough delight in his business; which was not very plea∣sant; but he did not know that such putting himself into Action, <MILESTONE N="20"/> which was the common word, as the Lord <HI>Gerard</HI> advised, was like” to be attended with those benefits,</Q> which, he was confident, he wish'd, In fine, he declared, <Q>“he was very well satisfied in the Chancellor's Af∣fection, and took nothing ill that he had said; and directed the Clerk” of the Council to enter such his Majesty's Declaration in his Book;</Q> with which both the Keeper and the Lord <HI>Gerard</HI> were very ill satisfied. But from that time there were no farther publick Attempts against the Chancellor, during the time of his Majesty's abode in <HI>France.</HI> But it may not be unseasonable to insert in this place, that, after the King's return into <HI>England,</HI> there came the Woman to the Chancellor, who had been carried over to <HI>Roan</HI> by <HI>Massonet,</HI> and importuned by M<SUP>r</SUP> <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Long</HI> to testify that she had seen the Chancellor with <HI>Cromwell;</HI> for which she should have a present liberal reward in Money from him, and a good Service at <HI>Paris;</HI> which when the Woman refused to do, he gave her Money for her journey back, and so she return'd: of which the Chancellor inform'd the King. But M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI> himself coming at the same time to him, and making great Acknowledgements, and asking pardon, the Chancellor frankly remitted the injury; which M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Long</HI> seem'd to acknowledge with great gratitude ever after.</P>
<P>THE King wearied with these domestick Vexations, as well as with the uneasiness of his Entertainment, and the change he every day dis∣cover'd <MILESTONE N="40"/> in the countenance of the <HI>French</HI> Court to him, grew very im∣patient to leave <HI>France;</HI> and though he was totally disappointed of the expectation he had to receive Money by the Return of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with that Fleet, he hoped that when the Prizes should be sold, and all the Seamen discharged, and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> be satisfied his demands, which were very large, there would be still left the Ships, and Ordnance, and Tackling, which (though they required great Charge to be fitted out again to Sea, yet) if sold, he presumed, would yield a good Sum of Money to enable him to remove, and support him some time after he was remov'd; for there were, besides the Ship it self, fifty good Brass <MILESTONE N="50"/> Guns on board the <HI>Swallow,</HI> which were very valuable. His Majesty therefore writ to Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> (who was return'd to <HI>Nantes</HI> to discharge
<PB N="406" REF="4200"/>
some Seamen, who still remain'd, and to sell the rest of the Prizes) <Q>“that he should find some good Chapmen to buy the Ships, and Ord∣nance,” and Tackle, at the value they were worth:</Q> which was no sooner known at <HI>Nantes,</HI> than there appear'd Chapmen enough, besides the Marshal of <HI>Melleray,</HI> who being Governour of that place, and of the Province, had much Money allways by him to lay out on such occa∣sions. <Q>And the Prince writ the King word, “that he had then a good Chapman, who would pay well for the Brass Cannon; and that he” should put off all the rest at good rates.</Q> <Q>But he writ again the next Week, “that, when he had even finish'd the contract for the Brass Can∣non, there came an Order from the Court, that no Man should pre∣sume <MILESTONE N="10"/> to buy the Brass Cannon, and to Marshal <HI>Melleray</HI> to take care” that they were not carried out of that Port.</Q></P>
<P>THE Prince apprehended, that this unexpected restraint proceeded from some claim and demand from <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and then expected, that it would likewise relate to the <HI>Swallow</HI> it self, if not to the other Ships; and the Marshal contributed to, and cherished this Jealousy, that the better Markets might be made of all the rest; himself being allways a sharer with the Merchants, who made any purchases of that kind: as he had, from the time that his Highness first came into that Port, all∣ways insinuated into him in confidence, and under great good will and <MILESTONE N="20"/> trust, <Q>“that he should use all expedition in the sale of the Prizes, lest either <HI>Cromwell</HI> should demand the whole (which he much doubted) or that the Merchants, Owners of the Goods, should upon the hearing where they were, send and arrest the said Ships and Goods, and de∣mand restitution to be made of them in a course of Justice; in either” of which cases,</Q> he said, <Q>“he did not know, considering how things stood with <HI>England,</HI> what the Court would determine: though, he promised, he would extend his Authority to serve the Prince, as far as he could with his own safety; and defer the publishing and exe∣cution of any Orders he should receive, till the Prince might facili∣tate” <MILESTONE N="30"/> the dispatch:</Q> and by this kind Advice very good Bargains had been made for those Goods which had been sold; of which the Mar∣shal had an Account to his own desire.</P>
<P>BUT when, upon this unwelcome Advertisement, the King made his Address to the Cardinal to revoke this Order; and, as the best rea∣son to oblige him to gratify him, told him, <Q>“that the Money, which should be raised upon the Sale of those Cannon, was the only means he had to remove himself out of <HI>France,</HI> which he intended shortly to do, and to go to the hither parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and that his Sister, the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Princess of <HI>Orange,</HI> and He, had some thoughts of finding themselves” together,</Q> in the beginning of the Summer, at the <HI>Spaw:</HI> which in∣deed had newly enter'd into the King's consideration, and had been en∣tertain'd by the Princess Royal; the Cardinal, being well pleased with the reason, told his Majesty, <Q>“that this Order was not newly made, but had been very Ancient, that no Merchants or any private Subjects, should buy any Brass Ordnance in any Port, lest ill use might be made of them; and that the Order was not now reviv'd with any purpose to bring any prejudice to his Majesty; who should be no loser by the restraint; for that himself would buy the Ordnance, and give as much <MILESTONE N="50"/> for them as they were worth; in order to which, he would forthwith send an Agent to <HI>Nantes</HI> to see the Cannon; and, upon conference with a Person employed by the King, they two should agree upon the
<PB N="407" REF="4210"/>
price, and then the Money should be all paid together to his Majesty in” <HI>Paris:</HI></Q> <Q>intimating “that he would dispute the matter afterwards with” <HI>Cromwell;</HI></Q> as if he knew, or foresaw, that he would make some demand.</P>
<P>IT was well for the King that this condition was made for the pay∣ment of this Money in <HI>Paris;</HI> for of all the Money paid or receiv'd at <HI>Nantes,</HI> as well for the Ships, Tackle, and Ordnance, as for the Prize-Goods, not one penny ever came to the King's hands, or to his use, but what he receiv'd at <HI>Paris</HI> from the Cardinal for the Brass Guns which were upon the <HI>Swallow;</HI> for the valuing whereof the King sent one thi∣ther to treat with the Officer of the Cardinal. All the rest was disposed, <MILESTONE N="10"/> as well as receiv'd, by Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> who when he return'd to <HI>Paris,</HI> gave his Majesty a confused Account; <Q>and averr'd, “that the expences had been so great, that there was not only no Money remaining in his” hands, but that there was a debt still due to a Merchant;</Q> which he desired his Majesty to promise to satisfy.</P>
<P>THE King's resolution to go into <HI>Germany</HI> was very grateful to every <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣solves to go in∣to</HI> Germany.</NOTE> body, more from the weariness they had of <HI>France,</HI> than from the fore∣sight of any benefit and advantage that was like to accrue by the re∣move. But his Majesty, who needed no spurs for that journey, was the more disposed to it by the extraordinary importunity of his Friends in <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>England;</HI> who observing the strict correspondence that was between the Cardinal and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and knowing that the Allyance between them was very near concluded, and being inform'd that there were con∣ditions agreed upon, which were very prejudicial to the King, did really apprehend that his Majesty's Person might be given up; and thereupon <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Harry Sey∣mour <HI>sent to the King from his Friends in</HI> England.</NOTE> they sent <HI>Harry Seymour,</HI> who, being of his Majesty's Bed-chamber, and having his leave to attend his own Affairs in <HI>England,</HI> they well knew would be believ'd by the King, and being addressed only to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he might have opportunity to speak with the King privately and undiscover'd, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and return again with security, as he, and divers Messengers of that kind, frequently did. <Q>He was sent by the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> with the privity of those few who were trusted by them, “to be very importunate with the King, that he would re∣move out of <HI>France;</HI> and to communicate to his Majesty all which they receiv'd from Persons who were admitted into many of the secret” resolutions, and purposes of <HI>Cromwell.</HI></Q> And because they well knew in what streights the King was for Money, they found some means at that time to send him a Supply of about three thousand pounds; which the King receiv'd, and kept with great secrecy. <Q>They sent him word <MILESTONE N="40"/> likewise, “that wherever he should choose to reside out of <HI>France,</HI> they were confident his Servants in <HI>England,</HI> under what persecution soe∣ver they lay, would send him some supply: but whilst he remain'd in” <HI>France,</HI> no body would be prevail'd with to send to him.</Q> The King was glad to be confirm'd in the resolution he had taken, by his Friends advice; and that they had in some degree enabled him to prosecute it; which was the more valuable, because it was known to none. Yet his Debts were so great in <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Servants who were to attend him in so ill a condition, and so without all conveniences for a Journey, that, if the Cardinal, over and above the Money for the Cannon (which <MILESTONE N="50"/> the King did not desire to receive till the last) did not take care for the payment of all the Arrears, which were due upon the Assignment they had made to him, he should not be able to make his journey.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="4220"/>
BUT in this he receiv'd some ease quickly; for when the Cardinal was satisfied, that his Majesty had a full resolution to be gone, which he still doubted, till he heard from <HI>Holland</HI> that the Princess Royal did really provide for her Journey to the <HI>Spaw,</HI> he did let the King know, <Q>“that, against the time that his Majesty appointed his remove, his Ar∣rears should be either entirely paid, or so much of his Debts secured <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cardinal pays the King all his Arrears from</HI> France.</NOTE> to his Creditors, as should well satisfy them; and the rest should be” paid to his Receiver for the charge of the Journey;</Q> <Q>and likewise assured his Majesty, “that, for the future, the monthly Assignation should be punctually paid to whomsoever his Majesty would appoint to receive” it.</Q> This promise was better comply'd with than any other that had <MILESTONE N="10"/> been made, till, some years after, the King thought fit to decline the receiving thereof; which will be remember'd in it's place.</P>
<P>ALL things being in this state, the King declared his resolution to be∣gin his Journey, assoon as he could put himself into a capacity of moving, upon the receipt of the Money he expected, and all preparations were made for enabling the family to be ready to wait upon his Majesty, and for the better regulating, and governing it, when the King should be out of <HI>France;</HI> there having never been any order taken in it whilst he remain'd there, nor could be, because his Majesty had allways eaten <MILESTONE N="20"/> with the Queen, and Her Officers had govern'd the expence; so that by the failing of receiving Money that was promised, and by the Queen's Officers receiving all that was paid, to carry on the expence of their Ma∣jesties Table, which the King's Servants durst not enquire into, very few of his Majesty's Servants had receiv'd any wages from the time of his coming from <HI>Worcester</HI> to the remove he was now to make. Nor was it possible now to satisfy them what they might in justice expect, but they were to be contented with such a Proportion as could be spared, and which might enable them, without reproach and scandal, to leave <HI>Paris</HI> and attend him. They were all modest in their desires, hoping that they should be better provided for in another place. But now the <MILESTONE N="30"/> King met with an obstruction, that he least suspected, from the extra∣ordinary narrowness of the Cardinal's nature, and his over good hus∣bandry in bargaining. The Agent he had sent to <HI>Nantes</HI> to view the Cannon, made so many scruples and exceptions upon the price, and upon the weight, that spent much time; and, at last, offer'd much less than they were worth, and than the other Merchant had offer'd, when the Injunction came that restrain'd him from proceeding. The King knew not what to propose in this. <Q>The Cardinal said, “he understood not the price of Cannon himself, and therefore he had employ'd a <MILESTONE N="40"/> Man that did; and it was reasonable for him to govern himself by His conduct; who assured him, that he offer'd as much as they could reasonably be valued at. It was moved on the King's behalf,” that he would permit others to buy them;</Q> which, he said, <Q>“he could not do, because of the King his Master's restraint; and if any Merchant, or other Person, should agree for them, <HI>Cromwell</HI> would demand them wherever they should be found; and there” were not many that would dispute the Right with Him.</Q> In con∣clusion, the King was compell'd to refer the matter to himself, and to accept what he was content to pay; and when all was agreed upon <MILESTONE N="50"/> according to his own pleasure, he required new abatements in the manner of payment of the Money, all allowance for paying it in Gold, and the like, fitter to be insisted on by the meanest Merchant, than by
<PB N="409" REF="4230"/>
a Member of the sacred College, who would be esteem'd a Prince of the Church.</P>
<P>WHILST the King is preparing for his journey to meet the Princess <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Condi∣tion of</HI> King Charles <HI>the first's Children after their Fa¦ther's death.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Orange,</HI> it will be fit to look back a little on the condition of the rest of his Brothers and Sisters. After that the Princess <HI>Henrietta</HI> had been secretly convey'd from <HI>Oatlands</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> by the Lady <HI>Moreton</HI> her Governess, in the year forty six; and the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> in the year forty eight, had made his escape from S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s; where He, and the rest of the Royal Family that remain'd in <HI>England,</HI> were under the care and tuition of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> the Parliament would not <MILESTONE N="10"/> suffer, nor did the Earl desire, that the rest should remain longer under his Government. But the other two, the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> were committed to the Countess of <HI>Leicester;</HI> to whom such an allowance was paid out of the Treasury, as might well defray their expences with that respect that was due to their Birth; which was perform'd towards them as long as the King their Father liv'd. But assoon as the King was murther'd, it was order'd that the Children should be remov'd into the Country, that they might not be the objects of respect to draw the Eyes and Application of People to∣wards them. <Q>The Allowance was retrench'd, that their Attendants and <MILESTONE N="20"/> Servants might be lessen'd; and order was given, “that they should be treated without any Addition of Titles, and that they should sit at” their meat as the Children of the family did, and all at one Table.</Q> Whereupon they were remov'd to <HI>Penshurst,</HI> a House of the Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI>'s in <HI>Kent;</HI> where they liv'd under the tuition of the same Countess, who observ'd the Order of the Parliament with obedience enough: yet they were carefully look'd to, and treated with as much respect as the Lady pretended she durst pay to them.</P>
<P>THERE, by an Act of Providence, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lovel,</HI> an honest Man, who had been recommended to teach the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> whose Mother <MILESTONE N="30"/> was a Daughter of the House of <HI>Leicester,</HI> became likewise Tutor to the Duke of <HI>Glocester;</HI> who was, by that means, well taught in that learning that was fit for his years, and very well instructed in the Principles of Religion, and the Duty that he ow'd to the King his Brother: all which made the deeper impression in his very pregnant nature, by what his memory retain'd of those Instructions which the King his Father had, with much fervour, given him before his death. But shortly after, the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> were remov'd from the government of the Countess of <HI>Leicester,</HI> and sent into the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> to <HI>Carisbrook</HI> Castle; where <HI>Mildmay</HI> was Captain; and the care of <MILESTONE N="40"/> them committed to him, with an Assignation for their maintenance; which he was to order, and which in truth was given as a boon to him; <Q>and he was required strictly, “that no Person should be permitted to kiss their hands, and that they should not be otherwise treated than as” the Children of a Gentleman;</Q> which <HI>Mildmay</HI> observ'd very exactly; and the Duke of <HI>Glocester</HI> was not call'd by any other Style than, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry.</HI> The Tutor was continued, and sent thither with him; which pleased him very well. And here they remain'd at least two or three years. The Princess died in this Place; and, according to the Charity of that time towards <HI>Cromwell,</HI> very many would have it believ'd to <MILESTONE N="50"/> be by poyson; of which there was no appearance, nor any proof ever after made.</P>
<P>BUT whether this reproach and suspicion made any impression in the
<PB N="410" REF="4240"/>
mind of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> or whether he had any jealousy that the Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> who was now about twelve years of Age, and a Prince of ex∣traordinary hopes both from the comliness and gracefulness of his Per∣son, and the vivacity and vigour of his Wit and Understanding, which made him much spoken of, might, at some time or other, be made use of by the discontented Party of his own Army to give him trouble, or whether he would shew the contempt he had of the Royal Family, by sending another of it into the world to try his fortune, he did declare one day to the Parliament, <Q>“that he was well content that the Son of the late King, who was then in <HI>Carisbrook</HI> Castle, should have liberty <MILESTONE N="10"/> to transport himself into any parts beyond the Seas, as he should de∣sire:” which was at that time much wonder'd at, and not believ'd;</Q> and many thought it a presage of a worse inclination; and for some time there was no more speech of it. But notice and advice being sent to the Duke by those who wish'd his Liberty, that he should prosecute the ob∣taining that Order and Release, He, who desired most to be out of re∣straint, sent his Tutor, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lovel,</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> to be advised by friends what he should do to procure such an Order, and Warrant, as was ne∣cessary for his transportation. And he, by the advice of those who wish'd well to the Affair, did so dextrously sollicite it, that he did not only pro∣cure an Order from the Parliament that gave him liberty to go over the <MILESTONE N="20"/> Seas with the Duke, and to require <HI>Mildmay</HI> to permit him to embark, but likewise five hundred pounds from the Commissioners of the Trea∣sury, which he receiv'd, to defray the charges and expences of the Voyage; being left to provide a Ship himself, and being obliged to em∣bark at the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and not to suffer the Duke to go on Shore in any other part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><Q>THIS happen'd in the latter end of the year 1652; and was so well prosecuted, that, soon after, the King receiv'd advertisement from his Sister in <HI>Holland,</HI> “that the Duke of <HI>Glocester</HI> was arriv'd there; and” would be the next day with her;</Q> which was no sooner known than <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Queen very earnestly desired, that he might be presently sent for to <HI>Paris,</HI> that she might see him; which she had never done since he was about a year old; for within such a short time after he was born, the Troubles were so far advanced, that her Majesty made her voyage into <HI>Holland,</HI> and from that time had never seen him. The King could not refuse to satisfy his Mother in so reasonable a desire, though he did suspect that there might be a farther purpose in that design of seeing him, than was then own'd. And therefore he had dispatched presently a Messenger to the <HI>Hague,</HI> that his Brother might make all possible hast to <HI>Paris.</HI> He was accordingly presently sent for, and came safely to <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> to the satisfaction of all who saw him.</P>
<P>NOW all expedition was used to provide for the King's remove, so generally desired of all; and, for the future, the charge of governing the expences of the family, and of payment of the wages of the Servants, and indeed of issuing out all Monies, as well in Journies as when the Court resided any where, was committed to <HI>Stephen Fox,</HI> a young Man <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Stephen Fox <HI>admitted to manage the King's Money.</HI></NOTE> bred under the severe discipline of the Lord <HI>Peircy,</HI> now Lord Cham∣berlain of the King's Houshold. This <HI>Stephen Fox</HI> was very well quali∣fied with Languages, and all other parts of Clerkship, honesty, and dis∣cretion, <MILESTONE N="50"/> that were necessary for the discharge of such a Trust; and in∣deed his great industry, modesty, and prudence, did very much contri∣bute to the bringing the family, which for so many years had been under
<PB N="411" REF="4250"/>
no Government, into very good order; by which his Majesty, in the pinching streights of his condition, enjoyed very much ease from the time he left <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Rupert</HI> was now return'd from <HI>Nantes;</HI> and finding that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>leaves the King; and goes into</HI> Ger∣many.</NOTE> he should receive none of the Money the Cardinal was to pay for the Brass Ordnance, and being every day more indisposed by the chagrin humour of the Keeper (who endeavour'd to enflame him against the King, as well as against most other Men, and thought his Highness did not give evidence enough of his concernment and friendship for him, except he fell out with every body with whom He was angry) resolv'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> to leave the King; wrought upon, no doubt, besides the frowardness of the other Man, by the despair that seem'd to attend the King's For∣tune; and told his Majesty, <Q>“that he was resolv'd to look after his own Affairs in <HI>Germany;</HI> and first to visit his Brother in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and require what was due from him for his Appennage; and then to go to the Emperour, to receive the Money that was due to him upon” the Treaty of <HI>Munster;</HI></Q> which was to be all paid by the Emperour; from the prosecution of which purpose his Majesty did not disswade him; and, possibly, heard it with more indifferency than the Prince ex∣pected; which raised his natural passion; insomuch, as the day when <MILESTONE N="20"/> he took his leave, that no body might imagine that he had any thoughts ever to return to have any relation to, or dependence upon the King, he told his Majesty, <Q>“that, if he pleased, he might dispose of the place” <NOTE PLACE="marg">Resigns to him the place of Master of the Horse.</NOTE> of Master of the Horse;</Q> in which he had been settled by the late King, and his present Majesty had, to preserve that Office for him, and to take away the pretence the Lord <HI>Peircy</HI> might have to it, by his having had that Office to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> recompenced Him with the place of Lord <HI>Chamberlaine,</HI> though not to his full content. But the King bore this Resignation likewise from the Prince with the same countenance as he had done his first resolution; and so, towards the end of <HI>April,</HI> or <MILESTONE N="30"/> the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> his Highness left the King, and begun his Jour∣ney for the <HI>Palatinate.</HI></P>
<P>SHORTLY after the Prince was gone, the King begun to think of a day for his own departure, and to make a List of his Servants he in∣tended should wait upon him. He foresaw that the only end of his journey was to find some place where he might securely attend such a Conjuncture, as God Almighty should give him, that might invite him to new Activity, his present business being to be quiet; <Q>and therefore he was wont to say, “that he would provide the best he could for it,” by having only such about him as could be quiet.</Q> He could not for∣get <MILESTONE N="40"/> the vexation the Lord Keeper had allways given him, and how im∣possible it was for him to live easily with any body; and so, in the making the List of those who were to go with him, he left His name out; which the Keeper could not be long without knowing; <Q>and thereupon he came to the King, and asked him, “whether he did not intend that he should” wait upon him? His Majesty told him,</Q> <Q>“No; for that he resolv'd to make no use of his Great Seal; and therefore that he should stay at <HI>Paris,</HI> and not put himself to the trouble of such a Journey, which” he himself intended to make without the ease and benefit of a Coach:</Q> which in truth he did, putting his Coach-Horses in a Waggon, wherein <MILESTONE N="50"/> his Bed and Cloaths were carried: nor was he owner of a Coach in some years after. The Keeper expostulated with him in vain upon the dis∣honour that it would be to him to be left behind, and the next day
<PB N="412" REF="4260"/>
brought the Great Seal, and deliver'd it to him; <Q>and defired that he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord Keeper</HI> Her∣bert <HI>resigns his Office to the King.</HI></NOTE> “would sign a Paper, in which his Majesty acknowledged, that he had” receiv'd again his Great Seal from him;</Q> which the King very willingly sign'd; and He immediately remov'd his Lodging, and left the Court; and never after saw his Majesty; which did not at all please the Queen; who was as much troubled that He was to stay where She was, as that he did not go with the King.</P>
<P>THE Queen prevailed with the King, at parting, in a particular in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen prevails with the King to leave the Duke of</HI> Glocester <HI>with her.</HI></NOTE> which he had fortified himself to deny her, <Q>which was, “that he would” leave the Duke of <HI>Glocester</HI> with her;</Q> which she asked with so much <MILESTONE N="10"/> importunity, that, without very much disobliging her, he could not resist. <Q>She desired him “to consider in what condition he had been bred till he came into <HI>France,</HI> without Learning either exercise or language, or having ever seen a Court, or good Company; and being now in a place, and at an Age, that he might be instructed in all these, to carry him away from all these Advantages to live in <HI>Germany,</HI> would be interpreted by all the world, not only to be want of kindness towards” his Brother, but want of all manner of respect to Her.</Q> The reason∣ableness of this discourse, together with the King's utter disability to support him in the condition that was fit for him, would easily have <MILESTONE N="20"/> prevailed, had it not been for the fear that the purpose was to pervert him in his Religion; <Q>which when the Queen had assured the King “was not in her thought, and that she would not permit any such attempt” to be made, his Majesty consented to it.</Q></P>
<P>NOW the day being appointed for his Majesty to begin his Journey, the King desired that the Chancellor of the Exchequer might likewise part in the Queen's good grace, at least without her notable disfavour, she having been so severe towards him, that he had not for some Months presum'd to be in her presence: so that though he was very desirous to kiss her Majesty's hand, he himself knew not how to make any Advance <MILESTONE N="30"/> towards it. But the day before the King was to be gone, the Lord <HI>Peircy,</HI> who was directed by his Majesty to speak in the Affair, and who in truth had kindness for the Chancellor, and knew the prejudice against him to be very unjust, brought him word that the Queen was content to see him, and that he would accompany him to her in the Afternoon. Ac∣cordingly at the hour appointed by her Majesty, they found her alone <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Upon the King's depar∣ture from</HI> France, <HI>the Chancellor of the Exchequer had an Au∣dience of the Queen Mo∣ther</HI></NOTE> in her private Gallery, and the Lord <HI>Peircy</HI> withdrawing to the other end of the room, the Chancellor told her Majesty, <Q>“that now she had vouchsased to admit him into her presence, he hoped, she would let him know the ground of the displeasure she had conceiv'd against him; <MILESTONE N="40"/> that so having vindicated himself from any fault towards her Majesty, he might leave her with a confidence in his Duty, and receive her Commands, with an assurance that they should be punctually obeyed” by him.</Q> <Q>The Queen, with a louder voice, and more emotion than she was accustom'd to, told him, “that she had been contented to see him, and to give him leave to kiss her hand, to comply with the King's desires, who had importuned her to it; otherwise, that he liv'd in that manner towards her, that he had no reason to expect to be wel∣come to her: that she need not assign any particular miscarriage of his, since his disrespect towards her was notorious to all Men; and <MILESTONE N="50"/> that all Men took notice, that he never came where she was, though” he lodged under her Roof</Q> (for the House was hers) <Q>“and that she thought she had not seen him in six Months before; which she look'd
<PB N="413" REF="4270"/>
upon as so high an Affront, that only her respect towards the King” prevailed with her to endure it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHEN her Majesty made a pause, the Chancellor said, “that her Majesty had only mention'd his punishment, and nothing of his fault: that how great soever his infirmities were in defect of Understanding, or in good manners, he had yet never been in <HI>Bedlam;</HI> which he had deserv'd to be, if he had affected to publish to the world that he was in the Queen's disfavour, by avoiding to be seen by her: that he had no kind of Apprehension that they who thought worst of him, would ever believe him to be such a fool, as to provoke the Wife of his dead <MILESTONE N="10"/> Master, the greatness of whose Affections to her was well known to him, and the Mother of the King, who subsisted by her favour, and all this in <HI>France,</HI> where himself was a banish'd Person, and she at home, where she might oblige, or disoblige him at her pleasure. So that he was well assured, that no body would think him guilty of so much folly and madness, as not to use all the endeavours he possibly could to obtain her Grace and Protection: that it was very true, he had been long without the presumption of being in her Majesty's pre∣sence, after he had undergone many sharp Instances of her displeasure, and after he had observ'd some alteration and aversion in her Majesty's <MILESTONE N="20"/> looks and countenance, upon his coming into the room where she was, and during the time he stayed there; which others likewise observ'd so much, that they withdrew from holding any conversation with him in those places, out of fear to offend her Majesty: that he had often desired, by several Persons, to know the cause of her Majesty's displea∣sure, and that he might be admitted to clear himself from any unwor∣thy Suggestions which had been made of him to her Majesty; but could never obtain that honour; and therefore he had conceiv'd, that he was obliged, in good manners, to remove so unacceptable an ob∣ject from the eyes of her Majesty, by not coming into her presence; which all who knew him, could not but know to be the greatest Mor∣tification <MILESTONE N="30"/> that could be inflicted upon him; and therefore he most humbly besought her Majesty at this Audience, which might be the last he should receive of her, she would dismiss him with the know∣ledge of what had been taken amiss, that he might be able to make his innocence and integrity appear; which he knew had been blasted by the malice of some Persons; and thereby misunderstood and mis∣interpreted” by her Majesty.</Q> But all this prevailed not with her Ma∣jesty; who, after she had, with her former passion, objected his credit with the King, and his endeavours to lessen that credit which she ought to have, concluded, <Q>“that she should be glad to see reason to change” <MILESTONE N="40"/> her opinion; and so, carelessly, extended her hand towards him;</Q> which he kissing, her Majesty departed to her Chamber.</P>
<P>IT was about the beginning of <HI>June</HI> in the year 1654, that the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King left</HI> Paris <HI>in</HI> June 1654.</NOTE> left <HI>Paris;</HI> and because he made a private journey the first night, and did not joyn his Family till the next day, which administer'd much oc∣casion of discourse, and gave occasion to a bold Person to publish, amongst the Amours of the <HI>French</HI> Court, a particular that reflected upon the Person of the King, though with less Licence than he used towards his own Sovereign, it will not be amiss in this place to mention <MILESTONE N="50"/> a preservation God then wrought for the King, that was none of the least of his Mercies vouchsafed to him; and which shews the wonder∣ful Liberty that was then taken by some near him, to promote their
<PB N="414" REF="4280"/>
own designs, and projects, at the price of their Master's Honour, and the Interest of their Country, or the Sense they had of that Honour and Interest.</P>
<P>THERE was at that time in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> or rather in the jealousy of that Court, a Lady of great beauty, of a presence very grace∣ful and alluring, and a wit and behaviour that captivated those who were admitted into her presence; her extraction was very noble, and her alliance the best under the Crown, her fortune rather competent, than abounding, for her degree; being the Widow of a Duke of an il∣lustrious Name, who had been kill'd fighting for the King in the late <MILESTONE N="10"/> Troubles, and left his Wife childless, and in her full Beauty. The King had often seen this Lady with that esteem, and inclination, which few were without, both her Beauty and her Wit deserving the homage that was paid to her. The Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> who was then a Lieutenant Ge∣neral in the <HI>French</HI> Army, and allways amorously inclined, and the more inclined by the difficulty of the attempt, was grown powerfully in love with this Lady; and to have the more power with her, com∣municated those Secrets of State which concern'd her safety, and more the Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> whose Cousin German she was; the communica∣tion whereof was of benefit, or convenience to both: yet though he <MILESTONE N="20"/> made many Romantick Attempts to ingratiate himself with her, and such as would neither have become, or been safe to any other Man than himself, who was accustom'd to extraordinary flights in the Air, he could not arrive at the high success he proposed. At the same time, the Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> was transported with the same ambition; and though his parts were very different from the others, yet he wanted not art and address to encourage him in those Attempts, and could bear re∣pulses with more tranquillity of mind, and acquiescence, than the other could. When these two Lords had lamented to each other their mu∣tual infelicity, they agreed generously to merit their Mistress's favour by doing her a Service that should deserve it; and boldly proposed to <MILESTONE N="30"/> her the Marriage of the King; who, they both knew, had no dislike of her Person: and they pursued it with his Majesty with all their Ar∣tifices. <Q>They added the reputation of her Wisdom and Virtue to that of her Beauty, and “that she might be instrumental to the procuring more Friends towards his Restoration, than any other Expedient then” in view;</Q> and at last prevailed so far with the King, who no doubt had a perfect Esteem of her, that he made the Overture to her of Mar∣riage; <Q>which she receiv'd with her natural modesty and address, de∣claring her self “”to be much unworthy of that Grace;</Q> <Q>and beseeching <MILESTONE N="40"/> and advising him “to preserve that affection and inclination for an ob∣ject more equal to him, and more capable to contribute to his Ser∣vice;”</Q> using all those Arguments for refusal, which might prevail with and enflame him to new importunities.</P>
<P>THOUGH these Lords made themselves, upon this Advance, sure to go through with their design, yet they foresaw many obstructions in the way. The Queen, they knew, would never consent to it, and the <HI>French</HI> Court would obstruct it, as they had done that of <HI>Made∣moiselle;</HI> nor could they perswade the Lady her self to depart from her dignity, and to use any of those arts which might expedite the de∣sign. <MILESTONE N="50"/> The Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> therefore, that the News might not come to his friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer by other hands, frankly im∣parted it to him, only as a passion of the King's that had exceedingly
<PB N="415" REF="4290"/>
transported him; and then magnified the Lady, <Q>“as a Person that would exceedingly cultivate the King's nature, and render him much more” dextrous to advance his Fortune:</Q> <Q>and therefore he professed, “that he” would not disswade his Majesty from gratifying so noble an affection;</Q> and used many Arguments to perswade the Chancellor too to think very well of the choice. But when he found that he was so far from con∣curring with him, that he reproach'd his great presumption for inter∣posing in an Affair of so delicate a nature, as by his conduct might prove the ruin of the King, he seem'd resolv'd to prosecute it no farther, but to leave it entirely to the King's own Inclination; who, upon serious reflexions upon his own condition, and conference with those he trusted <MILESTONE N="10"/> most, quicly concluded that such a Marriage was not like to yield much advantage to his Cause; and so resolv'd to decline any farther advance towards it. Yet the same Persons perswaded him, that it was a necessary generosity to take his last farewel of her; and so, after he had taken leave of his Mother, he went so much out of his way as to visit her at her House; where those Lords made their last effort; and his Majesty, with great esteem of the Lady's virtue, and wisdom, the next day joyn'd his Family, and prosecuted his Journey towards <HI>Flanders;</HI> his small step out of the way, having raised a confident rumour in <HI>Paris</HI> that he was married to that Lady. <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THE King had receiv'd a Pass from the Arch-Duke, for his passing through <HI>Flanders,</HI> so warily worded, that he could not but take notice, that it was expected and provided for, that he should by no means make any unnecessary stay in his journey; and he found the Gates of <HI>Cambray</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King comes to</HI> Cambray <HI>in his Journey</HI></NOTE> shut when he came thither; and was compell'd to stay long in the af∣ternoon, before they were open'd to receive him; <Q>which they excused, “by reason that they understood the Enemy was at hand, and intended” to sit down before that City;</Q> of which there appear'd in the face of all the People, and the Governour himself, a terrible Apprehension. But, <MILESTONE N="30"/> upon recollection, his Majesty was well receiv'd by the Governour, and treated and lodged that night by him in his House; <Q>who was the better composed by his Majesty's assuring him, “that the <HI>French</HI> Army was at a great distance from him, and that his Majesty had passed through” it the day before (when Marshal <HI>Turenne</HI> had drawn up the Army to receive his Majesty;</Q> <Q>the Duke of <HI>York</HI> having there likewise taken his leave of the King) “and by the march that they then appear'd to make, there was great reason to conclude that they had no design upon <HI>Cam∣bray;”</HI></Q> which good information made the King's presence the more ac∣ceptable. But besides the civility of that supper, and lodging that night, his Majesty had not the least Address from the Arch-Duke, who was <MILESTONE N="40"/> within four or five leagues with his Army, but passed without the least <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King passes through</HI> Flanders <HI>with out being taken notice of by the Arch-Duke.</HI></NOTE> notice taken of him, through those Provinces; so great a terrour pos∣sessed the hearts of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> lest their shewing any respect to the King in his passage through their Country, should incense <HI>Cromwell</HI> against them, whose friendship they yet seem'd to have hope of.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty intended to have made no stay, having receiv'd Letters <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At</HI> Mons <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meets with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI></NOTE> from the <HI>Hague,</HI> that his Sister was already in her journey for the <HI>Spaw.</HI> But, when he came to <HI>Mons,</HI> he found two Gentlemen there, who came out of <HI>England</HI> with Letters and Instructions from those of his Friends there who retain'd their old Affections. By them his Majesty was inform'd, that many of them recover'd new Courage from the Ge∣neral discontent which possessed the Kingdom, and which every day en∣creased
<PB N="416" REF="4300"/>
by the continual Oppressions, and Tyranny they sustain'd. The Taxes and Impositions every day were augmented, and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Council, did greater Acts of Soveraignty than ever King and Parlia∣ment had attempted. All Goals were full of such Persons as contradicted their Commands, and were suspected to wish well to the King; and there appear'd such a rend among the Officers of the Army, that the Protector was compell'd to displace many of them, and to put more con∣fiding Men in their places. And as this remedy was very necessary to be applied for his Security, so it prov'd of great reputation to him, even beyond his own hope, or at least his confidence. For the licence of the Common Soldiers, manifested in their general and publick discourses, <MILESTONE N="10"/> censures, and reproaches of Him, and his Tyrannical proceedings (which Liberty he well knew was taken by many, that they might discover the Affections, and Inclinations of other Men, and for his service) did not much affect him, or was not terrible to him otherwise than as they were Soldiers of this, or that Regiment, and under this or that Captain, whose Officers he knew well hated him, and who had their Soldiers so much at their Devotion, that they could lead them upon any Enter∣prise: and he knew well that this seditious Spirit possessed many of the principal Officers both of Horse and Foot, who hated him now, in the same proportion that they had heretofore lov'd him, above all the world. <MILESTONE N="20"/> This loud distemper grew the more formidable to him, in that he did believe the fire was kindled and blown by <HI>Lambert,</HI> and that they were all conducted and inspired by his melancholick, and undiscern'd Spirit, though yet all things were outwardly very fair between them. Upon this disquisition he saw hazard enough in attempting any Reformation (which the Army thought he durst not undertake to do alone, and they feared not his proceeding by a Council of War, where they knew they had many Friends) but apparent danger, and very probable ruin, if he deferr'd it. And so trusting only to, and depending upon his own Stars, he cashier'd ten or a dozen Officers, though not of the highest Command, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and those whom he most apprehended, yet of those petulant and active humours, which made them for the present most useful to the others, and most pernicious to Him. By this experiment he found the example wrought great effects upon many who were not touch'd by it, and that the Men who had done so much mischief, being now reduced to a pri∣vate condition, and like other particular Men, did not only lose all their credit with the Soldiers, but behaved themselves with much more wa∣riness and reservation towards all other Men. This gave him more ease than he had before enjoy'd, and raised his resolution how to proceed here∣after <MILESTONE N="40"/> upon the like Provocations, and gave him great credit, and autho∣rity, with those who had believ'd that many Officers had a greater in∣fluence upon the Army than himself.</P>
<P>IT was very evident that he had some War in his purpose; for from the time that he had made a Peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he took greater care to encrease his Stores and Magazines of Armes and Ammunition, and to build more Ships, than he had ever done before; and he had given order to make ready two great Fleets in the Winter, under Officers who should have no dependence upon each other; and Land-men were likewise appointed to be levied. Some principal Officers amongst these, <MILESTONE N="50"/> made great professions of Duty to the King; and made tender of their Service to his Majesty by these Gentlemen. It was thought necessary to make a day's stay at <HI>Mons,</HI> to dispatch those Gentlemen; who were
<PB N="417" REF="4310"/>
very well known, and worthy to be trusted. Such Commissions were prepared for them, and such Instructions, as were desired by those who employ'd them. <Q>And his Majesty gave nothing so much in Charge to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ends in</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></NOTE> the Messengers, and to all his Friends in <HI>England</HI> with whom he had correspondence, as “that they should live quietly, without making any desperate or unreasonable attempt, or giving advantage to those who watched them, to put them into Prison, and to ruin their estates and” families.</Q> <Q>He told them, “the vanity of imagining that any Insur∣rection could give any trouble to so well a form'd and disciplin'd Ar∣my, and the destruction that must attend such a rash attempt: that, <MILESTONE N="$$"/> as he would be allways ready to venture his own Person with them in any reasonable, and well form'd undertaking; so he would with pa∣tience attend God's own time for such an opportunity; and, in the mean time, he would sit still in such a convenient place as he should” find willing to receive him;</Q> of which he could yet make no judgement: however, it was very necessary that such Commissions should be in the hands of discreet and able Men, in Expectation of two Contingencies, which might reasonably be expected. The one, such a schis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Ar∣my, as might divide it upon contrary Interests into open Contests, and Declarations against each other, which could not but produce an equal <MILESTONE N="2$"/> schis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Government: the other, the death of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> which was conspired by the Levellers, under several Combinations. And if that fell out, it could hardly be imagined, that the Army would re∣main united to the particular design of any single Person, but that the Parliament, which had been with so much violence turn'd out of doors by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and which took it self to be perpetual, would quickly as∣semble again together, and take upon themselves the supreme Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>LAMBERT, who was unquestionably the second Person in the Com∣mand of the Army, and was thought to be the first in their Affections, <MILESTONE N="$$"/> had had no less hand than <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself in the Dissolution of that Parliament, and was principal in raising him to be Protector under the Instrument of Government; and so could never reasonably hope to be trusted, and employ'd by them in the absolute Command of an Army that had already so notoriously rebell'd against their Masters. Then <HI>Monk,</HI> who had the absolute Command in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was his Rival already, under a mutual jealousy, would never submit to the Govern∣ment of <HI>Lambert,</HI> if he had no other Title to it than his own presumption; and <HI>Harry Cromwell</HI> had made himself so popular in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that he would not, probably, be commanded by a Man whom he knew to be <MILESTONE N="4$"/> his Father's greatest Enemy. These considerations had made that im∣pression upon those in <HI>England</HI> who were the most wary and averse from any rash Attempt, that they all wish'd that Commissions, and all other necessary powers, might be granted by the King, and deposited in such good hands as had the courage to trust themselves with the keep∣ing them, till such a conjuncture should fall out as is mention'd, and of which few Men thought there was reason to despair.</P>
<P>THE King having in this manner dispatch'd those Messengers, and settled the best way he could to correspond with his friends, continued his journey from <HI>Mons</HI> to <HI>Namur;</HI> where he had a pleasant passage by <MILESTONE N="50"/> Water to <HI>Liege;</HI> from whence, in five or six hours, he reach'd the <HI>Spaw,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves at the</HI> Spaw <HI>where he meets the Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess of</HI> O∣range.</NOTE> the next day after the Princess Royal, his beloved Sister, was come thi∣ther, and where they resolv'd to spend two or three months together;
<PB N="418" REF="4320"/>
which they did, to their singular content and satisfaction. And for some time the Joy of being out of <HI>France,</HI> where his Majesty had enjoy'd no other pleasure than being alive, and the delight of the Company he was now in, suspended all thoughts of what place he was next to retire to. For as it could not be fit for his Sister to stay longer from her own Affairs in <HI>Holland,</HI> than the pretence of her health required, so the <HI>Spaw</HI> was a place that no body could stay longer in than the season for the Waters continued; which ended with the Summer.</P>
<P>THE King no sooner arriv'd at the <HI>Spaw,</HI> than the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Rochester <HI>re∣turns to the King from</HI> Ra∣tisbone.</NOTE> return'd thither to him from his Negotiation at <HI>Ratisbone;</HI> where he had remain'd during the Diet, without owning the Character he might have <MILESTONE N="10"/> assumed; yet perform'd all the Offices with the Emperour, and the other Princes, with less noise, and expence, and with the same success as he could have expected from any qualification. The truth is, all the <HI>German</HI> Princes were at that time very poor; and that meeting for the choosing a King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> was of vast expence to every one of them, and full of faction, and contradiction; so that they had little leisure, and less in∣clination, to think of any business but what concern'd themselves: yet in the close of the Diet, by the conduct and dexterity of the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI> who was esteem'd the wisest, and most practical Prince of the Empire, and who, out of meer generosity, was exceedingly affected <MILESTONE N="20"/> with the ill fortune of the King; that Assembly was prevail'd with to grant a subsidy of four Romer months; which is the measure of all <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King ob∣tains a small subsidy from the Diet in</HI> Germany.</NOTE> Taxes, and impositions in <HI>Germany;</HI> that is, by the Romer months, which every Prince is to pay, and cause it to be collected from their Subjects in their own method. This Money was to be paid towards the better support of the King of great <HI>Britain.</HI> And the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI> by his own Example, perswaded as many of the Princes as he had credit with, forthwith to pay their proportions to the Earl of <HI>Rochester;</HI> who was sollicitous enough to receive it. The whole contribution, if it had been generously made good, had not amounted to any considerable Sum <MILESTONE N="30"/> upon so important an occasion. But the Emperour himself paid no∣thing, nor many other of the Princes, amongst whom were the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the <HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>Hesse Cassel,</HI> who had both receiv'd great obligations from King <HI>James,</HI> and the last King his Son: So that the whole that was ever paid to the King, did not amount to ten thou∣sand pounds sterling; a great part whereof was spent in the Negotiation of the Earl, and in the many journies he made to the Princes, being extremely possessed with the Spirit of being the King's General, which he thought he should not be, except he made Levies of Men; for which he was very sollicitous to make Contracts with old <HI>German</HI> Officers, <MILESTONE N="40"/> when there was neither Port in view, where he might embark them, nor a possibility of procuring Ships to transport them, though <HI>Cromwell</HI> had not been possessed of any Naval power to have resisted them; so blind Men are, whose Passions are so strong, and their judgements so weak, that they can look but upon one thing at once.</P>
<P>THAT part of the Money that was paid to his Majesty's use, was ma∣naged with very good Husbandry, and was a seasonable support to his well order'd Family, which with his own Expences for his Table, and his Stable, and the Board-Wages, with which all his Servants from the highest to the lowest were well satisfied, according to the establishment <MILESTONE N="5$"/> after he left <HI>France,</HI> amounted not to above six hundred Pistoles a month; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The monthly Expences of the King's small Family</NOTE> which expence was not exceeded in many years, even until his coming
<PB N="419" REF="4330"/>
into <HI>Holland</HI> in order to his Return into <HI>England.</HI> This method in the managery gave the King great ease; contented, and kept the fa∣mily in better order and humour than could reasonably have been ex∣pected; and was the more satisfactory, by the no-care, and order, that had been observed during all the residence the King had made in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THE King stayed not so long at the <HI>Spaw</HI> as he meant to have done, the small Pox breaking out there; and one of the young Ladies who at∣tended upon the Princess Royal, being seised upon by it, died: so that his Majesty, and his Sister, upon very suddain thoughts, remov'd from <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣moves to</HI> A∣ken <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w.</NOTE> the <HI>Spaw</HI> to <HI>Aken,</HI> or <HI>Aquisgrane,</HI> an Imperial, and Free Town, go∣vern'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> by their own Magistrates; where the King of the <HI>Romans</HI> ought to receive his first Iron Crown, which is kept there. This place is fa∣mous for its hot baths, whither many come after they have drank the cold Waters of the <HI>Spaw,</HI> and was a part of the prescription which the Physicians had made to the Princess, after she should have finish'd her Waters in the other Place. Upon that pretence, and for the use of those Baths, the Courts remov'd now thither; but in truth with a de∣sign that the King might make his residence there, the Town being large, and the Country about it pleasant, and within five hours (for the journies in those Countries are measur'd by hours) of <HI>Maestricht,</HI> the <MILESTONE N="2$"/> most pleasant Seat within the Dominions of the United Provinces. The Magistrates receiv'd the King so civilly, that his Majesty, who knew no other place where he was sure to be admitted, resolv'd to stay there; and, in order thereunto, contracted for a convenient House, which be∣longed to one who was called a Baron; whither he resolv'd to remove, assoon as his Sister, who had taken the two great Inns of the Town for her's, and the King's Accommodation, should return into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>HERE the good old Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who had remain'd in <HI>Hol∣land</HI> from the time that, upon the Treaty of <HI>Breda,</HI> the King had transported himself into <HI>Scotland,</HI> presented himself to his Majesty; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Secretary</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>to the King, and the King</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>him the Sig∣net.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"/> who receiv'd him very graciously, as a Person of great merit and inte∣grity from the beginning of the Troubles, and allways entirely trusted by the King his Father. And now to him the King gave his Signet; which for three years had been kept by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, out of friendship that it might be restored to him. And he had there∣fore refused in <HI>France</HI> to be admitted into the Secretary's Office, which he executed, because he knew that they who advised it, did it rather that <HI>Nicholas</HI> might not have it, than out of any kindness to himself. He held himself obliged by the friendship, that had ever been between them, to preserve it for him; and, assoon as he came to <HI>Aken,</HI> desired <MILESTONE N="40"/> the King to declare him to be his Secretary; which was done; by which he had a fast friend added to the Council, and of general reputation.</P>
<P>WHEN the King remain'd at <HI>Aken,</HI> he receiv'd many Expresses out <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Accounts the King re∣ceives <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of</HI> England.</NOTE> of <HI>England,</HI> which inform'd him of the renew'd courage of his Friends there: that the Faction and Animosity, which every day appear'd be∣tween the Officers of the Army, and in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Council, upon par∣ticular Interest, raised a general opinion and hope, that there would be an absolute rupture between them; when either Party would be glad to make a conjunction with the King's. In order thereunto, there was an Intelligence enter'd into throughout the Kingdom, that they might make use of such an occasion; and they sent now to the King to be di∣rected <MILESTONE N="5$"/> by him, how they should behave themselves upon such and such contingencies; and sent for more Commissions of the same kind as had
<PB N="420" REF="4340"/>
been formerly sent to them. <Q>The King renew'd his Commands to them, <NOTE PLACE="marg">He gives the same Advice as before to his Friends.</NOTE> “not to flatter themselves with vain imaginations; nor to give too easy credit to appearances of Factions and Divisions; which would allways be counterfeited, that they might the more easily discover the Agitations, and Transactions of those upon whom they look'd as” inveterate and irreconcilable Enemies to the Government.</Q></P>
<P>NEWS came from <HI>Scotland,</HI> that <HI>Middleton</HI> had some Successes in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣ceives an ac∣count from</HI> S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>and</HI> Middleton.</NOTE> the High-lands; <Q>and the <HI>Scotish</HI> Lords who were Prisoners in <HI>England,</HI> assured the King, “that there was no so entire a Union in that Na∣tion for his Service, that they wish'd his Majesty himself would ven∣ture” <MILESTONE N="1$"/> thither:</Q> and the Lord <HI>Balcarris,</HI> who was with the King, and entrusted by that People, used much Instance with him to that purpose; which, how unreasonable soever the Advice seem'd to be, Men knew not how to contradict by proposing any thing that seem'd more rea∣sonable; and so underwent the reproach of being lazy and unactive, and unwilling to submit to any fatigue, or to expose themselves to any danger; without which, it was thought, his Majesty could not expect to be restored to any part of his Soveraignty.</P>
<P><Q>THE Chancellor of the Exchequer one day representing to the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor of the Exche∣quer's discourse to the King concerning his going into</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> the sadness of his condition, and the general discourses of Men, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> “that it was his Majesty's misfortune to be thought by many not to be active enough towards his own redemption, and to love his ease too” much,</Q> in respect both of his Age, and his Fortune, <Q>desired him “to consider upon this news, and importunity from <HI>Scotland,</HI> whether in those High-lands there might not be such a safe retreat and residence, that he might reasonably say, that with the affections of that People, which had been allways firm both to his Father and Himself, he might preserve himself in safety, though he could not hope to make any advance, or recover the lower Part of that Kingdom possessed by the Enemy; and if so, whether he might not expect the good hand of <MILESTONE N="30"/> Providence, by some Revolution, more honourably There, than in such Corners of other Princes Dominions, as he might be forced to” put himself into.</Q> His Majesty discoursed very calmly of that Coun∣try, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Reply</NOTE> part whereof he had seen; of the miserable poverty of the People, and their course of Life; <Q>and how “impossible it was for him to live there with security or with health; that, if sickness did not destroy him, which he had reason to expect from the ill Accommodation he must be there contented with, he should in a short time be betray'd” and given up.</Q> <Q>And in this debate, he told him that melancholick Con∣clusion, which <HI>David Lesley</HI> made at <HI>Warrington</HI> Bridge, which is men∣tion'd <MILESTONE N="4$"/> before, when he told the King, “that those Men would never” fight;</Q> <Q>which his Majesty had never, he said, told to any body before. However, he said, “if his Friends would advise him to that Expedi∣tion, he would transport himself into the High-lands; though he” knew what would come of it, and that they would be sorry for it:</Q> which stopp'd the Chancellor from ever saying more to that purpose. And it was not long after that news came, of <HI>Middleton</HI>'s having been like to be given up to the Enemy by the treachery of that People, and of the defeat his Troops had receiv'd, and that he should be at last forced to quit that miserable Country; which, however, he resolved to <MILESTONE N="5$"/> endure, as long as should be possible.</P>
<P>THE Season of the year now begun to approach that would oblige the Princess Royal to return to the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue,</HI> lest the jealous States,
<PB N="421" REF="4350"/>
from her long absence, might be induced to contrive some Act preju∣dicial to her, and her Son; which she was the more liable to, from the unkind Differences between Her and the Princess Dowager, Mother of the deceased Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> a Lady of great cunning and dexterity to promote her own Interest. The air of <HI>Aken,</HI> and the ill smell of the Baths, made that place less agreeable to the King than at first he believ'd it to be; and he wish'd to find a better Town to reside in, which he might be put to endure long. The City of <HI>Cologne</HI> was distant from <HI>Aken</HI> two short days journey, and had the fame of an excellent Situation. But the People were reported to be of a proud and mutinous Nature, <MILESTONE N="1$"/> allways in Rebellion against their Bishop and Prince, and of so much Bigottry in Religion that they had expelled all Protestants out of their City, and would suffer no exercise of Religion, but of the Roman Ca∣tholick. So that there seem'd little hope that they would permit the King to reside there; the rather, because it was the Staple for the Wines of that Country, and maintain'd a good intelligence and trade with <HI>England.</HI> If the King should send thither to provide a House, and de∣clare a purpose to stay there, and they should refuse to receive him, it might be of very ill consequence, and fright any other places, and <HI>Aken</HI> it self, from permitting him to return thither; and therefore that Adven∣ture <MILESTONE N="20"/> was to be avoided. At last it was concluded, that the Princess Royal should make <HI>Cologne</HI> her way into <HI>Holland;</HI> which was reasonable enough, by the convenience of the River for the commodious transpor∣tation of her Goods, and Family: and the King, accompanying her so far, might make a judgement, upon his observation, whether it would be best for him to stay there, or to return to <HI>Aken;</HI> where he would leave his Family, as the place where he had taken a House, and to which he meant in few days to return. With this resolution they left <HI>Aken,</HI> about the middle of <HI>September;</HI> and lodging one night at <HI>Juliers,</HI> a little dirty Town upon a flat, not worthy to have made a Quarrel be∣tween <MILESTONE N="30"/> so many of the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> nor of the fame it got by the Siege, they came the next day to <HI>Cologne;</HI> where they were receiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> Sep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ember <HI>the King and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come to</HI> Cologne</NOTE> with all the Respect, Pomp, and Magnificence, that could be expected, or the City could perform. The House which the Harbingers of the Princess had taken for her Reception, serv'd likewise to accommodate the King; and the Magistrates perform'd their Respects to both with all possible demonstration of civility.</P>
<P>COLOGNE is a City most pleasantly Situated upon the Banks of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> of a large extent, and fair and substantial Buildings; and en∣compassed with a broad and excellent rampart, upon which are fair <MILESTONE N="4$"/> Walks of great Elms, where two Coaches may go on breast, and, for the beauty of it, is not inferior to the Walls of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> but rather superior, because This goes round the Town. The Government is un∣der the Senate and Consuls; <Q>of whom there was one then Consul, who said “he was descended from Father to Son of a Patrician Roman Fa∣mily, that had continued from the time the Colony was first planted” there.</Q> It had never been otherwise subject to the Bishops, than in some points which refer to their Ecclesiastical jurisdiction; which They sometimes endeavouring to enlarge, the Magistrates allways oppose: and that gives the subject of the discourse of Jealousies, and Contests, <MILESTONE N="50"/> between their Prince and Them; which are neither so frequent, nor of that moment, as they are reported to be. The Elector never resides there, but keeps his Court at his Castle of <HI>Bonne,</HI> near four Miles from
<PB N="422" REF="4360"/>
thence. And that Elector, who was of the House of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and a melancholick and peevish Man, had not then been in the City in very many years. The Number of Churches and Religious Houses is incre∣dible; <Q>insomuch as it was then averr'd, “that the Religious Persons and” Church-men made up a full moiety of the Inhabitants of the Town;</Q> and Their interest and authority so far prevailed, that, some few years before the King came thither, they expell'd all those of the Protestant Religion, contrary to the Advice of the wisest of the Magistrates; <Q>who confessed “that the Trade of the Town was much decayed thereby, and” the Poverty thereof much encreased.</Q> And it is very possible, that the vast Number, and unskilful Zeal of the Ecclesiastical and Religious Per∣sons, <MILESTONE N="1$"/> may at some time expose that noble City to the surprise of some powerful Prince, who would quickly deprive them of their long enjoy'd Privileges. And there was, in that very time of the King's stay there, a design by the <HI>French</HI> to have surprised it; <HI>Schomberg</HI> lying many days in wait there, to have perform'd that Service; which was very hardly pre∣vented. The People are so much more civil than they were reported to be, that they seem to be the most conversible, and to understand the Laws of Society and Conversation better than any other People of <HI>Ger∣many.</HI> To the King they were so devoted, that when they understood <MILESTONE N="20"/> he was not so fixed to the resolution of residing at <HI>Aken,</HI> but that he might be diverted from it, they very handsomely made tender to him <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citizens invite the King to reside there.</NOTE> of any accommodation that City could yield him, and of all the Af∣fection and Duty they could pay him; which his Majesty most willingly accepted; and giving Order for the payment of the rent of the House he had taken at <HI>Aken,</HI> which he had not at all used, and other disburs∣ments, which the Master of the House had made to make it the more convenient for his Majesty, and likewise sending very gracious Letters to the Magistrates of that Town, for the civility they had expressed to∣wards him, he sent for that part of his Family which remain'd there, <MILESTONE N="30"/> to attend him at <HI>Cologne;</HI> where he declared he would spend that <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></NOTE> Winter.</P>
<P>ASSOON as the King came to <HI>Cologne,</HI> he sent to the Neighbour Princes, by proper messages and insinuations, for that Money, which by the grant of the Diet, that is, by their own concession, they were obliged to pay to his Majesty; which though it amounted to no great Sums, yet was of great conveniency to his Support. The Duke of <HI>New∣burgh,</HI> whose Court was at <HI>Dusseldorp,</HI> a small day's journey from <HI>Co∣logne,</HI> and by which the Princess Royal was to pass if she made use of the River, sent his Proportion very generously, with many expressions <MILESTONE N="40"/> of great respect and duty, <Q>and with insinuation “that he would be glad to receive the honour of Entertaining the King, and his Sister, in his” Palace, as she return'd.</Q> However he forbore to make any solemn In∣vitation, without which they could not make the Visit, till some Cere∣monies were first adjusted; upon which that Nation is more punctual, and obstinate, than any other People in <HI>Europe.</HI> He who gave the In∣timation, and came only with a compliment to congratulate his Ma∣jesty's and her Royal Highness's Arrival in those parts, was well instructed in the particulars; of which there were only two of Moment, and the rest were formalities from which they might recede, if those two were <MILESTONE N="50"/> consented to. <Q>The one was, “that the King, at their first meeting,” should at least once treat the Duke with <HI>Altesse;</HI></Q> <Q>the other, “that the” Duke might salute the Princess Royal;</Q> and without consenting to
<PB N="423" REF="4370"/>
these two, there could be no meeting between them. Both the King and his Sister were naturally enough inclined to new sights, and festi∣vities; and the King thought it of moment to him to receive the respect and civility of any of the <HI>German</HI> Princes: and among Them, there were few more considerable in their Dominions, and None in their Per∣sons, than the Duke of <HI>Newburgh;</HI> who reckon'd himself upon the same Level with the Electors. <Q>And the King was inform'd, “that the Em∣perour” himself allways treated him with <HI>Altesse;</HI></Q> and therefore his Majesty made no Scruple of giving him the same. The matter of sa∣luting the Princess Royal was of a new and delicate nature; that dignity <MILESTONE N="10"/> had been so punctually preserv'd, from the time of her coming into <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> that the old Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> Father of her Husband, would ne∣ver pretend to it: yet that Ceremony depending only upon the custom of Countries, and the Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> being a Soveraign Prince, in∣ferior to none in <HI>Germany,</HI> and his Embassadour allways covering before the Emperour, the King thought fit, and her Royal Highness consented, that the Duke should salute her. And so all matters being adjusted without any Noise, the King, about the middle of <HI>October,</HI> accom∣panied his Sister by Water to <HI>Dusseldorp;</HI> where they arriv'd between three and four of the Clock in the Afternoon; and found the Duke and <MILESTONE N="20"/> his Duchess waiting for them on the side of the Water; where after having perform'd their mutual Civilities and Compliments, the King, and the Princess Royal, and the Duke and the Duchess of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> went into the Duke's Coach, and the Company into the Coaches which were provided for them, and alighted at the Castle, that was very near; where his Majesty was conducted into his Quarter, and the Princess into Her's, the Duke and the Duchess immediately retiring into their own Quarters; where they new dressed themselves, and visited not the King again till above half an hour before Supper, and after the King and Princess had perform'd their Devotion.</P>
<P>THE Castle is a very princely House, having been the Seat of the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Duke of <HI>Cleve;</HI> which Duchy, together with that of <HI>Juliers,</HI> having lately fallen to Heirs Females (whereof the Mothers of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> were two) when all the Pre∣tenders seising upon that which lay most convenient to them, this of <HI>Dusseldorp,</HI> by agreement, afterwards remain'd still to <HI>Newburgh;</HI> whose Father, being of the Reform'd Religion in the late contention, found the House of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> too strong for him, by having the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the States his fast Friends; and thereupon, that he might have a strong Support from the Emperour and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> became <MILESTONE N="40"/> Roman Catholick, and thereby had the Assistance he expected. At the same time he put his Son, who was then very young, to be bred un∣der the Jesuits; by which Education, the present Duke was with more than ordinary Bigottry zealous in the Roman Religion.</P>
<P>HE was a Man of very fine parts of knowledge, and in his manners and behaviour much the best bred of any <HI>German.</HI> He had the flowing civility, and language of the <HI>French,</HI> enough restrain'd, and controled by the <HI>German</HI> gravity and formality; so that, altogether, he seem'd a very accomplish'd Prince, and became himself very well, having a good Person, and graceful Motion. He was at that time above thirty, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> had been married to the Sister of the former, and the then King of <HI>Po∣land;</HI> who leaving only a Daughter, he was now newly married to the Daughter of the Landgrave of <HI>Hesse Darmstadt,</HI> who upon her mar∣riage
<PB N="424" REF="4380"/>
became Roman Catholick. She had no eminent features of beauty, nor the <HI>French</HI> Language and Vivacity, to contribute to the Entertain∣ment; so that she was rather a Spectator of the festivity, than a part of it. The entertainment was very splendid and magnificent in all prepa∣rations, as well for the Tables which were prepared for the Lords and the Ladies, as That where his Majesty and his Sister and the Duke and the Duchess only sate: the meals, according to the custom of <HI>Germany,</HI> very long, with several sorts of Musick, both of Instruments and Voices; which, if not excellent, was new, and differ'd much from what his Ma∣jesty was accustom'd to hear. There was Wine in abundance, but no <MILESTONE N="1$"/> Man pressed to drink, if he called not for it; and the Duke himself an Enemy to all excesses.</P>
<P>AFTER two days spent in this manner, in which time the King made a great friendship with the Duke, which allways continued, they parted; and there being near the River, distant another short day's jour∣ney, a handsome open Town of good receipt, call'd <HI>Santen,</HI> belonging <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King brings his Sister to</HI> San∣ten <HI>in the Duchy of</HI> Cleve; <HI>where they part; and the King returns to</HI> Cologne.</NOTE> to that part of the Duchy of <HI>Cleve</HI> which was assign'd to the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> the King resolv'd to accompany his Sister thither; where having spent that night, the next morning her Royal Highness, after an unwilling Farewel, prosecuted her journey to <HI>Holland,</HI> and his Ma∣jesty <MILESTONE N="20"/> return'd by Horse to <HI>Cologne;</HI> where the same House was prepared for him in which He and his Sister had inhabited, whilst she stayed there. And by this time the end of <HI>October</HI> was come; which, in those parts, is more than the entrance into Winter. The Magistrates of the City renew'd their civilities, and professions of respect to the King; which they allways made good; nor could his Majesty have chosen a more convenient retreat in any place; and He, being well refresh'd with the divertisements he had enjoyed, betook himself with great chearfulness <NOTE PLACE="marg">His way of life there.</NOTE> to compose his mind to his fortune; and, with a marvellous contented∣ness, prescribed so many hours in the day to his retirement in his closet; <MILESTONE N="30"/> which he employed in reading, and studying, both the <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Languages; and, at other times, walked much upon the Walls of the Town (for, as is said before, he had no Coach, nor would suffer his Sister to leave him one) and sometimes rid into the Fields; and, in the whole, spent his time very well.</P>
<P>THE Nuntio of the Pope resided in that City, and perform'd all respects to his Majesty: He was a proper and grave Man, an <HI>Italian</HI> Bishop, who never made the least scruple at his Majesty's enjoying the liberty of his Chapel, and the exercise of his Religion, though it was very publick; so that in truth his Majesty was not without any respect <MILESTONE N="4$"/> that could be shew'd to him in those parts, save that the Elector never came to see him, though he liv'd within little more than an hour; which he excused by some indisposition of health, and unwillingness to enter into that City; though it proceeded as much from the sullenness, and moroseness of his Nature, unapt for any conversation, and averse from all civilities; which made him for a long time to defer the pay∣ment of his small Quota, which had been granted to the King by the Diet, and was at last extorted from him by an importunity unfit to have been pressed upon any other Prince, or Gentleman. This Elector's de∣fect of urbanity was the more excusable, or the less to be complain'd of, <MILESTONE N="$$"/> since the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> so nearly allied to the Crown, and so much obliged by it, did not think fit to take any notice of the King's being so near him, or to send a Messenger to salute him.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="4390"/>
WITHIN a short time after his Majesty's return to <HI>Cologne,</HI> he re∣ceiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dea∣vours at</HI> Paris <HI>to perv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt the Duke of</HI> Glo∣cester <HI>in his Religion.</HI></NOTE> news that exceedingly afflicted him, and the more, that he knew not what remedy to apply to the mischief which he saw was likely to befall him upon it. From <HI>Paris,</HI> his Majesty heard, that the Queen had put away the Tutor he had left to attend his Brother the Duke of <HI>Glocester;</HI> who remain'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> upon her Majesty's desire, that he might learn his Exercises. <Q>The Queen had conferr'd with him upon “the desperateness of his condition, in respect of the King his Brother's fortune, and the little hope that appear'd that his Majesty could ever be restored, at least if he did not himself become Roman Catholick; <MILESTONE N="10"/> whereby the Pope, and other Princes of that Religion, might be united in his quarrel; which they would never undertake upon any other obligation: that it was therefore fit that the Duke, who had nothing to support him, nor could expect any thing from the King, should be instructed in the Roman Catholick Religion; that so, becoming a good Catholick, he might be capable of those advantages which her Majesty should be able to procure for him: that the Queen of <HI>France</HI> would hereupon confer Abbies, and Benefices upon him, to such a value, as would maintain him in that splendor as was suitable to his Birth: that, in a little time, the Pope would make him a Cardinal; <MILESTONE N="$0"/> by which he might be able to do the King his Brother much service, and contribute to his Recovery; whereas, without this, he must be exposed to great necessity, and misery, for that she was not able any” longer to give him maintainance.</Q> She found the Duke more resolute than she expected from his Age; he was so well instructed in his Reli∣gion, that he disputed against the change; urged the precepts he had re∣ceiv'd from the King his Father, and his dying in the Faith he had pre∣scribed to him; put her Majesty in mind of the promise she had made to the King his Brother at parting; <Q>and acknowledged “that he had ob∣liged himself to his Majesty, that he would never change his Religion; <MILESTONE N="30"/> and therefore besought her Majesty, that she would not farther press” him, at least till he should inform the King of it.</Q> The Queen well enough knew the King's mind, and thought it more excusable to pro∣ceed in that Affair without imparting it to him; and therefore took upon her the Authority of a Mother, and remov'd his Tutor from him; and committed the Duke to the care of Abbot <HI>Mountague</HI> her Almoner; who, having the pleasant Abby of <HI>Pontoise,</HI> entertain'd his Highness there, sequester'd from all resort of such Persons as might confirm him in his averseness from being converted.</P>
<P>ASSOON as the King receiv'd this advertisement, which both the <MILESTONE N="4$"/> Duke and his Tutor made hast to transmit to him, he was exceedingly perplexed. On the one hand, his Majesty knew the reproaches which would be cast upon him by his Enemies, who took all the pains they could to perswade the world, that he himself had changed his Religion; and though his exercise of it was so publick, wherever he was, that Strangers resorted to it, and so could bear witness of it, yet their impu∣dence was such in their positive averment, that they perswaded many in <HI>England,</HI> and especially of those of the Reform'd Religion abroad, that his Majesty was in truth a Papist: and his leaving his Brother be∣hind him in <HI>France,</HI> where it was evident the Queen would endeavour <MILESTONE N="$$"/> to pervert him, would be an Argument, that he did not desire to pre∣vent it: on the other side, he knew well the little credit he had in <HI>France,</HI> and how sar they would be from assisting him, in a contest of such a na∣ture
<PB N="426" REF="4400"/>
with his Mother. However, that the world might see plainly that he did all that was in his power, he sent the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sends the Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>into</HI> France <HI>for him.</HI></NOTE> all possible Expedition into <HI>France;</HI> who, he very well knew, would steadily execute his Commands. <Q>He writ a Letter of complaint to the Queen, of her having proceeded in that manner in a matter of so near importance to him, and conjured her “to discontinue the prosecution of it; and to suffer his Brother the Duke of <HI>Glocester</HI> to repair with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> to his presence. He commanded the Duke not to consent to any Propositions which should be made to him for the change of his Religion; and that he should follow the advice of” the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and accompany him to <HI>Cologne.</HI></Q> <Q>And he di∣rected <MILESTONE N="$$"/> the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> “to let M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mountague,</HI> and whosoever of the <HI>English</HI> should joyn with him, know, that they should expect such a resentment from his Majesty, if they did not comply with his Commands, as should be suitable to his honour, and to the affront” they put upon him.</Q></P>
<P>THE Marquis behaved himself with so much wisdom and resolution, that though the Queen was enough offended with him, and with the expostulation the King made with her, and imputed all the King's sharp∣ness and resolution to the Counsel he received from the Marquis and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, yet she thought not fit to extend her <MILESTONE N="20"/> power in detaining the Duke, both against the King's and his own Will; <Q>and the Duke, upon the receipt of the King's Letter, declared “that” he would obey his Majesty;</Q> and the Abbot found, that he must enter into an absolute defiance with the King, if he persisted in advising the Queen not to comply with his Majesty's directions: so that, after two or three days deliberation, the Queen expressing very much displeasure at the King's proceeding, and that she should wholely be devested of the power and authority of a Mother, told the Marquis, <Q>“that the Duke might dispose of himself as he pleased; and that she would not” <MILESTONE N="$$"/> concern her self farther, nor see him any more.</Q> And thereupon the Duke put himself into the hands of the Marquis; who immediately removed him from <HI>Pontoise</HI> to the House of the Lord <HI>Hatton,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Lord, who lived then in <HI>Paris;</HI> where he remain'd for some days, un∣til the Marquis could borrow Money (which was no easy matter) to de∣fray the journey to the King. And then they quickly left <HI>Paris;</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis brings the Duke to</HI> Co∣logne.</NOTE> shortly after came to the King; who was extremely satisfied with the Marquis's Negotiation and Success; and kept his Brother allways with him, till the time that he return'd into <HI>England,</HI> the Queen remaining as much unsatisfied. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>INNOCENT the tenth was now dead; who had outlived the Under∣standing and Judgement he had been formerly Master of, and lost all the Reputation he had formerly gotten; and, as <HI>Jehoram, departed without being desired.</HI> He had fomented the Rebellion in <HI>England</HI> by cherishing that in <HI>Ireland;</HI> whither he had sent a light-headed Nuntio, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> New b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgh <HI>send<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King word, that Card<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nal</HI> Chi∣gi <HI>was chosen Pope; and his discourse with his Majesty concerning making some application to the Pope for supply and as∣sistance.</HI></NOTE> who did much mischief to his Majesty's service, as hath been touched before. The World was in great expectation who should succeed him, when, one day, the Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> sent a Gentleman to the King to bring him the news that Cardinal <HI>Chigi</HI> was chosen Pope; <Q>“of which, the Duke said,” his Majesty had great cause to be glad;</Q> which the King <MILESTONE N="50"/> understood not. <Q>But, the next day, the Duke himself came to the King, and told him, “that he came to congratulate with his Majesty for the election of the new Pope, who call'd himself <HI>Alexander</HI> the seventh;”
<PB N="427" REF="4410"/>
and who, he said, he was confident, would do him great Service;</Q> and thereupon related a discourse that had passed between Him and the new Pope, when he was Nuntio at <HI>Cologne,</HI> some years before: <Q>When They two conferring together (“”as, he said,</Q> <Q>“there was great confidence,” and friendship between them) of the Rebellion in <HI>England,</HI></Q> and of the execrable Murther of the late King, the Nuntio broke out into great passion, even with tears, and said, <Q>“it was a monstrous thing that the two Crowns should weary and spend each others Strength, and Spirits, in so unjust and groundless a War, when they had so noble an occasion to unite their power to revenge that impious Murther, in <MILESTONE N="$$"/> which the honour, and the lives of all Kings, were concern'd; and, he said, the Pope was concern'd never to let either of them to be quiet, till he had reconciled them, and obliged all Christian Kings and States, without consideration of any difference in Religion, to joyn together for the Restoration of the King; which would be the greatest honour the Pope could obtain in this world. All which, he said, the Nuntio spoke with so much warmth and concernment, that he could not doubt, but that now God had raised him to that Chair, he hoped, for that end, he would remember his former opinion, and execute it him∣self;”</Q> <Q>being, he said, “a Man of the most publick heart, and the most” <MILESTONE N="20"/> superior to all private designs, that the world had:</Q> the Duke taking great delight to remember many of his discourses, and describing him to be such a Man, as he was generally believ'd to be for the first two years of his Reign, till he manifested his Affections with more Ingenuity. <Q>The Duke desired his Majesty to consider, “whether there might not be somewhat he might reasonably wish from the Pope; and if it were not fit to be proposed as from his Majesty, he would be willing to pro∣mote it in his own Name, having, he thought, some Interest in his” Holiness.</Q> <Q>And, he said, “he was resolv'd to send a Person purposely to <HI>Rome</HI> with his Congratulation, and to render his obedience to the <MILESTONE N="30"/> Pope; and that he would instruct that Person in whatsoever his Ma∣jesty should wish: and though he could not hope, that any greater matter would be done towards his Majesty's Restoration, till the Peace should be effected between the two Crowns (which he knew the Pope would labour in till he had brought it to pass) yet he could not doubt but that, out of the generosity of his Holiness, his Majesty would re∣ceive some Supply towards his better support; which, for the present, was all that could be expected: that the Person whom he intended to send was a Jesuit, who was at that present in <HI>Newburgh;</HI> but he had, or would send for him: that though he was a Religious Man, yet he was a Person of that experience, temper, and wisdom, that he had <MILESTONE N="40"/> entrusted him in affairs not only of the greatest secrecy, but in Nego∣tiations of the greatest importance; in which he had allways behaved” himself with singular prudence and judgement;</Q> <Q>and he assured his Ma∣jesty “he was equal to any Trust; and if, upon what he had said and offer'd, his Majesty thought he might be of use to him in his journey, he would send him to <HI>Cologne</HI> assoon as he came, that he might attend upon his Majesty, and receive any Commands he would vouchsafe to” lay upon him.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH the King had in truth very little hope that the new Pope <MILESTONE N="5$"/> would be more magnanimous than the old, and did believe that the Maxim, with which Innocent had answer'd those who would have dis∣posed him to supply the King with some Money, <Q>“that he could not,
<PB N="428" REF="4420"/>
with a good Conscience, apply the Patrimony of the Church to the” assistance and support of Hereticks,</Q> would be as current Divinity with <HI>Alexander,</HI> and all his Successors, yet he could not but be abundantly satisfied with the kindness of the Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> and could not conclude how far his Interposition might prevail upon a temper and constitution so refined, and without those Dregs which others had used to carry about them to that promotion: <Q>therefore, after those acknow∣ledgements which were due for the Overtures, his Majesty told him, “that he would entirely commit it to his wisdom, to do those Offices with the new Pope as he thought fit, since he could expect nothing but upon that Account; and that he would do any thing on His part <MILESTONE N="10"/> which was fit for him to do, and which should be thought of moment to facilitate the other Pretences. Whereupon the Duke told him, that the bloody Laws in <HI>England</HI> against the Roman Catholick Reli∣gion made a very great noise in the world; and that his Majesty was generally understood to be a Prince of a tender and merciful nature, which would not take delight in the executing so much cruelty; and therefore he conceiv'd it might be very agreeable to his inclination to declare, and promise, that when it should please God to restore his Majesty to his Government, he would never suffer those Laws to be <MILESTONE N="20"/> executed, but would cause them to be repealed; which generous and pious Resolution made known to the Pope, would work very much upon him, and dispose him to make an answerable return to his Ma∣jesty.”</Q> <Q>The King answer'd, “that his Highness might very safely un∣dertake on his behalf, that if it should be in his Power, it should never be in his Will, to execute those severe Laws: but that it was not in his power absolutely to repeal them; and it would be less in his power to do it, if he declared that he had a purpose to do it: therefore, That must be lest to time; and it might reasonably be presum'd, that he would not be backward to do all of that kind which he should find himself able to do; and the Declaration which he then made, his Ma∣jesty <MILESTONE N="30"/> said, that he would be ready to make to the Person the Duke” meant to send, if he came to him:</Q> which was acknowledged to be as much as could be desired.</P>
<P>GERMANY is the part of the world, where the Jesuits are look'd upon to have the Ascendent over all other Men in the deepest mysteries of State and Policy, insomuch as there is not a Prince's Court of the Roman Catholick Religion, wherein a Man is held to be a good Cour∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, or to have a desire to be thought a Wise Man, who hath not a Je∣suit to his Confessor; which may be one of the reasons, that the Policy of that Nation is so different from, and so much undervalued by the <MILESTONE N="40"/> other politick Parts of the world. And therefore 'tis the less to be won∣der'd at that this Duke, who had himself extraordinary qualifications, retain'd that reverence for those who had taught him when he was young, that he believ'd Them to grow, and to be improv'd as fast as He, and so to be still abler to inform him. Without doubt, he did believe his Je∣suit to be a very wise Man; and, it may be, knew, that He would think so to whom he was sent: and assoon as he came to him, he sent him to the King to be instructed and inform'd of his Majesty's pleasure. The Man had a very good aspect, and less vanity and presumption than that <MILESTONE N="50"/> Society use to have, and seem'd desirous to merit from the King by do∣ing him Service; but had not the same confidence he should do it, as his Master had. And when he return'd from <HI>Rome,</HI> he brought nothing <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effect of this.</NOTE>
<PB N="429" REF="4430"/>
with him from the Pope but general good wishes for the King's Resto∣ration, and sharp complaints against Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> for being deaf to all Overtures of Peace; and that till then all attempts to serve his Majesty would be vain and ineffectual; and concerning any Supply of Money, he told the Duke, that the Pope had used the same Adage that his Predecessor had done; and so that Intrigue was determin'd.</P>
<P>THE rest and quiet that the King proposed to himself in this necessi∣tated <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in</HI> England <HI>by some of the King's Party.</HI></NOTE> retreat, was disturbed by the impatience and activity of his Friends in <HI>England;</HI> who notwithstanding all his Majesty's Commands, and In∣junctions, not to enter upon any suddain and rash Insurrections, which <MILESTONE N="$$"/> could only contribute to their own ruin, without the least benefit or advantage to His service, were so pricked and stung by the insolence of their Enemies, and the uneasiness of their own condition and fortune, that they could not rest. They sent Expresses every day to <HI>Cologne</HI> for more Commissions, and Instructions, and made an erroneous judgement of their own strength and power, by concluding that all who hated the present Government, would concur with them to overthrow it, at least would act no part in the defence of it. <Q>They assured the King, “that they had made sufficient provision of Armes and Ammunition, and had so many Persons engaged to appear upon any day that should be <MILESTONE N="$$"/> assign'd, that they only desired his Majesty would appoint that day; and that they were so united, that even the discovery before the day, and the clapping up many Persons in Prison, which they expected,” should not break the design.</Q> The King doubted they would be de∣ceiv'd; and that, though the Persons who sent those Expresses, were very honest Men, and had serv'd well in the War, and were ready to engage again, yet they were not equal to so great a work. However, it was not fit to discountenance or dishearten them; for, as many of his Party were too restless, and too active, so there were more of them re∣miss and lazy, and even abandon'd to despair. The truth is, the un∣equal temper of those who wish'd very well, and the jealousy, at least <MILESTONE N="30"/> the want of confidence in each other, made the King's part exceeding difficult. Very many who held correspondence with his Majesty, and those he assign'd to that Office, would not trust each other; every body chose their own knot, with whom they would converse, and would not communicate with any body else; for which they had too just excuses from the discoveries which were made every day by want of Wit, as much as want of Honesty; and so Men were cast into Prison, and kept there, upon general Jealousies. But this reservation, since they could not all resolve to be quiet, prov'd very grievous to the King; for he could not convert and restrain those who were too forward, by the coun∣sel <MILESTONE N="4$"/> of those who stood in a better light, and could discern better what was to be done, because they could not be brought together to confer; and they who appear'd to be less desperate, were by the others reproach'd with being less Affectionate, and to want Loyalty as much as Courage: so they who were undone upon one and the same Account, were op∣pressed, and torne in pieces by one and the same Enemy, and could ne∣ver hope for recovery but by one and the same remedy, grew to re∣proach and revile one another, and contracted a greater Animosity be∣tween themselves, than against their Common Adversary: nor could <MILESTONE N="$$"/> the King reconcile this distemper, nor preserve himself from being in∣vaded by it.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Messengers who were sent, were addressed only to the
<PB N="430" REF="4440"/>
King himself, and to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and were so carefully concealed, that no Notice was taken or Advertisement sent by the many Spies, who were suborn'd to give Intelligence of any one Express that was sent to <HI>Cologne,</HI> yet they had commonly some friend or acquaintance in the Court, with whom they conferr'd; and ever re∣turn'd worse satisfied with those who made objections against what they proposed, or seem'd to doubt that they would not be able to perform what they so confidently promised; and it was thought a very reasonable conviction of a Man who liked not the most extravagant Undertaking, if he were not ready to propose a better: so that his Majesty thought fit often to seem to think better of many things promised than in truth <MILESTONE N="10"/> he did. The Messengers, which were sent this Winter to <HI>Cologne</HI> (who, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proposition<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the King to this purpose from</HI> England.</NOTE> I say still, were honest Men, and sent from those who were such) pro∣posed to the King, as they had formerly done, <Q>“that when they were in Armes, and had provided a place where his Majesty might land safely, he would then be with them, that there might be no dispute” upon Command: and in the Spring they sent to him,</Q> <Q>“that the day was appointed, the eighteenth of <HI>April,</HI> when the Rising would be general, and many places seised upon, and some declare for the King,” which were in the hands of the Army:</Q> <Q>for they still pretended, and did <MILESTONE N="20"/> believe, “that a part of the Army would declare Against <HI>Cromwell</HI> at least, though not For the King: that <HI>Kent</HI> was united to a Man; <HI>Dover</HI> Castle would be possessed, and the whole County in Armes upon that day; and therefore, that his Majesty would vouchsafe to be in some place, concealed, upon the Sea-Coast, which it was very easy for him to be on that day; from whence, upon all being made good that was undertaken, and full Notice given to his Majesty that it was so, he might then, and not before, transport himself to that part which he thought to be in the best posture to receive him, and might” give such other directions to the rest as he found necessary:</Q> and even <MILESTONE N="30"/> all these particulars were communicated in confidence by the Messen∣gers to their Friends who were near the King, and who again thought it but reasonable to raise the Spirits of their Friends, by letting them know in how happy a condition the King's Affairs were in <HI>England;</HI> and <Q>“that his Friends were in so good a posture throughout the King∣dom, that they feared not that any discovery might be made to <HI>Crom∣well,”</HI> being ready to own and justify their Counsels with their Swords:</Q> so that all this quickly became more than whisper'd throughout the Court; and <Q>“that the King was only expected to be nearer <HI>England,</HI> how disguised soever, that he might quickly put himself into the head <MILESTONE N="40"/> of the Army that would be ready to receive him, whereby all emula∣tions about Command might be prevented, or immediately taken away; and if his Majesty should now neglect this opportunity, it might easily be concluded, that either he was betrayed, or that his counsels” were conducted by Men of very shallow capacities and understanding.</Q></P>
<P>HOW weakly and improbably soever these preparations were ad∣justed, the day was positively appointed, and was so near, at the time when his Majesty had notice of it, that it was not possible for him to send Orders to contradict it: and he foresaw, that if any thing should be attempted without success, it would be imputed to his not being at <MILESTONE N="$$"/> a distance near enough to countenance it. On the other hand, it was neither difficult, nor hazardous to his Majesty, to remove that reproach, and to be in a place from whence he might advance if there were cause,
<PB N="431" REF="4450"/>
or retire back to <HI>Cologne,</HI> if there were nothing to do; and all this with so little noise, that his absence should scarce be taken notice of. <Q>Here∣upon, the Messenger return'd with the King's approbation of the day, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ap∣proves of the day of Rising.</NOTE> and direction, “that assoon as the day should be past, an Express should” be directed to <HI>Flushing</HI> at the Sign of the City of <HI>Roan</HI></Q> (a known Inn in that Town) <Q>“”to enquire for an <HI>English-</HI>man (whose name was given him</Q>) <Q>“who should be able to inform him, whither he should repair to” speak with the King.</Q></P>
<P>BEFORE the Messenger's departure, or the King's Resolution was taken, the Earl of <HI>Rochester,</HI> who was allways jealous that some body <MILESTONE N="10"/> would be General before him, upon the first news of the general dispo∣sition and resolution to be in Armes, desired the King, <Q>“that he would permit him to go over in disguise, to the end that getting to <HI>London,</HI> which was very easy, he might, upon advising with the principal Per∣sons engaged, of whom there was none who had not been commanded by him, or was not inferior to him in Command, assist them in their enterprise, and make the best of that force which they could bring to∣gether: and if he found that they were not in truth competently pro∣vided to sustain the first shock, he might, by his Advice, and Autho∣rity, compose them to expect a better conjuncture, and in the mean <MILESTONE N="20"/> time to give over all inconsiderate Attempts; and there would be lit∣tle” danger in his withdrawing back again to his Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>WITH this Errand the Earl left <HI>Cologne,</HI> under pretence of pursuing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Rochester <HI>ob∣tains leave of the King to go into</HI> England <HI>in order there∣unto.</HI></NOTE> his business with the <HI>German</HI> Princes, upon the Donative of the Diet; for which he used to make many Journies; and no body suspected that he was gone upon any other design. But when he came into <HI>Flanders,</HI> he was not at all reserv'd; but in the hours of good fellowship, which was a great part of the day and night, communicated his purpose to any Body he did believe would keep him Company, and run the same ha∣zard with him; and finding S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Joseph Wagstaff,</HI> who had serv'd the King <MILESTONE N="30"/> in the last War very honestly, and was then watching at the Sea-Coast to take the first opportunity to transport himself assoon as he should hear of the general Insurrection (which all Letters to all places men∣tion'd as a matter resolv'd on) <HI>Rochester</HI> frankly declared to him what he was going about: so they hired a Bark at <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> and without any <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Joseph Wagstaff <HI>goes with him</HI></NOTE> misadventure, found themselves in safety together at <HI>London:</HI> but ma∣ny of those who should have been in Armes were seised upon, and se∣cured in several Prisons.</P>
<P>THE Messenger being dispatch'd, the King, at the time appointed, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes from</HI> Cologne <HI>to</HI> Zeeland.</NOTE> and that he might be sure to be near at the day, left <HI>Cologne</HI> very early <MILESTONE N="4$"/> in the morning, attended only by the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and one Groom to look to their Horses: nor was it known to any Body, but to the Chancellor and the Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> whither the King was gone, they making such relations to inquisitive People, as they thought fit. The day before the King went, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Mennes,</HI> and <HI>John Nicholas,</HI> eldest Son to the Secretary, were sent into <HI>Zeeland,</HI> to stay there till they should receive farther Orders; the former of them being the Per∣son design'd to be at the Sign of the <HI>Roan</HI> in <HI>Flushing,</HI> and the other to be near to prepare any thing for the King's hand that should be found necessary, and to keep the Ciphers; both of them Persons of undoubted <MILESTONE N="$$"/> fidelity.</P>
<P>THERE was a Gentleman who lived in <HI>Middleburg,</HI> and of one of the best families and the best fortune there, who had married an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
<PB N="432" REF="4460"/>
Lady, who had been brought up in the Court of the Queen of <HI>Bo∣hemia,</HI> and was the Daughter of a Gentleman of a very noble family, who had been long an Officer in <HI>Holland.</HI> The King had made this <HI>Dutch-</HI>man a Baronet; and some who were nearly acquainted with him, were confident that his Majesty might secretly repose himself in his House, without any notice taken of him, as long as it would be ne∣cessary for him to be concealed. And his Majesty being first assured of this, made his journey directly thither, in the manner mentioned be∣fore; and being receiv'd, as he expected, in that House, he gave present notice to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Mennes</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Nicholas,</HI> that they might know whi∣ther <MILESTONE N="10"/> to resort to his Majesty upon any occasion. <Q>Upon his first Arrival there, he receiv'd intelligence, “that the Messenger who had been dis∣patched from <HI>Cologne,</HI> met with cross winds and accidents in his re∣turn, which had been his misfortune likewise in his journey thither; so that he came not so soon to <HI>London</HI> as was expected; whereupon some conceiv'd that the King did not approve the day, and therefore excused themselves from appearing at the time; others were well con∣tent with the excuse, having discern'd, with the approach of the day, that they had embark'd themselves in a design of more difficulty than was at first apprehended; and some were actually seised upon, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> imprison'd, by which they were incapable of performing their pro∣mise.”</Q> Though this disappointment confirm'd the King in his former belief, that nothing solid could result from such a general combina∣tion; yet he thought it fit, now he was in a Post where he might se∣curely rest, to expect what the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI>'s presence, of whose being in <HI>London</HI> he was advertised, might produce. And by this time the Chancellor of the Exchequer, according to Order, was come to <HI>Breda;</HI> from whence he every day might hear from, and send to the King.</P>
<P>THERE cannot be a greater Manifestation of the universal prejudice <MILESTONE N="30"/> and aversion in the whole Kingdom towards <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Govern∣ment, than that there could be so many designs and conspiracies against him, which were communicated to so many Men, and that such signal and notable Persons could resort to <HI>London,</HI> and remain there, without any such information or discovery, as might enable him to cause them to be apprehended; there being no body intent and zealous to make any such discoveries, but such whose trade it was for great Wages to give him those informations, who seldom care whether what they inform be true or no. The Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> consulted with great freedom in <HI>London</HI> with the King's friends; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound that the Persons imprison'd <MILESTONE N="40"/> were only taken upon general suspicion, and as being known to be of that Party, not upon any particular discovery of what they design'd or intended to do; and that the same Spirit still possessed those who were at Liberty. The Design in <HI>Kent</HI> appear'd not reasonable, at least not to begin upon; but he was perswaded (and he was very credulous) that in the North there was a foundation of strong hopes, and a Party ready to appear powerful enough to possess themselves of <HI>York;</HI> nor had the Army many Troops in those parts. In the West likewise there appear'd to be a strong Combination, in which many Gentlemen were engaged, whose Agents were then in <HI>London,</HI> and were exceedingly importu∣nate <MILESTONE N="50"/> to have a day assign'd, and desired no more, than that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Joseph Wagstaff</HI> might be authorised to be in the head of them; who had been well known to them; and he was as ready to engage with them.

Of both these resolutions the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of <HI>Ro∣chester,</HI> who knew where the King was, took care to advertise his Ma∣jesty; who, from hence, had his former faint hopes renew'd; and in a short time after they were so improv'd, that he thought of nothing more, than how he might with the greatest secrecy transport himself into <HI>England;</HI> for which he did expect a suddain occasion.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Joseph Wagstaff</HI> had been formerly Major General of the Foot in the King's Western Army, a Man generally beloved; and though he was rather for execution than counsel, a stout Man, who looked not far before him; yet he had a great companionableness in his nature, <MILESTONE N="2$"/> which exceedingly prevail'd with those, who, in the intermission of fighting, loved to spend their time in jollity and mirth. He, asso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as the day was appointed, left <HI>London,</HI> and went to some of his f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ends Houses in the Country, near the place, that he might assist the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>epa∣rations as much as was possible. Those of <HI>Hamshire</HI> were not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pun∣ctual at their own Rendezvous, as to be present at that near <HI>Salisbury</HI> at the hour; however, <HI>Wagstaff,</HI> and they of <HI>Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tshire,</HI> appear'd ac∣cording <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Rising at</HI> Salisbury.</NOTE> to expectation. <HI>Penruddock,</HI> a Gentleman of a fair fortune, and great zeal and forwardness in the service, <HI>Hugh Grove, Jones,</HI> and other Persons of condition, were there with a Body of near two hun∣dred Horse well arm'd; which, they presumed, would every day be <MILESTONE N="30"/> improv'd upon the access of those who had engaged themselves in the Western Association, especially after the fame of their being up, and ef∣fecting any thing, should come to their ears. They accounted that they were already strong enough to visit <HI>Salisbury</HI> in all its present <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustre, knowing that they had many friends there, and reckoning that all who were not against them, were for them; and that they should there en∣crease their Numbers both in Foot, and Horse; with which the Town then a bounded: Nor did their computation and conjecture fail them. They enter'd the City about five of the Clock in the morning: they ap∣pointed some Officers, of which they had plenty, to cause all the Stables <MILESTONE N="4$"/> to be locked up, that all the Horses might be at their devotion; others, to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eak open the Goales, that all there might attend their Benefactors. They kept a good Body of Horse upon the Market-place, to encounter all opposition; and gave order to apprehend the Judges and the Sheriff, who were yet in their Beds, and to bring them into the Market-place with their several Commissions, not caring to seise upon the Persons of any others.</P>
<P>ALL this was done with so little noise or disorder, as if the Town had been all of one mind. They who were within doors, except they were commanded to come out, stayed still there, being more desirous to <MILESTONE N="5$"/> hear than to see what was done; very many being well pleased, and not willing that others should discern it in their Countenance.

the Judges were brought out in their Robes, and humbly produced their Commissions, and the Sheriff likewise, <HI>Wagstaff</HI> resolv'd, after he had caused the King to be proclaim'd, to cause them all three to be hang'd (who were half dead already) having well con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ider'd, with the Policy which Men in such Actions are naturally possessed with, how he him∣self should be used if he were under their hands, choosing therefore to be before-hand with them. But he having not thought fit to delibe∣rate this before-hand with his friends, whereby their scrupulous Con∣sciences might have been confirm'd, many of the Country Gentlemen were so startled with this proposition, that they protested against it; <MILESTONE N="$$"/> and poor <HI>Penruddock</HI> was so passionate to preserve their lives, as if works of this nature could be done by halves, that the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or General durst not persist in it; but was prevail'd with to dismiss the Judges, and, having taken their Commissions from them, to oblige them upon ano∣ther occasion to remember to whom they ow'd their lives, resolving still to hang the Sheriff; who positively, though humbly, and with many tears, refused to proclaim the King; which being otherwise done, they likewise prevailed with him rather to keep the Sheriff alive, and to carry him with them to redeem an honester Man out of the hands of their Enemies. This seem'd an ill omen to their future agreement, <MILESTONE N="$$"/> and submission to the Commands of their General; nor was the tender∣heartedness so general, but that very many of the Gentlemen were much scandalised at it, both as it was a contradiction to their Commander in Chief; and as it would have been a seasonable Act of severity to have cemented those to perseverance who were engaged in it, and have kept them from entertaining any hopes but in the sharpness of their Swords.</P>
<P>THE Noise of this Action was very great both in and out of the Kingdom, whither it was quickly sent. Without doubt it was a bold enterprise, and might have produced wonderful effects, if it had been <MILESTONE N="30"/> prosecuted with the same resolution, or the same rashness, it was en∣ter'd into. All that was reasonable in the general contrivance of in∣surrection and commotion over the whole Kingdom, was founded upon a supposition of the division and faction in the Army; which was known to be so great, that it was thought <HI>Cromwell</HI> durst not draw the whole Army to a general Rendezvous, out of apprehension that, when they should once meet together, he should no longer be master of them. And thence it was concluded, that, if there were in any one place such a Body brought together as might oblige <HI>Cromwell</HI> to make the Army, or a considerable part of it to march, there would at least be no disposi∣tion <MILESTONE N="40"/> in them to fight to strengthen his Authority, which they abhorr'd. And many did at that time believe, that if they had remain'd with that Party at <HI>Salisbury</HI> for some days, which they might well have done without any disturbance, their Numbers would have much encreased, and their friends farther West must have been prepared to receive them, when their retreat had been necessary by a stronger part of the Armies marching against them. <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself was alarmed; he knew well the distemper of the Kingdom, and in his Army, and now when he saw such a Body gather'd together without any noise, that durst, in the middle of the Kingdom, enter into one of the chief Citys of it, when <MILESTONE N="50"/> his Judges and all the Civil power of that County was in it, and take them Prisoners, and proclaim the King in a time of full Peace, and when no Man durst so much as name him but with a reproach, he could
<PB N="435" REF="4490"/>
not imagine, that such an enterprise could be undertaken without a universal Conspiracy; in which his own Army could not be innocent; and therefore knew not how to trust them together. But all this ap∣prehension <NOTE PLACE="marg">The unfortu∣nate Issue of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> vanish'd, when it was known, that within four or five hours after they had perform'd this exploit, they left the Town with very small encrease or addition to their numbers.</P>
<P>THE truth is, they did nothing resolutely after their first Action; and were in such disorder, and discontent between themselves, that without staying for their friends out of <HI>Hamshire</HI> (who were, to the number of two or three hundred Horse, upon their way, and would <MILESTONE N="10"/> have been at <HI>Salisbury</HI> that night) upon pretence that they were ex∣pected in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> they left the Town, and took the Sheriff with them, about two of the Clock in the afternoon: but were so weary of their day's Labour, and their Watching the night before, that they grew less in love with what they were about, and differ'd again amongst themselves about the Sheriff; whom many desired to be presently re∣leased; and that Party carried it in hope of receiving good Offices after∣wards from him. In this manner they continued on their march West∣ward. They from <HI>Hamshire,</HI> and other places, who were behind them, being angry for their leaving <HI>Salisbury,</HI> would not follow, but <MILESTONE N="20"/> scatter'd themselves; and they who were before them, and heard in what disorder they had left <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> likewise dispersed: so that after they had continued their journey into <HI>Devonshire,</HI> without meeting any who would joyn with them, Horse and Men were so tired for want of meat and sleep, that one single Troop of Horse, inferior in number, and commanded by an Officer of no credit in the War, being in those parts by chance, followed them at a distance, till they were so spent, that he rather intreated than compell'd them to deliver them∣selves; some, and amongst those <HI>Wagstaff,</HI> quitted their Horses, and found shelter in some honest Men's Houses; where they were conceal'd till opportunity serv'd to transport them into the parts beyound the Seas, <MILESTONE N="30"/> where they arriv'd safely. But M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Penruddock,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Grove,</HI> and most of the rest, were taken Prisoners, upon promise given by the Officer that their Lives should be saved; which they quickly found he had no Authority to make good. For <HI>Cromwell</HI> no sooner heard of his cheap Victory, than he sent Judges away with a new Commission of Oyer and Terminer, and Order to proceed with the utmost severity against the Offenders. But <HI>Roles,</HI> his Chief Justice, who had so luckily escaped at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> had not recover'd the fright; and would no more look those Men in the face who had dealt so kindly with him; but expresly <MILESTONE N="40"/> refused to be employ'd in the service, raising some scruples in point of Law, whether the Men could be legally condemned; upon which <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> shortly after, turn'd him out of his Office, having found others who executed his Commands. <HI>Penruddock,</HI> and <HI>Grove,</HI> lost their heads at <HI>Exeter;</HI> and others were hanged there; who having recover'd the faintness they were in when they render'd, died with great cou∣rage and resolution, professing their Duty and Loyalty to the King: many were sent to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and tryed and executed there, in the place where they had so lately triumphed; and some who were con∣demn'd, where there were Fathers, and Sons, and Brothers, that the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Butchery might appear with some remorse, were repriev'd, and sold, and sent slaves to the <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> where their treatment was such, that few of them ever return'd into their own Country. Thus this
<PB N="436" REF="4500"/>
little fire, which probably might have kindled and enflamed all the Kingdom, was for the present extinguish'd in the West; and <HI>Cromwell</HI> secured without the help of his Army; which he saw, by the coun∣tenance it then shew'd when they thought he should have use of them, it was high time to reform; and in that he resolv'd to use no longer delay.</P>
<P>THE Design of the North, which was thought to be much better <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll succes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> likewise of the design in the North▪</NOTE> prepared and provided for, made less noise, and expired more peace∣ably. The Earl of <HI>Rochester,</HI> who saw danger at a distance with great courage, and look'd upon it less resolutely when it was nearer, made <MILESTONE N="1$"/> his journey from <HI>London,</HI> with a friend or two, into <HI>York-shire</HI> at the time appointed; and found such an appearance of Gentlemen upon the place, as might very well have deserv'd his patience. There had been some mistake in the Notice that had been given, and they who did ap∣pear, undertook for many who were absent, that, if he would appoint another short day for a Rendezvous, he should be well attended. <HI>Mar∣maduke Darcy</HI> had spent his time very well amongst them, and found them well disposed, and there could be no danger in staying the time proposed, many of them having Houses, where he might be well con∣cealed, and the Country generally wish'd well to the King, and to those who concern'd themselves in his Affairs. But he took many exceptions; <MILESTONE N="20"/> complain'd, as if they had deceiv'd him; and asked many Questions, which were rather reasonable than seasonable, and which would have furnish'd reasons against entring upon the design, which were not to be urged now when they were to execute, and when indeed they seem'd to have gone too far to retire. He had not yet heard of the ill Success at <HI>Salisbury;</HI> yet he did not think the force which the Gentlemen were confident they could draw together, before they could meet with any opposition, sufficient to enter upon any Action, that was like to be dangerous in the end: So he resolv'd to stay no longer; the Gentlemen being as much troubled that he had come at all; they parted with little <MILESTONE N="$0"/> good Will to each other, the Earl returning through by-roads to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of</HI> Rochester <HI>re∣turns to</HI> Lon∣don; <HI>whence <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e advises the King of the ill <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uccess.</HI></NOTE> which was the securest place, from whence he gave the King no∣tice of the hopelessness of Affairs. If he had not been a Man very for∣tunate in disguises, he could never have escaped so many perambula∣tions. For as he was the least wary in making his Journies in safe hours, so he departed very unwillingly from all places where there was good eating and drinking; and enter'd into Conferences with any Strangers he met, or joyn'd with.</P>
<P>WHEN he return'd from the North, he lodged at <HI>Aylesbury;</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Accident, that be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell him in his return.</NOTE> having been observ'd to ride out of the way in a large ground, not far <MILESTONE N="40"/> from the Town, of which he seem'd to take some Survey, and had asked many questions of a Country Fellow who was there (that ground in truth belonging to his own Wife) the next Justice of Peace had notice of it; who being a Man devoted to the Government, and all that Coun∣try very ill affected allways to the King, and the News of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and the Proclamation thereupon, having put all Men upon their Guard, came himself to the Inn where the Earl was; and being inform'd, that there were only two Gentlemen above at Supper (for S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Nicholas Ar∣morer</HI> was likewise with the Earl, and had accompanied him in that <MILESTONE N="50"/> Journey) he went into the Stable; and upon view of the Horses found they were the same which had been observ'd in the Ground. The Ju∣stice commanded the Keeper of the Inn, one <HI>Gilvy,</HI> who, besides that
<PB N="437" REF="4510"/>
he was a Person notoriously affected to the Government, was likewise an Officer, <Q>“that he should not suffer those Horses, nor the Persons to whom they belonged, to go out of the House, till he, the said Justice, came thither in the morning; when he would examine the” Gentlemen,</Q> who they were, and from whence they came. The Earl was quickly advertised of all that passed below, and enough apprehen∣sive of what must follow in the morning. Whereupon he presently sent for the Master of the House, and no body being present but his Com∣panion, he told him, <Q>“he would put his life into his hands; which he <MILESTONE N="10"/> might destroy or preserve: that he could get nothing by the one, but by the other he should have profit, and the good Will of many Friends,” who might be able to do him good.</Q> Then he told him who he was; and as an earnest of more benefit that he might receive hereafter, he gave him thirty or forty <HI>Jacobus</HI>'s, and a fair gold Chain, which was more worth to be sold than one hundred pounds. Whether the Man was moved by the reward, which he might have possessed without de∣serving it, or by generosity, or by wisdom and foresight, for he was a Man of a very good Understanding, and might consider the changes which follow'd after, and in which this Service prov'd of advantage to <MILESTONE N="20"/> him, he did resolve to permit and contrive their escapes: and though he thought fit to be accountable to the Justice for their Horses, yet he caused two other, as good for their purpose, of his own, to be made ready by a trusty Servant in another Stable; who, about Midnight, conducted them into <HI>London-</HI>way; which put them in safety. The Inn-Keeper was visited in the morning by the Justice; whom he carried into the Stable, where the Horses still stood, he having still kept the Key in his own Pocket, not making any doubt of the Persons whilst he kept their Horses; but the Inn-Keeper confessed they were escaped out of his House in the Night, how or whither he could not imagine. The Ju∣stice <MILESTONE N="30"/> threaten'd loud; but the Inn-Keeper was of that unquestionable fi∣delity, and gave such daily demonstration of his Affection to the Com∣mon-wealth, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> more suspected the connivance of the Ju∣stice (who ought not to have deferr'd the examination of the Persons till the morning) than the Integrity of a Man so well known as the Inn-Keeper was. The Earl remain'd in <HI>London</HI> whilst the enquiry was warm and importunate, and afterwards easily procured a passage for <HI>Flan∣ders;</HI> and so return'd to <HI>Cologne.</HI></P>
<P>ASSOON as the King receiv'd Advertisement of the ill Successes in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King leaves</HI> Zee∣land, <HI>and returns to</HI> Cologne.</NOTE> <HI>England,</HI> and that all their hopes were for the present blasted there, he <MILESTONE N="40"/> left <HI>Zeeland,</HI> and, returning by <HI>Breda,</HI> stayed in a Dorp near the Town, till the Chancellor of the Exchequer attended him; and then return'd with all speed to <HI>Cologne;</HI> where his little Court was quickly gather'd together again, and better disposed to sit still, and expect God's own time. His Majesty was exceedingly afflicted with the loss of so many honest Gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI> who had engaged themselves so despe∣rately, not only without, but expressly against his Majesty's Judge∣ment: and he was the more troubled, because he was from several of his Friends from thence advertised, <Q>“that all his Counsels were dis∣cover'd; and that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had perfect Intelligence of whatsoever <MILESTONE N="50"/> his Majesty resolv'd to do, and of all he said Himself; so that it would not be safe for any Body to correspond with him, or to meddle in his Affairs or Concernments: that his coming into <HI>Zeeland,</HI> and his con∣tinuance there, was known to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> with all the particulars of
<PB N="438" REF="4520"/>
his Motion; that many Persons of condition were seised upon, and imprison'd for having a design to possess themselves of some Towns, and Places of strength; which Intelligence could not be given but” from <HI>Cologne;</HI></Q> implying, <Q>“that the miscarriage in all the last designs, proceeded wholely from the Treason of some Persons near his Ma∣jesty.”</Q> The King did not at all wonder that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and his Instru∣ments, took great pains to make it generally be believ'd, that they knew all that was resolv'd or thought of at <HI>Cologne;</HI> but that any Men who were really devoted to his Service, and who had kindness and esteem for all those who were trusted by his Majesty, should be wrought <MILESTONE N="10"/> upon to believe those reports, very much disturbed him.</P>
<P>WHILST he was in this Agony, and immediately after his return to <HI>Cologne,</HI> a discovery was made of a Villany, that made him excuse <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Discovery of the Trea∣chery of</HI> Man∣ning; <HI>and a particular ac∣count of it.</HI></NOTE> his Friends in <HI>England</HI> for their Jealousy, and yet composed his own mind from any fear of being betrayed, it being an Imposture of such a Nature, as was dangerous and ridiculous together. There was one <HI>Manning,</HI> a proper young Gentleman, bred a Roman Catholick in the Family of the Marquis of <HI>Worcester,</HI> whose Page he had been. His Father, of that Religion likewise, had been a Colonel in the King's Army; and was slain at the Battle of <HI>Alresford;</HI> where this young <MILESTONE N="10"/> Man, being then a Youth, was hurt, and maim'd in the left Arm and Shoulder. This Gentleman came to <HI>Cologne</HI> shortly after the King came thither first, and pretended, <Q>“that he had sold the incumber'd fortune his Father had left him; upon which, he had enough to main∣tain him, and resolv'd to spend it in waiting upon the King, till his Majesty should be able to raise an Army; in which he hoped to have” an opportunity to revenge his Father's blood;</Q> with many discourses of that Nature; and he brought a Letter to D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Earles</HI> from his Uncle <HI>Manning,</HI> who was well known to him, to commend his Nephew to his conversation. He was a handsome Man, had store of good Cloaths, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and plenty of Money; which, with the memory of his Father, easily introduced him, and made him acceptable to the Company that was there. He knew most of the King's Party in <HI>England,</HI> and spoke as if he were much trusted by them, and held correspondence with them; and had every Week the Diurnal, and the News of <HI>London,</HI> which sel∣dom else came so far as <HI>Cologne.</HI> He associated himself most with the good-fellows, and eat in their company, being well provided for the expence. By degrees, he insinuated himself with the Earl of <HI>Roche∣ster,</HI> and told him, <Q>“that all the King's Party look'd upon him, as the General who must govern and command them; for which they were <MILESTONE N="40"/> very impatient: that he himself would be ready to run his Fortune, and attend him into <HI>England;</HI> and that he had two hundred good Men listed, who would appear well mounted and armed, whenever he should require them; and that he knew where good Sums of Mo∣ney” lay ready to be applied to that Service.</Q> The Earl was ravished with this discourse, and look'd upon him as a Man sent from Heaven to advance his designs; and asked him, <Q>“whether he had been with the” Chancellor of the Exchequer,</Q> and communicated all this to him? He said, <Q>“he had, at his first coming to Town, waited upon the Chan∣cellor; and intended to have spoken of this, and much more than he <MILESTONE N="50"/> had yet spoken, if He had been vacant, or willing to hear: but he seem'd to him too reserv'd; which he imputed then to some business that possessed him, and therefore made him a second visit; when he
<PB N="439" REF="4530"/>
found him with the same wariness, and without a desire to be inform'd by him concerning the Affairs of that Kingdom; so that he resolv'd to” visit him no more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN the end, he told the Earl, “that he would impart a secret to him of the last importance, and which he had not yet had opportunity to inform the King of, and, he did believe, it would be the same thing to impart it to his Lordship as to his Majesty himself: the Sum was, that he was trusted by the young Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> whose af∣fections were entire for his Majesty, to assure the King of the fame; <MILESTONE N="10"/> and that though it would not be safe for him to appear in the head, and beginning of an Insurrection, he would advance it as much as if he were there in Person; and because he knew the West was better prepared to begin the Work than any other part of the Kingdom, he had caused three thousand pounds to be laid aside, and kept ready at <HI>Wilton,</HI> which should be deliver'd to any Man, who, in the King's” Name,</Q> <Q>should require it of such a Man (naming a Person, who was known to be much trusted by that Earl) “upon delivery of a private” Token he produced out of his Pocket (which was a clean piece of Paper,</Q> sealed with three impressions of an Antick head in hard Wax) <MILESTONE N="20"/> <Q>“”which,</Q> <Q>he said, “the Earl required him to present to the King when” he thought it might be seasonable.</Q> <Q>He added, “that he would be glad to be himself in that first engagement, and so to be present when that Token should be deliver'd; yet he consider'd, that he was not enough known to have such a Secret imparted to him, as the time of such an action ought to be; and therefore, if it pleased the King, he would presently deliver that Token into his Lordship's hands; who, he was confident, would be the first that would have opportunity to” employ it.</Q></P>
<P>THE Earl had the journey then in his head, which he made shortly <MILESTONE N="30"/> after; and thought such a Treasure as this would much advance the service. He made hast to inform the King of the whole, that he might have his approbation to receive the Token. To that purpose, he brought the Man to the King; who had never before taken other notice of him, than for his bringing the Diurnal constantly to be read to his Majesty after dinner, or supper, as he receiv'd it. He made a large Relation to the King of what the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> had commanded him to say, and presented the Token to his Majesty for the three thousand pounds; the manner of his discourse being such, as the King had not the least suspicion of the truth of it. Assoon as he left the King, the Earl <MILESTONE N="40"/> brought him to the Chancellor, conjuring him to use him with great kindness, and gently reproaching him for his want of Courtesy to him before; which he wonder'd at; for it was very true that <HI>Manning</HI> had visited him twice before, and it was as true, that he had receiv'd him with as much civility as was possible, having known his Father, and most of his Family, and was glad to see him frequently at Prayers, well knowing that he had been bred a Roman Catholick; and the young Man had seem'd much pleased with the Reception he had given him. But from that time that he made that Relation concerning the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> which he repeated over to him as he had related it <MILESTONE N="50"/> to the King, the Chancellor allways suspected him; and could not pre∣vail with himself to have any familiarity with him; which the other complained heavily of, and the Chancellor was much reproached for not treating a Person of so much merit, who had lost his Father and
<PB N="440" REF="4540"/>
been himself maim'd in the King's Service, with more openness; for he did allways use him with all necessary civility. But the Chancellor's knowledge of the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and of the humour that then pos∣sessed him, and of the uneasiness of his own fortune, which did not make him at that time Master of much Money, besides that he be∣lieved that, if the thing were true, he should have receiv'd advertise∣ment sooner of it from a Person who was most trusted by the Earl, and who corresponded very constantly with the Chancellor, made him distrust him. <Q>He therefore told the King, “that he doubted <HI>Manning”</HI> had made that part of the story to make himself the more welcome;</Q> <MILESTONE N="10"/> which his Majesty did not think was a reasonable jealousy; but wish'd him to use all the means he could to discover the truth. The Chan∣cellor had no farther suspicion of him than upon the account of that story, nor the least apprehension that he was a Spy.</P>
<P>WHEN it was publickly known that the King was absent from <HI>Co∣logne,</HI> at that time that he made his journey to <HI>Zeeland,</HI> in the man∣ner that is mention'd before, the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> being departed from thence some time before, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Manning</HI> appear'd wonderfully troubled, and complain'd to some, <Q>“that he being entrusted by all the King's friends, who would not credit any Orders but such as should pass <MILESTONE N="20"/> through his hands, the King was now gone without imparting it to” him;</Q> which would be the ruin of his design. <Q>He went to the Chan∣cellor, and lamented himself, “that there should be any Sword drawn in <HI>England</HI> before His; his Father's blood boiled within him and” kept him from sleep.</Q> <Q>He desired him therefore, “that he would so far communicate the design to him, that he might only know to what part of <HI>England</HI> to transport himself, that he might be in action assoon” as might be possible.</Q> <Q>He could draw nothing from the Chancellor; who told him, “that he knew of no probability of any action; and” therefore could give no advice.</Q> Upon which he complain'd much <MILESTONE N="30"/> of the Chancellor's want of kindness to him: but he lost no time in following the King; and having great acquaintance with <HI>Herbert Price,</HI> a Man much trusted by the Earl of <HI>Rochester,</HI> and that affected to know, or to be thought to know the greatest secrets, he prevail'd with him, upon bearing his Charges, to accompany him, that they might find out where the King was, at least that they might be ready on the Sea Coast, to transport themselves into <HI>England</HI> upon the first occasion. Whether by accident, or that the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> had made any mention of <HI>Zee∣land</HI> to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Price,</HI> thither they both came; and seeing S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Mennes,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Nicholas</HI> there, they believ'd there might likewise be others of <MILESTONE N="40"/> their <HI>Cologne</HI> friends. <HI>Herbert Price,</HI> as he was a Man of a very in∣qusitive nature, watch'd so narrowly, that he found an opportunity to meet the King in an evening, when he used to walk to take a little air after the day's confinement. <Q>The King, since he was discover'd, thought it best to trust him; and charged him not only “to make no discovery, but to remove out of the Island, lest his being seen there, might” raise suspicion in other Men.</Q> He did very importunately desire the King that he might bring <HI>Manning</HI> to speak with him, as not only an honest Man (as no doubt he thought him to be) but a Man of that im∣portance and trust, as might contribute much to his present service. <MILESTONE N="50"/> But the King would by no means admit him, nor did he see him; yet afterwards, upon this reflection, his Majesty concluded that <HI>Cromwell</HI> came to be inform'd of his being in <HI>Zeeland,</HI> without any reproach to
<PB N="441" REF="4550"/>
M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Price</HI>'s fidelity; which was not suspected, though his presumption, and importunity, were allways very inconvenient.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after the King's return to <HI>Cologne, Manning</HI> likewise came thither with his accustom'd confidence. <Q>And in this time the Chancellor receiv'd Advertisement from <HI>England,</HI> “that he had no kind of trust from the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> but on the contrary, had been turn'd out of his Service upon matter of dishonesty; and that he was” a loose Person, of no Reputation:</Q> <Q>and his Majesty was inform'd by others from <HI>Antwerp,</HI> “that every Post brought many Letters for him, <MILESTONE N="10"/> which were taken up there, and transmitted to <HI>Cologne;</HI> and that he had Letters of credit upon a Merchant of <HI>Antwerp</HI> for good Sums of” Money.</Q> All this raised a suspicion in the King; who gave direction to a trusty Person, who was purposely sent to take up all those Letters at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> which were sent thither from <HI>England</HI> for him, it being known under what cover they came, and likewise those which were sent from <HI>Cologne</HI> by him, his address being likewise discover'd. By this means the Party return'd with many great Packets both from, and to him; which being open'd, and read, administer'd matter of great amazement. There were Letters from <HI>Thurlow, Cromwell</HI>'s Secretary <MILESTONE N="20"/> and principal Minister, containing the satisfaction the Protector re∣ceiv'd in the particular Intelligence he receiv'd from him, with short Instructions how he should behave himself. The Person employ'd had been so dextrous, that he brought with him <HI>Manning</HI>'s Letters of three Posts, all full of the most particular things done at <HI>Cologne;</HI> and the particular words said by the King, and Others, that must needs affect those who should receive the Intelligence; but of all which there was nothing true; no such Action had been done, no such word spoken.</P>
<P><Q>IN one Letter, after such information as he thought fit, he said, “that by the next he should send such advice as was of much more mo∣ment <MILESTONE N="30"/> than he had ever yet sent, and above what he had given from <HI>Zeeland,</HI> and by which they might see, that there was nothing so se∣cret at <HI>Cologne,</HI> of which he could not be inform'd, if he had Money” enough;</Q> and therefore desired the Bill for the thousand Crowns might be dispatched. Together with this, the Letter of the subsequent Post was likewise seised upon; and by his Method, which was afterwards discover'd, it was very probable that they were both sent at one and the same time, and by the same Post, though they were of several dates. That of the latter date was very long, and in it was enclosed an Over∣ture or Design for the surprise and taking of <HI>Plymouth;</HI> in which there <MILESTONE N="40"/> was a very exact and true description of the Town, and Fort, and Island, and the present strength and Force that was there. Then a proposition, that a Vessel with five hundred Men (there were no more desired) should come to such a place (a Creek described) and upon a sign then given, such a place in the Town should be first seised upon, whilst others should possess both the Fort, and the Island. The Names of the Per∣sons who undertook to do both the one, and the other, were likewise set down; and they were all Men known to be well affected to the King, who, with the assistance of that five hundred Men, might indeed be able to master the place. For the better going through the Work when it was <MILESTONE N="50"/> thus begun, there was an undertaking that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> and other Persons named, who were all notable Men for their Zeal to the King's Service, should be ready from the <HI>Devonshire</HI> side, as Colonel <HI>Arundel</HI> and others from <HI>Cornwal,</HI> to second and support what was to be done.</P>

<Q>THE Letter inform'd, “that when the King deliver'd that Paper to” the Council (which, he said,</Q> <Q>“”he had receiv'd from a very good hand;</Q> and then the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> made this, and this objection, and others found this, and that difficulty in the Execution of the Enterprise, all which the Chancellor answer'd very clearly, <Q>and the King himself said very much of the easiness of the Undertaking) “there was one dif∣ficulty urged, that the King himself appear'd to be startled at, and look'd upon the Chancellor; who arose from his place, and went to the King's Chair, and whisper'd somewhat in his Ear Whereupon his Majesty told the Lords, that he had indeed forgot somewhat that the Chancellor put him in mind of, and for that particular they should refer the care of it to Him, who would take it upon him; and so the matter was resolv'd, and the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> undertook for the five” hundred Men, and their transportation.</Q> <Q><HI>Manning</HI> concluded, “that if he had Money, they should know constantly how this design should” be advanced, or any other set on foot.</Q> Every Body was exceedingly amazed at this relation, in which there was not one syllable of truth. There had never such a Proposition been made, nor was there any such debate or discourse. There were in his Letter many vain insinuations of his Interest, as if he were never out of the King's company. Two <MILESTONE N="20"/> of the King's Servants were sent to seise upon his Person, and his Pa∣pers; who found him in his Chamber writing, and his Cipher and Pa∣pers before him; all which they possessed themselves of without any resistance. There were several Letters prepared, and made up with the dates proper for many Posts to come, with information, and intelligence, of the same nature as the former.</P>
<P><Q>THE Secretary of State, and one of the Lords of the Council, were sent to examine him; to whom he confessed, without any reserve, “that the Necessity of his Fortune had exposed him to that base condition of life; and, to make himself fit for it, he had dissembled his Reli∣gion; <MILESTONE N="30"/> for, he said, he remain'd still a Catholick: that he was sent over by <HI>Thurlow</HI> to be a Spy wherever the King should be, and had con∣stantly sent him Intelligence, for which he had receiv'd good Sums of Money; yet, that he had been so troubled in mind for the vileness of the life he led, that he was resolv'd, by raising great expectations in them, to draw a good Sum of Money from them; and then to re∣nounce farther correspondence, and to procure the King's pardon, and” faithfully to serve him.</Q> <Q>Being asked, why he made such Relations, which had no truth in them, he answer'd, “that if he had come to the knowledge of any thing which in truth had concern'd the King, he <MILESTONE N="40"/> would never have discover'd it; but he thought it would do no pre∣judice to the King, if he got Money from the Rebels by sending them Lies, which could neither do Them good, nor hurt his Majesty; and therefore all his care was to amuse them with particulars, which he knew would please them; and so when he was alone he allways pre∣pared Letters containing such things as occurr'd to his Invention, to be sent by the succeeding Posts, and that he had never written any thing that was true, but of his Majesty's being in <HI>Zeeland;</HI> which, he” believ'd, could produce no prejudice to him.</Q></P>
<P>THE King now discern'd from whence all the Apprehensions of his <MILESTONE N="50"/> Friends proceeded; and that they had too much ground for their Jea∣lousies; for though none of his Counsels had been discover'd, they who had receiv'd those Letters, might reasonably think that none of them
<PB N="443" REF="4570"/>
were concealed; and might well brag to their Confidents of their know∣ing all that the King did. By this means, such particulars were trans∣mitted to the King's Friends, as could not but very much amuse them, and, no doubt, was the cause of the commitment of very many Per∣sons, and of some who had no purpose to suffer for their Loyalty. His Majesty took care to publish the Transactions of this Man, with the Me∣thod of the Intelligence he gave; by which his Friends discern'd with what shadows they had been affrighted, and his Enemies likewise dis∣cover'd what current ware they had receiv'd for their Money: yet they <MILESTONE N="10"/> endeavour'd to have it believ'd that he was not a Man sent over by Them, but a Secretary in great trust about some Person employed, whom they had corrupted: in which Men were likewise quickly undeceiv'd, and knew that he was a Man without any dependence or relation to, or coun∣tenance from the Court: and the Wretch, soon after, receiv'd the reward due to his Treason.</P>
<P>As the King's hopes were much eclipsed in <HI>England</HI> by the late un∣seasonable Attempt, and the loss of so many gallant Persons, as perish'd, or were undone in it; so <HI>Cromwell</HI> advanced his own credit, and was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell's <HI>Advantage by the Risings of the King's Party:</HI></NOTE> very much enrich'd by it, and more confirm'd with those who were of <MILESTONE N="20"/> doubtful Faith towards him. He lay before under the reproach of de∣vising Plots himself, that the Common-wealth might be thought in dan∣ger, to the end he might have excuse to continue so vast Forces still in pay. Whereas it now appear'd how Active, and confident the King's Party still was, and that they would not have had the presumption to make so bold an Attempt in the middle of the Kingdom, if they had not had good assurance of being seconded; and therefore they were to look upon the fire as only raked up, not extinguish'd. The Success and Triumph of a few desperate Persons at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> that had produced such a consternation throughout the Kingdom, and would have endanger'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> the security of the whole West, if there had not happen'd some Acci∣dental confusion amongst the Undertakers, was evidence enough that there was not yet force sufficient to provide for the safety of the King∣dom; and therefore that it was necessary to make better provision for the quiet of every County, that it might not be endanger'd by every bold Attempt: and the charge that this necessary defence would cause, should in Justice be borne by those who were the Occasion of the Expence.</P>
<P><Q>THEREUPON he made by his own Authority, and that of his Coun∣cil, an Order, “that all those who had ever borne Armes for the King, or had declar'd themselves to be of the Royal Party should be decimated, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Order for Decimating the King's Party</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"/> that is, pay a tenth part of all that Estate which they had left, to sup∣port the charge which the Common-wealth was put to, by the unquiet∣ness of their Temper, and the just Cause of Jealousy which they had” administer'd.</Q> And that the Publick might lose nothing of what he had so frankly given to it, Commissioners were appointed in every County, to value what that tenth part of every such Estate did amount to; and that no Man might have too good a bargain of his own, every Man was obliged to pay as much as those Commissioners judged fit; and till he paid a, besides Imprisonment, which was a judgement a part, and inflicted once or twice a year, as the jealousies wrought, his whole Estate was sequester'd. <MILESTONE N="50"/> And in this decimation there was no consideration taken of former Com∣positions, of any Articles of War, or of any Acts of pardon and indemnity, which had been granted under their great Seal, without enquiry into their Actions, or so much as accusing any of them of any crime or guilt, or of
<PB N="444" REF="4580"/>
having any Correspondence with the King or any body trusted by him; or that they were in any degree privy to the late designs or insurrection.</P>
<P>THAT this Order might be submitted to, and executed, He publish'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Declara∣tion to justi∣fy it.</NOTE> a Declaration to make the Justice, as well as the Necessity of that pro∣ceeding appear; in which he did not only set down the grounds of his present proceeding against the Royal Party, but the rules by which he meant to proceed against any other Party that should provoke, or give him trouble. It was a Declaration worded and digested with much more asperity against all who had served the King, than had ever been before published. Great caution had been hitherto used, as if nothing more <MILESTONE N="10"/> had been design'd that to unite the whole Nation in the joynt defence of the Common Interest, and as if a resolution had been taken to have abo∣lished all Marks of disunition and distinction of Parties, and that all Men, of what condition soever (except those who had been allways excepted by name) who would submit to the Government, should be admitted to have shares, and to act parts in the administration and de∣fence of it. <Q>But now notice was taken of “such an inherent malignity, and irreconcilableness in all those who from the beginning had adhered to the King, and opposed the proceedings of the Parliament, towards all those who had served their Country, and vindicated the Interest <MILESTONE N="20"/> of the People and Nation, that they declined the common rules of ci∣vility, and would have no conversation with them; and, that the same Malice and Animosity might descend to their Posterity, they would not make Marriages, or any friendship or alliance with those who had been separated, or divided from them in those publick differences; and therefore they were not hereafter to wonder, or complain, if they were looked upon as a Common Enemy, which must be kept from being able to do mischief; since they would allways be willing to do all they could; and that they were not to expect to be prosecuted, like other Men, by the ordinary forms of Justice, and to have their <MILESTONE N="30"/> Crimes to be proved by Witnesses, before they should be concluded to be guilty. If any desperate Attempts were undertaken by any of that Party to disturb the publick Peace; that it would be reasonable to conclude that they all wished well to it, though they appeared not to own it: that all Conspiracies of that nature were acted in secret, and were deeds of darkness, and Men might justly be suspected and proceeded against as privy to them, by their common discourses, by” the Company they usually kept, and by their very looks;</Q> with many other expressions, of such an unusual nature in the disquisition of Justice, and legal proceedings, that the King's Party might reasonably conclude, <MILESTONE N="40"/> they had nothing left that they could call their own, but must expect a total extirpation, either by massacre, or transplantation.</P>
<P><Q>BUT then the Declaration took notice likewise of “the factions in the Army, that would not acquiesce in the Government establish'd; but would have another found out, and formed according to their Le∣velling humours; all which distractions, to what other ends soever directed, must so weaken the Common-wealth, if not wisely prevented, as it must in the end be exposed as a Prey to their inveterate Enemies; and therefore, that the same remedies must be apply'd to Them, as to” the others;</Q> with intimation clear enough, <Q>“that the connivance they <MILESTONE N="50"/> had formerly receiv'd, and even the Pardons that had been granted for their former Mutinies and Transgressions, were of no more validity than the Articles, Promises, and Acts of Indemnity, which had been
<PB N="445" REF="4590"/>
granted to the Royal Party: all which were declared to be void and” null, upon any succeeding Delinquency:</Q> so that all discontented Peo∣ple who liked not the present Government, what part soever they had acted in the pulling down the old, whether Presbyterian, Independent, or Leveller, were left to consider of the consequence of those Maxims there laid down; and might naturally conclude, that they were in no better condition of security for what they enjoy'd, and had purchased dear∣ly, than those who by their help were brought to the lowest misery; though, for the present, none but the King's Party underwent that in∣supportable <MILESTONE N="10"/> burthen of Decimation; which brought a vast incredible Sum of Money into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Coffers, the greater part whereof was raised (which was a kind of pleasure, though not ease, to the rest) upon those who never did, nor ever would have given the King the least as∣sistance, and were only reputed to be of his Party because they had not assisted the Rebels with a visible chearfulness, or in any considerable pro∣portion; and had proposed to themselves to sit still as Neuters, and not to be at any charge with reference to either Party; or such who had shelter'd themselves in some of the King's Garrisons for their own conveniency.</P>
<P>THIS Declaration was sent to <HI>Cologne;</HI> where the King caused an An∣swer <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King caused an An∣swer to be made to it</NOTE> to be made to it upon the grounds that were laid down in it; and as if it were made by one who had been allways of the Parliament side, and who was well pleased to see the Cavaliers reduced to that extremity; but with such reflections upon the Tyranny that was exercised over the King∣dom, and upon the foulness of the breach of Trust the Protector was guilty of, that it obliged all the Nation to look upon him as a detestable Enemy, who was to be removed by any way that offer'd it self; many of which ar∣guments were made use of against him in the next Parliament that he call'd; which was not long after.</P>

<PB N="450" REF="4620"/>
Regal Government, to which they had been subject ever since they were a Nation: in seeing the pride and insolence of that People, which had used to practice such ill manners towards their King, suppressed, contemned, and exposed to slavery under the discipline, and castigation of Men who were very few of them born Gentlemen, but bred up in the trades and professions of Common Men. These Men govern'd in their Houses, and prescribed new Laws to them to live by, which they had never been accustom'd to, yet were compell'd to obey, upon pe∣nalty of their Lives, and Estates; whilst their adored Idol, Presbytery, which had pull'd off the Crown from the head of the King, was trod <MILESTONE N="10"/> under foot, and laugh'd at; and their Preachers, who had threaten'd their Princes with their rude thunder of Excommunication, disputed with, scoffed at, and controled by Artificers, and corrected by the strokes and blows of a Corporal; and all this Subjection supported at their own charge, their fierce Governours being paid by them out of their own Estates.</P>
<P>HE then beheld <HI>Ireland,</HI> that begun its Rebellion with inhumane <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> Massacres, and Butcheries of their peaceable and innocent Neighbours, after the other of <HI>Scotland</HI> was suppressed, or so compounded, that the blessing of Peace had again cover'd the three Nations, if this sottish Peo∣ple <MILESTONE N="20"/> had not, without any provocation, but of their own folly and bar∣barity, with that bloody prologue engaged again the three Kingdoms in a raging and devouring War; so that though <HI>Scotland</HI> blew the first Trumpet, it was <HI>Ireland</HI> that drew the first blood; and if they had not at that time rebell'd, and in that manner, it is very probable all the mi∣series which afterwards befel the King, and his Dominions, had been prevented. These unhappy People, when they saw that they could not make War, but were beaten as often as encounter'd, would not yet make Peace; or if they did, they no sooner made it than broke it, with all the circumstances of treachery, and perjury, that can make any soul <MILESTONE N="30"/> Action the most odious. And after they had, for their last preservation, return'd to their obedience to the King, and put themselves again un∣der his Protection, they quickly repented of their Loyalty, offer'd them∣selves to the Soveraignty of a foreign Prince; and when they had seen their natural King murther'd by his other Rebels, for want of that As∣sistance which they might have given him, chose rather to depend on the clemency of the Usurper, driving from them the Governour, and Government of the King: I say, his Majesty saw now this miserable People groveling at the feet of their proud Conquerors, reduced to the lowest desolation, and even to the point of Extirpation; the blood they had wantonly, and savagely spilt in the beginning of the Rebellion, now plentifully revenged in streams of their own blood, from one end of the Kingdom to the other; whilst those Persons who first contriv'd the Re∣bellion, and could never be reached by the King, and they who caused every Peace to be broken which had been made with his Majesty, with all the possible affronts to his Royal dignity and authority, after they had endeavour'd, by all the treacherous Offices against the Royal Power, to reconcile themselves to their new Masters, were every day taken, and infamously put to death by Their authority who usurped the Go∣vernment; who sold, as hath been said before, so many thousands of <MILESTONE N="50"/> them to the services of foreign Princes, under whom they perish'd for want of bread, and without regard: so that there is not an account in History of any Nation, the Jews only excepted, that was ever reduced
<PB N="451" REF="4630"/>
to a more complete misery than the <HI>Irish</HI> were at this time. And all this was the more extraordinary, in that it was without the pity of any, all the world looking upon them as deserving the fate they under∣went.</P>
<P>LASTLY <HI>England,</HI> that seem'd to glory in the Conquest of those <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>of</HI> England</NOTE> two Kingdoms, and to reign peaceably over them, yielded a prospect too, full of variety. Though the King's heart was even broken with the daily informations he receiv'd of the ruin and destruction his faith∣ful and Loyal party underwent; and the butchery frequently acted <MILESTONE N="10"/> upon them, and the extreme Tyranny the Usurper exercised over the whole Nation, was grievous to him, yet he could not be equally af∣flicted to see those who had been the first Authors of the publick Cala∣mity, now so much sharers in it that they were no more Masters of their Estates, than They were whom they had first spoiled; and that themselves were brought and exposed upon those Scaffolds, which they had caused to be erected for others; that little or no part of the new Government was in their hands which had pull'd down the old; and that, after Monarchy had been made so odious to the People, the whole Wealth of the Nation was become at the disposal of a single Person; <MILESTONE N="20"/> and that those Lords, without whose monstrous assistance the Scepter could never have been wrested out of the hands of the King, were now number'd and marshall'd with the dregs of the People: in a word, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was not so jealous of any, as of those who had raised him; and contriv'd, and proposed nothing more to himself, than to suppress those, or to drive them out of the Kingdom, who had been the prin∣cipal means to suppress the Royal Authority, and to drive the Royal Family, and all that adher'd to it, into banishment.</P>
<P>THIS prospect the King had of the three Kingdoms during his resi∣dence at <HI>Cologne;</HI> but with those manifestations of God's Vengeance <MILESTONE N="30"/> upon those ingrateful Nations, of which he had a most tender and com∣passionate feeling, he was not without some glimmering light to dis∣cern an approach of that recompence, which the divine justice usually assigns to those who patiently attend his vindication.</P>
<P>CROMWELL, whose great heart was sollicitous to extend the terror of his Name into foreign Countries, by which method he thought to render the rough and stubborn humours of the People at home more obsequious to him, had, in the beginning of the year 1655, after his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>in the beginning of</HI> 1655 <HI>sent two great Fleets to Sea the one under</HI> Pen, <HI>with a Land Army under</HI> Vena∣bles</NOTE> dissolution of his refractory Parliament, sent two very great Fleets to Sea; the one under <HI>Pen,</HI> consisting of about thirty Ships of War, with <MILESTONE N="40"/> which there was likewise embarked a Land Army, consisting of four or five thousand Foot, and two Troops of Horse, under the Command of General <HI>Venables,</HI> a Gentleman of a good family in <HI>Cheshire;</HI> who had served long in the Army in the condition of a Colonel, and was then call'd out of <HI>Ireland</HI> to command in this Expedition.</P>
<P>BOTH these superior Officers were well affected to the King's Ser∣vice, and were not sond of the Enterprise they were to conduct, the nature of which they yet knew nothing of. They did, by several ways, without any communication with each other (which they had not con∣fidence to engage in) send to the King, that if he were ready with any <MILESTONE N="50"/> Force from abroad, or secure of possessing any Port within, they would, that is either of them would, engage, with the power that was under their charge, to declare for his Majesty. If this had been upon a joynt, and mutual confidence in each other, and that both Fleet, and Land
<PB N="452" REF="4640"/>
Forces, though the Body of Horse was small, would at the same time have set up the King's Standard, it might have been the foundation of some hopeful expectation. But neither of them daring to trust the other, the King could not presume upon any Port; without which neither had promised to engage; nor could he make out of the distinct Overtures (however he might hope to unite them) such a probable At∣tempt, after the miscarriage of so many, as to embark his friends in. So he wished them to reserve their Affections for his Majesty, till a more proper season to discover them; and to prosecute the Voyage to which they were design'd; from which he was not without hope of some <MILESTONE N="10"/> benefit to himself; for it was evident <HI>Cromwell</HI> meant to make some Enemy, which probably might give his Majesty some Friend.</P>
<P>THE other Fleet was not inferior in naval strength, and power, but <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The other Fleet under</HI> Blake.</NOTE> was without a Land Army; and that was committed to the Command of <HI>Blake;</HI> in whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> had all confidence. Neither Fleet knew what the other, or what it self was to do, till each of them came to such a Point; where they were to open their Commissions; and <HI>Crom∣well</HI> had communicated his purpose for either to so very few, that, for many Months after they were both at Sea, no body knew to what they were design'd. Though the intercourse between <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Cardinal was maintain'd with many civilities, and some confidence, yet there was nothing of a Treaty signed; he resolving, as he professed, <Q>“”to give his friendship to that Crown that should best deserve it:</Q> and, without doubt, both Crowns were amused with his preparations, and sollicitous to know where the storm would fall.</P>
<P>SPAIN, that had hitherto kept <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> after he had so many years resided there as Embassadour to the late King, believing they were less faulty in that, than if they should send ano∣ther originally to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> now thought it necessary to omit no occa∣sion to endear themselves to him: and therefore they sent the Marquis <MILESTONE N="30"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Leyda <HI>sent Embassadour by</HI> Spain <HI>to</HI> Cromwell, <HI>who after a Month re∣turns to</HI> Flan∣ders.</NOTE> of <HI>Leyda</HI> with a splendid train, as extraordinary Embassadour, to con∣gratulate all his successes, and to offer him the entire friendship of the Catholick King. The Marquis, who was a wise and a jealous Man, found by his reception, and <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s reservation in all his Audiences, and the approaches he could make, that there was no room left for his Master; and so after a Month spent there, he return'd to look to his Government in <HI>Flanders,</HI> with an expectation that assoon as any News came of the Fleets, they should hear of some Acts of Hostility upon the Subjects of <HI>Spain;</HI> and did all he could to awaken all the Ministers of that King to the same apprehension, and expectation. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THE two Fleets set out from the coast of <HI>England;</HI> that under <HI>Blake,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fleet un∣der</HI> Blake <HI>goes into the</HI> Me∣diterranean.</NOTE> some Months before the other; and made it's course directly to the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> being bound in the first place to suppress the insolence of those of <HI>Algiers,</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> who had infested the <HI>English</HI> Merchants, and were grown powerful in those Seas. When he should have per∣form'd that Service, he was to open another Commission, which would inform him what course he was to steer: the other Fleet under <HI>Pen</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>That under</HI> Pen <HI>to the</HI> Barbadoes.</NOTE> was bound directly to the <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> where they were to open their Commissions, and to deliver Letters to that Governour. There they found, that they were to take in new Men for the Land Army, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> then to prosecute their Course directly to the Island of <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> The Governour had Orders to supply new Men for the Expedition; and there were Ships ready for their transportation, there being a mar∣vellous
<PB N="453" REF="4650"/>
alacrity in the Planters of those <HI>Leeward</HI> Islands, which were overstock'd with Inhabitants, to seek their Fortune farther from home. So that, after a shorter stay at the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> than they had reason to expect, having now found there two Frigats (which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had sent before to prepare all things ready, and to put several Shallops toge∣ther, which were brought ready in quarters) and making prize of about forty <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, belonging to their new Allies of <HI>Holland,</HI> for trading thither (contrary to the Act of Navigation) about the end of <HI>March</HI> they set sail, with an addition of four or five thousand Foot for the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Land Army, towards S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Christophers;</HI> where, after a short stay, they receiv'd about fifteen hundred Men more: so that <HI>Venables</HI> had now under his Command a Body of above nine thousand Men, with one Troop of Horse more, which the Planters of the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> joyn'd to him; and having a prosperous wind, they came, about the middle of <HI>April,</HI> within view of <HI>Santo Domingo;</HI> which is the chief City and Port <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Hi∣spaniola:</NOTE> of the Island of <HI>Hispaniola.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR Orders from <HI>Cromwell</HI> were very particular, and very posi∣tive, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Orders.</NOTE> that they should land at such a place, which was plainly enough described to them. But whether they did not clearly understand it, or <MILESTONE N="20"/> thought it not so convenient, when they were near enough to make a judgement of it, they called a Council of War; and it was there resolv'd that General <HI>Venables</HI> should land in another place (which they con∣ceiv'd to be much nearer the Town than in truth it was) and from thence march directly to it, there being another Brigade of Foot to be landed, at a less distance from the Town, in a Bay, that should joyn with them; and joyn they did. But by the march which <HI>Venables</HI> had made, in which he spent two days and a half in the woods and uneasy Passages, and in the terrible heat of that country's Sun, where they found no Water to drink, they were so dispirited before they joyn'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> with their Companions, that it was an ill presage of the misadventure that follow'd. The loss of that time in their Advance had another very ill effect. For the Inhabitants of the Town, that, at the first appearance of such a Fleet, the like whereof in any degree they had never seen before, had been seised upon by such a consternation, that they despair'd of making any resistance, when they saw their Enemies proceed so slow∣ly, and engaged in such a march as must tire and infinitely annoy them, they recover'd their Spirits, and prepared for their Defence. So that when <HI>Venables,</HI> upon the conjunction with his other Forces, and after having found some fresh Water to refresh his Men, advanced towards <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Town, his forlorne hope found themselves charged by a Party of Horse armed with long Lances, and other Armes, which they had not been accustom'd to; so, tired and dismaied with their march and heat, they bore the Charge very ill, and were easily routed, and routed those <NOTE PLACE="marg">Venables <HI>beaten by a few</HI> Spaniards.</NOTE> which were behind them; and were, in that disorder, pursued till they came to their main Body; upon sight whereof the <HI>Spaniard</HI> retired without any loss, having left the Captain of the forlorne hope, and above fifty of his Company, dead upon the place. The <HI>English</HI> retired back in great discomfort to the Bay, and the fresh Water River they had sound there; where they stayed so long, that the General thought his <MILESTONE N="50"/> Men not only enough refresh'd, but enough confirm'd in their resolu∣tions to redeem the shame of their last disorder, having got Guides, who undertook to conduct them a nearer way to the City, and that they should not go near a Fort, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had in a wood, from
<PB N="454" REF="4660"/>
whence they had been infested. The Common opinion that the <HI>Ne∣groes,</HI> Natives of those parts, are such Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they are willing to betray them, and do any mischief to them, might possibly incline the <HI>English</HI> to give credit to those Guides. But they did conduct them directly to the Fort; near which an Ambuscade in the woods discharged a volly again upon the forlorne hope, and fell then in upon them with such fury, that disorder'd the whole Army; which, though it recover'd the courage once more to make an Attempt upon that Fort, was again seised upon by a panick fear, which made them directly fly back to the Bay with the loss of above six hundred Men, <MILESTONE N="50"/> whereof their Major General was one.</P>
<P>THIS fright they never recover'd; but, within few days after, having undergone many distresses by the intolerable heat of the Climate, and the <HI>Negroes</HI> killing their Men every day, as they went into the Woods to find meat, they were, within five or six days after the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> compell'd to reimbark themselves on board the Fleet, with a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He reimbarks, and makes a Descent upon</HI> Jamaica; <HI>where he suc∣ceeds.</HI></NOTE> thousand Men less than had been landed, who had by several ways lost their lives there; for which they revenged themselves upon a neigh∣bour Island, call'd <HI>Jamaica;</HI> where they made another descent, took their City, and drove all the Inhabitants into the Woods. And here <MILESTONE N="20"/> they left a good Body of Foot consisting of three or four thousand Men, under the command of a Colonel, to fortify and plant in this Island, a place fruitful in it self, and abounding in many good provisions, and a perpetual sharp thorn in the sides of the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> who receiv'd exceed∣ing damage from thence; they who were so easily frighted, and beaten, when they were in a great Body upon the other Island, making after∣wards frequent incursions, with small Numbers, into it from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> sacking their Towns, and returning with very rich booty. When <HI>Ve∣nables</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>That Fleet returns into</HI> England.</NOTE> had put this Island into as good order as he could, he return'd with <HI>Pen</HI> into <HI>England.</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THE other Fleet under the Command of <HI>Blake</HI> had better success, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fleet un∣der</HI> Blake <HI>had better success: forces</HI> Algiers <HI>to a Peace; enters the Harbour of</HI> Tunis, <HI>and burns their Fleet</HI></NOTE> without any misadventures. After he had reduced those of <HI>Algiers,</HI> where he anchored in their very Mole, to submit to such conditions for the time past, and the time to come, as he thought reasonable, he sailed to <HI>Tunis;</HI> which he found better fortified and more resolv'd; for that King return'd a very rude Answer, contemning his strength, and undervaluing his Menaces, and refusing to return either Ship or Pri∣soner that had been taken. Whereupon <HI>Blake</HI> put his Fleet in order, and thunder'd with his great Guns upon the Town; whilst he sent out several long Boats manned with stout Mariners, who, at the same time, <MILESTONE N="40"/> enter'd with very notable resolution into their Harbours, and set fire to all the Ships there, being nine Men of War; which were burnt to ashes; and this with the loss only of five and twenty of the <HI>English,</HI> and about eight and forty hurt, all the boats, with the rest of the Men, re∣turning safe to the Ships. This was indeed an Action of the highest conduct and courage, and made the name of the <HI>English</HI> very terrible and formidable in those Seas.</P>
<P>THE Success of both Fleets came to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s notice about the same time, but did not affect him alike. He was never so discomposed (for he had usually a great command over his Passions) as upon the mis∣carriage <MILESTONE N="50"/> at <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> And assoon as they came on shore, he committed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> both <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Venables</HI> to the Tower, and could never be perswaded to trust either of them again; and could not, in a long time, speak tempe∣rately
<PB N="455" REF="4670"/>
of that Affair. However, he lost no time in cherishing his in∣fant Plantation in <HI>Jamaica;</HI> which many thought to be at too great a distance, and wish'd the Men might be recalled; but he would not hear of it; and sent presently a good Squadron of Ships, and a Recruit <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds recruits to</HI> Jamaica.</NOTE> of fifteen hundred Men to carry on that work; and resolv'd nothing more, than to make a continual War from that place upon the <HI>Spa∣niard.</HI></P>
<P><Q>AND now the rupture with <HI>Spain</HI> could be no longer concealed. Therefore he sent Orders to <HI>Blake,</HI> “that he should watch the return <MILESTONE N="10"/> of the Plate-Fleet, and do what mischief he could upon the Coast of” <HI>Spain;</HI> and gave directions to his Ships in the <HI>Downs</HI> to infest those of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which they had not yet done:</Q> what had been hitherto treated privately between Him and the Cardinal, was now exposed to the light. He now sent <HI>Lockhart</HI> his Embassadour into <HI>France;</HI> who <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lockhart <HI>sent by him Em∣bassadour into</HI> France; <HI>who finishes an Al∣hance there, begun before by the Agents of</HI> France <HI>in</HI> England.</NOTE> was receiv'd with great solemnity; and was a Man of great address in Treaty, and had a marvellous credit and power with the Cardinal. He finish'd there the Alliance with <HI>France.</HI> <Q><HI>Cromwell</HI> undertook “to send over an Army of six thousand Foot, to be commanded by their own superior Officer, who was to receive Orders only from Marshal <HI>Tu∣renne:”</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="20"/> and when <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and <HI>Mardike</HI> should be taken, they were to be put into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s hands. There were other more secret Arti∣cles, which will be mention'd.</P>
<P>FLANDERS had notice of this their new Enemy from <HI>England,</HI> be∣fore they heard any thing from <HI>Spain,</HI> that might better enable them to contend with him; and <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> remain'd still in <HI>London</HI> without notice of what was done, till the Affair of <HI>Jamaica</HI> was upon the Ex∣change, and Fraternities enter'd into there for the better carrying on that Plantation. Nor was he willing to believe it then, till <HI>Cromwell</HI> sent to him to leave the Kingdom; which he did very unwillingly, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Don Alonzo <HI>sent to by</HI> Cromwell <HI>to leave</HI> England</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"/> when there was no remedy; and was transported into <HI>Flanders</HI> to en∣crease the jealousies and discontents, which were already too great and uneasy there. The Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> whose Troops, and vigour, were the preservation and life of that Country, was very ill satisfied with the formality and slegm of the Arch-Duke, and with the unactivity and wa∣riness of the <HI>Conte</HI> of <HI>Fuensaldagna;</HI> who he thought omitted many Opportunities.</P>
<P>THE Arch-Duke was weary of the Title of Governour of the Low Countries and General of the Army, when the Power was in truth in <HI>Fuensaldagna,</HI> and nothing to be done without His approbation; and <MILESTONE N="40"/> having by frequent complaints to <HI>Madrid,</HI> endeavour'd in vain to vin∣dicate his authority, had implored his dismission, and <HI>Fuensaldagna</HI> him∣self was as ill satisfied as the other two; and knowing well the defects of the Court, as well as the poverty of <HI>Madrid,</HI> thought the defence of <HI>Flanders</HI> consisted most in preserving the Army, by being on the defensive part; and therefore, to gratify the coldness of his own consti∣tution, he did by no means approve the frequent Enterprises and restless Spirit of the Prince of <HI>Condè;</HI> which spent their Men: and he thought the great charge in supporting the state and dignity of the Arch-Duke, was not recompenced by any benefit from his Service, besides the irre∣concilableness <MILESTONE N="50"/> with the Arch-Duke, by his having compelled him, by the authority of the King, to dismiss the Count of <HI>Swassenburgh;</HI> whom he lov'd of all the world; so that he was likewise weary of his Post, and desired his deliverance to be sent him from <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="4680"/>
THE Council there thought it necessary to gratify them both, and to remove both the Arch-Duke and the <HI>Conde;</HI> honourably to dismiss the former to return to his own residence in <HI>Germany,</HI> and to bring <NOTE PLACE="marg">Don Juan <HI>of</HI> Austria <HI>made Governour of</HI> Flanders; <HI>and</HI> Carracena <HI>ap∣pointed to com∣mand the Ar∣my under him.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Don Juan</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> the natural Son of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had passed through many employments with reputation, and was at that time General in <HI>Italy,</HI> to undertake the Government of <HI>Flanders,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th such restrictions as the King of <HI>Spain</HI> thought fit; and at the same time, that the <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Fuensaldagna</HI> should immediately enter upon the Go∣vernment of <HI>Milan;</HI> which had been exercised for the last six years by the Marquis of <HI>Carracena;</HI> who was now to govern the Army in <HI>Flan∣ders</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> under <HI>Don Juan;</HI> and that the Marquis, who had the most disad∣vantage of this promotion, might be better pleased, they gave him such an addition of authority, as could not but breed ill blood in <HI>Don Juan;</HI> as it fell out afterwards. This counsel was taken, and to be executed in this conjuncture, when <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> were ready to enter <HI>Flanders</HI> with two powerful Armies, whilst it was, upon the matter, under no Command.</P>
<P>THE King was yet at <HI>Cologne;</HI> and no sooner heard of the War that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had begun upon <HI>Spain,</HI> but he concluded that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would not be unwilling to enter into some correspondence with him; <MILESTONE N="20"/> at least, that their fears were over of offending <HI>Cromwell.</HI> He there∣fore <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King had sent to the Arch-Duke to offer his con∣junction before the Arch-Duke left</HI> Flanders.</NOTE> sent privately to the Arch-Duke, and to <HI>Fuensaldagna,</HI> to offer them his Conjunction. <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> was likewise there; and the long Experience he had in <HI>England,</HI> and the Quality he still held, made his judgement in those Affairs most esteem'd by them. He, whether upon the Conscience of his former behaviour, by which he had disobliged both the late and the present King, or whether by having liv'd long in a place where the King's interest was contemned, he did in truth be∣lieve that his Majesty could bring little advantage to them, had no mind to make a conjunction with him: yet they saw one benefit which they <MILESTONE N="30"/> might receive, if his Majesty would draw off the <HI>Irish</HI> from the Service of <HI>France;</HI> which they had reason to believe would be in his power, because he had formerly drawn off some Regiments from <HI>Spain,</HI> whilst he remain'd in <HI>France.</HI> So that they were all of opinion, that they would confer with any body the King should authorize to treat with them; which when the King knew, he resolv'd to go to them Himself; and left <HI>Cologne,</HI> attended only by two or three Servants; and when he came near <HI>Brussels,</HI> sent to advertise the Arch-Duke at what distance <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King came into</HI> Flanders, <HI>and treats with the Arch-Duke near</HI> Brussels.</NOTE> he was; <Q>and “that he would see him <HI>incognito</HI> in what place, or man∣ner,” he should think fit.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>THEY either were, or seem'd to be much troubled that the King was come in Person; and desired, that he would by no means come to <HI>Brussels;</HI> but that he would remain in a little vile Dorp about a league from <HI>Brussels;</HI> where he was very meanly accommodated. Thither the <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Fuensaldagna</HI> and <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> came to his Majesty; and the Arch-Duke met him privately at another place. The King quickly discover'd that <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> had a private Intrigue with some Officers of the <HI>English</HI> Army, who were Enemies to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> upon whose In∣terest he more depended than the King's, and offer'd it as great merit to his Majesty, if he could be able to perswade them to make up a conjun∣ction <MILESTONE N="40"/> with the King. This correspondence between <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> and those Levellers, was managed by an <HI>Irish</HI> Jesuit, who, by speaking <HI>Spanish,</HI> had got himself to be mutually trusted by them. The King
<PB N="457" REF="4690"/>
pressed them <Q>“that he might remove his Family to <HI>Brussels,</HI> or to some place in <HI>Flanders,</HI> that it might be notorious that he was in Alliance with his Catholick Majesty; and then they should quickly see he had another kind of Interest in <HI>England,</HI> than what those Men pretended to, upon whom they ought not to depend; and they would quickly find, if his Majesty resided in that Country, his influence upon the” <HI>Irish</HI> who were in <HI>France.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THEY would by no means consent that his Majesty should remain in <HI>Brussels,</HI> as little at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> or indeed in any place, as taken notice <MILESTONE N="10"/> of by the State to be there; <Q>“which, they said, the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s honour would not permit, without shewing those respects to him that he might live in that Grandeur as became a Great King; which the present state of their affairs would not permit them to defray the charge” of.</Q> <Q>But they intimated, “that if his Majesty would choose to re∣move his family to <HI>Bruges,</HI> and remain there with them, so far <HI>in∣cognito,</HI> as not to expect any publick expensive Reception, they were” sure he would find all respect from the Inhabitants of that City.</Q> The King desired that some Treaty might be signed between them; which was committed to the wisdom of <HI>Don Alonzo;</HI> who prepared it in as <MILESTONE N="20"/> perfunctory a manner as was possible; by which the King was permitted to reside in <HI>Bruges,</HI> <Q>and nothing on the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s part undertaken but “that whenever the King could cause a good Port-Town in <HI>England</HI> to declare for him, his Catholick Majesty would assist him with a Body of six thousand Foot, and with such a proportion of Ammunition,” and so many Ships to transport that Body thither;</Q> which was the proposition the Levellers had made; and <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> by making it the contract with the King, thought this way to beget an Intelligence between them and the Royal Party; of the power of which he had no esteem.</P>
<P>THE King discern'd that what they offer'd would be of no moment, <MILESTONE N="30"/> nor could he make such confident Propositions of advantage to <HI>Spain,</HI> as might warrant him to insist upon large concessions. Besides, it was evident to him, that the affairs in those Provinces, which remain'd un∣der <HI>Spain,</HI> were in so evil a posture, that, if they should promise any great matters, they would not be able to perform them. However, all that he desired, was to have the reputation of a Treaty between Him and the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> under which he might draw his family from <HI>Cologne,</HI> and remain in <HI>Flanders,</HI> which was at a just distance from <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> to expect other Alterations. So his Majesty readily accepted the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Treaty as it was drawn by <HI>Don Alonzo;</HI> and sign'd it; and declared that he would reside in the manner they proposed at <HI>Bruges.</HI> Where∣upon, after seven or eight days stay in that inconvenient manner, the Treaty was engrossed and signed by the King, the Arch-Duke, and <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> or the end of <HI>March</HI> 1657; the dispatch of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Treaty signed</HI> April 165<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ <HI>between</HI> Spain <HI>and the King.</HI></NOTE> Treaty being hastened by the necessity of the departure of the Arch-Duke, and the <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Fuensaldagna;</HI> who begun their Journey within two or three days after the signing of it; <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> being known to be on their way; and both, though not to∣gether, within few days Journey of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>THE Treaty, as it was sign'd, was sent by an Express into <HI>Spain,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> for the approbation and signature of his Catholick Majesty. The King with his small train went to <HI>Bruges,</HI> and lodged in the House of a Sub∣ject of his own, the Lord <HI>Tarah,</HI> an <HI>Irish-</HI>man; who had been born in
<PB N="458" REF="4700"/>
that Country, and inherited an estate by his Mother. There the King stayed, till a handsome Accommodation was provided for him in that City, having sent to his Brother the Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> who remain'd yet at <HI>Cologne,</HI> to come to him, and that his Family should all come from thence. So that by the time his Majesty had return'd again to <HI>Brussels,</HI> to congratulate <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s arrival, and spent three or four days there, he found himself as well settled at <HI>Bruges</HI> as he had been at <HI>Cologne;</HI> where, when his Family left it, there was not the least debt remain'd unsatisfied; which, in the low condition his Majesty had been in, and still was, gave reputation to his Oeconomy. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>As upon the dissolution of the unruly Parliament, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had sent out his two great Fleets, to propagate his fame abroad, presuming that by the Conquest which the one would make in the West <HI>Indies,</HI> he should have Money enough to keep his Army in obedience to him, and by the other's destroying or suppressing the Turks of <HI>Algiers,</HI> and <HI>Tu∣nis,</HI> which were indeed grown formidable to all Merchants, he should raise his reputation in <HI>Christendom,</HI> and become very popular with all the Merchants of <HI>England;</HI> so he did not, in the mean time, neglect to take all the ways he could devise, to provide for his own security at home. Though he had brought the King's Party so low, that he had <MILESTONE N="20"/> no apprehension of their power to raise an Army against him; yet he discerned, that by breaking their Fortunes and Estates, he had not at all broken their Spirits; and that by taking so many of their lives, their numbers were not much lessen'd; and that they would be still ready to throw themselves into any Party that should declare against him; to which, he knew, there were enough inclined.</P>
<P>BUT that which troubled him most, was the distemper in his Army; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>disturbed with the divisions in his own Ar∣my</HI></NOTE> where he knew there were many Troops more at the disposal of that Party that would destroy him, than at his own. It was once in his pur∣pose to have drawn over a Regiment of <HI>Swiss,</HI> upon pretence of send∣ing <MILESTONE N="30"/> them into <HI>Ireland,</HI> but in truth with intention to keep them as a Guard to his own Person; and to that purpose he had sent a Person to treat with Colonel <HI>Balthazer,</HI> a Man well known in the Protestant <HI>Can∣tons;</HI> but this came to be discover'd: so he had not confidence to pro∣ceed in it. He resolv'd therefore upon an Expedient, which should pro∣vide for all inconveniencies, as well amongst the People, as in the Ar∣my. He constituted, out of the Persons who he thought were most <NOTE PLACE="marg">Constitutes his Major Gene∣rals.</NOTE> devoted to himself, a Body of Major Generals; that is, he assign'd to such a single Person so many Counties, to be under his Command as their Major General: so that all <HI>England</HI> was put under the absolute <MILESTONE N="40"/> power of twelve Men, neither of them having any power in the juris∣diction of another, but every Man, in those Counties which were com∣mitted to his Charge, had all that authority which was before divided among Committee-Men, Justices of Peace, and several other Officers.</P>
<P>THE Major General committed to Prison what Persons he thought <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Power.</NOTE> sit to suspect; took care to levy all Monies which were appointed by the Protector and his Council to be collected for the Publick; seque∣ster'd all who did not pay their decimation, or such other payments as they were made liable to; and there was no Appeal from any of their Acts but to the Protector himself. They had likewise a Martial power, <MILESTONE N="50"/> which was to list a Body of Horse and Foot, who were to have such a Salary constantly paid, and not to be called upon to serve but upon emergent occasion, and then to attend so many days at their own Charge;
<PB N="459" REF="4710"/>
and if they stayed longer, they were to be under the same pay with the Army, but independent upon the Officers thereof, and only to obey their Major General. A Horse-man had eight pounds a year; for which he was to be ready with his Horse if he were called upon; if he were not, he might intend his own Affairs. By this means he had a second Army in view, powerful enough to controle the first, if they at any time deserv'd to be suspected. But he discern'd, by degrees, that these new Magistrates grew too much in love with their own power; and be∣sides that they carried themselves like so many <HI>Bassa</HI>'s with their Bands <MILESTONE N="10"/> of <HI>Janizaries,</HI> towards the People, and were extremely odious to all parties, they did really affect such an authority as might undermine his own greatness; yet, for the present, he thought not fit to controle them, and seem'd less to apprehend them.</P>
<P>WHEN Admiral <HI>Blake</HI> had subdued the <HI>Turks</HI> of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Algiers,</HI> and betaken himself to the Coast of <HI>Spain,</HI> and by the attempt of <HI>Hi∣spaniola</HI> and the Possession of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the War was sufficiently declar'd against the Catholick King, <HI>Mountague,</HI> a young Gentleman of a good <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountague <HI>sent to joyn with</HI> Blake, <HI>and put in Commission with him.</HI></NOTE> Family, who had been drawn into the Party of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and serv'd under him as a Colonel in his Army with much Courage, was sent with <MILESTONE N="20"/> an Addition of Ships to joyn with <HI>Blake,</HI> and joyn'd in Commission of Admiral and General with him; <HI>Blake</HI> having found himself much in∣disposed in his health, and having desired that another might be sent to assist him, and to take care of the Fleet, if worse should befal him. Upon his Arrival with the Fleet, they lay long before <HI>Cales</HI> in expecta∣tion of the <HI>Spanish</HI> West <HI>India</HI> Fleet, and to keep in all Ships from go∣ing out to give notice of their being there. After some Months Atten∣dance, they were at last compell'd to remove their Station, that they might get fresh Water, and some other Provisions which they wanted; and so drew off to a convenient Bay in <HI>Portugal,</HI> and left a Squadron <MILESTONE N="30"/> of Ships to watch the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet; which, within a very short time <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An</HI> English <HI>Squadron lights upon the</HI> Spanish <HI>West-</HI>India <HI>Fleet; takes the Rere Ad∣miral and an∣other Ship off of</HI> Cades</NOTE> after the remove of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, came upon the Coast; and be∣fore they were discover'd by the Commander of the Squadron, who was to the Leeward, made their way so fast, that when he got up with them (though he was inferior to them in Number) they rather thought of saving their Wealth by flight, than of defending themselves; and so the <HI>Spanish</HI> Admiral run on shore in the Bay; and the Vice-Admiral, in which was the Vice-King of <HI>Mexico</HI> with his Wife, and Sons, and Daughters, fired; in which the poor Gentleman himself, his Wife, and his eldest Daughter, perish'd: his other Daughters, and his two Sons, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and near one hundred others, were saved by the <HI>English;</HI> who took the Rere-Admiral, and another Ship, very richly laden; which, together with the Prisoners, were sent into <HI>England,</HI> the rest escaped into <HI>Gi∣braltar.</HI></P>
<P>THE Ships which were sent for <HI>England,</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> and though they might with less charge have continued their Voyage by Sea to <HI>London, Cromwell</HI> thought it would make more noise, if all the Bul∣lion, which was of great value, was landed at <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> from whence <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Bull<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> taken conver'd from</HI> Portsmouth <HI>to</HI> London</NOTE> it was brought by Land in many Carts to <HI>London,</HI> and carried through the City to the Tower to be there coin'd, as it was, within as short a <MILESTONE N="50"/> time as it could be dispatch'd; and though it was in it self very consi∣derable, they gave out and reported it to be of much greater value than it was. But the loss to the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was prodigious; though most of what was in the Admiral was saved, and that only: and they
<PB N="460" REF="4720"/>
saw the <HI>English</HI> Fleet still remaining before them, which was not like to miss the other Fleet they shortly after expected, in spight of all Ad∣vertisements which they were like to be able to send to it.</P>
<P>CROMWELL now thought his reputation, both abroad and at home, so good, that he might venture again upon calling of a Parliament; and, by their countenance and concurrence, suppress, or compose those refractory Spirits, which crossed him in all places; and having first made such Sheriffs in all Counties as he thought would be like to con∣tribute to his designs, by hindering such Men to stand against whom he had a prejudice, at least, by not returning them if they should be chosen, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and by procuring such Persons to be returned as would be most agree∣able to him, of which there were choice in all Counties; and having prepared all things to this purpose, as well as he could, he sent out his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gromwell <HI>summons a Parliament to meet,</HI> Sept. 17. 1656.</NOTE> Writs to call a Parliament to meet at <HI>Westminster:</HI> upon the seven∣teenth of <HI>September,</HI> in the year 1656. When, upon the Returns, he found, that though in some places he had succeeded according to his wish, it was in others quite the contrary, and that very many Mem∣bers were return'd, who were Men of the most notorious malignity against him, he therefore resorted to his old security, to keep all man∣ner <NOTE PLACE="marg">Imposes a Sub∣scription upon the Members before they sate.</NOTE> of Persons from entering into the House, <Q>who did not first subscribe, <MILESTONE N="20"/> “that they would act nothing prejudicial to the Government as it was” establish'd under a Protector;</Q> which being tender'd, many Members utterly refused, and return'd into their Countries, where they were not, for the most part, the worse welcome for insisting upon their Privileges, and freedom of Parliament.</P>
<P>THE Major part frankly submitted and subscribed; some of them, that they might have the better opportunity to do mischief. So a Speaker was chosen; and at first they proceeded so unanimously, that the Pro∣tector begun to hope that he had gain'd his point. With very little, or no contradiction, they passed an Act of Renunciation of any title <MILESTONE N="30"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Proceed∣ings of this Parliament.</NOTE> that <HI>Charles Stuart</HI> (for so they had long called the King) or any of that Family might pretend; and this all Men were bound to subscribe. With as little opposition, they passed another, whereby it was made High Treason to attempt any thing against the life of the Protector. Then they passed several Acts for raising Money by way of contribution in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> in a greater proportion than had ever yet been raised. They granted Tonnage and Poundage to the Pro∣tector for his life; and passed several other Acts for the raising of Mo∣nies; amongst them, one for obliging all Persons to pay a full year's Rent for all buildings which had been erected in, and about <HI>London,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> from before the beginning of the Troubles; by all which ways, vast Sums of Money were to be, and afterwards were, raised. All these Acts they presented solemnly to his Highness, to be confirm'd by his Royal Authority; <Q>and He as graciously confirm'd them all; and told them, “that as it had been the custom of the chief Governours to acknowledge the care and kindness of the Commons upon such Occasions, so He” did very heartily and thankfully acknowledge Theirs.</Q></P>
<P>BUT after all this, he was far from being satisfied with the method of their proceeding; for there was nothing done to confirm his Personal Authority; and notwithstanding all this was done, they might, for <MILESTONE N="50"/> ought appear'd, remove him from being both Protector, and General. There had been for some time jealousies between Him and <HI>Lambert,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell▪ <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of</HI> Lambert</NOTE> who had been the principal adviser of the raising those Major Ge∣nerals;
<PB N="461" REF="4730"/>
and being one of them himself, and having the Government of the five Northern Counties committed to him, he desired to improve their Authority, and to have it settled by Authority of Parliament. But <HI>Cromwell,</HI> on the other hand, was well contented that they should be look'd upon as a publick grievance, and so taken away, rather upon the desire of Parliament, than that it should appear to be out of his own inclination. But, hitherto, neither that design in <HI>Lambert,</HI> nor the other in <HI>Cromwell,</HI> nor any difference between them, had broken out.</P>
<P>THE Protector himself seem'd to desire nothing more, than to have <MILESTONE N="10"/> the Authority they had formerly given him, at least, that he had exer∣cised from the time he was Protector, confirm'd, and ratified by Act of Parliament. And if it had been so, it had been much greater than any King ever enjoyed. <Q>But he had used to speak much, “that it was pity the Nobility should be totally suppressed; and that the Government would be better, if it passed another consultation besides that of the House of Commons. In matter of Religion, he would often speak, that there was much of good in the order of Bishops, if the dross were” scour'd off.</Q> He courted very much many of the Nobility, and used all devices to dispose them to come to him; and they who did visit him <MILESTONE N="20"/> were used with extraordinary respect by him; all which, raised an opi∣nion in many, that he did in truth himself affect to be King; which was the more confirm'd, when many of those who had nearest Relation to him, and were most trusted by him, assoon as the Parliament had dis∣patch'd those Acts, which are mention'd before, and that complaints came from all parts against the Major Generals, inveigh'd sharply against the temper and composition of the Government, as if it was not ca∣pable to settle the several distractions, and satisfy the several Interests of the Nation; <Q>and by degrees proposed, in direct terms, “that they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Proposition in the Parlia∣ment for</HI> Cromwell <HI>to be King.</HI></NOTE> might invest <HI>Cromwell</HI> with the Title, Rights, and Dignity of a King; <MILESTONE N="30"/> and then he would know, what he was to do towards the satisfaction” of all Parties, and how to govern those who would not be satisfied.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Proposition found a great concurrence; and very many who used not to agree in any thing else, were of one mind in This, and would presently vote him King. And it was observ'd that no body was for∣warder in that Acclamation, than some Men who had allways had the reputation of great fidelity to the King, and to wish his Restoration: and it cannot be denied that very many of the King's Party were so de∣ceiv'd in their judgements, as really to believe, that the making <HI>Crom∣well</HI> King for the present, was the best Expedient for the Restoration <MILESTONE N="40"/> of his Majesty; and that the Army, and the whole Nation, would then have been united rather to restore the true, than to admit of a false So∣veraign, whose Hypocrisy and Tyranny being now detected, and known, would be the more detested.</P>
<P>BUT the more sober Persons of the King's Party, who made less noise, trembled at this Overture; and believ'd that it was the only way, utterly to destroy the King, and to pull up all future hopes of the Royal Family by the Roots. They saw all Men even already tired in their hopes; and that which was left of Spirit in them, was from the horror they had of the confusion of the present Government; that very <MILESTONE N="50"/> many, who had sustain'd the King's Quarrel in the beginning, were dead; that the present King, by his long absence out of the Kingdom, was known to very few; so that there was too much reason to fear, that much of that Affection that appear'd under the notion of Allegiance
<PB N="462" REF="4740"/>
to the King, was more directed to the Monarchy than to the Person; and that if <HI>Cromwell</HI> were once made King, and so the Government run again in the old Channel, though those who were in love with a Re∣publick would possibly fall from him, he would receive abundant re∣paration of strength by the Access of those who preferr'd the Monar∣chy, and which probably would reconcile most Men of Estates to an ab∣solute acquiescence, if not to an entire submission; that the Nobility, which being excluded to a Man, and depriv'd of all the Rights and Pri∣vileges due to them by their Birth-right, and so Enemies irreconcilable to the present Government, would, by this alteration, find themselves <MILESTONE N="10"/> in their right places, and be glad to adhere to the Name of a King, how unlawful a one soever; and there was an Act of Parliament still in force, that was made in the eleventh year of King <HI>Harry</HI> the seventh, which seem'd to provide absolute Indemnity to such submission. And there was, without doubt, at that time, too much propension in too many of the Nobility, to ransome themselves at the charge of their Lawful Soveraign. And therefore they who made these prudent recollections, used all the ways they could to prevent this design, and to divert any such Vote in the House.</P>
<P>ON the other side, <HI>Lambert,</HI> who was the second Man of power in <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>and his Party op∣pose this Over∣ture:</HI></NOTE> the Army, and many other Officers of account and interest, besides the Country Members, opposed this Overture with great bitterness, and indignation: <Q>some of them said directly, “that if, contrary to their Oaths and Engagements, and contrary to the end, for obtaining where∣of they had spent so much blood and treasure, they must at last re∣turn and submit to the old Government, and live again under a King, they would choose much rather to obey the true and lawful Heir to the Crown, who was descended from a long succession of Kings who had managed the Scepter over the Nation, than to submit to a Person who at best was but their equal, and raised by themselves from the <MILESTONE N="30"/> same degree of which they all were, and by the trust they had reposed” in him, had raised himself above them.</Q> That which put an end to the present Debate was (and which was as wonderful as any thing) that some of his own Family, who had grown up under him, and had their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And some of</HI> Cromwell<HI>'s own Relations.</HI></NOTE> whole dependence upon him, as <HI>Desborough, Fleetwood, Whaley,</HI> and others, as passionately contradicted the motion, as any of the other Of∣ficers; <Q>and confidently undertook to know, “that himself would never consent to it; and therefore that it was very strange that any Men should importune the putting such a Question, before they knew that” he would accept it,</Q> unless they took this way to destroy him. Upon <MILESTONE N="40"/> this (for which the Undertakers receiv'd no thanks) the first Debate was put off, till farther consideration.</P>
<P>THE Debate was resumed again the next day, with the same warmth, the same Persons still of the same opinion they had been before: most of the Officers of the Army, as well as they who were the great Depen∣dents upon, and Creatures of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> as passionately opposed the making him King, as <HI>Lambert</HI> and the rest did, who look'd to be suc∣cessive Protectors after his decease; only it was observ'd, that they who the day before had undertaken, that he himself would never endure it (which had especially made the pause at that time) urged that Argument <MILESTONE N="50"/> no more; but inveigh'd still against it as a Monstrous thing, and that which would infallibly ruin him. But most of those of his Privy Coun∣cil, and others nearest his trust, were as violent and as positive for the
<PB N="463" REF="4750"/>
declaring him King, and much the Major part of the House concurr'd in the same opinion; and notwithstanding all was said to the contrary, they appointed a Committee of several of the most eminent Members <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Committee appointed to confer with</HI> Cromwell <HI>about it.</HI></NOTE> of the House to wait upon him, <Q>and to inform him of “the very ear∣nest desire of the House, that he would take upon him the Title of King; and if they should find any aversion in him, that they should then enlarge in giving him those reasons, which had been offer'd in the House, and which had swayed the House to that resolution, which” they hoped would have the same Influence upon his Highness.</Q></P>
<P>HE gave them Audience in the painted Chamber, when they made <NOTE PLACE="marg">He gives them Audience, and they offer him their rea∣sons.</NOTE> the bare Overture to him, as the desire of his Parliament; at which he <MILESTONE N="10"/> seem'd surprised; <Q>and told them, “he wonder'd how any such thing came into their minds; that it was neither fit for Them to offer, nor Him to receive; that he was sure they could discover no such Am∣bition in him, and that his Conscience would not give him leave ever” to consent to own that Title.</Q> <Q>They, who were well prepared to ex∣pect such an Answer, told him, “that they hoped, he would not so sud∣dainly give a positive denial to what the Parliament had desired upon so long, and mature deliberation; that They, who knew his modesty <MILESTONE N="20"/> well, and that he more affected to deserve the highest Titles than to wear them, were appointed to offer many reasons, which had induced the House to make this request to him; which when he had vouch∣safed to hear, they hoped the same impression would be made upon” Him, that had been made upon Them in the House.</Q> He was too de∣sirous to give the Parliament all the Satisfaction he could with a good Conscience, to refuse to hear whatever they thought fit to say to him; and so appointed them another day to attend him in the same place; which they accordingly did.</P>
<P><Q>WHEN they came to him again, they all successively entertain'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> him with long Harangues, setting out “the nature of the <HI>English</HI> People, and the nature of the Government to which they had been accustom'd, and under which they had flourished from the time they had been a People: that though the extreme sufferings they had undergone by corrupt Ministers, under negligent, and tyrannical Kings, had trans∣ported them to throw off the Government it self, as well as to inflict Justice upon the Persons of the Offenders; yet they found by expe∣rience, that no other Government would so well fit the Nation, as that to which it had been accustom'd: that, notwithstanding the infi∣nite pains his Highness had taken, and which had been crowned, even <MILESTONE N="40"/> with miraculous success, by the immediate blessing of Divine Provi∣dence upon all his Actions and all his Counsels, there remained still a rest∣less and unquiet Spirit in Men, that threaten'd the publick Peace; and that it was most apparent, by the dayly Combinations and Conspiracies against the present Government, how just and gentle and mild soever, that the heart of the Nation was devoted to the old form, with which it was acquainted; and that it was the love of that, not the Affection to the young Man who pretended a title to it, and was known to no body, which disposed so many to wish for the return of it: that the Name and Title of a Protector was never known to this Kingdom, but <MILESTONE N="50"/> in the hands of a Subject, during the Reign of an infant Soveraign; and therefore, that the Laws gave little respect to him, but were all∣ways executed in the Name of the King, how young soever, and how unfit soever to govern: that whatsoever concern'd the Rights of any
<PB N="464" REF="4760"/>
family, or any personal pretence, was well and safely over; the Na∣tion was united, and of one mind in the rejection of the old Line; there was no danger of it; but no body could say, that they were of one mind in the rejection of the old form of Government; to which they were still most addicted: therefore, they besought him, out of his love and tenderness to the Common-wealth, and for the preserva∣tion of the Nation, which had got so much renown and glory under his Conduct, that he would take that Name and Title which had ever presided over it, and by which as he could establish a firm Peace at home, so he would find his fame and honour more improved abroad; and that those very Princes and Kings, who, out of admiration of his Virtue and noble Actions, had contracted a reverence for his Person, and an impatient desire of his friendship, would look upon him with much more veneration, when they saw him cloathed with the same Majesty, and as much their equal in Title as in merit; and would with much more alacrity renew the old Alliances with <HI>England,</HI> when they were renewed in the old form, and under the old title, which would make them durable; since no foreign Prince could presume to take upon him to judge of right of Succession; which had been fre∣quently changed in all Kingdoms, not only upon the expiration of a <MILESTONE N="20"/> Line, but upon deprivation and deposition; in such manner as was most for the good and benefit of the People; of which there was a fresh Instance in their own Eyes, in the Kingdom of <HI>Portugal;</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> by the Election of the People, assumed the Crown, and Title of King, from the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> who had enjoy'd it quietly, and without Interruption, during three Descents; and he was acknow∣ledged as Soveraign of that Kingdom by the late King; who receiv'd” his Embassadors accordingly.</Q></P>
<P>CROMWELL heard these and the like Arguments with great atten∣tion (and wanted not inclination to have concurr'd with them; <Q>he <MILESTONE N="30"/> thanked them “for the pains they had taken) to which he would not take upon him to give a present Answer; that he would consider of all they had said to him, and resort to God for counsel; and then he” would send for them,</Q> and acquaint them with his Resolution; and so they parted, all Men standing at gaze, and in terrible suspense, ac∣cording to their several hopes and fears, till they knew what he would determine. All the dispute was now within his own Chamber. There is no question the Man was in great agony, and in his own mind did heartily desire to be King, and thought it the only way to be safe. And it is confidently believed, that upon some Addresses he had formerly <MILESTONE N="40"/> made to some principal Noble Men of the Kingdom, and some friendly Expostulations he had by himself, or some Friend, with them, why they reserv'd themselves, and would have no communication or ac¦quaintance with him, <Q>the Answer from them all severally (for such dis¦courses could be held but with one at a time) was “that if he would make himself King, they should easily know what they had to do, but they knew nothing of the submission and obedience which they were” to pay to a Protector;</Q> and that these returns first disposed him to that Ambition.</P>
<P>HE was not terrified with the opposition that <HI>Lambert</HI> gave him: <MILESTONE N="50"/> whom he now looked upon as a declared and mortal Enemy, and one whom he must destroy, that he might not be destroy'd by him: nor <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d he much consider those other Officers of the Army, who in the Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="465" REF="4770"/>
concurr'd with <HI>Lambert;</HI> whose Interest he did not believe to be great; and if it were, he thought he should quickly reduce them, assoon as <HI>Lambert</HI> should be disgraced, and his power taken from him. But he trembled at the obstinacy of those who, he knew, loved him; his Bro∣ther <HI>Desborough,</HI> and the rest, who depended wholely upon him, and his Greatness, and who did not wish his Power and Authority less ab∣solute than it was. And that these Men should, with that virulence, withstand this promotion, griev'd him to the heart. He conferr'd with them severally, and endeavour'd, by all the ways he could, to convert <MILESTONE N="10"/> them. <Q>But they were all inexorable; and told him resolutely, “that they could do him no good, if they should adhere to him; and there∣fore, they were resolv'd for their own Interest to leave him, and do the utmost they could against him, from the time he assumed that” Title.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT was reported that an Officer of Name, in the eclaircissement upon the Subject, told him resolutely and vehemently, “that if ever he took” the Title of King upon him, he would kill him.</Q> <Q>Certain it is that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was inform'd, and gave credit to it, “that there were a num∣ber of Men, who bound themselves by Oath to kill him, within so” <MILESTONE N="20"/> many hours after he should accept that Title.</Q> They who were very near him, said, that in this perplexity he revolv'd his former dream, or apparition, that had first inform'd, and promised him the high fortune to which he was allready arriv'd, and which was generally spoken of even from the beginning of the Troubles, and when he was not in a posture that promised such exaltation; <Q>and that he then observ'd, it had only declared, “that he should be the greatest Man in <HI>England,”</HI> and should be near to be King;</Q> which seem'd to imply that he should be only near, and never actually attain the Crown. Upon the whole matter, after a great distraction of mind, which was manifest in his <MILESTONE N="30"/> Countenance to all who then saw him, notwithstanding his Science in dissimulation, his courage sail'd him; and after he had spent some days very uneasily, he sent for the Committee of Parliament to attend him; and, as his looks were extremely discomposed, and discover'd a mind full of trouble, and irresolution, so his words were broken and disjoynted, without method, and full of pauses; <Q>with frequent mention of God and his gracious dispensation, he concluded, “that he could not, with a” <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Title of King</NOTE> good Conscience, accept the Government under the Title of a King.</Q></P>
<P>MANY were then of opinion, that his Genius at that time forsook him, and yielded to the King's spirit, and that his Reign was near its <MILESTONE N="40"/> expiration; and that if his own Courage had not failed, he would easily have master'd all opposition; that there were many Officers of the Ar∣my, who would not have left him, who were for Kingly Government in their own affections; and that the greatest factions in Religion rather promised themselves Protection from a single Person, than from a Par∣liament, or a new numerous Council: that the first Motion for the making him King, was made by one of the most wealthy Alderment of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and who serv'd then for the City in Parliament; which was an Argument that that potent Body stood well affected to that Government, and would have joyn'd with him in the defence of it. <MILESTONE N="50"/> Others were as confident, that he did very wisely to decline it; and that, if he had accepted it, he could not have lived many days after. The truth is, the danger was only in some present Assassination, and desperate Attempt upon his Person, not from a Revolt of the Army
<PB N="466" REF="4780"/>
from him; which no particular Man had Interest enough to corrupt. And he might have secured himself, probably, for some time, from such an Assault; and when such designs are deferr'd, they are commonly discover'd; as appear'd afterwards, in many Conspiracies against his Life.</P>
<P>HIS interest and power over the Army was so great, that he had upon the suddain remov'd many of those Officers who had the greatest Names in the factions of Religion, as <HI>Harrison, Rich,</HI> and others; who, assoon as they were remov'd, and their Regiments conferr'd on others, were found to be of no signification, or influence. And it could have been no hard matter for him, upon very few days warning, to have so quarter'd, and modell'd his Troops, as to have secured him in any en∣terprise he would undertake. And, it may be, there were more Men scandalized at his usurping more than the Royal Authority, than would have been at his Assumption of the Royal Title too. And therefore they who at that time exercised their thoughts with most sagacity, looked upon that refusal of his as an immediate Act of Almighty God towards the King's Restoration; and many of the soberest Men in the Nation confessed, after the King's Return, that their dejected Spirits were won∣derfully raised, and their hopes revived, by that infatuation of his.</P>
<P>BUT his modesty, or his wisdom, or his fear in the refusing that su∣preme <MILESTONE N="$0"/> Title, seem'd not to be attended with the least disadvantage to him. They who had most signally opposed it, were so satisfied that the danger they most apprehended was over, that they cared not to cross any thing else that was proposed towards his greatness; which might be their own another day: and they who had carried on the other design, and thereby, as they thought, obliged him, resolved now to give him all the Power which they knew he did desire, and leave it to his own time, when with less hesitation he might assume the Title too. And so they voted, that he should enjoy the Title and Authority he had already; <MILESTONE N="30"/> which they enlarged in many particulars, beyond what it was by the first Instrument of Government, by another Instrument, which they call'd the humble <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Advice;</HI> in which they granted him not only that Authority for his life, but power by his last Will and Testa∣ment, and in the presence of such a number of Witnesses, to make choice of, and to declare his own Successor; which power should never be granted to any other Protector than himself. And when they had di∣gested and agreed upon this Writing, at the passing whereof <HI>Lambert</HI> chose rather to be absent than oppose it, his Parliament sent to him for an Audience; which he assign'd them on the 25<SUP>th</SUP> day of <HI>May</HI> 1657. in <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is con∣firm'd Pro∣tector by the humble Peti∣tion and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> the Banqueting House; where their Speaker <HI>Withrington</HI> presented, and read the <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> of his Parliament, and desired his Assent to it.</P>
<P><Q>THE contents and substance of it were, “that his Highness <HI>Oliver</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Contents of it</NOTE> <HI>Cromwell</HI> should, under the Title of Protector, be pleased to execute the Office of Chief Magistrate over <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Territories and Dominions thereunto belonging <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to govern according to all things in that <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Advice:</HI> and also, that he would in his life time appoint the Person that should succeed him in the Government: that he would call a Parliament, consisting <MILESTONE N="50"/> of two Houses, once in a year at farthest: that those Persons who are legally chosen by a free Election of the People to serve in Parliament, may not be excluded from doing their duties, but by consent of that
<PB N="467" REF="4790"/>
House whereof they are Members: that none but those under the Qua∣lifications therein mention'd, should be capable to serve as Members in Parliament: that the power of the other House be limited, as therein is prescribed: that the Laws and Statutes of the Land be ob∣served and kept; no Laws alter'd, suspended, abrogated, or repealed, but by new Laws made by Act of Parliament: that the yearly Sum of a Million of pounds sterling be settled for the maintainance of the Navy, and Army; and three hundred thousand pounds for the sup∣port of the Government; besides other temporary Supplies, as the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Commons in Parliament shall see the necessities of the Nation to re∣quire: that the Number of the Protector's Council shall not exceed one and twenty; whereof seven shall be a <HI>Quorum:</HI> the Chief Offi∣cers of State, as Chancellors, Keepers of the Great Seal <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be approved by Parliament: that his Highness would encourage a Godly Ministry in these Nations; and that such as do revile and disturb them in the worship of God, may be punish'd according to Law; and where Laws are defective, new ones to be made: that the Protestant Chri∣stian Religion, as it is contain'd in the old and new Testament, be as∣serted, and held forth for the publick Profession of these Nations, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> no other; and that a Confession of Faith be agreed upon, and recom∣mended to the People of these Nations; and none to be permitted, by words or writing, to revile, or reproach the said Confession of” Faith.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHEN this <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> was distinctly read to him, after a long pause, and casting up his Eyes, and other Gestures of perplexity, he sign'd it; and told them, “that he came not thither that day as to <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Speed upon passing it.</NOTE> a day of Triumph, but with the most serious thoughts that ever he had in all his Life, being to undertake one of the greatest Burthens that ever was laid upon the back of any humane Creature; so that, <MILESTONE N="30"/> without the support of the Allmighty, he must necessarily sink under the weight of it, to the damage and prejudice of the Nation committed to his Charge: therefore he desired the help of the Parliament, and the help of all those who fear'd God, that by Their help he might re∣ceive help and assistance from the hand of God, since nothing but His presence could enable him to discharge so great a Trust. He told them, that this was but an introduction to the carrying on of the Govern∣ment of the three Nations; and therefore he recommended the sup∣ply of the rest, that was yet wanting, to the Wisdom of the Parlia∣ment;” and said,</Q> <Q>“he could not doubt, but the same spirit that had led <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Parliament to This, would easily suggest the rest to them; and that nothing should have induced him to have undertaken this in∣tolerable burthen to flesh and blood, but that he saw, it was the Par∣liament's” care to answer those ends for which they were engaged;</Q> <Q>calling God to Witness, “that he would not have undergone it, but that the Parliament had determin'd that it made clearly for the liberty and interest of the Nation, and preservation of such as fear God; and if the Nation were not thankful to them for their care, it would fall as” a sin on their heads.</Q> <Q>He concluded with recommending some things to them, “which, he said, would tend to Reformation, by discounte∣nancing” <MILESTONE N="50"/> Vice and encouraging Virtue;</Q> and so dismissed them to re∣turn to their House.</P>
<P>BUT now that they had perform'd all he could expect from them, he resolv'd that he would do somewhat for himself; and that all the dis∣courses
<PB N="468" REF="4800"/>
which had passed of King-ship, should not pass away in the si∣lence of this Address, but that this Exaltation should be attended with such a noise and solemnity, as should make it very little inferior to the other. <Q>Therefore, within few days after, he sent a Message to the Par∣liament, “that they would adjourn until such a time as the solemnity” of his Inauguration should be perform'd;</Q> for the formality whereof they had not provided, nor indeed consider'd it; as if enough had been done already. For this he appointed the six and twentieth of <HI>June;</HI> and in the mean time assign'd the care to several Persons, that all things should be made ready for the magnificence of such a Work. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>ON the day appointed, <HI>Westminster-</HI>Hall was prepared, and adorn'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Solemnity of his Inaugu∣ration.</NOTE> as sumptuously as it could be for a day of Coronation. A Throne was erected with a Pavilion, and a chair of State under it, to which <HI>Crom∣well</HI> was conducted in an entry, and attendance of his Officers, Mili∣tary and Civil, with as much State (and the Sword carried before him) as can be imagin'd. When he was sate in his Chair of State, and after a short Speech, which was but the Prologue of that by the Speaker of the Parliament <HI>Withrington,</HI> that this promotion might not seem to be without the Nobility's having any share in it, the Speaker, with the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and <HI>Whitlock,</HI> vested him with a rich purple Velvet <MILESTONE N="20"/> Robe lined with Ermines; the Speaker enlarging upon the Majesty and the Integrity of that Robe. Then the Speaker presented him with a fair Bible of the largest edition, richly bound; then he, in the name of all the People, girded a Sword about him; and lastly presented him a Scepter of Gold, which he put into his hand, and made him a large dis∣course of those Emblems of Government and Authority. Upon the close of which, there being little wanting to a perfect formal Corona∣tion, but a Crown and an Arch-Bishop, he took his Oath, administer'd to him by the Speaker, in these words (which amongst other things had been settled by an explanatory Petition and Advice) <Q>“I do, in the pre∣sence, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and by the Name of Almighty God, promise and swear, that, to the utmost of my power, I will uphold, and maintain the true Re∣form'd Protestant Christian Religion in the purity thereof, as it is con∣tain'd in the Holy Scriptures of the old and new Testament; and to the utmost of my power, and understanding, encourage the profession and professors of the same; and that, to the utmost of my power, I will endeavour, as Chief Magistrate of these three Nations, the main∣tainance and preserving of the Peace and Safety, and just Rights and Privileges of the People thereof; and shall in all things, according to the best of my knowledge and power, govern the People of these three” <MILESTONE N="40"/> Nations according to Law.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER this there remain'd nothing but Festivals, and Proclama∣tions of his power and authority to be made in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and with all imaginable hast throughout the three Kingdoms of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> which was done accordingly. And that he might entirely enjoy the Soveraignty they had conferr'd upon him, without any new blasts, and disputes, and might be vacant to the dispatch of his Domestic Affairs, which he had modell'd, and might have time to consider how to fill his other House with Members fit for his purpose, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He adjourns his Parlia∣ment to</HI> Ja∣nuary <HI>the</HI> 20. <HI>His Actions in the vacancy of Parliament.</HI></NOTE> he adjourn'd his Parliament till <HI>January</HI> next, as having done as much <MILESTONE N="50"/> as was necessary for one Session. In this vacancy, his greatness seem'd to be so much establish'd both at home and abroad, as if it could never be shaken. He caused all the Officers of his Army, and all Commanders
<PB N="469" REF="4810"/>
at Sea to subscribe, and approve all that the Parliament had done, and to promise to observe and defend it.</P>
<P>HE sent now for his eldest Son <HI>Richard;</HI> who, till this time, had liv'd privately in the Country upon the fortune his Wife had brought him, in an ordinary Village in <HI>Hamshire;</HI> and brought him now to the Court, and made him a Privy Counsellor, and caused him to be chosen Chancellor of the University of <HI>Oxford.</HI> Notwithstanding all which, few People then believ'd that he intended to name him for his Suc∣cessor; <Q>he by his discourses often implying, “that he would name such” <MILESTONE N="10"/> a Successor, as was in all respects equal to the Office:</Q> and so Men guessed this, or that Man, as they thought most like to be so esteem'd by him. His second Son <HI>Harry,</HI> who had the reputation of more Vi∣gour, he had sent into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and made him his Lieutenant of that Kingdom, that he might be sure to have no disturbance from thence.</P>
<P>HE had only two Daughters unmarried: One of those he gave to <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Daughters disposed of in Marriage.</NOTE> the Grand-son and Heir of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> a Man of a great Estate, and throughly engaged in the Cause from the beginning; the Other was married to the Lord Viscount <HI>Falconbridge,</HI> the owner likewise of a very fair Estate in <HI>York-shire,</HI> and descended of a Family eminently <MILESTONE N="20"/> Loyal. There were many reasons to believe that this young Gentleman, being then of about three or four and twenty years of Age, of great vi∣gour and ambition, had many good purposes, which he thought that Alliance might qualify and enable him to perform. These Marriages were celebrated at <HI>White-Hall</HI> with all imaginable pomp and lustre; and it was observ'd, that though the Marriages were perform'd in pub∣lick View according to the Rites and Ceremonies then in use, they were presently afterwards in private married by Ministers ordain'd by Bishops, and according to the form in the Book of Common Prayer; and this with the privity of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who pretended to yield to it in com∣pliance <MILESTONE N="30"/> with the importunity, and folly of his Daughters.</P>
<P>THESE domestic Triumphs were confirm'd, and improv'd by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Success of his Armes a∣broad.</NOTE> Success of his Armes abroad. Though the <HI>French</HI> had no mind to ap∣ply those Forces upon <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> which they were obliged, when taken, to put into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s hands, and so march to other places, which they were to conquer to their own use; in which the six thousand <HI>English</HI> under the Command of <HI>Raynolds</HI> attended them, and behaved them∣selves eminently well, and in good discipline; <Q>yet his Embassadour <HI>Lockhart</HI> made such lively Instances with the Cardinal, with complaints of their breach of Faith, and some Menaces, “that his Master knew” <MILESTONE N="40"/> where to find a more punctual Friend;</Q> that assoon as they had taken <HI>Montmedy,</HI> and S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Venant,</HI> the Army march'd into <HI>Flanders;</HI> and though the Season of the year was too far spent to engage in a Siege before <HI>Dun∣kirk,</HI> they sate down before <HI>Mardike;</HI> which was look'd upon as the most difficult part of the Work; which being reduced, would facilitate the other very much: <Q>and that Fort they took, and deliver'd it into the hands of <HI>Raynolds,</HI> with an obligation “that they would besiege <HI>Dun∣kirk”</HI> the next year, and make it their first Attempt.</Q></P>
<P>BUT that which made a noise indeed, and crown'd his Successes, was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Victory of his Fleet over the</HI> Spaniard.</NOTE> the Victory his Fleet, under the Command of <HI>Blake,</HI> had obtain'd over <MILESTONE N="50"/> the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> which, in truth, with all its Circumstances, was very wonderful, and will never be forgotten in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Canaries.</HI> That Fleet had rode out all the Winter Storms before <HI>Cales</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Portugal,</HI> after they had sent home those former Ships which
<PB N="470" REF="4820"/>
they had taken of the West <HI>Indian</HI> Fleet, and understood by the Pri∣soners, that the other Fleet from <HI>Peru,</HI> which is allways much richer than that of <HI>Mexico,</HI> was undoubtedly at Sea, and would be on the Coast by the beginning of the Spring, if they receiv'd not Advertisement of the presence of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet; in which case they were most like to stay at the <HI>Canaries.</HI> The Admiral concluded, that, notwithstanding all they had done, or could do to block up <HI>Cales,</HI> one way or other they would not be without that Advertisement; and therefore resolv'd to sail with the whole Fleet to the length of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> that, if it were possible, they might meet with the Galeons before they came thi∣ther; <MILESTONE N="10"/> and if they should be first got in thither, they would then con∣sider what was to be done.</P>
<P>WITH this resolution the Fleet stood for the Canaries, and about the middle of <HI>April</HI> came thither; and found that the Galeons were got thither before them, and had placed themselves, as they thought, in safety. The smaller Ships, being ten in number, lay in a Semicircle, moor'd along the Shore; and the six great Galeons (the Fleet consisting of sixteen good Ships) which could not come so near the Shore, lay with their broad-sides towards the Offin. Besides this good posture in which all the Ships lay, they were cover'd with a strong Castle well <MILESTONE N="20"/> furnish'd with Guns; and there were six or seven small Forts, raised in the most advantageous places of the Bay, every one of them furnish'd with divers good pieces of Cannon; so that they were without the least Apprehension of their want of security, or imagination that any Men would be so desperate, as to assault them upon such apparent disad∣vantage.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>English</HI> Fleet came to the mouth of the Bay of <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> and the General saw in what posture the <HI>Spaniard</HI> lay, he thought it impossible to bring off any of the Galeons; however, he resolv'd to burn them (which was by many thought to be equally impossible) and <MILESTONE N="30"/> sent Captain <HI>Stayner</HI> with a Squadron of the best Ships to fall upon the Galeons; which he did very resolutely; whilst other Frigats enter∣tain'd the Forts, and lesser Breast-works, with continual Broad-sides to hinder their firing. Then the General coming up with the whole Fleet, after full four hours fight, they drove the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from their Ships, and possessed them; yet found that their work was not done; and that it was not only impossible to carry away the Ships, which they had taken, but that the Wind that had brought them into the Bay, and enabled them to conquer the Enemy, would not serve to carry them out again; so that they lay exposed to all the Cannon from the Shore; <MILESTONE N="40"/> which thunder'd upon them. However, they resolved to do what was in their power; and so, discharging their broad-sides upon the Forts and Land, where they did great execution, they set fire to every Ship, Ga∣leons, and others, and burn'd every one of them; which they had no sooner done, but it happen'd the Wind turn'd, and carried the whole Fleet without loss of one Ship out of the Bay, and put them safe to Sea again.</P>
<P>THE whole Action was so miraculous, that all Men who knew the place, wonder'd that any sober Men, with what courage soever endued, would ever have undertaken it; and they could hardly perswade Them∣selves <MILESTONE N="50"/> to believe what they had done; whilst the <HI>Spaniards</HI> comforted themselves with the belief, that they were Devils and not Men who had destroyed them in such a manner. So much a strong resolution of
<PB N="471" REF="4830"/>
bold and courageous Men can bring to pass, that no resistance and ad∣vantage of ground can disappoint them. And it can hardly be imagin'd, how small loss the <HI>English</HI> sustain'd in this unparallel'd Action; no one Ship being left behind, and the killed and wounded not exceeding two hundred Men, when the Slaughter on board the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships, and on the Shore, was incredible.</P>
<P>THE Fleet after this, having been long abroad, found it necessary to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Blake <HI>returns with the Fleet; dies in the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> return home. And this was the last service performed by <HI>Blake;</HI> who sicken'd in his Return, and in the very entrance of the Fleet into the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Sound of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> expired. He wanted no Pomp of funeral when he was dead, <HI>Cromwell</HI> causing him to be brought up by Land to <HI>London</HI> in all the State that could be; and to encourage his Officers to venture their lives, that they might be pompously buried, he was, with all the so∣lemnity possible, and at the charge of the publick, interr'd in <HI>Harry</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Burial<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Chara∣cter</NOTE> Seventh's Chapel, among the Monuments of the Kings. He was a Man of a private Extraction; yet had enough left him by his Father to give him a good Education; which his own Inclination disposed him to re∣ceive in the University of <HI>Oxford;</HI> where he took the degree of a Master of Arts; and was enough versed in Books for a Man who intended not <MILESTONE N="20"/> to be of any Profession, having sufficient of his own to maintain him in the plenty he affected, and having then no appearance of Ambition to be a greater Man than he was. He was of a melancholick and a sullen Na∣ture, and spent his time most with good fellows, who liked his morose∣ness, and a freedom he used in inveighing against the licence of the time, and the power of the Court. They who knew him inwardly, discover'd that he had an Anti-Monarchical Spirit, when few Men thought the Go∣vernment in any danger. When the Troubles begun, he quickly de∣clared himself against the King; and having some Command in <HI>Bristol,</HI> when it was first taken by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> being trusted with the Command of a little Fort upon the Line, he re∣fused to give it up, after the Governour had signed the Articles of Sur∣render, and kept it some hours after the Prince was in the Town, and kill'd some of the Soldiers; for which the Prince resolv'd to hang him, if some friends had not interposed for him, upon his want of experience in War; and prevailed with him to quit the place by very great impor∣tunity, and with much difficulty. After this, having done eminent service to the Parliament, especially at <HI>Taunton,</HI> at Land, He then be∣took himself wholely to the Sea; and quickly made himself signal there. He was the first Man that declined the old track, and made it manifest <MILESTONE N="40"/> that the Science might be attained in less time than was imagin'd; and despised those Rules which had been long in practice, to keep his Ship and his Men out of danger; which had been held in former times a point of great ability and circumspection; as if the principal Art requisite in the Captain of a Ship had been to be sure to come home safe again. He was the first Man who brought the Ships to contemn Castles on shore, which had been thought ever very formidable, and were discover'd by him to make a noise only, and to fright those who could rarely be hurt by them. He was the first that infused that proportion of courage into the Sea-men, by making them see by experience, what mighty things <MILESTONE N="50"/> they could do, if they were resolved; and taught them to sight in Fire as well as upon Water: and though he hath been very well imitated and followed, he was the first that gave the Example of that kind of Naval courage, and bold and resolute Atchievements.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="4840"/>
AFTER all this Lustre and Glory, in which the Protector seem'd to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment comes to∣gether</HI> Jan. 20.</NOTE> flourish, the season of the year threaten'd some tempest and foul wea∣ther. <HI>January</HI> brought the Parliament again together. They did not reassemble with the same temper, and resignation, in which they parted; and it quickly appear'd how unsecure new Institutions of Government are; and when the Contrivers of them have provided, as they think, against all mischievous contingencies, they find, that they have unwa∣rily left a gap open to let their destruction in upon them.</P>
<P>CROMWELL thought he had sufficiently provided for his own secu∣rity, and to restrain the insolence of the Commons, by having call'd the <MILESTONE N="10"/> other House; which by the <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> was to be done; and having fill'd it, for the most part, with the Officers of the Army, and such others as he had good reason to be confident of. So on the twen∣tieth of <HI>January,</HI> the day appointed to meet (whereas, before, the Par∣liament used to attend him in the Painted Chamber, when he had any thing to say to them; now) he came to the House of Lords; where his new Creations were; then he sent the Gentleman Usher of the black Rod to call the Commons to him. And they being conducted to the Bar of that House, He being placed in his Chair under a Cloath of State, begun his Speech in the old Style, <Q>“My Lords, and You, the Knights,” <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>speaks to them.</HI></NOTE> Citizens, and Burgesses, of the House of Commons:</Q> and then discoursed some particulars, which he recommended to them; <Q>thanked them “for” their fair Correspondence the last Session;</Q> and assured them, <Q>“if they would continue to prosecute his Designs, they should be call'd the” blessed of the Lord, and Generations to come should bless them.</Q></P>
<P>BUT assoon as the Commons came to their House, they caused the third Article of the <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> to be read; by which it was provided, that no Members legally chosen should be excluded from the performance of their Duty, but by consent of that House of which they were Members. Upon which, they proceeded to the calling over their <MILESTONE N="30"/> House, and readmitted presently all those who had been excluded for <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The House of Commons re∣admit all their Members, that had been excluded, by Virtue of a Clause in the</HI> Petition <HI>and</HI> Advice.</NOTE> refusing to sign that Recognition of the Protector; and by this means, above a hundred of the most inveterate Enemies the Protector had, came and sate in the House; among whom were S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane, Haslerig,</HI> and many other signal Men; who had much the more Credit and In∣terest in the House, for having been excluded for their fidelity to the Common-wealth; many of those who had subscribed it, valuing them∣selves for having thereby become Instruments to introduce them again, who could never otherwise have come to be readmitted.</P>
<P>ASSOON as these Men came into the House, they begun to question <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Trans∣actions after∣ward.</NOTE> the Authority and Jurisdiction of the other House; <Q>“that it was true, the <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> had admitted there should be such an House; but that it should be a House of Peers, that they should be called <HI>My Lords,</HI> there was no provision; nor did it appear what Jurisdiction it should have: that it would be a very ridiculous thing, if they should suffer those who were created by themselves, and sate only by Their Vote, to be better Men than They, and to have a Negative Voice to” controle their Masters.</Q> <Q>When they had enough vilified them, they question'd the Protector's Authority to send Writs to call them thither: “Who gave him that Authority to make Peers? that it had been the <MILESTONE N="50"/> proper business of that House to have provided for all this; which it is probable they would have done at this meeting, if he had not pre∣sumptuously” taken that Soveraign power upon him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="4850"/>
CROMWELL was exceedingly surprised, and perplexed with this new Spirit; and found that he had been short-sighted in not having pro∣vided, at the same time, for the filling his House of Commons, when he erected his other of Peers: for he had taken away those out of that House who were the boldest Speakers, and best able to oppose this torrent, to institute this other House, without supplying those other places by Men who could as well undergo the Work of the other. However, he made <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>convenes both Houses, and speaks to them.</HI></NOTE> one effort more; and conven'd both Houses before him; and very Ma∣gisterially, and in a Dialect he had never used before, reprehended them <MILESTONE N="10"/> for presuming to question his Authority. <Q>“The other House, he said,” were Lords, and should be Lords;</Q> <Q>and commanded Them “to enter upon such business, as might be for the benefit, not the distraction of” the Common-wealth;</Q> which he would with God's Help prevent. And when he found this Animadversion did not reform them, but that they continued in their presumption, and every day improv'd their re∣proaches and contempt of him, he went to his House of Lords upon the fourth of <HI>February;</HI> <Q>and sending for the Commons, after he had used <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He Dissolves that Parlia∣ment</HI> Feb. 4.</NOTE> many sharp expressions of indignation, he told them, “that it concern'd his Interest, as much as the Peace and Tranquillity of the Nation, to <MILESTONE N="20"/> dissolve that Parliament; and therefore he did put an end to their” sitting.</Q> So that Cloud was, for the present, dissipated, that threaten'd so great a Storm.</P>
<P>THE Parliament being dissolv'd, <HI>Cromwell</HI> found himself at ease to prosecute his other designs. After the taking of <HI>Mardike, Raynolds,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Raynolds <HI>cast away coming out of</HI> Flan∣ders.</NOTE> who was Commander in chief of that Body of the <HI>English</HI> in the Service of <HI>France,</HI> endeavouring to give his Friends in <HI>England</HI> a visit, was, together with some other Officers who accompanied him, cast away, and drown'd at Sea; upon which, before the dissolution of the Parlia∣ment, <HI>Lockhart,</HI> who was the Protector's Embassadour in <HI>France,</HI> was <MILESTONE N="30"/> design'd to take that Charge upon him; and all things, which were to be transported from <HI>England,</HI> for the prosecution of the business in <HI>Flan∣ders</HI> the next Spring, were dispatch'd with the more care, and punctua∣lity, that there might be no room left for the Cardinal to imagine, that the Protector was in any degree perplexed with the contradiction, and ill humour of the Parliament.</P>
<P>ASSOON as he was rid of That, he thought it as necessary to give some Instances at home, how little he feared those Men who were thought to be so much his Rivals in power, and in the opinion of the Army, that he durst not disoblige them. And therefore, after some <MILESTONE N="40"/> sharp expostulations with <HI>Lambert,</HI> who was as positive in his own hu∣mour, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>turns</HI> Lambert <HI>out of the Ar∣my.</HI></NOTE> he sent to him for his Commission; which he sullenly gave up, when there was a general imagination that he would have refused to have deliver'd it. So he was deprived of his Regiment, his authority in the Army, and of being Major General in the North, in an instant, without the least appearance of contradiction or murmur; and the Of∣ficers <HI>Cromwell</HI> substituted in the several places, found all the obedience that had been paid to the other; and <HI>Lambert</HI> retired to his Garden as unvisited and untaken notice of, as if he had never been in authority; which gave great reputation to the Protector, that he was entire Master <MILESTONE N="50"/> of his Army.</P>
<P>HE had observed, throughout the Parliament, that the Major Ge∣nerals were extremely odious to the People, as they had been formida∣ble to Him. For, whilst his Party were prosecuting to have his Autho∣rity
<PB N="474" REF="4860"/>
confirm'd to him, and that he might have the Title of King con∣ferr'd upon him, <HI>Lambert</HI> was as sollicitous to have the Major Generals confirmed by Parliament, and to have their dependence only upon it; which, with the authority they had of listing Men in a readiness, would have made their power, and their strength, in a short time to be equal to the other's. Now that was over, <HI>Cromwell</HI> was content to continue their Names, that they might still be formidable in the Countries, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">He abridges the power of his Major Ge∣nerals.</NOTE> abridged them of all that power which might be inconvenient to Himself.</P>
<P>HE took likewise an occasion from an accident that happen'd, to amuse the People with the apprehension of Plots at home to facilitate <MILESTONE N="10"/> an Invasion from abroad; and sending for the Lord Mayor and Alder∣men to attend him, he made them a large discourse of the danger they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He acquaints the L Mayor</HI> &amp;c. <HI>of the Ci∣ty with a Plot of the Cava∣liers, and the Marquis of</HI> Ormond<HI>'s be∣ing in</HI> Eng∣land.</NOTE> were in of being surprised; <Q>“that there was a design to seise upon the Tower; and at the same time that there should be a general Insurrection in the City of the Cavaliers, and discontented Party, whilst the City remain'd so secure, that they had put their Militia into no posture to be ready to preserve themselves in such an Attempt; but on the con∣trary, that they were so negligent in their Discipline, that the Mar∣quis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had lain securely in the City full three Weeks without being discover'd; who was sent over by the King to countenance a ge∣neral <MILESTONE N="20"/> Insurrection, whilst the King himself, he said, had ten thousand Men ready at <HI>Bruges,</HI> with two and twenty Ships, with which he meant” to invade some other more Northern part of the Kingdom.</Q> <Q>He wish'd them “to lose no time in putting their Militia into a good posture, and to make very strict searches to discover what Strangers were harbour'd” within the Walls of the City, and to keep good Watches every night.</Q> He order'd double Guards to be set about the Tower; and that they might see that there was more than ordinary Occasion for all this, he caused very many Persons of all conditions, most of them such as were reasonably to be suspected to be of the King's Party, to be surprised in <MILESTONE N="30"/> the night in their Beds (for those circumstances made all that was done <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Persons seised on upon that Account.</NOTE> to be the more notorious) and after some short Examination, to be sent to the Tower; and to other Prisons; for there was, at the same time, the same severity used in the several Counties; for the better explana∣tion, and understanding whereof, it will be necessary now that We re∣turn to <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>WITHIN little more than two Months after the King's coming to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Affairs in</HI> Flanders.</NOTE> <HI>Bruges,</HI> the little Treaty which had been sign'd by the Arch-Duke with the King, was sent ratified from <HI>Madrid</HI> by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> with many great compliments; which the King was willing should be believ'd <MILESTONE N="40"/> to be of extraordinary Importance. After wonderful excuses for the Low∣ness of their affairs in all places, which disabled them to perform those Services which are due from, and to a great King, <Q>they let his Maje∣sty know, “that the Catholick King had assigned so many Crowns as amounted to six thousand Guilders, to be paid every Month towards a Royal aid; and half so much more, for the support of the Duke of <HI>Glocester;</HI> that though the Sum was very small, it was as much as their necessities would bear; and the smallness should be recompensed” by the punctuality of the payment;</Q> the first payment being to be made about the middle of the next Month; without taking notice that <MILESTONE N="50"/> the King had been already in that Country near three Months, during which time he had not received the least Present, or assistance towards his support.</P>
<P><PB N="475" REF="4870"/>
THEY were willing that the King should raise four Regiments of Foot, which should march with their Army, until the King should find the season ripe to make an Invasion with that other supply which they were bound by the Treaty to give. But for the raising those four Regiments, there was not one penny allow'd, or any other encourage∣ment, than little Quarters to bring their Men to; and, after their Muster, the common allowance of Bread. However, the King was glad of the opportunity to employ, and dispose of many Officers and Soldiers, who flock'd to him from the time of his first coming into <HI>Flanders.</HI> He re∣solv'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King raises four Re∣giments of his Subjects in</HI> Flanders</NOTE> to raise one Regiment of Guards, the Command whereof he gave to the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> which was to do duty in the Army as common Men, till his Majesty should be in such a posture, that they might be brought about his Person. The Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had a Regiment in order to be commanded by his Lieutenant Colonel, that the <HI>Irish</HI> might be tempted to come over. The Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> would have a Regi∣ment, that such Officers and Soldiers might resort to, who were desirous to serve under his Command: and because the <HI>Scots</HI> had many Officers about the Court, who pretended that they could draw many of their Country Men to them, the King gave the fourth Regiment to the Lord <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Newburgh,</HI> a Nobleman of that Kingdom, of great courage; who had serv'd his Father and himself with very signal fidelity. Those four Re∣giments were raised with more expedition than can be imagined, upon so little encouragement.</P>
<P>ASSOON as the Treaty was confirm'd, in truth, from the time that his Majesty came into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and that he resolv'd to make as entire a Conjunction with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as they would permit, he gave no∣tice to the King of <HI>France,</HI> that he would no longer receive that Pen∣sion, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King no longer receives any Pension from</HI> France.</NOTE> which, during the time he had remain'd at <HI>Cologne,</HI> had been rea∣sonably well paid; but, after his coming into <HI>Flanders,</HI> he never would <MILESTONE N="30"/> receive any part of it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Spanish</HI> Army was at this time before <HI>Conde;</HI> a place garrison'd by the <HI>French</HI> between <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> and <HI>Cambray;</HI> which was in∣vested now by <HI>Don Juan;</HI> who finding that the greatest part of the Gar∣rison consisted of <HI>Irish,</HI> and that there was in it a Regiment commanded by <HI>Muskery,</HI> a nephew of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> he thought this a good season to manifest the dependence the <HI>Irish</HI> had upon the King; and therefore writ to his Majesty at <HI>Bruges,</HI> and desired that he would <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>sent to treat with the Lord</HI> Muskery <HI>at</HI> Condè <HI>about his Regiment.

<P>CONDE was reduced to streights by the time the Marquis came thi∣ther; <MILESTONE N="50"/> who was receiv'd with much more civility by <HI>Don Juan,</HI> at least by the Marquis of <HI>Carracena,</HI> than any Man who related to the King, or indeed than the King himself. The thing they desired of him was, that when the Garrison should be reduced, which was then capitulating,
<PB N="476" REF="4880"/>
he would prevail with those of the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation, when they march'd out, to enter into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Service, that is, as they call'd it, to serve their own King: for they talked of nothing but going over in the Winter into <HI>England;</HI> especially they desired that his Nephew <HI>Muskery,</HI> who had the reputation of a stout and an excellent Officer, as in truth he was, would come over with his Regiment, which was much the best, what∣ever the other would do. After the Capitulation was signed, the Mar∣quis <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Success of the Marquis's conference with</HI> Mus∣kery.</NOTE> easily found opportunity to confer with his Nephew, and the other Officers of the several Regiments. When he had inform'd them of the King's pleasure, and that the entring into the service of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> was, for the present, necessary in order to the King's service, the other Regiments made no scruple of it; and engaged, assoon as they march'd out, to go whither they should be directed.</P>
<P><Q>ONLY <HI>Muskery</HI> expresly refused that either himself, or any of his Men should leave their Colours, till, according to his Articles, they should march into <HI>France.</HI> He said, “it was not consistent with his ho∣nour” to do otherwise.</Q> <Q>But he declared, “that assoon as he should come into <HI>France,</HI> he would leave his Regiment in their Quarters; and would himself ride to the Court, and demand his Pass; which, by his con∣tract with the Cardinal, was to be given to him, whenever his own <MILESTONE N="20"/> King should demand his Service; and his Regiment should likewise” be permitted to march with him.</Q> <Q>It was urged to him, “that it was now in his own power to dispose of himself; which he might lawfully do; but that, when he was found in <HI>France,</HI> he would no more have” it in his power.</Q> <Q>He said, “He was bound to ask his dismission, and the Cardinal was bound to give it: and when he had done His part, he was very confident the Cardinal would not break his word with him; but if he should, he would get nothing by it; for he knew his Men would follow him whithersoever he went; and therefore desired his Uncle to satisfy himself; and to assure the King and <HI>Don Juan,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> that he would, within six weeks, return; and if he might have Quar∣ters assign'd him, his Regiment should be there within few days after” him.</Q> It was in vain to press him farther, and the Marquis telling <HI>Don Juan,</HI> that he believ'd he would keep his word, he was contented to part kindly with him; and had a much better esteem of him than of the other Officers, who came to him, and brought over their Men without any Ceremony.</P>
<P>MUSKERY march'd away with the rest of the Garrison; and assoon as he was in <HI>France,</HI> rode to <HI>Paris;</HI> where the Cardinal then was; who receiv'd him with extraordinary Grace; but when he asked his dismission, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and urged his Capitulation, the Cardinal, by all imaginable caresses, and promises of a pension, endeavour'd to divert him from the inclination; <Q>told him, “that this was only to serve the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and not his own King; who had no employment for him; that if he would stay in their service till the King had need of him, he would take care to send Him, and his Regiment, in a better condition to his Majesty, than they” were now in.</Q> When he could neither by promises, nor reproaches, divert him from quitting their service, he gave him a Pass only for Him∣self; and expresly refused to dismiss the Regiment; <Q>averring, “that he was not bound to it, because there could be no pretence that they <MILESTONE N="50"/> could serve the King; who had no use of them, nor wherewithal to” pay them.</Q></P>
<P>MUSKERY took what he could get, his own Pass; and made hast
<PB N="477" REF="4890"/>
to the place where his Regiment was; and after he had given them such directions as he thought necessary, he came away only with two or three Servants to <HI>Brussels;</HI> and desired <HI>Don Juan</HI> to assign him convenient Quarters for his Regiment; which he very willingly did; and he no sooner gave notice to them whither they should come, but they behaved themselves so, that, by sixes and sevens, his whole Regiment, Officers <NOTE PLACE="marg">Muskery <HI>brings his Re∣giment over to the</HI> Spaniards.</NOTE> and Soldiers, to the number of very near eight hundred, came to the place assign'd them; and brought their Armes with them; which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was amazed at; and ever after very much valued him, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> took as much care for the preservation of that Regiment, as of any that was in their Service.</P>
<P>WHEN the Marquis proposed any thing that concern'd the King, during the time he was in the Army, <HI>Don Juan</HI> still writ to <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> to confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer about it; who found <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor of the Exche∣quer's Confe∣rences with</HI> Don Alonzo.</NOTE> <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> in all respects so untractable, and so absolutely govern'd by the <HI>Irish</HI> Jesuit, who filled his head with the hopes of the Levellers, that, after he had receiv'd the Money that was assign'd to the King, he return'd to <HI>Bruges,</HI> as the Marquis did from the Army, when the busi∣ness of <HI>Conde</HI> was over.</P>
<P>IT was well enough known, at least generally believ'd, from the time <MILESTONE N="20"/> that the secret confidence begun between <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the Cardinal, and long before <HI>Lockhart</HI> appear'd there as Embassadour, that the Car∣dinal had not only promised, <Q>“that the King should receive no assistance from thence; but that no body who related to his Service, or against whom any exception should be taken, should be permitted to reside” in <HI>France;</HI></Q> and that, as the King had already been driven thence; so, when the time should be ripe, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> would be likewise ne∣cessitated to leave that Kingdom. And now, upon the King's coming into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and upon the coming over of the six thousand <HI>English</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> for the Service of <HI>France,</HI> and the publication of the Treaty with <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> did not much desire to keep that Article secret which provided against the King's residing in that Kingdom, and for the exclu∣sion of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and many other Persons, by Name, who at∣tended upon the King, and some who had Charges in the Army. And <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cardinal gives notice to the Duke of</HI> York <HI>that he must leave the</HI> French <HI>Ser∣vice.</HI></NOTE> the Cardinal and the Queen, with some seeming regret, communicated it to the Duke, as a thing they could not refuse, and infinitely lamented, with many professions of kindness and everlasting respect; and all this in confidence, and that he might know it some time before it was to be executed by his departure.</P>
<P>AMONGST those who by that secret Article were to leave the <HI>French</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> Service, the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> was one; whose Name was, as was generally believ'd, put into the Article by the Cardinal, rather than by <HI>Cromwell.</HI> For the Earl, having receiv'd very great obligations from the Cardinal, thought his Interest greater in the Queen than in truth it was (accord∣ing to his Natural custom of deceiving himself) and so, in the Cardi∣nal's disgrace and retirement, had shew'd himself less inclined to his re∣turn than he ought to have been; which the Cardinal never forgave; yet treated him with the same familiarity as before (which the Earl took for pure friendship) until the time came for the publishing this Treaty, <MILESTONE N="50"/> when the Earl was Lieutenant General of the Army in <HI>Italy.</HI> Then he sent for him; and bewailed the condition that <HI>France</HI> was in, <Q>“which obliged them to receive Commands from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> which were very” <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Bristol <HI>order'd also to leave</HI> France</NOTE> uneasy to them; then told him,</Q> <Q>“that he could stay no longer in their
<PB N="478" REF="4900"/>
Service, and that they must be compell'd to dismiss the Duke of <HI>York”</HI> himself;</Q> <Q>but made infinite professions of kindness, and “that they” would part with him, as with a Man that had done them great Service.</Q> The Earl, who could allways much better bear ill Accidents than pre∣vent them, believ'd that all proceeded from the malice of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and quickly had the Image of a better fortune in his fancy than that he was to quit; and so setting his heart upon the getting as good a supply of Money from them as he could, and the Cardinal desiring to part fairly with him, he receiv'd such a Present, as enabled him to remove with a handsome Equipage in Servants and Horses. So he came directly <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Comes to</HI> Bru∣ges <HI>to the King.</HI></NOTE> for <HI>Bruges</HI> to the King; to whom he had made himself in some degree gracious before his Majesty left <HI>Paris.</HI> But his business there was only to present his Duty to his Majesty; where after he had stayed two or three days, he made his journey to the Army to offer his Service to <HI>Don Juan,</HI> without so much as desiring any recommendation from the King.</P>
<P>THERE was nothing more known, than that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had all imaginable prejudice and hatred against the Earl, both for the little kindness he had shew'd towards them in <HI>England,</HI> whilst he was Secre∣tary of State, of which <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> was a faithful Remembrancer, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> for the more than ordinary Animosity he had expressed against them from the time that he had been in the <HI>French</HI> Service; which anger'd them the more, because he had been born in <HI>Spain.</HI> He had then like∣wise render'd himself particularly odious to <HI>Flanders;</HI> where he was proclaim'd, and detested, in all the Rhymes and Songs of the Country, for the savage Outrages his Forces had committed by fire and plunder, two years before, when he made a Winter Incursion with his Troops into that Country, and committed greater Wast than ever the <HI>French</HI> Them∣selves had done, when the Forces were commanded by Them. Upon all which, his Friends disswaded him at <HI>Bruges</HI> from going to the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> Army, where he would receive very cold treatment. But he smiled at the advertisement; <Q>and told them, “that all the time he was in <HI>France,</HI> he was out of his Sphere; and that his own Genius allways disposed” him to <HI>Spain;</HI></Q> where he was now resolv'd to make his Fortune. And with this confidence he left <HI>Bruges,</HI> and went to the Army, when it had newly taken <HI>Conde;</HI> where he found his reception such, both from <HI>Don Juan</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Carracena,</HI> as he had reason to expect; which did not at all deject him.</P>
<P>HE was present when <HI>Don Juan</HI> eat, and when he used to discourse <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ingratiates himself with</HI> Don Juan, <HI>notwithstand∣ing the great prejudice the</HI> Spaniards <HI>had against him.</HI></NOTE> of all things at large; and most willingly of Scholastic points, if his <MILESTONE N="40"/> Confessor, or any other Learned Person, was present. The Earl allways interposed in those discourses with an admirable acuteness, which, be∣sides his exactness in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Language, made his parts wonder'd at by every Body; and <HI>Don Juan</HI> begun to be very much pleased with his Company; and the more, because he was much given to speculations in Astrology; in which he found the Earl so much more conversant than any Man he had met with, that, within a Week after he had first seen him, he desired the Earl to calculate his Nativity. In a word, his presence grew to be very acceptable to <HI>Don Juan;</HI> which when the Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> discern'd, he likewise treated him with more <MILESTONE N="50"/> respect; in which he found likewise his account: for the Earl having been Lieutenant General of the <HI>French</HI> Army under Prince <HI>Thomas,</HI> in conjunction with the Duke of <HI>Modena,</HI> against <HI>Millain,</HI> the very
<PB N="479" REF="4910"/>
year before, when the Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> was Governour there, he could both discourse the several Transactions there with the Marquis, and knew how to take fit occasions, both in his presence and absence, to magnify his Conduct in signal Actions; which the Marquis was very glad to see, and hear, that he did very frequently. And <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> being sent for to the Army to consult some Affair, though he had all imaginable detestation of the Earl, and had prepared as much prejudice towards him in <HI>Don Juan</HI> and the Marquis, when he found him in so much favour with both, he treated him likewise with more regard; and <MILESTONE N="10"/> was well content to hear himself commended by him for understanding the Affairs of <HI>England;</HI> which he desired <HI>Don Juan</HI> and the Marquis should believe him to do. So that before he had been a Month in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> he had perfectly reconciled himself to the Court, and to the Army; and suppressed, and diverted all the prejudice that had been against him; and <HI>Don Juan</HI> invited him to spend the Winter with him at <HI>Brussels.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was another Accident likewise fell out at this time, as if it had been produced by his own Stars. The <HI>French</HI> had yet a Garrison at a place call'd S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Ghislain;</HI> which, being within few leagues of <HI>Brussels,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is Instru∣mental in re∣covering S<SUP>t</SUP>.</HI> Ghislain <HI>to the</HI> Spaniards</NOTE> infested the whole Country very much, and even put them into mutiny <MILESTONE N="20"/> against the Court, that they would think of any other expedition be∣fore they had reduced that Garrison; which was so strong that they had once attempted it, and were obliged to desist. Half the Garrison were <HI>Irish,</HI> under the Command of <HI>Schomberg,</HI> an Officer of the first Rank. Some of the Officers were nearly ally'd to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Lane,</HI> who was Secretary to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <Q>and had written to him to know, “whether the giving up that place would be a service to the King?” and if it would, they would undertake it.</Q> The Marquis sent his Se∣cretary to inform the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> of it; who looked upon it as an op∣portunity sent from Heaven to raise his Fortune with the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> He <MILESTONE N="30"/> communicated it to <HI>Don Juan,</HI> as a matter in his own disposal, and to be conducted by Persons who had a dependence upon him, but yet who intended it only as a service to the King. So now he became en∣trusted between the King and <HI>Don Juan;</HI> which he had from the be∣ginning contrived to be; <HI>Don Juan</HI> being very glad to find he had so much Interest in the King, and the King well pleased that he had such credit with <HI>Don Juan,</HI> of whose Assistance in the next Winter he thought he should have much use; for all Attempts upon <HI>England</HI> must be in the Winter. In a word, this Affair of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Ghislain</HI> was very acceptable to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> their Campagne being ended without any other consi∣derable <MILESTONE N="40"/> Action than the taking of <HI>Conde.</HI> They foresaw a very sad year would succeed, if they should enter into the field, where they were sure the <HI>French</HI> would be early, and leave S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Ghislain</HI> behind them; and they should run more hazard if they begun with the Siege of that place; and therefore they authorised the Earl, to promise great rewards in Money, and Pensions, to those Officers, and Soldiers, who would contribute to the reduction of it. The matter was so well carried, that <HI>Don Juan</HI> assembling his Army together a little before <HI>Christmas,</HI> in a very great frost, and coming before the place, though <HI>Schomberg</HI> dis∣cover'd the Conspiracy, and apprehended two or three of the Officers, <MILESTONE N="50"/> yet the Soldiers, which were upon the Guards in some out-Forts, de∣claring themselves at the same time, and receiving the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he was compell'd to make Conditions, and to give up the place, that he he might have liberty to march away with the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="4920"/>
THIS service was of very great importance to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and of no less detriment to the <HI>French,</HI> and consequently gave great reputa∣tion to the Earl; <Q>who then came to the King at <HI>Bruges,</HI> and said all that he thought fit of <HI>Don Juan</HI> to the King, and, amongst the rest, “that <HI>Don Juan</HI> advised his Majesty to send some discreet Person to <HI>Madrid,</HI> to sollicite his Affairs there; but that he did not think the” Person he had design'd to send thither (who was S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry de Vic,</HI></Q> <Q>that had been long Resident in <HI>Brussels)</HI> “”would be acceptable there.</Q> This was only to introduce another Person, who was dear to him, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Bennet,</HI> who had been formerly in his Office when he was Secretary <MILESTONE N="10"/> of State, and bred by him; and was now Secretary to the Duke of <HI>York;</HI> but upon the factions that were in that Family was so uneasy in his place, that he desired to be in any other Post; and was about this time come to the King, as a forerunner to inform him of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s purpose to be speedily with him, being within few days to take his leave of the Court of <HI>France. Bennet</HI> had been long a Person very acceptable to the King; and therefore his Majesty readily consented, that he should <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He obtains of the King that S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> H. Bennet <HI>should be sent Envoy to</HI> Ma∣drid.</NOTE> go to <HI>Madrid</HI> instead of <HI>de Vic:</HI> so he return'd with the Earl to <HI>Brussels,</HI> that he might be presented, and made known to <HI>Don Juan;</HI> from whom the Earl doubted not to procure particular recommendation. <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>THE time was now come that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> found it necessary <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>leaves</HI> Paris, <HI>and comes to the King at</HI> Bru∣ges.</NOTE> to leave <HI>Paris,</HI> and so came to the King to <HI>Bruges;</HI> where there were then all the visible hopes of the Crown of <HI>England</HI> together, and all the Royal Issue of the late King, the Princess <HI>Henrietta</HI> only excepted; for, besides the King and his two Brothers, the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Glo∣cester,</HI> the Princess Royal of <HI>Orange</HI> made that her way from <HI>Paris</HI> in∣to the Low Countries, and stayed there some days with her Brothers.</P>
<P>IT was at this time that the King made the Chancellor of the Exche∣quer <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancellor of the Exche∣quer made Lord Chan∣cellor.</NOTE> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Herbert,</HI> who was the last Lord Keeper of the great Seal, being lately dead at <HI>Paris.</HI> Now <MILESTONE N="30"/> the King put the Seal, which he had till then kept Himself, into the hands of the Chancellor; which he receiv'd very unwillingly: but the King first employed the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> with whom his Majesty knew he had an entire friendship, to dispose him to receive it; which when he could not do (he giving him many reasons, besides his own unfitness, why there was no need of such an Officer, or indeed any use of the Great Seal till the King should come into <HI>England;</HI> <Q>and “that his Majesty found some ease in being without such an Officer, that he was not troubled with those Suites, which he would be, if the Seal were in the hands of a proper Officer to be used, since every Body <MILESTONE N="40"/> would be then importuning the King for the Grant of Offices, Ho∣nours, and Lands, which would give him great vexation to refuse,” and do him as great mischief by granting.</Q> The which when the Mar∣quis told the King) his Majesty himself went to the Chancellor's lodg∣ing, and took notice of what the Marquis had told him; <Q>and said, “he would deal truly and freely with him; that the principal reason which he had alledged against receiving the Seal, was the greatest reason that” disposed him to confer it upon him.</Q> Thereupon he pulled Letters out of his pocket, which he receiv'd lately from <HI>Paris</HI> for the Grant of se∣veral Reversions in <HI>England</HI> of Offices, and of Lands; one whereof was <MILESTONE N="50"/> of the Queen's House and Lands of <HI>Oatlands,</HI> to the same Man who had purchased it from the State; who would willingly have paid a good Sum of Money to that Person who was to procure such a confirmation
<PB N="481" REF="4930"/>
of his Title; the draught whereof was prepared at <HI>London,</HI> upon con∣fidence that it would have the Seal presently put to it; which being in the King's own hand, none need, as they thought, to be privy to the secret. His Majesty told him also of many other Importunities, with which he was every day disquieted; <Q>and “that he saw no other Remedy to give himself ease, than to put the Seal out of his own keeping, into” such hands as would not be importuned, and would help him to deny.</Q> And thereupon he conjured the Chancellor to receive that Trust, with many gracious promises of his favour and protection. Whereupon the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> using likewise Their perswa∣sions, he submitted to the King's pleasure; who deliver'd the Seal to him in the Council, in the <HI>Christmas</HI> time in the year 1657; which particular is only fit to be mention'd, because many great Affairs, and some Alterations accompanied, though not attended upon it.</P>
<P>AFTER so long and so dark a retirement in <HI>Cologne,</HI> the King's very coming into <HI>Flanders</HI> raised the Spirits of his Friends in <HI>England.</HI> And when they were assured that there was a Treaty sign'd between his Ma∣jesty and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> they made no doubt of an Army sufficient to begin the business, and then that the general affections of the King∣dom <MILESTONE N="20"/> would finish it. The King, who had hitherto restrain'd his Friends from exposing themselves to unnecessary dangers, thought it now fit to encourage them to put themselves into such a posture, that they might be ready to joyn with him when he appear'd; which he hoped the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would enable him to do in the depth of Winter. <Q>Several Messengers were sent from <HI>England</HI> to assure him, “that there was so <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Transaction of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI></NOTE> universal a readiness there, that they could hardly be perswaded to” stay to expect the King, but they would begin the Work Themselves:</Q> yet they complain'd much of the backwardness of those who were most trusted by the King, and They again as much inveighed against the rash∣ness <MILESTONE N="30"/> and precipitation of the other, <Q>“that they would ruin themselves,” and all People who should joyn with them.</Q></P>
<P>THE King was much perplexed to discover this distemper amongst those, who, if they were united, would find the Work very hard; and though he preferr'd in his own opinion the judgement of those that were most wary, yet it concern'd him to prevent the other from appearing in an unseasonable Engagement; <Q>and therefore He sent to them, and conjured them “to attempt nothing, till he sent a Person to them, who, if they were ready, should have Authority enough to perswade the rest to a conjunction with them, and should himself be fit to conduct them” <MILESTONE N="40"/> in any reasonable Enterprise.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> had frankly offer'd to the King, “that he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which was the occasion of the Marquis of</HI> Ormond<HI>'s go¦ing into</HI> Eng∣land.</NOTE> would privately go into <HI>England,</HI> and confer with those who were most forward; and if he found, that their counsels were discreetly laid, he would encourage them, and unite all the rest to them; and if mat∣ters” were not ripe, he would compose them to be quiet;</Q> and there was no Man in <HI>England</HI> affected to the King's Service, who would not be readily advised by him. The Chancellor would by no means consent to his journey, as an unreasonable Adventure upon an improbable de∣sign, seeing no ground to imagine they could do any thing. But the <MILESTONE N="50"/> Marquis exceedingly undervalued any imagination of danger; and it cannot be conceiv'd, with what security all Men ventur'd every day, in the heigth of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s jealousy and vigilance, to go into <HI>England,</HI> and to stay a Month in <HI>London,</HI> and return again. The King consenting to
<PB N="482" REF="4940"/>
the journey, the chief care was, that the Marquis's absence from <HI>Bruges</HI> might not create jealousy, and discourse, <Q>“”whither he should be gone.</Q> <Q>Therefore it was for some time discoursed, “that the Marquis of <HI>Or∣mond”</HI></Q> was to go into <HI>Germany</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> (who was known to have affection for the King) and <Q>“that he should from thence” bring with him two Regiments for the Service of his Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>THESE discourses being generally made and believ'd, the Marquis took his Leave publickly of the King, with his Servants fit for such a journey, who continued the Journey towards <HI>Germany;</HI> so that the Letters from <HI>Cologne</HI> to all places gave an Account of the Marquis of <MILESTONE N="10"/> <HI>Ormond</HI>'s being there; whilst he himself, with one only Servant, and <HI>ONeile</HI> (who had encouraged him very much to that undertaking) took the way of <HI>Holland;</HI> and hired a Bark at <HI>Schevelin;</HI> in which they em∣barked, and were safely landed in <HI>Essex;</HI> from whence, without any trouble, they got to <HI>London,</HI> whilst the Parliament was still sitting. When he was there, he found means to speak with most of those of any condition upon whose Advice, and Interest, the King most depended, and against whose positive Advice his Majesty would not suffer any thing to be attempted. That which troubled him most was to discover a jea∣lousy, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The temper he found the King's friends in.</NOTE> or rather an Animosity between many of those who equally wish'd <MILESTONE N="20"/> the King's Restoration, to that degree, that they would neither confer nor correspond with each other. They who had the most experience, and were of the greatest reputation with those who would appear when any thing was to be done, but would not expose themselves in Meetings or Correspondencies before, <Q>complain'd very much of “the rashness of the other, who believ'd any Officer of the Army that pretended dis∣content, and would presently desire them to communicate with such Persons; which because they refused (as they had reason) the others loaded them with reproaches, as having lost all affection and zeal for” his Majesty's Service.</Q> <Q>They protested, “that they could not discover <MILESTONE N="30"/> or believe that there was any such preparations in readiness, that it could be counsellable to appear in Armes against a Government so for∣tified, and established, as the Protector's seem'd to be: that it was pro∣bable the Parliament might not comply with <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s desires; and then there was such a discovery of Malice between several Persons of potent Condition, that many advantages might be offer'd to the King's Party: if they would have the patience to attend the event, and till those Factions should be engaged in blood, they might be sure to ad∣vance the King's Interest in disposing of themselves; but if they should engage, before such a time, in any Insurrection, or by seising some in∣significant <MILESTONE N="40"/> Town, all dissenting Parties would be reconciled, till the King's friends should all be ruin'd, though they might afterwards re∣turn” to their old Animosities.</Q> <Q>In a word, though they appear'd very wary, they declared such a resignation to the King's pleasure, “that, if the Marquis were satisfied, upon his conference with other Men, that the time was ripe for their appearance in Armes, they would present∣ly receive his Orders; and do what he should require, how unsuccess∣fully” soever.</Q></P>
<P>ON the other side, there were many younger Men, who, having had no part in the former War, were impatient to shew their courage <MILESTONE N="50"/> and affection to the King. And those Men, being acquainted with ma∣ny of the old Officers of the late King's Army, who saw many of their old Soldiers now in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Army, and found them to talk after
<PB N="483" REF="4950"/>
their old manner, concluded that they would all appear for the King, assoon as they should see his Colours flying. These Men talking toge∣ther, would often discourse, how easy a thing it would be, with two Troops of Horse, to beat up such a Quarter, or seise such a Guard; and then those Men consulted how to get those Troops, and found Men who had listed so many, which would be ready upon call. There were allways in these Meetings some Citizens, who undertook for the affection of the City; and some of these made little doubt of seising upon the Tower. And truly the putting many Gentlemen's Sons as ap∣prentices into the City, since the beginning of the Troubles, had made <MILESTONE N="10"/> a great alteration, at least in the general talk of that People. It was upon this kind of Materials, that many honest Men did build their hopes, and upon some assurances they had from Officers of the Army, who were as little to be depended upon.</P>
<P>THERE was another particular, which had principally contributed to this distemper, which passing from hand to hand had made Men im∣patient to be in Armes; which was an opinion, that the King was even ready to land with such an Army as would be able to do his business. This had been dispersed by some who had been sent Expresses into <HI>Flanders;</HI> who, though they allways lay conceal'd during the time they <MILESTONE N="20"/> waited for their dispatches from the King, yet found some friends and acquaintance about the Court, or in their way, who thought they did the King good service in making his Majesty be thought to be in a good condition; and so fill'd those People with such discourses, as would make them most welcome when they return'd.</P>
<P>WHEN the Marquis had taken the full survey of all that was to be depended upon, he conjured the warmer People to be quiet, and not to think of any Action till they should be infallibly sure of the King's being landed, and confirm'd the other in their wariness; and being in∣formed that <HI>Cromwell</HI> knew of his being there, and made many searches <MILESTONE N="30"/> for him, he thought it time to return. And so about the time that the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis returns out of</HI> England.</NOTE> Parliament was dissolv'd, he was conducted by D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Quatermaine,</HI> the King's Physician, through <HI>Sussex;</HI> and there embarked, and safely trans∣ported into <HI>France;</HI> from whence he came into <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>THIS gave the Occasion to <HI>Cromwell</HI> to make that discourse before mentioned to the Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> of the Lord Mar∣quis of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s having been three weeks in the City; of which he had receiv'd perfect Intelligence from a hand that was not then in the least degree suspected, nor was then wicked enough to put him into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s hand; which he could easily have done; of which more <MILESTONE N="40"/> shall be said hereafter. But when the Protector was well assured that the Marquis was out of his reach, which vexed and grieved him ex∣ceedingly, he caused all Persons, who he knew had, or he thought <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>ap∣prehends seve∣ral Persons.</HI></NOTE> might, have spoken with him, to be apprehended. All Prisons, as well in the Country as the City, were fill'd with those who had been of the King's Party, or he believ'd would be; and he thought this a necessary season to terrify his Enemies, of all conditions, within the Kingdom, with Spectacles which might mortify them.</P>
<P>IN the preparations which had been made towards an Insurrection, many Persons in the Country, as well as in the City, had receiv'd Com∣missions <MILESTONE N="50"/> for Regiments of Horse and Foot; and, amongst the rest, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Stapley,</HI> a Gentleman of a good extraction, and a good fortune in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Stapley <HI>Engagement for the King.</HI></NOTE> the County of <HI>Sussex;</HI> whose Mother had been Sister to the Earl of
<PB N="484" REF="4960"/>
<HI>Norwich,</HI> but his Father had been in the Number of the blackest Of∣fenders, and one of the King's Judges. This Son of his, who now pos∣sessed his Estate, had taken great pains to mingle in the Company of those who were known to have affection for the King; and, upon all occasions, made professions of a desire, for the expiation of his Father's Crime, to venture his own life, and his fortune for his Majesty's Re∣storation; and not only his Fortune, but his Interest was considerable in that Maritime County: so that many thought fit to cherish those inclinations in him, and to encourage him to hope, that his fidelity might deserve to enjoy that Estate, which the treason of his Father had forfeited.</P>
<P>THERE was a young Gentleman, <HI>John Mordaunt,</HI> the younger Son, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Mordaunt <HI>is active for the King.</HI></NOTE> and Brother, of the Earls of <HI>Peterborough;</HI> who, having been too young to be engaged in the late War, during which time he had his education in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> was now of age, of parts, and great vi∣gour of mind, and newly married to a young beautiful Lady of a very Loyal Spirit, and notable vivacity of Wit and Humour, who concurr'd with him in all honourable dedications of himself. He resolv'd to em∣brace all opportunities to serve the King, and to dispose those upon whom he had influence, to take the same resolution; and being allied <MILESTONE N="20"/> to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> he did by him inform his Majesty of his re∣solution, and his readiness to receive any commands from him. This was many Months before the Marquis's journey into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>M<SUP>r</SUP> STAPLEY was well known to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> who had repre∣sented his affections to the King, and how useful he might be towards the possessing some place in <HI>Sussex,</HI> and his undertaking that he would do so, by a Letter to the King under M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Stapley</HI>'s own hand: and thereupon M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> desired, that his Majesty would send a Com∣mission for the Command of a Regiment of Horse to him; which he would provide, and cause to be ready against the season he should be re∣quired <MILESTONE N="30"/> to appear: which Commission, with many others, was sent to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt;</HI> and he deliver'd it to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Stapley;</HI> who was exceedingly pleased with it, renew'd all his vowes and protestations; and it is still believ'd that he really meant all he pretended. But he had trusted some Servant, who betray'd him; and being thereupon sent for by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> his Father's fast old Friend, was by him so cajoled by pro∣mises and by threats, that he was not able to withstand him; but be∣lieving that he knew already all that he asked him, he conceal'd nothing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Stapley <HI>discovers what he knew of the plot.</HI></NOTE> that he knew himself; inform'd him of those of the same Country who were to joyn with him; of whom some had likewise receiv'd Com∣missions, <MILESTONE N="40"/> as well as himself; <Q>and in the end he confessed, “that he had” receiv'd his Commission from M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI>'s own hand.</Q> Before this discovery M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> had been sent for by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and very strict∣ly examin'd, whether he had seen the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> during his late being in <HI>London;</HI> which, though he had done often, he very con∣fidently and positively denied, being well assured that it could not be proved, and that the Marquis himself was in safety: upon which con∣fident denial, he was dismissed to return to his own Lodging. But upon <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Mordaunt <HI>seised on, and committed to the Tower</HI></NOTE> this discovery by <HI>Stapley,</HI> he was within two days after, sent for again, and committed close Prisoner to the Tower; and new Men were every day sent for, and committed in all Quarters of the Kingdom; and with∣in <MILESTONE N="50"/> some time after, a high Court of Justice was erected for the Trial of the Prisoners, the Crimes of none being yet discover'd; which put all
<PB N="485" REF="4970"/>
those who knew how liable they themselves were, under a terrible con∣sternation.</P>
<P>BEFORE this high Court of Justice, of which <HI>John Lisle,</HI> who gave <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Mordaunt, <HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> H Slingsby, <HI>and D<SUP>r</SUP></HI> He∣wet, <HI>tryed be∣fore a high Court of Ju∣stice.</HI></NOTE> his Vote in the King's blood, and continued an entire Confident and In∣strument of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s, was President; there were first brought to be tried, <HI>John Mordaunt;</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Slingsby,</HI> a Gentleman of a very an∣cient Family, and of a very ample fortune in <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> and D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hewet,</HI> an eminent Preacher in <HI>London,</HI> and very orthodox, to whose Church those of the King's Party frequently resorted, and few but those. These <MILESTONE N="10"/> three were totally unacquainted with each other; and though every one of them knew enough against himself, they could not accuse one another, if they had been inclined to it. The first and the last could not doubt but that there would be evidence enough against them; and they had found means to correspond so much together, as to resolve that neither of them would plead to the impeachment, but demur to the ju∣risdiction of the Court, and desire to have Council assign'd to argue against it in point of Law; they being both sufficiently instructed, how to urge Law enough to make it evident that neither of them could be legally tryed by that Court, and that it was erected contrary to Law. <MILESTONE N="20"/> The first that was brought to tryal, was M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt.</HI> After his Ar∣raignment, by which he found that the delivery of the Commission to <HI>Stapley</HI> would be principally insisted on, and which he knew might too easily be proved, he, according to former resolution, refused to plead not-guilty; but insisted, <Q>“that by the Law of the Land he ought not” to be tryed by that Court;</Q> <Q>for which he gave more reasons than they could answer; and then desired, “that his Council might have liberty” to argue the point in Law;</Q> <Q>which of course used to be granted in all legal Courts. But he was told, “that he was better to bethink himself; that they were well satisfied in the legality of their Court, and would <MILESTONE N="30"/> not suffer the jurisdiction of it to be disputed; that the Law of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> had provided a Sentence for such obstinate Persons as refused to be tryed by it; which was, that they should be condemned as mutes;” which would be His Case, if he continued refractory:</Q> so he was car∣ried back to the Tower, to consider better what he would do the next day. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Slingsby</HI> was called next. He knowing nothing of, or for the other resolution, pleaded not-guilty; and so was sent to the Prison to be tryed in his turn. D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hewet,</HI> whose greatest Crime was collect∣ing and sending Money to the King, besides having given Money to some Officers, refused to plead, as M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> had done, and de∣manded <MILESTONE N="40"/> that his Council might be heard; and received the same an∣swer, and admonition, that the other had done; and was remitted again to Prison.</P>
<P>THOSE Courts seldom consisted of sewer than twenty Judges; a∣mongst whom, there were usually some, who, out of pity or for Money, were inclin'd to do good Offices to the Prisoners who came before them; at least to communicate such Secrets to them, as might inform them what would be most pressed against them. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI>'s Lady had, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The means by which M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Mordaunt <HI>escaped Sen∣tence</HI></NOTE> by giving Money, procured some in the number, to be very propitious to her Husband: and in the evening of that day the Tryal had been be∣gun, <MILESTONE N="50"/> she receiv'd two very important advices from them. <Q>The one, “that she should prevail with her Husband to plead; then his Friends might do him some Service: whereas, if he insisted upon the point of” Law, he would infallibly suffer, and no Man durst speak for him.</Q> <Q>The
<PB N="486" REF="4980"/>
other, “that they had no sufficient proof to condemn him upon any particular with which he stood charged, but only for the delivery of the Commission to <HI>Stapley;</HI> and that there was to that point, besides <HI>Stapley,</HI> one Colonel <HI>Mallory,</HI> whose testimony was more valued than” the other's.</Q> This <HI>Mallory</HI> had the reputation of an honest Man, and lov'd M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> very well, and was one of those who were princi∣pally trusted in the business of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and had been apprehended about the same time that <HI>Stapley</HI> was; and finding, upon his first Examina∣tion, by the Questions administer'd to him by <HI>Thurlow,</HI> that all was dis∣cover'd, he unwarily confessed all that he knew concerning M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mor∣daunt;</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> having been himself the Person principally employed between him and <HI>Stapley.</HI> He was brought in Custody from the Tower, to give in Evidence against M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mardaunt,</HI> with an intention in the Court, af∣ter he had done that good Service, to proceed as strictly against himself, though they promised him indemnity.</P>
<P>THE Lady, having clear information of this whole matter, could not find any way that night to advertise her Husband, that he should no more insist upon the want of Jurisdiction in the Court. For there was no possibility of speaking with, or sending to him, during the time of his Tryal. Therefore she laid aside the thought of that business till <MILESTONE N="20"/> the morning, and passed the night in contriving how <HI>Mallory</HI> might be prevailed with to make an Escape; and was so dextrous, and so fortu∣nate, that a friend of hers disposed the Money she gave him so effectually, that the next morning, when <HI>Mallory</HI> was brought to the Hall to be ready to give in his Evidence, he found some means to withdraw from his Guard, and when he was in the Croud he easily got away.</P>
<P>SHE had as good fortune likewise to have a little Note she writ con∣cerning the other Advice, put into her Husband's hand, as he passed to the Bar; which having perused, he departed from his former resolution; and after he had modestly urged the same again which he had done the <MILESTONE N="30"/> day before, to spend time, and the President, in much choler, answer∣ing as he had done, he submitted to his Tryal; and behaved himself with courage; and easily evaded the greatest part of the Evidence they had against him; nor could they find proof, what presumption soever there might be, that he had spoken with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> and he evaded many other particulars of his correspondence with the King, with notable Address. That of the Commission of <HI>Stapley</HI> was reserv'd to the last; and the Commission being produced, and both the hand and the signet generally known, by reason of so many of the like, which had fallen into their hands at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and by many other Accidents, M<SUP>r</SUP> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Stapley</HI> was called to declare where he had it; and seeing himself con∣fronted by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> though he did, after many questions and re∣proaches from the Council that prosecuted, at last confess that he did re∣ceive it from M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt;</HI> yet he did it in so disorderly and confused a manner, that it appear'd he had much rather not have said it; and an∣swer'd the Questions M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> asked him with that confusion, that his Evidence could not be satisfactory to any impartial Judges. Then <HI>Mallory</HI> was called for; but by no search could be sound; and they could not, by their own rules, defer their Sentence. And it so fell out by one of the Judge's withdrawing upon a suddain fit of the Stone, that the Court <MILESTONE N="50"/> was divided, one half for the condemning him, and the other half that he was not guilty; whereupon the determination depended upon the single Vote of the President; who made some excuses for the Justice he was
<PB N="487" REF="4990"/>
about to do, and acknowledged many obligations to the Mother of the Prisoner, and, in contemplation thereof, pronounced him Innocent for ought appear'd to the Court. There was not in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s time the like Instance; and scarce any other Man escaped the judgement, that was tryed before any high Court of Justice. And he was so offended at it, that, contrary to all the forms used by themselves, he caused him to be kept for some Months after in the Tower, and would willingly have brought him to be tryed again. For, within a day or two after, <HI>Mallory</HI> was retaken, and they had likewise corrupted a <HI>French-</HI>man, who had <MILESTONE N="10"/> long serv'd him, and was the only Servant whom he had made choice of (since he was to be allow'd but one) to attend him in the Prison: and he had discover'd enough to have taken away his Life several ways. But the scandal was so great, and the Case so unheard of, that any Man, discharg'd upon a publick Tryal, should be again proceeded against upon new Evi∣dence for the same offence, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself thought not fit to un∣dergo the Reproach of it, but was in the end prevail'd with to set him at liberty. And he was very few days at liberty, before he embarked himself as frankly in the King's Service as before, and with better success.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Harry Slingsby,</HI> and poor D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hewet</HI> had worse fortune; and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> H. Slingsby, <HI>condemn'd</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"/> Their blood was the more thirsted after for the other's indemnity; and the Court was too severely reprehended, to commit the same fault again. The former had lain two years in Prison in <HI>Hull,</HI> and was brought now up to the Tower, for fear they might not discover enough of any new Plot, to make so many formidable Examples, as the present conjuncture required. They had against him Evidence enough (besides his incorrigi∣ble fidelity to the Crown from the first assaulting it) that he had con∣triv'd, and contracted with some Officers of <HI>Hull,</HI> about the time that the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> had been in <HI>York-shire</HI> two years before, for the deli∣very of one of the Block-Houses to him for the King's Service: nor did <MILESTONE N="30"/> he care to defend himself against the Accusation; but rather acknow∣ledged, and justified his Affection, and own'd his Loyalty to the King, with very little compliment, or ceremony to the present power. The <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and Doctor</HI> Hewet, <HI>re∣fusing still to plead.</HI></NOTE> other, D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hewet,</HI> receiving no information of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI>'s declining the way formerly resolv'd upon (which it was not possible to convey to him in that instant, no body being suffer'd to speak with him) and being brought to the Bar assoon as the other was remov'd from it, persisted in the same resolution, and spoke only against the illegality of the Court; which, upon better information, and before the Judgement was pro∣nounced against him, he desired to retract, and would have put himself <MILESTONE N="40"/> upon his Tryal: but they then refused to admit him; and so sentence of death was pronounced against them both; which they both underwent <NOTE PLACE="marg">They are both Executed.</NOTE> with great Christian courage.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Harry Slingsby,</HI> as is said before, was in the first Rank of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Harry Slingsby.</NOTE> Gentlemen of <HI>York-shire;</HI> and was return'd to serve as a Member in the Parliament that continued so many years; where he sate till the Troubles begun; and having no relation to, or dependence upon the Court, he was swayed only by his Conscience to detest the violent and undutiful beha∣viour of that Parliament. He was a Gentleman of a good understanding, but of a very melancholick nature, and of very few words: and when he <MILESTONE N="50"/> could stay no longer with a good Conscience in their Councils, in which he never concurr'd, he went into his Country, and joyn'd with the first who took up Armes for the King. And when the War was ended, he re∣main'd still in his own House, prepared and disposed to run the fortune of
<PB N="488" REF="5000"/>
the Crown in any other attempt. And having a good fortune and a ge∣neral reputation, had a greater Influence upon the People, than They who talked more and louder; and was known to be irreconcilable to the new Government; and therefore was cut off, notwithstanding very great intercession to preserve him. For he was Uncle to the Lord <HI>Fal∣conbridge;</HI> who engaged his Wife and all his new Allies to intercede for him, without effect. When he was brought to die, he spent very little time in discourse; <Q>but told them, “he was to die for being an honest” Man, of which he was very glad.</Q></P>
<P>D<SUP>r</SUP> HEWET was born a Gentleman, and bred a Scholar, and was a <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And of D<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Hewet</NOTE> Divine before the beginning of the Troubles. He lived in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and in the Army, till the end of the War, and continued afterwards to preach with great applause in a little Church in <HI>London;</HI> where, by the affection of the <HI>Parish,</HI> he was admitted, since he was enough known to lie noto∣riously under the brand of Malignity. When the Lord <HI>Falconbridge</HI> married <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s daughter (who had used secretly to frequent his Church) after the ceremony of the time, He was made choice of to marry them according to the order of the Church; which engaged both that Lord and Lady, to use their utmost credit with the Protector to preserve his Life; but he was inexorable, and desirous that the Church∣men, <MILESTONE N="20"/> upon whom he looked as his mortal enemies, should see what they were to trust to, if they stood in need of his Mercy.</P>
<P>IT was then believed that, if he had pleaded, he might have been quitted, since in truth he never had been with the King at <HI>Cologne</HI> or <HI>Bruges;</HI> with which he was charged in his Indictment; and they had blood enough in their power to pour out; for, besides the two before∣mention'd, to whom they granted the favour to be beheaded, there were three others, Colonel <HI>Ashton, Stacy,</HI> and <HI>Bettely,</HI> condemn'd by the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colonel</HI> Ash∣ton, <HI>and</HI> Sta∣cy, <HI>and</HI> Bette∣ley, <HI>Citizens, condemn'd and executed.</HI></NOTE> same Court; who were treated with more severity; and were hanged, drawn, and quarter'd, with the utmost rigour, in several great Streets in <MILESTONE N="30"/> the City, to make the deeper impression upon the People, the two last being Citizens. But all Men appeared so nauseated with blood, and so tired with those abominable Spectacles, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> thought it best to pardon the rest who were condemn'd, or rather to reprieve them; amongst whom <HI>Mallory</HI> was one; who was not at liberty till the King's Return; and was more troubled for the weakness he had been guilty of, than They were against whom he had trespassed.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King, and all who were faithful to him, were exceed∣ingly afflicted with this bloody proceeding, yet <HI>Cromwell</HI> did not seem to be the more confirm'd in his Tyranny. It is true, the King's Party was the <MILESTONE N="40"/> more dispirited; but <HI>Cromwell</HI> found another kind of Enemy much more <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>found new E∣nemies among the Sectaries.</HI></NOTE> dangerous than they, and that knew better how to deal with him in his own way. They who were raised by him, and who had rais'd him, even al∣most the whole Body of Sectaries, Anabaptists, Independents, Quakers, de∣clar'd an implacaple hatred against him; and whilst they contrived how to raise a power to contend with him, they likewise enter'd into several Con∣spiracies to assassinate him; which he exceedingly apprehended. They <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Address sent by the A∣nabaptists to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King</NOTE> sent an Address to the King by one of their Party, a young Gentleman of an honourable Extraction, and great parts, by whom they made ma∣ny extravagant Propositions, and seem'd to depend very much upon the <MILESTONE N="50"/> death of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and thereupon to compute their own power to serve the King; who gave such an Answer only to them, as might dispose them to hope for his savour, if he receiv'd service from them; and to
<PB N="489" REF="5010"/>
believe that he did not intend to persecute, or trouble any Men for their Opinions, if their Actions were peaceable; which they pretended to affect.</P>
<P>SINCE the Spirit, Humour, and Language of that People, and, in truth, of that time, cannot be better described and represented, than by that Petition and Address, which was never published, and of which there remains no Copy in any hand, that I know of, but only the Ori∣ginal, which was presented to the King (it being too dangerous a thing for any Man who remained in <HI>England,</HI> to have any such transcript in his Custody) it will not be amiss in this place to insert the Petition and <MILESTONE N="10"/> Address, in the very words in which it was presented to his Majesty, with the Letter, that accompanied it from the Gentleman mention'd before, who was an Anabaptist of special trust among them, and who came not with the Petition, but expected the King's pleasure upon the receipt of it; it being sent by an Officer who had serv'd the King in an eminent Command, and was now gracious amongst those Sectaries without swerving in the least degree from his former principles and in∣tegrity: for that People allways pretended a just esteem and value of all Men who had faithfully adhered to the King, and lived soberly and virtuously. The Address was in these words: <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<Q><P><HI>To his most excellent Majesty,</HI> Charles <HI>the second, King of great</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Address it self.</NOTE> Britain, France, <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>and the Dominions thereunto be∣longing.</HI></P>

<P><Q>“WHEN We sit down, and recount the wonderful and unheard of <MILESTONE N="30"/> Dispensations of God amongst Us, when We call to our remembrances the tragical Actions, and Transactions of these late times, when We seriously consider the dark and mysterious effects of Providence, the unexpected disappointment of Counsels, the strange and strong con∣vulsions of State, the various and violent Motions and Commotions of the People, the many Changings, Turnings, and Overturnings of Go∣vernours, and Governments, which, in the revolutions of a few years, have been produced in this Land of Miracles, We cannot but be even swallowed up in Astonishment, and are constrain'd to command an un∣willing silence upon our sometimes mutinous, and over-inquiring hearts, <MILESTONE N="40"/> resolving all into the good Will and Pleasure of that all-disposing One,” whose Wisdom is unsearchable, and whose Ways are past finding out.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“BUT although it is, and We hope ever will be, far from Us, either peevishly or presumptuously to kick against the irresistible Decrees of Heaven, or vainly to attempt, by any faint and infirm designs of Ours, to give an interruption to that over-ruling Divine hand, which steers, and guides, governs, and determines the Affairs of the whole world; yet We cannot but judge it a Duty highly incumbent upon Us, to en∣deavour, as much as in Us lies, to repair the breaches of our dear Coun∣try. And, since it is our lot (We may say our unhappiness) to be em∣bark'd <MILESTONE N="50"/> in a Shipwrack'd Common-wealth (which, like a poor weather∣beaten pinnace, has, for so long a time, been tossed upon the waves and billows of Faction, split upon the rocks of violence, and is now almost quite devour'd in the quick-sands of Ambition; what can We do more worthy of <HI>English</HI> Men, as We are by Nation, or of <HI>Christians,</HI> as We
<PB N="490" REF="5020"/>
are by Profession, than every one of Us to put our hand to an Oar, and try if it be the Will of our God, that such weak Instruments as We, may be, in any measure, helpful to bring it at last into the safe and quiet” harbour of justice and righteousness?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“To this Undertaking, though too great for Us, We are apt to think our selves so much the more strongly engaged, by how much the more We are sensible, that as our Sins have been the greatest causes, so our many follies and imprudences have not been the least means of giving both birth and growth to those many miseries, and calamities, which We, together with three once most flourishing Kingdoms, do at this” <MILESTONE N="10"/> day sadly groan under.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“IT is not, the Lord knows, it is not pleasing unto Us, nor can We be∣lieve it will be grateful to your Majesty, that We should recur to the beginnings, rise, and root of the late unhappy differences betwixt your Royal Father and the Parliament. In such a discourse as this, We may seem, perhaps, rather to go about to make the Wounds bleed afresh, than to endeavour the curing of them: yet forasmuch as We do profess, that We come not with Corrosives but with Balsoms, and that our desire is not to hurt but heal, not to pour Vineger but Oyl into the wounds, We hope your Majesty will give Us leave to open them gently, that We may <MILESTONE N="20"/> apply remedies the more aptly, and discover our own past errors the” more clearly.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“IN what posture the Affairs of these Nations stood, before the noise of Drums and Trumpets disturbed the sweet harmony that was amongst Us, is not unknown to your Majesty: that We were blest with a long Peace, and together with it, with riches, wealth, plenty, and abundance of all things, the lovely companions and beautiful products of Peace, must ever be acknowledg'd with thankfulness to God, the Author of it, and with a grateful veneration of the Memory of those Princes, your Father, and Grandfather, by the propitious Influence of whose care, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> wisdom, We thus flourish'd. But, as it is observ'd in natural Bodies, idle∣ness, and fulness of diet, do for the most part lay the foundation of those Maladies, and secretly nourish those diseases, which can hardly be ex∣pell'd by the assistance of the most skilful Physician, and seldom without the use of the most loathsome Medicines, nay sometimes not without the hazardous tryal of the most dangerous Experiments; so did We find it, by sad experience, to be in this great Body Politick. It cannot be denied, but the whole Common-wealth was faint, the whole Nation sick, the whole Body out of order, every Member thereof feeble, and every part thereof languishing. And in this so general, and universal <MILESTONE N="40"/> a distemper, that there should be no weakness nor infirmity, no un∣soundness in the Head, cannot well be imagin'd. We are unwilling to enumerate particulars, the mention whereof would but renew old griefs, but, in general, We may say, and We think it will gain the easy assent of all Men, that there were many errours, many defects, many excesses, many irregularites, many illegal and eccentrical Proceedings (some of which were in matters of the highest and greatest concernments) manifestly appearing as blots, and stains, upon the otherwise good Go∣vernment of the late King. That these proceeded from the pravity of his own disposition, or from Principles of Tyranny radicated and im∣planted <MILESTONE N="50"/> in his own Nature, We do not see how it can be asserted, with∣out apparent injury to the truth; it being confessed, even by his most peevish Enemies, that He was a Gentleman, as of the most strong and perfect Intellectuals, so of the best and purest Morals, of any Prince that
<PB N="491" REF="5030"/>
ever swayed the <HI>English</HI> Scepter. This the then Parliament being sensi∣ble of, and desirous, out of a Zeal they had to the honour of their Sove∣raign, to disperse and dispel those black Clouds that were contracted about him, that he might shine the more glorious in the beauty of his own Lustre, thought themselves engaged in duty to endeavour to re∣deem, and rescue him from the violent and strong impulses of his evil Counsellors; who did captivate him at their pleasures to their own cor∣rupt Lusts, and did every day thrust him into Actions prejudicial to him∣self,” and destructive to the common Good and Safety of the People.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“UPON this Account, and to this, and no other end, were We at first <MILESTONE N="10"/> invited to take up Armes; and though We have too great cause to con∣clude from what We have since seen acted, that, under those plausible, and guilded pretences of Liberty and Reformation, there were secretly managed the hellish designs of wicked, vile, and ambitious Persons (whom though then, and for a long time after, concealed, Providence, and the Series of things, have since discover'd to Us) yet We bless God, that We went out in the simplicity of our Souls, aiming at nothing more but what was publickly own'd in the face of the Sun; and that We were so far from entertaining any thoughts of casting off our Allegiance to <MILESTONE N="20"/> his Majesty, or extirpating his Family, that We had not the least inten∣tions of so much as abridging him of any of his just Prerogatives, but on∣ly of restraining those excesses of Government for the future, which were nothing but the excrescences of a wanton Power, and were more truly” to be accounted the burthens, than ornaments, of his Royal Diadem.</Q></P>

Thus far We can say We have gone right, keeping the road of honesty and sincerity, and having as yet done nothing but what We think We are able to justify, not by those weak and beggarly Arguments, drawn either from success, which is the same to the just and to the unjust, or from the silence and satisfaction of a be∣calm'd Conscience, which is more often the effect of blindness than Vir∣tue, but from the sure, safe, sound, and unerring Maxims of law, justice,” reason, and righteousness.</Q></P>

What have We done, nay, what have We Not done, which either hellish Policy was able to contrive, or brutish power to execute?

Surely We may take up the lamentation of the Prophet concerning this the Land of our Nativity.

We were sometimes wise to pull down, but We now want art to build; We were ingenious to pluck up, but We have no skil to plant; We were strong to destroy, but We are weak to restore: whither shall We go for help? or to whom shall We address our selves for relief? if We say, We will have recourse to Parliaments, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> They shall save Us; behold, They are broken Reeds, Reeds shaken with the wind, They cannot save Themselves. If We turn to the Army, and say, They are bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh, it may be They will, at last, have pity upon us, and deliver Us; behold, They are become as a rod of Iron to bruise Us, rather than a Staff of strength to support us. If We go to him who had treacherously usurped, and does Tyrannically exercise an unjust Power over Us, and say to him, free us from this Yoke, for it oppresseth Us, and from these burthens, for they are heavier than either We are, or our Fathers ever were, able to bear; behold, in the pride and haughtiness of his spirit, he answers us, you are factious, you <MILESTONE N="30"/> are factious; if your burthens are heavy, I will make them yet heavier; if I have hitherto chastised you with whips, I will henceforward chastise” you with Scorpions.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“WE must confess (for We come not to deceive your Majesty, but to speak the truth in simplicity) that these cowardly Apprehensions did, for a while, make some strong impressions upon Us; and had allmost frighted Us out of our newly conceiv'd thoughts of Duty and Loyalty.

<P><Q>“The earnest desires of the Subscribers, in all humility presented to your <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Proposi∣tions annexed to it:</NOTE> Majesty in these following Proposals, in order to an happy, speedy,” <MILESTONE N="30"/> and well grounded Peace in these your Majesty's Dominions.</Q></P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>“FORASMUCH as the Parliament, call'd and conven'd by the au∣thority of his late Majesty your Royal Father, in the year 1640, was ne∣ver legally dissolv'd, but did continue their fitting until the year 1648, at which time the Army, violently and treasonably breaking in upon them, did, and has ever since given a continued Interruption to their Session, by taking away the whole House of Lords, and secluding the greatest part of the House of Commons, it is therefore humbly desired that (to the end We may be establish'd upon the ancient basis and foun∣dation of Law) your Majesty would be pleased, by publick Proclama∣tions, <MILESTONE N="40"/> assoon as it shall be judged seasonable, to invite all those Persons, as well Lords as Commons, who were then sitting, to return to their places; and that your Majesty would own them (so conven'd and met together)” to be the true and lawful Parliament of <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>“THAT your Majesty would concur with the Parliament in the ra∣tification and confirmation of all those things granted, and agreed unto by the late King your Father, at the last and fatal Treaty in the Isle of <HI>Wight;</HI> as also in the making, and repealing of all such Laws, Acts, and Statutes, as by the Parliament shall be judged expedient and necessary to be made, and repealed, for the better securing of the just and natural <MILESTONE N="50"/> Rights and Liberties of the People, and for the obviating, and preventing” all dangerous and destructive excesses of Government for the future.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>“FORASMUCH as it cannot be denied, but that our Lord and Sa∣viour Jesus Christ, by his death and resurrection, has purchased the Li∣berties
<PB N="495" REF="5070"/>
of his own People, and is thereby become their sole Lord and King, to whom, and to whom only, they owe obedience in things Spiri∣tual; We do therefore humbly beseech your Majesty, that you would engage your Royal Word never to erect, nor suffer to be erected, any such Tyrannical, Popish, and Antichristian Hierarchy (Episcopal, Pres∣byterian, or by what name soever it be call'd) as shall assume a power over, or impose a yoke upon, the Consciences of others; but that every one of your Majesty's Subjects may hereafter be left at liberty to worship God in such a way, form, and manner, as shall appear to them to be agreeable <MILESTONE N="10"/> to the mind and will of Christ, revealed in his word, according to that” proportion, or measure of faith and knowledge which they have received.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. <Q>“FORASMUCH as the Exaction of Tithes is a burthen under which the whole Nation groans in general, and the people of God in particular, We would therefore crave leave humbly to offer it to your Majesty's consideration, that, if it be possible, some other way may be found out for the maintainance of that which is call'd the National Ministry; and that those of the separated and congregated Churches may not (as h∣therto they have been, and still are) be compell'd to contribute there∣unto.”</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. <Q>“FORASMUCH as in these times of Licence, Confusion, and Disor∣der, <MILESTONE N="20"/> many honest, godly, and religious Persons, by the crafty devices and cunning pretences of wicked Men, have been ignorantly, and blindly led, either into the commission of, or compliance with many vile, ille∣gal, and abominable Actions, whereof they are now ashamed, We do therefore most humbly implore your Majesty, that an Act of amnesty and oblivion may be granted for the pardoning, acquitting, and dis∣charging, all your Majesty's long deceiv'd, and deluded Subjects, from the guilt and imputation of all Crimes, Treasons, and Offences whatsoe∣ver, committed or done by them, or any of them, either against your <MILESTONE N="30"/> Majesty's Father, or your Self, since the beginning of these unhappy Wars, excepting only such who do adhere to that ugly Tyrant who calls himself Protector, or who, in justification of His, or any other Interest, shall, after the publication of this Act of Grace, continue and persevere” in their disloyalty to your Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>THE Gentleman who brought this Address, and these wild Proposi∣tions, brought likewise with him a particular Letter to the King from the Gentleman that is before described; upon whose temper, ingenuity, and interest, the Messenger principally depended, having had much acquain∣tance and conversation with him; who, though he was an Anabaptist, made <MILESTONE N="40"/> himself merry with the extravagancy and madness of his Companions; <Q>and told this Gentleman, “that, though the first Address could not be pre∣pared but with those Demands, which might satisfy the whole Party, and comprehend all that was desired by any of them, yet if the King gave them such an encouragement, as might dispose them to send some of the wisest of them to attend his Majesty, he would be able, upon con∣ference with them, to make them his Instruments to reduce the rest to more moderate desires, when they should discern, that they might have more protection and security from the King, than from any other power” that would assume the Government.</Q> The Letter was as followeth.</P>

<P><Q>“TIME, the great discoverer of all things, has at last unmask'd the dis∣guised <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> designs of this mysterious Age, and made that obvious to the dull sense of Fools, which was before visible enough to the quick-sighted pru∣dence
<PB N="496" REF="5080"/>
of wise Men, <HI>viz.</HI> that Liberty, Religion, and Reformation, the wonted Engines of Politicians, are but deceitful baits, by which the easily deluded Multitude are tempted to a greedy pursuit of their own ruin. In the unhappy number of these Fools, I must confess my self to have been one; who have nothing more now to boast of, but only that, as I was not the first was cheated, so I was not the last was undeceiv'd; having long since, by peeping a little (now and then, as I had opportu∣nity) under the vizzard of the Impostor, got such glimpses, though but imperfect ones, of his ugly face, conceal'd under the painted pretences of Sanctity, as made me conclude, that the series of Affairs, and the re∣volution <MILESTONE N="10"/> of a few years, would convince this blinded Generation of their Errors; and make them affrightedly to start from Him, as a prodigious piece of deformity, whom they adored and reverenced as the beauti∣ful” Image of a Deity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“NOR did this my expectation fail me: God, who glories in no Attri∣bute more than to be acknowledged the Searcher of the inward parts, could no longer endure the bold Affronts of this audacious Hypocrite; but, to the astonishment and confusion of all his Idolatrous worshippers, has, by the unsearchable wisdom of his deep laid Counsels, lighted such a Candle into the dark Dungeon of his Soul, that there is none so blind <MILESTONE N="20"/> who does not plainly read Treachery, Tyranny, Perfidiousness, Dissimu∣lation, Atheism, Hypocrisy, and all manner of Villany, written in large Characters on his heart; nor is there any one remaining, who dares open his mouth in justification of him, for fear of incurring the deserved Character of being a professed Advocate for all wickedness, and a sworn” Enemy to all Virtue.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“THIS was no sooner brought forth, but presently I conceived hopes of being able, in a short time, to put in practice those thoughts of Loyal∣ty to your Majesty, which had long had entertainment in my breast, but till now were forced to seek concealment under a seeming conformity to <MILESTONE N="30"/> the iniquity of the Times. A fit opportunity of giving birth to these de∣signs,” was happily administer'd by the following occasion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“GREAT was the rage, and just the indignation of the People, when they first found the Authority of their Parliament swallow'd up in the new Name of a Protector; greater was their fury, and upon better grounds, when they observed that, under the silent, modest, and flatter∣ing Title of this Protector, was secretly assumed a Power more absolute, more arbitrary, more unlimited, than ever was pretended to by any King. The Pulpits streightways sound with Declamations, the Streets are fill'd with Pasquils and Libels, every one expresses a detestation of <MILESTONE N="40"/> this Innovation by publick Invectives, and all the Nation, with one ac∣cord, seems at once to be inspired with one and the same resolution of endeavouring valiantly to redeem that Liberty, by armes and force,” which was treacherously stoln from them by deceit and fraud.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“WHEN they had for a while exercised themselves in tumultuary dis∣courses (the first effects of Popular discontents) at length they begin to contrive by what means to free themselves from the yoke that is upon them. In order hereunto, several of the chiefest of the Male∣contents enter into consultations amongst themselves; to which they were pleased to invite and admit Me. Being taken into their Coun∣cils, <MILESTONE N="50"/> and made privy to their Debates, I thought it my work to ac∣quaint my self fully with the tempers, inclinations, dispositions, and principles of them; which (though all meeting and concentring in an irreconcilable hatred and animosity against the usurper) I find so va∣rious
<PB N="497" REF="5090"/>
in their ends, and so contrary in the means conducing to those ends, that they do naturally fall under the distinction of different Par∣ties. Some, drunk with Enthusiasmes, and besotted with Phanatick no∣tions, do allow of none to have a share in Government besides the Saints; and these are called <HI>Christian Royalists,</HI> or <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-Men;</HI> others violently opposing This, as destructive to the Liberty of the free-born People, strongly contend to have the Nation govern'd by a continual Succession of Parliaments, consisting of equal Representatives; and these style themselves <HI>Common-wealths-Men.</HI> A third Party there is, who <MILESTONE N="10"/> finding, by the observation of these times, that Parliaments are better Physick than food, seem to incline most to Monarchy, if laid under such restrictions as might free the People from the fear of Tyranny; and these are contented to suffer under the opprobrious Name of <HI>Levellers;</HI> to these did I particularly apply my self; and after some few days confe∣rence with them in private by themselves apart, I was so happy in my endeavours, as to prevail with some of them to lay aside those vain and idle prejudices, grounded rather upon passion than judgement, and re∣turn, as their duty engaged them, to their obedience to your Majesty. Having proceeded thus far, and gained as many of the chief of them, <MILESTONE N="20"/> whom I knew to be Leaders of the rest, as could safely be intrusted with a business of this nature (the success whereof does principally de∣pend upon the secret management of it) I thought I had nothing more now to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but only to confirm and establish them, as well as I could, in their infa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Allegiance, by engaging them so far in an humble Address unto your Majesty, that they might not know how to make either a” sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or honourable Retreat.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I must leave it to the Ingenuity of this worthy Gentleman, by whose hands it is convey'd, to make answer to any such objections as may per∣haps be made by your Majesty, either as to the matter or manner of it. <MILESTONE N="30"/> This only I would put your Majesty in mind of, that they are but young Proselytes, and are to be driven <HI>lento pede,</HI> lest, being urged at first too” violently, they should resist the more refractorily.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“AS to the Quality of the Persons, I cannot say they are either of great Families, or great Estates. But this I am confident of, that, whether it be by their own virtue, or by the misfortune of the times, I will not de∣termine, they are such who may be more serviceable to your Majesty in this conjuncture, than those whose Names swell much bigger than Theirs with the Addition of great Titles. I durst not undertake to per∣swade your Majesty to any thing, being ignorant by what Maxims your <MILESTONE N="40"/> Counsels are govern'd; but this I shall crave leave to say, that I have often observ'd, that a desperate game at Chess has been recover'd after the loss of the Nobility, only by playing the pawns well; and that the Subscribers may not be of the same use to your Majesty, if well managed, I cannot despair, especially at such a time as this, when there is scarce any thing but pawns left upon the board, and those few others that are lest, may justly be complain'd of in the words of <HI>Tacitus, proesentia &amp;” <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uta, quàm vetera, &amp; periculosa, malunt omnes.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“I have many things more to offer unto your Majesty, but fearing I have already given too bold a trouble, I shall defer the mention of them <MILESTONE N="50"/> at present; intending, assoon as I hear how your Majesty resents this Overture, to wait upon your Majesty in Person, and then to commu∣nicate that <HI>viva voce,</HI> which I cannot bring within the narrow compass of an Address of this nature. In the mean time, if our Services shall be judged useful to your Majesty, I shall humbly desire some speedy course

may be taken for the Advance of 2000 pound, as well for the answering the expectation of those whom I have already engaged, as for the defray∣ing of several other necessary expences, which do, and will every day” inevitably come upon us in the prosecution of our design.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“WHAT more is expedient to be done by your Majesty, in order to the encouragement and satisfaction of those Gentlemen who already are, or hereafter may be, brought over to the assistance of your Majesty's Cause and Interest, I shall commit to the care of this honourable Person; who being no stranger to the complection, and constitution of those with whom I have to deal, is able sufficiently to inform your Majesty by what <MILESTONE N="10"/> ways and means they may be laid under the strongest obligations to your” Majesty's Service.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“FOR my own part, as I do now aim at nothing more, than only to give your Majesty a small essay of my zeal for, and absolute devotion to your Majesty, so I have nothing more to beg of your Majesty, but that” you would be pleased to account me,</Q></P>

<P>THE King believ'd that these distempers might, in some conjuncture, be of use to him; and therefore return'd the general Answer that is men∣tioned <MILESTONE N="20"/> before; <Q>and “that he would be willing to confer with some Per∣sons” of that Party, trusted by the rest, if they would come over to him;</Q> his Majesty being then at <HI>Bruges:</HI> upon which that young Gentleman came over thither to him, and remain'd some days there conceal'd. He was a Person of very extraordinary parts, sharpness of Wit, readiness and volubility of Tongue, but an Anabaptist. He had been bred in the University of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and afterwards in the Inns of Court; but being too young to have known the Religion, or the Government of the precedent time, and his Father having been engaged from the be∣ginning against the King, he had sucked in the opinions that were most <MILESTONE N="30"/> prevalent, and had been a Soldier in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Life Guard of Horse, when he was thought to be most resolved to establish a Republick. But when that Mask was pulled off, he detested him with that rage, that he was of the combination with those who resolved to destroy him by what way soever; and was very intimate with <HI>Syndercome.</HI> He had a great confidence of the strength and power of that Party; and confessed that their demands were extravagant, and such as the King could not grant; which, after they were once engaged in blood, he doubted not they would recede from, by the credit the Wiser Men had amonst them. He return'd into <HI>England</HI> very well satisfied with the King; and did afterwards cor∣respond <MILESTONE N="40"/> very faithfully with his professions; but left the King without any hope of other benefit from that Party, than by their encreasing the faction and animosity against <HI>Cromwell:</HI> for it was manifest they expected a good Sun of present Money from the King; which could not be in his power to supply.</P>
<P>WHILE these things were transacting, the King found every day, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> so much despaired of his Cause, that they had no mind to give him any Assistance with which he might make an attempt upon <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> and that, if they had been never so well disposed, they were not able to do it: and therefore he resolv'd that he would not, in a Country that was <MILESTONE N="50"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King sent to</HI> Don Juan <Q><HI>“that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would ac∣company him into the” <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI></Q></NOTE> so great a Scene of War, live unactive and unconcern'd: so his Majesty sent to <HI>Don Juan,</HI> <Q>“that he would accompany him in the Field the next Cam∣pagne,” without expecting any Ceremony, or putting him to any trouble.</Q> But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sent him a formal Message, and employed the Earl of
<PB N="499" REF="5110"/>
<HI>Bristol</HI> to excuse them from consenting, or admitting his Proposition, and to disswade his Majesty from affecting so unreasonably exposing his Person. <Q>They said, “that they could not answer it to his Catholick Maje∣sty, if they should permit his Majesty, when his two Brothers were alrea∣dy in the Army, and known to affect danger so much as they did, like∣wise to engage his own Royal Person; which they positively protested” against.</Q> And when they afterwards saw, that it was not in their power to restrain him from such Adventures, whilst he remain'd at <HI>Bruges,</HI> which was now become a Frontier by the Neighbourhood of <HI>Mardike,</HI> and par∣ticularly that, under pretence of visiting the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who lay then at <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to make some attempt in the Winter upon that Fort, his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King pre∣sent in the at∣tempt upon</HI> Mardike.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"/> Majesty having notice, what night they intended to assault it, went some days before to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and was present in that Action, and so near that many were kill'd about him, and the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who was next to him, had his Horse kill'd under him: they were willing his Majesty should remove to <HI>Brussels;</HI> which they would never before consent to; and which was in many respects most grateful to him. And so, towards the Spring, and before the Armies were in motion, he left <HI>Bruges,</HI> where he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King leaves</HI> Bruges, <HI>and remove, to</HI> Brussel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>in the end of</HI> Feb. 1658.</NOTE> had receiv'd, both from the Bishop and the Magistrates, all possible re∣spect, there being at that time a <HI>Spaniard, Mark Ogniate,</HI> Burgo-Master, who, being born of an <HI>English</HI> Mother, had all imaginable duty for the <MILESTONE N="20"/> King, and being a Man of excellent parts, and very dextrous in business, was very serviceable to his Majesty; which he ever afterwards acknow∣ledged; and about the end of <HI>February,</HI> in the year by that Account 1658, he went to <HI>Brussels,</HI> and never after return'd to <HI>Bruges</HI> to reside there.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty was no sooner come thither, but <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> renew'd his advices, and importunity, that he would make a conjunction with the Levellers. He had formerly prevailed with him to admit their Agent, one <HI>Sexby,</HI> to confer with him; which his Majesty willingly consented to, presuming that <HI>Sexby</HI> might be privy to the Address that had been <MILESTONE N="30"/> made to him by the same Party; which he was not, though they that sent the Address well knew of his employment to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and had no mind to trust him to the King, at least not so soon. The Man, for an illi∣terate <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of</HI> Sexby <HI>and his Negotia∣tion.</HI></NOTE> Person, spoke very well, and properly; and used those words very well, the true meaning and signification whereof he could not understand. He had been, in the beginning, a Common Soldier of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Troops, and was afterwards one of those Agitators who were made use of to con∣trole the Parliament; and had so great an Interest in <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that he was frequently his Bed-fellow; a familiarity, he often admitted those to whom he employed in any great Trust, and with whom he could not so <MILESTONE N="40"/> freely converse, as in those hours. He was very perfect in the History of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s dissimulations, and would describe his Artifices to the life, and did very well understand the temper of the Army, and very much under∣value the credit, and interest of the King's Party; and made such demands to the King, as if it were in his power, and his alone, to restore him; in which <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> concurr'd so totally, that, when he saw that the King would not be advised by him, he sent his Friend <HI>Sexby</HI> into <HI>Spain</HI> to con∣clude there; and, upon the matter, wholely withdrew himself from so much as visiting the King. And there need not be any other Character or description of the Stupidity of that <HI>Spaniard,</HI> than that such a fellow, <MILESTONE N="50"/> with the help of an <HI>Irish</HI> Priest, should be able to cozen him, and make him to cozen his Master of ten thousand Pistoles; for he receiv'd not less than that in <HI>Flanders,</HI> whatever else he got by his journey to <HI>Madrid;</HI> which did not use to be of small expence to that Court.</P>

NOTHING that was yet to come, could be more manifest, than it was to all discerning Men, that the first design the <HI>French</HI> Army would under∣take, when they should begin their Campagne, must be the Siege of <HI>Dun∣kirk;</HI> without taking which, <HI>Mardike</HI> would do them little good: be∣sides, their Contract with <HI>Cromwell</HI> was no Secret; yet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to∣tally neglected making provisions to defend it; being perswaded by some Intelligence they allways purchased at a great rate, to deceive them∣selves, that the <HI>French</HI> would begin the Campagne with besieging <HI>Cam∣bray.</HI> In the beginning of the year, the Marquis <HI>de Leyde,</HI> Governour <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis</HI> de Leyde <HI>came to</HI> Brussels to <HI>sollicite for supplies for</HI> Dunkirk, <HI>but in vain.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and the best Officer they had, in all respects, came to <HI>Brussels,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> having sent several Expresses thither to no purpose to sollicite for sup∣plies. <Q>He told them, “that his Intelligence was infallible, that Marshal <HI>Turenne</HI> was ready to march, and that the <HI>French</HI> King himself would be in the field to countenance the Siege of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> which he could not defend, if he were not supplied with Men, Ammunition, and Vi∣ctual;”</Q> of all which he stood in great need, and of neither of which he could get supply; <Q>They telling him, “that he would not be besieged;” that they were sure the <HI>French</HI> meant to attempt <HI>Cambray;</HI></Q> <Q>which they provided the best they could; and bid him be confident, “that, if he were attacked, they would relieve him with their Army, and fight a Battle” <MILESTONE N="20"/> before he should be in danger.</Q> Being able to procure no other Answer, he return'd, and came to take his leave of the King as he went out of the Town, and complain'd very much to his Majesty of their Counsels, and deluding themselves with false Intelligence. <Q>He said, “he was going to defend a Town without Men, without Ammunition, and without Vi∣ctual, against a very strong and triumphant Army; that, if he could have obtain'd Supplies in any reasonable degree, he should have been able to have entertain'd them some time; but in the condition he was” in, he could only lose his life there;</Q> which he was resolv'd to do: and spoke as if he were very willing to do it; and was as good as his word. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>WITHIN three or four days after his return, the <HI>French</HI> Army ap∣pear'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunkirk <HI>be∣sieged by the</HI> French <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> before <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> and then the <HI>Spaniard</HI> believ'd it; and made what hast they could to draw their Army together, which was very much dispersed, so that, before they were upon their march, the <HI>French</HI> had perfected their Circumvallation, and render'd it impossible to put any Succours into the Town. Now they sound it necessary indeed to hazard a Battle, which they had promised to do, when they intended nothing less. When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had taken a full view of the posture the Enemy was in, and were thereupon to choose their own ground, upon which they would be found, <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Carracena,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="40"/> agreed in nothing else, resolv'd how the Army should be ranged; which the Prince of <HI>Condè</HI> disswaded them from; and told them very exactly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince of</HI> Conde<HI>'s Ad∣vice to the</HI> Spaniards <HI>not hearken'd to.</HI></NOTE> what the Marshal <HI>Turenne</HI> would do in that case; <Q>“and that he would still maintain the Siege, and give them likewise Battle upon the advan∣tage of the ground; whereas, if they would place their Army near an∣other part of the Line, they should easily have communication with the” Town, and compel the <HI>French</HI> to sight with more equal hazards.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT might very reasonably be said of the Prince of <HI>Condè</HI> and Marshal <HI>Turenne,</HI> what a good Roman Historian said heretofore of <HI>Jugurtha</HI> and <HI>Marius,</HI> that <HI>“in iisdem castr is didicere, quae postea in contrariis fecere;</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/> They had in the same Armies learn'd that Discipline, and those Strata∣gems, which they afterwards practiced against each other in Enemy” Armies;</Q> and it was a wonderful, and a pleasant thing to see and observe in Attacks or in Marches, with what foresight either of them would
<PB N="501" REF="5130"/>
declare what the other would do: <Q>as the Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> when the Ar∣mies march'd near, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would not alter their formal lazy pace, nor their rest at noon, would in choler tell them, “if we do not make” great hast to possess such a Pass (which they never thought of)</Q> <Q>“Marshal” <HI>Turenne</HI> will take it, though it be much farther from him;</Q> and would then, when they consider'd not what he said, advance with his own Troops to possess the place, even when the <HI>French</HI> were come in view; and by such seasonable foresights saved the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army from many distresses. And Marshal <HI>Turenne</HI> had the same caution, and govern'd himself ac∣cording <MILESTONE N="10"/> as the Prince of <HI>Condè</HI> was in the Rere or Van of the Army; and, upon the matter, only consider'd where He was, and order'd his Marches accordingly: of which there was a very memorable Instance two years before, when the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army had besieged <HI>Arras,</HI> and when the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was present with Marshal <HI>Turenne.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had made themselves so very strong, that when the <HI>French</HI> Army came thither, they found that they could not compel them to fight, and that the Town must be lost if they did not force the Line. Marshal <HI>Turenne,</HI> accompa∣nied with the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who would never be absent upon those occa∣sions, and some of the principal Officers, spent two or three days in view∣ing <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Line round, and observing and informing himself of all that was to be known, and riding so near the Line very frequently, that some of his Company were kill'd within much less than Musquet shot. <Q>In the end, he called some of the principal Officers, and said, “he would, that” day at noon, assault the Line, at a place which he shew'd to them;</Q> <Q>which the Officers wonder'd at; and said, “it was the strongest part of the Line; and that they had observ'd to him, that the whole Line on the other” side was very much weaker;</Q> <Q>to which the Marshal replied, “you do not know who keeps that Line; We shall do no good there; <HI>Monsieur le Prince</HI> never sleeps, and that is His Post; but I will tell you, what” <MILESTONE N="30"/> will fall out on the other side;</Q> for he had himself marched in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army, and very well understood the Customs of it. <Q>He told them then, “that it would be very long, before the Soldiers upon the Line, or the adjacent Guard, would believe that the <HI>French</HI> were in earnest, and that they would in truth at that time of day assault them; but would think, that they meant only to give them an Alarm, which they were never warm in receiving: that when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were convinced that the <HI>French</HI> were in earnest, in which time he should be got near their Line, they would send to the Count of <HI>Fuensaldagna,</HI> who at that time of day was usually asleep, and his Servants would not be perswaded to <MILESTONE N="40"/> waken him in a Moment: He would then send for his Horse, and ride up to the Line; which when he saw, he would with some hast repair to the Arch-Duke's Tent; who was likewise at his <HI>Siesto,</HI> and when He” was awake, they would consult what was to be done;</Q> <Q>by which time, the Marshal said, “”They should have done:</Q> And they did enter the Line accordingly, and found by the Prisoners, that every thing had fallen out as he had foretold. So the Siege was raised, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fled without making any resistance, left their Cannon, Bag and Baggage, behind them: only the Prince of <HI>Condè</HI> was in so good order upon the first Alarm, that when he heard of the confusion they were in, he drew off with his Can∣non, <MILESTONE N="50"/> and lost nothing that belonged to him, and marched with all his Men to a place of safety.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the advice which the Prince of <HI>Condè</HI> had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battle of</HI> Dunkirk</NOTE> given, <HI>Don Juan</HI> was positive in his first Resolution. The Prince, not without great indignation, consented; and drew up his Troops in the
<PB N="502" REF="5140"/>
place they desired; and quickly saw all come to pass that he had foretold. The Country was most inclosed, so that the Horse could not fight but in small Bodies. The <HI>English</HI> Foot under <HI>Lockhart</HI> charged the <HI>Spanish</HI> Foot, and, after a good resistance, broke and routed them; after which there was not much more resistance on that side, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse doing no better than their Foot. Our King's Foot were placed by themselves upon a little rising ground, and were charged by the <HI>French</HI> Horse after the <HI>Spanish</HI> Foot were beaten. Some of them, and the greater part, march'd off by the favour of the Inclosures, there not being above two hundred taken Prisoners. The Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Glocester</HI> charged several times <MILESTONE N="10"/> on Horse-back; and in the end, having gotten some Troops to go with them, charged the <HI>English</HI> (whom, though Enemies, they were glad to see behave themselves so well) and with great difficulty, and some blows of Musquets, got safe off. But there was a rumour spread in the <HI>French</HI> Ar∣my, that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was taken Prisoner by the <HI>English,</HI> some Men undertaking to say that they saw him in their hands: whereupon many of the <HI>French</HI> Officers, and Gentlemen, resolv'd to set him at Liberty, and rode up to the Body of <HI>English,</HI> and look'd upon all their Prisoners, and found they were misinform'd; which if they had not been, they would undoubtedly, at any hazard or danger, have enlarged him; so great an af∣fection <MILESTONE N="20"/> that Nation own'd to have for his Highness.</P>
<P>THE day being thus lost with a greater Rout and Confusion than loss of Men, <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Carracena,</HI> who behaved them∣selves in their own Persons with courage enough, were contented to think better of the Prince of <HI>Condè</HI>'s advice, by which they preserv'd the best part of the Army, and retired to <HI>Ipres</HI> and <HI>Furnes,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Don Juan <HI>af∣ter the loss of the Battle re∣tires to</HI> Ipres.</NOTE> to <HI>Newport,</HI> that they might defend the rest when <HI>Dunkirk</HI> should be taken; which was the present business of Marshal <HI>Turenne;</HI> who found the Marquis <HI>de Leyde</HI> resolv'd to defend it, notwithstanding the defeat of the Army: and therefore he betook himself again to that work, assoon as <MILESTONE N="30"/> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army was retired into fastness. The Marquis <HI>de Leyde,</HI> when <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis</HI> de Leyde <HI>sal∣lus upon the Enemy; is re∣pulsed, and slain.</HI></NOTE> he saw there was no more hope of relief from <HI>Don Juan,</HI> which whilst he expected, he was wary in the hazard of his Men, was now resolv'd to try what he could do for himself: so with as strong a Party as he could make, he made a desperate Sally upon the Enemy; who, though he disorder'd them, were quickly so seconded, that they drove him back into the Town with great loss, after himself had receiv'd a wound, of which he died with∣in three days after. And then the Officers sent to treat, which he would not consent to whilst he liv'd. The Marquis was a much greater loss than the Town; which the Master of the Field may be allways Master of in two <MILESTONE N="40"/> Months time at most. But in truth the death of the Marquis was an irre∣parable damage, he being a very wise Man, of great experience, great wisdom, and great piety, after his way; insomuch as he had an Intention to have taken Orders in the Church; to which he was most devoted.</P>
<P>THOSE in the Town had fair conditions to march to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Omers,</HI> that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Town of</HI> Dunkirk <HI>sur∣render'd, and the</HI> French <HI>King delivers it to the</HI> Eng∣lish</NOTE> they might not joyn with the Reliques of their Army. The <HI>French</HI> King being by this time come to the Camp with the Cardinal, enter'd the Town, and took possession of it himself; which assoon as he had done, he deli∣ver'd it into the hands of <HI>Lockhart,</HI> whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> had made Governour of it. Thus the Treaty was perform'd between them; and that King went <MILESTONE N="50"/> presently to <HI>Calais,</HI> and from thence sent the Duke of <HI>Crequy</HI> together with <HI>Mancini,</HI> Nephew to the Cardinal, to <HI>London</HI> to visit <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who likewise sent his Son in Law, the Lord <HI>Falconbridge,</HI> to <HI>Calais,</HI> to congratulate with that King for their joynt prosperity. And mutual
<PB N="503" REF="5150"/>
professions were then renewed between them, <Q>with new obligations “ne∣ver” to make Peace without each other's consent.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Don Juan</HI> had first remov'd from <HI>Brussels,</HI> and the Army marched into the field, the King had renew'd his desire that he might likewise go with them, but was refused with the same positiveness he had been before. His Majesty thereupon resolved that he would not stay alone in <HI>Brussels,</HI> whilst all the world was in Action; but thought of some more private place, where he might take the Summer Air, and refresh him∣self during that season. He was the more confirm'd in this upon the News <MILESTONE N="10"/> of the defeat of the Army near <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and the loss of that place. So he remov'd to a Village call'd <HI>Hochstraten;</HI> where there were very good Houses, capable to have receiv'd a greater Train than belong'd to His <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣tires to</HI> Hoch∣straten <HI>in</HI> Aug</NOTE> Court. Thither the King went about the Month of <HI>August;</HI> the village lving upon the skirts of the States Dominions in <HI>Brabant,</HI> and within five or six miles of <HI>Breda,</HI> sometimes he made journies, <HI>incognito,</HI> to see places where he not been before.</P>
<P>THERE a Man might have observ'd the great difference of the con∣dition, which the Subjects in the States Dominions, even in the sight and view of the other, enjoy above what their Neighbours of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ter∣ritories <MILESTONE N="20"/> are acquainted with. <HI>Hochstraten</HI> is an open Village, belonging to the Count of that name, and hath enjoy'd very ample Privileges, the Owner thereof being one of the greatest Nobles in the Duchy of <HI>Brabant.</HI> It is pleasantly seated, many very good Houses, and the Mannor large of Extent, and of great Revenue. But by reason that it is allways a Horse∣quarter in the Winter Season, who use great licence, it is so poor, that those good Houses have only Walls; so that the People had not furniture to sup∣ply those rooms which were for the accommodation of those who at∣tended the King, though they were sure to be very well paid, and there∣fore used all the means they could to procure it. But there appear'd po∣verty <MILESTONE N="30"/> in the faces and looks of the People, good grounds without any stock, and, in a word, nothing that looked well but the Houses, and those empty within: on the other side of a Line that is drawn (for a Man may set one foot in the Dominion that is reserved to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the other in that which is assign'd to the <HI>Hollander)</HI> the Houses, though not stand∣ing so thick, nor so beautiful without, clean, neat; and well furnish'd within; very good Linen, and some plate in every House; the People jolly, well cloathed, and with looks very well pleased; all the Grounds and Land fully stocked with all kind of Cattle, and, as if it were the Land of <HI>Goshen,</HI> the appearance of nothing but wealth, and fertility, encom∣passed <MILESTONE N="40"/> with extreme barrenness, and unconceivable Poverty. And they on the <HI>Holland</HI> side, that lies equally open, and undefended, can see the <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops exercise all Licence upon their poor Neighbours of <HI>Hoch∣straten;</HI> and yet the most dissolute among them dare not step into Their Quarters to take a Hen, or commit the least trespass: so strickly the Ar∣ticles of the Peace are observed.</P>
<P>WHILST the King spent his time in this manner, about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who remained still with the Troops at <HI>Newport</HI> to defend that place, as <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and the rest, remained about <HI>Furnes</HI> and <HI>Bruges,</HI> sent an Express to the King to let him know, <Q>“that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King has notice that</HI> Cromwell <HI>was dead.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Letters from <HI>England,</HI> and some Passengers, reported confident∣ly” that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was dead;</Q> which, there having been no News of his sickness, was not at first easily believed. But every day brought confirma∣tion of it; so that his Majesty thought sit to give over his Country Life, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣turns to</HI> Brus∣sels <HI>upon it.</HI></NOTE> and return'd again to <HI>Brussels,</HI> that he might be ready to make use of any
<PB N="504" REF="5160"/>
advantage, which, in that conjuncture, upon so great an alteration, he might reasonably expect.</P>
<P>IT had been observ'd in <HI>England,</HI> that, though from the dissolution of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell<HI>'s Affairs some before his death.</HI></NOTE> the last Parliament, all things seem'd to succeed, at home and abroad, to the Protector's wish, and his power and greatness to be better establish'd than ever it had been, yet he never had the same serenity of mind he had been used to, after he had refused the Crown; but was out of countenance, and chagrin, as if he were conscious of not having been true to himself; and much more apprehensive of danger to his Person than he had used to be. Insomuch as he was not easy of access, nor so much seen abroad; and <MILESTONE N="10"/> seem'd to be in some disorder, when his Eyes found any stranger in the room; upon whom they were still fixed. When He intended to go to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, which was his principal delight and diversion, it was ne∣ver known, till he was in the Coach, which way he would go; and he was still hem'd in by his Guards both before and behind; and the Coach in which he went, was allways thronged as full as it could be, with his Ser∣vants; who were armed; and he seldom returned the same way he went; and rarely lodged two Nights together in one Chamber, but had many furnished and prepared, to which his own Key convey'd him and those he would have with him, when he had a mind to go to bed: which made his <MILESTONE N="20"/> fears the more taken notice of, and publick, because he had never been ac∣custom'd to those precautions.</P>
<P>IT is very true, he knew of many combinations to assassinate him, by those who, he believed, wish'd the King no good. And a good while before this, when he had discover'd the design of <HI>Syndercome,</HI> who was a very <NOTE PLACE="marg">Syndercome<HI>'s design against him a good while before this.</HI></NOTE> stout Man, and one who had been much in his favour, and who had twice or thrice, by wonderful and unexpected Accidents, been disappointed in the minute he made sure to kill him, and had caused him to be appre∣hended, his behaviour was so resolute in his Examination and Trial, as if he thought he should still be able to do it; and it was manifest that he <MILESTONE N="30"/> had many more Associates, who were undiscover'd and as resolute as him∣self; and though he had got him condemn'd to die, the Fellow's carriage and words were such, as if he knew well how to avoid the Judgement; which made <HI>Cromwell</HI> believe, that a Party in the Army would attempt his rescue; <Q>whereupon he gave strict charge, “that he should be carefully looked to in the Tower, and three or four of the Guard allways with” him day and night.</Q></P>
<P>AT the day appointed for his Execution, those Troops <HI>Cromwell</HI> was most confident of, were placed upon the Tower Hill, where the Gallowes were erected. But when the Guard call'd <HI>Syndercome</HI> to arise in the mor∣ning, <MILESTONE N="40"/> they found him dead in his bed; which gave trouble exceedingly to <HI>Cromwell;</HI> for besides that he hoped, that, at his death, to avoid the ut∣most rigour of it, he would have confessed many of his Consederates, he now found himself under the reproach of having caused him to be poy∣soned, as not daring to bring him to publick Justice: nor could he suppress that Scandal. It appear'd upon Examination, that the night before, when he was going to bed in the presence of his Guard, his Sister came to take her leave of him; <Q>and upon her going away, he put off his Cloaths, and leaped into his Bed, and said, “”this was the last Bed he should ever go into.</Q> His Body was drawn by a Horse to the Gallowes where he should have hanged, <MILESTONE N="50"/> and buried under it, with a Stake driven through him, as is usual in the Case of self Murtherers: yet this Accident perplexed <HI>Cromwell</HI> very much; and though he was without the particular discovery which he expected, he made a general discovery by it, that he himself was more odious in his Army than he believed he had been.</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="5170"/>
HE seem'd to be much afflicted at the death of his friend the Earl of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of the Earl of</HI> Warwick, <HI>and of the Earl's Grandson.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Warwick;</HI> with whom he had a fast friendship; though neither their humours, nor their natures, were like. And the Heir of that House, who had married his youngest Daughter, died about the same time; so that all his relation to, or confidence in that Family was at an end; the other Branches of it abhorring his Alliance. His Domestic delights were lessen'd every day: he plainly discover'd that his Son <HI>Falconbridge</HI>'s heart was set upon an Interest destructive to his, and grew to hate him perfectly. But that which chiefly broke his peace, was the death of his Daughter <HI>Claypole;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of</HI> Cromwell<HI>'s Daughter</HI> Claypole</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"/> who had been allways his greatest joy, and who, in her sickness, which was of a nature the Physicians knew not how to deal with, had several con∣ferences with him, which exceedingly perplexed him. Though no body was near enough to hear the particulars, yet her often mentioning, in the pains she endured, the blood her Father had spilt, made People conclude, that she had presented his worst Actions to his consideration. And though he never made the least shew of remorse for any of those Actions, it is very certain, that either what she said, or her death, affected him wonder∣fully.</P>
<P>WHATEVER it was, about the middle of <HI>August,</HI> he was seised on by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>seised on by an Ague in</HI> Au∣gust</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"/> a common tertian Ague, from which, he believed, a little ease and di∣vertisement at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court would have freed him. But the fits grew stronger, and his Spirits much abated: so that he return'd again to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> when his Physicians began to think him in danger, though the Preachers, who prayed allways about him, and told God Almighty what great things he had done for him, and how much more need he had still of his service, declared as from God, that he should recover: and he him∣self was of the same mind, and did not think he should die, till even the time that his Spirits fail'd him. <Q>Then he declared to them, “that he” <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He appoints his Son</HI> Ri∣chard <HI>his Suc∣cessor; and ex∣pires,</HI> Sept. 3.</NOTE> did appoint his Son to succeed him,</Q> his eldest Son <HI>Richard;</HI> and so ex∣pired <MILESTONE N="30"/> upon the third day of <HI>September</HI> 1658, a day he thought all∣ways very propitious to him, and on which he had twice triumphed for two of his greatest Victories. And this now was a day very memorable for the greatest Storm of Wind that had been ever known, for some hours <NOTE PLACE="marg">The terrible Storm on the same day</NOTE> before and after his death, which overthrew Trees, Houses, and made great Wrecks at Sea; and the tempest was so universal, that the effects of it were terrible both in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> where all People trembled at it; for besides the Wrecks all along the Sea-Coast, many boats were cast away in the very Rivers; and within few days after, the circumstance of his death, that accompanied that Storm, was universally known.</P>
<P>HE was one of those Men, <HI>quos vituperare ne inimici quidem pos∣sunt,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Chara∣cter</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>nisi ut simul laudent;</HI> whom his very Enemies could not condemn without commending him at the same time: for he could never have done half that mischief without great parts of Courage, Industry, and Judgement. He must have had a wonderful understanding in the Na∣tures and Humours of Men, and as great a dexterity in applying them; who, from a private and obscure birth (though of a good Family) with∣out Interest or Estate, Alliance or Friendship, could raise himself to such a heighth, and compound and knead such opposite and contradicto∣ry tempers, humours, and interests into a consistence, that contributed <MILESTONE N="50"/> to His designs, and to their own destruction; whilst himself grew in∣sensibly powerful enough to cut off those by whom he had climbed, in the instant that they projected to demolish their own building. What was said of <HI>Cinna</HI> may very justly be said of Him, <HI>ausum eum, quae nemo aude∣ret</HI>
<PB N="506" REF="5180"/>
<HI>bonus; perfecisse, quae à nullo, nisi fortissimo, perfici possent,</HI> He at∣tempted those things which no good Man durst have ventured on; and atchieved those in which none but a valiant and great Man could have succeeded. Without doubt, no Man with more wickedness ever at∣tempted any thing, or brought to pass what he desired more wicked∣ly, more in the face and contempt of Religion, and moral Honesty; yet wickedness as great as his could never have accomplish'd those de∣signs, without the assistance of a great Spirit, an admirable circum∣spection, and sagacity, and a most magnanimous resolution.</P>
<P>WHEN he appeared first in the Parliament, he seemed to have a <MILESTONE N="10"/> Person in no degree gracious, no ornament of discourse, none of those Talents which use to conciliate the Affections of the Stander by: yet as he grew into Place and Authority, his parts seem'd to be raised, as if he had had concealed Faculties, till he had occasion to use them; and when he was to act the part of a great Man, he did it without any in∣decency, notwithstanding the want of Custom.</P>
<P>AFTER he was confirm'd, and invested Protector by the humble <HI>Petition and Advice,</HI> he consulted with very few upon any Action of importance, nor communicated any enterprise he resolved upon, with more than those who were to have principal parts in the execu∣cution <MILESTONE N="20"/> of it; nor with Them sooner than was absolutely necessary. What he once resolved, in which he was not rash, he would not be disswaded from, nor endure any contradiction of his power and authority; but extorted obedience from them who were not willing to yield it.</P>
<P>ONE time, when he had laid some very extraordinary Tax upon the City, one <HI>Cony,</HI> an eminent Fanatick, and one who had hereto∣fore served him very notably, positively refused to pay his part; and loudly disswaded others from submitting to it, <Q>“as an imposition no∣toriously against the Law, and the Property of the Subject, which” all honest Men were bound to defend.</Q> <Q><HI>Cromwell</HI> sent for him, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> cajoled him with the memory of “the old kindness, and friendship, that had been between them; and that of all Men he did not expect this opposition from Him, in a matter that was so necessary for the” good of the Common-wealth.</Q> It had been allways his fortune to meet with the most rude, and obstinate behaviour from those who had formerly been absolutely govern'd by him; and they commonly put him in mind of some expressions and sayings of his own, in cases of the like nature: so this Man remember'd him, how great an Enemy he had expressed himself to such grievances, and had declared, <Q>“that all, who submitted to them, and paid illegal Taxes, were more to blame, <MILESTONE N="40"/> and greater Enemies to their Country than they who had imposed them; and that the Tyranny of Princes could never be grievous, but” by the tameness and stupidity of the People.</Q> <Q>When <HI>Cromwell</HI> saw that he could not convert him, he told him “that he had a Will as stubborn as His, and he would try which of them two should be Ma∣ster.”</Q> Thereupon, with some expressions of reproach and contempt, he committed the Man to prison; whose courage was nothing abated by it; but assoon as the Term came, he brought his <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> in the King's Bench, which they then called the <HI>Upper</HI> Bench. <HI>Maynard,</HI> who was of Council with the Prisoner, demanded his Liberty with <MILESTONE N="50"/> great confidence, both upon the illegality of the Commitment, and the illegality of the imposition, as being laid without any lawful Au∣thority. The Judges could not maintain or defend either, and enough
<PB N="507" REF="5190"/>
declared what their Sentence would be; and therefore the Protector's Atturney required a farther day, to answer what had been urged. Before that day, <HI>Maynard</HI> was committed to the Tower, for presuming to que∣stion or make doubt of his Authority; and the Judges were sent for, and severely reprehended for suffering that Licence; when they, with all humility, mention'd the Law and <HI>Magna Charta, Cromwell</HI> told them, with terms of contempt, and derision, <Q>“their <HI>Magna F—</HI>should not controle his Actions; which he knew were for the safety of the Com∣mon-wealth.”</Q> <Q>He asked them, “who made them Judges? whether they had any Authority to sit there, but what He gave them? and if his Au∣thority <MILESTONE N="10"/> were at an end, they knew well enough, what would become of themselves; and therefore advised them to be more tender of that which could only preserve them; and so dismissed them with caution, that they should not suffer the Lawyers to prate what it would not” become Them to hear.</Q></P>
<P>THUS he subdued a spirit that had been often troublesome to the most Soveraign power, and made <HI>Westminster-</HI>Hall as obedient, and sub∣servient to his Commands, as any of the rest of his Quarters. In all other matters, which did not concern the life of his Jurisdiction, he seem'd to have great reverence for the Law, rarely interposing between Party and <MILESTONE N="20"/> Party. As he proceeded with this kind of indignation, and haughtiness, with those who were refractory, and durst contend with his greatness, so towards all who complied with his good pleasure, and courted his Pro∣tection, he used great civility, generosity, and bounty.</P>
<P>TO reduce three Nations, which perfectly hated him, to an entire obe∣dience to all his Dictates; to awe, and govern those Nations by an Army that was indevoted to him, and wish'd his ruin, was an Instance of a very prodigious address. But his greatness at home, was but a shadow of the glory he had abroad. It was hard to discover, which fear'd him most, <HI>France, Spain,</HI> or the Low Countries, where his friendship was current at <MILESTONE N="30"/> the value he put upon it. As they did all sacrifice their Honour, and their Interest, to his pleasure, so there is nothing he could have demanded, that either of them would have denied him. To manifest which, there needs only two Instances. The first is, when those of the Valley of <HI>Lu∣cern</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Instances of his Interest among foreign Princes.</NOTE> had unwarily risen in Armes against the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> which gave occasion to the Pope, and the Neighbour Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> to call and sollicite for their extirpation, and their Prince positively resolv'd upon it, <HI>Cromwell</HI> sent his Agent to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> a Prince with whom he had no correspondence, or commerce, and so engaged the Cardinal, and even terrified the Pope himself, without so much as doing any Grace <MILESTONE N="40"/> to the <HI>English</HI> Roman Catholicks (nothing being more usual than his say∣ing, <Q>“that his Ships in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> should visit <HI>Civita Vecchia;”</HI> and that the sound of his Cannon should be heard in <HI>Rome)</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> thought it necessary to restore all that he had taken from them, and did renew all those Privileges they had formerly enjoyed, and newly forfeited.</Q></P>
<P>THE other Instance of his Authority was yet greater, and more in∣credible. In the City of <HI>Nismes,</HI> which is one of the fairest in the Pro∣vince of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and where those of the Religion do most abound, <MILESTONE N="50"/> there was a great Faction at that Season when the Consuls (who are the Chief Magistrates) were to be chosen. Those of the Reform'd Re∣ligion had the confidence to set up one of themselves for that Magistracy; which they of the Roman Religion resolv'd to oppose with all their
<PB N="508" REF="5200"/>
power. The dissension between them made so much noise, that the In∣tendant of the Province, who is the supreme Minister in all Civil Af∣fairs throughout the whole Province, went thither to prevent any dis∣order that might happen. When the day of Election came, those of the Religion possessed themselves with many arm'd Men of the Town-House, where the Election was to be made. The Magistrates sent to know what their meaning was; <Q>to which they answer'd, “they were there to give their Voices for the choice of the new Consuls, and to be sure that the” Election should be fairly made.</Q> The Bishop of the City, the Intendant of the Province, with all the Officers of the Church, and the present Ma∣gistrates <MILESTONE N="10"/> of the Town, went together in their Robes to be present at the Election, without any suspicion that there would be any Force used. When they came near the Gate of the Town-House, which was shut, and they supposed would be open'd when they came, they within pour'd out a Volly of Musket shot upon them, by which the Dean of the Church, and two or three of the Magistrates of the Town, were kill'd upon the place, and very many others wounded; whereof some died shortly af∣ter. In this Confusion, the Magistrates put themselves into as good a posture to defend themselves as they could, without any purpose of of∣fending the other, till they should be better provided; in order to which <MILESTONE N="20"/> they sent an Express to the Court with a plain relation of the whole matter of fact, <Q>“and that there appear'd to be no manner of Combina∣tion with those of the Religion in other places of the Province; but that it was an insolence in those of the place, upon the presumption of their great Numbers, which were little inferior to those of the Ca∣tholicks.”</Q> The Court was glad of the Occasion, and resolv'd that this provocation, in which other places were not involv'd, and which no body could excuse, should warrant all kind of severity in that City, even to the pulling down their Temples, and expelling many of them for ever out of the City; which, with the execution and forfeiture of many of <MILESTONE N="30"/> the principal Persons, would be a general Mortification to all of the Re∣ligion in <HI>France;</HI> with whom they were heartily offended; and a part of the Army was forthwith order'd to march towards <HI>Nismes,</HI> to see this executed with the utmost rigour.</P>
<P>THOSE of the Religion in the Town, were quickly sensible into what condition they had brought themselves; and sent, with all possi∣ble Submission, to the Magistrates to excuse themselves, and to im∣pute what had been done to the rashness of particular Men, who had no order for what they did. <Q>The Magistrates answer'd, “that they were glad they were sensible of their Miscarriage; but they could say no∣thing <MILESTONE N="40"/> upon the Subject, till the King's pleasure should be known;” to whom they had sent a full relation of all that had passed.</Q> The others very well knew what the King's pleasure would be, and forth∣with sent an Express, one <HI>Moulins,</HI> who had liv'd many years in that place, and in <HI>Montpellier,</HI> to <HI>Cromwell</HI> to desire his protection and interposition. The Express made so much hast, and found so good a reception the first hour he came, that <HI>Cromwell,</HI> after he had receiv'd the whole Account, <Q>bad him “refresh himself after so long a Journey, and he would take such care of his business, that by the time he” came to <HI>Paris</HI> he should find it dispatched;</Q> and, that Night, sent <MILESTONE N="50"/> away another Messenger to his Embassadour <HI>Lockhart;</HI> who, by the time <HI>Moulins</HI> came thither, had so far prevailed with the Cardinal, that Orders were sent to stop the Troops, which were upon their
<PB N="509" REF="5210"/>
March towards <HI>Nismes;</HI> and, within few days after, <HI>Moulins</HI> return'd with a full Pardon, and Amnesty from the King, under the Great Seal of <HI>France,</HI> so fully confirm'd with all circumstances, that there was never farther mention made of it, but all things passed as if there had never been any such thing. So that no body can wonder, that his Memory remains still in those parts, and with those People, in great veneration.</P>
<P><Q>HE would never suffer himself to be denied any thing he ever asked of the Cardinal, alledging, “that the People would not be otherwise” satisfied;</Q> which the Cardinal bore very heavily, and complain'd of <MILESTONE N="10"/> to those with whom he would be free. One day, he visited Madam <HI>Turenne,</HI> and when he took his leave of her, She, according to her Custom, besought him to continue gracious to the Churches. <Q>Where∣upon the Cardinal told her, “that he knew not how to behave him∣self; if he advised the King to punish and suppress their Insolence, <HI>Cromwell</HI> threaten'd him to joyn with the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and if he shew'd” any favour to them, at <HI>Rome</HI> they accounted him an Heretick.</Q></P>
<P>To conclude his Character, <HI>Cromwell</HI> was not so far a Man of blood, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conclusion of his Chara∣cter.</NOTE> as to follow <HI>Machiavel</HI>'s method; which prescribes, upon a total al∣teration of Government, as a thing absolutely necessary, to cut off all <MILESTONE N="20"/> the heads of those, and extirpate their Families, who are Friends to the old one. It was confidently reported, that, in the Council of Of∣ficers, it was more than once proposed, <Q>“that there might be a ge∣neral Massacre of all the Royal Party, as the only Expedient to se∣cure” the Government, but that <HI>Cromwell</HI> would never consent to it;</Q> it may be, out of too great a contempt of his Enemies. In a word, as he was guilty of many Crimes against which Damnation is de∣nounced, and for which Hell-fire is prepared, so he had some good Qua∣lities which have caused the Memory of some Men in all Ages to be cele∣brated; and he will be look'd upon by Posterity as a brave wicked Man.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>ONTRARY to all expectation both at home <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The beginning of</HI> Richard<HI>'s Government.</HI></NOTE> and abroad, this Earthquake was attended with no signal Alteration. It was believ'd that <HI>Lambert</HI> would be in the head of the Army, and that <HI>Monk</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> would never sub∣mit to be under him. Besides the expectation the King had from the general Affection of the Kingdom, he had fair promises from Men of Interest in it, and of Command in the Ar∣my, who professed to prepare for such a Con∣juncture as this; and that the disorder arising from <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s death <MILESTONE N="10"/> might dispose <HI>Lockhart</HI> to depend upon the best Title, seem'd a reason∣able expectation: but nothing of this fell out. Never Monarch, after he had inherited a Crown by many descents, died in more silence, nor with less alteration; and there was the same, or a greater calm in the King∣dom than had been before.</P>
<P>THE next morning after the death of <HI>Oliver, Richard</HI> his Son is pro∣claim'd his Lawful Successor; the Army congratulate their new Ge∣neral, and renew their Vows of fidelity to him; the Navy doth the like; the City appears more unanimous for His Service, than they were for <MILESTONE N="20"/> his Father's; and most Counties in <HI>England,</HI> by Addresses under their hands, testified their obedience to their new Soveraign without any he∣sitation. The dead is interr'd in the Sepulcher of the Kings, and with the obsequies due to such. His Son inherits all his Greatness, and all his
<PB N="514" REF="5240"/>
Glory, without the publick hate, that visibly attended the other. Fo∣reign Princes addressed their Condoleances to him, and desired to renew their Alliances; and nothing was heard in <HI>England</HI> but the voice of Joy, and large Encomiums of their new Protector: so that the King's con∣dition never appear'd so hopeless, so desperate; for a more favourable Conjuncture his Friends could never expect than this, which now seem'd to blast all their hopes, and confirm their utmost despair.</P>
<P>IT is probable that this Melancholick prospect might have continued long, if this Child of Fortune could have sate still, and been contented to have enjoyed his own felicity. But his Council thought it necessary <MILESTONE N="10"/> that he should call a Parliament, to confirm what they had already given him, and to dispel all Clouds which might arise. And there seem'd to be the more reason for it, because the last Alliance which <HI>Oliver</HI> had made with the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and of which he was fonder than of all the rest, did oblige him in the Spring to send a strong Fleet into the <HI>Sound,</HI> to assist that King against <HI>Denmark;</HI> at least to induce <HI>Denmark,</HI> by way of mediation, to accept of such conditions as the other would be willing to give him. This could hardly be done without some assi∣stance of Parliament; and therefore the new Protector sent out his Writs to call a Parliament, to meet together on the twenty seventh day of <HI>Ja∣nuary;</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He calls a Parliament to meet</HI> Jan. 27. 1659</NOTE> till which day, for near five Months, he remain'd as great a Prince as ever his Father had been. He follow'd the Model that was left him, and sent out his Writs to call those as Peers who had constituted the other House in the former Parliament; and so both Lords and Com∣mons <NOTE PLACE="marg">It meets on that day.</NOTE> met at the day assign'd.</P>
<P>RICHARD came to the Parliament in the same State that <HI>Oliver</HI> his Father had done; and sent the Gentleman Usher of the Black-rod to the Commons, that they should attend him in the other House; where, first by himself, and then by the Keeper of his Great Seal, <HI>Nathaniel</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The business recommended to them by the Protector.</NOTE> <HI>Fiennes,</HI> he recommended to them the prosecution of the War with <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Spain,</HI> and the assistance of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in the <HI>Sound.</HI> He had so good fortune at the beginning, that all the Commons sign'd an <HI>En∣gagement</HI> not to alter the present Government. But they were no sooner inclosed within those Walls, than there appear'd the old Republican Spirit, though more wary than it had used to be. It begun with en∣quiring <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Differences rise in the House of Com∣mons about the Accounts of Money, and about the o∣ther House</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> into the Accounts, how the Money had been spent, and into the Offices of Excise and Customs, and what was become of all that Revenue. When they were called upon to settle the Act of Recogni∣tion, to confirm <HI>Richard,</HI> and his Authority in the State, they would first inform themselves of their own Authority, and how far the Go∣vernment <MILESTONE N="40"/> was already settled, and what part was fit to be assign'd to the other House; which they would by no means allow to be a part of the Government already establish'd, which they had promised not to alter. Upon this Argument they exercised themselves with great Licence, as well upon the Creator of those Peers, and the power of the late Pro∣tector, as upon his Creatures the Peers; of whose dignity they were not tender, but handled them according to the Quality they had been of, not that which they were now grown to. <Q>They put the House in mind, “how grievous it had been to the Kingdom, that the Bishops had sate in the House of Peers, because they were look'd upon as so many <MILESTONE N="50"/> Votes for the King; which was a reason much stronger against these Persons; who were all the work of the Protector's own hand, and there∣fore” could not but be entirely addicted and devoted to his Interest.</Q>
<Q><PB N="515" REF="5250"/>
They concluded, “that they could not, with good Consciences, and without the guilt of Perjury, ever consent, that that other House should have any part in the Government, since they had all taken the Engagement, that there should be no more any House of Peers, and since the Office of Protector had been, and might still continue with∣out” it.</Q></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all this confidence, which disturbed the Me∣thod intended to be proceeded in, this violent Party could not prevail, but it was carried by the Major part of the House, <Q>“that they would <NOTE PLACE="marg">It was carried, that the other House should be allowed.</NOTE> meet, and confer with the other House, as a part of the Parliament, during this present Parliament; and likewise, that such other Persons, <MILESTONE N="10"/> as had a right to come to that other House, and had not forfeited it” by their breach of Trust (by which they meant those Lords who had been allways against the King)</Q> <Q>“”should not be restrain'd from coming thither:</Q> yet the Temper of the House of Commons could hardly be judged by all this. Some things were done, which looked like con∣descension to the Royal Party; but more for the countenance of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Presbyterians;</HI> and whatsoever contradicted those who were for a Re∣publick, was looked upon as favourable to the Protector.</P>
<P>THE stirring these several humours, and the drowsy temper of <HI>Ri∣chard,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> raised another Spirit in the Army. A new Council of Officers <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Officers met, who consult about the Go∣vernment.</NOTE> met together by their own Authority, and admitted <HI>Lambert,</HI> though no Member of the Army, to consult with them; they neither liked Protector, nor Parliament, but consulted what Government to settle, that might be better than either: yet they would not incense them both together, nor appear to have any disinclination to <HI>Richard,</HI> who had many of his nearest Friends amongst them. They therefore prepared an <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their Address to Richard</HI> April 6. 1659</NOTE> Address to him; <Q>in which they complain'd of “the great Arrears of pay that were due to the Army, by which they were in great Streights: that they, who had borne the brunt of the War, and undergone all the difficulties and dangers of it, were now undervalued, derided, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and laid aside: that the good old Cause was ill spoken of, and tra∣duced by Malignants and disaffected Persons; who grew every day more insolent, and their Numbers encreased, by the resort out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and other places; and they had several secret meetings in the City of <HI>London:</HI> that the Names of all those who had sate upon the late King as his Judges, were lately printed, and scatter'd abroad, as if they were design'd to destruction; and that many Suits were commenced at Common Law against honest Men, for what they had transacted in the War as Soldiers: that those famous Acts, which had been performed in the long Parliament, and by the late Protector,” <MILESTONE N="40"/> were censured, railed at, and vilified.</Q> <Q>By all which, they said, “it was very manifest, that the good old Cause was declined; which they were resolv'd to assert. And therefore they besought his Highness to represent those their Complaints to the Parliament, and to require” proper and speedy Remedies.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Address was deliver'd from the Army by <HI>Fleetwood</HI> to <HI>Ri∣chard,</HI> on <HI>April</HI> 6<SUP>th</SUP>. 1659; which was no sooner known, than <HI>Tichburn,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The City Mili¦tia second them</NOTE> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> two Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> and principal Commanders of that Militia, drew up likewise a Remonstrance, and sent it to the Coun∣cil of Officers; in which they declared their Resolutions with the Army <MILESTONE N="50"/> to stick to the good old Cause, and that they were resolv'd to accompany them, in whatsoever they should do for what they call'd the Nation's good.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="5260"/>
THE Parliament was quickly alarm'd with these Cabals of the Army, and the City; which <HI>Richard</HI> was as much terrified with, as They. In order to the suppression thereof, the Parliament voted, <Q>“that there <NOTE PLACE="marg">Votes of the Parliament upon it.</NOTE> should be no meeting, or general Council of Officers, without the Protector's consent, and by his Order: and, that no Person should have Commands by Sea or Land, in either of the three Nations, who did not immediately subscribe, that he would not disturb the free meet∣ing of Parliaments, or of any Members in either House of Parliament;” nor obstruct their freedom in Debates and Counsels.</Q> These Votes, or to this effect, were sent to <HI>Richard,</HI> and by Him presently to <HI>Walling∣ford</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/> House, where the Council of Officers then sate.</P>
<P>THESE Officers were Men who resolv'd to execute as well as order; they knew well that they were gone much too far, if they went no far∣ther: and therefore they no sooner receiv'd these votes, but they sent <HI>Fleetwood</HI> and <HI>Desborough</HI> to <HI>Richard</HI> (the first had married his Sister; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Officers advise him to dissolve the Parliament:</NOTE> the other was his Uncle; both raised by <HI>Cromwell)</HI> to advise him forth∣with to dissolve the Parliament. They were two upon whose Affection, in regard of the nearness of their Alliance, and their obligation to, and dependence upon his Father, he had as much reason to be confident, as on any Men's in the Nation. <Q><HI>Fleetwood</HI> used no Arguments but of <MILESTONE N="20"/> Conscience, “”to prevent the Nation's being engaged in blood;</Q> <Q>which, he said, “would inevitably fall out, if the Parliament were not present∣ly” dissolved.</Q> <Q><HI>Desborough,</HI> a fellow of a rough and rude temper, treated him only with threats, and menaces; told him, “it was impossible for” him to keep both the Parliament, and the Army, his Friends;</Q> <Q>wished him, “to choose which he would prefer: if he dissolved the Parlia∣ment out of hand, he had the Army at his Devotion; if he refused that, he believed the Army would quickly pull him out of <HI>White-Hall.”</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE poor Man had not Spirit enough to discern what was best for <MILESTONE N="30"/> him; and yet he was not without Friends to counsel him, if he had been capable to receive Counsel. <Q>Besides many Members of the Parliament, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Advice to</HI> Ri∣chard <HI>to the contrary:</HI></NOTE> of Courage and Interest, who repair'd to him with assurance, “that the Parliament would continue firm to him, and destroy the Ringleaders of this seditious Crew, if he would adhere to the Parliament; but if he were prevailed upon to dissolve it, he would be left without a friend; and They who had compell'd him to do so imprudent an action, would” contemn him when he had done it:</Q> <Q>some Officers of the Army like∣wise, of equal Courage and Interest with any of the rest, perswaded <NOTE PLACE="marg">And of some Officers of the Army.</NOTE> him “to reject the desire of those who call'd themselves the Council of” <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Army, and to think of punishing their presumption.</Q> <HI>Ingoldsby, Whaley,</HI> and <HI>Goffe,</HI> three Colonels of the Army, and, the two former, Men of signal Courage, offer'd to stand by him; and one of them offer'd to kill <HI>Lambert</HI> (whom they looked upon as the Author of this Con∣spiracy) if he would give him a Warrant to that purpose.</P>
<P>RICHARD continued irresolute, now inclined one way, then ano∣ther. But in the end, <HI>Desborough</HI> and his Companions prevailed with him, <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is prevail'd with to dis∣solve the Par∣liament.</NOTE> before they parted, to sign a Commission, which they had caused to be prepared, to <HI>Nathaniel Fiennes,</HI> his Keeper of the Seal, to dissolve the Parliament the next morning; of which the Parliament having notice, <MILESTONE N="50"/> they resolved not to go up. So that when <HI>Fiennes</HI> sent for them to the other House, the Commons shut the door of their House, and would not suffer the Gentleman Usher of the Black-rod to come in, but ad∣journed
<PB N="517" REF="5270"/>
themselves for three days, till the five and twentieth of <HI>April,</HI> imagining that they should by that time convert the Protector from de∣stroying himself. But the poor Creature was so hared by the Council of Officers, that he presently caused a Proclamation to be issued out, by <NOTE PLACE="marg">He issues out a Proclamation to that pur∣pose; where∣upon his Pro∣tectorship wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at an end.</NOTE> which he did declare the Parliament to be dissolved. And from that mi∣nute no body resorted to him, nor was the name of the Protector after∣wards heard of but in derision; the Council of Officers appointing Guards to attend at <HI>Westminster,</HI> which kept out those Members, who, in pur∣suance of their adjournment, would have enter'd into the House upon the day appointed. Thus, by extreme pusillanimity, the Son suffer'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> himself to be stripped, in one moment, of all the greatness, and power, which the Father had acquired in so many years, with wonderful cou∣rage, industry, and resolution.</P>
<P>WHEN the Council of Officers had, with this strange success, having no authority but what they gave one another, rid themselves of a Su∣periour; or, as the Phrase then was, removed the <HI>single Person,</HI> they knew that they could not long hold the Government in their own hands, if, before any thing else, they did not remove <HI>Ingoldsby, Whaley, Goffe,</HI> and those other Officers, who had disswaded <HI>Richard</HI> from submitting to their Advice, from having any Command in the Army; which they <MILESTONE N="20"/> therefore did; and replaced <HI>Lambert,</HI> and all the rest who had been <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Council of Officers restore</HI> Lambert, &amp;c. <HI>to the Army, and remove many of</HI> Gromwell<HI>'s Friends. They issue a Declaration to restore the long Parlia∣ment,</HI> May 6.</NOTE> cashiered by <HI>Oliver,</HI> into their own Charges again. So that the Army was become Republican to their wish; and that the Government might return to be purely such, they published a Declaration upon the sixth of <HI>May,</HI> wherein, after a large preamble in commendation of the good old Cause, and accusing themselves, <Q>“for having been instrumental in de∣clining from it; whence all the ills, the Common-wealth had sustain'd, had proceeded, and the vindication whereof they were resolv'd to pur∣sue” for the future;</Q> <Q>they remember'd, “that the long Parliament, con∣sisting of those Members who had continued to sit till the twentieth of” <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>April</HI> 1653 (which was the day that <HI>Cromwell,</HI></Q> with the Assistance of these very Officers, <Q>had pull'd them out of the House, and dismissed them) “had been eminent Assertors of that Cause, and had a special” presence of God with them, and were signally blessed in that work.</Q> <Q>They said, “that, the desires of many good People concurring with them, they did, by that Declaration, according to their duty, invite those Members to return to the discharge of their Trust, as they had done” before that day;</Q> <Q>and promised, “that they would be ready, in their places, to yield them their utmost Assistance, that they might sit, and consult in safety, for the setling and securing the peace and quiet of” <MILESTONE N="40"/> the Common-wealth, for which they had now so good an opportunity.</Q> And this Declaration, within very few days, they seconded with what they call'd <HI>The Humble Petition and Address of the Officers of the Army to the Parliament;</HI> which contain'd several advices, or rather positive directions how they were to govern.</P>
<P>THIS restoring the Rump-Parliament was the only way in which they could most agree, though it was not suitable to what some of them desired: They well foresaw, that they might give an opportunity to more People to come together than would be for their benefit; for that all the surviving Members of that Parliament would pretend a Ti∣tle <MILESTONE N="50"/> to sit there: and therefore, they did not only carefully limit the Con∣vention to such Members who had continued to sit from <HI>January</HI> 1648 to <HI>April</HI> 1653, but caused a Guard likewise to attend to hinder, and
<PB N="518" REF="5280"/>
keep the other Members from entring into the House. When <HI>Lenthal,</HI> the old Speaker, with forty or fifty of those old Members specified in the Declaration, took their places in the House, and some of the old <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of the old, Excluded Members went into the House <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luded again.</NOTE> excluded Members likewise got in, and enter'd into Debate with them upon the matters proposed, the House was adjourn'd till the next day: and then better care was taken, by appointing such Persons, who well knew all the Members, to inform the Guards, who were, and who were Not, to go into the House. By this means that Cabal only was suffer'd to enter which had first form'd the Common-wealth, and foster'd it for near five years after it was born. So that the return of the Government <MILESTONE N="10"/> into these Men's hands again, seem'd to be the most dismal change that could happen, and to pull up all the hopes of the King by the roots.</P>
<P>WE must, for the better observation, and distinction of the several Changes in the Government, call this Congregation of Men, who were now repossessed of it, by the Style they call'd themselves, the Parlia∣ment; how far soever they were from being one. They resolv'd in the first place to vindicate, and establish their own Authority; which they could not think to be firm, whilst there was still a Protector, or the Name of a Protector in being, and residing in <HI>White-Hall.</HI> They ap∣pointed therefore a Committee to go to <HI>Richard Cromwell,</HI> and, that <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment sent to</HI> Richard <HI>to know whether he acquiesced, and submitted to their Au∣thority.</HI></NOTE> he might have hope they would be his good Masters, first to enquire into the State of his Debts, and then to demand of him, whether He acquiesced in the present Government? He, already humbled to that poverty of Spirit they could wish, gave the Committee a paper, <Q>“in which, he said, was contain'd the State of his Debts, and how con∣tracted;”</Q> which amounted to twenty nine thousand six hundred and forty pounds.</P>
<P><Q>TO the other Question, his Answer was likewise in Writing; “that He trusted, his carriage and behaviour had manifested his Acquiescence in the Will and good pleasure of God, and that he loved and valued <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Peace of the Common-wealth much above his private concern∣ment; desiring by this, that a measure of his future comportment might be taken; which, by the blessing of God, should be such as should bear the same Witness; he having, he hoped, in some degree learned rather to reverence and submit to the hand of God, than he unquiet under it: that, as to the late providence that had fallen out, however, in respect to the particular engagement that lay upon him, he could not be active in making a Change in the Government of the Nations, yet, through the goodness of God, he could freely acquiesce in it being made; and did hold himself obliged, as with other Men he might expect protection from the present Government, so to de∣mean <MILESTONE N="40"/> himself with all peaceableness under it, and to procure, to the uttermost of his power, that all in whom he had Interest should do the” same.</Q></P>
<P>THIS satisfied them as to <HI>Richard;</HI> but they were not without ap∣prehension that they should find a more refractory Spirit in his Brother <HI>Harry,</HI> who was Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and looked upon as a Man of another air and temper. He had in his Exercise of that Government, by the frankness of his humour, and a general civility towards all, and very particularly obliging some, render'd himself gracious and popular <MILESTONE N="50"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry Crom∣well <HI>likewise submits, and resigns his Commission of Lieutenant of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> to all sorts of People, and might have been able to have made some contests with the Parliament. But assoon as he receiv'd an Order from them to attend them in Person he thought not fit to be wiser than his
<PB N="519" REF="5290"/>
elder Brother, and came over to them even sooner than they expected, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment makes</HI> Ludlow, <HI>and four other Commissioners, Governours of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> and laid his Commission at their Feet; which they accepted, and put the Government of that Kingdom into the hands of <HI>Ludlow,</HI> and four other Commissioners.</P>
<P>IT may not prove ingrateful to the Reader, in this place, to enter∣tain him with a very pleasant story, that related to this miserable <HI>Ri∣chard,</HI> though it happen'd long afterwards; because there will be scarce again any occasion so much as to mention him, during the continuance of this Relation. Shortly after the King's Return, and the manifest Joy that possessed the whole Kingdom thereupon, this poor Creature <MILESTONE N="10"/> found it necessary to transport himself into <HI>France,</HI> more for fear of his Debts than of the King; who thought it not necessary to enquire after a Man so long forgotten. After he had lived some years in <HI>Paris</HI> untaken notice of, and indeed unknown, living in a most obscure condi∣tion and disguise, not owning his own Name, nor having above one Ser∣vant to attend him, he thought it necessary, upon the first rumour and ap∣prehension that there was like to be a War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> to quit that Kingdom, and to remove to some place that would be neu∣tral to either Party; and pitched upon <HI>Geneva.</HI> Making his way thither by <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and through the Province of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> he passed <MILESTONE N="20"/> through <HI>Pezenas,</HI> a very pleasant Town belonging to the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> who hath a fair Palace there, and, being then Governour of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> made his Residence in it.</P>
<P>IN this place <HI>Richard</HI> made some stay, and walking abroad to enter∣tain himself with the view of the Situation, and of many things worth the seeing, he met with a Person who well knew him, and was well known by him, the other having allways been of his Father's, and of His Party; so that they were glad enough to find themselves together. <Q>The other told him, “that all Strangers who came to that Town, used to wait upon the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> the Governour of the Province; <MILESTONE N="30"/> who expected it, and allways treated Strangers, and particularly the <HI>English,</HI> with much civility: that he need not be known, but that he himself would first go to the Prince and inform him, that another <HI>English</HI> Gentleman was passing through that Town towards <HI>Italy,</HI> who” would be glad to have the honour to kiss his hands.</Q> The Prince re∣ceiv'd him with great civility and grace, according to his Natural custom, and, after few words, begun to discourse of the Affairs of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and asked many questions concerning the King, and whether all Men were quiet, and submitted obediently to him; which the other answer'd briefly, according to the truth. <Q>“”Well,</Q> said the Prince, <Q><HI>“Oli∣ver,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> though he was a Traytor and a Villain, was a brave Fellow, had great Parts, great Courage, and was worthy to Command; but that <HI>Richard,</HI> that Coxcomb, <HI>Coquin, Poltron,</HI> was surely the basest fellow alive; What is become of that Fool? How was it possible he could be” such a Sot?</Q> <Q>He answer'd, “that he was betrayed by those whom he” most trusted, and who had been most obliged by his Father;</Q> so being weary of his Visit, quickly took his leave, and the next morning left the Town, out of fear that the Prince might know that He was the very Fool and Coxcomb he had mention'd so kindly. And within two days after, the Prince did come to know who it was whom he had treated <MILESTONE N="50"/> so well, and whom before, by his behaviour, he had believ'd to be a Man not very glad of the King's Restoration.</P>

They sent Embassadours to the <HI>Sound,</HI> to mediate a Peace be∣tween <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">They send Em∣bassadours to mediate Peace between the two Northern Crowns.</NOTE> those two Crowns, being resolv'd to decline all Occasions of ex∣pence abroad, that they might the better settle their Government at home. To that purpose, they were willing to put an end to the War with <HI>Spain,</HI> without parting with any thing that had been taken from it, which would not consist with their honour. That they might through∣ly unite their Friends of the Army to them, they passed an Act of In∣demnity <NOTE PLACE="marg">They pass an Act of Indem∣nity to the Army.</NOTE> demnity to pardon all their former transgressions, and tergiversations, which had been the cause of the Parliament's former dissolution, and of all the Mischief which had follow'd.</P>
<P>NOW there appear'd as great a Calm as ever, and their Government well settled, to the general content of the People of their Party, who <MILESTONE N="20"/> testified the same by their Acclamations, and likewise by particular Ad∣dresses. And that they might be sure to be liable to no more Affronts, they would no more make a General, which might again introduce a single Person; the thought of which, or of any thing that might con∣tribute towards it, they most heartily abhorr'd. And to make That im∣possible, as they thought, <Q>they appointed “the Speaker to execute the <NOTE PLACE="marg">They appoint all Commis∣sions military to be sign'd by the Speaker.</NOTE> Office of General, in such manner as they should direct; and that all” Commissions should be granted by him, and sealed with their own Seal;</Q> all the Seals used by the <HI>Comwells</HI> being broken. And accordingly all the Officers of the Army, and Navy (for the Speaker was Admiral as <MILESTONE N="30"/> well as General) deliver'd up their Commissions, and took new Ones in the form that was prescribed. So that now they saw not how their Em∣pire could be shaken.</P>
<P>BUT these Men had not sate long in their old places, when they call'd to mind how they had been used after they had been deposed, the re∣proaches, and the contempt they underwent from all kind of People; but above all, the scoffs and derision they suffer'd from the King's Party, when they saw them reduced to the same level in Power and Authority with themselves. And though the smart they felt from others, vexed <MILESTONE N="40"/> and anger'd them as much, yet they were content to suspend their re∣venge towards Them, that they might with less controle exercise their Tyranny over the poor broken Cavaliers. <Q>So they made a present Order, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They banish all Cavaliers</HI> 20 <HI>miles from</HI> London</NOTE> “to banish all who had ever manifested any Affection to the King, or” his Father, twenty Miles from <HI>London;</HI></Q> and revived all those Orders they had formerly made, and which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had abolish'd or for∣borne to execute; by which many Persons were committed to Prisons for offences they thought had been forgotten. And the consequence of these proceedings awaken'd those of another Classis, to apprehensions of what They might be made liable to. The Soldiers were very merry <MILESTONE N="50"/> at their new General; and thought it necessary he should march with them upon the next Adventure; and the Officers thought they had de∣serv'd more than an Act of Indemnity, for restoring them to such a So∣veraignty.
<PB N="521" REF="5310"/>
In a word, as the Parliament remember'd how They had been used, so all other People remember'd how they had used Them, and could not bring themselves to look with reverence upon those, whom, for above four years together, they had derided and con∣temn'd.</P>
<P>THIS universal temper raised the Spirits again of the King's Friends, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Party begin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to move</NOTE> who found very many of those who had heretofore serv'd the Parlia∣ment, and been afterwards disobliged both by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the Rump Parliament, very desirous to enter into Amity with them, and to make a firm conjunction with them towards the King's Reestablishment. <MILESTONE N="10"/> Those Members of the long Parliament, who, after the Treaty of the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> were by violence kept from the House, took it in great indignation, that They, upon whom the said violence was practiced af∣terwards, which they had first countenanced upon them, should not restore them being now restored themselves, and were ready to embrace any occasion to disturb their new Governours; to which they were the more encouraged by the common discourse of the Soldiers; <Q>who de∣clared, “that, if there were any commotion in the Kingdom, they” would go no farther to suppress it, than <HI>Lenthal</HI> should lead them.</Q></P>
<P>M<SUP>r</SUP> MORDAUNT, who had so lately his head upon the Block, was <MILESTONE N="20"/> more active than any Man; and was so well trusted by Men of all con∣ditions, upon the Courage of his former behaviour, that he had in truth very full engagements from very good Men in most Quarters of the Kingdom, <Q>“that if the King would assign them a day, and promise to come to them after they were imbodyed, they would not fail to” appear at the day.</Q> Whereupon, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> ventur'd himself to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Mordaunt <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>to</HI> Brus∣sels <HI>to ac∣quaint the</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>the preparations.</HI></NOTE> come in disguise to the King to <HI>Brussels,</HI> to give him a clear Account how his business stood, and what probability there was of success, and likewise to complain of the want of forwardness in some of those upon whom the King most relied, to encourage other Men, and to desire that his Majesty would, by Him, require them to concur with the rest. It appear'd, by the Account he gave, that there were very few Counties in <HI>England,</HI> where there was not a form'd Undertaking by the most powerful Men of that County, to possess themselves of some consider∣able place in it; and if any of them succeeded, the opportunity would be fairer for the King to venture his own Person, than he yet had had, or than he was like to have, if he suffer'd those who were now in the Government, to be settled in it.</P>
<P>THAT which was best digested, and, in respect of the Undertakers, most like to succeed, was, first the surprisal and possessing of <HI>Lynne,</HI> a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A design of surprising</HI> Lynne <HI>by the Lord</HI> Wil∣loughby <HI>of</HI> Patham <HI>and S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Horatio Townsend</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"/> Maritime Town, of great importance in respect of the Situation, and likewise of the good Affection of the Gentlemen of the parts adjacent. This was undertaken by the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham,</HI> with the con∣sent and approbation of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Horatio Townsend;</HI> who, being a Gentleman of the greatest Interest, and Credit, in that large County of <HI>Norsolk,</HI> was able to bring in a good Body of Men to possess it. The former had serv'd the Parliament, and was in great credit with the Presbyterians, and so less liable to suspicion; the latter had been under Age till long after the end of the War, and so liable to no reproach or jealousy, yet of very worthy Principles, and of a noble Fortune; which he engaged <MILESTONE N="50"/> very frankly, to borrow Money; and laid it out to provide Armes and Ammunition; and all the King's Friends in those parts, were ready to obey those Persons in whatsoever they undertook.</P>
<P><PB N="522" REF="5320"/>
ANOTHER Design, which was look'd upon as ripe too, was the sur∣prisal <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And a design upon</HI> Glocester <HI>by</HI> Massey.</NOTE> of <HI>Glocester,</HI> a Town very advantageously Situated upon the Ri∣ver of <HI>Severn,</HI> that would have great influence upon <HI>Bristol</HI> and <HI>Wor∣cester;</HI> both which, Persons of the best Interest undertook to secure, assoon as <HI>Glocester</HI> should be possessed; which Major General <HI>Massey,</HI> who had been formerly Governour thereof, and defended it too well against the King, made no question he should be able to do, having been in the Town <HI>incognito,</HI> and conferr'd with his Friends there, and lain concealed in the adjacent places, till the day should be appointed for the Execution of it; of all which he sent the King an Account; nor did there appear much difficulty in the point, there being no Garrison in <MILESTONE N="10"/> either of the places.</P>

<P>WHEN the King receiv'd this Account in gross from a Person so well instructed, whereof he had by retail receiv'd much from the Persons concern'd (for it was another circumstance of the looseness of the pre∣sent Government, that Messengers went forward and backward with all security) and likewise found by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> that all things were now gone so far that there was no retreat, and therefore that the resolution <MILESTONE N="30"/> was general, <Q>“that, though any discovery should be made, and any Per∣sons imprison'd, the rest would proceed assoon as the day should be ap∣pointed” by the King,</Q> his Majesty resolv'd that he would adventure his own Person, and would be ready <HI>incognito</HI> at <HI>Calais</HI> upon such a day of the Month; and that his Brother the Duke of <HI>York</HI> should be likewise there, or very near, to the end that from thence, upon the Intelligence of the success of that day, which was likewise then appointed, they might dispose themselves, one to one place, and the other to another.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd at this time the discovery of a vile Treachery, <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A discovery of the Treachery of S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Richard Willis.</NOTE> which had done the King's Affairs much harm; and had it been longer concealed, would have done much more. From the death of <HI>Oliver,</HI> some of those who were in the secretest part of his Affairs, discern'd evidently, that their new Protector would never be able to bear the burthen; and so thought how they might do such service to the King, as might merit from him. One who had a part in the Office of Secrecy, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Moreland,</HI> sent an Express to the King, to inform him of many particulars of Moment, and to give him some advices, what his Majesty was to do; which was reasonable and prudent to be done. He sent him word what Persons might be induced to serve him, and what way he <MILESTONE N="50"/> was to take to induce them to it, and what other Persons would never do it, what prosessions soever they might make. He made offer of his Service to his Majesty, and constantly to advertise him of whatsoever
<PB N="523" REF="5330"/>
was necessary for him to know; and, as an instance of his fidelity, and his usefulness, he advertised the King of a Person who was much trusted by his Majesty, and constantly betrayed him; <Q>“that he had receiv'd a large Pension from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and that he continually gave <HI>Thurloe</HI> Intelligence of all that he knew; but that it was with so great circum∣spection, that he was never seen in his presence: that in his contract, he had promised to make such discoveries, as should prevent any dan∣ger to the State; but that he would never endanger any Man's life, nor be produced to give in Evidence against any: and that this very Person had discover'd the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s being in <HI>London</HI> the <MILESTONE N="10"/> last year, to <HI>Cromwell;</HI> but could not be induced to discover where his lodging was; only undertook his journey should be ineffectual, and that he should quickly return; and then they might take him if” they could;</Q> to which he would not contribute.

<P>THE King, and They who were most trusted by him in his secret <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King at first believes it not.</NOTE> Transactions, believ'd not this information; but concluded that it was contrived to amuse him, and to distract all his Affairs by a jealousy of those who were intrusted in the conduct of them.

He was a Gentleman, and was very well bred, and of very good parts, a courage eminently known, and a very good Officer, and in truth of so general a good reputation, that, if the King had professed to have any doubt of his honesty, his Friends would have thought he had receiv'd ill infusions without any ground; and he had given a very late testimony of his sincerity by concealing the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who had communicated more with Him, than with any Man in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> during his being there. On the other side, all the other informa∣tions, and advices, that were sent by the Person who accused him, were very important, and could have no end but his Majesty's Service; and the Offices that Gentlemen offer'd to perform for the future, were of that consequence, that they could not be overvalued. This Intelligence could not be sent with a hope of getting Money; for the present con∣dition of him who sent it, was so good, that he expected no reward, till the King should be enabled to give it; and he who was sent in the Er∣rand, was likewise a Gentleman, who did not look for the Charges of his Journey: and how could it have been known to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that that <MILESTONE N="40"/> Person had been trusted by the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> if he had not dis∣cover'd it himself?</P>
<P>IN this perplexity, his Majesty would not presently depart from his confidence in the Gentleman accused. As to all other particulars, he confessed himself much satisfied in the information he had receiv'd; ac∣knowledged the great Service; and made all those promises which were necessary in such a Case; <Q>only frankly declared, “that nothing could convince him of the infidelity of that Gentleman, or make him with∣draw his trust from him, but the Evidence of his hand-writing; which” was well known.</Q> This Messenger no sooner return'd to <HI>London,</HI> but <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Accuser clear by pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces the thing by Letters</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> another was dispatch'd with all that manifestation of the truth of what had been before inform'd, that there remain'd no more room to doubt. A great Number of his Letters were sent, whereof the Character was
<PB N="524" REF="5340"/>
well known; and the Intelligence communicated, was of such things as were known to very few besides that Person himself.</P>
<P>ONE thing was observ'd throughout the whole, that he seldom com∣municated any thing in which there was a necessity to name any Man who was of the King's Party, and had been allways so reputed. But what was undertaken by any of the Presbyterian Party, or by any who had been against the King, was poured out to the life. Amongst those, he gave information of <HI>Massey</HI>'s design upon <HI>Glocester,</HI> and of his being concealed in some place near the same. If at any time he named any who had been of the King's Party, it was, chiefly of them who were <MILESTONE N="10"/> satisfied with what they had done, how little soever, and resolv'd to ad∣venture no more. Whereupon very many were imprison'd in several places, and great noise of want of secrecy, or treachery in the King's Councils; which reproach fell upon those who were about the Person of the King.</P>
<P>IT was a new perplexity to the King, that he knew not by what means to communicate this Treachery to his Friends, lest the discovery of it might likewise come to light; which must ruin a Person of merit, and disappoint his Majesty of that Service, which must be of great mo∣ment. In this conjuncture, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> came to <HI>Brussels,</HI> and in∣form'd <MILESTONE N="20"/> his Majesty of all those particulars relating to the posture his friends were in, which are mention'd before; and amongst the other Orders he desired, one was, that some Message might be sent to that knot of Men, <Q>(whereof the accused Person was one) “who, he said, were principally trusted by his Majesty, and were all Men of honour, but so wary and incredulous, that others were more discouraged by their” coldness;</Q> and therefore wished, <Q>“that they might be quicken'd,” and required to concur with the most forward.</Q> Hereupon the King asked him, what he thought of such a one, naming S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Richard Wil∣lis:</HI> <Q>M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> answer'd, “it was of Him they complain'd prin∣cipally; <MILESTONE N="30"/> who, they thought, was the cause of all the wariness in the rest; who looked upon him not only as an excellent Officer, but as a prudent and discreet Man; and therefore, for the most part, all de∣bates were referr'd to him; and he was so much given to objections, and to raising difficulties, and making things unpracticable, that most” Men had an unwillingness to make any proposition to him.</Q> The King asked him, <Q>“”whether he had any suspicion of his want of honesty?</Q> the other answer'd, <Q>“that he was so far from any such suspicion, that, though he did not take him to be his friend, by reason of the many disputes and contradictions frequently between them, he would put his life” <MILESTONE N="40"/> into his hand to morrow.</Q></P>
<P>IT was not thought reasonable, that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> should return into <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King com∣municates the discovery to M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Mordaunt.</NOTE> <HI>England</HI> with a confidence in this Man; and therefore his Majesty freely told him all he knew, but not the way by which he knew it, or that he had his very Letters in his own hand, which would quickly have discover'd how he came by them; <Q>and the King charged him “no farther to communicate with that Person, and to give his friends such caution, as might not give a greater disturbance to his Affairs, by raising new factions amongst them, or provoke him to do more mis∣chief,” which it was in his power to do.</Q> But for all this there was ano∣ther Expedient found; for by the time M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> return'd to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Person who gave the King the Advertisement, out of his own wisdom, and knowledge of the ill consequence of that trust, caused Pa∣pers
<PB N="525" REF="5350"/>
to be posted up in several places, by which all Persons were warned <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Discoverer publishes pa∣pers to fore∣warn the King's friends of this Person</NOTE> not to look upon S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Richard Willis</HI> as faithful to the King, but as one who betrayed all that he was trusted with; which in the general had some effect, though many worthy Men still continued that intimacy with him, and communicated with him all they knew to be resolv'd.</P>
<P>IT was towards the end of <HI>June</HI> that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> left <HI>Brussels,</HI> with a resolution that there should be a general Rendezvous throughout <HI>Eng∣land</HI> of all who would declare for the King, upon a day named, about the middle of <HI>July;</HI> there being Commissions in every County directed to six or seven known Men, with Authority to them to choose one to <MILESTONE N="10"/> Command in Chief in that County, till they should make a conjunction with other Forces, who had a superior Commission from the King. And those Commissioners had in their hands plenty of Commissions under the King's hand, for Regiments and Governments, to distribute to such as they judged sit to receive them; which was the best Model (how liable soever to exception) that, in so distracted a State of Affairs, could be advised.</P>
<P>THE King, as is said, resolv'd at the day appointed to be at <HI>Calais;</HI> which resolution was kept with so great secrecy at <HI>Brussels,</HI> that his Ma∣jesty had left the Town before it was suspected; and when he was <MILESTONE N="20"/> gone, it was as little known whither he was gone; there being as much care taken to have it concealed from being known in <HI>France,</HI> as in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> Therefore, as the King went out in the morning, so the Duke of <HI>York</HI> went out in the afternoon, another way: his Highness's motion being without any suspicion, or notice, by reason of his Command in the Army. The King went attended by the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes to</HI> Calais.</NOTE> Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> (who was the Guide, being well acquainted with the Frontiers on both sides) and two or three Servants, all <HI>incognito,</HI> and as Companions; and so they found their way to <HI>Calais;</HI> where they staid. The Duke of <HI>York,</HI> with four or five of his own menial Servants, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>to</HI> Bou∣logne.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Lord <HI>Langdale,</HI> who desired to attend his Highness, went to <HI>Bou∣logne;</HI> where he remain'd with equal privacy; and they corresponded with each other.</P>
<P>THE Affairs in <HI>England</HI> had no prosperous aspect; every Post brought <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Disap∣pointment of all the designs in</HI> England.</NOTE> News of many Persons of honour and quality committed to several Pri∣sons, throughout the Kingdom, before the day appointed; which did not terrify the rest. The day it self was accompanied with very unusual Weather at that Season of the Year, being the middle of <HI>July.</HI> The night before, there had been an excessive Rain, which continued all the next day, with so terrible a cold high Wind, that the Winter had sel∣dom <MILESTONE N="40"/> so great a Storm: so that the Persons over <HI>England,</HI> who were drawing to their appointed Rendezvous, were much dismayed, and met with many cross Accidents; some mistook the place, and went some whither else; others went where they should be, and were weary of expecting those who should have been there too.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the night, when <HI>Massey</HI> was going for <HI>Glocester,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Massey <HI>seised on, but escapes</HI></NOTE> a Troop of the Army beset the House where he was, and took him Pri∣soner; and putting him before one of the Troopers well guarded, they made hast to carry him to a place where he might be secure. But that tempestuous night had so much of good fortune in it to him, that, in <MILESTONE N="50"/> the darkest part of it, the Troop marching down a very steep Hill, with Woods on both sides, he, either by his activity, or the connivance of the Soldier, who was upon the same Horse with him, sound means, that,
<PB N="526" REF="5360"/>
in the steepest of the descent, they both fell from the Horse, and he dis∣intangled himself from the embraces of the other, and being strong and nimble, got into the Woods, and so escaped out of their hands, though his design was broken.</P>
<P>OF all the Enterprises for the seising upon strong places, only one succeeded; which was that undertaken by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth;</HI> all the rest <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> G. Booth <HI>seised</HI> Chester; <HI>and S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Tho. Middleton <HI>joyns with him.</HI></NOTE> failed. The Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Horatio Townsend,</HI> and most of their Friends, were apprehended before the day, and made Prisoners, most of them upon general suspicions, as Men able to do hurt. Only S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth,</HI> being a Person of the best quality and for∣tune of that County, of those who had never been of the King's party, <MILESTONE N="10"/> came into <HI>Chester,</HI> with such Persons as he thought fit to take with him, the night before: so that though the tempestuousness of the night, and the next morning, had the same effect, as in other places, to break or disorder the Rendezvous, that was appointed withing four or five miles of that City, yet S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George</HI> being himself there with a good Troop of Horse he brought with him, and finding others, though not in the num∣ber he looked for, he retired with those he had into <HI>Chester,</HI> where his Party was strong enough: and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Middleton,</HI> having kept his Rendezvous, came thither to him, and brought strength enough with him to keep those parts at their devotion, and to suppress all there who <MILESTONE N="20"/> had inclination to oppose them.</P>
<P>THEN they published their Declaration, rather against those who <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Decla∣ration.</NOTE> call'd themselves the Parliament, and usurped the Government by the power of the Army, than owning directly the King's Interest. They said, <Q>“that, since God had suffer'd the Spirit of division to continue in this Nation, which was left without any settled foundation of Reli∣gion, Liberty, and Property, the Legislative Power usurped at plea∣sure, the Army raised for it's defence misled by their superiour Offi∣cers, and no face of Government remaining, that was lawfully con∣stituted; therefore, They, being sensible of their duty, and utter ruin, <MILESTONE N="30"/> if these distractions should continue, had taken Arms in vindication of the freedom of Parliaments, of the known Laws, Liberty, and Pro∣perty, and of the good People of this Nation groaning under insup∣portable Taxes: that they cannot despair of the Blessing of God, nor of the chearfull concurrence of all good People, and of the undeceiv'd part of the Army; whose Arrears and future advancement they would” procure,</Q> suffering no imposition or force on any Man's conscience. But though they mention'd nothing of his Majesty in express terms, they gave all countenance, and reception, and all imaginable assurance to the King's Party; who had directions from the King to concur, and <MILESTONE N="40"/> to unite themselves to them.</P>
<P>WHAT disappointments soever there were in other places, the fame of this Action of these two Gentlemen, raised the Spirits of all Men. They who were at liberty, renewed their former designs; and they who could not promise themselves places of refuge, prepared themselves to march to <HI>Chester,</HI> if S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth</HI> did not draw nearer with his Army; which in truth he meant to have done, if the appointments which had been made, had been observ'd. But when he heard that all other places failed, and of the multitude of Persons imprison'd, upon <MILESTONE N="50"/> whose assistance he most depended, he was in great Apprehension that he had begun the work too soon; and though his Numbers increased every day, he thought it best to keep the Post he was in, till he knew what was like to be done elsewhere.</P>
<P><PB N="527" REF="5370"/>
THIS fire was kindled in a place which the Parliament least suspected; and therefore they were the more alarm'd at the News of it; and knew it would spread far, if it were not quickly quenched; and they had now too soon use of their Army, in which they had not confidence. There were many Officers whom they had much rather trust than <HI>Lambert;</HI> but there was none they thought could do their business so well: so <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment sends</HI> Lambert <HI>a∣gainst them</HI></NOTE> they made choice of Him to march with such Troops as he liked, and with the greatest expedition, to suppress this new Rebellion, which they saw had many friends. They had formerly sent for two Regiments out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which, they knew, were devoted to the Republican In∣terest, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and those they appointed <HI>Lambert</HI> to joyn with. He undertook the Charge very willingly, being desirous to renew his credit with the Soldiers, who had loved to be under his Command, because, though he was strict in discipline, he provided well for them, and was himself esteem'd brave upon any Action. He cared not to take any thing with him that might hinder his march; which he resolv'd should be very swift, to prevent the increase of the Enemy in Numbers. And he did make incredible hast; so that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth</HI> found he was in less than a day's march, before he thought he could have been half the way. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George</HI> himself had not been acquainted with the War, and the Offi∣cers <MILESTONE N="20"/> who were with him, were not of one mind or humour; yet all were desirous to fight (the natural infirmity of the Nation, which could never endure the view of an Enemy without engaging in a Bat∣tle) and instead of retiring into the Town, which they might have de∣fended against a much greater Army than <HI>Lambert</HI> had with him, longer than he could stay before it, they marched to meet him; and were, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Who routs S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> G. Booth <HI>and takes</HI> Chester</NOTE> after a short Encounter, routed by him, and totally broken: so that, the next day, the Gates of <HI>Chester</HI> were open'd to <HI>Lambert;</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth</HI> himself making his flight in a disguise; but he was taken upon the way, and sent Prisoner to the Tower. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>LAMBERT prosecuted the advantage he had got, and marched into North <HI>Wales,</HI> whither S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Middleton</HI> was retired with his Troops to a strong Castle of his own; and he thought neither the Man, nor the place, were to be left behind him. It was to no purpose for one Man to oppose the whole Kingdom, where all other Persons appeared subdued. And therefore, after a day or two making shew of resistance, <HI>Middleton</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Thomas Middleton <HI>de∣livers up his castle.</HI></NOTE> accepted such conditions as he could obtain, and suffer'd his goodly House, for the strength of the Situation, to be pulled down.</P>
<P>THIS Success put an end to all endeavours of force in <HI>England;</HI> and the Army had nothing to do but to make all Persons Prisoners whose <MILESTONE N="40"/> looks they did not like; so that all Prisons in <HI>England</HI> were fill'd; whilst the Parliament, exalted with their Conquest, consulted what Persons they would execute, and how they should confiscate the rest; by means whereof, they made no doubt they should destroy all Seeds of future Insurrections on the behalf of the King, many of the Nobility being at present in custody. And they resolv'd, if other Evidence was wanting, that the very suspecting them should be sufficient reason to continue them there.</P>
<P>WHEN the King came to <HI>Calais,</HI> where he receiv'd Accounts every day from <HI>England</HI> of what was transacted there, as he was much trou∣bled <MILESTONE N="50"/> with the News he received daily of the imprisonment of his friends, so he was revived with the fame of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth</HI>'s being possessed of <HI>Chester,</HI> and of the Conjunction between him and <HI>Middleton.</HI> They
<PB N="528" REF="5380"/>
were reported to be in a much better posture than in truth they were; and the expectation of some appearance of Troops in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and some other Counties, stood fair; whereupon the King resolv'd to go himself to some other part of <HI>France,</HI> from whence he might securely transport himself into those parts of <HI>England,</HI> where, with least hazard, he might joyn himself with the Troops which were in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣moves to the Coast of</HI> Bre∣tagne.</NOTE> Arms for him, and so went to the Coast of <HI>Bretagne.</HI></P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>York</HI> remain'd at <HI>Boulogne,</HI> to expect some appearance of Armes in <HI>Kent,</HI> and <HI>Essex;</HI> which was still promised, assoon as the Army should be drawn farther from <HI>London.</HI> In this expectation, his <MILESTONE N="10"/> Royal Highness found an opportunity to confer with his old friend Mar∣shal <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>confers with Monsieur</HI> Turenne, <HI>who offers As∣sistance.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Turenne;</HI> who very frankly assign'd him some Troops; and like∣wise provided Vessels to transport them, if an opportunity had invited him to an Engagement in any probable Enterprise; and this with so much generosity and secrecy, that the Cardinal, who was then upon the Borders of <HI>Spain,</HI> should have had no notice of the preparation, till it was too late to prevent the effect thereof. But it pleased God, that, whilst his Highness was providing for his longed for Expedition, and when the King, after his visiting S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Maloes,</HI> was at <HI>Rochel,</HI> in hope to find a conveniency for his transportation, the fatal News arriv'd in all <MILESTONE N="20"/> parts of the defeat of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth,</HI> and of the total and entire sup∣pression <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣ceives Newe of S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> G Booth<HI>'s deseat.</HI></NOTE> of all kind of opposition to the power of the Parliament; which seem'd now to be in as absolute possession of the Government of the three Nations, as ever <HI>Cromwell</HI> had been.</P>
<P>STRUCK with this dismal relation, the King and his Brother seem'd to have nothing else to do, but to make what hast they could out of <HI>France;</HI> where it was thought they could not now be found with safety. The Duke of <HI>York</HI> return'd speedily to <HI>Brussels;</HI> but the King, less de∣jected <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke re∣turns to</HI> Brus∣sels. <HI>The King resolves to be at the meeting of the two Fa∣vourites of the two Crowns</HI></NOTE> than might have been expected from the extreme despair of his condition, resumed a resolution he had formerly taken, to make a jour∣ney <MILESTONE N="30"/> himself to the Borders of <HI>Spain,</HI> to sollicite more powerful Supplies; the two Chief Ministers of the two Crowns being there met at this time. And indeed his Majesty prefer'd any peregrination before the neglect he was sure to find at <HI>Brussels,</HI> and the dry looks of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there; who were broken into so many factions amongst themselves, that the Government was hardly in a state to subsist; and the Marquis of <HI>Carra∣cena,</HI> and <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> had such an influence upon the Counsels at <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI> that <HI>Don Juan</HI> receiv'd Orders without delay to return to <HI>Spain,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Don Juan re∣call'd to</HI> Spain.</NOTE> and to leave the Government in the hands of the Marquis of <HI>Carracena;</HI> which <HI>Don Juan</HI> very unwillingly obeyed; and assoon as he could ob∣tain <MILESTONE N="40"/> a Pass to go through <HI>France,</HI> he left those Provinces, and made his journey through that Kingdom towards <HI>Madrid.</HI> He was a Person of a small Stature, but well made, and of great vivacity in his looks; his parts very good, both natural and acquired, in fancy and judgement. And if he had not been restrain'd by his Education, and accustom'd to the pride and forms of a <HI>Spanish</HI> breeding, which likewise disposed him to laziness and taking his pleasure, he was capable of any great employ∣ment, and would have discharged it well.</P>
<P>I SAID before, the Chief Ministers of the two Crowns were now met on the Borders of the two Kingdoms. For, this year, some thing <MILESTONE N="50"/> had happen'd abroad, that, as it was new, might seem to administer new hopes to raise the King's Spirits; however, it was a subject for Men to exercise their thoughts on with variety of conjectures. The War had
<PB N="529" REF="5390"/>
now continued between the two Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> for near the space of thirty years, to the scandal, and reproach of Christianity, and in spight of all the interposition and mediation of most of the Princes of <HI>Europe;</HI> a War wantonly enter'd into, without the least pretence of right and justice, to comply with the pride and humour of the two Fa∣vourites of the Crowns (besides the natural animosity, which will all∣ways be between the two Nations) who would try the Mastery of their wit and invention, at the charge of their Master's Treasure, and the blood of their Subjects, against all the obligations of Leagues and Al∣liances; a War prosecuted only for War's sake, with all the circum∣stances <MILESTONE N="10"/> of fire, sword, and rapine, to the consumption of Millions of treasure, and Millions of lives of noble, worthy, and honest Men, only to improve the skill, and mystery, and science of destruction. All which appear'd the more unnatural and the more monstrous, that this seem'd to be affected, and carried on by the power of a Brother and Sister against each other (for half the time had been spent in the Regency of the Queen of <HI>France)</HI> when they both lov'd, and tender'd each others good, and happiness, as the best Brother and Sister ought to do.</P>
<P>IT was high time to put an end to this barbarous cruel War, which the Queen Mother had long and passionately desired in vain. But now <MILESTONE N="20"/> being more struck in years, and troubled with the infirmities of Age, and the young King being of years ripe to marry, and the Infanta of <HI>Spain</HI> being in that, and all other respects, the most competent Match for him, which would be the best, and was the only Expedient to pro∣cure <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen Mother of</HI> France <HI>designs to put an end to the War between the two Crowns, by a Treaty and Marriage.</HI></NOTE> a Peace, her Majesty resolv'd to imploy all her Interest, and Au∣thority, to bring it to pass; and knowing well, all Her desires could produce no effect, if she had not the full concurrence of the Cardinal, she proposed it to him with all the warmth, and all the concernment such a Subject required; <Q>conjuring him “by all the good offices she had perform'd towards him, that he would, not only consent to it, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">She advises the Cardinal to concur in it</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"/> take it to heart, and put it into such a way of Negotiation, that it” might arrive at the issue she desired.</Q></P>
<P>THE Cardinal used all the Arguments he could, to disswade her Ma∣jesty <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Argu∣ments against it.</NOTE> from desiring it at this time; <Q>“that it would not be for her Majesty's Service; nor was he able to bear the reproach, of being the Instrument of making a Peace, at a time when <HI>Spain</HI> was reduced to those streights, that it could no longer resist the victorious Armes of <HI>France;</HI> that they could not fail the next Summer of being possessed of <HI>Brussels</HI> it self, and then they should not be long without the rest of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ne∣therlands; and therefore, at this time, to propose a Peace, which must <MILESTONE N="40"/> disappoint them of so sure a Conquest, would not only be very in∣grateful to the Army, but incense all good <HI>French-</HI>men against him,” and against her Majesty her self.</Q></P>
<P>THE Queen was not diverted from her purpose by those Arguments; but proposed it to the King, and prosecuted it with the Cardinal, that, as himself confessed to his intimate friends, he was necessitated either to consent to it, or to have an irreconcilable breach with her Majesty; which his gratitude would not suffer him to choose; and thereupon he <NOTE PLACE="marg">But at last He yields to her purpose.</NOTE> vielded; and <HI>Don Antonio Pimentel</HI> from <HI>Madrid,</HI> and <HI>Monsieur de Lyonne</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> so negotiated this last Winter in both Courts, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Treaty is transacted first</HI> incognito <HI>at</HI> Paris <HI>and</HI> Madrid.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> both, <HI>incognito,</HI> making several Journies backward and forward, and with that effect, that, by the end of the Winter, it was published, there would be a Treaty between the two Crowns, and that, in the beginning of the
<PB N="530" REF="5400"/>
Summer of this year 1659, the two Favourites, Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> and <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> would meet, and make a Treaty both for the Peace, and the Marriage.</P>
<P>THE Cardinal was the sooner induced to this Peace by the unsettled <NOTE PLACE="marg">The reasons that moved the Cardinal to yield to this Peace.</NOTE> condition of <HI>England.</HI> The death of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> with whom he had con∣certed many things to come, had much perplexed him; yet the Suc∣cession of <HI>Richard,</HI> under the advice of the same Persons who were trusted by his Father, pleased him well. But then the throwing him out with such circumstances, broke all his Measures. He could not forget that the Parliament, that now govern'd, were the very same Men who had <MILESTONE N="10"/> eluded all his Application, appear'd ever more inclined to the <HI>Spanish</HI> side, and had, without any colour of provocation, and when he believ'd they stood fair towards <HI>France,</HI> taken the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, when it could not but have reliev'd <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> by which that Town was deliver'd up to the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> He knew well, that <HI>Spain</HI> did, at that instant, use all the underhand means they could to make a Peace with them; and he did not believe, that the Parliament would affect the continuance of that War, at so vast a charge both at Sea and Land; but that they would rather foment the Divisions in <HI>France,</HI> and endeavour to unite the Prince of <HI>Condè</HI> and the Hugonots; which would make a concussion in <MILESTONE N="20"/> that Kingdom; and he should then have cause to repent the having put <HI>Dunkirk</HI> into the hands of the <HI>English.</HI> These reflections disturbed him, and disposed him at last to believe, that, over and above the benefit of gratifying the Queen, he should best provide for the security of <HI>France,</HI> and of Himself, by making a Peace with <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, he was not so sure of bringing it to pass, as to provoke, or neglect <HI>England.</HI> Therefore he renew'd all the promises, he had for∣merly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His promises to</HI> Lockhart <HI>touchin his adhering to the Parlia∣ment.</HI></NOTE> made to <HI>Oliver,</HI> <Q>again to <HI>Lockhart</HI> (who was the Embassadour now of the Republick) “that he would never make a Peace without the” consent, and inclusion of <HI>England;</HI></Q> and very earnestly desired him, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> writ to that purpose to the Parliament, that he might be at the Treaty with him, that so they might still consult what would be best for their joynt Interest, from which he would never separate; insinuating to him, in broken and half Sentences, <Q>“that though the Treaty was necessary to satisfy the Queen, there were so many difficulties in view, that he had” little hope of a Peace:</Q> and, in truth, many sober Men did not believe the Treaty would ever produce a Peace: for, besides the great Advan∣tages which <HI>France</HI> had gotten, and that it could not be imagined, that <HI>Spain</HI> would ever consent to the relinquishing all those important places to the <HI>French,</HI> which they had then in their hands by Conquest (the <MILESTONE N="40"/> usual Effect of Peace being a restitution of all places taken in the War; which <HI>France</HI> would never permit) there were two particulars which it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Two particu∣lars of difficul∣ty in the Trea∣ty referr'd to the personal conference be∣tween the Fa∣vourites.</NOTE> was hard to find any Expedient to compose, and which, notwithstand∣ing all the preparations made by <HI>de Lyonne</HI> and <HI>Pimentel,</HI> were entirely reserv'd for the Treaty of the two Favourites; both Sides having, with great obstinacy, protested against the departing from the resolution they had taken.</P>
<P>THE two particulars were those concerning <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the Prince <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first, the business of</HI> Portugal.</NOTE> of <HI>Condè.</HI> There could not be a greater Engagement, than <HI>France</HI> had made to <HI>Portugal,</HI> never to desert it, nor to make a Peace without pro∣viding <MILESTONE N="50"/> that that King should quietly enjoy his Government to him and his Posterity, without being in the least degree subject to the Yoke of <HI>Spain.</HI> And <HI>Spain</HI> was principally induced to buy a Peace upon hard
<PB N="531" REF="5410"/>
terms, that it might be at liberty to take revenge of <HI>Portugal;</HI> which they allways reckon'd they should be able to do within one year, if they had no other Enemy upon them; and they would never value any Peace, if That were not entirely left to them, and disclaimed by <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>ON the other hand, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s word <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The second, that of the Prince of</HI> Conde</NOTE> and obligation, by the most solemn Treaty that could be enter'd into, that he would never conclude a Peace without including Him, and all who adhered to him, not only to a full restitution to their Honours, Offices, and Estates, but with some farther recompence for the great Service he had done; which was very great indeed: and no body be∣lieved, <MILESTONE N="10"/> that the Cardinal would ever consent to the restoration of that Prince, who had wrought him so many calamities, and brought him to the brink of destruction. With these ill presages, great preparations were made for this Treaty, and the time and the place were agreed on, when, and where the two great Favourites should meet. <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fuentarabia <HI>the place of Interview.</HI></NOTE> a place in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions, very near the Borders of <HI>France,</HI> the same place where <HI>Francis</HI> the first was deliver'd, after his long impri∣sonment in <HI>Spain,</HI> was agreed upon for their interview; a little River near that place parting both the Kingdoms; and a little building of boards over it, brought the two Favourites to meet, without either of <MILESTONE N="20"/> their going out of his Master's Dominions.</P>
<P>THE fame of this Treaty, assoon as it was agreed to, had yielded va∣riety, and new Matter to the King to consider. Both Crowns had made the contention and War that was between them, the only ground and reason, why they did not give him that Assistance, which in a case so nearly relating to themselves, he might well expect; and both had made many professions, that, when it should please God to release them from that War, they would manifest to the world, that they took the King's case to be their own: so that his Majesty might very rea∣sonably promise himself some advantage and benefit from this Peace, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and the world could not but expect, that he would have some Embassa∣dour present to sollicite on his behalf. There were so many difficulties to find a fit Person, and so many greater to defray the expence of an Embassadour, that his Majesty had at first resolv'd to find himself pre∣sent <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re∣solves to be present at is</NOTE> in that Treaty; which resolution he kept very private, though he was shortly after confirm'd in it by a Letter from S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Bennet;</HI> by which he was inform'd, <Q>“that he speaking with <HI>Don Lewis</HI> about his Journey to <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> and asking him whether he would give him leave to wait on him thither, <HI>Don Lewis</HI> answer'd, that he should do well to be present; and then asked him, why the King himself would <MILESTONE N="40"/> not be there; and two or three days after, he told him, that if the King, with a very light train, came <HI>incognito</HI> thither, for the place could not permit them to receive him in State, after the great diffi∣culties of the Treaty were over, he would do all he could to induce the Cardinal co concur in what might be of convenience to his Maje∣sty.”</Q> The King had before resolv'd to have a very little train with him, suitable to the treasure he had to defray his expences, and to make his whole Journey <HI>incognito,</HI> and not to be known in any place through which he was to pass. But he was troubled what he was to do with re∣ference to <HI>France,</HI> through which he was necessarily to make his Jour∣ney. <MILESTONE N="50"/> How much <HI>incognito</HI> soever he meant to travail, it might be ne∣cessary against any accident to have a Pass; yet to ask one, and be re∣fused, would be worse than going without one. Though he expected
<PB N="532" REF="5420"/>
much less from the Nature of the Cardinal, than from the sincerity of <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> yet the former was able to do him much more good than the latter; and therefore care was to be taken that he might have no cause to find himself neglected, and that more depending upon <HI>Spain</HI> might not irreconcile <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>TO extricate himself out of these perplexities, his Majesty had writ∣ten to the Queen his Mother, to intreat her, <Q>“as of her self, to desire the Cardinal's advice, whether it would not be fit for the King to be present at the Treaty; that she might send his Majesty such counsel as was proper: if he thought well of it, she might then propose such Passes,” <MILESTONE N="10"/> as should seem reasonable to her.</Q> Her Majesty accordingly took an op∣portunity to ask the Question of the Cardinal; who, at the very motion, told her very warmly, <Q>“that it was by no means fit; and that it would” do the King much harm;</Q> <Q>and afterwards, recollecting himself, he wish'd the Queen “to let the King know, that he should rely upon him to take <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cardinal</HI> Ma∣zarin <HI>advises against it.</HI></NOTE> care of what concern'd him; which he would not fail to do, assoon as” he discern'd that the Treaty would produce a Peace.</Q> Her Majesty ac∣quiesced with this profession, and sent the King word, how kind the Cardinal was to him; but would by no means that his Majesty should think of undertaking such a journey himself; nor did the Queen ima∣gine <MILESTONE N="20"/> that the King would ever think of it without a Pass, and the Car∣dinal's approbation.</P>
<P>WHEN his Majesty had received this Account from his Mother, he saw it was to no purpose to think of a Pass. And thus far, in the begin∣ning of this last Spring, before any design of rising in <HI>England</HI> was ri∣pened, his Majesty had proceeded in his intention of being personally present at the Conference between the two great Ministers. But now, when all his expectations from <HI>England</HI> for this year were defeated, and when he himself was already advanced far into <HI>France,</HI> he thought it more necessary than ever to take up his former resolution. Being <MILESTONE N="30"/> therefore by this time fully advertised, that the Favourites had been met a considerable time, and were enter'd so far into the Treaty, in the very entrance of which they had agreed to a Cessation of Arms, his Majesty attended by the same Company he had then with him, the Marquis of <HI>Ormond, Daniel O Neile,</HI> and two or three other Servants, together with the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> (though S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> had before informed the King, that <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> had particularly desired he would not bring that Earl with him; whose Company yet, in re∣spect of his Language, the King believ'd would be very convenient to him) his Majesty, I say, with this Attendance, began his journey from <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King be∣gins his jour∣ney thither with the Mar∣quis of</HI> Or∣mond, <HI>and the Earl of</HI> Bristol.</NOTE> that part of <HI>Bretagne</HI> where he then was still <HI>incognito.</HI> He had indeed now more reason than ever to conceal himself in his journey, and really to apprehend being stopp'd if he were discover'd; and therefore was not to go about by <HI>Paris,</HI> or any of those roads where he had been hereto fore known; yet he allowed himself the more time, that he might in his compass see those parts of <HI>France</HI> where he had never been before, and indeed give himself all the pleasure, and divertisement, that such a journey would admit of. To that purpose he appointed the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> to be the Guide; who knew most of <HI>France,</HI> at least more than any body else did; and who allways delighted to go out of the way; and <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>Daniel O Neile</HI> to take care that they allways fared well in their Lodgings; for which Province no Man was fitter. Thus they wheeled about by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He goes by</HI> Lyons <HI>into</HI> Languedoc; <HI>and so on∣ward.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lyons</HI> into <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and were so well pleased with the varieties in
<PB N="533" REF="5430"/>
the journey, that they not enough remember'd the end of it, taking their information of the Progress in the Treaty from the Intelligence they met with in the way.</P>
<P>WHEN they came near <HI>Toulouse,</HI> they found that the <HI>French</HI> Court was there, which they purposely design'd to decline. However the King, going himself a nearer way, sent the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> thither, to in∣form himself of the true State of the Treaty, and to meet his Majesty again at a place appointed, that was the direct way to <HI>Fuentarabia.</HI> The Marquis went alone without a Servant, that he might be the less suspected; and when he came to <HI>Toulouse,</HI> he was inform'd from the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Common discourse of the Court, that the Treaty was upon the matter concluded, and that the Cardinal was expected there within less than a week.</P>
<P>IT was very true, all matters of difficulty were over in less time than <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the Close of that Treaty in respect of the difficulties con∣cerning</HI> Por∣tugal <HI>and the Prince of</HI> Conde</NOTE> was conceiv'd possible, both Parties equally desiring the Marriage, which could never be without the Peace. The Cardinal, who had much the advantage over <HI>Don Lewis</HI> in all the faculties necessary for a Treaty, excepting probity and punctuality in observing what he promised, had used all the Arts imaginable to induce <HI>Don Lewis</HI> to yield both in the point of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and what related to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and his <MILESTONE N="20"/> Party. <Q>He enlarged upon “the desperate estate in which <HI>Flanders</HI> was; and that they could possess themselves entirely of it in one Campagne; and therefore it might easily be concluded, that nothing but the Queen's absolute Authority, could in such a conjuncture have disposed the King to a Treaty; and, he hoped, that she should not be so ill re∣quited, as to be obliged to break the Treaty, or to oblige the King her Son to consent to what was indispensably against his honour: that if he should recede from the Interest of <HI>Portugal,</HI> no Prince or State would hereafter enter into Alliance with him: that though they were bound to insist to have <HI>Portugal</HI> included in the Peace, yet he would be contented that a long Truce might be made, and all Acts of Hosti∣lity <MILESTONE N="30"/> forborne for a good Number of years, which, he said, was ne∣cessary for <HI>Spain,</HI> that they might recover the fatigue of the long War they had sustain'd, before they enter'd into a New One: if they would not consent to that, then that <HI>Portugal</HI> should be left out of the Peace, and <HI>Spain</HI> at liberty to prosecute the War, and <HI>France</HI> at the same time to assist <HI>Portugal,</HI> which, he said, in respect of the distance, they should never be able to administer in such a proportion as would be able to preserve it from their Conquest; not without insinuation, that, so they might not renounce the promise they had made, they <MILESTONE N="40"/> would not be oversollicitous to perform it. As to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> that the Catholick King was now to look upon <HI>France</HI> as the Domi∣nion of his Son in Law, and to be inherited by his Grandson, and therefore he would consider what peril it might bring to both, if the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> were restored to his greatness in that Kingdom, who only could disturb the Peace of it, and whose ambition was so restless, that they could no longer enjoy Peace, than whilst he was not in a” condition to interrupt it.</Q> The Cardinal told him, in confidence, of several Indignities offer'd by the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> to the Person of the Queen, of which her Brother ought to be very sensible, and which <MILESTONE N="50"/> would absolve him from any Engagement he had enter'd into with that Prince; which he would never have done, if his Majesty had been fully inform'd of those rude transgressions. And therefore he besought <HI>Don</HI>
<PB N="534" REF="5440"/>
<HI>Lewis,</HI> <Q>“that the joy and triumph, which the King and the Queen would be possessed of by this Peace and Marriage, might not be clouded, and even render'd disconsolate, by their being bound to behold a Man in their presence, who had so often, and with so much damage, and disdain, affronted them both; but that the Peace of <HI>France</HI> might be secured by that Prince's being for ever restrain'd from living in it; which being provided for, whatsoever his Catholick Majesty should require in ready Money, or Pensions, to enable the Prince to live in” his just splendour abroad, should be consented to.</Q></P>
<P>DON <HI>Lewis de Haro</HI> was a Man of great temper, of a sallow com∣plection, <MILESTONE N="10"/> Hypocondriac, and never weary of hearing; thought well of what he was to say; what he wanted in acuteness he made up in wa∣riness; and though he might omit the saying somewhat he had a good occasion to say, he never said any thing of which he had occasion to re∣pent. He had a good judgement and understanding, and as he was with∣out any talent of Rhetoric, so he was very well able to defend himself from it. <Q>He told the Cardinal, “that he knew well his Master's Affairs needed a Peace with <HI>France;</HI> and that the accomplishing this Mar∣riage, was the only way to attain it: that the Marriage was the best, and the most honourable in Christendom, and ought to be equally de∣fired <MILESTONE N="20"/> on both sides; that his Catholick Majesty was sensible of his own age, and the infirmities which attended it; and desired nothing more than that, before his death, he might see this Peace and this Marriage finished, and made perfect; and that he was well content to purchase the former at any price, but of his Honour; which was the only thing he preferr'd even before Peace: that for <HI>Portugal,</HI> the groundless Re∣bellion there was so well known to all the world, that he should not go to his Grave in peace, if he should do any thing which might look like a countenance, or concession to that Title, that was only founded upon Treason and Rebellion; or if he should omit the doing any thing that might, with God's blessing, of which he could not doubt, reduce <MILESTONE N="30"/> that Kingdom to their duty, and his obedience: that his resolution was, assoon as this Peace should be concluded, to apply all the Force and all the Treasure of his Dominions, to the invasion of <HI>Portugal;</HI> which, he hoped, would be sufficient speedily to subdue it; and was a great part of the fruit he promised himself from this peace; and therefore he would never permit any thing to be concluded in it, that might leave <HI>France</HI> at liberty to assist that War: that the Catholick King had done all he could, both by <HI>Don Antonio Pimentel</HI> and <HI>Mon∣sieur de Lyonne,</HI> that his most Christian Majesty might know his unalter∣able <MILESTONE N="40"/> resolution in the point of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and with reference to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> before He consented to treat; and that he would never de∣part from what he had declared in either: that He had made a Treaty with the Prince of <HI>Conde;</HI> by which he had engaged himself never to desert his Interest, nor to make a Peace without providing for his full restitution, and reparation, and of those who had run his fortune, and put themselves under his Protection: that the Prince had per∣formed all he had undertaken to do, and had render'd very great Ser∣vice to his Catholick Majesty; who would not only rather lose <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> but his Crown likewise, than fail in any particular which he was” <MILESTONE N="50"/> bound to make good to the Prince:</Q> <Q>and therefore he desired the Car∣dinal “to acquiesce in both these particulars, from which he should not” recede in a Tittle; in others, he would not have the same obstinacy.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="535" REF="5450"/>
WHEN the Cardinal found that all his Art, and crafty Eloquence, were lost upon <HI>Don Lewis</HI>'s want of Politeness; and that he could not bend him in the least degree in either of these important particulars, he resolv'd they should pay otherwise for their Idol Honour, and Pun∣ctuality; and after he had brought him to consent to the detention of all the places they had taken, as well in <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> as <HI>Flanders,</HI> and all other Provinces, by which they dismember'd all the <HI>Spanish</HI> Domi∣nions in those parts, and kept themselves nearer Neighbours to the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> than the other desired they should be, he compelled them, <MILESTONE N="10"/> though a thing very foreign to the Treaty, to deliver the Town of <HI>Ju∣liers</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> without the payment of any Money for what they had laid out upon the Fortifications; which they could otherwise claim. It is very true, that Town did belong of right to the Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> as part of the Duchy of <HI>Juliers,</HI> which was de∣scended to him. But it is as true, that it was preserv'd by <HI>Spain,</HI> from being possessed by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> many years before, and by Treaty to remain in their hands, till they should receive satisfaction for all their disbursements. After which time, they erected the Citadel there, and much mended the Fortifications. And this dependence, and expecta∣tion, <MILESTONE N="20"/> had kept that Prince fast to all the <HI>Spanish</HI> Interest in <HI>Germany:</HI> whereas, by the wresting it now out of their hands, and frankly giving it up to the true Owner, they got the entire devotion of the Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and so a new friend to strengthen their Alliance upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which was before inconvenient enough to <HI>Spain,</HI> by stopping the resort of any <HI>German</HI> Succours into <HI>Flanders.</HI> And if, at any time to come, the <HI>French</HI> shall purchase <HI>Juliers</HI> from the Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> as upon many Accidents he may be induced to part with it, they will be possessed of the most advantageous Post to facilitate their enterprises upon <HI>Liege,</HI> or <HI>Cologne,</HI> or to disturb the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Maestricht,</HI> or to seise upon <HI>Aquisgrane,</HI> an Imperial Town; and, in∣deed, to disturb the Peace of <HI>Christendom.</HI></P>
<P><Q>OF <HI>Portugal</HI> no other care was taken in the Treaty, than that after the <HI>French</HI> King had pompously declared, “he would have given up all his Conquests by the War, provided the King of <HI>Spain</HI> would have consented that all things should remain in <HI>Portugal</HI> as they were at that” present (which Proposition,</Q> <Q>twas said, his Catholick Majesty had ab∣solutely refused) now “the Most Christian King should be allow'd three Months time, counting from the day of the Ratification of the Treaty, wherein he might try to dispose the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to satisfy his Catho∣lick <MILESTONE N="40"/> Majesty. But after those three Months should be expired, if his good offices should not produce the effect desired, then neither his Most Christian Majesty nor his Successours should give the <HI>Portuguese</HI> any aid or assistance, publickly or secretly, directly or indirectly, by” Sea or Land, or in any other manner whatsoever.</Q> And this the in∣genuity of the Cardinal thought could never be called renouncing of the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Interest.</P>
<P>To the Prince of <HI>Condè</HI> all things were yielded which had been in∣sisted on; and full recompence made to such of his Party as could not be restored to their Offices; as President <HI>Viole,</HI> and some others: yet <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>Don Lewis</HI> would not sign the Treaty, till he had sent an Express to the Prince of <HI>Condè,</HI> to inform him of all the particulars, and had re∣ceiv'd his full approbation. And even then, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> caused a great Sum of Money to be paid to him, that he might discharge all the
<PB N="536" REF="5460"/>
debts which he had contracted in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and reward his Officers, who were to be disbanded; a Method <HI>France</HI> did not use at the same time to their Proselytes, but left <HI>Catalonia</HI> to their King's Chastisement, without any provision made for <HI>Don Josepho de Margarita,</HI> and others, who had been the principal Contrivers of those disturbances; and were left to eat the bread of <HI>France;</HI> where it is administer'd to them very sparingly, without any hope of ever seeing their Native Country again, except they make their way thither by fomenting a new Rebellion.</P>
<P>WHEN all things were concluded, and the Engrossments preparing, the Cardinal came one morning into <HI>Don Lewis</HI> his Chamber with a sad <MILESTONE N="10"/> Countenance; and told him, <Q>“they had lost all their pains, and the” Peace could not be concluded.</Q> <Q>At which <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> in much distur∣bance, asked, “”what the matter was?</Q> the Cardinal very composedly an∣swer'd, <Q>“that it must not be; that they two were too good Catholicks to do any thing against the Pope's infallibility, which would be called in question by this Peace; since his Holyness had declared, that there” would be no Peace made;</Q> as indeed he had done, after he had, from the first hour of his Pontificate, labour'd it for many years, and found himself still deluded by the Cardinal, who had yet promised him, that, when the Season was ripe for it, he should have the sole power to con∣clude <MILESTONE N="20"/> it; so that when he heard that the two Favourites were to meet, of which he had no Notice, he said in the Consistory, <Q>“that he was sure” that Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> would not make a Peace.</Q> <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was glad that there was no other objection against it; and so all the Company made themselves merry at the Pope's charge.</P>
<P>WHEN the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> discover'd by the information he receiv'd at <HI>Toulouse,</HI> that the Treaty was so near an end, he made all possible hast to the place the King had appointed to meet at, that his Majesty might lose no more time. When he came thither, he found no body; which he imputed to the usual delays in their journey; and <MILESTONE N="30"/> stayed one whole day in expectation of them; but then concluded that they were gone forward some other way, and so thought it his business to hasten to <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> where he heard nothing of the King. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> was in great perplexity, and complain'd, very reasonably, that the King neglected his own business in such a conjuncture, the benefit whereof was lost by his not coming. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> seem'd to wonder, that the King had not come thither, whilst the Cardinal and He were toge∣ther. The Treaty was now concluded; and though the Cardinal remain'd still at his old Quarters on the <HI>French</HI> side, under some indisposition of the Gout, yet He and <HI>Don Lewis</HI> were to meet no more. But <HI>Don</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Lewis</HI> was the less troubled that the King had not come sooner, because he had found the Cardinal, as often as he had taken occasion to speak of the King, very cold, and reserv'd; and he had magnified the power of the Parliament, and seem'd to think his Majesty's hopes desperate; and advised <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> <Q>“to be wary how he embarked himself in an Affair that had no foundation; and that it was rather time for all Ca∣tholicks to unite to the breaking the power and interest of the Here∣tical Party, wherever it was, than to strengthen it by restoring the” King, except He would become Catholick.</Q> And it is believ'd by Wise Men, that, in that Treaty, somewhat was agreed to the prejudice of <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Protestant Interest; and that, in a short time, there would have been much done against it both in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> if the mea∣sures they had there taken had not been shortly broken; chiefly by the
<PB N="537" REF="5470"/>
surprising Revolution in <HI>England</HI> (which happen'd the next year) and also by the death of the two great Favourites of the two Crowns, <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Mazarin;</HI> who both died not very long after it; the Cardinal, probably, struck with the wonder, if not the agony of that undream'd of prosperity of our King's Affairs; as if he had taken it ill, and laid it to heart, that God Almighty would bring such a work to pass in <HI>Europe,</HI> without his concurrence, and even against all his Machinations.</P>
<P>DURING the whole time of the Treaty, <HI>Lockhart</HI> had been at <HI>Bayonne,</HI> and frequently consulted with the Cardinal, and was by him brought to <MILESTONE N="10"/> <HI>Don Lewis</HI> twice or thrice, where they spoke of the mutual benefit that would redound to both, if a Peace were settled between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>England.</HI> But the Cardinal treated <HI>Lockhart</HI> (who was in all other oc∣casions too hard for him) in such a manner, that, till the Peace was upon the matter concluded, he did really believe it would not be made (as appear'd by some of his Letters from <HI>Bayonne,</HI> which fell into the King's hands) and to the last he was perswaded, that <HI>England</HI> should be com∣prehended in it, in terms to its satisfaction.</P>
<P>THE King, the next day after he had sent the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> to <HI>Toulouse,</HI> receiv'd information upon the way, that the Treaty was <MILESTONE N="20"/> absolutely ended, and that <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was return'd to <HI>Madrid;</HI> to which giving credit, he concluded, that it would be to no purpose to prosecute his journey to <HI>Fuentarabia;</HI> and therefore was easily per∣swaded by the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> to take the nearest way to <HI>Madrid,</HI> by entring into <HI>Spain</HI> assoon as they could; presuming that the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> would quickly conclude whither they were gone, and follow his Majesty. With this resolution, and upon this Intelligence, they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King by mistake went into</HI> Spain <HI>as far as to</HI> Sa∣ragosa.</NOTE> continued their journey till they came to <HI>Saragosa,</HI> the Metropolis of the Kingdom of <HI>Aragon.</HI> Here they receiv'd Advertisement, that the Treaty was not fully concluded, and that <HI>Don Lewis</HI> remain'd still at <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>Fuentarabia.</HI> This was a new perplexity: at last they resolv'd, that the King, and the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> who had still a mind to <HI>Madrid,</HI> should stay at <HI>Saragosa,</HI> whilst <HI>O Neile</HI> should go to <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> and return with direction what course they were to steer.</P>
<P>DON <HI>Lewis,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> were in great confusion with the apprehension that some ill Accident had befallen the King, when M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>O Neile</HI> arriv'd, and inform'd them by what accident, and mis∣intelligence, the King had resolv'd to go to <HI>Madrid,</HI> if he had not been better inform'd at <HI>Saragosa;</HI> where he now remain'd, till he should re∣ceive farther advice. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was in all the disturbance imaginable, <MILESTONE N="40"/> when he heard the relation: he concluded that this was a trick of the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI>'s; that he held some Intelligence with <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and intended to carry the King to <HI>Madrid,</HI> whilst he was absent, with a purpose to affront him, and in hope to transact somewhat without his Privity. They were now to save, and to borrow all the Money they could, to defray the Expences which must be shortly made for the In∣terview, Marriage, and delivery of the Infanta, and all this must be spent upon the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Entry, and Entertainment in <HI>Ma∣drid;</HI> for a King <HI>incognito</HI> was never heard of in <HI>Spain.</HI> The Marriage was concluded, and now another young unmarried King must be re∣ceiv'd, <MILESTONE N="50"/> and caressed in that Court; which would occasion much discourse both in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> All these things his melancholy had made him revolve; nor did he conceal the trouble he endured, from the Mar∣quis
<PB N="538" REF="5480"/>
of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Bennet;</HI> <Q>who assured him, “that all that was past was by meer mistake, and without any purpose to decline” Him, upon whose friendship alone the King absolutely depended;</Q> and undertook positively, <Q>“that assoon as his Majesty should be inform'd of his advice, he would make all the hast thither he could, without thought” of doing any thing else:</Q> which <HI>Don Lewis</HI> desired might be effected assoon as was possible. So <HI>O Neile</HI> return'd to <HI>Saragosa,</HI> and his Majesty, without delay, made his Journey from thence to <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> with as <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence re∣turns to</HI> Fuen∣tarabia. <HI>His Treat∣ment there by</HI> Don Lewis de Haro.</NOTE> much expedition as he could use.</P>
<P>THE King was receiv'd according to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mode and Genero∣sity, and treated with the same respect and reverence that could be <MILESTONE N="10"/> shew'd to his Catholick Majesty himself, if he had been in that place. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> deliver'd all that could be said from the King, his Master; <Q>“how much he was troubled, that the condition of his Affairs, and the necessity that was upon him to make shortly a long journey, would not permit him to invite his Majesty to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and to treat him in that manner that was suitable to his Grandeur: that having happily concluded the Peace, he had now nothing so much in his thoughts, as how he might be able to give, or procure such assistance as his Ma∣jesty stood in need of; and that he should never be destitute of any” thing, that His power and interest could help him to.</Q> <HI>Don Lewis</HI> for <MILESTONE N="20"/> himself made all those professions, which could possibly be expected from him. <Q>He confessed, “that there was no provision made in the Treaty that the two Crowns would jointly assist his Majesty; but, that he believ'd the Cardinal would be ready to perform all good Of∣fices towards him; and that, for his own particular, his Majesty should receive good testimony of the profound veneration he had for” him.</Q></P>
<P>DON <HI>Lewis</HI> intimated a Wish, that his Majesty could yet have some conference with the Cardinal; who was, as is said, still within distance. Whereupon the King sent the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> to visit him, and to <MILESTONE N="30"/> let him know, that his Majesty had a desire to come to him, that he might have some conference with him, and receive his counsel and ad∣vice. But the Cardinal would by no means admit it; <Q>said, “it would administer unseasonable jealousy to the Parliament, without any man∣ner” <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cardinal would not see the King</NOTE> of benefit to the King.</Q> He made many large professions, which he could do well, of his Affection to the King; <Q>desired, “he would have patience till the Marriage should be over, which would be in the next Spring; and till then their Majesties must remain in those parts: but, assoon as that should be dispatched, the whole Court would return to <HI>Paris;</HI> and that he would not be long there, before he gave the King” <MILESTONE N="40"/> some evidence of his kindness and respect:</Q> other answer than this the Marquis could not obtain.</P>
<P>AFTER his Majesty had stayed as long as he thought convenient at <HI>Fuentarabia</HI> (for he knew well that <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was to return to <HI>Ma∣drid</HI> before the King of <HI>Spain</HI> could take any resolution to begin, or order his own journey, and that he stayed there only to entertain his Majesty) he discern'd that he had nothing more to do than to return to <HI>Flanders;</HI> where, he was assured, his reception should be better than it had been. So he declared his resolution to begin his return on such a day. In the short time of his stay there, the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> according <MILESTONE N="50"/> to his excellent talent, which seldom failed him in any exigent, from as great a prejudice as could attend any Man, had wrought himself so
<PB N="539" REF="5490"/>
much into the good graces of all the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was willing to take him with him to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that he should be re∣ceived into the Service of his Catholick Majesty, in such a Province as should be worthy of him. So that his Majesty had now a less Train to return with, the Marquis of <HI>Ormond, Daniel O Neile,</HI> and two or three Servants.</P>
<P>DON <HI>Lewis,</HI> with a million of excuses that their expences had been so great, as had wasted all their Money, presented his Majesty with seven thousand gold Pistoles, <Q>“to defray, as he said, the expences of his” <MILESTONE N="10"/> journey, with assurance,</Q> <Q>“that, when he came into <HI>Flanders,</HI> he should find all necessary Orders for his better accommodation, and” carrying on his business.</Q> So his Majesty begun his journey, and took <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's re∣turn towards</HI> Flanders <HI>by</HI> Paris.</NOTE> <HI>Paris</HI> in his way to visit the Queen his Mother, with whom a good un∣derstanding was made upon removing all former mistakes; and, towards the end of <HI>December,</HI> he return'd to <HI>Brussels</HI> in good health; where he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He came to</HI> Brussels <HI>about the end of</HI> De∣cember.</NOTE> found his two Brothers, the Dukes of <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Glocester,</HI> impatiently expecting him.</P>
<P>THE pleasure and variety of his journey, and the very civil treat∣ment he had receiv'd from <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> with the good disposition he had <MILESTONE N="20"/> left the Queen his Mother in, had very much revived and refreshed the King's Spirit, and the joy for his return dispersed the present Clouds. But he had not been long at <HI>Brussels,</HI> before he discern'd the same me∣lancholy and despair in the Countenances of most Men, which he had left there: and though there had some Changes happen'd in <HI>England,</HI> which might reasonably encourage Men to look for greater, they had so often been disappointed in those Expectations, that it was a reproach to any Man to think that any good could come from thence.</P>
<P>UPON this melancholic conjuncture some about the King began to think of providing a Religion, as well as other conveniences, that might <MILESTONE N="30"/> be grateful to those People and Places, where, and with whom they were like to reside. The Protestant Religion was found to be very unagreea∣ble to their fortune, and they exercised their thoughts most how to get handsomely from it; and if it had not been for the King's own steadi∣ness, of which he gave great indications, Men would have been more out of countenance to have owned the faith they were of; and many made little doubt, but that it would shortly be very manifest to the King, that his Restoration depended wholely upon a conjunction of Catho∣lick Princes, who could never be united, but on the behalf of Catholick Religion.</P>
<P>THE best the King could now look for, seem'd to be a permission to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The all state of his Majesty's Affairs there.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"/> remain in <HI>Flanders,</HI> with a narrow assignation for his bread, which was a melancholic condition for a King; nor could That be depended upon; for there were secret approaches made, both from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> towards a Peace; and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had great reason to desire it, that he might meet with no obstruction in his intended Conquest of <HI>Portugal.</HI> And what influence any Peace might have upon his Maje∣sty's quiet, might reasonably be apprehended. However, there being no War in <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Glocester,</HI> could no longer re∣main in an unactive course of Life; and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had a great <MILESTONE N="50"/> family, impatient to be where they might enjoy plenty, and where they might be absent from the King. And therefore, when the Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> at this time brought the Duke of <HI>York</HI> a Letter from the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>invited into</HI> Spain</NOTE> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> that he would make him <HI>El Admirante del Oceano,</HI> his
<PB N="540" REF="5500"/>
Highness was exceedingly pleased with it, and those about him so trans∣ported with the promotion, that they thought any Man to be a declared Enemy to their Master, who should make any objection against his ac∣cepting it. And when they were told, <Q>“that it was not such a preferment, that the Duke should so greedily embrace it, before he knew what conditions he should be subject to, and what he might expect from it: that the Command had been in a younger Son of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and at another time in a younger Son of the Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> who both grew quickly weary of it; for whatever title they had, the whole Command was in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Officers under them; and that, if the <MILESTONE N="10"/> Duke were there, he might possibly have a competent Pension to live on Shore, but would never be suffer'd to go to Sea under any title of” Command, till he first changed his Religion;</Q> all this had no significa∣tion with them; but they prevailed with his Royal Highness, to re∣turn his consent, and acceptation of the Office, by the same Courier who brought the Letter.</P>
<P><Q>THE Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> likewise told the King, “that he had re∣ceiv'd Orders to put all things in a readiness for his Expedition into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> towards which he would add three thousand Men to those Troops” which his Majesty already had.</Q> At the same time the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Jer∣myn <HI>came to the King with Compliments from the</HI> Car∣dinal.</NOTE> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Walter Mountague,</HI> came to the King from <HI>Paris,</HI> with many Compliments from the Cardinal, <Q>“that when there should be a Peace” between the two Northern Kings (for <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> were now in a War)</Q> <Q><HI>“France</HI> would declare avowedly for the King; but in the mean time they could only assist him under hand; and to that purpose, they had appointed three thousand Men to be ready on the Borders of <HI>France,</HI> to be transported out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and thirty thou∣sand Pistoles to be disposed of by the King to advance that Expedi∣tion.”</Q> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> had sent from <HI>Madrid</HI> a Copy of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Orders to the Marquis of <HI>Carracena;</HI> by which he was not (as he had <MILESTONE N="30"/> told the King) to add three thousand Men to the King's Troops, but to make those which his Majesty had, amount to the Number of three thousand. But that which was strangest, the King must be obliged to embark them in <HI>France.</HI> The Men the Cardinal would provide, must be embarked in <HI>Flanders;</HI> and they who were to be supplied by <HI>Spain,</HI> must be embarked in <HI>France.</HI> So that by these two specious pretences, and profers, the King could only discern, that they were both afraid of offending <HI>England,</HI> and would offer nothing of which his Majesty could make any use, before they might take such a prospect of what was like to come to pass, that they might new form their Counsels. And the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mountague,</HI> had so little expectation of <HI>England,</HI> that they concurr'd both in opinion, that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> should em∣brace the opportunity that was offer'd from <HI>Spain;</HI> to which they made no doubt the Queen would give her consent.</P>
<P>IN this state of despair the King's condition was concluded to be, about the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> old Style, 1659: and though his Majesty, and those few entrusted by him, had reason to believe that God would be more propitions to him, from some great alterations in <HI>England;</HI> yet such imagination was so looked upon as meer dotage, that the King thought not fit to communicate the hopes he had, but left all Men to cast <MILESTONE N="50"/> about for themselves, till they were awaken'd, and confounded by such a prodigious act of Providence, as God hath scarce vouchsafed to any Na∣tion, since he led his own chosen People through the <HI>Red</HI> Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="541" REF="5510"/>
AFTER the defeat of <HI>Booth</HI> and <HI>Middleton,</HI> and the King's hopes <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> England <HI>after the defeat of</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>and</HI> Middleton</NOTE> so totally destroy'd, the Parliament thought of transporting the Loyal Families into the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and other Plantations, lest they might hereafter produce in <HI>England</HI> Children of their Fathers Af∣fections; and, by degrees, so to model their Army that they might never give them more trouble. They had sent <HI>Lambert</HI> a thousand pounds to buy him a Jewel; which he employ'd better by bestowing it among the Officers, who might well deserve it of him. This bounty of his, was quickly known to the Parliament; which concluded, that he in∣tended <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment grow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ealous of</HI> Lambert <HI>Army</HI></NOTE> to make a Party in the Army, that should more depend upon <MILESTONE N="10"/> Him than upon Them. And this put them in mind of his former be∣haviour; and that it was by His advice, that they were first dissolved, and that He in truth had helped to make <HI>Cromwell</HI> Protector, upon his promise that He should succeed him; and that he fell from him only because he had frustrated him of that expectation. They therefore re∣solved to secure him from doing farther harm, assoon as he should come to the Town.</P>
<P>LAMBERT, instead of making hast to them, found some delays in his march (as if all were not safe) to seise upon the Persons of Delin∣quents. He was well informed of their good purposes towards him, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and knew that the Parliament intended to make a peace with all Fo∣reigners, and then to disband their Army, except only some few Regi∣ments, which should consist only of Persons at their own devotion. He foresaw what His portion then must be, and that all the Ill he had done towards them would be remember'd, and the Good forgotten. He there∣fore contrived a Petition, which was sign'd by the inferior Officers of his Army; in which they desired the Parliament, <Q>“that they might be <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Petition and Proposals of</HI> Lambert <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> govern'd, as all Armies used to be, by a General, who might be amongst them, and other Officers, according to their Qualities, subordinate to” him.</Q> The Address was intituled, <HI>The humble Petition and Proposals</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> <HI>of the Army, under the Command of the Lord Lambert, in the late Northern Expedition.</HI></P>
<P><Q>THEY made a large recapitulation of “the many Services they had done, which they thought were forgotten; and that now lately they had preserv'd them from an Enemy, which, if they had been suffer'd to grow, would, in a short time, have overrun the Kingdom, and en∣gaged the Nation in a new bloody War; to which too many Men were” still inclined;</Q> and concluded with a desire, <Q>“that they would commit the Army to <HI>Fleetwood,</HI> as General; and that they would appoint <HI>Lam∣bert”</HI> to be Major General.</Q> <HI>Fleetwood</HI> was a weak Man, but very po∣pular <MILESTONE N="40"/> with all the praying part of the Army; a Man, whom the Par∣liament would have trusted, if they had not resolv'd to have no Gene∣ral, being as confident of his fidelity to them, as of any Man's; and <HI>Lambert</HI> knew well he could govern him, as <HI>Cromwell</HI> had done <HI>Fair∣fax,</HI> and then in the like manner lay him aside. This Petition was sent by some trusty Person to some Colonels of the Army, in whom <HI>Lam∣bert</HI> had confidence, to the end that they should deliver it to <HI>Fleetwood,</HI> to be by him presented first to the Council of Officers, and afterwards to the Parliament. He resolv'd first to consult with some of his friends for Their advice; and so it came to the notice of <HI>Haslerig,</HI> <Q>who imme∣diately <MILESTONE N="50"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This Petition discove'd to</HI> Haslerig, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the House with it</HI></NOTE> inform'd the Parliament “of a Rebellion growing in the Army” which, if not suppressed, would undo all they had done.</Q> They, as they were allways apt to take alarms of that kind, would not have the
<PB N="542" REF="5520"/>
patience to expect the delivery of the Petition, but sent to <HI>Fleetwood</HI> for it. He answer'd, he had only a Copy, but that such Officers, whom he named, had the Original. The Officers were presently sent for, but could not be found till the afternoon; when they produced the Peti∣tion. Whereupon the Parliament, that they might discountenance and exclude any Address of that kind, passed a Vote, <Q>“that the having more <NOTE PLACE="marg">They pass, a Vote to have no more Gene∣ral Officers.</NOTE> general Officers was a thing needless, chargeable, and dangerous to” the Common-wealth.</Q></P>
<P>THIS put the whole Army into that distemper, that <HI>Lambert</HI> could wish it in; and brought the Council of Officers to meet again more avowedly, than they had done since the reviving of the Parliament. <MILESTONE N="10"/> They prepared and presented a Petition and Representation to the Par∣liament; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Council of Officers upon this prepare a a Petition, and Repre∣sentation to the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> <Q>in which they gave them many good words, and assured them of “their fidelity towards them; but yet that they would so far take care for their own preservation, that they would not be at the Mercy” of their Enemies;</Q> and implied, that they having no way forfeited their Rights of Freemen, had likewise Privileges, which they would not quit; and then seconded the proposals of the Northern Brigade with more warmth, and desired, <Q>“that whatever Persons should for the future groundlesly inform the Parliament against them, creating jealousies, and <MILESTONE N="20"/> casting scandalous imputations upon them, may be brought to exami∣nation,” justice, and condign punishment.</Q></P>
<P>THE Parliament, that was govern'd by <HI>Vane,</HI> and <HI>Haslerig</HI> (the Heads of the Republick Party, though of very different Natures, and Understandings) found there would be no compounding this dispute amicably, but that one Side must be suppressed. They resolv'd there∣fore to take away all hope of Subsistence from the Army, if they should be inclined to make any alteration in the Government by force. <Q>In order thereunto they declared, “that it should be Treason in any Person <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment declare it Treason to raise Money without con∣sent of Parlia∣ment; and make void all Money-Acts. They cashier</HI> Lambert, <HI>and eight other principal Of∣ficers of the Army.</HI></NOTE> whatsoever to raise, levy, and collect Money, without consent in Par∣liament.”</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"/> Then they made void all Acts for Custom, and Excise; and by this there was nothing left to maintain the Army, except they would prey upon the People, which could not hold long. Next, they cashier'd <HI>Lambert,</HI> and eight other principal Officers of the Army; with whom they were most offended, for subscribing a Letter to all the other Forces desiring their concurrence with the Army in <HI>London,</HI> and conferr'd their Regiments and Commands upon other Persons, in whom they could confide; and committed the whole Government of the Army into the hands of seven Commissioners; who were, <HI>Fleetwood</HI> (whom they be∣liev'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">They make se∣ven Commis∣sioners to go∣vern the Ar∣my.</NOTE> to have a great Interest in the Army, and so durst not totally dis∣oblige, <MILESTONE N="40"/> him) <HI>Ludlow</HI> (who commanded the Army in <HI>Ireland) Monk</HI> (who was their General in <HI>Scotland) Haslerig, Walton, Morley,</HI> and <HI>Overton;</HI> who were all upon the place.</P>
<P>THE Army was too far engaged to retire, and it was unskilfully done by the Parliament to provoke so many of them, being not sure of a competent strength to execute their Orders. But they had a great presumption upon the City; and had already forgotten, how the Army baffled it about a dozen years before, when the Parliament had much more reputation, and the Army less terrour. The Nine cashier'd Officers were resolv'd not to part with their Commands, nor would the Soldiers <MILESTONE N="50"/> submit to their new Officers; and both Officers and Soldiers consulted their Affairs so well together, that they agreed to meet at <HI>Westminster</HI> the next morning, and determine to whose lot it would come to be cashier'd.</P>
<P><PB N="543" REF="5530"/>
THE Parliament, to encounter this design, sent their Orders to those <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment send for Forces to de∣fend them, and for the City Militia</NOTE> Regiments whose fidelity they were confident of, to be the next morn∣ing at <HI>Westminster</HI> to defend them from force; and likewise sent into the City to draw down their Militia. Of the Army, the next morning, there appear'd two Regiments of Foot, and four Troops of Horse; who were well arm'd, and ranged themselves in the <HI>Palace-</HI>yard, with a Re∣solution to oppose all force that should attempt the Parliament. <HI>Lam∣bert</HI> intended they should have little to do there; and divided his Party in the Army to the several places by which the City Militia could come <MILESTONE N="10"/> to <HI>Westminster,</HI> <Q>with order “that they should suffer none to march” that way, or to come out of the Gates;</Q> then placed himself with some Troops in <HI>King-</HI>street, and before <HI>White-Hall,</HI> to expect when the Speaker would come to the House; who, at his accustom'd hour, came, in his usual State, guarded with his Troop of Horse. <Q><HI>Lambert</HI> rode up to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>draws some Troops toge∣ther, stops the Speaker, and makes him go home.</HI></NOTE> Speaker, and told him, “”there was nothing to be done at <HI>Westminster,</HI></Q> <Q>and therefore advised him “”to return back again to his House:</Q> which he refused to do, and endeavour'd to proceed, and called to his Guard to make way. Upon which <HI>Lambert</HI> rode to the Captain, and pulled him off his Horse; and bid Major <HI>Creed,</HI> who had formerly Commanded <MILESTONE N="20"/> that Troop, to mount into his Saddle; which he presently did. Then he took away the Mace, and bid Major <HI>Creed</HI> conduct M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lenthal</HI> to his House. Whereupon they made his Coach-man turn, and without the least contradiction the Troop march'd very quietly, till he was alighted at his own House; and then disposed of themselves as their new Captain commanded them.</P>
<P>WHEN they had thus secured themselves from any more Votes, <HI>Lam∣bert</HI> sent to those who had been order'd into the <HI>Palace-</HI>yard by the Parliament, to withdraw to their Quarters; which they refused to do; at which he smiled, and bid them then to stay there; which they did <MILESTONE N="30"/> till towards the evening: but then finding themselves laughed at, that they had nothing to do, and that the Parliament sate not, they desired that they might repair to their Quarters; which they were appointed to do. But their Officers were cashier'd; and such sent to command as <HI>Lambert</HI> thought fit; who sound all submission and obedience from the Soldiers, though no body yet knew who had power to command them. There was no Parliament, nor any Officer in the Army who was by his Commission above the degree of a Colonel, nor had any of them power to command more than his own Regiment.</P>
<P><Q>WHEREUPON the Officers of the Army meet together and declare, <MILESTONE N="40"/> “that the Army finding it self without a General, or other general Of∣ficers, had Themselves made choice of <HI>Fleetwood</HI> to be their General, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Officers meet, and choose</HI> Fleet∣wood <HI>General</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> and of <HI>Lambert</HI> to be their Major General, and of <HI>Desborough</HI> to be Commissary General of the Horse; and that they bound themselves to obey them in their several Capacities, and to adhere to, and defend” them.</Q> Upon the publishing this Declaration, they assum'd their se∣veral Provinces; and the whole Army took Commissions from their new General; and were as much united, as if they were under <HI>Crom∣well;</HI> and look'd upon it as a great deliverance, that they should no more be subject to the Parliament; which they all detested.</P>
<P>BUT these Generals were not at ease; they knew well upon what <MILESTONE N="50"/> slippery ground they stood: the Parliament had stopped all the Chan∣nels in which the Revenue was to run; put an end to all payments of Custom and Excise; and to revive these Impositions, by which the
<PB N="544" REF="5540"/>
Army might receive their Wages, required another Authority than of the Army it self. The divisions in the Parliament, had made the out∣rage that was committed upon it less reproachful. <HI>Vane,</HI> who was much <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vane<HI>'s and</HI> Haslerig<HI>'s parts in this business.</HI></NOTE> the wisest Man, sound he could never make that Assembly settle such a Government as He affected, either in Church or State: and <HI>Haslerig,</HI> who was of a rude, and stubborn Nature, and of a weak understanding, concurr'd only with him in all the fierce Counsels, which might more irrecoverably disinherit the King, and root out his Majesty's Party: in all other things relating to the Temporal, or Ecclesiastical matters, they were not only of different judgements, but of extraordinary animosity <MILESTONE N="10"/> against each other.</P>
<P>VANE was a Man not to be described by any Character of Religion; in which he had swallow'd some of the fancies, and extravagancies of every Sect, or Faction; and was become (which cannot be expressed by any other Language than was peculiar to that time) <HI>a Man above Or∣dinances,</HI> unlimited, or unrestrain'd by any rules, or bounds prescribed to other Men, by reason of his perfection. He was a perfect Enthusiast; and, without doubt, did believe himself inspired; which so far corrupted his reason and understanding (which in all matters without the Verge of Religion was Superior to that of most Men) that he did at some time <MILESTONE N="20"/> believe, he was the Person deputed to Reign over the Saints upon Earth for a thousand years.</P>
<P>HASLERIG was, as to the State, perfectly Republican; and as to Religion, perfectly Presbyterian: and so he might be sure never to be troubled with a King or a Bishop, was indifferent to other things; only he believ'd the Parliament to be the only Government that would in∣fallibly keep those two out; and his credit in the House was greater than the other's; which made <HI>Vane</HI> less troubled at the Violence that was used (though he would never advise it) and appear willing enough to confer, and joyn with those who would find any other hinge to hang <MILESTONE N="30"/> the Government upon: so he presently enter'd into conversation with those of the Army, who were most like to have Authority.</P>
<P>A MODEL of such a Government, as the People must acquiesce in, and submit to, would require very much Agitation, and very long time; which the present conjuncture would not bear: nor were there enough of one mind, to give great Authority to their Counsels. In This they <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee of Safety con∣stituted by the Army.</NOTE> could agree, which might be an expedient towards more ripe resolutions, <Q>“that a Number of Persons should be chosen, who, under the style of a <HI>Committee of Safety,</HI> should assume the present entire Government, and have full power to revive all such Orders, or to make new, which <MILESTONE N="40"/> might be necessary for raising of Money, or for doing any thing else which should be judged for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom; and to consider and determine, what form of Government was fit to be” erected, to which the Nation was to submit.</Q> <Q>They also declared “all the Orders, Acts, or pretended Acts made in Parliament on the 10, 11, and 12 of <HI>October</HI> before their Interruption, to be void and null to all” intents and purposes, as if they had never been.</Q></P>
<P>TO this new Invention, how wild soever, they believ'd the People would be perswaded, with the Assistance of the Army, to pay a tempo∣rary Obedience, in hope of another settlement speedily to ensue. They <MILESTONE N="50"/> agreed that the Number of this <HI>Committee of Safety</HI> should consist of three and twenty Persons; six or seven Officers of the Army, whereof <HI>Fleetwood, Lambert,</HI> and <HI>Desborough</HI> were three; <HI>Ireton,</HI> Lord Mayor
<PB N="545" REF="5550"/>
of <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>Tichburn,</HI> the two principal Officers of the Militia of the City, with four or five more Citizens of more private Names; but Men tryed, and faithful to the Republick Interest, and not like to give any countenance to Presbyterians (for they were very jealous of that Party generally) besides three or four others of those who had been the King's Judges, with <HI>Warreston, Vane, Steel,</HI> and <HI>Whitlock,</HI> whom they made Keeper of their Great Seal.</P>
<P>THUS having chosen each other, and agreed that they should exer∣cise the whole Legislative power of the Nation, and proclaim'd them∣selves <HI>the Committee of Safety for the Kingdom,</HI> and required all People to pay them obedience, and issued out their Warrants for all things which they thought good for themselves, to which there appear'd a ge∣neral submission and acquiescence, that they might be sure to receive no disturbance from those of their own Tribe in any Parts, they sent Colonel <HI>Cobbet</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to perswade General <HI>Monk</HI> to a concurrence <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cobbet <HI>sent into</HI> Scotland <HI>to</HI> Monk.</NOTE> with them; and because they were not confident of him (there being great emulation between Him and <HI>Lambert)</HI> to work upon as many of his Officers as he could; there being many in that Army of whose Af∣fections they were well assured; and, at the same time, they sent another <MILESTONE N="10"/> Colonel into <HI>Ireland,</HI> to dispose the Army there to a submission to their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And Another to the Army in</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> Power and Authority.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Parliament was routed, they discern'd what <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Intrigues would shortly produce; <Q>and therefore had writ to <HI>Monk,</HI> “that he would take care of his Army, lest it should be corrupted against” him, which they knew was endeavouring;</Q> <Q>and <HI>Haslerig,</HI> who had some friendship with him, writ particularly to him “to continue firm to the” Parliament;</Q> <Q>and to assure him, “that before <HI>Lambert</HI> should be able to be near him to give him any trouble, he would give him other di∣vertisement.”</Q> And some time after <HI>Lambert</HI> had acted that violence <MILESTONE N="30"/> upon the Speaker, so that they could meet no more, <HI>Haslerig, Walton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Haslerig, Walton, <HI>and</HI> Morley <HI>go to</HI> Portsmouth</NOTE> and <HI>Morley,</HI> three of the Commissioners of the Government of the Ar∣my, went to <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> where Colonel <HI>Whetham</HI> the Governour was their Friend, and devoted to the Presbyterian-Republican Party; for that distinction was now grown amongst them; Others, and the most considerable of that Party, <Q>professing “that they very much desired Mo∣narchical Government, and the Person of the King, so that they might” have him without Episcopacy,</Q> and enjoy the Lands of the Church; which they had divided among them. These three were well receiv'd at <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> and that they might be without any disturbance there, the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Governour turn'd all such Officers and Soldiers out of the Town, who were suspected to be, or might be made of the Party of the Army; and Colonel <HI>Morley,</HI> whose Interest was in <HI>Sussex,</HI> easily drew in enough of his Friends, to make them very secure in their Garrison; which the <HI>Committee of Safety</HI> thought would be quickly reduced, if all the rest of the Kingdom were at their Devotion; nor did the matter it self much trouble them; for they knew that <HI>Haslerig</HI> would never be induced to serve the King, whose Interest only could break all their Measures.</P>
<P>BUT this open declaring of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> for the Parliament happen'd not till the following <HI>December.</HI> That which gave them real trouble <MILESTONE N="50"/> was, that they receiv'd bold Letters from <HI>Monk,</HI> about the end of <HI>Octo∣ber;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk <HI>to the Officers of the Army declaring for the Parlia¦ment.</HI></NOTE> who presum'd to censure, and find fault with what they had done, in using such force and violence to the Parliament, from whom they had all their Power and Authority; and shortly after they heard that
<PB N="546" REF="5560"/>
he had possessed himself of <HI>Berwick.</HI> But that which troubled them <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>possesses</HI> Ber∣wick; <HI>imprisons</HI> Cobbet;</NOTE> most was, that assoon as <HI>Cobbet</HI> came into <HI>Scotland,</HI> he was committed close Prisoner to <HI>Edenborough</HI> Castle; and that <HI>Monk</HI> used extraordi∣nary diligence to purge his Army, and turn'd all the Fanaticks, and other <NOTE PLACE="marg">and purges his Army of Fa∣naticks.</NOTE> Persons who were supposed by him to have any inclination to <HI>Lambert,</HI> and his Party, both out of the Army, and the Kingdom; sending them under a Guard into <HI>Berwick,</HI> and from thence dismissing them into <HI>England,</HI> under the penalty of death, if they were ever after found in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This was an Alarm worthy of their fear, and evidence enough, that they were never to expect <HI>Monk</HI> to be of their Party: besides that <MILESTONE N="10"/> they had allways look'd upon him as entirely devoted to the Person of <HI>Cromwell;</HI> otherwise, without obligation to any Party or Opinion, and more like to be seduced by the King, than any Man who had Autho∣rity in the three Kingdoms: therefore they resolv'd to send <HI>Lambert,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>sent against him.</HI></NOTE> with their whole Army into the North, that he might at least stop him in any march he should think of making; reserving only some Troops to guard themselves, and keep the Town quiet, and some others to send to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> if not to reduce it, at least to hinder the Garri∣son there from making Incursions into the two Neighbour Counties of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and <HI>Hamshire,</HI> where they had many Friends.</P>
<P>WHILST all preparations were making for the Army to march to∣wards <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Scotland, the Committee of Safety</HI> resolv'd once more to try if they could induce <HI>Monk</HI> to a conjunction with them; and to that pur∣pose they sent to him two such Persons as they thought might be grate∣ful to him; of whom one was his Wife's Brother; and after them some <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They send</HI> Clarges, &amp;c. <HI>to</HI> Monk.</NOTE> Officers of the Army, and two Independent Ministers, with offers of any thing he could desire of advantage to himself, or for any of his Friends. He receiv'd these Men with all imaginable civility and cour∣tesy, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk<HI>'s An∣swer to them.</HI></NOTE> <Q>making great professions “that he desired nothing more, than to unite Himself and his Army with that of <HI>England,</HI> provided that there <MILESTONE N="30"/> might be a Lawful power, to which they might all be subject: but that the Force that had been used upon the Parliament, was an Action of such a Nature, that was destructive to all Government, and that it would be absolutely necessary to restore that to its Freedom, Rights, and Privileges; which being done, he would use all the instance and credit he had to procure an Act of Pardon, and Oblivion, for all that had been done amiss; and this would unite both Parliament and Army for the publick Safety, which was apparently threaten'd and shaken'd” by this disunion.</Q> <Q>He added, “that he so much desired Peace and Union, and so little thought of using Force, that he would appoint three Of∣ficers <MILESTONE N="40"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He appoints three Commis∣sioners to treat with the Of∣ficers of the Army at</HI> Lon∣don.</NOTE> of his Army, <HI>Wilks, Clobery,</HI> and <HI>Knight,</HI> to go to <HI>London,</HI> and treat with <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> of all particulars necessary there∣unto.”</Q> When the Persons sent from <HI>London</HI> gave an Account of their reception, and of the great professions the General made, and his reso∣lution to send a Committee to treat upon the Accommodation, <HI>the Com∣mittee of Safety</HI> was very well pleased, and concluded, that the fame of their Army's march had frighted him: so that, as they willingly em∣braced <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They at</HI> Lon¦don <HI>accept of a Treaty.</HI></NOTE> the Overture of a Treaty, they likewise appointed <HI>Lambert</HI> to hasten his March, and to make no stay, till he should come to <HI>New-Castle.</HI> All which he observed with great punctuality and expedition, <MILESTONE N="50"/> his Army still encreasing till he came thither.</P>
<P>GENERAL <HI>Monk</HI> was a Gentleman of a very good Extraction, of a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A particular Amount of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Monk</NOTE> very ancient family in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> allways very loyally affected. Being
<PB N="547" REF="5570"/>
a younger Brother, he enter'd early into the life and condition of a Sol∣dier, upon that Stage where some of all <HI>Europe</HI> then acted, between the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and had the reputation of a very good Foot-Officer in the Lord <HI>Vere</HI>'s Regiment in <HI>Holland,</HI> at the time when he assign'd it to the Command of <HI>Colonel Goring.</HI> When the first Troubles begun in <HI>Scotland, Monk,</HI> and many other Officers of the Nation, left the <HI>Dutch</HI> Service, and betook themselves to the Service of the King. In the beginning of the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebellion, he was sent thither, with the Command of the Lord <HI>Leicester</HI>'s own Regiment of Foot (who was <MILESTONE N="10"/> then Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland)</HI> and continued in that service with singular reputation of courage, and conduct. When the War broke out in <HI>England</HI> between the King and the Parliament, he fell under some discountenance, upon a suspicion of an inclination to the Parliament; which proceeded from his want of bitterness in his discourses against them, rather than from any inclination towards them; as appear'd by his behaviour at <HI>Nant∣wich,</HI> where he was taken Prisoner, and remained in the Tower till the end of the War. For though his behaviour had been such in <HI>Ireland,</HI> when the transportation of the Regiment from thence, to serve the King in <HI>England,</HI> was in debate, that it was evident enough he had no <MILESTONE N="20"/> mind his Regiment should be sent on that Expedition, and his Answer to the Lord of <HI>Ormond</HI> was so rough, and doubtful, that he thought not fit to trust him, but gave the Command of the Regiment to <HI>Harry Warren,</HI> the Lieutenant Colonel of it, an excellent Officer, generally known, and exceedingly beloved where he was known; yet when those Regiments were sent to <HI>Chester,</HI> and there were others at the same time sent to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and with them <HI>Monk</HI> went under some Cloud, and from <HI>Bristol</HI> to the King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he was known to many Persons of Quality (and his eldest Brother being at the same time most zealous in the King's Service in the West, and most useful) his professions were <MILESTONE N="30"/> so sincere (he being, throughout his whole life, never suspected of dis∣simulation) that all Men there thought him very worthy of all trust; and the King was willing to send him into the West, where the Gentle∣men had a great opinion of his ability to command. But he desired that he might serve with his old Friends and Companions; and so, with the King's leave, made all hast towards <HI>Chester;</HI> where he arriv'd the very day before the Defeat at <HI>Nantwich;</HI> and though his Lieutenant Colo∣nel was very desirous to give up the Command again to him, and to receive his Orders, he would by no means at that time take it, but chose to serve, as a Voluntier, in the first Rank, with a Pike in his hand; and <MILESTONE N="40"/> was the next day, as was said, taken Prisoner with the rest, and with most of the other Officers sent to <HI>Hull,</HI> and shortly after from thence to the Tower of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>HE was no sooner there, than the Lord <HI>Lisle,</HI> who had great kind∣ness for him, and good Interest in the Parliament, with much impor∣tunity endeavour'd to perswade him to take a Commission in that Ser∣vice, and offer'd him a Command superior to what he had ever had before; which he positively and disdainfully refused to accept, though the streights he suffer'd in Prison were very great, and he thought himself not kindly dealt with, that there was neither care for his Exchange, nor Money sent <MILESTONE N="50"/> for his support. But there was all possible endeavour used for the first, by offering several Officers of the same Quality for his Exchange; which was allways refused; <Q>there having been an Ordinance made, “that no Officer who had been transported out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> should ever be ex∣changed;”</Q>
<PB N="548" REF="5580"/>
so that most of them remained still in Prison with him in the Tower, and the rest in other Prisons; who all underwent the same hard∣ships by the extreme necessity of the King's condition, which could not provide Money enough for their supply; yet all was done towards it that was possible.</P>
<P>WHEN the War was at an end, and the King a Prisoner, <HI>Cromwell</HI> prevailed with <HI>Monk</HI> for his liberty and preferment, to engage himself again in the War of <HI>Ireland.</HI> And, from that time, <HI>Monk</HI> continued very firm to <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who was liberal, and bountiful to him, and took him into his entire confidence; and after he had put the Com∣mand <MILESTONE N="10"/> of <HI>Scotland</HI> into his hands, he feared nothing from those Quar∣ters; nor was there any Man in either of the Armies, upon whose fi∣delity to himself <HI>Cromwell</HI> more depended. And those of his Western friends, who thought best of him, thought it to no purpose to make any Attempt upon him, whilst <HI>Cromwell</HI> lived. But assoon as He was dead, <HI>Monk</HI> was generally looked upon as a Man more inclined to the King, than any other in great Authority, if he might discover it with∣out too much loss or hazard. His Elder Brother had been entirely de∣voted to the King's Service, and all his Relations were of the same faith. He himself had no fumes of Fanaticism to turn his head, nor any cre∣dit <MILESTONE N="20"/> with, or dependence upon any who were sway'd by those trances.</P>
<P>HE had a younger Brother, a Divine, who had a Parsonage in <HI>De∣vonshire,</HI> and had, through all the ill times, carried himself with singu∣lar Integrity; and, being a Gentleman of a good Family, was in great reputation with all those who constantly adhered to the King. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil,</HI> who had both friendship for the Gene∣ral, and old acquaintance, and all confidence in his Brother, advised with him, <Q>“whether, since <HI>Cromwell</HI> was now gone, and in all reason it might be expected that his death would be attended with a general Revolution, by which the King's Interest would be again disputed, he <MILESTONE N="30"/> did not believe, that the General might be wrought upon, in a fit conjuncture, to serve the King, in which, they thought, he would be sure to meet with a universal concurrence from the whole <HI>Scotish”</HI> Nation.</Q> The honest Clergy-man thought the Overture so reasonable, and wished so heartily it might be embraced, that he offer'd himself to make a journey to his Brother into <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon pretence of a visit (there having been allways a brotherly Affection perform'd between them) and directly to propose it to him. <HI>Pollard</HI> and <HI>Greenvil</HI> inform'd the King of this design; and believ'd well themselves of what they wish'd so much, and desired his Majesty's approbation, and Instruction. The <MILESTONE N="40"/> King had reason to approve it; and sent such directions as he thought most proper for such a Negotiation. Whereupon his Brother begun his journey towards <HI>Edenborough,</HI> where the General receiv'd him well. But after he had staid some time there, and found an opportunity to tell him on what Errand he came, He soon dismissed him, without dis∣covering to him any inclination to the business he came about, <Q>advising him “”to return no more to him with such Propositions.</Q></P>
<P>IN truth, at that time, the General had not given the least publick proof that he had any thought, or purpose of contributing to the King's Restoration, which he might possibly think to be desperate. Some ra∣ther <MILESTONE N="50"/> believed, that the disposition, which afterwards grew in him, to∣wards it, did arise from divers Accidents, which fell out in the course of Affairs, and seem'd even to oblige him to undertake that which in
<PB N="549" REF="5590"/>
the end conduced so much to his greatness and glory: yet from that very time, his Brother's Inclinations to the King being known, and his journey taken notice of, it was generally believed in <HI>Scotland</HI> that he had a purpose to serve the King; which his Majesty took no pains to disclaim either there, or in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>NOW upon the several suddain Changes in <HI>England,</HI> and the Army's possessing it self of the entire Government, <HI>Monk</HI> saw he should be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk<HI>'s jea∣lousy of</HI> Lam∣bert <HI>before this time.</HI></NOTE> quickly overrun and destroyed by <HI>Lambert</HI>'s greatness, of which he had allways great emulation, if he did not provide for his own security. And <MILESTONE N="10"/> therefore when he heard of his march towards the North, he used all in∣ventions to get time, by entring into Treaties, and in hope that there would appear some other Party that would own and avow the Parlia∣ment's Interest, as He had done: nor did he then manifest to have more in his purpose, than his own profit and honour, under the establishment of that Government.</P>
<P>WHEN he heard of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s being passed <HI>York,</HI> and his making hast to <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and had purged out of his Army all those whose affections and fidelity were suspected by him, he called together an As∣sembly, somewhat resembling a Convention of the States of <HI>Scotland;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He calls toge∣ther an As∣sembly of the</HI> Scotish <HI>Na∣tion.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"/> which he had subdued to all imaginable tameness, though he had exer∣cised no other power over them than was absolutely necessary to reduce that People to an entire submission to that Tyrannical Yoke. In all his other carriage towards them, but what was in order to that end, he was friendly and companiable enough; and as he was fear'd by the Nobility, and hated by the Clergy, so he was not unlov'd by the Common People, who receiv'd more Justice, and less oppression from him, than they had been accustom'd to under their own Lords. When this Convention ap∣pear'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">His discourse to them</NOTE> before him, he told them, <Q>“that he had receiv'd a Call from Hea∣ven, and Earth, to march with his Army into <HI>England,</HI> for the better <MILESTONE N="30"/> settlement of the Government there; and though he did not intend his absence should be long, yet he foresaw that there might be some disturbance of the Peace which they enjoyed; and therefore he ex∣pected, and desired, that, in any such occasion, they would be ready” to joyn with the Forces he left behind in their own defence.</Q> In the second place, which was indeed all he cared for from them, he very earnestly pressed them, <Q>“that they would pay in a present Sum of Mo∣ney out of the Arrears of their Taxes, for supplying the necessities of” the Army, without which it could not well march into <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>FROM the time that he had settled his Government in that King∣dom, <MILESTONE N="40"/> he had shew'd more kindness to, and used more familiarity with such Persons as were most notorious for Affection to the King, as find∣ing them a more direct and punctual People than the rest: and when these Men resorted to him upon this Convention, though they could draw nothing from him of promise, or intimation to any such purpose, yet he was very well content they should believe that he carried with him very good Inclinations to the King; by which imagination of theirs, he receiv'd great Advantage: for they payed him the Arrears of a twelve Months Tax over the Kingdom; which complied with his wish, and partly enabled him to draw his Army together. And after he had as∣sign'd <MILESTONE N="50"/> those whom he thought fit to leave behind him, and afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut them under the Command of Major General <HI>Morgan,</HI> he march'd with the rest to <HI>Berwick;</HI> where a good part of his Horse and Foot ex∣pected him; having refused to ratify the Treaty sign'd by his Commis∣sioners
<PB N="550" REF="5600"/>
at <HI>London,</HI> and committed Colonel <HI>Wilks,</HI> one of them, upon his return to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for having consented to something prejudicial to him, and expresly contrary to his Instructions. However he desired to gain farther time, and agreed to another Treaty to be held at <HI>New-Castle;</HI> which, though he knew it would be govern'd by <HI>Lambert,</HI> was like not to be without some benefit to himself, because it would keep up the opinion in <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> that he was inclined to an accommodation of Peace.</P>
<P>IT was towards the end of <HI>November,</HI> that <HI>Lambert</HI> with his Ar∣my <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>comes with his Army to</HI> New-Castle <HI>towards the end of</HI> No∣vember.</NOTE> my arriv'd at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> where he found the Officers and Soldiers <MILESTONE N="10"/> whom <HI>Monk</HI> had cashier'd; and who, he perswaded the People, had de∣serted <HI>Monk,</HI> for his infidelity to the Common-wealth, and that most of those, who yet stayed with him, would do so too, assoon as he should be within distance to receive them. But he now found his confidence had carried him too far, and that he was at too great a distance to give that relief to his <HI>Committee of Safety,</HI> which it was like to stand in need of. <HI>Haslerig</HI> and <HI>Morley</HI> were now looked upon, as the Persons invested with the Authority of Parliament, whose Interest was supported by them; and the Officer, who was sent by <HI>the Committee of Safety</HI> to re∣strain them in <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> or rather to restrain Persons from resorting <MILESTONE N="20"/> to them, found himself deserted by more than half his Soldiers; <Q>who declared “”that they would serve the Parliament,</Q> and so went into <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> and another Officer, who was sent with a stronger Party <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Soldiers before</HI> Ports∣mouth <HI>re∣volted to it.</HI></NOTE> to second them, discovering, or fomenting the same Affections in his Soldiers, very frankly carried them to the same place: so that they were now grown too Numerous to be contain'd within that Garrison, but were quarter'd to be in readiness to march whither their Generals, <HI>Haslerig</HI> and <HI>Morley,</HI> would conduct them.</P>
<P>THE City took new courage from hence; and what the Masters durst not publickly own, the Apprentices did, their dislike of the present Go∣vernment; <MILESTONE N="30"/> and flocking together in great Multitudes, <Q>declared “that” they would have a free Parliament.</Q> And though Colonel <HI>Hewson</HI> (a bold fellow, who had been an ill Shoemaker, and afterwards Clerk to a Brewer of small Beer) who was left to guard <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> suppressed that Commotion by marching into the City, and killing some <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The City Ap∣prentices rise, but are sup∣pressed by</HI> Hewson</NOTE> of the Apprentices, yet the loss of that blood inflamed the City the more against the Army; <Q>which, they said, “was only kept on foot to” murther the Citizens.</Q> And it was said, they caused a Bill of Indictment to be prepared against <HI>Hewson</HI> for those Murthers. The Common Coun∣cil appear'd every day more refractory, and refused to concur in any <MILESTONE N="40"/> thing that was proposed to them by <HI>the Committee of Safety;</HI> which begun to be universally abhorr'd, as like to be the Original of such an∣other Tyranny as <HI>Cromwell</HI> had erected, since it wholely depended upon the power and spirit of the Army: though, on the other hand, the Committee protested and declared to them, <Q>“that there should be a Parliament called to meet together in <HI>February</HI> next, under such qua∣lifications and restrictions, as might be sure to exclude such Persons” who would destroy them.</Q> But this gave no satisfaction, every Man remembring the Parliament that had been packed by <HI>Cromwell.</HI></P>
<P>BUT that which broke the heart of <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> was the <MILESTONE N="50"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawson <HI>and the Fleet de∣clare for the Parliament, and come into the River</HI></NOTE> revolt of their favourite Vice-Admiral <HI>Lawson,</HI> a Man at that time ap∣pearing at least as much Republican, as any amongst them; as much an Independent, as much an Enemy to the Presbyterians and to the Co∣venant,

as S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane</HI> himself; and a great dependent upon S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane;</HI> and one whom they had raised to that Command in the Fleet, that they might be sure to have the Seamen still at their devotion. This Man, with his whole Squadron, came into the River, and declared for the Parliament; which was so unexpected, that they would not believe it; but sent S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> and two others of great intimacy with <HI>Law∣son,</HI> to confer with him; who, when they came to the Fleet, found S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Anthony Ashley Cooper,</HI> and two others, Members of the Parliament, who had so fully prepossessed him, that he was deaf to all their Charms; <Q>and told them, “that he would submit to no Authority but that of the” <MILESTONE N="10"/> Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>UPON the fame of this, <HI>Haslerig</HI> and <HI>Morley</HI> resolv'd with their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Haslerig <HI>and</HI> Morley <HI>march from</HI> Ports∣mouth <HI>to∣wards</HI> Lon∣don.</NOTE> Troops to leave <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and to march towards <HI>London,</HI> where their friends now prevail'd so much. And the news of this march raised new thoughts in those Soldiers who had been left by <HI>Lambert</HI> to execute any Orders, which they should receive from <HI>the Committee of Safety.</HI> The Officers of these Regiments had been cashier'd by the Coun∣cil of Officers, or <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> for adhering to the Parlia∣ment; and their Commands having been given to other Men, who had been discountenanced by the Parliament, the Regiments for a time ap∣peared <MILESTONE N="20"/> as much confirmed in the Interest of the Army, as could be wished. But these cashier'd Officers, upon so great revolutions in the City and the Navy, and the News of the Advance of <HI>Haslerig</HI> and <HI>Morley,</HI> resolved to conser with their old Soldiers, and try whether they had as much credit with them as their new Officers; and found so much encouragement, that, at a time appointed, they put them∣selves into the heads of their Regiments, and marched with them into the field; whence, after a short conference together, and renewing vows to each other never more to desert the Parliament, they all marched <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Soldiers in</HI> London <HI>resolve to re∣store the Par∣liament; and wait on the Speaker.</HI></NOTE> into <HI>Chancery-</HI>Lane to the House of the Speaker; and professed their <MILESTONE N="30"/> resolution to live and die with the Parliament, and never more to swerve from their fidelity to it.</P>
<P>LAMBERT, upon the first News of the froward Spirit in the City, had sent back <HI>Desborough</HI>'s Regiment; which was now marched as near <HI>London</HI> as S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Albans;</HI> where, hearing what their fellows at <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI> with whom they were to joyn, had done, they resolved not to be the last in their Submission; but declared that they likewise were for the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Desborough<HI>'s Regiment re∣volt to the Parliament.

In all these several tergiversations of the Soldiers, General <HI>Fleetwood</HI> remain'd still in consultations with <HI>the Committee of Safety;</HI> and when any In∣telligence <MILESTONE N="40"/> was brought of any murmur amongst the Soldiers, by which a revolt might ensue, and he was desired to go amongst them to con∣firm them, he would fall upon his Knees to his prayers, and could hardly be prevaild with to go to them. And when he was amongst them, and in the middle of any discourse, he would invite them all to prayers, and put himself upon his Knees before them: and when some of his friends importuned him to appear more vigorous in the Charge he had, without which they must be all destroy'd, they could get no other an∣swer from him, than <Q>“that God had spit in his face, and would not” hear him:</Q> so that Men ceased to wonder why <HI>Lambert</HI> had preferr'd <MILESTONE N="50"/> him to the Office of General, and been content with the second Com∣mand for himself.</P>
<P>LENTHAL the Speaker, upon this new Declaration of the Soldiers,
<PB N="552" REF="5620"/>
recover'd his Spirit, and went into the City, conferr'd with the Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lenthal <HI>goes into the City;</HI></NOTE> Mayor and Aldermen, and declared to them, <Q>“that the Parliament” would meet (though not immediately) within very few days.</Q> For, as the Members were not many, who were alive, and suffer'd to meet as the Parliament, so they were now dispersed into several places. Then he went to the Tower, and, by his own Authority, remov'd the Lieu∣tenant, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Changes the Command of the Tower.</NOTE> who had been confirm'd there by the <HI>Committee of Safety;</HI> and put S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Anthony Ashley Cooper,</HI> and other Members of the Parlia∣ment, into the Government and Command of the Tower.</P>
<P>ALL things being in this good Order, He and the Members met again <MILESTONE N="10"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment meets again at</HI> Westminster.</NOTE> together at <HI>Westminster,</HI> on <HI>December</HI> the 26<SUP>th</SUP>, and assumed the Govern∣ment of the three Kingdoms, out of which they had been twice before cast, with so much reproach and infamy. Assoon as they came together, they repealed their Act against the payment of Excise and Customs; and put those Collections into the state they had been formerly in, that they might be sure not to be without Money to pay their Proselyte Forces, and to carry on their other expences. Then they appointed Commissioners to direct the Quarters into which the Army should be put; and made an Order, that all the Troops under the Command of <NOTE PLACE="marg">They order Lambert's Troops to their several Quar∣ters</NOTE> <HI>Lambert,</HI> without sending any direction to him, should repair to those <MILESTONE N="20"/> Quarters to which they were assign'd.</P>
<P>THIS Man was now in a disconsolate condition: as <HI>Monk</HI> approach'd nearer to him, very many of his Soldiers deserted him, and went to the other. The Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> had raised Forces, and possessed himself of <HI>York,</HI> without declaring any thing of his purpose. And this last Order of the Parliament so entirely stripp'd <HI>Lambert</HI> of his Army, that there remain'd not with him above one hundred Horse; all the rest return'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert<HI>'s Army sepa∣rates; and He is committed to the Tower.</HI></NOTE> to their Quarters with all quietness and resignation; and himself was some time after committed to the Tower. The rest of the Officers of the Army, who had been formerly cashier'd by the Parliament, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> had resum'd their Commands that they might break it, were again dis∣missed from their Charges, and committed Prisoners to their own Houses. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> and divers other Members of the House who <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vane, and Others who had concurr'd with</HI> the Committee of Safety, <HI>con∣fined to their own Houses.</HI></NOTE> had concurr'd with <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> were likewise confined to their own Houses: so that the Parliament seem'd now again possessed of a more absolute Authority than ever it had been, and to be without any danger of opposition, or contradiction.</P>
<P>THE other changes and fluctuations had still administer'd some hopes to the King; and the daily breaking out of new Animosities amongst the Chief Ministers of the former mischiefs, disposed Men to believe that the Government might at last rest upon the old foundation. Men ex∣pected, <MILESTONE N="40"/> that a very sharp Engagement between <HI>Lambert</HI> and <HI>Monk</HI> might make their parts of the Army for ever after irreconcilable, and that all Parties would be at last obliged to consent to a new Parliament; in the election whereof there was a reasonable belief, that the general temper of the People would choose sober and wise Men, who would ra∣ther bind up the wounds which had been already made, than endeavour to widen them. <HI>The Committee of Safety</HI> had neither receiv'd the re∣verence, nor inculcated the fear, which any Government must do, that was to last any time. But this surprising Resurrection of the Parliament, that had been so often exploded, so often dead and buried, and was the <MILESTONE N="50"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Parliament the King's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seem'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> only Image of power that was most formidable to the King and his Party, seem'd to pull up all their hopes by the Roots, and was interpreted
<PB N="553" REF="5630"/>
by that Party, as an Act of Providence to establish their Monstrous Murthers and Usurpation. And it may be justly said, and transmitted as a truth to Posterity, that there were very few Men, who bore a part in these changes and giddy revolutions, who had the least purpose or thought to contribute towards the King's Restoration, or who wish'd well to his Interest; they who did so, being so totally suppressed and dispirited, that they were only at gaze, what light might break out of this darkness, and what order Providence might produce out of this confusion. This was the true State of affairs when the King return'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Condition of the King at</HI> Brussels.</NOTE> from <HI>Fuentarabia</HI> to <HI>Brussels,</HI> or within few days after; and therefore <MILESTONE N="10"/> 'tis no wonder, that there was that dejection of Spirit upon those about his Majesty; and that the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who saw so little hope of re∣turning into <HI>England,</HI> was well pleased with the condition that was of∣fer'd him in <HI>Spain,</HI> and that his Servants were impatient to find him in possession of it.</P>
<P>WHILST the divisions had continued in the Army, and the Parlia∣ment seem'd entirely deposed and laid aside, and no body imagin'd a possibility of any composition without blood, the Cardinal himself, as is said before, and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ministers, seem'd ready and prepared to advance any design of the King's. But when they saw all those conten∣tions <MILESTONE N="20"/> and raging Animosities composed, or suppressed, without one broken head, and those very Men again in possession of the Government and the Army, who had been so scornfully rejected and trampled upon, and who had it now in their power, as well as their purpose, to level all those preheminences which had overlook'd them, they look'd upon the Parliament as more securely settled against domestic disturbances, and much more formidably, with reference to their Neighbours, than it had been under <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself; and thought of nothing more, than how to make advantageous and firm Alliances with it.</P>
<P>THERE remain'd only within the King's own breast some faint hope <MILESTONE N="30"/> (and God knows it was very faint) that <HI>Monk</HI>'s march into <HI>England</HI> might yet produce some alteration. His Majesty had a secret correspon∣dence with some principal Officers in his Army, who were much trusted by him, and had promised great Services; and it was presum'd that they would undertake no such perilous Engagement without His privity and connivance. Besides, it might be expected from his judgement, that whatever present conditions the governing Party might give him, for the Service he had done, he could not but conclude, that they would be allways jealous of the Power they saw he was possessed of, and that an Army that had marched so far barely upon his word, would be as <MILESTONE N="40"/> ready to march to any place, or for any purpose, he would conduct them. And it was evident enough that the Parliament resolv'd to new model their Army, and to have no Man in any such extent of Command, as to be able to controle Their Counsels. Then his Majesty knew they were jealous of his fidelity, how much soever they courted him at that time; and therefore <HI>Monk</HI> would think himself obliged to provide for his own safety and security.</P>
<P>BUT, I say, these were but faint hopes, grounded upon such proba∣bilities as despairing Men are willing to entertain. The truth is, those Officers had honest Inclinations; and, as wise Men, had concluded, <MILESTONE N="50"/> that, from those frequent Shuffles, some Game at last might fall out that might prove to the King's Advantage, and so were willing to be∣speak their own welcome by an early application; which, in regard of
<PB N="554" REF="5640"/>
the Persons trusted by them, they concluded would be attended with no danger. But it never appear'd they ever gave the General the least cause to imagine they had any such Affection; and if they had, 'tis like∣ly they had paid dearly for it. And it was the King's great happiness, that the General never own'd his purpose to serve his Majesty, till it fell to be in his power, and indeed was the best thing in his power to do. If he had declared his resolution sooner, he had been destroyed himself; the whole Machine being so infinitely above his strength, that it could be only moved by a Divine hand; and it is Glory enough to his Me∣mory, that he was God's Instrument in bringing those mighty things to pass, which, undoubtedly, no one Man living had, of himself, either Wisdom enough to foresee, or Understanding to contrive, or Courage to attempt, and execute.</P>
<P>WHEN the Parliament found themselves at so much ease, and so much without apprehension of farther insecurity, they heartily wish'd that General <HI>Monk</HI> was again in his old Quarters in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk <HI>marches to∣wards</HI> Lon∣don.</NOTE> he continued his march towards <HI>London,</HI> without expecting their Or∣ders, so they knew not how to command him to return, whom they had sent for to assist them, without seeing him, and giving him thanks and reward for his great Service: <Q>yet they sent to him their desire, “that” <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment desire, that part of his Forces may be sent back to</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> a good part of his Forces might be sent back to <HI>Scotland;</HI></Q> and He, <MILESTONE N="20"/> having sent back as many as he knew would be sufficient for any Work they could have to do in those Northern parts, continued his march with an Army of about five thousand Foot and Horse, consisting of such Persons in whose affections to him he had full confidence. When he came to <HI>York,</HI> he found that City in the possession of the Lord <HI>Fair∣fax;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk <HI>comes to</HI> York</NOTE> who receiv'd him with open Armes, as if he had drawn those Forces together, and scised upon that place, to prevent the Army's pos∣sessing it, and to make <HI>Monk</HI>'s Advance into <HI>England</HI> the less inter∣rupted.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that, upon a Letter from the King, deliver'd to <HI>Fair∣fax</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Fairfax<HI>'s part in this whole business.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30"/> by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Horatio Townsend,</HI> and with his sole privity, and upon a pre∣sumption that General <HI>Monk</HI> brought good Affections with him for his Majesty's Service, that Lord had call'd together some of his old dis∣banded Officers and Soldiers, and many principal Gentlemen of the Country, and marched in the head of them into <HI>York,</HI> some time after that <HI>Lambert</HI> was passed towards <HI>New-Castle,</HI> with a full resolution to declare for the King; but when he could not afterwards discover, upon conference with <HI>Monk,</HI> that he had any such thought, he satisfied him∣self with the Testimony of his own Conscience, and presently dismissed <MILESTONE N="40"/> his Troops, being well contented with having, in the head of the prin∣cipal Gentlemen of that large County, presented their desires to the Ge∣neral, first in Person, and afterwards in Writing, <Q>“that he would be instrumental to restore the Nation to Peace and Security, and to the enjoying those Rights and Liberties, which by the Law were due to them, and of which they had been robb'd and depriv'd by so many years distractions; and that, in order thereunto, he would prevail, either for the restoring those Members which had been excluded in the year 1648 by force and violence, that they might exercise that Trust the Kingdom had reposed in them; or that a free and full Par∣liament <MILESTONE N="50"/> might be called by the Votes of the People; to which all Sub∣jects” had a Right by their birth.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="555" REF="5650"/>
THE principal Persons of all Counties through which the General <NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Addresses to</HI> Monk <HI>from all Counties as he passed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The City sent to him by their Sword-Bearer to the same purpose.</HI></P>
<P><HI>His manner of receiving these Addresses.</HI></P></NOTE> passed, flocked to him in a Body with Addresses to the same purpose. The City of <HI>London</HI> sent a Letter to him by their Sword-Bearer as far as to <HI>Morpeth,</HI> to offer their Service; and all concluded for a free Par∣liament, legally chosen by the free Votes of the People. He received all with much civility, and few words; <Q>took all occasions publickly to de∣clare “”that nothing should shake his fidelity to the present Parliament;</Q> yet privately assured those, who he thought it necessary should hope well, <Q>“”that he would procure a free Parliament:</Q> so that every body pro∣mised himself that which he most wished. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THE Parliament was far from being confident that <HI>Monk</HI> was above temptation: the manner of his march with suc a Body, his receiving so many Addresses from the People, and his treating Malignants so civilly, startled them much; and though his Professions of fidelity to the Par∣liament, and referring all determinations to Their Wisdom, had a good Aspect towards them, yet they feared that he might observe too much how generally odious they were grown to the People, which might lessen his reverence towards them. To prevent this as much as might be, and to give some check to that licence of Addresses, and resort of Malignants, they sent two of their Members of most credit with them, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment sends</HI> Scot <HI>and</HI> Ro∣binson <HI>to meet him.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Scot</HI> and <HI>Robinson,</HI> under pretence of giving their thanks to him for the Service he had done, to continue and be present with him, and to dis∣countenance, and reprehend any boldness that should appear in any De∣linquents. But this served but to draw more Affronts upon them; for those Gentlemen who were civilly used by the General, would not bear any disrespect from those of whose Persons they had all Contempt; and for the Authority of those who sent them, had no kind of reverence. Assoon as the City knew of the deputing those two Members, they likewise sent four of their principal Citizens, to perform the same Com∣pliments, and to confirm him in his inclinations to a free Parliament, <MILESTONE N="30"/> as the remedy all Men desired.</P>
<P>HE continued his march with very few halts, till he came to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Al∣bans.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At S<SUP>t</SUP></HI> Albans <HI>he sent to the Parliament to have the other Regiments re∣mov'd out of Town.</HI></NOTE> <Q>There he stopped for some days; and sent to the Parliament, “that he had some apprehension that those Regiments and Troops of the Army who had formerly deserted them, though for the present they were returned to their obedience, would not live peaceably with his” Men;</Q> <Q>and therefore desired that all the Soldiers (except one or two Regiments, which he named) “who were then quarter'd in the <HI>Strand, Westminster,</HI> or other Suburbs of the City, might be presently re∣moved, and sent to more distant Quarters, that there might be room” <MILESTONE N="40"/> for his Army.</Q> This Message was unexpected, and exceedingly per∣plexed them; and made them see their Fate would still be under the force and awe of an Army. However they found it necessary to com∣ply; and sent their Orders to all Soldiers to depart; which, with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment gives Or∣ders accord∣ingly.</NOTE> reason and ground of their resolution, was so disdainfully receiv'd, that a Mutiny did arise amongst the Soldiers; and the Regiment that was quarter'd in <HI>Somerset</HI> House, expresly refused to obey those Orders; so that there were like to be new Uproars. But their Officers, who would have been glad to inflame them upon such an occasion, were under re∣straint, or absent: and so at last all was well composed, and Officers <MILESTONE N="50"/> and Soldiers removed to the Quarters assign'd them, with animosity enough against those who were to succeed them in their old ones. And <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk <HI>marches in a∣bout the be∣ginning of</HI> Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> in the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> General <HI>Monk</HI> with his Army marched
<PB N="556" REF="5660"/>
through the City into the <HI>Strand,</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> where it was quar∣ter'd; his own Lodgings being provided for him in <HI>White-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>HE was shortly after conducted to the Parliament. There he had a <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is con∣ducted to the Parliament, and compli∣mented by the Speaker.</NOTE> Chair appointed for him to fit in; <Q>and the Speaker made him a Speech to this effect, “that though it was God, and not Man, who had done this great work, and ought to have the Glory of it; yet the Influence of that Glory extended to Him the Instrument, as a reward of his pru∣dent and wise Conduct: that when their Friends had left them, and there was a great defection in duty and trust, so that the whole Na∣tion seem'd to be exposed to the utmost ruin; they discern'd, as the Prophet did, a little Cloud afar off, and in His hand which had <MILESTONE N="10"/> dispersed the Miseries of these Nations, and was become a glorious Mercy to them all: that the House had a true resentment of his Ser∣vice, and return'd their hearty thanks to Him, and all his Officers and” Soldiers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE General was not a Man of Eloquence or Volubility of Speech; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk<HI>'s Re∣ply.</HI></NOTE> but after having thanked them, “for the honour they had done him for” but doing his duty;</Q> <Q>he told them, “that, in his march from <HI>Scotland,</HI> several Applications, with numerous Subscriptions, had been made to him, for a full and free Parliament, for admittance of the secluded <MILESTONE N="20"/> Members without any previous Oath or Engagement; and that this Parliament would determine their Sitting: to all which he had an∣swer'd, that they were now a free Parliament; and that they had voted to fill up their House, and then they would be a full Parliament; and that they had already determin'd their Sitting. But as for the se∣cluded Members, this Parliament had already given judgement in it, in which all People ought to acquiesce; and that to admit any Mem∣bers to sit in Parliament, without a previous Oath to preserve the Go∣vernment in being, was never done in <HI>England.</HI> But now he craved pardon to say to themselves, that the less Oaths or Engagements were <MILESTONE N="30"/> imposed, their Settlement would be the sooner attain'd to: that He knew, all the sober Gentry would close with them, if they might be tenderly and gently used: that it was their common Concernment to amplify, not to lessen, their Interest, and to be careful that neither the Cavalier nor the Fanatick Party should have yet a share in the Ci∣vil,” or Military Power.</Q></P>
<P>THE rest of his Speech concern'd <HI>Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> And all being spoken with more than his natural warmth, there were some Expressions in it which they disliked. But others gave them some ease, and hope that he would be faithful, though inwardly they heartily <MILESTONE N="40"/> wish'd that he was again in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that they had been left to contend with the Malignity of their old Army; and they watched for some occasion that he might manifest his fidelity and resignation to them, or give them just occasion to suspect and question it.</P>
<P>THE late confusions and interruptions of all publick receipts had wholely emptied their Coffers, out of which the Army, and all other expences, were to be supplied. And though the Parliament had, upon their coming together again, renewed their Ordinances for all Collections and Payments, yet Money came in very slowly; and the People gene∣rally had so little reverence for their Legislators, that they gave very <MILESTONE N="50"/> slow obedience to their directions: so that they found it necessary, for their present supply, till they might by degrees make themselves more universally obey'd, to require the City presently to collect and bring in
<PB N="557" REF="5670"/>
the Arrears of their Taxes, and in the mean time to borrow a considera∣ble Sum of Money of them; which could not be easily done but by the advice, and with the consent of the Common-Council; that is, it could not be levied and collected orderly, and peaceably, without their distri∣bution.</P>
<P>THE Common-Council was constituted of such Persons as were weary <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Common-Council of the City are re∣fractory to the Parliament</NOTE> of the Parliament, and would in no degree submit to, or comply with any of their Commands. They did not only utterly refuse to consent to what was demanded, but, in the debate of it, excepted against the Authority, and, upon the matter, declared, <Q>“that they would never <MILESTONE N="10"/> submit to any Imposition that was not granted by a free and lawful” Parliament.</Q> And it was generally believ'd, that they had assumed this courage upon some confidence they had in the General; and the Apprehension of this, made the Parliament to be in the greater per∣plexity and distraction. This refusal would immediately have put an end to their Empire; they therefore resolved upon this occasion to make a full Experiment of their own power, and of their General's obedience.</P>
<P>THE Parliament having received a full information from those Al∣dermen, and others, whose Interest was bound up with their's, of all <MILESTONE N="20"/> that had passed at the Common-Council, and of the seditious discourses and expressions made by several of the Citizens, referr'd it to the consi∣deration of the Council of State, what was fit to be done towards the Rebellious City, to reduce them to that submission which they ought to pay to the Parliament. <Q>The Council of State deliberated upon the mat∣ter, and return'd their Advice to the Parliament, “that some part of the Army might be sent into the City, and remain there, to preserve the peace thereof, and of the Common-wealth, and to reduce it to the obedience of the Parliament. In order thereunto, and for their better humiliation, they thought it convenient that the Posts and Chains should be removed from, and out of the several Streets of the <MILESTONE N="30"/> City; and that the Portcullises, and Gates of the City, should be taken” down and broken.</Q> <Q>Over and above this, they named ten or eleven Persons, who had been the principal Conductors in the Common-Council, all Citizens of great reputation; and advised “that they should be ap∣prehended and committed to Prison, and that thereupon a new Com∣mon-Council” might be elected, that would be more at their Devotion.</Q></P>
<P>THIS round advice was embraced by the Parliament; and they had now a fit occasion to make experiment of the courage and fidelity of their General, and commanded him to march into the City with his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk <HI>sent in∣to the City to reduce it to obedience:</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"/> Army, and to execute all those particulars which they thought so ne∣cessary to their Service and He as readily executed their Commands; led his Army into the Town on <HI>Feb.</HI> the 9<SUP>th</SUP>, neglected the entreaties and prayers of all who applied to him (whereof there were many who be∣lieved he meant better towards them) caused as many, as he could, of those who were so proscribed to be apprehended, and sent them to the Tower; and, with all the circumstances of contempt, pull'd down and broke the Gates and Portcullises, to the confusion and consternation of the whole City; and having thus exposed it to the scorn and laughter of all who hated it, he return'd Himself to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and his Army <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Returns <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> White-Hall</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> to their former Quarters. And by this last Act of compliance he fru∣strated the present hopes of those who had expected better from him, and confirm'd his Masters, that they could not be too confident of his
<PB N="558" REF="5680"/>
obedience to their most extravagant Injunctions. And many at that time feared, that if the Parliament had cultivated this tame resignation of his, with any temper and discretion, by preparing his consent and ap∣probation to their proceedings, they might have found a full condescen∣sion from him, at least no opposition to all their other Counsels. But they were so infatuated with pride and insolence, that they could not discern the ways to their own preservation.</P>
<P>WHILST He was executing this their Tyranny upon the City, They were contriving how to lessen his power and Authority, and resolv'd to joyn others with him in the Command of the Army; and, upon that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment resolve to joyn others in Commission with him, and receive a Peti∣tion by</HI> Bare∣bone <HI>from the Fanaticks.</HI></NOTE> very day, they received a Petition, which they had fomented, pre∣sented <MILESTONE N="10"/> to the Parliament by a Man notorious in those times, and who hath been formerly mention'd, <HI>Praise-God Barebone,</HI> in the head of a crowd of Sectaries. The Petition begun with all the imaginable bitter∣ness and reproaches upon the Memory of the late King, and against the Person of the present King, and all the Nobility, Clergy, and Gen∣try of the Kingdom, which adhered to him; the utter Extirpation of all which it pressed with great Acrimony. It took notice of many dis∣courses of calling a new Parliament, at least of admitting those Mem∣bers to sit in the present Parliament, who had been excluded in the year <MILESTONE N="20"/> 1648; <Q>“”either of which, the Petitioners said,</Q> <Q>“would prove the inevi∣table” destruction of all the Godly in the Land:</Q> <Q>and therefore they besought them with all earnestness, “that no Person whatsoever might be admitted to the exercise of any Office or Function in the State, or in the Church, no not so much as to teach a School, who did not first take the Oath of Abjuration of the King, and of all his Family, and that he would never submit to the Government of any One single Person whatsoever; and that whosoever should presume so much as to pro∣pose, or mention the Restoration of the King in Parliament, or any other place, should be adjudged guilty of, and condemn'd for High-Treason.”</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>THIS Petition was receiv'd with great approbation by the House, their Affection much applauded, and the thanks of the Parliament very solemnly return'd by the Speaker: all which information the General receiv'd at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> when he return'd out of the City; and was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk<HI>'s chief Officers discon∣tented at this neglect of the Parliament of their General.</HI></NOTE> presently attended by his chief Officers; <Q>who, with open mouths, in∣veighed against the proceedings of the Parliament, “their manifest in∣gratitude to him, and the indignity offer'd to him, in giving such coun∣tenance to a rabble of infamous Varlets, who desired to set the whole Kingdom in a flame, to comply with their Fanatick and mad Enthu∣siasmes; <MILESTONE N="40"/> and that the Parliament would never have admitted such an infamous Address with approbation, except they had first resolv'd upon His ruin and destruction; which he was assuredly to look for, if he” did not prevent it by his Wisdom, and Sagacity;</Q> and thereupon told him of the under-hand Endeavours which were used to work upon the Affections of the Soldiers.</P>
<P>THE General had been prepared, by the conferences of <HI>Scot</HI> and <HI>Ro∣binson</HI> in the march, to expect, that, assoon as he came to the Parlia∣ment, he must take the Oath of Abjuration of the King and his Family. <Q>And therefore they had advised him “to offer the taking it himself, be∣fore <MILESTONE N="50"/> it should be proposed to him, as a matter that would confirm all” Men in an entire confidence in him.</Q> When he came to the Parlia∣ment, they forbore, that day, to mention it, being a day dedicated only
<PB N="559" REF="5690"/>
to caress him, and to give him thanks, in which it could not be sea∣sonable to mingle any thing of distrust. But they meant roundly to have pressed him to it, if this last opportunity, which they look'd upon as a better earnest of his fidelity, had not fallen out; and they thought he had not then taken any such resolution, as would have made him pause in the giving them that satisfaction. But being now awaken'd by <NOTE PLACE="marg">This <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> him</NOTE> this Alarm from his Officers, and the temper they were in, and his flegm a little curdled, he begun to think himself in danger; and that this body of Men, that was called the Parliament, had not reputation enough to preserve themselves, and those who adher'd to them. He had observ'd <MILESTONE N="10"/> throughout the Kingdom, as he marched, how despicable they were in the estimation of all Men, who gave them no other term or appellation but the <HI>Rump,</HI> as the fag end of a Carcase long since expired. All that night was spent in consultation with his Officers; nor did he then form any other design than so to unite his Army to him, that they might not leave him in any resolution he should think sit to take.</P>
<P>IN the morning, which was very soon after he had broken the Gates <NOTE PLACE="marg">He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again into the City, and send: an expostula¦tory Letter to the Parlia¦ment.</NOTE> and the hearts of the City, he called his Army again together, and march'd with it into <HI>London,</HI> taking up his own Quarters at an Alder∣man's House. <Q>At the same time he left <HI>White-Hall,</HI> he sent a Letter <MILESTONE N="20"/> to the Parliament, in which he roundly took notice of “their unrea∣sonable, unjust, and unpolitick proceedings; of their abetting and countenancing wicked, and unchristian Tenents in reference to Reli∣gion, and such as would root out the practice of any Religion; of their underhand corresponding with those very Persons whom they had declared to be Enemies, and who had been principally instrumental in all the affronts and indignities they had undergone, in and after” their dissolution.</Q> <Q>Thereupon he advised them in such Terms as they could not but understand for the most peremptory Command, “that, in” such a time (a time prescribed in his Letter)</Q> <Q>“they would issue out Writs for a new Parliament, that so their own sitting might be deter∣mined; <MILESTONE N="30"/> which was the only Expedient, that could return peace and happiness to the Kingdom, and which both the Army and Kingdom” expected at their hands.</Q> This Letter was no sooner deliver'd to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Letter to the Parlia∣ment printed and dispersed.</NOTE> House, than it was printed, and carefully published, and dispersed throughout the City, to the end that they who had been so lately and so wofully disappointed, might see how throughly he was embarked, and so entertain no new Jealousies of him.</P>
<P>AFTER he had dined with the Lord Mayor, and disposed his Army in such a manner and order as he thought fit, he desired Him, and the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Aldermen, with the Common Council, to meet him at the <HI>Guild-Hall;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">He meets the Lord Mayor and Common Council, ex∣cuses what was past, and pro∣mises to stand by them, and They by him. Great re∣joicing in the City upon it</NOTE> where, after many Excuses for the work of the other day, they plighted their troth each to other in such a manner, for the perfect Union and adhering to each other for the future, that, assoon as they came from thence, the Lord Mayor attended the General to his Lodgings, and all the Bells of the City proclaim'd, and testified to the Town and King∣dom, that the Army and the City were of one mind. And assoon as the Evening came, there was a continued light of Bone-fires throughout the City and Suburbs, with such an universal exclamation of joy, as had never been known, and cannot be expressed, with such ridiculous <MILESTONE N="50"/> signs of Scorn and Contempt of the Parliament, as testified the no-regard, or rather the notable detestation they had of it; there being scarce a Bone-fire at which they did not roast a Rump, and pieces of flesh made
<PB N="560" REF="5700"/>
like one; <Q>“”which, they said,</Q> <Q>“was for the celebration of the Funeral” of the Parliament:</Q> and there can be no invention of fancy, wit, or ribaldry, that was not that night exercised to defame the Parliament, and to magnify the General.</P>
<P>IN such a huddle and mixture of loose People of all conditions, and such a transport of Affections, it could not be otherwise but that some Men would drink the King's Health; which was taken no notice of; nor was it known that one Person of condition did once presume to mention him. All this, how much soever it amazed and distracted the Parliament, did not so dishearten them, but that they continued still to <MILESTONE N="10"/> sit, and proceeded in all things with their usual confidence. They were not willing to despair of recovering their General again to them; and, to that purpose, they sent a Committee to treat with him, and to make <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment sent some Members to treat with him.</NOTE> all such profers to him as they conceiv'd were most like to comply with his Ambition. The entertainment he gave this Committee, was the engaging them in a conference with another Committee of the excluded <NOTE PLACE="marg">He engages them in a con∣ference with some secluded Members.</NOTE> Members, to the end that he might be satisfied by hearing both, how one could have right to sit there as a Parliament, and the other be ex∣cluded: <Q>and when he had heard them all, he made no scruple to declare, “that in justice the secluded Members ought to be admitted before the” <MILESTONE N="20"/> calling another Parliament, and the dissolution of this.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER He had put the City into the posture they desired, and found no danger threaten'd him from thence, he return'd again to his Quarters <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He returns to</HI> White-Hall.</NOTE> in <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and disposed his Army to those Posts which he judged most convenient. <Q>He then sent for the Members of the Parliament to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sends for Members of both Parties.</NOTE> come to him, and many others who had been excluded, and lamented “the sad condition the Kingdom was in, which he principally imputed to the disunion, and divisions, which had arisen in Parliament among those who were faithful to the Common-wealth: that he had had ma∣ny Conferences with them together, and was satisfied by those Gen∣tlemen, <MILESTONE N="30"/> who had been excluded, of their integrity; and therefore he had desired this Conference between them, that he might communi∣cate his own thoughts to them; in doing whereof, that he might not be mistaken in his Delivery, or misapprehended in his Expressions,” as he had lately been, he had put what he had a mind to say in writing;</Q> <NOTE PLACE="marg">He delivers his mind to them in a paper.</NOTE> which he Commanded his Secretary to read to them: and was as follows.</P>

<P><Q>“IT appears unto me, by what I have heard from You and the whole Nation, that the peace and happy settlement of these bleeding Na∣tions,
<PB N="561" REF="5710"/>
next under God, lieth in Your hands. And when I consider that wisdom, piety, and self-denial, which I have reason to be confident, lodgeth in you, and how great a share of the Nations sufferings will fall upon you, in case the Lord deny us now a settlement, I am in very good hopes, there will be found in you all, such melting Bowels to∣wards these poor Nations, and towards one another, that you will be∣come healers, and makers up, of all its woful Breaches. And that such an opportunity may clearly appear to be in your hands, I thought good to assure you, and that in the presence of God, that I have no∣thing before my eyes but God's Glory, and the settlement of these Na∣tions upon Common-wealth Foundations. In pursuit whereof I shall <MILESTONE N="10"/> think nothing too dear; and for my Own particular, I shall throw my self down at your feet to be any thing or nothing in order to these great Ends. As to the way of future settlement, far be it from me to impose any thing; I desire you may be in perfect freedom; only give me leave to mind you, that the Old Foundations are by God's Provi∣dence so broken, that, in the eye of Reason, they cannot be restored but upon the ruins of the People of these Nations, that have engaged for their Rights, in defence of the Parliament, and the great and main ends of the Covenant, for uniting and making the Lord's Name One <MILESTONE N="20"/> in the Three Nations: and also the Liberty of the People's Repre∣sentatives in Parliament will be certainly lost; for if the People find, that after so long and bloody a War against the King for break∣ing in upon their Liberties, yet at last he must be taken in again, it will be out of question, and is most manifest, he may for the fu∣ture govern by his Will, dispose of Parliaments and Parliament-Men as he pleaseth, and yet the People will never more rise for As∣sistance.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“AND as to the Interest of this famous City (which hath been in all Ages the Bulwark of Parliaments, and unto whom I am for their great Affection so deeply engaged) certainly it must lye in a Com∣mon-wealth; <MILESTONE N="30"/> that Government only being capable to make them, through the Lord's Blessing, the Metropolis and Bank of the Trade for all <HI>Christendom;</HI> whereunto God and Nature hath fitted them” above others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“AND as to a Government in the Church, the want whereof hath been no small Cause of these Nations distractions, it is most manifest, that if it be Monarchical in the State, the Church must follow, and Prelacy must be brought in; which these Nations, I know, cannot” bear, and against which they have so solemnly Sworn.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“AND indeed moderate, not rigid Presbyterian Government, with a <MILESTONE N="40"/> sufficient Liberty for Consciences truly tender, appears at present to be the most indifferent and acceptable way to the Church's settle∣ment.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“THE main thing that seems to lye in the way, is the Interest of the Lords, even of those Lords who have shew'd themselves Noble in∣deed, by joyning with the People, and in defence of those just Rights have adventured their dearest Blood and large Estates. To that I shall only say, that though the state of these Nations be such, as cannot bear their sitting in a distinct House; yet, certainly, the Wisdom of <MILESTONE N="50"/> Parliament will find out such Hereditary Marks of Honour for them,” as may make them more Noble in after Ages.</Q></P>

<P>DIVERS who heard this, thought there was no dissimulation in it, in order to cover and conceal his good intentions for the King: for, <MILESTONE N="40"/> without doubt, he had not to this hour seem'd to them to have any purpose, or thought to serve him, but appear'd to be really of the opi∣nion he expressed in his Paper, that it was a work impossible. So that they thought he desired nothing, but that he might see a Common-wealth establish'd in such a Model as <HI>Holland</HI> was, where he had been bred; and that himself might enjoy the authority and place which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> possessed in that Government. He had not, from his march∣ing out of <HI>Scotland</HI> to this time, had much publick conversation with any Persons who had serv'd the King; nor had he hitherto, or for some time after, did he set one of the King's Friends at Liberty, though all the Prisons were full of them; but on the contrary, they were every <MILESTONE N="50"/> day committed by the Rump-Parliament; and with them it was guilt enough to be suspected but to wish for the King's Restoration.</P>
<P><PB N="563" REF="5730"/>
AS SOON as the Conference above-mention'd was ended with the Members of the Parliament, They who had been excluded from the year 1648, repair'd to the House on <HI>Feb.</HI> the 21<SUP>st</SUP>, and without any in∣terruption, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The seconded Members go to the House.</P>
<P>Their Trans∣actions there.</P></NOTE> which they had hitherto found, took their places; and being superior in number to the rest, they first repealed and abolish'd all the Orders by which they had been excluded; then they provided for Him who had so well provided for Them, by renewing and enlarging the Ge∣neral's Commission, and revoking all other Commissions which had been granted to any to meddle with, or assign Quarters to any part of the Forces.</P>
<P>THEY who had sate before, had put the whole Militia of the King∣dom <MILESTONE N="10"/> into the hands of Sectaries, Persons generally of no degree or qua∣lity, and notorious only for some new Tenent in Religion, and for some barbarity exercised upon the King's Party. All these Commissions were revoked, and the Militia put under the Government of the Nobility, and principal Gentry throughout the Kingdom; yet with this care and exception, that no Person should be capable of being trusted in that Pro∣vince, who did not first declare under his hand, <Q>“that he did confess, and acknowledge, that the War raised by the two Houses of Parlia∣ment against the late King, was just, and lawful, until such time as” force and violence was used upon the Parliament in the year 1648.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P>IN the last place, they raised an Assessment of one hundred thousand pounds by the Month, for the payment of the Army, and defraying the Publick expences for six Months, to which the whole Kingdom willing∣ly submitted; and the City of <HI>London,</HI> upon the credit and security of that Act, advanced as much ready Money as they were desired; and having thus far redressed what was past, and provided as well as they could for the future, they issued out Writs to call a Parliament, to meet <NOTE PLACE="marg">They issue Writs for a New Parlia∣ment: and dissolve them∣selves, and ap∣point a New Council of State.</NOTE> upon the five and twentieth day of <HI>April</HI> next ensuing (being <HI>April</HI> 1660) and then, on the sixteenth, or seventeenth day of <HI>March,</HI> after they had appointed a Council of State, of which there were many so∣ber and honest Gentlemen, who did not wish the King ill, they dissolv'd <MILESTONE N="30"/> that present Parliament, against all the importunities used by the Secta∣ries (who in Multitudes flocked together, and made Addresses in the Name of their Party in the City of <HI>London,</HI> that they would not dis∣solve themselves) but to the unspeakable Joy of all the rest of the King∣dom; who, notwithstanding their very different affections, expectations, and designs, were unanimous in their weariness and detestation of the long Parliament.</P>
<P>WHEN the King, who had rather an imagination, than an expecta∣tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Assairs at</HI> Brussels <HI>during this time.</HI></NOTE> that the march of General <HI>Monk</HI> to <HI>London</HI> with his Army might produce some alteration that might be useful to him, heard of his entire <MILESTONE N="40"/> submission to the Parliament, and of his entring the City, and disarm∣ing it, the Commitment of the principal Citizens, and breaking their Gates and Portcullises, all the little remainder of his hopes was extin∣guished, and he had nothing left before his Eyes but a perpetual Exile, attended with all those discomforts, whereof he had too long Experience, and which, he must now expect, would be improved with the worst circumstances of neglect, which use to wait upon that condition. A greater consternation and dejection of mind cannot be imagin'd than at that time cover'd the small Court of the King; but God did not suffer him long to be wrapp'd up in that melancholic Cloud. As the General's <MILESTONE N="50"/> second march into the City was within two or three days after his first, and dispell'd the mists and fogs which the other had raised, so the very
<PB N="564" REF="5740"/>
Evening of that day which had brought the News of the first in the Mor∣ning, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King hears on the same day of both the marches of the General into the City.</NOTE> brought likewise an Account to his Majesty of the second, with all the circumstances of Bells, and Bonefires, and burning of Rumps, and such other Additions, as might reasonably be true, and which a willing Relator would not omit.</P>
<P>WHEN it begun to be dark, the Lord Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> brought a young Man with him to the Chancellor's Lodging at <HI>Brussels;</HI> which was under the King's Bed-chamber, and to which his Majesty every day vouchsafed to come for the dispatch of any business. <Q>The Marquis said no more but “that that Man had formerly been an Officer under him, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and he believed he was an honest Man; besides, that he brought a line or two of Credit from a Person they would both believe; but that his discourse was so strange and extravagant, that he knew not what to” think of it;</Q> however, he would call the King to judge; and so went out of the Room leaving the Man there, and immediately return'd with the King.</P>
<P>THE Man's name was <HI>Baily;</HI> who had liv'd most in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had serv'd there as a Foot Officer under the Marquis. He looked as if he had drank much, or slept little: <Q>his Relation was, “that in the Af∣ternoon of such a day, he was with S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Stephens</HI> in <HI>Lambeth</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> House, used then as a Prison for many of the King's friends; where, whilst they were in conference together, News was brought into the House by several Persons, that the General was marched with his whole Army into the City (it being within two or three days after he had been there, and broke down their Gates, and pull'd down their Posts) and that he had a conference with the Mayor and Aldermen; which was no sooner ended, but that all the City Bells rang out; and He heard the Bells very plain at <HI>Lambeth:</HI> and that he staid there so late, till they saw the Bonefires burning and flaming in the City: upon which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Stephens</HI> had desired him, that he would immediately <MILESTONE N="30"/> cross the River, and go into <HI>London,</HI> and inquire what the matter was; and if he found any thing extraordinary in it, that he would take Post, and make all possible hast to <HI>Brussels,</HI> that the King might be inform'd of it; and so gave him a short Note in Writing to the Marquis of <HI>Or∣mond,</HI> that he might believe all that the Messenger would inform him: that thereupon he went over the River, walked through <HI>Cheap∣side,</HI> saw the Bonefires, and the King's health drank in several places, heard all that the General had done, and brought a Copy of the Let∣ter which the General had sent to the Parliament, at the time when he return'd with his Army into the City; and then told many things,” <MILESTONE N="40"/> which were, he said,</Q> <Q>“publickly spoken, concerning sending for the King: that then he took Post for <HI>Dover,</HI> and hired a Bark that brought” him to <HI>Ostend.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE time was so short from the hour he left <HI>London,</HI> that the ex∣pedition of his journey was incredible; nor could any man undertake to come from thence in so short a time, upon the most important Affair, and for the greatest reward. It was evident by many pauses and hesita∣tions in his discourse, and some Repetitions, that the Man was not composed, and at best wanted sleep; yet his Relation could not be a meer fiction and imagination. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Stephens</HI> was a Man well known <MILESTONE N="50"/> to his Majesty, and the other two; and had been sent over lately by the King, with some advice to his friends; and it was well known, that he had been apprehended at his landing, and was sent Prisoner to <HI>Lam∣beth</HI>
<PB N="565" REF="5750"/>
House. And though he had not mention'd in his Note any parti∣culars, yet he had given him credit, and nothing but the Man's own Devotion to the King could reasonably tempt him to undertake so hazardous and chargeable a journey. Then the General's Letter to the Parliament was of the highest moment, and not like to be feign'd; and upon the whole matter, the King thought he had Argument to raise his own Spirits, and that he should do but justly in communicating his Intelligence to his dispirited Family, and Servants; who, upon the News thereof, were revived proportionably to the despair they had swal∣low'd; and, according to the temper of Men who had lain under long <MILESTONE N="10"/> disconsolation, thought all their Sufferings over; and laid in a stock of such vast hopes, as would be very hard for any success to procure sa∣tisfaction for.</P>
<P>BUT the King, who thanked God for this new dawning of hope, and was much refresh'd with this unexpected Alteration, was yet restrain'd from any confidence that this would produce any such Revolution as would be sufficient to do his work; towards which he saw cause enough to despair of assistance from any Foreign power. The most that he could collect from the General's Letter, besides the suppressing the present Tyranny of the Rump-Parliament, was, that, possibly, at last the ex∣cluded <MILESTONE N="20"/> Members might be again admitted, and, it may be, able to go∣vern that Council. And even this Administer'd no solid ground of com∣fort or confidence to his Majesty. Several of those excluded Members had not been true Members of Parliament, but elected, after the end of the War, into Their places who had been expelled for adhering to the King; and so they had no title to sit there, but what the counter∣feit Great Seal had given them, without, and against the King's Autho∣rity. It was thought these Men, with others who had been Lawfully chosen, were willing, and desirous, that the Concessions made by the late King at the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> might be accepted; which in truth did, <MILESTONE N="30"/> with the preservation of the Name and Life of the King, near as much establish a Republican Government, as was settled after his Murther; and because they would insist upon that, they were, with those circum∣stances of force and violence, which are formerly mention'd, excluded from the House; without which that horrid Villany could never have been committed.</P>
<P>NOW what could the King reasonably expect from these Men's re∣admission into the Government, but that they would resume their old Conclusions, and press him to consent to his Father's Concessions? which his late Majesty yielded to with much less chearfulness, than he <MILESTONE N="40"/> walked to the Scaffold; <Q>though it was upon the promise of many power∣ful Men then in the Parliament, “that he should not be obliged to ac∣complish” that Agreement.</Q> These Revolvings wrought much upon his Majesty, though he thought it necessary to appear pleased with what he had heard, and to expect much greater things from it; which yet he knew not how to contribute to, till he should receive a farther Account from <HI>London</HI> of the Revolutions there.</P>
<P>INDEED, when all his Majesty had heard before, was confirm'd by several Expresses, who passed with much freedom, and were every day sent by his Friends, who had recover'd their Courage to the full, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> discerned that these excluded Members were principally admitted to prepare for the calling a New Parliament, and to be sure to make the dissolution of this unquestionable and certain, the King recover'd his
<PB N="566" REF="5760"/>
hopes again; which were every day increased by the Addresses of many Men, who had never before applied themselves to him; and many sent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many now apply to the King. The Council of State's kind behaviour now to the King's Friends.</NOTE> to him for his Majesty's approbation and leave to serve and sit in the next Parliament. And from the time that the Parliament was dissolv'd, the Council of State behaved themselves very civilly towards his Ma∣jesty's Friends, and released many of them out of Prison: particularly <HI>Annesley,</HI> when President of the Council, was very well contented that the King should receive particular Information of His Devotion, and of his Resolution to do him Service; which he manifested in many par∣ticulars of importance, and had the Courage to receive a Letter from <MILESTONE N="10"/> his Majesty, and return'd a dutiful Answer to it: all which had a very good aspect, and seem'd to promise much good. Yet the King knew not what to think of the General's Paper, which he had deliver'd at his Conference with the Members; for which he could seem to have no temptation, but his violent Affection to a Common-wealth. Few or None of his Majesty's Friends could find any means of address to him; yet they did believe, and were much the better for believing it, that the King had some secret correspondence with him. <Q>And some of them sent to the King, “of what importance it would be, that he gave them some credit, or means of Access to the General, by which they might <MILESTONE N="20"/> receive his Order and Direction in such things as occurr'd on the sud∣dain, and that they might be sure to do nothing that might cross any purpose of His. To which the King return'd no other Answer, but that they should have patience, and make no Attempt whatsoever;” and that in due time they should receive all Advertisements necessary;</Q> it being not thought fit to disclaim having intelligence with, or hopes of the General; since it was very evident, that the receiv'd opinion, that he did design to serve the King, or that he would be at last obliged to do it, whether he design'd to do it or no, did really as much contri∣bute to the Advancement of his Majesty's Service, as if he had dedi∣cated <MILESTONE N="30"/> himself to it. And the Assurance, that the other Party thought they had, that he had no such Intention, hinder'd those obstructions, jealousies, and interruptions, which very probably might have lessen'd his credit with his own Army, or united all the rest of the Forces against him.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd likewise at this time a business that very much troubled the King, and might very probably have destroy'd all the hopes that began to flatter him. Upon the Dissolution of the Parliament, which put an end to all the power and authority of those who had been the chief Instruments of all the monstrous things which had been done, <MILESTONE N="40"/> the highest despair seised upon all who had been the late King's Judges; who were sure to find as hard measure from the secluded Members, as they were to expect if the King himself had been restored. And all they who had afterwards concurr'd with them, and exercised the same power, who were call'd the <HI>Rump,</HI> believ'd their ruin and destruction to be certain, and at hand. And therefore they contrived all the ways they could to preserve themselves, and to prevent the assembling a new Par∣liament; which if they could interrupt, they made no doubt but the Rump Members would again resume the Government, notwithstand∣ing their Dissolution by the power of the secluded Members; who <MILESTONE N="50"/> would then pay dear for their presumption and intrusion.</P>
<P>TO this purpose, they employ'd their Agents amongst the Officers and Soldiers of the Army, who had been disgracefully remov'd from
<PB N="567" REF="5770"/>
their Quarters in the <HI>Strand,</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> and the parts adjacent to <HI>London,</HI> to make room for General <HI>Monk</HI>'s Army; which was now look'd upon as the sole Confiding part of the Army. And they inflamed these Men with the sense of their own desperate condition; who, having served throughout the War, should, besides the loss of all the Arrears of Pay due to them, be now offer'd as a sacrifice to the Cavaliers, whom they had conquer'd, and who, they supposed, were implacably incensed against them. Nor did they omit to make the same infusions into the Soldiers of General <HI>Monk</HI>'s Army, who had all the same title to the same fears and apprehensions. And when their minds were thus pre∣pared, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and ready to declare upon the first opportunity, <HI>Lambert</HI> made his escape out of the Tower; his Party having in all places so many of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lamberts <HI>escape out of the Tower</HI></NOTE> their Combination, that they could compass their designs of that kind whenever they thought fit; though the General had as great a jealousy of this Man's escape, as of any thing that could fall out to supplant him. And therefore, it may be presumed, he took all possible care to prevent it: and they who then had Command of the place, were notoriously known neither to love <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Person, nor to favour his Designs.</P>
<P>THIS escape of <HI>Lambert</HI> in such a conjuncture, the most perilous that it could fall out in, put the General, and the Council of State, into a great agony. They knew well what Poyson had been scatter'd about <MILESTONE N="20"/> the Army, and what impression it had made in the Soldiers. <HI>Lambert</HI> was the most popular Man, and had the greatest Influence upon them. And though they had lately deserted him, they had sufficiently publish'd their remorse, and their detestation of those who had seduced and cou∣sen'd them. So that there was little doubt to be made, now he was at liberty, but that they would flock and resort to him, assoon as they should know where to find him. On the other hand, no small danger was threaten'd from the very drawing the Army together to a Ren∣dezvous in order to prosecute and oppose him, no Man being able to make a judgement what they would choose to do in such a conjuncture, <MILESTONE N="30"/> when they were so full of jealousy and dissatisfaction. And it may very reasonably be believed, that if he had, after he found himself at liberty, lain conceal'd, till he had digested the Method he meant to proceed in, and procured some place to which the Troops might resort to declare with him, when he should appear (which had been very easy then for him to have done) he would have gone near to have shaken at least the Model the General had made.</P>
<P>BUT either through the fear of his security, and being betray'd into the hands of his Enemies (as all kind of treachery was at that time very active; of which he had experience) or the presumption, that the Ar∣my <MILESTONE N="40"/> would obey him upon his first Call; and that, if he could draw a small part to him, the rest would never appear against him; he preci∣pitated himself to make an attempt, before he was ready for it, or It for Him; and so put it into his Enemy's power to disappoint, and con∣trole all his designs. He staid not at all in <HI>London,</HI> as it was his Interest to have done, but hasten'd into the Country; and trusting a Gen∣tleman in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> whom he thought himself sure of, the Ge∣neral had quickly notice in what Quarter he was: yet, with great ex∣pedition, <HI>Lambert</HI> drew four Troops of the Army to him, with which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He draws four Troops of the Army to him near</HI> Daven¦try</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50"/> he had the courage to appear near <HI>Daventry</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> a Country famous for disaffection to the King, and for adhering to the Parliament; where he presumed he should be attended by other parts
<PB N="568" REF="5780"/>
of the Army, before it should be known at <HI>White-Hall</HI> where he was, and that any Forces could be sent from thence against him: of which, he doubted not, from his many friends, he should have seasonable Notice.</P>
<P>BUT the General, upon his first secret intimation of his being in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> and of the course he meant to take, had committed it to the charge and care of Colonel <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> (who was well known to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The General sends</HI> Ingolds∣by <HI>against him with his own Regiment, and a Body of Foot under Colonel</HI> Streater.</NOTE> be very willing and desirous to take revenge upon <HI>Lambert,</HI> for his ma∣lice to <HI>Oliver</HI> and <HI>Richard,</HI> and the Affront he had himself receiv'd from him) to attend and watch all his Motions with his own Regiment <MILESTONE N="10"/> of Horse; which was the more faithful to him for having been before seduced by <HI>Lambert</HI> to desert him. <HI>Ingoldsby,</HI> being joyn'd with a good Body of Foot under Colonel <HI>Streater,</HI> used so much diligence in wait∣ing upon <HI>Lambert</HI>'s motion, before he was suspected to be so near, that one of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s four Captains fell into the hands of his forlorne hope; who made him Prisoner, and brought him to their Colonel. The Captain was very well known to <HI>Ingoldsby;</HI> <Q>who, after some conference with him, gave him his Liberty, upon his promise, “that he would” himself retire to his House, and send his Troop to obey his Commands;</Q> which promise he observ'd; and the next day his Troop, under his <MILESTONE N="20"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>One of</HI> Lam∣bert's <HI>Troops revolts to</HI> In∣goldsby.</NOTE> Cornet and Quarter-Master, came to <HI>Ingoldsby,</HI> and inform'd him where <HI>Lambert</HI> was. He thereupon made hast, and was in his view, before the other had notice that he was pursued by him.</P>
<P>LAMBERT, surprised with this discovery, and finding that one of his Troops had forsaken him, saw his Enemy much superior to him in Number; and therefore sent to desire that they might treat together; which the other was content to do. <Q><HI>Lambert</HI> proposed to him, “that” they might restore <HI>Richard</HI> to be Protector;</Q> and promised to unite all his credit to the Support of that Interest. But <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> (besides that he well understood the folly and impossibility of that Undertaking) <MILESTONE N="30"/> had devoted himself to a better Interest; and adher'd to the General, because he presumed that He did intend to serve the King, and so re∣jected this Overture. Whereupon both Parties prepared to fight, when another of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Troops forsaking him, and putting themselves <NOTE PLACE="marg">and another also.</NOTE> under his Enemy, he concluded, that his safety would depend upon his flight; which he thought to secure by the swiftness of his Horse. But <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> keeping his eye still upon him, and being as well horsed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert <HI>and his Party dispersed. He and others taken.</HI></NOTE> overtook him, and made him his Prisoner, after he had in vain used great and much importunity to him, that he would permit him to escape.</P>
<P>WITH him were taken <HI>Cobbet, Creed,</HI> and some other Officers of <MILESTONE N="40"/> the greatest Interest with the Fanatick part of the Army, and who were most apprehended by the General, in a time when all the ways were full of Soldiers endeavouring to repair to them: so that, if they had not been crush'd in that instant, they would, in very few days, have appear'd very formidable. <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> return'd to <HI>London,</HI> and brought his Prisoners to the Privy Council; who committed <HI>Lambert</HI> again to the Tower with a stricter Charge, with some other of the Officers; and sent the rest to other Prisons. This very seasonable Victory look'd to all Men, as a happy Omen to the succeeding Parliament; which was <MILESTONE N="50"/> to assemble soon after the Prisoners were brought before the Council; and would not have appear'd with the same chearfulness, if <HI>Lambert</HI> had remain'd still in Armes, or, in truth, if he had been still at liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="569" REF="5790"/>
IN this short Interval between the return of the secluded Members, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment's and Council of State's pru∣dent Actions</NOTE> and the Convention of the new Parliament, many prudent Actions and Alterations (besides what have been already mention'd) were begun by that Parliament, before it was dissolv'd, and finish'd afterwards by the Council of State; which were good Presages, that the future Councils would proceed with Moderation. They released S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth</HI> from <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Before the Assembling of the new Par∣liament they release S</HI> G Booth.</NOTE> his imprisonment, that he might be elected to sit in the ensuing Parlia∣ment, as he shortly after was; and they set at liberty all those who had been committed for adhering to him. Those of the King's Party who had shelter'd themselves in obscurity, appear'd now abroad, and con∣versed without controle; and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> who was known to be en∣tirely <MILESTONE N="10"/> trusted by the King, walked into all places with freedom; and many of the Council, and some Officers of the Army, as <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> and <HI>Huntington, &amp;c.</HI> made, through Him, tender of their Services to the King.</P>
<P>BUT that which seem'd of most importance, was the reformation <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They reform the Navy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI> Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>and</HI> Mounta∣gue <HI>Admirals</HI></NOTE> they made in the Navy; which was full of Sectaries, and under the Go∣vernment of those who of all Men were declared the most Republican. The present Fleet prepared for the Summer Service, was under the Command of Vice-Admiral <HI>Lawson;</HI> an excellent Seaman, but then a <MILESTONE N="20"/> notorious Anabaptist; who had fill'd the Fleet with Officers, and Ma∣riners, of the same principles. And they well remember'd, how he had lately besieged the City; and, by the power of his Fleet, given that turn which helped to ruin <HI>the Committee of Safety,</HI> and restore the Rump-Parliament to the exercise of their jurisdiction; for which he stood high in reputation with all that Party. The Parliament resolv'd, though they thought it not fit or safe to remove <HI>Lawson,</HI> yet so far to eclipse him, that he should not have it so absolutely in his power to controle Them, as he had done <HI>the Committee of Safety.</HI> In order to this they concluded, that they would call <HI>Mountague,</HI> who had lain <MILESTONE N="30"/> privately in his own House, under a Cloud, and Jealousy of being in∣clined too much to the King, and make Him and the General (who was not to be left out in any thing) joynt Admirals of the Fleet; whereby <HI>Mountague</HI> only would go to Sea, and have the Ships under his Com∣mand; by which he might take care for good Officers, and Seamen, for such other Ships as they meant to add to the Fleet, and would be able to observe, if not reform the rest. <HI>Mountague</HI> sent privately over to the King for his Approbation, before he would accept the Charge; which being speedily sent to him, he came to <HI>London,</HI> and enter'd into that joynt Command with the General; and immediately applied him∣self <MILESTONE N="40"/> to put the Fleet into so good order, that he might comfortably serve in it. Since there was no Man who betook himself to his Majesty's Service with more generosity than this Gentleman, it is fit in this place to enlarge concerning him, and the correspondence which he held with the King.</P>
<P>MOUNTAGUE was of a Noble Family, of which some were too <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of Admiral</HI> Mountague</NOTE> much addicted to innovations in Religion, and in the beginning of the Troubles, appear'd against the King; though his Father, who had been long a Servant to the Crown, never could be prevailed upon to swerve from his Allegiance, and took all the care he could to restrain this his <MILESTONE N="50"/> only Son within those limits: but being young, and more out of his Father's controle by being Married into a Family, which, at that time, also trod awry, he was so far wrought upon by the caresses of <HI>Cromwell,</HI>
<PB N="570" REF="5800"/>
that, out of pure affection to him, he was perswaded to take Com∣mand in the Army, when it was new modelled under <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and when he was little more than twenty years of Age. He serv'd in that Army in the condition of a Colonel to the end of the War, with the reputa∣tion of a very stout and sober young Man. And from that time <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> to whom he passionately adher'd, took him into his nearest con∣fidence, and sent him, first, joyn'd in Commission with <HI>Blake;</HI> and then, in the sole Command by Sea; in which he was discreet and successful. And though Men look'd upon him as devoted to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Interest, in all other respects he behaved himself with civility to all Men, and without the least shew of acrimony towards any who had serv'd the <MILESTONE N="10"/> King; and was so much in love with Monarchy, that he was one of those who most desired and advised <HI>Cromwell</HI> to accept, and assume that Title, when it was offer'd to him by his Parliament. He was de∣sign'd by him to Command the Fleet that was to mediate, as was pre∣tended, in the <HI>Sound</HI> between the two Kings of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark;</HI> but was, in truth, to hinder the <HI>Dutch</HI> from assisting the <HI>Dane</HI> against the <HI>Swede;</HI> with whom <HI>Oliver</HI> was engaged in an inseparable Alliance. He was upon this Expedition, when <HI>Richard</HI> was scornfully thrown out of the Protector-ship; and was afterwards joyn'd (for they knew not <MILESTONE N="20"/> how to leave him out, whilst he had that Command) with <HI>Alger∣noon Sidney,</HI> and the other Plenipotentiaries which the Rump-Parlia∣ment sent to reconcile those Crowns. Assoon as <HI>Richard</HI> was so cast down, the King thought <HI>Mountague</HI>'s relations and obligations were at an end, and was advised by those who knew him, to invite him to his Service.</P>
<P>THERE accompanied him at that time <HI>Edward Mountague,</HI> the eldest Son of the Lord <HI>Mountague</HI> of <HI>Boughton,</HI> and his near Kinsman; with whom he had a particular friendship. This Gentleman was not unknown to the King, and very well known to the Chancellor, to have good Affections and Resolutions; and one who, by the correspondence <MILESTONE N="30"/> that was between them, he knew, had undertaken that unpleasant Voyage, only to dispose his Cousin to lay hold of the first opportunity to serve his Majesty. At this time S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth</HI> appear'd, and all those designs were laid, which, it was reasonably hoped, would engage the whole Kingdom against that odious part of the Parliament which was then possessed of the Government. And it was now thought a very seasonable Conjuncture to make an experiment, whether <HI>Mountague</HI> with his Fleet would declare for the King.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor thereupon prepared such a Letter in his own Name, <MILESTONE N="40"/> as his Majesty thought proper, to invite him to that resolution, from the distraction of the times, and the determination of all those Mo∣tives which had in his youth first provoked him to the engagements he had been in. <Q>He inform'd him of “S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth</HI>'s being possessed of <HI>Chester,</HI> and in the head of an Army; and that his Majesty was assured of many other Places; and of a general combination between Persons of the greatest Interest, to declare for the King; and that, if he would bring his Fleet upon the Coast, his Majesty, or the Duke” of <HI>York,</HI> would immediately be on board with him.</Q> This Letter was inclosed in another to <HI>Edward Mountague,</HI> to be by him deliver'd, <MILESTONE N="50"/> or Not deliver'd, as he thought fit; and committed to the care of an Express, who was then thought not to be without some credit with the Admiral himself; which did not prove true. However, the Mes∣senger
<PB N="571" REF="5810"/>
was diligent in prosecuting his voyage, and arriv'd safely at <HI>Co∣penhagen</HI> (where the Fleet lay; and where all the Plenipotentiaries from the Parliament then were) and without difficulty found oppor∣tunity to deliver his Letter to the Person to whom it was directed; who, the same Night, deliver'd the other to his Cousin. He receiv'd it chearfully, and was well pleased with the hopes of suddain Revolu∣tions in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THEY were both of them puzzled how to behave themselves towards the Messenger, who was not acceptable to them, being very well known to the Fleet, where though he had had good Command, he had no credit; and had appear'd so publickly, by the folly of good fellowship, <MILESTONE N="10"/> that the Admiral, and many others, had seen him and taken notice of him, before he knew that he brought any Letter for him. The conclu∣sion was, that he should without delay be sent away, without speaking with the Admiral, or knowing that he knew any thing of his Errand. But <HI>Edward Mountague</HI> writ such a Letter to the Chancellor, as was evidence enough that his Majesty would not be disappointed in his ex∣pectation of any service that the Admiral could perform for him. With this Answer the Messenger return'd to <HI>Brussels,</HI> where there was a great alteration from the time he had left it.</P>
<P>WITHIN few days after this Messenger's withdrawing from <HI>Copen∣hagen,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> of whose being there the Plenipotentiaries were so jealous, that they had resolv'd to require of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> that he might be committed to Prison, Admiral <HI>Mountague</HI> declared, <Q>“that he should not be able to stay longer there for the want of Victual; of which he had not more than would serve to carry him home; and therefore desired, that they would press both Kings, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Plenipotentiaries,” to finish the Negotiation.</Q> By this time the News of the Commotions in <HI>England</HI> made a great noise, and were reported, according to the Af∣fections of the Persons who sent Letters thither, more to the King's advantage than there was reason for; and the other Plenipotentiaries <MILESTONE N="30"/> came to know, that the Man, of whom they were so jealous, had pri∣vately spoken with <HI>Edward Mountague;</HI> who was very well known, and very ill thought of by them. And from thence they concluded, that the Admiral, who had never pleased them, was no stranger to that Negotiation; in which jealousy they were quickly confirm'd, when they saw him with his Fleet under sail, making his course for <HI>England,</HI> without giving them any notice, or taking his leave of them; which if he had done, they had secret Authority from their coming thither (upon the general apprehension of his Inclination) to have secured his Person on board his own Ship, and to have disposed of the Government of the <MILESTONE N="40"/> Fleet; of which being thus prevented they could do no more than send Expresses over Land, to acquaint the Parliament of his departure, with all the aggravation of his pride, presumption, and infidelity, which the bitterness of their nature and wit could suggest to them.</P>
<P>WHEN the Fleet arriv'd near the Coast of <HI>England,</HI> they found S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth</HI> defeated, and all Persons who pretended any affection for the King, so totally crushed, and the Rump Parliament in so full exercise of it's Tyrannical power, <Q>that the Admiral had nothing to do but to justify his return “by his scarcity of Victual, which must have” failed, if he had staid till the Winter had shut him up in the <HI>Sound;</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="50"/> and his return was resolv'd upon the joynt Advice of the Flag Officers of the Fleet; there being not a Man but his Cousin, who knew any
<PB N="572" REF="5820"/>
other reason of his return, or was privy to his purposes. So that, assoon as he had presented himself to the Parliament, and laid down his Com∣mand, they deferr'd the examination of the whole matter, upon the complaints which they had receiv'd from their Commissioners, till they could be at more leisure. For it was then about the time that they grew jealous of <HI>Lambert;</HI> so that <HI>Mountague</HI> went quietly into the Country, and remain'd neglected and forgotten, till those Revolutions were over which were produced by <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Invasion upon the Par∣liament, and General <HI>Monk</HI>'s march into <HI>England,</HI> and till near the time that the Name and Title of that Parliament was totally abolished, and extinguished; and then the secluded Members being restored call'd him <MILESTONE N="10"/> to resume the Command of the Fleet; which he accepted in the man∣ner aforesaid.</P>
<P>THIS, together with the other good Symptoms in the State, raised his Majesty's hopes and expectation higher than ever, if it had not been an unpleasant allay, that in so great an alteration, and application of many who had been eminently averse from his Majesty, of the General, who only could put an end to all his doubts, there was <HI>altum silentium;</HI> no Persons trusted by his Majesty could approach him, nor was any word known to fall from him that could encourage them to go to him, <MILESTONE N="20"/> though they still presumed that he meant well.</P>
<P>THE General was weary and perplexed with his unweildy Burthen, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The General's Counsels at this time.</NOTE> yet knew not how to make it lighter by communication. He spent much time in consultation with Persons of every Interest, the King's Party only excepted; with whom he held no conference; though he found, in his every day's discourses in the City, with those who were thought to be Presbyterians, and with other Persons of quality and con∣sideration, that the People did generally wish for the King, and that they did believe, there could be no firm and settled Peace in the Na∣tion, that did not comprehend His Interest, and compose the prejudice that was against His Party. But then there must be strict conditions to <MILESTONE N="30"/> which he must be bound, which it should not be in his Majesty's power to break; and which might not only secure all who had borne Armes against him, but such who had purchased the Lands of the Crown, or of Bishops, or of Delinquents; and nobody spoke more favourably, than for the confirming all that had been offer'd by his Father in the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI></P>
<P>WHETHER by invitation, or upon his own desire, he was present <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He had a con∣ference with divers at</HI> Northumber∣land <HI>House.</HI></NOTE> at <HI>Northumberland</HI> House in a Conference with that Earl, the Earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> and other Lords, and likewise with <HI>Hollis,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Waller, Lewis,</HI> and other eminent Persons, who had a trust and con∣fidence in each other, and who were looked upon as the Heads and Governours of the moderate Presbyterian Party; who, most of them, would have been contented, their own security being provided for, that the King should be restored to his full Rights, and the Church to it's possessions. In this Conference, the King's Restoration was proposed in direct terms, as absolutely necessary to the Peace of the Kingdom, and for the satisfaction of the People; and the question seem'd only to be, upon what terms they should admit him: some proposing more moderate, others more severe conditions. In this whole Debate, the <MILESTONE N="50"/> General insisted upon the most rigid Propositions; which he pressed in such a manner, that the Lords grew jealous that he had such an aver∣sion from Restoring the King, that it would not be safe for them then
<PB N="573" REF="5830"/>
to prosecute that advice; and therefore it were best to acquiese till the Parliament met, and that they could make some judgement of the tem∣per of it. And the General, though he consulted with those of every Faction with much freedom, yet was by many then thought to have most familiarity, and to converse most freely with S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur Haslerig,</HI> who was irreconcilable to Monarchy, and looked upon as the Chief of that Republican Party, which desired not to preserve any face of Go∣vernment in the Church, or Uniformity in the publick exercise of Re∣ligion. This made the Lords, and all others, who were of different af∣fections, very wary in their discourses with the General, and jealous of his Inclinations. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>THERE was, at this time, in much conversation, and trust with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He consults with M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Mor¦rice.</NOTE> the General, a Gentleman of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> of a fair estate and reputation, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Morrice,</HI> a Person of a retired Life, which he spent in Study, being learned and of good parts; and he had been allways looked upon as a Man far from any malice towards the King, if he had not good Affections for him; which they who knew him best, believ'd him to have in a good measure. This Gentleman was allied to the Ge∣neral, and entirely trusted by him in the management of his estate in that Country, where, by the death of his elder Brother without Heirs Male, he inherited a fair fortune. And <HI>Morrice,</HI> being chosen to serve <MILESTONE N="20"/> in the next ensuing Parliament, had made hast to <HI>London,</HI> the better to observe how things were like to go. With Him the General con∣sulted freely touching all his perplexities and observations; <Q>how “he found most Men of Quality and Interest inclined to call in the King, but upon such conditions as must be very ungrateful, if possible to be re∣ceiv'd;”</Q> and the <HI>London</HI> Ministers talked already so loudly of them, that the Covenant being new printed, and, by order fixed up in all Churches, they, in their Sermons, discoursed of the several obligations in it, that, without exposing themselves to the danger of naming the King, which yet they did not long forbe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, every body understood, they thought it <MILESTONE N="30"/> necessary the People should return to their Allegiance.</P>
<P>THAT which wrought most upon the General, was the choice which was begun to be made in all Counties for Members to serve in Parlia∣ment; very many of them being known to be of singular Affection to the King, and very few who did not heartily abhor the Murther of his Father, and detest the Government that succeeded: so that it was rea∣sonably apprehended, that, when they should once meet, there would be warmth among them, that could not be restrain'd or controled; and they might take the business so much into their own hands, as to leave no part to Him to merit of the King; from whom he had yet deserv'd <MILESTONE N="40"/> nothing.</P>
<P><Q>M<SUP>r</SUP> MORRICE was not wanting to cultivate those conceptions with his information of the Affections of the West, “”where the King's Re∣storation was, he said,</Q> <Q>“so impatiently longed for, that they had made choice of few or no Members to serve for <HI>Cornwal,</HI> or <HI>Devonshire,</HI> but such, who, they were confident, would contribute all they could to invite the King to return. And when that Subject was once upon the Stage, They who concurr'd with most frankness, would find most credit; and They who opposed it, would be overborne with lasting” reproach.</Q> When the General had reflected upon the whole matter, <MILESTONE N="50"/> he resolved to advance that design; and so consulted with his friend, how he might manage it in that manner, before the Parliament should
<PB N="574" REF="5840"/>
assemble, that what followed might be imputed to His counsels, and contrivance.</P>
<P>THERE was then in the Town a Gentleman well known to be a Servant of eminent trust to the King, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil,</HI> who, from the time of the surrender of <HI>Silly,</HI> had enjoy'd his estate, and sometimes his liberty, though, under the jealousy of a disaffected Person, often restrain'd. He had been privy to the sending to the General into <HI>Scot∣land</HI> the Clergy-man, his Brother; and was conversant with those who were most trusted by his Majesty, and at this time were taken notice of to have all intimacy with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt;</HI> who most imme∣diately <MILESTONE N="10"/> corresponded with <HI>Brussels.</HI> This Gentleman was of a family to which the General was allied; and he had been obliged to his Fa∣ther, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bevil Greenvil;</HI> who lost his life at the Battle of <HI>Lansdown</HI> for the King, and by his Will had recommended his much impair'd for∣tune, and his Wife and Children, to the care and counsel of his Neigh∣bour and Friend, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Morrice;</HI> who had executed the Trust with the utmost fidelity and friendship.</P>
<P>THE General was content, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> should be trusted in this great Affair, and that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Morrice</HI> should bring him secretly to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sr</HI> John Greenvil <HI>in∣troduced to the General by Mr</HI> Morrice.</NOTE> him in a private Lodging he had in S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s. When he came to him <MILESTONE N="20"/> after he had solemnly conjured him to secrecy, upon the peril of his Life; <Q>he told him, “he meant to send him to the King; with whom, he presumed, he had credit enough to be believed without any testi∣mony; for he was resolved not to write to the King, nor to give him any thing in writing; but wished him to confer with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Morrice,</HI> and to take short Memorials in his own hand of those particulars he should offer to him in discourse; which when he had done, he” would himself confer with him again at an hour he should appoint.</Q> And so he retired hastily out of the Room, as if he were jealous that other Men would wonder at his absence. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P><Q>THAT which M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Morrice</HI> communicated to <HI>Greenvil,</HI> was, after he had enlarged upon “the perplexity the General was in, by the seve∣ral humours and factions which prevailed, and that he durst not trust any Officer of his own Army, or any Friend but himself, with his” own secret purposes;</Q> <Q>he advised, “that the King should write a Let∣ter to the General; in which, after kind and gracious Expressions, he should desire him to deliver the inclosed Letter, and Declaration” to the Parliament;</Q> the particular heads, and materials for which Let∣ter, and Declaration, <HI>Morrice</HI> discoursed to him; the end of which was to satisfy all Interests, and to comply with every Man's humour, and indeed to suffer every Man to enjoy what he would. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>AFTER S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> had enough discoursed all particulars with him, and taken such short Memorials for his Memory as he thought necessary, within a day or two he was brought with the same wari∣ness, and in another place, to the General; to whom he read the short <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Trans∣actions be∣tween the Ge∣neral,</HI> Mor∣rice, <HI>and</HI> Greenvil.</NOTE> Notes he had taken; to which little was added: <Q>and the General said, “that if the King writ to that purpose, when he brought the Letter to him, he would keep it in his hands, till he found a fit time to deli∣ver” it, or should think of another way to serve his Majesty.</Q> Only he added another particular, as an advice absolutely necessary for the King to consent to, which was, his Majesty's present remove out of <MILESTONE N="50"/> <HI>Flanders.</HI> He undertook to know, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had no purpose to do any thing for him, and that all his friends were jealous, that

it would not be in his power to remove from thence, if he deferr'd it till they discover'd that he was like to have no need of them. <Q>And therefore he desired, “that his Majesty would make hast to <HI>Breda,</HI> and that, for the publick satisfaction, and that it might be evident he had left <HI>Flanders,</HI> whatsoever he should send in writing should” bear date as from <HI>Breda;</HI></Q> <Q>and he enjoyn'd S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> “not to return, till he had himself seen the King out of the Dominions of” <HI>Flanders.</HI></Q> Thus instructed he left him, who taking M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thus instruct∣ed, S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John Greenvil <HI>goes over to</HI> Brus¦sels <HI>with M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Mordaunt</NOTE> with him for the Companion of his journey, set out for <HI>Flanders</HI> about the beginning of <HI>April</HI> 1660, and in few days arrived safely at <HI>Brussels.</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>IT was no unpleasant prospect to the King, nor of small advantage to him, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> look'd upon all these Revolutions in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> as the effects of the several animosities, and emulations of the different Factions among themselves; a Contention only between the Presbyterian-Republicans on one side, and the Independent and Le∣velling Party on the other, for superiority, and who should steer the Government of the State, without the least reference to the King's In∣terest: which, they thought, would in no degree be advanced which side soever prevailed. And therefore <HI>Don Alonzo,</HI> by his <HI>Irish</HI> Agents (who made him believe any thing) continued firm to the Levellers; <MILESTONE N="20"/> who, if they got the better of their Enemies, he was assured, would make a good Peace with <HI>Spain;</HI> which above all things they desired: and if they were oppressed, he made as little doubt they would unite themselves to the King, upon such conditions as he should arbitrate between them. And in this confidence he embraced all the ways he could to correspond with them, receiving such Agents with all possible secrecy who repaired to him to <HI>Brussels;</HI> and when Instruments of most credit and importance, would not adventure thither, he was con∣tented to send some Person, who was entrusted by him, into <HI>Zeeland</HI> to confer and treat with them. And in this kind of Negotiation, which <MILESTONE N="30"/> was very expensive, they cared not what Money they disbursed, whilst they neglected the King, and suffer'd him to be without that small sup∣ply which they had assign'd to him.</P>
<P>IN this temper were the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ministers, when M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> came to <HI>Brussels.</HI> And <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> had so fully pos∣sessed the Court at <HI>Madrid</HI> with the same Spirit, that when the Chan∣cellor, in his Letters to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI> his Majesty's Resident there, intimated the hopes they had of a Revolution in <HI>England</HI> to the ad∣vantage of the King, he answer'd plainly, <Q>“that he durst not commu∣nicate any of those Letters to the Ministers there; who would laugh <MILESTONE N="40"/> at him for abusing them, since they look'd upon all those hopes of the King as imaginary, and without foundation of Sense, and upon his” condition as most deplorable and absolutely desperate.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> had at large inform'd his Majesty of the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> of the manner of the General's conference with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John Greenvil <HI>gives the King an Ac∣count of his Negotiation with the Ge¦neral.</HI></NOTE> him, and the good affection of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Morrice,</HI> and had communicated the Instructions and Advices he had receiv'd, as his Majesty was very glad that the General had thus far discover'd himself, and that he had open'd a door for correspondence, so he was not without great per∣plexity upon many particulars which were recommended to be done; <MILESTONE N="50"/> some of which he believ'd impossible and unpracticable, as the leaving <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Deliberations upon the terms proposed by the General</NOTE> every body in the state they were in, and confirming their possession in all the Lands which they held in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> by
<PB N="576" REF="5860"/>
purchase or donation, whether of Lands belonging to the Crown and Church, or such who for adhering to his Father and himself, were de∣clared Delinquents, and had their Lands confiscated and disposed of as their Enemies had thought fit. Then, the complying with all hu∣mours in Religion, and the granting a general liberty of Conscience, was a violation of all the Laws in force, and could not be apprehended to consist with the Peace of the Kingdom. No Man was more dis∣posed to a general Act of Indemnity and Oblivion than his Majesty was; which he knew, in so long and universal a guilt, was absolutely necessary. But he thought it neither consistent with his Honour, nor his Conscience, that those who had sate as Judges, and condemn'd his <MILESTONE N="10"/> Father to be murther'd, should be comprehended in that Act of Par∣don: <Q>yet it was advised, “that there might be no Exception; or that” above Four might not be excepted;</Q> <Q>because, it was alledg'd, “that some of them had facilitated the General's march by falling from <HI>Lam∣bert,</HI> and others had barefaced advanced the King's Service very” much.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER great deliberation upon all the particulars, and weighing the importance of complying with the General's advice in all things which his Conscience and Honour would permit, his Majesty directed such Letters and Declarations to be prepared, as should be, in a good <MILESTONE N="20"/> degree, suitable to the Wishes and Counsel of the General, and yet make the transaction of those things which he did not like, the effect of the power of the Parliament, rather than of his Majesty's approbation. And the confidence he had upon the general Election of honest and prudent Men, and in some particular Persons, who, he heard, were already chosen, disposed him to make a general reference of all things which he could not reserve to himself, to the wisdom of the Parliament, upon presumption that they would not exact more from him than he was willing to consent to; since he well knew, that whatever title They assumed, or He gave them, they must have another kind of Parliament <MILESTONE N="30"/> to confirm all that was done by them; without which They could not be safe, and contented, nor his Majesty obliged.</P>
<P>THE Advice for his Majesty's remove out of <HI>Flanders</HI> presently, was not ungrateful; for he had reasons abundant to be weary of it: yet he was without any great inclination to <HI>Holland;</HI> where he had been as unkindly used as it was possible for any Gentleman to be. But besides the Authority which the General's advice deserv'd to have, the truth is, his Majesty could remove no whither else. <HI>France</HI> was equally ex∣cepted against, and equally disagreeable to the King; and the way thi∣ther must be through all the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions: <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was a place <MILESTONE N="40"/> in many respects desirable, because it was in the possession of the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> from whence he might embark for <HI>England</HI> upon the shortest warn∣ing. And upon the first alterations in <HI>England,</HI> after the Peace be∣tween the two Crowns, the King had sent to <HI>Lockhart,</HI> the Governour, and General of the <HI>English</HI> there, by a Person of Honour, well known and respected by him, to invite him to his Service by the prospect he had of the Revolutions like to ensue (which probably could not but be advantageous to the King) and by the uncertainty of <HI>Lockhart</HI>'s own condition upon any such Alterations. The Arguments were urged to him with clearness and sorce enough, and all necessary offers made to <MILESTONE N="50"/> perswade him to declare for the King, and to receive his Majesty into that Garrison; which might be facilitated by his Majesty's Troops, if
<PB N="577" REF="5870"/>
he did not think his own Soldiers enough at his devotion: <Q>yet he could not be prevailed with, urging “the Trust he had receiv'd, and the in∣decency” of breaking it;</Q> <Q>though, he confessed, “there was such a jea∣lousy of him in the Council of State, for his relation and alliance to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that he expected every day to be removed from that Com∣mand;” as shortly after he was.</Q> Whether this refusal proceeded from the punctuality of his Nature (for he was a Man of parts, and of ho∣nour) or from his Jealousy of the Garrison, that they would not be dis∣posed by him (for though he was exceedingly belov'd, and obeyed by them, yet they were all <HI>English-</HI>men, and he had none of his own Na∣tion, <MILESTONE N="10"/> which was the <HI>Scotish,</HI> but in his own Family) certain it is, that, at the same time he refused to treat with the King, he refused to accept the great offers made to him by the Cardinal; who had a high esteem of him, and offer'd to make him Marshal of <HI>France,</HI> with great ap∣pointments of Pensions and other Emoluments, if he would deliver <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and <HI>Mardike</HI> into the hands of <HI>France;</HI> all which Overtures he rejected: so that his Majesty had no place to resort to preferable to <HI>Breda.</HI></P>
<P>THE King was resolv'd rather to make no mention of the Murtherers of his Father, than to pardon any of them, and except four, as was <MILESTONE N="20"/> proposed; but chose rather to refer the whole consideration of that Af∣fair, without any restriction, to the Conscience of the Parliament; yet with such expressions, and descriptions, that they could not but discern that he trusted them in confidence that they would do Themselves and the Nation right, in declaring their detestation of, and preparing ven∣geance for, that Parricide. And from the time that the secluded Mem∣bers sate again with the Rump, there was good evidence given that they would not leave that odious Murther unexamined and unpunished; which the more disposed the King to depend upon their Virtue and Justice. <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>WHEN the Summons were sent out to call the Parliament, there was no mention or thought of a House of Peers; nor had the General inti∣mated any such thing to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil;</HI> nor did S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John</HI> himself, or M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> conceive that any of the Lords had a purpose to meet at first, but that all must depend upon the Commons. However, the King thought not fit to pass Them by, but to have a Letter prepared as well for Them as for the House of Commons; and likewise another to the Fleet; and another to the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of <HI>London;</HI> who, by adhering to the General, were like to add very much to his Authority. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>WHEN all those things were prepared, and perused, and approved <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Letters prepared to the Parlia∣ment,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>which the Ge∣neral advised.</HI></NOTE> by the King, which he resolv'd to send by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> to the Ge∣neral <HI>(Greenvil</HI>'s and <HI>Mordaunt</HI>'s being in <HI>Brussels</HI> being unknown; They, attending his Majesty only in the night at the Chancellor's Lodg∣ing, concealing themselves from being taken notice of by any) his Ma∣jesty visited the Marquis of <HI>Carracena,</HI> and told him, <Q>“that he intended <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King de∣clares to the Marquis of</HI> Carracena <HI>that He in∣tended to go for some days to</HI> Bre∣da, <HI>to meet his Sister.</HI></NOTE> the next day to go to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Breda,</HI> to spend” two or three days with his Sister the Princess of <HI>Orange;</HI></Q> to whom the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Glocester</HI> were already gone, to acquaint her with the King's purpose; <Q>and his Majesty likewise, in confidence, inform'd him, <MILESTONE N="50"/> “that there were some Persons come from <HI>England,</HI> who would not” venture to come to <HI>Brussels,</HI> from whom he expected some Proposi∣tions
<PB N="578" REF="5880"/>
and Informations, which might prove beneficial to him; which” obliged him to make that journey to confer with them.</Q></P>
<P>THE Marquis seem'd to think That of little Moment; <Q>and said, “that <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> expected every day to receive assurance, that the Level∣lers would unite themselves to the King's Interest, upon more mo∣derate” Conditions than they had hitherto made;</Q> <Q>but desired his Ma∣jesty, “that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> might hasten his journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> to” receive the Command that was there reserv'd for him;</Q> <Q>and the King desired him, “that the Forces he had promised for his Service, might be ready against his return to be embarked upon the first appearance of” a hopeful occasion.</Q> So they parted; and his Majesty went the next <MILESTONE N="10"/> day to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> with that small retinue he used to travel with.</P>
<P>HIS departure was some hours earlier than the Marquis imagin'd; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Spaniards <HI>design to seise his Majesty, discover'd.</HI></NOTE> and the reason of it was this: In that night, one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Galloway,</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> young Man, Page at that time to <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</HI> came to the Lord Chancellor's lodgings, and finding his Secretary in his own room, told him, <Q>“he must needs speak presently with his Lord;” for he had something to impart to him that concern'd the King's life.</Q> The Chancellor, though at that time in bed, order'd him to be ad∣mitted; <Q>and the poor Man trembling told him, “that his Lord <HI>Don</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"/> <HI>Alonzo</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> had been long together that evening; and, that himself had overheard them saying something of sending a Guard to attend the King: that, about an hour after, they parted; and the Marquis sent a paper to <HI>Don Alonzo;</HI> who, when he went to bed, laid it on his table: that himself, who lay in his Master's Ante-Chamber, look'd into the paper, when his Master was” in bed;</Q> and, seeing what it was, had brought it to the Chancellor: It imported an Order to an Officer to attend the King with a Party of Horse, for a Guard wherever he went (a respect that never had been paid him before) but not to suffer him, on any terms, to go out of the Town. Assoon as the Chancellor had read the Order, he sent his Se∣cretary <MILESTONE N="30"/> with it to the King; who was in bed likewise; and his Majesty having read it, the Secretary return'd it to <HI>Galloway;</HI> who went home, and laid it in its place upon his Master's table. The King commanded the Chancellor's Secretary to call up his Majesty's Querry, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Armorer;</HI> <Q>and to Him his Majesty gave his Orders, charging him with secrecy, “”that he would be gone at three of the clock that morning:</Q> and accordingly he went, attended by the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Wil∣liam Armorer,</HI> and two or three Servants more. Between eight and nine that morning, an Officer did come and inquire for the King; but <MILESTONE N="40"/> it happen'd, by this seasonable discovery, that his Majesty had made his escape some hours before, to the no small Mortification, no doubt, of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governour.</P>
<P>ASSOON as his Majesty came into the States Dominions, which was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes towards</HI> Bre∣da, <HI>and deli∣vers to S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John Greenvil <HI>the Letters pre∣pared.</HI></NOTE> about the midway between <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Breda,</HI> he deliver'd to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> (who attended there <HI>incognito,</HI> that he might warrantably aver to the General, <Q>“”that he had seen his Majesty out of <HI>Flanders)</HI> all those dispatches,</Q> which were prepared, and dated, as from <HI>Breda,</HI> upon the same day in which he receiv'd them, and where his Majesty was to be that night. The Copies of all were likewise deliver'd to him, that the Ge∣neral, <MILESTONE N="50"/> upon perusal thereof, might, without opening the Originals, choose whether he would deliver them, if any thing was contain'd therein
<PB N="579" REF="5890"/>
which he disliked; and his Majesty referr'd it to him to proceed any other way, if, upon any alterations which should happen, he thought fit to vary from his former Advice.</P>
<P><Q>SIR <HI>John Greenvil,</HI> before his Departure, told the King, “that though he had no order to propose it directly to his Majesty; yet he could assure him, it would be the most grateful and obliging thing his Ma∣jesty could do towards the General, if he would give him leave to assure him, that, assoon as he came into <HI>England,</HI> he would bestow the Office of one of the Secretaries of State upon M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Morrice;</HI> who was as well qualified for it, as any Man who had not been versed in the know∣ledge” <MILESTONE N="10"/> of Foreign Affairs.</Q> One of those places was then void by the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI>'s becoming Roman Catholick, and thereupon resigning the Signet; and his Majesty was very glad to lay that obligation upon the General, and to gratify a Person who had so much credit with him, and had already given such manifestation of his good Affection to his Majesty, and directed him to give that Assurance to the General. With these dispatches S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> who privately <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John Greenvil <HI>and M<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Mordaunt <HI>return to∣wards</HI> Eng∣land.</NOTE> expected his return at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> made what hast they could towards <HI>England;</HI> and the King went that night to <HI>Breda.</HI> The Letters which the King writ to the General, and to the House of Commons, and the <MILESTONE N="20"/> other Letters, with the Declaration, are here inserted in the terms they were sent.</P>

<P><Q>“TRUSTY, and Well-beloved, We greet you well: It cannot be be∣liev'd, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Letter of the King to the General and the Army.</NOTE> but that We have been, are, and ever must be, as sollicitous as We can, by all endeavours to improve the Affections of Our good <MILESTONE N="30"/> Subjects at home, and to procure the Assistance of Our Friends and Allies abroad, for the recovery of that Right, which, by the Laws of God and Man, is unquestionable; and of which We have been so long dispossessed by such force, and with those circumstances, as We do not desire to aggravate by any sharp Expressions; but rather wish, that the memory of what is past, may be buried to the world. That We have more endeavour'd to prepare, and to improve the Affections of Our Subjects at home for Our Restoration, than to procure Assistance from abroad to invade either of Our Kingdoms, is as manifest to the world. And We cannot give a better evidence that We are still of the <MILESTONE N="40"/> same mind, than in This conjuncture; when common reason must sa∣tisfy all Men, that We cannot be without assistance from abroad, We choose rather to send to you, who have it in your power to prevent that ruin and desolation which a War would bring upon the Nation, and to make the whole Kingdom owe the Peace, Happiness, Secu∣rity, and Glory it shall enjoy, to your virtue; and to acknowledge that your Armies have complied with their obligations, for which they were first raised, for the preservation of the Protestant Religion, the Honour and Dignity of the King, the Privileges of Parliament, <MILESTONE N="50"/> the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and the fundamental Laws of the Land; and that You have vindicated that Trust, which others
<PB N="580" REF="5900"/>
most perfidiously abused and betrayed. How much We desire, and resolve to contribute to those good ends, will appear to you by Our inclosed Declaration; which We desire you to cause to be published for the Information and Satisfaction of all good Subjects, who do not desire a farther effusion of precious Christian Blood, but to have their Peace and Security founded upon that which can only support it, an Unity of Affections amongst Our selves, an equal Administration of Justice to Men, restoring Parliaments to a full capacity of providing for all that is amiss, and the Laws of the Land to their due Vene∣ration.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“YOU have been your selves Witnesses of so many Revolutions, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> have had so much experience, how far any power and authority that is only assumed by passion and appetite, and not supported by Justice, is from providing for the Happiness and Peace of the People, or from receiving any obedience from them (without which no Government can provide for them) that you may very reasonably believe, that God hath not been so well pleased with the Attempts that have been made, since he hath usually encreased the confusion, by giving all the success that hath been desired, and brought that to pass without effect, which the Designers have proposed as the best means to settle and compose the Nation: and therefore We cannot but hope and believe, <MILESTONE N="20"/> that you will concur with Us in the Remedy We have applied; which, to human understanding, is only proper for the ills We all groan un∣der; and that you will make your selves the blessed Instruments to bring this blessing of Peace and Reconciliation upon King and People; it being the usual method in which Divine Providence delighteth it self, to use and sanctify those very means, which ill Men design for the satisfaction of private and particular ends and ambition, and other wicked purposes, to wholesome and publick ends, and to establish that good which is most contrary to the Designers; which is the greatest manifestation of God's peculiar kindness to a Nation that can <MILESTONE N="30"/> be given in this world. How far We resolve to preserve your Interests, and reward your Services, We refer to Our Declaration; and We hope God will inspire you to perform your Duty to Us, and to your Na∣tive” Country; whose happiness cannot be separated from each other.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SIGNED>Charles R.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P><Q>“TRUSTY and Well-beloved, We greet you well: In these great and insupportable afflictions and calamities, under which the poor Nation <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Letter to the House of Commons.</NOTE> hath been so long exercised, and by which it is so near exhausted, We cannot think of a more natural and proper Remedy, than to re∣sort to those for counsel and advice, who have seen and observ'd the first beginning of Our Miseries, the progress from bad to worse, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> the mistakes and misunderstandings, which have been produced, and
<PB N="581" REF="5910"/>
contributed to inconveniences which were not intended; and after so many Revolutions, and the observation of what hath attended them, are now trusted by our good Subjects to repair the Breaches which are made, and to provide proper Remedies for those Evils, and for the” lasting Peace, Happiness, and Security of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“WE do assure You upon Our Royal word, that none of Our Pre∣decessors have had a greater esteem of Parliaments, than We have in our judgement, as well as from Our obligation; We do be∣lieve them to be so vital a part of the Constitution of the Kingdom, and so necessary for the Government of it, that We well know nei∣ther <MILESTONE N="10"/> Prince nor People can be in any tolerable degree happy without them; and therefore you may be confident, that We shall allways look upon Their Counsels, as the best We can receive; and shall be as tender of their Privileges, and as careful to preserve and protect them, as of that which is most near to Our Self, and most necessary for Our” own preservation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“AND as this is Our opinion of Parliaments, that their Authority is most necessary for the Government of the Kingdom; so We are most confident, that you believe, and find, that the preservation of the King's Authority is as necessary for the preservation of Parliaments; <MILESTONE N="20"/> and that it is not the Name, but the right Constitution of them, which can prepare and apply proper Remedies for those Evils which are grievous to the People, and which can thereby establish their Peace and Security. And therefore We have not the least doubt, but that you will be as tender in, and as jealous of, any thing that may infringe Our Honour, or impair Our Authority, as of your own Liberty and Property; which is best preserv'd by preserving the” other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“HOW far We have trusted you in this great Affair, and how much it is in your power to restore the Nation to all that it hath lost, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> to redeem it from any infamy it hath undergone, and to make the King and People as happy as they ought to be; you will find by Our inclosed Declaration; a Copy of which We have likewise sent to the House of Peers: and you will easily believe, that We would not vo∣luntarily, and of Our self, have reposed so great a Trust in you, but upon an entire confidence that you will not abuse it, and that you will proceed in such a manner, and with such due consideration of Us who have trusted you, that We shall not be ashamed of declining other Assistance (which We have assurance of) and repairing to You for more natural and proper Remedies for the Evils We would be <MILESTONE N="40"/> freed from; nor sorry, that We have bound up Our own Interests so entirely with that of Our Subjects, as that We refer it to the same Persons to take care of Us, who are trusted to provide for Them. We look upon you as wise and dispassionate Men, and good Patriots, who will raise up those Banks and Fences which have been cast down, and who will most reasonably hope, that the same prosperity will again spring from those Roots, from which it hath heretofore and allways grown; nor can We apprehend that you will propose any thing to Us, or expect any thing from Us, but that We are as ready to give, as” You to receive.</Q> <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P><Q>“IF You desire the Advancement and Propagation of the Protestant Religion, We have, by our constant profession, and practice of it,
<PB N="582" REF="5920"/>
given sufficient testimony to the world, that neither the unkindness of those of the same Faith towards Us, nor the civilities and obligations from those of a contrary profession (of both which We have had an abundant Evidence) could in the least degree startle Us, or make Us swerve from it; and nothing can be proposed to manifest Our Zeal and Affection for it, to which We will not readily consent. And We hope, in due time, Our self to propose somewhat to you for the pro∣pagation of it, that will satisfy the world, that We have allways made it both Our Care and Our Study, and have enough observ'd what is” most like to bring disadvantage to it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“IF You desire security for those who, in these calamitous times, ei∣ther <MILESTONE N="10"/> wilfully or weakly have transgressed those bounds which were prescribed, and have invaded each others Rights, We have left to you to provide for their Security and Indemnity, and in such a way, as you shall think just and reasonable; and by a just computation of what Men have done, and suffer'd, as near as is possible, to take care that all Men be satisfied; which is the surest way to suppress, and ex∣tirpate all such uncharitableness and animosity, as might hereafter shake and threaten that Peace, which for the present might seem esta∣blished. If there be a crying Sin, for which the Nation may be in∣volved <MILESTONE N="20"/> in the infamy that attends it, We cannot doubt but that you will be as sollicitous to redeem it, and vindicate the Nation from that” guilt and infamy, as We can be.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“IF You desire that reverence and obedience may be paid to the fun∣damental Laws of the Land, and that Justice may be equally and im∣partially administer'd to all Men, it is that which We desire to be sworn to Our self, and that all Persons in power and authority should” be so too.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“IN a word, there is nothing that you can propose that may make the Kingdom happy, which We will not contend with you to com∣pass; and upon this confidence and Assurance, We have thought fit <MILESTONE N="30"/> to send you this Declaration, that you may, as much as is possible, at this distance, see our Heart; which, when God shall bring Us nearer together (as We hope he will do shortly) will appear to you very agreeable to what We have professed; and We hope, that We have made that right Christian use of Our Affliction, and that the ob∣servation and experience We have had in other Countries, have been such, as that We, and, We hope, all Our Subjects, shall be the better” for what We have seen and suffer'd.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“CHARLES, by the Grace of God, King of <HI>England, Scotland, France,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Declaration.</NOTE> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> Defender of the Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To all Our loving Subjects of what Degree or Quality soever, Greeting. If the general distraction,
<PB N="583" REF="5930"/>
and confusion, which is spread over the whole Kingdom, doth not awaken all Men to a desire, and longing, that those Wounds which have so many years together been kept bleeding, may be bound up, all We can say will be to no purpose. However, after this long silence, We have thought it Our Duty to declare, how much We desire to con∣tribute thereunto: and that, as We can never give over the hope, in good time, to obtain the possession of that Right, which God and Na∣ture hath made Our due; so We do make it Our daily Suit to the Divine Providence, that he will, in compassion to Us, and Our Subjects, after so long misery and sufferings, remit, and put Us into a quiet, and peaceable Possession of that Our Right, with as little blood and damage <MILESTONE N="10"/> to Our People as is possible; nor do We desire more to enjoy what is Ours, than that all Our Subjects may enjoy what by Law is Theirs, by a full and entire administration of Justice throughout the Land, and” by extending Our Mercy where it is wanted and deserv'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“AND to the end that fear of punishment may not engage any con∣scious to themselves of what is past, to a perseverance in guilt for the future, by opposing the quiet and happiness of their Country, in the Restoration both of King, and Peers, and People, to their just, an∣cient, and fundamental Rights; We do by these presents declare, that We do grant a free and general pardon, which We are ready, upon de∣mand, <MILESTONE N="20"/> to pass under Our Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> to all Our Subjects of what degree or quality soever, who within forty days after the publishing hereof, shall lay hold upon this Our Grace and Favour, and shall by any publick Act declare their doing so, and that they return to the loyalty and obedience of good Subjects; excepting only such Persons as shall hereafter be excepted by Parliament. Those only ex∣cepted, let all our Subjects, how faulty soever, rely upon the word of a King, solemnly given by this present Declaration, that no crime whatsoever committed against Us, or Our Royal Father, before the publication of this, shall ever rise in judgement, or be brought in que∣stion, <MILESTONE N="30"/> against any of them, to the least indamagement of them, either in their Lives, Liberties, or Estates, or (as far forth as lies in Our power) so much as to the prejudice of their Reputations, by any reproach, or terms of distinction from the rest of Our best Subjects; We desiring, and ordaining, that henceforward all Notes of discord, separation, and difference of Parties, be utterly abolish'd among all Our Subjects; whom We invite and conjure to a perfect Union among themselves, un∣der Our Protection, for the Resettlement of Our just Rights, and Their's, in a free Parliament; by which, upon the word of a King, We will” be advised.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P><Q>“AND because the passion and uncharitableness of the Times, have produced several opinions in Religion, by which Men are engaged in Parties and Animosities against each other; which, when they shall hereafter unite in a freedom of conversation, will be composed, or better understood; We do declare a Liberty to tender Consciences; and that no Man shall be disquieted, or called in question, for dif∣ferences of opinion in matters of Religion which do not disturb the Peace of the Kingdom; and that We shall be ready to consent to such an Act of Parliament, as, upon mature deliberation, shall be offer'd” <MILESTONE N="50"/> to Us, for the full granting that Indulgence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“AND because in the continued distractions of so many years, and
<PB N="584" REF="5940"/>
so many and great Revolutions, many Grants and Purchases of Estates have been made to and by many Officers, Soldiers, and Others, who are now possessed of the same, and who may be liable to Actions at Law, upon several Titles; We are likewise willing that all such dif∣ferences, and all things relating to such Grants, Sales, and Purchases, shall be determin'd in Parliament; which can best provide for the just” satisfaction of all Men who are concern'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“AND We do farther declare, that We will be ready to consent to any Act or Acts of Parliament to the purposes aforesaid, and for the full satisfaction of all Arrears due to the Officers and Soldiers of the Army under the Command of General <HI>Monk;</HI> and that they shall be <MILESTONE N="10"/> receiv'd into Our Service upon as good pay, and conditions, as they” now enjoy.</Q></P>

amazement of all the world, there is none that We have look'd upon with more comfort, than the so frequent and publick manifestations of their Affections to Us in the City of <HI>London;</HI> which hath exceedingly raised Our Spirits, and which, no doubt, hath proceeded from the Spi∣rit of God, and his extraordinary Mercy to the Nation; which hath been encouraged by You, and your good Example, to assert that Govern∣ment under which it hath, so many hundred years, enjoyed as great feli∣city as any Nation in <HI>Europe;</HI> and to discountenance the Imaginations of those who would subject Our Subjects to a Government they have not yet devised, and, to satisfy the pride and ambition of a few ill Men, would introduce the most arbitrary and tyrannical Power that was ever <MILESTONE N="10"/> yet heard of. How long We have all suffer'd under those and the like devices, all the world takes notice, to the no small reproach of the <HI>English</HI> Nation; which We hope is now providing for its own Security” and Redemption, and will be no longer bewitched by those Inventions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“HOW desirous We are to contribute to the obtaining the Peace and Happiness of Our Subjects without effusion of blood; and how far We are from desiring to recover what belongs to Us by a War, if it can be otherwise done, will appear to you by the inclosed Declaration; which, together with this Our Letter, We have intrusted Our Right Trusty <MILESTONE N="20"/> and Well-beloved Cousin, the Lord Viscount <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> and Our Trusty and Well-beloved Servant, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> Knight, one of the Gentlemen of Our Bed-Chamber, to deliver to you; to the end, that You, and all the rest of Our good Subjects of that Our City of <HI>London</HI> (to whom We desire it should be published) may know, how far We are from the desire of revenge, or that the Peace, Happiness, and Se∣curity of the Kingdom, should be raised upon any other founda∣tion than the affections and hearts of Our Subjects, and their own” Consents.</Q></P>

THE two Gentlemen lately mention'd to have been with the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John Creenvil <HI>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rives in</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>and com∣municates the Letters to the General. The General<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ behaviour af¦ter that time</HI></NOTE> return'd to <HI>London</HI> before the defeat of <HI>Lambert,</HI> and a full week be∣fore the Parliament was to begin. The General, upon the perusal of the Copies of the several dispatches, liked all very well. And it ought to be remember'd for his honour, that from this time he behaved himself with great affection towards the King; and though he was offer'd all the Au∣thority that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had enjoyed, and the Title of King, he used all his endeavours to promote and advance the Interest of his Majesty: yet he as carefully retained the Secret, and did not communicate to any Person living (M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Morrice</HI> only excepted) that he had receiv'd any Letter <MILESTONE N="10"/> from the King, till the very minute that he presented it to the House of Commons.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd at the same time a concurrence, which much faci∣litated <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the King's Party at this time; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich had great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> the great work in hand. For since a great obstruction that hin∣der'd the Universal consent to call in the King, was the Conscience of the personal injuries, incivilities, reproachful, and barbarous usage, which all the Royal Party had sustain'd, and the Apprehension that their Animosities were so great, that, notwithstanding all Acts of Pardon and Indemnity granted by the King, all opportunities would be embraced for secret revenge, and that They who had been kept under, and op∣pressed <MILESTONE N="20"/> for near twenty years, would for the future use the power they could not be without upon the King's Restoration, with extreme Li∣cence and Insolence; to obviate this too reasonable imagination, some discreet Persons of the King's Party caused a Declaration to be prepared; <Q>in which (after their acknowledgements and thanks to the General, “for having, next under the Divine Providence, so far conducted these Na∣tions towards a happy recovery of their Laws, and Ancient Govern∣ment)” they sincerely professed,</Q> <Q>“that they reflected on their past Suf∣ferings as from the hand of God; and therefore did not cherish any vio∣lent thoughts or inclinations against any Persons whatsoever, who had been any way instrumental in them; and that, if the indiscretion of <MILESTONE N="30"/> any particular Persons should transport them to Expressions contrary” to this their general Sense, they utterly disclaimed them.</Q> <Q>They far∣ther promised, “by their quiet and peaceable behaviour, to testify their submission to the Council of State, in expectation of the future Parlia∣ment; on whose wisdom, they trusted, God would give such a Blessing,” as might produce a perfect Settlement both in Church and State.</Q> <Q>And lastly they declared, “that, as the General had not chosen the sandy foundations of self-Government, but the firm Rock of National In∣terest, whereon to frame a settlement, so it was their hope and prayer, that, when the building should come to be raised, it might not, like <MILESTONE N="40"/> <HI>Rome,</HI> have the beginning in the blood of Brethren; nor, like <HI>Babel,</HI> be interrupted by confusion of Tongues; but that all might speak one Language, and be of one Name; that all mention of parties and fa∣ctions, and all rancor and animosities may be thrown in, and buried,” like Rubbish under the Foundation.</Q></P>
<P>THESE professions, or to the same purpose, under the title of a De∣claration of the Nobility, and Gentry, and Clergy, that had served the late King, or his present Majesty, or adhered to the Royal Party in such a City or County, which was named, were signed by all the considera∣ble Persons therein; as This that We have here mention'd, was sub∣scribed <MILESTONE N="50"/> by great Numbers in and about the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>West∣minster;</HI>

and so were several others from other places; and then all printed with their Names, and published to the view of the world; which were receiv'd with great joy, and did much allay those jealousies, which obstructed the confidence that was necessary to establish a good Under∣standing between them.</P>
<P>NOTHING hath been of late said of <HI>Ireland;</HI> which waited upon the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> Ireland <HI>for some years past till this time.</HI></NOTE> dictates of the Governing Party in <HI>England</HI> with the same giddiness. The <HI>Irish,</HI> who would now have been glad to have redeem'd their past Mis∣carriages and Madness by doing Service for the King, were under as se∣vere a Captivity, and compleat Misery, as the worst of their Actions <MILESTONE N="10"/> had deserv'd, and indeed as they were capable of undergoing. After near one hundred thousand of them transported into foreign parts, for the Service of the two Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> few of whom were alive after seven years, and after double that Number consumed by the Plague and Famine, and Severities exercised upon them in their own Country; the remainder of them had been by <HI>Cromwell</HI> (who could not find a better way of extirpation) transplanted into the most inland, barren, desolate, and mountainous part of the Province of <HI>Conaught;</HI> and it was lawful for any Man to kill any of the <HI>Irish,</HI> who were found in any place out of those precincts which were assign'd to them within <MILESTONE N="20"/> that Circuit. Such a proportion of Land was allotted to every Man as the Protector thought competent for them; upon which they were to give formal releases of all their pretences and titles to any Lands in any other Provinces, of which they had been deprived; and if they refused to give such Releases, they were still deprived of what they would not release, without any reasonable hope of ever being restored to it; and left to starve within the Limits prescribed to them; out of which they durst not withdraw; and They who did adventure, were without all remorse prosecuted by the <HI>English,</HI> assoon as they were discover'd: so that very few refused to sign those Releases, or other Acts which were <MILESTONE N="30"/> demanded; upon which the Lords and Gentlemen, had such Assign∣ments of Land made to them, as in some degree were proportionable to their Qualities; which fell out less mischievously to those who were of that Province, who came to enjoy some part of what had been their own; but to those who were driven thither out of other Provinces, it was little less destructive than if they had nothing; it was so long be∣fore they could settle themselves, and by husbandry raise any thing out of their Lands to support their Lives: yet necessity obliged them to acquiescence, and to be in some sort industrious; so that at the time to which we are now arriv'd, they were settled, within the Limits pre∣scribed, <MILESTONE N="40"/> in a condition of living; though even the hard Articles which had been granted, were not punctually observ'd to them; but their pro∣portions restrain'd, and lessen'd by some pretences of the <HI>English,</HI> under some former Grants, or other Titles; to all which they found it necessary to submit, and were compell'd to enjoy what was left, under all the marks and brands which ever accompanied a conquer'd Nation; which reproach the <HI>Irish</HI> had taken so heavily from the Earl of <HI>Straf∣ford,</HI> when they were equally free with the <HI>English,</HI> who had sub∣dued them, that they made it part of that Charge upon which he lost his Life. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>UPON the recalling, and tame Submission of <HI>Harry Cromwell</HI> to the Rump-Parliament, assoon as his Brother <HI>Richard</HI> was deposed, the
<PB N="589" REF="6010"/>
factions encreased in <HI>Ireland</HI> to a very great height, as well amongst the Soldiers and Officers of the Army, as in the Council of State, and amongst the Civil Magistrates. The Lord <HI>Broghill,</HI> who was President of <HI>Munster,</HI> and of a very great interest, and influence upon that whole Province, though he had great wariness in discovering his Inclinations, as he had great guilt to restrain them, yet hated <HI>Lambert</HI> so much, that he less feared the King; and so wished for a safe opportunity to do his Majesty Service; and he had a good Post, and a good Party to concur with him, when he should call upon them, and think fit to declare. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>SIR <HI>Charles Coot,</HI> who was President of <HI>Conaught,</HI> and had a good Command, and Interest in the Army, was a Man of less guilt, and more courage, and impatience to serve the King. He sent over S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ar∣thur Forbes,</HI> a <HI>Scotish</HI> Gentleman of good Affection to the King, and good Interest in the Province of <HI>Ulster,</HI> where he was an Officer of Horse. This Gentleman S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Charles Coot</HI> sent to <HI>Brussels</HI> to the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <Q>“that he might assure his Majesty of his Affection and Duty; and that, if his Majesty would vouchsafe himself to come into <HI>Ireland,</HI> he was confident the whole Kingdom would declare for him: that though the present power in <HI>England</HI> had remov'd all the sober Men <MILESTONE N="20"/> from the Government of the State, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> under the Character of Presbyterians; and had put <HI>Ludlow, Corbet,</HI> and others of the King's Judges in their places; yet they were so generally odious to the Army as well as to the People, that they could seise upon their Per∣sons, and the very Castle of <HI>Dublin,</HI> when they should judge it con∣venient.”</Q></P>
<P>SIR <HI>Arthur Forbes</HI> arrived at <HI>Brussels,</HI> before the King had any as∣surance or confident hope of the General, and when few Men thought his Fortune better than desperate: so that, if what S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur</HI> proposed (which was kept very secret) had been publish'd, most Men about the Court would have been very sollicitous for his Majesty's going into <HI>Ire∣land.</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"/> But his Majesty well knew that that unhappy Kingdom must in∣fallibly wait upon the fate of <HI>England;</HI> and therefore he resolv'd to at∣tend the vicissitudes there; which, in his own thoughts, he still be∣liev'd would produce somewhat, in the end, of which he should have the benefit; and dismissed S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur Forbes</HI> with such Letters and Commissions as he desired; who thereupon return'd for <HI>Ireland;</HI> where he found the State of Affairs very much alter'd since his departure. For upon the Defeat of <HI>Lambert,</HI> and General <HI>Monk</HI>'s marching towards <HI>London,</HI> the Lord <HI>Broghill,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Charles Coot,</HI> notwithstanding the jealousy that was between them, joyn'd with such other Persons who <MILESTONE N="40"/> were Presbyterians, and though they had been allways against the King, yet they all concurr'd in seising upon the Persons who had been put in by <HI>Lambert,</HI> or the Rump-Parliament, and submitted to the Orders of General <HI>Monk,</HI> the rather, because they did imagine that he intended to serve the King; and so, by the time that the Parliament was to meet at <HI>Westminster,</HI> all things were so well disposed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that it was evident they would do whatsoever the General, and the Par∣liament (who they presumed would be of one mind) should order them to do. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>
<P>THE Parliament met upon the five and twentieth day of <HI>April;</HI> of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia∣ment met</HI> A∣pril 25.</NOTE> which the General was return'd a Member, to serve as Knight of the

His Election to be Speaker at this time was contriv'd by those who meant well to the King; and he submitted to it out of a hope and confidence that the de∣signs it was laid for would succeed. They begun chiefly with bitter In∣vectives <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their first Proceedings.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"/> against the Memory of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> as an odious and perjur'd Ty∣rant, with execrations upon the unchristian Murther of the late King.

And from this time <HI>Charles Stuart</HI> was no more heard of: and so universal a joy was never seen within <NOTE PLACE="marg">Receiv'd with universal Joy.</NOTE> those Walls; and though there were some Members there, who were nothing delighted with the temper of the House, nor with the Argu∣ment of it, and probably had malice enough to make within themselves the most execrable wishes, yet they had not the hardiness to appear less transported than the rest; who, not deferring it one Moment, and with∣out one contradicting Voice, appointed a Committee to prepare an An∣swer <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee appointed to prepare an Answer.</NOTE> to his Majesty's Letter, expressing the great and joyful sense the <MILESTONE N="40"/> House had of his gracious Offers, and their humble and hearty thanks for the same, and with professions of their loyalty and duty to his Majesty; and that the House would give a speedy Answer to his Ma∣jesty's gracious Proposals. They likewise ordered, at the same time, <NOTE PLACE="marg">All order'd to be printed.</NOTE> that both his Majesty's Letters, that to the House, and that to the General, with his Majesty's Declaration therein inclosed, and the Re∣solution of the House thereupon, should be forthwith printed and pub∣lished.</P>
<P>THIS kind of Reception was beyond what the best affected, nay <MILESTONE N="50"/> even the King, could expect or hope; and all that followed went in the same pace. The Lords, when they saw what Spirit the House of
<PB N="591" REF="6030"/>
Commons was possessed of, would not lose their share of thanks, but made hast into their House without excluding any who had been se∣quester'd from sitting there for their Delinquency; and then they re∣ceiv'd likewise the Letter from S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> which his Majesty <NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>S<SUP>r</SUP> John Green∣vil <HI>delivers the Letter to the House of Lords.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Lord Mayor &amp;c re∣ceive their Letter with the same duty So does the Army and Fleet.</HI></P></NOTE> had directed to them; and they receiv'd it with the same duty and acknowledgement. The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Coun∣cil, were likewise transported with the King's goodness towards them, and with the Expressions of his Royal Clemency; and enter'd into close Deliberation, what return they should make to him to manifest their duty and gratitude. And the Officers of the Army, and Fleet, <MILESTONE N="10"/> upon the sight of the Letters to their Generals, and his Majesty's De∣claration, thought themselves highly honour'd, in that they were looked upon as good Instruments of his Majesty's Restoration; and made those Vows, and published such Declarations of their Loyalty and Duty, as their Generals caused to be provided for them; which they signed with the loudest alacrity. And the truth is, the Gene∣ral managed the business, which he now own'd himself to have un∣dertaken, with wonderful prudence and dexterity. And as the na∣ture and humour of his Officers was well known to him, so he re∣moved such from their Commands whose Affections he suspected, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and conferr'd their places upon others, of whom he was most as∣sured. In a word, there was either real joy in the hearts of all Men, or at least their Countenance appear'd such as if they were glad at the heart.</P>
<P>THE Committee who were appointed by the House of Commons to prepare an Answer to the King's Letter, found it hard to satisfy all Men, who were well contented that the King should be invited to re∣turn: but some thought, that the guilt of the Nation did require less precipitation than was like to be used; and that the Treaty ought first to be made with the King, and conditions of Security agreed on, be∣fore <MILESTONE N="30"/> his Majesty should be receiv'd. Many of those, who had con∣ferr'd together before the meeting of the Parliament, had design'd some Articles to be prepared, according to the Model of those at <HI>Kil∣lingworth,</HI> in the time of King <HI>Harry</HI> the third, to which the King should be sworn before he came home. Then the Presbyterian Party, of which there were many Members in Parliament, though they were rather troublesome than powerful, seem'd very sollicitous that some∣what should be concluded in veneration of the Covenant; and, at least, that somewhat should be inserted in their Answer to the discoun∣tenance of the Bishops. But the warmer Zeal of the House threw <MILESTONE N="40"/> away all those formalities and affectations: <Q>They said, “they had pro∣ceeded too far already in their Vote upon the receipt of the Letter, to fall back again, and to offend the King with colder Expressions” of their duty.</Q> In the end, after some days debate, finding an equal impatience without the Walls to that within the House, they were contented to gratify the Presbyterians in the length of the Answer. and in using some Expressions which would please Them, and could do the King no prejudice; and all agreed, that This Answer should be return'd to his Majesty, which is here inserted in the very words. <MILESTONE N="50"/></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Most Royal Soveraign,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>“WE Your Majesty's most Loyal Subjects, the Commons of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Answer of the House of Commons to the King.</NOTE> assembled in Parliament, do, with all humbleness, present unto your Majesty the unfeigned thankfulness of Our hearts, for those gracious Expressions of Piety, and Goodness, and Love to Us, and the Nations under your Dominion, which your Majesty's Letter of the 4/14 of <HI>April,</HI> dated from <HI>Breda,</HI> together with the Declaration inclosed in it of the same date, do so evidently contain. For which <MILESTONE N="10"/> We do, in the first place, look up to the great King of Kings, and bless his name, who hath put these thoughts into the heart of Our King, to make him glorious in the Eyes of his People; as those great Deliverances, which that Divine Majesty hath afforded unto your Royal Person, from many dangers, and the support which he hath given to your Heroick and Princely mind under various tryals, make it appear to all the world that you are precious in His sight. And give us leave to say, that as your Majesty is pleased to declare your confidence in Parliaments, your Esteem of them, and this your judgement, and Character of them, that they are so necessary for the <MILESTONE N="20"/> Government of the Kingdom, that neither Prince nor People can be in any tolerable degree happy without them, and therefore say, that you will hearken unto their Counsels, be tender of their Privi∣leges, and careful to preserve, and protect them; so We trust, and will, with all humility, be bold to affirm, that your Majesty will not be deceiv'd in Us, and that We will never depart from that fidelity which We owe unto your Majesty, that Zeal which We bear unto your Service, and a constant endeavour to advance your Honour and” Greatness.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“AND We beseech your Majesty, We may add this farther for the <MILESTONE N="30"/> vindication of Parliaments, and even of the last Parliament, conven'd under your Royal Father of happy Memory, when, as your Majesty well observes, through mistakes, and misunderstandings, many incon∣veniences were produced, which were not intended, that those very inconveniences could not have been brought upon Us by those Per∣sons who had design'd them, without violating the Parliament it self. For they well knew it was not possible to do a violence to that sacred Person, whilst the Parliament, which had vowed and cove∣nanted for the defence and safety of that Person, remain'd entire. Surely, Sir, as the Persons of Our Kings have ever been dear unto <MILESTONE N="40"/> Parliaments, so We cannot think of that horrid Act committed against the precious life of Our late Soveraign, but with such a de∣testation, and abhorrency, as We want words to express it; and, next to wishing it had never been, We wish it may never be remember'd by your Majesty, to be unto you an occasion of sorrow, as it will never be remember'd by Us, but with that grief and trouble of mind which it deserves; being the greatest reproach that ever was incurr'd by any of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, an Offence to all the Protestant Churches abroad, and a scandal to the profession of the truth of Religion here at home; though both Profession, and true Professors, and the Na∣tion <MILESTONE N="50"/> it self, as well as the Parliament, were most innocent of it; it having been only the Contrivance and Act of some few ambitious
<PB N="593" REF="6050"/>
and bloody Persons, and such others, as by Their influence were misled. And as We hope and pray, that God will not impute the guilt of it, nor of all the evil Consequences thereof, unto the Land, whose Divine Justice never involves the guiltless with the guilty, so We cannot but give due praise to your Majesty's goodness, who are pleased to entertain such reconciled, and reconciling thoughts, and with them not only meet, but as it were prevent your Parliament and People, proposing your self in a great measure, and inviting the Parliament to consider farther, and advise your Majesty, what may be necessary to restore the Nation to what it hath lost, raise up again <MILESTONE N="10"/> the Banks and Fences of it, and make the Kingdom happy by the advancement of Religion, the Security of Our Laws, Liberties, and Estates, and the removing all Jealousies and Animosities, which may render our Peace less certain and durable. Wherein your Majesty gives a large Evidence of your great Wisdom; judging aright, that, after so high a distemper, and such an universal shaking of the very foundations, great care must be had to repair the breaches, and much circumspection and industry used to provide things necessary for the strengthning of those repairs, and preventing whatsoever may disturb” or weaken them.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"/></P>
<P><Q>WE shall immediately apply our selves to the preparing of these “things; and, in a very short time, We hope to be able to present them to your Majesty; and for the present do, with all humble thank∣fulness, acknowledge your grace and favour in assuring Us of your Royal concurrence with Us, and saying, that we shall not expect any thing from you, but what You will be as ready to give, as We to re∣ceive. And We cannot doubt of your Majesty's effectual performance, since your own Princely judgement hath prompted unto you the ne∣cessity of doing such things; and your piety and goodness hath car∣ried you to a free tender of them to your faithful Parliament. You speak as a Gracious King, and We will do what befits Dutiful, Loving, <MILESTONE N="30"/> and Loyal Subjects; who are yet more engaged to honour, and high∣ly esteem your Majesty, for your declining, as you were pleased to say, all foreign Assistance, and rather trusting to your People; who, We do assure your Majesty, will, and do open their Armes and their Hearts to receive you, and will spare neither their Estates, nor their” Lives, when your Service shall require it of them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“AND We have yet more Cause to enlarge our Praise, and our Prayers to God for your Majesty, that You have continued unshaken in your faith; that neither the temptation of allurements, perswa∣sions, and promises from seducing Papists on the one hand, nor the <MILESTONE N="40"/> persecution, and hard usage from some seduced, and misguided Pro∣fessors of the Protestant Religion on the other hand, could at all pre∣vail on your Majesty, to make You forsake the Rock of <HI>Israel,</HI> the God of your Fathers, and the true Protestant Religion, in which your Majesty hath been bred; but you have still been as a Rock your self, firm to your Covenant with Your and Our God, even now expressing your Zeal and Affection for the Protestant Religion, and your care and study for the propagation thereof. This hath been a rejoycing of heart to all the faithful of the Land, and an Assurance <MILESTONE N="50"/> to them that God would not forsake you; but after many Tryals, which should but make you more precious, as Gold out of the fire,
<PB N="594" REF="6060"/>
would restore your Majesty unto your Patrimony, and People, with more Splendor and Dignity, and make you the Glory of Kings, and the Joy of your Subjects: which is, and shall ever be, the Prayer of your Majesty's most Loyal Subjects, the Commons of <HI>England</HI> as∣sembled” in Parliament.</Q></P>

<HI>Speaker.</HI></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>ASSOON as this Letter was engrossed and signed, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Greenvil</HI> was appointed to attend again; <Q>and he being brought to the Bar, the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This Answer is deliver'd to S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> John Green∣vil.</NOTE> Speaker stood up, and told him, “that They need not acquaint him with what grateful hearts they had receiv'd his Majesty's gracious Letter; he <MILESTONE N="10"/> himself was an ear and eye-witness of it: their Bells and their Bone∣fires had already begun the Proclamation of his Majesty's goodness, and of Their joys; that they had now prepared an Answer to his Ma∣jesty, which should be deliver'd to him; and that they did not think fit he should return to their Royal Soveraign without some testimony of their respects to himself; and therefore that they had order'd five hundred pounds to be deliver'd to him, to buy a Jewel to wear, as an honour for being the Messenger of so gracious a Message; and in” the Name of the House he gave him their most hearty thanks.</Q> So <MILESTONE N="20"/> great and suddain a Change was this, that a Servant of the King's, who, for near ten years together, had been in Prisons, and under con∣finements, only for being the King's Servant, and would, but three Months before, have been put to have undergone a shameful death, if he had been known to have seen the King, should be now rewarded for bringing a Message from him. From this time there was such an Emulation and Impatience in Lords, and Commons, and City, and generally over the Kingdom, who should make the most lively Expres∣sions of their Duty and of their Joy, that a Man could not but won∣der where those People dwelt who had done all the mischief, and kept <MILESTONE N="30"/> the King so many years from enjoying the comfort and support of such excellent Subjects.</P>
<P>THE Lords and the Commons now conferr'd together, how they might with more Lustre perform those respects that might be prepa∣ratory to his Majesty's Return. They remember'd, that, upon the Murther of the late King, there was a Declaration, that no Man, upon peril of his life, and forfeiture of his Estate, should presume to pro∣claim his Successor; which so terrified the People, that they scarce dared so much as to pray for him. Wherefore, though this Parliament had now, by all the ways they could think of, published their return <MILESTONE N="40"/> to their obedience, yet they thought it necessary, for the better infor∣mation and conviction of the People, to make some solemn Proclama∣tion of his Majesty's undoubted Right to the Crown, and to oblige all Men to pay that reverence, and duty to him, which they ought to do by the Laws of God and of the Land. Whereupon they gave order to prepare such a Proclamation; which being done, the Lords and Commons, the General having concerted all things with the City, met in <HI>Westminster-</HI>Hall upon the 8<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May,</HI> within seven days after the receipt of the King's Letter; and walked into the <HI>Palace-</HI>yard; where they all stood bare, whilst the Heraulds proclaim'd the King. Then <MILESTONE N="50"/> they went to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and did the same; and afterwards at <HI>Tem∣ple-Bar;</HI> where the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen, and all the Com∣panies
<PB N="595" REF="6070"/>
of the City receiv'd them, when the like Proclamation was made in like manner there; and then in the usual places of the City; which done, the remainder of the day, and the night, was spent in those Acclamations, Festivals, Bells and Bonefires, as are the natural Attendants upon such Solemnities. And then nothing was thought of, but to make such preparations as should be necessary for his Majesty's invitation and Reception. The Proclamation made was in these words:</P>
<P><Q>“ALTHOUGH it can no way be doubted, but that his Majesty's <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King pro∣claim'd</HI> May<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> Right, and Title to his Crown and Kingdoms, is, and was every way compleated by the death of his most Royal Father of glorious <MILESTONE N="10"/> Memory, without the ceremony or solemnity of a Proclamation; yet, since Proclamations in such Cases have been allways used, to the end that all good Subjects might, upon this occasion, testify their duty and respect, and since the armed violence, and other the Calamities of many years last past, have hitherto deprived Us of any such oppor∣tunity, whereby We might express Our Loyalty and Allegiance to his Majesty, We therefore, the Lords and Commons now assembled in Parliament, together with the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and other Freemen of this Kingdom now pre∣sent, do, according to our Duty and Allegiance, heartily, joyfully, <MILESTONE N="20"/> and unanimously acknowledge and proclaim, that immediately upon the decease of Our late Soveraign Lord King <HI>Charles,</HI> the imperial Crown of the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and of all the Kingdoms, Domi∣nions, and Rights belonging to the same, did, by inherent Birth-right and lawful undoubted Succession, descend and come to his most ex∣cellent Majesty <HI>Charles</HI> the second, as being lineally, justly, and law∣fully next Heir of the blood Royal of this Realm; and that, by the Goodness and Providence of Almighty God, He is of <HI>England, Scot∣land, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the most potent, mighty, and undoubted King; and thereunto We most humbly and faithfully do submit, and” <MILESTONE N="30"/> oblige our Selves, our Heirs, and Posterity for ever.</Q></P>
<P>FROM the time that the King came to <HI>Breda,</HI> very few days passed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Ad∣dresses to the King.</NOTE> without some Express from <HI>London,</HI> upon the observations of his Friends, and the Applications made to them by many who had been very active against the King, and were now as sollicitous his Majesty should know, that they wholely dedicated themselves to his Service. Even before the General had declared himself, or the Parliament was assembled, some, who had sate Judges upon his Father, sent many Ex∣cuses, that they were forced to it, and offer'd to perform signal Services, <MILESTONE N="40"/> if they might obtain their Pardon. But his Majesty would admit no Address from them, nor hearken to any Propositions made on their behalf.</P>
<P>THERE was one instance that perplexed him; which was the Case <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The particular Case of</HI> In∣goldsby.</NOTE> of Colonel <HI>Ingoldsby;</HI> who was in the Number of the late King's Judges, and whose Name was in the Warrant for his Murther. <Q>He, from the deposal of <HI>Richard,</HI> had declared, that he would serve the King, and told M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> “that he would perform all Services he could, without making any conditions; and would be well content, that his Majesty, when he came home, should take his head off, if he thought fit; only he desired that the King might know the truth of” <MILESTONE N="50"/> his Case; which was this.</Q></P>
<P>HE was a Gentleman of a good Extraction, and near allied to <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> who had drawn him into the Army before, or about the time
<PB N="596" REF="6080"/>
when he came first to age, where he grew to be a Colonel of Horse, and to have the reputation of great Courage against the Enemy, and of equal civility to all Men. It is very true, he was named amongst those who were appointed to be Judges of the King; and it is as true, that he was never once present with them, allways abhorring the Action in his heart, and having no other Passion in any part of the Quarrel, but his personal kindness to <HI>Cromwell.</HI> The next day after the horrid Sentence was pronounced, he had an occasion to speak with an Officer, who, he was told, was in the painted Chamber; where, when he came thither, he saw <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the rest of those who <MILESTONE N="10"/> had sate upon the King, and were then, as he found afterwards, as∣sembled to sign the Warrant for the King's death. Assoon as <HI>Crom∣well</HI>'s Eyes were upon him, he run to him, and taking him by the hand, drew him by force to the Table; <Q>and said, “though he had escaped him all the while before, he should now sign that Paper as” well as They;</Q> <Q>which he, seeing what it was, refused with great pas∣sion; saying, “”he knew nothing of the business;</Q> and offer'd to go away. But <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and others, held him by violence; and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> with a loud laughter, taking his hand in his, and putting the Pen between his Fingers, with his own hand writ <HI>Richard Ingoldsby,</HI> he making <MILESTONE N="20"/> all the resistance he could: <Q>and he said, “if his Name there were com∣pared with what he had ever writ himself, it could never be look'd” upon as his own hand.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH his Majesty had within himself compassion for him, he would never send him any assurance of his Pardon; presuming that, if all these Allegations were true, there would be a Season when a distin∣ction would be made, without his Majesty's declaring himself between him and those other of that bloody List, which he resolv'd never to pardon. Nor was <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> at all dishearten'd with this, but pursued his former Resolutions, and first surprised the Castle of <HI>Windsor</HI> (where <MILESTONE N="30"/> there was a great Magazine of Armes and Ammunition) and put out that Governour whom the Rump had put in; and afterwards took <HI>Lambert</HI> Prisoner, as is before remember'd.</P>
<P>WHILST the Fleet was preparing, Admiral <HI>Mountague</HI> sent his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountague<HI>'s Message to the King.</HI></NOTE> Cousin <HI>Edward Mountague</HI> to the King, to let him know that, assoon as it should be ready (which he hoped might be within so many days) he would be himself on board, and would then be ready to receive and obey his Majesty's Orders: this was before the Parliament assembled. He sent word what Officers he was confident of, and of whom he was not assured, and who he concluded would not concur with him, and <MILESTONE N="40"/> who must be reduced by force. He desired to know whether the King had any Assurance of the General, who however, he wish'd, might know nothing of his Resolutions. And it was no small inconvenience to his Majesty, that he was restrain'd from communicating to either, the confidence he had in the other; which might have facilitated both their designs. But the mutual jealousies between them, and indeed of all Men, would not permit that liberty to his Majesty.</P>
<P>THE frequent resort of Persons to <HI>Brussels,</HI> before they knew of the King's being gone to <HI>Breda,</HI> and their Communication of the good News they brought to his Majesty's Servants, and the other <HI>English</HI> who <MILESTONE N="50"/> remain'd there, and who publish'd what they wish'd as come to pass, as well as what they heard, made the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ministers begin to think, that the King's Affairs were not altogether so hopeless as they imagin'd
<PB N="597" REF="6090"/>
them to be, and that there was more in the King's remove to <HI>Breda</HI> than at first appear'd. They had every day expected to hear that the States had sent to forbid his Majesty to remain in their Dominions, as they had done when his presence had been less notorious. But when they could hear of no such thing, but of greater resort thither to the King, and that he had staid longer there than he had seem'd to intend to do, the Marquis of <HI>Carracena</HI> sent a Person of prime Quality to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Carracena <HI>invites the King back to</HI> Brussels</NOTE> <HI>Breda,</HI> <Q>“to invite his Majesty to return to <HI>Brussels;</HI> the rather, be∣cause he had receiv'd some very hopeful Propositions from <HI>England,</HI> to which he was not willing to make any Answer, without receiving” <MILESTONE N="10"/> his Majesty's Approbation and Command.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King sent him word, “that he was obliged, with reference to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer.</NOTE> his business in <HI>England,</HI> to stay where he was; and that he was not without hope that his Affairs might succeed so well, that he should” not be necessitated to return to <HI>Brussels</HI> at all.</Q> <Q>Which Answer the Marquis no sooner recev'd, than he return'd the same Messenger with a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marquis invites the King again, but in vain</NOTE> kind of Expostulation “for the indignity that would be offer'd to his Catholick Majesty, if he should leave his Dominions in such a man∣ner; and therefore besought him, either to return himself thither, or that the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> or at least one of <MILESTONE N="20"/> them, might come to <HI>Brussels,</HI> that the world might not believe, that his Majesty was offended with the Catholick King; who had treated” him so well.</Q> When he found that he was to receive no satisfaction in either of those particulars, though the King, and both the Dukes, made their excuses with all possible acknowledgement of the favours they had receiv'd from his Catholick Majesty, and of the Civilities shewed to them by the Marquis himself, he reveng'd himself upon <HI>Don Alonzo</HI> with a million of reproaches, <Q>“for his stupidity and ignorance in the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> and of every thing relating thereunto, after” having resided sixteen years Embassadour in that Kingdom.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>CARDINAL <HI>Mazarin</HI> had better Intelligence from the <HI>French</HI> Em∣bassadour in <HI>London;</HI> who gave him diligent Accounts of every day's alteration, and of the general imagination that <HI>Monk</HI> had other Inten∣tions than he yet discover'd. And when he heard that the King was re∣moved from <HI>Brussels</HI> to <HI>Breda,</HI> he presently perswaded the Queen Mo∣ther <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cardinal</HI> Ma∣zarin <HI>per∣swades the Queen Mother of</HI> England, <HI>to send the Lord</HI> Jermyn <HI>to in∣vite the King to come into</HI> France.</NOTE> of <HI>England</HI> to send the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> (whom the King had lately, upon his Mother's desire, <Q>created Earl of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Albans)</HI> to invite the King “to come into <HI>France;</HI> and to make that Treaty, which, probably, would be between the ensuing Parliament and his Majesty, in that Kingdom; which might prove of great use and advantage to her Ma∣jesty's Interest, and Honour; in which the power of the Cardinal <MILESTONE N="40"/> might be of great importance in diverting, or allaying any insolent” Demands which might be made.</Q> <Q>And the Cardinal himself made the same Invitation by that Lord, with professions of wonderful kindness; and “that the most Christian King was infinitely desirous to perform all those Offices and respects to his Majesty, which he had allways de∣sired,” but was never able to accomplish till Now;</Q> <Q>with this Addi∣tion, “that if his Majesty found that the expedition of his Affairs would not permit him to come to <HI>Paris,</HI> Order and Preparations should be made for his reception at <HI>Calais,</HI> or any other place he would appoint; where” the Queen his Mother would attend him;</Q> with all other Expressions <MILESTONE N="50"/> of the highest Esteem; which the cunning of that great Minister was plentifully supplied with.</P>
<P><PB N="598" REF="6100"/>
THE Earl of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Albans</HI> found the King in too good a posture of hope and expectation, to suffer himself to be much importuned upon the Instances he brought; <Q>and was contented to return with the King's acknowledgements and excuse, “that he could not decently pass through <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer.</NOTE> <HI>Flanders,</HI> after he had refused to return to <HI>Brussels;</HI> and without go∣ing through those Provinces, he could not well make a journey into” <HI>France.</HI></Q> In the mean time it was no small pleasure to his Majesty, to find himself so solemnly invited, by the Ministers of these two great Kings, to enter into their Dominions, out of one which he had been rejected with so many disobligations and indignities; and with so <MILESTONE N="10"/> much caution and apprehension had been suffer'd to pass through the other, that he might not reside a day there, or spend more time than was absolutely necessary for his journey.</P>
<P>SEVERAL Persons now came to <HI>Breda,</HI> not, as heretofore to <HI>Co∣logne,</HI> and to <HI>Brussels,</HI> under disguises, and in fear to be discover'd, but with bare faces, and the pride and vanity to be taken notice of, to pre∣sent their duty to the King; some being imploy'd to procure Pardons for those who thought themselves in danger, and to stand in need of them; others brought good Presents in <HI>English</HI> Gold to the King, that their Names, and the Names of their Friends, who sent them, might <MILESTONE N="20"/> be remember'd amongst the first of those who made demonstrations of their Affections that way to his Majesty, by supplying his necessities; which had been discontinued for many years to a degree that cannot be believ'd, and ought not to be remember'd. By these supplies his Majesty was enabled, besides the payment of his other debts, not only to pay all his Servants the Arrears of their Board-Wages, but to give them all some testimony of his bounty, to raise their Spirits after so many years of patient waiting for deliverance: and all this was before the delivery of the King's Letter by the General to the Parliament.</P>
<P>THE King had not been many days in <HI>Breda,</HI> before the States Ge∣neral <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The States Ge∣neral congra∣tulate the King's coming to</HI> Breda; <HI>and the States of</HI> Holland <HI>in∣vite him to the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> sent Deputies of their own Body to congratulate his Majesty's Ar∣rival <MILESTONE N="30"/> in their Dominions, and to acknowledge the great honour he had vouchsafed to do them. <Q>And shortly after, other Deputies came from the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> beseeching his Majesty, “that he would grace that Province with his Royal presence at the <HI>Hague,</HI> where prepara∣tions should be made for his reception, in such a manner as would testify the great joy of their hearts for the blessings which Divine” Providence was pouring upon his head.</Q> His Majesty accepting their invitation, they return'd in order to make his journey thither, and his Entertainment there, equal to their Professions. <MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>IN the mean time <HI>Breda</HI> swarm'd with <HI>English,</HI> a multitude repairing thither from all other places, as well as <HI>London,</HI> with Presents, and Pro∣testations, <Q>“how much they had longed, and prayed for this blessed” Change;</Q> and magnifying their Sufferings under the late Tyrannical Go∣vernment; when some of them had been zealous Instruments and Pro∣moters of it. The Magistrates of the Town took all imaginable care to express their Devotion to the King, by using all civilities towards, and providing for the accommodation of the multitude of his Subjects, who resorted thither to express their duty to him. So that no Man would have imagin'd by the treatment he now receiv'd, that he had been so lately forbid to come into that place; which indeed had not proceeded <MILESTONE N="50"/> from the disaffection of the Inhabitants of that good Town, who had allways passion for his prosperity, and even then publickly detested
<PB N="599" REF="6110"/>
the rudeness of their Superiours, whom they were bound to obey.</P>
<P>ALL things being in readiness, and the States having sent their Yachts and other Vessels, for the Accommodation of his Majesty and his Train, as near to <HI>Breda</HI> as the River would permit, the King, with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re∣moves to the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> his Royal Sister and Brothers, left that place in the beginning of <HI>May;</HI> and, within an hour, embarked themselves on board the Yachts, which carried him to <HI>Rotterdam; Dort,</HI> and the other places near which they passed, making all those Expressions of joy, by the conflux of the Peo∣ple to the banks of the River, and all other ways, which the Situation of those places would suffer. At <HI>Rotterdam</HI> they enter'd into their <MILESTONE N="10"/> Coaches; from whence to the <HI>Hague</HI> they seem'd to pass through one continued Street, by the wonderful and orderly appearance of the Peo∣ple on both sides, with such Acclamations of Joy, as if Themselves were now restored to Peace and Security.</P>
<P>THE Entrance into the <HI>Hague,</HI> and the Reception there, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Reception and Entertain∣ment there.</NOTE> conducting his Majesty to the House provided for his Entertainment, was very magnificent, and in all respects answerable to the Pomp, Wealth, and Greatness of that State. The Treatment of his Majesty, and all who had relation to his Service, at the States Charge, during the time of his abode there, which continued many days, was incredi∣bly <MILESTONE N="20"/> noble and splendid; and the universal Joy so visible, and real, that it could only be exceeded by that of his own Subjects. The States-Ge∣neral, in a Body, and the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> in a Body apart, perform'd their Compliments with all solemnity; and then several Persons, ac∣cording to their Faculties, made their professions; and a set Number of them was appointed allways to wait in the Court, to receive his Ma∣jesty's Commands. All the Embassadours and publick Ministers of Kings, Princes, and States, repaired to his Majesty, and professed the Joy of their Masters on his behalf: so that a Man would have thought this Revolution had been brought to pass by the general Combination, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> Activity of <HI>Christendom,</HI> that appear'd now to take so much pleasure in it.</P>
<P>THE King had been very few days at the <HI>Hague,</HI> when he heard that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> English <HI>Fleet comes on the Coast of</HI> Holland.</NOTE> the <HI>English</HI> Fleet was in sight of <HI>Scheveling;</HI> and shortly after, an Of∣ficer from Admiral <HI>Mountague</HI> was sent to the King, to present his duty to him, and to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> their High Admiral, to receive Or∣ders. Assoon as <HI>Mountague</HI> came on board the Fleet in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and found <HI>Lawson</HI> and the other Officers more frank in declaring their duty to the King, and resolution to serve him, than he expected, that he might not seem to be sent by the Parliament to his Majesty, but to <MILESTONE N="40"/> be carried by his own Affection and Duty, without expecting any Com∣mand from them, the wind coming fair, he set up his Sails, and stood for the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> leaving only two or three of the lesser Ships to receive their Orders, and to bring over those Persons, who, he knew, were design'd to wait upon his Majesty; which Expedition was never forgiven him by some Men; who took all occasions afterwards to re∣venge themselves upon him.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>York</HI> went the next day on board the Fleet, to take <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To Duke of</HI> York <HI>at Ad¦miral takes possession of the Fleet</HI></NOTE> Possession of his Command; where he was receiv'd by all the Officers and Seamen; with all possible duty and submission, and with those Ac¦clamations <MILESTONE N="50"/> which are peculiar to that People, and in which they excel. After he had spent the day there, in receiving Information of the state of the Fleet, and a Catalogue of the Names of the several Ships, his
<PB N="600" REF="6120"/>
Highness return'd with it that Night to the King, that his Majesty might make alterations, and new Christen those Ships which too much pre∣serv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ships new named.</NOTE> the memory of the late Governours, and of the Republick.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after, the Committee of Lords and Commons arriv'd at <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commit∣tee of Lords and Commons arrive at the</HI> Hague.</NOTE> the <HI>Hague;</HI> where the States took care for their decent Accommoda∣tion. And the next day they desired admission to his Majesty; who im∣mediately receiv'd them very graciously. From the House of Peers were deputed six of their Body, and, according to custom, twelve from the Commons. The Peers were, the Earls of <HI>Oxford, Warwick,</HI> and <HI>Mid∣dlesex,</HI> the Lord Viscount <HI>Hereford,</HI> the Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> of <HI>Berkley-</HI>Ca∣stle, <MILESTONE N="10"/> and the Lord <HI>Brook.</HI> From the Commons were sent, the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> the Lord <HI>Bruce,</HI> the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Castleton,</HI> the Lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> the Lord <HI>Mandevil, Denzil Hollis,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Horatio Towns∣end,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Anthony Ashley Cooper,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Booth,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Holland,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Cholmeley.</HI> <Q>These Persons presented the humble invitation and supplication of the Parliament, “that his Majesty would be pleased to return, and take the Government of the Kingdom into his hands; where he should find all possible affection, duty, and obedience, from” all his Subjects.</Q> And lest his return so much longed for might be re∣tarded by the want of Money, to discharge those debts, which he could <MILESTONE N="20"/> not but have contracted, they presented from the Parliament the Sum of fifty thousand pounds to his Majesty; having likewise Order to pay the Sum of ten thousand pounds to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and five thousand to the Duke of <HI>Glocester;</HI> which was a very good Supply to their several Necessities. The King treated all the Committee very graciously toge∣ther, and every one of them severally and particularly very obligingly. So that some of them, who were conscious to themselves of their for∣mer demerit, were very glad to find that they were not to fear any bit∣terness from so Princely, and so generous a Nature.</P>
<P>THE City of <HI>London</HI> had had too great a hand in driving the Father <MILESTONE N="30"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The City of</HI> London <HI>send</HI> 14 <HI>of their Ci∣tizens.</HI></NOTE> of the King from thence, not to appear equally Zealous for his Son's return thither. <Q>And therefore they did, at the same time, send four∣teen of the most substantial Citizens “to assure his Majesty of their fi∣delity, and most chearful submission; and that they placed all their felicity, and hope of future prosperity in the assurance of his Majesty's Grace and Protection; for the meriting whereof, their lives and for∣tunes” should be allways at his Majesty's disposal;</Q> and they presented to him from the City the Sum of ten thousand pounds. <Q>The King told them, “he had allways had a particular Affection for the City of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> the place of his Birth; and was very glad, that they had now so good a part in his Restoration; of which he was inform'd; and how” <MILESTONE N="40"/> much he was beholding to every one of them;</Q> for which he thanked them very graciously, and Knighted them all; an Honour no Man in the City had receiv'd in near twenty years, and with which they were much delighted.</P>
<P>IT will hardly be believ'd, that this Money presented to the King by the Parliament and the City, and charged by Bills of Exchange upon the richest Merchants in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> who had vast Estates, could not be receiv'd in many days, though some of the principal Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> who came to the King, went themselves to sollicite it, and <MILESTONE N="50"/> had credit enough themselves for much greater Sums, if they had brought over no Bills of Exchange. But this was not the first time (of which somewhat hath been said before) that it was evident to the
<PB N="601" REF="6130"/>
King, that it is not easy in that most opulent City, with the help of all the rich Towns adjacent, and upon the greatest credit, to draw toge∣ther a great Sum of ready Money; the custom of that Country, which flourishes so much in Trade, being to make their payments in Paper by Assignations; they having very rarely occasion for a great Sum in any one particular place. And so at this time his Majesty was compell'd, that he might not defer the voyage he so impatiently long'd to make, to take Bills of Exchange from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> upon their Correspondents in <HI>London,</HI> for above thirty thousand pounds of the Money that was assign'd; all which was paid in <HI>London</HI> assoon as demanded. <MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>WITH these Commissioners from the Parliament and from the City, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers Pres∣byterian Di∣vines came also.</NOTE> there came a Company of their Clergy-men, to the number of eight or ten; who would not be look'd upon as Chaplains to the rest, but being the popular Preachers of the City <HI>(Reynolds, Calamy, Case, Manton;</HI> and others, the most eminent of the Presbyterians) desired to be thought to represent that Party. They intreated to be admitted all together to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their publick Audience of the King.</NOTE> have a formal Audience of his Majesty; where they presented their du∣ties, and magnified the Affections of themselves and their Friends; <Q>who, they said, “had allways, according to the obligation of their Covenant, wish'd his Majesty very well; and had lately, upon the opportunity <MILESTONE N="20"/> that God had put into their hands, inform'd the People of their duty; which, they presumed, his Majesty had heard had proved effectual,” and been of great use to him.</Q> <Q>They thanked God “for his constancy” to the Protestant Religion;</Q> <Q>and professed, “that they were no enemies to moderate Episcopacy; only desired that such things might not be pressed upon them in God's Worship, which in Their judgement who used them were acknowledged to be matters indifferent, and by others” were held unlawful.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King spoke very kindly to them; and said, “that he had heard of their good behaviour towards him; and that he had no purpose to <MILESTONE N="30"/> impose hard conditions upon them, with reference to their Consciences: that they well knew, he had referr'd the settling all differences of that nature to the wisdom of the Parliament; which best knew what in∣dulgence, and toleration, was necessary for the Peace and Quiet of the” Kingdom.</Q> But his Majesty could not be so rid of them; they de∣sired <NOTE PLACE="marg">And their pri∣vate discourses also with him.</NOTE> several private Audiences of him; which he never denied; <Q>wherein they told him, “the Book of Common-prayer had been long disconti∣nued in <HI>England,</HI> and the People having been disused to it, and many of them having never heard it in their lives, it would be much won∣der'd at, if his Majesty should, at his first landing in the Kingdom, revive the use of it in his own Chapel; whither all Persons would re∣sort; <MILESTONE N="40"/> and therefore they besought him, that he would not use it en∣tirely and formally, but have only some parts of it read, with mixture” of other good Prayers, which his Chaplains might use.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King told them with some warmth, “that whilst he gave Them <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty's Reply to them.</NOTE> liberty, he would not have his own taken from him: that he had all∣ways used that form of Service, which he thought the best in the world, and had never discontinued it in places where it was more dis∣liked than he hoped it was by Them: that when he came into <HI>England</HI> he would not severely inquire how it was used in other Churches, <MILESTONE N="50"/> though he doubted not, he should find it used in many; but he was” sure he would have no other used in his own Chapel.</Q> <Q>Then they be∣sought him with more importunity, “that the use of the Surplice might
<PB N="602" REF="6140"/>
be discontinued by his Chaplains, because the fight of it would give” great offence, and scandal to the People.</Q> <Q>They found the King as inexorable in that point as in the other; He told them plainly, “that he would not be restrain'd Himself, when he gave others so much li∣berty; that it had been allways held a decent habit in the Church, constantly practiced in <HI>England</HI> till these late ill times; that it had been still retain'd by him; and though he was bound for the present to tolerate much disorder and undecency in the exercise of God's Wor∣ship, he would never, in the least degree, by his own practice, dis∣countenance the good old Order of the Church, in which he had been” bred.</Q> Though they were very much unsatisfied with him, whom they <MILESTONE N="10"/> thought to have found more flexible, yet they ceased farther troubling him, in hope, and presumption, that they should find their importunity in <HI>England</HI> more effectual.</P>
<P>AFTER eight or ten days spent at the <HI>Hague</HI> in Triumphs and Festi∣vals, which could not have been more splendid if all the Monarchs of <HI>Europe</HI> had met there, and which were concluded with several rich Presents made to his Majesty, the King took his leave of the States, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King em∣barks for</HI> Eng∣land.</NOTE> with all the professions of Amity their Civilities deserv'd; and embark'd himself on the <HI>Royal Charles;</HI> which had been before call'd the <HI>Naseby,</HI> but had been new Christen'd the day before, as many others had been, <MILESTONE N="20"/> in the presence, and by the order of his Royal Highness the Admiral. Upon the four and twentieth day of <HI>May,</HI> the Fleet set sail; and, in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>And the Fleet sets sail</HI> May 24.</P>
<P><HI>The King ar∣rives and lands at Do∣ver</HI> May 26, <HI>and went to</HI> Canterbury <HI>that Night.</HI></P></NOTE> one continued thunder of Cannon, arriv'd near <HI>Dover</HI> so early on the six and twentieth, that his Majesty disembark'd; and being receiv'd by the General at the brink of the Sea (whom he met, and embraced, with great demonstrations of affection) he presently took Coach, and came that night to <HI>Canterbury;</HI> where he staid the next day, being <HI>Sunday;</HI> and went to his Devotions to the Cathedral, which he found very much dilapidated, and out of repair; yet the People seem'd glad to hear the Common-prayer again. Thither came very many of the Nobility, and <MILESTONE N="30"/> other Persons of Quality, to present themselves to the King; and there his Majesty assembled his Council; and swore the General of the Coun∣cil, and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Morrice,</HI> whom he there Knighted, and gave him the Signet, and swore him Secretary of State. That day his Majesty gave the Gar∣ter to the General, and likewise to the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> (who had been elected many years before) and sent it likewise by <HI>Garter,</HI> Herauld and King at Armes, to Admiral <HI>Moun∣tague,</HI> who remain'd in the <HI>Downs.</HI></P>
<P>ON <HI>Monday</HI> He went to <HI>Rochester;</HI> and the next day, being the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 29 <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame through the City to</HI> White-Hall.</NOTE> nine and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> and his Birth-day, he enter'd <HI>London;</HI> all <MILESTONE N="40"/> the ways thither being so full of People, and Acclamations, as if the whole Kingdom had been gather'd there. Between <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>South∣wark</HI> the Lord Mayor and Aldermen met him, with all such Pro∣testations of joy as can hardly be imagin'd. The Concourse was so great, that the King rode in a croud from the Bridge to <HI>White-Hall;</HI> all the Companies of the City standing in order on both sides, and giving loud thanks to God for his Majesty's presence. He no sooner came to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> but the two Houses of Parliament solemnly cast themselves at his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the two Houses waited on him.</NOTE> Feet, with all vows of affection and fidelity to the world's end. <Q>In a <MILESTONE N="50"/> word, the Joy was so unexpressible, and so universal, that his Majesty said smilingly to some about him, “he doubted it had been his own fault he had been absent so long; for he saw no body that did not pro∣test,” he had ever wished for his Return.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="603" REF="6150"/>
IN this wonderful manner, and with this incredible expedition, did <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conclu∣sion <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the whole History.</NOTE> God put an end to a Rebellion that had raged near twenty Years, and been carried on with all the horrid circumstances of Murther, Devasta∣tion, and Parricide, that fire and sword, in the hands of the most wicked Men in the world, could be Instruments of; almost to the desolation of two Kingdoms, and the exceeding defacing and deforming the third.</P>
<P>IT was but five Months, since <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Fanatical Army was scat∣ter'd and confounded, and General <HI>Monk</HI>'s march'd into <HI>England:</HI> it was but three Months, since the secluded Members were restored; and, shortly after, the monstrous long Parliament finally dissolv'd, and rooted <MILESTONE N="10"/> up: it was but a Month, since the King's Letters and Declaration were deliver'd to the New Parliament, afterwards call'd the <HI>Convention:</HI> on the first of <HI>May</HI> they were deliver'd, and his Majesty was at <HI>White-Hall</HI> on the 29<SUP>th</SUP> of the same Month.</P>
<P>BY these remarkable Steps, among others, did the merciful hand of God, in this short space of time, not only bind up and heal all those wounds, but even make the Scars as undiscernable, as, in respect of the deepness, was possible; which was a glorious addition to the Deliverance. And, after this miraculous Restoration of the Crown, and the Church, and the just Rights of Parliaments, no Nation under Heaven can ever <MILESTONE N="20"/> be more happy, if God shall be pleased to add Establishment and Per∣petuity to the Blessings he then Restored.</P>
