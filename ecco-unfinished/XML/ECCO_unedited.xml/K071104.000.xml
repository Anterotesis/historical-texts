<HEAD>TO THE Very EXCELLENT and REVEREND Mess. G. W. J. W. W. R. and M. M.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are no persons in <HI>Bri∣tain</HI> so worthy of a dedica∣tion of a work of this kind as your∣selves. Some of you have preached for many years to the members of the congregation that these sermons are designed for;—and all of you, as far as your influence can reach, wish well to asses.</P>
<P>If I have offended your excellen∣cies by encroaching upon your em∣ployment, it is fit I should beg your pardon, or make some apology.—
<PB N="ii" REF="6"/>But as I once heard one of your∣selves say, in a sermon, that there were plenty of work for you, and many more in that way, I hope you will not be offended at receiv∣ing a little assistance from one who means well to your congregations.— Hoping you will recommend these sermons to your numerous acquain∣tances and friends.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, <HI>Your most humble servant,</HI> The Author.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1>

<PB REF="7"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is usual for preachers when they pub∣lish sermons to assign reasons why they do so.—The desire of friends,—and the re∣quest of better judges, are often given for reasons of publication. The author of these sermons does not pretend to any of these rea∣sons; yet he conceives he has sufficient rea∣sons for printing his sermons.—The audience to whom he intends to be useful, is far too large for any human voice to extend to them all;—and as he could not speak to them all, so as to <HI>make them hear,</HI> he made choice of this method to communicate his Thoughts.</P>
<P>When a person is disposed to preach a ser∣mon or two for the edification of any of God's creatures, he is under great difficulties to find a proper subject to discourse upon. Almost e∣very character has been described in some ser∣mon or lecture.—And there is not a power of the mind, nor a member of the body, but has been preached and lectured thread-bare. —There are new sermons to young men, and
<PB N="iv" REF="8"/>sermons to young Women, lectures on heads, and lectures on hearts. Almost every subject is exhausted and sermonized to death.</P>
<P>The author does not remember to have seen any sermons upon the subject he has made choice of, nor heard any preached pro∣fessedly to his audience. The Reverend Mess. <HI>G. W. J. W. W. R.</HI> and <HI>M. M.</HI> will perhaps be offended at the author, for interfering in their employment, and preaching to their congregations—But this much the author may say for himself, that he has not preached after their manner;—and to make them some satis∣faction, has given them the honour of a dedi∣cation.</P>
<P>Every preacher has a right to preach as he pleaseth to such as are disposed to hear him, and in what manner he has a mind for the ends of edification: and if he cannot be so happy as to please his audience, he should take care not to displease himself.</P>
<P>Sermons to asses may appear strange to such as have lately read sermons to young women.
<PB N="v" REF="9"/>—But they ought to consider, that something is even due to asses. We read of the ass-kind preaching to mankind,—and why may not men preach to asses?</P>
<P>Some grave persons in black will perhaps say this is an insult upon mankind, and a reflection upon gentlemen in holy orders.—The author can only say he has followed the example of the Patriarch <HI>Jacob,</HI> who preached to asses.</P>
<P>There is some reason to suspect that the preachers will censure these sermons, for want∣ing some things that ought to be in them;—and likely for not wanting some things they con∣tain.—But as there is no perfection in this life, the reader must take them as they are. There should have been two volumes of them, for the sake of form, as this has become the cus∣tomary way of publishing.—But it was thought convenient to postpone one till such time as it should appear how the first was received. These sermons should have been dedicated to the A— b—s, B—s, and their C—y, in hopes that they would have recommended them to public no∣tice;—but the author was afraid of offend∣ing
<PB N="vi" REF="10"/>their modesty with the flattery of a dedi∣cation, and for that reason altered his design.</P>
<P>The author has deferred setting his name to these discourses till the twentieth edition, when he may perhaps find D. D. to fix to them, like other authors.</P>
<P>If the clergy or others think it improper to preach to asses, the author may perhaps publish sermons to Doctors in Divinity, where he shall have more regard to method, and the rules of composing sermons. Every preacher ought to consider the qualifications of his au∣dience, and preach accordingly. Tho' there may be some things that may seem a little lu∣dicrous in these sermons,—the reader will find also some serious things deserving his notice. Thus much the preacher can say for himself, that he was very well pleased when he preached them, and had not the least ill will at any of the human race.—This is at least a negative qualification which some preachers are not en∣dowed with. Endowed with said I, they can∣not be endowed with what is negative. Call it any thing you please, for I have done.</P>

<HEAD>SERMONS TO ASSES.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>GEN. xlix. 14.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Issachar is a strong Ass, couching down between two Burdens.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Language of the Old Tes∣tament is peculiarly suited for drawing characters in few words. It is usual in the Hebrew lan∣guage, to draw the image of a multi∣tude in a single character. We find it very usual by the figure of a beast
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>to point out the image of a people;— and there is always some resemblance between the sign and the thing signi∣fied. It is needless to go far for ex∣amples, —there is one in the text,— <HI>Issachar</HI> is a strong ass, &amp;c. Truly he had much need of strength, for he has two burdens.</P>
<P>The tribe of <HI>Issachar</HI> were an in∣active, slothful, and sluggish people:— they loved rest more than liberty, and chose to be slaves, rather than exert themselves, and assert their privileges. There was a reason for it,—he saw that the land was good, and rest plea∣sant for him;—agreeable to his sloth∣ful and sluggish disposition. Self-interest prevailed more with him than public welfare and national happiness. There are many such asses as <HI>Issachar,</HI> that prefer present ease and advantage to
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>public liberty and national freedom. Our text is a prophecy in the present tense, which is usual in Hebrew writings. Ja∣cob in his last words foretels the cha∣cacter of the tribe of <HI>Issachar.</HI> I need not tell my readers any more concern∣ing the object of this prediction, than that it respected a whole tribe of the children of Israel. It was too well ve∣rified in their after behaviour.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob,</HI> I think, is the first mentioned in scripture that preached to asses, but many have been thus employed since his time. This is a shameful monosyl∣lable, when applied to reasonable crea∣tures.—Men endowed with reason and understanding to degenerate so basely. What a falling off is here? <HI>Issachar</HI> was a pretty numerous tribe, fifty-four thousand and four hundred;—far too many to be so mean spirited. They
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>wanted not strength, but spirit: many good gifts are ill bestowed. Strength without activity but debases human na∣ture. A nation of slaves is a kingdom of asses. It is dishonourable rest and disgraceful pleasure that is established upon the ruin of common weal. Rest is good, but liberty is better. What. was I saying?—Rest without liberty is bondage and slavery.</P>
<P>What can these burdens mean that <HI>Issachar</HI> couched down so decently un∣der? They were perhaps civil and re∣ligious slavery. Strange! that such a number of rational creatures should so tamely bear such two insupportable bur∣dens.—I had almost forgot that they were asses:—no people of any spirit could endure such grievous bondage without complaining. But who need wonder at <HI>Issachar</HI>'s mean spirited con∣dition?
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>All Europe,—yea the greatest part of the world have couched down between these two burdens of civil and religious oppression.</P>
<P>The Jews in the days of Jesus Christ were become a sort of tame asses;—they couched down till the Priests laid on their burden on the one side, and the Romans laid on their's on the other. This is at best a slovenly character: I wish it were gone out of the world. In scripture an ass is contrasted with a horse, which is a generous animal;— It is tractable, but not abject. Obedi∣ence to just laws, and subjection to sla∣very are two very different things: the first characterises a people wise and good, the latter base, mean spirited and ser∣vile.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
<P>It is understanding that makes men good subjects, but ignorance makes them slaves. If men through ignorance de∣generate to asses, they will always find some ready to six a burden upon them. Perhaps I shall give offence by repeat∣ing this disagreeable epithet: I shall lay it aside, and instead of the sign pur∣sue the thing signified.</P>
<P>The original word signifies an ass of bone, which denotes strength, but im∣plies leanness. Truly all slaves are ge∣nerally speaking lean;—all who have not the enjoyment of liberty are poor, both in a political and moral sense. There is not a word of <HI>Issachar</HI>'s mo∣tion in the text: he seems to have been strong, but not swift; — like all people under slavery, not sit for busi∣ness. He loved rest and ease, and could
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>not be rich. It is the hand of the diligent, not the strong, that maketh rich.—There is never a brisk trade but among a free people; for altho' slaves may be able to work for riches, yet they know not how to use them. Wealth does not consist in Specie, but a right circulation: slaves are indiffe∣rent how it is. They have not a true sense of property, nor just notions of right, and therefore want the springs of action, which only can keep reasona∣ble creatures in true motion.</P>
<P>It is wonderful what custom will do. It is called a second nature, and justly: through long use and habit men will stoop to take on their own burdens. <HI>Issachar</HI> stooped down,— well did he deserve a heavy burden for his mean∣ness of spirit. It is soon enough to submit to bondage when we cannot help
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>it. Slavery is a just reward to such as voluntarily give up their natural rights and privileges: such as do not value freedom and liberty deserve to be slaves. It is finding fault with the conduct of the Almighty to give up his prero∣gative to his creatures.—Such as volun∣tarily give up their rights and privi∣leges given them by their maker, and submit to any human yoke, are next to atheists. Men are not at liberty to give up their trust till providence re∣quire it. Our first parents ruined them∣selves by submitting to a new master. When men are conquered, and forced to submit, it is no crime, but a call of providence; but when for private in∣terest they give up the public wel∣fare, they shew themselves unworthy of the protection of heaven, by reject∣ing its government.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="19"/>
<P>Time was when there were many of <HI>Issachar</HI>'s character in these our native lands.—But thanks to heaven that ge∣neration is well nigh dead. About a century ago vast numbers of British subjects were couching down between two burdens of civil and religious op∣pression. The far greatest part of the inhabitants of Britain were loaden, and prest down with these two heavy bur∣dens.</P>
<P>It is amazing to think how creatures of the same frame and constitution, en∣dowed with the same powers and capa∣cities, should become so submissively the slaves of others. We are all naturally free, our sphere in society may require subordination of individuals, but cannot oblige men to part with their natural rights; obedience must be an act of
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>the will. In a land of slavery, where Princes are arbitrary, and Kings have absolute power, there is but one public will in a whole nation, — at least it is a mere chance if many agree with the legislator. The prince is mightily de∣ceived if he thinks the subjects obey him, for there is no true obedience, but what proceeds from the heart. <HI>Is∣sachar</HI>'s burden is hinted at in the fol∣following verse; <HI>He became a servant to tribute.</HI> He was made a subject to civil oppression. It did not happen all at once. The mind will remonstrate against bondage till the passions sooth her asleep; it is a work of time to make men perfect slaves, and it is or∣dinarily some leading passion, or two, that make them so. Love of ease and love of pleasure have brought many thousands into slavery.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="21"/>
<P>When all the passions are engaged in pursuing their various and proper ob∣jects, according as nature directs and requires, it will be a miracle if men do not jostle themselves clear of their bur∣dens. Nations that do not look far∣ther than their own boundaries, and their original district, will in time turn slaves.—And suppose they should go abroad, to pursue trade and business, unless it be with a design to bring some∣thing home, they will remain the same people. There have been many that have made emigrations yet have carried slavery along with them. Those who look abroad for trade, to bring home riches to their native country, will most likely pursue the ends of the true liberty.— They go not to other countries to take possession of their lands, but to bring home their riches by fair trade and bu∣siness.
<PB N="12" REF="22"/>Such as have a sense of some property in their own country will seek the welfare of it at home or abroad;— and when they by diligence and indus∣try make their fortunes, they will en∣deavour to bring it home to add to the public interest.</P>
<P>These two burdens, civil and reli∣gious oppression, hold all nations in bondage where they prevail;—these are laid on by the power of Princes, and the power of Priests. In some nations the Prince and the Clergy act in con∣cert to fix the burden upon the peo∣ple: slavery there seems one connected load of bondage. <HI>Mahumedism</HI> seems a burden of this sort. Religion among the <HI>Mahumedans</HI> is an engine of state policy.—However, this burden seems to be compounded of two parts; idolatry, and civil oppression: no man can say he has
<PB N="13" REF="23"/>any property. In Popish countries the case is much the same; there is only this difference, the Magistrate lays on the one burden, and the Priests lay on the other, and they may properly be said to be two, because they re∣spect two different policies;—the Ma∣gistrate has also a burden laid upon him by the Priests by church authority.</P>
<P>In case the King should not be <HI>so tractable as they would require,</HI> they were wont to have a method to <HI>make</HI> him bear his burden patiently. They used him as <HI>Balaam</HI> did his ass; bela∣boured him with church censures, and threatened him with deprivation. But of later times Princes have become so obstinate, that they have bruised the Pope's foot against the wall, and al∣most kicked him off; for he had al∣ways the assurance when he laid on a
<PB N="14" REF="24"/>burden to get upon the top of it.— Soon may all the Kings of Europe see their own interest, and totally reject his authority. The common people are notwithstanding still oppressed with two burdens. The Prince lays upon them a burden of taxes at his pleasure, and the <HI>Clergy</HI> fix another to make it bal∣lance fairly.—And they are so much of <HI>Issachar</HI>'s character, that they volunta∣rily stoop and take on their burdens.</P>
<P>In the burden of civil oppression is contained so much as the Prince hath need of for all the purposes of his pride and ambition:—and if it be the same in all countries where arbitrary government prevails, this burden will comprehend <HI>item</HI> for all things that a man possesseth. This was once the burden of Britain, during the unhappy reign of the Stuarts: it contained in it
<PB N="15" REF="25"/>several articles, such as tonnage and poundage, licence to dress meat, patent for soap, cards and dice, and pins, &amp;c. This burden was fixed upon the sub∣jects by the royal prerogative: it was encreased and alleviated according to his <HI>majesty's gracious pleasure.</HI> This was a very grievous burden, for it extended to all the necessaries of life. A chris∣tian could not call his head his own, without paying for it, nor durst any subject suffer the smoke of his chimney to ascend towards heaven, without pay∣ing a modus to the King for that pri∣vilege. The King of Britain was then the <HI>prince of the power of the air,</HI> as well as King of Britain and Ireland. If all nations where the Prince is arbitrary have such a burden imposed upon them, they had need of much strength and patience.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="26"/>
<P>In those nations where Popery pre∣vails, there is a burden of religious sla∣very laid upon the people by the Priests: —this consists of <HI>item</HI> for all things in heaven and earth,—together with a se∣vere restraint upon the consciences of men, not to think or act contrary to the judgment of the church. This bur∣den contains several parcels of very pon∣derous goods: such as the <HI>canons</HI> of the church, the <HI>decrees of councils,</HI> the infallibility of the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome:</HI> all these, men must receive, however ab∣surd they may appear to them, upon the pain of purgatory, or hell-torments for ever. In a word, every man in that communion must believe almost e∣very thing but the scriptures, which are indeed intirely excluded from this heavy burden.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="27"/>
<P>In case any who have these burdens laid upon them prove any way refrac∣tory or perverse, they are put in mind of their duty by very powerful argu∣ments. The holy <HI>office</HI> of the <HI>inqui∣sition</HI> have several <HI>spurs</HI> for such per∣verse <HI>asses</HI> as will not bear their bur∣dens with patience. They may kick and spurn as they will, but they may as well think of bringing <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> as think to get clear of their burdens. As in <HI>England</HI> there are schools for training <HI>horses</HI> to learn them their exercise, so they have schools for training such <HI>asses</HI> as they conceive do not bear their burdens with pati∣ence: dungeons, where neither light or sunshine ever enter; the very picture of the mansions of the dead,—tortures which furies in council only could contrive, are here the sad monitors
<PB N="18" REF="28"/>of obedience to miserable mortals. Strange that nothing else could be contrived to convince the consciences of men, but what is fit for the most stubborn and sluggish of animals! Can bodily torture convince the mind? Can hunger and pain give evidence to <HI>ab∣surdity,</HI> and confinement reconcile <HI>con∣tradictions?</HI> Kind Jesus, this was never thy contrivance; whose law is love, whose conduct is all mercy. How can kingdoms bear such a yoke? How can millions of reasonable creatures submit to such unreasonable slavery? It must have cost much time and pains thus to have deprived men of their sense and reason. The human mind must be ca∣ble of sad depravity, to submit to such <HI>abject</HI> bondage and slavery. Can it be natural to men thus to degenerate into a state of brutal stupifaction? So many millions of rational beings, en∣dowed
<PB N="19" REF="29"/>with moral capacities, having all the full exercise of the corporeal func∣tions, to submit to be treated like <HI>brutes;</HI> what a shocking consideration! Could not these nations free themselves, by making use of those powers the author of nature hath endowed them with?—They have lost their guide, and are destitute of a leader.—Reason, that guide of mankind, is enslaved, and held captive by enthu∣siasm and servile superstition.—But is there not some original cause why men degenerate so far below themselves? Can perfect nature relapse so far into barbarity? If all the principles are pure, what is the reason of such a de∣parture from rationality? There is a cause; <HI>reason is duped by the passions;</HI> —those who have address enough to command the <HI>one,</HI> will also overcome the <HI>other:</HI>—when men's eyes are <HI>put out,</HI> they <HI>grope</HI> in the <HI>dark.</HI> Heaven
<PB N="20" REF="30"/>send the light of the <HI>gospel</HI> to <HI>open</HI> the eyes of such <HI>blinded</HI> mortals, that they may <HI>see</HI> their own interest, and <HI>assert</HI> their own privileges. What can induce men in <HI>sacred offices</HI> thus to play the devil with their fellow-creatures? Interest, sordid self-interest, is the cause. Long hath this principle been the ruling one in the hearts of the clergy of the church of <HI>Rome:</HI> in∣stead of pointing out the way of righ∣teousness to men, and teaching them the way of salvation, they have long treated them like <HI>asses,</HI> and kept them in ignorance. Who gave them that right? Are not all men equally free? <HI>Hath not God made of one blood all the kindreds of the earth?</HI>—But thought∣less mortals give up their privileges through indolence and inactivity. What can men do without instruction? We are all infants before we be men;—
<PB N="21" REF="31"/>instruction is necessary to make us wise. Suffer men to follow the first bent of their inclinations, and it will be a mi∣racle if they do well.—But nature is not suffered to take her own way,— for if there be none to instruct us, there will be hundreds ready to seduce us: bad as men are, they would not be so ill if they were not seduced. Shall parents neglect to instruct us in the rudiments of true wisdom, and not provide tutors to conduct us in the paths of knowledge, the world and de∣signing men will not neglect to make their own of us, to the ruin of both soul and body.</P>
<P>Where men are no sooner out of the hands of their nurses than they fall into the hands of <HI>priests,</HI> whose leading maxim is, that <HI>ignorance</HI> is the <HI>mother</HI> of devotion, how can they un∣derstand
<PB N="22" REF="32"/>their own interest? The first who gave up their privileges, by neglecting to follow after true know∣ledge, justly <HI>deserved</HI> to <HI>bear</HI> a heavy burden;—but what shall be said of their unfortunate children, who through their negligence and inactivity are trained up in ignorance, and know not how to de∣liver themselves? Could not the dic∣tates of nature have directed them o∣therwise? Could not the law of the heart have admonished them against such absurd seduction? Alas! men are capable of being instructed, but cannot learn without teaching. But how shall we vindicate the conduct of providence towards the many thousands of them that sit in darkness? Why should chil∣dren suffer for the iniquity of their Fathers? Could not the Almighty have sent them the means of knowledge, as
<PB N="23" REF="33"/>a compensation for their fathers defici∣ency? He could, no doubt.</P>
<P>But what if we shall affirm, that this judgment upon several generations of misled and wretched mortals has been suffered to continue, because they a∣bused the dictates of common sense? We read of a people that loved to be seduced; <HI>The prophets prophecy for a reward, and the people love to have it so.</HI> Justly do they deserve slavery who chuse it.</P>
<P>When men are instructed in princi∣ples of <HI>true</HI> or <HI>false</HI> knowledge, it must be by either the <HI>use</HI> or <HI>abuse</HI> of their <HI>senses:</HI> false teachers cannot even lead men wrong, without in some measure dealing with their <HI>sensations. Sensation</HI> is naturally ingrafted in our nature; our feelings are the workmanship of
<PB N="24" REF="34"/>our <HI>Creator.</HI> In matters of speculation it may be easy to lead us astray, and as to what things are not the objects of our senses, it may not be difficult to impose upon us; but to believe ab∣surdity, in matters our senses are judges of, must be chusing our own delusions. Suppose through our ignorance of <HI>tes∣timony</HI> men may mislead us, yet in what comes under the notice of our senses, they cannot, unless we please. The senses of the <HI>clown</HI> are generally as quick as those of the <HI>philosopher,</HI> and it requires no more but to use them, as to those things that are their <HI>ob∣jects,</HI> to keep clear of seduction. Tho' every man is not able to judge of the orthodoxy of a <HI>creed,</HI> and the truth of the <HI>canons</HI> of the <HI>church,</HI> yet they are able, by the exercise of their senses, to know that <HI>bread</HI> is not <HI>flesh,</HI> nor <HI>wine blood;</HI>—and that the same <HI>body</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="35"/>cannot be in a thousand places at the same time. When men thus depart from <HI>common sense,</HI> which their maker has endowed them with, it is but just to deprive them of other advantages, which there is a likelihood they would give up through indolence, as they do their senses. The Almighty knows what use men would make of better enjoyments, and when he tries them with common mercies, which they abuse, he vindicates his providence in with-hold∣ing others of higher value, as a pu∣nishment of their crime for abusing what he hath bestowed.—<HI>He that is faithful in little will be faithful also in that which is greater.</HI></P>
<P>Such as are endowed with <HI>common sense,</HI> and depart from it, or give it up, but ill deserve to be entrusted with the <HI>sublimest</HI> truths of <HI>religion.</HI>—What!
<PB N="26" REF="36"/><HI>common sense</HI> is the <HI>foundation</HI> of <HI>reli∣gion.</HI> Such as depart from, or are de∣stitute of it, could not really be truly religious. When we consider the si∣tuation of many deluded nations and people, we cannot but pity them, but at the same time cannot hold them <HI>guiltless</HI> for giving up their senses. Such as have had the happiness of en∣joying better instruction than others who remain in ignorance, upon a little reflection may find they have nothing to boast of. The inhabitants of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> are not the only people who receive <HI>absurdities.</HI> In a land where freedom is the privilege, and boast of almost every subject, we may perhaps find, a tame enough submission to several <HI>absurdities.</HI></P>
<P>Not, you will say, in <HI>Britain,</HI> a land renowned for all sorts of liberty:—a
<PB N="27" REF="37"/>nation to which there is none equal upon the face of the earth, that we know of.—We have reason indeed to be thankful to the <HI>Almighty</HI> for the liberty we enjoy,—but <HI>Britain</HI> is only comparatively free. It matters not whe∣ther men become <HI>slaves</HI> or are made so, if they are really in bondage; <HI>Is∣sacher</HI> couched down and became a slave. To the charge of our <HI>Sovereign</HI> no∣thing can be laid, that tends to affect our <HI>liberties.</HI>—But perhaps there are yet something in our <HI>laws</HI> that fixes a <HI>burden</HI> upon several of the subjects. Is a man intirely free, who is subjected to losses and disappointments by the <HI>laws</HI> of his country, on account of his religion? Is he altogether a free sub∣ject, who is faithful to civil govern∣ment, and whose principles teach him to be so, and yet is deprived of some of its advantages on account of his me∣thod
<PB N="28" REF="38"/>of worshipping God? Is he free of a burden, who must either submit to a <HI>test act,</HI> contrary to the dictates of his own <HI>conscience,</HI> or lose a privilege that may redound to the welfare of his country?</P>
<P>It is easy for such as have enlarged consciences to call this no hardship, and such as love to make a <HI>monopoly</HI> of <HI>privileges</HI> to say he may let alone;— but where then is our much boasted-of <HI>liberty,</HI> when it only consists in nega∣tives of this kind? Even this is not always the case. Shall a good subject re∣fuse the calls of his <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Country</HI> in the time of danger, to help them out of difficulty? On the one hand he might be reckoned <HI>disaffected,</HI> and on the other he could not miss to be <HI>un∣conscientious.</HI> Here the laws of his coun∣try lay him under <HI>bondage,</HI> and bring
<PB N="29" REF="39"/>him into a grievous dilemma. A <HI>bur∣den</HI> this is <HI>undoubtedly,</HI> however light it may seem to such as are not imme∣diately concerned. Can such slavery be necessary to make faithful subjects, and good members of society? Or do not such restrictions tend to fill places of power and influence with men of no principle? Strange that men cannot be supposed <HI>faithful, just,</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> unless they kneel down before an altar, and communicate in a way their consciences remonstrate against. Is not this some∣thing like laying a snare for our bre∣thren? There is certainly no reason to suspect the <HI>loyalty</HI> of all those who scruple to communicate with the <HI>church of England,</HI>—nor is such a compliance any evidence of a true member of so∣ciety, or a good subject.—There is even reason to suppose, that persons who have been otherwise educated, do
<PB N="30" REF="40"/>not act sincerely in such a compliance:— at least it is a great snare to their ho∣nesty. Can the kingdom of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> be so dependent upon the kingdoms of this world, as that it cannot subsist, if any be admitted to <HI>civil preferment</HI> without giving security for their be∣haviour towards <HI>it?</HI> In what part of the New Testament do we find this <HI>alliance</HI> between <HI>church</HI> and <HI>state</HI> found∣ed, so that a man cannot be found qua¦lified for any office in the one, without first becoming a member of the other? It is but reasonable to have some New Testament warrant for a matter of so great importance. Arguments taken from convenience, and the alteration of circumstances, will not bear any weight with a sincere conscience till once it is made good, that the alteration of the kingdoms of this world make a change in the <HI>kingdom</HI> of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<PB N="31" REF="41"/>
<P>It has been often affirmed, that our circumstances are much altered since the times of <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> which is an undoubted truth; but this does not, I hope, infer that the laws of <HI>Christ's kingdom</HI> have undergone any alteration. There have been many great alterations since the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of <HI>England</HI> was granted, and yet it is al∣lowed to be the foundation of our civil privileges, and continues unaltered.— And if it be true, what I have often heard, the constitution would be de∣stroyed if <HI>this</HI> was taken away. The <HI>New Testament</HI> is the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of the Church, which is the kingdom of <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> if once we make Incroach∣ments upon it, then the liberties of the <HI>church</HI> are at an end. In scripture account, adding or diminishing are e∣qually destructive of privilege. I think
<PB N="32" REF="42"/>before any additions are made to the <HI>laws</HI> and <HI>rules Jesus Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles</HI> have given to the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="7 letters" DISP="〈7 letters〉"/> church, they should be proved <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> defective and insufficient:—and before any thing is taken from these laws, they ought to be made appear to be redundant. If either of these can be made evident, the divinity of the scrip∣ture will be at an end, and there will be no <HI>gospel church</HI> at all. There has been of late times much noise about the increase and spreading of <HI>infidelity,</HI> and none have made more noise con∣cerning it than those who have been the cause of it. When <HI>fathers</HI> in <HI>coun∣cils,</HI> and <HI>bishops</HI> in <HI>convocation,</HI> have made so free with the scriptures, as to add to the worship of God, so many <HI>decent things,</HI> that never were appointed by <HI>Christ</HI> or his <HI>Apostles</HI> in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> and at the same time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tempt
<PB N="33" REF="43"/>to prove the necessity of these additaments;—the inference from this is very easy, and plain, that the scrip∣tures are not perfect in things belong∣ing to christian duty. If once men begin to add any <HI>one thing,</HI> that is not specified in the <HI>word</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> who can tell where the end may be? Hath the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God</HI> been so exact in all things pertaining to <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>practice</HI> among christians, and yet been deficient as to what is <HI>decent</HI> and <HI>comely</HI> in the worship of God and the ceremonies of the church? What a severe reflection is this upon the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of the <HI>Most High?</HI> What rude and unpolished mortals have the Apostles of Jesus Christ been, to have no rules of decency in their worship of the <HI>Almighty?</HI> Strange that they should have been so exact in all other matters of importance pertain∣ing to the <HI>church</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and so much
<PB N="34" REF="44"/>desicient in comely <HI>order</HI> and <HI>decency?</HI> Though they were illiterate fishermen, and not bred like our <HI>modern clergy,</HI> yet the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> that inspired them certainly knew what was <HI>decent</HI> and <HI>or∣derly;</HI>—at least he knew better what would please God, than all the <HI>councils</HI> and <HI>convocations</HI> that ever existed.</P>
<P>It is no hard matter to account for the growth of infidelity. When those who have assumed sacred functions, have made free to <HI>alter</HI> and <HI>add</HI> at their pleasure, in things pertaining to religion. What could such as were enquiring and not yet settled in their principles, infer, but that there was nothing cer∣tain in divine revelation? Is it not to use men like asses, to tell them they have a compleat <HI>revelation</HI> of the <HI>will of God</HI> in the scriptures, and yet im∣pose many things upon them that are
<PB N="35" REF="45"/>not mentioned therein? To say that the word of God is plain and per∣fect in all things pertaining to godli∣ness, and yet alledge, that it cannot sufficiently direct us into <HI>truth,</HI> and guard us against <HI>error,</HI> unless it is set forth by so many Divines, in <HI>thirty-nine</HI> articles, or <HI>thirty-three chapters,</HI> sounds something like a contradiction. Much need have men to be <HI>strong in faith,</HI> that are thus required to believe without evidence? <HI>Rome</HI> hath gone far in the practice of absurdities, but she never required any other foundation but <HI>implicit faith</HI> to build them upon: what is not manifestly evident from the word of God to every man that is re∣quired to give his assent, can never be an article of his <HI>faith:</HI> he may be so complaisant as to believe as the church doth, in his words, and <HI>public confes∣sion,</HI> but is an infidel at heart notwith∣standing.
<PB N="36" REF="46"/>But why should men be led into temptation, thus to prevaricate be∣fore God? Were there open access to <HI>church offices</HI> and <HI>preferments,</HI> to such as professed to believe the <HI>scriptures,</HI> and were found qualified, some might still be <HI>infidels,</HI> but the church would have no hand in making them so;—and there is the greatest reason to believe, that infidelity could never be built upon the doctrine of the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apostles,</HI> where <HI>Jesus Christ is the chief corner stone.</HI> The purity of the <HI>sacred oracles,</HI> when immediately presented to the conscience, is more likely to prevent <HI>prevarication,</HI> than these compositions, where there is some reason <HI>to doubt</HI> there may be <HI>some mistake.</HI></P>
<P>So long as the pure oracles of God were the only creed of the church, we find her members more <HI>simple</HI> and
<PB N="37" REF="47"/><HI>sincere,</HI> than ever they have been since: but as soon as the doctrine of <HI>Revela∣tion</HI> began to be cloathed in a human dress, it did not strike the mind with such <HI>reverence</HI> and <HI>godly fear:</HI> after∣wards men made more free with sin, and began to find <HI>church authority</HI> for committing it.—Till at last they could produce <HI>indulgences</HI> for almost any kind of <HI>wickedness.</HI> What influence could articles of religion framed by such men have, who, when they were forming <HI>canons</HI> for the <HI>church,</HI> were forming also <HI>licences</HI> for all kinds of <HI>immora∣lity?</HI> Even in <HI>England,</HI> it is not dif∣ficult to find the same authority that authorized the <HI>book of Canons,</HI> autho∣rising the <HI>book of Sports,</HI> whereby a licence was given for any who pleased to profane the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> to the dishonour of all religion whatsoever. Could any person who had the least
<PB N="38" REF="48"/>consideration reconcile two things abso∣lutely contrary to each other, viz. <HI>Ar∣ticles of religion,</HI> and a <HI>licence</HI> to break them, in their constant Practice?</P>
<P>It would have been next to a mi∣racle if infidelity had not gained ground, when it received such strength and sup∣port from the <HI>leaders in religion. Out of the same mouths</HI> could not consist∣ently <HI>come both blessing and cursing; laws</HI> for <HI>religion,</HI> and a <HI>licence</HI> for <HI>im∣piety.</HI> Can any people be accounted of any other character but that of <HI>Is∣sachar</HI> in the text, who suffer such religious <HI>slavery</HI> and <HI>absurdity</HI> to be im∣posed upon them? Is the word of God imperfect, that it cannot direct men in all matters of religion, without it be clothed with <HI>human inventions,</HI> and the <HI>authority of the church?</HI> He is a chris∣tian that submits to the yoke of <HI>Christ,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="49"/>but a <HI>slave</HI> that takes on any other. Shall men pretend to impose any other burdens than the easy and light bur∣den Christ hath required, let us be <HI>christians,</HI> and not <HI>slaves;</HI> not couch down like <HI>Issachar</HI> between <HI>two bur∣dens,</HI> but <HI>stand fast</HI> in that <HI>liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,</HI> and not suffer ourselves to be <HI>entangled in any yoke of bondage.</HI></P>
<P>To come to a conclusion. Let it be observed, when ever men are required to believe any thing upon human au∣thority in matters of religion, or to worship God in any other manner than they are plainly required in scripture, it is a burden of religious slavery, and not the yoke of <HI>Christ.</HI> They do not deserve the character of rational crea∣tures, to say nothing of the christian character, who tamely give up their
<PB N="40" REF="50"/><HI>reason,</HI> and their <HI>Bible,</HI> to the hands of religious oppressors. Well do they deserve to bear a burden of religious slavery, who do so tamely couch down and take it on. We shall soon have heavy enough burdens imposed upon us, if we so submissively couch down to them: if men but enjoy the exercise of <HI>common sense,</HI> they will never meanly give up their right of private judg∣ment to the will of oppressors. Ye, who, like <HI>Issachar,</HI> for the <HI>love</HI> of <HI>ease,</HI> or the <HI>love</HI> of <HI>pleasure,</HI> or for the <HI>gratification</HI> of some <HI>sordid pas∣sion,</HI> submit to burdens, as unnatural as they are unreasonable; be not of∣fended if your character be drawn after the manner of that of his. <HI>Asses,</HI> and worse than <HI>asses,</HI> surely you are, who either give up the cause of your <HI>coun∣try,</HI> or the rights of your own <HI>con∣sciences</HI> to civil or religious <HI>deminators.</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="51"/>The character of NAPTHALI, how dif∣ferent from that of his brother? <HI>Nap∣thali is a hind let loose;</HI> an assertor of liberty. <HI>Issachar is a strong ass, couching down between two burdens.</HI> God give all men the knowledge of their privileges, and a spirit of true zeal to maintain them. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>There are many burdens fixed upon us by the stupidity of former genera∣tions, that even these who would, cannot so easily get clear of them, in our times. Heaven grant help to such as are forced to any piece of slavery against their in∣clination, and speedily give them deliver∣ance. We live under a government where grievances will be considered, if <HI>faith∣fully represented,</HI> and it is surely our own fault if we bear burdens. The burden is often <HI>heavy,</HI> and the cry <HI>loud,</HI> but proper means of redress are seldom pursued. It is to be feared we are not yet prepared for deliverance, for we do not apply for it earnestly,
<PB N="46" REF="55"/>nor make use of <HI>proper means:</HI> we groan like <HI>asses,</HI> but do not bestir our∣selves.</P>
<P>I shall consider some grievous bur∣dens that several of this free nation bear, which are very unreasonable, and consider a method to have them re∣moved.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a burden of <HI>taxes</HI> upon the poor, which they are not able to bear. It needs no proof, for it is suf∣ficiently felt, that many of the neces∣saries of life pay very heavy duties. It may be, for any thing I know, necessary for the paying of <HI>public ex∣pences,</HI> that the subjects are so bur∣dened; but there ought certainly some regard to be had to the strength of the <HI>beasts of burden.</HI> All <HI>asses</HI> are not equally strong.—They should be bur∣dened
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>according to their strength and abilities. Meat, drink, and clothing should be made as easy as possible; things without which we cannot live, ought to be gently taxed. The poor cannot well live with less necessary food than the rich, neither can they go na∣ked. There must be some reasons why they do not enjoy the necessaries of life according to their needs. The very shoes of their feet are taxed. They enjoy no light but what pays duty to the government. I may be mistaken, for perhaps they pay for their <HI>windows</HI> and <HI>candles,</HI> but not for the light of them.—But the window, the candle, and the light are so nearly related, that in many cases we cannot well separate them. But whatever may be the <HI>theory</HI> of these things, there are none but feel them in <HI>practice.</HI> There are several things which might
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>bear duty better than these by which the poor live. Let all the superfluities of life pay—but why oppress the poor? Even <HI>asses</HI> deserve pity—<HI>a merciful man is merciful towards his beast.</HI> There is no reasoning against power, where there is no laws to restrain it; but as we have laws securing our privileges, why should any subjects be oppressed? We may certainly complain with safety, even suppose we should not immedi∣ately receive redress. One would rea∣dily suppose that there should be some proportion between the burdens laid upon the poor, and the dearness of the necessary provisions, and the quan∣tity of current specie:—one of these should certainly take place, either to have <HI>taxes lessened, provisions cheaper,</HI> or money more plenty. As to the <HI>theory</HI> of these matters, or how they may be balanced in the <HI>oeconomy of a
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>prime minister,</HI> that is not my province to say; but I think every subject may say when he is <HI>oppressed,</HI> he is not <HI>free.</HI> Even when men are doing their ut∣most endeavours to serve their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> it is hard they should not be able to live, when the quantity of provisions in the kingdom are far from being scarce. When demands are made upon the lower part of mankind for the ordinary rate of duty imposed up∣on them by the <HI>government,</HI> they are obliged to pay, or be distressed; but cannot either raise their wages, or lower the prices of provisions. If they complain, they are not heard; if they resist, they are belaboured like <HI>asses;</HI> or if through <HI>hunger</HI> and <HI>want</HI> they should be compelled to rise up to re∣lieve themselves, then they must wait the issue of a trial in some <HI>court of justice,</HI> where the consequences are very
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>visibly represented in <HI>some late cases.</HI>— Merciful Lord, would any people rise in mobs to disturb a peaceable nation if they could help it, who have been so ready in time of war to venture their lives for its safety! Nay, it is <HI>pinching hunger</HI> that is the cause of it. Some few there may be that may join in riots without a cause; but the subjects of <HI>Britain</HI> love their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> too dearly to disturb their peace. Rea∣sonable duty all good subjects will be disposed to pay; but when the weight lies upon the poor, where is the <HI>rea∣sonableness</HI> of the <HI>tax?</HI> It is no re∣flection upon the King that the <HI>poor</HI> are oppressed, for he does not make the laws: the subjects oppress one ano∣ther.—They are like the <HI>fishes of the sea,</HI> the <HI>great</HI> devour the <HI>small;</HI>—only with this difference, that we are <HI>de∣voured by law.</HI></P>
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
<P>I have not mentioned the names and number of that <HI>burden</HI> of <HI>taxes</HI> with which we are oppressed, for they are well known. The very paper I am writing upon has not escaped the <HI>ex∣cise.</HI> This may perhaps be reasonable; for men may live without writing, but cannot without food and raiment. In several respects the poorer sort of the subjects are <HI>not free;</HI> they are obliged to <HI>couch down</HI> between <HI>two burdens:</HI> one of <HI>taxes,</HI> and another of <HI>artificial scarcity of provisions.</HI> We have this li∣berty above those nations where ar∣bitrary power prevails, we may utter our complaints, without danger, pro∣viding we make no rash attempts to case ourselves.</P>
<P>But for all this <HI>burden</HI> of <HI>taxes</HI> there is some shew of reason; <HI>government must
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>be supported, the debt of the nation must be paid off, pensioners must be maintain∣ed,</HI> and <HI>clerks dues must be discharged.</HI> All these things the <HI>valet de chambre</HI> of a <HI>minister of state</HI> know better than I can pretend to.—But there is,</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>burden</HI> which several of his majesty's subjects are made to <HI>couch down</HI> under, for which I can see no reason at all.—To pay for <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>wine</HI> they never <HI>taste,</HI> to entertain peo∣ple they have no concern with. This they say we are <HI>obliged</HI> to do by <HI>law,</HI> at least they threaten us with it, if we refuse to pay. If it be <HI>law,</HI> it is not <HI>justice</HI> to make persons pay for other people's <HI>provisions,</HI> when they are abundantly able to do it themselves. But why pay for the <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>wine</HI> made use of at <HI>Easter,</HI> and not also for every other month of the year? This
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>is perhaps for the whole.—It is far too much for those who do not make use of it.—But they may if they will; but why may they not if they will? Is there any <HI>compulsion</HI> in matters of religion, in a land of liberty?—But they are not <HI>compelled</HI> to <HI>eat</HI> and <HI>drink,</HI> but <HI>to pay.</HI> And where is the reason for that? If it was charity it would be due, but where is the righteous∣ness of the demand? I am afraid it sa∣vours of a <HI>law</HI> that was excogitated at <HI>Rome</HI> many hundred years ago. It is reasonable that every <HI>communicant pay;</HI> but why <HI>impose</HI> upon <HI>Dissenters?</HI>— Especially such as have no freehold. Must every housholder pay for what he never has any benefit by? This is surely such a <HI>burden</HI> as the <HI>scribes</HI> and <HI>pharisees</HI> laid in old times upon the common people.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
<P>What law of <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles</HI> is this founded upon? It should be founded some where in the New Tes∣tament, for it relates to religion. I should pay it for conscience sake, if they will shew me where its required in the <HI>gospel.</HI> It is surely neither <HI>de∣cent</HI> nor <HI>orderly</HI> to make a feast, and oblige every one to pay for it, whe∣ther they can <HI>in conscience</HI> do it or not. This is using men like <HI>asses</HI> with a witness. They ill deserve communion with their Saviour, that are not willing to bear the expence of the outward elements of that communion. Say that it is <HI>charity,</HI> or <HI>prove</HI> that it is <HI>scrip∣tural,</HI> and all good christians will pay it for <HI>conscience sake.</HI> It is but rea∣sonable they have some satisfaction for their money. Any people that were not past shame, would blush to demand a
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>thing for a religious use, they could not produce a warrant for from the word of God. <HI>The love of money is the root of all evil,</HI> and the passion for it prevails no where more than <HI>near the altar.</HI> Ah ye <HI>priests!</HI> ye make us pay for all things; ye catch us as soon as we come into the world, and ye never lose sight of us till we return to dust. Our mothers must pay you for bearing of us, our fathers for hav∣ing us baptized. When we are mar∣ried, and when we are buried, <HI>ye must be paid.</HI> When we come into the world, and when we go out of it, ye set a price upon our heads.—And did these two demands satisfy you we might forgive you; but as long as our heads are on our bodies, we must <HI>satisfy</HI> you every year for the <HI>use</HI> of <HI>them:</HI> we may truly say all our things are yours. You must taste of all our substance:
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>the tithe of all we have that is valuable, and suitable for you, is <HI>yours.</HI> You say <HI>tithes</HI> were appointed under the <HI>law</HI> for the <HI>tribe</HI> of <HI>Levi,</HI> and the sons of the <HI>priesthood:</HI> but remember, <HI>ye Le∣vites, Jesus Christ</HI> was not of your <HI>tribe:</HI> he belonged to a tribe that did not serve at the <HI>altar;</HI> and he did not institute any <HI>priests,</HI> nor give any laws concerning <HI>tithes.</HI> As we are christians you can have no just de∣mands upon us: let such as observe the <HI>jewish religion</HI> pay <HI>tithes,</HI> but what have we to do with the sons of <HI>Levi</HI> under the <HI>gospel.</HI> Gracious and merciful <HI>Sa∣viour,</HI> thou came to set christians free from bondage and slavery, and to give them deliverance from the <HI>law</HI> of <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI> but we are still laid under a load of slavery that has no foundation in <HI>thy gospel,</HI> but is fixed upon us by that law. Thy <HI>Apostles</HI> received no <HI>tithes,</HI> for
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>they were <HI>christians,</HI> and meek and humble like <HI>thee:</HI> they loved to set men free, but not to oppress them. They testified against the ceremonial law at the peril of their lives, and told christians that it did not profit;—and to such as observed it <HI>Christ did profit them nothing.</HI>—But circumstances are much altered since their time,—and we have reason to believe not at all for the <HI>better,</HI> but for the <HI>worse.</HI> It is a hard matter that christians are still ob∣liged to support a <HI>jewish priesthood</HI> un∣der the <HI>gospel. Priesthood!</HI> I must go far back to find this office:—there have been none since <HI>Jesus Christ fi∣nished transgression, and put an end to sin.</HI> It is an Old Testament office.— Now under the <HI>gospel,</HI> all the <HI>Lord's people are priests</HI> in the language of the New Testament: <HI>ye are a royal priest∣hood.</HI> But what does it signify what
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>the New Testament says; the <HI>liturgy of some churches says,</HI> we have <HI>priests,</HI> and they must have <HI>tithes.</HI></P>
<P>Self-denial is an effential part of our Saviour's religion; <HI>let a man deny him∣self, and take up his cross and follow me;</HI> which was once understood to mean, that believers were not to be con∣formed to the world, nor to seek great things for <HI>themselves.</HI> But it has been found since to signify the <HI>contracy;</HI> that it is the highest degree of self∣denial to enjoy a living of <HI>several thou∣sands a year,</HI> and do no <HI>mischief</HI> with it; that there is more mortification in rich well <HI>furnished tables,</HI> when a man is able to afford them, than in <HI>modera∣tion, temperance,</HI> and <HI>abstinence;</HI> that it is a better evidence of a true christian to behave well in the midst of <HI>riches</HI> than in <HI>poverty.</HI>—It will be owned that
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>it is a rarer thing, but can never be a better evidence of true religion.</P>
<P>We have very little reason to chal∣lenge such as have their good things in this life, providing they did not live by oppressing others by unjust <HI>claims</HI> and <HI>demands:</HI> but when such as <HI>make a shew of religion in will-worship</HI> make others who are not concerned with them <HI>bear</HI> the <HI>expence of it,</HI> it is but reasonable to put them in mind of what they should be. Must good sub∣jects be loaded like <HI>asses</HI> by <HI>priests,</HI> as the Jews were when <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> came into the world? When they ask <HI>privi∣leges</HI> let them pay: if they pay his <HI>majesty</HI>'s duty, what reason is there to pay for other people's religion, which they are not one grain the better of? When religion is turned into a <HI>policy,</HI> and made subservient to private inte∣rest,
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>it will ever bring tyranny along with it. Oppression is inseparably con∣nected with religion, when it is made the <HI>tool</HI> of <HI>ambition,</HI> and the <HI>road</HI> of <HI>preferment.</HI> I cannot easily understand, seeing the New Testament was given as the rule of direction for <HI>gospel churches,</HI> why providence did not con∣cur to give us an <HI>example</HI> in what state of <HI>preferment</HI> the members of the church should be in: for if any of the seve∣ral <HI>establishments</HI> of religion be <HI>gospel churches,</HI> there is no pattern of them in the New Testament. Antiquity makes nothing for this purpose when the scrip∣ture is silent.</P>
<P>To affect a state of dignity, riches, power and splendor, would require some <HI>scripture precept</HI> or <HI>precedent</HI> to autho∣rize the attempt.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
<P>—<HI>But circumstances did not permit, the world was heathen, and religion had no magistrate to protect it.</HI> That is all true, but God could have made his providence concur to have given us an example of the state <HI>churches</HI> should be in; or at least he could easily have told us in his word what he intended should be the highest <HI>pitch</HI> of <HI>church prefer∣ment.</HI>— If he has left it to the discre∣tion of men, we cannot tell when it shall come to its height, nor is there any thing certain about it. As we have an example of <HI>gospel churches</HI> in the days of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and there are no other prescribed in <HI>scripture,</HI> one would readily conclude there can be no other. It would be an accusation against the providence of God, to affirm, that the rules for preferment in his church were to settle after he withdrew the spirit
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>of inspiration, without so much as leav∣ing any hint that in the least favours any of these large societies called <HI>na∣tional churches.</HI> If men be to pay for the support of ecclesiastical dignities, it is but reasonable they have some au∣thority given them for it, from the <HI>New Testament,</HI> otherwise, if the <HI>ma∣gistrate pleased,</HI> he might as well re∣quire us to support the <HI>priests</HI> of <HI>Ju∣piter-hammon,</HI> and it would equally bind the conscience of a believer of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> with the law for paying <HI>tithes</HI> to <HI>bishops</HI> and their <HI>clergy.</HI></P>
<P>To pretend right to demand <HI>church dues</HI> from <HI>dissenters</HI> from the <HI>church,</HI> more than power gives, is to treat us like <HI>asses;</HI> both to <HI>deprive</HI> us of our <HI>money</HI> and our <HI>senses.</HI> Though men of any religion at all will not disobey the laws of the <HI>magistrate,</HI> yet they can∣not,
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>unless they give up the use of their reason, believe that the <HI>church</HI> has any <HI>other claim</HI> but what the <HI>ma∣gistrate gives her;</HI> and even when they pay <HI>dues</HI> to such as it is his <HI>majesty's pleasure</HI> to <HI>honour,</HI> yet they cannot help both thinking, and saying, they are <HI>ill applied,</HI> and the <HI>King</HI> is <HI>badly inform∣ed.</HI> Christians, though they may bear their burdens with patience, when they can obtain no redress, yet they would be worse than <HI>asses</HI> to bear them <HI>tamely,</HI> when they may obtain <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>And one may venture to say, did the <HI>dissenters</HI> from the church of <HI>Eng∣land, in a body,</HI> represent their case to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> they should obtain a deliverance from several <HI>grievances</HI> they <HI>couch down</HI> under. Could his <HI>majesty,</HI> and the great <HI>council</HI> of the nation, ever see it reasonable for peace∣able
<PB N="64" REF="73"/><HI>subjects</HI> to bear unreasonable bur∣dens?—who, when they have the ex∣pence of their own way of worship to maintain, are also made to pay all the <HI>ordinary expences</HI> of the <HI>establishment?</HI> If that part of the subjects called <HI>pro∣testant dissenters</HI> be fit for many pur∣poses for the good of the nation in a <HI>civil capacity,</HI> why should they not enjoy as extensive <HI>religious liberty,</HI> as they do <HI>civil privileges?</HI> Or is there any reason why they should pay equally with the members of the church in the support of the established religion, which they cannot in conscience enjoy any benefit by?</P>
<P>Though that part of the subjects be burdened without their consent, as they cannot prevent or hinder the <HI>legislator</HI> from imposing upon them, as they have none to represent them in the great
<PB N="65" REF="74"/><HI>council</HI> of the <HI>nation,</HI> yet it would be stupidity not to complain of their <HI>griev∣ances,</HI> and seek <HI>redress</HI> by all <HI>means lawful.</HI></P>
<P>It is undoubtedly, however, a <HI>burden</HI> upon such as <HI>do not,</HI> or <HI>cannot, in con∣science</HI> join in the communion of the <HI>church of England,</HI> to be obliged to pay to support a worship they can see no warrant for from the New Testa∣ment.—But after imposing upon men's consciences, we need not think it strange that they impose upon our purses. What a weak religion must it be that stands in need of any thing to support it, but what proceeds from <HI>voluntary consent,</HI> and <HI>good-will?</HI> It is strange that the christian religion cannot main∣tain its ground by the same means that it gained it. Perhaps it may be said, that <HI>inspiration</HI> and the <HI>extraordinary
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>providence of God</HI> made it gain Ground in the world, but when that is ceased there is need of <HI>some other security.</HI> Truly we may say we have changed much for the worse, if the <HI>legal es∣tablishment</HI> of religion has come in the place of God's <HI>extraordinary assistance.</HI></P>
<P>But may it not as well be affirmed, that since the word of God is now compleated, and we have all the dic∣tates of the Almighty's will <HI>needful</HI> to direct us into <HI>all truth,</HI> and the pro∣mise of his <HI>Spirit</HI> to lead us into it, that this is sufficient to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cure religion till the <HI>sound of the last trumpet.</HI>—The most that human laws can do in securing religion, is to make men <HI>say they are religious.</HI> They never can reach the conscience, nor make any man believe a doctrine, till he have sufficient evi∣dence for it.—Religion is as well se∣cured
<PB N="67" REF="76"/><HI>without establishments</HI> as with them, tho' the <HI>livings</HI> and <HI>benefices are not.</HI> The promise of God is a suffi∣cient security for religion. The church is built upon the doctrine of the <HI>Pro∣phets and Apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.</HI></P>
<P>In the days of the Apostles the church of God had not received the <HI>New Testament oracles</HI> into her pos∣session.—The <HI>Apostles</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> were sent as well to communicate the mind of the <HI>Almighty</HI> to the church, as to convert men to the christian religion. <HI>Evangelists,</HI> and other teachers, were also given by God, and sent by the Apostles to all the several places and churches where religion had taken up her residence.—These messengers of the <HI>Apostles</HI> were sent, and continued till the whole of the sacred oracles were given,
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>and received by the <HI>church:</HI> they were endowed with the spirit of infallible <HI>interpretation,</HI> as the Apostles were en∣dowed with the spirit of <HI>inspiration.</HI> These <HI>Elders, Teachers,</HI> or <HI>Evangelists,</HI> had not any liberty to depart from the <HI>apostolical instructions,</HI> but were obliged to hold by the <HI>form of sound words</HI> which they received from the <HI>Apostles.</HI> Their use in the church was to de∣termine what was or was not truly <HI>apostolical.</HI></P>
<P>By these <HI>Evangelists</HI> the <HI>christian church</HI> was preserved from receiving any spurious writings of <HI>impostors,</HI> in the place of, or together with, the <HI>dictates</HI> of <HI>divine inspiration.</HI>—But when revelation was fully given, and received by the <HI>church,</HI> then was <HI>religion es∣tablished;</HI>—and that word, which from the mouths of the <HI>Apostles</HI> converted
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>so many to christianity, was left for their <HI>establishment in the faith,</HI> and for the <HI>conversion</HI> of others. There is no need of <HI>inspiration</HI> now, since we have all that the <HI>Apostles</HI> had, in their wri∣tings. That <HI>armour of God</HI> which the <HI>Apostles</HI> had, that was <HI>mighty to pull down strong-holds and imaginations, that exalted themselves against the kingdom of God,</HI> and which at <HI>that time</HI> was only in their hands, * is now commit∣ted to <HI>all christians.</HI> The <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> gives a sufficient reason why the <HI>chris∣tian churches</HI> may stand, and why they do so—they have the <HI>whole armour of God, whereby they are able to resist the fiery darts of the wicked one:</HI> by this <HI>they stand fast in the evil day.</HI> That whole passage deserves a place here: <HI>Where∣fore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 14. Eph. vi. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE>
<PB N="70" REF="79"/><HI>the evil day, and having done all to stand. Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and hav∣ing on the breast-plate of righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparations of the gospel of peace: above all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked; and take the hel∣met of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.</HI></P>
<P>Can there be a better <HI>establishment of religion</HI> than this, or any better <HI>se∣curity</HI> for <HI>christianity</HI> than the word of God? The word of God is unchange∣able, and cannot alter; neither is it possible that the <HI>gates of hell can pre∣vail against the church,</HI> though there was not an <HI>establishment</HI> in the world. The <HI>church</HI> is not at any loss for the want of <HI>inspiration,</HI> in <HI>that sense</HI> the
<PB N="71" REF="80"/><HI>Apostles</HI> had it, for in <HI>that sense</HI> she does not need it: the word of God is mighty for all the purposes of <HI>edifi∣cation</HI> and <HI>happiness</HI> to the <HI>church,</HI> to the end of the world.</P>
<P>Such carnal weapons as <HI>acts of par∣liament,</HI> and <HI>civil sanctions,</HI> religion does not need, nor can they be applied unto it without destroying it.—<HI>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, yet mighty to pull down.</HI> The weapons of defence the Apostles had, every christian is now fully in the possession of. The <HI>de∣crees</HI> of <HI>councils,</HI> and the <HI>canons</HI> of the <HI>church,</HI> are also but <HI>carnal weapons,</HI> often framed through the influence of <HI>carnal policy,</HI> by men who had too great a share in the management of <HI>the kingdoms of this world,</HI> to keep strictly to the rules of the <HI>kingdom of Christ.</HI> The most charitable construction that
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>can be put upon all that ever was done by men <HI>in the way of forming laws of any kind,</HI> in favour of religion, is, that they were building <HI>hay</HI> and <HI>stubble</HI> upon the <HI>foundation</HI> of the <HI>Apos∣tles.</HI> What <HI>Issachers</HI> would our <HI>church guides</HI> make us, to lay upon our <HI>shoul∣ders</HI> such a heavy burden of <HI>ecclesiastic constitutions, human creeds,</HI> and <HI>articles,</HI> when every man that reads his <HI>New Testament</HI> may easily see the futility of their design? If we be the <HI>disciples of men,</HI> we are not the <HI>disciples of Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Civil Burdens</HI> may be borne, but <HI>re∣ligious slavery</HI> is insupportable: to bear either tamely is an ass-like disposition. As to the first, when there is no re∣medy nor hopes of redress, it is chris∣tian-like to have patience, and be obe∣dient to the powers that are in being:
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>but it is <HI>stupidity</HI> to couch down and take a burden. When a burden is laid on by <HI>violence,</HI> or by the <HI>iniquity of the times,</HI> christians should be patient sufferers like <HI>Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Apostles:</HI> but when liberty can be obtained, it is <HI>meanness</HI> to couch down to <HI>slavery.</HI> If times permit, and laws allow chris∣tians to assert their <HI>civil rights,</HI> they should not depart from them through meanness of spirit.—Like <HI>Paul,</HI> they may tell such as endeavour to burden them, <HI>they are free born.</HI>—As to reli∣gious burdens, as they respect the con∣science, they cannot be born at all: the consciences of men have but <HI>one master,</HI> and cannot yield obedience to any other.—It is not only <HI>mean,</HI> but <HI>criminal,</HI> to admit a <HI>partner</HI> with the <HI>Almighty</HI> in the government of <HI>conscience.</HI> Whe∣ther they be things that God hath commanded, or not, no man has a right
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>to impose obedience upon us by any <HI>human contrivance.</HI> If they be command∣ed, let them shew the <HI>authority,</HI> and rest there, for it is superfluous to add to divine authority: if they are not commanded, it is <HI>presumptuous</HI> and <HI>pro∣fane</HI> to attempt to lay a burden upon a <HI>subject,</HI> that is only accountable to the great judge of all. Upon these principles of imposition, every man who imposes lays a snare for himself, when ever the times happen to change; for when ever the intolerant imposer loses his power, and that power falls into other hands, what can he expect, but to have his own measure returned back again unto him? There is no just reason for him to complain, however unjust it may be, for any other im∣poser to do as he hath done; for he is but now receiving the <HI>same measure</HI> he so liberally gave out <HI>to others.</HI> Who∣erer
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>insists upon having a right to oblige others to receive their religious opinions, upon the <HI>pain</HI> of any <HI>loss</HI> whatsoever, where the word of God gives no direction, must be accounted <HI>infidels</HI> towards God, and <HI>oppressors</HI> of mankind. When the word of God is given to make the man of God per∣fect, and is profitable <HI>for all things</HI> in religion, do they not accuse God of <HI>folly,</HI> and his word of <HI>imperfection,</HI> who make fences against <HI>error,</HI> which are accounted more fit to guard men against <HI>heresy</HI> than the <HI>scriptures themselves?</HI> And is it not treating men <HI>like asses,</HI> to tell them the scriptures are <HI>profitable for all things</HI> in <HI>matters</HI> of <HI>religion,</HI> and yet lay them under the necessity of receiving <HI>dogmas</HI> of human contri∣vance, <HI>to preserve the purity of the faith?</HI> This is a mere <HI>Penelope's web,</HI> a doing and undoing at the same time. What
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>occasion to introduce any other system of religion either with or besides the the <HI>scriptures,</HI> if they be sufficient to make men perfect in <HI>all things</HI> pertain∣ing to <HI>godliness?</HI> Do men think they can express themselves more intelligibly than the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> or commend the truth <HI>more clearly</HI> to other men's <HI>con∣sciences?</HI></P>
<P>The most that can lawfully be done with any <HI>human composition,</HI> however good it may be, is to leave it to men's <HI>consideration,</HI> and to suffer them to ex∣amine it by the <HI>word of God;</HI> but if they cannot find it consistent therewith, they are at liberty to reject it. The reason of all <HI>civil</HI> or <HI>religious imposi∣tions</HI> hath been the natural slothfulness of individuals, that could not be at pains to mind their own <HI>business</HI> and <HI>private rights.</HI> Mankind, in the se∣veral
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>ages of the world, have been like great men who give themselves to plea∣sure, and commit the care of their es∣tates to the management of <HI>stewards,</HI> who at last become <HI>masters,</HI> and make their <HI>masters</HI> their <HI>servants.</HI> Such as are by the community exalted to <HI>power</HI> and <HI>preferment,</HI> unless they be wise and virtuous, except the several individuals which advanced them to power look also to their <HI>administration,</HI> they will be ready, like <HI>Phaeton,</HI> who received the direction of his <HI>father's chariot,</HI> to set the world on sire. One cause of our present complaints, both as to <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious oppression,</HI> is, that <HI>we look not to ourselves,</HI> but think, as soon as we have elected civil or religious go∣vernors, we may <HI>fall asleep</HI> in plea∣sure, indolence, and inattention. There is no doubt but <HI>governors</HI> were de∣signed for ease to the <HI>public,</HI> and when
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>they <HI>do their duty</HI> they are a <HI>public blessing:</HI> but when they degenerate into <HI>tyrants,</HI> there is as much of the blame lies upon the <HI>community</HI> as upon <HI>them;</HI> for had those who employed them <HI>watched over them</HI> as they ought, and given them timely admonition, they might have prevented them from ruin∣ing both their own <HI>souls</HI> and the <HI>pub∣lic interest.</HI> The indolence and sloth of a people, are a temptation to go∣vornors to turn <HI>usurpers.</HI> In a free country like ours, where <HI>commissioners</HI> to <HI>parliament</HI> are elected by the <HI>com∣munity,</HI> and are not to be perpetual <HI>dictators,</HI> it would be easy to make them rule with discretion, by putting them in mind of the <HI>shortnest of their power.</HI> We lose our liberty by not asserting it <HI>properly.</HI> It serves no pur∣pose to cry out against the govern∣ment, and the prime minister, when
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>we are ourselves to blame.—When the time of a general <HI>election</HI> comes on, it is in the power of the subjects to as∣sert their own liberty. When these men <HI>who rule by their wealth,</HI> and whose business it is to corrupt their fellow-subjects with <HI>bribery,</HI> and cheat them out of their liberty by <HI>flattery</HI> and <HI>corruption,</HI> come to ask your voices in their <HI>election,</HI> do you despise their of∣fers, and say to them, <HI>your money perish with you.</HI> Can it be supposed that such men will take care of your <HI>interests,</HI> who want to ruin your <HI>souls;</HI> who begin with debauching your morals with <HI>drun∣kenness</HI> and <HI>perjury.</HI> Will that man have the least regard for your civil interest and property, who first attempts to ruin your virtue? Will he ever scruple to betray the liberties of his country, who teaches <HI>perjury,</HI> and follows <HI>bribery</HI> and <HI>corruption?</HI>—It is at best a bad begin∣ning,
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>when men mount to <HI>preferment</HI> by means of <HI>bribery</HI> and <HI>false swear∣ing.</HI> What better is a <HI>county,</HI> a <HI>city,</HI> or a <HI>borough,</HI> than a <HI>community of asses,</HI> that suffer themselves to be cheated out of their privileges, by any <HI>duke, knight, 'squire,</HI> that comes <HI>to water them?</HI> When any of these, who offer them∣selves candidates to <HI>counties</HI> and <HI>towns,</HI> to be elected members of <HI>parliament,</HI> come to solicit votes, by making whole <HI>towns swim in drunkenness,</HI> what opi∣nion must these gentlemen have of such <HI>drunken societies,</HI> who will do so much for a few days of <HI>riot</HI> and <HI>gluttony,</HI> as <HI>to sell their liberties,</HI> but that they are <HI>asses that want to be watered?</HI> Can that nation be accounted free, that can be so easily enslaved by <HI>drunkenness</HI> and <HI>bribery?</HI> Liberty is but a name, when it can be so easily subdued by such mean gratifications. When men are slaves to
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>their lusts, they will never be free. Men that do so easily <HI>sell their soul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> will not value their country.—Where there is not virtue, there can be no li∣berty—it is only licentiousness. Liberty is an high-sounding name in <HI>Britain,</HI> and there are, I dare say, more slaves in it, <HI>according to the privileges it en∣joys,</HI> than there are in <HI>Constantinople.</HI>—And with this aggravation, that they know how to prevent it. What <HI>Issa∣chers</HI> are these <HI>towns</HI> and <HI>corporations,</HI> that give their votes to a <HI>member of parliament</HI> who neither fears God nor loves them; who, by the method he pursues to obtain an election, deserves to forfeit the favour and esteem of all the lovers of virtue and honesty. Whom can they blame for their oppression but themselves? Their own hands do make the fetters by which they are bound. Can the <HI>disturbers</HI> and <HI>debauchers</HI> of
<PB N="82" REF="91"/><HI>cities, towns,</HI> and <HI>corporations,</HI> be fit men to sit in the great <HI>council</HI> of these nations?—Who, during the drunken revels of several weeks and months, ruin more morals, and corrupt more minds, than ever their service is worth to the <HI>common-weal.</HI></P>
<P>It appears something strange, that men cannot be supposed to be free to make choice of one to represent them in the <HI>high assembly</HI> of the <HI>nation,</HI> till they be made slaves to <HI>drunkenness</HI> and <HI>cor∣ruption.</HI> It were sufficient to make all good subjects abhor a man that offered such an <HI>insult to their virtue,</HI> as to at∣tempt to overcome it before they would solicit their <HI>election.</HI> These <HI>towns, counties,</HI> and <HI>corporations,</HI> richly deserve a burden of <HI>heavy taxes</HI> upon their <HI>window lights,</HI> and <HI>other property,</HI> who give up the light of their <HI>understand∣ing</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="92"/>to <HI>venal corruption.</HI> Those who have laid out so much money upon an <HI>election,</HI> will endeavour to make you pay for it, by joining with some <HI>venal ministry in taxing you,</HI> for the benefit of a rich <HI>preferment.</HI> Had the several members of <HI>cities, towns,</HI> and <HI>counties,</HI> consulted their own happiness and interest, as truly as they have some times made a <HI>noise</HI> about them, they might have prevented many heavy im∣positions that they now labour under.—Had they made it their business to chuse <HI>worthy</HI> and <HI>good men</HI> to repre∣sent them in <HI>parliament,</HI> with an <HI>assu∣rance</HI> that they would ever support them, while they made it their study <HI>to maintain their liberties;</HI> but on the other hand would despise every such person as should <HI>betray the interest of his constituents,</HI> and the <HI>welfare of his country,</HI> for any <HI>place, pension,</HI> or <HI>pre∣ferment,</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="93"/>they might have hereby laid some restraint upon the <HI>venal disposi∣tion of such as make a trade of selling their country,</HI> for a <HI>place</HI> or <HI>pension</HI> un∣der an <HI>aspiring minister.</HI> The assurance that they should never again be elected by any <HI>county, city, town,</HI> or <HI>corporation,</HI> if they joined in bringing them under any <HI>burden</HI> and <HI>slavery,</HI> would be a check upon them, to hinder them from going into all the <HI>schemes of a minister</HI> to hurt their fellow-subjects. But what have men to expect from <HI>such candi∣dates,</HI> who offer themselves to serve their country, <HI>but begin with corrupt∣ing their morals,</HI> that they may remove from their minds <HI>all sense of virtue,</HI> that they may the better <HI>make a sale of their privileges.</HI> These corrupt mem∣bers of the commonwealth know how to pacify those whose interest <HI>they have betrayed in parliament.</HI> — It is only to
<PB N="85" REF="94"/>do what they do every time they are elected, to make <HI>towns</HI> and <HI>cities revel in drunkenness</HI> for so many days and weeks, and to <HI>bribe some few</HI> who have influence to lead the rest. After this they depart to their old employment, with the character of THE BEST MEN IN THE WORLD. It requires no more but that they occasionally <HI>water their asses,</HI> to make them true beasts of bur∣den, and cause them to stoop down patiently and take them on. If some are more obstinate than the rest, and will not be tractable enough <HI>with an ordinary quantity of good liquor,</HI> they know how to manage such <HI>asses</HI>—they silence their <HI>noise</HI> with <HI>some gift</HI> that is suited to their disposition. <HI>Issachar</HI>'s character is truly applicable to the <HI>in∣habitants of Britain</HI> — they are <HI>strong asses,</HI> that <HI>love rest</HI> and <HI>ease,</HI> and <HI>couch down</HI> under heavy burdens.</P>
<PB N="86" REF="95"/>
<P>Were not the greatest part of these kingdoms of <HI>Issachar's character,</HI> could they sit easy under <HI>taxes,</HI> the most un∣reasonable in the world?

The poorest man that lives, cannot live without: <HI>meat</HI> and <HI>drink, shoes</HI> and <HI>light</HI>—yet he must pay heavy duty for the <HI>sun that shines in at his window,</HI> for the <HI>beer he drinks,</HI> the <HI>candle he makes use of,</HI> and for the very <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es upon his feet.</HI>—Those who opposed the <HI>cyder act,</HI> and obtained the <HI>repeal thereof</HI> after it was past, were truly <HI>sons of liberty.</HI>—They were like <HI>Nepthali, hinds let loose;</HI> and not like <HI>Issachar, strong asses, couching down</HI> un∣der unreasonable burdens and oppres∣sion. We have certainly as good right to drink <HI>beer</HI> without <HI>heavy excise,</HI> as they have to <HI>drink cyder.—Britons,</HI> you
<PB N="87" REF="96"/>will soon have it in your power to enjoy the <HI>same freedom</HI> as these your fellow-subjects.—When the general <HI>elec∣tion</HI> comes on, chuse <HI>no man</HI> for a <HI>mem∣ber</HI> of <HI>parliament,</HI> who will not give you <HI>security</HI> that he will stand up for a <HI>repeal</HI> of those <HI>several laws that op∣press you.</HI>—If you remain still under your burdens, it must be your own fault.—You will stand recorded for <HI>asses to all generations,</HI> if you do not assert your liberties when you have it in your power. It is not <HI>disloyalty</HI> to your <HI>King,</HI> nor any way injurious to the <HI>constitu∣tion</HI> and <HI>laws</HI> of your <HI>country,</HI> to give <HI>instructions to the candidates you chuse for your members of parliament,</HI> and take their <HI>obligation</HI> that they will follow these instructions.—This will be more noble than taking <HI>bribes,</HI> and more pro∣sitable than <HI>rioting a few days</HI> in <HI>glut∣tony</HI> and <HI>drunkenness.</HI>—Members of par∣liament
<PB N="88" REF="97"/>are <HI>your servants,</HI> and the <HI>ser∣vants of their country;</HI> it is but rea∣sonable they be made accountable for their conduct.—<HI>Give them their instruc∣tions,</HI> and require them to keep by them. When any <HI>duke</HI> or <HI>lord, knight</HI> or <HI>'squire,</HI> come with their <HI>drunken rab∣ble</HI> of <HI>attendants,</HI> to solicit your votes by <HI>treats</HI> and <HI>entertainments,</HI> put them in mind what they are about, and what they ought to be.—Tell them that none who make attempts upon other men's virtue can be faithful to their <HI>Liber∣ties</HI> and <HI>interest.</HI>—Shun them, as you would do the <HI>Pestilence,</HI> lest you suf∣fer them to corrupt your virtue.—Re∣member that there cannot a greater plague enter a <HI>city,</HI> than such as seek to stain the virtue of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Is it not strange to see a whole <HI>town</HI> and <HI>corporation</HI> flocking about a man
<PB N="89" REF="98"/>for some <HI>private emolument</HI> to individuals, at the expence of the public welfare, each concealing from his neighbour his real intention, that he may <HI>serve</HI> or <HI>please himself</HI> with some <HI>base gratifica∣tion?</HI> That same person who thus en∣deavours to corrupt you, and is at great expence to do it, will no doubt make you <HI>pay for it soundly, by taxing you severely.</HI>—That money he is obliged to lay out to obtain your election, he knows how to bring back to himself, <HI>with inte∣rest,</HI> at <HI>your expence.</HI>—It appears to me exceeding plain, that all the <HI>towns</HI> and <HI>counties</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI> have borne the ex∣pence of their own elections these se∣veral sessions of parliament. These two articles—<HI>window-cess</HI> and the <HI>duty</HI> upon <HI>ale</HI> and <HI>beer,</HI> for fourteen years back, I presume, sufficiently compensate for the expence of the <HI>election jobbers.</HI>—I shall, perhaps, hear it said, that this is applied
<PB N="90" REF="99"/>to <HI>the use of the government.</HI>—I own it is very true;—but it is to pay a num∣ber of <HI>pensioners,</HI> that ruined themselves first by <HI>elections,</HI> and have since been <HI>better endowed</HI> than ever they were be∣fore.—It would be thought, perhaps, invidious to produce examples—but there are many to be found. A gen∣tleman may safely sink his estate by <HI>procuring and election,</HI> when he can af∣terwards buy another, ten times better than that which he had before. They are in this respect <HI>like other traders,</HI> who, when they fail, very often <HI>make a profitable composition</HI> at other people's expence, and grow richer than ever they were before.</P>
<P>It would undoubtedly be a good me∣thod to do with the <HI>candidates</HI> for <HI>elections,</HI> as is done with the military on these occasions; to keep <HI>them</HI> and
<PB N="91" REF="100"/><HI>their agents</HI> a stage distant from the place of the election till it was decided. In this respect it would be free: but there can be no true liberty where peo∣ple are not left indifferent to make a choice <HI>purely upon the principles of vir∣tue.</HI></P>
<P>Men will not readily submit to any bondage till they be corrupted. The way that has been taken in all ages to inslave mankind, has been first <HI>to over∣come their virtue.</HI> As long as the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> were virtuous, they enjoyed free∣dom and liberty: but when <HI>luxury, bri∣bery,</HI> and <HI>corruption</HI> were introduced, virtue declined, and <HI>Rome</HI> was inslaved. It is vain to talk of freedom when we are slaves to our passions: such as have art to manage these springs of action, will easily make us slaves by our own consent, and by taking hold of <HI>some∣thing
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>within us,</HI> insensibly lead us into bondage. One would readily think that such as offered their service to their coun∣try, intended the welfare thereof; but when they set out on their enterprize, by first overcoming, or seeking to over∣come, the <HI>virtue</HI> of their <HI>fellow-subjects,</HI> it is a <HI>bad omen,</HI> and gives ground of <HI>suspicion,</HI> that something beside <HI>public happiness</HI> is the reason of their conduct. When a man to whom providence hath given a liberal share of worldly posses∣sions, and who is able by the weight of his interest to weigh down the fourth part of a county, employs that interest contrary to the <HI>principles of honesty</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> any person of the least discern∣ment may see that he is a <HI>curse to the nation.</HI> When men's votes are solicited, or <HI>purchased,</HI> or when such as are in <HI>some dependance upon a superior,</HI> are over∣awed in their voting, the person whom
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>they chuse is not freely elected. The men of large fortunes treat their de∣pendants <HI>like asses,</HI> and <HI>threaten</HI> them out of their <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> at once, by the weight of their interest. In strict speaking, there is no man free, <HI>according to the present rules of elections,</HI> but men of <HI>large</HI> and <HI>extensive fortunes.</HI> The power of chusing a man to re∣present a <HI>town</HI> or <HI>county</HI> in <HI>parliament,</HI> is lodged in the hands of a few <HI>mono∣polizers of privileges,</HI> who, by the weight of their <HI>purses,</HI> and the <HI>power</HI> of their <HI>interest,</HI> can turn the rest as they have a mind. <HI>Britons,</HI> are you sensible what you are doing, when for some <HI>small fa∣vour,</HI> or <HI>sordid gratification,</HI> you sell your votes to such as want to inslave your country.—You are publishing to all the world that you <HI>are asses,</HI> ready and willing to take on any burden.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
<P>The meanness of the greatest num∣ber of freeholders in <HI>Britain,</HI> is conspi∣cuous in their stooping down to take on every burden that any over-grown <HI>duke</HI> or <HI>knight</HI> pleases to impose upon them.—When once it is known what side of the question <HI>his grace is on,</HI> the inferior freholders ask no more, but generally say, <HI>Amen.</HI> They do not consider the <HI>qualifications</HI> and <HI>merit</HI> of the candidate, whether he is a <HI>wise man</HI> or a <HI>fool,</HI> an <HI>honest man</HI> or a <HI>knave,</HI> a <HI>friend</HI> to his <HI>country</HI> or a <HI>tool</HI> of the <HI>slate:</HI> if he is such a great man's friend, that is sussicient. In this conduct of <HI>British</HI> freeholders, we may also see the character of several of their mem∣bers of parliament;—when men who have a right to elect one to represent them in the great council of the na∣tion have no concern for their own
<PB N="95" REF="104"/><HI>interest,</HI> but elect <HI>by chance</HI> any one that a superior recommends, they have no reason to think that the man whom they have chosen will pay any more regard to their interest than they have done themselves;—they will be ready to vote in parliament <HI>with as much indifference about the interest of their con∣stituents, as they did for them in the general election:</HI> as they have had occa∣sion to learn from the conduct of the nation in general, how <HI>little</HI> they <HI>value</HI> their <HI>liberties</HI> and <HI>property,</HI> by intrust∣ing <HI>them</HI> in the hands of men they did know, nor endeavoured to know, <HI>they</HI> find they can with more safety dispose of <HI>them to their own advantage,</HI> at the <HI>call of a minister,</HI> for <HI>a good consideration.</HI></P>
<P>Who is to blame for the heavy load of taxes that the nation groans under
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>but the very people who pay them? Had they been careful in chusing <HI>ho∣nest</HI> and <HI>fit men</HI> to manage their <HI>inte∣rests</HI> at <HI>court,</HI> who are possest of love for their country, and the happiness of those they represented, they would have stood up for their <HI>interest,</HI> and declared against all imposition.—It is men's own indolence and inattention that ruin them.</P>
<P>The remedy against these burdens is evident, men ought sincerely to look after their own interests.—From a prin∣ciple of disinterested love to the pub∣lic, every man that enjoys possessions should take care of them, as a trust committed to him, for which he is ac∣countable. —Not as accountable only to himself, by considering what he possesses to be his own, which he may dispose of at his pleasure, but as intrusted by providence with something that the pub∣lic
<PB N="97" REF="106"/>has a concern in. A kingdom un∣der a government like ours, is like an estate put into the hands of a number of <HI>stewards,</HI> who, though they have their reward for their service, yet are obliged to act for the good of the whole. The right exercise of their li∣berty consists in <HI>supporting private right,</HI> for the sake of <HI>public happiness.</HI> When individuals cease to take care of their special <HI>departments,</HI> as supporters of public liberty, they will degenerate into <HI>indifference,</HI> or <HI>selfish principles.</HI> As much depends upon wise <HI>legislation</HI> to make men free and happy; as laws, when formed, must affect every indi∣vidual; it must be necessary in the first degree, to have wise men appointed to act in the <HI>legislature.</HI> Burdens must be taken off in the same manner they were laid on: and as selfish and cor∣rupt members of <HI>parliament</HI> were the
<PB N="98" REF="107"/>instruments of imposing burdens upon the nation, wise, virtuous, and disinte∣rested ones, must be the <HI>instruments</HI> of removing them. Instead of fruitless complaints against the government, when it is not in your power to help the evil, let it be your study, <HI>Britons,</HI> now when it is in your power, to apply an <HI>effectual remedy.</HI>—Chuse none of those for your representatives at the general election, <HI>who concurred in laying bur∣dens upon you before.</HI>—Suffer them to stand as <HI>beacons,</HI> for posterity to take warning from. Shall the freeholders of <HI>Britain</HI> again chuse such unworthy members of society to manage their pub∣lic affairs, they may expect to have their <HI>burdens continued,</HI> and fixed more firmly upon their <HI>shoulders.</HI> You may always suspect every one that wants to corrupt you: <HI>the same person</HI> will also endea∣vour to <HI>load you with heavy burdens.</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="108"/>The whole nation, by this time, may know who were the <HI>tools of the mi∣nistry</HI> in the last session of parliament. <HI>Set a mark upon them,</HI> that ages to come may hold their <HI>memories</HI> in <HI>ab∣horrence.</HI> Let it be known, that <HI>Bri∣tain</HI> knows <HI>how to reward the worthy,</HI> and <HI>despise the worthless.</HI> Would <HI>Eng∣land</HI> desire to get free of some heavy and grievous burdens, which the poor, and even the middle ranks of mankind groan under, let them endeavour to make choice of men to represent them in <HI>parliament,</HI> who will be as zealous to get them freed from oppression, as their former representatives were to impose burdens upon them.

<PB N="103" REF="112"/>
<P>With regard to religious bondage and oppression, as it respects chiefly <HI>dissenters</HI> from the <HI>establishment,</HI> it will not be so easy to get it removed.— But certainly the laity of <HI>Britain</HI> have more good sense than not to see the <HI>absurdity</HI> of several ecclesiastic imposi∣tions upon that part of his majesty's subjects. It is not likely that the es∣tablished clergy will ever give their consent to any law that shall ever be made for the <HI>relief of protestant dissen∣ters:</HI> they will no doubt consider that <HI>their relief</HI> will be <HI>their disadvantage.</HI> —But the <HI>clergy</HI> are not the <HI>majority</HI> in <HI>parliament,</HI> nor does <HI>wisdom, cha∣rity,</HI> and <HI>humanity</HI> dwell alone with them.

<PB N="105" REF="114"/>to join in an <HI>address</HI> to the <HI>parliament,</HI> for the <HI>removal</HI> of the <HI>cau∣ses</HI> of their <HI>grievances:</HI> there is some reason to expect they would be heard; at least it would shew they were not like <HI>Issachar, asses couching down under a heavy burden voluntarily.</HI>—It would shew to the world the nobleness of their spirit, in striving to get free of oppres∣sion. —<HI>Occasional conformity</HI> for <HI>posts</HI> un∣der the government, is a burden very unreasonable: it ought not to be re∣quired, and should not be complied with. Cannot an <HI>oath of fidelity</HI> and <HI>allegiance</HI> to the <HI>sovereign</HI> give security to the state of a man's <HI>loyalty,</HI> without taking the <HI>sacrament upon it?</HI> Can there be any reason for such an imposition in <HI>nature,</HI> or <HI>revealed religion?</HI> It would be better to tell <HI>dissenters</HI> that they shall have no <HI>preferments</HI> under the go∣vernment at all, than clog them with

It is not a light mat∣ter for men to have a call to serve their country, and their sovereign, and be obliged <HI>to give up conscience,</HI> or <HI>re∣fuse the call.</HI> This is at least leading men into temptation. May not <HI>protes∣tant dissenters</HI> supplicate their <HI>superiors,</HI> and <HI>earnestly intreat</HI> them to consider their <HI>burdens?</HI> They have undoubtedly some property in the nation, and bear their own share in the expence of go∣vernment; it can be no <HI>presumption</HI> to ask what is reasonable. They should join mutually in <HI>petitioning his majesty,</HI> and the <HI>high assembly</HI> of the nation, for a hearing of their grievances.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are several methods of preaching in practice among the several <HI>professors</HI> who pretend to <HI>that
<PB N="110" REF="118"/>gift:</HI>—but the chief seem to be these two.—To make some text of scripture either the <HI>foundation</HI> or <HI>occasion</HI> of their discourse. It answers much the same purpose, whether a sermon be taken from the <HI>text,</HI> or suggested by means thereof. I imagine my readers will ea∣sily conceive which of these methods I have observed in this discourse. <HI>Ba∣laam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass.</HI>—There must be some matter of importance in hand, when a man of <HI>Balaam</HI>'s character is up so early. <HI>Some pious purpose, no doubt,</HI> is to be executed when a <HI>prophet</HI> rises so soon in the morning. You will be surprized to hear that <HI>the anger of the Lord was kindled against the prophet.</HI>—There was a reason for it:—<HI>Balaam loved the wages of unrighteousness,</HI> and rose with a de∣sign to curse a blessed people to procure them.</P>
<PB N="111" REF="119"/>
<P>Alas! the <HI>whole creation groaneth and is in bondage until now;</HI>—the meanest animal is brought into slavery by the iniquities of man. Men of deep designs, and profound politics, will make use of any instrument to obtain their ends.—<HI>When a man is riding to the devil, an ass will serve the purpose as well as a horse.</HI> Our covetous <HI>prophet</HI> had now a great object in his eye:— the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Moab</HI> had promised to ex∣alt him to <HI>riches</HI> and <HI>honour,</HI> if he would curse the <HI>children of Israel,</HI> and it is no wonder that a man of <HI>Balaam</HI>'s disposition was up early in the morn∣ing to look after them.—<HI>It was to serve a king too.</HI>—The leaders in all nations, in all ages, have <HI>been well-disposed to serve the great.</HI> I have read of <HI>bishops</HI> who have been employed the same way.—But how shall he curse
<PB N="112" REF="120"/>whom God hath blessed? What did the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Moab</HI> mean, by asking <HI>Ba∣laam</HI> to curse <HI>Israel?—Superstition</HI> has been very early in the world:—such as had no just notions of the true God, had yet some notions of a supreme power to bless and curse.</P>
<P><HI>Balaam</HI> seems to have been one of the <HI>Eastern Magi,</HI> and one of those who pretended to be hand and glove with some powerful <HI>divinity,</HI>—whose aid he could call in at his pleasure, to bless or curse whom he had a mind. It is very likely this was all a perver∣sion and corruption of the religion of the true God, which was made use of to serve the <HI>pious purposes of false pro∣phets, and the politics of princes.</HI>—The greatest part of the leading men of this world, in almost every age, have meant no more by religion, than to
<PB N="113" REF="121"/>make it an <HI>engine of state policy,</HI> or a <HI>tool of secular interest.</HI> Men of any de∣gree of sagacity can easily see that the common people will not always be sub∣ject to their authority, unless they be brought under it by <HI>means of temporal advantage,</HI> or <HI>the influence of religion:</HI> and as they who aspire after power are seldom disposed to part with <HI>many worldly emoluments,</HI> they endeavour to gain the obedience of the vulgar with what costs them nothing, and what they themselves <HI>set no value upon.</HI> Se∣vere as this reflection may seem upon <HI>human legislators,</HI> experience hath for a long time confirmed it;—and it is evident from observation, that the grea∣test part of those who have wanted to bring over religion to their side, have made use of it to serve the ends of their <HI>pride and ambition.</HI> It is difficult, if not impossible, to govern mankind with∣out
<PB N="114" REF="122"/><HI>some form of religion;</HI>—for it may be found by observation, that where there is least religion, or where it is most perverted, there is generally the greatest barbarity among the inhabitants of any country.—Where the knowledge of the Deity is well-nigh obliterated in the minds of a people, they differ but little from other <HI>animals;</HI>—they are rude, savage, and untractable, till they are instructed in the knowledge of <HI>re∣ligion.</HI></P>
<P>I must observe here, that although <HI>princes</HI> have made religion an <HI>engine of government</HI> to manage their subjects by, yet they could never so far prevail over <HI>priests</HI> and <HI>prophets,</HI> as to make them subservient to the ends of their policy, without allowing them to go <HI>snacks with them in the profits that a∣rise from it.</HI></P>
<PB N="115" REF="123"/>
<P>It would appear, from considering the influence of religion upon man∣kind, that it is necessary to their <HI>very constitution, in a civilized capacity,</HI>— for without it they differ but little from <HI>brutes.</HI>—The best civil policy cannot subsist without it;—for where religion is once removed, there is neither <HI>law</HI> nor <HI>policy.</HI> Religion softens the mind, and makes it capable of impressions that men are strangers to without it: —without it we have no proper springs of action to excite us to what is truly noble and virtuous. Some men may have a sort of animal docility, and be more easily kept in order than others, but without religion they are at best <HI>but a milder sort of savages.</HI></P>
<P>It is a pity, however, it should be made subservient to base ends and pur∣poses:
<PB N="116" REF="124"/>—it seems to be the chief end of our nature, and should be the chief aim of our conduct.—To it all other things should be made subservient;—and it is no sign of the soundness of the human oeconomy, when the <HI>mistress is made a dupe to her handmaids.</HI> It is a strong argument of the usefulness of religion, that generally all men, in <HI>the time of distress,</HI> make her their <HI>dernier resort.</HI></P>
<P>What kings find themselves unable to do by force of arms, they some∣times think may be done by the <HI>Deity</HI> without them.—This is a fair, but a forced acknowledgment of <HI>human im∣potence,</HI> and of the <HI>independence</HI> of the <HI>Deity.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever may have been said by <HI>travellers,</HI> perhaps there are no people in the world but do worship a <HI>Deity,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="125"/>under the characters of either <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad.</HI> The human mind seems to be formed for religion; and notwithstand∣ing of the wrong bias that <HI>habit</HI> and <HI>custom</HI> do often give the minds of men, yet the very errors and excesses of mankind shew what way the mind would exercise herself, if she were once clear of those <HI>fetters</HI> and <HI>mana∣cles</HI> that hold her.</P>
<P>Were there as many to instruct us in the <HI>ways of righteousness,</HI> as there are to seduce us into the <HI>paths of error</HI> and <HI>falshood,</HI> perhaps we would find matters very different from what they are. When <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious rulers are engaged in one interest</HI> to seduce mankind, if the <HI>Almighty himself</HI> were not at the head of the <HI>administration,</HI> it is hard to say where the end might be. It is observable, that every man, rich
<PB N="118" REF="126"/>and poor, when they are in distress, if they enjoy the exercise of their rea∣son, <HI>want to bring over the Deity to their interest:</HI>—but often the means that they make use of to accomplish their end, deserve to be classed a∣mong the number of <HI>their provoca∣tions.</HI> —No man ought to ask from God what will ruin another: for when the <HI>Almighty</HI> gives a favour to one, it does not incapacitate him to give another man the same, if he knows he stands in need of it. <HI>Curses,</HI> above all things, are most disagreeable to a good and merciful God.—What, O <HI>Balak,</HI> didst thou mean, to send for a pro∣phet to curse a people that had not yet injured thee? Good God! what would become of thy <HI>Israel,</HI> if the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Moab</HI> had power? They would be all destroyed in a moment.</P>
<PB N="119" REF="127"/>
<P>It is well for the world that God is the supreme governor of it, whose <HI>laws are love, and his government mercy.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Moab</HI> must have been very ignorant of the character of that God that rules the universe, to think that he had not an equal good-will to the same works of his hands.—Perhaps he had been taught the doctrine of a good and evil genius: one that could curse and another that could bless. At this time he wanted the aid of the evil genius, to distribute <HI>maledictions</HI> among a people he was afraid of. Fear and hatred are very closely allied, <HI>quisquis timet quanquam est intactus &amp; odit.</HI></P>
<P>When matters go on pleasantly with wicked men, they forget their God; but when they find their own incapacity to bear their burdens, they would wil∣lingly
<PB N="120" REF="128"/><HI>throw them upon the Almighty.</HI> —This they do not out of love, but fear.</P>
<P>There are many men in the world that have the same opinion of <HI>God,</HI> that they have of the <HI>Devil;</HI>—that he is disposed to do ill to them that are his enemies. Their notions of good and evil are much the same, and there∣fore their <HI>God</HI> and their <HI>Devil</HI> must have the same character. Their no∣tions of good are, <HI>that it is fit they do what they please, without punishment,</HI> and follow the bent of their own in∣clination with impunity.—And they mean no more by evil, than punish∣ment for their offences. It is goodness to suffer them to continue as they are, and it is evil to interrupt them in the gratification of their <HI>appetites</HI> and <HI>pas∣sions.</HI> Virtue is not good to them, and
<PB N="121" REF="129"/>vice evil; but <HI>punishment is evil, and impunity good.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Moab</HI> and his pro∣phet <HI>Balaam</HI> have now the character of some <HI>demon</HI> in their eye.—He must curse <HI>Israel,</HI> or he does nothing. What malignity must there be in some men's temper, that they cannot rest satisfied, but with the destruction of their fellow-creatures? Had thy children, <HI>Balak,</HI> all died in that battle where thy friend <HI>Balaam</HI> fell, and all his children pe∣rished with himself, the world would have had no cause to lament the loss. But the case is otherwise. Thy off∣spring, like <HI>Pharaoh's locusts,</HI> over∣spread all the kingdoms of <HI>Europe.</HI> From <HI>thee</HI> and thy prophet <HI>Balaam,</HI> statesmen have learned to curse their enemies, and to ask the aid of <HI>pro∣phets</HI> to support their cause. From <HI>Ba∣laam</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="130"/>churches have taken the hint of devoting such to <HI>eternal destruction,</HI> as will not join in their common creed, to support <HI>the common craft.</HI> How has the name of the <HI>Deity</HI> been profaned by malevolent invocations, to curse thou∣sands that have been dear in his sight? The <HI>leaders of state and church policy</HI> have ever acted upon the same prin∣ciple. What cannot be so easily ef∣fected by reason and strength of argu∣ment, has often been obtained by <HI>curses and church anathemas.</HI></P>
<P>It is a long time since <HI>statesmen</HI> have found need of the assistance of <HI>some Deity,</HI> and <HI>churchmen</HI> have pretended interest enough to procure it,—yet the first have often <HI>been disappointed,</HI> and the latter <HI>found to be liars.</HI> The God of this universe has more mercy and goodness, than to hear the prayers of
<PB N="123" REF="131"/>either civil or religious <HI>politicians,</HI> who only make use of his assistance to serve their <HI>own pride and ambition.</HI> Worldly interest has ever been the <HI>chief bond of alliance</HI> between <HI>churchmen</HI> and <HI>states∣men,</HI>—and to serve this <HI>pious purpose</HI> they have abused both the characters <HI>of God and the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>We can find authentic accounts of two parties near <HI>Dunbar,</HI> in the time of the <HI>usurpation,</HI> ready to shed one another's blood <HI>in the name of the Lord,</HI> —and both confidently assured of suc∣cess, by their <HI>prophets</HI> that consulted their <HI>oracles.</HI> Could it be the God of heaven that <HI>these enthusiasts</HI> consulted, and from whom they affirmed they had received assurance of success? If so, they must either have mistaken his meaning, or he deceived some of them. I am afraid the prophets were like <HI>Ba∣laam</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="132"/>and the rulers like <HI>Balak,</HI> who went to curse their enemies, but God turned it unto a blessing;—not for the deserts <HI>of them that prospered,</HI> but for the <HI>impertinence</HI> and <HI>impiety of them who suffered.</HI></P>
<P>There seems to be one reason why wicked men in the time of difficulty seek the assistance of some <HI>invisible Deity:</HI>—they chuse not to have it thought that they depend upon any <HI>visible agent.</HI> All men in the time of prosperity affect a sort of <HI>independence,</HI> and would be <HI>Deities if they could.</HI> When distress comes upon them, they are stimulated by pride, not to acknow∣ledge their dependance upon such as they have accounted their inferiors:— they betake themselves therefore to some <HI>invisible Divinity,</HI> which their con∣sciences tell them <HI>some-where existeth,</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="133"/>but which they have neglected to ac∣knowledge till distress urged them to it. They only give up their no∣tions of <HI>independence,</HI> when they can no longer support them <HI>with any credit.</HI> —This is the most honourable way of retreating they can think on, to ac∣knowledge a power which they would willingly suppose the rest of mankind have <HI>not so much interest with as them∣selves.</HI></P>
<P>Thus wicked men change <HI>atheism</HI> for <HI>hypocrisy:</HI>—for when they find themselves under some necessity to ac∣knowledge a <HI>Deity,</HI> they at the same time incline to monopolize his favour, and pretend they are <HI>his greatest in∣timates:</HI>—when at the same time they rather make use of these pretences to serve their own ends and purposes,
<PB N="126" REF="134"/>than sincerely behave as the <HI>friends of God.</HI></P>
<P>When men are obliged to renounce any degree of their own <HI>independence,</HI> they would willingly do it with as much regard to their <HI>notions of dignity</HI> as they could,—and it is for this reason when they are disposed to depend upon the <HI>Almighty,</HI> that they always incline to make the world believe that <HI>Him</HI> and <HI>them are very familiar:</HI>—that though they dare not consider themselves his superior, yet they would willingly be <HI>as near equal to him</HI> as they possibly could. Hence it is, that false <HI>prophets</HI> and <HI>en∣thusiasts</HI> of all sorts have always given out what influence they had with their <HI>Divinities,</HI> that one would almost con∣clude, that they durst not do any thing without <HI>their good leave,</HI> nor refuse any
<PB N="127" REF="135"/>thing <HI>they had a mind to ask.</HI> Such an opinion as this <HI>Balak</HI> seems to have had of the <HI>false prophet Balaam:</HI>— for, says he, <HI>whom thou blessest is bles∣sed; and whom thou cursest is cursed.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>prophet</HI> affected <HI>Divinity</HI> as as long as he could,—till the <HI>Al∣mighty</HI> made him understand that his divinations were under his controul, and then he was obliged to confess that he <HI>could do nothing beyond the command∣ment of the Lord.</HI> Mankind in general make as great a secret of their <HI>depen∣dance</HI> upon God as they possibly can, and in the capital points of their <HI>de∣pendance,</HI> pretend that none knows it <HI>but God and themselves.</HI> This seems to be the reason why some <HI>devout people</HI> do not consider intercourse with God <HI>as a common privilege,</HI> but peculiar to
<PB N="128" REF="136"/>themselves, <HI>as the favourites of heaven.</HI> If men were entirely satisfied in their own minds with their <HI>dependance</HI> upon God, they would make no secret of it, but humbly confess it on every oc∣casion:—but when they want to wrap it up <HI>in mysticism,</HI> and conceal it under <HI>some form of divination,</HI> it still says they are not satisfied, whatever they pre∣tend. It seems to be more the dis∣position of mankind to be <HI>Divinities,</HI> than to seek after intercourse with God. The heathens had a <HI>ruling propensity</HI> of this sort;—they affected divine ho∣nours, and wanted to be accounted <HI>Deities;</HI> yet this was seldom conferred upon them <HI>till after they were dead.</HI> —And the reason seems to have been, that there were so many affecting the same thing, that they could not en∣dure a <HI>Divinity</HI> they saw with their
<PB N="129" REF="137"/>eyes in their own nature, because it so far destroyed <HI>every man's private opi∣nion of self-dependance.</HI></P>
<P>It will be found, upon strict enquiry into the human heart, that the same ambition that excited our <HI>first parents</HI> to seek to be as Gods, makes all <HI>their posterity,</HI> while they are not governed by the influence of the <HI>gospel,</HI> to af∣fect the same thing. When the mind is once perverted, no man will seek to be virtuous <HI>of his own accord:</HI>—and unless he be persuaded by <HI>arguments</HI> that are more powerful than his pre∣judices, he will continue in the same condition into which he was seduced.</P>
<P>I was observing, that the human mind is some way or other formed for <HI>re∣ligion.</HI>—This is evident upon occasions; which shews, that whatever perversity
<PB N="130" REF="138"/>may be in it by <HI>seduction,</HI> its original form was quite the reverse. The in∣fidelity of the mind does not arise from its nature, but from an evil seed, <HI>that was sown by an enemy,</HI> which, when it grows up, over-rules <HI>the springs of action,</HI> and causeth men to act unnatu∣rally.</P>
<P>There is nothing more unnatural than <HI>atheism</HI> and <HI>infidelity:</HI> for both <HI>the works and word of God</HI> do teach us, that <HI>dependance</HI> upon the <HI>Almighty is the language of nature.</HI> Till the mind be rightly informed, she is in∣capable of forming <HI>right moral prin∣ciples,</HI> and without the benefit of re∣velation will either fall into <HI>superstition</HI> or <HI>enthusiasm,</HI> if not into <HI>infidelity:</HI>— but this is a perversion of nature, and not the original design of the mind. When men so far depart from the first
<PB N="131" REF="139"/>principles of nature as to affect <HI>inde∣pendency,</HI> the reason is, they are <HI>cor∣rupted and perverted. Danger</HI> or <HI>af∣fliction</HI> will produce feelings which will stagger men's notions of <HI>self-dependance,</HI> but unless they are set right by <HI>di∣vine revelation,</HI> they will land in <HI>su∣perstition</HI> and <HI>enthusiasm.</HI> The reason why the heathens fell so grossly into <HI>superstition,</HI> was, they wanted a guide to reform their minds from that per∣versity of temper that all men are pos∣sessed of, till <HI>revelation</HI> discover to them the errors of their hearts.</P>
<P>At the same time that men are at∣tempting to seduce others, and endea∣vouring to support superstition, they are often insensibly <HI>themselves infected with the same distemper.—Balak,</HI> who no doubt attempted to impose upon the people of <HI>Moah</HI> the foolish <HI>superstition</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="140"/>of these times, <HI>as a tool of state,</HI> and <HI>an engine of government, was himself in∣fected with the same delusion.</HI>—He applies to <HI>Balaam</HI> for his aid in the time of his distress. This <HI>Balaam</HI> seems to have been a man of great repute among the superstitious people of these parts. I observed already, that most likely he was one of the <HI>Eastern Magi,</HI> one who pretended intimacy with <HI>some Di∣vinity,</HI> —who needed only some few compliments paid to him, and then would work wonders in favour of his friends. One would think that the <HI>Eastern Kings</HI> had not been very in∣timate with their <HI>deities,</HI> when they had so far to send for a <HI>mediator:</HI>— perhaps in these times <HI>Kings had other business to mind than religion, unless upon very special occasions,</HI> and were therefore not so well acquainted with the manner of addressing the <HI>deities.</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="141"/>Be this as it will, <HI>Balak</HI> sent <HI>messen∣gers</HI> to <HI>Balaam,</HI> to come to him to curse a people he was much afraid of. The curse was perhaps some form of <HI>incantation,</HI> that was usual in these times, which ignorant people believed was powerful to hurt their <HI>enemies;</HI> —yet might for all that be innocent enough to every person whatsoever, ex∣cept the <HI>persons</HI> who used it.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Moab</HI> seems to have had some confidence in <HI>Balaam</HI>'s abi∣lities, and also knew what would be the <HI>best excitement</HI> for him to exercise <HI>them.</HI>— He promises him <HI>honours,</HI> and very liberal <HI>rewards.</HI>—If the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Moab</HI> was not well acquainted with the disposition of the <HI>Deity,</HI> he seems to have known mankind <HI>tolerably:</HI>— at least, he seems to have known <HI>Ba∣laam</HI>'s leading principle. Perhaps the
<PB N="134" REF="142"/><HI>prophet</HI>'s character was well known, as a man that never chose to work <HI>for nothing,</HI>—and <HI>Balak</HI> might learn this from <HI>report.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>prophet</HI> seemed well-disposed at first to serve the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Moab,</HI> for the <HI>considerations</HI> proposed to him, but had one <HI>objection</HI> in his way,—that tho' he <HI>would,</HI> he <HI>could not</HI> get over it. It is likely he had found by <HI>experience</HI> that there was a supreme <HI>agent,</HI> that upon occasions had interrupted the in∣fluence of his <HI>divinations;—Him</HI> he wanted first to consult, lest upon trial he should come off with disgrace in the middle of his <HI>enterprize.</HI>—He goes first to consult the <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P>When men go to ask the mind of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> with their hearts <HI>fully bent</HI> upon their <HI>own purposes,</HI> it is no
<PB N="135" REF="143"/>great wonder if they receive an an∣swer not <HI>quite favourable</HI> to their <HI>in∣clinations.</HI> God who knows all things, well knew with what intention his sup∣plicant at this time did address him; —not with a full resolution to <HI>submit</HI> to <HI>his will,</HI> but with a desire that God would favour <HI>his designs</HI> at <HI>all events.</HI> He was forbidden <HI>to go</HI> with <HI>Balak's messengers,</HI>—which was not a pleasing answer to a man that loved the <HI>wages of unrighteousness. Balak</HI> behaved to∣wards the <HI>prophet,</HI> as the <HI>prophet</HI> did towards <HI>his maker.</HI>—He tried him <HI>again.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Moab</HI> had indeed better reason to urge <HI>Balaam,</HI> than the <HI>pro∣phet</HI> had to be <HI>instant</HI> with the <HI>Al∣mighty.</HI>— This covetous <HI>prophet</HI> had shew∣ed his <HI>good inclination</HI> to <HI>serve him,</HI> but told he <HI>could not:</HI>—and what did <HI>Ba∣lak</HI> know but the <HI>Deity</HI> might change <HI>his mind,</HI> and by <HI>importunity</HI> yield to
<PB N="136" REF="144"/><HI>Balaam's entreaties.</HI> The heathen no∣tions of <HI>God</HI> differed <HI>but little</HI> from their notions of <HI>men.</HI>—But <HI>Balaam</HI> knew that he had received an express answer in the <HI>negative,</HI> and behaved <HI>presumptuously</HI> in importuning his <HI>maker.</HI>—It would seem that he wanted to insult his <HI>maker</HI> into his design. He tries him <HI>again.</HI> —Ah! what <HI>impiety</HI> to ask what God had <HI>peremptorily</HI> refused! <HI>But there was money and honour in the case,</HI> which to a mind like <HI>Balaam</HI>'s were strong rea∣sons of conduct.—</P>
<P>But it is wonderful that <HI>any man</HI> not quite metamorphosed into a <HI>devil,</HI> could ask the <HI>Almighty</HI> for liberty to curse his own creatures. Such an address to God could not well be expected to re∣ceive any other answer <HI>but a refusal.</HI> Will a <HI>good, gracious,</HI> and <HI>merciful</HI> God hear the prayers of a man that breaths
<PB N="137" REF="145"/>nothing but <HI>curses</HI> and <HI>ruin</HI> to a peo∣ple that had never injured him? Had this prophet been <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> or a <HI>member</HI> of <HI>some modern associations,</HI> we might perhaps have concluded that he meant <HI>to save their souls,</HI> by giving <HI>their flesh</HI> to the <HI>devil:</HI> but <HI>church authority</HI> was not likely <HI>then</HI> known in that eastern part of the world. Per∣haps the <HI>church rulers</HI> in after-times <HI>took the hint</HI> from <HI>Balaam,</HI> in their ex∣communicating people they did <HI>not like,</HI> or <HI>were afraid of.</HI> The <HI>prophet</HI>'s me∣thod of cursing would no doubt be pretended to be clothed <HI>with divine authority,</HI> and accounted a <HI>religious act</HI> among these eastern <HI>superstitious</HI> nations.</P>
<P>The <HI>prophet</HI> was at last permitted to go with the <HI>messengers</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Moab,</HI> but with a <HI>restraint</HI> upon <HI>him</HI> that did not well <HI>suit</HI> his <HI>temper.</HI> Like
<PB N="138" REF="146"/>all people who are vicious, if once humour them, they aspire after more <HI>indulgence. Balaam</HI> expected, that as God had permitted him <HI>to go</HI> with <HI>Ba∣lak</HI>'s <HI>messengers,</HI> that <HI>he</HI> would also al∣low <HI>him</HI> to do <HI>what he desired,</HI> when he came to the appointed place of ex∣ercise.— But as he was not disposed to be obedient to the commandment of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> his maker intended to <HI>teach him better behaviour,</HI> by a <HI>severe reproof</HI> and <HI>disappointment.</HI> He sent <HI>his angel</HI> to resist him,—who stood in <HI>his way,</HI> and intercepted <HI>his march.</HI></P>
<P>No doubt, our prophet's heart was full of the hopes of the <HI>rewards</HI> and <HI>honours</HI> that the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Moab</HI> would advance him to, should he succeed in his enterprize.—Perhaps he was <HI>telling over in his mind</HI> the <HI>large sums</HI> of <HI>mo∣ney</HI> he should bring back with him,
<PB N="139" REF="147"/>and the <HI>particular honours</HI> that all the <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Moab</HI> should <HI>confer</HI> upon him; —and how <HI>all</HI> the <HI>men</HI> of <HI>the East</HI> should <HI>reverence him</HI> as one of the grea∣test <HI>intimates</HI> of the <HI>Divinity.</HI> No <HI>Bi∣shop</HI> that ever sat in <HI>convocation,</HI> per∣haps, had greater expectations than <HI>Father Balaam,</HI>—when on a sudden his ass started aside, and almost laid <HI>her rider in the dirt.</HI> The <HI>ass was frighted,</HI> and it was no wonder,—for she saw what was <HI>invisible</HI> to her <HI>master. —An angel stood in her way.</HI></P>
<P>What this <HI>angel</HI> was <HI>clothed</HI> with, or what <HI>visive faculty</HI> was conferred upon the <HI>ass,</HI> I shall leave to the <HI>cri∣tics:</HI> —but she <HI>saw something,</HI> which could not be a <HI>spirit,</HI> for <HI>divines</HI> say that they are <HI>invisible.</HI>—But that's not all, <HI>she started again,</HI> and went <HI>quite,</HI> off her <HI>tract</HI> into the <HI>field.</HI>—To inrerrupt
<PB N="140" REF="148"/>a man in his journey, who was <HI>bent</HI> upon it, in hopes of coming back laden with <HI>riches</HI> and <HI>honour,</HI> was <HI>highly pro∣voking.</HI> —The offence was the greater, as the <HI>prophet was in haste:</HI>—we cannot suppose him otherwise, for he <HI>loved the wages of unrighteousness.</HI> Again! there is no accounting for <HI>as∣ses</HI> when <HI>they</HI> turn <HI>giddy;</HI>—she rushed against the wall; and as the <HI>prophet</HI> seems to have ridden after the <HI>usual manner</HI> of <HI>prophets,</HI> we may easily sup∣pose that one of his <HI>legs</HI> was in <HI>no good condition. She crushed his foot a∣gainst the wall.</HI> Truly this is no good <HI>omen,</HI>—there is some reason to fear the issue of <HI>this affair.</HI> The ass is made to <HI>pay soundly</HI> for being so giddy.— The <HI>prophet</HI> had a <HI>staff</HI> which the <HI>ass</HI> would no doubt have remembered as long as <HI>she lived,</HI> had <HI>she</HI> not been an <HI>ass:</HI>—he laboured her with it to bring
<PB N="141" REF="149"/>her to a sense of <HI>her duty.</HI>—The <HI>pro∣phet</HI> seems to have been <HI>old</HI> that he rode with <HI>a staff,</HI> otherwise he ought to have had <HI>a whip.</HI> The <HI>prophet</HI> grows <HI>serious,</HI> but the <HI>ass more so,—she opened her mouth,</HI> as she had no doubt <HI>many times</HI> done <HI>before,</HI> but in a very <HI>different manner: she spoke</HI> by the im∣mediate <HI>agency</HI> of <HI>heaven.</HI>—It is said the <HI>Lord opened the mouth of the ass.</HI> The language of <HI>asses</HI> is very ready to <HI>surprize</HI> them that are not acquainted with <HI>it,</HI> as their <HI>dialect</HI> is none of the <HI>finest;</HI>—but to speak in <HI>human stile</HI> was enough to have frightened <HI>any man</HI> out of <HI>his senses.</HI>—Perhaps any man but <HI>Ba∣laam</HI> would have <HI>fainted;</HI> but his mind was too full of <HI>riches</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> to be <HI>easily affected.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>prophet's ass</HI> spake like <HI>herself</HI> in all things but <HI>the stile. Am not I
<PB N="142" REF="150"/>thine ass?</HI> Poor humble creature! she had served him long enough for <HI>such a reward;</HI>—he beat <HI>her,</HI> and told her if he had a <HI>sword,</HI> he would <HI>kill her.</HI> Had she got the exercise of <HI>reason</HI> with the <HI>use</HI> of <HI>language,</HI> she would have undoubtedly changed her <HI>master,</HI> and left <HI>his service.</HI> The use of language, without a right exercise of reason, is not a <HI>very high attainment.</HI>—An <HI>ass</HI> may speak, but is still <HI>an ass.</HI> Our <HI>ass</HI>'s master was like many since his time, who forgot <HI>good services</HI> for a very <HI>small offence:</HI>—nay, if strictly ex∣amined, it was a piece of <HI>faithful ser∣vice,</HI> for it saved the <HI>prophet's life.</HI> How many have served their country faithfully for many years, that have been <HI>served</HI> like the <HI>prophet's ass</HI>—got <HI>blows</HI> and <HI>threatening</HI> for their <HI>ser∣vice,</HI> instead of <HI>any reward</HI> or <HI>prefer∣ment?</HI> Many <HI>invisible agents</HI> are watch∣ing
<PB N="143" REF="151"/>the motions of <HI>the wicked</HI> and <HI>un∣godly man;</HI>—when he is riding <HI>post∣haste</HI> to dishonour his <HI>maker,</HI> though he does not see the <HI>invisible agent</HI> that withstands <HI>him,</HI> the <HI>animal</HI> that car∣ries <HI>may,</HI> by <HI>signatures</HI> we cannot ac∣count for. It is easy for <HI>one</HI> of these <HI>heavenly messengers</HI> to dismount the <HI>best rider</HI> that ever mounted a steed.—When some <HI>merciless wretch</HI> is posting to ful∣fil the ends of his <HI>cruelty;</HI> when some <HI>ambitious covetous usurer</HI> is riding <HI>full speed</HI> to receive the <HI>wages of unrigh∣teousness,</HI> and to distress the <HI>widow</HI> and the <HI>fatherless,</HI> and is found <HI>dead</HI> at his <HI>horse's feet,</HI>—who knows but some of these <HI>invisible agents,</HI> out of <HI>pity</HI> to mankind, are the instruments of ven∣geance upon these <HI>incorrigible sinners.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>prophet</HI>'s punishment as <HI>yet</HI> is not equal to <HI>his crime.</HI>—He went with

<P>Such as are acquainted with the <HI>po∣litical reasons</HI> of the several <HI>prophets</HI> and <HI>teachers</HI> of mankind in <HI>some churches,</HI> do perhaps know that when they took upon them <HI>to anathematize</HI> their bre∣thren, they had the <HI>same reasons</HI> for <HI>their conduct</HI> that <HI>Father Balaam</HI> had; —to get all the <HI>gain</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> by <HI>it</HI> they could.

<PB N="168" REF="176"/>and <HI>hold by them,</HI> have much more knowledge of religion than the most <HI>zealous devotees</HI> of <HI>creeds</HI> and <HI>ar∣ticles.</HI></P>
<P>One cannot but be sorry to find our <HI>Saviour</HI> brought in as a <HI>patron</HI> for <HI>mo∣dern creed-making;</HI>—for we are told, that he hath sanctified the <HI>use of them</HI> by <HI>his own repeated practice.</HI>—Because he demanded a <HI>confession of faith</HI> from such as he intended to confer any <HI>signal favour upon;</HI> and often said, <HI>"Believest "thou this?</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Saviour,</HI> no doubt, required a <HI>confession of faith</HI> from whom <HI>he</HI> had a mind, as the <HI>King</HI> in <HI>his church,</HI> and <HI>the Lord</HI> of <HI>the consciences,</HI> and always required them to believe <HI>in himself,</HI> as both the <HI>object</HI> and <HI>author</HI> of <HI>faith.</HI> But the practice of our <HI>Saviour</HI> in <HI>this
<PB N="169" REF="177"/>particular</HI> is no argument for <HI>human creeds.</HI> It may perhaps be an argument for requiring <HI>a belief</HI> in <HI>the scriptures,</HI> but can be none for requiring <HI>our as∣sent</HI> to <HI>human compositions.</HI>—Besides, we are told by the <HI>same author,</HI> that <HI>such confessions</HI> were <HI>introductions</HI> to <HI>miracles,</HI> and must have ceased <HI>long ago,</HI> as <HI>mi∣racles</HI> have done.—Taking the argu∣ment for <HI>creeds</HI> in his own way, he must either give up the practice of <HI>creed-making,</HI> or <HI>work miracles.</HI> Whatever <HI>plausible arguments</HI> may be offered for <HI>church power,</HI> and <HI>the alliance</HI> between <HI>church</HI> and <HI>state,</HI> yet after they are brought to <HI>their height,</HI> they end in <HI>infidelity.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>author</HI> above <HI>referred to,</HI> in stating a comparison between the <HI>power of the legislator</HI> in <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious affairs,</HI> affirms, <Q>That the <HI>legislator</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="178"/>“in <HI>religious societies</HI> is bound to observe the great <HI>charter</HI> of christian liberty, and never to depart from <HI>the prin∣ciples</HI> which <HI>it</HI> contains.

This is giving up the <HI>perfection</HI> of the <HI>scriptures</HI> at once, and giving to the <HI>civil magistrate</HI> a <HI>power</HI> to make up <HI>its deficiency.</HI></P>
<P>But we are told, <Q>to such a power “men <HI>must submit,</HI> or they <HI>must give ”up</HI> the <HI>benefit</HI> of <HI>society</HI> in <HI>religion.</HI></Q> A reader of the <HI>New Testament</HI> will
<PB N="171" REF="179"/>see <HI>no occasion</HI> for <HI>this.</HI> The <HI>benefits</HI> of <HI>society</HI> in religion do not depend <HI>upon power,</HI> but <HI>upon will.</HI> Men that are truly religious have all the benefits of <HI>society</HI> they desire, and they need <HI>no power</HI> to make them good members in society but the power <HI>of truth.</HI> If by <HI>the benefits</HI> of <HI>society</HI> in religion be meant <HI>large benefices,</HI> and <HI>emoluments secured to them</HI> by the power of the <HI>magistrate;</HI>—these christians do not ex∣pect, but leave them to the children of the <HI>kingdoms</HI> of this <HI>world,</HI> or whom they may concern. All they want is <HI>permission</HI> and <HI>toleration</HI> to serve God in their <HI>own way,</HI> according to the <HI>dic∣tates</HI> of their <HI>own consciences,</HI> as the <HI>word of God directs them.</HI></P>
<P>But we are told, <Q><HI>as single chris∣tians,</HI> “or <HI>individuals,</HI> they may enjoy <HI>the right</HI> of <HI>judging</HI> for <HI>themselves,</HI>

<PB N="173" REF="181"/>his fears very needless, <Q>that men will “grow ignorant of religion when they have the use of <HI>the bible.</HI>" "But tho' they have the <HI>bible,</HI> they have not a <HI>stated call to use it,</HI> without <HI>a suf∣ficient ”provision</HI> to excite them to it.</Q> And where is the virtue of all this? To serve God only <HI>for money.</HI> This is the way to make <HI>hypocrites</HI> and <HI>pharisees,</HI> but not to make <HI>christians.</HI> But may not christians make provision for <HI>themselves,</HI> that they shall be instructed, by chu∣sing from among <HI>themselves fit</HI> and <HI>qua∣lified</HI> persons to preside in their wor∣ship, and support them by their own liberality, if the <HI>state</HI> will not support <HI>them</HI> without bringing <HI>them</HI> under <HI>it power.</HI> But then our author will tell us, <Q>that all the advantages of <HI>pub∣lic</HI> “and <HI>social</HI> religion must be lost, or it must be men's duty to join in ”society for obtaining of <HI>those advan∣tages.</HI></Q>
<PB N="174" REF="182"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 63.</NOTE> The advantages of society can never be lost, when men endeavour to edify one another in love, upon the <HI>principles of the gospel.</HI>—They may lose <HI>those advantages</HI> that increase <HI>pride</HI> and promote <HI>luxury,</HI> which to <HI>pharisees</HI> will be accounted the <HI>greatest loss,</HI> but to them is no loss at all, but what they have laid their account with. We are told, and with great propriety, <Q>that “for obtaining those advantages,—this necessarily leads to the appointment of a power, to provide for the wants of society, one of the chief of which is the means of <HI>public instruction</HI> in the truths of religion. <HI>Fit persons</HI> must be appointed to convey these instructions: and if <HI>fit persons,</HI> then there must be <HI>some</HI> to judge of their ”<HI>fitness.</HI></Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> This power is only neces∣sary to secure <HI>those advantages</HI> our au∣thor
<PB N="175" REF="183"/>has all along in his view. Where must this power be lodged? Or who are the proper persons to judge of men's fitness to teach and edify one an∣other? There can be no power ap∣pointed but what is already appointed by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who has plainly in <HI>his gospel</HI> told us what sort of persons they must be that assume this office of teaching.

<PB N="176" REF="184"/>depend upon <HI>his promise,</HI> and are com∣manded to do so. Such as trust the promise of God will see no cause to appoint a power to provide for their instruction, which <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles</HI> have <HI>no where</HI> given to any order of men since their time.</P>
<P>It would appear that our dignified church guides do account <HI>us asses indeed,</HI> —who think that we cannot know the way of religion pointed out in the scrip∣tures without <HI>their manufacture.</HI> This much may be said to <HI>their praise,</HI> that common christians are more obliged to any common <HI>school-master</HI> that learneth them to <HI>read</HI> than to <HI>them.</HI> A chris∣tian is not much to mean that has the bible in his hand,—and without any derogation from their dignity may learn more out of it, by a careful perusal, than from all the <HI>waggon loads of di∣vinity</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="185"/>the world hath been blessed with since the <HI>council of Nice.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to that power that is supposed to be given to some select wortlty persons, in the use of which they take care of the <HI>instruction of mankind,</HI> it may be asked whether those who confer it have not a right to take it from them, in case it should not be exercised for those purposes for which it was granted? Suppose a teacher hath <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> different livings conferred upon him, is he not engaged to <HI>teach</HI> and <HI>instruct</HI> the <HI>several congregations</HI> they belong to? And is it possible he can do <HI>this</HI> in <HI>his own person?</HI> And if he cannot, who gave him a right to do it <HI>by proxy?</HI> Christians would certainly expect <HI>some warrant</HI> for <HI>such a practice</HI> from the <HI>word of God.</HI> If any pre∣tend that they have <HI>power</HI> to do it,
<PB N="178" REF="186"/>we would also want to understand if it is founded <HI>in justice.</HI> It cannot be supposed that a congregation of chris∣tians are like a <HI>man's children,</HI> whom he has a right to appoint a <HI>tutor over,</HI> as not being yet <HI>fit</HI> to chuse for <HI>them∣selves;</HI>—for for they are supposed to be persons of understanding, and church members, and no man can chuse their pastors for them but themselves. It is supposing them to be asses to do other∣wise.</P>
<P>This supposed power is far from an∣swering the end it is assumed for; for if <HI>fact</HI> and <HI>experience</HI> can be any <HI>proof</HI> of any thing <HI>answering</HI> or <HI>not answer∣ing</HI> its end, it is plain that in <HI>some places</HI> of the nation the people are quite igno∣rant of the <HI>first principles</HI> of <HI>religion.</HI> If there were <HI>school-masters</HI> in the place of <HI>another sort of teachers,</HI> to teach the
<PB N="179" REF="187"/>common people to <HI>read</HI> the <HI>scriptures,</HI> and to point out their <HI>excellencies</HI> to them, there would be more religious knowledge in several parts of the na∣tion than there is. When any power does not answer the end it is assumed for, <HI>it ought to cease</HI> upon the very principles it is assumed.—But when it is assumed without <HI>any warrant</HI> from the <HI>word of God,</HI> it ought never to be acknowledged.</P>
<P>Though our <HI>Saviour</HI> plainly declared before <HI>Pontius Pilate that his kingdom is not of this world,</HI> there have been <HI>some late attempts made</HI> to prove that <HI>it is;</HI> and we are told that our <HI>Lord's testimony</HI> does not prove that <HI>Caesar</HI> had <HI>no right</HI> to <HI>interfere in religious matters. Caesar</HI> might interfere with any religion that pertained to the <HI>kingdoms of this world</HI> as he had a mind;—but how
<PB N="180" REF="188"/>could he <HI>interfere</HI> in a <HI>kingdom</HI> that was not of this world? It lay altoge∣ther beyond his <HI>jurisdiction.</HI> Our Sa∣viour could not have spoken in more <HI>express terms</HI> that <HI>Caesar</HI> had nothing to do with <HI>his kingdom,</HI> than by saying that it did not pertain to <HI>this world;</HI> for he had <HI>jurisdiction</HI> in <HI>no kingdom</HI> but in such as pertained <HI>to it.</HI></P>
<P>It has been several times affirmed, that our <HI>Lord's testimony</HI> before <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> does not decide the <HI>right</HI> of the <HI>magistrate's power</HI> over the <HI>church.</HI> But let this <HI>testimony</HI> be considered as <HI>common sense</HI> would direct any <HI>plain man</HI> to understand it. <HI>Jesus answered, my kingdom is not of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.—Pilate there∣fore said unto him, art thou a king then?
<PB N="181" REF="189"/>Jesus answered, thou sayest that I am a king: to this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness of the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</HI></P>
<P>Any one may observe at first view here, that <HI>Christ</HI> confesseth himself to be a <HI>King,</HI> and that he had a <HI>kingdom:</HI> that his <HI>kingdom is not of this world.</HI> Whatever kind of <HI>kingdom</HI> this may be, no magistrate can have any jurisdiction over it, without being considered a King above <HI>Christ.</HI> If <HI>Caesar</HI> had any <HI>juris∣diction</HI> over the <HI>church,</HI> to <HI>govern it,</HI> then <HI>Christ</HI> could not be <HI>King</HI> in <HI>that kingdom,</HI> but <HI>Caesar.</HI>—At least it must be supposed that <HI>Caesar,</HI> or the <HI>civil ma∣gistrate,</HI> whoever <HI>he is,</HI> has power over the <HI>church,</HI> either with <HI>Christ's leave</HI> or <HI>without it.</HI> If without <HI>Christ's leave</HI> and <HI>order,</HI> then is the <HI>magistrate</HI> the
<PB N="182" REF="190"/><HI>head</HI> of the <HI>church;</HI>—but if with <HI>his leave,</HI> then <HI>this</HI> should be produced from the <HI>New Testament.</HI> It is a reflection that both our <HI>Saviour's testimony</HI> and the <HI>nature of the thing</HI> doth suggest, that there can be no authority either <HI>in</HI> or <HI>over his church,</HI> but what he hath appointed by his <HI>own authority.</HI> If the <HI>magistrate</HI> have any power over the <HI>church,</HI> he must shew <HI>his instructions for it</HI> from him who says <HI>he is a King, and for that end came into the world.</HI></P>
<P>It is affirmed; <Q>If human power be “in <HI>any degree necessary</HI> for the <HI>govern∣ment</HI> of the <HI>church, that power</HI> must be left in the hands of the <HI>civil ma∣gistrate,</HI> to whom all human power <HI>naturally belongs,</HI> and to whom <HI>our Lord</HI> here <HI>declares,</HI> that he leaves it ”in its <HI>full extent.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay on Establishments, p. 69.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="183" REF="191"/>
<P>But this conclusion is ruined with an <HI>if;</HI> for <HI>human power</HI> has no more to do with the <HI>government of the church of Christ,</HI> than the <HI>ministers</HI> of <HI>Christ's church</HI> have <HI>to be civil magistrates.</HI>— And they have no more connection with one another, than the <HI>kingdoms of this world</HI> have with the <HI>kingdom of heaven. Christ</HI> says, <HI>he came into the world and was born to be a King,</HI> and affirms, that <HI>his kingdom was not of this world.</HI> If he is <HI>King,</HI> then all the laws by which his <HI>church</HI> is governed must be of <HI>his own making;</HI> for he admits no <HI>partners</HI> with himself in legislation. He that <HI>adds to</HI> or <HI>diminisheth</HI> from the laws he hath made are guilty <HI>in his sight.</HI> The truths contained in <HI>the di∣vine record</HI> are <HI>the laws</HI> by which he rules the <HI>consciences</HI> of <HI>his people,</HI> and <HI>they</HI> cannot be subject to any <HI>human le∣gislation
<PB N="184" REF="192"/>in matters of religion.</HI> Even the christian's obedience to <HI>magistrates,</HI> as <HI>governors</HI> of <HI>civil society,</HI> is founded upon express scripture precept; <HI>Let e∣very soul be subject to the higher powers.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 1.</NOTE> —And it is because <HI>Christ</HI> by <HI>his A∣postles</HI> commanded <HI>christians</HI> to be obe∣dient to <HI>magistrates,</HI> that they are bound to obey them, and not because <HI>they themselves</HI> require it. So little power have <HI>magistrates over the church of God,</HI> to <HI>govern it,</HI> or <HI>make laws</HI> in <HI>it,</HI> that they have not even a title to civil re∣verence from christians, but what is <HI>founded upon Christ's authority.</HI></P>
<P>And may I not ask these <HI>zealous promoters</HI> of the <HI>power</HI> of the <HI>magistrate</HI> over the church, where do they find in the <HI>New Testament</HI> either <HI>precept</HI> or <HI>example</HI> for blending <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>sacred</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="193"/>things after <HI>this manner?</HI> What signifies what <HI>Hooker</HI> or <HI>all the men of the world say,</HI> if their sentiments are not founded upon the <HI>sacred oracles?</HI> — They can never have any weight among <HI>christians.</HI> They may, like the <HI>traditions of the jews,</HI> serve the purpose of the <HI>phari∣sees</HI> and <HI>scribes</HI> of <HI>national churches, to blind</HI> the <HI>minds</HI> of the <HI>ignorant,</HI>—and by <HI>that means</HI> keep them <HI>in subjection</HI> to their <HI>ghostly guides.</HI> But this will appear, to all who learn their religion from <HI>the Bible,</HI> of no more consequence than <HI>the trapping of Balaam's ass.</HI></P>
<P>It is no less than <HI>absurd</HI> to reason from <HI>Christ's spiritual power in the church,</HI> to the <HI>power</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in <HI>civil society,</HI> and imagine that men are <HI>e∣qually</HI> deprived of <HI>liberty</HI> to make al∣terations, or allowed <HI>to alter</HI> in each of <HI>these kingdoms.</HI>— The cases are <HI>quite dif∣ferent;
<PB N="186" REF="194"/>Christ</HI> hath given a <HI>perfect system</HI> of all <HI>doctrines</HI> and <HI>duties</HI> that relate to the <HI>salvation</HI> of <HI>men's souls,</HI> and <HI>re∣vealed all things</HI> that <HI>pertain</HI> to the <HI>conscience,</HI> that <HI>every man</HI> may <HI>judge for himself</HI> concerning those matters that <HI>they must answer for</HI> at <HI>the day of judg∣ment,</HI> as matters immediately respecting <HI>their faith</HI> and <HI>obedience</HI> to <HI>God him∣self.</HI> The laws of <HI>civil society</HI> have only a respect to the <HI>bodies of men,</HI> and can∣not extend beyond what pertains to <HI>the body.</HI>—The <HI>two kingdoms</HI> are just <HI>as different</HI> as the <HI>interests</HI> of <HI>men's souls and bodies are;</HI> and the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> of the laws of <HI>each society</HI> are <HI>as dif∣ferent</HI> from one another as <HI>body</HI> and <HI>spirit.</HI></P>
<P>There is a <HI>memorable passage</HI> in the above-mentioned <HI>Essay on Establishments,</HI> which shews the <HI>distress</HI> of the <HI>author</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="195"/>to form his <HI>political image</HI> of <HI>iron</HI> and <HI>clay.</HI>— <Q>They who in defence of <HI>reli∣gious “establishments</HI> require a <HI>gospel pre∣cedent,</HI> require what the <HI>nature of the thing</HI> does not <HI>admit of.</HI> The <HI>gospel</HI> contains the history <HI>only</HI> of the <HI>divine original of our religion,</HI> and <HI>leaves</HI> it before it had formed <HI>any human con∣nections.</HI> How then can the <HI>gospel</HI> furnish <HI>an example</HI> of <HI>such connection,</HI> or how can the want of the <HI>example</HI> ”be an <HI>argument</HI> against <HI>the connection?</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is a <HI>fair confession</HI> that there is <HI>no example</HI> of <HI>establishments</HI> in the <HI>New Testament;</HI>—but perhaps as strange a reason is given for <HI>this defect</HI> as ever <HI>entered into the heart of man to conceive.</HI> — <Q>The gospel history <HI>falls short</HI> and “comes not <HI>so far down</HI> as <HI>the forming</HI> of <HI>human connections,</HI> and leaves the ”matter <HI>unfinished.</HI></Q> But the question
<PB N="188" REF="196"/>is not, whether the gospel history <HI>of churches</HI> leaves <HI>religion</HI> before it <HI>formed connections with the world,</HI> but whether <HI>it leaves it</HI> before <HI>it was perfect.</HI> It would appear, that as <HI>this history</HI> mentions none of <HI>these connections,</HI> the <HI>author of it</HI> in∣tended there <HI>never</HI> should be any. If there is not a perfect account of reli∣gion in <HI>the gospel history,</HI> it is hard to say where we shall find any. And it is a <HI>sad reflection</HI> upon the <HI>wisdom</HI> of <HI>its author,</HI> to say it is deficient in such <HI>a momentous</HI> matter as the very <HI>consti∣tution of a church.</HI> We have as whim∣sical a reason given, why there is no <HI>precept</HI> concerning this point in the New Testament.—The author tells us <Q>it “”would have been useless.</Q>—For men, no doubt, were wise enough to under∣derstand <Q>that they might <HI>safely enjoy “peace</HI> under the <HI>protection of govern∣ment,</HI> and <HI>to unite their endeavours with
<PB N="189" REF="197"/>”it</HI> for the <HI>public good.</HI></Q> But may not men enjoy the protection of government and live peaceable, without <HI>joining to∣gether</HI> what Christ hath appointed <HI>to be kept distinct. Common sense</HI> will indeed teach men that they should <HI>enjoy peace</HI> when they can <HI>have it with a safe con∣science,</HI> and live as good subjects under <HI>any government</HI> that permits them to <HI>live</HI> and <HI>use</HI> their <HI>christian privileges;</HI> and the <HI>scripture</HI> teacheth the <HI>same thing:</HI>— but this does not say that they are at li∣berty to confound <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> mat∣ters. As subjects of civil government they are to mix with <HI>society,</HI> do the duties <HI>of men</HI> under the regulation of <HI>civil policy;</HI>—but as <HI>christians,</HI> they have <HI>another Lord,</HI> and are governed by <HI>a policy quite different.</HI> As members of <HI>a commonwealth,</HI> they will be willing to pay <HI>Caesar</HI> his <HI>due,</HI> and pray for <HI>all</HI> that <HI>have authority over them;</HI> the more
<PB N="190" REF="198"/>so that they are christians.—But in all matters of <HI>religion</HI> and <HI>conscience</HI> that are <HI>imposed</HI> upon them, they will say, <HI>whe∣ther is it lawful to obey God</HI> or <HI>man, judge ye.</HI> They will be ready to <HI>submit to providence</HI> and <HI>suffer,</HI> when they cannot prevail with men in power to let <HI>them alone,</HI> but will never <HI>comply</HI> at the ex∣pence of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>conscience.</HI></P>
<P>All that lies within the <HI>power</HI> of the <HI>civil magistrate,</HI> is to <HI>protect</HI> all <HI>his sub∣jects</HI> in the exercise of that religion they <HI>chuse</HI> for <HI>themselves;</HI> and as long as they continue <HI>good subjects,</HI> to give them <HI>his protection.</HI> But he has no right to interfere in directing men in their <HI>choice</HI> of <HI>religion,</HI> but to <HI>chuse his own.</HI></P>
<P>I do freely confess that the <HI>magi∣strate</HI> has an <HI>undoubted right</HI> even to

<P>To teach men from the <HI>scriptures,</HI> and put them in mind of the truths

<PB N="202" REF="210"/>from the usefulness of it to man∣kind; —for except among people of <HI>rank</HI> and <HI>learning,</HI> which are not ob∣tained by means of <HI>the clergy,</HI> there is not <HI>as little</HI> knowledge among <HI>any protestants,</HI> as among the <HI>common peo∣ple of England.—Multitudes</HI> cannot <HI>read</HI> the <HI>scriptures,</HI> nor have they the <HI>least</HI> understanding <HI>about religion,</HI> any <HI>more</HI> than to know <HI>a church</HI> from <HI>any other building.</HI>—And I dare affirm it <HI>safely,</HI> that even <HI>in proportion to numbers,</HI> that there are <HI>twenty</HI> for <HI>one of those</HI> mem∣bers of the <HI>church of England.</HI> How can it be <HI>otherwise,</HI> where men have <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four livings,</HI> and substitute any man they can hire <HI>cheapest</HI> to take care of the <HI>souls</HI> of the <HI>parishioners?</HI> Were the people instructed in the <HI>scriptures re∣gularly,</HI> and taught to read them <HI>distinctly</HI> thorough, they would receive <HI>some edi∣fication;</HI> but except <HI>some lessons here</HI>

<P>It will perhaps be inferred from what has been just now said, that I want to <HI>overturn</HI> the <HI>constitution</HI> of <HI>church</HI> and <HI>state</HI> altogether. Far from it. If we admit the present established church of <HI>England</HI> to be a <HI>part</HI> of the <HI>civil con∣stitution,</HI> I find no fault with <HI>her:</HI>— I believe she is as good as <HI>any other</HI> of <HI>the kind,</HI> and could not give place to a <HI>better.</HI>—But then I would not have her to pretend to be what she is not, <HI>a New Testament church.</HI> She may be
<PB N="204" REF="212"/>necessary to <HI>political government,</HI> and may serve the same purpose to the <HI>state</HI> that any <HI>political church</HI> ever did:—and I make no doubt but <HI>archbishops</HI> and <HI>bishops,</HI> and <HI>their clergy,</HI> are as useful to the <HI>English government,</HI> as the Roman <HI>pontifex, Maximus,</HI> with all the tribe of <HI>his clergy,</HI> were to the <HI>Roman.</HI> The christian religion is as much concerned with the <HI>one</HI> as the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>As the <HI>Apostles</HI> of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> never <HI>found</HI> any <HI>fault</HI> with the civil govern∣ment of <HI>Rome,</HI> nor <HI>interfered</HI> with the state religion, farther than by telling them that <HI>pleased to hear them</HI> that it was <HI>idolatry,</HI> nor gave themselves any trouble concerning it, except when the <HI>civil power</HI> wanted them to <HI>comply</HI> with <HI>their worship,</HI> which they <HI>never</HI> would do,—so the followers of the <HI>Apostles</HI> ought to imitate them, and suffer the
<PB N="205" REF="213"/><HI>state</HI> to have what religion <HI>it pleaseth,</HI> providing it does not impose <HI>it</HI> upon <HI>them.</HI> If indeed that part of the civil constitution called <HI>the church,</HI> seek to impose its <HI>worship</HI> and <HI>rituals,</HI> by <HI>au∣thority,</HI> upon <HI>those</HI> who cannot <HI>in con∣science</HI> observe <HI>them,</HI> they have an un∣doubted right to give their <HI>reasons</HI> why they cannot, and may safely affirm their reasons <HI>are such,</HI> whatever they are. There is <HI>no</HI> warrant in the <HI>New Tes∣tament</HI> for <HI>any party</HI> to impose their religion upon <HI>another;</HI>—nor have chris∣tians any right to say that a <HI>state</HI> should <HI>conform</HI> to <HI>them.</HI>—But when they are called to give the reasons of their non∣conformity, they have no cause to be ashamed or afraid to do <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>any establishment</HI> makes laws to compel non-conformists to comply with the <HI>political religion,</HI> upon the pain of <HI>loss</HI> or <HI>suffering,</HI> it is a plain
<PB N="206" REF="214"/>evidence it is not a <HI>New Testament church;</HI> for in the christian religion there is <HI>no compulsion.</HI> If the present national religion be <HI>essential</HI> to civil go∣vernment in <HI>England,</HI> it seems abun∣dantly evident that <HI>none</HI> should be ad∣mitted to <HI>any share</HI> in <HI>the government,</HI> but <HI>such</HI> as are of <HI>that communion.</HI>—But then they ought not to <HI>be called by authority</HI> to <HI>exercise any offices</HI> under <HI>it,</HI> when their consciences will not al∣low them to observe <HI>the requisites</HI> that are needful to qualify <HI>them.</HI> Churches established by law are not even satis∣fied with enjoying <HI>all the profits</HI> of their settlement, unless they can bring other people <HI>to defile their consciences,</HI> by endeavouring <HI>to compel them</HI> to do what they believe to be <HI>sinful.</HI></P>
<P>It is supposing <HI>non-conformists</HI> to be <HI>worse</HI> than <HI>asses,</HI> to endeavour to <HI>compel them</HI> to serve in offices both <HI>civil</HI> and
<PB N="207" REF="215"/><HI>religious,</HI> where they must at first in∣stance join in worshipping God in a way their <HI>consciences remonstrate against.</HI> When men are allowed to <HI>have their own method</HI> of <HI>religion,</HI> and are not <HI>com∣pelled</HI> to any thing against their <HI>con∣sciences,</HI> they have <HI>no reason</HI> to find fault with the <HI>established religion.</HI>—But when <HI>they</HI> are <HI>compelled</HI> to support <HI>it</HI> by <HI>their means,</HI> and forced to comply with <HI>its rituals,</HI> or suffer <HI>loss,</HI> they have cer∣tainly reason <HI>to complain</HI> of <HI>want</HI> of <HI>christian liberty.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>leaders</HI> of <HI>religion</HI> do certainly account <HI>dissenters infidels,</HI> or intend to make them so,—when they endeavour to make them conform to <HI>modes</HI> of <HI>worship</HI> they can see no <HI>authority</HI> for in the <HI>word</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> This shews something <HI>like a stated purpose</HI> to <HI>ruin</HI> both <HI>their souls</HI> and <HI>bodies.</HI> The <HI>Apostle</HI> tells us, <HI>that he that doubteth is damned if he eat,</HI>

They have still a <HI>strong inclination</HI> to go to heaven within the <HI>trammels</HI> of a <HI>liturgy,</HI>—and <HI>some</HI> of <HI>them</HI> have of late been making <HI>zealous attempts</HI> to bring in <HI>organs</HI> into their <HI>meetings,</HI> that they may have as <HI>wan∣ton</HI> a way of worshipping <HI>their maker,</HI> as <HI>their neighbours</HI> of <HI>the establishment.</HI> These well refined <HI>dissenters</HI> seem to
<PB N="210" REF="218"/>agree with the <HI>establishment,</HI> in think∣ing that <HI>the Almighty</HI> should be wor∣shipped after the <HI>jewish manner,</HI>—and seem <HI>disposed</HI> to make the <HI>New Testa∣ment conform</HI> to the <HI>Old,</HI> as <HI>decently</HI> as they can.

<P>I shall conclude with observing, that there is scarce a man that assumes the character of a <HI>prophet,</HI> but will find plenty of <HI>asses</HI> among the people to an∣swer <HI>his purpose.</HI> Tho' <HI>Balaam</HI> and his <HI>ass</HI> are dead many ages ago,—yet <HI>their offspring</HI> are very numerous.
