<HEAD>A
DEFENCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE fair way of conducting a
dispute, is to exhibit one by one
the arguments of your opponent, and
with each argument the precise and spe∣cific
answer you are able to give it. If
this method be not so common, nor
found so convenient as might be expect∣ed,
the reason is, because it suits not
always with the designs of a writer,
which are no more perhaps than to make
a <HI>Book;</HI> to confound some arguments,
and keep others out of sight; to leave
what is called an <HI>Impression</HI> upon the
reader, without any care to inform him
of the proofs or principles by which
his opinion should be governed. With
such views, it may be consistent to dis∣patch
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
objections, by observing of some
<HI>that they are old,</HI> and therefore like cer∣tain
drugs have lost, we may suppose,
their strength; of others, that <HI>they have
long since received an answer;</HI> which im∣plies,
to be sure, a confutation: To
attack straggling remarks, and decline
the main reasoning, as <HI>mere declamation;</HI>
to pass by one passage because it is <HI>long-winded,</HI>
another because the Answerer
<HI>has neither leisure nor inclination to enter
into the discussion of it;</HI> to produce ex∣tracts
and quotations, which taken alone,
imperfectly if at all express their author's
meaning; to dismiss a stubborn difficulty
with a <HI>reference,</HI> which ten to one the
reader never looks at: and lastly, in order
to give the whole a certain fashionable air
of candour and moderation, to make a
concession<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such as, <HI>that if people keep their opinions to themselves, no man will hurt them,</HI> and the like. Answer, p. 45.</NOTE> or two which nobody thanks
him for, or yield up a few points which
it is no longer any credit to maintain.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
How far the writer with whom we
have to do is concerned in this description,
his readers will judge; he shall receive,
however, from us that justice which he
has not shewn the author of the <HI>Considerations,</HI>
to have his arguments fully and
distinctly stated and examined.</P>
<P>After complaining, as is usual on these
occasions, of <HI>disappointment</HI> and dissatis∣faction;
the Answerer sets out with an
argument which comprises, we are told,
in a <HI>narrow compass,</HI> the whole merits of
the question betwixt us; and which is
neither more nor less than this, that <HI>it is
necessary that those who are to be ordained
teachers in the Church should be sound in
the faith, and consequently that they should
give to those who ordain them some proof
and assurance that they are so, and that the
method of this proof should be settled by
public Authority.</HI>—Now the perfection
of this sort of reasoning is, that it comes
as well from the mouth of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s
Professor of Divinity in the University of
<HI>Bologna,</HI> as from the <HI>Clarendon</HI> press.
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
A Church has only with our Author to
call her Creed <HI>the faithful word,</HI> and it
follows from Scripture that <HI>we must hold
it fast.</HI> Her dissatisfied sons, let her
only denominate, as he does<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 18.</NOTE>, <HI>vain
talkers and deceivers,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> himself
commands us to <HI>stop their mouths.</HI> Every
one that questions or opposes her de∣cisions
she pronounces, with him, a
heretic, and <HI>a man that is an heretic after
the first and second admonition reject.</HI> In
like manner, calling her tenets <HI>sound
doctrine,</HI> or taking it for granted that
they are so (which the Conclave at <HI>Rome</HI>
can do as well as the Convocation at
<HI>London</HI>) and <HI>soundness in the faith being
a necessary qualification in a Christian
Teacher,</HI> there is no avoiding the con∣clusion,
that every <HI>Christian Teacher</HI> (in,
and out of the Church too, if you can
catch him, <HI>soundness in the faith</HI> being
alike <HI>necessary</HI> in all) must have these tenets
strapped about his neck by Oaths and
Subscriptions. An argument which thus
fights in any cause, or on either side,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
deserves no quarter.—I have said that
this reasoning, and these applications of
Scripture are equally competent to the
defenders of <HI>Popery</HI>—they are more so.
The Popes, when they assumed the power
of the Apostles, laid claim also to their
infallibility; and in this they were con∣sistent.
Protestant Churches renounce
with all their might this infallibility,
whilst they apply to themselves every
expression that describes it, and will not
part with a jot of the Authority which is
built upon it.—But to return
to the terms of the argument. <HI>Is it necessary that a
Christian Teacher should be sound in the
faith?</HI></P>
<Q><P>1. Not in nine instances out of ten
to which the Test is now extended.
Nor</P>
<P>2. If it were, is this the way to make
him so; there being as little proba∣bility
that the determinations of a set
of men whose good fortune had ad∣vanced
them to high stations in the
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Church should be right, as the con∣clusions
of private enquirers. Nor</P>
<P>3. Were they actually right, is it possible
to conceive how they can, upon this
author's principles, produce the effect
contended for. Since <HI>we set them
not up</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 10, 11, 13, 29.</NOTE> <HI>as a rule of faith;</HI> since <HI>they
do not decide matters for us, nor bind
them upon us;</HI> since <HI>they tie no man
up from altering his opinion,</HI> are <HI>no
ways inconsistent with the right of pri∣vate
judgment,</HI> are in a word, of no
more authority than an old Sermon;
nor consequently much more effectual,
either for the producing or securing
of <HI>soundness in the faith.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Answerer not trusting altogether
to the strength of his <HI>argument,</HI> endea∣vours
next to avail himself of a <HI>concession</HI>
which he has gained, he imagines, from
his adversary, and which he is pleased
to look upon <HI>as in a manner giving up
the main point.</HI> Our business, therefore,
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
will be to shew what this concession, as
he calls it, amounts to, and wherein it
differs from the <HI>main point,</HI> the requi∣sition
of Subscription to established for∣mularies.
It is objected to the Articles
of the Church of England, that they are
at variance with the actual opinions both
of the Governors and Members of that
Church; so much so, that the men who
most faithfully and explicitly maintain
these Articles, get persecuted for their
singularity, excluded from Orders, driven
from Universities, and are compelled to
preach the established religion, in fields
and conventicles.—Now this objection,
which must cleave to every <HI>fixed</HI> formu∣lary,
might, we conceive, be removed if
a Test was substituted, supposing any Test
to be insisted upon, which could adapt
itself to the opinions, and keep pace with
the improvements, of each succeeding
age. This, in some measure, would be
the case if the Governors of the Church
for the time being, were authorised to
receive from Candidates for orders del∣clarations
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
of their religious principles in
their own words, and allowed, at their
discretion, to admit them into the Mini∣stry.
Bishops being taken out of the
lump of the community will generally
be of the same leaven, and partake, both
of the opinions and moderation of the
times they live in.—This is the most
that can be made of the concession, and
how this gives up the <HI>main point,</HI> or
indeed any thing, it is not easy to dis∣cover.</P>
<P>The next paragraph of the Answer
attacks the account which the <HI>Considera∣tions</HI>
have given of the <HI>rise</HI> and <HI>progress</HI>
of the custom in question, <HI>the reverse of
which</HI> the Answerer tell us <HI>is the truth,</HI>
and by way of proof gives his own
account of the matter, which, so far
from being the <HI>reverse,</HI> is in effect, or
very nearly, the same.</P>
<P>The reader shall see the two accounts
side by side, and is desired to judge
whether the Author of the Considera∣tions,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
so far from being confuted in this
point, is even contradicted.</P>
<P>“The protestants,
aware how greatly they
were misrepresented and
abused, began to think
it necessary to repell the
various calumnies that
had been cast upon them,
by setting forth some
public Constitutions or
Confessions, as a declara∣tion
of their faith and
worship. And to make
such declaration still more
authentic, they likewise
engaged themselves in a
mutual bond of confor∣mity
to all these Con∣stitutions.”
Considera∣tions,
page 6.</P>
<P>“As some who set up
for reformers, had broach∣ed
many erroneous and
pestilent doctrines; the
<HI>Lutherans</HI> first, and, after
their example, other pro∣testant
Churches, thought
fit to draw up Confess∣ions
of Faith. And this
they did, partly to acquit
themselves of the scandal
of abetting wild and se∣ditious
enthusiasts, and
declaring what were their
real doctrines: partly
(observe how tenderly
this is introduced) to pre∣vent
such enthusiasts on
the one hand, and popish
emissaries on the other,
from intruding them∣selves
into the ministry.”
Answer, page 6, 7.</P>
<P>Now were the <HI>origin</HI> of a custom of
more consequence than it is to a question
concerning the <HI>propriety</HI> of it, can any
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
one doubt who credits even the An∣swerer's
own account, but that the motive
assigned in the Considerations both did
exist, and was the principal motive.
There is one account, indeed, of the
<HI>origin</HI> of this custom which, were it true,
would directly concern the question.
<HI>This practice,</HI> our Author tells us in
another part of his Answer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 19.</NOTE>, <HI>is said to
be derived from the Apostles themselves.</HI>
I care not what <HI>is said.</HI>—It is impossible
that the practice complained of, the
imposition of articles of faith by <HI>fallible</HI>
men, could originate from the <HI>Apostels,</HI>
who, under the direction by which they
acted, were <HI>infallible</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>How a Creed is to be made, as the Conside∣rations recommend, in which all parties shall agree, our Author cannot understand. I will tell him how; by adhering to scripture terms: and this will suit the best idea of a Creed (a summary or compendium of a larger volume) and the only fair purpose of one, <HI>instruction.</HI></P>
<P>It is observed in the Considerations, that the multiplicity of the propositions contained in the 39 Articles is alone sufficient to shew the impossi∣bility of that consent which the Church supposes and requires.—Now, what would any man guess is the answer to this? Why, <HI>that there are no less than three propositio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the very first verse of St. John's Gospel.</HI> Had there been <HI>three thousand</HI> it would have been nothing to the purpose: Where propositions are received upon the Authority of the proposer, it matters not how many of them there are; the doubt is not increased with the number; the same reason which establishes one establishes all. But is this the case with a system of propositions which derives no evidence from the proposer? which must each stand upon its own separate and intrinsic proof?—We thought it necessary to oppose note to note in the place in which we found it, though neither here nor in the Answer is it much connected with the Text.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
But this practice, from whatever <HI>root
of bitterness</HI> it sprung, has been one of
the chief causes, we assert, of the divi∣sions
and distresses which we read of in
ecclesiastical history. The matter of fact
our Author does not, because he cannot,
deny. He rather chuses to infinaate
that <HI>such divisions and disturbances were
not owing to the governors of the Church,
but to the perverse disputings of Heretics
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
and Schismatics.</HI>—He <HI>must</HI> know, that
there is oppression as well as resistance,
provocation as well as resentment, abuse
of power as well as opposition to it;
and it is too much to take for granted,
without one syllable of proof, that those
in possession of power have been always
in the right, and those who withstood
them in the wrong. <HI>Divisions</HI> and <HI>dis∣turbances</HI>
have in fact, and in all ages,
arisen on this account, and it is a poor shift
to say, because it may always be said,
that such only are chargeable with these
mischiefs as refused to submit to what∣ever
their superiors thought proper to
impose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following sentiment of our Author's is too curious to be omitted; “<HI>Possibly too he</HI> (the Author of the Considerations) <HI>may think that insurrections and rebellions in the state are not owing to the unruliness of factious subjects, but to Kings and Rulers; but most reasonable men, I believe, will think otherwise.</HI>”—A common reader may think this observation of the Answerer a little beside the ques∣tion. But the Answerer may say, with <HI>Cicero</HI> and Dr. <HI>King,</HI> “Suscepto negotio, majus mihi quiddam proposui, in quo meam in Rempublicam volunta∣tem populus perspicere posset,”—Motto to Dr. K.'s Oration in 1749.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Nor is it much better what he tells
us, <HI>that these subtilties of metaphysical
debate, which we complain of in our Arti∣cles,
were introduced by the several here∣tics
of those times;</HI> especially as it is evi∣dent
that whoever first introduced, it is
the <HI>Governors of the Church</HI> who still
continue them.</P>
<P>But our Author cannot conceive what
all this, as relating to <HI>Creeds</HI> only and
<HI>Confessions;</HI> to the <HI>terms of communion,</HI>
rather than of admission into the Mini∣stry,
is to the purpose. Will he then
give up <HI>Creeds</HI> and <HI>Confessions?</HI> or will
his Church thank him for it if he does?
—a Church which, by transfusing the
substance of her Articles into the form
of her public worship, has in effect
made the <HI>terms of communion</HI> and of ad∣mission
into the Ministry the same.
—This question, like every other, however
naked you may strip it by abstraction,
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
must always be considered with a refe∣rence
to the practice you wish to reform.</P>
<P>The Author of the Considerations
contends very properly that it is one of
the first duties a Christian owes to his
Master <HI>to keep his mind open and unbiassed</HI>
in religious enquiries. Can a man be
said to do this, who must bring himself
to assent to opinions proposed by an∣other?
Who enters into a profession
where both his subsistence and success
depend upon his continuance in a par∣ticular
persuasion? In answer to this we
are informed, that these Articles are no
<HI>Rule of Faith</HI> (what not to those who
subscribe them?) that <HI>the Church deprives
no man of his right of private judgement</HI>
(she cannot—she hangs however a dead
weight upon it); that it is a <HI>very unfair
state of the case to call Subscription a decal∣ration
of our full and final persuasion in
matters of faith;</HI> though if it be not a
<HI>full</HI> persuasion, what is it? and ten to
one it will be <HI>final,</HI> when such conse∣quences
attend a change.—That, <HI>no man
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
is hereby tied up from impartially examin∣ing
the word of God,</HI> i. e. with the <HI>im∣partiality</HI>
of a Man who must <HI>eat</HI> or
<HI>starve,</HI> according as the examination
turns out; an <HI>impartiality</HI> so suspected,
that a Court of Justice would not receive
his evidence under half of the same
influence;—<HI>nor from altering his opinion
if he finds reason so to do;</HI> which few, I
conceive, will <HI>find,</HI> when the alteration
must cost them so dear. If one could
give credit to our Author in what he says
here, and in some other passages of his
Answer, one would suppose that, in his
judgement at least, Subscription restrained
no man from adopting what opinion he
pleased, provided <HI>he does not think himself
bound openly to maintain it;</HI> that <HI>men may
retain their preferments, if they will but
keep their opinions to themselves.</HI>—If this
be what the Church of England means,
let her say so.—This is indeed what our
Author admits here, and yet from the
outery he has afterwards raised against
all who continue in the Church whilst
they dissent from her Articles, one would
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
not suppose there was a pardon left for
those, who <HI>keep even to themselves an
opinion</HI> inconsistent with any one propo∣sition
they have subscribed. The fact is,
the Gentleman has either shifted his
opinion in the course of writing the
Answer, or had put down these asser∣tions,
not expecting that he should have
occasion afterwards to contradict them.</P>
<P>It seemed to add strength to this ob∣jection
that the judgement of most think∣ing
men being in a progressive state,
their opinions of course must many of
them change; the evil and iniquity of
which the Answerer sets forth with great
pleasantry, but has forgot at the same
time to give us any remedy for the mis∣fortune;
except the Old woman's receipt
to leave off thinking, for fear of think∣ing
wrong.</P>
<P>But our Church <HI>preaches,</HI> it seems, <HI>no
other Gospel than that which she received,</HI>
nor <HI>propounds any other articles for Gospel,</HI>
nor <HI>fixes any standards or criterions of
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
faith, separate from this Gospel; and so she
herself fully declares;</HI> and we are to take
her <HI>word</HI> for it, when the very complaint
is, that she has never <HI>acted</HI> up to this
declaration, but in direct contradiction to
it.—When she puts forth a system of
propostions conceived in a new dialect,
and in unscriptural terms; when she
ascribes to these the same evidence and
certainty as to Scripture itself, or decrees
and acts as if they were equally evident
and certain, she incurs, we apprehend,
the charge which these expressions imply.
—She claims indeed <HI>Authority in contro∣versies
of faith,</HI> but <HI>only so far,</HI> says her
Apologist, as <HI>to judge for herself what
shall be her own terms of communion, and
what qualifications she shall require in her
own ministers.</HI> All which, in plainer
English, comes to this; that two or three
men betwixt two and three centuries ago,
fixed a multitude of obscure and dubious
propositions, which many millions after
must bring themselves to believe, before
they be permitted to share in the pro∣vision
which the State has made (and to
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
which all of every sect contribute) for
regular opportunities of public worship,
and the giving and receiving of public
instruction. And this our Author calls
the Magistrate's <HI>judging for himself</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 26.</NOTE>, and
exercising the <HI>same right as all other
persons have to judge for themselves.</HI> For
the reasonableness of it however he has
nothing to offer, but that it <HI>is no more
than what other Churches, Popish too,</HI> to
strengthen the argument, <HI>as well as Pro∣testant,</HI>
have done before. He might
have added, seeing <HI>custom</HI> is to determine
the matter, that it has been <HI>customary</HI> too
from early ages for Christians to anathe∣matise
and burn each other for difference
of opinion in some points of faith, and
for difference of practice in some points
of ceremony.</P>
<P>We now accompany the learned An∣swerer
to what he is pleased to call the
<HI>main question,</HI> and which he is so much
<HI>puzzled to keep in sight.</HI> The argu∣ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What would any man in his wits think of this argument, if upon the strength of it they were to make a law, that none but red haired people should be admitted into orders, or even into churches?</NOTE>
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
in favour of Subscription, and
the arbitrary exclusion of men from the
Church or Ministry, drawn from the
nature of a society and the rights inci∣dental
to society, our Author resigns to
its fate, and to the answer which has
been given it in the Considerations.
He contends only, that the conduct of
the Apostles in admitting the <HI>Eunuch</HI>
and the <HI>Centurion</HI> upon a general pro∣fession
of their faith in Christ, <HI>has nothing
to do with the case of Subscription,</HI> as they
were admitted, not into the Ministry,
but only the communion of the Church.
Now, in the first place, suppose the
<HI>Eunuch</HI> or <HI>Centurion</HI> had taken upon
them, as probably they did, to teach
Christianity, would they have been in∣hibited
by the Apostles as not having
given sufficient <HI>proof or assurance of their
soundness in the faith?</HI> And if not, what
becomes of the necessity of such <HI>assu∣rances
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
from a Christian teacher?</HI> In the
second place, suppose you consider the
Church as one society, and its teachers
as another, is it probable that these who
were so tender in keeping any one out of
the first, would have thought the argument
we were encountering, or any thing else,
a pretence for a right of arbitrary ex∣clusion
from the latter? The case of
<HI>Cornelius,</HI> says our Author, is <HI>extraordi∣nary;
while St. Peter was preaching to
him, the Holy Ghost fell upon all them
which heard the word.</HI> And is not this
Author ashamed to own, that any are
excluded from the communion, or even
ministry, of the Church, who would have
been entitled by their faith <HI>to the Gifts
of the Holy Ghost?</HI></P>
<P>The Answerer in the next paragraph
acknowledges, that to admit converts into
the Church upon this one Article of
faith, that <HI>Jesus</HI> is <HI>the Messiah,</HI> was
indeed the practice of the Apostles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Although the question, whether to believe that <HI>Jesus</HI> is the Messiah, be not the only necessary article of faith, is a question in which we have no concern; our Author, with the best inclination in the world, not being able to fix such an opinion upon us. Yet I cannot help observing, that he has put two of the oddest constructions upon the terms of the proposition that ever entered into the fancy of man to conceive. One is, which you may be sure he intends for his adversaries<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 16.</NOTE>, <HI>that it is neccessary to believe Jesus to be a true prophet, yet not necessary to believe one doctrine that he has taught.</HI> The other, which he means for himself, is that <HI>by the Messiah we are to understand the only begotten Son of God anointed and sent by the Father to make pro∣pitiation for the sins of the whole world.</HI></NOTE>;
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
but then he tells us, what must sound a
little odd to a Christian ear, and comes
the more aukwardly from this Author,
whom if you turn over a page, you will
find quoting the <HI>practice of the Apostles</HI>
with a vengeance: he tells us, I say, <HI>that
no argument can be drawn from the prac∣tice
of the Apostles</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 16.</NOTE>. Now with regard
to the <HI>practice of the Apostles,</HI> and the
application of it to ourselves, the case
seems to be this (the very reverse, ob∣serve,
of our Author's rule) that we are
always bound not <HI>to go beyond</HI> the pre∣cedent,
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
though for want of the same
authority, we may not always <HI>advance up
to it.</HI>—It surely at least becomes us to be
cautious of <HI>proceeding,</HI> where they in the
plenitude of their commission thought
proper to <HI>stop.</HI></P>
<P>It is alledged in the Considerations,
that annexing emoluments to the pro∣fession
of particular opinions is a strong
and dangerous inducement to prevarica∣tion;
and the danger is the greater, as
prevarication in one instance has a ten∣dency
to relax the most sacred oblige∣tions,
and make way for perfidy in
every other. But <HI>this,</HI> it seems, <HI>has
nothing to do with the question</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 19, 20.</NOTE>. Why,
it is the <HI>very</HI> question, Whether the ma∣gistrate
ought to confine the provision he
makes for religion to those who assent,
or declare their assent, to a particular
system of controverted divinity; and
this is one direct objection against it.
But <HI>must the magistrate then,</HI> exclaims
our alarmed adversary, <HI>establish no tythes,
no rich benefices, no dignities, or Bishop∣ricks?</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
As many as he pleases, only let
him not convert them into snares and
traps by idle and unnecessary conditions.
<HI>But must he admit all persons indiscrimi∣nately
to these advantages?</HI> The Author
of the Considerations has told him, that
he may require conformity to the Li∣turgy,
Rites and Offices he shall pre∣scribe:
he may trust his officers with a
discretion as to the religious principles of
candidates for orders, similar to what
they now exercise with regard to their
qualifications; he may censure extra∣vagant
preaching when it <HI>appears;</HI> pre∣cautions
surely sufficient either to keep
the <HI>wildest sectaries</HI> out of the Church,
or prevent their doing any mischief if
they get in. The exclusion of Papists
is a separate consideration. The Laws
against Popery, as far as they are jus∣tifiable,
proceed upon principles with
which the Author of the Considerations
has nothing to do. Where, from the
particular circumstances of a country,
attachments and dispositions hostile and
dangerous to the state, are accidentally
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
or otherwise connected with certain opi∣nions
in religion, it may be neccessary
to lay incumbrances and restraints upon
the profession, or propagation of such
opinions. Where <HI>a great part</HI> of any
sect or religious order of men are ene∣mies
to the constitution, and you have
no way of distinguishing those who are
not so, it is right, perhaps, to fence the
<HI>whole</HI> order out of your civil and reli∣gious
establishment: it is the right at
least of self-defence, and of extreme ne∣cessity.
But even this is not on account of
the religious opinions themselves, but
as they are probable marks, and the only
marks you have, of designs and prin∣ciples
which it is neccessary to disarm. I
would observe, however, that in propor∣tion
as this connection between the civil
and religious principles of the Papists
is dissolved, in the same proportion
ought the state to mitigate the hard∣ships
and relax the restraints to which
they are made subject.</P>

If we complain of <HI>severities,</HI> of <HI>pains</HI>
and <HI>penalties,</HI> the Answerer cannot dis∣cover
<HI>whom or what we mean:</HI> and left
his Reader should, by a figure extremely
well known in the craft of controversy▪
he proposes a string of questions in the
person of his adversary, to which he
gives his own peremptory and definitive
NO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. We will take a method, not
altogether so compendious, but, we trust,
somewhat more satisfactory. We will
repeat the same questions, and let the
Church and State answer for themselves.
First then,</P>
<P><HI>Does our Church or our Government
inflict any corporal punishment, or levy
any fines or penalties on those who will not
comply with the Terms of her Communion?</HI>
—“BE IT ENACTED, that all and
every person or persons that shall ne∣glect
or refuse—to receive the Sacra∣ment
of the Lord's Supper according
to the usage of the Church of England,
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
and yet, after such neglect or refusal,
shall execute any office or offices, civil
or military, after the times be expired
wherein he or they ought to have taken
the same, shall, upon conviction thereof,
besides the loss of the office, forfeit the
sum of five hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This and the Corporation Act an otherwise excellent person calls the Laws which secure both our civil and religious <HI>Liberties.</HI> Blackstone's Comm. Vol. iv. p. 432.</NOTE>.” Stat.
25 Car. II. c. 2. Now, although starv∣ing
be no <HI>corporal Punishment,</HI> nor the
loss of all a man has a <HI>Fine,</HI> or <HI>Penalty,</HI>
yet depriving men of the common bene∣fits
of society, and rights even of lay
subjects, because <HI>they will not comply with
the terms of Church Communion,</HI> is a
<HI>severity</HI> that might have deserved from
our Author some other Apology besides
the mere suppression of the fact.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Doth it deny them the right or pri∣vilege
of worshipping God in their own
way?</HI>—“WHOEVER shall take upon
him to preach or teach in any meeting,
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
assembly or conventicle, and shall thereof
be convicted, shall forfeit for the first
offence twenty pounds, and for every
other offence forty pounds.” Stat. 22
Car. II. cap. 1.—“No person shall presume
to consecrate or administer the Sacrament
of the Lord's Supper before he be or∣dained
Priest, after the manner of the
Church of England, on pain of forfeit∣ing
one hundred pounds for every such
offence.” Stat. 13 &amp; 14 Car. II. c. 4.
—These laws are in full force against all
who do not subscribe the 39 Articles of the
Church of England, except the 34th, 35th,
and 36th, and part of the 20th Article.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Are men denied the liberty of free
debate?</HI>—“IF ANY PERSON having
been educated in, or at any time having
made profession of the Christian faith
within the realm, shall by writing,
printing, teaching, or advised speaking,
deny any one of the persons of the holy
Trinity to be God—he shall for the first
offence be disabled to hold any office or
employment, or any profit appertaining
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
thereto; for the second offence shall be
disabled to prosecute any action or in∣formation
in any court of law or equity,
or to be guardian of any child, or exe∣cutor
or administrator of any person, or
capable of any legacy, or deed of gift,
or to bear any office for ever within this
realm, and shall also suffer imprison∣ment
for the space of three years from
the time of such conviction.” Stat. 9
&amp; 10 Will. III. c. 32.</P>
<P>It has been thought to detract conside∣rably
from the pretended use of these
Subscriptions, that they excluded none
but the conscientious; a species of men
more wanted, we conceive, than for∣midable
to any religious establishment.
This objection applies equally, says our
Answerer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 22.</NOTE>, to the <HI>Oaths of Allegiance
and Supremacy;</HI> and so far as it does
apply, it ought to be attended to; and
the truth is, these <HI>Oaths</HI> might in many
instances be spared without either danger
or detriment to the community. There
is, however, an essential difference be∣tween
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
the two cases; a scruple concern∣ing
the <HI>Oath of Allegiance</HI> implies prin∣ciples
which may excite to acts of hosti∣lity
against the State, a scruple about the
truth of the <HI>Articles</HI> implies no such
thing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Answerer might have found a parallel below in some other Oaths, which he does not care to speak of, viz. the Case of College Statutes, page 34 of the Considerations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Our Author, good man, <HI>is well per∣suaded,
that the generality of the Clergy,
when they offer themselves for ordination,
consider seriously what office they take
upon them, and firmly believe what they
subscribe to.</HI> I am <HI>persuaded</HI> much other∣wise.
But as this is a <HI>Fact,</HI> the Reader,
if he be wise, will neither take the An∣swerer's
word for it nor mine: but form
his own judgment from his own obser∣vation.
Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> complained above
60 years ago, that <HI>the greater part,</HI> even
then, <HI>subscribed the Articles without ever
examining them</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burnet</HI>'s Hist. of his Own Times. Conclusion.</NOTE>, <HI>and others did it
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
because they must do it.</HI> Is it probable,
that in point either of seriousness or or∣thodoxy
the Clergy are much mended
since?</P>
<P>The Pleas offered in support of this
practice of Subscription come next to be
considered. “One of these is drawn
from the sacred writings being capable
of such a variety of senses, that men of
widely different persuasions shelter them∣selves
under the same forms of expres∣sion.”
Our Author, after quarrelling
with this representation of the plea, gives
his readers in its stead a long quotation
from <HI>the Archdeacon of Oxford's Charge</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this whole Charge answered <HI>In the London Chronicle by Priscilla.</HI>—The Lord hath sold <HI>Sisera</HI> into the hand of a <HI>Woman!</HI></NOTE>.
—What he is to gain by the change, or
the quotation, I cannot perceive, as the
same Ist Query still recurs, “Is it true
that the Scriptures are in reality so differ∣rently
interpreted in points of real consequence?”
In answer to which, the
<HI>Archdeacon of Oxford,</HI> we are told, <HI>has
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
shewn that points of real consequence are
differently interpreted,</HI> and <HI>the plainest
texts explained away,</HI> and has <HI>instanced
—in the first chapter of St. John's Gospel.</HI>
—The plea we conceive is not much
indebted to the <HI>Archdeacon of Oxford.</HI>—But
be these Scriptures interpreted as they
will, each man has still a right to inter∣pret
them for himself. The Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> who always pushed her conclusions
with a courage and consistency unknown
to the timid patrons of Protestant Impo∣sition,
saw immediately that as the Laity
had no right to interpret the Scriptures,
they could have no occasion to read them,
and therefore very properly locked them
up from the intrusion of popular curi∣osity.
Our Author cites the abovemen∣tioned
Query from the Considerations as
the <HI>first</HI> Query which would lead his
Reader to expect a <HI>second.</HI> The Reader,
however, may seek that <HI>second</HI> for him∣self,
the Answerer is not obliged to pro∣duce
it—It stands thus. Suppose the
Scriptures thus variously interpreted, does
Subscription mend the matter?—The
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
Reader too is left to find an answer for
himself.</P>
<P>The next, the strongest, the only tole∣rable
plea for Subscription is, <HI>that all
sorts of pestilent heresies might be taught
from the pulpit, if no such restraint as
this was laid upon the Preacher</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 26.</NOTE>. How
far it is probable that this would be the
consequence of removing Subscription,
and by what other means it might be
guarded against, has been hinted already,
and will again be considered in another
place. We will here only take notice of
one particular expedient suggested in the
Considerations, and which has often in∣deed
elsewhere been proposed, namely,
“that the Church, instead of requiring
Subscription before-hand to the present,
or to any other Articles of faith, might
censure her Clergy afterwards, if they
opposed or vilified them in their preach∣ing.”
—The advantage of which scheme
above the present is manifest, if it was
only for this reason, that you distress
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
and corrupt thousands now, for one that
you would ever have occasion to punish.
Our Author nevertheless <HI>is humbly of
opinion that it is much better to take proper
precautions beforehand:</HI> he must, with all
his <HI>humility,</HI> know that when it has been
proposed to take proper precautions of
the <HI>Press,</HI> by subjecting authors to an
<HI>imprimatur before</HI> publication, instead of
punishment <HI>after</HI> it; the proposal has
been resented as an open attack upon the
rights and interests of mankind. The
common sense and spirit of the nation
could, see and feel this distinction, and
the importance of it, in the case of pub∣lishers;
and why preachers should be
left in a worse situation it is not very
easy to say?</P>
<P>The example of the <HI>Arminian</HI> con∣fession
is, upon this occasion, recom∣mended
by the Author of the Considera∣tions;
a confession which was compiled
for the edification and instruction of the
members of that church, without pe∣remptorily
insisting upon any one's <HI>assent</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
to it. But it is the misfortune of the
<HI>Arminian</HI> to be no national church—the
misfortune, alas! of Christianity her∣self
in her purest period; when she was
under the government of the Apostles;
without <HI>alliance</HI> with the states of this
world; when she composed nevertheless
a church as real, we conceive, and as
respectable, as any <HI>national</HI> church that
has existed since.</P>
<P>Our Author, who can much sooner
make a distinction than see one, does
not comprehend, it seems, any diffe∣rence
between Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essions of faith and
<HI>preaching,</HI> as to the use of unscriptural
terms. Did a Preacher, when he had
finished his sermon, call upon his con∣gregation
to subscribe their names and
assent to it, or never to come more with∣in
the doors of his church; there would
indeed be some fort of resemblance
betwixt the two cases; but as the hearers
are at liberty to believe their preacher or
no, as they see, or he produces reasons,
for what he says; there can be no harm,
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
and there is a manifest utility, in trust∣ing
him with the liberty of explaining
his own meaning in his own terms.</P>
<P>We now come, and with the tenderest
regret, to the case of those who conti∣nue
in the Church without being able to
reconcile to their belief every proposition
imposed upon them by Subscription;
over whole distress our Author is pleased
to indulge a wanton and ungenerous
triumph. They had presumed, it seems,
that it was some apology for their con∣duct,
that they sincerely laboured to
render to religion their best services, and
thought their present stations the fairest
opportunities of performing it.—This
may not, perhaps, amount to a com∣plete
vindication; it certainly does not
fully satisfy even their own scruples; else
where would be the cause of complaint?
What need of relief, or what reason for
their petitions? It might have been
enough, however, to have exempted them
from being absurdly and indecently com∣pared
with faithless <HI>hypocrites,</HI> with <HI>Pa∣pists,</HI>
and <HI>Jesuits,</HI> who, for other pur∣poses,
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
and with even opoosite designs,
are supposed to creep into the Church
through the same door. For the fullest
and fairest representation of their case,
I refer our Author to the excellent
<HI>Hoadly;</HI> or as <HI>Hoadly</HI> possibly may be
no book in our Author's library, will
it provoke his <HI>raillery</HI> to ask, what he
thinks might be the consequence, if all
were at once to withdraw themselves
from the Church who are dissatisfied
with her doctrines? Might not the
Church lose, what she can ill spare, the
service of many able and industrious
ministers? Would those, she retained,
be such as acquiesced in her decisions
from enquiry and conviction? Would
not many or most of them, be those,
who keep out of the way of religious
scruples by lives of <HI>Secularity</HI> and Volup∣tuousness?
by mixing with the crowd, in
the most eager of their pursuits after plea∣sure
or advantage?—One word with the
Answerer before we part upon this head.
—Whence all this great inquisitiveness,
this solicitude to be acquainted with the
person, the opinions, and associates of
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
his adversary? Whence that impertinent
wish, that he had been <HI>more explicit in
particular with regard to the doctrine of
the Trinity?</HI> Is it out of a pious desire
to fasten some heresy, or the imputation
of it, upon him? Is he <HI>called out of the
Clouds</HI> to be committed to the Flames<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We were unwilling to decline the defence of the persons here described, though the expression in the Considerations which brought on the attack, manifestly related to a different subject. The Author of the Considerations speaks of <HI>being bound</HI> to <HI>keep up</HI> these forms until relieved by proper Authority; of <HI>ministerially</HI> complying with what we are not able to remove: alluding, no doubt, to the case of <HI>Church Governors,</HI> who are the instru∣ments of imposing a Subscription which they may disapprove. But the Answerer, taking it for granted, that <HI>ministerially complying</HI> meant the <HI>com∣pliance of ministers,</HI> i. e. of clergymen officiating in their Functions, has, by a quibbk, or a blunder, transferred the passage to a sense for which it was not intended.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>The 40th page of the Answer intro∣duces
a paragraph of considerable length,
the sum however and substance of which
is this—that if Subscription to Articles
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
of faith were removed, confusion would
ensue; the people would be distracted
with the disputes of their teachers, and
the pulpits filled with controversy and
contradiction.—Upon this <HI>Fact</HI> we join
issue, and the more readily as this is a
sort of reasoning we all understand.—The
extent of the Legislator's right may
be an abstruse enquiry, but whether a
Law does more good or harm, is a plain
question which every man can ask. Now,
that distressing many of the Clergy, and
corrupting others;—that keeping out of
Churches, good Christians and faithful
citizens;—that making parties in the
State, by giving occasion to Sects and
separations in Religion;—that these are
inconveniences, no man in his senses will
deny. The question therefore is, What
advantage do you find in the opposite
scale to balance these inconveniencies?
The simple advantage pretended is, that
you hereby prevent <HI>wrangling</HI> and con∣tention
in the Pulpit. Now, in the first
place, I observe that allowing this evil to
be as grievous and as certain as you
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
please, the most that can be necessary for
the prevention of it is, to enjoin your
Preachers as to such points Silence and
Neutrality. In the next place, I am
convinced, that the danger is greatly
magnified. We hear little of these points
at present in our Churches and public
teaching, and it is not probable that
leaving them at large would elevate them
into more importance, or make it more
worth mens' while to quarrel about them.
—They would sleep in the same grave
with many other questions, of equal im∣portance
with themselves, or sink back
into their proper place, into topics of
speculation, or matters of debate from
the Press. None but men of some Re∣flection
would be forward to engage in
such subjects, and the least reflection
would teach a man that <HI>Preaching</HI> is not
the proper vehicle of Controversy:—Even
at present, says our Author, <HI>we
speak and write what we pleease with im∣punity;</HI>
and where is the mischief? or
what worse could ensue if Subscription
were removed?—Nor can I discover
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
any thing in the disposition of the pe∣titioning
Clergy that need alarm our
apprehensions. If they are impatient
under the Yoke, it is not from a desire to
hold forth their opinions to their congre∣gations,
but that they may be at liberty to
entertain them themselves without offence
to their consciences, or ruin to their for∣tunes.</P>
<P>Our Author has added, by way of
<HI>make-weight,</HI> to his argument, <HI>that many
common Christians, he believes, would be
greatly scandalized if you take away their
Creeds and Catechisms, and strike out of
the Liturgy such things as they have
always esteemed essential</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 42-41.</NOTE>. Whatever
reason there may be for this <HI>belief</HI> at
present, there certainly was much greater
at the Reformation, as the Popish ritual
which was then <HI>taken away,</HI> had a fasci∣nation
and antiquity which ours cannot
pretend to. Many were probably <HI>scanda∣lized</HI>
at parting with their Beads and their
Mass-Books, that lived afterwards to
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
thank those who taught them better
things. Reflection we hope in some,
and Time we are sure in all, will recon∣cile
men to alterations established in
reason. If there be any danger, it is
from some of the Clergy, who with the
Answerer would rather suffer the <HI>vine∣yard</HI>
to be overgrown with <HI>weeds,</HI> than
<HI>stir the ground,</HI> or what is worse, call
these weeds <HI>the fairest flowers in the
garden.</HI> Such might be ready enough to
raise a hue and cry against all innovators
in religion, as <HI>overturners of churches</HI>
and spoilers of temples.</P>
<P>But the cause, which of all others stood
most in the way of the late petitions for
relief, was an apprehension that religious
institutions cannot be disturbed without
awakening animosities and dissentions in
the state, of which no man knows the
consequence. Touch but Religion, we
are told, and it bursts forth into a flame.
Civil distractions may be composed by
fortitude and perseverance, but neither
Reason nor Authority can controll, there
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
is neither charm nor drug, which will
asswage, the passions of mankind when
called forth in the cause, and to the battles
of Religion. We were concerned to hear
this language from <HI>some</HI> who in other
instances have manifested a constancy and
resolution which no confusion, nor ill
aspect of public affairs could intimidate.
—After all, is there any real foundation
for these terrors? Is not this whole
danger like the Lion of the slothful, the
creature of our fears, and the excuse of
indolence? Was it proposed to <HI>make</HI>
articles, instead of <HI>removing</HI> them, there
would be room for the objection. But
it is obvious that Subscription to the 39
Articles might be altered or withdrawn,
upon general principles of justice and
expediency, without reviving one re∣ligious
controversy; or calling into dis∣pute
a single proposition they contain.
Who should excite disturbances?—Those
who are relieved, will not: and unless
Subscription were like a tax which being
taken from one, must be laid with ad∣ditional
weight upon another, is it pro∣bable
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
that any will complain that they
are oppressed, because their brethren are
relieved? or that those who are so <HI>strong
in the faith</HI> will refuse to <HI>bear with the
infirmities of the weak?</HI> The few who
upon principles of this sort opposed the
application of the Dissenters, were re∣pulsed
from Parliament with disdain,
even by those who were no friends to
the application itself.</P>
<P>The Question concerning the object
of worship is attended I confess with dif∣ficulty:
It seems almost directly to divide
the Worshippers. But let the Church
pare down her excrescencies till she comes
to this Question; let her discharge from
her Liturgy Controversies unconnected
with devotion; let her try what may be
done for all sides by worshipping God in
that generality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If a Christian can think it an intolerable thing to worship one God through one Mediator <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> in company with any such as differ from him in their notions about the metaphysical nature of <HI>Christ,</HI> or of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> or the like; I am sorry for it. I remember the like objection made at the beginning of the Reformation by the <HI>Luthe∣rans</HI> against the lawfulness of communicating with <HI>Zuinglius,</HI> and his followers; because they had not the same notion with them of the elements in the Sacrament. And there was the same objection once against holding communion with any such as had not the lame notions with themselves about the secret decrees of God relating to the Predestination and Reprobation of particular persons. But what∣ever those men may please themselves with think∣ing, who are sure they are arrived at the perfect knowledge of the most abstruse points, this they may be certain of, that in the present state of the Church, even supposing only such as are accounted orthodox to be joined together in one visible commu∣nion, they communicate together with a very great variety and confusion of notions, either compre∣hending nothing plain and distinct, or differring from one another as truly and as essentially as others differ from them all: nay with more certain diffe∣rence with relation to the object of worship than if all prayers were directed (as Bishop <HI>Bull</HI> says, almost all were in the first ages) to God or the Father, through the Son. <HI>Hoadly</HI>'s Answer to Dr. <HI>Hare</HI>'s Sermon.</NOTE> of expression, in which
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
he himself has left some points; let her
dismiss many of her Articles, and con∣vert
those which she retains into terms of
Peace; let her recall the terrors she has
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
suspended over freedom of enquiry; let
the Toleration she allows to Dissenters be
made <HI>absolute;</HI> let her invite men to
search the Scriptures; let her Governors
encourage the studious and learned of all
persuasions:—Let her do this—and she
will be secure of the thanks of her own
Clergy, and what is more, of their sincerity.
A greater consent may grow out
of enquiry than many at present are
aware of, and the few who, after all,
shall think it necessary to recede from
our communion, will acknowledge the
necessity to be inevitable; will respect
the equity and moderation of the estab∣lished
Church, and live in peace with all
its members.</P>
<P>I know not whether I blight to men∣tion,
among so many more serious rea∣sons,
that even the Governors of the
Church themselves would find their ease
and account in conferring to an Altera∣tion.
—For besides the difficulty of de∣fending
those decayed fortifications, and
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
the indecency of deserting them, they
either are, or will soon find themselves
in the situation of a master of a family,
whose servants know more of his secrets
than it is proper for them to know, and
whose whispers and whose threats must
be bought off at an expence which will
drain the <HI>Apostolic Chamber</HI> dry.</P>
<P>Having thus examined in their order,
and as far as I understood them, the
several answers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his last note our Author breaks forth into <HI>astonishment</HI> and indignation, at the <HI>folly, injustice and indecency</HI> of comparing oar Church to the Jewish in our Saviour's time, and even to the <HI>Tower of Babel.</HI> Mistaking the Church, in this last com∣parison, for one of her <HI>Monuments</HI> (which, indeed, with most people of his complexion, stands for the same thing) erected to prevent our dispersion from that grand centre of catholic dominion; or in the words of a late celebrated Castle-builder, <HI>to keep us together.</HI> If there be any <HI>indecency</HI> in such a comparison, it must be chargeable on those who lead us to it, by making use of the same terms with the original Architects, and to which the Author of the Considerations evidently alludes. This detached note is concluded with as detached, and no less curious an observation, which the Writer thinks may be a <HI>sufficient answer</HI> to the whole, namely, that the Author of the Considerations <HI>has wrought no miracles for the conviction of the Answerer and his ossociates.</HI> For what purpose this observa∣tion can be <HI>sufficient,</HI> it is not easy to guess, except it be designed to insinuate, what may perhaps really be the case, that no less than a miracle will serve to cast out that kind of spirit which has taken so full possession of them; or ever bring them to a sound mind, and a sincere love of truth.</NOTE> given by our Author
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
to the objections against the present mode
of Subscription, it now remains, by way
of summing up the evidence, to bring
<HI>forward</HI> certain other Arguments con∣tained
in the Considerations, to which
no answer has been attempted. It is
contended then,
<Q><P>I. That stating any doctrine in a Con∣fession
of Faith with a greater degree
of <HI>precision</HI> than the Scriptures have
done, is in effect to say, that the
Scriptures have not stated it with <HI>pre∣cision</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
enough; in other words, that
the Scriptures are not sufficient.—<HI>Mere
declamation.</HI></P>
<P>II. That this experiment of leaving men
at liberty, and points of doctrine at
large, has been attended with the im∣provement
of religious knowledge,
where and whenever it has been tried.
And to this cause, so far as we can see,
is owing the advantage which Pro∣testant
countries in this respect possess
above their popish neighbours.—<HI>No
Answer.</HI></P>
<P>III. That keeping people out of churches,
who might be admitted, consistently
with every end of public worship, and
excluding men from communion who
desire to embrace it, upon the terms
that God prescribes, is certainly not
encouraging, but rather causing men
to <HI>forsake the assembling of themselves
together.—No Answer.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51"/>
IV. That men are deterred from search∣ing
the Scriptures, by the fear of find∣ing
there more or less than they looked
for; that is, something inconsistent
with what they have already given
their assent to, and must, at their
peril abide by.—<HI>No Answer.</HI></P>
<P>V. That it is not giving Truth a fair
chance to decide points at one certain
time, and by one set of men, which
had much better be left to the succes∣sive
enquiries of different ages and
different persons;—<HI>No Answer.</HI></P>
<P>VI. That it tends to multiply infidels
amongst us, by exhibiting Christianity
under a form, and in a system which
many are disgusted with, who yet will
not be at the pains to enquire after
any other.—<HI>No Answer.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>At the conclusion of his pamphlet
our Author is pleased to acknowledge,
what few, I find, care any longer to
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
deny, <HI>that there are some things in our
Articles and Liturgy which he should be
glad to see amended, many which he should
be willing to give up to the scruples of
others,</HI> but that the heat and violence
with which redress has been pursued,
preclude all hope of accommodation and
tranquillity—that <HI>we had better wait
therefore for more peaceable times and
be contented with our present constitution
as it is,</HI> until a fairer prospect shall ap∣pear
of changing it for the better.—After
returning thanks, in the name of
the <HI>Fraternity,</HI> to him and to all who
touch the burden of Subscription with
but one of their fingers, I would wish to
leave with them this observation, that
as the Man who attacks a flourishing
establishment writes with a halter round
his neck, few ever will be found to
attempt alterations but men of more
spirit than prudence, of more sincerity
than caution, of warm, eager, and impe∣tuous
tempers; that, consequently, if
we are to wait for Improvement till the
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
cool, the calm, the discreet part of man∣kind
begin it, 'till Church Governors
solicit, or Ministers of State propose it
—I will venture to pronounce, that
(without <HI>his</HI> interposition with whom
nothing is impossible) we may remain
as we are, 'till the <HI>renovation of all
things.</HI></P>
