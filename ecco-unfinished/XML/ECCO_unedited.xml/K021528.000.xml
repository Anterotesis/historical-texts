<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. HAVARD.</BYLINE>
<L>AN antient sage, when death approach'd his bed,</L>
<L>Consign'd to Pluto his devoted head;</L>
<L>And, that no fiend might hiss, or prove uncivil,</L>
<L>With vows and pray'rs he fairly brib'd the Devil:</L>
<L>Yet neither vows nor pray'rs, nor rich oblation,</L>
<L>Cou'd always save the sinner—from damnation.</L>
<L>Thus authors, tottering on the brink of fate:</L>
<L>The critick's rage with prologues deprecate;</L>
<L>Yet oft the trembling bard implores in vain,</L>
<L>The wit profess'd, turns out a dunce in grain:</L>
<L>No plea can then avert the dreadful sentence,</L>
<L>He must be damn'd—in spite of all repentance.</L>
<L>Here justice seems from her straight line to vary,</L>
<L>No guilt attends a fact involuntary;</L>
<L>This maxim the whole cruel charge destroys,</L>
<L>No Poet sure was ever dull—by choice.</L>
<L>So pleads our Culprit in his own defence,</L>
<L>You cannot prove his dullness is—prepense.</L>
<L>He means to please—He owns no other view;</L>
<L>And now presents ye with—a Sea-ragout.</L>
<L>A dish—howe'er you relish his endeavours,</L>
<L>Replete with a variety of flavours:</L>
<L>A stout Hibernian, and ferocious Scot,</L>
<L>Together boil in our inchanted pot;</L>
<L>To taint these viands with the true fumet,</L>
<L>He shreds a musty, vain, French—martinet.</L>
<L>This stale ingredient might our porridge ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</L>
<L>Without some acid juice of English tar.</L>
<L>To rouse the appetite the drum shall rattle,</L>
<L>And the desert shall be a bloodless battle.</L>
<L>What heart will fail to glow, what eye to brighten,</L>
<L>When Britain's wrath arrous'd begins to lighten!</L>
<L>Her thunders roll—her fearless sons advance,</L>
<L>And her red ensigns wave o'er the pale flow'rs of France.</L>
<L>Such game our fathers play'd in days of yore,</L>
<L>When Edward's banners fann'd the Gallick shore;</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>
When Howard's arm Eliza's vengeance hurl'd,</L>
<L>And Drake diffus'd her fame around the world:</L>
<L>Still shall that God-like flame your bosoms fire,</L>
<L>The gen'rous son shall emulate the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire;</L>
<L>Her antient splendor England shall maintain,</L>
<L>O'er distant realms extend her genial reign,</L>
<L>And rise—th' unrival'd empress of the main.</L>

<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, if this be taking diversion on the
water, God send me safe on English
ground! and if ever I come in sight of
the Sea again, may a watry grave be my portion.—First,
to be terrified with the thoughts of
drowning—Secondly, to be tossed and tumbled
about like a foot-ball—Thirdly, to be drenched
with Sea-water—Fourthly, to be stunk to death
with pitch and tar and the savoury scent of my
fellow-sufferers—Fifthly, to be racked with per∣petual
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
puking “'till my guts are turned inside out”—
And sixthly and lastly, to be taken prisoner and
plundered by the French!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough—Enough—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough!—aye, and to spare—I wish I could
give part to those who envy my good fortune—
But, how will the good Lady Bloomwell moralize
when she finds her daughter Miss Harriet is fallen
into the hands of Monsieur de Champignon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more—that reflection alarms me!—yet I
have nothing to fear—as there is no war declared,
we shall soon be released: and in the mean time
the French will treat us with their usual polite∣ness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pox on their politeness! ah master! commend
me to the blunt sincerity of the true surly British
mastiff—The ras<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allion that took my purse
bowed so low, and paid me so many compliments,
that I ventured to argue the matter in hopes of
convincing him he was in the wrong—but he soon
stopped my mouth with a vengeance, by clapping
a cocked pistol to my ear, and telling me he should
have the honour to blow my brains out—Another
of those polite gentlemen begged leave to ex∣change
hats with me—A third fell in love with
my silver shoe-buckles—Nay, that very individual
nice buttock of beef, which I had just begun to
survey with looks of desire, after the dismal eva∣cuation
I had undergone, was ravished from my
sight by two famished French wolves, who beheld
it with equal joy and astonishment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess they plundered us with great dex∣terity
and dispatch; and even Monsieur de Cham∣pignon
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
the commander did not keep his hands
clear of the pillage—An instance of rapaciousness
I did not expect to meet with in a gentleman and
an officer.—Sure he will behave as such to
Harriet!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith! not to flatter you, Sir, I take him to be
one of those fellows who owe their good fortune
to nothing less than their good works—He first
rifled your mistress, and then made love to her
with great gallantry—but you was in the right to
call yourself her brother—if he knew you were
his rival you might pass your time very disagree∣ably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are two officers on board, who seem to
disapprove of his conduct; they would not be
concerned in robbing us, nor would they suffer
their soldiers to take any share of the prey, but
condoled Harriet and me on our misfortune, with
marks of real concern.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean lieutenant Oclabber and ensign Mac∣laymore,
a couple of damn'd renegadoes!—you
lean upon a broken reed if you trust to their com∣passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oclabber I knew at Paris, when I travelled with
my brother, and he then bore the character of an
honest man and a brave officer—The other is an
Highlander, excluded (I suppose) from his own
country on account of the late rebellion; for that
reason, perhaps, more apt to pity the distressed.—
I see them walking this way in close conference—
While I go down to the cabin to visit my dear
Harriet, you may lounge about and endeavour to
over-hear their conversation.</P>

<P>Arrah, for what?—I don't value Monsieur de
Champignon a rotten potatoe; and when the ship
goes ashore, I will be after asking him a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hivil
question, as I told him to his face, when he turned
his back upon me in the cabin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MACLAYMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Weel, weel, maister Oclabber, I wonna tak
upon me to say a'together ye're in the wrang—but
ye ken there's a time for a'things; and we man
gang hooly and fairly while we're under command.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OCLABBER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may talk as you plaise, Mr. Maclaymore—you're
a man of learning, Honey. Indeed, in∣deed
I am always happy when you are spaiking,
whether I'am asleep or awake a gra. But, by my
saoul I will maintain, after the breath is out of my
body, that “the English pleasure boat had no right
to be taken before the declaration of war;” much
more the prisoners to be plundered, which you
know is the prerogative of pyrates and privateers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MACLAYMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, the law of nations does na prescind
that privilege in actual war; for ye ken in an∣cient
times, the victor teuk the <HI>spolia opima;</HI> and
in my country to this very day we follow the auld
practice, <HI>pecudum praedas agere.</HI> But, then, ye
man tak notice, nae gentleman was plunder a
leddy—awa', awa'!—fie for shame! and a right
sonsy damsel too. I'm sure it made my heart wae,
to see the saut brine come happing o'er her win∣some

<P>Devil burn me! but my bowels wept salt wa∣ter

och! the delicate creature!—she's the very mo∣ral
of my own honey dear Sheelah o'Shannaghan
“whom I left big with child in the county of
Fermanaghan, grammachree!”—Ochone my
dear Sheelah!—“Look here, she made me
this sword-belt of the skin of a sea wolf that I
shot at the mouth of the Shannon—and
I gave her at parting, a nun's discipline to keep
her sweet flesh in order—och! my dear
honey captain, (cried she) I shall never do pen∣nance,
but I will be thinking of you”—
Ah poor Sheelah she once met with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mis∣fortune
gra: we were all a merry-making at the
castle of Ballyclough; and so Sheelah having
drank a cup too much, honey, fell down stairs out
of a window. When I came to her she told me she
was speechless; “and by my shoul it was tree long
weeks before she got upon her legs again:”
then I composed a lamentation in the Irish tongue—and
sung it to the tune of <HI>drimmendoo;</HI> but, a
friend of mine of the order of St. Francis, has
made a relation of it into English, and it goes very
well to the words of Elen a Roon.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Harriet, have you good nature enough
to forgive me for having exposed you to all these
dangers and misfortunes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't but be pleased with an event which has
introduced me to the acquaintance of the accom∣plished
Champignon, ha, ha, ha.!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can't imagine how happy I am to see you
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
bear your misfortune with such good humour, af∣ter
the terror you underwent at our being taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was indeed terribly alarmed when a cannon
shot came whistling over our heads; and not a
little dejected when I found myself a prisoner—
but, I imagine all danger diminishes, or at least
loses part of its terror, the nearer you approach it:
and as for this Champignon, he is such a con∣temptible
fellow, that upon recollection, I almost
despise myself for having been afraid of him.—
O'my conscience! I believe all courage is acquired
from practice.—I don't doubt but in time I
should be able to stand a battery, myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my fair Thalestris, should you ever be
attacked, I hope the aggressor will fall before
you.—Champignon has certainly exceeded
his orders, and we shall be released as soon as a
representation can be made to the French court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be loth to trouble the court of France
with matters of so little consequence. Don't you
think it practicable to persuade the captain to set
us at liberty? There is one figure in rhetoric
which I believe he would hardly resist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guess your meaning, and the experiment shall
be tried, if we fail of success from another quar∣ter.
I intend to make myself known to Oclabber,
with whom I was formerly acquainted, and take
his advice. He and the Scotch ensign are at va∣riance
with Champignon, and disapprove of our
being made prisoners.</P>

<SPEAKER>HEARTLY to BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sir, you have been fishing the bonny Scot:
have you caught any intelligence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have done your business—Capt. Maclay∣more
and I have been drinking a bottle of sour
wine to the health of Miss Harriet and your wor∣ship;
in a word, he is wholly devoted to your
service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>“Pray, Mr. Brush, what method did you take
to ingratiate yourself with that proud, stalking
Highlander?”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>“I won his heart with some transient encomi∣ums
on his country. I affected to admire his
plaid, as an improvement on the Roman toga;
swore it was a most soldierly garb; and said, I
did not wonder to see it adopted by a nation
equally renowned for learning and valour.”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>“These insidious compliments could not fail to
undermine his loftiness.”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>“He adjusted his bonnet, rolled his quid from
one cheek to the other, threw his plaid over
his left shoulder with an air of importance,
strutted to the farther end of the deck; then
returning with his hard features unbended into
a ghastly smile,” “By my saul! man (says
he) ye're na fule; I see ye ken foo weel how to
mak proper distinctions—you and I man be
better acquanted.'—I bowed very low in re∣turn
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
turn for the great honour he did me—hinted,
that, though now I was in the station of a ser∣vant,
I had some pretensions to family; and
sighing, cried <HI>tempora mutantur, et no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mutamur

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>“That scrap of Latin was a home thrust.—You see, sirrah, the benefit of a charity school.”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>“Ay, little did I think, when I was flogged
for neglecting my accidence, that ever my learn∣ing
would turn to such account—Captain
Maclaymore was surprized to hear me speak
Latin: yet he found fault with my pronuncia∣tion.—He
shook me by the hand, though I
was a little shy of that compliment, and said
he did not expact to find flowers under a nettle:”
“but I put him in mind of the singat cat, for I
was better than I was bonny—then he car∣ried
me to his cabin, where we might discourse
more freely; told me the captain was <HI>a light-headed
guse,</HI> and expressed his concern at your
captivity, which he said was a flagrant infrac∣tion
of the treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle.</HI>”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>“There I hope you backed his opinion with all
your eloquence.”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>“I extolled his understanding; interested his
gallantry in the cause of a distressed lady; and
in order to clinch my remonstrance, told him
that my master's great grandmother's aunt was
a Scotchwoman of the name of Mackintosh,
and that Mr. Heartly piqued himself on the
Highland blood that ran in his veins.”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>“I'm obliged to your invention for the honour
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
of that alliance—I hope the discovery had a
proper effect upon my cousin Maclaymore.”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>“He no sooner heard that particular, than he
started up, crying,” “What the deel say ye?
Mackintosh!—swunds man! that's the name
of my ain mither—whakens but mester Heartly
and I may be coozens seven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een times removed:”
“then he gave me a full account of his pedigree
for twelve generations, and hawked up the names
of his progenitors till they set my teeth on edge:
to conclude.” he has promised to give you all
the assistance in his power, and even to favour our
escape; for, over and above his other motives,
I find he longs to return to his own country, and
thinks a piece of service done to an English gentle∣man
may enable him to gratify that inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what scheme have you laid for our escape?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>The boat is along side,—our men are permitted
to walk the deck—when the captain retires to
rest, and the watch is relieving, nothing will be
more easy than to step on board of our own galley,
cut the rope, hoist the sails, and make the best of
our way to Old England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, you don't consider that Mr. de Champig∣non,
if alarmed, may slip his cable and give us
chace—nay, compliment us with a dish of
sugar plumbs that may be very hard of digestion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, the friendship of Maclaymore will be of
service: for, as soon as our flight is known, he
and his men, on pretence of being alert, will make
such a bustle and con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion, that nothing can be
done until we are out of their reach; and then we
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
must trust to our canvas and the trim of our ves∣sel,
which is a prime sailer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIET.</SPEAKER>

to co-operate with the ensign.</P>

<P>I'll tell you what, Mr. Heartly, we officers

<P>Yes, yes, Madam, safe enough for this bout—
The two land officers performed their parts to a

into the boat, without being disturbed by the cen∣tries
who were tutored for the purpose; and they
were almost out of sight, before Champignon was
alarmed by a starved Frenchman, whose hunger
kept him awake—but, now they have doubled

<P>Nay, don't accuse your Master unjustly—
you know how unwillingly he complied with my

<P>Gentlemen, your's is the fortune of the day.
You ought to be kind to us, for we have given
you very little trouble.—Our commander
there, is a very shivil person, gra; he don't turst
after the blood of his enemy. As for the soldiers, I
shall say nothing; but upon my saoul! now they're
the nimblest dead men I ever saw in the days of
my life! about two minutes agone they were ly∣ing
like so many slaughtered sheep, and now they
are all scamper'd off about their business.</P>

<P>Gentlemen, I'm heartily glad of having an op∣portunity

<SPEAKER>LYON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a'n't used to make speeches, Madam, but I'm
very glad it was in my power to serve such a fine
lady, especially as my old school-fellow Heartly
is so much concerned in your deliverance. As for
this fair weather spark, Monsieur de Champignon,
if he can't shew a commission authorizing him to
make depredations on the English, I shall order
him to be hoisted up to the yard's arm by the neck
as a pyrate; but if he can produce his orders, he
shall be treated as a prisoner of war, tho' not be∣fore
he has restored what he pilfer'd from you and
Mr. Heartly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>At that rate I'm afraid I shall lose an admirer.
You see, Monsieur de Champignon, the old pro∣verb
fulfilled; hanging and marriage go by de∣stiny:
yet I should be very sorry to occasion even
the death of a sinner.</P>

<L>AYE—now I can with pleasure look around,</L>

<L>Expos'd to fire and water, sword and bullet—</L>

<L>Had not the British Lyon quell'd the Gallic Ass—</L>
<L>By Champignon a wretched victim led</L>
<L>To cloister'd cell, or more detested bed.</L>
<L>My days in pray'r and fasting I had spent:</L>
<L>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nun, or wife, alike a penitent.</L>
<L>His gallantry, so confident and eager,</L>
<L>Had prov'd a mess of delicate soupe—maigre.</L>
<L>To bootless longings I had fallen a martyr:</L>
<L>But, Heav'n be prais'd, the Frenchman caught a Tartar.</L>

<L>Shall he come safe to port, or sink at sea?</L>
<L>Your sentence, sweet or bitter, soft or sore,</L>
