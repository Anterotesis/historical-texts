<P>THE compunction of Richard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X.</NOTE> for his unduti∣ful
behaviour towards his father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1189.</NOTE> was very du∣rable,
and influenced him in the choice of his
ministers and servants after his accession. Those who
had seconded and favoured his rebellion, instead of meet∣ing
with that honour and trust which they expected,
were surprised to find, that they lay under disgrace with
the new King, and were on all occasions hated and de∣spised
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
by him. The faithful ministers of Henry, who had
vigorously opposed all the enterprizes of his sons, were
received with open arms, and were continued in those
employments, which they had honourably discharged to
their former master<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 655. Bened. Abb. p. 547. M. Paris, p. 107.</NOTE>. This prudent conduct might be
the result of reflection; but in a prince, like Richard, so
much guided by passion, and so little by policy, it was
commonly ascribed to a principle still more virtuous and
more honourable.</P>
<P>RICHARD, that he might make atonement to one
parent for his breach of duty to the other, immediately
sent orders for releasing the Queen-dowager from the con∣finement
in which she had been so long detained<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ben. Abb. p. 549. M. Paris, p. 107. Trivet, p. 97. Diceto, p. 646. Gervase, p. 1547.</NOTE>; and
he entrusted her with the government of England, till
his arrival in that kingdom. His bounty to his brother
John was rather profuse and imprudent. Besides bestow∣ing
on him the county of Mortaigne in Normandy,
granting him a pension of four thousand marks a-year,
and marrying him to Avisa, the daughter of the earl of
Glocester, by whom he inherited all the possessions of that
opulent family; he increased this appanage, which the
late King had destined him, by other extensive grants
and concessions. He conferred on him the whole estate
of William Peverell, which had escheated to the crown:
He put him in possession of eight castles, with all the
forests and honours annexed to them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 107.</NOTE>: He delivered
over to him no less than six earldoms, Cornwal, Devon,
Somerset, Nottingham, Dorset, Lancaster and Derby<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 645. Bened. Abb. p. 555, 577. W. Homing. p. 518, Bromp∣ton, p. 1178. Knyghton, p. 2401.</NOTE>.
And endeavouring, by favours, to fix that vicious prince
in his duty, he put it too much in his power, whenever
he pleased, to depart from it.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6"/>
THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's preparation for the cru∣sade.</NOTE> impelled more by the love of military
glory than by superstition, acted, from the beginning of
his reign, as if the sole purpose of his government had
been the relief of the holy land, and the recovery of Je∣rusalem
from the Saracens. This zeal against infidels,
being communicated to his subjects, broke out in London
on the day of his coronation, and made them find a cru∣sade
less dangerous, and attended with more immediate
profit. The prejudices of the age had made the lending
of money on interest pass by the invidious name of usury;
yet the necessity of the practice had still continued it,
and the greatest part of that kind of dealing fell every
where into the hands of the Jews; who, being already
infamous on account of their religion, had no honour
to lose, and were apt to exercise a profession, odious in
itself, by every kind of rigor, and even sometimes by ra∣pine
and extortion. The industry and frugality of that
people had put them in possession of all the ready money,
which the idleness and profusion of the English, as well as
of other European nations, enabled them to lend on
exorbitant and unequal interest. The monkish writers
represent it as a great stain on the wise and equitable go∣vernment
of Henry, that he had carefully protected this
infidel race from all injuries and insults; but the zeal of
Richard afforded the populace a pretence for exercising
their animosity against them. The King had issued a
proclamation, prohibiting their appearance at his corona∣tion;
but some of them, bringing him large presents
from their nation, presumed, in confidence of that merit,
to approach the hall in which he dined; and being dis∣covered,
they were exposed to the insults and injuries of the bystanders<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 657. Bened. Abb. p. 560. M. Paris, p. 108. Brompton, p. 1156. Knyghton, p. 2401.</NOTE>. They took to flight; the people pur∣sued
them; the rumor was spread, that the King had
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
given orders to massacre all the Jews; a command so a∣greeable
was executed in an instant on such as fell into
the hands of the populace; those who had kept at home
were exposed to equal danger; the people, moved by ra∣pacity
and zeal, broke into their houses, which they
plundered, after having murdered the owners; where the
Jews barricadoed their doors, and defended themselves
with vigour, the rabble set fire to the houses, and made
way thro' the flames to exercise their pillage and vi∣olence
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 163. Knyghton, p. 2401.</NOTE>; the usual licentiousness of London, which the sovereign power with difficulty restrained, broke out with
fury, and continued these outrages; the houses of the
rich citizens, tho' Christians, were next attacked and
plundered<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 657. Bened. Abb. p. 560. M. Paris, p. 108. W. Heming. p. 514.</NOTE>; and weariness and satiety at last put an end
to the disorder: Yet when the King impowered Glanville,
the justiciary, to inquire into the authors of these crimes,
the guilt was found to involve so many of the most con∣siderable
inhabitants, that it was deemed more prudent
to drop the prosecution; and very few suffered the pu∣nishment
due to this enormity<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 647. Knyghton, p. 2401.</NOTE>. But the disorder stop∣ped
not at London. The inhabitants of the other cities
of England, hearing of this execution of the Jews, imi∣tated
the barbarous example<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Dunst. p. 43. Wykes, p. 34. W. Heming. p. 516. Diceto, p 651.</NOTE>; and in York, five hundred
of that nation, who had retired into the castle for safety,
and found themselves unable to defend the place, mur∣dered
their own wives and children, threw the dead bo∣dies
over the walls upon the populace, and then setting
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire to the houses, perished in the flames<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 665. Bened. Abb. p. 586. M. Paris, p. 111.</NOTE>. The gentry
of the neighbourhood, who were all indebted to the
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
Jews, ran to the cathedral, where their bonds were kept,
and made a solemn bonefire of the papers before the altar<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 518.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE antient situation of England, when the people
possessed little riches and the public no credit, made it
impossible for the sovereigns to bear the expences of a
steady or durable war, even on their frontiers; much less
could they find regular means for the support of such
distant expeditions as those into Palestine, which were
more the result of popular frenzy than of sober reason or
deliberate policy. Richard, therefore, knew, that he must
carry with him all the treasure requisite for his enterprize,
and that both the remoteness of his own country and its
poverty made it unable to furnish him with those con∣tinued
supplies, which the exigencies of so perilous a war
must necessarily require. His father had left him a trea∣sure
of above an hundred thousand marks<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 656.</NOTE>; and the
King, negligent of every interest, but that of present
glory, endeavoured to augment this sum by all expedi∣ents,
however pernicious to the public, or dangerous to
royal authority<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 568.</NOTE>: He put to sale the revenues and ma∣nors
of the crown; the offices of greatest trust and
power, even those of forester and sheriff, which antiently
were so important<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The sheriff had antiently both the administration of justice and the management of the King's revenue committed to him in the county. <HI>See Hale of Sheriffs Accounts.</HI></NOTE>, became venal; the dignity of chief
justiciary, in whose hands was lodged the whole execu∣tion
of the laws, was sold to Hugh de Puzas, bishop of
Durham, for a thousand marks; the same prelate bought
the earldom of Northumberland for his life<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 109.</NOTE>; many of
the champions of the cross, who had repented of their
vow, purchased the liberty of violating it; and Richard,
who stood less in need of men than money, readily, on
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
these conditions, dispensed with their attendance. Elated
with the hopes of fame, which in that age attended no
wars but those against the infidels, he was blind to every
other consideration; and when some of his wiser mi∣nisters
objected against this dissipation of the revenue and
power of the crown, he replied, that he would sell Lon∣don
itself if he could find a purchaser<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 519. Knyghton, p. 2402.</NOTE>. Nothing in∣deed
could be a stronger proof how negligent he was of
all future interests in comparison of the crusade, than his
selling, for so small a sum as 10,000 marks, the vassalage
of Scotland, together with the fortresses of Roxborough
and Berwic, the greatest acquisition which had been made
by his father during the course of his victorious reign;
and his accepting the homage of William in the usual
terms, merely for the territories which that prince held
in England<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 662. Rymer, vol. i. p. 64. M. West. p. 257.</NOTE>. Numerous exactions were practised on
the English of all ranks and stations: Menaces were em∣ployed
both against the innocent and the guilty, in order
to force money from them: And where a pretence was
wanting against the rich, the King obliged them, by
the fear of his displeasure, to lend him sums, which, he
knew, it would never be in his power to repay.</P>
<P>BUT Richard, tho' he sacrificed every interest and
consideration to the success of this pious enterprize, car∣ried
so little the appearance of sanctity in his conduct,
that Fulk, curate of Neuilly, a zealous preacher of the
crusade, who from that merit had acquired the privi∣lege
of speaking the boldest truths, advised him to rid
himself of his notorious vices, particularly his pride, ava∣rice,
and voluptuousness, which he called the King's
three favourite daughters. <HI>You counsel well,</HI> replied
Richard; <HI>and I hereby dispose of the first to the Templars, of
the second to the Benedictines, and of the third to my prelates.</HI></P>
<P>RICHARD, jealous of attempts which might be made
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
on England during his absence, laid prince John, as
well as his natural brother Geoffrey, archbishop of York,
under engagements, confirmed by their oaths, that nei∣ther
of them should enter that kingdom till his return;
tho' he thought proper, before his departure, to withdraw
this prohibition<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 664. Bened. Abb. p. 584. Brompton, p. 1171.</NOTE>. The administration was left in the
hands of Hugh, bishop of Durham, and of Longchamp,
bishop of Ely, whom he appointed justiciaries and guar∣dians
of the realm<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 663. Bened. Abb. p. 584. M. Paris, p. 110.</NOTE>. The latter was a Norman of mean
birth, and of a violent character; who by art and address
had insinuated himself into favour, whom Richard had
created chancellor, and whom he had engaged the Pope
also to invest with the legatine authority, that, by cen∣tering
every kind of power in his person, he might the
better ensure the public tranquillity<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 665. 702. Bened. Abb p. 585.</NOTE>. All the military
and turbulent spirits flocked about the person of the
King, and were impatient to distinguish themselves a∣gainst
the infidels in Asia; whither his inclinations, his
engagements, led him, and whither he was impelled by
messages from the King of France, ready to embark in
this enterprize<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 109. Diceto, p. 649. Rymer, vol. i. p. 63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Emperor Frederic, a prince of great spirit and
conduct, had already taken the road to Palestine at the
head of 150,000 men, collected from Germany and all
the northern states; and having surmounted every ob∣stacle
thrown in his way by the artifices of the Greeks
and the power of the infidels, had penetrated to the
borders of Syria; when, bathing in the cold river
Cydnus, during the greatest heat of the summer-season,
he was seized with a mortal distemper,
which put an end to his life and his rash enter∣prize
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 556.</NOTE>. His army, under the command of his son Con∣rade,
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
reached Palestine; but was so diminished by fatigue,
famine, maladies, and the sword, that it scarce amounted
to eight thousand men; and was insufficient to make
any progress against the great power, valour, and con∣duct
of Saladin. These reiterated calamities, attending
the crusades, had taught the Kings of France and Eng∣land
the necessity of trying another road to the holy
land; and they determined to conduct their armies thither
by sea, to carry provisions along with them, and by means
of their naval power to maintain an open communication
with their own states, and with the western parts of Eu∣rope.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1190.</NOTE>
The first place of rendezvous was appointed in
the plains of Vezelay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th June.</NOTE> on the borders of Burgundy<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 660.</NOTE>;
and Philip and Richard, on their arrival there, found
their armies amount to 100,000 men<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vinisauf, p. 305.</NOTE>; an invincible
force, animated with glory and religion, conducted by
two warlike monarchs, provided with every thing which
their several dominions could afford, and not to be over∣come
but by their own misconduct, or by the unsur∣mountable
obstacles of nature.</P>
<P>THE French prince and the English here reiterated
their promises of mutual friendship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King sets out on the crusade.</NOTE> pledged their
faith not to invade each other's dominions during
the crusade, exchanged the oaths of all their barons and
prelates to the same effect, and subjected themselves to
the penalty of interdicts and excommunications, if they
should ever violate this public and solemn engagement<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 664. Bened. Abb. p. 583. Trivet, p. 99. Vinisauf, p. 305.</NOTE>.
They then separated; Philip took the road to Genoa,
Richard that to Marseilles, with a view of meeting their
fleets, which were severally appointed to rendezvous in
there harbours<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 666. Bened. Abb. p. 590. M. Paris, p. 112. Diceto, p. 605.</NOTE>. They put to sea; and nearly about the
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
same time, were obliged, by stress of weather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Sept.</NOTE> to take
shelter in Messina, where they were detained during the
whole winter. This event laid the foundation of animo∣sities,
which proved fatal to their enterprize.</P>
<P>RICHARD and Philip were, by the situation and ex∣tent
of their dominions, rivals in power; by their age
and inclinations, competitors for glory; and these causes
of emulation, which, had the princes been employed in
the field against the common enemy, might have stimu∣lated
them to martial enterprizes, soon excited, during
the present leisure and repose, quarrels between monarchs
of such a fiery character. Equally haughty, ambitious,
intrepid, and inflexible; they were irritated with the least
appearance of injury, and were incapable, by mutual
condescensions, to efface those causes of complaint, which
unavoidably arose between them. Richard, candid, sin∣cere,
undesigning, impolitic, violent, laid himself open,
on every occasion, to the designs of his antagonist; who,
provident, interested, deceitful, failed not to take all ad∣vantages
against him: And thus, both the circumstan∣ces
of their disposition in which they were similar, and
those in which they differed, rendered it impossible for
them to persevere in that harmony, which was so essen∣tial
to the success of their undertaking.</P>
<P>THE last King of Sicily and Naples was William II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsac∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in Si∣cily.</NOTE>
who had married Joan, sister to Richard, and who, dy∣ing
without issue, had bequeathed his dominions to his
paternal aunt, Constantia, the only legitimate offspring
surviving of Roger, the first sovereign of those states who
had been honoured with the royal title. This paincess
had, in expectation of that rich inheritance, been mar∣ried
to Henry VI. the present Emperor<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 580.</NOTE>; but Tancred,
her natural brother, had fixed such an interest among the
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>

<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
barons, that, taking advantage of Henry's absence,
he had acquired possession of the throne, and main∣tained
his claim, by force of arms, against all the efforts
of the Germans<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 663.</NOTE>. The approach of the crusaders natu∣rally
gave him apprehensions for his unstable government;
and he was uncertain, whether he had most reason to
dread the presence of the French or of the English mo∣narch.
Philip was engaged in strict alliance with the
Emperor, his competitor: Richard was disgusted by his ri∣gors
towards the Queen-dowager, whom the Sicilian
prince had confined in Palermo; because she had opposed
with all her interest his succession to the crown. Tan∣cred,
therefore, sensible of the present necessity, resolved
to pay court to both these formidable princes; and he was
not unsuccessful in his endeavours. He persuaded Philip
that it was highly improper for him to interrupt his enter∣prize
against the infidels, by any attempt against a Chris∣tian
prince: He restored Queen Joan to her liberty; and
even found means to make an alliance with Richard,
who stipulated by treaty to marry his nephew, Arthur,
the young duke of Brittany, to one of the daughters of
Tancred<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 676, 677. Bened. Abb. p. 615.</NOTE>. But before these terms of friendship were
agreed on, Richard, jealous both of Tancred and of the
inhabitants of Messina, had taken up his quarters in the
suburbs, and had possessed himself of a small fort, which
commanded the harbour; and he remained extremely on
his guard against their enterprizes. The citizens took
umbrage: Mutual insults and attacks passed between them
and the English:<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d October.</NOTE> Philip, who had quartered his troops
in the town, endeavoured to accommodate the quarrel, and
held a conference with Richard for that purpose. While
the two Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Octo∣ber.</NOTE> meeting in the open fields, were engaged
in discourse on this subject, a body of these Sicilians
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
seemed to be drawing towards them; and Richard pushed
forwards, in order to inquire into the reason of this ex∣traordinary
movement<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 608.</NOTE>. The English, insolent from
their power, and inflamed with former animosities, want∣ed
but a pretence for attacking the Messinese; and
they soon chaced them from the field, drove them into
the town, and entered with them at the gates. The
King employed his authority to restrain them from pil∣laging
and massacring the defenceless inhabitants; but
he gave orders, in token of his victory, that the standard
of England should be erected on the walls. Philip, who
considered that place as his quarters, exclaimed against the insult,
and ordered some of his troops to pull down
the standard: But Richard informed him by a messenger,
that tho' he himself would willingly remove that ground
of offence, he would not permit it to be done by others;
and if the French King attempted such an insult upon
him, he should not succeed but by the utmost effusion of
blood. Philip, contented with this species of haughty
submission, recalled his orders<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 674.</NOTE>: The difference was
seemingly accommodated; but left still the remains of
rancour and jealousy in the breast of the two monarchs.</P>
<P>TANCRED,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1191.</NOTE> who, for his own security, desired to in∣flame
their mutual hatred, practised an artifice, which
might have been attended with consequences still more
fatal. He showed Richard a letter, signed by the French
King, and delivered him, as he pretended, by the duke
of Burgundy; in which that monarch desired Tancred
to fall upon the quarters of the English, and promised to
assist him in putting them to the sword, as common ene∣mies.
The unwary Richard gave credit to the infor∣mation;
but was too candid not to betray his discontent
to Philip, who absolutely denied the letter, and charged
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
the Sicilian prince with forgery and falsehood. Richard
either was, or pretended to be, entirely satisfied<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 688. Bened. Abb. p. 642, 643. Brompton, p. 1195.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEST these jealousies and complaints should multiply
between them, it was proposed, that, by a solemn treaty,
they should cut off the root of all future differences, and
adjust every point which could possibly hereafter become
a controversy between them. But this expedient started
a new dispute, which might have proved more dangerous
than any of the foregoing, and which deeply concerned
the honour of Philip's family. When Richard, in every
treaty with Henry II. insisted so strenuously on being al∣lowed
to marry Alice of France, he had only sought a
pretence for quarrelling; and never meant to take into
his bed a princess suspected of a criminal amour with his
own father. After he became master, he no longer talked
of compleating that alliance: He even took measures for
espousing Berengaria, daughter of Sanchez, King of
Navarre, with whom he had become enamoured during
his abode in Guienne<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Vinisauf, p. 316.</NOTE>: Queen Eleanor was daily ex∣pected
with that princess at Messina<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 112. Trivet, p. 102. W. Heming. p. 519.</NOTE>: And when Philip
renewed to him his applications for espousing his sister
Alice, Richard was obliged to give him an absolute re∣fusal.
It is pretended by Hoveden and other historians<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 688.</NOTE>,
that he was able to produce such convincing proofs of
Alice's infidelity, and even of her having born a child to
Henry, that her brother desisted from his applications,
and chose to wrap up the dishonour of his family in si∣lence
and oblivion. It is certain, from the treaty itself,
which yet remains<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 69. Chron. de Dunst. p. 44.</NOTE>, that, whatever were his motives,
he permitted Richard to give his hand to Berengaria; and
having settled all other controversies with that prince, he
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
immediately set sail for the holy land. Richard awaited
some time the arrival of his mother and bride; and when
they joined him, he separated his fleet into two squadrons,
and set forward on his enterprize. Queen Eleanor re∣turned
to England; but Berengaria, and the Queen-dowager
of Sicily, his sister, attended him on the expe∣dition<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 644.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English fleet, on leaving the port of Messina,
met with a furious tempest; and the squadron, on which
the two princesses were embarked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th April.</NOTE> was drove on the
coast of Cyprus, and some of the vessels were wrecked
near Limisso in that island. Isaac, prince of Cyprus,
who assumed the magnificent title of Emperor, pillaged
the ships that were stranded, threw the seamen and pas∣sengers
into prison, and even refused to the princesses li∣berty,
in their dangerous situation, of entering the har∣bour
of Limisso<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vinisauf, p. 319, 320. W. Heming p. 523.</NOTE>. But Richard, who arrived soon after,
took ample vengeance on him for the injury. He disem∣barked
his troops; defeated the tyrant, who opposed his
landing; entered Limisso by storm; gained next day a
second victory; obliged Isaac to surrender at discretion;
and established governors over the island<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 645. Trivet, p. 103.</NOTE>. The Greek
prince, being thrown into prison and loaded with irons,
complained of the little regard with which he was treated:
Upon which, Richard ordered silver fetters to be made
for him; and this Emperor, pleased with the distinction,
expressed a sense of the generosity of his Conqueror<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Bened Abb. p 650. Ann. Waverl. p. 164. Vinisauf, p. 328. W Heming. p 523.</NOTE>.
The King here espoused Berengaria<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 692. Bened. Abb. p. 650. Knyghton, p. 2404.</NOTE>, who, immediately

believed to have seduced the affections of her husband.
Such were the libertine character and conduct of the he∣roes
engaged in this pious enterprize!</P>
<P>THE English army arrived in time to partake in the
glory of the siege of Acre or Ptolemais,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's arrival in Palestine.</NOTE> which had been
attacked for above two years by the united force of all
the Christians in Palestine, and had been defended by the
utmost efforts of Saladin and the Saracens. The remains
of the German army, conducted by the Emperor Frede∣ric,
and the separate bodies of adventurers who continu∣ally
poured in from the west, had enabled the King of
Jerusalem to form this important enterprize<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Vinisauf, p. 269, 271, 279.</NOTE>: But Sala∣din,
having thrown a strong garrison into the place un∣der
the command of Caracos<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 654.</NOTE>, his own master in the
art of war, and molesting the besiegers with continual
attacks and inroads, had protracted the success of the en∣terprize,
and wasted the force of his enemies. The ar∣rival
of Philip and Richard inspired new life into the
Christians; and these princes, acting by concert, and
sharing the honour and danger of every action, gave
hopes of a final victory over the infidels. They agreed
on this plan of operations: When the French monarch
attacked the town, the English guarded the trenches:
Next day, when the English prince conducted the assault,
the French succeeded him in providing for the safety of
the assailants. The emulation between these rival Kings
and rival nations produced extraordinary acts of valour;
and Richard in particular, animated with a more preci∣pitate
courage than Philip, and more agreeable to the ro∣mantic
spirit of that age, drew to himself the attention
of all the world, and acquired a great and splendid re∣putation.
But this harmony was of very short duration;
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
and occasions of discord soon arose between these jealous
and haughty princes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Pa∣lestine.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE family of Boulogne, which had been first placed
on the throne of Jerusalem, ending in a female, Fulk,
count of Anjou, grandfather to Henry II. of England,
married the heiress of that kingdom, and transmitted his
title to the younger branches of his family. The Anje∣vin
race, ending also in a female, Guy de Lusignan, by
espousing Sibylla, the heiress, had succeeded to the title;
and tho' he lost his kingdom by the invasion of Saladin,
he was still acknowledged by all the Christians for King
of Jerusalem<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Vinisauf, p. 281.</NOTE>. But as Sibylla died without issue, during
the siege of Acre, Isabella, her younger sister, put in her
claim to that titular kingdom, and required Lusignan
to resign his pretensions to her husband Conrade, mar∣quis
of Montserrat. Lusignan, maintaining that the
royal title was unalienable and indefeazable, had recourse
to the protection of Richard, attended on him before he
left Cyprus, and engaged him to embrace his cause<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 104. Vinisauf, p. 342. W. Heming. p. 524.</NOTE>.
There needed no other reason for throwing Philip into
the party of Conrade; and the opposite views of these
great monarchs brought faction and dissension into the
Christian army, and retarded all its operations<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 693. M. Paris, p. 115. W. Heming. p. 524. Knyghton, p. 2405.</NOTE>. The
Templars, the Genoese, and the Germans, declared for
Philip and Conrade; the Flemings, the Pisans, the
knights of the hospital of St. John, adhered to Richard and
Lusignan. But notwithstanding these disputes, as the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ength of the siege had reduced the Saracen garrison to
the last extremity, they surrendered themselves prisoners
of war; stipulated, for the saving their lives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th July.</NOTE> other ad∣vantages
to the Christians<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 695. M. Paris, p. 115.</NOTE>, such as the restoring of pri∣soners,
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
and the delivery of the wood of the true cross<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vinisauf, p. 341.</NOTE>;
and this great enterprize, which had long engaged the
attention of all Europe and Asia, was at last, after the
loss of 300,000 men, brought to a happy period.</P>
<P>BUT Philip, instead of pursuing the hopes of farther
conquest, and redeeming the holy city from slavery, be∣ing
disgusted with the ascendant assumed and acquired by
Richard, and having views of many advantages, which
he might reap by his presence in Europe, declared his re∣solution
of returning into France; and he pleaded his
bad state of health as an excuse for his desertion of the
common cause<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 667. Vinisauf, p. 343. W. Heming. p. 527. Knyghton, p 2405.</NOTE>. He left, however, to Richard ten
thousand of his troops, under the command of the duke
of Burgundy; and he renewed his oath never to com∣mence
hostilities against that prince's dominions during
his absence. But he had no sooner reached Italy than he
applied to Pope Celestine III. for a dispensation from
this vow<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 720. W. Heming. p. 527. Brompton, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>221.</NOTE>; and when denied that request, he still
proceeded, tho' after a more covert manner, in a project,
which the present situation of England rendered so in∣viting,
and which gratified, in so eminent a degree, both
his resentment and his ambition.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after Richard had left England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disorders in England.</NOTE> and
begun his march to the holy land, the two prelates, whom
he had appointed guardians of the realm, broke out into
the fiercest animosities against each other, and threw the
whole kingdom into combustion. Longchamp, presump∣tuous
in his nature, elated by the favour of his master,
and armed with the legatine commission, could not sub∣mit
to an equality with the bishop of Durham; and even
went so far as to arrest the person of his colleague, and
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
to extort from him a resignation of the earldom of
Northumberland, and of his other dignities, as the price
of his liberty<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 665. Knyghton, p. 2403.</NOTE>. The King, informed of these dissen∣sions,
ordered, by letters from Marseilles, that the bi∣shop
should be reinstated in all his offices; but Long∣champ
had still the boldness to refuse compliance, on
pretence that he himself was better acquainted with the
King's secret intentions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 528.</NOTE>. He proceeded still to govern
the kingdom by his sole authority; to treat all the nobi∣lity
with the greatest arrogance; and to display his power
and riches with an invidious ostentation. He never tra∣velled
without a strong guard of fifteen hundred foreign
soldiers, collected from that licentious tribe with which
the age was generally infested<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 702.</NOTE>: Nobles and knights
were proud of being admitted into his train<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 114. W. Heming. p. 528.</NOTE>: His reti∣nue
wore the aspect of royal magnificence: And when,
in his progress thro' the kingdom, he lodged in any mo∣nastery,
his attendants, it is said, were sufficient to de∣vour,
in one night, the revenue of several years<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 680. Bened. Abb. p. 626, 700. Brompton, p. 1193.</NOTE>. The King,
who was detained in Europe longer than the haughty pre∣late
expected, hearing of this ostentation, which exceeded
even what the habits of that age indulged to ecclesiastics;
being also informed of the insolent, tyrannical conduct
of his minister; thought proper to restrain his exorbitant
power; and he sent new orders, appointing Walter arch∣bishop
of Roüen, William Mareshal earl of Strigul,
Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, William Briewere, and Hugh Bar∣dolf,
counsellors to Longchamp, and commanding him to
take no measures of importance without their concur∣rence
and approbation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 687. Bened. Abb. p. 640. Diceto, p. 659. Brompton, p. 1194.</NOTE>. But such general terror had
this man impressed by his violent conduct, that even
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
the archbishop of Roüen and the earl of Strigul durst
not produce this mandate of the King; and Longchamp
still maintained an uncontrouled authority over the na∣tion<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 687.</NOTE>.
But when he proceeded so far as to throw into
person Geoffrey archbishop of York, who had opposed
his measures<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 701. Bened. Abb. p. 697. W. Heming, p. 529.</NOTE>, this breach of ecclesiastical privileges ex∣cited
such an universal ferment, that prince John, dis∣gusted
with the small share he possessed in the government,
and personally disobliged by Longchamp, ventured to
summon at Reading a general council of the nobility
and prelates, and cite him to appear before them. Long∣champ
thought it dangerous to entrust his person in their
hands, and he shut himself up in the tower of London<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 698. M. Paris, p. 117. W. Heming. p. 530. Brompton, p. 1126.</NOTE>:
But being soon obliged to surrender that fortress, he fled
beyond sea, concealed under a female habit, and was
deprived of his offices of chancellor and chief justiciary;
the last of which was conferred on the archbishop of
Roüen, a prelate of great prudence and moderation<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 530.</NOTE>.
The office of legate, however, which had been renewed
to Longchamp by Pope Celestine, still gave him, not∣withstanding
his absence, great authority in the king∣dom,
enabled him to disturb the government, and for∣warded
the views of Philip, who watched every oppor∣tunity
of annoying Richard's dominions. That monarch
first attempted to carry open war into Normandy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1192.</NOTE> but
as the French nobility refused to follow him in an inva∣sion
of a state which they had sworn to protect, and as
the Pope who was the general guardian of all princes that
had taken the cross, threatened him with ecclesiastical
censures, he desisted from his enterprize, and employed
against England the expedient of secret policy and in∣trigue.
He debauched prince John from his allegiance;
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
promised him his sister Alice in marriage; offered to give
him possession of all Richard's. transmarine dominions;
and had not the authority of Queen Eleanor, and the
menaces of the English council, prevailed over the incli∣nations
of that turbulent prince, he was ready to have
crossed the seas, and to have put in execution his crimi∣nal
enterprizes.</P>
<P>THE jealousy of Philip was every moment excited by
the glory which the heroic actions of Richard were gain∣ing
him in the East,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's heroic acti∣ons in Pale∣stine.</NOTE> and which, being compared to his
own desertion of that popular cause, threw a double
lustre on his rival. His envy, therefore, prompted him
to obscure that fame, which he had not equalled; and he
embraced every pretence of throwing the most violent
and most improbable calumnies on the King of England.
There was a petty prince in Asia, commonly called <HI>The
old man of the mountain,</HI> who had acquired such an as∣cendant
over his fanatical subjects, that they paid the most
implicit deference to all his commands; esteemed assassi∣nation
meritorious, when sanctified by his mandate;
courted danger, and even certain death, in the execution
of his orders; and fancied, that where they sacrificed
their lives for his sake, the highest joys of paradise were
the infallible reward of their devoted obedience<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 532. Brompton, p. 1243.</NOTE>. It was
the custom of this prince, when he imagined himself in∣jured,
to dispatch secretly some of his subjects against
the aggressor, to charge them with the execution of his
revenge, to instruct them in every art of disguising their
purpose; and no precaution was sufficient to guard any
man, however powerful, against the attempts of these
subtle and determined ruffians. The greatest monarchs
stood in awe of this prince of the assassins, (for that was
the name of his people; whence the word has been trans∣ferred
into most European languages) and it was the
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
highest indiscretion of Conrade, marquis of Montferret,
to offend and affront him. The inhabitants of Tyre,
who were governed by that nobleman, had put to death
some of this dangerous people: The prince demanded sa∣tisfaction;
for as he piqued himself on never beginning
any offence<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 71.</NOTE>, he had his regular and established formali∣ties
in requiring atonement: Conrade treated his messen∣gers
with disdain: The prince issued his fatal orders:
Two of his subjects, who had insinuated themselves in
disguise among Conrade's guards, openly, in the streets
of Sidon, put him to death; and when they were seized
and condemned to the most cruel tortures, they triumphed
amidst their agonies, and rejoiced that they had been des∣tined
by heaven to suffer in so just and meritorious a cause.</P>
<P>EVERY one in Palestine knew from what hand the blow
came. Richard was entirely free from suspicion. Tho'
that monarch had formerly maintained the cause of Lu∣signan
against Conrade, he had become sensible of the
bad effects attending these dissensions, and had volun∣tarily
conferred on the former the kingdom of Cyprus,
on condition that he should resign to his rival all preten∣sions
to the crown of Jerusalem<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Vinisauf, p. 391.</NOTE>. Conrade himself, with
his dying breath, had recommended his widow to the
protection of Richard<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1243.</NOTE>; the prince of the assassins a∣vowed
the action in a formal narrative which he sent to
Europe<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 71. Trivet, p. 124. W. Heming. p. 544. Diceto, p. 680.</NOTE>; yet, on this foundation, the King of France
thought fit to build the most egregious calumnies, and to
impute to Richard the murder of the marquis of Mont∣ferrat,
whose elevation he had once openly opposed. He
filled all Europe with exclamations against the crime;
appointed a guard to his own person, in order to defend
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
himself against a like attempt<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 532. Brompton, p. 1243.</NOTE>; and endeavoured, by
these shallow artifices, to cover the infamy of attacking
the dominions of a prince, whom he himself had de∣serted,
and who was engaged with so much glory in a
war, universally acknowledged to be the common cause
of Christendom.</P>
<P>BUT Richard's heroic actions in Palestine were the best
apology for his conduct. The christian adventurers un∣der
his command determined, on opening the campaign,
to attempt the siege of Ascalon, in order to prepare the
way for that of Jerusalem; and they marched along the
sea-coast with that intention. Saladin proposed to intercept
their passage; and he placed himself on the road with an
army, amounting to 300,000 combatants. On this oc∣casion
was fought one of the greatest battles of that age;
and the most celebrated, for the military genius of the
commanders, for the number and valour of the troops,
and for the great variety of events which attended it.
Both the right wing of the Christians, commanded by
d'Avesnes, and the left, headed by the duke of Burgun∣dy,
were, in the beginning of the day, broken and de∣feated;
when Richard, who led on the main body, re∣stored
the battle; attacked the enemy with admirable in∣trepidity
and presence of mind; performed the part both
of a consummate general and gallant soldier; and not
only gave his two wings leisure to recover from their
confusion, but obtained a compleat victory over the Sara∣cens,
of whom forty thousand are said to have perished
in the field<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 698. Bened. Abb. p. 677. Diceto, p. 662. Brompton, p. 1214.</NOTE>. Ascalon soon after fell into the hands of
the Christians: Other sieges were carried on with success:
Richard was even able to advance within sight of Jeru∣salem,
the object of all his enterprizes; when he had the
mortification to find, that he must abandon all hopes of
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
immediate success, and must put a stop to his career of vic∣tory.
The crusaders, animated with an enthusiastic ardor for
the holy wars, broke at first thro' all regards to safety or
interest in the prosecution of their purpose; and trusting
to the immediate assistance of heaven, set nothing before
their eyes but fame and victory in this world, and a
crown of glory in the next. But long absence from home,
fatigue, disease, want, and the varieties of success which
naturally attend war, had gradually abated that fury,
which nothing was able directly to withstand; and every
one, except the King of England, expressed a desire of
speedily returning into Europe. The Germans and the
Italians declared their resolution of desisting from the en∣terprize:
The French were still more obstinate in this
purpose: The duke of Burgundy, in order to pay court
to Philip, took all opportunities of mortifying and oppo∣sing
Richard<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Vinisauf, p. 380.</NOTE>: And there appeared an absolute necessity
of abandoning for the present all hopes of farther con∣quest,
and of securing the acquisitions of the Christians
by an accommodation with Saladin. Richard, therefore,
concluded a truce with that monarch; and stipulated,
that Acre, Joppa, and other seaport towns of Palestine,
should remain in the hands of the Christians, and that
every one of that religion should have liberty to perform
his pilgrimage to Jerusalem unmolested<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 123.</NOTE>. This truce was
concluded for three years, three months, three weeks,
three days, and three hours; a magical number, which
had probably been devised by the Europeans, and which
was suggested by a surperstition well suited to the object
of the war.</P>
<P>THE liberty in which Saladin indulged the Christians,
to perform their pilgrimages to Jerusalem, was an easy
sacrifice on his part; and the furious wars, which he
waged in defence of the barren territory of Judea, were
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
not with him, as with the European adventurers, the re∣sult
of superstition, but of policy. The advantage indeed of
science, moderation, humanity, was at that time en∣tirely
on the side of the Saracens; and this gallant Em∣peror,
in particular, displayed, during the course of the
war, a spirit and generosity, which even his bigotted ene∣mies
were obliged to acknowledge and admire. Richards,
equally martial and brave, carried with him more of the
barbarian character; and was guilty of acts of ferocity,
which throw a stain on his celebrated victories. When
Saladin refused to ratify the capitulation of Acre, the
King of England, ordered all his prisoners, to the num∣ber
of five thousand, to be butchered; and the Saracens
found themselves obliged to retaliate upon the Christians
by a like cruelty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 697. Bened. Abb. p. 673. M. Paris, p. 115. Vinisauf, p. 346. W. Homing. p. 531.</NOTE>. Saladin died at Damascus soon after
the conclusion of the truce with the princes of the cru∣sade;
and it is memorable, that, before he expired, he
ordered his winding-sheet to be carried as a standard
thro' every street of the city; while a crier went before,
and proclaimed with a loud voice, <HI>This is all that remains
to the mighty Saladin, the conqueror of the East.</HI> By his last
will, he ordered charities to be distributed to the poor,
without distinction of Jew, Christian, or Mahometan.</P>
<P>THERE remained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's return from Palestine.</NOTE> after the truce, no business of im∣portance
to detain Richard in Palestine; and the intelli∣gence
which he received, of the intrigues of his brother
John, and of the King of France, made him sensible,
that his pretence was necessary in Europe<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1243.</NOTE>. As he
dared not to pass thro' France, he sailed to the Adriatic;
and being shipwrecked near Aquileia, he put on the dis∣guise
of a pilgrim, with a purpose of taking his journey
secretly thro' Germany. Pursued by the governor
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
of Istria<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 70.</NOTE>, he was forced out of the direct road to Eng∣land,
and was obliged to pass by Vienna; where his ex∣pences
and liberalities betrayed the monarch in the habit
of the pilgrim;<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th De∣cember.</NOTE> and he was arrested by orders of Leo∣pold,
duke of Austria<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 717. M. Paris, p. 121. Trivet, p. 124. Knyghton, p. 2407.</NOTE>. This prince had served under
Richard at the siege of Acre; but being disgusted by
some insult of this haughty monarch, he was so ungene∣rous
as to seize the present opportunity of gratifying at
once his avarice and revenge;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1193.</NOTE> and he threw the King
into prison<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 118. W. Heming. p. 535. Brompton, p. 1250.</NOTE>. The Emperor, Henry VI. who also con∣sidered
Richard as an enemy, on account of the alliance
contracted by him with Tancred, King of Sicily, dis∣patched
messengers to the duke of Austria, required the
royal prisoner to be delivered to him, and stipulated a
large sum of money as a reward for this service<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. West. P. 258.</NOTE>. Thus,
the King of England, who had filled the whole world
with his renown and glory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captivity in Germany.</NOTE> found himself, during the
most critical state of his affairs, confined to a dungeon,
and loaded with irons, in the heart of Germany<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 35.</NOTE>, and
entirely at the mercy of his enemies, the basest and most
sordid of mankind.</P>
<P>THE English council were astonished on receiving this
fatal intelligence; and foresaw all the dangerous conse∣quences,
which might naturally arise from that event.
The Queen-dowager wrote reiterated letters to Pope Ce∣lestine;
exclaiming against the injury which her son had sustained,
representing the impiety of detaining in prison
the most illustrious prince who had yet carried the ban∣ners
of Christ into the holy land; claiming the protec∣tion
of the apostolic see, which was due even to the
meanest of these adventurers; and upbraiding the Pope,
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
that in a cause where justice, religion, and the dignity
of the church, were so much concerned; a cause, which
it might well befit his Holiness himfelf to support by tak∣ing

<P>THE King of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> quickly informed of Richard's
confinement by a message from the Emperor<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 70.</NOTE>, prepared
himfelf to take advantage of that incident; and he em∣ployed
every means of force and intrigue, of war and
negotiation, against the dominions and the person of his
unfortunate rival. He revived the calumny of Richard's
assassinating the marquis of Montferrat; and by that ab∣surd
pretence, he induced his barons to violate their oaths,
by which they had engaged, that, during the crusade,
they never would, on any account, attack the dominions
of the King of England<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 717. Brompton, p. 1244.</NOTE>. He made the Emperor the
largest offers, if he would deliver into his hands the royal
prisoner, or at least detain him in perpetual captivity;
and he even formed an alliance by marriage with the
King of Denmark, desired that the antient Danish claim
to the crown of England should be transferred to him, and
solicited a supply of shipping to maintain it<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 731. W. Heming. p. 533. Brompton, p. 1244. Knyghton, p. 2406.</NOTE>. But the
most successful of Philip's negotiations was with prince
John, who, forgetting every tye to his brother, his sove∣reign,
and his benefactor, thought of nothing but how
to make his own advantage of the public calamities.
That traitor, on the first invitation from the court of
France, suddently went abroad, held a conference with

Philip, and made a treaty, of which the object was the
perpetual ruin of his unhappy brother<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 724. W. Heming. p. 536.</NOTE>. He stipulated
to deliver into Philip's hands a great part of Normandy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 85.</NOTE>;
and in return, he received the investiture of all Richard's
transmarine dominions; and it is reported by several his∣torians,
that he even did homage to the French King
for the crown of England.</P>
<P>IN consequence of this treaty, Philip invaded Nor∣mandy;
and by the treachery of John's emissaries, made
himself master, without opposition, of many fortresses,
Neuf-chatel, Neaufle, Gisors, Pacey, Ivreé<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 537.</NOTE>: He sub∣dued
the counties of Eu and Aumale; and advancing to
form the siege of Roüen, he threatened to put all the inha∣bitants
to the sword, if they dared to make the least re∣sistance
to his arms. Happily, Robert earl of Leicester
appeared in that critical moment; a gallant nobleman,
who had acquired great honour, during the crusade, and
who being more fortunate than his master in finding his
passage homewards, took on him the command in Roüen,
and exerted himself, by his presence and example, to in∣fuse
courage into the dismayed Normans<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 724. M. Paris, p. 122.</NOTE>. Philip was
repulsed in every attack; the time of his vassals' service
expired; and he consented to a truce with the English
regency, received in return the promise of 20,000 marks,
and had four castles put into his hands, as security for
the payment<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 730, 731. Rymer, vol. i. p. 81.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRINCE John, who, with a view of increasing the ge∣neral
confusion, went over to England, was less success∣ful
in his enterprizes. He was only able to make him∣self
master of the castles of Windsor and Wallingford;
but when he arrived in London, and claimed the king∣dom
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
as heir to his brother, of whose death he pretended
to have received certain intelligence, he was rejected by
all the barons, and measures were taken to oppose and
subdue him<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 724.</NOTE>. The justiciaries, supported by the gene∣ral
affections of the people, provided so well for the de∣fence
of the kingdom, that John was obliged, after
some fruitless efforts, to conclude a truce with them; and
before its expiration, he thought it prudent to return into
France, and he openly acknowledged his alliance with
Philip<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 536,</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN while, the high spirit of Richard suffered in
Germany every kind of insult and indignity. The
French ambassadors, in their master's name, renounced
him as a vassal to the crown of France, and declared all
his fiefs to be forfeited to his liege-lord. The Emperor,
that he might render him more impatient for the reco∣very
of his liberty, and make him submit to the pay∣ment
of a larger ransom, treated him with the greatest
severity, and reduced him to a condition worse than that
of the meanest malefactor. He was even produced be∣fore
the diet of the empire at Worms, and accused by
Henry of many crimes and misdemeanors; of making an
alliance with Tancred, the usurper of Sicily; of turn∣ing
the arms of the crusade against a Christian prince,
and subduing Cyprus; of affronting the duke of Austria
before Acre; of obstructing the progress of the Christian
arms by his quarrels wiih the King of France; of as∣sassinating
Conrade, marquis of Montferrat; and of con∣cluding
a truce with Saladin, and leaving Jerusalem in
the hands of the Saracen Emperor<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 121. W. Heming. p. 536.</NOTE>. Richard, whose
spirit was not broke by all his misfortunes, and whose
genius was rather rouzed by these frivolous or scandalous
imputations; after premising, that his royal dignity ex∣empted
him from answering before any jurisdiction, ex∣cept
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
that of heaven; yet condescended, for the sake of
his reputation, to justify his conduct before that great as∣sembly.
He observed, that he had no hand in Tancred's
elevation, and only concluded a treaty with a prince,
whom he found in possession of the throne: That the
King, or rather tyrant of Cyprus, had provoked his in∣dignation
by the most ungenerous and unjust proceedings;
and tho' he chastised this aggressor, he had not retarded
a moment the progress of his chief enterprize: That if
he had been at any time wanting in civility to the duke
of Austria, he had already been punished sufficiently for
that sally of passion; and it better became men, em∣barked
together in so holy a cause, to forgive each other's
infirmities, than to pursue a slight offence with such un∣relenting
vengeance: That it had sufficiently appeared by
the event, whether the King of France or he was most
zealous for the conquest of the holy land, and was most
likely to sacrifice private passions and animosities to that
great object: That if the whole tenor of his life had
not shown him incapable of a base assassination, and jus∣tified
him from that imputation in the eyes of his very
enemies, it was in vain for him, at present, to make his
apology, or plead the many irrefragable arguments, which
he could produce in his own favour: And that, however
he might regret the necessity, he was so far from being
ashamed of his truce with Saladin, that he rather gloried
in that event; and thought it extremely honourable, that,
tho' abandoned by all the world, supported only by his
own courage and by the small remains of his national
troops, he could yet obtain such conditions from the
most powerful and most warlike Emperor that the East
had ever yet produced. Richard, after thus deigning to
apologize for his conduct, burst out into indignation at
the cruel treatment which he had met with; that he,
the champion of the cross, still wearing that honourable
badge, should, after expending the blood and treasure of
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
his subjects in the common cause of Christendom, be in∣tercepted
by Christian princes in his return to his own
country, be thrown into a dungeon, be loaded with
irons, be obliged to plead his cause, as if he were a sub∣ject
and a malefactor; and what he still more regretted,
be thereby prevented from making his preparations for a
new crusade, which he projected, after the expiration of
the truce, and from redeeming the sepulchre of Christ,
which had so long been profaned by the dominion of the
infidels. The spirit and eloquence of Richard made
such impression on the German princes, that they ex∣claimed
loudly against the conduct of the Emperor; the
Pope threatened him with excommunication; and Henry,
who had hearkened to the proposals of the King of France
and prince John, found that it would be impracticable
for him to execute his and their base purposes, and detain
the King of England any longer in captivity. He there∣fore
concluded with him a treaty for his ransom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's delivery.</NOTE> and a∣greed
to restore him to his freedom for the sum of 150,000
marks, about 300,000 pounds of our present money; of
which 100,000 marks was to be paid before he received
his liberty, and sixty-seven hostages delivered for the re∣mainder<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 728. M. Paris, p. 122. Diceto, p. 670. Rymer, vol. i. p. 84.</NOTE>.
The Emperor, as if to gloss over the infa∣my
of this transaction, made at the same time a present
to Richard of the kingdom of Arles, comprehending Pro∣vence,
Dauphiny, Narbonne, and other states, over
which the empire had some antiquated claims, that the
King very wisely neglected<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 732.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE captivity of the superior lord was one of the cases
provided for by the feudal tenures; and all the vassals
were in that event obliged to give an aid for his ransom.
Twenty shillings were therefore levied on each knight's fee
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
in England<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 726, 731.</NOTE>; but as this money came in slowly, and
was not sufficient for the intended purpose, the volun∣tary
zeal of the people readily supplied the defect<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 122. Ann. Waverl. p. 164. W. Heming. p. 538.</NOTE>.
The churches and monasteries melted down their plate,
to the amount of 30,000 marks; the bishops, abbots,
and nobles, paid a fourth of their yearly rent; the pa∣rochial
clergy contributed a tenth of their tythes: And
the requisite sum being thus collected, Queen Eleanor,
and Walter archbishop of Roüen, set out with it for
Germany;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1194.</NOTE> paid the money to the Emperor and the duke
of Austria at Mentz;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Feb.</NOTE> delivered them hostages for the
remainder; and freed Richard from his captivity. His
escape was very critical. Henry had been detected in the
assassination of the bishop of Liege, and in an attempt
of a like nature on the duke of Louvaine; and finding
himself extremely obnoxious to the German princes on
account of these odious practices, he had determined to
seek support from an alliance with the French King<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 727. Neubrig. W. Heming. p. 539.</NOTE>;
to detain Richard, the enemy of that prince, in perpe∣tual
captivity; to keep in his hands the money which he
had already received for his ransom; and to extort new
sums from Philip and Prince John, who were very liberal
in their offers to him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 733.</NOTE>. He therefore gave orders that
Richard should be pursued and arrested; but the King
making all imaginable haste, had already embarked at
the mouth of the Schelde, and was out of sight of land
when the messengers of the Emperor reached Ant∣werp.</P>
<P>THE joy of the English was extreme on the appear∣ance
of their monarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's re∣turn to Eng∣land. 20th March.</NOTE> who had suffered so many cala∣mities,
who had acquired so much glory, and who had
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
spread the reputation of their name into the farthest East,
whither their same had never before been able to extend<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 539.</NOTE>.
He gave them, soon after his arrival, an opportunity of
displaying publicly their exultation, by ordering himself
to be crowned anew at Winchester; as if he intended,
by that ceremony, to reinstate himself in his throne, and
to wipe off the ignominy of his captivity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 738. M. Paris, p. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Their satis∣faction
was not even damped, when he declared his pur∣pose
of making a general resumption of those exorbitant
grants, which he had been necessitated to agree to before
his departure for the holy land. The barons also, in a
great council, forfeited, on account of his treason, all
prince John's possessions in England; and they assisted
the King in reducing the fortresses which still remained
in the hands of his brother's adherents<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 737. Ann. Waverl. p. 165. W. Heming. p. 540.</NOTE>: And Richard,
having settled every thing in England, passed over with
an army into Normandy; being impatient to make war
on Philip, and to revenge hims<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf for the many injuries
which he had received from that monarch<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 740.</NOTE>. So soon as
Philip heard of the King's delivery from captivity, he
wrote to his confederate, John, in these terms: <HI>Take
care of yourself: The devil is broke loose</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 739.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider two such powerful and martial
monarchs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> inflamed with personal animosity to each other,
enraged by mutual injuries, excited by rivalship, im∣pelled
by opposite interests, and instigated by the pride
and violence of their own temper; our curiosity is natu∣rally
raised, and we expect an obstinate and furious
war, distinguished by the greatest events, and concluded
by some remarkable catastrophe. Yet are the incidents
which attended these hostilities so frivolous, that scarce any
historian can entertain such a passion for military descrip∣tions
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
as to venture on a detail of them: A certain proof of
the extreme weakenss of princes in those ages, and of
the little authority they possessed over their refractory
vassals! The whole amount of the exploits on both sides
is, the taking a castle, the surprise of a straggling party,
a rencounter of horse, which resembles more a rout
than a battle. Richard obliged Philip to raise the siege
of Verneüil; he took Loches, a small town in Anjou;
he made himself master of Beaumont, and some other
places of little consequence; and after these trivial ex∣ploits,
the two Kings began already to hold conferences
for an accommodation. Philip insisted, that, if a gene∣ral
peace was concluded, the barons on each side should
be prohibited from carrying on private wars against each
other: But Richard replied, that this was a right claimed
by his vassals, and he could not debar them of it<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 741.</NOTE>. Af∣ter
this fruitless negotiation, there ensued an action be∣tween
the French and English cavalry at Fretteval, in
which the former were routed, and the King of France's
cartulary and records, which commonly at that time at∣tended
his person, were taken<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Philip had his revenge
for this defeat, by an advantage which he obtained before
Vaudreüil: And a truce for a year was at last, from mu∣tual
weakenss, concluded between the two monarchs<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Heming p. 541.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING this war, prince John deserted Philip, threw
himself at his brother's feet, craved pardon for his offen∣ces,
and by the intercession of Queen Eleanor, was re∣ceived
into favour<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 122. W. Heming. P. 542.</NOTE>. <HI>I forgive him,</HI> said the King, <HI>and
hope I shall as easily forget hit injuries, as he will my pardon.</HI>
John was incapable even of returning to his duty, with∣out
committing a baseness. Before he left Philip's party,
he invited to dinner all the officers of the garrison, which
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
that prince had placed in the citadel of Evreux; he treacherously massacred them during the entertainment;
fell, with the assistance of the townsmen, on the garri∣son,
whom he put to the sword; and then delivered up
the place to his brother<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Phillipid. lib. 4. p. 143. Rigord, p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of France was the great object of Richard's
resentment and animosity: The conduct of his brother
John, as well as of the Emperor and duke of Austria,
had been so base and mean, and was exposed to such ge∣neral
odium and reproach, that the King deemed him∣self
sufficiently revenged for their injuries; and as it is
impossible to hate heartily a person whom one despises,
he seems never to have entertained any project of ven∣geance
against any of them. The duke of Austria,
about this time, having crushed his leg by the fall of
his horse at a tournament, was thrown into a fever; and
being struck, on the approaches of death, with remorse
for his injustice to Richard, he ordered, by will, all the
English hostages to be set at liberty, and the remainder of
the debt to be remitted<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 125. W. Heming. p. 542. Diceto, p. 678.</NOTE>: His son, who seemed inclined
to disobey these orders, was constrained by his ec∣clesiastics
to execute them<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 88. 102.</NOTE>. The Emperor also made
advances for Richard's friendship, and offered to give
him a discharge of all his debt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1195.</NOTE> provided he would enter
into an offensive alliance against the King of France;
a proposal which was very acceptable to Richard, and
was greedily embraced by him. The treaty with the
Emperor took no effect; but it served to rekindle the
war between France and England before the expiration
of the truce. This war was not distinguished by any
more remarkable incident than the former. After mutu∣ally
ravaging the open country, and taking a few insig∣nificant
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
castles, the two Kings concluded a peace at
Louviers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1196.</NOTE> and yielded up some territories to each other<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 91.</NOTE>.
Their inability to make war occasioned the peace:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1196.</NOTE> Their
mutual antipathy engaged them again in war before two
months expired. Richard imagined, that he had now
got an opportunity of striking a severe blow on his rival,
by forming an alliance with the counts of Flanders,
Tholouse, Boulogne, Champagne, and other considera∣ble
vassals of the crown of France<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 549. Brompton, p. 1273. Rymer, vol. i. p. 94.</NOTE>. But he soon ex∣perienced
the insincerity of these princes; and was not
able to make any impression on that kingdom, while go∣verned
by a prince of so much vigour and activity as Phi∣lip.
The most remarkable incident of this war was the
taking prisoner in battle the bishop of Beauvais, a mar∣tial
prelate, who was of the family of Dreux, and a
near relation of the French King. Richard, who hated
that bishop, threw him into prison, and loaded him with
irons; and when the Pope demanded his liberty, and
claimed him as his son, the King sent his Holiness the
coat of mail which the prelate had worn in battle, and
which was all besmeared with blood. And he replied to
him, in the terms employed by Jacob's sons to that patriarch,
<HI>This have we found: Know now whether it be thy
son's coat or no</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Genes. chap. xxxvii. verse 32. M. Paris, p. 128. Brompton, p. 1273.</NOTE>. This war between England and France,
tho' carried on with such animosity, that both Kings fre∣quently
put out the eyes of their prisoners, was soon
finished, by a truce of five years; and immediately after
signing this treaty, the Kings were ready, on some new
offence, to break out again into hostilities; when the
mediation of the cardinal of St. Mary, the Pope's legate,
accommodated the difference<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 109, 110.</NOTE>. This prelate even en∣gaged
the princes to commence a treaty for a more dur∣able
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
peace; but the death of Richard put an end to the negotiation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1199.</NOTE></P>
<P>VIDOMAR,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1199.</NOTE> viscount of Limoges, a vassal of the King,
had found a treasure, of which he sent a part to that
prince as a prefent. Richard, as superior lord, claimed
the whole; and at the head of some Brabançons, be∣sieged
the viscount in the castle of Chalus, near Limo∣ges,
in order to make him comply with his demand<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 791. Knyghton, p. 2413.</NOTE>.
The garrison offered to surrender; but the King replied,
that, since he had taken the pains to come thither and be∣siege
the place in person, he would take it by force, and
would hang every one of them. The same day, Richard,
accompanied by Marcadée, leader of his Brabançons,
approached the castle in order to survey it; when one
Bertrand de Gourdon, an archer, took an aim at him,
and pierced his shoulder with an arrow. The King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th March.</NOTE>
however, gave orders for the assault, took the place, and
hanged all the garrison, except Gourdon, who had
wounded him, and whom he reserved for a more delibe∣rate
and more cruel execution<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE wound was not in itself dangerous; but the un∣skilfulness
of the surgeon made it mortal: He so rankled
Richard's shoulder in pulling out the arrow, that a
gangrene commenced; and that prince was now sensible
that his life was drawing towards a period. He sent for
Gourdon, and asked him, <HI>Wretch, what have I ever
done to you, to oblige you to seek my life?—What have you done
to me?</HI> replied coolly the prisoner: <HI>You killed with your
own hands my father, and my two brother; and you intended
to have hanged myself: I am now in your power, and you may
take revenge, by inflicting on me the most severe torments: But
I shall endure them all with pleasure, provided I can think that
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
with my own hands I have rid the world of such a nuisance</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 791. Brompton, p. 1277. Knyghton, p. 2413.</NOTE>.
Richard, struck with the reasonableness of this reply,
and humbled by the near approach of death, ordered
Gourdon to be set at liberty, and a sum of money to be
given him; but Marcadée, unknown to him, seized the
unhappy man, flead him alive, and then hanged him.
Richard died in the tenth year of his reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th April. Death</NOTE> and the forty-second
of his age; and he left no issue behind him.</P>
<P>THE most shining part of this prince's character was
his military talents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac∣ter of the King.</NOTE> No man, even in that romantic age,
carried personal courage and intrepidity to a greater
height; and this quality gained him the appellation of
the lion-hearted, <HI>coeur de lion.</HI> He passionately loved
glory, chiefly military glory; and as his conduct in the
field was not inferior to his valour, he seems to have
possessed every talent necessary for acquiring it. His re∣sentments
also were high; his pride unconquerable; and
his subjects, as well as his neighbours, had therefore reason
to apprehend, from the continuance of his reign, a perpe∣tual
scene of blood and violence. Of an impetuous and
vehement spirit, he was distinguished by all the good,
as well as the bad qualities, which are incident to that
character: He was open, frank, generous, sincere, and
brave; he was revengeful, domineering, ambitious,
haughty, and cruel; and was thus better calculated to
dazzle men by the splendor of his enterprizes, than ei∣ther
to promote their happiness or his own grandeur, by
a sound and well regulated policy. As military talents
make great impression on the people, he seems to have
been much beloved by his English subjects: and
he is remarked to have been the first prince of the
Norman line who bore a sincere affection and re∣gard
to them. He passed however only four months of
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
his reign in that kingdom: The crusade employed him
near three years; he was detained about fourteen months
in captivity; the rest of his reign was spent either in
war, or preparations for war, against France; and he
was so pleased with the fame which he had acquired in
the East, that he seems to have determined, notwith∣standing
all his past misfortunes, to have farther ex∣hausted
his kingdom, and to have exposed himself to new
hazards, by conducting another expedition against the
infidels.</P>
<P>THO' the English pleased themselves with the glory
which the King's martial talents procured them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscellane∣ous transac∣tions of this reign.</NOTE> his
reign was very oppressive, and somewhat arbitrary, by
the high taxes which he levied on them, and often with∣out
the consent of the states or great council. In the
ninth of his reign, he levied five shillings on each hyde
of land; and because the clergy refused to contribute
their share, he put them out of the protection of law,
and ordered the civil courts to give them no sentence for
any debts which they might claim<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 743. Tyrrel, vol. 2. p. 563.</NOTE>. Twice in his
reign he ordered all his charters to be sealed anew, and
the parties to pay fees for the renewal<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Prynne's Chronol. Vindic. tom. i. p. 1133.</NOTE>. It is said that
Hubert, his justiciary, sent him over to France, in the
space of two years, no less a sum than 1,100,000 marks,
besides bearing all the charges of the government in
England. But this account is quite incredible, unless
we suppose that he made an extreme dilapidation of the
demesnes of the crown. A King who possessed such a
revenue could never have endured fourteen months cap∣tivity,
for not paying 150,000 marks to the Emperor,
and be obliged at last to leave hostages for a third of the
sum. The prices of commodities in this reign are also
a certain proof, that no such enormous sum could be le∣vied
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
from the people. A hyde of land, or a hundred and
twenty acres, was commonly let for twenty shillings a-year,
money of that time. The general and stated price
of an ox was four shillings; of a labouring horse, the
same; of a sow, one shilling; of a sheep with fine wool,
ten pence; with coarse wool, six pence<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 745.</NOTE>. These commo∣dities
seem not to have advanced in their prices since the
time of the Conquest.</P>
<P>RICHARD renewed the severe laws against transgressors

An useful institution, which
the mercenary disposition and necessities of his successor
engaged him to dispense with for money.</P>
<P>THE disorders in London, derived from its bad police,
had risen to a great height during this reign; and in the
year 1196, there seemed to be formed a regular conspi∣racy
of the malefactors, which threatened the city with
destruction. There was one William Fitz-Osbert, com∣monly
called <HI>Longbeard,</HI> a lawyer, who had rendered
himself extremely popular among the lower rank of citi∣zens;
and by defending them on all occasions, had ac∣quired
the appellation of the advocate or saviour of the
poor. He exerted his authority, by injuring and insult∣ing
the more substantial inhabitants, with whom he lived
in a state of hostility, and who were every moment ex∣posed
to the most outragious violences from him and his
licentious emissaries. Murders were daily committed in
the streets; houses were broke open and pillaged in day-light;
and it is pretended, that no less than fifty-two
thousand persons had signed an association, by which
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
they bound themselves to obey all the orders of this dan∣gerous
ruffian. Archbishop Hubert, who was then chief
justiciary, summoned him before the council to answer
for his conduct; but he came so well attended, that no
one durst accuse him, or bear evidence against him; and
the primate, finding the impotence of laws, contented
himself with exacting from the citizens hostages for their
good behaviour. He kept, however, a watchful eye on
William; and seizing a favourable opportunity, at∣tempted
to commit him to custody; but the criminal,
murdering one of the public officers, escaped with his
concubine to the church of St. Mary le Bow, where he
defended himself by force of arms. He was at last forced
from his retreat, condemned, and executed, amidst the
infinite regrets of the populace, who were so devoted to
his memory, that they stole his gibbet, paid it the same
veneration as to the cross, and were equally zealous in
propagating and attesting reports of the miracles which were
wrought by it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 765. Diceto, p. 691. Neubrig. p. 492, 493.</NOTE>. But tho' the sectaries of this su∣perstition
were punished by the justiciary<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gervase, p. 1591.</NOTE>, it received so
little encouragement from the established clergy, whose
property was endangered by such seditious practices, that
it suddenly sunk and vanished.</P>

made the government of a single person be always
regarded by them as a species of tyranny and usurpation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1199.</NOTE>
and kept them from forming any conception of a legal
and regular monarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accession of the King.</NOTE> had rendered them entirely igno∣rant
both of the rights of <HI>primogeniture</HI> and a <HI>representa∣tion</HI>
in succession; inventions so necessary to preserve or∣der
in the lines of princes, to obviate the evils of civil
discord and of usurpation, and to beget moderation in that
species of government, by giving security to the ruling
sovereign. These innovations arose from the feudal law;
which, first introducing the right of primogeniture, made
such a distinction between the families of the elder and
younger brothers, that the son of the former was thought
intitled to succeed to his grandfather, preferably to his
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
uncles, tho' nearer allied to the deceased monarch. But
tho' this progress of ideas was natural, it was gradual.
In the age of which we treat, the practice of representa∣tion
was indeed introduced, but not thoroughly esta∣blished;
and the minds of men floated between opposite
principles. Richard, when he entered on the holy war,
declared his nephew, Arthur duke of Brittany, his suc∣cessor;
and by a formal deed, he set aside, in his favour,
the title of his brother John, who was younger than
Geoffrey, the father of that prince<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 677. M. Paris, p. 112. Chron. de Dunst. p. 43. Rymer, vol. i. p. 66, 68. Bened. Abb. p. 619.</NOTE>. But John so lit∣tle
acquiesced in this destination, that when he gained
the ascendant in the English ministry, by expelling
Longchamp, the chancellor and great justiciary, he en∣gaged
all the English barons to swear, that they would
maintain his right of succession; and Richard, on his
return, took no steps towards restoring or securing the order
which he had at first established. He was even
careful, by his last will, to declare his brother John heir
to all his dominions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 791. Trivet, p. 138.</NOTE>; whether, that he now thought
Arthur, who was only twelve years of age, incapable of
asserting his claim against John's faction, or was influ∣enced
by Eleanor, the Queen-mother, who hated Con∣stantia,
mother, to the young duke, and who dreaded
the influence which that princess would naturally acquire
during the reign of her son. The authority of a testa∣ment
was great in that age, even where the succession
of a kingdom was concerned; and John had reason to
hope, that this title, joined to his plausible right in other
respects, would ensure him the succession. But the idea
of representation seems to have made, at this time, greater
progress in France than in England; and the barons of
the transmarine provinces, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine,
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
immediately declared in favour of Arthur's succession<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 792. M. Paris, p. 137. Matth. West. p. 263. Knyghton, p. 2414.</NOTE>,
and applied for the assistance of the French monarch as
their superior lord. Philip, who desired only an occa∣sion
to embarass John, and dismember his dominions,
embraced the cause of the young duke of Brittany, took
him under his protection, and sent him to Paris to be
educated, along with his son Lewis<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. In this emer∣gence,
John hastened to establish his authority in the
chief members of the monarchy; and after sending Ele∣anor
into Poictou and Guienne, where her right was in∣contestible,
and was readily acknowledged, he hurried to
Roüen, and being there invested in the dutchy of Nor∣mandy,
he passed over without loss of time into Eng∣land.
Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, William
Mareschal, earl of Strigul, soon after created earl of
Pembroke, and Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the justiciary, the
three most favoured ministers of the late King, were
already engaged on his side<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 793. M. Paris, p. 137.</NOTE>; and the submission or ac∣quiescence
of all the other barons put him, without op∣position,
in possession of the throne.</P>
<P>THE King soon returned to France, in order to con∣duct
the war against Philip, and to recover the revolted
provinces from his nephew, Arthur. The alliances
which Richard had formed with the earl of Flanders<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 114. Hoveden, p. 794. M. Paris, p. 138.</NOTE>,
and other potent French barons, tho' they had not been
very effectual, still subsisted, and enabled John to defend
himself against all the efforts of his enemy. In an ac∣tion
between the French and Flemings, the elect bishop
of Cambray was taken prisoner by the former; and when
the cardinal of Capua claimed his liberty, Philip, instead
of complying, reproached him with the weak efforts
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
which he had employed in favour of the bishop of Beau∣vais,
who was in a like condition. The legate, to show
his impartiality, laid at the same time the kingdom of
France and the dutchy of Normandy under an interdict;
and the two Kings found themselves obliged to make an
exchange of these military prelates.</P>
<P>NOTHING enabled the King to bring this war to a
happy issue so much as the selfish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1200.</NOTE> intriguing character
of Philip, who acted, in the provinces that had declared
for Arthur, without any regard to the interests of that
prince; and inspired Constantia with a violent jealousy,
that he intended to usurp the entire dominion of them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 795.</NOTE>.
She therefore found means to carry off her son secretly
from Paris; she put him into the hands of his uncle;
restored the provinces which had adhered to him; and
made him do homage for the dutchy of Brittany, which
was usually regarded as a rere-fief of Normandy. From
this incident, Philip saw, that he could not hope to
make any progress against John; and being threatened
with an interdict on account of his irregular divorce
from Ingelburga, the Danish princess, whom he had es∣poused,
he became very desirous of concluding a peace
with England. After some fruitless conferences, the
terms were at last adjusted; and the two monarchs seem∣ed
in this treaty to have an intention, besides ending
the present quarrel, of preventing all future causes of
discord, and of obviating every controversy which could
hereafter arise between them. They adjusted the limits
of all their territories; mutually secured the interests of
their vassals; and to render the union more durable,
John bestowed his niece, Blanche of Castile, in marriage
to prince Lewis, Philip's eldest son, and gave with her
the baronies of Issoudun and Graçai, and other fiefs
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
in Berri. Nine barons of the King of England, and as
many of the King of France, were guarantees of this
treaty; and all of them swore, that, if their sovereign
violated any article of it, they would declare themselves
against him, and embrace the cause of the injured mo∣narch<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Norman. Duchesnii, p. 1055. Rymer, vol. i. p. 117, 118, 119. Hoveden, p. 814. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JOHN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's marriage.</NOTE> now secure, as he imagined, on the side of
France, indulged his passion towards Isabella, the daugh∣ter
and heir of Aymar Taillefer, count of Angouleme, a
lady with whom he had become much enamoured. His
Queen, the heiress of the family of Glocester, was still
alive: Isabella was married to the count de la Marche,
and was already delivered into the hands of that noble∣man;
tho', by reason of her tender years, the marriage
was not yet consummated. The passion of John made
him overlook all these obstacles: He persuaded the count
of Angouleme to carry off his daughter from her hus∣band;
and having, on some pretence or other, procured
a divorce from his own wife, he espoused Isabella<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 803. M. Paris, p. 140. Trivet, p. 140. Ann. Waverl. p. 166. Ypod Neust. p. 458. Ann. Murgan, p. 12. M. West. p. 263.</NOTE>, re∣gardless
both of the menaces of the Pope, who exclaimed
against these irregular proceedings, and of the resentment
of the injured count, who soon found means to punish
his powerful and insolent rival.</P>
<P>JOHN had not the art of attaching his barons either
by affection or by fear.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1201.</NOTE> The count de la Marche, and
his brother the count d'Eu, taking advantage of the ge∣neral
discontent against him, excited commotions in Poic∣tou
and Normandy; and obliged the King to have re∣course
to arms, in order to suppress the insurrection of
his vassals. He summoned together the barons of Eng∣land,
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
and required them to pass the seas under his
standard, and to quell the rebels: He found that he pos∣sessed
as little authority in that kingdom as in his transma∣rine
provinces. The English barons unanimously repli∣ed,
that they would not attend him on this expedition, un∣less
he would promise to restore and preserve their privi∣leges.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annal. Burton, p. 262.</NOTE>:
The first symptom of a regular association and
plan of liberty among these noblemen! But affairs were
not yet fully ripe for the revolution projected. John, by
menacing the barons, broke the concert; and both en∣gaged
many of them to follow him into Normandy, and
obliged the rest, who staid behind, to pay him a scutage
of two marks on each knight's fee, as the price of their
exemption from the service.</P>
<P>THE force which John carried abroad with him, and
that which joined him in Normandy, rendered him much
superior to his malecontent barons; and so much the
more, as Philip gave them not publicly any countenance,
and seemed as yet determined to persevere steadily in the
union which he had formed with England. But the
King, elated with his superiority, advanced claims,
which gave an universal alarm to his vassals, and dif∣fused
still wider the general discontent. As the juris∣prudence
of that time required, that the causes in the
lord's court should chiefly be decided by duel, he carried
along with him certain bravos, whom he retained as
champions, and whom he destined to fight with his ba∣rons,
in order to determine any controversy which he
might raise against them<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Annal. Burt. p. 262.</NOTE>. The count de la Marche,
and the other noblemen, regarded this proceeding as an
affront, as well as an injury; and declared, that they
would never draw their swords against men of such infe∣rior
quality. The King menaced them with vengeance;
but he had not vigour to employ against them the force in
<PB N="46" REF="55"/>
his hands, or to prosecute the injustice, by crushing in∣tirely
the nobles who opposed it.</P>
<P>THIS government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> equally feeble and violent, gave
courage as well as inclination to the injured barons to
carry farther their opposition: They appealed to the King
of France; complained of the denial of justice in John's
courts; demanded redress from him as their superior lord;
and entreated him to employ his authority, and prevent
their final ruin and oppression. Philip perceived his ad∣vantage,
opened his mind to great projects, interposed in
behalf of the French barons, and began to talk in a high
and menacing style to the King of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1202.</NOTE> John,
who could not disavow Philip's authority, replied, that
it belonged to him first to grant them a trial by their
peers in his own court; it was not till he failed in this
duty, that he was answerable to his peers in the supreme
court of the French King<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Philipp. lib. 6.</NOTE>; and he promised, by a fair
and equitable judicature, to give satisfaction to his barons.
When the nobles, in consequence of this engagement,
demanded a safe-conduct, that they might attend his court,
he first refused it: Upon the renewal of Philip's mena∣ces,
he promised to grant their demand; he violated this
promise; fresh menaces extorted from him a promise to
surrender to Philip the fortresses of Tillieres and Bouta∣vant,
as a security for performance; he violated again
this engagement; his enemies, sensible both of his weak∣ness
and want of faith, combined still closer in the reso∣lution
of pushing him to extremities; and a new and
powerful ally soon appeared to encourage them in their
invasion of this odious and despicable government.</P>
<P>THE young duke of Brittany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1203.</NOTE> who was now rising
to man's estate, sensible of the dangerous character of
his uncle, determined to seek both his security and ad∣vancement
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
by an union with Philip and the malecontent
barons. He joined the French army, which had begun
hostilities against the King of England: He was received
with great marks of distinction by Philip; was knighted
by him; espoused his daughter Mary; and was invested
not only in the dutchy of Brittany, but in the counties
of Anjou and Maine, which he had formerly resigned to
his uncle<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 142.</NOTE>. Every attempt succeeded with the allies.
Tillieres and Boutavant were taken by Philip, after
making a feeble defence: Mortimar and Lyons fell into
his hands almost without resistance. That prince next
invested Gournai; and opening the sluices of a lake,
which lay in the neighbourhood, poured such a torrent
of water into the place, that the garrison deserted it, and
the French monarch, without striking a blow, made
himself master of that important<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fortress. The progress
of the French arms was rapid, and promised more con∣siderable
success than usually in that age attended mili∣tary
enterprizes. In answer to every advance which the
King of England made towards peace, Philip still in∣sisted,
that he should resign all his transmarine dominions
to his nephew, and rest contented with the kingdom
of England; when an event happened, which seemed
to turn the scales in John's favour, and to give him a de∣cisive
superiority over his enemies.</P>
<P>YOUNG Arthur, fond of military renown, had broke
into Poictou at the head of a small army; and passing
near Mirabel, he heard, that his grandmother, Queen
Eleanor, who had always opposed his interests, was
lodged in that place, and was protected by a weak gar∣rison,
and ruinous fortifications<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 167. M. West. p. 264.</NOTE>. He immediately de∣termined
to lay siege to the fortress, and make himself
master of her person: But John, rouzed from his indo∣lence
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>
by so pressing an occasion, collected an army of
English and Brabançons, and advanced from Normandy
with hasty marches to the relief of the Queen-mother.
He fell on Arthur's camp before that prince was aware
of the danger; dispersed his army; took him prisoner,
together with the count de la Marche, Geoffrey de Lu∣signan,
and the most considerable of the revolted barons;
and returned in triumph to Normandy<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ann. Marg. p. 213. M. West. p. 264.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st August.</NOTE> Philip, who
was lying before Arques in that dutchy, raised the siege,
and retired upon his approach<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 264. Ibid.</NOTE>. The greater part of
the prisoners were sent over to England; but Arthur
was shut up in the castle of Falaise.</P>
<P>THE King had here a conference with his nephew; re∣presented
to him the folly of his pretensions; and re∣quired
him to renounce the French alliance, which had
encouraged him to enter into enmity against all his fa∣mily:
But the brave youth, rendered more haughty from
misfortunes, maintained the justice of his cause; asserted
his claim, not only to the French provinces, but to the
crown of England; and in his turn, required the King
to restore the son of his elder brother to the possession of
his inheritance. John, sensible, from these symptoms
of spirit, that the young prince, tho' now a prisoner,
might some time prove a most dangerous enemy, deter∣mined
to prevent all future peril by dispatching his ne∣phew;
and Arthur was never more heard of.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Arthur, duke of Brittany.</NOTE> The cir∣cumstances
which attended this deed of darkness, were,
no doubt, carefully concealed by the actors, and are va∣riously
related by historians: But the most probable ac∣count
is as follows. The King, it is said, first propos∣ed
to William de la Braye, one of his servants, to dis∣patch
Arthur; but William replied, that he was a gen∣tleman,
not a hangman; and he positively refused com∣pliance.
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
Another instrument of murder was found, and
was dispatched with proper orders to Falaise; but Hu∣bert
de Bourg, chamberlain to the King, and constable of the castle,
feigning, that he himself would execute
the King's mandate, sent back the assassin, spread the re∣port
that the young prince was dead, and publicly per∣formed
all the ceremonies of his interment: But finding,
that the Bretons vowed vengeance for the murder, and
that all the revolted barons persevered more obstinately
in their rebellion, he thought it prudent to reveal the se∣cret,
and to inform the world that the duke of Brittany
was still alive, and in his custody. This discovery proved
fatal to the young prince: John first removed him to the
castle of Roüen; and coming in a boat, during the night∣time,
to that place, commanded Arthur to be brought
forth to him. The young prince, aware of his danger,
and now more subdued by the continuance of his misfor∣tunes,
and by the approach of death, threw himself on
his knees before his uncle, and begged for mercy: But
the barbarous tyrant, making no reply, stabbed him with
his own hands; and fastening a stone to the dead body,
threw it into the Seine.</P>
<P>THE whole world was struck with horror it his inhu∣man
deed; and from that moment, the King, detested by
his subjects, retained a very precarious authority over both
the people and the barons in his dominions. The Bre∣tons,
enraged at this disappointment in their fond hopes,
waged implacable war against him; and fixing the suc∣cession
of their government, put themselves in a posture
to revenge the murder of their sovereign. Johh had got
into his power his niece, Eleanor, sister to Arthur,
commonly called <HI>the damsel of Brittany;</HI> and carrying her
over to England, detained her ever after in captivity<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 145. T. Wykes, p. 36. Ypod Neust. p. 459.</NOTE>:
But the Bretons, in despair of recovering this princess,
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
chose Alice for their sovereign; a younger daughter of
Constantia, by her second marriage with Gui de Thouars;
and they entrusted the government of the dutchy to that
nobleman. Constantia, mean while, the mother of the
murdered prince, seconded by all the states of Brittany,
carried their complaints before Philip as their liege lord,
and demanded justice for the inhuman violence commit∣ted
by John on the person of Arthur, so near a relation,
who, notwithstanding the homage which he did to Nor∣mandy,
was always regarded as one of the chief vassals
of the crown. Philip received their application with
pleasure; summoned John to stand a trial before him;
and on his non-appearance, passed sentence, with the
concurrence of the peers, upon that prince; declared
him guilty of felony and parricide; and adjudged him to
forfeit to his superior lord all his seignories and fiefs in
France<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 455. M. West. p. 264. Knyghton, p. 2420.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King expelled from all the French provinces.</NOTE> whose ambitious and active
spirit had been hitherto confined, either by the sound po∣licy
of Henry, or the martial genius of Richard, seeing
now the opportunity favourable against this base and odi∣ous
prince, embraced the project of expelling the Eng∣lish,
or rather the English King, from France, and of
annexing to the crown so many considerable fiefs, which,
during several ages, had been dismembered from it. Ma∣ny
of the other gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t vassals, whose jealousy might have
interposed, and have obstructed the execution of this
project, were not at present in a situation to oppose it;
and the rest either looked on with indifference, or gave
their assistance to this dangerous aggrandizement of their
superior lord. The earls of Flanders and Blois were
engaged in the holy war: The count of Champagne was
an infant, and under the guardianship of Philip: The
dutchy of Brittany, enraged at the murder of their
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
prince, vigorously promoted all his measures: And the
general defection of John's vassals made every enterprize
easy and successful against him. Philip, after taking se∣veral
castles and fortresses beyond the Loire, which he
either garrisoned or dismantled, received the submissions
of the count of Alençon, who deserted John, and de∣livered
up all the places under his command to the
French King: Upon which, Philip separated his army,
in order to give them some repose after the fatigues of
the campaign. John, suddenly collecting some troops,
laid siege to Alençon; and Philip, whose dispersed army,
could not be brought together in time to succour it, saw
himself exposed to the disgrace of suffering the oppres∣sion
of his friend and confederate. But his active and
fertile genius found an expedient against this evil. There
was held at that very time a tournament at Moret in the
Gatinois; whither all the chief nobility of France and
the neighbouring countries had resorted, in order to sig∣nalize
their courage and address. Philip presented him∣self
before them; craved their assistance in his distress;
and pointed out the plains of Alençon as the most ho∣nourable
field, in which they could display their genero∣sity
and martial spirit. These valorous knights vowed,
that they would take vengeance on the base parricide,
the stain of arms and of chivalry; and putting them∣selves,
with all their retinue, under the command of
Philip, instantly marched to raise the siege of Alençon.
John, hearing of their approach, fled from before the
place; and in the hurry abandoned all his tents, machines,
and baggage, to the enemy.</P>
<P>THIS feeble effort was the last exploit of that slothful
and cowardly prince for the defence of his dominions.
He thenceforth remained in total inactivity at Roüen;
and passed all his time, with his young wife, in pastimes
and amusements, as if his state had been in the most
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
profound tranquillity, or his affairs in the most prosperous
condition. If he ever mentioned war, it was only to
give himself vaunting airs, which, in the eyes of all
men of sense, rendered him still more despicable and ri∣diculous.
<HI>Let the French go on,</HI> said he, <HI>I will retake in a
day what has cost them years to acquire</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 146. M. West. p. 266.</NOTE>. His stupidity and
indolence appeared so extraordinary, that the people en∣deavoured
to account for the infatuation by sorcery, and
believed, that he was thrown into this lethargy by some
magic or witchcraft. The English barons, finding that
their time was wasted to no purpose, and that they must
suffer the disgrace of seeing; without resistance, the pro∣gress
of the French arms, withdrew from their co∣lours,
and secretly returned to their own country<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 146. M. West. p. 246.</NOTE>. No
one thought of defending a man, who seemed to have
deserted himself; and his subjects looked on his fate with
the same indifference, to which, in this pressing exigen∣cy,
they saw him totally abandoned.</P>
<P>JOHN, while he neglected all domestic resources for
his safety, had the meanness to betake himself to a fo∣reign
power, whose protection he claimed: He applied
to the Pope, Innocent III. and entreated him to inter∣pose
with his authority between him and the French monarch.
Innocent, pleased with any occasion of exert∣ing
his superiority, sent Philip orders to stop the progress
of his arms, and to make peace with the King of Eng∣land.
But the French barons received this message with
indignation; disclaimed the temporal authority challenged
by the pontiff; and vowed, that they would, to the ut∣termost,
assist their prince against all his enemies: And
Philip, seconding their ardour, proceeded, instead of
obeying the Pope's envoys, to lay siege to Chateau Gail∣lard,
the most considerable fortress which remained to
guard the frontiers of Normandy.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="62"/>
CHATEAU GAILLARD was situated, partly on an island

secured by every advantage, which either art or nature
could b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ow upon it. The late King, having cast his
eye on this favourable situation, had spared no labour nor
expence in fortifying it; and it was defended by Roger
de Laci, constable of Chester, a determined officer, at
the head of a numerous garrison. Philip, who despaired
of taking the place by force, proposed to subdue it by
famine; and that he might cut off its communication
with the neighbouring country, he threw a bridge across
the Seine, while he himself with, his army blockaded it
by land. The earl of Pembroke, the man of greatest
vigour and capacity in the English court, formed a plan
for breaking thro' the French entrenchments, and throw∣ing
relief into the place. He carried with him an army
of 4000 infantry and 3000 cavalry, and suddenly at∣tacked,
with great success, Philip's camp in the night
time; having left orders, that a fleet of seventy flat-bot∣tomed
vessels should sail up the Seine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1205.</NOTE> and fall at the
same instant on the bridge. But the wind and the current
of the river, by retarding the vessels, disconcerted this
plan of operations; and it was morning before the fleet
appeared; when Pembroke, tho' successful in the begin∣ning
of the action, was already repulsed with considera∣ble
loss, and the French King had leisure to defend
himself against these new assailants, who were repulsed
in their turn. After this misfortune, John made no far∣ther
efforts for the relief of Chateau Gaillard; and Phi∣lip
had all the leisure requisite for conducting and finish∣ing
the siege. Roger de Laci defended himself for a
twelvemonth with great obstinacy; and having bravely
repulsed every attack, and patiently born all the hard∣ships
of famine, he was at last overpowered by a sudden
assault in the night-time, and made prisoner of war, with
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
his whole garrison<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 144. Gul. Britto, lib. 7. Ann. Waverl. p. 168.</NOTE>. Philip, who knew how to respect
valour even in an enemy, treated him with the utmost ci∣vility;
and gave him the whole city of Paris for the
place of his confinement.</P>
<P>WHEN this bulwark of Normandy was once subdued,
all the province lay open to the inroads of Philip; and
the King of England despaired of being any longer able
to defend it. He secretly prepared vessels for a scanda∣lous
flight; and that the Normans might no longer
doubt of his resolution to abandon them, he ordered the
fortifications of Pont de I'Arche, Moulineaux, and Mont∣fort
l'Amauri to be demolished. Not daring to repose
confidence in any of his barons, whom he believed to be
universally engaged in a conspiracy against him, he en∣trusted
the government of the province to Archas Martin
and Lupicaire, two mercenary Brabançons, whom he
had retained in his service. Philip, now secure of his
prey, pushed his conquests with vigour and success against
the dismayed Normans. Falaise was first besieged; and
Lupicaire, who commanded in this impregnable fortress,
after surrendering the place, basely inlisted himself with
his troops in the service of Philip, and carried on hosti∣lities
against his antient master. Caen, Cautance, Seez,
Evreux, Baïeux soon fell into the hands of the French
monarch, and all the lower Normandy was reduced un∣der
his dominion. To forward his enterprizes on the
other division of the province, Gui de Thouars, at the
head of the Bretons, broke into the territory, and took
Mount St. Michael, Avranches, and all the other for∣tresses
in that neighbourhood. The Normans, who ab∣horred
the French yoke, and who would have defended
themselves to the last extremity, if their prince had ap∣peared
to conduct them, found no resource but in submis∣sion;
and every city opened its gates, as soon as Philip ap∣peared
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
before it. Roüen alone, Arques and Verneüil de∣termined
to maintain their liberties; and formed a con∣federacy
together for mutual defence. Philip began with
the attack of Roüen; and the inhabitants were so in∣flamed
with hatred to France, that, on the appearance
of his army, they fell on all the natives of that country,
whom they found within their walls, and put them to
death. But after the French King had begun his ope∣rations
with success, and had taken some of their
outworks, the citizens, seeing no resource, offered to
capitulate;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st June.</NOTE> and demanded only thirty days to advertise
their prince of their danger, and to require succours
against the enemy. Upon the expiration of the term,
as no supply had arrived, they opened their gates to Phi∣lip<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 147. Ypod. Neust. p. 459.</NOTE>;
and the whole province soon after imitated their
example, and submitted to the victor. Thus was this
important territory re-united to the crown of France,
near three centuries after the cession of it by Charles the
Simple to Rollo, the first duke: And the Normans,
sensible that this conquest was probably final, demanded
the privilege of being governed by French laws; which
Philip, making a few alterations on the antient Norman
customs, readily granted them. But the French monarch
had too much ambition and genius to stop in his
present career of success. He carried his victorious army
into the western provinces; soon reduced Anjou, Maine,
Touraine, and part of Poictou under his dominion<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 149.</NOTE>;
and in this manner, the French crown, during the reign
of one able and active prince; received such an accession
of power and grandeur; as, in the ordinary course of
things, would have required it several ages to acquire.</P>
<P>JOHN, on his arrival in England, that he might cover
the disgrace of his own conduct, exclaimed loudly against
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
his barons, who, he pretended, had deserted his standard
in Normandy; and he arbitrarily extorted from them a
seventh part of all their moveables, as a punishment for
this offence<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, 146. M. West. p. 265.</NOTE>. Soon after he forced them to grant him a
scutage of two marks and a half on each knight's see for
an expedition into Normandy; but he did not attempt
to execute the service, for which he pretended to exact it.
Next year, he summoned all the barons of his realm to
attend him on this foreign expedition, and collected the
ships from all the sea-ports; but meeting with opposition
from some of his ministers, and repenting him of his
design, he dismissed both fleet and army, and then re∣newed
his exclamations against the barons for deserting
him. He next put to sea with a small army, and his
subject believed, that he was resolved to expose himslef
to the utmost hazards for the defence and recovery of his
dominions; But they were surprized, after a few days, to
see him return again into harbour, without attempting
any thing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1206.</NOTE> In the subsequent season, he had the cou∣rage
to carry his hostile measures a step farther. Guide
Thouars, who governed Brittany, being jealous of the
rapid progress, made by his ally, the French King, pro∣mised
to join the King of England, with all his forces;
and John ventured abroad with a considerable army, and
landed at Rochelle. He marched to Angers; which he
took and reduced to ashes. But the approach of Philip
with an army threw him into terrors; and he immedi∣ately
made proposals of peace, and fixed a place of in∣terview
with his enemy: But instead of keeping this en∣gagement,
he stole off with his army, embarked at Ro∣chelle,
and returned, loaded with new shame and dis∣grace,
into England. The mediation of the Pope pro∣cured
him at last a truce for two years with the
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
French monarch<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 141.</NOTE>; almost all the transmarine provinces
were ravished from him; and his English barons, tho'
harassed with arbitrary taxes and fruitless expeditions,
saw themselves and their country baffled and, affronted in
every enterprize.</P>
<P>IN an age, when personal valour was regarded as the
chief accomplishment, such conduct as that of John, dis∣graceful
at any time, must be exposed to peculiar con∣tempt;
and he could thenceforth expect to rule his tur∣bulent
vassals with a very doubtful authority. But the
government, exercised by the Norman princes, had
wound up the royal power to so high a pitch, and so
much beyond the usual tenor of the feudal constitutions,
that it behoved him to be debased by new affronts and
disgraces, ere his barons could entertain the views of
conspiring against him, in order to retrench his exorbi∣tant
prerogatives. The church, which, at that time,
declined not a contest with the most powerful and vigor∣ous
monarchs, took first advantage of John's imbecillity;
and with the most aggravating circumstances of insolence
and scorn, fixed her yoke upon him.</P>
<P>THE papal chair was then filled by Innocent III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1207.</NOTE>
who, having attained that dignity at the age of thirty∣seven
years, and being endowed with a lofty and enter∣prizing
genius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's quarrel with the court of France.</NOTE> gave full scope to his ambition, and attempt∣ted,
perhaps more openly than any of his predecessors, to
convert that superiority, which was yielded him by all
the European princes, into a real dominion over them.
The hierarchy, protected by the Roman pontiff, had al∣ready
carried to an enormous height its usurpations upon
the civil power; but in order to extend them farther,
and render them useful to the court of Rome, it was ne∣cessary
<PB N="56" REF="67"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="57" REF="68"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="58" REF="69"/>
to reduce the ecclesiastics themselves under an ab∣solute
monarchy, and to make them entirely dependant
on their spiritual leader. For this purpose, Innocent
first attempted to impose taxes at pleasure upon the cler∣gy;
and in the first year of this century, taking advan∣tage
of the popular frenzy for crusades, he sent collectors
over all Europe, who levied by his authority the for∣tieth
of all ecclesiastical revenues, for the relief of the
holy land, and received the voluntary contributions of
the laity to a like amount<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 119.</NOTE>. The same year Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury, attempted another innovation,
favourable to ecclesiastical and papal power: In the
King's absence, be summoned, by his legantine authori∣ty,
a synod of all the English clergy, contrary to the
prohibition of Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the chief justiciary;
and no proper censure was ever passed on this encroach∣ment,
the first of the kind, upon the royal power. But
a favourable incident soon after happened, which en∣abled
so aspiring a pontiff as Innocent, to extend still
farther his usurpations on so contemptible a prince as
John.</P>
<P>HUBERT, the primate, died in 1205; and as the
monks or canons of Christ-church, Canterbury, possess∣ed
a right of voting in the election of their archbishop,
some of the juniors of the order, who lay in wait for
that event, met clandestinely the very night of Hubert's
death; and without any congé d'elire from the King,
chose Reginald, their sub-prior, for the successor; in∣stalled
him in the archi-episcopal throne before midnight;
and having enjoined him the strictest secrecy, sent him
immediately to Rome, in order to solicit the confirma∣tion
of his election<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 148. M. West. p. 266.</NOTE>. The vanity of Reginald prevailed
over his policy; and he no sooner arrived in Flanders,
<PB N="59" REF="70"/>
than he revealed to every one the purpose of his journey,
which was immediately known in England<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 148. M. West. p. 266.</NOTE>. The King
was enraged at the novelty and temerity of the attempt,
in filling so important an office without his knowledge or
consent: The suffragan bishops of Canterbury, who
were accustomed to concur in the choice of their pri∣mate,
were no less displeased at the exclusion given them
in this election: The elder monks of Christ church
were injured by the irregular proceedingsof their juni∣ors:
The juniors themselves, ashamed of their conduct,
and disgusted with the levity of Reginald, who had broke
his engagement with them, were willing to set aside his
election<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 266.</NOTE>: And all men concurred in the design of reme∣dying
the false measures, which had been taken, But
as John knew, that this affair would be canvassed before
a superior tribunal, where the interposition of royal au∣thority,
in bestowing ecclesiastical benefices, was very
invidious; where even the cause of suffragan bishops
was not so favourable as that of monks; he determined
to make the new election entirely unexceptionable: He
submitted the affair wholly to the canons of Christ-church;
and, departing from the right, claimed by his
predecessors, ventured no farther than to inform them
privately, that they would do him an acceptable piece of
service, if they chose John de Gray, bishop of Norwich,
for their primate<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M, Paris, P. 149. M. West. p. 266.</NOTE>. The election of that prelate was
accordingly made without a contradictory vote; and the
King, to obviate all contests, endeavoured to persuade
the suffragan bishops not to insist on their right of con∣curring
in the election: But these prelates, persevering
in their pretensions, sent an agent to maintain their cause
before Innocent; while the King, and the convent
of Christ-church, dispatched twelve monks of that order to
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>
support, before the same tribunal, the election of the
bishop of Norwich.</P>
<P>THUS, there lay three different claims before the
Pope, whom all parties allowed to be the supreme arbiter
of the contest. The claim of the suffragans, being so
opposite to the usual maxims of the papal court, was
soon set aside: The election of Reginald was so obvious∣ly
fraudulent and irregular, that there was no possibitity
of defending it: But Innocent maintained, that, tho'
this election was null and invalid, it ought previously to
have been declared such by the sovereign pontiff, before
the monks could proceed to a new election; and that the
choice of the bishop of Norwich was of course as unca∣nonical
as that of his competitor<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 155. Chron. de Mailr. p. 182.</NOTE>. Advantage was,
therefore, taken of this subtlety for introducing a prece∣dent,
by which the fee of Canterbury, the most import∣ant
dignity in the church after the papal throne, should
be ever after at the disposal of the court of Rome.</P>
<P>WHILE the Pope maintained so many fierce contests,
in order to wreft from princes the right of granting in∣vestitures,
and to exclude laymen from all authority of
conferring ecclesiastical benefices, he was supported by
the united influence of the clergy, who, aspiring to in∣dependance
fought, with all the ardour of ambition,
and all the zeal of superstition, under his sacred banners.
But no sooner was this point, after a great effusion of
blood and the convulsions of many states, established in
some tolerable degree, than the victorious leader, as is
usual, turned his arms against his own community, and
aspired to center all power in his person. By the inven∣tion
of reserves, provisions, commendams, and other
devices, the Pope gradually assumed the right of filling
vacant benefices; and the plenitude of his apostolic
power, which was not subject to any limitations, suppli∣ed
<PB N="61" REF="72"/>
all defects of title in the person on whom he bestowed
preferment. The canons which regulated elections were
purposely rendered intricate and involved: Frequent dis∣putes
arose among candidates: Appeals were every day
carried to Rome: The apostolic see, besides reaping pe∣cuniary
advantages from these contests, often exercised
the power of setting aside both the litigants, and on pre∣tence
of appeasing faction, nominated a third person,
who might be more acceptable to the contending parties.</P>
<P>THE present controversy about the election to the see
of Canterbury afforded Innocent an opportunity of claim∣ing
this right; and he failed not to perceive and avail
himself of his advantage. He sent for the twelve monks
deputed by the convent to maintain the cause of the bi∣shop
of Norwich: and commanded them, under the pe∣nalty
of excommunication, to chuse for their primate,
cardinal Langton, an Englishman by birth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardinal Langton appointed archbishop of canter∣bury</NOTE> but educated
in France, and connected, by his interests and attach∣ments,
with the see of Rome<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 155. Ann. Waverl. p. 169. W. Heming, p. 553. Knyghton, p. 2415.</NOTE>. In vain did the monks
represent, that they had received from their convent no
authority for this purpose; that an election, without a
previous writ from the King, would be deemed highly
irregular; and that they were merely agents for another
person, whose right they had no power nor pretence to
abandon. None of them had the courage to persevere in
this opposition, except one, Elias de Brantefield: All
the rest, overcome by the menaces and authority of the
Pope, complied with his orders, and made the election
required of them.</P>
<P>INNOCENT, sensible that this flagrant usurpation would
be highly resented by the court of England, wrote John
a mollifying letter; sent him four golden rings set with
<PB N="62" REF="73"/>
precious stones; and endeavoured to enhance the value
of his present, by informing him of the many mysteries
which were implied in it. He begged him to consider se∣riously
the <HI>form</HI> of the rings, their <HI>number,</HI> their <HI>matter,</HI>
and their <HI>colour.</HI> Their form, he said, being round,
shadowed out Eternity, which had neither beginning nor
end; and he ought thence to learn his duty of aspiring
from earthly objects to heavenly, from things temporal
to things eternal. The number four, being a square,
denoted steadiness of mind, not to be subverted either
by adversity or prosperity, fixed for ever on the firm bas∣is
of the four cardinal virtues. Gold, which is the mat∣ter,
being the most precious of metals, signified Wis∣dom,
which is the most precious of all accomplishments,
and justly preferred by Solomon to riches, power, and
all exterior attainments. The blue colour of the eme∣rald
represented Faith; the verdure of the sapphire, Hope;
the redness of the ruby, Charity; and the splendor of
the topaz, Good Works<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 139. M. Paris, p. 155.</NOTE>. By these conceits, Innocent
endeavoured to repay John for one of the most important
prerogatives of his crown, which he had ravished
from him; conceits probably admired by Innocent him∣self.
For it is easily possible for a man, especially in a
barbarous age, to unite strong talents for business with
an absurd taste in science and the arts.</P>
<P>JOHN was inflamed with the utmost rage, when he
heard of this attempt of the court of Rome<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 143.</NOTE>; and he
immediately vented his passion on the monks of Christ-church,
whom he found inclined to support the election
made by their brethren at Rome. He sent Fulk de Can∣telupe,
and Henry de Cornhulle, two knights of his
train, men of violent tempers and rude manners, to ex∣pel
them the convent, and take possession of their reve∣nues
<PB N="63" REF="74"/>
These knights entered the monastery with drawn
swords, command<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the prior and the monks to depart
the kingdom, and menaced them, that, in case of dis∣obedience,
they would instantly burn them with the con∣vent<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 156. Trivet, p. 151. Ann. Waverl. p. 169.</NOTE>.
Innocent, prognosticating, from the violence
and imprudence of these measures, that John would
finally sink in the contest, persevered the more vigorous∣ly
in his pretensions, and exhorted the King not to op∣pose
God and the church any longer, nor to persecute
that cause for which the holy martyr, St. Thomas, had
sacrificed his life, and which had exalted him equal to
the highest saints in heavens<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 157.</NOTE>: A sufficient hint to John
to profit by the example of his father, and to remember
the prejudices and established principles of his subjects,
who bore a profound veneration to that martyr, and re∣garded
his merits as the subjects of their chief glory and
exultation.</P>
<P>THE pontiff, finding that John was not yet sufficient∣ly
tamed to submission, sent three prelates, the bishops
of London, Ely, and Worcester, to intimate to him,
that, if he persevered in his disobedience, Innocent
would be obliged to put the kingdom under the sentence
of interdict<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. All the other prelates threw themselves
on their knees before him; and entreated him, with tears
in their eyes, to prevent the scandal of this sentence, by
making a speedy submission to his spiritual Father, by re∣ceiving
from his hands the new elected primate, and by
restoring the monks of Christ-church to all their rights
and possessions. He burst out into the most indecent in∣vectives
against the prelates; swore by God's teeth, his
usual oath, that if the Pope presumed to put his king∣dom
under an interdict, he would send to him all the bi∣shops
and clergy of England, and would confiscate all
<PB N="64" REF="75"/>
their estates; and threatened, that, if thenceforth he
caught any Romans in his dominions, he would put out
their eyes, and cut off their noses, in order to set a mark
upon them, which might distinguish them from all other
nations<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Amidst all this idle violence, John stood on
such bad terms with his nobility, that he never dared to
assemble the states of the kingdom, who, in so just a
cause, would probably have adhered to any other mo∣narch,
and have defended with vigour the liberties of
the nation against these palpable usurpations of the court
of Rome. Innocent, therefore, perceiving the King's
weakness, issued at last the sentence of interdict, which
he had for some time held suspended over him<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Paris, p. 157. Trivet, p. 152. Ann. Waverl. p. 170. M. West. p. 268▪</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE sentence of interdict was at that time the great
instrument of vengeance and policy employed by the
Court of Rome; was pronounced against sovereigns for
the lightest offences; and made the guilt of one per∣son
involve the ruin of millions, even in their spiritual
and eternal welfare. The execution of it was artificial∣ly
calculated to strik<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the senses in the highest degree,
and to operate with irresistible force on the superstitious
minds of the people. The nation was of a sudden de∣prived
of all exterior exercise of its religion: The altars
were despoiled of their ornaments: The crosses, the re∣liques,
the images, the statues of the saints were laid on
the ground; and as if the air itself were profaned, and
might pollute them by its contact, the priests carefully
covered them up, even from their own approach and ve∣neration.
The use of bells entirely ceased in all the
churches: The bells themselves were removed from the
steeples, and laid on the ground with the other sacred
utensils. Mass was celebrated with shut doors; and
none but the priests were admitted to that holy institu∣tion,
<PB N="65" REF="76"/>
The laity partook of no religious rite, except
baptism to new-born infants, and the communion to the
dying: The dead were not interred in consecrated
ground: They were thrown into ditches, or buried in
common fields; and their obsequies were not attended
with prayers or any hallowed ceremony. Marriage was
celebrated in the church-yards<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 51.</NOTE>; and that every action
in life might bear the marks of this dreadful situation, the
people were prohibited the use of meat, as in Lent, or
times of the highest penance; were debarred from all
pleasures and entertainments; and were forbid even to
salute each other, or so much as to shave their beards,
and give any decent attention to their person and apparel.
Every circumstance carried the symptoms of the deepest
distress, and of the most immediate apprehensions of di∣vine
vengeance and indignation.</P>
<P>THE King, that he might oppose <HI>his</HI> temporal to <HI>their</HI>
spiritual terrors, immediately, from his own authority,
confiscated the estates of all the clergy who obeyed the
interdict<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 170.</NOTE>; banished the prelates, confined the monks
to their convent, and gave them only such a small al∣lowance
from their own estates, as would suffice to pro∣vide
them in food and rayment. He treated with the
utmost rigour all Langton's adherents, and every one
that showed any disposition to obey the orders of Rome:
And that he might distress the clergy in the tenderest
point, and at the same time expose them to reproach and
ridicule, he threw into prison all their concubines, and
required high fines and confiscations as the price of their
liberty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 158. Ann. Waverl. p. 170.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the canons, which established the celibacy of
the clergy, were, by the zealous endeavours of archbi∣shop
Anselm, more rigorously executed in England, the
<PB N="66" REF="77"/>
ecclesiastics gave, almost universally and avowedly, into
the use of concubinage; and the court of Rome, which
had no interest in prohibiting this practice, made a very
slight opposition to it. The custom was become so pre∣valent,
that in some cantons of Swisserland, before the
reformation, the laws not only permitted, but, to avoid
scandal, enjoined the use of concubines to the younger
clergy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo, Hist. Conc. Trid. lib. I.</NOTE>; and it was usual every where for priests to ap∣ply
to their ordinary, and obtain from him a formal li∣berty
for this indulgence. The bishop commonly took
care to prevent this practice from degenerating into li∣centiousness:
He confined the priest to the use of one
woman, required him to be constant to her bed, obli∣ged
him to provide for her subsistance and that of her
children; and, tho' the offspring was, in the eye of the
law, deemed illegitimate, this commerce was really a
kind of inferior marriage, such as is still practised in
Germany among the nobles; and may be regarded by
the candid as an appeal, from the tyranny of civil and
ecclesiastical institutions, to the more virtuous and more
unerring laws of nature.</P>
<P>THE quarrel between the King and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee of Rome
continued for some years; and tho' many of the clergy,
from the fear of punishment, obeyed the orders of Johns,
and celebrated divine service, they complied with the ut∣most
reluctance, and were regarded, both by themselves
and the people, as men who betrayed their principles,
and sacrificed their conscience to temporal regards and in∣terests.
During this violent situation, the King, in or∣der
to give a lustre to his government, attempted milita∣ry
expeditions, against Scotland, against Ireland, against
the Welsh<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Homing, p. 556. Ypod Neust. p. 460. Knyghton, p. 2420.</NOTE>; and he commonly prevailed, more from
the weakness of his enemies than from his own vigour or
<PB N="67" REF="78"/>
abilities. Meanwhile, the danger to which his govern∣ment
stood continually exposed from the discontents of
the ecclesiastics, increased his natural propension to ty∣ranny;
and he seems even wantonly to have disgusted all
orders of men, especially his nobles, from whom alone
he could reasonably expect support and assistance. He
dishonoured their families by his licentious amours; he
published edicts, prohibiting them from hunting feather∣ed
game, and thereby restrained them from their favou∣rite
occupation and amusement<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Westm. p. 268.</NOTE>; he ordered all the
hedges and fences near his forests to be levelled, that his
deer might have more ready access into the fields for pas∣ture;
and he continually loaded the nation with arbitra∣ry
taxes and impositions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1208.</NOTE> Conscious of the general ha∣tred
which he had incurred, he required his nobility to
give him hostages for security of their allegiance; and
they were obliged to put into his hands their sons, or ne∣phews,
or near relations. When his messengers came
with like orders to the castle of William de Braouse, a
baron of great note, the lady of that nobleman replied,
that she would never entrust her son into the hands of
one who had murdered his own nephew, while in his
custody. Her husband reproved her for the severity of
this speech; but, sensible of his danger, he immediately
fled with his wife and son into Ireland, where he endea∣voured
to conceal himself. The King discovered the
unhappy family in their retreat; seized the wife and son,
whom he starved to death in prison; and the baron him∣self
narrowly escaped, by flying into France<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 158, 161. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 52. Ann. Waverl. p. 172. Ann. Marg. p. 15. M. West. p 268, 269.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE church of Rome had artificially contrived a gra∣dation
of sentences;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1209.</NOTE> by which the kept offenders in
<PB N="68" REF="79"/>
awe; still afforded them an opportunity of preventing
the next anathema by submission; and in case of their
obstinacy, was able to refresh the horror of the people
against them, by new denunciations of the wrath and
vengeance of heaven. As the sentence of interdict had
not operated the desired effect on John, and as his
people, tho' extremely discontented, had hitherto been
restrained from rising into open rebellion against him, he
was soon to look for the sentence of excommunication:
And he had reason to apprehend, that, notwithstanding
all his precautions, the most dangerous consequences
might ensue from it. He was witness of the other
scenes, which, at that very time, were acting in Europe,
and which displayed the unbounded and uncontrouled
power of the papacy. Innocent, far from being dismay∣ed
at his contests with the King of England, had excom∣municated
the Emperor Otho, John's nephew<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M▪ Paris▪ p. 160. Trivet, p. 154. M. West. p. 269.</NOTE>; and
soon brought that powerful and haughty prince to submit
to his authority. He published a crusade against the Al∣bigenses,
a species of enthusiasts in the south of France,
whom he denominated heretics, because, like other en∣thusiasts,
they neglected the rites of the church, and op∣posed
the power and influence of the clergy: The people
from all parts of Europe, moved by their superstition and
their passion for wars and adventures, flocked to his
standard: Simon de Montfort, the general of the cru∣sade,
acquired to himself a sovereignty in these provinces:
The count de Tholouse, who protected the Albigenses,
was despoiled of his dominions: And these sectaries
themselves, tho' the most innocent and inoffensive of
mankind, were exterminated with all the circumstances
of the most extreme violence and barbarity. Here was
therefore both an army and a general, dangerous from
their zeal and valour, ready to act against John; and
<PB N="69" REF="80"/>
Innocent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excom∣munication of the King.</NOTE> after keeping the thunder long suspended,
gave at last authority to the bishops of London, Ely,
and Worcester, to denounce the sentence of excommu∣nication
against him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 159. M. West. p. 270.</NOTE>. These prelates obeyed; tho'
their brethren were deterred from publishing, as the
Pope required of them, the sentence in the several
churches of their dioceses.</P>
<P>NO sooner was the excommunication known, than
the effects of it appeared. Geoffrey, archdeacon of
Norwich, who was entrusted with a considerable office
in the court of exchequer, being informed of it while
sitting on the bench, observed to his brethren the danger
of serving under an excommunicated King; and he im∣mediately
left his chair, and departed the court. John
gave orders to seize him, to throw him into prison, to
cover his head with a great leaden cope; and by this and
other severe usage, he soon put an end to his life<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 159.</NOTE>: Nor
was there any thing wanting to Geoffrey, except the dig∣nity
and rank of Becket, to exalt him to an equal, station
in heaven with that great and celebrated martyr. Hugh
de Wells, the King's chancellor, being elected, by his
appointment, bishop of Lincoln, upon a vacancy in that
see, desired leave to go abroad, in order to receive conse∣cration
from the archbishop of Roüen; but he no sooner
reached France, than he hastened to Pontigny, where Lang∣ton
then resided, and paid submissions to him as his primate.
The bishops, finding themselves exposed equally to the
jealousy of the King and hatred of the people, gradually
stole out of the kingdom; and at last there remained only
three prelates to perform the functions of the episcopal
office<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 170. Ann. Marg. p. 14.</NOTE>. Many of the nobility, terrified with John's ty∣ranny,
and obnoxious to him on one account or other,
<PB N="70" REF="81"/>
imitated the example of the bishops; and most of the
others, who remained, were with reason suspected of
having secretly entered into a confederacy against him<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 162. M. West. p. 270, 271.</NOTE>. John was alarmed at his dangerous situation; a situation,
which prudence, vigour, and popularity, might formerly
have prevented, but which no virtues nor abilities were
now sufficient to remedy. He desired a conference with
Langton at Dover; offered to acknowledge him as pri∣mate,
to submit to the Pope, to restore the exiled clergy,
even to pay them a limited sum of money as a compensa∣tion
for the rents of their confiscated estates. But
Langton, perceiving his advantage, was not satisfied
with these concessions: He demanded, that full restitu∣tion
and reparation should be made to all the clergy; a
condition so exorbitant, that the King, who probably
had not the power of fulfilling it, and who foresaw that
this estimation of damages might amount to an infinite
sum, finally broke off the conference<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 171.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE next gradation of papal sentences was to absolve
John's subjects from their oaths of fidelity and allegiance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1212.</NOTE>
and to declare every one excommunicated who had any
commerce with him, in public or in private; at his table,
in his council, or even in private conversation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 161. M. West. p. 270.</NOTE>: And
this sentence was accordingly, with all imaginable so∣lemnity,
denounced against him▪ But as John still per∣severed
in his contumacy, there remained nothing but
the sentence of deposition; which, tho' intimately con∣nected
with the former, had been distinguished from it
by the artifice of the Romish church; and Innocent de∣termined
to dart this last thunder-bolt against the refrac∣tory
monarch. But as a sentence of this kind required an
armed force to execute it, the pontiff, casting his eyes
<PB N="71" REF="82"/>
around, pitched at last on Philip, King of France, as
the person, into whose powerful hand he could most pro∣perly
entrust that weapon, the ultimate resource of his
ghostly authority. And he proffered that monarch, be∣sides
the remission of all his sins and endless spiritual be∣nefits,
the property and possession of the kingdom of
England, as the reward of his labour<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 162. M. West. p. 271.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was the common concern of all princes to oppose
these exorbitant pretensions of the Roman pontiff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1213.</NOTE> by
which they themselves were rendered vassals, and vassals
totally dependant, of the papal crown: Yet even Philip,
the most able monarch of the age, was seduced, by pre∣sent
interest, and by the prospect of so tempting a prize,
to accept this liberal offer of the pontiff, and thereby to
ratify that authority, which, if he ever opposed its
boundless usurpations, might, next day, tumble him
from the throne. He levied a great army; summoned
all the vassals of his crown to attend him at Roüen;
collected a fleet of 1700 vessels, great and small, in the
sea-ports of Normandy and Picardy; and partly from the
zeal of the age, partly from the personal regard, univer∣sally
paid him, prepared a force, which seemed equal to
the greatness of his enterprize. The King, on the other
hand, issued out writs, requiring the attendance of all
his military vassals at Dover, and even of all able-bodied
men, to defend the kingdom in this dangerous extremity.
An infinite number appeared; of whom he slected an
army of 60,000 men; a power invincible, had they been
united in affections to their prince, and animated with a
becoming zeal for the defence of their native country<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 163. M. West. p. 271.</NOTE>.
But the people were swayed by superstition, and regarded
their King with horror, as anathematized by papal cen∣sures:
<PB N="72" REF="83"/>
The barons, besides lying under the same preju∣dices,
were all disgusted with his tyranny, and were,
many of them, suspected of holding a secret correspon∣dence
with the enemy: And the incapacity and cowardice
of the king himself, ill fitted to struggle with those
mighty difficulties, made men prognosticate the most fa∣tal
effects from the French invasion.</P>
<P>PANDOLF,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th May.</NOTE> whom the Pope had chosen for his legate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's submission to the Pope.</NOTE>
and appointed to head this important expedition, had,
before he left Rome, applied for a secret conference with
his master, and had asked him, whether if the King of
England, in this desperate situation, were willing to sub∣mit
to the apostolic see, he should grant him, any terms
of accommodation<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 162.</NOTE>? Innocent, who expected more
advantages from his agreement with a prince so abject
both in character and fortune, than from his alliance
with a great and victorious monarch, who, after such
mighty acquisitions, might become too haughty to be
bound by spiritual chains, explained to Pandolf the con∣ditions
on which he was willing to be reconciled to the
King of England. The legate, therefore, as soon as he
arrived in the north of France, sent over two knights
templars to desire an interview with John at Dover,
which was readily granted; and he there represented to
him, in such strong, and probably in such true colours,
his lost condition, the disaffection of his subjects, the
secret combination of his vassals against him, the mighty
armament of France, that John yielded at discretion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 271.</NOTE>,
and subscribed to all the conditions which Pandolf was
pleased to impose upon him. He promised, among other
articles, that he would submit himself entirely to the
judgment of the Pope; that he would acknowledge
Langton for primate; that he would restore all the exiled
clergy and laity, who had been banished on account of
the contest; that he would make them full restitution of
<PB N="73" REF="84"/>
their goods, and compensation for all damages, and in∣stantly
consign eight thousand pounds, in part of pay∣ment;
and that every one outlawed or imprisoned for
their adherence to the Pope, should immediately be re∣ceived
into grace and favour<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 166. M. Paris, p. 163. Annal. Burt. p. 268.</NOTE>. Four barons swore, along
with the King, to the observance of this ignominious treaty<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 170. M. Paris, p. 163.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the ignominy of the King was not yet carried to
its full height. Pandolf, as the first specimen of his de∣ference
to the Pope's orders, required him to resign his
kingdom to the church, and he persuaded him, that he
could no way so effectually disappoint the French inva∣sion,
as by thus, putting himself under the immediate
protection of the apostolic see. John, lying under the
agonies of present terror, made no scruple of submitting
to this condition. He passed a charter, in which he said,
that, not constrained by fear, but of his own free-will,
and by the common advice and consent of his barons, he
had, for the remission of his own sins and those of his fa∣mily,
resigned England and Ireland to God, to St. Peter
and St. Paul, and to Pope Innocent and his successors in
the apostolic chair: He agreed to hold these dominions
as feudatory of the church of Rome, by the annual pay∣ment
of a thousand marks; seven hundred for England,
three hundred for Ireland: And he stipulated, that if he
or his successors should ever presume to revoke or infringe
this charter, they should instantly, except upon admoni∣tion
they repented them of their offence, forfeit all right
to their dominions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 176. M. Paris, p. 165. Trivet, p. 158. Ann. Waverl. p. 177. W, Heming. p. 554. M. West. p. 271. 272. Ann. Burt. p. 269.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN consequence of this agreement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th May.</NOTE> John did homage
to Pandolf as the Pope's legate, with all the humiliating
<PB N="74" REF="85"/>
rites which the feudal law required of vassals before their
liege-lord and superior. He came disarmed into the le∣gate's
presence, who was seated on a throne; he flung
himself on his knees before him; he lifted up his joined
hands, and put them within those of Pandolf; he swore
fealty to the Pope; and he paid part of the tribute, which
he owed for his kingdom as the patrimony of St. Peter.
The legate, elated by this supreme triumph of sacerdotal
power, could not forbear discovering extravagant symp∣toms
of joy and exultation: He trampled on the money,
which was laid at his feet as an earnest of the subjection
of the kingdom: An insolence, which, however offen∣sive
to all the English, no one present, except the arch∣bishop
of Dublin, dared to take any notice of. But
tho' Pandolf had brought the King to submit to these
base conditions, he still refused to take off the excommu∣nication
and interdict, till an estimation should be taken
of the losses of the ecclesiastics, and full compensation
and restitution should be made them.</P>
<P>JOHN, reduced to this abject situation under a foreign
power, still showed the same disposition to tyranny over
his subjects, which had been the chief cause of all his
misfortunes. One Peter of Pomfret, a hermit, had fore∣told,
that the King, this very year, should lose his
crown; and for that rash prophecy, he had been thrown
into prison in Corfe-castle. John now determined to
bring him to punishment as an impostor; and tho' the
man pleaded, that his prophecy was fulfilled, and that
the King had lost the royal and independant crown which
he formerly wore, the defence was supposed to augment
his guilt: He was dragged at horses tails to the town of
Warham, and there hanged on a gibbet with his son<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 165. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 56. Chron. Mailr. p 186, 187. T. Wykes, p. 37. Ann. Waverl. p. 179. M. West. p. 270, 272, Knyghton, p. 2324.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86"/>
WHEN Pandolf, after receiving the homage of John,
returned to the court of France, he congratulated Philip
on the success of his pious enterprize; and informed him
that John, moved by the terror of the French arms, had
now come to a just sense of his guilt; had returned to
obedience under the apostolic see; had even consented
to do homage to the Pope for his dominions; and having
thus made his kingdom a part of St. Peter's patrimony,
had rendered it impossible for any Christian prince, with∣out
the most manifest and most flagrant impiety, to at∣tack
him<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, p. 160.</NOTE>. Philip was in a rage on receiving this intel∣ligence:
He exclaimed, that having, at the Pope's in∣stigation,
undertaken an expedition, which had cost him
above 60,000 pounds sterling, he was frustrated of his
purpose, at the time when its success was become infalli∣ble:
He complained, that all the expence had fallen up∣on
him; all the advantage had accrued to. Innocent: He
threatened to be no longer the dupe of these hypocriti∣cal
pretences: And assembling his vassals, he laid before
them the ill treatment which he had received, exposed
the interested and fraudulent conduct of the Pope, and re∣quired
their assistance to execute his enterprize against
England, in which, he told them, that, notwithstand∣ing
the inhibitions and menaces of the legate, he was
determined to persevere. The French barons were in
that age little less ignorant and superstitious than the
English: Yet, so much does the influence of these reli∣gious
principles depend on the present disposition of mens
minds! they all vowed to follow their prince on his in∣tended
expedition, and were resolute not to be disap∣pointed
of that glory and those riches, which they had
long expected from this enterprize. The earl of Flan∣ders
alone, who had previously formed a secret treaty
with John, declaring against the injustice and impiety of
the undertaking, withdrew with his forces<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 166.</NOTE>; and Phi∣lip,
<PB N="76" REF="87"/>
that he might not leave so dangerous an enemy be∣hind
him, first turned his arms against the dominions of
that prince. Meanwhile, the English fleet was assem∣bled
under the earl of Salisbury, the King's natural bro∣ther;
and tho' inferior in number, received orders to at∣tack
the French in their harbours. Salisbury performed
this service with so much success, that he
took three hundred ships; destroyed a hundred more<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 166. Chron. dunst, vol. i. p. 59. Trivet, p. 157.</NOTE>: And Philip,
finding it impossible to prevent the rest from falling into
the hands of the enemy, set fire to them himself, and
thereby rendered it impossible for him to proceed any
farther in his enterprize.</P>
<P>JOHN, exulting in his present security, insensible to
his past disgrace, was so elated with this success, that he
thought of no less than of invading France in his turn,
and of recovering all those provinces which the prosperous
arms of Philip had formerly ravished from him. He pro∣posed
this expedition to the barons, who were already as∣sembled
for the defence of the kingdom. But the Eng∣lish
barons both hated and despised their prince: They
prognosticated no success to any enterprize conducted by
such a leader: And pretending, that their time of service
was elapsed, and all their provisions exhausted, they re∣fused
to second his undertaking<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 166.</NOTE>. The King, however,
resolute in his purpose, embarked with a few followers,
and failed to Jersey, in the foolish notion, that the barons
would at last be ashamed to stay behind<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But finding
himself disappointed, he returned to England; and rais∣ing
some troops, threatened to take vengeance on all his
nobles for their desertion and disobedience. The arch∣bishop
of Canterbury, who was in a confederacy with
the nobles, here interposed; strictly inhibited the King
from thinking of such an attempt; and threatened him
<PB N="77" REF="88"/>
with a renewal of the sentence of excommunication, it
he pretended to levy war upon any of his subjects, before
the kingdom was freed from the sentence of interdict<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE church had dissolved the several anathemas pro∣nounced
against John, by the same gradual progress with
which she had at first issued them. By receiving his ho∣mage,
and admitting him to the rank of vassal, his de∣position
was annulled, and his subjects were again bound
by their oaths of allegiance. The exiled prelates then
returned in great triumph, with Langton at their head;
and the King, hearing of their approach, went forth to
meet them, and throwing himself on the ground before
them, he entreated them with tears to have compassion
on him and the kingdom of England<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 166. Ann. Waverl. p 178.</NOTE>. The primate,
seeing these marks of sincere penitence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th July.</NOTE> led him to the
chapter-house of Winchester, and there administered an
oath to him, by which he again swore fealty and obedi∣ence
to Pope Innocent and his successors; promised to
love, maintain, and defend holy church and the clergy;
engaged, that he would re-establish the good laws of his
ancestorS, particularly those of St. Edward, and would
abolish the wicked ones; and expressed his resolution of
maintaining justice and right in all his dominions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 166.</NOTE>. The
primate next gave him absolution in the requisite forms,
and admitted him to dine with him, to the great joy of all
the people. The sentence, however, of interdict was still
upheld against the kingdom. A new legate, Nicholas, bi∣shop
of Frescati, came into England, in the place of Pan∣dolf;
and he declared it to be the Pope's intentions never
to loosen that sentence, till full restitution was made to the
clergy of every thing taken from them, and ample repa∣ration
for all damages which they had sustained<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 160. Ann. Waverl. p. 178.</NOTE>.
He only permitted mass to be said with a low voice in the
<PB N="78" REF="89"/>
churches, till these losses and damages could be estimated
to the satisfaction of the parties. Certain barons were
appointed to take an account of the claims<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Brady's Append. N° 103, 104.</NOTE>; and John
was astonished at the greatness of the sums, to which the
clergy made their losses to amount. No less than twenty
thousand marks were demanded by the monks of Can∣terbury
alone; twenty-three thousand for the see of Lin∣coln<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. 1. p. 64.</NOTE>;
and the King, finding these pretensions to be in∣finite
and endless, proffered the clergy the sum of an
hundred thousand marks for a final acquittal. The cler∣gy
rejected the offer with disdain; but the Pope, willing
to favour his new vassal, whom he found zealous in his
declarations of fealty, and regular in paying the sti∣pulated
tribute to Rome, directed his legate to accept of
forty thousand<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 173. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 62.</NOTE>. The issue-of the whole was, that the
bishops and considerable abbots got reparation beyond
what they had any title to demand: The inferior clergy
were obliged to the sit down contented with their losses<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 179.</NOTE>:
And the King, after the sentence of interdict was taken
off, renewed, in the most solemn manner, and by a new
charter, sealed with gold, his professions of homage and
obedience to the see of Rome<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 172.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN this vexatious affair was at last brought to a
conclusion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1214</NOTE> the King, as if he had nothing farther to at∣tend
to but triumphs and victories, went over to Poictou,
which still acknowledged his authority<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Queen Eleanor died in 1203 or 1204.</NOTE>; and he carried
war into Philip's dominions. He besieged a castle near
Angiers; but the approach of prince Lewis, Philip's
son, obliged him to raise the siege with such precipita∣tion,
that he left his tents, machines, and baggage be∣hind
him; and he returned to England with disgrace.
<PB N="79" REF="90"/>
About the same time, he heard of the great and decisive
victory gained by the King of France at Bovines over
the Emperor Otho, who had entered France at the head
of 150,000 Germans; a victory which established for ever
the glory of Philip, and gave full security to all his do∣minions.
John could therefore think henceforth of no∣thing
farther, than of ruling peaceably his own kingdom;
and his close conjunction with the Pope, which he was
determined at any price to maintain, ensured him, as he
imagined, the certain attainment of this object. But the
last and most grievous scene of this prince's misfortunes
still awaited him; and he was destined to pass thro'a series
of more humiliating circumstances than had ever yet fal∣len
to the lot of any other monarch.</P>
<P>THE introduction of the feudal law into England by
William the Conqueror had much infringed the liberties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents of the ba∣rons.</NOTE>
however imperfect, enjoyed by the Anglo-Saxons in their
antient government, and had reduced the whole people
to a state of vassalage under the King or barons, and
even the greatest part of them to a real state of slavery.
The necessity also of devolving great power into the
hands of a prince, who was to maintain a military do∣minion
over a vanquished nation, had engaged the Nor∣man
barons to submit to a more rigorous▪ and absolute
authority, than that to which men of their rank, in other
feudal governments, were commonly subjected. The
prerogatives of the crown, once raised to a high pitch,
were not easily reduced; and the nation, during the
course of a hundred and fifty years, had groaned under
a tyranny, unknown to all the kingdoms founded by
the northern conquerors. Henry I. that he might allure
the people to give an exclusion to his elder brother Ro∣bert,
had granted them a charter, favourable in many
particulars to their liberties; Stephen had renewed this
grant; Henry II. had confirmed it: But the concessions
<PB N="80" REF="91"/>
of all these princes had still remained without effect; and
the same unlimited, at least irregular authority, conti∣nued
to be exercised both by them and their successors.
The only happiness was, that arms were never yet ra∣vished
from the hands of the barons and people: The
nation, by a great confederacy, might still vindicate its
liberties: And nothing was more likely, than the cha∣racter,
conduct, and fortunes of the present sovereign,
to produce such a general union and combination against
him. Equally odious and contemptible, both in public
and private life, he affronted the barons by his insolence,
dishonoured their families by his gallantries, enraged
them by his tyranny, and gave discontent to all ranks
of men by his endless exactions and impositions<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Mailr. p. 188. T. Wykes, p. 36. Ann. Waverl. p. 181. W Heming. p. 557.</NOTE>. The
effect of these lawless practices had already appeared in
the general demand made by the barons of a restoration
of their privileges; and after he had reconciled himself
to the Pope, by abandoning the independance of the king∣dom,
he appeared to all the world in so mean a light,
that they universally thought they might with safety and
honour insist upon their pretensions.</P>
<P>BUT nothing forwarded this confederacy so much as
the concurrence of Langton, archbishop of Canterbury;
a man, whole memory, tho' he was obtruded on the na∣tion
by a palpable incroachment of. the fee of Rome,
ought always to be respected by the English. This pre∣late,
whether he was moved by the generosity of his nature
and his affection to public good; or had entertained an
animosity against John, on account of the long opposition
made by that prince to his election; or thought, that
an acquisition of liberty to the people would serve to in∣crease
and secure the privileges of the church; had formed
the plan of reforming the government, and had prepared
the way for that great innovation, by inserting those
<PB N="81" REF="92"/>
singular clauses above-mentioned in the oath, which he ad∣ministered
to the King, before he would absolve him from
the sentence of excommunication. Soon after, in a private
meeting of some principal barons at London, he showed
them a copy of Henry I.'s charter, which, he said, he had
happily found in a monastery; and he exhorted them to
insist on the renewal and observance of it: The barons
swore, that they would sooner lose their lives than depart
from so reasonable a demand<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 167.</NOTE>. The confederacy began
now to spread wider, and to comprehend almost all the
barons of England; and a new and more numerous meet∣ing
was summoned by Langton at St. Edmondsbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> un∣der
colour of devotion. He again produced to the assem∣bly
the old charter of Henry; renewed his exhortations
of unanimity and vigour in the prosecution of their purpose;
and represented in the strongest colours the tyran∣ny
to which they had so long been subjected, and from
which it now behoved them to free themselves and their
posterity<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 175.</NOTE>. The barons, inflamed by his eloquence, in∣cited
by the sense of their wrongs, and encouraged by
the appearance of their power and numbers, solemnly
took an oath before the high altar, to adhere to each
other, to insist on their demands, and to make endless
war on the King, till he should submit to grant them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 176.</NOTE>.
They agreed, that, after the festival of Christmas, they
would prefer in a body their common petition; and in
the mean time, they separated, after mutually promising,
that they would put themselves in a posture of defence,
would inlist men and purchase arms, and would supply
their castles with the necessary provisions.</P>
<P>THE barons appeared in London on the day appointed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1215.</NOTE>
and demanded of the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Janu∣ary.</NOTE> that, in consequence of his
own oath before the primate, as well as in deference to
<PB N="82" REF="93"/>
their just rights, he would grant them a renewal of Henry's
charter, and a confirmation of the laws of St. Edward.
The King, alarmed with their zeal and unanimity, as
well as with their power, required a delay; promised,
that at the festival of Easter, he would give them a posi∣tive
answer to their petition; and offered them the arch∣bishop
of Canterbury, the bishop of Ely, and the earl
of Pembroke, the Mareschal, as sureties for his fulfilling
this engagement<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 176. M. West. p. 273.</NOTE>. The barons accepted of the terms,
and peaceably returned to their castles.</P>
<P>DURING this interval,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th Janu∣ary.</NOTE> John, in order to break or
subdue the league of his barons, endeavoured to avail
himself of the ecclesiastical power, of whose influence
he had, from his own recent misfortunes, had such fatal
experience. He granted to the clergy a charter, aban∣doning
for ever that important prerogative, for which
his father and all his ancestors had zealously contended;
yielding to them the free election on all vacancies; re∣serving
only the power to issue a congé d'elire, and to
subjoin a confirmation of the election; and declaring,
that, if either of these were with-held, the choice
should nevertheless be deemed just and valid<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 197.</NOTE>. He made
a vow to lead an army into Palestine against the infidels,
and he took on him the cross; in hopes, that he would
receive from the church that protection, which she ten∣dered
to every one that had entered into this sacred and
meritorious engagement<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 200. Trivet, p. 162. T. Wykes, p. 37. M. West. p. 273.</NOTE>. And he sent to Rome his
agent, William de Mauclerc, in order to appeal to the
Pope against the tyranny of his barons, and procure him
a favourable sentence from that powerful tribunal<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 184.</NOTE>. The
barons also were not negligent on their part in endea∣vouring
to engage the Pope in their interests: They dis∣patched
<PB N="83" REF="94"/>
Eustace de Vescie to Rome; laid their case be∣fore
Innocent as their feudal lord; and petitioned him to
interpose his authority with the King, and oblige him to
restore and confirm all their just and undoubted privi∣leges<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INNOCENT beheld with regret the disturbances which
had arisen in England, and was much inclined to favour
John in his pretensions. He had no other hopes of re∣taining
and extending his newly acquired superiority
over that kingdom, but by supporting so base and dege∣nerate
a prince, who was willing to sacrifice every consi∣deration
to his present safety; and he foresaw, that, if
the administration fell into the hands of these gallant and
high-spirited barons, they would vindicate the honour,
liberty, and independance of the nation, with the fame
ardour which they now exerted in defence of their own.
He wrote letters therefore to the prelates, to the nobility,
and to the King himself. He exhorted the first to em∣ploy
their good offices in conciliating peace between the
contending parties, and putting an end to civil discord:
To the second, he expressed his disapprobation of their
conduct in employing force to extort concessions from
their reluctant sovereign: The last, he advised to treat
his nobles with grace and indulgence, and to grant them
such of their demands as should appear just and reason∣able
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 196, 197.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE barons easily saw, from the tenor of these letters,
that they must lay their account with having the
Pope, as well as the King, for their adversary; but they
had already advanced too far to recede from their preten∣sions,
and their passions were so deeply engaged, that it
exceeded even the power of superstition itself any longer
to controul them. They also foresaw, that the thunders
of Rome, when not seconded by the efforts of the Eng∣lish
<PB N="84" REF="95"/>
ecclesiastics, would be of small avail against them;
and they perceived, that the most considerable of the
prelates, as well as all the inferior clergy, professed the
highest approbation of their cause. Besides, that these
men were seized with the national passion for laws and
liberty; blessings, of which they themselves expected to
partake; there concurred very powerful causes to loosen
their devoted attachment to the apostolic see. It ap∣peared
from all the late usurpations of the Roman pon∣tiff,
that he pretended to reap alone all the advantages
accruing from that victory, which, under his banners,
tho' at their own hazard, they had every where obtained
over the civil magistrate. The Pope assumed a despotic
power over all the churches: Their particular customs,
privileges, and immunities, were treated with disdain:
Even, the canons of general councils were set aside by his
dispensing power: The whole administration of the
church was centered in the court of Rome: All preferments
ran of course in the same channel: And the pro∣vincial
clergy saw, at least felt, that there was a neces∣sity
of limiting these exorbitant pretensions. The legate,
Nicholas, in filling those numerous vacancies which had
fallen in England during an interdict of six years, had
proceeded in the most arbitrary manner; and had paid no
regard, in conferring dignities, to personal merit, to
rank, to the inclination of the electors, or to the customs
of the country. The English church was universally
disgusted; and Langton himself, tho' he owed his eleva∣tion
to an encroachment of the Romish see, was no
sooner established in his high office, than he became
jealous of the privileges annexed to it, and formed at∣tachments
with the country subjected to his jurisdiction.
These causes, tho' they opened slowly the eyes of men,
sailed not to produce their effect: They set bounds to
the usurpations of the papacy: The tide first stopped, and
<PB N="85" REF="96"/>
then turned against the sovereign pontiff: And it is
otherwise inconceivable, how that age, so prone to su∣perstition,
and so sunk in ignorance, or rather so de∣voted
to a spurious erudition, could have escaped falling
into an absolute and total slavery under the court of
Rome.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time that the Pope's letters arrived in Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrecti∣on of the barons.</NOTE>
the malcontent barons, on the approach of the
festival of Easter, when they were to expect the King's
answer to their petitions, met by agreement at Stamford;
and they assembled a force, consisting of above 2000
knights, besides their retainers and inferior persons with∣out
number. Elated with their power, they advanced in
a body to Brackley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th April.</NOTE> within fifteen miles of Oxford, the
place where the court then resided; and they there re∣ceived
a message from the King, by the archbishop of
Canterbury and the earl of Pembroke, desiring to know
what those liberties were which they so zealously chal∣lenged
from their sovereign. They delivered to these
messengers a schedule, containing the chief articles of
their demands; which was no sooner shown to the King,
than he burst into a furious passion, and asked, why the
barons did not also demand of him his kingdom? swear∣ing,
that he would never grant them such liberties as
must reduce himself to slavery<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 176. 71.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NO sooner were the confederated nobles informed of
John's refusal, than they choose Robert Fitz-Walter for
general, whom they called <HI>the Mareschal of the army of
God and of holy church;</HI> and they proceeded without far∣ther
ceremony to make war upon the King. They be∣sieged
the castle of Northampton during fifteen days,
tho' without success<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 177. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 71.</NOTE>: The gates of Bedford castle were
<PB N="86" REF="97"/>
willingly opened to them by William Beauchamp, its
owner: They advanced to Ware in their way to Lon∣don,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th May.</NOTE>
where they held a correspondence with the princi∣pal
citizens: They were received without opposition into
that capital: And finding now the great superiority of
their force, they issued out proclamations, requiring the
other barons to join them, and menacing them, in case
sf refusal or delay, with committing devastation on their
houses and estates<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 177.</NOTE>. In order to show them what they
might expect from their prosperous arms, they made in∣cursions
from London, and laid waste the King's parks
and palaces; and all the barons, who had hitherto carried
the semblance of supporting the royal party, were
glad of this pretence to join openly a cause, which they
always had secretly favoured. The King was left at
Odiham in Surrey with a poor retinue of only seven
knights; and after trying several expedients to elude the
blow, after offering to refer all differences to the Pope
alone, or to eight barons, four to be chosen by himfelf,
and four by the confederates<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 200.</NOTE>, he found himself at last
obliged to submit at discretion.</P>
<P>A CONFERENCE between,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magna Charta. 15th June.</NOTE> the King and the barons
was appointed at Runnemede,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th June▪</NOTE> between Windsor and
Staines; a place which has ever since been extremely
celebrated, on account of this great event. The two
parties encamped apart, like open enemies; and after a
debate of a few days, the King, with a facility which
was somewhat suspicious, signed and sealed the charter
which was required of him. This famous deed, com∣monly
called the GREAT CHARTER, either granted or
secured very important liberties and privileges to every
order of men in the kingdom, to the clergy, to the ba∣rons,
and to the people.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98"/>
THE freedom of elections was secured to the clergy:
The former charter of the King was confirmed, by
which the necessity of a royal congé d'elire and confir∣mation
was superseded: All check upon appeals to Rome
was removed, by the allowance granted every man to
depart the kingdom at pleasure: And the fines upon the
clergy, for any offence, were ordained to be proportio∣nal
to their lay estates, not to their ecclesiastical be∣nefices.</P>
<P>THE privileges granted to the barons were either a∣batements
in the rigors of the feudal law, or determina∣tions
in points which had been left by that law, or had
become by practice, arbitrary and ambiguous. The re∣liefs
of heirs succeeding to a military fee were ascertained;
an earl's and baron's at an hundred marks, a knight's at
an hundred shillings. It was ordained by the charter,
that, if the heir be a minor, he shall, immediately up∣on
his majority, enter upon his estate, without paying
any relief: The King shall not sell his wardship: He
shall levy only reasonable profits upon the estate, with∣out
committing waste or hurting the property: He shall
uphold the castles, houses, mills, parks and ponds: And
if he commit the guardianship of the estate to the she∣riff
or any other, he shall previously oblige them to find
surety to the same purpose. During the minority of a
baron, while his lands are in wardship, and are not in
his own possession, no debt which he owes to the Jews
shall bear any interest. Heirs shall be married with∣out
disparagement; and before the marriage be con∣tracted,
the nearest relations of the persons shall be in∣formed
of it. A widow, without paying any relief,
shall enter upon her dower, the third part of her hus∣band's
rents: She shall not be compelled to marry, so
long as she chuses to continue single; she shall only
give security never to marry without her lord's consent.

<PB N="88" REF="101"/>
The King shall not claim the wardship of any minor
who holds lands by military tenure of a baron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI.</NOTE> on pre∣tence
that he also holds lands of the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1215.</NOTE> by soccage
or any other tenure. Scutages shall be estimated at the
same rate as in the time of Henry I.; and no scutage or
aid, except in the three general feudal cases, the King's
captivity, the knighting his eldest son, and the marrying
his eldest daughter, shall be imposed but by the great
council of the kingdom; the prelates, earls and great
barons, shall be called to this great council, each by a
particular writ; the lesser barons by a general summons
of the sheriff. The King shall not seize any baron's
land for a debt to the crown, if the baron possesses as
many goods and chattels as are sufficient to discharge
that debt. No man shall be obliged to perform, more
service, for his fee than he is bound to by his tenure.
No governor or constable of a castle shall oblige any
knight to give money for castle-guard, if he is willing
to perform the service in person, or by another able∣bodied
man; and if the knight be in the field himself, by
the King's command, he shall be exempt from all other
service of this nature. No vassal shall be allowed to sell
so much of his land as to incapacitate himself from per∣forming
his service to his lord.</P>
<P>THESE were the principal articles, which were cal∣culated
for the interests of the barons; and had the
charter contained nothing farther, national happiness
and liberty had been very little promoted by it, as it
would only have tended to increase the power and in∣dependance
of an order of men, who were already too
powerful, and whose yoke might have become more
heavy on the people than even that of an absolute
monarch. But the barons, who alone drew and im∣posed
on the prince this memorable charter, were ne∣cessitated
to insert in it other clauses of a more ex∣tensive
<PB N="89" REF="102"/>
and more beneficent nature: They could not
expect the concurrence of the people, without com∣prehending,
together with their own, the interests of inferior ranks of
men; and all provisions, which the
barons, for their own sakes, were obliged to make, in
order to ensure the free and equitable administration of
justice, tended directly to the benefit of the whole
community. The following were the principal clauses
of this nature.</P>
<P>IT was ordained, that all the privileges and immu∣nities
above mentioned, granted to the barons against
the King, should be extended by the barons to their
inferior vassals. The king bound himself not to grant
any writ, empowering a baron to levy aids from his
vassals, except in the three feudal cases. One weight
and one measure shall be observed throughout the whole
kingdom. Merchants shall be allowed to transact all
business, without being exposed to any arbitrary tolls
and impositions: They and all free men shall be al∣lowed
to go out of the kingdom and return to it at
pleasure. London, and all cities and burghs, shall pre∣serve
their antient: liberties, immunities and free cus∣toms:
Aids shall not be required of them but by the
consent of the great council. No towns nor indivi∣duals
shall be obliged to make or support bridges but
by antient custom. The goods of every free man
shall be disposed of according to his will: If he die
intestate, his heirs shall succeed to them. No officer
of the crown shall take any horses, carts, or wood,
without the consent of the owner. The King's courts
of justice shall be stationary, and shall no longer fol∣low
his person: They shall be open to every one;
and justice shall no longer be bought, refused, or de∣layed
by them. The sheriffs shall be incapacitated to
hold pleas of the crown; and shall not put any person
<PB N="90" REF="103"/>
upon his trial, from rumour or suspicion alone, but upon
the evidence of lawful witnesses. No freeman shall be
taken or imprisoned, or dispossessed of his free tenement
and liberties, or outlawed, or banished, or any wise hurt
or injured, unless by the legal judgment of his peers, or
by the law of the land; and all who suffered otherwise in
this or the two former reigns, shall be restored to their
rights and possessions. Every freeman shall be fined in
proportion to his fault; and no fine shall be levied on
him to his utter ruin: Even a villain or rustic shall not
by any fine be bereaved of his carts, ploughs, and im∣plements
of husbandry. This was the only article cal∣culated
for the interests of this body of men, probably at
that time the most numerous in the kingdom.</P>
<P>IT must be confessed, that the former articles of the
Great Charter contain such mitigations and explanations
of the feudal law as are very reasonable and equitable;
and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a le∣gal
government, and provide for the equal distribution
of justice, and free enjoyment of property; the great ob∣jects
for which political society was at first founded by
men, which the people have a perpetual and unalienable
right to recall, and which no time, nor precedent, nor
statute, nor positive institution, ought to deter them
from keeping ever uppermost in their thoughts and atten∣tion.
Tho' the provisions made by this charter might,
conformable to the genius of the age, be esteemed too
concise, and too bare of circumstances, to maintain the
execution of its articles, in opposition to the chicanery
of lawyers, supported by the violence of power; time
gradually ascertained the sense of all the ambiguous ex∣pressions;
and those generous barons, who first extorted
this concession, still held their swords in their hands
and could turn them against those who dared, on an
pretence, to depart from the original spirit and meanin
<PB N="91" REF="104"/>
of the grant. It is now easy, from the tenor of this
charter, to determine what those laws were of King Ed∣ward,
which the English nation, during so many genera∣tions,
still desired, with such an obstinate perseverance,
to have recalled and established. They were these latter
articles of <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> and the barons, who, at the
beginning of these commotions, required the revival of
the Saxon laws, undoubtedly thought, that they had
sufficiently satisfied the people by procuring them this
concession, which comprehended the chief objects to
which they had so long aspired. But what we are most
to admire, is the prudence and moderation of these
haughty nobles themselves, who were enraged by injuries,
inflamed by opposition, and elated by a total victory over
their sovereign. They were contented, even in this
plenitude of power, to depart from some articles of Hen∣ry
I. 's charter, which they made the foundation of their
demands, particularly from the abolition of wardships,
so important a point; and they seem to have been suffi∣ciently
careful not to diminish too far the power and re∣venue
of the crown. If they appear, therefore, to have
carried other demands to too great a height, it can be
ascribed only to the faithless and tyrannical character of
the King himself, of which they had long had experi∣ence,
and which, they foresaw, would, if they provided
no farther security, lead him soon to infringe their liber∣ties,
and recall his own concessions. This alone gave
birth to those other articles, seemingly exorbitant, which
were added as a rampart for the safeguard of the Great Charter.</P>
<P>THE barons obliged the King to agree, that London
should remain in their hands, and the Tower be con∣signed
to the custody of the primate, till the 15th of Au∣gust
next, or till the execution of the several articles of
<PB N="92" REF="105"/>
the great charter<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 2d 1 r. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 73.</NOTE>. The better to insure the same end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1215</NOTE>
he allowed them to choose five and twenty members
from their own body, as conservators of the public liber∣ties;
and no bounds were set to the authority of these
men either in extent or duration. If any complaint was
made of a violation of the charter, whether by the King,
justiciaries, sheriffs, or foresters, any four of these barons
might admonish the King to redress the grievance; and
if satisfaction was not obtained, they could assemble the
whole council of twenty-five; who, in conjunction with
the great council, were empowered to compel him to ob∣serve
the charter, and, in case of resistance, might levy
war against him, attack his castles, and employ every
kind of violence, except against his royal person, and
that of this Queen and children. All men, throughout
the kingdom, were bound, under the penalty of confi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cation,
to swear obedience to the five and twenty ba∣rons;
and the freeholders of each county were to choose
twelve knights, who were to make report of such evil
customs as required redress, conformable to the tenor of
the Great Charter<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">This seems a certain proof that the house of commons was not then in being▪ otherwise the knights and burgesses, from the several counties could have given in to the lords a list of grievances, without any new election.</NOTE>. The names of these conservators
were the earls of Clare, Albemarle, Glocester, Win∣chester,
Hereford, Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, Ro∣bert
de Vere, earl of Oxford, William Mareschal the
younger, Robert Fitz-Walter, Gilbert de Clare, Eu∣stace

Malet, John Fitz-Robert, William de Lanvalay,
Hugh de Bigod, and Roger de Mountfichet<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 181.</NOTE>. Those
<PB N="93" REF="106"/>
men were, by this convention, really invested with the
sovereignty of the kingdom: They were rendered co-or∣dinate
with the King, or rather superior to him, in the
exercise of the executive power: And as there was no
circumstance of government, which, either directly or
indirectly, might, not bear a relation to the security or
observance of the great charter; there could scarce occur
any incident, in which they might not lawfully interpose
their authority.</P>
<P>JOHN seemed to submit passively to all these regula∣tions,
however injurious to majesty: He sent writs to all
the sheriffs, ordering them to constrain every one to
swear obedience to the twenty-five barons<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 182.</NOTE>: He dismiss∣ed
all his foreign forces: He pretended, that his govern∣ment
was henceforth to run in a new tenor, and to be
more indulgent to the liberty and independance of his
people. But he only dissembled, 'till he should find a
favourable opportunity of annulling all his concessions.
The injuries and indignities, which he had heretofore
suffered from the Pope and the King of France, as they
came from equals or superiors, seemed to make but small
impression on him: But the sense of this perpetual and
total subjection under his own rebellious vassals sunk deep
in his mind, and he was determined, at all hazards, to
throw off so ignominious a slavery<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 183.</NOTE>. He grew sullen,
silent, and reserved: He shunned the society of his
courtiers and nobles: He retired into the Isle of Wight,
as if desirous to hide his shame and confusion; but in
this retreat he meditated the most fatal vengeance against
all his enemies<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 183</NOTE>. He secretly sent abroad his emissaries
to inlist foreign soldiers, and to invite the rapacious Bra∣ban<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons
into his service, by the prospect of sharing the
spoils of England, and reaping the forfeitures of so many
<PB N="94" REF="107"/>
opulent barons, who had incurred the guilt of rebellion,
by rising in arms against him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 183. Chron. Dunst. vol. i, p. 72. Chron. Mai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. p. 188.</NOTE>. And he dispatched a
messenger to Rome, in order to lay before the Pope the
great charter, which he had been compelled to sign, and
to complain, before that tribunal, of the violence, which
had been imposed upon him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 183. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 73.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INNOCENT, considering himself as feudal lord of the
kingdom, was incensed at the temerity of the barons,
who, tho' they pretended to appeal to his authority, had
dared, without waiting for his consent, to impose such
terms on a prince, who, by resigning to the Roman pon∣tiff
his crown and independance, had placed himself im∣mediately
under the papal protection. He issued, there∣fore,
a bull, in which, from the plenitude of his aposto∣lic
power, and from the authority, which God had com∣mitted
to him, to build and destroy kingdoms, to plant
and overthrow, he annulled and vacated the whole char∣ter,
as unjust in itself, as obtained by compulsion, and as
derogatory to the dignity of the apostolic see. He prohi∣bited
the barons to exact the observance of it: He even
prohibited the King himself to pay any regard to it: He
absolved him and his subjects from all oaths, which they
had been constrained to take to that purpose: And he de∣nounced
a general sentence of excommunication against
every one, who should persevere in maintaining such
treasonable and iniquitous pretensions<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 203, 204, 205, 208. M. Paris, p. 184, 185, 187.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Renewal of the civil wars.</NOTE> as his foreign forces arrived along with
this bull, now ventured to take off the mask; and, un∣der
sanction of the Pope's decree, recalled all the liber∣ties,
which he had granted to his subjects, and which he
had solemnly sworn to observe. But the spiritual wea∣pon
<PB N="95" REF="108"/>
was found upon trial to carry less force with it, than he
had reason from his own experience to apprehend.
The primate refused to obey the Pope in publicshing the
sentence of excommunication against the barons; and
tho' he was cited to Rome, that he might attend a gene∣ral
council, there assembled, and was suspended, on ac∣count
of his disobedience to the Pope, and his secret cor∣respondence
with the King's enemies<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 189.</NOTE>: Tho' a
new and particular sentence of excommunication was de∣nounced
by name against the principal barons<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 211. M. Paris, p. 192.</NOTE>; John
still found, that his nobility and people, and even his
clergy, adhered to the defence of their liberties, and to
their combination against him: The sword of his foreign
mercenaries was all he had to trust to for the restoration
of his authority.</P>
<P>THE barons, after obtaining the great charter, seem
to have been lulled into a fatal security, and to have ta∣ken
no rational measures, in case of the introduction of
a foreign force, for re-assembling their armies. The
King was from the first matter of the field; and imme∣diately
laid siege to the castle of Rochester, which was

with the resistance, intended to have hanged the govern∣or

William de Mauleon, who suggested to him the danger

manner, the inferior prisoners only<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 187.</NOTE>. The cap∣tivity
of William de Albiney, the best officer among the
confederated barons, was an irreparable loss to their
cause; and no regular opposition was thenceforth made
to the progress of the royal arms. The ravenous and
<PB N="96" REF="109"/>
barbarous mercenaries, incited by a cruel and inraged
prince, were let loose against the estates, tenants, ma∣nors,
houses, parks of the barons, and spread devasta∣tion
over the face of the kingdom. Nothing was seen
but the flames of villages and castles reduced to ashes,
the consternation and misery of the inhabitants, tortures
exercised by the soldiery to make them reveal their con∣cealed
treasures<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 190. Ann. Waverl. p. 181. M. West. p. 274, 275.</NOTE>, and reprizals no less barbarous, com∣mitted
by the barons and their partizans on the royal de∣mesnes,
and on the estates of such as still adhered to the crown<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 190. W. Heming. p. 558.</NOTE>. The King marching thro' the whole extent of
England, from Dover to Berwick, laid the provinces
waste on each side of him; and considered every estate,
which was not his immediate property, as entirely hostile
and the object of military execution. The nobility of
the north in particular, who had shown greatest violence
in the recovery of their liberties, and who, acting in a
separate body, had expressed their discontent even at the
concessions made by the great charter; as they could ex∣pect
no mercy, fled before him with their wives and fa∣milies,
and purchased the friendship of Alexander, the
young King of Scots, by doing homage to him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 190. Heming. p. 558.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE barons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Lewis called over.</NOTE> reduced to this desperate extremity, and
menaced with the total loss of their liberties, their pro∣perties,
and their lives, employed a remedy no less des∣perate;
and making applications to the court of France,
offered to acknowledge Lewis, the eldest son of Philip,
for their sovereign; on condition, that he afforded them
protection from the violence of their enraged prince<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 274. Knyghton, p. 2423.</NOTE>.
Tho' the sense of the common rights of mankind, the
only rights which are entirely indefeasible, might have
<PB N="97" REF="110"/>
justified them in their deposition of the King; they de∣clined
insisting before Philip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1216.</NOTE> on a pretension, which is
commonly so unfavourable among sovereigns, and which
is sounds harshly in their royal ears. They affirmed, that
John was incapable of succeeding to the crown, by rea∣son
of the attainder, passed upon him during his brother's
reign; tho' that attainder had been reversed, and Rich∣ard
had even, by his last will, declared him his successor.
They pretended, that he was already legally deposed by sentence
of the peers of France, on account of the mur∣der
of his nephew; tho' that sentence could not possibly
regard any thing but his transmarine dominions, which
alone he held in homage to that crown. On more plau∣sible
grounds, they affirmed, that he had already deposed
himself by doing homage to the Pope, changing the na∣ture
of his sovereignty, and resigning an independant
crown for a fee or vassalage under a foreign power. And
as Blanche of Castille, the wife of Lewis, was descend∣ed
by her mother from Henry II. they maintained, tho'
many other princes stood before her in the order of suc∣cession,
that they had not shaken off the royal family in
choosing her husband for their sovereign.</P>
<P>PHILIP was extremely tempted to lay hold of the rich
prize which was offered to him. The Pope's legate me∣naced
him with interdicts and excommunications, if he
invaded the patrimony of St. Peter, or attacked a prince,
who was under the immediate protection of the holy
see<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 194. M. West. p. 275.</NOTE>; but as Philip was assured of the obedience of his
own vassals, his principles were changed with the con∣junctures
of the times, and he now undervalued as much
all papal censures, as he formerly pretended to pay re∣spect
to them. His chief scruple was with regard to the
fidelity, which he might expect of the English barons in
their new engagements, and the danger of entrusting his
<PB N="98" REF="111"/>
son and heir into the hands of men, who might, on any
caprice or necessity, make peace with their native sove∣reign,
by sacrificing a pledge of so much value. He
therefore exacted from the barons twenty-five hostages
of the most noble birth in the kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 193. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 74.</NOTE>; and having
obtained this security, he first sent over a small army to
the relief of the confederates, and then more numer∣ous
forces, who arrived with Lewis himself at their head.</P>
<P>THE first effect of the young prince's appearance in
England was the desertion of John's foreign troops,
who, being mostly levied in Flanders, and other provin∣ces
of France, refused to serve against the heir of their
monarchy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 195.</NOTE>. The Gascons and Poictevins alone, who
were still John's subjects, adhered to his cause; but they
were too weak to maintain that superiority in the field,
which they had hitherto supported against the confede∣rated
barons. Many considerable noblemen deserted
John's party, the earls of Salisbury, Arundel, War∣renne,
Oxford, Albemarle, and William Mareschal the
younger: His castles fell daily into the hands of the ene∣my:
Dover was the only place, which, from the valour
and fidelity of Hubert de Burgh, the governor, made re∣sistance
to the progress of Lewis's arms<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 198. Chron. Dunst vol. i, p. 75, 76.</NOTE>: And the ba∣rons
had the melancholy prospect of finally succeeding in their purpose, and of escaping the tyranny of their own
King, by imposing on themselves and the nation a fo∣reign
yoke. But this union was of very short duration
between the French and English nobles; and the impru∣dence
of Lewis, who on every occasion showed too vi∣sible
a preference to the former, encreased that jealousy,
which it was so natural for the latter to entertain in their
<PB N="99" REF="112"/>
present situation<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 559.</NOTE>. The viscount of Melun, too, it is
said, one of his courtiers, fell sick at London, and find∣ing
the approaches of death, he sent for some of his
friends among the English barons, and warning them of
their danger, revealed Lewis's secret intentions of exter∣minating
them and their families as traitors to their
prince, and bestowing their estates and dignities on his
native subjects, in whose fidelity he could more reason∣ably
place confidence<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 199. M. West. p. 277.</NOTE>. This story, whether true or
false, was universally reported and believed; and concur∣ring
with other circumstances, which rendered it cre∣dible,
did an infinite prejudice to Lewis's cause. The
earl of Salisbury and other noblemen deserted again to
John's party<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. p. 78.</NOTE>; and as men easily change sides in a civil
war, especially where their power is founded on an he∣reditary
and independant authority, and is not derived
from the opinion and favour of the people, the French
prince had reason to dread a sudden reverse of fortune.
The King was assembling a considerable army, with a
view of fighting one great battle for his crown; but
passing from Lynne to Lincolnshire, his road lay along
the sea-shore, which was overflowed at high water; and
not choosing the proper time for his journey, he lost in
the inundation all his carriages, treasure, baggage, and
regalia. The affliction of this disaster, and the vexation
from the distracted state of his affairs, encreased the sick∣ness,
under which he then laboured; and tho' he reach∣ed
the castle of Newark, he was obliged to halt there,
and his distemper soon after put an end to his life, in the
forty-ninth year of his reign;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE> and freed the nation from
the dangers, to which it was equally exposed, by his
success or his misfortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="113"/>
THE character of this prince is nothing but a compli∣cation
of vices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and character of the King.</NOTE> equally mean and odious; ruinous to
himself, and destructive to his people. Cowardice, in∣activity,
folly, levity, licentiousness, ingratitude, trea∣chery,
tyranny, and cruelty; all these qualities appear
too evidently in the several incidents of his life to give
us room to suspect, that the disagreeable picture has been
anywise overcharged by the prejudice of the antient histo∣rians.
It is hard to say, whether his conduct to his fa∣ther,
his brother, his nephew, or his subjects was most
culpable; or whether his crimes in these respects were
not even exceeded by the baseness, which appeared in
his transactions with the King of France, the Pope, and
the barons. His dominions, when they devolved to him
by the death of his brother, were more extensive than
have, ever since his time, been ruled by any English
monarch: But he first lost by his misconduct the flou∣rishing
provinces in France, the antient patrimony of his
family: He subjected his kingdom to a shameful vassalage
under the see of Rome: He saw the prerogatives of his
crown diminished by law, and still more reduced by fac∣tion:
And he died at last, when in danger of being to∣tally
expelled by a foreign power, and of either ending
his life miserably in prison, or seeking shelter as a fugi∣tive
from the pursuit of his enemies.</P>
<P>THE prejudices against this prince were so violent,
that he was believed to have sent an embassy to the Mi∣ramoulin
or Emperor of Morocco, and to have offered
to change his religion and become Mahometan, in order
to purchase the protection of that monarch. But tho'
that story is told us, on plausible authority, by Matthew
Paris<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 169.</NOTE>, it is in itself utterly improbable; except, that
there is nothing so incredible as may not become likely
from the folly and wickedness of John.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="114"/>
THE monks throw great reproaches on this prince for
his impiety and even infidelity; and as an instance of it,
they tell us, that having, one day, caught a very fat
stag, he exclaimed, <HI>How plump and well fed is this ani∣mael;
and yet I dare swear he never heard mass</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>70.</NOTE>. This
sally of wit, upon the usual corpulency of the priests,
more than all his enormous crimes and iniquities, made
him pass with them for an atheist.</P>
<P>JOHN left two legitimate sons behind him, Henry,
born on the first of October, 1207, and now nine years
of age; and Richard, born on the sixth of January,
1209; and three daughters, Jane married to Alexander
King of Scots; Eleanor married first to William Mare∣chal
younger, earl of Pembroke, and then to Simon
Mountfort, earl of Leicester; and Isabella married to the
Emperor, Frederic II. All these children were born to
him by Isabella of Angoulesme, his second wife. His
illegitimate children were numerous; but none of them
were any wise distinguished.</P>

<P>THE feudal law is the chief foundation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appendix II.</NOTE> both of
the political government and of the jurisprudence,

therefore requires, that we should form a just idea of
this law, in order to explain the state, as well of that

which, during those, ages, were governed by similar in∣stitutions.
And tho' I am sensible, that I must here re∣peat

in this place, to deliver a short plan of that prodi∣gious
fabric, which, for several centuries preserved such
a mixture of liberty and oppression, order and anarchy,
stability and revolution, as was never experienced in any
other age or any other part of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="116"/>
AFTER the northern nations subdued the provinces of
the Roman empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the feudal law.</NOTE> they were obliged to establish a
system of government, which might secure their con∣quests,
as well against the revolt of their numerous sub∣jects,
who remained in the provinces, as from the inroads
of other tribes, who might be tempted to ravish from
them their new acquisitions. The great change of cir∣cumstances
made them here depart from those institutions,
which prevailed among them, while they remained in
the forests of Germany; yet was it still natural for them
to retain, in their present settlement, as much of their
antient customs as was compatible with their new situa∣tion.</P>
<P>THE German governments, being more a confederacy
of independant warriors, than a civil subjection, derived
their principal force from many inferior and voluntary
associations, which individuals formed under a particu∣lar
head or chieftain, and which it became the highest
point of honour to maintain with inviolable fidelity. The
glory of the chieftain consisted in the number, the bra∣very,
and the zealous attachment of his retainers: The
duty of the retainers required that they should accom∣pany
their chieftain in all wars and dangers, that they
should fight and perish by his side, and that they should
esteem his renown or his favour a sufficient recompence
for all their services<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Tacit. de Mor. Germ.</NOTE>. The prince himself was nothing
but a great chieftain, who was chosen from among the
rest, on account of his superior valour or nobility; and
who derived his power from the voluntary association or
attachment of the other chieftains.</P>
<P>WHEN a tribe, governed by those ideas, and actuated
by those principles, subdued a large territory, they found,
that tho' it was necessary to keep themselves in a mili∣tary
<PB N="104" REF="117"/>
posture, they could neither remain united in a body,
nor take up their quarters in several garrisons, and that
their manners and institutions debarred them from using
those expedients; the obvious ones, which, in a like si∣tuation,
would have been employed by a civilized nation.
Their ignorance in the art of finances, and perhaps the
devastations inseparable from such violent conquests, ren∣dered
it impracticable for them to levy taxes sufficient for
the pay of numerous armies; and their repugnance to a
slavish subordination, with their attachment to rural plea∣sures,
made the life of the camp or garrison, if perpe∣tuated
during peaceful times, extremely odious and dis∣gustful
to them. They seized, therefore, such a propor∣tion
of the conquered lands as appeared necessary; they
assigned a share for supporting the dignity of their prince
and government; they distributed other parts, under the
title of fiefs, to the chieftains; these made a new parti∣tion
among their retainers; the express condition of all
these grants was, that they might be resumed at pleasure,
and that the possessor, so long as he enjoyed them, should
still remain in readiness to take the field for the defence
of the nation. And tho' the conquerors immediately se∣parated,
in order to enjoy their new acquisitions, their
martial disposition made them readily fulfil the terms of
their engagement: They assembled on the first alarm;
their habitual attachment to the chieftain made them wil∣lingly
submit to his command; and thus a regular mili∣tary
force, tho' concealed, lay always ready, to defend,
on any emergence, the interest and honour of the com∣munity.</P>
<P>WE are not to imagine, that all or even the greatest
part of the conquered lands was seized by. the northern
conquerors; or that the whole of the land thus seized
was subjected to these military services. This supposi∣tion
is confuted by the history of all the nations on the
<PB N="105" REF="118"/>
continent. Even the idea given us of the German man∣ners
by the Roman historian, may convince us, that that
bold people would never have been contented with so
precarious a subsistence, or have fought to procure esta∣blishments,
which were only to continue during the
good pleasure of their sovereign. Tho' the northern
chie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tains accepted of lands, which, being considered as
a kind of military-pay, might be resumed at the will of
the King or general; they also took possession of estates,
which, being hereditary and independant, enabled them
to maintain their native liberty, and support, without
court-favour, the honour of their rank and family.</P>
<P>BUT there is a great difference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the feudal∣law.</NOTE> in the consequences,
between the distribution of a pecuniary subsistence, and
the assignment of lands burdened with the condition of
military service. The delivery of the former at the
weekly, monthly, or annual terms of payment, still re∣calls
the idea of a voluntary gratuity from the prince,
and reminds the soldier of the precarious tenure by which
he holds his commission. But the attachment naturally
formed with a fixed portion of land, gradually begets
the idea of something like property, and makes the pos∣sessor
forget his dependant situation, and the condition
which was at first annexed to the grant. It seemed equi∣table,
that one who had cultivated and sowed a field,
should reap the harvest: Hence fiefs, which were at first
entirely precarious, were soon made annual. A man,
who had employed his money in building, planting, or
other improvements, expected to reap the fruits of his
labour or expence: Hence they were next granted
during a term of years. It would be thought hard to
expel a man from his possessions, who had always done
his duty, and performed the conditions on which he ori∣ginally
received them: Hence the chieftains, in a sub∣sequent
period, thought themselves entitled to demand
<PB N="106" REF="119"/>
the enjoyment of their feudal lands during life. It was
found, that a man would, in battle, hazard his life more
willingly, if assured, that his family should inherit his
possessions, and should not be exposed by his death to
want and poverty: Hence fiefs were made hereditary in
families, and descended, during one age, to the son;
then to the grandson, next to the brothers, and after∣wards
to more distant relations<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Lib. Feud. Lib. 1. tit. 1.</NOTE>. The idea of property
stole in gradually upon that of military pay; and each
century made some sensible addition to the stability of
fiefs and tenures.</P>
<P>IN all these successive acquisitions, the chieftain was
supported by his vassals; who, having originally a strong
connexion with him, augmented by the constant inter∣course
of good offices, and by the friendships arising from
neighbourhood and dependance, were inclined to follow
their leader against all his enemies, and voluntarily, in
his private quarrels, pay him the same obedience, to
which by their tenure they were bound in foreign wars.
While he daily advanced new pretensions to secure the
possession of his superior fief, they expected to find the
same advantage in acquiring stability to their subordinate
ones; and they zealously opposed the intrusion of a new
lord, who would be inclined, as he was fully intitled,
to bestow the possession of their lands on his own fa∣vourites
and retainers. The authority of the sovereign
gradually decayed; and the nobles, fortified each in his
own territory by the attachment of his vassals, became
too powerful to be expelled by an order from the throne;
and he secured by law what he had at first acquired by
usurpation.</P>
<P>DURING this precarious state of the supreme power, a
difference would immediately be experienced between
those portions of territory which were subjected to the
<PB N="107" REF="120"/>
feudal tenures, and those which were possessed by an al∣lodial
or free title. Tho' the latter possessions had at
first been esteemed infinitely preferable, they were soon
found, by the progressive changes introduced into public
and private law, to be of a much inferior condition to
the former. The possessors of a feudal territory, united
by a regular subordination under one chieftain, and by
the mutual attachments of the vassals, had the same ad∣vantages
over the proprietors of the other, which a dis∣ciplined
army enjoys over a dispersed multitude; and
were enabled to commit with impunity all injuries on
their defenceless neighbours. Every one, therefore,
hastened to seek that protection which he found so ne∣cessary;
and each allodial proprietor, resigning his pos∣sessions
into the hands of the King, or of some noble∣man
respected for power or valour, received them back
with the condition of feudal services<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Marculf. Form. 47. apud Lindenbr. p. 1238.</NOTE>, which, tho' a
burden somewhat grievous, brought him ample compen∣sation,
by connecting him with the neighbouring pro∣prietors,
and placing him under the guardianship of a
potent chieftain. The decay of the political government
thus necessarily occasioned the extension of the feudal:
The kingdoms of Europe were universally divided into
baronies, and these into inferior fiefs: And the attach∣ment
of vassals to their chieftain, which was at first an
essential part of the German manners, was still supported
by the same causes from which it at first arose; the ne∣cessity
of mutual protection, and the continued inter∣course,
between the head and the members, of benefits and services.</P>
<P>BUT there was another circumstance, which corrobo∣rated
these feudal dependancies, and tended to connect
the vassals with their superior lord by an indissoluble
bond of union. The northern conquerors, as well as

<PB N="107" REF="122"/>

<PB N="108" REF="123"/>
more early Greeks and Romans, embraced a policy;
which is unavoidable to all nations that have made slen∣der
advances in refinement; and they every where united
the civil jurisdiction with the military power. Law, in
its commencement, was not an intricate science, and
was more governed by maxims of equity, which seem
obvious to common sense, than by numerous and subtile
principles, applied to a variety of cases by profound rea∣sonings
from analogy. An officer, tho' he had passed
his life in the field, was able to determine all legal con∣troversies
which could occur within the district committed
to his charge; and his decisions were the most likely to
meet with a prompt and ready obedience, from men who
respected his person, and were accustomed to act under
his command. The profit arising from punishments,
which were then chiefly pecuniary, was another reason
for his desiring to retain the judicial power; and when his
fief became hereditary, this authority, which was essential
to it, was also transmitted to his posterity. The counts
and other magistrates, whose power was merely official,
were tempted, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> feudal lords, whom
they resembled in so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, to render their
dignity perpetual and he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>itary; and in the decline of
the regal power, they found no difficulty to make good
their pretensions. After this manner, the vast fabric of
feudal subordination became quite solid and comprehen∣sive;
it formed every where an essential part of the poli∣tical
constitution; and the Norman and other barons,
who followed the fortunes of William, were so accus∣tomed
to it, that they could scarce form an idea of any
other species of civil government<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">The ideas of the feudal government were so rooted, that even lawyers, in those ages, could not form a notion of any other constitu∣tion. <HI>Regnum,</HI> (says Bracton, lib. 2. cap▪ 34.) <HI>quod ex comitatibus &amp; baronibus dicitur ess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> constitutum.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

THE Saxons, who conquered England, as they exter∣minated
the antient inhabitants, and were secured by the
sea against new invaders, found it less requisite to main∣tain
themselves in a military posture; and the quantity
of land which they annexed to offices, seems to have
been of small value; and for that reason continued the
longer in its original situation, and was always possessed
during pleasure by those entrusted with the command.
These conditions were too precarious to satisfy the Nor∣man
chieftains, who enjoyed more independant possessi∣ons
and jurisdictions in their own country; and Wil∣liam
was obliged, in the new distribution of land, to
copy the tenures, which were now become universal on
the continent. England of a sudden became a feudal
kingdom<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Coke Comm. on Lit. p. 1, 2. ad sect. 1.</NOTE>; and received all the advantages, and was
exposed to all the inconveniences, incident to that species
of civil polity.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the principles of the feudal law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The feudal govern∣ment of England.</NOTE> the
King was the supreme lord of the landed property; and
all possessors, who enjoyed the fruits or revenue of any
part of it, held these privileges, either mediately or im∣mediately,
of him; and their property was conceived to
be, in some degree, conditional<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of Gaveik. p. 109. Smith de Rep. lib, 3 cap. 10.</NOTE>. The land was still
apprehended to be a species of <HI>benefice,</HI> which was the
original conception of a feudal property; and the vassal
owed, in return for it, stated services to his baron, as
the baron himself did for his land to the crown. The
vassal was obliged to defend his baron in war; and the
baron, at the head of his vassals, was bound to fight in
defence of the King and kingdom. But besides these
military services, which were casual, there were others
imposed of a civil nature, which were more constant and
perpetual.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="125"/>
THE northern nations had no idea, that any man,
trained up to honour, or enured to arms, was ever to be
governed, without his own consent, by the absolute will
of another; or that the administration of justice was ever
to be exercised by the private opinion of any one
magistrate, without the concurrence of some other per∣sons,
whose interest might induce them to check his ar∣bitrary
and iniquitous decisions. The King, therefore,
when he found it necessary to demand any services
of his barons or chief tenants, beyond what was due
by their tenures, was obliged to assemble them, in order
to procure their <HI>consent:</HI> And when it was necessary to
determine any controversy among the barons themselves,
the question must be discussed in their presence, and be
decided according to their opinion or <HI>advice.</HI> In these
two circumstances of consent and advice, consisted chiefly
the civil services of the ancient barons; and these im∣plied
all the considerable incidents of governments. In
one view, the barons regarded, this attendance as their
principal <HI>privilege;</HI> in another, as a grievous <HI>burden.</HI>
That no momentous affairs could be transacted without
their consent and advice, was in <HI>general</HI> esteemed the
great security of their possessions and. dignities; but as
they reaped no immediate profit from their attendance at
court, and were exposed to great inconvenience and
charge by an absence from their own estates, every one
was glad to exempt himself from each <HI>particular</HI> exertion
of this power; and was pleased both that the call for
that duty should seldom return upon him, and that others
should undergo the burden in his stead. The King, on
the other hand, was usually anxious, for several rea∣sons,
that the assembly of the barons should be full
at every stated or casual time of meeting: This at∣tendance
was the chief badge of their subordination to
<PB N="111" REF="126"/>
his crown, and drew them from that independence
which they were apt to affect in their own castles
and manors; and where the meeting was thin or ill at∣tended,
its determinations had less authority, and were
not followed by so ready an obedience from the whole
community.</P>
<P>THE case was the same with the barons in their
courts as with the King in the supreme council of the
nation. It was requisite to assemble the vassals, in order
to determine by their vote any question which regarded
the barony; and they sat along with the chieftain in all
trials, whether civil or criminal, which occurred within
the limits of their jurisdiction. They were bound to
pay suit and service at the court of their baron; and as
their tenure was military, and consequently honour∣able,
they were admitted into his society, and partook
of his friendship. Thus, a kingdom was only consi∣dered
as a great barony, and a barony as a small king∣dom.
The barons were peers to each other in the na∣tional
council, and, in some degree, companions to the
King: The vassals were peers to each other in the court
of barony, and companions to their baron.<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Du Cange Gloss. in verb. <HI>Par.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ujac. Common. in Lib. F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ud. lib. I. tit. p. 18. Spelm. Gloss. in verb,</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this resemblance so far took place, the vas∣sals,
by the natural course of things, universally, in the
feudal constitutions, fell into a greater subordination un∣der
the baron, than the baron himself under his sove∣reign;
and these governments had a necessary and infal∣lible
tendency to augment the power of the nobles.
The great chieftain, residing in his country-seat or castle,
which he was commonly allowed to fortify, lost, in a
great measure, his connexion or acquaintance with the
prince; and added every day new force to his autho∣rity
<PB N="112" REF="127"/>
over the vassals of the barony. They received from
him education in all military exercises: His hospitality
invited them to live and enjoy society in his hall: Their
leisure, which was great, made them perpetual retainers
on his person, and partakers of his country sports and
amusements: They had no means of gratifying their
ambition but by making a figure in his train:
His favour and countenance was their greatest honour:
His displeasure exposed them to contempt and igno∣miny:
And they felt every moment the necessity of
his protection, both in the controversies which occur∣red
with other vassals, and what was more material,
in the daily inroads and injuries which were commit∣ted
by the neighbouring barons. During the time of
general war, the sovereign, who marched at the head
of his armies, and was the great protector of the state,
acquired always some accession to his authority, which
he lost during the intervals of peace and tranquillity:
But the loose police incident to the feudal constitu∣tions,
maintained a perpetual, tho' secret hostility, be∣tween
the several members of the state; and the vassals
found no other means of security against the injuries to.
which they were continually exposed, but by closely
adhering to their chieftain, and falling into a submis∣sive
dependance upon him.</P>
<P>IF the feudal government was so little favourable to
the true liberty even of the military vassal, it was still
more destructive of the independance and security of
the other members of the state, or what in a proper
sense we call the people. A great part of them were
<HI>serfs,</HI> and lived in state of absolute slavery or villainage:
The other inhabitants of the country paid their rent in
services which were in a great measure arbitrary, and
they could expect no redress of injuries in a court of
barony from men who thought they had a right to
<PB N="113" REF="128"/>
oppress and tyrannize over them: The towns were
situated either within the demesnes of the King, or
the lands of the great barons, and were almost en∣tirely
subjected to the absolute will of their master.
The languishing state of commerce kept the inhabi∣tants
poor and contemptible; and the political institu∣tions
were calculated to render that poverty perpe∣tual.
The barons and gentry, living in rustic plenty
and hospitality, gave no encouragement to the arts,
and had no demand for any of the more elaborate
produce of manufactures: Every profession was held
in contempt but that of arms: And if any merchant
or manufacturer rose by industry and frugality to a
degree of opulence, he found himself but the more
exposed to injuries, from the envy and avidity of the
military nobles.</P>
<P>THESE concurring causes gave the feudal govern∣ments
so strong a biass towards aristocracy, that the
royal authority was extremely eclipsed in all the Eu∣ropean
states; and, instead of dreading the growth of
monarchical power, we might rather expect, that the
community would every where crumble into so many
independent baronies, and lose the political union by
which they were cemented. In elective monarchies,
the event was commonly answerable to this expecta∣tion;
and the barons, gaining ground on every vacancy
of the throne, raised themselves almost to a state of
sovereignty, and sacrificed to their power both the
rights of the crown and the liberties of the people.
But hereditary monarchies had a principle of authority,
which was not so easily subverted; and there were se∣veral
causes, which still maintained a degree of influ∣ence
in the hands of the sovereign.</P>
<P>THE greatest baron could never lose view entirely
of those principles of the feudal constitution, which
<PB N="114" REF="129"/>
bound him, as a vassal, to submission and fidelity to∣wards
his prince; because he was every moment obliged
to have recourse to those principles, in exacting fidelity
and submission from his own vassals. The lesser barons,
finding that the annihilation of royal authority left them
exposed without protection to the insults and injuries of
more potent neighbours, naturally adhered to the crown,
and promoted the execution of general and equal laws.
The people had still a stronger interest to desire the
grandeur of the sovereign; and the King, being the le∣gal
magistrate, who suffered by every internal convul∣sion
or oppression, and who regarded the great nobles as
his immediate rivals, assumed the salutary office of ge∣neral
guardian or protector of the commons. Besides
the prerogatives with which the law endowed him; his
large demesnes and numerous retainers rendered him, in
one sense, the greatest baron of his kingdom; and where
he was possessed of personal vigor and ability (for his
situation required these advantages) he was commonly
able to preserve his authority, and maintain his station
as head of the community, and the chief fountain of
law and justice.</P>
<P>THE first Kings of the Norman race were favoured by
another circumstance, which preserved them from the en∣croachments
of their barons. They were generals of a
conquering army, which was obliged to continue in a
military posture, and to maintain great subordination
under their leader, in order to secure themselves from
the revolt of the numerous natives, whom they had be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaved
of all their properties and privileges. But tho'
this circumstance supported the authority of William
and his immediate successors, and rendered them ex∣tremely
absolute, it was lost as soon as the Norman ba∣rons
began to coalesce with the nation, to acquire a se∣curity
in their possessions, and to fix their influence
<PB N="115" REF="130"/>
over their vassals, tenants, and slaves. And the immense
fortunes, which the Conqueror had bestowed on his
chief captains, served to support their independancy, and
make them formidable to the sovereign.</P>
<P>HE gave, for instance, to Hugh de Abrincis, his sister's
son, the whole county of Chester, which he erected into
a palatinate, and rendered by his grant almost indepen∣dant
of the crown<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cambd. in Chesh. Spel. Gloss. in verb. <HI>Comes Palatinus.</HI></NOTE>. Robert earl of Mortaigne had 973

and jurisdictions, could not long be retained in the rank
of subjects. The great earl Warrenne, in a subsequent
<PB N="116" REF="131"/>
reign, when he was questioned concerning his right to
the lands which he possessed, drew his sword, which he
produced as his title; adding that William the Bastard
did not conquer the kingdom himself; but that the ba∣rons,
and his ancestor among the rest, were joint adven∣turers
in the enterprize<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Bar. vol. i. p. 79. Id, Origenes Juridiciales, p. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE supreme legislative power of England was lodged
in the King and great council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The feudal parliment.</NOTE> or what was afterwards
called the parliament. It is not doubted but the arch∣bishops,
bishops, and most considerable abbots were con∣stituent
members of this council. They sat by a double
title: By prescription, as having always possessed that
privilege, thro' the whole Saxon period, from the first
establishment of Christianity; and by their right of ba∣ronage,
as holding of the King <HI>in capite</HI> by military ser∣vice.
These two titles of the prelates were never accu∣rately
distinguished. When the usurpations of the church
had risen to such a height, as to make the bishops affect
a separate dominion, and regard their seat in parliament
as a degradation of their episcopal dignity; the King
insisted, that they were barons, and on that account,
obliged, by the general principles of the feudal law, to
attend on him in his great councils<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spel. Gloss. in verb. <HI>Bars.</HI></NOTE>. Yet there still re∣mained
some practices, which supposed their title to be
derived merely from antient possession: When a bishop
was elected, he sat in parliament before the King had
made him restitution of his temporalities; and during
the vacancy of a fee, the guardian of the spiritualities
was summoned to attend along with the bishops.</P>
<P>THE barons were another constituent part of the great
council of the nation. These held immediately of the
crown by a military tenure: They were the most honourable
members of the state, and had a <HI>right</HI> to be
<PB N="117" REF="132"/>
consulted in all public deliberations: They were the im∣mediate
vassals of the crown, and owed as a <HI>service</HI> their
attendance in the court of their supreme lord. A re∣solution,
taken, without their consent, was likely to be but
ill executed: And no determination of any cause or con∣troversy
among them had any validity, where the vote
and advice of the whole body did not concur. The dignity
of earl or count was official and territorial, as well
as hereditary; and as all the earls were also barons, they
were considered as military vassals of the crown, were
admitted in that capacity into the general council, and
formed the most honourable and powerful branch of it.</P>
<P>BUT there was another class of the immediate military
tenants of the crown, equally numerous with the barons,
the tenants <HI>in captite</HI> by knights service; and these, however
inferior in power or property, held by a tenure, which
was equally honourable as that of the others. A barony
was commonly composed of several knights fees: and
tho' the number seems not to have been exactly defined,
seldom consisted of less than forty hydes of land<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Four hydes made one knight's fee: The relief of a barony was twelve times greater than that of a knight's fee; whence we may con∣lecture its value. Spelm. Gloss. in verb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Feodum.</HI></NOTE>: But
where a man held of the King only one or two knights
fees, he was still an immediate vassal of the King, and
as such had a title to have a seat in the general councils.
But as this attendance was usually esteemed a burthen,
and one too great for a man of slender fortune to bear
constantly; it is probable, that tho' he had a title, if he
pleased, to be admitted, he was not obliged by any pe∣nalty,
like the barons, to pay a regular attendance. All
the immediate military tenants of the crown amounted
not fully to 700, when Domesday book was framed;
and as the members were well pleased, on any pretext,
to excuse themselves from attendance, the assembly was
<PB N="118" REF="133"/>
never likely on any occasion to become too numerous
for the dispatch of public business.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣mons.</NOTE></P>
<P>So far the nature of a general council or antient par∣liament
is determined without any doubt or controversy.
The only question seems to be with regard to the com∣mons,
or the representatives of counties and boroughs;
whether they were also, in more early times, constituent
parts of parliament? This question was once disputed in
England with great acrimony; but such is the force of
time and evidence, that they can sometimes prevail even
over faction, and the question seems, by general consent,
and even by their own, to be at last determined against
the ruling party. It is agreed that the commons were no
part of the great council, till some ages after the con∣quest;
and that the military tenants alone of the crown
composed that supreme and legislative assembly.</P>
<P>THE vassals of a baron were by, their tenure immedi∣ately
dependant on him, owed attendance at his court,
and paid all their duty to the King, thro' that depend∣ance
which their lord was obliged by <HI>his</HI> tenure to
acknowledge to his sovereign and superior. Their land,
comprehended in the barony, was represented in parlia∣ment
by the baron himself, who was supposed, accord∣ing
to the fictions of the feudal law, to possess the di∣rect
property of it; and it would have been deemed in∣congruous
to give it any other representation. They
stood in the same capacity to him, that he and the other
barons did to the King: The former were peers of the
barony; the latter were peers of the realm: The vassals
possessed a subordinate rank within their district; the
baron enjoyed a supreme dignity in the great assembly:
They were in some degree his companions at home; he
the King's companion in the court: And nothing can
be more evidently repugnant to all feudal ideas, and to
that gradual subordination, which was essential to those
<PB N="119" REF="134"/>
antient institutions, than to imagine that the King would
apply either for the advice or consent of men, who were
of a rank or order so much inferior, and whose duty was
immediately paid to the <HI>mesne</HI> lord, that was interposed
between them and the throne<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Gloss. in verb. <HI>Baro.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF it be unreasonable to think, that the vassals of a
barony, tho' their tenure was military and noble and
honourable, were ever summoned to give their opinion
in national councils; much less can it be supposed, that
the tradesmen or inhabitants of boroughs, whose con∣dition
was still so much inferior, would be admitted to
that privilege. It appears from Domesday, that the bo∣roughs
were, at the time of the conquest, scarce more
than country villages; and that the inhabitants lived in
entire dependance on the King or great lords, and were
of a station little better than servile<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Liber <HI>bomo</HI> antientiy signified a gentleman: For scar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e any one beside was entirely free. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pelm. Gloss. in verbo.</NOTE>. They were not
then so much as incorporated; they formed no commu∣nity;
were not regarded as a body politic; and being
really nothing but a number of low dependant tradesmen,
living, without any particular civil tie, in neighbour∣hood
together, were incapable of being represented in the
states of the kingdom. Even in France, a country,
which made more early advances in arts and civility than
England, the first corporation is sixty years posterior to
the conquest under the duke of Normandy; and the
erecting these communities was an invention of Lewis
the Gross to free the people from slavery under the lords,
and to give them protection, by means of certain privi∣leges
and a separate jurisdiction<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Du Cange's Gloss. in verb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>com∣mune, communitas.</HI></NOTE>. An antient French
author calls them a new and wicked device, to procure
liberty to slaves, and encourage them in shaking off the
<PB N="120" REF="135"/>
dominion of their masters<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Guibertus de vita sua, lib. 3. cap. 7</NOTE>. The famous charter, as it
is called, of the Conqueror to the city of London, tho'
granted at a time when he assumed the appearance of
gentleness and lenity, is nothing but a letter of protec∣tion,
and a declaration that the citizens should not be
treated as slaves<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Stat. of Merton, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>23 c, cap. 6</NOTE>. By the English feudal law, the su∣perior
lord was prohibited to marry his female ward
to a burgess or a villain<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Holingsned, vol. iii. p. 15</NOTE>.; so near were these two ranks es∣teemed
to each other, and so much inferior to the nobi∣lity
and gentry. Besides possessing the advantages of
birth, riches, civil powers and privileges; the nobles and
gentlemen alone were armed; a circumstance, which
gave them a mighty superiority, in an age when nothing
but the military profession was honourable, and when
the loose execution of laws gave so much encourage∣ment
to open violence, and rendered it so decisive in all
disputes and controversies<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Maclox's Baron. Angl. p. 19</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE great similarity among all the feudal govern∣ments
of Europe is well known to every man, that has
any acquaintance with antient history; and the antiqua∣rians
of all foreign countries, where the question was
never embarassed by party disputes, have allowed, that
the commons were very late in being admitted to a
share in the legislative power. In Normandy particularly,
whose constitution was most likely to be William's mo∣del
in raising his new fabric of the English government,
the states were entirely composed of the clergy and nobi∣lity;
and the first incorporated boroughs or communities
of that dutchy were Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en and Falaise, which enjoyed
their privileges by a grant of Philip Augustus in the
year 1207<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Norman. Du Chesnii, p. 1066. Da Cange Gloss. in verb. <HI>comu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI></NOTE>. All the antient English historians, when
<PB N="121" REF="136"/>
they mention the great council of the nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appendix II.</NOTE> call it
an assembly of the baronage, nobility or great men; and
none of their expressions, tho' several hundred passages
might be produced, can, without the utmost violence,
be tortured to a meaning, which will admit the com∣mons
to be constituent members of that body<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Sometimes the historians mention people, <HI>populus,</HI> as a part of the parliament: But they always mean the laity, in opposition to the clergy. Sometimes, the word, <HI>communitas,</HI> is found; but it always means <HI>communitas baronagii.</HI> These points are clearly proved by Dr. Brady.</NOTE> The
<HI>magna charta</HI> of King John provides, that no tax or scu∣tage
should be imposed but by the consent of the great
council; and for more security, it enumerates the persons
intitled to a feat in that council, the prelates and
immediate tenants of the crown, without any mention
of the commons: An authority so full, certain and ex∣plicite,
that nothing but the zeal of party could ever
have procured credit to any contrary system.</P>
<P>IT was probably the example of the French barons
which first emboldened the English to require greater in∣dependance
from their sovereign: It is also probable, that
the boroughs and corporations of England were established
in imitation of those of France. It may, there∣fore,
be proposed, as no unlikely conjecture, that both
the privileges of the peers and the liberty of the com∣mons
were originally the growth of that country.</P>
<P>IN antient times, men were very little solicitous to
obtain a place in the legislative assemblies; and rather
regarded their attendance as a burden, which was not
compenstated by any return of profit or honour, propor∣tioned
to the trouble and expence. The only reason of
instituting those public councils, was; on the part of
the subject, that they desored some security from the at∣tempts
of arbitrary power; and on the part of the soveregin,
<PB N="122" REF="137"/>
that he despaired of governing men of such in∣dependant
spirits without their own consent and concur∣rence.
But the commons, or the inhabitants of boroughs,
had not as yet reached such a degree of consideration, as
to desire <HI>security</HI> against their prince, or to imagine, that,
even if they were assembled in a representative body, they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad power or rank sufficient to enforce it. The only
protection, which they aspired to, was against the imme∣diate
violence and injustice of their fellow-citizens; and
this advantage each of them looked for, from the courts
of justice, or from the authority of some great lord, to
whom, by law or his own choice, he was attached. On
the other hand, the sovereign was sufficiently assured of
obedience in the whole community, if he procured the
concurrence of the nobles; nor had he reason to appre∣hend,
that any order of the state could resist his and their
united authority. The military sub-vassals could enter∣tain
no idea of opposing both their prince and their su∣periors:
The burgesses and tradesmen could much less
aspire to such a thought: And thus, even if history were
silent on that head, we have reason to conclude, from
the known situation of mankind during these ages, that
the commons were never admitted as members of the le∣gislative body.</P>
<P>THE <HI>executive</HI> power of the Anglo-Norman govern∣ment
was lodged in the King; and besides the stated
meetings of the national council at the three great festivals
of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Orig. Jurid. p. 15. Spel. Gloss. in verbo <HI>parliamentum.</HI></NOTE>, he was
accustomed, on any sudden exigence, to summon them
together. He could at his pleasure command the at∣tendance
of his barons and their vassals, in which con∣sisted
the military force of the kingdom; and could em∣ploy
them, during forty days, either in resisting a foreign
<PB N="123" REF="138"/>
enemy, or reducing his rebellious subjects.
And what was of great importance, the whole <HI>judicial</HI> power was
ultimately in his hands, and was exercised by officers and
ministers of his appointment.</P>
<P>THE general plan of the Anglo-Norman government
was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">judicial Power.</NOTE> that the court of barony was appointed to decide
such controversies as arose between the several vassals
or subjects of the same barony; the hundred-court
and county-court, which were still continued as
during the Saxon times<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sacra, vol. i. p. 334, &amp;c. Dugd. Orig. Jurid. p. 27. 29. Madox Hist. of Exch. p. 75, 76. Spelm. Gloss in verbo <HI>bundred.</HI></NOTE>, to judge between the
subjects of different baronies<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">None of the feudal governments in Europe had such institutions as the county courts, which the great authority of the Conqueror still retained from the Saxon customs. All the freeholders of the county, even the greatest barons, were obliged to attend the sheriffs in these courts, and to assist him in the administration of justice. By this means, they received frequent and sensible admonitions of their depen∣dance on the King or supreme magistrate: They formed a kind of com∣munity with their fellow barons and freeholders: They were often drawn from their individual and independant state, peculiar to the feu∣dal system; and were made members of a political body: And per∣haps, this institution of county-courts in England has had greater effects on the government, than has yet been distinctly pointed out by his∣torians or traced by antiquaries. The barons were never able to free themselves from this attendance on the sheriffs and itinerant justices till the reign of Henry III.</NOTE>; and the <HI>curia Regis</HI> or
King's court, to give sentence among the barons them∣selves<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Brady Pref. 43.</NOTE>.
But this plan, tho' simple, was attended with
some circumstances, which, being derived from a very
extensive authority, assumed by the Conqueror, contri∣buted
to the encrease of the royal prerogative; and while
the state was not disturbed by arms, reduced every order
of the community to some degree of dependance and subordination.</P>

Exchequer<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Madox. Hist. of the Exch. p. 56. 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH an accumulation of powers was itself a great
source of authority, and rendered the jurisdiction of the
court terrible to all the subjects; but the turn, which
judicial trials took soon after the Conquest, served still
more to encrease its authority, and to augment the royal
prerogatives. William, among the other violent changes,
which he attempted and effected, had introduced the
Norman law into England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Dial. de Scac. p. 30, apud Madox, Hist. of the Exchequer.</NOTE>, had ordered all pleadings
<PB N="125" REF="140"/>
to be in that tongue, and had interwoven with the Eng∣lish
jurisprudence, all the maxims and principles, which
the Normans, more advanced in cultivation, and natu∣rally
litigious, were accustomed to observe in the distri∣bution
of justice. Law now became a science, which at
first fell entirely into the hands of the Normans; and
which, even after it was communicated to the English,
required so much study and application, that the laity, in
those ignorant ages, were incapable of attaining it, and
it was a mystery almost solely confined to the clergy, and
chiefly to the monks<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Malmes. lib. 4. p. 123.</NOTE>. The great officers of the
crown and the feudal barons, who were military men,
found themselves unfit to penetrate into those obscurities;
and tho' they were intitled to a seat in the supreme judica∣ture,
the business of the court was wholly managed by
the chief justiciary and the law barons, who were men
appointed by the King, and entirely at his disposal<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Orig. Jurid. p. 25.</NOTE>. This
natural course of things was forwarded by the multipli∣city
of business, which flowed into that court, and
which daily augmented by the appeals from all the sub∣ordinate
judicatures of the kingdom.</P>
<P>IN the Saxon times, no appeal was received in the
King's court, except upon the denial or delay of justice
by the inferior courts; and the same practice was still
observed in most of the feudal kingdoms of Europe.
But the great power of the Conqueror established at first
in England an authority, which the monarchs in France
were not able to attain till the reign of St. Lewis, who
lived near two centuries after: He empowered his court
to receive appeals both from the courts of barony and the
county-courts, and by that means brought the adminis∣tration
of justice ultimately into the hands of the sove∣reign<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Madox. Hist. of the Exch. p. 65. Glanv. lib. 12. cap. 1. 7. LL. Hen. 1. § 3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. apud Wilkins, p. 248. Fitz-Stephens, p. 36. Coke's Comment. on the statute of Marlbridge, cap. 20.</NOTE>.
And lest the expence or trouble of a journey
<PB N="126" REF="141"/>
to court should discourage suitors, and make them ac∣quiesce
in the decision of the inferior judicatures, itine∣rant
judges were afterwards established, who made their
circuits thro' the kingdom, and tried all causes, that
were brought before them<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Madox. Hist, of the Exch. p. 83, 84. 100. Gerv. Dorob. p. 1410. What made the Anglo-Norman barons more readily submit to appeals from their court to the King's court of Exchequer, was their being accustomed to like appeals in Normandy to the ducal court of exchequer. See Gilbert's History of the exchequer, p. 1, 2.; tho' the author thinks it doubtful, whether the Norman court was not rather copied from the English, p. 6.</NOTE>. By this expedient, the
courts of barony were kept in awe, and if they still pre∣served
some influence, it was only from the apprehensi∣ons
which the vassals might entertain of disobliging their
superior, by appealing from his court. But the county∣courts
were much discredited; and as the freeholders
were found ignorant of the intricate principles and forms
of the new law, the lawyers gradually brought all bu∣siness
before the King's judges, and abandoned the an∣tient
simple and popular judicature. After this manner,
the formalities of justice, which, tho' they appear tedi∣ous
and cumbersome, are found requisite to the support
of liberty in all monarchical governments, proved at first,
by a combination of causes, very advantageous to the
royal authority in England.</P>
<P>THE power of the Norman kings was also much supported
by a great revenue;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revenue of the crown.</NOTE> and by a revenue, that was
fixed, perpetual, and independant of the subject. The
people, without betaking themselves to arms, had no
check upon the King, and no regular security for the due
distribution of justice. In those days of violence, ma∣ny
instances of oppression passed unheeded; and were
soon after openly pleaded as precedents, which it was
<PB N="127" REF="142"/>
unlawful to dispute or controul. Princes and ministers
were too ignorant to be themselves sensible of the advan∣tages
attending an equitable administration; and there
was no established council or assembly which could
protect the people, and, by withdrawing supplies, regu∣larly
and peaceably admonish the King of his duty, and
ensure the execution of the laws.</P>
<P>THE first, branch of the King's stated revenue was the
royal demesnes or crown-lands, which were very exten∣sive,
and comprehended, beside a great number of ma∣nors,
most of the chief cities of the kingdom. It was
established by law, that the King could alienate no part
of his demesne, and that he himself, or his successor,
could, at any time, resume such donations<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fleta, lib. 1. cap. 8, 17. lib. 3. cap. 6. § 3. Bracton, lib. 2. cap. 5.</NOTE>: But this
law was never regularly observed; which happily ren∣dered
in time the crown somewhat more dependant. The
rent of the crown-lands, considered merely as so much
riches, was a source of power: The influence of the
King over his tenants and the inhabitants of his towns,
increased this power: But the other numerous branches
of his revenue, besides supplying his treasury, gave, by
their very nature, a great latitude to arbitrary autho∣rity,
and were a support of the prerogative; as will
appear from an enumeration of them.</P>
<P>THE King was never content with the stated rents,
but levied heavy tailliages at pleasure on the inhabitants
both of town and country, who lived within his de∣mesne.
All bargains of sale, in order to prevent theft,
being prohibited, except in boroughs and public markets<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">LL. Will. 1. cap. 61.</NOTE>,
he pretended to exact tolls on all goods which were
there sold<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Madox, p. 530.</NOTE>. He seized two hogsheads, one before and
one behind the mast, from every vessel that imported
<PB N="128" REF="143"/>
wine. All goods paid to his customs a proportional part
of their value<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Madox, p. 529. This author says a fifteenth. But it is not easy to reconcile this account to other authorities.</NOTE>: Passage over bridges and on rivers was
loaded with tolls at pleasure<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Madox, p. 529.</NOTE>: And tho' the boroughs
by degrees bought the liberty of farming these impo∣sitions,
yet the revenue profited by these bargains, new
sums were often exacted for the renewal and confirma∣tion
of the privileges<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hist. of the Exch. p. 275, 276, 277, &amp;c.</NOTE>, and the people were thus held
in perpetual dependance.</P>
<P>SUCH was the situation of the inhabitants within the
royal demesnes. But the possessors of land, or the mi∣litary
tenants, tho' they were better protected, both
by law, and by the great privilege of carrying arms,
were, from the nature of their tenures, much exposed
to the inroads of power, and possessed not what we should
esteem in our age a very durable security. The Con∣queror
granted by his laws, that the barons should be
obliged to pay nothing beyond their stated services<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">LL. Will. Conq. § 55.</NOTE>,
except a reasonable aid to ransom his person if he were
taken in war, to make his eldest son a knight, and to
marry his eldest daughter. What should, on these oc∣casions,
be deemed a reasonable aid, was not deter∣mined;
and the demands of the crown were so far dis∣cretionary.</P>
<P>THE King could require in war the personal attend∣ance
of his vassals, that is, of all the landed proprie∣tors;
and if they declined the service, they were obliged
to pay him a composition in money, which was called
a scutage. The sum was, during some reigns, very
precarious and uncertain; it was sometimes levied with∣out
<PB N="129" REF="144"/>
out allowing the vassal the liberty of personal service<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Gervase de Tilbury, p. 25.</NOTE>
and it was an usual artifice of the King to pretend an
expedition,; that he might be intitled to levy the scutage
from his military tenants. Danegelt was another species
of land-tax levied by the early Norman kings, arbitra∣rily,
and contrary to the laws of the Conqueror<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hist. of the Exch. p. 475.</NOTE>. Mo∣neyage
was also a general land-tax of the same nature,
levied by the two first Norman kings, and abolished by
the charter of Henry I.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, p. 38.</NOTE> It was a shilling paid every
three years by each hearth, to induce the King not to
use his prerogative of debasing the coin. Indeed, it ap∣pears
from that charter, that, tho' the Conqueror had
granted his military tenants an immunity from all taxes
and tailliages, he and his son William had never thought
themselves bound to observe that rule, but had levied im∣positions
at pleasure on all the landed estates of the king∣dom.
The utmost that Henry grants, is, that the land
cultivated by the military tenant himself shall not be so
burdened; but he reserves the power of taxing the far∣mers:
And as it is known, that Henry's charter was
never observed in any one article, we may be assured,
that this prince and his successors retracted even this
small indulgence, and levied arbitrary impositions on all
the lands of all their subjects. These taxes were some∣times
very heavy; since Malmesbury tells us, that, in
the reign of William Rusus, the farmers, on account of
them, abanedond tillage, and a famine easued<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">So also Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 55. Knyghton, p. 2366.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE escheats were a great branch both of power and
of revenue to the King, especially during the first reigns
after the conquest. In default of descendants from the
first baron, his land reverted to the crown, and conti∣nually
augmented the King's possessions, The prince
<PB N="130" REF="145"/>
had indeed by law a power of alienating these escheats;
but by this means he enjoyed an opportunity of establish∣ing
the fortunes of his friends and servants, and thereby
enlarging his authority. Sometimes he retained them in
his own hands, and they were gradually confounded with
his royal demesnes, and became difficult to be distin∣guished
from them. This confusion is probably the rea∣son
why the King acquired the right of alienating his
demesnes.</P>
<P>BUT besides escheats from default of heirs, those which
ensued from crimes or breach of duty towards the supe∣rior
lord, were very frequent in antient times. If the
vassal, being thrice summoned to attend his superior's
court, and do fealty, neglected or refused obedience, he
forfeited all title to his lands<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hottom. de Feud. Disp. cap. 38, col. 886.</NOTE>. If he denied his tenure,
or refused his service, he was exposed to the same pe∣nalty<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lib. Feud. Lib. 3. tit. 1.; lib. 4. tit. 21, 39.</NOTE>.
Where he sold his estate without licence from
his lord<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lib. Feud. lib. 1. tit. 21.</NOTE>, or if he sold it upon any other tenure or title
than that by which he himself held it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Lib. Feud, lib. 4. tit. 44.</NOTE>, he lost all right
to it. The adhering to his lord's enemies<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 3. tit. 1.</NOTE>, deserting
him in war<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 4. tit. 14, 21.</NOTE>, betraying his secrets<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Id. lib 4. tit. 14.</NOTE>, debauching his
wife or his nearer relations<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 1. tit. 14, 21.</NOTE>, or even using indecent li∣berties
with them<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Id. Lib. 1. tit. 1.</NOTE>, might be punished by forfeiture.
The higher crimes, rapes, robbery, murder, burning
houses, &amp;c. were called felony; and being interpreted
want of fidelity to his lord, made him lose his fief<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Glosi. in verb. <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onia.</HI></NOTE>.
Even where the felon was vassal to a baron, tho' his
immediate lord enjoyed the forfeiture, the King might
retain possession of his estate during a year, and had the
<PB N="131" REF="146"/>
right of spoiling and destroying it, unless the baron paid
him a reasonable composition<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Gloss. in verb. <HI>Felonia.</HI> Glanville, lib, 7. cap. 17.</NOTE>. We have not here enu∣merated
all the species of felonies, or of crimes by which
forfeiture was incurred: We have Paid enough to prove,
that the possession of feudal property was antiently some∣what
precarious, and that the primary idea was never
entirely lost, of its being a kind of <HI>fee or benefice.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a baron died, the King immediately took pos∣session
of the estate; and the heir, before he recovered his
right, was obliged to make application to the crown, to
desire that he might be admitted to do homage for his
land, and to pay a composition to the King. This com∣position
was not at first fixed by l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, at least by prac∣tice:
The King was often very exorbitant in his de∣mands,
and kept possession of the land till they were com∣plied
with.</P>
<P>IF the heir was a minor, the King retained the whole
profit of the estate till his majority; and might grant
what sum he thought proper for the education and main∣tenance
of the young baron. This practice was also
founded on the notion, that a fief was a benefice, and
that, while the heir could not perform his military ser∣vices,
the revenue devolved to the superior, who em∣ployed
another in his place. It is obvious, that a great
proportion of the landed property must, by means of
this device, be continually in the hands of the prince,
and that all the noble families were thereby held in con∣tinual
dependance. When the King granted the ward∣ship
of a rich heir to any one, he had the opportunity of
enriching a favourite or minister: If he fold it, he was
thereby able to levy a considerable sum of money. Simon
de Mountfort paid Henry III. 10,000 marks, an im∣mense
<PB N="132" REF="147"/>
sum in those days, for the wardship of Gilbert de Umfreville<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hist. of the Exch. p. 223.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF the heir was a female, the King was entitled to of∣fer
her any husband of her rank he thought proper; and
if she refused him, she forfeited her land. Even a male
heir could not marry without the royal consent, and it
was usual for men to pay large sums for the liberty of
making their own choice in marriage<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 320.</NOTE>. No man could
dispose of his land, either by sale or will, Without the
consent of his superior. The possessor was never con∣sidered
as full proprietor: He was still a kind of bene∣ficiary;
and could not oblige his superior to accept of
any vassal, who was not agreeable to him.</P>
<P>FINES, amerciaments, and oblatas, as they were cal∣led,
were another considerable branch of the royal power
and revenue. The antient records of the exchequer,
which are still preserved, give furprizing accounts of the
numerous fines and amerciaments levied in those days<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 272.</NOTE>,
and of the strange inventions fallen upon to exact mo∣ney
from the subject. It appears, that the old kings of
England put themselves entirely on the footing of the
barbarous eastern princes, whom no man must approach
without a present, who fell all their good offices, and
who intrude themselves into every business, that they
may have a pretence of extorting money. Even justice
was avowedly bought and fold; the King's court itself,
tho' the supreme judicature of the kingdom, was open
to none that brought not large presents to the King;
the bribes given for the expedition, delay<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hist. of Exch. p. 274, 309.</NOTE>, suspension,
and, doubtless, for the perversion of justice, were en∣tered
in the public registers of the royal revenue, and re∣main
as monuments of the perpetual iniquity and ty|
<PB N="133" REF="148"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anny of the times. The barons of the exchequer, for
instance, the first nobility of the Kingdom, were not
ashamed to insert, as an article in their records, that the
county of Norfolk paid a sum, that they might be fairly
dealt with<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hist. of Exch. p. 295.</NOTE>; the borough of Yarmouth, that the King's

erected gilds, corporations, and monopolies, where-ever

<P>THERE were no profits so small as to be below the

to have a recognition against the countess of Copland
for one knight's fee<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 298.</NOTE>. Roger, son of Nicholas, gave

<P>IT is amusing to remark the strange business in which
the King sometires interfered, and never without a pre∣lent:

hens, that she might lie with her husband one night<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Madox's Hist. of Exch. p. 326.</NOTE>;
and she brought with her two sureties, who answered

was a prisoner, which debarred her having access to

It will however be just to
remark, that the same ridiculous practices and dangerous

other states of Europe<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 359. Bened. Abb. p. 180, 181.</NOTE>. England was not in this
respect more barbarous than its neighbours.</P>
<P>THESE iniquitous practices of the Norman kings were
so well known, that on the death of Hugh Bigod, in the
reign of Henry II. the best and most just of these prin∣ces,
the eldest son and the widow of this nobleman came
<PB N="137" REF="152"/>
to court, and strove, by proffering large presents to the
King, each of them to acquire possession of that rich in∣heritance.
The King was so equitable as to order the
cause to be tried by the great council! but in the mean
time, he seized into his own hands all the money and
treasures of the deceased<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 180, 181.</NOTE>. Peter of Blois, a judicious, and even an elegant writer for that age, gives a pathetic
description of the venality of justice and the oppressions
of the poor, under the reign of Henry: and he scruples
not to complain to the king himself of these abuses<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Petri Bles. Epist. 95. apud Bibl. Patrum, tom. 24. p. 2014.</NOTE>.
We may judge what the case would be under the govern∣ment
of worse princes. The articles of enquiry concern∣ing
the conduct of sheriffs, which Henry promulgated in
1170, show the great power as well as the licentiousness
of these officers<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden Chron. Gerv. p. 1410.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMERCIAMENTS or fines for crimes and trespasses were
another considerable branch of the royal revenue<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Madox, chap. xiv.</NOTE>. Most
crimes were atoned for by money; the fines imposed were
not limited by any rule or statute; and frequently occa∣sioned
the total ruin of the person, even for the slightest
trespasses. The forest-laws, particularly, were a great
source of oppression. The king possessed sixty-eight so∣rests,
thirteen chaces, and seven hundred and eighty-one
parks, in different parts of England<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spelm, Gloss. in verbo <HI>Foresta.</HI></NOTE>; and considering
the extreme passion of the English and Normans for hunt∣ing,
these were so many snares laid for the people, by
which they were allured into trespasses, and brought with∣in
the reach of arbitrary and rigorous laws, which the
king had thought proper by his own authority to enact.</P>
<P>BUT the most barefaced acts of tyranny and oppression
were those pracised against the Jews, who were entirely
<PB N="138" REF="153"/>
out of the protection of law, were extremely odious
to the bigotry of the people, and were abandoned to the
immeasurable rapacity of the King and his ministers. Be∣sides
many other indignities, to which they were conti∣nually
exposed, it appears, that they were once all
thrown into prison, and the sum of 66,000 marks exact∣ed
for their liberty<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Madox Hist. of the Exch. p. 151. This happened in the reign of King John.</NOTE>: At another time, Isaac the Jew
paid alone 5100 marks<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 151.</NOTE>; Brun, 3000 marks<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 153.</NOTE>; Jurnet
2000; Bennet, 500: At another, Licorica, widow of
David, the Jew of Oxford, was required to pay 6000
marks; and she was delivered over to six of the richest
and discreetest Jews of England, who were to answer for
the sum<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 168.</NOTE>. Henry III. borrowed 5000 marks of the earl
of Cornwal; and for his repayment assigned him over all the Jews of England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Id p. 156.</NOTE>. The revenue arising from exac∣tions
upon this nation was so considerable, that there was
a particular court of exchequer set apart for managing it<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Id. chap. vii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE may judge of the low state of commerce among the
English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commerce.</NOTE> when the Jews, notwithstanding all these op∣pressions,
could still find their account in trading among
them, and lending them money. And as the improve∣ments
of agriculture were also much checked, both by
the immense possessions of the nobility, and by the preca∣rious
state of feudal property; it appears, that industry
of no kind could then have place in the kingdom<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">We learn from the extracts given us of Domesday by Brady in his Treatise of Boroughs, that almost all the boroughs of England had suffered in the shock of the Conquest, and had decayed extremely between the death of the Consessor, and the time when Domesday was framed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is asserted by Sir Harry Spellman<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Gloss. in verb <HI>judicium Dei.</HI></NOTE>, as an undoubted
truth, that, during the reigns of the first Norman prin∣ces,
<PB N="139" REF="154"/>
every edict of the king, Issued with the consent of
his privy-council, had the full force of law. But the ba∣rons
surely were not so passive as to entrust a power, en∣tirely
arbitrary and despotic, into the hands of the sove∣reign.
It only appears, that the constitution had not
fixed any precise boundaries to the royal power; that the
right of issuing proclamations on any emergence and of
exacting obedience to them, a right which was always
supposed inherent in the crown, is very difficult to be
distinguished from a legislative authority; that the extreme
imperfection of the antient laws, and the sudden exigen∣tcies,
which often occurred in such turbulent govern∣ments,
obliged the prince to exert frequently the latent
powers of his prerogative; that he naturally proceeded,
from the acquiescence of the people, to assume, in many
particulars of moment, an authority, from which he had
excluded himself by express statutes, charters or conces∣sions,
and which was, in the main, repugnant to the ge∣neral
genius of the constitution; and that the lives, the
personal liberty, and the properties of all his subjects were
less secured by law against the exertion of his arbitrary
authority, than by the independant power and private
connexions of each individual. It appears from the
great charter itself, that not only John, a tyrannical
prince, and Richard, a violent one, but their father,
Henry, under whose reign the prevalence of gross abuses
is the least to be suspected, was accustomed, from his sole
authority, without process of law, to imprison, banish
and attaint the freemen of his kingdom.</P>
<P>A GREAT baron, in antient times, considered himself
as a kind of sovereign within his territory; and was at∣tended
with courtiers and dependants more zealously at∣tached
to him than the ministers of state and the great of∣ficers
were commonly to <HI>their</HI> fovereign. He often main∣tained
<PB N="140" REF="155"/>
in his court the parade of royalty, by establishing
a justiciary, constable, mareschal, chamberlain, seneschal,
and chancellor, and assigning to each of these officers a
separate province and command. He was usually very
assiduous in exercising his jurisdiction; and took such de∣light
in that image of sovereignty, that it was found ne∣cessary
to restrain his activity, and prohibit him by law
from holding courts too frequently<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Jurid. Orig. p. 26.</NOTE>. It is not to be
doubted, that the example, set him by the prince, of a
mercenary and sordid extortion, would be faithfully co∣pied;
and that all his good and bad offices, his justice
and injustice, were equally put to sale. He had the
power, with the king's consent, to exact talliages even
from the free-citizens who lived within his barony; and
as his necessities made him rapacious, his authority was
usually found to be more oppressive and tyrannical than
that of the sovereign<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Madox. Hist. of
Exch. p. 520.</NOTE>. He was ever engaged in heredi∣tary
or personal animosities or confederacies with his
neighbours, and often gave protection to all desperate ad∣venturers
and criminals, who could be useful in serving
his violent purposes. He was able alone, in times of
tranquillity, to obstruct the execution of justice within
his territories; and by combining with a few malcontent
barons of high rank and power, he could throw the
whole state into convulsions. And on the whole, tho'
the royal authority was confined within bounds, and of∣ten
within very narrow ones, yet the check was irregu∣lar,
and often the source of great disorders; and it was
not derived from the liberty of the people, but from the
military power of many petty tyrants, who were equally
dangerous to the prince and oppressive to the subject.</P>
<P>THE power of the church was another rampart against
royal authority;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Church.</NOTE> but this defence was also the cause of
many mischiefs and inconveniencies. The dignified
<PB N="141" REF="156"/>
clergy, perhaps, were not so prone to immediate vio∣lence
as the barons; but as they pretended to a total in∣dependance
on the state, and could always cover them∣selves
with the appearances of religion, they proved, in
one respect, an obstruction to the settlement of the king∣dom,
and to the regular execution of the laws. The
policy of the conqueror was in this particular liable to
some exception. He augmented the superstitious vene∣ration
for Rome, to which that age was so much in∣clined;
and he broke those bands of connexion, which,
in the Saxon times, had preserved an union between the
lay and the clerical orders. He prohibited the bishops to
sit in the county-courts; he allowed ecclesiastical causes
to be tried only in spiritual courts<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Char. Will, apud Wilkins, p. 230. Spel. Conc. vol. ii, p. 14.</NOTE>; and he so much
exalted the power of the clergy, that of 60,215 knights
fees, into which he divided England, he placed no less
than 28,015 under the, church<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Spel. Gloss. in verb. <HI>manus mortua.</HI> We are not to imagine, as some have done, that the church possessed lands in this proportion, but only that they and their vassals enjoyed such a proportionable part of the landed property.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE right of primogeniture came in with the feudal
law:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil laws.</NOTE> A practice, which is hurtful by producing and
maintaining an unequal division of private property; but
is advantageous, in another respect, by accustoming the
people to a preference in favour of the eldest son, and
thereby preventing a partition or disputed succession in
the monarchy. The Normans introduced the use of sir∣names,
which tend to preserve the knowledge of families
and pedigrees; as do also, the distinction of coats of
arms, which came in vogue about the time of king Ri∣chard.
They abolished none of the old absurd methods
of trial, by the cross or ordeal; and they added a new
I absurdity, that by single combat<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">LL. Will. cap. 68.</NOTE>, which became a
<PB N="142" REF="157"/>
regular part of jurisprudence, and was conducted with all
the order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners.</NOTE> method, devotion and solemnity imaginable<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spel. Gloss. in verb. <HI>campus.</HI> The last instance of these duels was in the 15th of Eliz. So long did that absurdity remain.</NOTE>.
The ideas of chivalry also seem to have been imported by
the Normans: No traces of these fantastic notions are
to be found among the plain and rustic Saxons: The
feudal institutions, by raising a set of men to a kind of
sovereign dignity, rendering personal strength and valor
so requisite, and making every knight and baron his own
protector and avenger, begot that military pride and
sense of honour, which, being cultivated and embellish∣ed
by the poets and romance writers of the age, ended
in chivalry. The virtuous knight fought not only in his
own quarrel; but in that of the innocent, the helpless,
and above all, of the fair, whom he supposed to be for
ever under the guardianship of his valiant arm. The un∣courteous
knight, who, from his castle, exercised rob∣bery
on travellers, and committed violence on virgins,
was the object of his perpetual indignation; and he put
him to death, without scruple or trial or appeal, where∣ever
he met with him. The great independance of men
made personal honour and fidelity the chief tie among
them; and rendered it the capital virtue of every true
knight, or genuine professor of chivalry. The solemni∣ties
of single combat, as established by law, banished the
notion of every thing unfair or unequal in rencounters;
and maintained an appearance of courtesy between the
combatants, till the moment of their engagement. The
credulity of the age grasted on this stock the notion of
giants, enchanters, dragons, spells<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In all legal single combats, it was part of the champion's oath, that he carried not about him any herb, spell, or inchantment, by which he might procure victory. Dugd. Orig. Jurid. p. 82.</NOTE>, and a thousand won∣der
<PB N="143" REF="158"/>
which still multiplied during the times of the Cru∣sades;
when men, returning from so great a distance, used
the liberty of imposing every fiction on their believing
audience. These ideas of chivalry infected the writings,
conversation, and behaviour of men, during some ages;
and even after they were, in a great degree, banished
by the revival of learning, they left modern <HI>gallantry</HI>
and the <HI>point of honour,</HI> which still maintain their in∣fluence,
and are the genuine offspring of those ancient affectations.</P>
<P>THE concession of the great charter, or rather its full
establishment (for there was a considerable interval be∣tween
the one and the other) gave rise, by degrees, to
a new species of government, and introduced some order
and justice into the administration. The ensuing scenes
of our history are therefore somewhat different from the
preceding. Yet the great charter contained no establish∣ment
of new courts, magistrates, or senates, nor aboli∣tion
of the old. It introduced no new distribution of
the powers of the commonwealth, and no innovation in
the political or public law of the kingdom. It only
guarded, and that merely by verbal clauses, against such
tyrannical practices as are incompatible with civilized
government, and, if they become very frequent, are in∣compatible
with all government. The barbarous licence
of the kings, and perhaps of the nobles, was thenceforth
somewhat more restrained: Men acquired some more
security for their properties and their liberties: And go∣vernment
approached a little nearer to that end, for
which it was originally instituted, the distribution of ju∣stice,
and the equal protection of the citizens. Acts of
violence and iniquity in the crown, which before were
only deemed injuries to individuals, and were hazardous
chiefly in proportion to the number, power, and dignity
of the persons affected by them, were now regarded, in
<PB N="144" REF="159"/>
some degree, as public injuries, and as infringements of
a charter, calculated for general security. And thus, the
establishment of the Great Charter, without seeming any∣wife
to innovate in the distribution of political power, be∣came
a kind of epoch in the cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itution.</P>

are enabled to comprehend in a few propositions
an infinite number of inferences and conclusions,. His∣tory
also, being a collection of facts which are multiply∣ing
without end, is obliged to adopt such arts of abridge∣ment,
to retain the more material events, and to drop all
the minute circumstances, which are only interesting
during the time, or to the persons engaged in the trans∣actions.
This truth is no where more evident than with
regard to the reign, upon which we are going to enter.
<PB N="146" REF="161"/>
What mortal could have the patience to write or read a
long detail of such frivolous events as those with which
it is filled, or attend to a tedious narrative which would
follow, thro' a series of fifty six years, the caprices and
weaknesses of so mean a prince as Henry? The chief
reason, why protestant writers have been so anxious to
spread out the incidents of this reign, is in order to ex∣pose
the rapacity, ambition, and artifices of the court of
Rome, and to prove, that the great dignitaries of the
catholic church, while they pretended to have nothing
in view but the salvation of souls, had bent all their at∣tention
to the acquisition of riches, and were restrained
by no sense of justice or honour, in the pursuit of that
great object<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 623.</NOTE>. But this conclusion would readily be
allowed them, tho' it were not illustrated by such a de∣tail
of uninteresting incidents; and follows indeed, by an
evident necessity, from the very situation, in which that
church was placed with regard to the rest of Europe.
For besides that all ecclesiastical power, as it can always
cover its operations under a cloak of sanctity, and at∣tacks
men on the side where they dare not employ their
reason, lies less under controul than civil government;
besides this general cause, I say, the Pope and his cour∣tiers
were foreigners to most of the churches which they governed; they
could not possibly have any other object
but to pillage the provinces for present gain; and as
they lived at a distance, they would be little awed by
shame or remorse, in practising every lucrative expedient,
which was suggested to them. England being one of the
most remote provinces, attached to the Romish hierarchy,
as well as one of the richest, and the most prone to supper∣stition,
selt severely during this reign, while its patience
was not yet fully exhausted, the influence of these cau∣ses;
and we shall often have occasion to touch cursorily
<PB N="147" REF="162"/>
upon such incidents. But we shall not attempt to com∣prehend
every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsaction transmitted to us; and till the
end of the reign, when the events become more memo∣rable,
we shall not always observe an exact chronolo∣gical
order in our narration.</P>
<P>THE earl of Pembroke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the go∣vernment.</NOTE> who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th Oct.</NOTE> at the time of John's
death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th Nov.</NOTE> was marischal of England, was by his office at
the head of the armies, and consequently, during a state
of civil wars and convulsions, at the head of the state;
and it happened fortunately for the young monarch,
and for the nation, that the power could not have been
intrusted into more able and more faithful hands. This
nobleman, who had maintained his loyalty unshaken to
John during the lowest fortune of that monarch, deter∣mined
to support the authority of the infant prince; and
he was not dismayed with the number and violence of
his enemies. Sensible, that Henry, according to the
prejudices of the times, would not be deemed sovereign,
till crowned and anointed by a churchman; he immedi∣ately
carried the young prince to Glocester, where the ce∣remony
of coronation was performed, in the presence of
Gualo, the legate, and a very few noblemen, by the bi∣shops
of Winchester and Bath<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 200. Hist. Croys. Cont. p. 474. W. Heming. p. 562. Trivet, p. 168.</NOTE>. As the concurrence
of the papal authority was requisite to support the tot∣tering
throne, Henry was obliged to swear fealty to the
Pope, and renew that homage, to which his father had
already subjected the kingdom<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 200.</NOTE>: And in order to en∣large
the authority of Pembroke, and give him a more
regular and legal title to it, a general council of the
barons was soon after summoned at Bristol, where that
nobleman was chosen protector of the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="163"/>
PEMBROKE, that he might reconcile all men to the
government of his pupil, made him grant anew a charter
of liberties, which, tho' mostly copied from the former
concessions, extorted from John, contains some altera∣tions,
which may be deemed remarkable<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 215.</NOTE>. The full pri∣vilege
of elections in the clergy, granted by John the
former King, was not confirmed, nor the liberty of go∣ing
out of the kingdom, without the royal consent:
Whence we may conjecture, that Pembroke and the
barons, jealous of the ecclesiastical power, were desirous
of renewing the King's claim to issue a cong<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egrave; d'elire to
the monks and chapters, and thought it requisite to put
some check on the frequent appeals to Rome. But what
may chiefly surprize us is, that the obligation, to which
John had subjected himself, of obtaining the consent of
the great council before he levied any aids or scutages
from the nation, was omitted; and this article was even
declared hard and severe, and was expressly left to future
deliberation. But we must consider, that, tho' this li∣mitation
may perhaps appear to us the most momentous
in the whole charter of John, it was not regarded in that
light by the antient barons, who were more jealous of
particular acts of violence in the crown than of such ge∣neral
impositions, which, unless they were evidently
reasonable and necessary, could scarce, without a gene∣ral
consent, be levied upon men, who had arms in their
hands, and who could repel any act of oppression, by
which they were all immediately affected. We accord∣ingly
find, that Henry, in the course of his reign, while
he gave frequent occasions for complaint, with regard to
the violations of the great charter, never once attempt∣ed,
by his mere will, to levy any aids or scutages;
though he was often reduced to great necessities, and
<PB N="149" REF="164"/>
was refused supplies by his people. So much easier was
it for him to transgress the law, when individuals alone
were affected, than even to exert his acknowledged pre∣rogatives,
where the interest of the whole body was
concerned.</P>
<P>THIS charter was again confirmed by the King in the
ensuing year, with the addition of fome articles to pre∣vent
the oppressions of sheriffs: And also with an addi∣tional
charter of forests, a circumstance of great moment
in those ages, when hunting was so much the occupation
of the nobility, and when the King comprehended so
considerable a part of the kingdom within his forests,
which he governed by peculiar and arbitrary laws. All
the forests, which had been enclosed since the reign of
Henry the second, were desaforested; and new peram∣bulations
were appointed for that purpose: Offences in
the forests were declared to be no longer capital; but
punishable by fines, imprisonrnents, and more gentle
penalties: And all the proprietors of land recovered the
power of cutting and tiling their own wood at their
pleasure.</P>
<P>Thus, these famous charters were brought very nearly
to the shape, in which they have ever since slood; and
they were, during many generations, the darling of the
whole English nation, and esteemed the most sacred
rampart to national liberty and independance. As they
secured the rights of all orders of men, they were re∣garded
with a jealous eye by all, and became the basis,
in a manner, of the English monarchy, and a kind of
original contract, which both limited the authority of
the King, and ensured the conditional allegiance of his
subjects. Tho' often violated, they were still claimed
and recalled by the nobility and people; and as no pre∣cedents
were supposed valid, that infringed them, they
rather acquired, than lost authority, from the frequent
<PB N="150" REF="165"/>
attempts, made against them in feveral ages, by regal
and arbitrary power.</P>
<P>WHILE Pembroke, by renewing and confirming the
great charter, gave so much satisfaction and security to
the nation in general, he also applied himself successfully
to individuals; and wrote letters, in the King's name,
to all the malecontent barons; in which he re∣presented
to them, that whatever jealousy and animosity
they might have entertained against the late King, a
young prince, the lineal heir of their antient monarchs,
had now succeeded to the throne, without succeeding
either to the resentments or principles of his predecessor:
That the desperate expedient, which they had employed,
of calling in a foreign potentate, had, happily for them
as well as for the nation, failed of entire success, and it
was still in their power, by a quick return to their duty,
to restore the independence of the kingdom, and to se∣cure
that liberty, for which they so zealously contended:
That as all past offences of the barons were now buried
in oblivion, they ought, on their part, to forget their
complaints against their late sovereign, who, if he had
been any wife blameable in his conduct, had left to his
son the salutary warning, to avoid the paths, which had
led to such fatal extremities: And that having now ob∣tained
a charter for their liberties, it was their interest
to shew, by their conduct, that that acquisition was not
incompatible with their allegiance, and that the rights of
King and people, so far from being hostile and opposite,
might mutually support and sustain each other<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. I. p. 215. Brady's App. No. 143.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE considerations, enforced by the character of
constancy and fidelity, which Pembroke had ever main∣tained,
had a mighty influence on the barons; and the
most of them began secretly to negotiate with him, and
many of them openly returned to their duty. The diffi∣dence,
<PB N="151" REF="166"/>
which Lewis discovered of their fidelity, for∣warded
this general propension towards the King; and
when the French prince refused the government of the
castle of Hertford to Robert Fitz-Walter, who had been
so active against the late King, and who claimed that
fortress as his right and property, they all plainly saw,
that the English were excluded from every trust, and
that foreigners had engrossed all the confidence and af∣fection
of their new sovereign<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 200, 202.</NOTE>. The excommunication
too, denounced by the legate, against all Lewis's adhe∣rents,
failed not, in the turn which mens dispositions
had taken, to operate a mighty effect upon them; and
they were easily persuaded to consider a cause as impious
and profane, for which they had already entertained an
unsurmountable aversion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 200. M. West. p. 277.</NOTE>. Tho' Lewis made a journey
to France, and brought over fresh succours from that
kingdom<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. 1: p. 79. M. West. p. 277.</NOTE>, he found, on his return, that his party was
still more weakened by the desertion of his English con∣federates,
and that the death of John, had, contrary to
his expectation, given an incurable blow to his cause.
The earls of Salisbury, Arundel, and Warrenne, toge∣ther
with William Mareshal, eldest son of the protector,
had embraced Henry's party; and every English noble∣man
was plainly watching an opportunity of returning
to his allegiance. Pembroke was so much strengthened
by these accessions, that he ventured to invest Mount-so∣rel;
tho', upon the approach of the count de Perche
with the French army, he desisted from his enterprize,
and raised the siege<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 203.</NOTE>. The count de Perche, elated
with this success, marched to Lincoln; and being ad∣mitted
into the town, he began to attack the castle,
which he soon reduced to extremity. The protector

summoned all his forces from every quarter in order to
relieve a place of such importance; and he appeared so
much superior to the French, that they shut themselves
up within the city, and resolved to take shelter behind
the walls<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. 1. p. 81.</NOTE>. But the garrison of the castle, having re∣ceived
a strong reinforcement, made a vigorous sally up∣on
the besiegers; while the English army, by concert,
assaulted them in the same instant from without, mount∣ed
the walls by scalade, and bearing down all resistance,
entered the city sword in hand. Lincoln was delivered
over to be pillaged; the French army was totally routed;
the count de Perche, with only two persons more, was
killed, but many of the chief commanders and about 400
knights were made prisoners by the English<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 204, 205. Chron. de Mullr. p. 195.</NOTE>. So little
blood was shed in this important action; which decided
the fate of one of the most powerful kingdoms of Eu∣rope;
and such wretched soldiers were those antient ba∣rons,
who yet were unacquainted with every thing but arms.</P>
<P>PRINCE Lewis was informed of this fatal event, while
employed in the siege of Dover, which was still valiantly
defended against him by Hubert de Burgh. He imme∣diately
retreated towards London, which was the center
and life of his party; and he there received intelligence
of a new disaster, which put an end to all his hopes. A
French fleet bringing over a strong reinforcement, had
appeared on the coast of Kent, when they were attacked
by the English under the command of Philip d'Albiney,
and were routed and repulsed with considerable loss.
D'Albiney practised a stratagem against them, which is
said to have contributed to the victory: Having gained
the wind of the French, he came down upon them with
violence; and throwing in their faces a great quantity
<PB N="153" REF="170"/>
of quick-lime, which he purposely carried on board, he
so blinded them, that they were disabled from defending
themselves<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 206. Ann. Waverl. p. 183. W. Heming. p. 563. Trivet, p. 169. M. West. p. 277. Knyghton, p. 2428.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this second misfortune of the French,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General pa∣cification.</NOTE> the
English barons hasted every where to make terms of
peace with the protector, and by an early submission, to
prevent those forfeitures, to which they were exposed on
account of their rebellion. Lewis, whose cause was now
totally desperate, began to be anxious for the safety of
his person, and was glad, on any honourable conditions,
to make his escape from a country, where he found, that
every thing was now become hostile to him. He con∣cluded
a peace with Pembroke, promised to evacuate the
kingdom, and only stipulated in return, an indemnity
to his adherents, and a restitution of their honours and
fortunes, together with the free and equal enjoyment of
those liberties, which had been granted to the rest of the
nation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 221. M. Paris, p. 207. Chron. Dunst. vol. 1. p. 83. M. West, p. 278. Knyghton, p. 2429.</NOTE>. Thus, was happily ended a civil war, which
seemed to be founded on the most incurable hatred and
jealousy, and threatened the kingdom with the most fatal
consequences.</P>
<P>THE precautions, which the King of France used in
the conduct of this whole affair, are remarkable. He
pretended, that his son had accepted of the offer from the
English barons, without his advice, and contrary to his
inclination: The armies sent to England were levied in
Lewis's name; When that prince came over to France
for aid, his father publickly refused to grant him any as∣sistance,
and would not so much as admit him to his pre∣sence:
Even after Henry's party acquired the ascendant,
and Lewis was in danger of falling into the hands of his
<PB N="154" REF="171"/>
enemies, it was Blanche of Castile his wife, not the
King his father, who raised armies and equipped fleets for
his succour<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 256. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 82.</NOTE>. All these artifices were employed, not to
satisfy the Pope; for he had too much penetration to be
so easily imposed on: Nor yet to deceive the people; for
they were too gross even for that purpose: They only ser∣ved
for a colouring to Philip's cause; and in public affairs,
men are often better pleased, that the truth, tho' known
to every body, should be wrapt up under a decent cover,
than if it were exposed in open day-light to the eyes of
all the world.</P>
<P>AFTER the expulsion of the French, the prudence and
equity of the protector's subsequent conduct, contributed
to cure entirely those wounds, which had been made by
intestine discord. He received the rebellious barons into
favour; observed strictly the terms of peace, which he
had granted them; restored them to their possessions;
and endeavoured, by an equal behaviour, to bury all
past animosities in perpetual oblivion. The clergy alone,
who had adhered to Lewis, were sufferers in this revo∣lution.
As they had rebelled against their sovereign,
the Pope, by disregarding the interdict and excommunica∣tion,
it was not in Pembroke's power to make any stipu∣lations
in their favour; and Gualo, the legate, prepared
to take vengeance on them for their disobedience<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. No. 144. Chron. Dunst, vol. i, p. 83.</NOTE>. Ma∣ny
of them were deposed; many suspended; some ba∣nished;
and all who escaped punishment, made atonement
for their offences, by paying large sums to the le∣gate,
who amassed an immense treasure by this expe∣dient.</P>
<P>THE earl of Pembroke survived not long the pacifica∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the protector.</NOTE>
which had been chiefly owing to his wisdom and
valour<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 210.</NOTE>; and he was succeeded in the government by
<PB N="155" REF="172"/>
Peter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some com∣motions.</NOTE> bishop of Winchester, a Poictevin, and Hubert
de Burgh, high justiciary. The councils of the latter
were chiefly followed; and had he possessed equal autho∣rity
in the kingdom with Pembroke, he seemed to be
every way worthy of filling the place of that virtuous
citizen. But the licentious and powerful barons, who
had once broke the reins of subjection to their prince,
and had obtained by violence an enlargement of their
liberties and independance, could ill be restrained by
Jaws under a minority; and the people, no less than
the King, suffered from their outrages and disorders.
They retained by force the royal castles, which they had
usurped during the past convulsions, or which had been
committed to their custody by the protector<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 174.</NOTE>: They
usurped the demesnes<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 276.</NOTE>: They oppressed their vassals:
They infested their weaker neighbours: And they invi∣ted
all disorderly people to enter in their retinue, and to
live upon their lands; and they gave them protection
in all their robberies and extortions.</P>
<P>No one was more infamous for these violent and ille∣gal
practices than the earl of Albemarle, who, tho' he
had early returned to his duty, and had been very ser∣viceable
in expelling the French, augmented to the ut∣most
of his power the general licence, which prevailed;
and committed outrages in all the counties of the north.
In order to suppress his disorders, Hubert seized an op∣portunity
of getting possession of Rockingham castle,
which Albemarle had garrisoned with his licentious reti∣nue:
But this nobleman, instead of submitting, entered
into a secret confederacy with Fawkes de Breaut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Peter
de Mauleon, and other barons, and both fortified the
castle of Biham for his defence, and made himself master
by surprize of that of Fotheringay. Pandulf, who was
restored to his legateship in the place of Gualo, was ac∣tive

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="155" REF="174"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="156" REF="175"/>
in suppressing this rebellion; and with the concur∣rence
of eleven bishops, he denounced the sentence of
excommunication against: Albemarle and his adherents<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. 1. p. 102.</NOTE>:
An army was levied: A scutage of ten shillings a knight's
fee was imposed on all the military tenants: Albemarle's
associates gradually deserted him: And he himself was
obliged at last to submit to mercy. He received a par∣don,
and was restored to his whole estate.</P>
<P>THIS impolitic lenity, too frequent in those times,
was probably the result of a combination among the ba∣rons,
who never could endure to see the total ruin of one
of their own order: But it encouraged Fawkes de
Breaut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, a man whom King John had raised from a low
origin, to persevere in the course of violence, to which
he had owed his fortune, and to set at nought all law and
justice. When thirty-five verdicts were at one time
found against him, on account of his violent expulsion of
so many freeholders from their possessions; he came to
the court of justice with an armed force, seized the judge
who had pronounced the sentences, and imprisoned him
in Bedford castle. He then levied open war against the
King; but being subdued, and taken prisoner, his life
was granted him; but his estate was confiscated, and he
was banished the kingdom<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 198. M. Paris, p. 221, 224. Ann. Waverl. p. 188. Chron, Dunst, vol. 1. p. 141, 146. M. West. p. 283.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JUSTICE was executed with greater severity against
disorders less premeditated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1222</NOTE> which broke out in the city
of London. A frivolous emulation in a match of wrest∣ling,
between the Londoners on the one hand, and the
inhabitants of Westminster and those of the neighbouring
villages on the other, occasioned this commotion. The
former rose in a body, and pulled down some houses be∣longing
<PB N="157" REF="176"/>
to the abbot of Westminster: But this riot,
which; considering the tumultuous disposition familiar to
that capital, would have been little regarded, seemed to
become more serious, by the symptoms, which then
broke out of the former attachment of the citizens to the
French interest. The populace, in the tumult, made
use of the cry of war commonly employed by the French
troops; <HI>Mountjoy, mountjoy, God help us and our lord Lewis.</HI>
The justiciary made enquiry into the disorder; and find∣ing
one Constantine Fitz Arnulf to have been the ring∣leader,
an insolent man, who justified his crime in Hu∣bert's
presence, he proceeded against him by martial law,
and ordered him immediately to be hanged, without trial
or form of process. He also cut off the feet of some of
Constantine's accomplices<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 217, 218, 259, Annal. Waverl. p. 187. Chron. Dunsi. vol. 1. p. 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS act of power was complained of as an infringe∣ment
of the great charter: Yet the justiciary, in a par∣liament,
summoned at Oxford (for the great councils
began about this time to receive that appellation) made
no scruple to grant in the King's name a renewal and con∣firmation
of that charter. When the assembly made ap∣plication
to the crown for this favour; as a law in those
times seemed to lose its validity, if not frequently renew∣ed;
William de Briewere, one of the council of regen∣cy,
was so bold as to say openly, that these liberties were
extorted by force, and ought not to be observed: But he
was reprimanded by the archbishop of Canterbury, and
was not countenanced by the King or his chief mini∣sters<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 282.</NOTE>.
A new confirmation was demanded and granted
two years after; and an aid, amounting to a fifteenth of
all moveables, was given by the parliament, in return
for this indulgence<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 223. Ann. T. Wykes, p. 40. Chron. Dunst. vol. 1 p. 151 M. West, p. 284. Knyghton, p. 2430.</NOTE>. The King issued writs anew to

<PB N="157" REF="178"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="158" REF="179"/>
the sheriffs, commanding the observance of the charter;
but he inserted a remarkable clause in the writs, that
those who payed not the fifteenth, should not for the fu∣ture
be entitled to the benefit of those liberties<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Claus. 9. H. 3. m. 9. and m. 6. d.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE low state, into which the crown was now fallen,
made it requisite for a good minister to be attentive to the
preservation of the royal prerogatives, as well as to the
security of public liberty. Hubert applied to the Pope,
who had always great authority in the kingdom, and
was now considered as its superior lord; and desired him
to issue a bull, declaring the king to be of full age, and
entitled to exercise in person all the acts of royalty<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 220.</NOTE>. In
consequence of this declaration, the justiciary resigned
into Henry's hands the two important fortresses of the
Tower and Dover castle, which had been entrusted to
his custody and required the other barons to imitate
his example. They refused compliance: The earls of
Chester and Albemarle, John Constable of Chester, John
de Lacy, Brian de I'Isle, and William de Cantel, with
some others, even formed a conspiracy to surprize Lon∣don,
and met in arms at Waltham with that intention:
But finding the King prepared for defence, they desisted
from their enterprize. When summoned to court, in
order to answer for their conduct, they scrupled not to
appear, and to confess their design: But they told the
King, that they had no bad intentions against his person,
but only against Hubert de Burgh, whom they were determined
to remove from his office<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. p 137</NOTE>. They appeared
too formidable to be chastifed; and they were so little
discouraged by the failure of their first enterprize, that
they met again in arms at Leicester, in order to seize the
King, who then resided at Northampton: But Henry,
<PB N="159" REF="180"/>
informed of their purpose, took care to be so well armed
and attended, that the barons found it dangerous to;
make the attempt; and they? sat down and kept their
Christmas in his neighbourhood<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 221. Chron. Dunst. vol. 1. p. 138.</NOTE> The archbishop and
the prelates, finding every thing tend towards a civil war,
interposed with their authority, and threatened the ba∣rons
with the sentence of excommunication, if they per∣sisted
in detaining the King's castles. This menace at
last prevailed: Most of the fortresses were surrendered;
tho' the barons complained, that Hubert's castles were
soon after restored to him, while the King still kept
theirs in his own custody. There are said to have been
1115 castles at that time in England<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Coke's Comment. on Mag. Charta, chap. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT must be acknowledged, that the influence of the
prelates and the clergy was often of very great service to
the public. Tho' the religion of that age can merit no
other name than that of superstition, it served to unite
together a body of men who had great sway over the
people, and who kept the community from falling to
pieces, from the factions and independant power of the
nobles. And what was of great consequence; it threw
a mighty authority into the hands of men, who by their
profession were averse to arms and violence; who tem∣pered
by their, mediation the general disposition towards
military enterprizes; and who still maintained, even
amidst the shock of arms, those secret links, without
which it is impossible for human society to subsist.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING these ihtestine commotions in
England, and the precarious authority of the crown,
Henry was obliged to carry on war in France, and he
employed to that purpose the fifteenth which had been
granted him by parliament. Lewis the eighth, who had
succeeded to his father, Philip, instead of attending to
<PB N="160" REF="181"/>
Henry's claim, who demanded the restitution of Nor∣mandy
and the other provinces, wrested from England,
made an irruption into Poictou, took Rochelle<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 269. Trivet, p. 179.</NOTE> after a
long siege, and seemed determined to expell the English from
the few provinces, which yet remained to them. Henry
sent over his uncle, the earl of Salisbury; together with
his brother prince Richard, to whom he had granted the
eardom of Cornwal, which had escheated to the crown,
Salisbury stopt the progress of Lewis's arms, and retained
the Poictevin and Gascon vassals in their allegiance: But
no military action of any moment was performed on
either side. The earl of Cornwal, after two years stay
in Guienne, returned to England.</P>
<P>THIS prince was no wife turbulent or factious in his
disposition:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1227</NOTE> His ruling passion was to amass money, in
which he succeeded so well as to become the richest
prince in Christendom: Yet his attention to gain fome∣times
threw him into acts of violence, and gave distur∣bance
to the government. There was a manor, which
formerly had belonged to the earldom of Cornwal, but
had been given away to Waleran de Ties, before
Richard had been invested with that dignity, and while
the earldom remained in the hands of the crown.
Richard claimed this manor, and expelled the proprietor
by force: Waleran complained: The king ordered his
brother to do justice to the man, and restore him to his
rights: The earl said, that he would not submit to these
orders, till the cause was decided against him by the
judgment of his peers: Henry replied, that it was first
requisite to re-instate Waleran_ in possession, before the
cause could be tried; and he re-iterated his orders to the
earl<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 233.</NOTE>. We may judge of the state of the government,
when this affair was like to produce a civil war. The
<PB N="161" REF="182"/>
earl of Cornwal, finding Henry peremptory in his de∣mands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1227</NOTE>
associated himself with the young earl of Pem∣broke
who had married his sister, and who was discon∣tented
on account of the King's requiring him to deliver
up some royal castles which were in his custody. These
two noblemen took into their consederacy the earls of
Chester, Warenne, Glocester, Hereford, Warwic, and
Ferrers, who were all disgusted on a like account<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 233.</NOTE>. The
malecontents affembled an army, which the King had
not the power or courage to resist; and he was obliged
to give his brother satisfaction, by grants of much greater
importance than the manor, which had been the first ground of the quarrel<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE character of the King, as he grew to man's
estate, became every day better known, and was found
in every circumstance totally unqualified for maintaining
a proper sway among those turbulent barons, whom the
feudal constitution subjected to his authority. Gentle,
humane, and merciful even to a fault, he seems to have
been steady in no other circumstance of his character;
but to have received every impression, from those who
surrounded him, and whom he loved, for the time, with
the molt imprudent and most unreserved affection. With∣out
activity or vigour, he was unfit to conduct war;
without policy or art, he was ill fitted to maintain peace:
His resentments, tho' hasty and violent, were not
dreaded, while he was found to drop them with such
facility; his friendships were little valued, because they
were neither derived from choice, nor maintained with
constancy. A proper pageant of state in a regular monarchy,
where his ministers could have conducted all affairs
in his name and by his authority; but too feeble in
thole disorderly times to fway a scepter, whole weight
<PB N="162" REF="183"/>
depended entirely on the firmness and dexterity of the
hand, which held it.</P>
<P>THE ablest and most virtuous minister,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubert de Burgh displaced.</NOTE> whom Henry
ever possessed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1231</NOTE> was Hubert de Burgh<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neustriae, p. 464.</NOTE>; a man who had
been Ready to the crown in the most difficult and dan∣gerous
times, and who yet chewed no disposition, in the
height of his power, to enslave or oppress the people.
The only exceptionable part of his conduit is that which
is mentioned by Matthew Paris<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 232. M. West. p. 216. ascribes this council to Peter Bishop of Winchester.</NOTE>, if the fact is really
true, and proceeded from Hubert's advice, the recalling
publickly and annulling the charter of forests, a con∣cession
so reasonable in itself, and so passionately claimed
both by the nobility and people: But it must be consessed,
that this measure is so unlikely, both from the circum∣stances
of the times and character of the minister, that
there is great reason to doubt of its reality, especially as
it is mentioned by no other historian. Hubert, while he
enjoyed his authority, had an entire ascendent over
Henry, and was loaded with honours and favours be∣yond
any other subject. Besides acquiring the property
of many castles and manors, he married the eldest fister
of the King of Scots, was created earl of Kent, and
by an unusual concession, was made chief justiciary
of England for life:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1231.</NOTE> Yet Henry, in a sudden caprice,
threw off this faithful minister, and exposed him to the
violent persecutions of his enemies. Among other fri∣volous
crimes objected to him, he was accused of gain∣ing
the King's affections by enchantment, and of pur∣loining
from the royal treasury a gem, which had the
virtue to render the wearer invulnerable, and of fending
this valuable curiosity to the prince of Wales<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 259.</NOTE>. The
nobility, who hated Hubert on account of his zeal in
<PB N="163" REF="184"/>
resuming the rights and possesions of the crown, no
sooner saw the opening, than they inflamed the King's
animosity against him, and pushed him to leek the total,
ruin of his minister. Hubert took sanctuary in a church:
The King ordered him to be dragged from thence: He
recalled those orders: He afterwards renewed them: He
was obliged by the clergy to restore him to the sanctuary:
He constrained him soon after to surrender himself priso∣ner,
and he confined him to the castle of the Devises.
Hubert made his escape, was expelled the kingdom, was
again received into favour, recovered a great share of
the King's confidence, but never showed any inclination
of re-instating himself in his power and authority<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 259, 260, 261. 266. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 41, 42. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 220, 221. M. West. p. 291. 301.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop of Winchester minister.</NOTE> who succeeded him in the government
of the King and kingdom, was Peter des Roches, bishop
of Winchester, a Poictevin by birth, who had been raised
by the late King, and who was no lets distinguished by
his arbitrary principles and violent conduct, than by his
courage and abilities. This prelate had been left by
King John justiciary and regent of the kingdom during
an expedition which that prince made into France; and
his illegal administration was one chief cause of that
great combination among the barons, which finally ex∣torted
from the crown the charter of liberties, and laid
the foundation of the English constitution. Henry, tho'
incapable, from his character, of pursuing the same vio∣lent
maxims, which had governed his father, had imbi∣bed
the same arbitrary principles; and in prosecution of
Peter's advice, he invited over a great number of Poicte∣vins
and other foreigners, who; he believed, could more
safely be trusted than the English, and who seemed requi∣site
to counterbalance the great and independant power
<PB N="164" REF="185"/>
of the nobility.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 263.</NOTE> Every office and command was be∣stowed
on these strangers; their rapacity exhausted the
revenues of the crown, already too much impoverished<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>;
they invaded the rights of the people; and their insolence,
still more provoking than their power, drew on them the
hatred and envy of all orders of men in the kingdom<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 258.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE barons formed a combination against this odious
ministry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1233</NOTE> and withdrew from their attendance in parliament;
on pretence of the danger, to which they were exposed from
the machinations of the Poictevins. When again summon∣ed
to attend, they gave for answer, that the King should
disimis his foreigners from court: Otherwise they would
drive both him and them out of the kingdom, and put the
crown on another head, more worthy of wearing it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p 265.</NOTE>: Such
was the style, which they used to their sovereign! They
at last came to parliament, but so well attended with
armed followers, that they seemed in a condition to pre∣scribe
laws to the King and ministry,. Peter des Roches,
however, had in the interval found means of sowing
diffention among the barons, and of bringing over to his
party the earl of Cornwal, as well as the earls of Lincoln
and Chester. The consederates were disconcerted in
their measures: Richard, earl Marischal, who had suc∣ceeded
to that dignity on the death of his brother, Wil∣liam,
was chased into Wales; he thence withdrew into
Ireland; where he was treacherously murdered by the
contrivance of the bishop of Winchester<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 219.</NOTE>. The estates
of the more obnoxious barons were confiscated, without
legal sentence or trial by their peers<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 265.</NOTE>; and were bestow∣ed
with a profuse liberality on the Poictevins. Peter
even carried his insolence so far as to say publicly, that
the barons of England must not pretend to put them∣selves
<PB N="165" REF="186"/>
on the same footing with those of France, or
assume the same liberties and privileges: The monarch
had a more absolute power in the one country than in
the other. It would have been more justisiable for him
to say, that men, so unwilling to submit to the authority
of laws, could with the worse grace claim any shelter or
protecion from them.</P>
<P>WHEN the King, at any time, was checked in his il∣legal
practices, and the authority of the great charter was
objected to him, he was wont to reply; “Why should
I observe a charter, which is neglected by all my grandees,
both prelates and nobility?” It was very reasonably re∣plied:
“You ought, sir, to set them the example.”<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 609.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So violent a ministry as that of the bishop of Win∣chester,
could not be of long duration; but its fall pro∣ceeded
at last from the influence of the church, not from
the efforts of the nobles. Edmond, the present primate,
came to court, attended by many of the other prelates;
and represented to the King the pernicious measures em∣braced
by Peter des Roches, the discontents of his people,
the ruin of his affairs; and after requiring the dismission
of the minister and his associates, threatened him with
the sentence of excommunication, in case of his refusal.
Henry, who knew that an excommunication, so agreeable

The bishop of Valence, a prelate of the house of
Savoy, and maternal uncle to the queen, was his chief
minister, and employed every art to amass wealth for him∣self
and his relations. Peter de Savoy, another brother
of the same family, was invested in the honour of Rich∣mond,
and received the rich wardship of earl Warrenne:
Boniface de Savoy was promoted to the see of Cantersbury:
Many young ladies were invited over from Pro∣vence,
and married to the chief noblemen of England,
who were the King's wards<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 484. M, West. p. 338.</NOTE>: And as the source of
Henry's bounty began to fail, his Savoyard ministry
applied to Rome, and obtained a bull; permitting him
to resume all past grants; absolving him from the oath,
which he had taken to maintain them; even enjoining
him to make such a resumption, and representing these
grants as invalid, on account of the prejudice which en∣sued from them to the Roman pontiff, in whom the su∣periority of the kingdom was vested<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 295. 301.</NOTE>. The opposition,
made to the intended resumption, prevented it from ta∣king
effect; but the nation faw the indignities, to which
the King was willing to submit, in order to gratify the
avarice of his foreign favourites. About the same time,
he published in England the sentence of excommunication,
denounced against the emperor Frederic, his brother in
law<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 383.</NOTE> and said in excuse, that, being the Pope's vassal,
he was obliged by his allegiance to obey all the com∣mands
of his holiness. In this weak reign, when any
neighbour insulted the King's dominions, instead of ta∣king
revenge for the injury, he complained to the Pope
<PB N="167" REF="188"/>
as his superior lord, and begged him to give protection<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grievances.</NOTE>
to his vassal<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 150.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE resentment of the English barons rose high at the
preference given to foreigners; but no remonsrrances and
complaints could ever prevail on the king to abandon
them, or even to moderate his attachment towards them.
After the Proven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als and Savoyards might have been sup∣posed
pretty well satiated with the dignities and riches,
which they had acquired, a new let of hungry foreigners
were invited over, and shared among them those favours,
which the King ought in policy to have conferred on
the English nobility, by whom his government could
have been supported and defended. His mother, Isabella,
who had been unjustly taken by the late King from the
count de la Marche, to whom she was betrothed, was
no sooner mistress of herself by the death of her husband,
than the married that nobleman<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 174.</NOTE>; and she had born him
four sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1247.</NOTE> Guy, William, Geoffrey, and Aymer, whom
she sent over into England to pay a visit to their brother.
The good-natured and affectionate disposition of Henry
was moved at the fight of such near relations; and he
confidered neither his own circumstances, nor the hu∣mours
of his people, in the honours and riches, which
he conferred upon them.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 491. M. West. p. 338. Knyghton, p. 2436.</NOTE>. Complaints rote as loud
against the credit of the Gascon as ever they had done
against that of the Poictevin and Savoyard favourites; and
to a nation prejudiced against them, all their measures
appeared criminal and exceptionable. Violations of the
great charter were frequently mentioned; and it is in∣deed
more than likely, that foreigners, ignorant of the
laws, and relying on the boundless affections of a weak
prince, would, in an age, when a regular administration
was not any where known, pay more attention to their
<PB N="168" REF="189"/>
own prevent interest than to the liberties of the people.
It is reported, that the Poictevins and other strangers,
when the laws were at any time appealed to, in opposi∣tion
to their oppressions, scrupled not to reply, <HI>What did
the English laws signify to them? They minded them not.</HI>
And as words are often more offensive than actions, this
open contempt of the English tended much to aggravate
the general discontent, and made every act of violence,
committed by the foreigners, appear not only an injury,
but an affront to them<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 566. 666. Ann. Waverl. p. 214. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 335.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IRECKON not among the violations of the great charter
some arbitrary exertions of prerogative, which Henry's
necessities obliged him to practise, and which, without
producing any discontent, were uniformly continued
by all his successors, till the last century. As the par∣liament
often refused him supplies, and that in a manner
somewhat rude and indecent<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 301.</NOTE>, he obliged his opulent
subjects, particularly the citizens of London, to grant
him loans of money; and it is natural to imagine, that
the same want of oeconomy, which reduced him to the
necessity of borrowing, would prevent him from being
very punctual in the payment<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 406.</NOTE>. He demanded benevo∣lences
or pretended voluntary contributions from his no∣bility
and prelates<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 507.</NOTE>. He was the first King of England
since the conquest, who could fairly be said to lye under
the restraint of law; and he was also the first who prac∣tised
the dispensing power, and employed the famous
clausc of <HI>Non-obsiante</HI> in his grants and patents. When
objections were made to this novelty, he replied, that
the Pope exercised that authority; and why might he not
imitate the example? But the abuse, which the Pope
made of his dispensing power, in violating the canons of
<PB N="169" REF="190"/>
general councils, in invading the privileges and customs
of all particular churches, and in usurping on the rights
of patrons, was more likely to excite the jealousy of the
people, than to reconcile them to a similar practice in
their civil government. Roger de Thurkesby, one of
the King's justices, was so displeased with the precedent,
that he exclaimed, <HI>Alas! what times, are we fallen into?
Behold, the civil court is corrupted in imitation of the eccle∣siastical,
and the river is poisoned from that fountain.</HI></P>
<P>THE King's partiality and profuse bounty to his fo∣reign
relations, and to their friends and favourites, would
have appeared more tolerable to the English, had any thing
been done mean-while for the honour of the nation, or had
Henry's enterprizes in foreign countries, been attended
with any success or glory to himself or to the public: At
least, such military talents in the King would have served
to keep his barons in awe, and have given weight and
authority to his government. But tho' he declared war
against Lewis IX. in 1242, and made an expedition into
Guienne, upon the invitation of his father in law, the
count de la Marche, who promised to join him with all
his forces; he was unsuccessful in his attempts against
that great monarch, was worsted at Taillebourg; was de∣serted
by his allies, lost what remained to him of Poictou,
and was obliged to return, with some loss of honour, into
England<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 393, 394. 398, 399. 405. W. Heming, p. 574. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 153.</NOTE>. The Gascon nobility were attached to the
English government; because the distance of their so∣vereign
allowed them to remain in a state of almost total
independance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1253.</NOTE> And they claimed, fome time after, the
King's protection against. an invasion, which the King
of Castile made upon that territory. Henry returned in∣to
Guienne, and was more successful in this expedition;
<PB N="170" REF="191"/>
but he thereby involved himself and his nobility in an
enormous debt, which both encreased their discontents,
and exposed him to greater danger from their enter∣prizes<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 614.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WANT of oeconorny and an ill judged liberality were
Henry's great defects; and his debts, even before this
expedition, had become so troublesome to him, that he
sold all his plate and jewels, in order to discharge them,
When this expedient was first proposed, he asked, where
he would find purchasers? It was replied, the citizens of
London. <HI>On my word,</HI> faid he, <HI>if the treasury of Augustus
were brought to market, the citizens are able to be the purcha∣sers:
These clowns, who assume to themselves the name of ba∣rons,
abound in every thing, while we are reduced to necessties</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 501.</NOTE>.
And he was thenceforth observed to be more forward and
greedy in his exactions upon the citizens<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 501. 507. 518. 578. 606. 625. 648.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the grievances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesiasti∣cal grievan∣ces.</NOTE> which the English had reason
to complain of in the civil government during this reign,
seem to have been still less grievous than those which
they underwent from the usurpations and exactions
of the court of Rome. On the death of Langton in
1228, the monks of Christ-church elected Walter de
Hemesham, one of their own body, for his successor:
But as Henry refused to confirm the election, the Pope,
at his desire, annulled it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 244.</NOTE>; and immediately appointed
Richard, chancellor of Lincoln, for archbishop, without
waiting for a new election. On the death of Richard in
1231, the monks elected Ralph de Neville bishop of Chi∣chester;
and tho' Henry was much pleased with the elec∣tion,
the Pope, who thought that prelate too much at∣tached
to the crown, assumed the power of annulling his
election<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 254.</NOTE>. He rejected two clergymen more, whom the
<PB N="171" REF="192"/>
monks had successively chosen; and he at last told them,
that, if they would elect Edmond, treasurer of the church
of Salisbury, he would confirm their choice; and his no∣mination
was complied with. The Pope had the pru∣dence
to appoint both times very worthy primates; but
men could not forbear observing his intention of thus
drawing gradually to himself the right of bestowing that
important dignity.</P>
<P>THE avarice, however, more than ambition of the see
of Rome, seems to have been in this age the ground of
general complaint; and the papal ministers, finding a vastsstock
of power, amassed by their predecessors, were desi∣rous
of turning it to present profit, which they enjoyed
at home, rather than of enlarging their authority in di∣stant
countries, where they never intended to reside.
Every thing was become venal in the Romish tribunals;
simony was openly practised; no favours and even no
justice could be obtained without a bribe; the highest
bidder was sure to have the preference, without regard
either to the merits of the person or of the cause; and
besides the usual perversions of right in the decision of
controversies, the Pope openly assumed an absolute and
uncontroled authority of setting aside, by the plenitude
of his apostolic power, all particular rules and privileges
of patrons, churches and convents<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 290. 308. 345. 375. 421. 469. 483. 537. 609. Ann. Burt, p. 309. M. West. p. 305. 313. 333. 336.</NOTE>. On pretence of re∣medying
these abuses, Pope Honorius, in 1226, com∣plaining
of the poverty of his see as the source of all grie∣vances,
demanded from every cathedral two of the best
prebends, and from every convent two monks portions,
to be set apart as a perpetual and settled revenue of the
papal crown; but all men being sensible, that the reve∣nue
would continue for ever, and the abuses immediately
<PB N="172" REF="193"/>
return, his demand was unanimously rejected<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 226, 227, 228. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 161. M. West. p. 284.</NOTE>. About
three years after, the Pope demanded and obtained the
tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues, which he levied in a
very oppressive manner; requiring payment before the
clergy had drawn their rents or tythes, and sending
about usurers, who advanced them the money at exorbi∣tant
interest<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 248.</NOTE>. In the year 1240, Otho, the legate,
having in vain attempted the clergy in a body, obtained
separately, by intrigues and menaces, large sums from
the prelates and convents, and on his departure is said to
have carried more money out of the kingdom than he
left in it<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 355. 360, 361. 366. 371.</NOTE>. This experiment was renewed four years
after with equal success by Martin the nuncio, who
brought from Rome powers of suspending and ex∣communicating
all clergymen, that resused to comply
with his demands<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 434.</NOTE>. The King, who relied on the Pope
for the support of his tottering authority, never failed to
countenance these exactions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 376. 612. 613.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN while, all the chief benefices of the kingdom
were conferred on Italians; great numbers of that na∣tion
were sent over at one time to be provided for; non∣residence
and pluralities were carried to an enormous
height; Mansel, the King's chaplain, is computed to
have held at once seven hundred ecclesiastical livings<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M, Paris, p. 575. M. West. p. 383.</NOTE>;
and the abuses became too great and palpable even for the
blindness and patience of superstition any longer to endure
them. The populace, entering into associations, rose in tu∣mults
against the Italian clergy; pillaged their barns;
wasted their fields; insulted the persons of such of them as
<PB N="173" REF="194"/>
they found in the kingdom<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 323. M. Paris, p. 255, 257. Ann. Burt. p. 280, 281. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 207.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII.</NOTE> and when the justiciaries
made enquiry into the authors of this disorder, the guilt was
found to involve so many, and those of such high rank,
that it passed unpunished. At last, when Innocent IV.
in 1245, called a general council at Lyons, in order to
excommunicate the emperor Frederic, the King and no∣bility
sent over agents to complain before the council of
the avarice of the Romish church; and they represented
among many other grievances, that the benefices of the
Italian clergy in England had been estimated, and
were found to amount to 60,000 marks<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Innocent's bull in Rymer, vol. i. p. 471. says only 50,000 marks a year.</NOTE> a year, a sum
which exceeded the annual revenue of the crown itself<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 451. The customs were part of Henry's revenue, and amounted to 6000 pounds a year: They were at first small sums paid by the merchants for the use of the King's warehouses, measures, weights, &amp;c. See Gilbert's history of the Exch. p. 214.</NOTE>.
They obtained only an evasive answer from the Pope;
but as mention had been made before the council, of
the feudal subjection of England to the see of Rome, the
English agents, at whose head was Roger Bigod, earl of
Norfolk, exclaimed against that pretension, and insisted,
that King John had no right, without the consent of
his barons, to subject the kingdom to so ignominious a
servitude<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 460.</NOTE>. The Popes indeed, afraid of carrying mat∣ters
too far against England, seem thenceforth to have
little insisted on that exorbitant pretension.</P>
<P>THIS check, received at the council of Lyons, was
not able to stop the court of Rome in its career: Inno∣cent
exacted the revenues of all vacant benefices, the
<PB N="174" REF="195"/>
twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues without excep∣tion;
the third of such as exceeded a hundred marks a
year; the half of such as were possessed by non∣residents<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 480. Ann. Burt. p. 305, 373.</NOTE>.
He claimed the goods of all intestate clergymen<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 474.</NOTE>; he
pretended a title to inherit all money got by usury; he
levied voluntary contributions from the people; and
when the King, contrary to his usual practice, prohi∣bited
these exactions, he threatened to denounce against
him the same censures, which he had emitted against the emperor, Frederic<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 476.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the most oppressive expedient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1255</NOTE> employed by the
Popc, was the embarking Henry in an enterprize for the
conquest of Naples, or Sicily on this side the Fare, as
it was called; an affair, which threw much dishonour
on the King, and involved him, during some years, in
great expence and trouble. The Romish church, taking
advantage of favourable incidents, had reduced the king∣dom
of Sicily to the same state of feudal vassalage,
which the pretended to extend over England, and which,
by reason of the distance, as well as high spirit of this
latter kingdom, she was not able to maintain. After
the death of the emperor, Frederic II. the succession of
Sicily devolved to Conradine, grandson to that monarch;
and Mainfroy, his natural son, under pretence of go∣verning
the kingdom during the infancy of the prince,
had formed a scheme of establishing his own authority.
Pope Innocent IV. who had carried on violent war against
the emperor, Frederic, and endeavoured to dispossess him
of his Italian dominions, still continued hostilities against
his grandson; but being disappointed in all his schemes
by the activity and artisices of Mainfroy, he found, that
his own force alone was not sufficient to bring to a
<PB N="175" REF="196"/>
happy issue so great an enterprise. He pretended to dis∣pose
of the Sicilian crown, both as superior lord of that
particular kingdom, and as vicar of Christ, to whom all
kingdoms of the earth were subjected; and he made a
tender of it to Richard earl of Cornwal, whose immense riches,
he flattered himself, would be able to support
the military operations against Mainfroy. As Richard
had the prudence to refuse the present<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 650.</NOTE>, he applied to
the King, whose levity and thoughtless disposition gave
him more hopes of success; and he offered him the
crown of Sicily for his second son, Edmond<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, p. 502. 512. 530. M. Paris, p 599 613.</NOTE>. Henry,
allured by so magnificent a gift, without reflecting on the
consequences, without consulting either with his brother
or the parliament, accepted of this insidious proposal;
and gave the Pope unlimited credit to expend whatever
sums he thought necessary for compleating the conquest
of Sicily. Innocent, who was engaged by his own interests
to make war with Mainfroy, was glad to carry
on his enterprises at the expence of his ally: Alexander
IV. who succeeded him in the papal throne, continued
the same policy: And Henry was surprized to find himself
on a sudden involved in an immense debt, which he
had never been consulted in contracting. The sum already
amounted to 135541 marks beside interest<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 587. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 319.</NOTE>; and he had
the prospect, if he answered this demand, of being soon
loaded with more exorbitant expences; if he refused it,
of both incurring the Pope's displeasure, and of losing
the crown of Sicily, which he hoped soon to have the
glory of fixing on the head of his son.</P>
<P>HE applied to the parliament for supply; and that he
might be secure of not meeting with opposition, he sent,
no writs to the more refractory barons: But even those
<PB N="176" REF="197"/>
who were summoned, sensible of the ridiculous cheat
imposed. by the Pope, determined not to lavish their
money on such chimerical projects, and making a pre∣text
of the absence of their brethren, they refused to
take the King's demands into consideration<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 614.</NOTE>. In this
extremity the clergy were his only resource; and as both
their temporal and spiritual sovereign concurred in loading
them, they were ill able to defend themselves against
this united authority.</P>
<P>THE Pope published a crusade for the conquest of Si∣cily;
and required every one, who had taken the cross
against the infidels, or had vowed to advance money for
their enterprize, to turn the war against Mainfroy, a more
terrible enemy to the christian faith than any Saracen<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 547, 548. &amp;c.</NOTE>,
He levied a tenth on all ecclesiastical benefices in Eng∣land
for three years; and gave orders to excommunicate
all bishops, who made not punctual payment. He granted
to the King the goods of intestate clergymen; the re∣venues
of vacant benefices; the revenues of all non-re∣sidents<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 597, 598.</NOTE>.
But these taxations, being levied by some rule,
were deemed less grievous, than another arbitrary imposition,
which arose from the suggestion of the bishop of
Hereford, and which might have opened the door to end-less
and intolerable abuses.</P>
<P>THAT prelate, who resided at the court of Rome by
a deputation from the English church, drew bills of different
values, but amounting on the whole to 150540
marks, on all the bishops and abbots of the kingdom;
and granted these bills to Italian merchants, who, it was
pretended, had advanced money for the service of the
war against Mainfroy<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M, Paris, p. 612. 628. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 54.</NOTE>. As there was no likelihood of
the English prelates submitting, without compulsion, to
<PB N="177" REF="198"/>
such an extraordinary demand, Rustand, the legate,
was charged with the office of employing his authority
to that purpose; and he summoned an assembly of the
bishops and abbots, whom he acquainted with the Pope's
and the King's pleasure. Great were the surprize and
indignation of the assembly at the imposition: The bi∣shop
of Worcester exclaimed, that he would lose his life
rather than comply: The bishop of London said, that
the Pope and King were more powerful than he; but
if his mitre were taken off his head, he would clap on
a helmet in its place<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 614.</NOTE>. The legate was no less violent
on the other hand; and he told the assembly, in plain
terms, that all ecclesiastical benefices were the property
of the Pope, and he might dispose of them, either in
whole or in part, as he saw proper<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 619.</NOTE>. In the end, the
bishops and abbots, being threatened with excommuni∣cation,
which made all their revenues fall into the
King's hands, were obliged to submit to the exaction:
And the only mitigation which the legate allowed them,
was, that the tenths, already granted, should be ac∣cepted
as a partial payment of the bills. But the money
was still insufficient for the Pope's purpose: The conquest
of Sicily was as remote as ever: The demands
which came from Rome were endless: Pope Alexander
became so urgent a creditor, that he sent over a legate
into England; threatening the kingdom with an interdict,
and the King with excommunication, if the arrears,
which he pretended to be due to him, were not
instantly remitted<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 624. M. Paris, p. 648.</NOTE>: And at last, Henry, sensible of the
cheat, began to thing of breaking off the agreement,
and of resigning into the Pope's hands that crown,
which, it was not intended by Alexander, that he or
his family should ever enjoy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 630.</NOTE>.</P>

THE earl of Cornwal had now reason to value him∣self
on his foresight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earl of Cornwal elected King of the Romans.</NOTE> in refusing the fraudulent bargain
with Rome, and in preferring the solid honours of an opu∣lent

the empty and precarious glory of a foreign dig∣nity
But he had not always firmness sufficient to ad∣here
to this resolution: His vanity and ambition prev∣ailed
at last over his prudence and his avarice; and he
was engaged in an enterprize equally expensive and vex∣atious
as that of his brother, and not attended with
much greater probability of success. The immense optu∣lence
of Richard having made the German princes cast
their eye on him as a candidate for the empire; he was
tempted to expend vast sums of money on his election,
and he succeeded so far as to be chosen King of the Ro∣man,
which seemed to render his fuccession infallible
to the imperial throne. He went over into Germany,
and carried out of the kingdom no less a sum than seven
hundred thousand marks, if we may believe the account
of some antient authors<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 638. The same author, a few pages before, makes Ri∣chard's treasures amount to little more than half the sum. p. 634. The King's dissipations and expences, throughout his whole reign, ac∣cording to the same author, had amounted only to about 940,000 marks, p. 638.</NOTE>, which is probably much ex∣aggerated<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">The sums mentioned by antient authors, who were all monks, are often improbable, and never consistent.

procure a splendid title, and that his absence from England,
joined to the weakness of his brother's government,
gave reins to the factious and turbulent dispositrons of
the English barons, and involved his own country and
family in infinite calamities.</P>
<P>THE successsul revolt of the nobility from Kins:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents of the barons.</NOTE> John,
and their imposing on him and his successors limitations
of the royal power, had made them feel their own weight
and importance, had set a dangerous precedent of resist∣ance,
and being followed by a long, minority, had im∣poverished,
as well as weakened that crown, which they
were at last induced, from the fear of worse consequen∣ces,
to re-place on the head of young Henry. In the
King's situation, either great abilities and vigour were
requisite to overawe the barons, or great caution and re∣serve
to give them no pretence for complaints; and it
must be consessed, that this prince was possessed of neither
of these talents. He had not prudence to choose
right measures; he wanted even that constancy, which
sometimes gives weight to wrong ones; he was entirely
abandoned to his favourites, who were always foreigners;
he lavished on them without discretion his diminished re∣venue
and finding, that his barons indulged their dis∣position
towards tyranny, and observed not to their own
vassals the same, rules, which they had imposed on the
crown, he was apt, in his administration, to neglect all
the salutary articles of the great charter; which he remarked
to be so little regarded by his nobility. This
conduct had extremely lessened his authority in the kingdom;
had multiplied complaints against him; and had
frequently exposed him to assronts, and even to danger∣ous
attempts upon his prerogative. In the year 1244,
<PB N="180" REF="201"/>
when he desired a supply from parliament, the barons,
complaining of the frequent breaches of the great char∣ter,
and of the many fruitless applications which they
had formerly made for the redress of this and other
grievances, demanded in return that he should give them
the nomination of the great justiciary and of the chan∣cellor,
to whose hands chiefly the administration of justice
was committed; and, if we may credit the historian<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 432.</NOTE>,
they had formed the plan of other limitations, as well
as of associations to maintain them, which would have
reduced the King to be an absolute cypher, and have
held the crown in perpetual pupillage and dependance.
The King, to satisfy them, would agree to nothing but
a renewal of the charter, and a general permission to ex∣communicate
all the violators of it: And he received no
other supply, except their consent to levy a scutage of
twenty shillings on each knight's fee for the marriage of
his eldest daughter to the King of Scotland; a burthen,
which was expressly annexed to their feudal tenures.</P>
<P>FOUR years after, in a very full parliament, when
Henry demanded a new supply, he was openly reproached
with the breach of his word, and the frequent viola∣tions
of the charter. He was asked, whether he did not
blush to desire any aid from his people, whom he profes∣sedly
hated and despised, to whom on all occasions he
preferred aliens and foreigners, and who groaned under
the oppressions, which he either permitted or exercised
over them. He was told, that, besides disparaging his
nobility by forcing them to contract unequal and mean
marriages with strangers, no rank of men were so low as
to escape vexations from him or his ministers; that even
the victuals consumed in his houshold, the cloaths which
himself and his servants wore, still more the wine, which
they used, were all taken by violence from the lawful
<PB N="181" REF="202"/>
owners, and no compensation was ever made them for
the injury; that foreign merchants, to the great preju∣dice
and infamy of the kingdom, shunned the English
harbours, as if they were possessed by pyrates, and the
commerce with all nations was thus cut off by these vio∣lences;
that lots was added to lots, and injury to injury,
while the merchants, who had been despoiled of their
goods, were also obliged to carry them at their own
charges to whatever place the King was pleased to ap∣point
them; that even the poor fishermen on the coast
could not escape his oppressions and those of his courtiers,
and finding that they had not the full liberty of disposing
of their commodities in the English market, were fre∣quently
constrained to carry them to foreign ports, and
to hazard all the perils of the ocean rather than those
which awaited them from his oppressive emissaries; and
that his very religion was a ground of complaint to his
subjects, while they observed, that the waxen tapers and
splendid silks, employed in so many useless processions,
were the spoils which he had forcibly ravished from the
true possessors<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 498. See farther▪ p. 578. M. West. p. 348.</NOTE>. Throughout this remonstrance, in
which the complaints, derived from an abuse of the an∣tient
right of purveyance, may be supposed to be some∣what
exaggerated, there appears a strange mixture of re∣gal
tyranny in the practices which gave rise to it, and of
aristocratical liberty or rather licentiousness in the expres∣sions
employed by the parliament. But a mixture of
this kind is observable in all the antient feudal govern∣ments;
and both of them proved equally hurtful to the
people.</P>
<P>As the King, in answer to their remonstrance, gave
the parliament only good words and fair promises, at∣tended
with the most humble submissions, which they
had often found deceitful, he obtained at that time no
<PB N="182" REF="203"/>
supply; and therefore in the year 1253, when he
found himself again under the necessity of applying to parliament,
he had provided himself of a new pretence, which
he deemed infallible, and taking the vow of a Crusade
to the holy land, he demanded their assistance in that pi∣ous
enterprize<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 518, 558, 568. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 293.</NOTE>. The parliament, however, for some
time scrupled compliance; and the ecclesiastical order sent
a deputation of four prelates, the primate, the bishops of
Winchester, Salisbury, and Carlisle, in order to remon∣strate
with him on his frequent violations of their privi∣leges,
the oppressions with which he loaded them and
all his subjects<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 568.</NOTE>, and the uncanonical and forced electi∣ons,
which were made to vacant dignities. “It is true,”
replied the King,
“I have been somewhat faulty in this
particular: I obtruded you, my lord of Canterbury,
upon your see: I was obliged to employ both entrea∣ties
and menaces, my lord of Wincheser, to have
you elected: my proceedings were very irregular, my
lords of Salisbury and Carlisle, when I raised you from
the lowest nations to your present dignities: I am de∣termined
henceforth to correct these errors; and it
will also become you, in order to make a thorough
reformation, to resign your present benefices; and try
to enter again in a more regular and canonical man∣ner
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 579.</NOTE>.” The bishops, surprized at these unexpected
sarcasms, replied, that the question was not at present
how to correct past errors, but to avoid them for the future.
The King promised redress both of ecclesiastical
and civil grievances; and the parliament in return agreed
to grant him a supply, a tenth of the ecclesiastical be∣nefices
and a scutage of three marks on each knight's
fee: But as they had experienced his frequent breach of
promise, they required, that he should ratify the great
<PB N="183" REF="204"/>
charter in a manner still more authentic and solemn than
any which he had ever hitherto employed. All the pre∣lates
and abbots were assembled: They held burning
tapers in their hands: The great charter was read before
them: They denounced the sentence of excommunica∣tion
against every one who should thenceforth violate that
fundamental law: They threw their tapers on the
ground, and exclaimed, <HI>May the soul of every one, who
incurs this sentence, so stink and corrupt in Hell!</HI> The King
bore a part in this ceremony: and subjoined;
“So help
me God, I will keep all these things inviolate, as I
am a man, as I am a christian, as I am a knight, and
as I am a King crowned and anointed<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 580. Ann. Burt. p. 323. Ann. Waverl. p. 210. W. Heming. p. 571. M. West. p. 353.</NOTE>.” Yet was
the tremendous ceremony no sooner finished, than his
favourites, abusing his weakness and facility, made him
return to the same arbitrary and irregular administration;
and the reasonable expectations of his people were thus
continually eluded and disappointed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 597, 608.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL these imprudent and illegal measures afforded a
pretence to Simon de Mountfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1258</NOTE> earl of Leicester,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simon de Mountfort earl of Lei∣cester.</NOTE> to
attempt an innovation in the government, and to wrest
the scepter from the feeble and irresolute hand which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. This nobleman was a younger son of that Si∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mountfort, who had conducted with such valour
and renown the Crusade against the Albigenses, and who,
tho' he tarnished his famous exploits by cruelty and am∣bition,
had left a name very precious to all the bigots of
that age, particularly to the ecclesiastics. A large inhe∣ritance
in England fell by succession to this, family; but
as the elder brother enjoyed still more opulent possessions
in France, and could not perform fealty to two masters,
he transferred his right to Simon, his younger brother,
<PB N="184" REF="205"/>
who came over into England, did homage for his lands,
and was raised to the dignity of earl of Leicester. In the
year 1238, he espoused Eleanor dowager of William earl
of Pembroke, and sister to the King<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 314.</NOTE>; but the marriage
of this princess with a subject and a foreigner, though
finished with Henry's consent, was loudly complained of
by the earl of Cornwal, and all the barons of England;
and Leicester was supported against their violence, en∣tirely
by the King's favour and authority<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M, Paris, p. 315</NOTE>. But he had
no sooner established himself in his possessions and digni∣ties,
than he acquired by insinuation and address, a strong
interest with the nation, and gained equally the affections
of all orders of men. He lost, however, the friendship
of Henry from the usual levity and fickleness of that
prince; he was banished the court; he was recalled; he
was entrusted with the command of Guienne<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 459, 51<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, where he
did good service and acquired honour; he was again dis∣graced
by the King, and his banishment from court
seemed now final and irrevocable. Henry called him a
traitor to his face: Leicester gave him the lye, and told
him, that, if he were not his sovereign, he would soon
make him repent of that insult. Yet was this quarrel
accommodated either from the good-nature or timidity
of the King; and Leicester was again admitted into
some degree of favour and authority. But as this noble∣man
was become too great to preserve an entire complai∣sance
to Henry's humours, and to act in subserviency to
his other minions; he found more advantage in cultivat∣ing
his interest with the public, and in inflaming the ge∣neral
discontents, which prevailed against the administra∣tion.
He filled every place with complaints against the
infringement of the great charter, the violences commit∣ted
on the people, the combination between the Pope
<PB N="185" REF="206"/>
and the King in their tyranny and extortions, Henry's
neglect of his native subjects and barons; and tho' him∣self
a foreigner, he was more loud than any in represent∣ing
the indignity of submitting to the dominion of fo∣reigners.
By his hypocritical pretensions to devotion,
he gained the favour of the zealots and clergy: By his
seeming concern for public good, he acquired the affec∣tions
of the public: And besides the private friendships,
which he had cultivated with the barons, his animosity
against the favourites bred an union of interests between
him and that powerful order.</P>
<P>A RECENT quarrel, which broke out between Leicester
and William de Valence, Henry's half brother, and chief
favourite, brought matters to extremity<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 649.</NOTE>, and deter∣mined
the former to give full scope to his bold and un∣bounded
ambition, which the laws and the King's au∣thority
had hitherto with difficulty restrained. He se∣cretly
called a meeting of the most considerable barons,
particularly Humphrey de Bohun, high constable, Roger
Bigod, earl mareschal, and the earls of Warwick and
Glocester; men, who by their family and possessions
stood in the first rank of the English nobility. He repre∣sented
to this company the necessity of reforming the
state, and of putting the execution of the laws into other
hands than those which had hitherto appeared, from re∣peated
experience, so unfit for the charge, with which
they were entrusted. He exaggerated the oppressions of
the lower orders of the state, the violations of the barons'
privileges, the continued plunder of the clergy; and in order
to aggravate the enormity of this conduct, he appealed to
the great charter, which Henry had so often ratified, and
which was calculated to prevent for ever the return of these
intolerable grievances. He magnified the generosity of their
ancestors, who, at an infinite expence of blood, had ex∣torted
<PB N="186" REF="207"/>
that famous concession from the crown; but la∣mented
their own degeneracy, who allowed so great an
advantage, once obtained, to be wrested from them by a
weak prince and by insolent strangers. And he insisted,
that the King's word, after so many submissions and
fruitless promises on his part, could no longer be relied on;
and that nothing but his absolute inability to violate na∣tional
privileges could henceforth ensure the regular ob∣servance
of them.</P>
<P>THESE topics, which were founded in truth, and suit∣ed
so well the sentiments of the company, had the desired
effect; and the barons entered into a resolution of re∣dressing
the public grievances, by taking into their own
hands the administration of the government. The King
having summoned a parliament, in expectation of receiv∣ing
supplies for his Sicilian project, the barons appeared
in the hall, clad in complete armour, and with their
swords by their side; and the King on his entry,. struck
with this unusual appearance, asked them what was their
meaning, and whether they pretended to make him their
prisoner<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Annal. Theokesbury.</NOTE>? Roger Bigod replied in the name of the rest,
that he was not their prisoner, but their sovereign; that
they even intended to grant him large supplies, in order
to fix his son on the throne of Sicily; that they only ex∣pected
some return for this expence and service; and
that, as he had frequently made submissions to the parlia∣ment,
had acknowledged his past errors, and had still allow∣ed
himself to be carried into the same path, which gave
them such just reason of complaint, he must now yield to
more strict regulations, and confer authority on those
who were able and willing to redress the public grievan∣ces.
Henry, partly allured by the hopes of supply,
partly intimidated by the union and martial appearance
of the barons, agreed to their demand; and promised to
<PB N="187" REF="208"/>
summon another parliament at Oxford, in order to digest
the new plan of government, and to elect the persons,
who were to be entrusted with the chief authority.</P>
<P>THIS parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 June.</NOTE> which the royalists,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provisions of Oxford.</NOTE> and even the
nation, from experience of the confusions that attended
its measures, afterwards denominated the <HI>mad parliament,</HI>
met on the day appointed; and as all the barons brought
along with them their military vassals, and appeared with
an armed force, the King, who had taken no precautions
against them, was in reality a prisoner in their hands,
and was obliged to submit to all the terms which they
were pleased to impose upon him. Twelve barons were
selected fron the King's council; twelve more were
chosen by parliament: To these twenty-four, unlimited
authority was granted of reforming the state; and the
King himself took an oath, that he would maintain
whatever ordinances they should think proper to enact for
that purpose<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 655. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 334. Knygh∣ton, p. 2445.</NOTE>. Leicester was at the head of this supreme
council, to which the legislative power was thus in reality
transferred; and all their measures were taken by his
secret influence and direction. Their first step bore a
specious appearance, and seemed well calculated for the
end, which they professed to be the object of all these in∣novations:
They ordered that four knights should be
chosen by each county; that they should make enquiry
into the grievances of which their neighbourhood had
reason to complain, and should attend the next ensuing
parliament, in order to give information to that assembly
of the state of their particular counties<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 657. Addit. p. 140. Ann. Burt. p. 412.</NOTE>: A nearer ap∣proach
to our present constitution than had been made
by the barons in the reign of King John, when the
knights were only appointed to meet in their counties,
<PB N="188" REF="209"/>
and there to draw up a detail of their grievances. Mean
while, the twenty-four barons proceeded to enact some
regulations, in order to provide a redress for such griev∣ances
as were supposed to be notorious to all the world.
They ordered, that three sessions of parliament should be
regularly held every year, in the months of February,
June, and October; that a new high sheriff should be
elected every year by the votes of the freeholders in each
county<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 336.</NOTE>; that the sheriffs should have no power of
fining the barons who did not attend at their courts, or
the circuits of the justiciaries; that no heirs should be
committed to the wardship of foreigners, and no castles
be entrusted to their custody; and that no new warrens
or forests should be created, nor the revenues of any
counties or hundreds be let to farm. Such were the regulations
which the twenty-four barons enacted at Ox∣ford,
for the redress of public grievances<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ann Burt. p. 413.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the earl of Leicester and his associates, having advan∣ced
so far to satisfy the nation, instead of continuing in this
popular course, or granting the King that supply which
they had promised him, immediately made provisions for
the extension and continuance of their own exorbitant authority.
They rouzed anew the popular clamour, which
had long prevailed against foreigners; and they fell with
the utmost violence on the King's half-brothers, who
were supposed to be the authors of all national grievan∣ces,
and whom Henry had no longer any power to pro∣tect.
The four brothers, sensible of their danger, took
to flight with an intention of making their escape out of
the kingdom; they were eagerly pursued by the barons;
Aymer, one of the brothers, who had been elected to
the see of Winchester, took shelter in his episcopal pa∣lace,
and carried the others along with him; they were
surrounded in that place, and threatened to be dragged
<PB N="189" REF="210"/>
out by force, and to be punished for their crimes and
misdemeanors; and the King, pleading the sacredness
of an ecclesiastical sanctuary, was glad to extricate them
from this danger by banishing them the kingdom<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 654. Ann. Burt. p. 411. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 53. W. Heming. p. 579. Chron. Dunst. p. 335. M. West. p. 364. Ypod. Neust. p. 467. Knyghton, p. 2445.</NOTE>. In
this act of violence, as well as in the former usurpations
of the barons, the queen and her uncles were thought to
have secretly concurred, being jealous of the credit, ac∣quired
by the brothers, which, they imagined, had
eclipsed and annihilated their own<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 210.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the subsequent proceedings of the twenty-four
barons were sufficient to open the eyes of the whole king∣dom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Usurpations of the ba∣rons.</NOTE> and to prove their intention of reducing for ever
both the King and the people under the arbitrary power
of a very narrow aristocracy, which must at last have
terminated either in anarchy, or in a violent usurpation
and tyranny. They pretended, that they had not as yet
digested all the regulations necessary for the reformation
of the state, and for the redress of grievances; and that
they must still retain their power, till that great purpose
was thoroughly effectuated: In other words, that they
must be perpetual governors, and must continue to re∣form,
till they were pleased to demit their authority.
They formed an association among themselves, and swore
that they would stand by each other with their lives and
fortunes: They displaced all the chief officers of the
crown, the high justiciary, the chancellor, the trea∣surer;
and advanced either themselves or their own
creatures in their stead: Even the offices of the King's
houshold were disposed of at their pleasure: The gover∣nment
of all the castles was put into hands in whom they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound reason to confide: And the whole power of the
<PB N="188" REF="211"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="189" REF="212"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="190" REF="213"/>
state being thus transferred to them, they ventured to
impose an oath on every individual of the nation; in
which the subjects were obliged to swear, under the pe∣nalty
of being declared public enemies, that they would
obey and execute all the regulations, both known and
unknown, of the twenty-four barons: And all this, for
the greater glory of God, the honour of the church, the
service of the King, and the advantage of the kingdom<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 52.</NOTE>. No one dared to withstand this tyrannical authority:
Prince Edward himself, the King's eldest son, a youth
of eighteen years of age, who began to give indications
of that great and manly spirit, which appeared through∣out
the whole course of his life, was, after making some
opposition, constrained to take that oath, which really
deposed him and his family from sovereign authority<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ann. Burt. p. 411.</NOTE>.
Earl Warrenne was the last person in the kingdom, who could be brought to give the confederated barons this mark of submission.</P>
<P>BUT the twenty-four barons, not content with the
usurpation of the royal power, introduced an innovation
in the constitution of parliament, which was of the ut∣most
importance. They ordained, that that assembly
should choose a committee of twelve persons, who should,
in the intervals of the sessions, possess the authority of the
whole parliament, and should attend on a summons the
person of the King, in all his motions. But so power∣ful
were these barons, that this regulation was also sub∣mitted
to; the whole government was overthrown or
fixed on new foundations; and the monarchy was total∣ly
subverted, without it being possible for the King to
strike a single stroke in defence of the constitution against
the newly erected oligarchy.</P>
<P>THE report that the King of the Romans intended to
pay a visit to England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1259.</NOTE> gave alarm to the ruling barons;
<PB N="191" REF="214"/>
and they dreaded lest the extensive influence and establish∣ed
authority of that prince would be employed to restore
the prerogatives of his family, and overturn their new
plan of government<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 661.</NOTE>. They sent over the new bishop
of Worcester, who met him at St. Omars; asked him
in the name of the barons, the reason of his journey,
and how long he intended to stay in England; and insist∣ed,
that before he entered the kingdom, he should swear
to observe the regulations established at Oxford. On
Richard's refusal to take this oath, they prepared to resist
him as a public enemy; they fitted out a fleet, assembled
an army, and exciting the inveterate prejudices of the
people against foreigners, from whom they had suffered
so many oppressions, spread the report that Richard in∣tended
to restore by force the authority of his exiled bro∣thers,
and to violate all the securities provided for public
liberty. The King of the Romans was at last obliged to
submit to the terms required of him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 661, 662. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 53.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the barons, in proportion to their continuance
in power, began gradually to lose that popularity, which
had assisted them in obtaining it; and men repined that
regulations, which were only established during a time
for the reformation of the state, were likely to become
perpetual, and to subvert entirely the antient constitu∣tion.
They dreaded, that the power of the nobles, which
was always oppressive, would now exert itself without
controul, by removing the counterpoise of the crown;
and their apprehensions were encreased by some new
edicts of the barons, which were plainly calculated to
procure to themselves an impunity in all their violences.
They appointed, that the circuits of the itinerant jus∣tices,
the sole check on their arbitrary conduct, should
be held only once in seven years; and men easily saw,
<PB N="192" REF="215"/>
that a remedy, which returned after such long intervals,
against an oppressive power, which was perpetual, would
prove totally insignificant and useless<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 667. Trivet, p. 209.</NOTE>. The cry became
loud in the nation, that the barons should finish their
intended regulations. The knights of the shires, who
seem now to have been pretty regularly assembled in a
separate house, made remonstrances against the slowness
of their proceedings; they represented, that, though
the King had performed all the conditions required of
him, the barons had hitherto done nothing for the pub∣lic
good, and had been only careful to promote their own
private advantage, and to commit injury on the crown;
and they even appealed to prince Edward, and claimed
his interposal for the interests of the nation, and the re∣formation
of the government<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Annal. Burt. p. 427.</NOTE>. The prince replied, that
though it was from constraint, and contrary to his pri∣vate
sentiments, he had sworn to adhere to the provisions
of Oxford, he was determined to observe his oath: But
he sent a message to the barons, requiring them to bring
their undertaking to a speedy conclusion, and fulfil
their engagements to the public: Otherwise, he menaced
them, that, at the expence of his life, he would oblige
them to do their duty, and would shed the last drop of
his blood in promoting the interests, and satisfying the
just wishes of the nation<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Annal. Burt. p. 427.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE barons, urged by so pressing a necessity, publish∣ed
at last a new code of ordinances for the reformation
of the state<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Annal. Burt. p. 428, 439.</NOTE>: But the expectations of the people were
extremely disappointed, when they found, that these
consisted only of some trivial alterations on the municipal
law; and still more so, when the barons pretended, that
the task was not yet finished, and that they must farther
prolong their authority, in order to bring the work of
<PB N="193" REF="216"/>
reformation to the desired period. The current of popu∣larity
was now much turned to the side of the crown;
and the barons had little more to rely on for their sup∣port,
besides the private influence and power of their fa∣milies,
which, though exorbitant, was likely to prove
inferior to the combination of King and people. Even
this basis of power was daily weakened by their intestine
jealousies and animosities; their antient and inveterate
quarrels broke out when they came to divide the spoils of
the crown; and the rivalship between the earls of Lei∣cester
and Glocester, the chief leaders among them, be∣gan
to disjoint the whole confederacy. The latter, more
moderate in his pretensions, was desirous of stopping or
retarding the career of the barons' usurpations; but the
former, enraged at the opposition which he met with in
his own party, pretended to throw up all concern in
English affairs; and he retired into France<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 348.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of France, the only state with which
England had any considerable intercourse, was at this
time governed by Lewis IX. a prince of the most singu∣lar
character, which is to be met with in all the records
of history. This monarch united to the mean and abject
superstition of a monk, all the courage and magnanimity
of the greatest hero; and, what may be deemed more
extraordinary, the justice and integrity of the most disin∣terested
patriot, the mildness and humanity of the most
accomplished philosopher. So far from taking advantage
of the divisions of the English, or attempting to expel
those dangerous rivals from the provinces, which they
still possessed in France; he had entertained many scru∣ples
with regard to the forfeiture pronounced against the
King's father, had even expressed some intention of re∣storing
the other provinces, and he was only prevented
from taking that imprudent resolution, by the united re∣monstrances
<PB N="194" REF="217"/>
of his own barons, who represented the
extreme danger of such a measure<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p 604.</NOTE>, and, what had a
greater influence on Lewis, the justice of punishing by a
legal sentence the barbarity and felony of John. Where∣ever
this prince interposed in English affairs, it was al∣ways
with an intention of composing the differences be∣tween
the King and his nobility; he recommended to
both parties every peaceable and reconciling measure;
and he used all his authority with the earl of Leicester,
his native subject, to bend him to a compliance with
Henry.<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 May.</NOTE> He made a treaty with England, at a time,
when the distractions of that kingdom were at the great∣est
height, and when the King's authority was totally
annihilated; and the terms, which he granted, might,
even in a more prosperous state of their affairs, be deem∣ed
reasonable and advantageous by the English. He
yielded up some territories which had been conquered
from Poictou and Guienne; he ensured the peaceable
possession of the latter province to Henry; he agreed to
pay that prince a large sum of money; and he only
required that the King should, in return, make a final
cession to France of Normandy, and the other provinces,
which he could never entertain any hopes of recovering
by force of arms<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 675. M. Paris, p. 566. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 53. Trivet, p. 208. M. West. p. 371.</NOTE>. This cession was ratified by Henry,
by his two sons, and two daughters, and by the King
of the Romans and his three sons: Leicester alone, either
moved by a vain arrogance, or desirous to ingratiate
himself with the English populace, protested against the
deed, and insisted on the right, however distant, which
might accrue to his countess<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 53.</NOTE>. Lewis saw in this obsti∣nacy
the unbounded ambition of the man; and as the
barons insisted, that the money which was due by treaty,
<PB N="195" REF="218"/>
should be at their disposal, not at Henry's, he also saw,
and probably with regret, the low condition to which
this monarch, who had more erred from weakness than
malice, was reduced by the turbulency of his own sub∣jects.</P>
<P>BUT the situation of Henry changed soon after much
to his advantage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1261.</NOTE> The twenty-four barons had now en∣joyed
the sovereign power near three years; and had vi∣sibly
employed it, not for the reformation of the state,
which was their first pretence, but for the aggrandize∣ment
of themselves and of their families. The breach of
trust was apparent to all the world: Every order of men
felt and murmured against it: The dissentions among
the barons themselves, which encreased the evil, made
also the remedy more obvious and easy; And the secret
desertion in particular of the earl of Glocester to the
crown, seemed to promise Henry certain success in any
attempt to resume his authority. Yet dared he not to
take that step, so reconcilable both to justice and policy,
without making a previous application to Rome, and
obtaining an absolution from his oaths and engagements.</P>
<P>THE Pope was at that time very much dissatisfied with
the conduct of the barons; who, in order to gain the favour
of the people and clergy of England, had expelled all the
Italian ecclesiastics, had confiscated their benefices, and
seemed determined to maintain the liberties and privileges
of the English church, in which the rights of patronage,
belonging to their own families, were also included.
The extreme animosity of the English clergy against the
Italians, was also a source of his disgust to this order;
and an attempt which had been made by them for farther
liberty and independance on the civil power, was there∣fore
less acceptable to the court of Rome. About the
same time, that the barons at Oxford had annihilated
<PB N="196" REF="219"/>
the prerogatives of the monarchy, the clergy met in a
synod at Merton, and passed several decrees, which were
no less calculated to promote their own grandeur at the
expence of the crown. They decreed, that it was un∣lawful
to try the ecclesiastics by secular judges; that the
clergy were not to regard any prohibitions from civil
courts; that lay patrons had no right to confer spiritual
benefices; that the magistrate was obliged, without far∣ther
enquiry, to imprison all excommunicated persons;
and that antient usage, without any particular grant of
charter, was a sufficient authority for any clerical posses∣sions
or privileges<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ann. Burt. p. 389.</NOTE>. About a century ago, these claims
would have been sanctified by the court of Rome beyond
the most fundamental articles of faith: They were the
chief points maintained by the great martyr, Becket;
and his resolution in defending them had exalted him to
the high station which he held in the catalogue of Romish
saints: But principles were changed with the times:
The Pope was become somewhat jealous of the great in∣dependence
of the English church, which made them
stand less in need of his protection, and even emboldened
them to resist his authority, and complain of the prefer∣ence
given to the Italian courtiers, whose interests, it is
natural to imagine, were the chief object of his concern.
He was very ready, therefore, on the King's application,
to annul these new constitutions of the church of Eng∣land<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 755.</NOTE>.
And at the same time, he absolved the King
and all his subjects from the oath, which they had taken
to observe the provisions of Oxford<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 722. M. Paris, p. 666. W. Heming. p. 580. Ypod. Neust. p. 468. Knyghton, p. 2446.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRINCE Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Ed∣ward.</NOTE> whose enlarged thoughts, though
in such early youth, had taught him the great prejudice,
which his father had incurred, by his levity, inconstan∣cy
<PB N="197" REF="220"/>
and frequent breach of promise, refused for a long
time to take advantage of this absolution; and declared
that the provisions of Oxford, however unreasonable in
themselves, and however abused by the barons, ought
still to be adhered to by those who had sworn to observe
them<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 667.</NOTE>: He himself had been constrained by violence to
take that oath; yet was he determined to keep it. By
this scrupulous fidelity, the prince acquired the confidence
of all parties, and was afterwards enabled to recover
fully the royal authority, and to perform such great ac∣tions
both during his own reign and that of his father.</P>
<P>THE situation of England, during this period, as well
as that of most European kingdoms, was somewhat pe∣culiar.
There was no regular military force maintained
in the nation: The sword, however, was not, properly
speaking, in the hands of the people: The barons were
entrusted entirely with the defence of the community;
and after any effort, which they made, either against
their own prince, or against foreigners, as the military
retainers departed to their own home, the armies were
dissolved, and could not speedily be re-assembled at plea∣sure.
It was easy therefore, for a few barons, by a
combination, to get the start of the other party, to col∣lect
suddenly their troops, and to appear unexpectedly
in the field with an army, which their antagonists, though
equal or even superior in power and interest, would not
dare to encounter. Hence the sudden revolutions, which
were observable in these governments: Hence the fre∣quent
victories obtained without a blow by one faction
over another: And hence it happened, that the seeming
prevalence of a party, was seldom a prognostic of its long
continuance in power and authority.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="221"/>
THE King, so soon as he received the Pope's absolu∣tion
from his oath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1262.</NOTE> which was accompanied with mena∣ces
of excommunication against all opposers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d April.</NOTE> trusting
to the countenance of the church, to the support pro∣mised
him by many considerable barons, and to the re∣turning
favour of the people, immediately took off the
mask, and after justifying his conduct: by a proclamation,
in which he set forth the private ambition, and the breach
of trust, conspicuous in Leicester and his associates, de∣clared
that he had resumed the government, and was de∣termined
thenceforth to exert the royal authority for the
protection of his subjects. He removed Hugh le Des∣penser
and Nicholas de Ely, the high justiciary and
chancellor appointed by the barons; and put Philip Bas∣set
and Walter de Merton in their place. He substituted
new sheriffs in all the counties, men of character and
reputation: He placed new governors in most of the
castles: He changed all the officers of his houshold: He
summoned a parliament, in which the resumption of his
authority was ratified, with only five dissenting voices:
And the barons, after making one fruitless effort, to take
the King by surprize at Winchester, were obliged to ac∣quiesce
in those new regulations<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 668. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 55.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, in order to cut off every objection to his
conduct, offered to refer all the differences between him
and the earl of Leicester, to Margaret queen of France<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 724.</NOTE>.
The celebrated integrity of Lewis gave a mighty influ∣ence
to any decision which issued from his court; and
Henry probably hoped, that the gallantry, on which all
barons, as true knights, valued themselves, would make
them ashamed not to submit to the award of that prin∣cess,
Lewis entirely merited the confidence reposed in
him. By an admirable conduct, probably as political as
<PB N="199" REF="222"/>
just, he continually interposed his good offices to allay
the civil discords of the English: He forwarded all heal∣ing
measures, which might give security to both parties:
And he still endeavoured, tho' in vain, to sooth by per∣suasion
the fierce ambition of the earl of Leicester, and
to convince him how much it was his duty to submit
peaceably to the authority of his sovereign.</P>
<P>THAT bold and artful conspirator was nowise dis∣couraged
with the bad success of his past enterprizes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1263.</NOTE>
The death of Richard earl of Glocester,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil ware of the ba∣rons.</NOTE> who was his
chief rival in power, and who, before his decease, had
joined the royal party, seemed to open a new field to
his violence, and to expose the throne to fresh insults
and injuries. It was in vain, that the King professed
his intentions of observing strictly the great charter,
even of maintaining all the regulations made by the re∣forming
barons at Oxford or afterwards, except those
which entirely annihilated the royal authority: These
powerful chieftains, now obnoxious to the court, could
not peaceably resign the hopes of entire independance
and uncontrouled power with which they had flattered
themselves, and which they had so long enjoyed. Many
of them engaged in Leicester's views, and among the
rest, Gilbert, the young earl of Glocester, who brought
him a mighty accession of power, from the extensive au∣thority
possest by that opulent family. Even Henry, son
of the King of the Romans, commonly called Henry
d' Allmaine, tho' a prince of the blood, joined the party
of the barons against the King, the head of his own
family. Leicester himself, who still resided in France,
formed secretly the links of this great conspiracy, and
planned the whole scheme of operations.</P>
<P>THE princes of Wales, notwithstanding the great
power of the monarchs, both of the Saxon and Nor∣man
<PB N="200" REF="223"/>
line, still preserved authority in their own country
and tho' they had often been constrained to pay tribute
to the crown of England, they were with difficulty retained
in subordination or even in peace; and almost
throughout every reign since the conquest, had infested
the English frontiers with such petty incursions and sud∣den
inroads, as seldom merited to have place in a general
history. The English, still contented with repelling
their invasions, and chacing them back into their barren
mountains, had never pursued the advantages obtained
against them, nor attempted, even under their greatest
and most active princes, a total, or so much as a feudal
subjection of the country. This advantage was reserved
to the present King, the weakest and most indolent. In
the year 1237, Lewellyn, prince of Wales, declining in
years and broke with infirmities, but still more harrassed
with the rebellion and undutiful behaviour of his son,
Griffin, had recourse to the protection of Henry; and
consenting to subject his principality, which had so long
maintained its independance, to vassalage under the
crown of England, purchased security and tranquillity on
these dishonourable terms. His eldest son and heir,
David, renewed the homage to England; and having
taken his brother prisoner, delivered him into Henry's
hands, who committed him to custody in the Tower.
That prince, endeavouring to make his escape from con∣finement,
lost his life in the attempt; and the prince of
Wales, freed from the apprehensions of so dangerous a
rival, paid thenceforth less regard to the English mo∣narch,
and even renewed those incursions, by which the
Welsh, during so many ages, had been accustomed to
infest their borders. Lewellyn, however, the son of
Griffin, who succeeded to his uncle, had been obliged
to renew the homage, which was now claimed by Eng∣land
as an established right; but he was well pleased to
inflame those civil discords, on which he rested his pre∣sent
<PB N="201" REF="224"/>
security, and founded his hopes of future independ∣ance.
He entered into a confederacy with the earl of
Leicester, and collecting all the force of his principality,
invaded England with an army of 30,000 men. He ra∣vaged
the lands of Roger de Mortimer and of all the
barons, who adhered to the crown<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 354.</NOTE>; he marched into
Cheshire, and committed like depredations on prince
Edward's territories; every place, where his disorderly
troops appeared, was laid waste with fire and sword; and
tho' Mortimer, a gallant and expert soldier, made stout
resistance, it was found necessary, that the prince himself
should head the army against this invader. Edward re∣pulsed
prince Lewellyn, and obliged him to take shelter
in the mountains of North Wales: But he was pre∣vented
from making farther progress against the enemy,
by the disorders, which soon after broke out in England.</P>
<P>THE Welsh invasion was the appointed signal for the
malecontent barons to rise in arms; and Leicester coming
over secretly from France, collected all the forces, of his
party, and commenced an open rebellion. He seized the
person of the bishop of Hereford; a prelate very obnoxi∣ous
to all the inferior clergy, on account of his devoted
attachment to the court of Rome<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 211. M. West. p. 382. 392.</NOTE>. Simon, bishop of
Norwich, and John Mansel, because they had published
the Pope's bull, absolving the King and kingdom from
their oaths to observe the provisions of Oxford, were
made prisoners, and exposed to the utmost rage of the
party. The King's demesnes were ravaged with un∣bounded
fury<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 211. M, West. p. 382.</NOTE>; and as it was Leicester's interest to al∣lure
to his side, by the hopes of plunder, all the disor∣derly
ruffians in England, he gave them a general licence
to pillage the barons of the opposite party, and even all
neutral persons. But one of the principal resources of
<PB N="202" REF="225"/>
his faction was the populace of the cities, particularly of
London; and as he had, by his hypocritical pretensions
to sanctity, and his zeal against Rome, engaged all the
monks and lower ecclesiastics in his party, his dominion
over the inferior ranks of men became absolutely uncon∣trolable.
Thomas Fitz-Richard, the mayor of London,
a furious and licentious man, gave the countenance of
authority to these disorders in London; and having de∣clared
war against the substantial citizens, he loosened
all the bands of government, by which that turbulent
city was commonly but ill restrained. On the approach
of Easter, the zeal of superstition, the appetite for
plunder, or what is often as prevalent with the populace
as either of these motives, the pleasure of committing
havock and destruction, prompted them to attack the un∣happy
Jews, who were first pillaged without resistance,
and then massacred, to the number of five hundred per∣sons<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 59.</NOTE>.
The Lombard bankers were next exposed to the
rage of the people; and tho', by taking sanctuary in
the churches, they escaped with their lives, all their
money and goods became a prey to the licentious mul∣titude.
Even the houses of the rich citizens, tho' Eng∣lish,
were attacked by night; and way was made by
sword and by fire to the pillage of their goods, and often
to the destruction of their persons. The queen, who,
tho' she was defended by the Tower, was terrified by
the neighbourhood of such dangerous commotions, re∣solved
to go by water to the castle of Windsor; but as
she approached the bridge, the populace assembled against
her: The cry ran, <HI>drawn the witch;</HI> and besides abusing
her with the most scurrilous language, and pelting her
with rotten eggs and dirt, they had prepared large stones
to sink her barge, when she should attempt to shoot the
<PB N="203" REF="226"/>
bridge; and she was so frightened that she returned to the
Tower<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 57.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE violence and fury of Leicester's faction had risen
to such a height in all parts of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th July.</NOTE> that the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Oct.</NOTE>
unable to resist their power, was obliged to set on foot
a treaty of peace; and to make an accommodation with
the barons on the most disadvahtageous terms<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 358. Trivet, p. 211.</NOTE>. He agreed to confirm anew the provisions of Oxford, even
those which entirely annihilated the royal authority; and
the barons were again re-instated in the sovereignty of
the kingdom. They restored Hugh le Despenser to the
office of high justiciary; they appointed their own crea∣tures
sheriffs in every county of England; they took
possession of all the royal castles and fortresses; they
even named all the officers of the King's houshold; and
they summoned a parliament to meet at Westminster, in
order to settle more fully their, plan of government.
They here produced a new list of twenty four barons, to
whom they proposed, that the administration should be
entirely committed; and they insisted, that the authority
of this junto should continue, not only during the reign
of the King, but also during that of prince Edward.</P>
<P>THIS prince, who was the life and soul of the royal
party, had unhappily, before the King's accommodation
with the barons, been taken prisoner by Leicester in a
parley at Windsor<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 669. Trivet, p. 213.</NOTE>; and this misfortune, more than
any other incident, had determined Henry to submit to
the ignominious conditions imposed upon him. But
having recovered his liberty by the treaty, Edward em∣ployed
his activity in defence of the prerogatives of his
family; and he gained a large party even among those
who had at first adhered with the greatest zeal to the
cause of the barons. His cousin, Henry d'Allmaine,
<PB N="204" REF="227"/>
Roger Bigod earl mareshal, earl Warrenne, Humphrey
Bohun earl of Hereford, John lord Basset, Ralph Basset,
Hamon I' Estrange, Roger Mortimer, Henry de Piercy,
Robert de Brus, Roger de Leyborne, with almost all
the Lords Marchers, as they were called, on the borders
of Wales, and Scotland, the most warlike parts of the
kingdom, declared in favour of the royal cause; and
hostilities, which were scarce well composed, were again
renewed in every part of England. But the near balance
of the parties, joined to the universal clamour of the
people, obliged the King and barons to open anew the
negotiations for peace; and it was agreed by both sides,
to submit the differences entirely to the arbitration of
the King of France<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 668. Chron. T. WyKes, p. 58. W. Heming. p. 580. Chron. Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st. vol. i p. 563.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS virtuous prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reference to the King France.</NOTE> the only man, who, in like
circumstances, could safely have been intrusted with such
an authority by a neighbouring nation, had never ceased
to interpose his good offices between the English factions;
and had even, during the short interval of peace, invited
over to Paris both the King and the earl of Leicester, in
order to accommodate the differences between them;
but found, that the fears and animosities on both sides,
as well as the ambition of Leicester, were so violent, as
to render all his endeavours ineffectual. But when this
solemn appeal, ratified by the oaths and subscriptions of
the leaders in each faction, was made to his judgment,
he was not discouraged from pursuing his honourable pur∣pose:
He summoned the states of France at Amiens;
and there, in the presence of that assembly, as well as in
that of the King of England and Peter de Montfort,
Leicester's son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1264</NOTE> he brought this great cause to a trial and
examination. It appeared to him, that the provisions of
Oxford, even had they not been extorted by force, had
<PB N="205" REF="228"/>
they not been so exorbitant in their nature and subver∣sive
of the antient constitution, were expressly established
as a temporary expedient, and could not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Jan.</NOTE> without breach
of trust, be rendered perpetual by the barons. He there∣fore
annulled these provisions; restored to the King the
possession of his castles, and the power of nomination to
the great offices; allowed him to retain what foreigners
he pleased in his kingdom, and even to confer on them
places of trust and dignity; and in a word, re-esta∣blished
the royal power on the same, footing, on which
it stood before the meeting of the famous parliament at
Oxford. But while he thus suppressed dangerous inno∣vations,
and preserved unimpaired the prerogatives of the
English crown, he was not negligent of the rights of
the people; and besides ordering that a general amnesty
should be granted for all past offences, he declared that
his award was not any wise meant to derogate from the
privileges and liberties, which the nation enjoyed by any
former concessions or charters of the crown<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 776, 777, &amp;c. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 58. Knyghton, p. 2446.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS equitable sentence was no sooner known in Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Renewal of the civil wars.</NOTE>
than Leicester and his confederates determined to
reject it, and to have recourse to arms, in order to pro∣cure
to themselves more safe and, advantageous conditions
from the King<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 363.</NOTE>. Without regard to his oaths and sub∣scriptions,
that enterprizing conspirator ordered his two
sons, Richard and Peter de Montfort, in conjunction
with Robert de Ferrars, earl of Derby, to attack the
city of Worcester; while Henry and Simon de Mont∣fort,
two others of his sons, assisted by the prince of
Wales, were ordered to commit ravages on the estate of
Roger de Mortimer. He himself resided at London;
and employing as his instrument, Fitz-Richard, the se∣ditious
mayor, who had violently and illegally prolonged
<PB N="206" REF="229"/>
his authority, he wrought up that city to the highest fer∣ment
and agitation. The populace formed themselves
into bands and companies; chose leaders; practised all
military exercises; committed violence on all the roya∣lists:
And to give them greater countenance in their dis∣orders,
an association was entered into between the city
and eighteen great barons, never to make peace with
the King but by common consent and approbation.
At the head of those who swore to maintain this asso∣ciation,
were the earls of Leicester, Glocester and Derby,
with le Despenser, the chief justiciary; men who had all
previously sworn to submit to the award of the French
monarch. Their only pretence for this breach of faith,
was, that the latter part of Lewis's sentence was, as they
affirmed, a contradiction to the former: He ratified the
charter of liberties, yet annulled the provisions of Ox∣ford;
which were only calculated, as they maintained,
to preserve that charter; and without which, in their
estimation, they had no security for its observance.</P>
<P>THE King and prince, finding a civil war inevitable,
prepared themselves for defence; and summoning the
military vassals from all quarters, and being re-inforced
by Baliol, lord of Galloway, Brus lord of Annandale,
Henry Piercy, John Comyn<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 771. M. West. p. 385. Ypod. Neust. p. 469.</NOTE>, and other barons of the
north, they composed an army, formidable as well from
its numbers, as its military prowess and experience.
The first enterprize of the royalists was the attack of
Northampton; which was defended by Simon de Mont∣fort,
with many of the principal barons of that party:
AND a breach being rnade in the walls by Philip Basset,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th April.</NOTE>
the place was carried by assault, and both the governor
and the garrison were made prisoners of war<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 60. W. Heming. p. 581. Chron. Dunst. p. 367. M. West. p. 385.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="207" REF="230"/>
royalists marched thence to Leicester and Nottingham,
both which places opened their gates to them<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 60. Knyghton, p. 2447.</NOTE>; and
prince Edward proceeded with a detachment into the
county of Derby, in order to ravage with fire and sword
the lands of the earl of that name, and take revenge on
him for his disloyalty<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 385.</NOTE>. Like maxims of war prevailed
with both parties throughout England; and the kin∣gdom
was thus exposed in a moment to greater devastation,
from the animosities of the rival barons, than it would
have suffered from many years of foreign or even domestic
hostilities, conducted by more humane and more generous
principles.</P>
<P>THE earl of Leicester, matter of London, and of the
counties in the south east of England, formed the siege
of Rochester<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 669. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 61.</NOTE>, which alone held for the king in those
parts, and which, besides earl Warrenne, the governor,
was garrisoned by many noble and powerful barons of
the royal party. The King and prince hastened from
Nottingham, where they were then quartered, to the
relief of the place; and on their approach, Leicester raised
the siege and retreated to London, which, being the
center of his power, he was afraid, might, in his absence,
fall into the King's hands, either by force, or by a cor∣respondence
with the principal inhabitants, who were
all of them secretly inclined to the royal cause<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 582. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 369.</NOTE>. Re-in∣forced
by a body of 15000 citizens, and having summon∣ed
his partizans from all quarters, he thought himself
strong enough to hazard a general battle with the
royalists, and to determine the fate of the nation in one
great engagement; which if it proved successful, must
<PB N="208" REF="231"/>
be decisive against the king, who had no retreat to his
broken troops in those parts; while Leicester himself, in
case of any sinister accident, could easily take shelter in
the city. To give the better colouring to his cause, he
previously sent a message with conditions of peace to
Henry, submissive in the language, but exorbitant in the
demands<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 669. W. Heming. p. 583.</NOTE>; and when the messenger returned with the lye
and defiance from the King, the prince, and the King
of the Romans, he sent a new message, renouncing, in
the name of himself and of the associated barons, all fealty
and allegiance to Henry. He then marched out of the
city with his army, divided into four bodies: The first com∣manded
by his two sons, Henry and Guy de Montfort,
with Humphrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford, who had
deserted to the barons; the second led by the earl of
Glocester, with William de Montchesney and John
Fitz John; the third, composed of Londoners, under
the command of Nicholas de Segrave; the fourth head∣ed
by himself in person. The bishop of Chichester gave
a general absolution to the army, accompanied with assu∣rances,
that, if any of them fell in the action, they would
infallibly be received into heaven, as the reward of their
sufferings in so meritorious a cause!</P>
<P>LEICESTER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Lewes. 14th May.</NOTE> who possessed great talents for war, con∣ducted
his march with such skill and secrecy, that he
had well nigh surprized the royalists in their quarters
at Lewes in Sussex: But the promptitude of prince Ed∣ward
foon repaired this negligence; and he led out the
King's army to the field in three bodies. He himself
conducted the van, attended by earl Warrenne and Wil∣liam
de Valence: The main body was commanded by
the King of the Romans and his son Henry: The King
himself was placed in the rear at the head of his principal
<PB N="209" REF="232"/>
nobility. Prince Edward rushed upon the Londoners,
who had demanded the post of honour in leading the re∣bel
army, but who, from their want of discipline and
experience, were ill qualified to resist the gentry and mi∣litary
men, of whom the prince's body were composed.
They were broke in an instant; were chased off the field
of battle; and Edward, transported by his martial ar∣dour,
and eager to revenge the insolence of the London∣ers
against his mother<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 670. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 62. W. Heming. p. 583. M. West. p. 387. Ypod. Neust. p. 469. H. Knyghton, p. 2450.</NOTE>, put them to the sword for the
length of four miles, without giving them any q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ter,
and without reflecting on the fate, which in the mean
while attended the rest of the army. The earl of Lei∣cester
seeing the royalists thrown into confusion by their
eagerness in pursuit and plunder, led on his remaining
troops against the bodies commanded by the two royal
brothers: He defeat'ed with great slaughter the forces
led by the King of the Romans; and that monarch was
obliged to yield himself prisoner to the earl of Glocester:
He penetrated to the body, where the King himself was
placed, threw it into disorder, pursued his advantage,
chased it into the town of Lewes, and obliged Henry to
Surrender himself prisoner<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 670. M. West. p. 387.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRINCE Edward, returning to the field of battle from
his precipitate pursuit of the Londoners, was astonished
to find it covered with the dead bodies of his friends, and
still more to hear that his father and uncle were defeated
and taken prisoners, and that Arundel, Comyn, Brus,
Hamoh <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'Estrange, Roger Leybourne, and all the con∣siderable
barons of his party, were in the hands of the
victorious enemy. Earl Warrenne, Hugh Bigod, and
William de Valence, struck with despair at this event,
<PB N="210" REF="233"/>
immediately took to flight, hurried to Pevencey, and
made their escape beyond sea<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 63.</NOTE>: But the prince, intrepid
amidst the greatest disasters, exhorted his troops to re∣venge
the death of their friends, to relieve the royal cap∣tives,
and to snatch an easy conquest from an enemy,
disordered by their own victory<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 584.</NOTE>. He found his follow∣ers
intimidated by their situation, while Leicester, afraid
of a sudden and violent blow from the prince, amused
him by a pretence of negotiation, till he was able to re∣call
his troops from the pursuit, and to bring them into
order<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. There now appeared no farther resource to the
royal party; surrounded by the armies and garrisons of
the enemy, destitute of forage and provisions, and depriv∣ed
of their sovereign, as well as of all their principal
leaders, who could alone inspirit them to an obstinate re∣sistance.
The prince, therefore, was obliged to submit
to Leicester's terms, which were short and severe, agree∣able
to the suddenness and necessity of the situation. He
stipulated, that he and Henry d'Allmain should surren∣der
themselves prisoners as pledges in the place of the
two kings; that all other prisoners on both sides should
be released<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 671. Knyghton, p. 2451.</NOTE>; and that in order to settle fully the terms
of agreement, applications should be made to the King
of France, that he should name six Frenchmen, three
prelates and three noblemen: These six to choose two
others of their own country: And these two to choose
one Englishman, who, in conjunction with themselves,
were to be invested by both parties with full powers to
make what regulations they thought proper for the settle∣ment
of the kingdom. The prince and young Henry
accordingly delivered themselves into Leicester's hands,
who sent them under a guard to Dover castle. Such
are the terms of agreement, commonly called the <HI>Mise</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="234"/>
of Lewes, from an obsolete French term of that mean∣ing:
For it appears, that all the gentry and nobility of
England, who disdained the language of their native
country, made familiar use of the French, till this pe∣riod,
and for some time after.</P>
<P>LEICESTER had no sooner obtained this great advan∣tage,
and got the whole royal family in his power, than
he openly violated every article of the treaty, and acted as
sole master, and even tyrant of the kingdom. He still de∣tained
the King in effect a prisoner, and made use of that
prince's authority to purposes the most prejudicial to his
interests, and the most oppressive of his people<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 790, 791, &amp;c.</NOTE>. He
every where disarmed the royalists, and kept all his own
partizans in a military posture<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 795. Brady's appeals, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 211, 212. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 63.</NOTE>: He observed the same
partial conduct in the delivery of the captives, and even
threw many of the royalists into prison beside those who
were taken in the battle of Lewes: He carried the King
from place to place, and obliged all the royal castles,
on pretence of Henry's commands, to receive a governor
and garrison of his own appointment: All the officers of
the crown and of the household were named by him; and
the whole authority, as well as arms of the state, was
lodged in his hands: He instituted in the counties a new
kind of magistracy, endowed with new and arbitrary
powers, that of conservators of the peace<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 792.</NOTE>: His rapa∣cious
avarice appeared barefaced to the whole nation,
and were sufficient to make us question the greatness of
his ambition, at least the largeness of his mind; if we
had not reason to think, that he intended to employ his
unbounded acquisitions as the instruments for acquiring
farther power and grandeur. He seized no less than the
<PB N="212" REF="235"/>
estates of eighteen barons as his share of the spoil gained
in the battle of Lewes: He engrossed to himself the ran∣som
of all the prisoners; and told his barons, with a
wanton insolence, that it was sufficient for them, that
he had saved them by that victory from the forfeitures and
attainders, which hung over them<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2451.</NOTE>: He even treated
the earl of Glocester in the same injurious manner, and
turned to his own profit the ransom of the King of the
Romans, who had in the field of battle yielded himself
prisoner to that nobleman. Henry, his eldest son, made
a monopoly of all the wool of the kingdom, the only va∣luable
commodity for foreign markets which it at that
time produced<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 65.</NOTE>. The inhabitants of the cinque-ports,
during the present dissolution of government, betook
themselves to the most licen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious piracy, made a prey
of the ships of all nations, threw the mariners into the
sea, and by these practices soon banished all merchants
from the English coasts and harbours. Every foreign
commodity rose to an exorbitant price; and woollen
cloaths, which the English had not then the art of dy∣ing,
were worn by them white, and without receiving
the last hand of the manufacturer. In answer to the com∣plaints
which arose on this occasion, Leicester replied,
that the kingdom could well enough subsist within it∣self,
and needed no intercourse with foreigners. And it
was found, that he even combined with the pyrates of
the cinque ports, and received as his share the third of
their prizes<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 65.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No farther mention was made of the reference to the King
of France, so essential an article in the agreement of Lewes;
and Leicester summoned a parliament, composed altogether
of his own partizans, in order to rivet, by their autho∣rity,
<PB N="213" REF="236"/>
that power which he had acquired by so much vio∣lence,
and which he used with so much tyranny and
injustice. An ordinance was there passed, to which the
King's consent had been previously extorted, that every
act of royal power should be exercised by a council of
nine persons, who were to be chosen and removed by
the majority of three, Leicester himself, the earl of Glo∣cester,
and the bishop of Chichester<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 793. Brady's App. N°. 213.</NOTE>. By this intricate
plan of government, the scepter was really put into Lei∣cester's
hands; as he had the entire direction of the bi∣shop
of Chichester, and thereby commanded all the reso∣lutions
of the council of three, who could appoint or dis∣card
at pleasure every member of the supreme council.</P>
<P>BUT it was impossible that things could long remain
in this strange situation. It behoved Leicester either to
descend with some danger into the rank of a subject, or
to mount up with no less into that of a sovereign; and
his exorbitant ambition, unrestrained by any fear or prin∣ciple,
gave too much reason to suspect him of the latter
intention. Mean while, he was exposed to anxiety from
every quarter; and felt that the smallest incident was ca∣pable
of overturning that immense and ill-cemented fabric,
which he had reared. The Queen, whom her husband had
left abroad, had collected in foreign parts an army of des∣perate
adventurers, and had assembled a great number of
ships, with a view of invading the kingdom, and of bringing
relief to her unfortunate family. Lewis, detesting Lei∣cester's
usurpations and perjuries, and disgusted by the
refusal of the English barons, to submit to his award,
favoured all her enterprizes, and was generally believed
to be making preparations for the same purpose. An
English army, by the pretended authority of the captive
King, was assembled on the sea coast to oppose this pro∣jected
<PB N="214" REF="237"/>
invasion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N°. 216, 217 Chron. Dunst. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol. i. p. 373 M. West. p. 385.</NOTE>; but Leicester owed his security more
to cross winds, which long detained and at last dissipated
and broke the Queen's fleet, than to any resistance,
which, in their present situation, could be expected from
the English<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Mailr. p. 226. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEICESTER found himself better able to resist the spi∣ritual
thunders, which were levelled against him. The
Pope, still adhering to the King's cause against the
barons, dispatched cardinal Guido as his legate into Eng∣land,
with orders to excommunicate the three earls, Lei∣cester,
Glocester, and Norfolk, by name, and all others in
general, who concurred in the oppression and captivity of
their sovereign<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 798. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p 373.</NOTE>. Leicester menaced the legate with
death, if he set his foot within the kingdom; but Guido,
meeting in France the bishops of Winchester, London,
and Worcester, who had been sent thither on a negotia∣tion,
commanded them, under the penalty of ecclesias∣tical
censures, to carry his bull into England, and to pub∣lish
it against the barons. When the prelates arrived off
the coast, they were boarded by the pyratical mariners
of the cinque ports, to whom probably they gave a hint
of the cargo, which they brought along with them: The
bull was torn and thrown into the sea; which furnished
the artful prelates with a plausible excuse for not obey∣ing
the orders of the legate<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 671. T. Wykes, p. 65.</NOTE>. Leicester appealed from
Guido to the Pope in person; but before his ambassadors
could reach Rome to defend his cause, the Pope was
dead, and they found the legate himself, from whom
they had appealed, seated on the papal throne, under the
name of Urban IV. That daring leader was no wise
dismayed with this event; and as he found that a great
<PB N="215" REF="238"/>
part of his popularity in England was founded on his
opposition to Rome, which was now become odious, he
persisted with the more obstinacy in the prosecution of
his measures.</P>
<P>THAT he might both encrease,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1265.</NOTE> and turn to advantage
his popularity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Janu∣ary.</NOTE> Leicester summoned a new parliament in
London, where he knew his power was uncontrolable;
and he fixed this assembly on a more democratical basis,
than any which had ever been summoned since the foun∣dation
of the English monarchy. Besides the barons of
his own party, and several ecclesiastics, who were not
immediate tenants of the crown; he ordered returns to
be made of two knights from every shire, and what is
more remarkable, of deputies from the boroughs, which
had always in former ages been esteemed of too mean a
rank to be allowed a place in the national councils<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 802. Fitz-Stephen, Hist, Quadrip. Hoveden, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
This period is commonly esteemed the epoch of the house
of commons of England; and it is certainly the first
time, that mention is made by historians of any represen∣tatives
sent to parliament by the boroughs. In all the
general accounts given in preceding times of parliaments,
the nobility and barons are only spoke of as the con∣stituent
members; and even in the most particular nar∣ratives
delivered of parliamentary transactions, as in the
trial of Thomas a Becket, where the events of each day,
and almost of each hour, are carefully recorded by con∣temporary
authors<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"></NOTE>, there is not, throughout the whole,
the least appearance of a house of commons. But tho'
that house derived its first existence from so precarious
and even so invidious an origin as Leicester's usurpa∣tion,
it proved soon, when summoned by the legal
princes, one of the most useful, and, in process of time,
<PB N="216" REF="239"/>
one of the most powerful members of the national con∣stitution;
and gradually rescued the kingdom from aristo∣cratical
as well as from regal tyranny. But Leicester's
policy, if we must ascribe to him so great a blessing, only
forwarded by some years an institution, for which the
general state of things had already prepared the nation;
and it is otherwise inconceivable, that a plant, set by so
inauspicious a hand, could have attained to so vigorous
a growth, and have flourished in the midst of such tem∣pests
and convulsions. The feudal system, with which
the liberty, much more the power of the commons, was
totally incompatible, began gradually to decline; and
both king and people, who felt its inconveniencies, con∣tributed
to favour this new power, which was more sub∣missive
than the barons to the regular authority of the
crown, and at the same time afforded protection to the
inferior orders of the state.</P>
<P>LEICESTER, having thus assembled a parliament of his
own model, and trusting to the attachment of the po∣pulace
of London, seized the opportunity of crushing his
rivals among the powerful barons. Robert de Ferrars,
earl of Derby, was accused in the King's name, seized,
and committed to custody, without being brought to any
legal trial<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 66. Ann. Waverl. p. 216.</NOTE>. John Gifford, menaced with the same
fate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fled from London, and took shelter in the marches
of Wales. Even the earl of Glocester, whose power
and influence had so much contributed to the success of
the barons, but who was of late extremely disgusted by
Leicester's arbitrary and insolent conduct, who engrossed
the whole power of the party, found himself in danger
from the prevailing authority of his ancient confederate;
and he retired from parliament<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 671. Ann. Waverl. p. 216.</NOTE>. This known division
<PB N="217" REF="240"/>
among the leaders, gave courage to all Leicester's ene∣mies
and to the King's friends; who were now sure of
protection from so potent a leader. Tho' Roger Mor∣timer,
Hamon L'Estrange, and other powerful marchers
of Wales, had been obliged to leave the kingdom, their
authority still remained over the territories subjected to
their jurisdiction; and there were many others who were
disposed to give disturbance to the new government.
The animosities, inseparable from the feudal aristocracy,
broke out with such fresh violence, and threatened the
kingdom with new convulsions and disorders.</P>
<P>THE earl of Leicester, surrounded with these difficul∣ties,
embraced a measure, from which he proposed to
reap some present advantages, but which proved in the
end the source of all his future calamities. The active
and intrepid prince Edward had languished in prison ever
since the fatal battle of Lewes; and being extremely
popular in the kingdom, there arose a general desire of
seeing him again restored to liberty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2451.</NOTE>. As Leicester found,
that he could with difficulty oppose the concurring wishes
of the nation, he stipulated with the prince, that in
return, he should order his adherents to deliver up to the
barons, all their castles, particularly those on the borders
of Wales; and should swear neither to depart the king∣dom
during three years, nor introduce into it any foreign
forces<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 216.</NOTE>. The King took an oath to the same effect,
and he also passed a charter, in which he confirmed the
agreement or <HI>Mise</HI> of Lewes; and even permitted his sub∣jects
to rise in arms against him, if he should ever at∣tempt
to infringe it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Blackiston's Mag. Charts. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 378.</NOTE>. So little care had Leicester taken,
tho' he constantly made use of the authority of this cap∣tive
<PB N="218" REF="241"/>
prince, to preserve to him any appearance of royalty
or kingly prerogatives.<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th March</NOTE></P>
<P>IN consequence of this treaty, prince Edward was
brought into Westminster-hall, and was declared free
by the barons: But instead of really recovering his
liberty, as he had vainly expected, he found, that
the whole transaction was a fraud on the part of
Leicester; that he still continued a prisoner at large,
and was strictly guarded by the emissaries of that
nobleman; and that while the faction reaped all the
benefit from the performance of his part of the
treaty, care was taken that he himself should enjoy no
advantage by it. As Glo∣cester, on his rupture with the
barons, had retired for safety to his estates on the borders
of Wales; Leicester followed him with an army to
Hereford<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 67. Ann. Waverl. p. 218. W. Heming. p. 585. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 383, 384.</NOTE>, continued still to menace and negotiate, and
that he might add authority to his cause, he carried both
the King and prince along with him. The earl of Glo∣cester
here concerted with young Edward the manner of
that prince's escape. He found means to convey to him
a horse of an extraordinary swiftness; and appointed Ro∣ger
Mortimer, who had returned into the kingdom, to be
ready at hand with a small party to receive the prince,
and to guard him to a place of safety.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th May.</NOTE> Edward pretended
to take the air with some of Leicester's retinue, who
were his guards; and making matches between their
horses, after he thought he had tired and blown them suf∣ficiently,
he suddenly mounted Glocester's horse, and
called to his attendants, that he had long enough enjoyed
the pleasure of their company, and now bid them adieu.
They followed him for some space, without being able
<PB N="219" REF="242"/>
to overtake him; and the appearance of Mortimer with
his company put an end to their pursuit<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 672. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 97. Ann. Waverl. p. 218. W. Heming. p. 585. Knyghton, p. 2452.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE royalists,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Evesham, and death of Leicester.</NOTE> secretly prepared for this happy event,
immediately flew to arms; and the joy of this gallant
prince's delivery, the oppressions under which the nation
laboured, the expectation of a new scene of affairs, and
the countenance of the earl of Glocester, procured Edward
an army which Leicester was utterly unable to with∣stand<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 68.</NOTE>.
This nobleman found himself in a remote quar∣ter
of the kingdom, surrounded by his enemies, barred
of all communication with his friends by the Severne,
whose bridges Edward had broke down<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 383.</NOTE>, and obliged to
fight the cause of his party under such multiplied disad∣vantages.
In this extremity he wrote to his son, Simon
de Montfort, to hasten from London with an army for
his relief; and Simon had advanced to Kenilworth,
with that view; where fancying that all Edward's force
and attention were directed against his father, he lay
perfectly secure and unguarded. But the prince, making
a sudden and forced march, surprized him in his camp,
dissipated his army, and took the earl of Oxford, and
many other noblemen prisoners, almost without resist∣ance<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 672. Chron. Mailr. p. 230. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 69. Ann. Waverl. p. 219. W. Heming. p. 586. Knyghton, p. 2452.</NOTE>.
Leicester, ignorant of his son's fate, passed the
Severne in boats during Edward's absence, and lay at
Evesham, in expectation of being every hour joined by
his friends from London: When the prince, who made
profit of every favourable moment, appeared in the field
before him. Edward made a body of his troops advance
<PB N="220" REF="243"/>
from the road which led to Kenilworth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th August.</NOTE> and ordered
them to carry the banners taken from Simon's army;
while he himself, making a circuit with the rest of his
army, proposed to attack the enemy from the other
quarter<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 672. Chron. Mailr. p. 231.</NOTE>. Leicester was long deceived by this stratagem,
and took one division of Edward's army for his friends;
but at last, perceiving his mistake, and observing the
great superiority and excellent disposition of the royalists,
he exclaimed, that they had learned from him their mili∣tary
order; adding, “The Lord have mercy on our
souls: for I see our bodies are the prince's<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 672. W. Heming. p. 586. Knyghton, p. 2453.</NOTE>.” The
battle immediately began, tho' on very unequal terms.
Leicester's army, by living in the mountains of Wales
without bread, which was not then much used among
the inhabitants<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 69.</NOTE>, had been extremely weakened by sick∣ness
and desertion, and was soon broke by the victorious
royalists; while the Welsh allies, accustomed only to a
desultory kind of war, immediately took to flight, and
were pursued with great slaughter<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2453.</NOTE>. Leicester himself,
asking for quarter, was slain i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the heat of the action,
with his eldest son Henry, Hugh le Despenser, and about
one hundred and sixty knights, and many other gentle∣men
of his party. The old King had been purposely
placed by the rebels in the front of the battle; and being
clad in armour, and thereby not known by his friends,
he received a wound, and was in danger of his life: But
crying out, <HI>I am Henry of Winchester, your king,</HI> he was
saved; and put in a place of security by his son, who
flew to his assistance<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 232. W. Heming. p. 587.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE violence, ingratitude, tyranny, rapacity, and
treachery of the earl of Leicester, give a very bad idea
of his moral character, and make us regard his death, as
<PB N="221" REF="244"/>
the most happy event, which, in this conjuncture, could
have happened to the English nation: Yet must we allow
the man to have possessed great abilities, and the appear∣ance
of great virtues, who, tho' a stranger, could, at a
time when strangers were the most odious, and the most
universally decried, have acquired so extensive an interest
in the kingdom, and have so nearly paved his way to the
throne itself. His military capacity, and his political
craft, were equally eminent: He possessed the talents
both of governing men and conducting busness: And
tho' his ambition was boundless, it seems neither to have
exceeded his courage nor his genius; and he had the
happiness of making the low populace, as well as the
haughty barons, co-operate towards the success of his
selfish and dangerous purposes. A prince of greater abi∣lity
and vigour than Henry might have directed the
talents of this nobleman either to the exaltation of his
throne, or to the good of his people: But the advan∣tages
given to Leicester, by the weak and variable admi∣nistration
of the King, brought on the ruin of royal au∣thority,
and produced infinite confusions in the kingdom,
which however in the end preserved and extremely im∣proved
the national liberty and constitution. His popu∣larity,
even after his death, continued so great, that,
tho' excommunicated by Rome, the people believed him
to be a saint; and many miracles were said to be wrought
upon his tomb<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE victory of Evesham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the go∣vernment.</NOTE> with the death of Leicester,
proved decisive in favour of the royalists, and made an
equal, tho' a very opposite impression on friends and
enemies, in every part of England. The King of
the Romans recovered his liberty: The other prisoners of
the royal party were not only freed, but courted, by their
keepers: Fitz-Richard, the seditious mayor of London,
<PB N="222" REF="245"/>
who had marked out forty of the most wealthy citizen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for slaughter immediately stopped his hand on receiving
news of this great event: And almost all the castles gar∣risoned
by the barons, hastened to make their submissions
and to open their gates to the King. The isle of Ax∣holme
alone, and that of Ely, trusting to the strength
of their situation, ventured to make resistance; but were
at last reduced, as well as the castle of Dover, by the
valour and activity of prince Edward<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 676. W. Heming. p. 588.</NOTE>. Adam de Gour∣don,
a courageous baron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1266.</NOTE> maintained himself some time
in the forests of Hampshire, committed depredations in
the neighbourhood, and obliged the prince to lead a body
of troops into that country against him. Edward at∣tacked
the camp of the rebels; and being transported
by the ardour of action, leapt over the trench with a few
followers, and encountered Gourdon himself in single
combat. The victory was long disputed between these
valiant combatants; but ended at last in the prince's
favour, who wounded his antagonist, threw him from
his horse, and took him prisoner. He not only granted
him his life; but introduced him that very night to the
queen at Guilford, procured him his pardon, restored
him to his estate, received him into favour, and was
ever after very faithfully served by him<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, P. 675.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A TOTAL victory of the sovereign over so extensive a
rebellion commonly produces a revolution of govern∣ment,
and strengthens, as well as enlarges, for some
time, the prerogatives of the crown: Yet no sacrifices
of national liberty were made on this occasion; the great
charter remained still inviolate; and the King, sensible
that his own barons, by whose assistance alone he had
prevailed, were no less jealous of their independance
than the other party, seems thenceforth to have more
<PB N="223" REF="246"/>
carefully abstained from all those exertions of arbitrary
power, which had afforded so plausible a pretence to the
rebels. The clemency of this victory is also remark∣able:
No blood was shed on the scaffold: No attainders,
except of the Mountfort family, were executed: And
tho' a parliament, assembled at Winchester, forfeited all
those, who had borne arms against the King, easy com∣positions
were made with them for their lands<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 675.</NOTE>; and
the highest sum, levied on the most notorious offenders,
exceeded not five years rent of their estate. Even the
earl of Derby, who again rebelled, after having been
pardoned and restored to his fortune, was obliged to pay
only seven years rent, and was a second time restored.
The mild disposition of the King, and the prudence of
the prince, tempered the insolence of victory, and gra∣dually
restored order to the several members of the state,
disjointed by so long a continuance of civil wars and
commotions.</P>
<P>THE city of London, which had carried farthest the
rage and animosity against the King, and which seemed
determined to stand upon its defence after almost all the
kingdom had submitted, was, after some interval, re∣stored
to most of its liberties and privileges, and Fitz-Richard,
the mayor, who had been guilty of so much
illegal violence, was only punished by fine and imprison∣ment.
The countess of Leicester, the King's sister,
who had been extremely forward in all attacks on the
royal family, was dismissed the kingdom with her two
sons, Simon and Guy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 72.</NOTE>, who proved very ungrateful for
this lenity. Five years afterwards, they assassinated, at
Viterbo in Italy, their cousin Henry d'Allmaine, who
at that very time was endeavouring to make their peace
with the King; and by taking sanctuary in the church
<PB N="224" REF="247"/>
of the Franciscans, they escaped the punishment due to
so great an enormity<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 870. vol. ii. p. 4, 5. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 94. W. Heming. p. 589. Trivet, p. 240.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE merits of the earl of Glocester,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1267.</NOTE> after he returned
to his allegiance, had been so great, in restoring the
prince to his liberty, and assisting him in his victories
against the rebellious barons, that it was almost impossi∣ble
to content him in his demands; and his youth and
temerity, as well as his great power, tempted him, on
some new disgust, to raise again the flames of rebellion
in the kingdom. The mutinous populace of London, at
his instigation, took to arms; and the prince was obliged
to collect an army of 30,000 men, in order to suppress
them<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 79.</NOTE>. Even this second rebellion did not provoke the
King to any acts of cruelty; and the earl of Glocester
himself escaped with a total impunity. He was only
obliged to enter into a bond of 20,000 marks, that he
never again would be guilty of rebellion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 81.</NOTE>: A strange
method of enforcing the laws, and a proof of the dange∣rous
independance of the barons in those ages! These
potent nobles were, from the danger of the example,
averse to the execution of the laws of forfeiture and fe∣lony
against any of their brethren; tho' they could not
with a good grace refuse to concur in obliging them to
fulfil any voluntary contract and engagement, into which
they had entered.</P>
<P>THE prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1270</NOTE> finding the state of the kingdom tolera∣bly
composed, was seduced, by his avidity for glory,
and by the prejudices of the age, as well as by the ear∣nest
sollicitations of the King of France, to undertake
an expedition against the infidels in the Holy Land<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 677.</NOTE>;
<PB N="225" REF="248"/>
and he endeavoured previously to settle the state in such
a manner, as to dread no bad effects from his absence.
As the dangerous power and turbulent disposition of the
earl of Glocester gave him apprehensions, he insisted on
carrying him along with him, in consequence of a vow,
which that nobleman had made to undertake the same
voyage; and in the mean time, he obliged him to resign
some of his castles, and to enter into a new bond not to
disturb the peace of the kingdom<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. T. Wykes, p. 90.</NOTE>. He failed from Eng∣land
with an army; and arrived in Lewis's camp before
Tunis in Africa, where he found that great monarch al∣ready
dead, from the intemperance of the climate and the
fatigues of his enterprize. The great and only weakness
of this prince in his government was the imprudent zeal
for Crusades; but it was this prepossession chiefly that
procured him from the clergy the title of St. Lewis, by
which he is known in the French history; and if that
appellation had not been so extremely prostituted by the
Romish church, as to become rather a term of reproach,
he seems, by his uniform probity and goodness, as well
as his piety, to have fully merited the title. He was
succeeded by his son, Philip, denominated the Hardy; a
prince of some merit, tho' much inferior to that of his
father.</P>
<P>PRINCE Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1271.</NOTE> not discouraged by this event, conti∣nued
his voyage to the Holy land, where he signalized
himself by acts of valour: Revived the glory of the Eng∣lish
name in those parts: And struck such terror into the
Saracens, that they employed an assassin to murder him,
who wounded him in the arm, but perished in the at∣tempt<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 678, 679. W. Heming. p. 520.</NOTE>.
Mean while, his absence from England was
attended with many of those pernicious consequences,
<PB N="226" REF="249"/>
which had been dreaded from it. The laws were not
executed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1272.</NOTE> The barons oppressed the common people<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Novr. Death</NOTE>
with impunity<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 404.</NOTE>: They gave shelter on their estates to
bands of robbers, whom they employed in committing
ravages on the estates of their enemies: The populace of
London returned to their usual licentiousness: And the
old King, unequal to the burthen of government, called
aloud for his gallant son to return<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 869. M. Paris, p. 678.</NOTE>, and to assist him in
swaying that scepter, which was ready to drop from his
feeble and uncertain hands. At last, overcome by the
cares of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1272.</NOTE> and the infirmities of age, he visi∣bly
declined, and he expired at St. Edmondsbury in the
64th year of his age, and 56th of his reign; the longest
reign which is to be met with in the English annals.
His brother, the King of the Romans (for he never at∣tained
the title of emperor) died about seven months
before him.</P>
<P>THE most obvious circumstance of Henry the third's
character is his incapacity for government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac∣ter of the King.</NOTE> which ren∣dered
him as much a prisoner in the hands of his own
ministers and favourites, and as little at his own disposal, as
when detained a captive in the hands of his enemies.
From this source, rather than from insincerity or trea∣chery,
arose his negligence in observing his promises;
and he was too easily induced, for the sake of present
convenience, to sacrifice the lasting advantages arising
from the trust and confidence of his people. Hence
were derived his profusion to favourites, his attachment
to strangers, the variableness of his conduct, his hasty
resentments, and his sudden forgiveness and return of
affection. Instead of reducing the dangerous power of
his nobles, by obliging them to observe the laws towards
their inferiors, and setting them the salutary example in
<PB N="227" REF="250"/>
his own government; he was seduced to imitate their
conduct, and to make his arbitrary will, or rather that
of his ministers, the rule of his actions. Instead of ac∣commodating
himself, by a strict frugality, to the em∣barrassed
situation in which his revenue had been left, by
the military expeditions of his uncle, the dissipations of
his father, and the usurpations of the barons; he was
tempted to levy money by irregular exactions, which,
without enriching himself, impoverished, at least disgust∣ed
his people. Of all men, nature seemed least to have
fitted him for being a tyrant; yet are there instances
of oppression in his reign, which, tho' derived from the
precedents left him by his predecessors, had been care∣fully
guarded against by the great charter, and are incon∣sistent
with all rules of good government. And on the
whole, we may say, that greater abilities with his good
dispositions, would have prevented him from falling into
his faults; or with worse dispositions, would have en∣abled
him to maintain and defend them.</P>
<P>THIS prince was noted for his piety and devotion, and
his regular attendance on public worship; and a saying of
his on that head is much celebrated by antient writers.
He was engaged in a dispute with Lewis IX. of France,
concerning the preference between sermons and masses:
He maintained the superiority of the latter, and affirmed,
that he would rather have one hour's conversation with a
friend, than hear twenty the most elaborate discourses,
pronounced in praise of him<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Walfing. Edw. I. p. 43.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY left two sons, Edward his successor, and Ed∣mond
earl of Lancaster; and two daughters, Margaret
queen of Scotland, and Beatrix dutchess of Britanny.
He had five other children, who died in their infancy.</P>
<P>THE following are the most remarkable laws enacted
during this reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscellane∣ous transac∣tions of this reign.</NOTE> There had been great disputes be∣tween
<PB N="228" REF="251"/>
the civil and ecclesiastical courts about bastardy.
The common law had deemed all those bastards who
were born before wedlock: By the canon law they were
legitimate: And when any dispute of inheritance arose,
it had been formerly usual for the civil courts to issue
writs to the spiritual, directing them to enquire into the
legitimacy of the person. The bishop always returned
an answer agreeable to the canon law, tho' contrary to
the municipal law of the kingdom. For this reason,
the civil courts had changed the nature of their writ, and
instead of requiring the spiritual courts to enquire con∣cerning
the legitimacy of the person, they only proposed
the simple question of fact, whether he was born before
or after the marriage. The prelates complained of this
practice to the parliament assbled at Merton in the
twentieth of this King, and desired that the civil law
might be rendered conformable to the canon: But re∣ceived
from all the nobility the memorable reply: <HI>Nolu∣mus
leges Angliae mutare:</HI> We will not change the laws
of England<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Statute of Merton, chap. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the civil wars, the parliament, summoned at
Marlebridge, gave their approbation to most of the or∣dinances,
which had been enacted by the reforming
barons, and which, tho' advantageous to the security of
the people, had not received the sanction of a proper au∣thority.
Among other laws, it was there enacted, that
all appeals from the courts of inferior lords should be
carried directly to the King's courts without passing thro'
the courts of the lords immediately superior<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Statute of Marleb, chap. 20.</NOTE>. It was
ordained that money should bear no interest during the
minority of the creditor<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Id. chap. 16.</NOTE>. This law was very reason∣able,
as the estates of minors were always in the hands
of their lords, and the creditors could not pay interest
<PB N="229" REF="252"/>
where they had no revenue. The charter of King John
had granted this indulgence: It was omitted in that of
Henry III. for what reason is unknown; but it was re∣newed
in the statute of Marlebridge. Most of the other
articles of this statute are calculated to restrain the op∣pressions
of sheriffs, and the violences and iniquities
committed in distraining cattle and other goods. Cattle
and the instruments of husbandry composed at that time
the chief riches of the people.</P>
<P>IN the 35th year of this King an assze was fixed of
bread, the price of which was settled, according to the
different prices of corn, from one shilling a quarter to
seven shillings and fix pence<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, p. 6.</NOTE>. These great variations
alone are a proof of bad tillage: Yet did the prices often
rise much higher, than any taken notice of by the laws.
The Chronicle of Dunstable tells us, that in this reign,
wheat was once sold for a mark, nay for a pound a quar∣ter;
that is, three pounds of our present money<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">So als<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Knyghton, p. 2444.</NOTE>. The
same law affords us a proof of the little communication
between the parts of the kingdom, by remarking the very
different prices which the same commodity bore at the
same time. A brewer, says the statute, may sell two
gallons of ale for a penny in cities, and three or four
gallons for the same price in the country. At present,
such commodities, by che great consumption of the people,
and the great stocks of the brewers, are rather cheapest
in cities. The Chronicle of Dunstable observes, that
wheat one year was sold in many places for eight shillings
a quarter, but never rose in Dunstable above a crown.</P>
<P>THO' commerce was still very low, it seems rather to
have encreased since the Conquest; at least, if we may
judge of the encrease of money by the price of bread.
The medium between the highest and lowest prices
<PB N="230" REF="253"/>
of wheat, assigned by the statute, is four shillings and
three pence a quarter, that is, twelve shillings and nine
pence of our present money. This is near the half of
the middling price in our time. Yet the middling price
of cattle, so late as the reign of King Richard, we found
to be above eight times lower than the present. Is not
the true inference, from comparing these facts, that in
all uncivilized nations, cattle, which propagate of them∣selves,
bear always a lower price than corn, which re∣quires
more art and stock to raise it, than these nations
are possessed of? It is to be remarked, that Henry's
assize of corn was copied from a preceding assize esta∣blished
by King John; and consequently, the prices
which we have here compared of corn and cattle may be
looked on as contemporary; and they were drawn, not
from one particular year, but from an estimation of the
middling prices. It is true, the prices, assigned by the
assize of Richard, were meant as a standard for the ac∣compts
of sheriffs and escheators; and as considerable
profits were allowed to them, we may naturally suppose,
that the common value of cattle was somewhat higher:
Yet still, so great a difference between the prices of
corn and cattle as that of four to one, compared to the
present rates, affords important reflections concerning the
very different state of industry and tillage in the two
periods.</P>
<P>INTEREST had in that age mounted to an enormous
height, as might be expected from the barbarism of the
times and mens ignorance of commerce. There are in∣stances
of fifty per cent payed for money<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p 586.</NOTE>. Such pro∣fits
tempted the Jews to remain in England, notwith∣standing
the grievous oppressons to which they were
continually exposed from the prevalent bigotry and rapine
of the age. It is easy to imagine how precarious their
<PB N="231" REF="254"/>
state must be under an indigent prince, somewhat re∣strained
in his tyranny over his native subjects, but who
possessed an unlimited authority over them, the sole pro∣prietors
of money in the kingdom, and hated on account
of their riches, their religion, and their usury: Yet will
our ideas scarce come up to the extortions which in fact
we shall find to have been practised upon them. In the
year 1241, 20,000 marks were ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted from them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 372.</NOTE>:
Two years after, money was again extorted; and one
Jew alone, Aaron of York, was obliged to pay above
4000 marks<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 410.</NOTE>: In 1250, Henry renewed his oppressions;
and the same Aaron was condemned to pay him 30,000
marks upon an accusation of forgery<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 525.</NOTE>: The high pe∣nalty
imposed upon him, and which, it seems, he was
thought able to pay, is rather a presumption of his in∣nocence
than of his guilt. In 1255, the King demanded
8000 marks from the Jews, and threatened to hang
them, if they refused compliance. They now lost all
patience, and desired leave to retire with their effects out
of the kingdom. But the King replied:
“How can I
remedy the oppressions you complain of? I am myself
a beggar. I am despoiled, I am stripped, of all my
revenues: I owe above 200,000 marks; and if I had
said 300,000, I should not exceed the truth: I am
obliged to pay my son, prince Edward, 15,000 marks
a year: I have not a farthing; and I must have money,
from any hand, from any quarter, or by any means.”
He then delivered over the Jews to the earl of Cornwal,
that those whom the one brother had flead, the other
might embowel, to make use of the words of the histo∣rian<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 606.</NOTE>.
King John, his father, once demanded 10,000 marks from a Jew of Bristol; and on his refusal, or∣dered
one of his teeth to be drawn every day till he should

<PB N="232" REF="257"/>
consent. The Jew lost seven teeth; and then paid the
sum required of him<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To give a better pretence to extortions, the impro∣bable
and absurd accusation, which has been at different
times advanced against that nation, was revived in Eng∣land,
that they had crucified a child in derision of our
Saviour's sufferings. Eighteen of them were hanged at
once for this crime<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 613.</NOTE>: Tho' it is no wife credible, that
even the antipathy born them by the Christians, and the
oppressions under which they laboured, would ever have
pushed them to be guilty of that dangerous enormity. But
it is natural to imagine, that a race, exposed to such in∣sults
and indignities both from king and people, and who
had so uncertain an enjoyment of their riches, would
carry usury to the greatest extremities, and by their
great profits make themselves some compensation for their
continued perils.</P>
<P>COMMERCE must be in a wretched condition where
interest was so high, and where the sole proprietors of
money were exposed to such rapine and injustice. But
the bad police of the country was another obstacle to all
improvements; and rendered all communication dan∣gerous,
and all property precarious. The Chronicle of
Dunstable says<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 155.</NOTE>, that men during this reign were never
secure in their houses, and that whole villages were often
plundered by bands of robbers, tho' no civil wars pre∣vailed
in the kingdom. In 1249, some years before the
insurrection of the baron<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, two merchants of Brabant
came to the King at Winchester, and told him, that
they had been despoiled of all their goods by certain
robbers, whom they knew, because they saw their faces
every day in his court; that like practices prevailed all
<PB N="233" REF="258"/>
over England, and travellers were every day robbed,
bound, wounded, and murdered; that these crimes esca∣ped
with impunity, because the ministers of justice them∣selves
were in a consederacy with the robbers; and that
they for their part, instead of bringing matters to a fruit∣less
trial by law, were willing, tho' merchants, to try
their cause with the robbers by arms and a duel. The
King, provoked at these abuses, ordered a jury to be in∣closed,
and to try the robbers: The jury, tho' consisting
of twelve men of property in Hampshire, were found
to be also in a consederacy with the robbers, and acquit∣ted
them. Henry in a rage committed the jury to prison,
threatened them with severe punishment, and ordered a
new jury to be enclosed, who, dreading the fate of their
fellows, at last found a verdict against the criminals.
Many of the King's own household were discovered to
have participated in the guilt; and said for their excuse,
that they received no wages from him, and were obliged
to rob for a maintenance<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 509.</NOTE>. <HI>Knights and esquires,</HI> says
the Dictum of Kenelworth, <HI>who were robber, if they have
no land, shall pay the half of their goods, and find sussicient se∣curity
to keep henceforth the peace of the kingdom.</HI> Such were
the manners of the times!</P>
<P>ONE can the less repine, during the prevalence of such
manners, at the frauds and forgeries of the clergy; as it
gives much less disturbance to society, to take men's money
from them with their own consent, tho' by deceits and
lies, than to ravish it by open force and violence. During
this reign, the papal power was at its summit, and was
even beginning insensibly to decline, by reason of the im∣measurable
avarice and extortions of the court of Rome,
which disgusted the clergy as well as laity in every king∣dom
of Europe. England itself, tho' sunk in the deep∣est
abyss of ignorance and superstition, had seriously en∣tertined
<PB N="234" REF="259"/>
thoughts of shaking off the papal yoke<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 421.</NOTE>; and
the Roman pontiff was obliged to think of new expedients
for rivetting it faster upon them. For this purpose,
Gregory IX. published his decretals<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 191.</NOTE>, which are a col∣lection
of forgeries, favourable to the court of Rome,
and consist of the supposed decrees of Popes in the first
centuries. But these forgeries are so gross, and confound
so palpably all language, history, chronology, and anti∣quities;
matters more stubborn than any speculative
truths whatever; that even that church, which is not
startled at the most monstrous contradictions and absur∣dities,
has been obliged to abandon them to the critics.
But in the dark age of the thirteenth century, they pass∣ed
for undisputed and authentic; and men, entangled in
the mazes of this false literature, joined to the philosophy,
equally false, of the times, had nothing wherewithal to
defend themselves, but some small remains of common
sense, which passed for prosaneness and impiety, and the
indelible regard to self-interest, which, as it was the sole
motive in the priests for framing these impostures, ser∣ved
also, in some degree, to protect the laity against
them.</P>
<P>ANOTHER expedient, devised by the church of Rome
in this period for securing its power, was the institution
of new religious orders, and chiefly the Dominicans and
Franciscans, who proceeded with all the zeal and success
that attend novelties; were better qualified to gain the
populace than the old orders, now become rich and indo∣lent;
maintained a perpetual navalship with each other in
promoting their gainful superstitions; and acquired a great
dominion over the minds, and consequently over the purses
of men, by counterseiting a desire of poverty and a contempt
for riches. The quarrels, which arose between these orders,
<PB N="235" REF="260"/>
lying still under the controul of the sovereign pontiff, never
disturbed the peace of the church, and served only as a
spur to their industry in promoting the common cause;
and tho' the Dominicans lost some popularity by their de∣nial
of the immaculate conception, a point in which they
unwarily engaged too far to be able to recede with ho∣nour,
they counterbalanced this disadvantage by acqui∣ring
more solid establishments, by gaining the confidence
of kings and princes, and by exercising the jurisdiction
assigned them, of ultimate judges and punishers of heresy.
Thus, the several orders of monks became a kind of re∣gular
troops or garrisons of the Romish church; and
tho' the temporal interests of society, slill more those of
true piety, were hurt by their various devices to catch
the populace, they proved the chief supports of that
mighty fabric of superstition, and, till the revival of true
learning, secured it from any dangerous invasion.</P>

<P>THE English were as yet so little trained to obe∣dience

of almost every King, since the conquest, had been at∣tended
with disorders; and the council, reflecting on the

remain after these great convulsions, had reason to appre∣hend
very dangerous consequences from the absence of
the son and successor of Henry. They therefore hastened
to proclaim prince Edward, to swear allegiance to him,
and to summon the sates of the kingdom, in order to
provide for the public peace in this important conjunc∣ture<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. I. Walfing. p. 43. Trivet, p. 239.</NOTE>.
Walter Giffard, archbishop of York, the earl
<PB N="237" REF="262"/>
of Cornwal, son of Richard, King of the Romans, and
the earl of Glocester, were appointed guardians of the
kingdom, and proceeded peaceably to the exercise of their
authority, without either meeting with opposition from
any of the people, or being disturbed with emulation and
faction among themselves. The high character acq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired
by Edward during the late commotions, his military ge∣nius,
his success in subduing the rebels, his moderation
in settling the kingdom, had procured him great esteem,
mixt with affection, among all orders of men; and no
one could reasonably entertain hopes of making any ad∣vantage
of his absence, or of railing disturbance in the na∣tion.
The earl of Glocester himself, whose great power,
and turbulent spirit, had excited most jealousy, was for∣ward
to give proofs of his allegiance; and any malecon∣tents,
who remained, being destitute of a leader, were
obliged to remain in submission to the government.</P>
<P>PRINCE Edward had reached Sicily in his return from
the Holy Land, when he received information of the
death of his father; and he discovered a deep concern on
this occasion. At the same time he learned the death of
an infant son, John, whom his princess, Eleanor of
Castile, had born him at Acre in Palestine; and as he ap∣peared
much less affected with that misfortune, the king
of Sicily expressed a surprize at this difference of senti∣ment:
But was told by Edward, that the death of a son
was a loss which he might hope to repair; the death of
a father was a loss irreparable<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Walsingh. p. 44. Trivet, p. 240.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD proceeded homewards;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1273</NOTE> but as he soon learn∣ed
the quiet settlement of the kingdom, he was in no
hurry to take possession of the throne, but spent near a
year in France, before he made his appearance in Eng∣land.
In his passage by Chalons in Burgundy, he was
<PB N="238" REF="263"/>
challenged by the prince of that country to a tournament
which he was preparing; and as Edward excelled in these
martial and dangerous exercises, the true image of war,
he declined not the opportunity of acquiring honour and
renown, in that great assembly of the neighbouring
nobles. But the image of war was here unfortunately
turned into the thing itself. Edward and his retinue were
so successful in the jousts, that the French knights, pro∣voked
at their superiority, made a serious attack upon
them, which was repulsed, and a good deal of blood was
idly shed in the quarrel<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Walsingh. p. 44. Trivet, p. 241. M. West. p. 402.</NOTE>. This rencounter received the
name of the petty battle of Chalons.</P>
<P>EDWARD went from Chalons to Paris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1274</NOTE> and did ho∣mage
to Philip for the dominions which he held in<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th AUG.</NOTE>
France<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 45.</NOTE>. He thence returned to Guienne, and gave a
settlement to that province, which was in some confusion.
He made his journey to London thro' France; in his
passage he accommodated at Montreuil a difference with
Margaret, countess of Flanders, heiress of that territory<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 32, 33.</NOTE>;
he was received with joyful acclamations by his people,
and was solemnly crowned at Westminster by Robert,
archbishop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>THE King immediately applied himself to the re-esta∣blishment
of his kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil admi∣nistration of the king.</NOTE> and to the correcting of those
disorders, which the civil commotions and the loose ad∣ministration
of his father had introduced into every part
of government. The plan of his policy was equally ge∣nerous
and prudent. He considered the great barons
both as the immediate rivals of the crown, and the op∣pressors
of the people; and he proposed, by an exact dis∣tribution
of justice, and a rigid execution of the laws, to
give at once protection to the inferior orders of the state,
<PB N="239" REF="264"/>
and to diminish the arbitrary power of the great, on
which their dangerous authority was chiefly founded.
Making it a rule of his own conduct to observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1275</NOTE> except
on extraordinary occasions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Feb.</NOTE> the privileges secured to them
by the great charter, he acquired a right to insist upon
their observance of the same charter towards their vassals
and inferiors; and he made the crown be regarded by all
the gentry and commonalty of the kingdom, as the great
fountain of justice, and the general asylum against op∣pression:
Besides enacting several excellent statutes, in a
parliament which he summoned at Westminster, he took
care to inspect the conduct of all his magistrates and
judges, to displace such as were either negligent or cor∣rupt,
to provide them with sufficient force for the exe∣cution
of justice, to root out all bands and confederacies
of robbers, and to repress those more silent robberies,
which were committed either by the power of the nobles,
or under the countenance of public authority. By this
rigid administration, the face of the kingdom was soon
changed; and order and justice took place of violence
and oppression: But amidst the excellent institutions and
public-spirited plans of Edward, there still appears some∣what
both of the severity of his personal character and of
the prejudices of the times.</P>
<P>As the various kinds of malefactors, the murderers,
robbers, incendiaries, ravishers, and plunderers, had be∣come
so numerous and powerful, that the ordinary mi∣nisters
of justice, especially in the western counties, were
afraid to execute the laws against them, the King found
it necessary to provide an extraordinary remedy for the
evil; and he crected for the punishment of crimes a new
tribunal, which, however useful, would have been deem∣ed,
in times of more regular liberty, a very great stretch
of illegal and arbitrary power. It consisted of commis∣sioners,
who were empowered to enquire into disorders
<PB N="240" REF="265"/>
and crimes of all kinds, and to inflict the proper punish∣ments
upon them. The officers, charged with this unusual
commission,. made their circuits throughout the coun∣ties
of England most infected with this evil, and carried
terror into all those parts of the kingdom. In their zeal
to punish crimes, they did not sufficiently distinguish be∣tween
the innocent and guilty; the smallest suspicion be∣came
the ground of accusation and trial; the slightest
evidence was received againist criminals; the prisons were
crowded with malefactors, real or pretended; severe fines
were levied for small offences; and the King, tho' his
exhausted revenue was supplied by this expedient, found
it necessary to stop the course of so great rigour, and af∣ter
terrisying and dissipating by this tribunal. the gangs of
disorderly people in England, he very prudently annulled
the commission<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Spellman's Gloss in verbo T railbastan. But Spellman was either mistaken in placing this commission in the fifth year of the King, or it was renewed in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>305. See Rymer, vol. ii. p. 960. Trivet, p. 338. M. West. p. 450.</NOTE>; and never afterwards renewed it.</P>
<P>AMONG the various disorders, to which the kingdom
was subjet, no one was more universally complained of
than the adulteration of the coin; and as this crime re∣quired
more art than the English of that age, who
chiefly employed force and violence in their iniquities,
were possessed of, the imputation fell chiefly upon the
Jews<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wolfing. p. 48. Heming. vol. i. p. 6.</NOTE>. Edward also seems to have indulged a strong
prepossession against that nation; and. this ill-judged zeal
for Christianity being naturally augmented by an expeci∣tion
to the Holy Land, he let loose the whole rigour of
his justice against this unhappy people. Two hundred
and eighty of them were hanged at once for this crime
in London alone, besides those who suffered in other
parts of the kingdom.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">T. Wykes, p. 107.</NOTE>. The houses and lands, (for the
<PB N="241" REF="266"/>
Jews had of late ventured to make purchases of that
kind) as well as the goods of great multitudes, were sold
and consiscated: And the King, left it should be sus∣pected,
that the riches of the sufferers were the chief
part of their guilt, ordered one half of the money, raised
by these consiscations, to be set apart, and bestowed upon
such as were willing to be converted to Christianity. But
the resentment of their injuries was more prevalent over
them, than the temptation from their poverty; and very
few of them could be induced by interest to embrace the
religion of their persecutors. The miseries of this people
were not here terminated. Tho' the arbitrary talliages
and exactions levied upon them, had yielded a constant
and a considerable revenue to the crown; Edward,
prompted by his zeal and capacity, resolved some time
after<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In the year 1290.</NOTE> to purge the kingdom entirely of that hated race,
and to seize to himself at once their whole property as
the reward of his labour<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 54. Heing. vol. 1. p. 20. Trivet, p. 266.</NOTE>. He left them only money
sufficient to bear their charges into foreign countries,
where new persecutions and extortions awaited them:
But the inhabitants of the cinque ports, imitating the
bigotry and avidity of their sovereign, despoiled most of
them of this small pittance, and even threw many of the
Jews into the sea: A crime, for which the King, who
was determined to be the sole plunderer in his dominions,
inflicted a capital punishment upon them. No lets than
fifteen thousand Jews were at this time robbed of their
effects and banished the kingdom: Very few of that na∣tion
have since lived in England: And as it is impossible
for a kingdom to subsist without lenders of money, and
none will lend without a compensation, the practice of
usury, as it was then called, was thenceforth exercised by
the English themselves upon their fellow-citizens, or by
<PB N="242" REF="267"/>
Lombards and other foreigners. It is very much to be
questioned whether the dealings of these new usurers
were equally open and unexceptionable with those of
the old. By a law of Richard, it was enacted, that
three copies should be made of every bond given to a
Jew; one to be put into the hands of a public magistrate,
another into those of a man of credit, and a third to re∣main
with the Jew himself<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. I 28.</NOTE>. But as the canon law,
seconded by the municipal, permitted no Christian to re∣ceive
interest, all transactions of this kind must, after
the banishment of the Jews, have become more secret
and clandestine, and the lender, of consequence, be paid
both for the use of his money, and for the infamy and
danger which he incurred by lending it.</P>
<P>THE great poverty of the crown, tho' no excuse, was
probably the cause of this egregious tyranny exercised
against the Jews; but Edward practised also other more
honourable means of remedying that evil. He employed
a strict srugality in the management and distribution of
his revenue: He engaged the parliament to vote him a
fifteenth of all moveables; the Pope to grant him the
tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues for three years; and
the merchants to consent to a perpetual imposition of
half a mark on every sack of wool exported, and a mark
on three hundred skins. He also issued commissions to
enquire into all encroachments on the royal demesne;
into the value of escheats, forfeitures, and wardships;
and in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the means of repairing or improving every
branch of the revenue<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 235.</NOTE>. The commissioners, in the exe∣cution
of their office, began to carry matters too far
against the nobility, and to question the titles to estates
which had been transmitted from father to son for several
generations. Earl Warrenne, who had done such emi∣ment
service in the late reign, being required to show
<PB N="243" REF="268"/>
his titles, drew his sword; and subjoined, that William,
the Bastard, had not conquered the kingdom for himself
alone; his ancestor was a joint adventurer in the cause;
and he himself was determined to maintain what had
from that period remained unquestioned in his family.
The King, sensible of the danger, very prudently de∣sisted
from making farther enquiries of this nature.</P>
<P>BUT the active spirit of Edward could not long remain
without employment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1276.</NOTE> He soon after undertook an en∣terprize
more safe for himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conquest of Wales.</NOTE> and more advantageous to
his people. Lewellyn, prince of Wales, had been deeply
engaged with the Mountsort saction; had entered into
all their conspiracies against the crown; had frequently
fought on their side; and till the battle of Evesham, so
fatal to that party, had employed every expedient to de∣press
the royal cause, and to promote the success of the
barons. In the general accommodation, made with the
vanquished, Lewellyn had also obtained his pardon; but
as he was the most powerful, and therefore the most ob∣noxious
vassal of the crown, he had reason to entertain
anxiety about his situation, and to dread the future ef∣fects
of resentment and jealousy in the English monarch.
For this reason, he had determined to provide for his se∣curity
by maintaining a secret correspondence with his
former associates; and he even made his addresses to a
daughter of the earl of Leicester, who was sent to him
from beyond sea, but being intercepted in her passage
near the isles of Scilly, was detainied in the court of Eng∣land
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 46, 47. Heming. vol. i. p. 5. Trivet, p. 248.</NOTE>. This incident encreasing the mutual jealousy be∣tween
Edward and Lewellyn, the latter, when required
to come to England, and do homage to the new Kings
scrupled to put himself into the hands of an enemy, de∣sired
a safe conduct from Edward, insisted upon having
<PB N="244" REF="269"/>
the King's son and other noblemen delivered to him
hostages, and demanded, that his spouse should be pre∣viously
set at liberty<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii, p. 68. Walsing. p. 46. Trivet, p. 247</NOTE>. The King, having now brought
the state to a full settlement, was not displeased with this
occasion of exercising his authority, and subduing en∣tirely
the principality of Wales. He refused all Lew∣ellyn's
demands, except that of a safe conduct; sent him
repeated summons to perform the duty of a vassal; levied
an army to reduce him to obedience; obtained a new
aid of a fifteenth from parliament; and marched out
with certain assurance of success against the enemy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1277.</NOTE> Be∣sides
the great disproportion of force between the king∣dom
and principality, the circumstances of the two states
were now entirely reversed; and the same intestine dis∣sentions
which had formerly weakened England, now
prevailed in Wales, and had even taken place in the
reigning family. David and Roderic, brothers to Lew∣ellyn,
had been dispossessed of their inheritance by that
prince, had been obliged to have recourse to the protec∣tion
of Edward, and seconded with all their interest,
which was extensive, his attempts to enslave their native
country. The welsh prince had no other resource but
in the inaccessible situation of his mountains, which had
hitherto, thro' many ages, defended his forefathers againist
all the attempts of the Saxon and Norman conquerors;
and he retired among the hills of Snowdun, resolute to
defend himself to the last extremity. But Edward equally
vigorous and cautious, entering by the north with a for∣midable
army, pierced into the heart of the country; and
having carefully explored every road before him, and se∣cured
every pass behind him, approached the Welsh ar∣my
in its last retreat. He here avoided the putting to
trial the valour of a nation, proud of its antient inde∣pendance,
and enflamed with animosity against its here∣ditary
<PB N="245" REF="270"/>
ditary enemies; and he trusted to the slow, but sure ef∣fects
of famine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th Nov.</NOTE> for reducing that people to subjection.
The rude and simple manners of the natives, as well as
the mountainous situation of their country, had made
them entirely neglect tillage, and trust to pasturage a∣lone
for their subsistance: A method of life which had
hitherto secured them against the irregular attempts of
the English, but exposed them to certain ruin, when the
conquest of the country was steddily pursued, and pru∣dently
planned by Edward. Destitute of magazines,
cooped up in a narrow corner, they and their cattle suf∣fered
equally from famine; and Lewellyn, without be∣ing
able to strike a stroke for his independance, was at
last obliged to submit at discretion, and receive the terms
imposed upon him by the victor<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">T. Wykes, p. 105.</NOTE>. He bound himself to
pay to Edward 50,000 l. as reparation of damages; to do
homage to the crown of England; to permit all the other
barons of Wales, except, four near Snowdun, to swear
fealty to the same crown; to relinquish the country be∣tween
Cheshire and the river Conway; to settle on his
brother Roderic a thousand marks a year, and on David
five hundred; and to deliver ten hostages for security of
his future submission<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 88. Walfin. p. 47. Trivet, p. 251. T. Wykes, p. 106.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD, on the performance of the other articles,
remitted to the prince of Wales the payment of the
50,000 1.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, p. 92.</NOTE>, which were stipulated by treaty, and which,
it is probable, the poverty of the country made it abso∣lutely
impossible for him to levy. But complaints
of other hardships soon arose on the side of the van∣quished:
The English, insolent on their easy and blood∣less
victory, oppressed the inhabitants of the districts
which were yielded to them: The lords marchers com∣mitted
with impunity all kinds of violence on their
<PB N="246" REF="271"/>
Welsh neighbours: New and more severe terms were
imposed on Lewellyn himself; and Edward, when the
prince attended him at Worcester, exacted a promise
that he would retain no person in his principality who
should be disagreeable to the English monarch<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Dr. Powell's Hist. of Wales, p. 344, 345.</NOTE>. There
were other personal insults, which raised the indignation
of the Welsh, and made them determine rather to en∣counter
a force, which they had already experienced to
be so much superior, than to bear any longer the oppres∣sion
of the haughty victors. Prince David, seized with
the national spirit, made peace with his brother, and pro∣mised
to concur in the defence of public liberty. The Welsh
flew to arms; and Edward, not displeased with
the occasion of making his conquest final and absolute,
summoned together all his military tenants, and advanced
into Wales with an army, which the inhabitants could
not reasonably hope to resist. The situation of the coun∣try
gave the Welsh at first some advantage over Luke
de Tany, one of Edward's captains, who had passed the
Menau with a detachment<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 50. Heming. vol. i. p 9. Trivet, p. 258. T. Wykes, p. 110.</NOTE>: But Lewellyn, being sur∣prized
by Mortimer, was defeated, and slain in the action,
and 2000 of his followers were put to the sword<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 11, Trivet, p. 257. Ann. Waverl. p. 235.</NOTE>. Da∣vid,
who succeeded him in the principality, could never
collect an army sufficient to face the English; and being
chaced from hill to hill, and hunted from one retreat to
another, was obliged to conceal himself under various
disguises, and was at last betrayed in his lurking-place to
the enemy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1285.</NOTE> Edward sent him in chains to Shrews∣bury;
and bringing him to a formal trial before all the
peers of England, ordered this sovereign prince to be
hanged, drawn, and quartered, as a traitor, for defending
by arms the liberties of his native country, together with
<PB N="247" REF="272"/>
his own hereditary authority<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 12. Trivet, p. 259. Ann. Waverl. p. 238. T. Wykes, p. 111. M. West. p. 411.</NOTE>. All the Welsh
nobility submitted to the conqueror; the laws of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1283.</NOTE> with
the sheriffs and other ministers of justice, were established
in that principality; and tho' it was long before nationa
antipathies were extinguished, and a thorough union ac∣complished
between the people, yet this important con∣quest,
which it had required eight hundred years fully to
effectuate, was at last, thro' the abilities of Edward,
compleated by the English.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1284.</NOTE> sensible that nothing kept alive the ideas
of military valour and of ancient glory, so much as the
traditional poetry of the people, which, assisted by the
power of music, and the jollity of festivals, made deep
impression on the minds of the youth, gathered together
all the Welsh bards, and from a barbarous, tho' not ab∣surd
policy, ordered them to be put to death<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sir J. Wynne, p. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE prevails a vulgar story, which, as it suits ex∣actly
the capacity of the monkish writers, is carefully re∣corded
by them: That Edward assembling the Welsh,
promised to give them a prince of unexceptionable man∣ners,
a Welshman by birth, and one who could speak
no other language. On their acclamations of joy, and
promise of obedience, he invested in the principality his
second son Edward, then an infant, who had been born
at Carnarvon. The death of his eldest son Alfonso, soon
after, made young Edward heir of the monarchy: The
principality of Wales was fully annexed to the crown;
and henceforth gives a title to the eldest son of the kings
of England.</P>
<P>THE settlement of Wales appeared so complete to
Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1286.</NOTE> that in less than two years after, he went a∣broad
<PB N="248" REF="273"/>
in order to make peace between Alphonso, King
of Arragon, and Philip le Bel, who had newly succeeded
his father Philip le Hardy in the throne of France<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 149, 150, 174.</NOTE>.
The difference between these two princes had arisen about
the kingdom of Sicily, which the Pope, after his hopes
from England failed him, had bestowed on Charles,
brother to St. Lewis, and which was claimed upon other
titles, by Peter King of Arragon, father to Alphonso.
Edward had powers from both princes to settle the peace,
and he succeeded in his endeavours; but as the contro∣versy
no wife regards England, we shall not enter into
a detail of it. He stayed abroad above three years;
and on his return, found many disorders to have prevailed,
both from open violence, and from the corruption of justice.</P>
<P>THOMAS CHAMBERLAIN, a gentleman of some note,
had assembled several of his associates at Boston, in Lin∣colnshire,
under pretence of holding a tournament, an
exercise practised by the gentry only; but in reality with
a view of plundering the rich fair of Boston, and rob∣bing
the merchants. To facilitate his purpose, he pri∣vately
set fire to the town; and while the inhabitants
were employed in quenching the flames, the conspirators
broke into the booths, and carried off the goods. Cham∣berlain
himself was detected and hanged; but main∣tained
so steddily the point of honour to his accomplices,
that he could not be prevailed with, by any offers of
promises, to discover any of them. Many other instan∣ces
of robbery and violence broke out, in all parts of
England; tho' the fingular circumstances, attending this
conspiracy, have made it alone be particularly recorded
historians<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 16, 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the corruption of the judges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1289.</NOTE> by which the foun∣tains
of justice, were poisoned, seemed still of more dan∣gerous
<PB N="249" REF="274"/>
consequence. Edward, in order to remedy this
prevailing abuse, summoned a parliament, and brought
the judges to a trial, where all of them, except two, who
were clergymen, were convicted of this flagrant iniquity,
were fined, and deposed from their office. The amount
of the fines levied upon them, is alone a sufficient proof
of their guilt; being above one hundred thousand marks,
an immense sum in those days, and sufficient to defray
the charges of an expensive war between two great king∣doms.
The King afterwards made all the new judges
swear, that they would take no bribes; but his expe∣dient,
of deposing and fining the old ones, was the more
effectual remedy.</P>
<P>WE come now to give an account of the affairs of
Scotland, which form the most interesting transaction of
this reign, and of some of the subsequent; tho' the in∣tercourse
of that kingdom with England, either in peace
or war, had hitherto produced so few events of moment,
that to avoid tediousness, we have omitted many of them,
and have been very concise in relating the rest. If the
Scots had, before this period, any real history, worthy
of the name, except what they pick up from scattered
passages of the English historians, these events, how∣ever
minute, yet being the only foreign transactions of
the nation, might deserve a place in it.</P>
<P>THO' the government of Scotland had been continu∣ally
exposed to those factions and convulsions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> which are
incident to all barbarous, and to many civilized nations;
and tho' the successions of their Kings, the only part of
their history which deserves any credit, had been often
disordered by irregularities and usurpations; the true
heir of the royal family had still in the end prevailed,
and Alexander III. who had espoused Edward's sister,
probably inherited, after a period of above eight hundred
years, and thro' a succession of males, the scepter of all
<PB N="250" REF="275"/>
the Scottish princes, who had governed the nation, since
its first establishment in the island. This prince died in
1286 by a fall from his horse at Kinghorn<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. i. p. 29. Trivet, p. 267.</NOTE>, without
leaving any male issue, and without any descendants, ex∣cept
Margaret, born of Eric, King of Norway, and of
Margaret, daughter of the Scottish monarch. This prin∣cess,
commonly called the maid of Norway, tho' a fe∣male,
and an infant, and a foreigner, yet being the law∣ful
heir of the kingdom, had, thro' her grandfather's
care, been recognized successor by the states of Scotland<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 266.</NOTE>;
and on Alexander's death, the dispositions, which had
been previously made against that event, appeared so just
and prudent, that no disorders, as might naturally be
apprehended, ensued in the kingdom. Margaret was
acknowledged queen of Scotland; five guardians, the
bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow, the earls of Fife
and Buchan, and James, steward of Scotland, entered
peaceably upon the administration; and the infant prin∣cess,
under the protection of Edward, her great uncle,
and Eric, her father, who exerted themselves on this
occasion, seemed firmly seated on the throne of Scotland.
The English monarch was naturally engaged to build
mighty projects on this event; and having lately, by
force of arms, brought Wales under subjection, he
attempted, by the marriage of Margaret with his eldest
son, Edward, to unite the whole island into one monar∣chy,
and thereby to give it full security both against de∣mestic
convulsions and foreign invasions. The amity,
which had of late prevailed between the two nations, and
which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1298.</NOTE> even in former times, had never been interrupted
by any violent wars or injuries, facilitated extremely the
execution of this project, so favourable to the happiness
and grandeur of both kingdoms; and the states of Scot∣land

readily gave their assent to the English proposals,
and even<NOTE PLACE="marg">1290.</NOTE> agreed, that their young sovereign should be
educated in the court of Edward. Anxious, however,
for the liberty and independancy of their country, they
took care to stipulate very equitable conditions, ere they
entrusted themselves into the hands of so great and so
ambitious a monarch; that they should enjoy all their
antient laws, liberties, and customs; that in case young
Edward and Margaret should die without issue, the
crown of Scotland should revert to the next heirs, and
should be inherited by them free and independent; that
the military tenants of the crown should never be o∣bliged
to go out of Scotland, in order to do homage to
the sovereign of the united kingdoms, nor the; chapters
of cathedral, collegiate or conventual churches, in order
to make elections; that the parliaments, summoned for
Scots affairs, should always, be held within the bounds
of that kingdom; and that Edward should bind himself,
under the penalty of 100,000 marks, payable to the Pope
for the use of the holy wars, to observe all these articles<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 482.</NOTE>.
It is not easy to conceive that two nations could have
treated more on a footing of equality than Scotland and
England maintained during the course of this whole
transaction: And tho' Edward gave his assent to the ar∣ticle,
concerning the future independancy of the Scot∣tish
crown, with a <HI>saving of his former rights;</HI> this re∣serve
gave no alarm, to the nobility of Scotland, both
because these rights, having been hitherto little heard
of, had occasioned no disturbance, and because the Scots
had so near a prospect of seeing them entirely absorbed
in the rights of their sovereignty.</P>
<P>BUT this project,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1291.</NOTE> so happily formed and so amicably
conducted, failed of success, by the sudden death of the
<PB N="252" REF="277"/>
Norvegian princess, who expired on her passage to Scot∣land<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 30. Trivet, p. 268.</NOTE>,
and left a very dismal prospect to the kingdom.
Tho' disorders were for the present obviated by the au∣thority
of the regency formerly established,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competi∣tors for the crown of Scotland.</NOTE> the succes∣sion
of the crown itself was now become an object of
dispute; and the regents could not expect, that a con∣troversy,
which is not usually decided by reason and ar∣gument
alone, would be peaceably settled by them,
or even by the states of the kingdom, amidst so
many powerful pretenders. The posterity of Wil∣liam,
King of Scotland, the prince, who was taken
prifoner by Henry II. being all extinct by the death
of Margaret of Norway; the right to the crown
was devolved on the line of David, earl of Hunting∣ton,
brother to William, whose male line, being al∣so
extinct, left the succession open to the posterity of his
daughters. The earl of Huntington had three daugh∣ters;
Margaret, married to Alan lord of Galloway, Isa∣bella,
wife of Robert Brus or Bruce, lord of Annandale,
and Adama, who espoused Henry lord Hastings. Mar∣garet,
the eldest of the three sisters, left one daughter,
Devergilda, married to John Baliol, by whom she had a
son of the same name, one of the present candidates for
the crown: Isabella the second bore a son, Robert Bruce,
who was now alive, and also insisted on his claim;
Adama the third left a son, John Hastings, who pretended
that the kingdom of Scotland, like many other inheri∣tances,
was divisible among the three daughters of the
earl of Huntington, and that he, in the right of his
mother, had a title to the third of it. Baliol and Bruce
united against Hastings, in maintaining that the suc∣cession
to the crown was impartible; but each of them,
supported by plausible rcasons, asserted the preference of
his own title. Baliol was sprung from the elder branch;
Bruce was one degree nearer the common stock: If the
<PB N="253" REF="278"/>
right of representation was regarded, the former had the
better claim: If propinquity was considered, the latter
was entitled to the preference<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. i. p. 36.</NOTE>: The sentiments of men
were divided: All the nobility had taken part with one
side or the other: The people followed implicitly their
leaders: The two canditates themselves had great power
and numerous retainers in Scotland: And it is no wonder,
that among a rude people, more accustomed to arms than
enured to laws, a controversy of this nature, which
could not be decided by any former precedent among
them, and which is capable of exciting commotions in
the most legal and best established governments, should
threaten the state with the most fatal convulsions.</P>
<P>EACH age has its peculiar mode in conducting business;
and men, guided more by custom than by reason, follow,
without enquiry, the manners, which are prevalent in
their own time. The present practice, in the contro∣versies
between states and princes, seems to have been to
choose a foreign prince, as an equal arbiter, by whom
the question was decided, and whose sentence prevented
those dismal confusions and disorders, inseparable at all
times from war, but which were multiplied an hundred
fold, and dispersed into every corner, by the nature of
the feudal governments. It was thus that the English
king and barons, in the foregoing reign, had endeavoured
to compose their domestic dissensions by a reference to the
King of France; and the celebrated integrity of that
monarch had prevented all the bad effects, which might
naturally have been dreaded from so perilous an expe∣dient.
It was thus, that the kings of France and Arragon,
and afterwards other princes, had submitted their con∣troversies
to Edward's judgment; and the remoteness of
their states, the great power of the princes, and the lit∣tle
interest, which he had on either side, had induced
him to acquit himself with honour in his decisions. The
<PB N="254" REF="279"/>
parliament of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reference to Edward.</NOTE> therefore, threatened with a fu∣rious
civil war, and allured by the great reputation of
the English monarch, as well as by the present amica∣ble
correspondence between the kingdoms, agreed in
making a reference to Edward; and Fraser, bishop of
St. Andrews, with other deputies, was sent to notify to
him their resolution, and to claim his good offices in the
present dangers to which they were exposed<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 31.</NOTE>. His in∣clination,
they flattered themselves, led him to prevent
their diffensions, and to interpose with a power, which
none of the candidates would dare to withstand: When
this expedient was proposed by one party, the other
deemed it dangerous to object to it: Indifferent persons
thought that the imminent perils of a civil war would
thereby be prevented: And no one reflected on the ambi∣tious
character of Edward, and the almost certain ruin,
which must attend a small state, divided by factions, when
it thus implicitely submits itself to the will of so powerful
and encroaching a neighbour.</P>
<P>THE temptation was too strong for the virtue of the
English monarch to resist.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homage of Scotland.</NOTE> He proposed to lay hold of the
present favourable opportunity, and if not to create, at
least to revive, his claim of a feudal superiority over Scot∣land;
a claim which had hitherto lain in the deepest ob∣scurity,
and which, if ever it had been an object of at∣tention,
or had been so much as suspected, would have
effectually prevented the Scottish barons from choosing
him for an umpire. He well knew, that, if this pretension
was once submitted to, as it seemed difficult in the pre∣sent
situation of Scotland to oppose it, the absolute so∣vereignty
of that kingdom, (which had been the case
with Wales) would soon follow; and that one great vas∣sal,
cooped up in an island with his liege lord, without
resource from foreign powers, without aid from any fel∣low
<PB N="255" REF="280"/>
vassals, could not long maintain his dominions a∣gainst
the efforts of a mighty kingdom, assisted by all
the cavils which the feudal law afforded his superior
against him. In pursuit of this great object, very ad∣vantageous
to England, perhaps in the end no less be∣neficial
to Scotland, but extremely unjust and iniquitous
in itself, Edward busied himself in searching for proofs
of his pretended superiority; and instead of looking into
his own archives, which, if his claim had been real,
must have afforded him numerous records of the ho∣mages
paid by the Scottish princes, and could alone yield
him any authentic testimony, he made all the monaste∣ries
be ransacked for old chronicles and histories wrote by
Englishmen, and he collected all the passages, which
seemed any wise to favour his pretensions<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 55.</NOTE>. Yet even
in this method of proceeding, which must have discovered
to himself the injustice of his claim, he was far from
being fortunate. He began his proofs from the time of
Edward the elder, and continued them thro' all the
Saxon and Norman times; but produced nothing to his
purpose<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 559.</NOTE>. The whole amount of his authorities during
the Saxon period, when stripped of the bombast and in∣accurate
style of the monks, is, that the Scots had some∣times
been defeated by the English, had received peace
on disadvantageous terms, had made submissions to the
English monarch, and had even perhaps fallen into some
dependance on a power, which was so much superior,
and which they had not at that time sufficient force to
resist. His authorities from the Norman period were, if
possible, still less conclusive: The historians indeed make
frequent mention of an homage paid by the northern po∣tentate;
but no one of them says that it was done for
his kingdom, and several of them declare, in express
terms, that it was relative only to the fiefs which he en∣joyed
<PB N="256" REF="281"/>
south of the Tweed<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 492. 662. M. Paris, p. 109. M. Westm, p. 256.</NOTE>; in the same manner, as the
King of England himself swore fealty to the French mo∣narch,
for the fiefs, which he inherited in France. And
to such scandalous shifts was Edward reduced, that he
quotes a paffage from Hoveden<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P. 662.</NOTE>, where it is asserted,
that a Scottish King had done homage to England; but
he purposely omits the latter part of the same sentence,
which expresses that this prince did homage for the lands,
which he held in England.</P>
<P>WHEN William, King of Scotland, was taken prifo∣ner
in the battle of Alnwic, he was obliged, for the re∣covery
of his liberty, to swear fealty to the victor for
his crown itself. The deed was performed according to
all the rites of the seudal law: The record was pre∣served
in the English archives, as well as mentioned by
all the historians: But as it is the only one of the kind,
and as historians speak of this superiority as a great ac∣quifition
gained by the fortunate arms of Henry II.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Neubr, lib. ii. cap, 4., Knyghton, p. 2392.</NOTE>
there can remain no doubt, that the kingdom of Scotland
was, in all former periods, entirely free and inde∣pendant.
Its subjection continued a very few years:
King Richard, desirous, before his departure for the Holy
Land, to conciliate the friendship of William, re∣nounced
that homage, which he says in express terms,
had been extorted by his father; and he only retained the
usual homage which had been done by the Scottish princes
for the lands, which they held in England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this transaction rendered the independance
of Scotland still more unquestionable, than if no fealty
had ever been sworn to the English crown; the Scottish
Kings, apprized of the point aimed at by their powerful
neighbours, seem for a long time to have retained some
jealousy on that head, and in doing homage, to have
anxiously obviated all such pretensions. When William
<PB N="257" REF="282"/>
in 1200 did homage to John at Lincoln, he was careful
to insert a salvo for his royal dignity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 811.</NOTE>: When Alexan∣der
III. sent assistance to his father-in-law, Henry III.
during the barons wars, he previously procured an ac∣knowledgment,
that this aid was only granted from friend∣ship,
not from any right claimed by the English mo∣narch<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">vol. ii. p. 844.</NOTE>:
And when the same prince was invited to assist
at the coronation of this very Edward, he declined at∣tendance,
till he received a like acknowledgment<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>Rymer, vol. ii. p. 216, 845. There cannot be the least question, that the homage usually paid by the kings of Scotland was not for their crown, but for some other territory. The only question remains, what that territory was? It was not always for the earldom of Huntington, nor the honour of Penryth; because we find it sometimes done at a time when these possessions were not in the hands of the kings of Scotland. It is probable, that the homage was performed in general terms without any particular specification of territory; and this inaccuracy had pro∣ceeded either from some dispute between the two kings about the terri∣tory and some opposite claims, which were compromised by the general homage, or from the simplicity of the age, which employed few words in every transaction. To prove this we need but look into the letter of King Richard, where he resigns the homage of Scotland, reserving the usual homage. His words are, <HI>Sapedietus W. Rex ligius bomo noster deveniat de omnibus terris de quibus antecessores fui antecessorum nostrorum ligli bomenes fuerunt, et nobis atque baeredibus nostris fideletatem jurent.</HI> Rymer, vol. i. p. 65. These general terms were probably copied from the usual form of the homage itself.</P>
<P>It is no proof that the kings of Scotland possessed no lands nor baro∣nies in England, because we cannot find them in the imperfect histories and records of that age. For instance, it appears clearly from another pas∣sage of this very letter of Richard, that the Scottish King had lands both in the county of Huntington and elsewhere in England; tho' the earl∣dom of Huntington itself was then in the person of his brother, David; and we know at present of no other baronies, which William held. It cannot be expected that we should now be able to specify all his fees which he either possessed or claimed in England; when it is probable that the two monarchs themselves and their ministers, would at that very time have differed in the lift: The Scottish King might possess some to which his right was dsputed; he might claim others, which he did not possess; And neither of the kings was willing to resign his pretensions by a particular enumeration.</P>
<P>A late author of great industry and learning, but full of prejudices, and of no penetration, Mr. Carte, has taken advantage of the undefined terms of the Scots homage, and has pretended that it was done for Lothian and Galloway, that is, all the territories of the country now called Scotland, lying south of the Clyde and Forth. But to refute this pretension at once, we need only consider, that if these territories were held in fee of the English kings, there would, by the nature of the feudal law as established in England, have been continual appeals from them to the courts of the lord Paramont; contrary to all the hi∣stories and records of that age. We find, that, as soon as Edward really established his superiority, appeals immediately commenced from all parts of Scotland: And that King, in his writ to the King's bench, considers them as a necessary consequence of the feudal tenure. Such large territories also would have supplied a considerable part of the English armies, which never could have escaped all the historians. Not to mention that there is not any instance of a Scots prisoner of war being tried as a rebel, in the many hostilities between the kingdoms, Where the Scots armies were chiefly filled from the southern counties.</P>
<P>Mr. Carte's notion with regard to Galloway, which comprehends, in the language of that age, or rather in that of the preceding, most of the south West counties of Scotland; his notion, I say, rests on so slight a foundation, that it scarce merits being refuted. He will have it (and merely because he will have it) that the Cumberland, yielded by King Edmund to Malcolm I. meant not only the county in England of that name, but all the territory northwards to the Clyde. But the case of Lothian deserves some more consideration.</P>
<P>It is certain, that in very antient language, Scotland means only the country north of the firths of Clyde and Forth. I shall not make a parade of literature to prove it; because I do not find that this point is disputed by the Scots themselves. The fouthern country was divided into Galloway and Lothian; and the latter comprehended all the fouth east counties. This territory was certainly a part of the ancient king∣dom of Northumberland, and was entirely peopled by Saxons, who af∣terwards received a great mixture of Danes among them. It appears from all the English histories, that the whole kingdom of Northumber∣land paid very little obedience to the Saxon monarchs, who governed after the dissolution of the heptarchy; and the northern and remote parts of it seem to have fallen into a kind of anarchy, fometimes pillag∣ed by the Danes, and sometimes concurring with them in their ravages upon other parts of England. The kings of Scotland, lying nearer them, took at laft possession of the country, which had scarce any go∣vernment, and we are told by Matthew of Westminster, p. 193, that King Edgar made a grant of the territory to Kenneth III. that is, he resigned claims, which he could not make effectual, Without bestowing on them more trouble and expence than they were worth: For these are the only grants of provinces made by kings; and so ambitious and active a prince as Edgar would never have given presents of any other kind. Tho' Matthew of Westminster's authority may appear small with regard to so remote a transaction; yet we may admit it in this case, because Ordericus Vitalis, a very good authority, tells us, p. 701. that Malcolm acknowledged to William Rusus, that the conqueror had confirmed to him the former grant of Lothian. But it follows not, because Edgar made this species of grant to Kenneth, that therefore he exacted homage for that territory. Homage and all the rites of the feu∣dal law were very little known to the Saxons; and we may also suppose, that the claim of Edgar was so antiquated and weak, that in resigning it, he made no very valuable concestion, and Kenneth might well refuse to hold, by so precarious a tenure, a territory, which he at present held by the sword. In short, no author says, he did homage for it.</P>
<P>The only colour indeed of authority for Mr Carte's notion is, that Matthew Paris, who wrote in the reign of Henry III. before Edward's claim of superiority was heard of, says that Alexander III. did homage to Henry III. <HI>pro Laudiano et aliis terris.</HI> See page 555. This word seems naturally to be interpreted Lothian. But in the first place, Matthew Paris's testimony, tho' considerable, will not outweigh that of all the other historians, who say that the Scots homage was always done for lands in England. Secondly, if the Scots homage was done in general terms (as has been already proved) it is no Wonder that histo∣rians should differ in their account of the object of it, fince the parties themselves were not fully agreed. Thirdly, there is reason to think that <HI>Laudianum</HI> in Matthew Paris does not mean Lothian in Scotland. There appears to have been a territory, which antiently bore that or a similar name, in the north of England, For (I) The Saxon Chro∣nicle, p. 197, says that Malcolm Kenmure met William Rufus in Lo∣dene in England. (2) It is agreed by all the historians, that Henry II. only reconquered from Scotland the northern counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmorland. See Newbriggs, p. 383. Wykes, p. 30. Hemingford, p. 492. Yet the fame country is called by other hiftorians Loidis, comitatus Lodonensis, or some such name. See M. Paris, p. 68. M. West. p. 247. Annal. Waverl. p. 159. and Diceto, p. 531. (3) This last mentioned author, when he speaks of Lothian in Scotland, calls it Loheneis, p. 574. tho' he had called the English territory Loidis. (4) King David's charter to the church of Durham, begins with this passage. <HI>Omnibus Scotis &amp; Anglis, tam in Scotia, quam in Ledoneis constitutis,</HI> &amp;c. See Spellman Gloss. in verbo <HI>Scotia.</HI> Whence we may learn, that the province of <HI>Lodoneium</HI> was not only situated south of the Tweed, but also extended beyond Durham, and made a part of England.</P>
<P>I thought this long note requisite in order to correct Mr. Carte's mi∣stake, an author whose diligence and industry has given light to many passages of the more antient English history.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="283"/>
BUT as all these reasons, (and stronger could not be
produced) were but a feeble rampart against the power
<PB N="259" REF="284"/>
of the sword, Edward, carrying with him a great army,
which was to enforce his proofs, advanced to the fron∣tiers,
<PB N="260" REF="285"/>
and invited the Scots parliament and all the com∣petitors
to attend him in the castle of Notham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th May.</NOTE> a place
situated on the southern banks of the Tweed, in order to
determine that cause, which had been referred to his ar∣bitration.
But tho' this deference seemed due to so great
a monarch, and was no more than what his father and
the English barons had, in similar circumstances, paid to
Lewis IX. the King, careful not to give umbrage, and
determined never to produce his claim, till it should be
too late to think of opposition, sent the Scottish barons
an acknowledgement, that, tho' at this time they passed
the frontiers, such a step should never be drawn into pre∣cedent,
nor assord the English kings a pretence for exact∣ing
a like submission in any future tranfactions<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 539. 845. Walling, p. 56.</NOTE>. When
the whole Scottish nation had thus unwarily put them∣selves
in his power, Edward opened the conferences at
Norham; and informed the parliament, by the mouth
of Roger le Brabancon, his chief justiciary, that he was
come thither to determine the right among the compe∣titors
<PB N="261" REF="286"/>
to their crown; that he was determined to do
strict justice to all parties; and that he was intitled to
this authority, not in virtue of the reference made to him,
but in the quality of superior and liege lord of the king∣dom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 543. It is remarkable that the English chan∣cellor spoke to the Scots parliament in the French tongue. This was also the language commonly made use of by all parties on that occasion. Ibid, passim. The most considerable of the Scots, as well as almost all the English barons, were of French origin; they valued themselves upon it; and pretended to despise the language and manners of the island. It is difficult to account for the settlernent of so many French families in Scotland, the Bruces, Baliols, St. Clairs, Montgomeries, Somervilles, Gordons, Frasers, Cummins, Colvilles, Umfrevilles, Mow∣brays, Hays, Maules, who were not supported there, as in England, by the power of the sword. But the superiority of civility and knowledge, however small, over total ignorance and barbarism, is prodigious.</NOTE>.
He then produced his proofs of this superiority,
which he pretended to be unquestionable, and he required
of them an acknowledgment of it; a demand, which
was supersiuous if the fact was already known and avowed,
and which plainly betrays Edward's consciousness of his
lame and defective title. The Scots parliament were asto∣nished
at so new a pretension, and answered only by
their silence. But the King, in order to maintain the
appearance of free and regular proceedings, desired them
to remove into their own country, to deliberate upon
his claim, to examine his proofs, to propose all their ob∣jections,
and then to inform him of their resolutions:
And he appointed a plain at Upsettleton, on the northern
banks of the Tweed, for that purpose.</P>
<P>WHEN the Scottisth barons assembled in this place, tho'
moved with indignation at the injustice of this unex∣pected
claim, and at the fraud with which it had been
conducted, they found themselves betrayed into a fitua∣tion,
in which it was impossible for them to make any
defence for the ancient liberty and independence of their
country. The King of England, a martial and politic
<PB N="262" REF="287"/>
prince, at the head of a powerful army, lay at a very small
distance, and was only separated from them by a river
fordable in many places Tho' by a sudden flight some
of them might themselves be able to make their escape;
what hopes could they entertain of fecuring the king∣dom
against his future enterprizes? Without a head,
without union among themselves, attached all of them
to different competitors, whose title they had rashly sub∣mitted
to the decision of this foreign usurper, and who
were thereby reduced to an absolute dependance upon
him; they could only expect by resistance to entail on
themselves and their posterity a more grievous and more
destructive fervitude. Yet even in this desperate state
of their affairs, the Scottish barons, as we learn from
Walsingham<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">56. M. West, p. 436. It is said by Hemingford, vol. i. p. 33. that the King menaced violently the scots barons, and forced them to compliance, at least to silence.</NOTE>, one of the best historians of that period,
had the courage to reply, that till they had a king, they
could take no resolution on so momentous a point:
The journal of King Edward says, that they made no
answer at all<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 548.</NOTE>: That is, perhaps, no <HI>particular</HI> answer
or objection to Edward's claim: And by this solution
it is possble to reconcile the journal with the historian.
The king, therefore, interpreting their silence as a con∣fent,
addressed himself to the feveral competitors, and
previously to his pronouncing sentence, required their
acknowledgement of his superiority.</P>
<P>IT is evident from the genealogy of the royal family of
Scotland, that there could only be two questions about
the succession, that between Baliol and Bruce on the
one hand, and lord Hastings on the other, concerning
the partition of the crown; and that between Baliol and
Bruce themselves, concerning the preference of their
respective titles, supposthe kingdom indivisible: Yet
there appeared on this occasion no less than nine claimants
<PB N="263" REF="288"/>
besides, who challenged the crown; John Comyn or
Cummin Lord of Badenoch, Florence earl of Holland,
Patrick Dunbar earl of March, William de Vescey,
Robert de Pynkeni, Nicholas de Soules, Patrick Galythly,
Roger de Mandeville, Robert de Ross; not to mention,
the king of Norway, who claimed as heir to his daugh∣ter
Margaret<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Walfin. p. 58.</NOTE>. Some of these competitors were de∣scended
from more remote branches of the royal family;
others were even sprung from illegitimate children; and
as none of them had the lesd pretence of right, it is
natural to conjecture, that Edward had fecretly encou∣raged
them to appear in the lift of claimants, that he
might sow the more divisions among the Scottish nobility,
make the cause appear the more intricate, and be able to
choose, among a great number, the most obsequious
candidate.</P>
<P>BUT he found them all equally obsquious this oc∣casion<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 529. 545. Walfin. p. 56. Heming. vol. i. 33 34. Trivet, p. 269. M. West. p. 415.</NOTE>.
Robert Bruce was the first who acknowledged
Edward's right of superiority over Scotland; and he had
so far forefeen the King's pretensions, that even in his
petition, where he set forth his claim to the crown, he
had previously applied to him as liege-lord of the king∣dom;
a step which was not taken by any of the other
candidates<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 577, 578, 579.</NOTE>. They all, however, with seeming willing∣ness
made a like acknowledgement when required; tho'
Baliol, left he should give offence to the Scots nation,
had taken care to be absent during the first days; and he
was the last who recognized the King's title<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 546.</NOTE>. Edward
next deliberated concerning the method of proceeding
in the discussion of this great controversy. He appointed,
that Baliol and such of the candidates
<PB N="264" REF="289"/>
as adhered to him, should choose forty commission∣ers;
Bruce and his adherents other forty: To these
the King added twenty-four Englishmen: And he order∣ed
these hundred and four conimissioners to examine the
cause deliberately among themselves, and make their re∣port
to him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 555, 556.</NOTE>: And he promised in the ensuing year to
give his determination, Mean while, he pretended, that
it was requisite to have all the fortresses of Scotland deli∣vered
into his hands, in order to enable him, without op∣position,
to put the true heir in possession of the crown;
and this exorbitant demand was complied with, both by
the states and the candidates<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 529. Walfin. p. 56, 57.</NOTE>. The governors also of
all the castles immediately resigned their command;
except Umfreville earl of Angus, who refused, without a
formal acquittal from the parliament and the several claim∣ants,
to surrender his fortresses to such a domineering
arbiter, who had given to Scotland so many just reasons
of suspicion<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 531.</NOTE>. Before this assembly broke up, which
had fixed such a mark of dishonour on the nation, all the
prelates and barons there present swore fealty to Edward;
and that prince appointed commissioners to take a like
oath of all the other barons and persons of distinction in,
Scotland<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymsr, vol. ii, p. 573.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King having finally made, as he imagined, this im∣portant
acquisition, left the commissioners to fit at Berwick,
and examine the titles of the several candidates, who claim∣ed
the precarious crown, which Edward was willing for
some time to allow the lawful heir to enjoy. He went
fouthwards, both in order to affift at the funerals of his
mother. Queen Eleanor, who died about this time, and
to compose some differences which had arifen among his
principal nobility. Gilbert earl of Glocefter, the great∣est
<PB N="265" REF="290"/>
baron of the kingdom, had espoused the King's daugh∣ter;
and being elated by that alliance, and still more by
his own exorbitant power, which, he thought, set him
above the laws, he permitted his bailiffs and vassals to
commit violences on the lands of Humphrey Bohun earl
of Hereford, who retaliated the injury by like violences.
But this was not a reign in which such illegal proceedings
could pass with impunity. Edward procured a sentence
against the two earls, committed them both to prison,
and would not restore them to their liberty, till he exact∣ed
a fine of 1000 merks from Hereford, and one of
10,000 from his son-in-law.</P>
<P>DURING this interval,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1292.</NOTE> the titles of John Baliol and
of Robert Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Award of Edward in favour of Baliol.</NOTE> whose claims appeared to be the best
founded among the competitors to the crown of Scotland,
were the subject of general disquisition, as well as of
debate among the commissioners. Edward, in order to
give greater authority to his intended decision, proposed
this general question both to the assembly, and to all the
celebrated lawyers in Europe; Whether a person de∣scended
from the eldest sister, but farther removed by one
degree, was preferable in the succession of kingdoms,
fiefs, and other impartible inheritances, to one descended
from the younger sister, but one degree nearer the
common stock? This was the true state of the case; and
the right of representation had now gained such ground
every where, that an uniform answer was returned to
the King in the affirmative. He therefore pronounced
sentence in favour of Baliol; and when Bruce, upon
this disappointment, joined afterwards lord Hastings, and
claimed a third of the kingdom, which he now pretend∣ed
to be divisible, Edward, tho' the interests of his am∣bition
seemed more to require the partition of Scotland,
again pronounced sentence in favour of Baliol. That
candidate, upon renewing his oath of fealty to England,
<PB N="266" REF="291"/>
was put in possession of the kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 590, 591, 593, 600.</NOTE>; all his fortresses
were restored to him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 590.</NOTE>; and the conduct of Edward,
both in the deliberate solemnity of the proceedings, and
in the justice of his award, was so far unexceptionable.</P>
<P>HAD the King entertained no other view than that
of establishing his superiority over Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1239.</NOTE> tho' the ini∣quity
of that claim was apparent, and was aggravated by
the most egregious breach of trust, he might have fixed
his pretensions, and have left that important acquisition
to his posterity: But he immediately proceeded in such a
manner, as made it apparent, that, not contented with
this usurpation, he aimed also at the absolute sovereignty
and dominion of the kingdom. Instead of gradually
enuring the Scots to bear the yoke, and exerting his
rights of superiority with moderation, he encouraged all
appeals to England; required King John himself, by fix
different summons on trivial occasions, to come to London<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 603, 605, 606, 608, 615, 616.</NOTE>;
refused him the privilege of defending his cause
by a procurator; and obliged him to appear at the bar of
his parliament as a private person<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ryley's Placit. Parl. p. 152, 153.</NOTE>. These humiliating
demands were hitherto quite unknown to a King of
Scotland: They are however the necessary consequences
of vassalage by the feudal law; and as there was no pre∣ceding
instance of such treatment submitted to by a prince
of that country, Edward must, from that circumstance
alone, had there remained any doubt, have been himself
convinced, that his claim was altogether an usurpation<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See Rymer, vol. ii. p. 533, where Edward writes to the King's Bench to receive appeals from Scotland. He knew the practice to be unusual; yet he establishes it as an infallible consequence of his superiority. We learn also from the same book, p. 603, that immediately upon receiving the homage, he changed the style of his address to the Scots King, whom he now calls <HI>dilecto &amp; fideli,</HI> instead of <HI>fratri dilecto &amp; fideli,</HI> the appellation which he had always before used to him; fee p. 109, 124, 168, 280, 1064. This is a certain proof, that he himself was not deceived, as was scarce indeed possible, but that he was consci∣ous of his usurpation. Yet he solemnly swore afterwards to the justice of his pretensions, when he defended them before Pope Boniface.</NOTE>.
<PB N="267" REF="292"/>
But his intention plainly was, to enrage Baliol by these
indignities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1293.</NOTE> to engage him in rebellion, and to assume
the dominion of the state as the punishment of his trea∣son
and felony. Accordingly Baliol, tho' a prince of a
soft and gentle spirit, returned into Scotland highly prov∣oked
at this usage, and determined at all hazards to
vindicate his liberty; and the war, which soon after
broke out between France and England, gave him a fa∣vourable
opportunity for executing his purpose.</P>
<P>THE violences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> robberies and disorders, to which
that age was so subject, were not con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined to the licenti∣ous
barons and their retainers at land: The sea was
equally infested with pyracy: The weak execution of
the laws had given licence to all orders of men: And a
general appetite for rapine and revenge, supported by a
false point of honour, had also infected the merchants
and mariners, and pushed them, on any provocation, to
seek redress, by immediate retaliation upon the aggres∣sors.
A Norman and English ship met off the coast near
Bayonne; and having both occasion for fresh water,
they sent their boats to land, and the several crews came
at the fame time to the same spring: There ensued a
quarrel for the preference: A Norman, drawing his dag∣ger,
attempted to stab an Englishman; who, grappling
with him, threw his adversary on the ground; and the
Norman, as was pretended, falling on his own dagger, was
slain<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Walsin. p. 58. Heming, vol. i. p. 39.</NOTE>. This scuffle between two seamen about water,
kindled soon a bloody war between the two nations,
and involved a great part of Europe in the quarrel. The
<PB N="268" REF="293"/>
mariners of the Norman ship carried their complaints to
the French King: Philip, without enquiring into the
truth, without asking for redress, bid them take revenge,
and trouble him no more about the matter<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Walfin. p. 58.</NOTE>. The Nor∣mans,
who had been more regular than usual in applying
to the crown, needed but this hint to proceed to immedi∣ate
violence. They seized an English ship in the chan∣nel;
and hanging, along with some dogs, several; of the
crew on the yard-arm, in prefence of their companions,
dismissed the vessel<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 40. M. West. p. 419.</NOTE>; and bad the mariners inform their
countrymen, that vengeance was now taken for the
blood of the Norman killed at Bayonne. This injury,
accompanied by so general and deliberate an insult, was
resented by the mariners of the cinque ports, who, with∣out
carrying any complaints to the King, or waiting for
redress, retaliated by committing like barbarities on all
French vessels without distinction. The French, pro∣voked
by their losses, preyed on the ships of all Edward's
subjects, whether English or Gascon: The sea became
a scene of pyracy between the nations: The sovereigns,
without either seconding or repressing the violence of
their subjects, seemed to continue indifferent spectators:
The English made private associations with the Irish and
Dutch seamen; the French with the Flemish and
Genoese<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 40.</NOTE>: And the animosities of the people on both
sides became every day more violent and barbarous. A
fleet of two hundred Norman vessels set sail to the south
for wine and other commodities; and in their passage,
seized all the English ships which they met with; hanged
the seamen, and seized the goods. The inhabitants of the
English sea ports, informed of this event, fitted out a
fleet of sixty sail, stronger and better manned than the
others; and awaited the enemy on their return. After
<PB N="269" REF="294"/>
an obstinate battle, they put them to rout, and sunk, de∣stroyed,
or took the greatest part of them<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Walfin. p. 60. Trivet, p. 474. Chron. Dunst. vol. ii. p. 609.</NOTE>. No quarter
was given, and it is pretended, that the loss of the French
on this occasion amounted to 15,000 men: Which is
accounted for by this circumstance, that the Norman
fleet was employed in transporting a considerable body of
soldiers from the south.</P>
<P>THE affair was now become too important to be any
longer overlooked by the princes. On Philip's sending
an envoy to demand reparation and restitution, the King
dispatched the bishop of London to the French court, in
order to accommodate the quarrel. He first said, that
the English courts of justice were open to all men; and
if any Frenchman were injured, he might seek repara∣tion
by course of law<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 275.</NOTE>. He next offered to adjust the
matter by private arbiters, or by personal interview with
the King of France, or by a reference either to the Pope
or the college of cardinals, or any particular cardinals,
agreed on by both parties<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 275.</NOTE>. The French, probably
the more disgusted, as they were hitherto losers in the
quarrel, refused all these expedients: The vessels and the
goods of merchants were confiscated on both sides: De∣predations
were continued by the Gascons on all the
western coasts of France, as well as by the English in
the channel: Philip cited the King, as duke of Guienne,
to appear in his court at Paris, and answer for these of∣fences:
And Edward, apprehensive of danger to that
province, sent John St. John, an experienced soldier,
to Bourdeaux, and gave him directions to put Guienne
in a posture of defence<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 276.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT he might however prevent a final rupture be∣tween
the nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1294.</NOTE> the King dispatched his brother, Ed∣mond,
<PB N="270" REF="295"/>
Earl of Lancaster, to Paris; and as that prince
had espoused the Queen of Navarre, mother to Jane
Queen of France, he seemed, on account of that alliance,
the most proper person for finding expedients to accom∣modate
the difference, Jane pretended to interpose with
her good offices: Mary, the Queen-dowager, feigned
the fame amicable disposition: And these two princesses
told Edmond, that the circumstance, the most difficult to
adjust, was the point of honour with Philip, who thought
himself affronted by the injuries committed against him
by his sub-vassals in Guienne: But if once Edward
would consent to give him seizin and possession of that
province, he would think his honour fully repaired,
would engage to restore it immediately, and would ac∣cept
of a very easy satisfaction for all the other injuries.
The King was consulted on this occasion, and as he then
found himself in immediate danger of war with the Scots,
which he regarded as the more important concern, this
politic prince, blinded by his favourite passion for subdu∣ing
that nation, allowed himself to be deceived by so
gross an artifice<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 619, 620. Walfin. p. 61. Heming. vol. i, p. 42, 43. Trivet, p. 277.</NOTE>. He sent his brother orders to sign
and execute the treaty with the two Queens; Philip so∣lemnly
promised to execute his part of it; and the
King's citation to appear in the court of France, was
accordingly recalled: But the French monarch was no
sooner put in possession of Guienne, than the citation
was renewed; Edward was condemned for non-appear∣ance;
and Guienne, by a formal sentence, was declared
to be forfeited and annexed to the crown<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 620, 622. Walfin.p. 61. Trivet, p. 278.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD, fallen into a like snare with that which he
had spread for the Scots, was enraged; and the more so,
as he was justly ashamed of his own conduct, in being so
<PB N="271" REF="296"/>
egregiousfly over–reached by the court of France. Sensi∣ble
of the extreme difficulties, which he would encounter
in the recovery of Gascony, where he had not retained a
single place in his hands; he endeavoured to compensate
that loss, by forming alliances with several European
princes, who, he proposed, should attack France on all
quarters, and make a diversion of her forces. Adolphus
de Nassau, King of the Romans, entered into a treaty
with him for that purpose<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 51.</NOTE> as did also Amad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us, count
of Savoy, the archbishop of Cologne, the counts of
Gueldre and Luxembourg; the duke of Brabant and
count of Barre, who had married his two daughters,
Margaret and Eleanor: But these alliances were ex∣tremely
burdensome on his narrow revenues, and proved
in the issue entirely ineffectual. More impression was
made on Guienne by an English army, which he com∣pleated
by emptying the jails of many thousand thieves
and robbers, who had been confined there for their
crimes. So low had the profession of arms fallen, and
so much had it degenerated from the footing, on which
it stood during the vigour of the feudal system!</P>
<P>THE King himself was detained in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1295.</NOTE> first by
contrary winds<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. ii. p. 622.</NOTE>, then by his apprehensions of a Scots
invasion, and by a rebellion of the Welsh, whom he
repressed and brought again under subjection<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Walfing. p 62. Heming. vol. i. p. 55. Trivet, p. 282. Chron. Dunst. vol. ii. p. 622.</NOTE>. The
army, which he sent to Guienne, was commanded by
his nephew, John de Bretagne, earl of Richmond, and
under him by St. John, Tibetot, de Vere, and other
officers of reputation<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p, 279.</NOTE>; who made themselves masters of
the town of Bayonne, as well as of Bourg, Blaye,
Rions, St. Severe, and other places, which straitened
Bourdeaux, and cut off its communication both by sea
<PB N="272" REF="297"/>
and land. The favour, which the Gascon nobility bore
to the English government, facilitated these conquests,
and seemed to promise still greater successes; but this
advantage was soon lost by the misconduct of some of
the officers. Philip's brother, Charles de Valois, who
commanded the French armies, having laid siege to Po∣densac,
a small fortress near Rions, obliged Gissard, the
governor, to capitulate; and the articles, tho' favourable
to the English, left all the Gascons prisoners at discre∣tion,
of whom about fifty were hanged by Charles as re∣bels:
A policy, by which he both intimidated that peo∣ple,
and produced an irreparable breach between them
and the English<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 49.</NOTE>. That prince immediately attacked
Rions, where the earl of Richmond himself commanded;
and as the place seemed not very defensible, the English
general drew his troops to the water-side with an inten∣tion
of embarking with the greatest part of the army.
The enraged Gascons fell upon his rear, and at the same
time opened their gates to the French, who, besides
making themselves matters of the place, took many pri∣soners
of distinction. St. Severe was more vigorously
defended by Hugh de Vere, son to the earl of Oxford;
but was at last obliged to capitulate. The French King,
not contented with these successes in Gascony, threaten∣ed
England with an invasion; and by a sudden attempt,
his troops took and burnt Dover<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 284. Chron, Dunst. vol. ii. p. 642.</NOTE>, but were obliged soon
after to retire. And in order to make a greater diversion
of the English force, and engage Edward in dangerous
and important wars, he formed a secret alliance with
John Baliol, King of Scotland; the commencement of
that strict: union, which, during so many ages, was
maintained, by mutual interests and necessities, between
the French and Scottish nations. John confirmed this
<PB N="273" REF="298"/>
alliance by stipulating a marriage between his eldest son
and the daughter of Philip de Valois<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii, p. 680, 681. 695. 697. Heming. vol. i. p. 76. Trivet, p. 285.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE expences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Digression concerning the consti∣tution of paliament.</NOTE> attending these multiplied wars of Ed∣ward,
and his preparations for war, joined to altera∣tions,
which had insensibly taken place in the general
state of affairs, obliged him to have frequent recourse to
parliamentary supplies, introduced the lower orders of
the state into the publick councils, and laid the founda∣tions
of great and important changes in the government.
Tho' nothing could be worse calculated for cultivating
the arts of peace or maintaining peace itself, than the
long subordination of vassalage from the King to the
meanest gentleman, and the consequent slavery of the
lower people, evils inseparable from the feudal system;
that system was never able to fix the state in a proper
warlike posture, or give it the full exertion of its power
for defence, and still less for offence, against a public
enemy. The military tenants, unacquainted with obe∣dience,
unexperienced in war, held a rank in the troops
by their birth, not by their merits or services; composed
a very disorderly and consequently a very feeble army;
and during the few days, which they were obliged by
their tenures to remain in the field, were often more formi∣dable
to their own prince than to foreign powers, against
whom they were assembled. The sovereigns came gra∣dually
to disuse this cumbersome and dangerous machine,
so apt to recoil upon the hand which held it; and ex∣changing
the military service for pecuniary supplies, in∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted
forces by means of a contract with particular offi∣cers,
(such as those the Italians denominate <HI>Condottieri</HI>)
whom they dismissed at the end of the war. The barons
and knights themselves often entered into these en∣gagements
with the prince, and were enabled to fill their
<PB N="274" REF="299"/>
bands, both by the authority which they possessed over
their vassals and tenants, and from the great numbers of
loose, disorderly people, whom they found on their
estates, and who willingly embraced an opportunity of
gratifying their appetite for war and rapine. Mean∣while,
the old Gothic fabric, being neglected, went
gradually to decay; and tho' the conqueror had divided
all the lands of England into sixty thousand knight's fees,
the number of these was insensibly diminished by various
artifices; and the King at last found, that, by putcing
the law in execution, he could assemble only a very small
part of the antient force of the kingdom. It was an
usual expedient for men, who held of the King or a great
baron by military tenure, to transfer their land to the
church, and receive them back by another tenure called
frankalmoigne, by which they were not bound to per∣form
any service<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Madox's Baronia Anglica, p. 114.</NOTE>. A law was made against this prac∣tice;
but the abuse had probably gone far before it was
attended to, and probably was not entirety corrected by
the new statute, which, like most of the laws of that
age, we may conjecture to have been but feebly executed
by the magistrate against the perpetual interests of so ma∣ny
individuals. The constable and mareschal, when
they mustered the armies, often in a hurry, and for want
of better information, received the service of a baron
for fewer knight's fees, than were due by him; and one
precedent of this kind was held good against the King,
and became ever after a reason for diminishing the ser∣vice<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Madox's Baronia Anglica, p. 115.</NOTE>.
The rolls of knight's fees were very inaccurately
kept; no care was taken to clear them before the armies
were summoned into the field<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">We hear only of one King, Henry II. who took this pains; and the record, called Liber niger Scaccarii, was the result of it.</NOTE>; it was then too late to
<PB N="275" REF="300"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk of examining records and charters; and the service
was accepted on the footing which the vassal himself was
pleased to acknowledge, after all the various subdivisions
and conjunctions of property had thrown an obscurity on
the nature and extent of his tenure<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Madox, Bar. Ang. p. 116.</NOTE>. It is easy to judge
of the intricacies which would attend disputes of this
kind with individuals; when even the number of military
fees, belonging to the church, whose property was fixed
and unalienable, became the subject of controversy; and
we find in particular, that when the bishop of Durham
was charged with seventy knights fees for the aid levied
to marry Henry II's daughter to the duke of Saxony, the
prelate acknowledged ten, and disowned the other sixty<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Madox, Bar. Ang. p, 112. Hist. of the Exch. p. 404.</NOTE>.
It is not known in what manner this difference was ter∣minated;
but had the question been concerning an ar∣mament
to defend the kingdom, the bishop's service
would probably have been received without opposition for
ten fees, and this rate must also have fixed all his future
payments. Pecuniary scutages, therefore, diminished as much as
military services<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">order to pay the fum of 100,000 marks, as King Richard's ran∣som, twenty shillings were imposed on each knight's fee. Had the fees remained on the original footing, as settled by the conqueror, this scutage would have amounted to 90,000 marks, which was nearly the sum required: But we find, that many other grievous taxes were im∣posed to complete it: A certain proof, that many frauds and abuses had prevailed in the roll of knights fees.</NOTE>: Other methods of filling the
exchequer as well as the armies must be devised: New
situations produced new laws and institutions: And the
great alterations in the finances and military power of the
crown, as well as in private property, were the source of
equal innovations in every part of the legislature or ci∣vil
government.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="301"/>
THE exorbitant estates, conferred by the Norman, on
his barons and chieftains, remained not long entire and
unimpaired. The landed property was gradually shared
out into more hands; and those immense baronies were
divided, either by provisions to younger children, by par∣titions
among co-heirs, by sale, or by escheating to the
King, who gratified a great number of his courtiers, by
dealing them out among them in smaller portions. Such
moderate estates, as they required oeconomy, and con∣fined
the proprietors to their own houses, were better
calculated for duration; and the order of knights and
small barons grew daily more numerous, and began to
form a very respectable rank or order in the state. As
they were all of them immediate vassals of the crown by
military tenure, they were, from the principles of the feudal
law, equally intitled with the greatest barons, to a seat
in the national or general councils; and this right, tho'
regarded as a privilege, which the owners would not en∣tirely
relinquish, was also considered as a burthen, which
they desired to be subjected to only on extraordinary oc∣casions.
Hence it was provided in the charter of King
John, that, while the great barons were summoned to
the general council by a particular writ, the small barons,
under which appellation the knights were also compre∣hended,
should only be called by a general summons of
the sheriff. The distinction between great and small
barons, like that between rich and poor, was not ex∣actly
defined; but, agreeable to the inaccurate genius of
that age and to the simplicity of antient government, was
left very much to be determined by the discretion of
the King and his ministers. It was usual for the prince
to require, by a particular summons, the attendance of a
baron in one parliament, and to neglect him in future
<PB N="277" REF="302"/>
parliaments<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chancellor West's enquiry into the manner of creating peers, p. 43. 46, 47. 55.</NOTE>; nor was this uncertainty ever complained
of as an injury. He attended when required: He was
better pleased on other occasions to be exempted from the
burthen: And as he was acknowledged to be of the same
order with the greatest barons, it gave them no surprize
to see him take his seat in the great councils, whether he
appeared of his own accord, or by a particular summons
from the king. The barons by <HI>Writ,</HI> therefore, began
gradually to intermix themselves with the ancient barons
from <HI>Tenure;</HI> and as Camden tells us<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In Britann. p. 122.</NOTE>, from an ancient
manuscript, now lost, that after the battle of Evesham,
a positive law was enacted, prohibiting every baron to
appear in parliament, who was not invited thither by a
particular summons, the whole baronage of England held
thenceforward their seat by writ, and this important
privilege of their tenures was in effect: abolished. Only
where writs had been regularly continued for some time
in one great family, the omission of them would have
been regarded as an affront, and even as an injury.</P>
<P>A LIKE alteration gradually took place in the order of
earls, who were the highest rank of barons. The dignity
of an earl, like that of a baron, was antiently territorial
and official<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spellm. Gloss. in voce <HI>Comis.</HI></NOTE>: He exercised jurisdiction within his
county: He levied the third of the fines to his own profit:
He was at once a civil and a military magistrate: And
tho' his authority, from the first conquest of the Nor∣mans,
was hereditary in England, the title was so much
connected with the office, that where the King intended
to create a new earl, he had no other expedient than to
erect a certain territory into a county or earldom, and
<PB N="278" REF="303"/>
to bestow it upon the person and his Family<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Essays on British antiquities. This practice, however, seems to have been more familiar in Scotland and the kingdoms on the con∣tinent, than in England.</NOTE>. But as
the sheriffs, who were the vice-gerents of the earls,
were named by the King, and removeable at pleasure, he
found them more dependant upon him; and endeavoured
to throw the whole authority and jurisdiction of the office
into their hands. This magistrate was at the head of the
finances, and levied all the King's rents within his
county: He assessed at pleasure the talliages of the inha∣bitants
in royal demesne: He had usually committed to
him the management of wards and often of escheats: He
presided in the lower courts of judicature: And thus,
tho' inferior to the earl in dignity, he was soon con∣sidered,
by this union of the judicial and fiscal powers,
and by the confidence reposed in him by the King, as
much superior to him in authority, and undermined his
influence within his own jurisdiction<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">There are instances of princes of the blood who accepted of the of∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oc of sheriff. Spellman in voce <HI>Vicecomis.</HI></NOTE>. It became usual,
in creating an earl, to give him a fixt sallary, commonly
about twenty pounds a year, in lieu of his third of the
fines: The diminution of his power kept pace with the
retrenchment of his profit: And the dignity of earl, in∣stead
of territorial and official, dwindled into personal
and titular. Such were the mighty alterations, which
had already fully taken place, or were gradually advan∣cing,
in the house of peers; that is, in the parliament:
For there was antiently no other house.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the introduction of barons by writ, and of
titular earls, had given some encrease to the royal autho∣rity;
there were other causes, which counterballanced
those innovations, and tended in a higher degree to di∣minish
the power of the sovereign. The di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use, into
<PB N="279" REF="304"/>
which the feudal militia had in a great measure fallen,
made the barons almost entirely forget their dependence
on the crown: By the diminution of the number of
knights fees, the King had no reasonable compensation
when he levied scutages and exchanged their services for
money: The alienations of the crown lands had reduced
him to poverty: And above all, the concession of the
great charter had set bounds to royal authority, and had
rendered it more difficult and dangerous for the prince to
exert any extraordinary acts of arbitrary power. In
this situation it was natural for the King to court the
friendship of the lesser barons and knights, whose in∣fluence
was nowise dangerous to him, and who, being
exposed to oppression from their powerful neighbours,
sought a legal protection under the shadow of the throne.
He desired, therefore, to have their presence in parlia∣ment,
where they served to controul the turbulent reso∣lutions
of the great. To exact a regular attendance of
the whole body would have produced confusion, and
would have imposed too heavy a burden upon them. To
summon only a few by writ, tho' it was practised and
had a good effect, served not entirely the King's purpose;
because these members had no farther authority than
attended their personal character, and were eclipsed by
the appearance of the more powerful nobility. He there∣fore
dispensed with the attendance of most of the lesser
barons in parliament; and in return for this indul∣gence,
(for such it was then esteemed) required them
to choose in each county a certain number of their
own body, whose charges they bore, and who, hav∣ing
gained the confidence, carried with them, of
course, the authority of the whole order. This ex∣pedient
had been practised at different times, in the
<PB N="280" REF="305"/>
reign of Henry III.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rot. Claus. 38 Hen. III. m. 7. and 12 d: As also Rot. Claus. 42 Hen. III. m. I. d. Pryrne's pref. to Cotton's Abridgement.</NOTE> and regularly, during that of the
present King. The numbers sent up by each county
varied at the will of the prince<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">Brady's answer to Petyt, from the records, p. 151.</NOTE>: They took their seat
among the other peers; because by their tenure they be∣longed
to that order<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Brady's Treatise of Boroughs, App. N°. 13.</NOTE>: The introducing them into that
house scarce appeared to be an innovation: And though
it was easily in the King's power, by varying their num∣ber,
to command the resolutions of the whole parliament,
this circumstance was little attended to, in an age, when
force was more prevalent than laws, and when a resolu∣tion,
tho' taken by the majority of a legal assembly,
could not be executed, if it opposed the will of the more
powerful minority.</P>
<P>BUT there were other important consequences, which
followed the diminution and di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use of the antient feudal
militia. The King's expences, in levying and maintain∣inga
military force for every enterprize, were encreased
beyond what his narrow revenues were able to bear: As
the scutages of his military tenants, which were accepted
in lieu of their personal service, had fallen to nothing;
there were no means of supply but from voluntary aids
granted him by the parliament and church: Or from the
talliages which he might levy upon the towns and inha∣bitants
in royal demesne. In the former year, Edward
had been obliged to exact no less than the sixth of all
moveables from the laity, and the half of all ecclesiastical
benefices<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Brady of boroughs, p. 31. from the records. Heming. vol. i. p. 52. M. West. p. 422. Ryley, p. 462.</NOTE> for his expedition into Poictou, and the sup∣pression
of the Welsh: And this distressful situation,
which was likely often to return upon him and his suc∣cessors,
<PB N="281" REF="306"/>
made him think of a new device, and summon
up the representatives of all the boroughs to parliament.
This period, which is the twenty third of his reign, seems
to be the real and true epoch of the house of commons;
and the first faint dawnings of popular government in
England. For the representatives of the counties were
only deputies from the smaller barons and lesser nobility:
And the former precedent of representatives from the
boroughs, who were summoned by the earl of Leicester,
was regarded as the act of a violent usurpation, had been
discontinued in all the subsequent parliaments, and if
that measure had not become necessary on other accounts,
this example was more likely to blast than give credit to it.</P>
<P>DURING the course of two centuries, the kings of Eng∣land,
in imitation of other European princes, had em∣braced
the salutary policy of encouraging and protecting
the lower and more industrious orders of the state; whom
they found well disposed to obey the laws and civil ma∣gistrate,
and whose ingenuity and labour furnished com∣modities,
requisite for the ornament of peace and support
of war. Tho' the inhabitants of the country were still
left at the disposal of their imperious lords; many at∣tempts
were made to give more security and liberty to
citizens, and make them enjoy unmolested the fruits of
their industry. Boroughs were erected by royal patent
within the demesne lands: Liberty of trade was confer∣red
upon them: The inhabitants were allowed to farm
at a fixed rent their own tolls and customs<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Madox, Firma Burgi, p. 21.</NOTE>: They were
permitted to elect their own magistrates: Justice was
distributed to them by these magistrates, without obliging
them to attend the sheriff or county courts: And some
shadow of independence was gradually acquired to the
<PB N="282" REF="307"/>
people, by means or these equitable privileges<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Brady of boroughs, App. N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>. The
King, however, retained still the power of levying tal∣liages
or taxes upon them at pleasure<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The King had not only the power of tailiating the inhabitants with∣in his own demesnes, but that of granting to particular barons the power of ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liating the inhabitants within theirs. See Brady's answer to Petyt, p. 118. Madox's Hist. of the exchequer, p. 518.</NOTE>; and tho' their
poverty and the customs of the age made these de∣mands
neither frequent nor exorbitant, such unlimited
authority in the sovereign was a sensible check upon
commerce, and was utterly incompatible with all the
principles of a free government. But when the multi∣plied
necessities of the crown produced a greater demand
for supply, the King, whose prerogative entitled him to
exact it, found, that he had not power sufficient to en∣force
his edicts, and that it was requisite, before he im∣posed
taxes, to smooth the way for his demand, and to
obtain the previous consent of the boroughs, by sollici∣tation,
remonstrances, and authority. The inconve∣nience
of transacting this business with every particular
borough was soon felt; and Edward became sensible, that
the most expeditious way of obtaining supply, was to as∣semble
together the deputies of all the boroughs, to lay
before them the necessities of the state, to discuss the
matter in their presence, and to require their consent to
the demands of their sovereign. For this reason, he issued
writs to the sheriffs, enjoining them to send to parliament,
along with two knights of the shire, two deputies from
each borough within their county<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Writs were issued to about 120 cities and boroughs.</NOTE>, and these provided
with sufficient powers from their community, to consent,
in their name, to what he and his council should require
of them. <HI>As it is a most equitable rule,</HI> says he, in his

extremely wide of their low rank and condition<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Reliquiae Spellm. p. 64. Prynne's pref. to Cotton's Abridg. and the Abridg. passim.</NOTE>, that no

consisted of men, who were real burgesses of the place,
from which they were sent, the sheriff, when he found
<PB N="284" REF="309"/>
no person of abilities or wealth sufficient for this office,
often used the freedom of omitting particular boroughs
in his returns; and as he received the thanks of the
people for this indulgence, he gave no offence to the
court, who levied, without distinction, the tax agreed
to by the majority of deputies<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Brady of boroughs, p. 52, from the records. There is even an in∣stance in the reign of Edward III, when the King named all the depu∣ties.

It was not till the reign of Richard II. that the sheriffs were deprived of the power of omitting boroughs at plea∣sure. See Stat. at large, 5th Rich. II. cap. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE union, however, of the representatives from all
the boroughs gave gradually more weight to the whole
order; and it became customary for them, in return for
the supplies, which they granted, to prefer petitions to
the crown for the redress of any particular grievances, of
which they found reason to complain. The more the
King's demands multiplied, the faster these petitions en∣creased
both in number and authority; and the prince
found it difficult to refuse men, whose grants had sup∣ported
his throne, and to whose assistance he might so
soon be again obliged to have recourse. The commons
however were still much below the rank of legislators<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In the reign of Henry IV. the King told the commons, that they were only petitioners, that is, they had not any proper legislative autho∣rity. Cotton's abridg. p. 592. All judgment, says the Record, appertains to the King and the lords. The commons were so little accustomed to transact public business, that they had no speaker, till after the par∣liament 6th Edw. III. See Prynne's preface to Cotton's abridg. Not till the first of Richard II. in the opinion of most antiquarians. The com∣mons were very unwilling to meddle in any state affairs, and commonly either referred themselves to the lords, or desired a select committee of that house to assist them, as appears from Cotton. 5 E.

Their petitions, tho' they received a verbal assent from
the throne, were only the rudiments of laws: The judges
were afterwards entrusted with the power of putting
them into form: And the King, by adding to them the
sanction of his authority, and that sometimes without
the assent of the nobles, bestowed validity upon them.
The age did not refine so much as to perceive the danger
of these irregularities. No man was displeased, that the
sovereign, at the desire of any class of men, should issue
an order, which only concerned that class; and his pre∣decessors
were so near possessing the whole legislative
power, that he gave no disgust by assuming it in this
seemingly inoffensive manner. But time and farther expe∣rience
gradually opened mens eyes and corrected such
abuses. It was found, that no laws could be fixed for
one order of men without affecting the whole; and that
the force and efficacy of laws depended entirely on the
terms employed in wording them. The house of peers,
therefore, the most powerful order of the state, reason∣ably
expected, that their assent should be expressly granted
to all public ordinances<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In these instances found in Cotton's abridgment, where the King ap∣pears to answer of himself the petitions of the commons, he probably exerted no more than that power, which was long inherent in the crown, of regulating lesser matters by his edicts or proclamations. But no durable or general statute seems ever to have been made by the King from the petition of the commons alone, without the assent of the peers.</NOTE>: And in the reign of Henry V.
the commons required that no laws should be framed
merely upon their petitions, unless the statutes were
worded by themselves, and had passed their house in the
form of a bill<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Brady's answer to Petyt, p. 85, from the records.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT as the same causes, which produced a partition of
property, continued still to operate; the number of
knights and lesser barons, or what the English call the
<PB N="286" REF="311"/>
gentry, perpetually encreased, and sunk into a rank still
more interior to the great nobility. The equality of te∣nure
was lost in the great inferiority of power and pro∣perty;
and the house of representatives from the coun∣ties
was gradually separated from that of the peers, and
formed a distinct order in the state<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton's abridgement, p. 13.</NOTE>. The growth of com∣merce,
meanwhile, augmented the private wealth and
consideration of the burgesses; the frequent demands of the
crown encreased their public importance; and as they
resembled the knights of shires in one material circum∣stance,
that of representing particular bodies of men;
it no longer appeared unsuitable to unite them together
in the same house, and to confound their rights and pri∣vileges<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">It was very agreeable to the maxims of all the feudal governments, that every order of the state should give their consent to the acts which more immediately concerned them; and as the notion of a political sys∣tem was not then so well understood, the other orders of the state were often not consulted on these occasions. In this reign, even the mer∣chants, tho' no public body, granted the King impositions on merchan∣dize, because the first payments came out of their pockets. They did the same in the reign of Edward III. but the commons had then observed that the people paid these duties, tho' the merchants advanced them; and they therefore remonstrated against this practice. Cotton's abridg. p. 39. The taxes imposed by the knights on the counties were always lighter than those which the burgesses laid on the boroughs, a presump∣tion, that in voting these taxes the knights and burgesses did not form the same house. See chancellor West's enquiry into the manner of creating peers, p. 8. But there are so many proofs, that these two orders of representatives were long separate, that it is needless to insist on them. Mr. Carte, who had carefully consulted the rolls of parlia∣ment, affirms, that they never appear to have been united till the 16th of Edward III. See Hist. vol. ii. p. 451. But 'tis certain that this union was not even then final: In 1372, the burgesses acted by themselves, and voted a tax after the knights were dismissed. See Tyrrel, Hist. vol. iii. p. 734, from Rot. Claus. 46 Edw. III. n. 9. In 1376, they were the knights alone, who passed a vote for the removal of Alice Pierce from the King's person, if we may credit Walsingham, p. 189. There is an instance of a like kind in the reign of Richard II. Cotton, p. 193. The different taxes voted by these two branches of the lower house, kept them naturally separate: But as their petitions had mostly the same ob∣ject, viz. the redress of grievances, and the support of law and justice both against the crown and the barons, this cause as naturally united them, and was the reason why they at last joined in one house for the dispatch of business. The barons had few petitions: Their privileges were of more antient date: Grievances seldom affected them: They were them∣selves the chief oppressors. In 1333, the knights by them∣selves concurred with the bishops and barons in advising the King to stay his journey into Ireland. Here was a petition which regarded a matter of state, and was supposed to be above the capacity of the burgesses. The knights, therefore, acted a part in this petition. See Cotton, abridg. p. 13. Chief baron Gilbert think, that the reason why taxes began al∣ways with the commons or burgesses was, that they were limited by the instructions of their boroughs. See Hist. of the Exchequer, p. 37.</NOTE>.
Thus the third estate, that of the commons,
<PB N="287" REF="312"/>
reached at last its present form; and as the country gen∣tlemen
made thenceforwards no scruple of appearing as
deputies of the boroughs, the distinction between the
members was entirely lost, and the lower house acquired
thence a great accession of weight and importance in the
kingdom. Still, however, the office of this estate was
very different from that which it has since exercised with
so much advantage to the public. Instead of checking
and controuling the authority of the King, they were
naturally induced to adhere to him, as the great fountain
of law and justice, and to support him against the exor∣bitant
power of the aristocracy, which was at once the
source of oppression to themselves, and disturbed him in
the execution of the laws. The King, in his turn,
gave countenance to an order of men, so useful and so
little dangerous: The peers also were obliged to pay
them some consideration: And by this means, the third
estate, formerly so abject in England, as well as in all
other European nations, rose by flow degrees to their
present importance; and in their progress made arts and
<PB N="288" REF="313"/>
commerce, the necessary attendants of liberty and equa∣lity,
flourish in the kingdom<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">The chief argument from antient authority, for the opinion that the representatives of boroughs preceded the forty-ninth of Henry III. is the famous petition of the borough of St. Albans, first taken notice of by Selden, and then by Petyt, Brady, Tyrrel, and others. In this petition, presented to the parliament in the reign of Edward II. the town of St. Albans asserts, that tho' they held <HI>in capite</HI> of the crown, and owed only, for all other services, their attendance in parliament, yet the sheriff had omitted them in his writs; whereas both in the reign of the King's father, and all his predecessors, they had always sent members. Now, say the defenders of this opinion, if the commencement of the house of commons was in Henry III's reign, this expression could not have been used. Bat Madox, in his History of the Exche∣quer, p. 522, 523, 524, has endeavoured to destroy the authority of this petition for the purpose alleged. He asserts, first, that there was no such tenure in England as that of holding by attendance in parlia∣ment, instead of all other service. Secondly, That the borough of St. Albans never held of the crown at all, but was always demesne land of the abbot. It is no wonder, therefore, that a petition which advances two falshoods, should contain one historical mistake, which indeed amounts only to an inaccurate expression. Accordingly St. Albans con∣tinued still to belong to the abbot. It never held of the crown, till af∣ter the dissolution of the monasteries. But the assurance of these peti∣tioners is remarkable. They wanted to shake off the authority of their abbot, and to hold of the King; but were unwilling to pay any services even to the crown: Upon which they framed this petition, which latter writers have made the foundation of so many inferences and conclusions. From the tenor of the petition it appears, that there was a close connection between holding of the crown, and being represented in parliament: The latter had scarce ever place without the former: Yet we learn from Tyrrel's Append. vol. iv. that there were some instan∣ces to the contrary. It is not improbable, that Edward followed the roll of the earl of Mountfort, who had summoned, without distinction, all the considerable boroughs of the kingdom; among whom there might be some few who did not hold of the crown. Edward also found it necessary to impose taxes on all the boroughs of the kingdom without distinction. This was a good expedient for augmenting his re∣venue.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT sufficiently proves, that the commencement of
<PB N="289" REF="314"/>
the house of burgesses, who are the true commons, was
not an affair of chance, but arose from the necessities of
the present situation, is, that Edward, at the very same
time summoned deputies from the inferior clergy, the
first that ever met in England<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Archbp. Wake's State of the Church of England, p. 235. Brady of boroughs, p. 34. Gilbert's Hist. of the Exch. p. 46.</NOTE>, and he required them
to impose taxes on their constituents for the public service.
Formerly the ecclesiastical benefices bore no part of the
burthens of the state: The Pope had indeed of late often
levied impositions upon them: He had sometimes granted
this power to the sovereign<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ann. Waverl. p. 227, 228. T. Wykes, p. 99, 120.</NOTE>: Edward himself had in the
former year exacted by menaces and violence, a very
grievous tax of half the revenues of the clergy: But as
this precedent was dangerous, and could not easily be
repeated in a government, which required the consent
of the subject to any extraordinary resolution; Edward
found it more prudent to assemble a lower house of con∣vocation,
to lay before them his necessities, and to ask
some supply. But on this occasion he met with difficul∣ties.
Whether that the clergy thought themselves the
most independant body of men in the kingdom, or were
disgusted by the former exorbitant impositions, they ab∣solutely
refused their assent to the King's demand of a
fifth of their moveables; and it was not till a second
meeting, that on their persisting in this refusal, he was
willing to accept of a tenth. The barons and knights
granted him, without hesitation, an eleventh; the bur∣gesses,
a seventh. But the clergy still scrupled to meet
on the King's writ; lest by such obedience they should
seem to acknowledge the authority of the temporal
power: And this compromise was at last fallen upon,
that the King should issue his writ to the archbishop;
and that the archbishop should, in consequence of it,
<PB N="290" REF="315"/>
summon the clergy, who, as they then appeared to obey
their spiritual superior, no longer hesitated to meet in
convocation. This expedient, however, was the cause,
why the ecclesiastics met in two houses of convocation,
under their several archbishops, and formed not one estate,
like those in other countries of Europe, as was at first
the King's intention<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Gilbert's Hist. of Excheq. p. 51, 54.</NOTE>. We now return to the course of
our narration.</P>
<P>EDWARD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1296.</NOTE> conscious of the reasons of disgust which
he had given the King of Scots, informed of the dispo∣sitions
of that people, and expecting the most violent
effects of their resentment, which he knew he had so well
merited; employed the supplies, granted him by his peo∣ple,
in making preparations against the hostilities of his
northern neighbour. When in this situation, he received
intelligence of the treaty secretly concluded between
John and Philip; and tho' uneasy at this concurrence of
a French and Scots war, he resolved not to encourage
his enemies by a pusillanimous behaviour, or by yielding
to their united efforts. He summoned John to perform
the duty of a vassal, and to send him a supply of forces
against an invasion from France, with which he was
then threatened: He next required, that the fortresses of
Berwic, Jedborough, and Roxborough, should be put
into his hands as a security during the war<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 692. Walsing. p. 64. Heming. vol. i. p. 84. Trivet, p. 286.</NOTE>: He cited
John to appear in an English parliament, held at New∣castle:
And when none of these successive demands were
complied with, he marched northward with numerous
forces, 30,000 foot, and 4000 horse, to chastise his rebel∣lious
vassal. The Scottish nation, who had little reli∣lious
on the vigour and spirit of their prince, assigned
him a council of twelve noblemen, in whose hands the
<PB N="291" REF="316"/>
sovereignty was really lodged<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 75.</NOTE>, and who put the country
in the best posture, of which the present distractions
would admit. A great army, composed of 40,000 infan∣try,
tho' supported only by 500 cavalry, advanced to the
frontiers; and after a fruitless attempt upon Carlisle,
marched eastwards to defend those provinces, which Ed∣ward
was preparing to attack. But some of the most
considerable of the Scottish nobles, Robert Bruce, the
father and son, the earls of March and Angus, prognos∣ticating
the ruin of their country, from the concurrence
of intestine divisions and a foreign invasion, endeavoured
here to ingratiate themselves with Edward, by an early
submission; and the King, encouraged by this favour∣able
incident, led his army, into the enemies' country,
and crossed the Tweed without opposition at Coldstream.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th March</NOTE>
He then received a message from John, by which that
prince, having now procured, for himself and his nation,
Pope Celestine's dispensation from former oaths, renoun∣ced
the homage which had been done to England, and
set Edward at defiance<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 607. Walsing. p. 66. Heming. Vol. i. p. 92.</NOTE>. This bravade was but ill sup∣ported
by the military operations of the Scots. Berwic
was already taken by assault; Sir William Douglas, the
governor, was made prisoner: Above 7000 of the garri∣son
were put to the sword<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Walsing, p. 66. Heming. vol. i. p. 89. Trivet, p. 289.</NOTE>: And Edward, elated by

by the flower of the Scottish nobility.</P>

<PB N="292" REF="317"/>
of their number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th April.</NOTE> marched out to give them bat∣tle.
He attacked them with great vigour; and as undis∣ciplined
troops, the more numerous they are, are but the
more exposed to a panic upon any alarm, he soon threw
them into confusion, and cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed them off the field with
great slaughter<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Walsin. p. 67. Heming. vol. i. p. 96. Trivet, p. 291. Chron. Dunst. vol. ii. p. 650.</NOTE>. The loss of the Scots is said to have
amounted to 20,000 men: The castle of Dunbar, with
all its garrison, surrendered next day to Edward, who,
after the battle, had brought up the main body of the
English, and who now proceeded with an assured confi∣dence
of success. The castle of Roxborough was yielded
by James, steward of Scotland<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 97. Trivet, p. 292.</NOTE>; and that nobleman,
from whom is descended the royal family of Stuart, was
again obliged to swear fealty to Edward. After a feeble
resistance, the castles of Edinburgh and Stirling opened
their gates to the enemy. All the southern parts were
instantly subdued by the English; and to enable them
the better to reduce the northern, whose inaccessible situ∣ation
seemed to give them some more security, Edward
received a strong reinforcement of Welsh and Irish, who
being accustomed to a desultory kind of war, were the
best qualified to pursue the fugitive Scots into the recesses
of their lakes and mountains<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 98. Chron. Dunst. vol. ii. p. 650.</NOTE>. But the spirit of the na∣tion
was already broke by their misfortunes; and the
feeble and timid Baliol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotland subdued.</NOTE> discontented with his own sub∣jects,
and over-awed by the English, abandoned all
those resources, which his people might yet have posses∣sed
in this extremity. He hastened to make his submis∣sions
to Edward; he expressed the deepest penitence for his
disloyalty to his liege lord; and he made a solemn and
irrevocable resignation of his crown into the hands of
that monarch<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 718. Walsing. p. 67. Heming. vol. i. p. 99. Trivet, p. 292.</NOTE>. Edward marched northwards to Aber∣deen
<PB N="293" REF="318"/>
and Elgin, without meeting an enemy: No Scots∣man
approached him but to pay him submission and do
him homage<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 100, 101.</NOTE>: Even the turbulent highlanders, ever re∣fractory
to their own princes, and averse to the restraint
of laws, endeavoured to prevent the devastation of their
country, by giving him early proofs of obedience: And
Edward, having brought the whole kingdom to a seem∣ing
state of tranquillity, returned to the south with his
army. There was a stone, to which the popular super∣stition
of the Scots paid the highest veneration: All their
Kings were seated on it when they received the rite of
inauguration: An antient tradition assured them, that
wherever this stone was placed, their nation should al∣ways
govern: And it was carefully preserved at Scone,
as the true palladium of their monarchy, and their ulti∣mate
resource amidst all their misfortunes. Edward got
possession of it; and carried it with him to England<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 68. Trivet, p. 299.</NOTE>.
He gave orders to destroy all the records, and all those
monuments of antiquity, which might preserve the me∣mory
of the independance of the kingdom, and refute
the English claims of superiority. The Scots pretend,
that he also destroyed all the annals preserved in their
convents: But it is not probable, that a nation, so rude
and unpolished, would be possessed of any history, which
deserves much to be regreted. The great seal of Baliol
was broke; and that prince himself was carried a prison∣er
to London, and committed to custody in the Tower.
Two years afterwards he was restored to his liberty, and
submitted to a voluntary bahishment in France, where,
without making any farther attempts for the recovery of
his royalty, he died in a private station. Earl Warrenne
was left governor of Scotland<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 726. Trivet, p, 295.</NOTE>: Englishmen were en∣trusted
with all the chief offices: And Edward, flattering
<PB N="294" REF="319"/>
himself that he had attained the end of all his wishes,
and that the long train of fraud and violence which he
had practised against Scotland, had terminated in the
final reduction of that kingdom, returned with his victo∣rious
army into England.</P>
<P>AN attempt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> which he made about the same time, for
the recovery of Guienne, was not equally successful.
He sent thither an army of 7000 men, under the com∣mand
of his brother the earl of Lancaster; and that prince
gained at first some advantages over the French at Bour∣deaux:
But he was soon after seized with a distemper,
of which he died at Bayonne. The command devolved
on the earl of Lincoln, who was not able to perform any
thing considerable during the rest of the campaign<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 72, 73, 74.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the active and ambitious spirit of Edward, while
his conquests brought such considerable accessions to the
English monarchy, could never be satisfied, so long as
Guienne, the antient patrimony of his family, was wrest∣ed
from him by the dishonest artifices of the French mo∣narch.
Finding, that the distance of that province ren∣dered
all his efforts against it feeble and uncertain, he
proposed to attack France in a quarter where she appear∣ed
more vulnerable; and with this view, he married his
daughter Elizabeth to John earl of Holland, and at
the same time contracted an alliance with Guy earl
of Flanders, stipulated to pay him the sum of 75,000l.
and projected an invasion with their united forces upon
Philip, their common enemy<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 761. Walsing. p. 68.</NOTE>. He hoped, that, when
he himself, at the head of the English, Flemish, and
Dutch armies, re-inforced by his German allies, to whom
he had promised or remitted very considerable sums,
should enter the frontiers of France, and threaten the
capital itself with imminent danger, Philip would at last
<PB N="295" REF="320"/>
be obliged to relinquish his acquisitions, and purchase
peace by the restitution of Guienne. But in order to set
this great machine in movement, considerable supplies
were requisite from the parliament; and Edward, with∣out
much difficulty, obtained from the barons and
knights a new grant of a twelfth of all their moveables,
and from the boroughs, that of an eighth. The great
and almost unlimited power of the King over the latter,
enabled him to throw the heaviest part of the burthen on
them; and the prejudices, which he seems always to
have entertained against the church, on account of their
former zeal for the Mountfort faction, made him resolve
to load them with still more considerable impositions,
and he required of them a fifth of their moveables. But
he here met with an opposition, which for some time dis∣concerted
all his measures, and engaged him in enter∣prizes,
which were somewhat dangerous to <HI>him,</HI> and
would have proved ruinous to any of his predecessors.</P>
<P>BONIFACE VIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissentions with the clergy.</NOTE> who had succeeded Celestine in the
papal throne, was a man of the most lofty and enterpriz∣ing
spirit; and tho' he wanted that austerity of manners,
which commonly accompanies ambition in men of his
order, he was determined to carry the authority of the
tiara, and his dominion over the temporal power, to as
great a height as it had ever attained in any former pe∣riod.
Sensible that his immediate predecessors, by oppres∣sing
the church in every province of Christendom, had
extremely alienated the affections of the clergy, and had
afforded the civil magistrate a pretence for laying like
impositions on ecclesiastical revenues, he attempted to
resume the former station of the sovereign pontiff, and
to establish himself as the common protector of the spi∣ritual
order against all invaders. For this purpose, he
issued very early in his pontificate a general bull, prohi∣biting
all princes to levy without his consent any taxes
<PB N="296" REF="321"/>
from the clergy, and all clergymen to submit to such im∣positions;
and threatening both of them with the penal∣ties
of excommunication in case of disobedience<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 706. Heming. vol. i. p. 104.</NOTE>. This
important edict is said to have been procured by the soli∣citation
of Robert de Winchelsey, archbishop of Can∣terbury,
who intended to employ it as a rampart against
the violent extortions which the church had felt from
Edward, and the still greater, which that prince's multi∣plied
necessities gave them reason to apprehend. When
a demand, therefore, was made on the clergy of a fifth of
their moveables, a tax which was probably much more
grievous than a fifth of their revenue, as their lands were
mostly stocked with their cattle, and cultivated by their
villains; the clergy took shelter under the bull of Pope
Boniface, and pleaded conscience in refusing compli∣ance<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 107. Trivet, p. 296. Chron. Dunst. vol. ii. p. 652.</NOTE>.
The King came not immediately to extremities
on this repulse; but after locking up all their granaries
and barns, and prohibiting all rent to be paid them, he
appointed a new synod, to confer upon his demand. The
primate, not dismayed by these proofs of Edward's reso∣lution,
here plainly told him, that the clergy owed obe∣dience
to two sovereigns, their spiritual and their tempo∣ral;
but their duty bound them to a much stricter at∣tachment
to the former than to the latter: They could
not comply with his commands (for such, in some mea∣sure,
the requests of the crown were then deemed) in
contradiction to the express prohibition of the sovereign
pontiff<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. i. p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE clergy had seen from many proofs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1297.</NOTE> that Edward
paid very little regard to those numerous privileges, on
which they set so high a value. He had formerly seized,
in an arbitrary manner, all the money and plate lodged
<PB N="297" REF="322"/>
in the churches and convents, and had applied them to
the public service<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Walsin. p. 65. Heming. vol. i. p. 51.</NOTE>; and they could not but expect
more violent treatment on this sharp refusal, grounded
on such dangerous principles. Instead of applying to
the Pope for a relaxation of his bull, he resolved imme∣diately
to employ the power in his hands; and he told
the ecclesiastics, that, since they refused to support the
civil government, they were unworthy to receive any
benefit from it; and he would accordingly put them out
of the protection of the laws. This vigorous measure
was immediately carried into execution<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Walsin. p. 69. Heming. vol. i. p. 107.</NOTE>. Orders were
issued to the judges to receive no cause brought before,
them by the clergy; to hear and decide all causes in
which they were defendants: To do every man justice
against them; to do them justice against no body<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 429.</NOTE>.
The ecclesiastics immediately found themselves in the
most miserable situation imaginable. They could not
remain in their own houses or convents for want of sub∣sistance:
If they went abroad, in quest of maintenance,
they were dismouhted from, their horses, robbed of their
cloaths, abused by every ruffian, and no redress could be
obtained by them for the most violent injury. The pri∣mate
himself was attacked on the high way, was stripped
of all his equipage and furniture, and was at last reduced
to board himself with a single servant in the house of a
country clergyman<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 109.</NOTE>. The King, mean while, remained
an indifferent spectator of all these violences; and with∣out
employing his officers in committing any immediate
injury on the priests, which might have appeared invidi∣ous
and oppressive, he took ample vengeance on them
for their obstiriate refusal of his demands. Tho' the
archbishop issued a general sentence of excommunication
<PB N="298" REF="323"/>
against all who attacked the person or property of eccle∣siastics,
it was not regarded; while Edward enjoyed the
pleasure of seeing the people become the voluntary in∣struments
of his justice against them, and enure them∣selves
to throw off that respect for the sacred order, by
which they had been so long over-awed and governed.</P>
<P>THE spirits of the clergy were at last brake by this
harsh treatment. Besides that the whole province of
York, which lay nearest the danger that still hung over
them from the Scots, voluntarily from the first voted a
fifth of their moveables; the bishops of Salisbury, Ely,
and some others, made a composition for the secular
clergy within their fees; and they agreed, not to pay
the fifth, which would have been, an act of disobedience
to Boniface's bull, but to deposite a sum equivalent in
some church appointed them; where it was taken by the
King's officers<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i p. 108, 109. Chron. Dunst. p. 653.</NOTE>. Many particular convents and cler∣gymen
made payment of a like sum, and received the
King's protection<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Dunst. vol. ii. p. 654.</NOTE>. Those who had not ready money,
entered into recognizances for the payment. And there
was scarce found one ecclesiastic in the kingdom, who
seemed willing to suffer for the sake of religious privi∣leges,
this new species of martyrdom, the most tedious
and languishing of any, the most mortifying to spiritual
pride, and not rewarded by that crown of glory, which
the church holds up, with such ostentation, to her de∣voted
adherents.</P>
<P>BUT as the money,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arbitrary measures.</NOTE> granted by parliament, tho' consi∣derable,
was not sufficient to supply the King's necessi∣ties,
and that levied by compositions with the clergy
came in slowly, Edward was obliged, for the sake of far∣ther
supply, to exert his arbitrary power, and to lay an
oppressive hand on all orders of men in the kingdom.
<PB N="299" REF="324"/>
He limited the merchants in the quantity of wool allow∣ed
to be exported; and at the same time forced them to
pay him a duty of forty shillings a sack, which was com∣puted
to be much above the fifth of the value<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walsing, p. 69. Trivet, p. 296.</NOTE>. He
seized all the rest of the wool, as well as all the leather
of the kingdom, into his hands, and disposed of these
commodities for his own benefit<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 52, 110.</NOTE>: He required the
sheriffs of each county to supply him with 2000 quarters
of wheat, and as many of oats, which he permitted them
to seize wherever they could find them: The cattle and
other commodities necessary for supplying his army were
laid hold of without the consent of the owners<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 111.</NOTE>: And
tho' he promised afterwards to pay the equivalent of all
thefe goods, men saw but little probability that a prince,
who submitted so little to the limitations of law, could
ever, amidst his multiplied necessities, be reduced to a
strict observance of his engagements. He showed at the
same time an equal disregard to the principles of the
feudal law, by which all the lands of his kingdom were
held: In order to encrease his army, and enable him to
support that great effort, which he proposed to make
against France, he required the attendance of every pro∣prietor
of land, possessed of twenty pounds a year, even
tho' he held not of the crown, and was not obliged by
the tenure of his estate to perform any such service<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Walsing, p. 69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE acts of violence and of arbitrary power, not∣withstanding
the great personal regard generally borne
to the King, bred murmurs in every order of men; and
it was not long, before some of the great nobility, jea∣lous
of their own privileges, as well as of national liber∣ty,
gave countenance and authority to these complaints.
Edward assembled an army on the sea-coast, which he
<PB N="300" REF="325"/>
proposed to send over into Gascony, while he himself
should in person make an impression on the side of Flan∣ders,
and he intended to put these forces under the com∣mand
of Humphrey Bohun, earl of Hereford, the con∣stable,
and Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, the mareschal
of England. But these two powerful earls refused to ex∣ecute
his orders, and affirmed, that they were only
obliged by their office to attend his person in the wars.
A violent altercation ensued; and the King, in the
height of his passion, addressing himself to the constable,
exclaimed, <HI>Sir earl, by God, you shall either go or hang.
By God, Sir King,</HI> replied Hereford, <HI>I will neither go nor
hang</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 112.</NOTE>. And he immediately departed, with the mare∣schal,
and above thirty other considerable barons.</P>
<P>UPON this opposition, the King laid aside the project
of an expedition against Guienne; and assembled the
army, which he proposed to transport into Flanders.
But the two earls, irritated in the contest and elated by
impunity, pretending that none of their ancestors had
ever served in that country, refused to perform the duty
of their office in mustering the army<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 783. Walsin. p. 70.</NOTE>. The King, now
finding it adviseable to proceed with moderation, instead
of forfeiting the earls, who possessed their dignities by
hereditary right, appointed Thomas de Berkeley, and
Geoffrey de Geyneville, to act in that emergence, as
constable and mareschal<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 430.</NOTE>. He endeavoured to reconcile
himself with the church; took the primate again into fa∣vour<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 113.</NOTE>;
made him, in conjunction with Reginald de
Grey, tutor to the prince, whom he proposed to appoint
guardian of the kingdom during his absence; and he
even assembled a great number of the nobility in West∣minster-hall,
to whom he deigned to make an apology
<PB N="301" REF="326"/>
for his past conduct. He pleaded the urgent necessities
of the crown; his extreme want of money; his engage∣ment
from honour as well as interest to support his allies
abroad: And he promised, if ever he returned in safety,
to redress all their grievances, to restore the execution of
the laws, and to make all his subjects compensation for
the losses, which they had sustained. Meanwhile, he
begged them to suspend their animosities; to judge of
him by his future behaviour, of which, he hoped, he
would be more master; to remain faithful to his govern∣ment,
or if he perished in the present war, to preserve
their allegiance to his son and successor<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 114. M. West. p. 430.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE were certainly, from the concurrence of dis∣contents
among the great, and the grievances of the peo∣ple,
materials sufficient in any other period to have kin∣dled
a civil war in England: But the vigour and abilities
of Edward kept every one in awe; and his dexterity in
stopping on the brink of danger, and retracting the mea∣sures,
to which he was pushed by his violent temper and
arbitrary principles, saved the nation from so great a ca∣lamity.
The two great earls dared not to break but into
open violence; and they proceeded no farther than fram∣ing
a remonstrance, which was delivered to the King at
Winchelsea, when he was ready to embark for Flanders.
They there complained of the violations of the great
charter and that of forests; the violent seizure of corn,
leather, cattle, and above all, of wool, a commodity,
which they affirmed to be equal in value to half the lands
of the kingdom; the arbitrary imposition of forty shil∣lings
a sack on the small quantity of wool allowed to be
exported by the merchants; and they claimed an im∣mediate
redress of all these grievances<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 71. Heming vol. i. p. 115. Trivet, p. 302.</NOTE>. The King told
them, that the greatest part of his council were now ab∣sent,
<PB N="302" REF="327"/>
and without their advice he could not deliberate on
measures of so great consequence<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 72. Homing. vol. i. p. 117. Trivet, p. 304.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the constable and mareschal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diffensions with the barons.</NOTE> with the barons of
their party, resolved to take advantage of Edward's ab∣sence,
and to obtain an authentic assent to their de∣mands.
When summoned to attend the parliament at
London, they came with a great body of cavalry and in∣fantry;
and before they would enter the city, required
that the gates should be put into their custody<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 138.</NOTE>. The
primate, who secretly favoured all their pretensions, ad∣vised
the council to comply; and thus they became mas∣ters
both of the young prince and of the resolutions of
parliament. Their demands, however, were very mo∣derate;
and such as sufficiently justify the purity of their
intention in all their past measures: They only required,
that the two charters should receive a solemn confirma∣tion;
that a clause should be added to fecure the nation
for ever against all impositions and taxes without consent
of parliament; and that they themselves and their ad∣herents,
who had refused to attend the King into Flan∣ders,
should be pardoned for this offence, and should be
again received into favour<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 73. Heming. vol. i. p. 138, 139, 140, 141. Trivet, p. 308.</NOTE>. The prince of Wales and
his council assented to these terms; and the charters
were sent over to the King in Flanders to be there con∣firmed
by him. Edward felt the utmost reluctance to
this measure, which, he apprehended, would for the fu∣ture
impose fetters on his conduct, and set limits to his
lawless authority. On various pretences, he delayed
three days the giving any answer to the deputies; and
when the pernicious consequences of his refusal were re∣presented
to him, he was at last obliged, after many in∣ternal
<PB N="303" REF="328"/>
struggles, to affix his seal to tne charters, as also
to the clause that bereaved him of the power, which he
had hitherto assumed, of imposing arbitrary taxes upon
the people<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 74. Heming. vol. i. p. 143.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT we may finish at once this interesting transac∣tion
concerning the settlement of the charters, we shall
briefly mention the subsequent events which relate to it.
The constable and mareschal, informed of the King's
compliance, were satisfied; and not only ceased from dif∣turbing
the government, but assisted the regency with all
their power against the Scots, who had risen in arms,
and had thrown off the yoke of the English<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 143.</NOTE>. But being
sensible, that the smallest pretence would suffice to make
Edward retract these detested laws, which, tho' they had
often received the sanction both of King and parliament,
and had been acknowledged during three reigns, were
never yet deemed to have sufficient validity; they insist∣ed,
that he should again confirm them on his return to
England, and should thereby renounce all plea which he
might derive from his residing in a foreign country, when
he formerly affixed his seal to them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 159.</NOTE>. It appeared, that
they judged aright of Edward's character and intentions:
He delayed this confirmation as long as possible; and
when the fear of worse consequences obliged him again
to comply, he added expressly a salvo for his royal dignity
or prerogative, which in effect enervated the force of the
whole charter<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 167, 163.</NOTE>. The two earls and their adherents left
the parliament in discontent; and the King was con∣strained,
in a future session, to grant the people, without
any subterfuge, a pure and absolute confirmation of those
laws<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 168.</NOTE>, which were so much the object of their passionate
affection. Even farther securities were then provided for
<PB N="304" REF="329"/>
the establishment of national privileges. Three knights
were appointed to be chosen in each county, and were
invested with the power of punishing by fines and impri∣sonment,
every transgression or violation of the char∣ters<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hemingford, vol. i. p. 170.</NOTE>:
A precaution, which, tho' it was soon disused, as
encroaching too much on royal prerogative, proves the
attachment, which the English in that age bore to liber∣ty,
and their well-founded jealousy of the arbitrary dif∣position
of Edward.</P>
<P>THE work, however, was not yet entirely finished
and compleat. In order to execute the lesser charter, it
was requisite by new perambulations to set bounds to the
royal forests, and to disafforest all those lands which for∣mer
encroachments had comprehended within their li∣mits.
Edward discovered the same reluctance to comply
with this equitable demand; and it was not till after
many delays on his part, and many solicitations and re∣quests,
and even menaces of war and violence<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Walsing, p. 80. We are told by Tyrrel, vol. ii. p. 145. from the Chronicle of St. Albans, that the barons, not contented with the exe∣cution of the charter of forests, demanded of Edward as high terms as had been imposed on his father by the earl of Leicester: But no other historian mentions this particular.</NOTE>, on the
part of the barons, that the perambulations were made,
and exact bounderies fixt, by a jury in each county, to
the extent of his forests<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 171. M. West. p. 431, 433.</NOTE>. Had not his ambitious and
active temper raised him so many foreign enemies, and
obliged him to have recourse so often to the assistance of
his subjects, it is likely that these concessions could never
have been extorted from him.</P>
<P>BUT while the people, after fo many successful strug∣gles,
deemed themselves happy in the secure possession of
their privileges; they were surprized in 1305 to find,
that Edward had secretly applied to Rome, and had pro∣cured
<PB N="305" REF="330"/>
from that mercenary court, an absolution from all
the oaths and engagements, which he had so often reite∣rated
to observe both the charters. There are some his∣torians<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Brady, vol. ii. p. 84. Carte, vol. ii. p. 292.</NOTE>
so credulous as to imagine, that this perilous step was taken by him for no other purpose than to ac∣quire
the merit of granting a new confirmation of the
charters, as he did soon after; and a confirmation so
much the more unquestionable, that It coulc! never after
be invalidated by his successors from the pretence of any
force or violence which had been imposed on him. But
besides, that this might have been done with a much
better grace, if he had never applied for any such abso∣lution,
the whole tenor of his conduct proves him to be
little susceptible of such refinements in patriotism; and
this very deed itfelf, in which he confirmed anew the
charters, carries on the face of it a very opposite pre∣sumption.
Tho' he ratified the charters in general, he
still laid hold of the papal bull so far as to invalidate the
late perambulations of the forests, which had been made
with such care and attention, and to reserve to himself
the power, in case of favourable incidents, to extend as
much as formerly these arbitrary jurisdictions. If the
power was not in fact made use of, we can only con∣clude,
that the favourable incidents did not occur.</P>
<P>THUS, after the contests of near a whole century, and
those ever accompanied with violent jealousies, often
with public convulsions, the great charter was finally
established; and the English nation have the honour of
extorting, by their perseverance, this concession from
the ablest, the most warlike, and the most ambitious of
all their princes<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">It must however be remarked, that the King never forgave the chief actors in this transaction, and he found means afterwards to oblige both the constable and mareschal to resign their offices into his hands.

confirmations of it were at different times required of se∣veral
Kings, and granted by them, in full parliament; a
precaution, which, while it discovers some ignorance of
the true nature of law and government, proves a very
laudable jealousy of national privileges in the people, and
an extreme anxiety, left contrary precedents should ever
be pleaded as an authority for infringing them. Accord∣ingly
we find, that, tho' arbitrary practices often pre∣vailed,
and were even able to establish themselves into
settled customs, the validity of the great charter was ne∣ver
afterwards formally disputed; and that grant was
still regarded as the basis of the English government, and
the sure rule by which the authority of every custom
was to be tried and canvassed. The jurisdiction of the
Star-chamber, martial law, imprisonment by warrants
from the privy-council, and other practices of a like na∣ture,
tho' established for several centuries, were scarce
ever allowed by the English to be parts of their constitution:
The affection of the nation for liberty still pre∣vailed
over all precedent, and even all political reason∣ing:
The exercise of these powers, after being long the
source of secret murmurs among the people, was, in
fullness of time, solemnly abolished, as illegal, at least
as oppressive, by the whole legislative authority.</P>
<P>TO return to the period, from which this account of
the charters has led us: Tho' the King's impatience to
appear at the head of his armies in Flanders made him
overlook all considerations, either of domestic discontents
or of commotions among the Scots; he had been so
long retarded by the several obstructions thrown in his
way, that he lost the proper season for action, and after
his arrival made no progress against the enemy. The
King of France, taking advantage of his absence, had
<PB N="307" REF="334"/>
broke into the Low Countries; had defeated the Flem∣ings
in the battle of Furnes; had made himself master
of Lisle, St. Omer, Courtrai, and Ypres; and feemed
in a situation to take full vengeance on the earl of Flan∣ders,
his rebellious vassal. But Edward, seconded by an
English army of 50,000 men (for this is the number
assigned by historians<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. i. p. 146.</NOTE>) was soon able to stop the career
of his victories; and Philip, finding all the weak resour∣ces
of his kingdom to be already exhausted, began to
dread a reverse of fortune, and to apprehend an invasion
on France itself. The King of England, on the other
hand, disappointed of assistance from Adolph, King of
the Romans, which he had purchased at a very high
price, and finding many urgent calls for his presence in
England, was desirous of ending on any honourable
terms a war, which served only to divert his force from
the execution of more important projects. This dispo∣sition
of both monarchs soon produced a cessation of hos∣tilities
for two years; and engaged them to submit their
differences to the arbitration of Pope Boniface.</P>
<P>BONIFACE was the last of the sovereign pontiffs who
exercised an authority over the temporal jurisdiction of
princes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1298.</NOTE> and these exorbitant pretensions, which he had
been tempted to assume from the successful example of
his predecessors, but of which the season was now past,
involved him in so many calamities, and were attended
with so unfortunate a catastrophe, that they have been,
secretly abandoned, tho' never openly relinquifhed, by
his successors in the apostolic chair. Edward and Philip,
equally jealous of papal claims, took care to insert in
their reference, that Boniface was made judge of the dif∣ferences
by their consent, as a private person, not by
any right of his pontificate; and the Pope, without
<PB N="308" REF="335"/>
seeming to be offended at this mortifying clause, proceed∣ed
to give a sentence between them, in which they both
acquiesced<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 817. Heming. vol. i. p. 149. Trivet, p. 310.</NOTE>. He brought them to agree, that their uni∣on
should be cemented by a double marriage; that of
Edward himself, who was now a widower, with Marga∣ret,
Philip's sister, and that of the prince of Wales with
Isabella, the daughter of that monarch<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 823.</NOTE>. Philip was
likewife willing to restore Guienne to the English, which
he had indeed no pretensions to detain; but he insisted,
that the Scots and their King, John Baliol, should, as
his allies, be also comprehended in the treaty, and should
be restored to their liberty. The difference was, after
several disputes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France.</NOTE> compromised by making mutual facri∣fices
to each other. Edward agreed to abandon his ally
the earl of Flanders, on condition that Philip should
treat in like manner his ally the King of Scots. The
prospect of conquering these two countries, whose situ∣ation
made them so commodious an acquisition to the
different kingdoms, prevailed over all other considera∣tions;
and tho' they were both finally disappointed in their hopes, their
conduct was very reconcilable to the princi∣ples
of an interested policy. This was the first specimen
which the Scots had of the French alliance, and which
was exactly conformable to what a smaller power must
always expect, when it blindly attaches itself to the will
and fortunes of a greater. That unhappy people, now
engaged in a brave, tho' unequal contest for their liber∣ties,
were totally abandoned by the ally, in whom they
reposed their final confidences to the will of ah imperious
conqueror.</P>
<P>THO' England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Scotland.</NOTE> as well as other European countries,
was, in its antient state, very ill qualified for making,
and still worse for maintaining conquests, Scotland was
<PB N="309" REF="336"/>
so much inferior in its internal force, and was so ill situ∣ated
for receiving foreign succours, that it is no wonder
an ambitious monarch should have cast his eye on so
tempting an acquisition, which brought both security
and greatness to his native kingdom. But the instru∣ments
whom Edward employed to maintain his dominion
over the northern kingdom, were not happily chosen;
and acted not with the requisite prudence and moderation,
in reconciling the Scottish nation to a yoke, which
they bore with such extreme reluctance. Warrenne
retiring into England, on account of his bad slate of
health, left the administration entirely in the hands of
Ormesby, who was appointed justiciary of Scotland, and
Cressingham, who bore the office of treasurer; and a
very small military force remained to secure the precari∣ous
authority of these ministers. The latter had no
other object but the amassing money by rapine and in∣justice:
The former distinguished himself by the rigor
and severity of his temper: And both of them, treating
the Scots as a conquered people, made them sensible,
too early, of the grievous servitude into which they had
fallen. As Edward required, that all the proprietors of
land should swear fealty to him; everyone, who resused
or delayed the giving this testimony of submission, was
outlawed, and confined, and punished without mercy;
and the bravest and most generous spirits of the nation
were thus exasperated to the highest degree against the
English government<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 70. Heming. vol. 5. p. 118. Trivet, p. 299.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was one William Wallace, of a small fortune,
but descended of an antient family, in the west of Scot∣land,
whose courage prompted him to undertake, and
enabled him finally to execute, the desperate attempt of
delivering his native country from the dominion of fo∣reigners.
This man, whose valorous exploits are the
<PB N="310" REF="337"/>
object of just admiration, but have been much exagge∣rated
by the traditions of his countrymen, had been pro∣voked
by the insolence of an English officer to put him
to death; and finding himself obnoxious on that account
to the severity of the administration, he fled into the
woods, and offered himself as a leader to all those whom
their crimes or bad fortune, or avowed hatred of the
English, had reduced to a like necessity. He was endow∣ed
with a gigantic, force of body, with heroic courage of
mind, with disinterested magnanimity, with an incredi∣ble
patience and ability to bear hunger, fatigue, and all
the severities of the seasons; and he soon acquired among
those desperate fugitives that authority to which his vir∣tues
so justly intitled him. Beginning with small at∣tempts,
in which he was always successful, he gradually
proceeded to more momentous enterprizes; and he dis∣covered
equal caution in securing his followers, and va∣lour
in annoying the enemy. By his knowledge of the
country, he was enabled, when pursued, to ensure a re∣treat
among the morasses or forests or mountains; and
again, collecting his dispersed associates, he appeared un∣expectedly
in another quarter, and surprized and routed
and put to the sword the unwary English. Every day
brought accounts of his great actions, which were re∣ceived
with no less favour by his countrymen than terror
by the enemy: All those, who thirsted after military
fame, were desirous to partake of his renown: His suc∣cessful
valour seemed to vindicate the nation from the ig∣nominy
into which it had fallen, by its tame submission
to the English: And tho' no nobleman of note ventured
as yet to join his party, he had gained a general confi∣dence
and attachment, which birth and fortune are not
alone able to confer.</P>
<P>WALLACE, having by many fortunate enterprizes,
brought the valour of his followers to correspond to his
<PB N="311" REF="338"/>
own, resolved to strike a decisive blow against the English
government; and he concerted the plan of attacking
Ormesby at Scone, and of taking vengeance on him, for
all the violence and tyranny of which he had been guilty.
The justiciary, apprized of his intention, fled hastily into
England: All the other officers of that nation imitated
his example: Their terror added alacrity and courage to
the Scots, who betook themselves to arms in every quar∣ter:
Many of the principal barons, and among the rest
sir William Douglas<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Walsin. p. 70. Heming. vol. i. p. 118.</NOTE>, openly countenanced Wallace's
party: Robert Bruce secretly favoured and promoted the
same cause: And the Scots, shaking off their fetters,
prepared themselves to defend, by an united effort, that
liberty which they had to unexpectedly recovered from
the hands of their oppressors.</P>
<P>BUT Warrenne, collecting an army of 40,000 men
in the north of England, prepared to re-establish his au∣thority;
and he endeavoured by the celerity of his arma∣ment,
and of his march, to compensate for his past neg∣ligence,
which had enabled the Scots to shake off the
English government. He suddenly entered Annandale,
and came up with the enemy at Irvine, before their
forces were fully collected, and before they had put
themselves in a proper posture of defence. Many of the
Scots nobles, alarmed with their dangerous situation,
here submitted to the English, renewed their oaths of
fealty, promised to deliver hostages for their good be∣haviour,
and received a pardon for all past offences<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 121, 122.</NOTE>.
Others who had not yet declared themselves, such as the
steward of Scotland and the earl of Lennox, joined, tho'
with reluctance, the English army; and waited a fa∣vourable
opportunity of embracing the cause of their dis∣tressed
countrymen. But Wallace, whose authority
<PB N="312" REF="339"/>
over his retainers was more fully confirmed by the ab∣sence
of the great nobles, persevered obstinately in his
purpose; and finding himself unable to give battle to the
enemy, he marched northwards, with an intention of
prolonging the war, and of turning to his advantage the
situation of that mountainous and barren country.
When Warrenne advanced to Stirling, he found Wallace
encamped at Cambuskenneth, on the opposite banks of
the Forth; and being continually urged by the impatient
Cressingham, who was actuated both by personal and
national animosities against the Scots<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heming, vol. i. p. 127.</NOTE>, he prepared to at∣tack
them in that position, which Wallace, no less pru∣dent
than courageous, had chosen for his army<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">On the 11th of September 1297.</NOTE>. In
spite of the remonstrances of Sir Richard Lundy, a Scots∣man
of birth and family, who sincerely adhered to the
English, he ordered his army to pass a bridge which lay
over the Forth; but he was soon convinced, by fatal
experience, of the error of his conduct. Wallace, al∣lowing
such numbers of the English to pass as he thought
proper, attacked them before they were fully formed,
put them to rout, pushed part of them into the river,
where they were drowned, destroyed the rest by the edge
of the sword, and obtained a complete victory over
them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 73. Heming. vol. i. p. 127, 128, 129. Trivet, p. 307.</NOTE>. Among the slain was Cressingham himself,
whose memory was so extremely odious to the Scots,
that they flea'd his dead body, and made saddles and
girths of his skin<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ming. vol. i. p. 130.</NOTE>. Warrenne, finding the remainder
of his army much dismayed by this misfortune, was
obliged again to evacuate the kingdom, and retire into
England. The castles of Roxborough and Berwick, ill
fortified and feebly defended, fell soon after into the
hands of the Scots.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="340"/>
WALLACE, universally revered as the deliverer of his
country, now received from the hands of his followers,
the dignity of regent or guardian under the captive
Baliol; and finding that the disorders of war, as
well as the unfavourable seasons, had produced a fa∣mine
in Scotland, he urged his army to march into Eng∣land,
to subsist at the expence of the enemy, and to re∣venge
all past injuries, by committing retaliations on that
hostile nation. The Scots, who deemed every thing
possible under, such a leader, joyfully attended his call;
and Wallace, breaking into the northern counties dur∣ing
the winter season, laid every place waste with fire
and sword; and after extending on all sides, without
opposition, the fury of his ravages, as far as the bishiopric
of Durham, he returned loaded with spoils, and crown∣ed
with glory, into his own country<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 131, 131, 133.</NOTE>. The disorders,
which at that time prevailed in England, from the re∣fractory
behaviour of the constable and mareschal, made
it impossible to collet an army sufficient to resist the ene∣my,
and exposed the nation to this loss and dishonour.</P>
<P>BUT Edward, who received in Flanders intelligence
of these events, and had already concluded a truce with
France, now hastened over into England, in certain
hopes, by his activity and valour, not only of wiping off
this disgrace, but of recovering that important conquest
of Scotland, which he always regarded as the chief glory
and advantage of his reign. He appeased the murmurs
of his people by concessions and promises: He restored
to the citizens of London the election of their own ma∣gistrates,
of which they had been bereaved in the latter
part of his father's reign: He ordered strict enquiry to
be made concerning the quantities of corn and other
goods, which had been violently seized before his de∣parture,
<PB N="314" REF="341"/>
parture, as if he intended to pay the value to the own∣ers<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 813.</NOTE>:
And making public prosessions of confirming and
observing the charters, he regained the confidence of the
discontented nobles. Having by all these popular arts
rendered himself entirely master of his people, he collect∣ed
the whole military force of England, Wales, and Ire∣land;
and marched with an army of near an hundred
thousand combatants to the northern frontiers.</P>
<P>NOTHING could have enabled the Scots to resist, but
for one season, so mighty a power, except an entire uni∣on
among themselves; but as they were deprived of their
King, whose personal qualities, even when he was pre∣fent,
appeared so contemptible, and had left among his
subjects no principle of attachment to him or his family;
factions, jealousies, and animosities, unavoidably arose
among the great, and distracied all their councils. The
elevation of Wallace, tho' purchased by so great merit,
and such eminent services, was the object of envy to the
nobility, who repined to see a private gentleman raised
above them by his rank, and still more, by his glory and
reputation. Wallace himself, sensible of their jealousy,
and dreading the ruin of his country from those intestine
discords, voluntarily resigned his authority, and retained
only the command over that body of his followers, who,
being accustomed to victory under his standard, refused
to follow into the field any other leader. The chief
power devolved on the steward of Scotland, and Cummin
of Badenoch; men of eminent birth, under whom the
great chiestans were more willing to serve in defence of
their country. The two Scottish commanders, collect∣ing
their several forces from every quarter, fixed their
station at Falkirk, and proposed there to abide the affault
of the English. Wallace was at the head of a third bo∣dy,
which acted under his command. The Scots army
<PB N="315" REF="342"/>
placed the pikemen along their front: Interlined the in∣tervals
between the three bodies with archers: And
dreading the great superiority of the English in cavalry,
endeavoured to secure their front by palisadoes, tied to∣gether
with ropes<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 75. Heming. vel. i. p. 163.</NOTE>. In this disposition, they expected
the approach of the enemy.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d July▪ Battle of Falkirk.</NOTE> when he arrived in sight of the Scots,
was pleased with the prospect of being able, by one deci∣sive
stroke, to determine the fortune of the war; and
dividing his army also into three bodies, he led them to
the attack. The English archers, who began about
this time to surpass those of other nations, first chaced
the Scottish bowmen off the field; and then pouring
in their arrows among the pikemen, who were cooped
up within their intrenchments, began to throw them into
disorder, and rendered the assault of the English pikemen
and cavalry more easy and successful. The whole Scot∣tish
army was broke, and chaced off the field with great
slaughter; which the historians, attending more to the
exaggerated relations of the populace, than to the pro∣bability
of things, make amount to fifty or sixty thou∣sand
men<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 76. T. Wykes, p. 127. Heming. vol. i. p. 163, 164, 165. Trivet, p. 313, says only 20,000. M. West. p. 431, says 40,000.</NOTE>. It is only certain, that the Scots never
suffered a greater loss in any action, nor one which seemed
to threaten more inevitable ruin to their country.</P>
<P>IN this general rout of the army, Wallace's military
skill and presence of mind enabled him to keep his troops
together; and retiring behind the Carron, which lay in
his rear, he marched leisurely along the banks of that
small river, which protected him from the enemy.
Young Bruce, who had already given many proofs of his
aspiring genius, but who served hitherto in the English
<PB N="316" REF="343"/>
army, appeared on the opposite banks; and distinguish∣ing
the Scottish chieftain, as well by his majestic port,
as by the intrepid activity of his behaviour, called out
to him, and desired a short conference. He here repre∣sented
to Wallace the fruitless and ruinous enterprize in
which he was engaged; and endeavoured to persuade
him to bend at last his inflexible spirit to submission under
superior power and superior fortune: He insisted on the
unequal contest between a weak state, deprived of its
head and agitated by intestine discord, and a mighty na∣tion,
conducted by the ablest and most martial monarch
of the age, and possessed of every resource either for
drawing out the war, or for pushing it with vigour and
activity: If the love of his country was his motive for
perseverance, his obstinacy tended only to prolong her
misery; if he carried his views to private grandeur and
ambition, he might reflect, that, even if Edward should
withdraw his armies, it appeared from past experience,
that so many haughty nobles, proud of the pre-eminence
of their families, would never submit to personal merit,
whose superiority they were less inclined to regard as an
object of admiration, than as a reproach and injury to
themselves. To these exhortations Wallace replied,
that if he had hitherto acted alone, as the champion of
his native country, it was solely because no second or
competitor, or what he rather wished, no leader had as
yet appeared to place himself in that honourable station:
That the blame lay entirely on the nobility, and chiefly
on Bruce himself, who uniting personal merit to dignity
of family, had deserted the post, which both nature and
fortune, by such powerful calls, invited him to assume:
That the Scots, possessed of such a head, would, by their
unanimity and concord, have surmounted the chief dif∣ficulty
under which they now laboured, and might hope,
notwithstanding their present losses, to oppose success∣fully
<PB N="317" REF="344"/>
all the abilities and power of Edward: That Hea∣ven
itself could not set a more glorious prize before the
eyes either of virtue or ambition, than to conjoin in one
object, the acquisition of royalty with the defence of na∣tional
independence: And that as the interests of his
country, no more than those of a brave man, could ne∣ver
be sincerely cultivated by a sacrifice of liberty, he
himself was determined, as far as possible, to prolong,
not her misery, but her freedom, and was desirous, that
his own life, as well as the existence of the nation, might
terminate, when they could no longer be preserved but
by receiving the chains of a haughty victor. The gal∣lantry
of these sentiments, tho' delivered by an armed
enemy, struck the generous mind of Bruce: The flame
was conveyed from the breast of one hero to that of an∣other:
He repented of his engagements with Edward;
and opening his eyes to the honourable path, pointed out
to him by Wallace, secretly determined to seize the first
opportunity of embracing the cause, however desperate,
of his oppressed country<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">This story is told by all the Scots writers; tho' it must be owned that Trivet and Hemingford, authors of good credit, both agree that Bruce was not in Edward's army.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE subjection of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1299.</NOTE> notwithstanding this
great victory of Edward, was not yet entirely completed.
The English army, after reducing all the southern pro∣vinces,
was obliged to retire for want of provisions; and
left the northern counties in the hands of the natives.
The Scots, no less enraged with their present defeat,
than elevated by their past victories, still maintained the
contest for liberty; but being fully sensible of the great
inferiority of their forces, they endeavoured, by applica∣tion
to foreign courts, to procure to themselves some
assistance. The supplications of the Scottish ministers
were rejected by Philip; but were more successful with
<PB N="318" REF="345"/>
the court of Rome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1300.</NOTE> Boniface, pleased with an occasion
of exerting his authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotland a∣gain subdu∣ed.</NOTE> wrote a letter to Edward, ex∣horting
him to put a stop to the oppressions of Scotland
and displaying all the proofs, such as they had probably
been furnished him by the Scots themselves, for the anti∣ent
independance of that kingdom<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 844. Walsing. p. 78, 80. Hemling. vol. i. p. 172. Trivet, p. 318. M. West. p. 435.</NOTE>. Among other
arguments, hinted at above, he mentioned the treaty
conducted and finished by Edward himself, for the mar∣riage
of his son with the heiress of Scotland; a treaty
which would have been absurd, had he been superior
lord of the kingdom, and had possessed by the feudal law
the right of disposing of his ward in marriage. He men∣tioned
several other striking facts, which fell within the
compass of Edward's own knowledge; particularly,
that Alexander, when he did homage to the king, open∣ly
and expressly declared in his presence, that he swore
fealty not for his crown, but for the lands which he held
in England: And the Pope's letter might have paffed for
a very reasonable one, had he not subjoined his own
claim to be liege lord of Scotland; a right, which had
never once been heard of, but which, with a singular
confidence, he asserted to be full, entire, and derived
from the most remote antiquity. The affirmative style,
which had been so successful with him and his predeces∣sors
in spiritual contests, was never before abused after
so egregious a manner in any civil controversy.</P>
<P>THE reply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1301.</NOTE> which Edward wrote to Boniface's let∣ter,
contains particulars, no less singular and remark∣able<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 863. Walsing, p. 81. Heming. vol. i. p. 117. Trivet, p. 320. M. West. p. 439. Ryley, p. 596.</NOTE>.
He there proves the superiority of England by his∣torical
facts, deduced from Brutus, the Trojan, who,
he said, first founded the British monarchy in the age of
<PB N="319" REF="346"/>
Eli and Samuel: He supports his position by all the
events which passed in the island before the arrival of the
Romans: And after laying great stress on the extensive
dominion and heroic victories of King Arthur, he vouch∣safes
at last to descend to the times of Edward the elder,
with which, in his speech to the states of Scotland,
he had chosen to begin his claim of superiority. He asserts
it to be a fact, <HI>notorious and confirmed by the records of an∣tiquity,</HI>
that the English monarchs had often conferred
the kingdom of Scotland on their own subjects; had de∣throned
these vassal kings when unfaithful to them; and
had substituted others in their place. He displays with
great pomp the full and complete homage which William
had done to Henry II; without mentioning the formal
abolition of that <HI>extorted</HI> deed by King Richard, and the
renounciation of all future claims of the same nature.
Yet this paper he begins with a solemn appeal to the
Almighty, the searcher of hearts, for his own firm per∣suasion
of the justice of his claim; and no less than an
hundred and four barons assembled in parliament at Lin∣coln,
concur, in maintaining before the Pope, under
their seals, the validity of these pretensions<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 873. Walsing. p. 85. Heming. vol. i. p. 186. Trivet, p. 330. M. West. p. 443.</NOTE>. At the
same time, however, they take care to inform Boniface,
that, tho' they had justified their cause before him, they
did not receive him for their judge: The crown of Eng∣land
was free and sovereign: They had sworn to main∣tain
all its royal prerogatives, and would never permit
the king himself, were he willing, to relinquish its inde∣pendancy.</P>
<P>THAT neglect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1302.</NOTE> almost total, of truth and justice,
which sovereign states discover in their transactions with
each other, is an evil inveterate in the world; is one
great source of the misery to which the human species is
<PB N="320" REF="347"/>
continually exposed; and it may be doubted, whether in
many instances it is found in the end to contribute to the
interests of those princes themselves, who thus sacrifice
their integrity to their politics. As few monarchs have
lain under stronger temptations to violate the principles
of equity, than Edward in his tranfactions with Scot∣land;
so never were they violated with less scruple and
reserve: Yet his advantages were hitherto precarious and
uncertain; and the Scots, once roused to arms and en∣ured
to war, began to appear a formidable enemy, even
to this military and ambitious prince. They chose John

their independance in the northern parts, they
made incursions into the southern counties, which Ed∣ward
imagined he had totally subdued. John de Se∣grave,
whom he had left guardian of Scotland, led an
army to oppose them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1303.</NOTE> and lying at Roslin near Edin∣burgh,
sent out his forces in three divisions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Feb.</NOTE> to provide
themselves in forage and subsistance from the neighbour∣hood.
One party was suddenly attacked by the regent
and Sir Simon Fraser; and being unprepared, were im∣mediately
routed and pursued with great slaughter. The
few that escaped, flying to the second division, gave
warning of the approach of the enemy: The soldiers
ran to their colours: And were immediately led out to
take revenge for the death of their countrymen. The
Scots, elated with the advantage already obtained, ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
a vigorous impression upon them: The English, ani∣mated
with vengeance, maintained a stout resistance:
The victory was long undecided between them; but at
last declared itself intirely in favour of the former, who
broke the English, and chaced them to trie third division,
now advancing with a hasty march to support their dis∣tressed
companions. Many of the Scots had fallen in
the two first actions; most of them were wounded; and
<PB N="321" REF="348"/>
all of them extremely fatigued by the long continuance of the combat:
Yet were they so transported with suc∣cess
and military rage, that, having suddenly recovered
their order, and arming the followers of their camp with
the spoils of the slaughtered enemy, they drove with
fury upon the ranks of the dismayed English. The
favourable moment decided the battle; which the Scots,
had they met with a steady resistance, were not long
able to maintain: The English were chaced off the
field: Three victories were thus gained in one day<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 197.</NOTE>:
And the renown of these great exploits, seconded by the
favourable dispositions of the people, soon made the re∣gent
master of all the fortresses in the south; and it be∣came
necessary for Edward to begin anew the conquest
of the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE King prepared himself for this enterprize with
his usual vigour and ability. He assembled both a great
fleet and a great army; and entering the frontiers of
Scotland, appeared with a force, which the enemy could
not think of resisting in the open field: The English
navy which sailed along the coast, secured the army from
any danger of famine: Edward's vigilance preserved
them from surprizes: And by this prudent disposition they
marched victoriously from one extremity of the kingdom
to the other, ravaging the open country, taking in all
the castles<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 205.</NOTE>, and receiving the submissions of all the no∣bility,
even those of Cummin the regent. The most
obstinate resistance was made by the castle of Brechin,
defended by Sir Thomas Maule; and the place opened
not its gates, till the death of the governor, by discou∣raging
the garrison, obliged them to submit to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate,
which had overwhelmed the rest of the kingdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is again subdued.</NOTE> Wal∣lace,
tho' he attended the English army in their march,
<PB N="322" REF="349"/>
found but few opportunities of signalizing that valour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1304.</NOTE>
which had formerly made him so terrible to his enemies.</P>
<P>EDWARD, having compleated his conquest which
employed him during the space of near two years, now
undertook the more difficult work, of settling the coun∣try,
of establishing a new form of government, and of
making his acquisition durable to the crown of England.
He seems to have carried matters to extremity against
the natives: He abrogated all the Scottish laws and
customs<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ryley, p. 506.</NOTE>: He endeavoured to substitute the English in
their place: He entirely razed or destroyed all the monu∣ments
of antiquity: Such records or histories as had
escaped his former search were now burnt or dispersed:
And he hastened, by too precipitate steps, to abolish en∣tirely
the Scottish name, and to sink it finally in the English.</P>
<P>EDWARD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1305.</NOTE> however, still deemed his favourite con∣quest
exposed to some danger, so long as Wallace was
alive; and being prompted both by revenge and policy,
he employed every art to discover his retreat, and become;
master of his person. At last, that hardy warrior, who
was determined, amidst the universal slavery of his
country-men, still to maintain his independance, was
betrayed into Edward's hands by Sir John Monteith, his
friend, whom he had made acquainted with the place
of his concealment. The King, whose natural bravery
should have induced him to respect like qualities in an
enemy, enraged at some violences committed by Wallace
during the fury of war<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 84. Heming. vol. i. p. 120.</NOTE>, resolved to overawe the Scots
by an example of severity; and he Ordered Wallace to
be carried up in chains to London;<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 August.</NOTE> to be tried as a re∣bel
and traitor, tho' he never had made submission, nor
<PB N="323" REF="350"/>
sworn fealty to England; and to be executed on Tower∣hill<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 90. Trivet, p. 340. Murinmuth, p. 36.</NOTE>.
This was the unworthy fate of a hero, who,
thro' a course of many years, had, with signal conduct,
intrepidity and perseverance, defended against a public
and oppressive enemy, the liberties of his native country.</P>
<P>BUT the barbarous policy of Edward failed of the pur∣pose,
to which it was directed. The Scots, already dis∣gusted
with the great innovations introduced by the
sword of a conqueror into their laws and government,
were farther enraged at the injustice and cruelty exercised
upon Wallace; and all the envy, which, during his life∣time,
had attended that gallant chiestain, being now
buried in his grave, he was universally regarded as the
champion of Scotland, and the patron of her expiring
independance. The people, inflamed with resentment;
were every where disposed to rise against the English go∣vernment;
and it was not long before a new and more
fortunate leader presented himself, who conducted them
to liberty, to victory, and to vengeance.</P>
<P>ROBERT BRUCE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1306.</NOTE> the fan<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hemingford, vol. i. p. 218. calls him the grandson of Robert; and is very particular in the account of the times in which his father and grandfather died. Hemingford is the best historian of that age.</NOTE> of that Robert, who had
been one of the competitors for the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robert Bruce.</NOTE> had succeed∣ed,
by his father's death, to all his pretensions; and the
death of John Baliol, which happened nearly about the
same time in France, together with the captivity of
Edward, the eldest son of that prince, seemed to open a
full career to the genius and ambition of this young
nobleman. He saw, that the Scots, when the right to their
crown had expired in the males of their antient royal
family, had been divided into parties nearly equal be∣tween
the houses of Bruce and Baliol; and that every
<PB N="324" REF="351"/>
incident, which had since happened, had tended to wean
them from any attachment to the latter. The slender
capacity of John had proved unable to defend them a∣gainst
their enemies: He had meanly resigned his crown
into the hands of the conqueror: He had, before his
delivery from captivity, re-iterated that resignation in a
manner seemingly voluntary; and had in that act thrown
out many reflections extremely dishonourable to his anti∣ent
subjects, whom he publickly called traitors, ruffians,
and rebels, and with whom, he declared, he was deter∣mined
to maintain no farther connexions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Brady's hist. vol. ii. App. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 27.</NOTE>: He had,
during the time of his exile, adhered strictly to that re∣solution;
and his son, being a prisoner, seemed ill qua∣lified
to revive the rights, now fully abandoned, of his
family. Bruce therefore hoped, that the Scots, so long
exposed, from the want of a leader, to the oppressions
of their enemies, would unanimously fly to his standard,
and would seat him on the vacant throne, to which he
brought such plausible pretensions. His aspiring spirit,
inflamed by the fervor of youth, and buoyed up by his
natural courage, saw the glory alone of the enterprize,
or regarded the prodigious difficulties, which attended it,
as the source only of farther glory. The miseries and
oppressions, which he had beheld his countrymen suffer
in their unequal contest; the repeated defeats and mis∣fortunes,
which they had undergone, proved to him so
many incentives to bring them relief, and conduct them
to revenge against the haughty victors. The circumstan∣ces,
which attended Bruce's first declaration, are variously
related; but we shall rather follow the account given by
the Scots historians; not that their authority is in general
any wise to be compared to that of the English; but be∣cause
they may be supposed to be sometimes better in∣formed
<PB N="325" REF="352"/>
concerning facts, which so nearly interested their
own nation.</P>
<P>BRUCE, who had long harboured in his breast the de∣sign
of freeing his enslaved country, ventured at last to
open his mind to John Cummin, a powerful nobleman,
with whom he lived in strict intimacy. He found in his
friend all the appearance of his own sentiments; and
needed to employ no arts of persuasion to make him em∣brace
the resolution of throwing off, on the first favour∣able
opportunity, the usurped dominion of the English.
But on the departure of Bruce, who attended Edward
to London, Cummin, who either had dissembled all along
with him, or began to reflect more coolly in his absence
on the desperate nature of the undertaking, resolved to
attone for his crime of assenting to this rebellion, by the
merit of revealing the secret to the King of England.
Edward did not immediately commit Bruce to custody;
because he proposed, at the same time, to seize his three
brothers, who resided in Scotland; and he contented
himself with secretly setting spies upon him, and order∣ing
all his motions to be strictly guarded. A nobleman
of Edward's court, Bruce's intimate friend, was appriz∣ed
of his danger; but not daring, amidst so many watch∣ful
eyes, to hold any conversation with him, he fell on an
expedient to give him warning, that it was full time
he sould make his escape. He sent him by a servant,
a pair of gilt spurs and a purse of gold, which he
pretended to have borrowed from him; and left it to
the sagacity of his friend to discover the meaning of the
present. Bruce immediately contrived the means of his
escape; and as the ground was at that time covered with
snow, he had the precaution, it is said, to order his horses
to be shod with their shoes turned backwards, that he
might deceive those, who sould track his path over the
<PB N="326" REF="353"/>
open fields or cross roads, thro' which he purposed to
travel. He arrived in a few days at Dumfries in Annan∣dale;
the chief seat of his family interest; and he hap∣pily
found a great number of the Scottish nobility there
assembled, and among the rest, John Cummin, his for∣mer
associate.</P>
<P>THE noblemen were astonished at the appearance of
Bruce in their company;<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Feb.</NOTE> and still more when he dis∣covered
to them the object of his journey. He told
them, that he was come to live or die with them in de∣fence
of the liberty of his country, and hoped, with their
assistance, to redeem the Scottish name from all the in∣dignities,
which it had so long suffered from the tyranny
of their imperious masters: That the sacrifice of the
rights of his family was the first injury which had pre∣pared
the way for their ensuing slavery; and by resum∣ing
them, which was his firm purpose, he opened to
them the joyful prospect of recovering from the fraudu∣lent
usurper their antient and hereditary independance:
That all their past misfortunes had proceeded from their
disunion; and they would soon appear no less formid∣able
than of old to their enemies, if they now deigned
to follow into the field their rightful prince, who knew
no medium between death and victory: That their
mountains and their valour, which had, during so many
ages, protected their liberty from all the efforts of the
Roman empire, would still be sufficient, were they
worthy of their generous ancestors, to defend them a∣gainst
the utmost violence of the English tyrant: That
it was unbecoming men, born to the most antient inde∣pendance,
known in Europe, to submit to the will of any
masters; but fatal to receive those, who, being irritated
by such persevering opposition, and enflamed with the
highest animosity, would never deem themselves secure
of their usurped dominion but by exterminating all the
<PB N="327" REF="354"/>
antient nobility, and even all the antient inhabitants:
And that, being reduced to this desperate extremity, it
were better for them at once to perish, like brave men,
with their swords in their hands, than to dread long, and
at last undergo, the fate of the unfortunate Wallace,
whose merits, in the brave and obstinate defence of his
country, were finally rewarded by the hands of an Eng∣lish
executioner.</P>
<P>THE spirit with which this discourse was delivered,
the bold sentiments which it conveyed, the novelty of
Bruce's declaration, assisted by the graces of his youth
and manly deportment, made deep impression on the
minds of his audience, and rouzed all those principles of
indignation and revenge, with which they had long been
secretly actuated. The Scottish nobles declared their
unanimous resolution to use the utmost efforts in deliver∣ing
their country from bondage, and to second the cou∣rage
of Bruce, in asserting his and their undoubted
rights, against their common oppressors. Cummin alone,
who had secretly taken his measures with the King, op∣posed
this general determination; and by representing the
great power of England, governed by a prince of such
uncommon vigour and abilities, he endeavoured to set be∣fore
them the certain destruction, which they must ap∣prehend,
if they again violated their oaths of fealty,
and shook off their allegiance to the victorious Edward<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 453·</NOTE>.
Bruce, already apprized of his treachery, and forseeing
the certain failure of all his own schemes of ambition
and glory from the opposition of so potent a leader, took
immediately his resolution; and moved partly by resent∣ment,
partly by policy, followed Cummin on the disso∣lution
of the assembly, attacked him in the cloysters of
the Grey Friars thro' which he passed, and running him
<PB N="328" REF="355"/>
thro' the body, left him for dead. Sir Thomas Kirkpa∣tric,
one of Bruce's friends, asking him soon after, if the
traitor was slain; <HI>I believe so,</HI> replied Bruce. <HI>And is that
a matter,</HI> cried Kirkpatric, <HI>to be left to conjecture? I will se∣cure
him.</HI> Upon which he drew his dagger, ran to Cum∣min,
and stabbed him to the heart. This deed of Bruce
and his associates, which contains circumstances, justly
condemned by our present manners, was regarded in that
age as an effort of manly vigour and just policy. The
family of Kirkpatric took for the crest of their arms,
which they still wear, a hand with a bloody dagger:
And chose for their motto these words, <HI>I will secure him;</HI>
the expression employed by their ancestor, when he exe∣cuted
that violent action.</P>
<P>THE murder of Cummin affixed the seal to the con∣spiracy
of the Scottish nobles:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Third re∣volt of Scotland.</NOTE> They had now no re∣source
left but to shake off the yoke of England, or to
perish in the attempt: The genius of the nation rouzed
itself from its present dejection: And Bruce, flying to
different quarters, excited his partizans to arms, attacked
with success the dispersed bodies of the English, got pos∣session
of many of the castles, and having made his au∣thority
be acknowledged in most parts of the kingdom,
was solemnly crowned and inaugurated in the abbey of
Scone by the bishop of St. Andrews, who had zealously
embraced his cause. The English were again chaced
out of the kingdom, except such as took shelter in the
strong fortresses that remained in their hands; and Ed∣ward
found, that the Scots, twice conquered in his reign,
and often defeated, must yet be anew subdued. Not dis∣couraged
with these unexpected difficulties, he sent Ay∣mer
de Valence with a considerable force into Scotland
to check the progress of the insurgents; and that gene∣ral,
falling unexpectedly upon Bruce at Methven in
Perthshire, threw his army into such disorder, as ended
<PB N="329" REF="356"/>
in a total defeat<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 91. Heming. vol. i. p. 222, 223. Trivet. p, 344.</NOTE>. Bruce fought with the most heroic
courage, was thrice dismounted from his horse in the action,
and as often recovered himself; but was at last obliged
to yield to superior fortune, and take shelter with a few
followers in the western isles. The earl of Athole, Sir
Simon Fraser, and Sir Christopher Seton, who had been
taken prisoners, were ordered by Edward to be executed
as rebels and traitors<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 223. M. West. p. 456.</NOTE>. Many other acts of rigour were
exercised by him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1307.</NOTE> and that prince, vowing revenue
against the whole Scottish nation, whom he deemed in∣corrigible
in their aversion to his government, assembled a
great army, and was preparing to enter the frontiers, secure
of success, and determined to make the defenceless Scots
the victims of his severity: When he unexpectedly
sickened and died at Carlisle; enjoining, with his last
breath his son and successor to prosecute the enterprize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death 7th July.</NOTE>
and never to desist till he had finally subdued the king∣dom
of Scotland. He expired in the sixty-ninth year
of his age, and the thirty-fifth of his reign, hated by his
neighbours, but extremely respected and revered by his
own subjects.</P>
<P>THE enterprizes finished by this prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and cha∣racter of the King.</NOTE> and the pro∣jects
which he formed and brought very near to a con∣clusion,
were more prudent, more regularly conducted,
and more advantageous to the solid interests of his king∣dom
than those which were undertaken in any reign
either of his ancestors or his successors. He restored au∣thority
to the government, disordered by the weakenss
of his father; he maintained the laws against all the
efforts of his turbulent barons; he fully annexed to his
crown the principality of Wales; he took the wisest
and most effectual measures for reducing Scotland to a
like condition; and tho' the equity of this latter enter∣prize
<PB N="330" REF="357"/>
may reasonably be questioned, the circumstances
of the two kingdoms promised such certain success,
and the advantage was so visible of uniting the whole island
under one head, that those who give great indulgence to
reasons of state in the measures of princes, will not be
apt to regard this part of his conduct with much severity.
But Edward, however exceptionable his character may
appear on the head of justice, is the model of a politic
and warlike King: He possessed industry, penetration,
courage, vigour, and enterprize: He was frugal in all
expences that were not necessary; he knew how to open
the public treasures on a proper occasion; he punished
criminals with severity; he was gracious and affable to
his servants and courtiers; and being of a majestic figure,
expert at all bodily exercises, and in the main well pro∣portioned
in his limbs, notwithstanding the great length
and the smallness of his legs, he was as well qualified to
captivate the populace by his exterior appearance, as to
gain the approbation of men of sense by his more solid
virtues.</P>
<P>BUT the chief advantage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscellane∣ous transac∣tions of this reign.</NOTE> which the people of Eng∣land
reaped, and still continue to reap, from the reign
of this great prince, was the correction, extension,
amendment, and establishment of the laws, which Ed∣ward
maintained in great vigour, and left much im∣proved
to posterity: For the work of wife legislators
commonly remain; while the acquisitions of conquerors
often perish with them. This merit has justly gained
to Edward the appellation of the English Justinian. Not
only the numerous statutes, passed in his reign, touch
the chief points of jurisprudence, and, according to Sir
Edward Coke<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Institute, p. 156.</NOTE>, truly deserve the name of establishments,
because they were more constant, slanding, and durable
laws than any made since; but the regular order of his
<PB N="331" REF="358"/>
administration gave an opportunity to the common law
to refine itself, and brought the judges to a certainty in
their determinations, and the lawyers to a precision in
their pleadings. Sir Matthew Hale has remarked the
sudden improvement of English law during this reign;
and ventures to assert, that, till his own time, it had
never received any considerable encrease<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">History of the Englishlaw, p. 158, 163.</NOTE>. Edward set∣tled
the jurisdiction of the several courts; first established
the office of justice of peace; abstained from the prac∣tice
too common before him, of interrupting justice by
mandates from the privy council<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Articuli super Cart. cap. 6. Edward enacted a law to this pur∣pose; but it is very doubtful, whether he ever observed it. We are sure that scarce any of his successors did. The multitude of these let∣ters of protection were a ground of complaint by the commons in 3 Edw II. See Ryley, p. 525. This practice is declared illegal by the statute of Northampton passed in the second of Edward III. but still con∣tinued, like many other abuses. There are instances of it so late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</NOTE>; repressed robberies
and disorders<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Statue of Winton.</NOTE>; encouraged trade by giving merchants
an easy way of recovering their debts<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Satute of Acton Burnel.</NOTE>; and in short, in∣troduced
a new face of things by the vigour and wisdom,
of his government. As law began now to be well esta∣blished,
the abuse of that happiness began also to be re∣marked.
Instead of their former associations for robbery
and violence, men entered into formal combinations to
support each other in law-suits; and it was found re∣quisite
to check this grievance by act of parliament<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Statute of Conspirators.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE happened in this reign a considerable altera∣tion
in the execution of the laws: The King abolished
the office of chief judiciary, which he thought possessed
too much power, and was dangerous to the crown<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Spelman, Gloss. in verbo <HI>iusticiarius.</HI> Gilbert's Hist, of the Exchequer, p. 8.</NOTE>:
<PB N="332" REF="359"/>
He compleated the division of the court of exchequer
into four distinct courts, which managed, each, its seve∣ral
branch, without dependance on any one magistrate;
and as the lawyers invented a method, by means of their
fictions, to carry business from one court to another, the
several courts became rivals and checks to each other;
a circumstance which tended much to improve the prac∣tice
of the law in England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Edward appeared thus, thro' his whole
reign, a friend to law and justice, it cannot be said, that
he was an enemy to arbitrary power, and in a govern∣ment
more regular and legal than was that of England
in his age, such practices as those which may be re∣marked
in his administration, would have given suffi∣cient
ground of complaint, and sometimes were even in
his age the object of general displeasure. The violent
plunder and banishment of the Jews; the putting the
whole clergy, at once, out of the protection of law;
the seizing all the wool and leather of the kingdom;
the heightening the impositions on the former valuable
commodity; the new and illegal commission of Trail∣baston
the taking all the money and plate of monas∣teries
and churches, even before he had any quarrel
with the clergy; the subjecting every man possessed of
twenty pounds a year to military service, tho' not bound
to it by his tenure; his visible reluctance to confirm the
great charter, as if that concession had no validity from
the deeds of his predecessors; the captious clause which
he at last annexed to his confirmation; his procuring,
after all, the Pope's dispensation from the oaths which
he had taken to observe that charter; and his levying of
arbitrary talliages even after the statute, or rather charter,
by which he had renounced that prerogative; these are
<PB N="333" REF="360"/>
so many demonstrations of his arbitrary disposition, and
prove with what exception and reserve we ought to cele∣brate
his love of justice. He took care that his subjects
should do justice to one another; but he desired always
to have his own hands free in all his transactions, both
with them and with his neighbours.</P>
<P>THE chief obstruction to the execution of justice in
those times was the power of the great barons; and Ed∣ward
was perfectly qualified, by his character and abili∣ties,
to keep these tyrants in awe, and to restrain their
illegal practices. This salutary purpose was accordingly
the great object of his attention; yet he was imprudently
led into a measure which tended very much to encrease
and confirm their exorbitant authority. He passed a
statute, which, by allowing them to entail their estates,
made it impracticable to diminish the property of the
great families, and left them all means of encrease and
acquisition<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Brady of boroughs, p. 25, from the records.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD observed a contrary policy with regard to
the church: He seems to have been the first christian
prince who passed a statute of mortmain; and prevented
by law the clergy from making new acquisitions of lands,
which by the ecclesiastical canons they were for ever pro∣hibited
to alienate. The opposition between his maxims
with regard to the nobility and ecclesiastics, leads us to
conjecture, that it was only by chance he passed the be∣neficial
statute of mortmain, and that his sole object was,
to maintain the number of knights fees, and to prevent
the superiors from being defrauded of the profits of ward∣ship,
marriage, livery, and other emoluments arising
from the feudal tenures. This is indeed the reason
assigned in the statute itself, and appears to have been his
real object in enacting it. The author of the annals of
<PB N="334" REF="361"/>
Waverly ascribes this act chiesly to the King's anxiety
for maintaining the military force of the kingdom; but
adds that he was much mistaken in his purpose; for that
the Amalekites were overcome more by the prayers of
Moses than by the sword of the Israelites<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">P. 234. So also M. West. p. 409.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD was very active in restraining the usurpa∣tions
of the church, and excepting his ardour for Cru∣sades,
which adhered to him during his whole life, seems,
in other respects, to have been little infected with supper∣stition,
the vice chiefly of weak minds. But the passion
for Crusades was really in that age the passion for glory,
As the Pope now felt himself somewhat more restrained
in his former practice of pillaging the national churches
by general impositions upon them, he permitted the ge∣nerals
of particular orders, who resided at Rome, to levy
taxes on the several convents subjected to their juristic∣tion;
and Edward was obliged to enact a law against
this new abuse. It was also become a prance of the
court of Rome to provide successors to benefices before
they became vacant: Edward found it likewise necessary
to restrain by law this source of injustice and imposition.</P>
<P>THE tribute of 1000 marks a year, to which King John,
in doing homage to the Pope, had subjected the king∣dom,
had been pretty regularly paid since his time, tho'
the vassalage was constantly denied, and indeed, for fear
of giving offence, had been but little insisted on. The
payment was called by a new name of <HI>census,</HI> not by
that of tribute. King Edward seems to have always
paid this money with great reluctance, and he suffered
the arrears, at one time, to run on for six years<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 77, 107.</NOTE>, at
another for eleven<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 862.</NOTE>: But as princes in that age stood
continually in need of the Pope's good offices, for dis∣pensations
of marriages and other concessions, the court
<PB N="335" REF="362"/>
of Rome found always means, sooner or latter, to catch
the money. The levying of first fruits was also a, new
device, begun in this reign, by which his holiness got
his fingers very frequently into the purses of the faithful;
and the King seems unwarily to have given way to it.</P>
<P>EDWARD had by his first wife, Eleanor of Castile,
four sons, but Edward his heir and successor, was the
only one that survived him. She also bore him eleven
daughters, most of whom died in their infancy: Joan
was married first to the earl of Glocester, and after his
death, to Ralph de Monthermer: Margaret espoused
John duke of Brabant: Elizabeth espoused first John
earl of Holland; and afterwards the earl of Hereford:
Mary was a nun at Ambresbury. He had by his second
wife, Margaret of France, two sons and a daughter;
Thomas created earl of Norfolk, and Mareschal of Eng∣land;
and Edmond who was created earl of Kent by
his brother when King. The princess died in her in∣fancy.</P>
<P>IN the former reign the taxes had been partly scu∣tages,
partly a proportional part of the moveables, granted
by parliament: In this, scutages were entirely dropt;
and the assessment on moveables was the chief method of
taxation. Edward in his fourth year had a fifteenth
granted him; in his fifth year a twelfth; in his eleventh
year a thirtieth from the laity, a twentieth from the
clergy; in his eighteenth year a fifteenth; in his twenty
second year a tenth from the laity, a sixth from London
and other corporate towns, half of their benefices from
the clergy; in his twenty third year an eleventh from
the barons and others, a tenth from the clergy, a seventh
from the burgesses; in his twenty fourth year a twelfth
from the barons and others, an eighth from the burgesses,
from the clergy, nothing, because of the Pope's inhibit∣tion;
in his twenty fifth year an eighth from the laity,
<PB N="336" REF="363"/>
a tenth from the clergy of Canterbury, a fifth from those of
York; in his twenty ninth year a fifteenth from the laity,
on account of his confirming the perambulation of the
forests; the clergy granted nothing; in his thirty third
year, first a thirtieth from the barons and others, and a
twentieth from the burgesses, then a fifteenth from all
his subjects; in his thirty fourth year a thirtieth from all
his subjects for knighting his eldest son.</P>
<P>THESE taxes were moderate; but the King had also
duties upon exportation and importation granted him
from time to time: The heaviest was commonly upon
wool. Poundage, or a shilling a pound, was not regu∣larly
granted the Kings for life till the reign of Henry V.</P>

<P>THE prepossessions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIV.</NOTE> entertained in favour of young
Edward, kept the English from being fully sen∣sible
of the extreme loss, which they had sustained by
the death of the great monarch, who filled the throne;
and all men hastened with alacrity to take the oath of
allegiance to his son and successor. This prince was in
the twenty-third year of his age, was of an agreeable
figure, of a mild and gentle disposition, and having ne∣ver
discovered a propensity to any dangerous vice, it was
very natural to prognosticate tranquillity and happiness
from his government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weakness of the King.</NOTE> But the first act of his reign
blasted all these hopes, and shewed him to be totally un∣qualified
for that perilous situation, in which every Eng∣lish
monarch during those ages, had, from the unstable
form of the constitution, and the turbulent dispositions
of the people, derived from it, the misfortune to be
placed. The indefatigable Robert Bruce, tho' his army
had been dissipated and he himself had been obliged to
<PB N="338" REF="365"/>
take shelter in the western isles, remained not long in
tranquillity; but before the death of the late King, had
sallied from his retreat, had again collected his followers,
had appeared in the field, and had obtained by surprize
an important advantage over Aymer de Valence, who
commanded the English forces<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 346.</NOTE>. He was now become so
considerable as to have afforded the King of England
suffcient glory in subduing him, without incurring any
danger of his seeing all those mighty preparations, made
by his father, fail in the enterprize. But Edward, instead
of pursuing his advantages, marched but a little way
into Scotland; and having an utter incapacity, and equal
aversion for all application or serious business, he imme∣diately
returned upon his footsteps, and dispersed his
army. His grandees perceived from this conduct, that the
authority of the crown, fallen into such feeble hands,
was no longer to be dreaded, and that every insolence
might be pracised by them with impunity.</P>
<P>THE next measure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His passion for favour∣ites.</NOTE> taken by Edward, gave them an
inclination to attack those prerogatives, which no longer
kept them in awe. There was one Piers Gavaston,
the son of a Gascon knight of some distinction, who had
honourably served the late King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Piers Gava∣ston.</NOTE> and who, in reward of
his merits, had obtained an establishment for his son in
the family of the prince of Wales. This young man
soon insinuated himself into the affections of his master,
by his agreeable behaviour, and by supplying him with
all those innocent, tho' frivolous amusements, which
suited his capacity and his inclinations. He was endow∣ed
with the utmost elegance of shape and person, was
noted for a fine mien and easy carriage, distinguished
himself in all warlike and genteel exercises, and was
celebrated for those quick sallies of wit, by which his
country is distinguished. By all these accomplishments
<PB N="339" REF="366"/>
he gained so entire an ascendant over young Edward,
whose heart was strongly disposed to friendship and con∣fidence,
that the late King, apprehensive of the conse∣quences,
had banished him the kingdom, and had, be∣fore
he died, made his son promise never to recall him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 95. Ypod. Neust. p. 499. Trivet, cont. p. 2.</NOTE>.
But he no sooner found himself master, as he vainly ima∣gined,
than he sent for Gavaston, and even before his
arrival at court, endowed him with the whole earldom,
of Cornwal, which had escheated to the crown, by the
death of Edmond, son of Richard King of the Romans<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 1. Heming. vol. i. p. 243. Walsing. p. 96. Ypod. Neust. p. 499. Trivet, cont. p. 2.</NOTE>.
Not content with conferring on him those possessions,
which had sufficed as an appanage for a prince of the
blood, he daily loaded him with new honours and riches;
married him to his own niece, sister of the earl of Glo∣cester<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 245. Ypod. Neust. p. 500. T. de la More, p. 593.</NOTE>,
and seemed to enjoy no pleasure in his royal
dignity, but as it enabled him to exalt to the highest
splendor this object of his fond affections.</P>
<P>THE haughty barons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontent of the ba∣rons.</NOTE> offended at the superiority of a
minion, whose birth, tho' reputable, they despised,
as much inferior to their own, concealed not their discon∣tent;
and soon found reasons to justify their animosity
in the character and conduct of the man they hated. In∣stead
of disarming envy by the moderation and modesty
of his behaviour, Gavaston displayed his power and in∣fluence
with the utmost ostentation; and deemed no cir∣cumstance
of his good fortune so agreeable as its enabling
him to eclipse and mortify all his rivals. He was vain∣glorious,
profuse, rapacious; fond of exterior pomp
and appearance, giddy with prosperity; and as he ima∣gined,
that his fortune was now as strongly rooted in
the kingdom, as his ascendant was uncontrouled over the
<PB N="340" REF="367"/>
weak monarch, he took no farther care of engaging par∣tizans,
who might support his sudden and ill established
grandeur. At all tournaments, he took delight in foil∣ing
the English nobility, by his fuperior address: In
each conversation, he made them the object of his wit
and raillery: Every day his enemies multiplied upon
him; and nought was wanting but a little time to ce∣ment
their union, and render it fatal, both to him and
to his master<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 593. Walsing. p. 97.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT behoved the King to take a journey to France,
both in order to do homage for the dutchy of Guienne,
and to espouse the princess Isabella, to whom he had
long been contracted, tho' unexpected accidents had
hitherto retarded the completion of the marriage<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 593. Trivet, cont. p. 3.</NOTE>. Ed∣ward
left Gavaston guardian of the realm<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 47. Ypod. Neust. p. 499.</NOTE>, with more
ample powers, than had usually been conferred<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 49.</NOTE>; and
on his return with his young queen, renewed all the
proofs of that fond attachment to his favourite, of which
every one so loudly complained. This princess was of
an imperious and intriguing spirit; and finding, that her
husband's capacity required, as well as his temper in∣clined,
him to be governed, she thought herself best in∣titled,
on every account, to perform the office, and she contracted a mortal hatred against the person, who had
disappointed her in these expectations. She was well
pleased, therefore, to see a combination of the nobility
forming against Gavaston, who, sensible of her hatred,
had wantonly provoked her by new insults and injuries.</P>
<P>THOMAS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1308.</NOTE> earl of Lancaster, cousin-german to the
King, and first prince of the blood, was by far the most
<PB N="341" REF="368"/>
opulent and powerful subject in England, and possessed
in his own right, and soon after in that of his wife,
heiress of the family of Lincoln, no less than six earl∣doms,
with a proportional estate in land, attended with
all the jurisdictions and power, which commonly in that
age were annexed to landed property. He was turbu∣lent
and factious in his disposition; mortally hated the
favourite, whose influence with the King exceeded his
own; and he soon became the head of that party among
the barons, who desired tbe depression of this insolent
stranger. The confederated nobles bound themselves by
oath, to expel Gavaston: Both sides began already to
put themselves in a warlike posture: The licentiousness
of the age broke out in robberies and other disorders, the
usual preludes of civil war: And the royal authority,
despised in the King's own hands, and hated in those of
Gavaston, became insufficient for the execution of the
laws, and the maintenance of peace in the kingdom. A
parliament being summoned at Westminster, Lancaster
and his party came thither with an armed retinue; and
were there enabled to impose their own terms on the
sovereign. They required the banishment of Gavaston,
imposed an oath on him never to return, and engaged
the bishops, who never failed to interpose in all civil
concerns, to pronounce him excommunicate, if he re∣mained
any longer in the kingdom<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Trivet, cont. p. 5.</NOTE>. Edward was obliged to submit<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 80.</NOTE>; but even in his compliance, gave
proofs of his fond attachment to his favourite. Instead
of removing all umbrage, by sending him to his own country, as was expected, he appointed him lord lieute∣nant
of Ireland<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 92. Murimuth, p. 39.</NOTE>, attended him to Bristol on his journey
thither, and before his departure conferred on him new
lands and riches both in Gascony and England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 87.</NOTE>. Ga∣vaston,
<PB N="342" REF="369"/>
who did not want bravery, and possessed talents
for war<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Heming. vol. i. p. 248. T. de la More, p. 593.</NOTE>, acted, during his government, with vigour
against some Irish rebels, whom he subdued.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the King, less shocked with the ille∣gal
violence which had been imposed upon him, than unhappy in the absence of his minion, employed every
expedient to soften the opposition of the barons to his
return; as if success in that point were the chief object of
his government. The high office of hereditary steward was conferred on Lancaster: His father-in-law, the earl
of Lincoln, was bought off by other concessions: Earl
Warrenne was also mollisied by civilities, grants or pro∣mi
ses: The insolence of Gavaston, being no longer be∣fore
men's eyes, was less the object of general indigna∣tion:
And Edward, deeming matters sufficiently pre∣pared
for his purpose, applied to the court of Rome, and
obtained a dispensation from that oath, which the barons
had compelled Gavaston to take, that he would abjure
for ever the realm<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 167.</NOTE>. He went down to Chester, to
receive him on his first landing from Ireland; flew into
his arms with transports of joy; and having obtained the
formal consent of the barons in parliament to his re-esta∣blimment,
set no longer any bounds to his extravagant
fondness and affection. Gavaston himself, forgetting
his past misfortunes, and blind to their causes, resumed
the same ostentation and insolence; and became more
than ever the object of general detestation among the
barons.</P>
<P>THE nobility first discovered their animosity by ab∣senting
themselves from parliament; and finding, that
this expedient had not been successful, they began to
think of employing sharper and more effectual remedies.
<PB N="343" REF="370"/>
Tho' there had scarce been any other national ground of
complaint, except some dissipation of the public treasure:
Tho' all the acts of mal-administration, objected to the
King, and his favourite, seemed of a nature more pro∣per
to excite heart-burnings in a ball or assembly, than
commotions in a great kingdom: Yet such was the situ∣ation
of the times, that the barons were determined,
and were able, to make them the reasons of a total al∣teration
in the constitution and civil government. Hav∣ing
come to parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th Feb.</NOTE> in defiance of the laws and
the King's prohibition, with a numerous retinue of
armed followers, they found themselves entirely masters;
and presented a petition, which was equivalent to a com∣mand,
requiring Edward to devolve on a chosen junto
the whole authority both of the crown and of the par∣liament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th March</NOTE>
The King was obliged to sign a commission,
empowering the prelates and barons to elect twelve per∣sons,
who should, till the term of Michaelmas in the
year following, have authority to enact ordinances, for
the government of the kingdom, and the regulation of
the King's houshold; consenting that these ordinances
should thenceforth and for ever have the force of laws
and statutes; allowing the ordainers to form associations
among themselves and their friends, for their strict: and
regular observance; and all this for the greater glory of
God, the security of the church, and the honour and
advantage of the king and kingdom<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 50. Heming. vol. i. p. 247. Walsing. p. 97. Ryley, p. 526.</NOTE>. The barons in
return signed a declaration, in which they acknowledged,
that they owed these concessions merely to the King's
free bounty; promised that this should never be drawn
into precedent; and engaged, that the power of the
ordainers should expire at the term appointed<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="371"/>
THE chosen junto of twelve accordingly framed their
ordinances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1311.</NOTE> and presented them to the King and parlia∣ment;
for their confirmation in the ensuing year. Some
of these ordinances were laudable, and tended to the re∣gular
execution of justice: Such as those, requiring
sheriffs to be men of property, abolishing the practices
of issuing privy seals for the suspension of justice; re∣straining the practice of purveyance, prohibiting the adul∣teration
or alteration of the coin, excluding foreigners
from the farms of the revenue, ordering all payments to
be regularly made into the exchequer, revoking all late
grants of the crown, and giving the parties damages in
the case of vexatious prosecutions. But what chiefly
grieved the King was the ordinance for the removal of
evil counsellors, by which a great number of person
were by name excluded from every office of power and
profit; and Piers Gavaston himself was for ever banished
the King's dominions, under the penalty, in case of
disobedience, of being declared a public enemy. Other
persons, more agreeable to the barons, were substituted
in all the offices. And it was ordained, that, for the
future, all the considerable dignities in the houshold, as
well as in the law, revenue, and military governments,
should be appointed by the <HI>baronage</HI> in parliament; and
the power of making war, or assembling his military te∣nants,
should no longer be solely vested in the King, nor
be exercised without the consent of the nobility.</P>
<P>EDWARD, from the same weakness both of his tem∣per
and situation, which had engaged him to grant
this unlimited cornmission to the barons, was led to give
a parliamentary sanction to their ordinances: But as a
consequence of the same character, he <HI>secretly</HI> made a
protest against them, and declared, that, since the com∣mission
was granted only for the making of ordinances to
the advantage of the King and kingdom, such articles as
<PB N="345" REF="372"/>
should be found prejudicial to both, were to be held as
not ratified and confirmed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ryley's Placit. Parl. p. 530, 541.</NOTE>. It is no wonder, indeed,
that he retained a firm purpose to revoke ordinances,
which had been imposed on him by violence, which en∣tirely
annihilated the royal authority, and above all,
which deprived him of the company and society of a per∣son,
whom, by an unusual infatuation, he valued above
all the world, and above every other consideration of
interest or tranquillity.</P>
<P>So soon, therefore, as Edward, removing to York,
had freed himself from the immediate terror of the barons
power, he invited back Gavaston from Flanders, which
that favourite had made the place of his retreat; and de∣claring
his banishment to be illegal, and contrary to the
laws and customs of the kingdom<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 53. Walsing. p. 98.</NOTE>, openly re-instated
him in his former credit and authority. The barons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1312.</NOTE>
highly provoked at this disappointment, and apprehen∣sive
of danger to themselves from the declared animosity
of so powerful a minion, saw, that either his or their
ruin was now inevitable; and they renewed with redoubled
zeal their former confederacies against him. The earl
of Lancaster was a dangerous head of this alliance:
Guy, earl of Warwic, entered into it with a furious
and precipitate passion: Humphrey Bohun, earl of Here∣ford,
the constable, and Aymer de Valence, earl of
Pembroke, brought to it a great accession of power and
interest: Even earl Warrenne deserted the royal cause,
which be had hitherto supported, and was induced to
embrace the side of the consederates<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Trivet, cont. p. 4.</NOTE>: And as Robert
de Winchelfey, archbishop of Canterbury, declared him∣self
of the same party, he determined the body of the
clergy, and consequently the people, to declare against

the King and his minion. So predominant, at that
time, was the power of the great nobility, that the com∣bination
of a few of them was always able to shake
the throne; and such an universal concurrence became irre∣sistible.
The earl of Lancaster suddenly raised an army,
and marched to York, where he found the King already
removed to Newcastle<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 101.</NOTE>: He flew thither in pursuit of him; and Edward had just time to escape to Tinmouth,
where he embarked, and sailed with Gavaston to Scar∣borough.
He left his favourite in that fortress, which,
had it been properly supplied with provisions, was
deemed impregnable; and he marched forward to York,
in hopes of raising an army, which might be able to
support him against his enemies. Pembroke was sent
by the confederates to besiege the castle of Scarborough;
and Gavaston, sensible of the bad condition of his gar∣rison,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th May.</NOTE>
was obliged to capitulate with the enemy, and
surrender himself prisoner<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 101.</NOTE>. He stipulated, that he
should remain in Pembroke's hands for two months;
that endeavours should, during that time, be mutually
used for a general accommodation; that if the terms
proposed by the barons were not accepted, the castle
should be restored to him in the same condition as when
he surrendered it; and that the earl of Pembroke and
Henry Piercy should, by contract, pledge all their lands
for the fulfilling of these conditions<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ii. p. 324.</NOTE>. Pembroke, now
master of the person of this public enemy, conducted
him to the castle of Dedington, near Banbury; where,
on pretence of other business, he left him protected by a
feeble guard<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 593.</NOTE>. Warwic, probably in concert with
Pembroke, attacked the castle: The guards refused to
make any resistance: Gavaston was yielded up to him,
and conducted to Warwic castle: The earls of Lancas∣ter,
<PB N="347" REF="376"/>
Hereford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Gavaston. 1st July.</NOTE> and Arundel, immediately repaired thi∣ther
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Baron. vol. ii. p. 44.</NOTE>: And without any regard, either to the laws or
the military capitulation, they ordered the head of this
obnoxious favourite to be struck off, by the hands of the
executioner<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 101. T. de la More, p. 593. Trivet, cont. p. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King had retired northward to Berwic, when he
heard of Gavaston's murder; and his resentment was
proportioned to the affection which he had ever borne
him, while living. He threatened vengeance on all the
nobility, who had been active in that bloody scene, and
he made preparations for war in all parts of England.
But being less constant in his enmities than in his friend∣ships,
he soon after hearkened to terms of accommoda∣tion;
granted the barons a pardon for all offences; and
as they stipulated to ask him publickly pardon on their
knees<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ryley, p. 538. Rymer, vol. iii. p. 366.</NOTE>, he was so pleased with these vain appearances
of exterior submission, that he seemed to have sincerely
forgiven them all past injuries. But as they still pre∣tended,
notwithstanding their lawless conduct, a great
anxiety for the maintenance of law; and required the
establishment of their former ordinances as a necessary
security for that purpose; Edward told them, that he
was willing to grant them a free and legal confirmation
of such of these ordinances as were not entirely deroga∣tory
to the prerogatives of the crown. This answer was
received for the present as satisfactory. The King's per∣son,
after the death of Gavaston, was now become less
obnoxious to the public; and as the ordinances, insisted
on, appeared to be nearly the same with those, which had
been formerly extorted from Henry III. by Mountfort,
and which had been attended with so many fatal confe∣quences,
they were, on that account, demanded with
<PB N="348" REF="377"/>
less vehemence by the nobility and people. The minds
of all men seemed to be much appeased towards each
other: The animosities of faction no longer prevailed:
And England, now united under its head, would hence∣forth
be able, it was hoped, to take vengeance on all its
enemies; particularly on the Scots, whose progress was
the object of general resentment and indignation.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after Edward's retreat from Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE>
Robert Bruce left his fastnesses, in which he intended to
have sheltered his feeble force; and supplying his defect
of power by superior vigour and abilities, he made deep
impressions on all his enemies, foreign and domestic.
He chased the lord Argyle and the chieftain of the Mac∣dowals
from their hills, and made himself entirely master
of the high country: He thence invaded with success the
Cummins in the low countries of the north: He took
the castles of Inverness, Forfar, and Brechin: He gained
daily some new accession of territory; and what was a
more important acquisition, he daily reconciled the minds
of the nobility to his dominion, and enlisted under his
standard every bold leader, whom he enriched by the
spoils of his enemies. Sir James Douglas, in whom
commenced the greatness and renown of that warlike
family, seconded him in all his enterprizes: Edward
Bruce, Robert's own brother, distinguished himself by
actions of valour: And the terror of the English power
being now abated by the feeble conduct of the King,
even the least sanguine of the Scots began to entertain
hopes of recovering their independancy; and the whole
kingdom, except a few strong fortresses, which he had
not the means to attack, had acknowledged the autho∣rity
of Robert.</P>
<P>IN this situation, Edward had found it necessary to
grant a truce to Scotland; and Robert successfully em∣ployed
this interval in consolidating his power, and in∣troducing
<PB N="349" REF="378"/>
order into the civil government, disjointed by
such a long continuance of war and facions. The in∣terval
was very short: The truce, ill observed on both
sides, was at last openly violated; and war recommenced
with greater fury than ever. Robert, not contented
with defending himself, had made successful inroads into
England, subsisted his needy followers by the plunder of
that country, and taught them to despise the military
genius of a nation, who had long been the object of
their terror. Edward at last, rouzed from his lethargy,
had conducted an army into Scotland; and Robert, de∣termined
not to risque too much against an enemy so
much superior, retired again into his mountains. The
King advanced beyond Edinburgh; but being destitute
of provisions, and being ill supported by the English
nobility, who were then employed in framing their ordi∣nances,
he was soon obliged to return home, without
gaining any advantage over the enemy. But the ap∣pearing
union of all the parties in England, after the
death of Gavaston, seemed to restore that kingdom to its
native force, opened again the prospect of subjecting
Scotland, and promised a happy conclusion to a war, in
which both the interests and passions of the nation were
so deeply concerned.</P>
<P>EDWARD assembled forces from all quarters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1314.</NOTE> with a
view of finishing by one blow this important enterprize.
He summoned the most warlike of his vassals from Gas∣cony:
He inlisted troops from Flanders and other foreign
countries: He invited over great numbers of the disorderly
Irivh as to a certain prey: He joined to them a body of
the Welsh, who were actuated by like motives: And
assembling the whole military force of England, he
marched to the frontiers with an army, which, according
to the Scots writers, amounted to an hundred thousand
<PB N="350" REF="379"/>
men, but which was probably much inferior to that
number<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">We find in Rymer, vol. iii. p. 481. a list of all the infantry assem∣bled from all parts of England and Wales; and they are only 21540. It is not likely therefore that the whole army could be near so numerous at is reported.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE army collected by Robert, exceeded not thirty
thousand combatants; but being composed of men, who
had distinguished themselves by many acts of valour,
who were rendered desperate by their situation, and who
were enured to all the varieties of fortune, they might
justly, under such a leader, be deemed formidable to the
most numerous and best appointed armies. The castle
of Stirling, which, with Berwic, was the only fortress
of Scotland, that remained in the hands of the English,
had been long besieged by Edward Bruce; and Philip de
Mowbray, the governor, after an obstinate defence,
was at last obliged to capitulate, and to promise that if,
before a certain day, which was now approaching, he
was not relieved, he should open his gates to the ene∣my<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 481.</NOTE>.
Robert therefore, sensible that here was the
ground on which he must expect the English, chose the
field of battle with all the skill and prudence imaginable,
and made the necessary preparations for their reception,
He posted himself at Bannockburn, about two miles
from Stirling; where he had a hill on his right flank,
and a morass on his left: And not content with having
taken these precautions to prevent his being surrounded
by the more numerous army of the English; he foresaw
the superior strength of the enemy in cavalry, and made
provisions against it. Having a rivulet in front, he
commanded deep pits to be dug along its banks, and
sharp slakes to be planted in them, and he ordered the
whole to be carefully covered over with turf<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 594.</NOTE>. The
English arrived in sight on the evening, and a bloody
<PB N="351" REF="380"/>
conflict immediately ensued between two bodies of ca∣valry;
where Robert, who was at the head of the Scots,
engaged in single combat with Henry de Bohun, a gen∣tleman
of the family of Hereford; and at one stroke
cleft his adversary to the chin with a battle ax, in sight
of the two armies. The English horse fled with preci∣pitation
to their main body.</P>
<P>THE Scots, encouraged by this favourable event, and
glorying in the valour of their prince, prognosticated a
happy issue to the combat on the ensuing day: The
English, confident in their numbers, and elated with
past successes, longed for an opportunity of revenge:
And the night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Bannock∣burn.</NOTE> tho' extremely short in that season and
in that climate, appeared tedious to the impatience of
the several combatants.<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th June.</NOTE> Early in the morning, Edward
drew out his army, and advanced towards the Scots.
The earl of Glocester, his nephew, who commanded the
left wing of the cavalry, impelled by the ardour of youth,
rushed on to the attack without precaution, and fell
among the covered pits, which had been prepared by
Bruce for the reception of the enemy<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 594.</NOTE>. This body of
horse was disordered: Glocester himself was overthrown
and slain: Sir James Douglas, who commanded the
Scottish cavalry, gave the enemy no leisure to rally, but
pushed them off the field with considerable loss, and pur∣sued
them in sight of their whole line of infantry.
While the English army were alarmed with this unfor∣tunate
beginning of the action, which commonly proves
decisive, they observed an army on the heights towards
their left, which seemed to be marching leisurely in or∣der
to surround them; and they were distracted by
their multiplied fears. This was a number of waggon∣ers
and sumpter boys, whom Robert had collected toge∣ther;
and having supplied them with military standards,
<PB N="352" REF="381"/>
gave them the appearance at a distance of a formidable
army. The stratagem took effect: A panic feized the
English: They threw down their arms and fled: They
were pursued with great slaughter, for the space of eighty
miles, till they reached Berwic: And the Scots, besides
an inestimable booty, toot many persons of quality prison∣ers,
and above 400 gentlemen, whom Robert treated with great humanity<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 501.</NOTE>, and whose ransom was a new
accession of wealth to the victorious army. The King
himfelf very narrowly escaped by taking shelter in Dun∣bar,
whose gates were opened to him by the earl of
March; and he thence passed by fea to Berwic.</P>
<P>SUCH was the great and decisive battle of Bannock∣burn,
which secured the independancy of Scotland, fixed
Bruce on the throne of that kingdom, and may be
deemed the greatest overthrow, which the English mo∣narchy,
since the conquest, has ever received. The
numbers of slain on these occasions are always uncertain,
and are commonly much magnified by the victors: But
this defeat made a deep impression on the minds of the
English; and it was remarked, that, for some years, no
superiority of numbers could encourage them to keep
the field against the Scots<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 106.</NOTE>. Robert, to make advan∣tage
of his present success, broke into England, and
ravaged all the northern counties without opposition:
He befieged Carlifle, tho' that place was saved by the
valour of Sir Andrew Harcla, the governor: He was
more succefsful against Berwic, which he took by as∣sault<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 594. Murimuth, p. 53.</NOTE>:
And this prince, elated by his continued prospe∣rity,
entertained hopes of making the most important
conquests on the English.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1315.</NOTE> He sent over his brother Ed∣ward,
with an army of 6000 men, into Ireland; and
<PB N="353" REF="382"/>
that nobleman assumed the title of King of Ireland<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Trivet, cont. p. 28.</NOTE>: He
followed soon after himself with more numerous forces:
The horrible and absurd oppressions, which the Irish suf∣fered
under the English government, made them, at first,
fly to the standard of the Scots, whom they regarded as
their deliverers: But a grievous famine, which at that
time laid desolate both Ireland and Britain, reduced the
Scottish army to the greatest extremities; and Robert
was obliged to return, with his forces much diminished,
into his own country. His brother, after having expe∣rienced
a variety of fortune, was defeated and slain near
Dundalk by the English, commanded by lord Berming∣ham<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 767, 777. Walsing. p. 3. Y pod. Neust. p. 503. T. de la More, p. 594. Trivet, cont. p. 29.</NOTE>:
And these projects, too extensive for the force of
the Scottish nation, thus vanished into smoke.</P>
<P>THE King, besides suffering those disasters from the
invasion of the Scots and the insurrection of the Irish,
was also infested with a rebellion in Wales<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 553</NOTE>; and above
all by the factions of his own nobility, who took advan∣tage
of the public calamities, insulted his fallen fortunes,
and endeavoured to establish their own independance on
the ruins of the throne. Lancaster and the barons of his
party, who had declined attending Edward on his Scot∣tish
expedition, no sooner saw him return with disgrace,
than they insisted on the renewal of their ordinances,
which they still pretended to have validity; and the
King's unhappy condition obliged him to submit to their
demands. The ministry was new modeled by the di∣rection
of Lancaster<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ryley, p. 560. Rymer, vol. iii. p. 722.</NOTE>: That nobleman was placed at
the head of the council: It was declared, that all the
offices should be filled, from time to time, by the votes
of parliament, or rather, by the will of the great ba∣rons<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Brady, vol. ii. p. 122. from the records, app. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 61. Ryley, p. 560.</NOTE>:
<PB N="354" REF="383"/>
And the nation, under this new model of government,
endeavoured to put itself in a better posture of
defence against the Scots. But the factious nobles were
far from being terrified with the progress of these public
enemies: On the contrary, they founded the hopes of
their own future grandeur on the weakness and diftresses
of the crown: Lancafter himfelf was suspected, with
great appearance of reason, of holding a secret corres∣pondence
with the King of Scots: And tho' he was him∣felf
entrusted with the command of the English armies,
he took care that every enterprise should be disappointed,
and every plan of operations prove unsuccessful.</P>
<P>ALL the European kingdoms, especially that of Eng∣land,
were at this time totally unacquainted with the
office of a prime minister, so well understood at present
in all regular monarchies; and the people could form no
conception of a man, who, tho' still in the rank of a
subject, possessed all the power of a sovereign, eased the
prince of the burthen of affairs, supplied his want of
experience or capacity, and maintained all the rights of the crown,
without degrading the great∣est nobles by
their submission to his temporary authority. Edward
was plainly by nature unfit to hold himfelf the reins of go∣vernment:
He had no vices; but was unhappy in a total
incapacity for serious business: He was sensible of his
own defects, and necessarily sought to be governed: Yet
every favourite, whom he successively chose, was re∣garded
as a fellow-subject, exalted above his rank and
station: He was the object of envy to the great nobility:
His character and conduct were decryed with the peo∣ple:
His authority over the king and kingdom was con∣sidered
as an usurpation: And unless the prince had em∣braced
the dangerous expedient, of devolving his power
<PB N="355" REF="384"/>
on the earl of Lancaster or some mighty baron, whose
family interest was so extensive as to be able alone to
maintain his influence, he could expect no peace nor
tranquillity upon the throne.</P>
<P>THE King's chief favourite,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hugh le Despenser.</NOTE> after the death of Ga∣vaston,
was Hugh le Despenser or Spenser, a young man
of English birth, of high rank, and of a noble family<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Baron. vol. i. p. 389.</NOTE>.
He possessed all the exterior accomplishments of person
and address, which were fitted to engage the weak mind
of Edward; but was devoid of that moderation and
prudence, which might have qualified him to mitigate
the' envy of the great, and conduct him thro' all the
perils of that dangerous station, to which he was ad∣vanced.
His father, who was of the same name, and
who, by means of his son, had also attained great influ∣ence
over the King, was a nobleman venerable from his
years, respected thro' all his past life for wisdom, valour,
and integrity, and well fitted by his talents and experi∣ence,
could affairs have admitted of any temperament,
to have supplied the defects both of the King and of
his minion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 594.</NOTE>. But no sooner was Edward's attachment
declared for young Spenser, than the turbulent Lancaster,
and most of the great barons, regarded him their rival,
made him the object of their animosity, and formed vio∣lent
plans for his ruin<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 113. T. de la More, p. 595. Murimuth, p. 55.</NOTE>. They first declared their dif∣content
by withdrawing from parliament; and it was
not long ere they found a pretence for proceeding to
greater extremities against him.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1321.</NOTE> who set no limits to his bounty towards
his minions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil com∣motions.</NOTE> had married the younger Spenser to his
niece, one of the co-heirs of the earl of Glocester, slain
at Bannockburn; and the favourite, by his succession
<PB N="356" REF="385"/>
to that opulent family, had inherited great possessions in
the marches of Wales<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Trivet, cont. p. 25.</NOTE>, and being desirous of extending
still farther his influence in those quarters, he is accused
of having committed injustice towards the barons of
Audley and d'Ammori, who had also married two sisters
of the same family. There was likewife a baron in
that neighbourhood, called William de Braouse, lord of
Gower, who had made a settlement of his estate on John
de Mowbray, his son-in-law; and in case of failure of
that nobleman and his issue, had substituted the earl of
Hereford, in the succession to the barony of Gower.
Mowbray, on the decease of his father-in-law, entered
immediately into possession of the estate, without the
formality of taking livery and feizin from the crown;
and Spenser, who coveted that barony, persuaded the
King to put in execution the rigour of the feudal law, to
seize Gower as escheated to the crown, and to confer it
upon him<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Monach, Malmes.</NOTE>. This transaction, which was the proper
subject of a law-fuit, immediately excited a civil war in
the kingdom. The earls of Lancaster and Hereford
flew to arms: Audley and d'Ammori joined them with
all their forces: The two Rogers de Mortimer and Roger
de Clifford, with many others, disgusted for private rea∣sons
with the Spensers, brought a considerable accession
to the party: And their army being now formidable,
they sent a message to the King, requiring him immedi∣ately
to diimifs or confine the younger Spenser; and me∣nacing
him, in case of refusal, with renouncing their
homage and allegiance to him, and taking revenge on
that minister by their own authority. They scarce
waited for an answer; but immediately fell upon the
lands of young Spencer, which they pillaged and destroy∣ed;
murdered his servants, drove off his cattle, and
<PB N="357" REF="386"/>
burned his houses<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Murimuth, p. 55.</NOTE>. They proceeded thence to commit
like devastations on the estates of Spenser, the father,
whose character hitherto they had seemed to respect.
And having drawn and signed a formal association among
themselves<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. ii. p. 280, from the register of C. C. Canterbury.</NOTE>, they marched up to London with all their
forces, stationed themselves in the neighbourhood of that
city, and demanded of the King the banishment of both
the Spensers. These noblemen were then absent; the
father abroad; the son at sea; and both of them em∣ployed
in different commissions: The King therefore
replied, that his coronation oath, by which he was bound
to observe the laws, restrained him from giving his assent
to so illegal a demand, or condemning noblemen who
were accused of no crime, nor had any opportunity af∣forded
them of making answer<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 114.</NOTE>. Equity and reason
were but a feeble opposition to men, who had arms in
their hands, and who, being already involved in guilt,
saw no safety but in success and victory. They entered
London with their troops; and giving in to the parlia∣ment,
which was then sitting, a charge against the
Spensers, of which they attempted not to prove one
article, they procured, by menaces and violence, a sen∣tence
of perpetual exile and forfeiture against these minis∣ters<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Tottle's collect. part 2. p. 50. Walsing. p. 114.</NOTE>.
This sentence was voted by the lay barons alone:
For the commons, tho' now an estate in parliament,
were yet of so little consideration, that their assent was
never demanded; and even the voice of the prelates
was neglected amidst the present disorders. The only
symptom, which these turbulent barons gave of their re∣gard
to law, was their requiring from the King an in∣demnity
for their illegal proceedings<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Tottle's collect, part 2. p. 54. Rymer, vol. iii. p. 891.</NOTE>; after which they
<PB N="358" REF="387"/>
disbanded their army, and separated, in security, as they
imagined, to their several castles.</P>
<P>THIS act of violence, in which the King was obliged
to acquiesce, rendered his person and his authority so
contemptible, that every one thought himself entitled to
treat him with neglect. The queen, having occasion
soon after to pass by the castle of Leeds in Kent, which
belonged to the lord Badlesmere, desired a night's lodging;
but was resused admittance, and some of her attendants,
who presented themselves at the gate, were killed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 89. Walsing. p. 114, 115. T. de la More, p. 595. Murimuth, p. 56.</NOTE>.
The insult and brutality towards this princess, who had
always endeavoured to live on good terms with the ba∣rons,
and who joined them heartily in their hatred of the
I younger Spenser, was an action which no body pre∣tended
to vindicate; and the King thought, that he
might, without giving general umbrage, assemble an
army, and take vengeance on the offender. No one
came to the assistance of Badlesmere; and Edward pre∣vailed<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 115.</NOTE>:
But having now some forces on foot, and
having concerted rneasures with his friends throughout
England, he ventured to take off the mask, to attack all
his enemies, and to recall the two Spensers, whose sen∣tence
he declared illegal, unjust, contrary to the tenor
of the great charter, passed without the assent of the
prelates, and extorted by violence from him and the
estate of barons<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 907. T. de la More, p. 595.</NOTE>.
Still the commons were not men∣tioned
by either party.</P>
<P>THE King had now got the start of his adversaries;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1322.</NOTE>
an advantage, which, in those times, was commonly
decisive: And hastened with his army to the marches
of Wales, the chief seat of the enemies power, whom he
found totally unprepared for resistance. Many of the
<PB N="359" REF="388"/>
barons in those parts endeavoured to appease him by
submission<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 115. Murimuth, p. 57.</NOTE>:
Their castles were seized, and their per∣sons
committed to custody. But Lancaster, in order to
prevent the total ruin of his party, summoned together
all his vassals and retainers; declared his alliance with
Scotland, which had long been suspected; received the
promise of a reinforcement from that country under the
command of Randolf, earl of Murray, and Sir James
Douglas<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 958.</NOTE>; and being joined by the earl of Hereford,
advanced with all his forces against the King, who had
collected an army of 30,000 men, and was superior to
his enemies. Lancaster posted himself at Burton upon
Trent, and endeavoured to defend the passages of the
river<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 115.</NOTE>: But being disappointed in that plan of opera∣tions;
this nobleman, who had no military genius, and
whose personal courage was even suspected, fled with his
army to the north, in expectation of being there joined
by his Scottish allies<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 504.</NOTE>. He was pursued by the King;
and his army diminished daily; till he came to Borough-bridge,
where he found Sir Andrew Harcla posted with
some forces on the opposite side of the river, and ready
to dispute the passage with him. He was repulsed in an
attempt which he made to force his way; the earl of
Hereford was killed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 March.</NOTE> the whole army of the rebels was
disconcerted; Lancaster himself was become incapable
of taking any measures either for flight or defence; and
he was seized without resistance by Harcla, and con∣ducted
to the King<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 596. Walsing. p. 116.</NOTE>. In those violent times, the laws
were so much neglected on both sides, that, even where
they might, without any sensible inconvenience, have
been observed, the conquerors deemed it unnecessary to
pay any regard to them. Lancaster, who was guilty of
<PB N="360" REF="389"/>
open rebellion, and was taken in arms against his
sovereign, instead of being tried by the laws of his
country, which pronounced the sentence of death
against him, was condemned by a court-martial<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. ii. p. 291. from the records.</NOTE>, and
led to execution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d March. Execution of the earl of Lancas∣ter.</NOTE> Edward, however little vindictive in
his natural temper, here indulged his revenge, and prac∣tised
against the prisoner the same indignities, which had
been exercised by his orders against Gavaston. He was
cloathed in a mean attire, placed on a lean jade without
a bridle, a hood was put on his head, and in this posture,
attended by the acclamations of the people, this prince
was conducted to an eminence near Pomfret, one of his
own castles, and there beheaded<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Leland's Coll. vol. i. p. 668.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS perished Thomas earl of Lancaster, the first
prince of the blood, and one of the most potent barons
who had ever been in England. His public conduct
sufficiently discovers the violence and turbulency of his
character: His private deportment appears not to have
been more innocent<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2540.</NOTE>: And his hypocritical devotion, by
which he gained the favour of the monks and populace,
will rather be regarded as an aggravation than an alle∣viation
of his guilt<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Higden, lib. 7. cap. 42.</NOTE>. Badlesmere, Giffard, Barret,
Cheyney, Fleming, and about eighteen of the most no∣torious
offenders, were afterwards condemned by a legal
trial and were executed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 596.</NOTE>. Many were thrown into pri∣son:
Others made their escape beyond sea: Some of the
King's servants were rewarded from the forfeitures:
Harcla received for his services the earldom of Carlisle<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii p. 943. Walsing. p. 118.</NOTE>,
and a large estate, which he soon after forfeited with his
life, for a. treasonable correspondence with the King of
Scotland<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 988. 994. 999. vol. iv. p. 4. Walsing. p. 118. Ypod. Neust. p. 505.</NOTE>. But the greatest part of all those vast es∣cheats
<PB N="361" REF="390"/>
was seized by young Spenser, whose rapacity was
insatiable<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Dugd. vol. i. p. 393.</NOTE>. Many of the barons of the King's party
were disgusted with this partial division of the spoils:
The envy against Spenser rose higher than ever: The
usual insolence of his temper, raised by success, impel∣led
him to commit many acts of violence<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Dugd. vol. i. p. 393. T. de la More, p. 597.</NOTE>. The peo∣ple,
who always hated him, made him still more the
object of their aversion: All the relations of the attainted
barons and gentlemen secretly vowed revenge: And tho'
tranquillity was in appearance restored to the kingdom,
the general contempt of the King and odium against
Spenser, bred dangerous humours, the source of future
revolutions and convulsions.</P>
<P>IN this situation no success could be expected from fo∣reign
wars; and Edward, after making one more fruitless
attempt against Scotland, whence he retreated with dis∣honour,
found it necessary to terminate hostilities with
that kingdom, by a truce of thirteen years<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 1022. Murimuth, p. 60.</NOTE>: Robert,
tho' his title to the crown was not acknowledged in the
treaty, was satissied with ensuring his possession of it
during so long a time. He had repelled with gallantry
all the attacks of England: He had successsully carried
war both into that kingdom and into Ireland: He had
rejected with disdain the Pope's authority, who pretended
to impose his commands upon him, and oblige him to
make peace with his enemies: His throne was firmly esta∣blished,
as well in the affections of his subjects, as by
force of arms: Yet there naturally remained some in∣quietude
in his mind, while at war with a state, which,
however at present disordered by faction, was of itself so
much an over-match for him both in riches and in num∣bers
of people. And this truce was, at the same time,
<PB N="362" REF="391"/>
the more convenient for England; because the nation
was in that juncture threatened with hostilities from
France.</P>
<P>PHILIP the Fair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1324.</NOTE> King of France, who died in 1315,
had left the crown to his son Lewis Hutin, who, after
a short reign, dying without male issue, was succeeded by
Philip the Long, his brother, whose death soon after
made way for Charles the Fair, the youngest brother of
that family. This monarch had some reasons of com∣plaint
against the King's ministers in Guienne; and as
there was no common nor equitable judge in that strange
species of sovereignty, established by the feudal law, he
seemed desirous to take advantage of Edward's weakness,
and under that pretence, to confiscate all his, foreign do∣minions<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 74. 98.</NOTE>.
After an ernbassy by the earl of Kent, the
King's brother, had been tried in vain, Queen Isabella
obtained permission to go over to Paris, and endeavour
to adjust, in an amicable manner, the difference with her
brother<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 140. Murimuth, p. 63.</NOTE>: But while she was making some progress
in this negotiation, Charles started a new pretension, the
justice of which could not be disputed, that Edward him∣self
should appear in his court, and do the homage of a
vassal for the fees which he held in France<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 596. Walsing. p. 117. Ypod. Neust. p. 505. Murimuth, p. 60.</NOTE>. But there oc∣curred
many difficulties in complying with this demand.
Young Spenser, by whom the King was implicitly govern∣ed,
had unavoidably been engaged in many quarrels with
the Queen, who aspired to the same authority; and tho'
that artful princess, on her leaving England, had dissembled
her animosity<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 194.</NOTE>, Spenser, well acquainted with her secret
sentiments, was unwilling to attend his master to Paris,
and appear in a court, where her credit might expose him
<PB N="363" REF="392"/>
to insults, if not to danger. He hesitated no less on
allowing the King to make the journey alone; both
fearing, left that easy prince should in his absence fall
under some other influence, and foreseeing the perils, to
which he himself should be exposed, if, without the
protection of the royal authority, he remained in Eng∣land,
where he was so generally hated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1325.</NOTE> While these
doubts bred delays and difficulties, Isabella proposed, that
Edward should resign the dominion of Guienne to his
son, now thirteen years of age; and that the prince
should come to Paris, and do the homage which every
vassal owed to his superior lord<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 163, 164, 165. Walsing. p. 120. T. de la More, p. 597. Murimuth, p. 64.</NOTE>. This expedient, which seemed
so happily to remove all difficulties, was im∣mediately
complied with: Spenser was charmed with the
contrivance: Young Edward was sent to Paris: And
the ruin, covered under this fatal snare, was never per∣ceived,
nor suspected, by any of the English council.</P>
<P>THE Queen, on her arrival in France, had found
there a great number of English fugitives, the remains
of the Lancastrian faction; and their common hatred of
Spenser, soon bred a secret friendship and correspondence
between them and that princess. Among the rest was
young Roger Mortimer, a potent baron in the Welsh
marches, who had been obliged, with others, to make
his submission to the King, had been condemned for high
treason; but having received a pardon for his life, was
afterwards detained in the Tower, with an intention of
rendering his imprisonment perpetual. He was so for∣tunate
as to make his escape into France<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 7, 8-20. T. de la More, p. 596. Walsing. p. 120. Ypod. Neust. p. 506.</NOTE>; and be∣ing
one of the most considerable persons now remaining
of the party, as well as distinguished by his violent ani∣mosity
against Spenser, he was easily admitted to pay
<PB N="364" REF="393"/>
his court to Queen Isabella. The graces of his person
and address advanced him quickly in her affections: He
became her confident and counsellor in all her measures:
And gaining daily ground upon her heart, he engaged
her to sacrifice at laft, to her passion, all the sentiments
of honour and of fidelity to her husband<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 598. Murimuth, p. 65.</NOTE>. Hating
now the man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspiracy against the King.</NOTE> whom she had injured, and whom she
never valued, she entered cordially into all Mortimer's
conspiracies; and having artfully got into her hands the
young prince, and heir of the monarchy, she resolved
on the utter ruin of the King, as well as of his favourite.
She engaged her brother to enter into this criminal
purpose: Her court was daily full of the exiled barons:
Mortimer lived in the most declared intimacy with her:
A correspondence was secretly carried on with the male
content party in England: And when Edward, informe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of these alarming circumstances, required her speedily to
return with the prince, she publicly replied, that she never
would set foot in the kingdom, till Spenser was forever
removed from his presence and councils: A declaration,
which procured her great popularity in England, and
threw a decent veil on all her treasonable enterprizes.</P>
<P>EDWARD endeavoured to put himself in a posture of
defence<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 184. 188. 225.</NOTE>; but besides the difficulties arising from his
own indolence and slender abilities, and the want of
authority, which of consequence attended all his reso∣lutions,
it was not easy for him, in the present state of
the kingdom and revenue, to maintain a constant force,
ready to repell an invasion, which he knew not at what
time or place he had reason to expect. All his efforts
were unequal to the traiterous and hostile conspiraces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣ons.</NOTE>
which both at home and abroad were forming against
<PB N="365" REF="394"/>
his authority, and which were daily penetrating farther
even into his own family. His brother, the earl of
Kent, a virtuous but weak prince, who was then at
Paris, was unwarily engaged by his sister-in-law, and by
the King of France, who was also his cousin german,
to give countenance to the invasion, whose sole object,
he believed, was the expulsion of the Spensers: He pre∣vailed
on his elder brother the earl of Norfolk, to enter
secretly into the same design: The brother and heir of
the earl of Lancaster had too many reasons for his
hatred of these ministers, to refuse his concurrence.
Walter de Reynel, archbishop of Canterbury, and many
of the prelates expressed their approbation of the Queen's
measures: Several of the most potent barons, envying
the exorbitant authority of the favourite, were ready to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to arms: The minds of the people, by means of
some truths and many calumnies, were strongly disposed
to the same party: And there needed but the appearance
of the Queen and Prince, with such a body of foreign
troops, as might be sufficient to give her protection
against immediate violence, to turn all this tempest so
artfully prepared, against the unhappy Edward.</P>
<P>CHARLES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1326.</NOTE> tho' he gave countenance and assistance
to the faction, was ashamed openly to support the Queen
and prince, against the authority of a husband and father;
and Isabella was obliged to court the alliance of some
other foreign potentate, from whose dominions she might
set out on her intended enterprize. For this purpose,
she affianced young Edward, whose tender age made him
incapable to judge of the consequences, with Philippa,
daughter of the count of Holland and Hainault<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 598.</NOTE>; and
having by the open assistance of this prince, and the
secret protection of her brother, inlisted in her service
<PB N="366" REF="395"/>
near 3000 men at arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Sep∣tember.</NOTE> she set out from the harbour
of Dort, and landed safely, and without opposition, on
the coast of Suffolk. The earl of Kent was in her
company: Two other princes of the blood, the earl of
Norfolk, and the brother of the earl of Lancaster,
joined her soon after her landing with all their follow∣ers:
Three prelates, the bishops of Ely, Lincoln, and
Hereford, brought her both the force of their vassals and
the authority of their character<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 123. Ypod. Neust. p. 507. T. de la More, p. 598. Murimuth, p. 66.</NOTE>: Even Robert de Wat∣teville,
who had been sent by the King to oppose her
progress in Suffolk, deserted to her with all his forces.
To render her cause more favourable, she renewed her
declaration, that the sole purpose of her enterprise was
to free the king and kingdom from the tyranny of the
Spensers, and of chancellor Baldoc, their creature<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 508.</NOTE>. The
populace were allured by her specious pretences: The
barons thought themselves secure against forfeitures by
the appearance of the prince of Wales in her army:
And a weak irresolute King, supported by ministers ge∣nerally
odious, was altogether unable to stem this torrent,
which bore with such irresistible violence against him.</P>
<P>EDWARD, after trying in vain to rouze the citizens
of London to some sense of loyalty<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 123.</NOTE>, departed for the
west, where he hoped to meet with a better reception;
and he had no sooner discovered his weakness by leaving
the city, than the rage of the populace broke out with∣out
controul against him and his ministers. They first
plundered and then murdered all those who were ob∣noxious
to them: They seized the bishop of Exeter, a
virtuous and loyal prelate, as he was passing through
the streets; and having beheaded him, they threw his
body into the river<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 124. T. de la Move, p. 599. Murimuth, p. 66.</NOTE>. They made themselves masters
<PB N="367" REF="396"/>
of the Tower by surprize; and then entered into a for∣mal
association to put to death, without mercy, every
one who should dare to oppose the enterprize of queen
Isabella, and of the prince<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 124.</NOTE>. A like spirit was soon
communicated to all other parts of England; and threw
the few servants of the King, who still entertained
thoughts of performing their duty, into terror and astonishment.</P>
<P>EDWARD was hotly pursued to Bristol by the earl of
Kent, seconded by the foreign forces under John de
Hainault. He found himself disappointed in his expec∣tations
with regard to the loyalty of those parts; and
he passed over to Wales, where he flattered himself
his name was more popular, and which he hoped to
ind free from the contagion of general rage, which had
seized the English<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Murimuth, p. 67.</NOTE>. The elder Spenser, lately created
earl of Winchester, was left governor of the castle of
Bristol; but the garrison mutinied against him, and he
was delivered into the hands of his enemies. This
venerable noble, who had nearly reached the nine∣tieth
year of his age, was instantly, without a trial,
or witness, or accusation, or answer, condemned to death
by the rebellious barons: He was hanged on a gibbet;
his body was cut in pieces, and thrown to the dogs<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Leland's Coll. vol. i. p. 673. T. de la More, p. 599. Walsing. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 125. M. Froissart, liv. i. chap. 13.</NOTE>;
and his head was sent to Winchester, the place whose
title he bore, and was there set on a pole, and exposed
to the insults of the populace.</P>
<P>THE King, disappointed anew in his expectations of
succours from the Welsh, took shipping for Ireland;
but being drove back by contrary winds, he endea∣voured
to conceal himself in the mountains of Wales:
He was soon discovered, was put under the custody of
<PB N="368" REF="397"/>
the earl of Lancaster, and was confined in the castle of
Kenilworth. The younger Spenser, his favourite, who
also fell into the hands of his enemies, was executed,
like his father, without any appearance of a legal trial<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 125. Ypod. Neust. p. 508.</NOTE>:
The earl of Arundel, almost the only man of his rank
in England, who had maintained his loyalty, was also,
without any trial, put to death at the instigation of
Mortimer: Baldoc, the chancellor, being a priest, could
not with safety be so suddenly dispatched; but being
sent to the bishop of Hereford's house in London, he
was there, as his enemies probably foresaw, seized by
the populace, was thrown into Newgate, and soon
after expired, from the cruel usage which he had re∣ceived<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 126. Murimuth, p. 68.</NOTE>.
Even the usual reverence, paid the sacerdotal
character, gave way, with every other consideration,
to the present rage of the people.</P>
<P>THE queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King dethroned.</NOTE> to avail herself of the prevailing delu∣sion,
summoned, in the King's name, a parliament at
Westminster, where, together with the power of her
army, and the authority of her partizans among the
barons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1327.</NOTE> who were concerned to secure their part trea∣sons
by committing new acts of violence against their
sovereign, she expected to be seconded by the fury of
the populace, the most dangerous of all instruments,
and the least answerable for their excesses. A charge
was drawn up against the King, in which, even tho'
it was framed by his inveterate enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th Ja∣nuary.</NOTE> nothing but
his narrow genius, or his misfortunes, were objected to
him: Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the greatest malice found no particular crime
with which it could reproach this unhappy prince.
He was accused of incapacity for government, of wasting
his time in idle amusements, of neglecting public busi∣ness,
of being swayed by evil counsellors, of having
<PB N="369" REF="398"/>
lost, by his misconduct, the kingdom of Scotland, and
part of Guienne; and to swell the charge, even the
death of some barons, and the imprisonment of some
prelates, convicted of treason, were laid to his account<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2765, 2766. Brady's App. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 72.</NOTE>.
It was in vain, amidst the violence of arms and tumult
of the people, to appeal either to law or reason: The
deposition of the King, without any appearing oppo∣sition,
was voted by parliament: The prince, already
declared regent by his party<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 137. Wolsing. p. 125.</NOTE>, was placed on the throne:
And a deputation was sent to Edward at Kenilworth, to
require his resignation, which menaces and terror soon
extorted from him.</P>
<P>BUT it was impossible, that the people, however cor∣rupted
by the barbarity of the times, still farther en∣flamed
by faction, could for ever remain insensible to the
voice of nature. A wife, who had first deserted, next
invaded, and then dethroned her husband: Who had
made her infant son an instrument in this unnatural
treatment of his father: Who had by lying pretences se∣duced
the nation into a rebellion against their sovereign:
Who had pushed them into violences and cruelties, that
had dishonoured them: All those circumstances were so
odious in themselves, and formed such a complicated
scene of guilt, that the least reflection sufficed to open
mens eyes, and make them detest this flagrant infringe∣ment
of every public and private duty. The suspicions
which soon arose of Isabella's criminal commerce with
Mortimer, the prooss which daily broke out of this part
of her guilt, encreased the general abhorrence against
her; and her impudent hypocrisy, in publicly bewail∣ing
with tears the King's unhappy fate<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Wolsing. p. 126.</NOTE>, was not able
to deceive even the most stupid and most prejudiced of
her adherents. In proportion as the Queen became the
<PB N="370" REF="399"/>
object of public hatred, the dethroned monarch, who
had been the victim of her crimes and her ambition,
was regarded with pity, with friendship, with veneration;
and men became sensible, that all his misconduct, which
faction had so much exaggerated, had been owing to
the unavoidable eakness, not to any voluntary depra∣vity
of his character. The new earl of Lancaster, to
whose custody he had been committed, was soon touched
with these generous sentiments; and besides using his
prisoner with gentleness and humanity; he was suspected
to have entertained still more honourable intentions in
his favour. The King, therefore, was taken out of his
hands, and delivered over to the lord Berkeley, and
Mautravers, and Gournay, who were entrusted alter∣nately,
each for a month, with the charge of guarding
him. While he was in Berkeley's custody, he was still
used with the gentleness due to his rank and his mis∣fortunes;
but when Mautravers, and Gournay's turn
came, every species of indignity was practised against
him, as if their intention had been to break entirely the
prince's spirit; and to employ his sorrows and afflict∣tions,
instead of more violent and more dangerous expe∣dients,
for the instruments of his murder<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Anonymi Hist. p. 838.</NOTE>. It is re∣ported,
that one day, when Edward was to be shaved,
they ordered cold and dirty water to be brought from
the ditch for that purpose; and when he desired it to be
changed, and was still denied his request, he burst out
into tears, which bedewed his cheeks; and he exclaimed,
that, in spite of their insolence, he should be shaved
with clean and warm water<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">T. de la More, p. 602.</NOTE>. But as this means for
laying Edward in his grave appeared still too slow to the
impatient Mortimer, he secretly sent orders to the two
keepers, who were at his devotion, instantly to dispatch
him; and these ruffians contrived to make the manner of
<PB N="371" REF="400"/>
his death as cruel and barbarous as possible.<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st Septr.</NOTE> Taking ad∣vantage
of Berkeley's sickness, in whose custody he then,
was, and who was thereby incapacitated from attending
his charge<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg p. 8.</NOTE>; they came to Berkeley-castle, and put
themselves in possession of the King's person.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King murdered.</NOTE> They
threw him on the bed; held him down violently with a
table, which they flung over him; thrust into his funda∣ment
a red-hot iron, which they inserted thro' a horn;
and tho' the outward marks of violence upon his person
were prevented by this expedient, the horrid deed was
discovered to all the guards and attendants by the screams,
with which the agonizing King filled the castle, while
his bowels were consuming<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Walsing p. 127. Ypod. Neust. p. 509. Heming. p. 268. T. de la More, p. 603.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GOURNAY and Mautravers were held in detestation by
all mankind; and when the ensuing revolution in Eng∣land
threw their protectors from power, they found it
necessary to provide for their safety by flying the kingdom.
Gournay was afterwards seized at Marseilles, delivered over
to the Seneschal of Guienne, put on board a ship with a
view of carrying him over to England; but was beheaded
at sea, by secret orders, as was supposed, from some
nobles and prelates in England, anxious to prevent any
discovery, which he might make of his accomplices<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 128. Anon. Hist. p. 390.</NOTE>. Mautravers concealed himself for several years in Ger∣many;
but having found means of rendering some service
to Edward III. he ventured to approach his person,
threw himself on his knees before him, submitted to his
mercy, and received a pardon<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 66, 81. Rymer, vol. v. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is not easy to imagine a man more innocent and
inoffensive than the unhappy King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac∣ter.</NOTE> whose tragical death
we have related; nor a prince less fitted for governing
<PB N="372" REF="401"/>
that fierce and turbulent people, subjected to his autho∣rity.
He was obliged to devolve on others the weight of
government, which he had neither ability nor inclination
to bear: The same indolence and want of penetration
led him to make choice of ministers and favourites, who
were not always the best qualified for the trust committed
to them: The seditions grandees, pleased with his weak∣ness,
yet complaining of it; under pretence of attacking
his ministers, insulted his person and invaded his autho∣rity.
And the impatient populace, ignorant of the source
of their grievances, threw all the blame upon the King,
and encreased the public disorders by their faction and
violence. It was in vain to look for protection from the
laws, whose voice, always feeble in those times, was not
heard amide the din of arms: What could not defend
the King was less able to give shelter to any of the peo∣ple:
The whole machine of government was torne in
pieces with fury and violence: And men, instead of
complaining against the manners of their age, and the
form of their constitution, which required the most steady
and most skilful hand to conduct them, imputed all
errors to the person, who had the misfortune to be en∣trusted
with the reins of empire.</P>
<P>BUT tho' such mistakes be natural and unavoidable
while the events are recent, it is a shameful delusion in
modern historians, to imagine, that all the antient princes,
who were unfortunate in their government, were also
tyrannical in their conduct, and that the seditions of the
people proceeded always from some invasion of their
liberties and privileges by the monarch. Even a great
and a good King was not in that age secure against fac∣tion
and rebellion, as appears <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the case of Henry II.
but a great King had the best chance, as we learn from
the history of the same period, or quelling and subduing
them. Compare the reigns and characters of Edward I.
<PB N="373" REF="402"/>
and II. The father made several violent attempts against
the liberties of the people: His barons opposed him: He
was obliged, at least found it prudent, to submit: But as
they dreaded his valour and abilities, they were contented
with reasonable satisfaction, and pushed no farther their
advantages against him. The facility and weakness of
the son, not his violence, threw every thing into confu∣sion:
The laws and government were overturned: An
attempt to reinstate them was an unpardonable crime:
And no atonement, but the deposition and tragical death
of the King himself, could give these barons content∣ment.
It is easy to see, that a constitution, which de∣pended
so much on the personal character of the sove∣reign,
must necessarily, in many of its parts, be a go∣vernment
of will, not of laws. But always to throw,
without distinction, the blame of all disorders upon the
prince, would introduce a fatal error in politics, and
serve as a perpetual apology for treason and rebellion: As
if the turbulency of the great, and madness of the people,
were not, equally with the tyranny of princes, an evil
incident to human society, and no less carefully to be
guarded against in every well regulated constitution.</P>
<P>WHILE these abominable scenes passed in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscellane∣ous transac∣tions during this reign.</NOTE>
the theatre of France was stained with a wickedness
equally barbarous, and still more public and deliberate.
The order of knights templars had arisen during the first
fervour of the Crusades and uniting the two qualities
the most popular in that age, devotion and valour, and
exercising both in the most popular of all enterprizes, the
defence of the Holy Land, they had made rapid advances
to credit and authority, and had acquired, from the piety
of the faithful, very ample possessions in every country
of Europe, especially in France. Their great riches,
joined to the course of time, had, by degrees, relaxed
the severity of these virtues; and the templars had in a
<PB N="374" REF="403"/>
great measure lost that popularity, which first raised there to honour and distinction. Acquainted from experience
with the fatigues and dangers of those fruitless expedi∣tions
to the East, they chose rather to enjoy in ease their
opulent revenues in Europe: And being all of them men
of birth, educated, according to the custom of that age,
without any tincture of letters, they scorned the ignoble
occupations of a monastic life, and passed their time
wholly in the fashionable amusements of hunting, gal∣lantry,
and the pleasures of the table. Their rival order,
that of St. John of Jerusalem, whose poverty had as yet
preserved them from like corruptions, still distinguished
themselves by their enterprizes against the infidels, and
succeeded to all the popularity, which was lost by the
indolence and luxury of the templars. But though these
causes had weakened the foundations of this order, once
so celebrated and revered, the immediate source of their
destruction proceeded from the cruel and vindictive spirit
of Philip the Fair, who having entertained a private dis∣gust
against some eminent templars, determined to gratify
at once his avidity and revenge, by involving the whole
order in one undistinguished ruin. On no better infor∣mation,
than that of two knights, condemned by their
superiors to perpetual imprisonment for their vices and
profligacy; he ordered on, one day all the templars of
France to be committed to prison, and imputed to them
such enormous and absurd crimes, as are sufficient of
themselves to destroy all the credit of the accusation.
Besides their being universally charged with murder, rob∣bery,
and vices the most shocking to nature; every one,
it was pretended, whom they received into their order,
was obliged to renounce our Saviour, to spit upon the
cross<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 31, 101.</NOTE>, and to join to this impiety the superstition of
worshiping a gilded head, which was secretly kept in
<PB N="375" REF="404"/>
one of their houses at Marseilles. They also initiated,
it was said, every candidate by such infamous rites, as
could serve to no other purpose, than to degrade the order
in his eyes, and destroy for ever the authority of all his
superiors over him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">It was pretended, that he kissed the knights who received him on the mouth, navel and breech. Dupuy, p. 15, 16, Wals. p. 99.</NOTE>. Above an hundred of these un∣happy
gentlemen were put to the question, in order to
extort from them a confession of their guilt: The more
obstinate perished in the hands of their tormentors: Se∣veral,
to procure themselves immediate ease in the vio∣lence
of their agonies, acknowledged whatever was re∣quired
of them: Forged confessions were imputed to
others<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vertot, hist. de Chev. de Malte, vol. ii. p. 127, 130, &amp;c.</NOTE>: And Philip, as if their guilt were now certain,
proceeded to a confiscation of all their treasures. But no
sooner had the templars recovered from their tortures,
than, preferring the most cruel execution to a life with
infamy, they disavowed their confessions, exclaimed
against the forgeries, justified the innocence of their or∣der,
and appealed to all the gallant actions, performed
by them in ancient or latter times, as a full apology for
their conduct. The barbarous tyrant, enraged at this
disappointment, and thinking himself now engaged in
honour to proceed to extremities, ordered fifty-four
of them, whom he branded as relapsed heretics, to perish
by the punishment of fire in his capital<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vertot, vol. ii. p, 132. Trivet, Cont. p. 8.</NOTE>: Great numbers
expired after a like manner in other parts of the king∣dom:
And when he found, that the perseverance of these
unhappy victims, in justifying to the last their innocence,
had made deep impression on the spectators, he, endea∣vourgd
to overcome the constancy of the templars by new
inhumanities. The grand master of the order, John de
Molay, and another great officer, brother to the sove∣reign
of, Dauphiné, were conducted to a scaffold, erected
<PB N="376" REF="405"/>
before the church of Notredame, at Paris: A full pardon
was offered them on the one hand: The fire, destined
for their execution, was shown to them on the other:
These gallant nobles still persisted in the protestations of
their own innocence and that of their order; and were
instantly hurried into the flames by the executioner<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vertot, vol. ii. p. 142.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN all this barbarous injustice, Clement V. who was
the creature of Philip, and then resided in France, fully
concurred; and without examining a witness, or making
any enquiry into the truth of facts, he summarily, by
the plenitude of his apostolic power, abolished the whole
order. The templars all over Europe were thrown into
prison; their conduct underwent a strict scrutiny; the
power of their enemies still pursued and oppressed them;
but no where, except in France, were the smallest traces
of their guilt pretended to be found. England sent back
an ample testimony of their piety and morals; but as the
order was now annihilated, the knights were distributed
into several convents, and their possessions were, by com∣mand
of the Pope, transferred to the order of St. John<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii p. 323, 956. vol. iv. p. 47. Ypod. Neust. p. 506.</NOTE>.
We now proceed to relate some other detached transac∣tions
of the present period.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of England was afflicted with a grievous
famine during several years of this reign. Perpetual
rains and cold weather, not only destroyed the harvest,
but bred a mortality among the cattle, and raised every
kind of food to an enormous price<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Trivet, cont. p. 17,18.</NOTE>. The parliament,
in 1315, endeavoured to fix more moderate rates on com∣modities;
not sensible that such an attempt was imprac∣ticable,
and that, were it possible to reduce the price of
food by any other expedient than introducing plenty,
nothing could be more pernicious and destructive to the
public. Where the produce of a year, for instance, falls
<PB N="377" REF="406"/>
so far short, as to afford full subsistance only for nine
months, the only expedient for making it last all the
twelve, is to rais the prices, to put the people by that
means on short allowance, and oblige them to spare their
food, till a more plentiful year. But in reality, the
encrease of prices is a necessary consequence of scarcity;
and laws, instead of preventing it, only encrease the
evil, by cramping and restraining commerce. The par∣liament
accordingly in, the ensuing year, repealed their
ordinance, which they had found useless and burden∣some<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Wals. p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE prices affixed by the parliament are somewhat
remarkable: Two pounds eight shillings of our present
money for the best ox, not fed with corn: If fed with
corn, three pounds twelve shillings: A fat hog of two
years old, ten shillings: A fat wether unshorn, a crown:
If shorn, three shillings and six pence: A fat goose, seven
pence halfpenny: A fat capon, six pence: A fat hen,
three pence: Two chickens, three pence: Four pigeons,
three pence: Two dozen of eggs, three pence<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 7 Edw. II. n. 35, 36. Ypod. Neust. p. 502.</NOTE>. If we
consider these prices, we shall find, that butcher's meat,
in this time of great scarcity, must still have been sold by
the parliamentary ordinance, three times cheaper than
our middling prices at present: Poultry somewhat lower;
because, being now considered as a delicacy, it has risen
beyond its proportion. In the country places of Ireland
and Scotland, where delicacies bear no price, poultry is at
present as cheap, if not cheaper, than butcher's meat. But
the inference I would draw from the comparison of prices is
fill more considerable: I suppose that the rates, affixed
by parliament, were inferior to the usual market prices
in those years of famine and mortality of cattle; and
that these commodities, instead of a third, had really
<PB N="378" REF="407"/>
risen to a half of the present value. But the famine at
that time was so consuming, that wheat was sometimes
sold for above four pounds ten shillings a quarter<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Murimuth, p. 48. Walsingham, p. 108, says it rose to six pounds.</NOTE>, usu∣ally
for three pounds<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 502. Trivest, cont. p. 18.</NOTE>; that is, considerably above twice
our middling prices. A certain proof of the wretched
state of tillage in those ages. We formerly found, that
the middling price of corn in that period was a half of
the present value; while the middling price of cattle was
only an eighth part: We here find the same immense dis∣proportion
in years of scarcity. It may thence be infer∣red
with certainty, that the raising of corn was a species
of manufactory, which, few in that age could practise
with advantage: And there is reson to think, that other
manufactures more refined, were sold even beyond their
present prices: At least there is a demonstration for it in
the reign of Henry VII. from the prices affixed to scarlet
and other broad cloths by act of parliament. During all
those times, it was usual for the princes and great nobi∣lity
to make settlements of their velvet beds and silken
robes, in the same manner as of their estates and manors<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Dugdale.</NOTE>.
In the list of jewels and plate, which had belonged to
the oftentatious Gavafton, and which the King recovered
from the earl of Lancaster after the murder of that favou∣rite,
we find some embroidered girdles, flowered shirts,
and silk waistcoats<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 388.</NOTE>. It was afterwards one article of
accusation against that potent and opulent earl, when
tried for his life, that he had, purloined some of these
effects of Gavaston. The ignorance of those ages in
manufactures, and especially in tillage, is a clear proof
that they were far from being populous.</P>
<P>ALL trade and manufactures indeed were then at a
very low ebb. The only country in the northern parts
<PB N="379" REF="408"/>
of Europe, where they seem to have risen to any tolerable
degree of improvement, was Flanders. When Robert,
earl of that country, was applied to by Edward, and was
desired to break off commerce with the Scots, whom Ed∣ward
called his rebels, and represented as excommuni∣cated
on that account by the church, the earl replied,
that Flanders, was always considered as common and free
and open to all nations<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iii. p. 770.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE petition of the elder Spenser to parliament, com∣plaining
of the devastation committed on his lands by the
barons, contains several particulars, which are curious,
and discover the manners of the age<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Brady's hist. vol. ii. p. 143, from Claus. 15 Edw. II. M. 14. Dors in cedula.</NOTE>. He affirms, that
they had ravaged sixty three manors belonging to him,
and he makes his losses amount to 46,000 pounds; that
is, to 138,000 of our present money. Among other
particulars, he enumerates 28,000 sheep, 1000 oxen and
heifers, 1200 cows with their breed for two years, 560
cart horses, 2000 hogs, together with 600 bacons, 80
carcafses of beef, and 600 muttons in the larder;
ten tuns of cyder, arms for 200 men and other warlike en∣gines
and provisions. The plain inference is, that the
greatest part of Spenser's vast estate, as well as that of
the other nobility, was farmed by the landlord himself,
managed by his stewards or bailiffs, and cultivated by his
villains. Little or none of it was let on lease to husband∣men:
Its produce was consumed in rustic hospitality by
the baron or his officers: A great number of idle retain∣ers,
ready for any disorder or mischief, were maintained
by him: All who lived upon his estate were absolutely at
his disposal: Insead of applying to courts of justice, he
usually sought redress by open force and violence; The
great nobility were a kind of independant potentates,
who, if they submitted to any regulations at all, were
<PB N="380" REF="409"/>
less governed by the municipal law, than by a rude species
of the laws of nations. The method in which we find
they treated the King's favourites, and ministers, is a
proof of their usual way of dealing with each other. A
party, which complains of the arbitrary conduct of mi∣nisters,
ought naturally to affect a great regard for the
laws and constitution, and maintain at least the appear∣ance
of justice in their proceedings: Yet. these barons,
when discontented, came to parliament with an armed
force, constrained the King to assent to their measures,
and without any trial or witness or conviction, passed,
from the pretended notoriety of facts, an act of banish∣ment
or attainder against the minister, which, on the
first revolution of fortune, was reversed by like expe∣dients.
The parliament, during factious times, was no∣thing
but the organ of present power. Tho' the persons
of whom it was chiefly composed, seemed to enjoy great
ipdependance, they really possessed no true liberty; and
the security of each individual among them, was not so
much derived from the general protection of law, as from
his own private power and that of his confederates. The
authority of the monarch, tho' far from absolute, was
very irregular, and might often reach him: The current
of a faction might easily overwhelm him: A hundred
considerations, of benefits and injuries, friendships and
animosities, hopes and fears, were able to influence his
conduit; and amidst these motives a regard to equity and
law and justice was commonly, in those rude ages, of
little moment. Nor did any man' entertain thoughts of
opposing present power, who did not deem himself strong
enough to dispute the field with it by force, and was not
prepared to give battle to the sovereign or the ruling party.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude this reign, I cannot forbear making
another remark drawn from the detail of losses given in
<PB N="381" REF="410"/>
by the elder Spenser; particularly the great quantity
of salt meat which he had in his larder, 600 bacons, 80
carcasses of beef, 600 muttons. We may observe that
the outrage, of which he complains, began after the third
of May, as we learn from the same paper. It is easy
therefore to conjecture what a vast store of the same kind
he must have laid up at the beginning of winter; and we
may draw a new conclusion with regard to the wretched
state of the antient husbandry, which could not provide
any subsistance for the cattle during winter, even in such
a temperate climate as the south of England: For Spenser
had but one manor so far north as Yorkshire. There
being few or no enclosures, except perhaps for deer, no
sown grass, little hay, and no other resources for feeding
cattle; the barons, as well as the people, were obliged
to kill and salt their oxen and sheep at the beginning
of winter, before they became lean upon the common pas∣ture:
A precaution still practised with regard to oxen in
the least cultivated parts of this island. The salting of
mutton is a miserable expedient, which has every where
been long disused. From this circumstance, however
trivial in appearance, may be drawn very important in∣ferences,
with regard to the domestic oeconomy and man∣ner
of life in those ages.</P>
<P>THE disorders of the times, from foreign wars and
intestine dissentions, but above all, the cruel famine,
which obliged the nobility to dismiss many of their re∣tainers,
encreased the number of robbers in the king∣dom;
and no place was secure from their incursions.<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 502. Wals. p. 107.</NOTE>.
They met in troops like armies, and over-ran the
country. Two cardinals, themselves, the Pope's legates,
notwithstanding the numerous train, which attended
<PB N="382" REF="411"/>
them, were robbed, and despoiled of all their goods and
equipage, when they travelled on the road<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neustr. p. 503. T. de la More, p. 594. Trivet, co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. p. 22. Murimuth, p. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMONG the other wild fancies of the age, it was ima∣gined,
that the persons affected with leprosy, a disease at
that time very common, had conspired with the Saracens
to poison all the springs and fountains; and men being
glad of any pretence to get rid of those who were a bur∣then
to them, many of those unhappy people were burnt
alive for this chimerical imputation. Several Jews also
were punished in their persons, and their goods confis∣cated
on the same account<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 504.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS King left four children, two sons and two
daughters: Edward, his eldest son and successor; John,
created afterwards earl of Cornwal, who died young at
Perth; Jane, afterwards married to David Bruce, King
of Scotland; and Eleanor, married to Reginald, count of Gueldres.</P>

<P>THE violent party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XV.</NOTE> which had taken arms against
Edward II. and finally deposed that unhappy mo∣narch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Jan.</NOTE>
deemed it requisite for their future security to pay
so far an exterior obeisance to the law, as to demand a
parliamentary indemnity for all their illegal proceedings;
on account of the necessity; which, it was pretended,
they lay under, of employing force against the Spensers
and other evil counsellors, the enemies of the kingdom.
All the attainders also, which had passed against the earl
of Lancaster and his adherents, when the chance of war
turned against them, were easily reversed during the tri∣umph
of their party<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 245, 247, 258, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and the Spensers, whose former
attainder had been reversed by parliament, were now
again, in this change of fortune, condemned by the votes
of their enemies. A council of regency was likewise ap∣pointed
by parliament, consisting of twelve persons; five
prelates, the archbishops of Canterbury and York, the bi∣shops
<PB N="384" REF="413"/>
of Winchester, Worcester, and Hereford; and seven
lay peers, the earls of Norfolk, Kent and Surrey, and the
lords Wake, Ingham, Piercy, and Ross. The earl of Lan∣caster
was appointed guardian and protector of the King's
person. But though it was reasonable to expect, that, as
the weakness of the former King had given reins to the
licentiousness of the barons, great tranquillity would not
prevail during the present minority; the first disturbance
arose from the invasion of foreign enemies.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> declining in years and health,
but retaining still that martial spirit, which had raised his
nation from the lowest ebb of fortune, deemed the pre∣sent
opportunity favourable for infesting England: He
first made an attempt on the castle of Norham, in which
he was disappointed; he then collected an army of 25,000
men on the frontiers, and having appointed the earl of
Murray and lord Douglas generals, threatened an incur∣sion
into the northern counties. The English regency,
after trying in vain every expedient to restore peace with
Scotland, made vigorous preparations for war; and be∣sides
assembling an English army of near sixty thousand
men, they invited back John de Hainault, and some fo∣reign
cavalry, whom they had dismissed, and whose dis∣cipline
and arms had appeared superior to those of their own
country. Young Edward himself, burning with a passion
for military fame, appeared at the head of these numerous
forces; and marched from Durham, the appointed place
of rendevous, in quest of the enemy, who had already
broke into the frontiers, and were laying every thing
waste around them with fire and sword.</P>
<P>MURRAY and Douglas were the two most celebrated
warriors, bred in the long hostilities between the Scots
and English; and their forces, trained in the same school,
and enured to hardships, fatigues, and dangers, were
<PB N="385" REF="414"/>
perfectly qualified, by their habits and manner of life,
for that desultory and destrutive war, which they carried on
against the English. Except a body of about 4000 ca∣valry,
well armed, and fit to make a steddy impresson in
battle, the rest of the army were mounted on small horses,
which found subsistance every where, and carried them
with rapid and unexpected marches, whether they meant
to commit depredations on the peaceable inhabitants, or to
attack an armed enemy, or to retreat into their own country.
The whole equipage of the troops consisted of a bag of oat
meal, which, as a supply in case of necessity, each soldier
carried behind him; together with a light plate of iron, on
which he instantly baked the oat meal into a cake, in the
open fields. But his chief subsistance was the cattle which
he seized; and his cookery was as expeditious as all his
other operations. After fleaing the animal, he placed
the skin, loose and hanging in the form of a bag, upon
some stakes; he poured water into it, kindled a fire
below, and thus made it serve as a cauldron for the boil∣ing
of his victuals<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. iv. chap. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE chief difficulty, which Edward met with, after
composing some dangerous frays, which broke out be∣tween
his foreign forces and the English<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. i. chap. 17.</NOTE>, was to come
up with an enemy, so rapid in their marches, and so
little encumbered in their motions. Tho' the flame and
smoke of burning villages directed him sufficiently to the
place of their encampment, he found upon hurrying thi∣ther,
that they had already dislodged; and he loon disco∣vered,
by new marks of devastation, that they had re∣moved
to some distant quarter. After harrassing his
army during some time in this fruitless chace, he advanced
northwards, and crossed the Tyne, with a resolution of
awaiting them on their return homewards, and taking
<PB N="386" REF="415"/>
vengeance on them for all their depredations<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv iv. chap. 19.</NOTE>. But that
whole country was already so much wasted by their fre∣quent
incursions, that it could not afford subsistance to
his army; and he was obliged again to return south∣wards,
and change his plan of operations. He had now
lost all track of the enemy; and tho' he promised the re∣ward
of a hundred pounds a year to any one who should
bring him an account of their motions, he remained un∣active
some days, before he received any intelligence of
them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 312. Froissart, liv. iv. chap. 19.</NOTE>. He found at last, that they had fixed their camp
on the southern banks of the Were, as if they intended
to await a battle; but their prudent leaders had chosen
the ground with such judgment, that the English, on
their approach, found it impracticable, without temerity,
to cross the river in their face, and attack them in their
pressent situation. Edward, impatient for revenge and
glory, here sent them a defiance, and challenged them,
if they dared, to meet him in an equal field, and try the
fortune of arms. The bold spirit of Douglas could ill
brook this bravade, and he advised the acceptance of the
challenge; but he was over-ruled by Murray, who re∣plied
to Edward, that he never took the council of an
enemy in any of his operations. The King, therefore,
kept still his position opposite to them; and expected
daily, that necessity would oblige them to change their
quarters, and give him an opportunity of overwhelming
them with his superior forces. After a few days, they
suddenly decamped, and marched farther up the river;
but still posted themselves in such a manner, as to pre∣serve
the advantage of the ground, if the enemy should
venture to attack them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. iv. chap. 19.</NOTE>. Edward insisted, that all ha∣zards
should be run, rather than allow these ravagers to
<PB N="387" REF="416"/>
escape with impunity; but Mortimer's authority pre∣vented
the assault, and opposed itself to the valour of the
young monarch. While the armies lay in this position,
an incident happened which had well nigh proved fatal
to the English. Douglas, having got the word, and
surveyed exactly the situation of the English camp, en∣tered
it secretly in the night time, with a body of two
hundred determined soldiers, and advanced to the royal
tent, with a view of killing or carrying off the prince,
in the midst of his whole army. But some of Edward's
attendants, awaking in that critical moment, made re∣sistance;
his chaplain and chamberlain sacrificed their
lives for his safety; the King himself, after making a
valiant defence, escaped in the dark: And Douglas,
having lost the greatest part of his followers, was glad to
make a hasty retreat with the remainder<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. iv. chap. 19. Hemingford, p. 268. Ypod. Neust. p. 509. Knyghton, p. 2552.</NOTE>. Soon after,
the Scottish army decamped without noise in the dead of
night; and having thus got the start of the English,
arrived without farther loss in their own country. Ed∣ward,
on entering the place of the Scottish encampment,
found only six Englishmen, whom the enemy, after
breaking their legs, had tied to trees, in order to pre∣vent
their carrying any intelligence to their country∣men<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. iv. chap. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King was highly incensed at the disappointment,
which he had met with, in his first enterprize, and at the
head of so gallant an army. The symptoms, which he
had discovered of bravery and spirit, gave extreme satis∣fation,
and were regarded as sure prognostics of an il∣lustrious
reign: But the general displeasure fell violently
on Mortimer, who was already the object of public
odium: And every measure which he pursued, tended to
<PB N="388" REF="417"/>
aggravate, beyond all bounds, the hatred of the nation
both against him and Queen Isabella.</P>
<P>WHEN the council of regency was formed, Mortimer,
though in the plenitude of his power, had taken no care
to ensure a place in it; but this semblance of moderation
was only a cover to the most exorbitant and most ambi∣tious
projects. He rendered that council entirely useless
by usurping to himself the whole sovereign power; he
settled on the Queen-dowager the greater part of the
royal revenues; he never consulted either the princes
of the blood or the other noblemen in any public mea∣sure;
the King himself was so besieged by his creatures,
that no access could be procured to him; and all
the envy, which had attended Gavaston and Spenser, fell
much more deservedly on this new favourite.</P>
<P>MORTIMER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1328.</NOTE> sensible of the growing hatred of the
people, thought it requisite, on any terms, to secure
peace abroad; and he entered into a negociation with
Robert Bruce for that purpose. As the claim of supe∣riority
in England, more than any other cause, had
tended to inflame the animosities between the two nations,
Mortimer consented to resign absolutely this pretension,
to give up all the homages done by the Scottish parlia∣ment
and nobility, and to acknowledge Robert as sove∣reign
of Scotland<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, p. 337. Heming. p. 270. Anon. Hist. p. 392.</NOTE>. In return for these mighty ad∣vantages,
Robert only stipulated the payment of 30,000
marks to England. This treaty was ratified by parlia∣ment<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 510.</NOTE>;
but was nevertheless the source of great discon∣tent
among the people, who, having entered zealously
into the pretensions of Edward I. and deeming them∣selves
disgraced by the successful resistance of so inferior
<PB N="389" REF="418"/>
a nation, were disappointed by this treaty, in all future
hopes both of conquest and of vengeance.</P>
<P>THE princes of the blood, Kent, Norfolk, and Lan∣caster,
were very much united in their councils; and
Mortimer entertained great suspicions of their designs
against him. In summoning them to parliament, he
strictly prohibited them, in the King's name, from being
attended with an armed force, an illegal but usual prac∣tice
in that age. The three earls, as they approached to
Salisbury, the place appointed for the meeting of par∣liament,
found, that, tho' they themselves, in obedience
to the King's command, had brought only their usual
retinue along with them, Mortimer and his party were
attended with all their followers in arms; and they be∣gan
with some reason to apprehend a dangerous design
against their persons. They therefore retreated, assem∣bled
their retainers, and were returning with an army to
take vengeance on Mortimer, when the weakness of
Kent and Norfolk, who deserted the common cause,
obliged Lancaster also to make his submissions<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2554.</NOTE>. The
quarrel, by the interposition of the prelates, seemed for
the present to be appeased.</P>
<P>BUT Mortimer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1329.</NOTE> in order to intimidate the princes, de∣termined
to have a victim; and the simplicity, with the
good intentions of the earl of Kent, afforded him soon
after an opportunity of practising upon him. By himself
and his emissaries, he endeavoured to persuade that prince,
that his brother, King Edward, was still alive, and con∣cealed
in some secret prison in England. The earl, whose
remorses for the part which he had acted against the late
King, probably inclined him to give credit to this intelli∣gence,
entered into a design of restoring him to liberty,
of re-instating him on the throne, and thereby of making
<PB N="390" REF="419"/>
some compensation for the injuries he had unwarily done
him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Avesbury, p. 8. Anon. Hist. p. 395.</NOTE>. After this innocent contrivance had been al∣lowed
to proceed a certain length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1330.</NOTE> the earl was seized
by Mortimer, was accused before the parliament, and
condemned by these slavish, tho' turbulent barons, to
lose his life and fortune.<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th March. Execution of the earl of Kent.</NOTE> The queen and Mortimer,
apprehensive of young Edward's lenity towards his uncle,
hurried on the execution, and the prisoner was beheaded
next day: But so general was the affection borne the
earl, and such pity prevailed for his hard fate, that, tho'
peers had been easily found, to condemn him, it was
evening before his enemies could find an executioner to
perform the office<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 271. Ypod. Neust. p. 510. Knyghton, p. 2555.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE earl of Lancaster, on pretence of his assent to
this conspiracy, was soon after thrown into prison: Many
others of the prelates and nobility were prosecuted: Mor∣timer
employed this engine to crush all his enemies, and
enrich himself and his family by the forfeitures. The
estate of the earl of Kent was seized for his younger son,
Geoffrey: The immense fortunes of the Spensers and
their adherents were mostly converted to his own use:
He affected a state and dignity equal or superior to the
royal: His power became formidable to every one: His
illegal practices were daily complained of: And all par∣ties,
forgetting former animosities, conspired in their ha∣tred
against Mortimer.</P>
<P>IT was impossible, that these abuses could long escape
the observation of a prince, endowed with so much spirit
and judgment as young Edward, who being now in his
eighteenth year, and feeling himself capable of govern∣ment,
repined at being held in fetters by this insolent
minister. But so much was he surrounded with the
<PB N="391" REF="420"/>
emissaries of Mortimer, that it behoved him to conduct
the project for subverting him, with the same secrecy and
precaution, as if he had been forming a conspiracy against
his sovereign. He communicated his intentions to the
lord Mountacute, who engaged the lords Molins and
Clifford, sir John Nevil of Hornby, sir Edward Bohun,
Ufford, and others, to enter into their views; and the
castle of Nottingham was chosen for the scene of the en∣terprize.
The Queen-dowager and Mortimer lodged in
that fortress: The King also was admitted, tho' with a
few only of his attendants: And as the castle was strictly
guarded, the gates locked every evening, and the keys
carried to the Queen, it became necessary to communi∣cate
the design to sir William Eland, the governor, who
entered zealously into it. By his direction, the King's
associates were admitted thro' a subterraneous passage,
which had been formerly contrived for a secret outlet to
the castle, but was now buried in rubbish; and Morti∣mer,
without having it in his power to make resistance,
was suddenly seized in an apartment adjoining to the
Queen's<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Avesbury, p. 9.</NOTE>. A parliament was immediately called for his
trial. He was accused before that assembly of having
usurped regal power from the council of regency, ap∣pointed
by parliament; of having procured the death of
the late King; of having deceived the earl of Kent into
a conspiracy to restore that prince; of having solicited
and obtained exorbitant grants of the royal demesnes;
of having dissipated the public treasure; of secreting for
his own use 20,000 marks of the money paid by the
King of Scotland; and of other crimes and misdemea∣nours<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Brady's App. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 83. Anon. Hist. p. 397, 398. Knyghton, p. 2556.</NOTE>.
The parliament condemned him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of Morti∣mer. 29th Nov.</NOTE> from the
supposed notoriety of the facts, without trial, or hearing
his answer, or examining a witness; and he was hanged
<PB N="392" REF="421"/>
on a gibbet at the Elmes, in the neighbourhood of Lon∣don.
It is remarkable, that this sentence was near twenty
years after reversed by parliament, in favour of Mortimer's
son; and the reason assigned was the illegal form of the
proceedings<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 85, 86.</NOTE>. The principles of law and justice were
established in England, not in such a degree as to prevent
any iniquitous sentence against a person obnoxious to
the ruling party; but sufficient, on the return of his
credit, or that of his friends, to serve as a reason or pre∣tence
for its reversal.</P>
<P>JUSTICE was also executed by a sentence of the house of
peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1331.</NOTE> on some of the inferior criminals, particularly on Si∣mon
de Bereford: But the barons, in that case, entered a
protest, that, tho' they had tried Bereford, who was none of
their peers, they should not for the future be obliged to
receive any such indictment. The Queen was confined
to her own house at Risings near London: Her revenue
was reduced to 4000 pounds a year<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 10.</NOTE>: And tho' the King,
during the remainder of her life, paid her a decent visit
once or twice a year, she never was able to reinstate
herself in any credit or authority.</P>
<P>EDWARD, having now taken the reins of govern∣ment
into his own hands, applied himself, with industry
and judgment, to redress all those grievances, which had
either proceeded from want of authority in the crown,
or from the late abuses of it. He issued writs to the
judges, enjoining them to administer justice, without
paying any regard to arbitrary orders from the ministers:
And as the robbers, thieves, murderers, and criminals of
all kinds, had, during the course of public convulsions,
multiplied to an enormous degree, and were openly pro∣tected
by the great barons, who made use of them against
<PB N="393" REF="422"/>
their enemies, the King, after exacting from the
peers a solemn promise in parliament, that they would
break off all connexions with such malefactors<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg.</NOTE>, set
himself in earnest to remedy the evil. Many of these
gangs had become so numerous, as to require his own
presence to dissipate them; and he exerted both courage
and industry in executing this salutary office. The mi∣nisters
of justice, from his example, employed the utmost
diligence in discovering, pursuing, and punishing the
criminals; and this disorder was by degrees corrected, or
at least palliated; the utmost that could be expected with
regard to a disease, inherent in the constitution.</P>
<P>IN proportion as the government acquired authority at
home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Scotland.</NOTE> it became formidable to the neighbouring nations;
and the ambitious spirit of Edward sought, and soon
found, an opportunity of exerting itself. The wise and
valiant Robert Bruce, who had recovered by arms the in∣dependancy
of his country, and had fixed it by the last
treaty of peace with England, soon after died, and left
David his son, a minor, under the guardianship of Ran∣dolf,
earl of Murray, the companion of all his victories.
It had been stipulated in this treaty, that both the Scot∣tish
nobility, who, before the commencement of the
wars, enjoyed lands in England, and the English who
inherited estates in Scotland, should be restored to their
several possessions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 384.</NOTE>: But tho' this article had been exe∣cuted
pretty regularly on the part of Edward, Robert,
who saw the estates claimed by Englishmen much more
numerous and valuable than the other, either esteemed
it dangerous to admit so many secret enemies into the
kingdom, or found it difficult to wrest from his own fol∣lowers
the possessions bestowed on them as the reward of
their fatigues and dangers: And he had protracted the
performance of his part of the stipulation. The English
<PB N="394" REF="423"/>
nobles, disappointed in their expectations, began to think
of a remedy; and as their influence was great in the
north, their enmity alone, even tho' unsupported by the
King of England, became dangerous to the minor prince,
who succeeded to the Scottish throne.</P>
<P>EDWARD BALIOL,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1332.</NOTE> the son of that John, who was
crowned King of Scotland, had been detained some time
a prisoner in England after his father was released; but
having also obtained his liberty, he went over to France,
and lived in Normandy, on his patrimonial estate in
that country, without any thoughts of reviving the
claims of his family upon the crown of Scotland. His
pretensions, however plausible, had been so strenuously
abjured by the Scots, and rejected by the English, that
he was entirely regarded as a private person; and he had
been thrown into prison on account of some private of∣fence
against the laws, of which he was accused. The
lord Beaumont, a great English baron, who in the right
of his wife claimed the earldom of Buchan in Scotland<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 251.</NOTE>,
found him in this situation; and deeming him a proper
instrument for his purpose, made such interest with the
King of France, who was not aware of the consequen∣ces,
that he recovered him his liberty, and brought him
over with him into England.</P>
<P>THE injured nobles, possessed of such a head, began
now to think of vindicating their rights by force of
arms; and they applied to Edward for his concurrence
and assistance. But there were several reasons, which
deterred the King from openly avowing their enterprize.
In his treaty with Scotland, he had entered into a bond
of 20,000 pounds, payable to the Pope, if within four
years he violated the peace; and as the term was not
yet elapsed, he dreaded the exacting of that penalty, by
<PB N="395" REF="424"/>
the sovereign pontiff, who possessd so many means of
forcing him to make payment. He was also afraid,
that violence and injustice would every where be im∣puted
to him, if he attacked with such superior force a
minor King, and a brother-in-law, whose independent
title had so lately been acknowledged by a solemn treaty.
And as the regent of Scotland, on every demand which
had been made, of restitution to the English barons,
had always confessed the justice of their claim, and
had only given an evasive answer, grounded on plausible
pretences, Edward resolved not to proceed to open vio∣lence,
but to employ like artifices against him. He se∣cretly
encouraged Baliol in his enterprize; connived at
his assembling forces in the north; and gave countenance
to the nobles, who were disposed to join in the attempt.
A force of near 2500 men was inlisted under Baliol, by
Umfreville earl of Angus, the lords Beaumont, Ferrars,
Fitz-warin, Wake, Stafford, Talbot, and Moubray.
And as these adventurers apprehended that the frontiers
would be strongly armed and guarded, they resolved to
make their attack by sea; and having embarked at Ra∣venspur,
they reached in a few days the coast of Fife.</P>
<P>SCOTLAND was at present in a very different situation
from that in which it had appeared under the victorious
Robert. Besides the loss of that great monarch, whose
genius and authority preserved entire the whole poli∣tical
fabric, and maintained an union among the unruly
barons, lord Douglas, impatient of rest, had gone over
to Spain in a crusade against the Moors, and had there
perished in battle<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 21.</NOTE>: The earl of Murray, who had been
long declining in age and infirmities, had lately died,
and had been succeeded in the regency by Donald earl
of Marre, a man of much inferior talents: The mili∣tary
spirit of the Scots, tho' still unbroken, was left
<PB N="396" REF="425"/>
without a proper guidance and direction: And a minor
King seemed ill qualified to defend an inheritance,
which it had required all the consummate valour and
abilities of his father to acquire and maintain. But as
the Scots were apprized of the intended invasion, great
numbers, on the appearance of the English fleet, imme∣diately
ran to the shore, in order to prevent the landing
of the enemy. Baliol had valour and activity, and he
repulsed the Scots with a considerable loss<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 272. Walsing. p. 131. Knyghton, p. 2560.</NOTE>. He marched
westward into the heart of the country; flattering him∣self
that the antient partizans of his family would de∣clare
for him. But the fierce animosity, which had
been kindled between the two nations, inspiring the
Scots with a strong prejudice against a prince who was
supported by the English, he was regarded as a common
enemy; and the regent found no difficulty in assembling
a great army to oppose him. It is pretended, that Marre
had no less than 40,000 men under his standard; but
the same hurry and impatience, that made him collect
a force, which from its greatness was so disproportioned
to the occasion, rendered all his motions unskilful and
imprudent. The river Erne ran between the two armies;
and the Scots, confiding in that security, as well as in
their great superiority of numbers, kept no order in
their encampment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th Aug.</NOTE> Baliol passed the river in the night
time; attacked the unguarded and undisciplined Scots;
threw them into confusion, which was encreased by the
darkness and by their very numbers to which they
trusted; and he beat them off the field with great
slaughter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2561.</NOTE>. But in the morning, when the Scots were
at some distance, they were ashamed of having yielded
the victory to so weak a foe, and they hurried back to
recover the honour of the day. Their eager passions
<PB N="397" REF="426"/>
carried them precipitately to battle, without regard to
some broken ground, which lay between them and the
enemy, and which disordered and confounded their
ranks. Baliol seized the favourable opportunity, ad∣vanced
his troops upon them, prevented them from ral∣lying,
and chaced them anew off the field with redoubled
slaughter. There fell above 12,000 Scots in this action;
and among these the flower of their nobility; the re∣gent
himself, the earl of Carric, a natural son of their
late King, the earls of Athole and Monteith, the lord
Hay of Errol, constable, and the lords Keith and Lind∣sey.
The loss of the English scarce exceeded thirty
men; a strong proof, among many others, of the miser∣able
state of military discipline in those ages<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 273. Walsingham, p. 131. Knyghton, p. 2561.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BALIOL soon after made himself master of Perth;
but still was not able to bring over any of the Scots to
his party. Patric Dunbar, earl of Marche, and Sir
Archibald Douglas, brother to the lord of that name,
appeared at the head of the Scottish armies, which
amounted still to near 40,000 men; and they proposed to
reduce Baliol and the English by famine. They in∣vested
Perth by land; they collected some vessels with
which they blockaded it by water: But Baliol's ships
attacking the Scottish fleet, gained a compleat victory
over them; and opened the communication to Perth by
sea<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 273. Knyghton, p. 2561.</NOTE>. It then behoved the Scots armies to disperse
themselves for want of pay and subsistance: The nation
was in effect subdued by a handful of men: Each no∣bleman,
who found himself most exposed to danger,
successively submitted to Baliol:<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th Septr.</NOTE> That prince was crown∣ed
King at Scone: David, his competitor, was sent
over to France with his betrothed wife, Jane, sister to
Edward: And the heads of his party sued to Baliol for
<PB N="398" REF="427"/>
a truce, which he granted them, in order to assemble
a parliament in tranquillity, and have his title recog∣nized
by the whole Scottish nation.</P>
<P>BUT Baliol's imprudence or his necessities making him
dismiss the greatest part of his English followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1333.</NOTE> he was,
notwithstanding the truce, attacked of a sudden near
Annan by Sir Archibald Douglas, and other chieftains
of that party; he was routed; his brother John Baliol
was slain; he himself was chaced into England in a mi∣serable
condition; and thus lost his kingdom by a revo∣lution
as quick as that by which he had acquired it.</P>
<P>WHILE Baliol enjoyed his short-liv'd and precarious
royalty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> he had been sensible, that without the protect∣tion
of England, it would be impossible for him to
maintain possession of the throne; and he had secretly
sent a message to Edward, offering to acknowledge his
superiority, to renew the homage for his crown,
and to espouse the princess Jane, if the Pope's
consent could be obtained, for dissolving her former
marriage, which was not yet consummated. Edward,
ambitious of recovering that important sacrifice,
made by Mortimer during his minority, threw off all scruples,
and willingly accepted the offer; but as the dethrone∣ment
of Baliol had rendered this concession of no ef∣fect,
the King prepared to re-instate him in possession of
the crown; an enterprize, which appeared from late
experience so easy and so little hazardous. As he pos∣sessed
many popular arts, he consulted his parliament
on this occasion; but that assembly, finding the resolution
already taken, declined giving any opinion, and only
supplied him, in order to support the enterprize, with
an aid of a fifteenth, from the personal estates of the
nobility and gentry, and a tenth of the moveables of
boroughs. And they added a petition, that the King
<PB N="399" REF="428"/>
would thenceforth live of his own, without grieving his
subjects by illegal taxes, or by the outrageous seizure of
their goods in the shape of purveyance<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridgm.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS the Scots expected, that the chief brunt of the
war would fall upon Berwic, Douglas, the regent,
threw a strong garrison into that place under the com∣mand
of Sir William Keith, and he himself assembled
a great army on the frontiers, ready to penetrate into
England, so soon as Edward should have invested that
fortress. The English army was lets numerous; but
better supplied with arms and provisions, and retained
in stricter discipline; and the King, notwithstanding
the valiant defence of Keith, had in two months time
reduced the garrison to extremity, and had obliged them
to capitulate. They engaged to surrender the place, if
they were not relieved within a few days by their coun∣trymen<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 564, 565, 566.</NOTE>.
This intelligence, being conveyed to the
Scottish army, which was preparing to invade Northum∣berland,
changed their whole plan of operations, and
engaged them to advance towards Berwic, and attempt
the relief of that important place. Douglas, who had
ever proposed to decline a pitched battle, in which he
was sensible of the enemy's superiority, and who intended
to have drawn out the war by small skirmishes, and by
mutually ravaging each others country, was forced, by
the impatience of his troops, to put the whole fate of
the kingdom upon the event of one day. He attacked
the English at Halidown-hill, a little north of Berwic;<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th July.</NOTE>
and tho' the Scottish <HI>Gens d' armes</HI> dismounted from their
horses, in order to render the action more steady and
desperate, they were received with such valour by Edward,
and were so galled by the English archers, that they
were soon thrown into disorder, and on the fall of
Douglas, their general, were put to absolute rout. The
<PB N="400" REF="429"/>
whole army fled in confusion, and the English, but
much more the Irish, gave little quarter in the pursuit:
All the nobles of chief distinction were either slain or
taken prisoners: Near thirty thousand of the Scots fell
in the action: While the loss of the English amounted
only to one knight, one, esquire, and thirteen private
soldiers: An inequality almost incredible<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Heming, p. 275, 276, 277. Knyghton, p. 2559. Otterborne, p. 115.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this fatal blow, the Scottish nobles had no
other resource but instant submission; and Edward,
leaving a considerable body with Baliol to compleat
the conquest of the kingdom, returned with the re∣mainder
of his army into England. Baliol was ac∣knowledged
King by a parliament assembled at Edin∣burgh<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 590.</NOTE>;
the superiority of England was again recognized;
many of the Scots nobility swore fealty to him; and to
compleat the misfortunes of that nation, Baliol ceded to
Edward Berwic, Dunbar, Roxborough, Edinburgh, and
all the south-east counties of Scotland, which were de∣clared
to be for ever annexed to the English monarchy<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 614.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF Baliol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1334.</NOTE> on his first appearance, was dreaded by the
Scots, as an instrument employed by England for the
subjection of the kingdom, this deed confirmed all their
suspicions, and rendered him the object of universal ha∣tred.
Whatever submissions they might be obliged to
make, they considered him, not as their prince, but as
the delegate and confederate of their determined enemy;
and neither the manners of the age; nor the state of
Edward's revenue permitting him to maintain a con∣stant
standing army in Scotland, the English forces were
no sooner withdrawn, than the Scots revolted against
Baliol, and returned to their former allegiance under
Bruce. Sir Andrew Murray, appointed regent by the
<PB N="401" REF="430"/>
party of this latter prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1335.</NOTE> employed with success his
valour and activity in many small but decisive actions
against Baliol; and in a short time had almost wholly
expelled him the kingdom. Edward was obliged again
to assemble an army and to march into Scotland:
The Scots, taught by experience, withdrew into their
hills and fastnesses: He destroyed the houses, and ravaged
the estates of those whom he called rebels: But this con∣firmed
them still farther in their obstinate antipathy to
England and to Baliol; and being now rendered despe∣rate,
they were ready to take advantage, on the first op∣portunity,
of the retreat of their enemy, and they soon
re-conquered their country from the English.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1336.</NOTE> Edward
made anew his appearance in Scotland with like success:
He found every thing hostile in the kingdom, except the
spot on which he was encamped: And tho' he marched
uncontrouled over all the low countries, the nation itself
was farther than ever from being broken and subdued.
Besides being supported by their pride and anger, pas∣sions
difficult to tame, they were encouraged, amidst all
their calamities, by daily promises of relief from France;
and as a war was now likely to break out between that
kingdom and England, they had reason to expect from
this incident a great diversion of that force, which had
so long oppressed and overwhelmed them.</P>
<P>WE now come to a transaction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1337.</NOTE> on which depended
the most memorable events,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's claim to the crown of France.</NOTE> not only of this long and
active reign, but of the whole English and French his∣tory,
during more than a century; and it will therefore
be necessary to give a particular account of the springs
and causes of it. It had long been a prevailing opinion
that the crown of France could never descend to females;
and as nations, in accounting for principles, which they
regard as fundamental and as peculiar to themselves,
are fond of grounding them rather on primary laws,
<PB N="402" REF="431"/>
than on blind custom, it had been usual to derive this
maxim from a, clause in the Salian Code, the law of
an antient tribe among the Franks; tho' that clause,
when strictly examined, carries only the appearance of
favouring this principle, and does not really, by the
confession of the best critics, bear the sense commonly
imposed upon it. But tho' positive law seems wanting
among the French for the exclusion of females, the
practice had prevailed; and the rule was established be∣yond
controversy on some antient as well as some mo∣dern
precedents. During the first race of the monarchy,
the Franks were so rude and barbarous a people, that
they were incapable of submitting to a female reign;
and in that period of their history, there were frequent
instances of kings advanced to royalty in prejudice of
females, who were related to the crown by nearer de∣grees
of consanguinity. These precedents, joined to
like causes, had also established the male succession in
the second races; and tho' the instances were neither so
frequent nor so certain during that period, the principle
of excluding the female line seems still to have prevailed,
and to have directed the conduct of the nation. During
the third race, the crown had descended from father to
son for eleven generations, from Hugh Capet to Lewis
Hutin; and thus, in fact, during the course of nine
hundred years, the French monarchy had always been
governed by males, and no female and none descended
of females had ever mounted the throne. Philip the Fair,
father of Lewis Hutin, left three sons, this Lewis, Phi∣lip
the Long, and Charles the Fair, and one daughter,
Isabella, queen of England. Lewis Hutin, the eldest,
left at his death one daughter, by Margaret sister to
Eudes, duke of Burgundy; and as his queen was then
pregnant, Philip, his younger brother, was appointed
regent, till it should appear whether the child should
<PB N="403" REF="432"/>
prove a son or a daughter. Her issue proved male, but
lived only a few days: Philip was proclaimed King:
And as the duke of Burgundy made some opposition,
and asserted the rights of his niece, the states of the
kingdom, by a solemn and deliberate decree, gave her
the exclusion, and declared all females for ever incapable
of succeeding to the crown of France. Philip died
after a short reign, leaving three daughters; and his
brother, Charles, without dispute or controversy, then
succeeded to the crown. The reign of Charles was
also short: He left one daughter; but as his queen
was pregnant, the next male heir was appointed regent,
with a declared right of succession, if the issue should
prove female. This prince was Philip de Valois, cousin
german to the deceased King; being the son of Charles
de Valois, brother of Philip the Fair. The queen of
France was delivered of a daughter: The regency
ended; and Philip de Valois was unanimously placed on
the throne of France.</P>
<P>THE King of England, who was at that time a youth
of fifteen years of age, embraced a notion, that he was
intitled, in right of his mother, to the succession of the
kingdom, and that the claim of the nephew was prefer∣able
to that of the cousin german. There could not
well be conceived a notion weaker or worse grounded.
The principle of excluding females was of old an esta∣blished
opinion in France, and had acquired equal au∣thority
with the most express and positive law: It was
supported by antient precedents: It was confirmed by
recent instances, solemnly and deliberately decided: And
what placed it still farther beyond controversy; if Ed∣ward
was disposed to question its validity, he thereby cut
off his own pretensions; since the three last Kings had
all left daughters, who were still alive, and who stood
before him in the order of succession. He was there∣fore
reduced to assert, that, tho' his mother, Isabella,
<PB N="404" REF="433"/>
was, on account of her sex, incapable of succession, he
himself, who inherited thro' her, was liable to no such
objection, and might claim by the right of propinquity.
But, besides that this pretension was more favourable to
Charles, King of Navarre, descended from the daughter
of Lewis Hutin, it was so contrary to the established
principles of succession in every country of Europe<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 4.</NOTE>,
was so repugnant to the practice both in private and
public inheritances, that no body in France thought of
Edward's right: Philip's title was universally recog∣nized
and acknowledged<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>: And he never imagined,
that he had a competitor; much less, so formidable a
one as the King of England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the youthful and ambitious mind of Edward
had rashly entertained this notion, he did not think pro∣per
to insist on his pretensions, which must have imme∣diately
involved him, on very unequal terms, in a dan∣gerous
and implacable war with so powerful a monarch.
Philip was a prince of mature years, of great expe∣rience,
and at that time of an established character both
for prudence and valour; and by these circumstances,
as well as by the union of his people, and their ac∣quiescence
in his undoubted right, he possessed every ad∣vantage
over a raw youth, newly raised, by injustice and
violence, to the government of the most intractable and
most turbulent subjects in Europe. But there immedi∣ately
occurred an incident, which required, that Ed∣ward
should either openly declare his pretensions, or for
ever renounce and abjure them. He was summoned to
do homage for Guienne: Philip was preparing to com∣pel
him by force of arms: That country was in a very
bad state of defence: And the forfeiture of so rich an
inheritance was, by the feudal law, the immediate con∣sequence
<PB N="405" REF="434"/>
of his refusing or declining to perform the duty
of a vassal. Edward therefore thought it prudent to
submit to present necessity: He went over to Amiens:
Did homage to Philip: And as there had arisen some
controversy concerning the terms of this submission, he
afterwards sent over a formal deed, in which he acknow∣ledged
that he owed liege homage to France<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 477, 481. Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 25. Anon. Hist. p. 394. Walsingham, p. 130. Murimuth, p. 73.</NOTE>; which
was in effect ratifying, and that in the strongest terms,
Philip's title to the crown of that kingdom. His own
claim indeed was so unreasonable, and so thoroughly dis∣avowed
by the whole French nation, that to insist on it
was no better than to pretend to the entire conquer of
the kingdom; and it is probable that he would never
have farther thought of it, had it not been for some inci∣dents,
which excited an animosity between the two monarchs.</P>
<P>ROBERT D'ARTOIS was descended of the royal blood
of France, was a man of great character and authority,
had espoused Philip's sister, and by his birth, talents,
and credit was entitled to make the highest figure, and
to fill the most important offices, in the monarchy.
This prince had lost the county of Artois, which he
claimed as his birthright, by a sentence, commonly
deemed iniquitous, of Philip the Fair; and he was
seduced to attempt the recovering possession by an
action, so unworthy of his rank and character as a forgery<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv, 1. Chap. 29.</NOTE>. The detection of this crime covered him
with shame and confusion: His brother-in-law not only
abandoned him, but prosecuted him with violence:
Robert, incapable of bearing disgrace, left the kingdom,
and hid himself in the Low Countries: Being chaced
from that retreat, by the authority of Philip, he came
<PB N="406" REF="435"/>
over to England; in spite of the French King's me∣naces
and remonstrances, he was favourably received by
Edward<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 747. Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 27.</NOTE>; and was soon admitted into the councils and
shared the confidence of that monarch. Abandoning
himself to all the movements of rage and despair, he en∣deavoured
to revive the prepossessions entertained by
Edward in favour of his title to the crown of France,
and even flattered him, that it was not impossible for a
prince of his valour and abilities, to render his claim ef∣fectual.
The King was the more disposed to hearken
to suggestions of this nature, because he had, in several
particulars, complaints against Philip's conduct with re∣gard
to Guienne, and because that prince had both given
protection to the exiled David Bruce, and supported, or
at lean encouraged the Scots in their struggles for inde∣pendancy.
Thus resentment gradually filled the breasts
of both the monarchs, and made them incapable of
hearkening to any terms of accommodation, proposed by
the Pope, who never ceased interposing his good offices
between them. Philip thought, that he would be
wanting to the first principles of policy, if he abandoned
Scotland: Edward pretended, that he must relinquish all
pretensions to generosity, if he withdrew his protection
from Robert d'Artois. The former, informed of some
preparations for hostilities, which had been made by his
rival, issued a sentence of felony and forfeiture against
Robert d'Artois, and declared, that every vassal of the
crown, whether <HI>within</HI> or <HI>without</HI> the kingdom, who
gave countenance to that traitor, was involved in the same
sentence; a menace easy to be understood: The latter,
resolute not to yield, endeavoured to form alliances in
the Low Countries and on the frontiers of Germany,
the only places from which he either could make an ef∣fectual
attack upon France, or produce such a diversion
<PB N="407" REF="436"/>
as might save the province of Guienne, which lay so
much exposed to the power of Philip.</P>
<P>THE King began with opening his intentions to the
count of Hainault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions for war with France.</NOTE> his father-in-law; and having en∣gaged
him in his interests, he employed the good offices
and councils of that prince in drawing into his alliance
the other sovereigns of that neighbourhood. The duke
of Brabant was induced, by his mediation, and by large
remittances of money from England, to promise his
concurrence<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 777.</NOTE>: The archbishop of Cologn, the duke of
Guelders, the marquis of Juliers, the count of Namur,
the lords of Fauquemont and Baquen, were engaged by
like motives to embrace the English alliance<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 4. chap. 29, 33, 36.</NOTE>. These
sovereigns could supply, either from their own states or
from the bordering countries, great numbers of warlike
troops; and nought was wanting to make the force on
that quarter very formidable but the accession of
Flanders; which Edward procured by means somewhat
extraordinary and unusual.</P>
<P>AS the Flemings were the first people in the northern
parts of Europe, who cultivated arts and manufactures,
the lower ranks of men in that province had risen to a de∣gree
of riches unknown elsewhere to those of their sta∣tion
in that barbarous age, had acquired privileges and
independance, and began to emerge from that state of vas∣salage,
or rather of slavery, into which the common peo∣ple
had been universally thrown by the feudal institu∣tions.
It was probably difficult for them to bring their
sovereign and their nobility to conform themselves to the
principles of law and civil government, so much ne∣glected
in every other country: It was impossible for them
to confine themselves within the proper bounds in their
opposition and resentment against any instance of ty∣ranny:
<PB N="408" REF="437"/>
They had risen in tumults: Had insulted the no∣bles:
Had chaced their earl into France: And deliver∣ing
themselves over to the guidance of a seditious leader,
had practised all those insolences, and disorders, which
the thoghtless and enraged populace are so much in∣clined
to commit, wherever they are so unfortunate as
to be their own masters<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 30. Meyerus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEIR present leader was James d' Arteville, a brewer
in Ghent, who governed them with a more absolute
sway than ever had been assumed by any of their lawful
sovereigns: He placed and displaced the magistrates at
his pleasure: He was accompanied with a guard, who on
the least signal from him, instantly assassinated any man
who happened to fall under his displeasure: All the cities
of Flanders were full of his spies; and it was immedi∣ate
death to give him the smallest umbrage: The few
nobles, who remained in the country, lived in continual
terror of his violence: He seized the estates of all those
whom he had either banished or murdered; and bestow∣ing
a part on their wives and children, converted the re∣mainder
to his own use<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 30.</NOTE>. Such were the first effects,
which Europe saw, of popular violence; after having
groaned, during so many centuries, under monarchical
and aristocratical tyranny.</P>
<P>JAMES D' ARTEVILLE was the man, to whom Edward
applied himself for bringing over the Flemings to his in∣terest;
and that prince, the most haughty and most as∣piring
of his age, never courted any ally with so much
assiduity and so many submissions, as he employed to∣wards
this seditions and criminal mechanic. D'Arteville,
proud of these advances from the King of England, and
sensible, that the Flemings were naturally inclined to
<PB N="409" REF="438"/>
maintain connexions with the English, who furnished
them the materials of their woollen manufactures, the
chief source of their opulence, readily embraced the in∣terests
of Edward, and invited him over into the Low
Countries. Edward, before he entered on this great en∣terprize,
affected to consult his parliament, asked their
advice, and obtained their consent<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg.</NOTE>. And the more
to strengthen his hands, he obtained from them a grant
of 20,000 sacks of wool; which might amount to
above a hundred thousand pounds: This wool was a
good instrument to employ, with the Fleming; and the
price of it with his German allies. He compleated the
other necessary sums by loans, by pawning the crown
jewels, by confiscating or rather robbing at once all the
Lombards, who now exercised the invidious trade, for∣merly
monopolized by the Jews, of lending on interest<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Baron. vol. ii. p. 146.</NOTE>;
and being attended with a body of English forces, and
with several of his nobility, he sailed over into Flanders.</P>
<P>THE German princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1338.</NOTE> in order to justify their unpro∣voked
hostilities against France, had required the sanc∣tion
of some legal authority; and Edward, that he
might give them satisfaction on this head, had applied
to Lewis of Bavaria, then emperor, and had been
created by him <HI>vicar of the empire;</HI> an empty title, but
which seemed to give him a right of commanding the
service of the princes of Germany<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1, chap. 35.</NOTE>. The Flemings,
who were vassals of France, pretending like scruples
with regard to the invasion of their liege lord; Edward,
by the advice of d'Arteville, assumed, in his commis∣sions,
the title of King of France, and, by virtue of
this right, challenged their assistance for dethroning Philip
de Valois, the usurper of his kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heming, p. 303. Wal∣singham, p. 143.</NOTE>. This step,
<PB N="410" REF="439"/>
which, he feared, would destroy all future amity between
the kingdoms, and beget endless and implacable jealou∣sies
in France, was not taken by him without much re∣luctance
and hesitation: And as it was not in itself very
justifiable, it was in the issue attended with many mise∣ries
to both nations. From this period we may date the
commencement of that great animosity, which the Eng∣lish
have ever since borne to the French, which has
so visible an influence on all future transactions, and
which has been, and continues to be the spring of many
rash and precipitate resolutions among them. In all
the preceding reigns since the conquest, the hostilities
between the two crowns had been only casual and tem∣porary;
and never being attended with any bloody or
dangerous events, the traces of them were easily oblite∣rated
by the first treaty of pacification. The English
nobility and gentry valued themselves on their French or
Norman extraction: They affected to employ the lan∣guage
of that country in all public transactions, and
even in familiar conversation: And as both the English
court and camp were always full of nobles, who came
from some province or other of France, the two people
were during several centuries more intermingled together
than any two distinct nations, whom we meet with in
history. But the fatal pretensions of Edward III. dis∣solved
all these connexions, and left the seeds of great
animosity in both countries, especially among the Eng∣lish.
For it is remarkable, that this latter nation, tho'
they were commonly the aggressors, and by their suc∣cess
and situation were enabled to commit the most cruel
injuries on the other, have always retained a stronger
tincture of national antipathy; nor is their hatred reta∣liated
on them to an equal degree by the French. That
country lies in the middle of Europe, has been succes∣sively
engaged in hostilities with all its neighbours, the
<PB N="411" REF="440"/>
popular prejudices have been diverted into many channels,
and, among a people of softer manners, they never rose
to a great height against any particular nation.</P>
<P>PHILIP made great preparations against the attack of
the English, and such as seemed more than sufficient
to secure him from the danger. Besides the concurrence of
all the nobility in his own populous and warlike king∣dom,
his foreign alliances were both more cordial and
powerful than those which were formed by his antago∣nist.
The Pope, who, at this time, lived in Avignon,
was dependant on France, and being disgusted at the
connexions between Edward and Lewis of Bavaria,
whom he had excommunicated, he embraced with zeal
and sincerity the cause of the French monarch. The
King of Navarre, the duke of Brittany, the count de
Bar were in the same interests; and on the side of Ger∣many,
the King of Bohemia, the palatine, the dukes of
Lorraine and Austria, the bishop of Liege, the counts
de Deuxpont, Vaudemont, and Geneva. The allies of
Edward were in themselves weaker; and having no
other object, but his money, which began to be ex∣hausted,
they were very slow in their motions and very
iresolute in their measures.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1339.</NOTE> The duke of Brabant, the
most powerful among them, seemed even inclined to
withdraw himself wholly from the alliance; and the
King was necessitated, both to give the Brabanters new
privileges in trade, and to contract his son Edward with
the daughter of that prince, ere he could bring him to
fulfil his engagements. The summer was wasted in
conferences and negotiations before Edward could lead
his armies into the field; and he was obliged, in order
to allure his German allies into his measures, to pretend
that the first attack should be made upon Cambray, a
city of the empire which had been garrisoned by Philip<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv, 1. chap. 39. Heming. p. 305.</NOTE>.
<PB N="412" REF="441"/>
But finding by a nearer inspection the difficulty of the
enterprize upon this place, he conducted them towards
the frontiers of France; and he there found, by a sen∣sible
proof, the vanity of his expectations: The count de
Namur, and even the count de Hainault, his brother-in-law
(for the old count was dead) refused to commence
hostilities against their liege lord, and retired with all
their troops<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 39.</NOTE>. So little account did they make of Ed∣ward's
pretensions to the crown of France!</P>
<P>THE King however entered the enemy's country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE>
and encamped on the fields of Vironfosse near Capelle,
with an army of near 50,000 men, composed almost en∣tirely
of foreigners. Philip came within sight of him
with an army of near double his force, composed chiefly
of native subjects; and it was daily expected that a battle
would have ensued. But the English monarch was
averse to engage against so great an inequality: The
French thought it sufficient if he eluded the attacks of
his enemy, without running any unnecessary hazard.
The two armies faced one another for some days: Mu∣tual
defiances were sent: And Edward, at last, retired
backwards into Flanders, and dispersed his army<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 41, 42, 43. Heming. p. 307. Walsing. p. 143.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH was the fruitless and almost ridiculous conclu∣sion
of all Edward's mighty preparations; and as his
measures were the most prudent, that could be embraced
in his situation, he might learn from experience in what
a hopeless enterprize he was engaged. His expences,
though they had led to no end, had been consuming and
destructive: He had contracted near 300,000 pounds of
debt<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 17.</NOTE>; he had anticipated all his revenue; he had pawned
every thing of value, which belonged either to himself or
<PB N="413" REF="442"/>
his queen; he was obliged in some measure even to pawn
himself to his creditors, by desiring their permission to go
over to England, in order to procure supply, and by
promising on his word of honour to return in person, if
he did not remit them their money.</P>
<P>BUT he was a prince of too much spirit to be discou∣raged
by the first difficulties of an undertaking; and he
was anxious to retrieve his honour by more successful
and more gallant enterprizes. For this purpose, he had,
during the course of the campaign, sent orders to sum∣mon
a parliament by his son Edward, whom he had left
with the title of guardian, and to demand of them some
supply in his urgent necessities. The barons seemed in∣clined
to grant his request; but the knights, who often,
at this time, acted as a separate body from the burgesses,
made some scruple of taxing their constituents, without
asking their consent; and they desired the guardian to
summon a new parliament, who might be properly em∣powered
for that purpose. The situation of the King
and parliament was, for the time, nearly similar to that
which they constantly fell into about the beginning of
the last century; and similar consequences began visibly
to appear. The King, sensible of the frequent demands
which he would be obliged to make on his people, had
been anxious to ensure to his friends a seat in the house
of commons, and at his instigation, the sheriffs and other
placemen had made interest to be elected into that assem∣bly;
an abuse which the knights desired the King to
correct by the tenor of his writ of summons, and which
was accordingly remedied. On the other hand, the
knights professedly annexed conditions to their intended
grant, and required a considerable retrenchment of the
royal prerogatives, particularly with regard to purvey∣ance,
and the levying the antient feudal aids for knight∣ing
the King's eldest son, and marrying his eldest daugh∣ter.
<PB N="414" REF="443"/>
The new parliament, called by the guardian,
retained the same free spirit; and tho' they offered a
large supply of 30,000 sacks of wool, no business was
concluded; because the conditions, which they annexed,
appeared too high to be compensated by a temporary
concession. But when Edward himself came over to
England, he summoned another parliament, and he had
the interest to procure a supply on more moderate terms.
A confirmation of the two charters and of the privileges
of boroughs, a pardon for old debts and trespasses, and a
remedy for some abuses in the execution of common
law, were the chief conditions insisted on; and the King
in return for his concessions on these heads, obtained
from the barons and knights an unusual grant for two
years of the ninth sheaf, lamb, and fleece on their
estates, and from the burgesses, a ninth of their move∣ables
at their true value. The whole parliament also
granted a duty of forty shillings on each sack of wool
exported, on each three hundred wool-fells, and on each
last of leather for the same term of years; but dreading
the arbitrary spirit of the crown, they expressly declared,
that this grant was to continue no longer, and was not
to be drawn into precedent. Being soon after sensible,
that this supply, tho' considerable and very unusual in
that age, would come in slowly, and would not answer
the King's urgent necessities, both from his past debts,
and his preparations for war; they agreed, that 20,000
sacks of wool should immediately be granted him, and
their value be deducted from the ninths, which were
afterwards to be levied.</P>
<P>BUT there appeared, at this time, another jealousy in
the parliament, which was very reasonable, and was
founded on a sentiment that ought to have engaged them
rather to check than support the King in all those ambi∣tious
projects, so little likely to prove successful, and so
<PB N="415" REF="444"/>
dangerous to the nation, if they did. Edward, who,
before the commencement of the former campaign, had,
in several commissions, assumed the title of King of
France, now more openly, in all public deeds, gave
himself that appellation, and always quartered the arms
of France with those of England in his seals and ensigns.
The parliament thought proper to obviate the conse∣quences
of this measure, and to declare, that they owed
him no obedience as King of France, and that the two
kingdoms must forever remain distinct and independent<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">14 Edward III.</NOTE>.
They undoubtedly foresaw, that France, if subdued,
would in the end prove the seat of government; and they
deemed this previous protestation necessary, in order to
prevent their becoming a province under that monarchy.
A very frail security, if the event had really taken
place!</P>
<P>AS Philip was apprized,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1340.</NOTE> from the preparations, which
were making both in England and the Low Countries,
that he must expect another invasion from Edward, he
fitted out a great fleet of 400 vessels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval vic∣tory. 13th June.</NOTE> manned with 40,000
men; and he stationed them off Sluise, with a view of
intercepting the King in his passage. The English
navy was much inferior in number, consisting only of
240 ships; but whether it was by the superior abilities
of Edward, or the greater dexterity of his seamen, they
gained the wind of the enemy, and had the sun in their
backs; and with these advantages began the action.
The battle was fierce and bloody: The English archers,
whose force and address were now much celebrated,
galled the French on their approach: And when the
ships grappled together, and the contest became more
steady and furious, the example of the King, and of so
many gallant nobles, who accompanied him, animated
<PB N="416" REF="445"/>
to such a degree the seamen and soldiery, that they main∣tained
every where a superiority over the enemy. The
French also had been guilty of some imprudence in station∣ing
themselves so near the coast of Flanders, and choosing
that place for the scene of action. The Flemings de∣scrying
the battle, hurried out of their ports, and brought
a re-inforcement to the English; which, coming unex∣pectedly,
had a greater effect than in proportion to its
power and numbers. Two hundred and thirty French
ships were taken: Thirty thousand Frenchmen were
killed, with two of their admirals: The loss of the Eng∣lish
was inconsiderable, compared to the greatness and
importance of the victory<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 51. Avesbury. p. 56. Heming. p. 321.</NOTE>. None of Philip's courtiers,
it is said, dared to inform him of the event; till his fool
or jester gave him a hint, by which he discovered the
loss that he had sustained<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 148.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE lustre of this great success added to the King's
authority among his allies, who assembled their forces
with expedition, and joined the English army. Edward
marched to the frontiers of France at the head of above
100,000 men, consisting chiefly of foreigners a more
numerous army than, either before or since, has ever
been commanded by any King of England<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. v. p. 197.</NOTE>. At the
same time, the Flemings, to the amount of 50,000 men,
marched out under the command of Robert d'Artois, and
laid siege to St. Omer; but this tumultuary force, com∣posed
entirely of tradesmen, unexperienced in war, was
routed by a sally of the garrison, and notwithstanding
the abilities of their leader, was thrown into such a
panic, that they were instantly dispersed, and never after
appeared in the field. The enterprizes of Edward, tho'
not attended with so inglorious an issue, proved equally
vain and fruitless. The King of France had assembled
<PB N="417" REF="446"/>
an army more numerous than the English; was accom∣panied
with all the chief nobility of his kingdom; was
attended by many foreign princes, and even by three
monarchs, the Kings of Bohemia, Scotland and Na∣varre<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 57.</NOTE>:
Yet he still adhered to the prudent resolution
of putting nothing to hazard, and after throwing strong
garrisons into all the frontier towns, he retired back∣wards,
persuaded, that the enemy, having wasted their
force in some tedious and unsuccessful enterprize, would
afford him an easy victory.</P>
<P>TOURNAY was at that time one of the most considera∣ble
cities of Flanders, containing above 60,000 inhabi∣tants
of all ages, who were affectionate to the French
government; and as the secret of Edward's designs had
not been strictly kept, Philip learned, that the English,
in order to gratify their Flemish allies, had intended to
open the campaign with the siege of this place: He took
care therefore to supply it with a garrison of 14,000
men, commanded by the bravest nobility of France;
and he reasonably expected, that these forces, joined to
the inhabitants, would be able to defend the city against
all the efforts of the enemy. Accordingly, Edward,
when he commenced the siege, about the end of July,
found every where an obstinate resistance: The valour
of the one side was encountered with equal valour by the
other: Every assault was repulsed and proved unsuccess∣ful:
And the King was at last obliged to turn the siege
into a blockade, in hopes, that the great numbers of the
garrison and inhabitants, which had enabled them to de∣send
themselves against his attacks, would but expose
them to be the more easily reduced by famine<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv, 1. chap. 54.</NOTE>. The
count d'Eu, the governor, as soon as he perceived that
the English had formed this plan of operations, endea∣voured
<PB N="418" REF="447"/>
to spare his provisions, by expelling all the useless
mouths; and the duke of Brabant, who wished no suc∣cess
to Edward's enterprise, gave every one a free passage
thro' his quarters.</P>
<P>AFTER the siege had continued ten weeks, the city
was reduced to distress; and Philip, recalling all his scat∣tered
garrisons, advanced at the head of a mighty army,
within three leagues of the English camp, with an inten∣tion
of still avoiding any decisive action, but of seeking
some opportunity to throw relief into the place. Here,
Edward, irritated with the small progress which he had
hitherto made, and with the disagreeable prospect that
lay before him, sent Philip a defiance by a herald; and
challenged him to decide their claims for the crown of
France, either by single combat, or by an action of a
hundred against a hundred, or by a general engagement.
But Philip replied, that Edward having done homage to
him for his dutchy of Guienne, and having solemnly ac∣knowledged
his superiority, it by no means became him
to send a defiance to his liege lord and sovereign: That
he was confident, notwithstanding all his preparations,
and his conjunction with the rebellious Flemings, to be
able soon to chace him from the frontiers of France:
That as Edward's hostilities had prevented him from ex∣ecuting
his purposed crusade against the infidels, he
trusted in the assistance of the Almighty, who would re∣ward
his pious intentions, and punish the aggressor,
whose ill-grounded claims had rendered them ineffectual:
That Edward proposed a duel on very unequal terms,
and offered to hazard only his own person, against both
the kingdom of France, and the person of the King:
But that if he would encrease the stake, and put also the
kingdom of England on the issue of the duel, he would,
notwithstanding that the terms would still be unequal,
<PB N="419" REF="448"/>
very willingly accept of his challenge<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet, Recueil de Traitez, &amp;c. Heming. p. 325, 326. Walsing. p. 149.</NOTE>. It was easy to
see that these mutual bravades were intended only to
dazle the populace, and that the two kings were too wise
to think of executing their pretended purpose.</P>
<P>WHILE the French and English armies lay in this
situation, and a general action was every day expected,
Jane countess dowager of Hainault interposed with her
good offices, and endeavoured to conciliate peace between
the contending monarchs, and to prevent any farther
effusion of blood. This princess was mother-in-law to
Edward, and sister to Philip; and tho' she had taken the
vows in a convent, and had abandoned the world, she
left her retreat on this occasion, and employed all her
pious efforts to allay those animosities, which had taken,
place between persons so nearly related to her, and to
each other. As Philip had no material claims upon his
antagonist, she found him to hearken very willingly to
the proposals; and even the haughty and ambitious mind
of Edward, convinced of his fruitless attempt, was not
averse to her negociation. He was sensible from expe∣rience,
that he had engaged in an enterprise which far
exceeded his force; and that the power of England was
never likely to prevail over that of a superior kingdom,
firmly united under an able and prudent monarch. He
discovered, that all the allies, whom he could gain by
negotiation, were at bottom averse to his enterprise;
and tho' they might second it to a certain length, would
immediately detach themselves, and oppose its final ac∣complishment,
if ever they could be brought to think,
that there was seriously any danger of it. He even saw,
that their chief purpose was to obtain money from him;
and as his supplies from England came in very slowly,
and had much disappointed his expectations, he was con∣vinced
<PB N="420" REF="449"/>
of their growing indifference in his cause, and of
their zeal to embrace all plausible terms of accommoda∣tion.
Convinced at last, that an undertaking must be
imprudent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Septr.</NOTE> which could only be supported by means so
unequal to the end, he concluded a truce, which left
both parties in possession of their present acquisitions,
and stopped all farther hostilities on the side of the Low
Countries, Guienne and Scotland, till Midsummer next<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 64. Avesbury, p. 65.</NOTE>.
A negotiation was soon after opened at Arras, under the
mediation of the Pope's legates, and the truce was at∣tempted
to be converted into a solid peace. Edward
here required that Philip should free Guienne from all
claims of superiority, and entirely abandon the protection
of Scotland: But as he seemed not any wise entitled to
make such exorbitant demands, either from his past suc∣eesses,
or future prospects, they were totally rejected by
Philip, who agreed only to a prolongation of the truce.</P>
<P>THE King of France soon after detached the emperor
Lewis from the alliance of England, and engaged him to
revoke the title of imperial vicar, which he had conferred
on Edward<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 352. Ypod. Neust. p. 514. Knyghton, p. 2580.</NOTE>. The King's other allies on the frontiers
of France, disappointed in their hopes, gradually with∣drew
from the confederacy. And Edward himself, har∣rassed
by his numerous and impatient creditors, was
obliged to make his escape by stealth into England.</P>
<P>THE unusual imposition of a ninth sheaf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Domestic disturban∣ces.</NOTE> lamb and
fleece, laid on by the parliament, together with the great
want of money, and still more, of credit in England,
had rendered the remittances to Flanders so backward;
nor could it be expected, that any expeditious methods
of collecting a tax, which was so new in itself, and
which yielded only a gradual produce, could possibly be
contrived by the King or his ministers. And tho' the
<PB N="421" REF="450"/>
parliament, foreseeing the inconvenience, had granted,
as a present resource, 20,000 sacks of wool, the only
English goods which bore a certain price in foreign mar∣kets,
and were the next to ready money; it was impos∣sible,
but the seizing of such a bulky commodity, the
gathering of it from different parts of the kingdom, and
the disposing of it abroad, must take up much more
time than the urgency of the King's affairs would permit,
and occasion all the disappointments complained of,
during the course of the campaign. But tho' nothing
had happened, which Edward might not reasonably have
foreseen, he was so irritated with the unfortunate issue
of his military operations, and so much vexed and af∣fronted
by his foreign creditors, that he was determined
to throw the blame somewhere off himself, and he came
in very bad humour into England. He discovered his
present disposition by the first act which he performed
after his arrival: As he landed unexpectedly, he found
the Tower somewhat unguarded; and he immediately
committed to prison the constable and all others who had
the charge of that fortress; and he treated them with un∣usual
rigour<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 513.</NOTE>. His vengeance fell next on the officers
of the revenue, the sheriffs, the collectors of taxes, the
undertakers of all kinds; and besides turning all of them
out of their offices, he appointed commissioners to en∣quire
into their conduct; and these men, in order to
gratify the King's humour, were sure not to find any
person innocent, who came before them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Avesbury, p. 70. Heming. p. 326. Walsingham, p. 150.</NOTE>. Sir John
St. Paul, keeper of the privy seal, Sir John Stonore,
lord chief justice, Andrew Aubrey, mayor of London,
were displaced and imprisoned; as were also the bishop
of Chichester, chancellor, and the bishop of Lichfield,
treasurer. Stratford, archbishop of Canterbury, on whom
<PB N="422" REF="451"/>
the charge of collecting the new taxes had been chiefly
laid, sell likewise under the King's displeasure; but
being absent at the time of Edward's first arrival, he
escaped feeling the immediate effects of it.</P>
<P>THERE were strong reasons, which might discourage
the Kings of England, in those ages, from bestowing
the chief offices of the crown on prelates and other eccle∣siastical
persons. These men had so entrenched them∣selves
in privileges and immunities, and pretended so
openly to be exempt from all secular jurisdiction, that
no civil penalty could be inflicted on them for any mal∣versation
in office; and as even treason itself was declared
to be no canonical offence, nor was allowed to be a suf∣ficient
reason for deprivation or other spiritual censures,
that order of men had ensured to themselves almost a total
impunity, and were not bound by any political laws or
statutes. But, on the other hand, there were many pe∣culiar
causes which favoured their promotion. Besides
that they possessed almost all the learning of the age, and
were best qualified for civil employments; the prelates
enjoyed equal dignity with the greatest barons, and gave
weight, by their personal authority, to the powers en∣trusted
with them: While, at the same time, they en∣dangered
not the crown by accumulating wealth or in∣fluence
in their families, and were restrained, by the
decency of their character, from that open rapine and
violence, so often practised by the nobles. These mo∣tives
had induced Edward, as well as many of his prede∣cessors,
to entrust the chief parts of his government in
the hands of ecclesiastics; at the hazard of seeing them
disown his authority so soon as it was turned against them.</P>
<P>THIS was the case with archbishop Stratford.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1341.</NOTE> That
prelate, informed of Edward's indignation against him,
<PB N="423" REF="452"/>
prepared himself for the storm; and not content with
standing upon the defensive, he resolved, by beginning
the attack, to show the King, that he knew the privi∣leges
of his character, and had courage to maintain them.
He issued a general sentence of excommunication against
all, who, on any pretext, exercised violence on the per∣son
or goods of clergymen; who infringed those privi∣leges
secured by the great charter, and by the ecclesiast∣ical
canons; or who accused a prelate of treason or any
other crime, in order to bring him under the King's dis∣pleasure<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 339. Ang. Sacra, vol. i. p 21, 22. Walsingham, p. 153.</NOTE>.
Even Edward had reason to think himself
struck at by this sentence; both on account of the im∣prisonment
of the two bishops and that of other clergy∣men
concerned in levying the taxes, and on account of
his seizing their lands and moveables, that he might
make them answerable for any balance, which remained
in their hands. The clergy, with the primate at their
head, were now formed into a regular combination
against the King; and many calumnies were spread
against him, in order to deprive him of the confidence
and affections of his people; that he intended to recal
the general pardon, and the remission of old debts which
he had granted, and to impose new and arbitrary taxes
without consent of parliament. The archbishop went so
far, in a letter to the King himself, as to tell him, that
there were two powers, by which the world was go∣verned,
the holy pontifical apostolie dignity, and the
royal subordinate authority; That of these two powers,
the clerical was evidently the supreme, since the priests
were to answer, at the tribunal of the divine judgment,
for the conduct of kings themselves: That the clergy
were the spiritual fathers of all the faithful, and amongst
<PB N="424" REF="453"/>
others of kings and princes; and were intitled, by a
heavenly charter, to direct their wills and actions, and
to censure their transgressions: And that prelates had
heretofore cited emperors before their tribunal, had tried
their life and behaviour, and had anathematized them
for their obstinate offences<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 27.</NOTE>. These topics were not
well calculated to appease Edward's indignation; and
when he called a parliament, he sent not to the primate,
as to the other peers, a summons to attend it. Strat∣ford
was not discouraged with this mark of neglect or
anger: He appeared before the gates, arrayed in his
pontifical robes, holding the crosier in his hand, and
accompanied with a pompous train of priests and pre∣lates;
and he required admittance to his seat as the first
and highest peer of the realm. For two days, the King
denied him entrance: But either sensible, that this affair
might be attended with dangerous consequences, or that
in his impatience he had groundlessly accused the primate
of malversation in his office, which seems really to have
been the case; he at last permitted him to take his seat,
and was reconciled to him<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 38, 39, 40, 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD now found himself in a very bad situation
both with his own people and with foreign states; and it
required all his genius and capacity to extricate himself
from such multiplied difficulties and embarrassments.
His unjust and exorbitant claims on France and Scotland
had engaged him in an implacable war with these two
kingdoms, his nearest neighbours: He had lost almost
all his foreign alliances by his irregular payments: He
was deeply involved in debts, for which he owed a con∣suming
interest: His military operations had vanished
into smoke; and except his naval victory, none of them
<PB N="425" REF="454"/>
had been attended even with glory or renown, either to
himself or to the nation: The animosity between him and
the clergy was open and declared: The people were dis∣contented
on account of many arbitrary measures, in which
he had been engaged: And what was more dangerous,
the nobility, taking advantage of his present necessities,
were determined to retrench his power, and by encroach∣ing
on the antient prerogatives of the crown, to acquire
to themselves independance and authority. But the
aspiring genius of Edward, which had so far transported
him beyond the bounds of discretion, proved at last suf∣ficient
to re-instate him in his former authority, and
finally to render his reign the most triumphant which is
to be met with in English story: Tho' for the present he
was obliged, with some loss of honour, to yield to the
current, which bore so strongly against him.</P>
<P>THE parliament framed an act, which was likely to
produce considerable innovations in the government.
They premised, that, whereas the great charter had, to
the manifest peril and slander of the King and damage of
his people, been violated in many points, particularly
by the imprisonment of free men and the seizure of
their goods, without suit, indictment or trial, it was
necessary to confirm it anew, and to oblige all the chief
officers of the law, together with the steward and cham∣berlain
of the houshold, the keeper of the privy seal, the
controller and treasurer of the wardrobe, and those who
were entrusted with the education of the young prince,
to swear to the regular observance of it. They also re∣marked,
that the peers of the realm had formerly been
arrested and imprisoned, and dispossessed of their tempo∣ralities
and lands, and even some of them put to death,
without judgment of their peers; and they therefore
enacted that such violences should henceforth cease,
and no peer be punished but by the award of his peers
<PB N="426" REF="455"/>
<HI>in parliament.</HI> They required, that, whenever any of
the great offices abovementioned should become vacant,
the King should fill it by the advice of his council, and
the consent of other great men, who should at that time
be sound to reside in the neighbourhood of the court.
And they enacted, that on the third day of every session,
the King should resume into his own hands all these
offices, except those of justices of the two benches and
the barons of exchequer; that these ministers should for
the time be reduced to private persons; that they should
in that condition answer before the parliament to any
accusations brought against them; and that, if they
were found any wise guilty, they should finally be dis∣possessed
of their offices, and more sufficient persons be
substituted in their place<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">15 Edw. III.</NOTE>. By these last regulations,
the barons approached as near as they dared to those
restrictions, which had formerly been imposed on Hen∣ry
III. and Edward II. and which, from the dangerous
consequences attending them, had become so generally
odious, that they did not expect to have either the con∣currence
of the people in demanding them, or the assent
of the present King in granting them.</P>
<P>IN return for these important concessions, the parlia∣ment
proffered the King a grant of 20,000 sacks of wool;
and his wants were so urgent, from the clamours of his
creditors, and the demands of his foreign allies, that he
was obliged to accept of the supply on these hard condi∣tions.
He ratified this statute in full parliament; but he
<HI>secretly</HI> entered a protest of such a nature as was suffi∣cient,
one should imagine, to destroy for the future all
trust and confidence with his people: He declared, that,
so soon as his convenience permitted, he would, from
his own authority, revoke what had been extorted from
<PB N="427" REF="456"/>
him<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 15 Edw. III. That this protest of the King's was <HI>secret</HI> appears evidently, since otherwise it would have been ridi∣culous in the parliament to have accepted of his assent: Besides the King owns that he <HI>dissembled,</HI> which would not have been the case, had his protest been public.</NOTE>. Accordingly, he was no sooner possessed of the
parliamentary supply, than he issued an edict, which
contains many extraordinary positions and pretensions.
He first asserts, that that statute had been enacted contrary
to the law; as if a free legislative body could ever do any
thing illegal. He next affirms, that, as it was hurtful
to the prerogatives of the crown which he was sworn to
defend, he had only dissembled, when he seemed to ratify
it, but that he had never in his own breast given his
assent to it. He does not pretend, that either he or the
parliament lay under any force; but only that some in∣convenience
would have ensued had he not seemingly
given his assent to that pretended statute. He therefore,
with the advice of his council and of some earls and ba∣rons,
abrogates and annuls it; and tho' he professes
himself willing and determined to observe such articles
of it as were formerly law, he declares it to have thence∣forth
no force or authority<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 15 Edw. III.</NOTE>. The parliaments, who
were afterwards assembled, took no notice of this arbi∣trary
exertion of royal power, which by a parity of reason
left all their laws at the mercy of the King; and during
the course of two years, Edward had so far re-established
his influence, and freed himself from his present necessities,
that he then obtained from his parliament a legal repeal of
the obnoxious statute<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridgm, p. 38, 39.</NOTE>. This transaction certainly con∣tains
remarkable circumstances, which discover the man∣ners
and sentiments of the age, and may prove what inac∣curate
work might be expected from such rude hands, when
<PB N="428" REF="457"/>
employed in legislation, and in rearing the delicate fabric
of laws and a constitution.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Edward had happily recovered his authority
at home, which had been impaired by the events of the
French war, he had undergone so many mortifications
from that attempt, and saw so little prospect of success,
that he would probably have dropt his claim, had not a
revolution in Brittany opened to him more promising
views, and given his enterprizing genius a full opportu∣nity
of displaying itself.</P>
<P>JOHN III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Brittany.</NOTE> duke of Brittany, had, some years before
his death, found himself declining thro' age and infirmi∣ties;
and having no issue, he was solicitous to prevent
those disorders, to which, on the event of his decease, a
disputed succession might expose his subjects. His
younger brother, the count de Penthievre, had left only
one daughter, whom the duke deemed his heir; and as
his family had inherited the dutchy by a female succes∣sion,
he thought her title preferable to that of the count
de Mountfort, who, being his brother by a second mar∣riage,
was the male heir of that principality<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 64.</NOTE>. He ac∣cordingly
proposed to bestow her in marriage on some
person, who might be able to defend her rights; and he
cast his eye on Charles de Blois, nephew of the King of
France, by his mother, Margaret de Valois, sister to
that monarch. But as he both loved his subjects and was
beloved by them, he determined not to take this impor∣tant
step without their approbation; and having assem∣bled
the states of Brittany, he represented to them the
advantages of that alliance, and the prospect, which
it gave, of an entire settlement of his succession. The
Bretons willingly concurred in his choice: The marriage
was concluded: All his vassals, and among the rest, the
<PB N="429" REF="458"/>
count de Mountfort, swore fealty to Charles and to his
spouse as to their future sovereigns: And every danger of
civil commotions seemed to be obviated, as far as human
prudence could provide a remedy against them.</P>
<P>BUT on the death of this good prince the ambition
of the count de Mountfort broke thro' all these regu∣lations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Renewal of the war with France.</NOTE>
and kindled a war, not only dangerous to Brit∣tany,
but to a great part of Europe. While Charles de
Blois was soliciting at the court of France the investiture
of the dutchy, Mountfort was active in acquiring imme∣diate
possession of it; and by force or intrigue he made
himself master of Rennes, Nantz, Brest, Hennebonne,
and all the most important fortresses, and engaged many
considerable barons to acknowledge his authority<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1, chap. 65, 66, 67, 68.</NOTE>.
Sensible, that he could expect no favour from Philip,
he made a voyage to England, on pretence of soliciting
his claim to the earldom of Richmond, which had de∣volved
to him by his brother's death; and offering to do
homage to Edward, as King of France, for the dutchy
of Brittany, he proposed a strict alliance for the support
of each other's pretensions. Edward saw immediately
the advantages attending this treaty: Mountfort, an
active and valiant prince, closely united to him by in∣terest,
opened at once an entrance into the heart of
France, and afforded him much more flattering views,
than his allies on the side of Germany and the Low
Countries, who had no sincere attachment to his cause,
and whose progress was also obstructed by those nume∣rous
fortifications, which had been raised on that fro∣ntier.
Robert d'Artois was zealous in inforcing these
considerations: The ambitious spirit of Edward was little
disposed to fit down under those repulses, which he had
received, and which, he thought, had so much injured
<PB N="430" REF="459"/>
his reputation: And it required a very short negotiation
to conclude a treaty of alliance between two men; who
tho' their pleas with regard to the preference of male or
female succession were directly opposite, were intimately
connected by their common interests<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS this treaty was still a secret, Mountfort, on his
return, ventured to appear at Paris, in order to defend
his cause before the court of peers; but observing Philip
and his judges to be prepossessed against his title, and
dreading their intentions of arresting him, till he sould
restore what he had seized by violence, he suddenly made
his escape; and war immediately broke out between him
and Charles de Blois<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 70, 71.</NOTE>. Philip sent his eldest son, the
duke of Normandy, with a powerful army to the assistance
of the latter; and Mountfort, unable to keep the field
against his rival, remained in the city of Nantz, where
he was besieged. The city was taken by the treachery
of the inhabitants: Mountfort fell into the hands of his
enemies; was conducted as a prisoner to Paris; and was
shut up in the tower of the Louvre<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 73.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS event seemed to put an end to the pretensions of
the count de Mountfort;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1342.</NOTE> but his affairs were immediately
retrieved by an unexpected incident, which inspired new
life and vigour into his party. Jane of Flanders, countess
of Mountfort, the most extraordinary woman of that age,
was rouzed, by the captivity of her husband, from those
domestic cares, to which the had hitherto limited her
genius; and the courageously undertook to support the
falling fortunes of her family. No sooner did the receive
the fatal intelligence, than the assembled the inhabitants
of Rennes, where the then resided; and Carrying her
infant son in her arms, deplored to them the calamity of
<PB N="431" REF="460"/>
their sovereign, and recommended to their care the illus∣trious
orphan, the sole male remaining of their antient
princes, who had governed them with such indulgence
and lenity, and to whom they had ever professed such a
zealous attachment. She declared herself willing to run
all hazards with them in so just a cause; discovered the re∣sources
which still remained in the alliance of England;
and entreated them to make one effort against an usurper,
who, being imposed on them by the arms of France,
would in return make a sacrifice to his protector of the
antient liberties of Brittany. The audience, moved by
the affecting appearance, and inspirited by the noble con∣duct
of the princess, vowed to live and die with her in
defending the rights of her family: All the other for∣tresses
of Brittany embraced the same resolution: The
countess went from place to place, encouraging the gar∣risons,
providing them with every thing necessary for
subsistance, and concerting their plans of dedence; and
after me had put the whole province in a proper posture,
the shut herself up in Hennebonne, where she waited
with impatience the arrival of those fuccours, which
Edward had promised her. Mean while, the sent over
her son to England, both that the might put him in a
place of safety, and engage the King more strongly, by
such a pledge, to embrace with zeal the interests of her
family.</P>
<P>CHARLES DE BLOIS, anxious to make himself master
of so important a fortress as Hennebonne, and still more
to take the countess prisoner, from whole vigour and
capacity all the difficulties to his succession in Brittany
now proceeded, fat down before the place with a great
army, composed of French, Spaniards, Genoese, and
some Bretons; and he conducted the attack with indefa∣tigable
industry<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv, 1, chap. 81.</NOTE>. The defence was no less vigorous:
<PB N="432" REF="461"/>
The besiegers were repulsed in every assault: Frequent
sallies were made with success by the garrison: And the
countess herself being the most forward in all military
operations, every one was ashamed not to do his duty to
the utmost in this desperate situation. One day the per∣ceived,
that the besiegers, entirely employed in an at∣tack,
had neglected a distant quarter of their camp; and
the immediately sallied forth at the head of a body of
200 cavalry, threw them into confusion, executed great
slaughter upon them, and set fire to their tents, baggage
and magazines: But when the was preparing to return,
the found that the was intercepted, and that a great body
of the enemy had thrown themselves between her and
the gates. She instantly took her resolution; the ordered
her men to disband, and to make the best of their way by
slight to Brest, She met them at the appointed place of
rendezvous, collected another body of 500 horse, re∣turned
to Hennebonne, broke unexpectedly thro' the
enemies camp, and was received with shouts and accla∣mations
by the garrison, who, encouraged by this rein∣forcement,
and by so rare an example of female valour,
determined to defend themselves to the last extremity.</P>
<P>THE reiterated attacks, however, of the besiegers,
had at length made several breaches in the walls; and
it was apprehended, that a general assault, which was
every hour expected, would overpower the garrison, di∣minished
in their numbers, and extremely weakened with
watching and fatigue. It became necessary to treat of a
capitulation; and the bishop of Leon was already en∣gaged,
for that purpose, in a conference with Charles
de Blois, when the countess, who had mounted on a
high tower, and was looking towards the sea with great
impatience, descried some sails at a distance. She im∣mediately
exclaimed: <HI>Behold the succours! the English
<PB N="433" REF="462"/>
succours! No capitulation</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 81.</NOTE>! This fleet carried a body of
English gens d'armes, and six thousand archers, whom
Edward had prepared for the relief of Hennebonne, but
who had been long detained by contrary winds. They
entered the harbour under the command of Sir Walter
Manny, one of the bravest captains of England; and
having inspired fresh courage into the garrison, imme∣diately
sallied forth, beat the besiegers from all their
posts, and obliged them to decamp.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding this success, the countess of
Mountfort found that her party, overpowered by supe∣rior
numbers, were declining in every quarter; and the
went over to solicit more effectual succours from the
King of England. Edward granted her a considerable
reinforcement under Robert d'Artois; who embarked
his troops on board a fleet of forty-five ships, and sailed
to Brittany. He was met in his passage by the enemy;
an action ensued, where the countess behaved with her
wonted valour, and charged the enemy sword in hand;
but the fleets, after a sharp action, were separated by a
storm, and the English arrived safely in Brittany. The
first exploit of Robert d'Artois was the taking of Vanne's,
which he mastered by conduct and address<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 93.</NOTE>: But he sur∣vived
a very little time this prosperity. The Breton no∣blemen
of the party of Charles assembled secretly in arms,
attacked Vannes of a sudden, and carried the place;
chiefly by reason of a wound received by Robert d'Ar∣tois,
of which he soon after died at sea on his return to
England<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of this unfortunate prince, the chief
author of all the calamities, with which his country was
overwhelmed for above a century, Edward undertook in
<PB N="434" REF="463"/>
person the defence of the countess of Mountfort; and as
the last truce with France was now expired, the war,
which the English and French had hitherto carried on
as allies to the competitors for Brittany, is thenceforth
conducted in the name and under the standard of the
two monarchs. The King landed at Morbian near
Vannes, with an army of 12,000 men; and being master
of the field, where no enemy dared to appear against
him, he endeavoured to give a lustre to his arms, by
commencing at once three important sieges, that of Van∣nes,
of Rennes, and of Nantz. But by undertaking
too much, he failed of success in all his enterprizes.
Even the siege of Vannes, which Edward in person con∣ducted
with vigour, advanced but slowly<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 95.</NOTE>; and the
French had all the leisure requisite for making prepara∣tions
against him. The duke of Normandy, eldest son
of Philip, appeared in Brittany at the head of an army
of 30,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry; and Edward was
now obliged to draw together all his forces, and to en∣trench
himself strongly before Vannes, where the duke
of Normandy soon after arrived, and in a manner invest∣ed
the besiegers. The garrison and the French camp
were plentifully supplied with provisions; while the Eng∣lish,
who dared to make no attempt upon the place in
the presence of a superior army, drew all their subsistance
from England, exposed to the hazards of the sea, and
sometimes to those arising from the fleet of the enemy.
In this dangerous situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1343.</NOTE> Edward very willingly hear∣kened
to the mediation of the Pope's legates, the cardi∣nals
of Palestrine and Frescati, who endeavoured to ne∣gotiate;
if not a peace, at least a truce between the two
kingdoms. A treaty was concluded for a cessation of
arms during three years<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv, I. chap. 99. Avesbury, p. 102.</NOTE>; and Edward had the ability,
<PB N="435" REF="464"/>
notwithstanding his present dangerous situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1343</NOTE> to pro∣cure
to himself very equal and honourable terms. It was
agreed, that Vannes should be sequestered, during the
truce, in the hands of the legates, to be disposed of after∣wards
as they pleased; and tho' Edward knew the par∣tiality
of the court of Rome towards his antagonist, he
saved himself by this device from the dishonour of having
undertaken a fruitless enterprize. It was alse stipulated,
that all prisoners should be released, that, the places in
Brittany should remain in the hands of the present pos∣sessors,
and that the allies on both sides should be com∣prehended
in the truce<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 359.</NOTE>. Edward, soon after concluding
this treaty, embarked with his army for England.</P>
<P>THE truce, tho' calculated for a long time, was of
very short duration; and each monarch endeavoured to
throw on the other the blame of its infraction. Of
course, the historians of the two countries differ in their
account of the matter. It seems probable, however, as
is affirmed by the French writers, that Edward, in
consenting to the truce, had no other purpose than to
extricate himself from a perilous situation, into which he
had fallen, and was afterwards very careless of its ob∣servance.
In all the memorials which remain on this
subject, he complains chiefly of the punishment inflicted
on Oliver de Clisson, Henry de Leon, and other Breton
noblemen, who, he says, were partizans of the family
of Mountfort, and consequently under the protection of England<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. v. p. 453, 454, 459, 466, 496. Heming. p. 376.</NOTE>. But it appears from the history, that at the
conclusion of the truce, those noblemen had openly, by
their declarations and actions, embraced the cause of
Charles de Blois<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 96. p. 100.</NOTE>; and if they had entered into any
secret correspondence and engagements with Edward,
they were traitors to their party, and were justly punish∣able
<PB N="436" REF="465"/>
by Philip and Charles, for their breach of faith;
nor had Edward any just ground of complaint against
France for such severities.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1344.</NOTE> But when he laid these pre∣tended
injuries before the parliament, whom he affected
to consult on all occasions, that assembly entered into the
quarrel, advised the King not to be amused by a fraudu∣lent
truce, and granted him supplies for the renewal of
the war: The counties were charged with a fifteenth for
two years, and the boroughs with a tenth. The clergy
consented to give a tenth for three years.</P>
<P>THESE supplies enabled the King to complete his mi∣litary
preparations; and he sent his cousin, Henry earl
of Derby, son of the earl of Lancaster, into Guienne,
for the defence of that province<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 103. Avesbury, p. 121.</NOTE>. This prince, the
most accomplished of the English court, possessed in a
high degree the virtue of humanity as well as those of
valour and conduct<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">It is reported of this prince, that, having once, before the attack of a town, promised the soldiers the plunder, one private man hap∣pened to fall upon a great chest full of money, which he immediately brought to the earl, as thinking it too great for himself to keep pos∣session of it. But Derby told him, that his promise did not depend on the greatness or smallness of the sum; and bid him keep it all for his own use.</NOTE>, and not content with protecting
and cherishing the province committed to his charge, he
made a very successful invasion on the enemy. He at∣tacked
the count de Laille, the French general at Ber∣gerac,
beat him from his entrenchments, and took the
place. He reduced a great part of Perigord, and conti∣nually
advanced in his conquests, till the count de Laille,
having collected an army often or twelve thousand men,
sat down before Auberoche, in hopes of recovering that
place, which had fallen into the hands of the English.
The earl of Derby came upon him by surprize with only
a thousand cavalry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1345.</NOTE> threw the French into disorder,
<PB N="437" REF="466"/>
pushed his advantages, and obtained a complete victory.
De Laille himself, with many considerable nobles, was,
taken prisoner<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 104.</NOTE>. After this important advantage, Der∣by
made a rapid progress in subduing the French pro∣vinces.
He took Monsegur, Monpesat, Villefranche,
Miremont, and Tonnins, with the fortress of Damassen
Aiguillon, a fortress deemed impregnable, fell into his
hands from the cowardice of the governor. Angouleme
was surrendered after a short siege. The only place,
where he met with a considerable resistance, was Reole,
which, however, was at last reduced after a siege of above
nine weeks<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 110.</NOTE>. Having made an attempt on Blaye, he
thought it more prudent to raise the siege, rather than
waste his time, before a place of small importance<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 112.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE reason why Derby was permitted without oppo∣sition
to make such progress on the side of Guienne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1346.</NOTE>
was the dissiculties under which the French finances then
laboured, and which had obliged Philip to lay on new
impositions, particularly the duty on salt, to the great
discontent, and almost mutiny of his subjects. But after
the court of France was supplied with money, great pre∣parations
were made; and the duke of Normandy, at∣tended
by the duke of Burgundy, and other great nobi∣lity,
led towards Guienne a powerful army, which the
English could not think of resisting in the open field.
The earl of Derby stood on the defensive, and allowed
the French to carry on at leisure the siege of Angouleme,
which was their first enterprize. John lord Norwich,
the governor, after a brave and vigorous defence, found
himself reduced to extremities; and he was obliged to
employ a stratagem, in order to save his garrison, and to
prevent his being reduced to surrender at discretion.
<PB N="438" REF="467"/>
He appeared on the walls, and desired to speak with
the duke of Normandy. The prince, when he came,
told Norwich, that he supposed he intended to capitu∣late.
“Not at all,” replied the governor: “But as to∣morrow
is the feast of the Virgin, to whom, I know,
that you, Sir, as well as myself, bear a great devo∣tion,
I desire a cessation of arms for that day.” The
proposals were agreed to; and Norwich, having ordered
his forces to prepare all their baggage, marched out, and
advanced towards the French camp. The besiegers,
imagining they were to be attacked, ran to their arms;
but Norwich sent a messenger to the duke, reminding
him of his engagement. The duke, who piqued himself
on the faithful observance of his word, exclaimed, <HI>I see
the governor has outwitted me: But let us be contented with
gaining the place:</HI> And the English were allowed to pass
thro' the camp unmolested<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 120.</NOTE>. After some other succes∣ses,
the duke of Normandy laid siege to Aiguillon; and
as the natural strength of the fortress, together with a
brave garrison under the command of the earl of Pem∣broke,
and sir Walter Manny, rendered it impossible to
take the place by assault, he proposed, after making seve∣ral
fruitless attacks<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 121.</NOTE>, to reduce it by famine: But be∣fore
he could finish his enterprize, he was called to ano∣ther
part of the kingdom, by one of the greatest disasters,
that ever befel the French monarchy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 134.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD, informed by the earl of Derby of the great
danger to which Guienne was exposed, had prepared a
fleet and army, with which he intended in person to bring
it relief. He embarked at Southampton on board a fleet
of near a thousand fail of all dimensions; and carried
with him, besides all the chief nobility of England, his
<PB N="439" REF="468"/>
eldest son the prince of Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th July.</NOTE> now fifteen years of age.
The winds proved long contrary<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Avesbury, p. 123.</NOTE>; and the King, in
despair of arriving in time at Guienne, was at last per∣suaded
by Geoffry d'Harcourt, to change the destination
of his enterprize. This nobleman was a Norman by
birth, had long made a considerable figure in the court
of France, and was generally esteemed for his personal
merit and valour; but being disobliged and persecuted by
Philip, he had fled over to England; had recommended
himself to Edward, who was an excellent judge of men;
and had succeeded to Robert d'Artois in the invidious
office of exciting and assisting the King in every enter∣prize
against his native country. He had long insisted,
that an expedition to Normandy promised, in the present
circumstances, much more favourable success, than one
to Guienne; that Edward would find the northern pro∣vinces
much unfurnished of military force, which had
been drawn to the south; that they were full of slourish∣ing
cities, whose plunder would enrich the English; that
their cultivated fields, as yet unspoiled by war, would
supply them with plenty of provisions; and that the
neighbourhood of the capital rendered every event of
importance in those quarters<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv, 1. chap. 121.</NOTE>. These reasons, which
had not before been duly weighed by Edward, began to
make more impression after the disappointments, which
he had met with in his voyage to Guienne: He ordered
his fleet to sail to Normandy, and safely disembarked his
army at la Hogue.</P>
<P>THIS army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> which was, during the course of the en∣suing
campaign, crowned with the most splendid success,
that ever attended the enterprize of any English monarch,
consisted of four thousand men at arms, ten thousand
archers, ten thousand Welsh infantry, and six thousand
Irish. The Welsh and the Irish were light, disorderly
<PB N="440" REF="469"/>
troops, fitter for doing execution in a pursuit, or scouring
the country, than for any stable action. The bow was
always esteemed a frivolous weapon, where true mili∣tary
discipline was known, and regular bodies of well
armed foot maintained. The only solid force in this
army were the men at arms, and even these, being ca∣valry,
were, on that account, much inferior, in the
shock of battle, to good infantry: And as the whole
were new levied troops, we are led to entertain a very
mean idea of the military force of those ages, which,
being ignorant in every other art, had not properly culti∣vated
the art of war itself, the sole object of their at∣tention.</P>
<P>THE King created the earl of Arundel constable of
his army, and the earls of Warwic and Harcourt, mareschals:
He bestowed the honour of knighthood on the
prince of Wales and several of the young nobility, im∣mediately
upon his landing. After destroying all the
ships in la Hogue, Barfleur, and Cherbourg, he spread
his army over the whole country, and gave them an un∣bounded
licence of burning, spoiling, and plundering
every place, of which they became masters. The loose
discipline then practised, could not be much hurt by these
disorderly practices; and Edward took care to prevent
any surprize, by giving orders to his troops, however they
might disperse themselves in the day time, always to
quarter themselves at night near the main body. In this
manner, Montebourg, Carentan, St. Lo, Valognes,
and other places in the Cotentin were pillaged without
resistance; and an universal consternation was spread
over the whole province<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 122/.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE intelligence of this unexpected invasion soon
reached Paris; and threw Philip into great perplexity.
<PB N="441" REF="470"/>
He issued orders, however, for levying forces in all quar∣ters,
and dispatched the count d'Eu, constable of France,
and the count de Tancarville, with a body of troops, to
the defence of Caën, a populous and commercial but
open city, which lay in the neighbourhood of the Eng∣lish
army. The temptation of so rich a prize soon al∣lured
Edward to approach it; and the inhabitants, encou∣raged
by their numbers, and by the re-inforcements
which they daily received from the country, ventured,
against the advice of the constable, to meet him in the
field. But their courage failed them on the first shock:
They fled with precipitation: The counts d'Eu and
Tancarville were taken prisoners: The victors entered
the city along with the vanquished, and a furious mas∣sacre
commenced, without distinction of age, sex, or
condition. The citizens, in despair, barricaded their
houses, and assaulted the English with stones, bricks,
and every missile weapon: The English made way by
fire to the destruction of the citizens: Till Edward,
anxious to save both his spoil and his soldiers, stopped
the massacre; and having obliged the inhabitants to lay
down their arms, gave his troops licence to begin a more
regular and less hazardous plunder of the city. The
pillage continued for three days: The King reserved for
his own share the jewels, plate, silks, fine cloth, and
fine linen; and he bestowed all the remainder of the
spoil on his army. The whole was embarked on board
the ships, and sent over to England; together with
three hundred of the richest citizens of Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, whose
ransom was an additional profit, which he expected after∣wards
to levy<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 124.</NOTE>. This dismal scene passed in the pre∣sence
of two cardinal legates, who had come to nego∣tiate
a peace between the kingdoms.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="471"/>
THE King moved next to Roüen in hopes of treating
that city in the same manner; but found, that the bridge
over the Seine was already broken down, and that the
King of France himself was arrived there with his army.
He marched along the banks of that river towards Paris,
destroying the whole country, and every town and vil∣lage,
which he met with on his road<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Froissrt, liv. 1. chap. 125.</NOTE>. Some of his
light troops carried their ravages even to the gates of
Paris; and the royal palace of. St. Germans, together
with Nanterre, Ruelle, and other villages, was reduced
to ashes within sight of that capital. The English pro∣posed
to pass the river at Poissy, but found the French
army encamped on the opposite banks, and the bridge at
that place, as well as all others upon the Seine, broken
down by orders from Philip. Edward now saw, that
the French intended to enclose him m their country, in
hopes of attacking him with advantage on all sides:
But he saved himself by a stratagem from this perilous
situation. He gave his army orders to dislodge, and to
advance farther up the Seine; but immediately returning
by the same route, arrived at Poissy, which the enemy
had already quitted, in order to attend his motions. He
repaired the bridge with incredible celerity, passed over
his army, and having thus disengaged himself from the
enemy, advanced by quick marches towards Flanders,
His vanguard, commanded by Harcourt, met with the
townsmen of Amiens, who were hastening to reinforce
their King, and defeated them with great slaughter<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>:
He passed by Beauvais, and burned the suburbs of that
city: But as he approached the Somme, he found himself
in the same difficulty as before: All the bridges on that
river were either broken down, or strongly guarded:
An army, under the command of Godemar de Faye,
<PB N="443" REF="472"/>
was stationed on the opposite banks: Philip was ad∣vancing
on him from the other quarter, with an army of
an hundred thousand men: And he was thus exposed to
the danger of being enclosed, and of starving in an ene∣my's
country. In this extremity, he published a reward
to any one, that could bring him intelligence of a pas∣sage
over the Somme. A peasant, called Gobin Agace,
whose name has been preserved by the share which he
had in these important transactions, was tempted on this
occasion to betray the interests of his country; and he
informed Edward of a ford below Abbeville, which had
a sound bottom, and might be passed without difficulty
at low water<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 126, 127.</NOTE>. The King hastened thither, but found
Godemar de Faye on the opposite banks. Being urged
by necessity, he deliberated not a moment; but threw
himself into the river, sword in hand, at the head of his
troops; drove the enemy from their station; and pursued
them to a distance on the plain<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 127.</NOTE>. The French army
under Philip, arrived at the ford, when the rear-guard of
the English were patting. So narrow was the escape,
which Edward, by his prudence and celerity, made from
this danger! The rising of the tide prevented the French
King from following him over the ford, and obliged that
prince to take his road over the bridge at Abbeville; by
which fome time was lost.</P>
<P>IT is natural to think, that Philip, at the head of so
vast an army, was impatient to take revenge of the Eng∣lish,
and to prevent the disgrace to which he must be
exposed, if an inserior enemy shoud be allowed, after
ravaging so great a part of his kingdom, to escape with
impunity. Edward also was sensible, that such must be
the object of the French monarch; and as he had ad∣vanced,
but a little way before his enemy, he saw the
<PB N="444" REF="473"/>
danger of precipitating his march over the plains of Pi∣cardy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Crecy. 26th Aug.</NOTE>
and of exposing his rear to the insults of the
numerous cavalry, in which the French camp abounded.
He took therefore a very prudent resolution: He chose
his ground with advantage near the village of Crecy; he
disposed his army in excellent order; he determined to
await in tranquillity the arrival of the enemy; and he
hoped, that their eagerness to engage, and to prevent his
retreat, after all their past disappointments, would hurry
them on to some rash and ill-concerted action. He drew
up his army on a gentle ascent, and divided them into
three lines: The first was commanded by the prince of
Wales, and under him, by the earls of Warwic and Ox∣ford,
by Harcourt, and by the lords Chandos, Holland,
and other noblemen: The earls of Arundel and North∣ampton,
with the lords Willoughby, Basset, Roos,
and sir Lewis Tuston, were at the head of the second
line: He took on himself the command of the third divi∣sion,
by which he proposed either to bring succour to the
two first lines, or to secure a retreat in case of any mis∣fortunes,
or to push his advantages against his enemy.
He had likewise the precaution to throw up trenches on
his flank, in order to secure himself from the numerous
bodies of the French, who might assail him from that
quarter; and he placed all his baggage behind him in a
wood, which he also secured by an intrenchment<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 128.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE skill and order of this disposition, with the tran∣quillity
in which it was made, served extremely to com∣pose
the minds of the soldiers; and the King, that he
might farther inspirit them, rode thro' their ranks with such
an air of cheerfulness and alacrity in his countenance,
as conveyed the highest confidence into every beholder.
He pointed out to them the necessity, to which they
<PB N="445" REF="474"/>
were at present reduced, and the certain and inevitable
destruction which awaited them, if, in their present situ∣ation,
enclosed on all hands in an enemy's country,
they trusted to any thing but their own valour, or gave
that enemy an opportunity of taking revenge for the
many insults and indignities, which they had of late put
upon him. He reminded them of the apparent supe∣riority
which they had hitherto maintained over all the
bodies of French troops who had fallen in their way;
and assured them, that the greater numbers of the army,
which at present hovered over them, gave them not
greater force, but was an advantage easily compensated
by the order, in which he had placed his own army,
and the resolution which he expected from them. He
demanded nothing, he said, but that they would imitate
his own example, and that of the prince of Wales; and
as the honour, the lives, the liberties of all, were now
exposed to the same danger, he was consident, that they
would make one common effort to extricate themselves
from the present difficulties, and that their united cou∣rage
would give them the victory over all their enemies.</P>
<P>IT is related by some historians<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jean Villani, lib. 12. cap. 66.</NOTE>, that Edward, be∣sides
the resources, which he found in his own genius
and presence of mind, employed also a new invention
against the enemy, and placed in his front same pieces
of artillery, the first which had yet been made use of on
and remarkable occasion in Europe. This is the epoch
of one of the most singular discoveries, which has been
made among men; and which changed by degrees the
whole art of war, and by consequence many circum∣stances
in the political government of Europe. But the
ignorance of that age, in the mechanical arts, rendered
the progress very slow of this new invention. The ar∣tillery
first framed, were so clumsy and of such difficult

<PB N="446" REF="477"/>
management, that men were not immediately sensible of
their use and efficacy: And even to the present times,
improvements have been continually making on this fu∣rious
engine, which, tho' it seemed contrived for the
destruction of mankind, and the overthrow of empires,
has in the issue rendered war much less bloody, and has
given greater stability to civil societies. Nations, by its
means, have been brought more to a level: Conquests
have become ess frequent and rapid: Success in war has
been reduced nearly to be a matter of calculation: And any
nation, overmatched by its enemy, either yields to their
demands, or secures itself by alliances against their vio∣lence
and invasion.</P>
<P>THE invention of artillery was at this time known in
France as well as in England<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Du Cange Gloss. in verb. <HI>Bombarda.</HI></NOTE>; but Philip, in his hurry
to overtake the enemy, had probably left his cannon be∣hind
him, which he regarded as an useless incumbrance.
All his other movements discovered the same imprudence
and precipitation. Impelled by anger, a dangerous coun∣sellor,
and trusting to the great superiority of his num∣bers,
he thought that all depended on forcing an engage∣ment
with the English, and that, if he could once reach
the enemy in their retreat, the victory on his side was
certain and inevitable. He made a hasty march in great
disorder from Abbeville; but after he had advanced above
two leagues, some gentlemen, whom he had sent before
to take a view of the enemy, returned to him, and brought
him intelligence, that they had seen the English drawn
up in excellent order, and awaiting his arrival. They
therefore advised him to defer the combat till the ensuing
day, when his army would have recovered from their
fatigue, and might be disposed into better order, than
their present hurry had permitted them to observe. Phi∣lip
assented to this council; but the former precipitation
<PB N="447" REF="478"/>
of his march, and the impatience of the French nobility,
made it impracticable for him to put it in execution.
One division pressed upon another: Orders to stop were
not seasonably conveyed to all of them: This immense
body was not governed by sufficient discipline to be ma∣nageable:
And the French army, very imperfectly
formed into three lines, arrived, already fatigued and dif∣ordered,
in presence of the enemy. The first line, con∣sisting
of 15,000 Genoefe cross-bow men, were com∣manded
by Anthony Doria, and Charles Grimaldi: The
second was led by the count d'Alençon, brother to the
King: The King himself was at the head of the third.
Besides the French monarch, there were no less than
three crowned heads in this engagement: The King of
Bohemia, the King of the Romans, his son, and the
King of Majorca; with all the nobility and great vassals
of the crown of France. The army now consisted of
above 120,000 men, near four times the number of the
enemy. But the prudence of one man was superior to
the advantage of all this force and splendor.</P>
<P>THE English, on the approach of the enemy, kept
their ranks firm and immoveable; and the Genoefe first
began the attack. There had happened, a little before
the engagement, a thunder shower, which had moistened
and relaxed the strings of the Genoese cross-bows; and
their arrows for this reason fell short of the enemy. The
English archers, taiking their bows out of their cafes,
poured in a shower of arrows upon this multitude who
were opposed to them; and soon threw them into disor∣der.
The Genoese fell back upon the gens d'armes of
the count d'Alen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 130.</NOTE>; who, enraged at their cowardice,
ordered his troops to put them to the sword. The artil∣lery
fired amidst the crowd; the English archers still
continued to send in their arrows among them; and
<PB N="448" REF="479"/>
nothing was to be seen in that vast body but hurry and
confusion, terror and dismay. The young prince of
Wales had the presence of mind to take advantage of this
situation, and to lead on his line to the charge. The
French cavalry, however, recovering somewhat their
order, and encouraged by the example of their leader
made stout resistance; and having at last cleared them∣selves
of the Genoese runaways, advanced upon their ad∣versaries,
and by their superior numbers began to hem
them round. The earls of Arundel and Northampton
advanced their line to sustain the prince, who, ardent in
his first seats of arms, set an example of valour, which
was imitated by all his followers. The battle became
for some time hot and dangerous, and the earl of War∣wic,
apprehensive of the event from the superior numbers
of the French, dispatched an officer to the King, and
desired him to send succours to the relief of the prince.
Edward had chosen his station on the top of the hill; and
he surveyed in tranquillity the scene of action. When the
messenger accosted him, his first question was, whether the
prince was slain or wounded. On receiving an answer in
the negative, <HI>Return,</HI> said he, <HI>to my son and tell him that I
reserve the honour of this day to him: I am confident that he
will show himself worthy of the honour of knighthood, which I
so lately conferred upon him: He will be able without my
assistance to repel the enemy</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 130.</NOTE>. This speech, being re∣ported
to the prince and his attendants, inspired them
with new courage: They made an attack with redoubled
vigour on the French, in which the count d'Alen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on
was slain: That whole line of cavalry was thrown into
disorder: The riders were killed or dismounted: The
Welsh infantry rushed into the throng, and with their
long knives cut the throats of all who had fallen;
nor was any quarter given that day by the conquerors<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 130.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="480"/>
THE King of France advanced in vain with the rear
to sustain the line commanded by his brother: He
found them already discomfited; and the example of
their rout encreased the confusion, which was before but
too prevalent in his own body. He had himself a horse
killed under him: He was remounted; and, tho' left
almost alone, he seemed still determined to maintain the
combat; when John de Hainault seized the reins of his
bridle, turned about his horse, and carried him off the
field of battle. The whole French army took to flight,
and were followed and put to the sword without mercy
by the victors; till the darkness of night put an end to
the pursuit. The King, on his return to the camp, flew
into the arms of the prince of Wales, and exclaimed:
<HI>My brave son: Persevere in your honourable course: You are
my son; for valiantly have you acquitted yourself to day: You
have shewn yourself worthy of empire</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 131.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS battle, which is known by the name of the bat∣tle
of Crecy, began after three o'clock in the afternoon,
and continued till evening. The next morning was
foggy; and as the English observed, that many of the
enemy had lost their way in the night and in the mist,
they employed a stratagem to bring them into their
power: They erected on the eminences some French
standards which they had taken in the battle; and all,
who were allured by this false signal, were put to the
sword, and no quarter given them. In excuse for this
inhumanity, it was alledged that the French King had
given out like orders to his troops; but the real reason
probably was, that the English, in their present situation,
did not care to be encumbered with prisoners. On the
day of battle, and on the ensuing, there fell, by a mo∣derate
computation, 1200 knights, 1400 gentlemen,
4000 men at arms, besides about 30,000 men of inferior
<PB N="450" REF="481"/>
rank<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 131. Knyghton, p. 2588.</NOTE>. Many of the principal nobility of France, the
dukes of Lorraine and Bourbon, the earls of Flanders,
Blois, Harcourt, Vaudemont, Aumale, were left on the
field of battle. The Kings also of Bohemia and Ma∣jorca
were slain: The fate of the former was remark∣able:
He was blind from age; but being resolved to
hazard his person, and set an example to others, he or∣dered
the reins of his bridle to be tied on each side to
the horses of two gentlemen of his train; and his dead
body, and those of his attendants, were afterwards found
among the slain, with their hoises standing by them in
that situation<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 130. Walsingham, p. 166.</NOTE>. His crest was three ostrich feathers;
and his motto these German words, <HI>Ich dien, I serve:</HI>
Which the prince of Wales and his successors adopted in
memorial of this great victory. The action may seem
no less remarkable for the small loss of the English than
for the great slaughter of the French: There were killed
in it only one esquire and three knights<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2588.</NOTE>, and very few,
of inferior rank; a demonstration, that the prudent dis∣position
made by Edward, and the disorderly attack of
the French, had rendered the whole rather a rout than a
battle, which was indeed the common case with engage∣ments
in those times.</P>
<P>THE great prudence of Edward appeared not only in
obtaining this memorable victory, but in the measures,
which he pursued after it. Not elated by his present
prosperity so far as to expect the total conquest of France
or of any considerable provinces; he proposed only to
secure an easy entrance into that kingdom, which might
afterwards open the way to more moderate advantages.
He knew the extreme distance of Guienne: He had ex∣perienced
the difficulty and uncertainty of penetrating on
<PB N="451" REF="482"/>
the side of the Low Countries, and had already lost
much of his authority over Flanders by the death of Ar∣tevilie,
who had been murdered by the populace them∣selves,
his former partizans, on his attempting to transfer
the sovereignty of that province to the prince of Wales<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 116.</NOTE>.
The King, therefore, limited his ambition to the con∣quest
of Calais; and after the interval of a few days,
which he employed in interring the slain, he marched
with his victorious army, and presented himself before
that place.</P>
<P>JOHN DE VIENNE, a valiant knight of Burgundy,
was governor of Calais, and being supplied with every
thing necessary for defence, he encouraged the townsmen
to perform to the utmost their duty to their King and
country. Edward therefore, sensible srom the begin∣ning,
that it was in vain to attempt the place by force,
proposed only to reduce it by famine: He chose a secure
station for his camp; drew entrenchments around the
whole city; raised huts for his soldiers, which he covered
with straw or broom; and provided his army with all
conveniencies, to make them endure the winter season,
which was approaching. As the governor soon perceived
his intention, he put out all the useless mouths, which
might consume his provisions; and the King had the
generosity to allow these unhappy people to pass thro' his
camp, and he even supplied them with money for their
journey<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 133.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Edward was employed in this siege, which
continued near a twelvemonth, there passed in different
places many other events; and all to the honour of the
English arms.</P>
<P>THE retreat of the duke of Normandy from Guienne
left the earl of Derby master of the field; and he was not
<PB N="452" REF="483"/>
negligent in making his advantage of the superiority.
He took Mirebeau by assault: He made himself master of
Lusignan in the same manner: Taillebourg and St. Jean
d'Angeli fell into his hands: Poictiers opened its gates to
him; and Derby having thus broke down all the fron∣tiers
on that quarter, carried his incursions to the banks
of the Loire, and filled that quarter of France with hor∣rour
and devastation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 136.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE flames of war were at the same time kindled in
Brittany. Charles de Blois invaded that province with
a considerable army, and invested the fortress of Roche
de Rien; but the countess of Mountfort, reinforced by
some English troops under Sir Thomas Dagworth, at∣tacked
him during the night in his entrenchments, dis∣persed
his army, and took himself prisoner<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 143. Walsingham, p. 168. Ypod. Neust. p. 517, 518.</NOTE>. His
wife, by whom he enjoyed his pretensions to Brittany, com∣pelled
by the present necessity, took on her the govern∣ment
of the party, and proved herself a rival in every
shape and an antagonist to the countess of Mountfort,
both in the field and in the cabinet. And while these
heroic dames presented this extraordinary scene to the

virtue.</P>
<P>THE Scottish nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> after long supporting, with in∣credible
perseverance, their liberties against the superior
force of the English, recalled their King, David Bruce,
in 1342. Tho' that prince, neither by his age nor ca∣pacity,
could bring them great assistance, he gave them
the countenance of sovereign authority; and as Edward's
wars with France proved a great diversion to his forces,
they rendered the balance more equal between the two
<PB N="453" REF="484"/>
kingdoms. In all the truces, which Edward concluded
with Philip, the King of Scotland was comprehended;
and when Edward made his last invasion upon France,
David was strongly solicited by his ally to break also the
truce, and to invade the northern counties of England.
The nobility of his nation being always forward in such
incursions, David soon mustered a great army, entered
Northumberland at the head of above 50,000 men, and
carried his ravages and devastations to the gates of Dur∣ham<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 137.</NOTE>.
But queen Philippa, assembling a body of little
more than 12,000 men<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 138.</NOTE>, which she entrusted to the
command of lord Piercy, ventured to approach him at
Neville's Cross near that city; and riding thro' the ranks
of the army, exhorted every man to do his duty, and to
take revenge on these barbarous ravagers<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 138.</NOTE>: Nor could
she be persuaded to leave the field, till the armies were
on the point of engaging.<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th Octr.</NOTE> The Scots have been often
unfortunate in the great pitched battles, which they
fought with the English; and that tho' they commonly
declined such engagements where the superiority of num∣bers
was not on their side: But never did they receive a
more fatal blow than the present. They were broke and
chaced off the field: Fifteen thousand of them, some
historians say twenty thousand, were slain; among whom
were Edward Keith, earl Mareschal, and Sir Thomas
Charteris, chancellor:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captivity of the King of Scots.</NOTE> And the King himself was taken
prisoner, with the earls of Southerland, Fife, Monteith,
Carric, lord Douglas, and many other noblemen<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 139.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PHILIPPA, having secured her royal prisoner in the
Tower<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. v. p. 537.</NOTE>, crossed the sea at Dover; and was received in
the English camp before Calais with all the triumph,
which was due to her rank, her merit, and her success.
<PB N="454" REF="485"/>
This age was the reign of chivalry and gallantry: Ed∣ward's
court excelled in these accomplifhments as much
as in policy and arms: And if any thing could justify the
obsequious devotion then professed to the fair sex, it
must be the appearance of such extraordinary women as
shone forth during that period.</P>
<P>THE town of Calais had been defended with remark∣able
vigilance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1347.</NOTE> constancy and bravery by the townsmen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calais taken.</NOTE>
during a siege of unusual length: But Philip, informed
of their distrest condition, determined at last to attempt
their relief; and he approached the Englilh with an im∣mense
army, which the writers of that age make amount
to 200,000 men. But he found Edward so surrounded
with morasses, and secured by entrenchments, that with∣out
running on inevitable destruction, he concluded it
impossible to make an attempt on the English camp. He
had no other resource than to send his rival a vain chal∣lenge
to meet him in the open field; which being re∣fused,
he was obliged to decamp with his army, and dif∣perse
them into their several provinces<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. Chap. 144, 145. Avesbury, p. 161. 162.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JOHN DE VIENNE, the governor of Calais, now saw
the necessity of surrendering his fortress, which was re∣duced
to the last extremity by famine and the fatigue of
the inhabitants. He appeared on the walls, and made a
signal to the English sentinels that he desired a conference.
Sir Walter Manny was sent to him by Edward. “Brave
knight,” cried the governor, “I have been entrusted
by my sovereign with the command of this town: It
is almost a year since you besieged me; and I have
endeavoured, as well as those under me, to do our
duty. But you are acquainted with our present con∣dition:
We have no hopes of relief; we are perishing
with hunger; I am willing therefore to surrender, and
<PB N="455" REF="486"/>
desire, as the sole condition, to ensure the lives and
liberties of these brave men, who have so long shared
with me every danger and fatigue<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 146.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>MANNY replied, that he was well acquainted with
the King of England's intentions; that that prince was
incensed against the townsmen of Calais for their perti∣nacious
resistance, and for the evils which they had made
him and his subjects suffer; that he was determined to
take exemplary vengeance of them; and would not re∣ceive
the town on any conditions which should consine
him in the punishment of these offenders. “Consider,”
replied Vienne, “that this is not the treatment to which
brave men are intitled: If any English knight had been
in my situation, your King would have expected the
same conduct from him. The inhabitants of Calais
have done for their sovereign what merits the esteem
of every prince; much more of so gallant a prince as
Edward. But I inform you, that, if we must perish,
we shall not perish unrevenged; and that we are not
yet so reduced, but we can sell our lives at a high
price to the victors. It is the interest of both sides to
prevent these desperate extremities; and I expect, that
you yourself, brave knight, will interpose your good
offices with your prince in our behalf.”</P>
<P>MANNY was struck with the justness of these senti∣ments,
and represented to the King the danger of repri∣zals,
if he should give such treatment to the inhabitants
of Calais. Edward was at last persuaded to mitigate the
rigor of the conditions demanded: He only insisted, that
six of the most considerable citizens should be sent him
to be disposed of as he thought proper; that they should
come to his camp carrying the keys of the city in their
hands, bareheaded and barefooted, with ropes about
<PB N="456" REF="487"/>
their necks: And on these conditions, he promised to
spare the lives of all the remainder<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 146.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN this intelligence was conveyed to Calais, it
struck the inhabitants with new consternation. To sa∣crifice
six of their fellow citizens to certain destruction,
for signalizing their valour in a common cause, appeared
to them even more severe than that general punishment,
with which they were before threatened; and they found
themselves incapable of coming to any resolution in so
cruel and distressful a situation. At last one of the prin∣cipal
inhabitants called Eustace de St. Pierre, whose
name deserves to be recorded, stept forth, and declared
himself willing to encounter death for the safety of his
friends and companions: Another, animated by his ex∣ample,
made a like generous offer: A third and a fourth
presented themselves to the same fate; and the whole
number required was soon compleated. These six he∣roic
burgesses appeared before Edward in the guise of ma∣lefactors,
laid at his feet the keys of their city, and were
ordered to be led to execution. It is surprizing, that so
generous a prince should ever have entertained such a
barbarous purpose against such men; and still more that
he should seriously persist in the resolution of executing
it<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">This story of the six burghers of Calais, like all other extraordinary stories, is somewhat to be suspected; and so much the more as Aves∣bury, p. 167, who is particular in his narration of the surrender of Calais, says nothing of it; and on the contrary extols in general the King's generosity and lenity to the inhabitants.</NOTE>. But the entreaties of his queen saved his memory
from that infamy: She threw herself on her knees before
him, and with tears in her eyes begged the lives of these
citizens. Having obtained her request, the carried them
into her tent, ordered a repast to be set before them, and
<PB N="457" REF="488"/>
after making. them a present of money and cloaths, dis∣missed
them in safety<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 146.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King took possession of Calais;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Aug.</NOTE> and immediately
executed an act of rigor, more justifiable because more
necessary, than that which he had before resolved on.
He knew, that, notwithstanding his pretended title to
the crown of France, every Frenchman regarded him
as a mortal enemy; and he therefore ordered all the in∣habitants
of Calais to evacuate the town, and he peopled
it anew with English; a policy which probably preserved
so long to his successors the dominion of that important
fortress. He made it the staple of wool, leather, tin,
and lead; the four chief, if not the sole commodities of
the kingdom, for which there was any considerable de∣mand
in foreign markets. All the English were obliged
to bring thither these goods: Foreign merchants came to
the same place in order to purchase them: And at a period,
when posts were not established, and when the
communication between states was so imperfect, this in∣stitution,
tho' it hurt the navigation of England, was per∣haps
of advantage to the kingdom.</P>
<P>THRO' the mediation of the Pope's legates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1348.</NOTE> Edward
concluded a truce with France; but even during this
cessation of arms, he had very nearly lost Calais, the sole
fruit of all his boasted victories. The King had entrusted
that place to the command of Aimery de Pavie, an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣lian,
who had discovered bravery and conduct in the wars,
but was utterly devoid of every principle of honour and
sidelity. This man agreed to deliver up Calais for the
sum of 20,000 crowns; and Geoffrey de Charni, who
commanded the French forces in those quarters, and
who knew, that, if he succeeded in this service, he
should not be disavowed, ventured, without consulting
<PB N="458" REF="489"/>
his master, to conclude the bargain with him. Edward,
informed of this treachery, by means of Aimery's secre∣tary,
summoned the governor to London on other pre∣tences;
and having charged him with the guilt, pro∣mised
him his life, but on condition, that he would turn
the contrivance to the destruction of the enemy. The
Italian easily agreed to this double treachery. A day was
appointed for the admission of the French; and Edward,
having prepared a force of about a thousand men, under
Sir Walter Manny, secretly departed from London, car∣rying
with him the prince of Wales; and without being
suspected, arrived the evening before at Calais. He
made a proper disposition for the reception of the enemy;
and kept all his forces and the garrison under arms. On
the appearance of Charni, a chosen troop of French sol∣diers
was admitted at the postern, and Aimery, receiving
the stipulated sum, promised, that with their assistance
he would immediately open the great gate to the army,
who were waiting with impatience for the fulfilling of his
engagement. All the French, who entered, were im∣mediately
slain or taken prisoners: The great gate open∣ed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1349.</NOTE>
Edward rushed forth with cries of battle and of
victory:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st Jan.</NOTE> The French, tho' astonished at this event, be∣haved
with valour: A fierce and bloody engagement
ensued. As the morning broke, the King, who was
not distinguished by his arms, and who fought as a pri∣vate
man under the standard of Sir Walter Manny, re∣marked
a French gentleman, called Eustace de Ribau∣mont,
who exerted himself with singular vigour and
bravery; and he was seized with a desire of trying a
single combat with him. He stept forth from his troop,
and challenging Ribaumont by name, (for he was known
to him) began a sharp and dangerous encounter. He
was twice beat to the ground by the valour of the French∣man:
He twice recovered himself: Blows were redou∣bled
<PB N="459" REF="490"/>
with equal force on both sides: The victory was
long undecided: Till Ribaumont, perceiving himself to
be left almost alone, called out to his antagonist, <HI>Sir
knight, I yield myself your prisoner;</HI> and at the same
time delivered his sword to the King. Most of the
French, being overpowered by numbers, and intercepted
in their retreat, were either slain or taken prisoners<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv, 1. chap. 140, 141, 142.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE French officers, who had. fallen into the hands
of the English, were conducted into Calais; where Ed∣ward
discovered to them the antagonist with whom they
had had the honour to be engaged, and treated them
with great regard and courtesy. They were admitted to
sup with the prince of Wales, and the English nobility;
and after supper, the King himself came into the apart∣ment,
and went about, conversing familiarly with one
or other of his prisoners. He even addressed himself in
an obliging manner to Charni, and avoided reproaching
him with the treacherous attempt, which he had made
upon Calais during the truce: But he openly bestowed
the highest encomiums on Ribaumont; called him the
most valorous knight whom he had ever been acquainted
with; and confessed, that he had at no time been in so
great danger as when engaged in combat with him.
He then took a string of pearl, which he wore about his
own head, and throwing it over the head of Ribaumont,
he said to him, “Sir Eustace, I bestow this present upon
you, as a testimony of my esteem for your bravery:
And I desire you to wear it a year for my sake: I know
you to be gay and amorous; and to take delight in
the company of ladies and damsels: Let them all know
from what hand you had the present: You are no
longer a prisoner; I acquit you of your ransom; and
you are at liberty to morrow to dispose of yourself as
you think proper.”</P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="491"/>
NOTHING can more evidently prove the vast superio∣rity
of the nobility and gentry above all the other orders
of men during those ages, than the extreme difference
which Edward made in his treatment of these French
knights, and that of the six citizens of Calais, who had
exerted much more signal bravery in a cause much more
justifiable and more honourable.</P>

<P>THE prudent conduct and great success of Edward
in his foreign wars had excited a strong emulation
and a military genius among the English nobility;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XVI.</NOTE>
and these turbulent barons, over―awed by the crown, gave
now a more useful direction to their ambition, and at∣tached
themselves to a prince, who led them to the ac∣quisition
of glory and of riches. That he might further
promote the spirit of emulation and obedience, the King
instituted the order of the garter, in imitation of some
orders of a like nature, religious as well as military,
which had been established in different countries of Eu∣rope.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Institution of the gar∣ter.</NOTE>
The number received into this order consisted of
twenty-four persons, besides the sovereign; and as it has
never been enlarged, this badge of distinction continues
as honourable as at its first institution, and is still a
valuable, tho' a cheap, present, which the prince can
confer on his greatest subjects. A vulgar story prevails,
but is not supported by any antient authority, that, at
a court-ball, Edward's mistress, commonly supposed to
<PB N="462" REF="493"/>
be the countess of Salisbury, dropt her garter; and the
King, taking it up, observed some of the courtiers to
smile, as if he had not obtained this favour merely by
accident: Upon which he called out, <HI>Honi soit qui
mal y pense,</HI> Evil to him that evil thinks; and as
every incident of gallantry among these antient warriors
was magnisied into a matter of great importance<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">There was a singular instance about this time of the prevalance of chivalry and gallantry in the nations of Europe. A solemn duel of thirty knights against thirty was fought between Bembrough, an English∣man, and Beaumonoir, a Breton, of the party of Charles de Blois. The knights of the two nations came into the field; and before the combat began, Beaumonoir called out, that it would be seen that day <HI>who had the fairest mistresses.</HI> After a bloody combat the Bretons pre∣vailed; and gained for their prize, full liberty to boast of their mistresses; beauty. It is remarkable, that two such famous generals as sir Robert Knolles, and sir Hugh Calverley, drew their swords in this ridiculous contest. See Pere Daniel, vol. ii. p. 536, 537, &amp;c. The women not only instigated the champions to these rough, if not bloody <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rays of tournament; but also frequented the tournaments during all the reign of Edward, whose spirit of gallantry encouraged this practsice. See Kny<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hton. p. 2597.</NOTE>, he
instituted the order of the garter in memorial of this
event, and gave these words as the motto of the order.
This origin, tho' frivolous, is not unsuitable to the man∣ners
of the times; and it is indeed difficult by any other
means to account either for the seemingly unmeaning
terms of the motto, or for the peculiar badge of the
garter, which seems to have no reference to any purpose
either of military use or ornament.</P>
<P>BUT a sudden damp was thrown over this festivity and
triumph of the court of England, by a destructive pesti∣lence,
which invaded that kingdom as well as the rest of
Europe; and is computed to have swept away near a
third of the inhabitants in evert country, which it attack∣ed.
It was probably more fatal in great cities than in
<PB N="463" REF="494"/>
the country; and above fifty thousand souls are said to
have perished by it in London alone<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stowe's Survey, p. 478. There were buried 50,000 bodies in one church-yard, which sir Walter Manny had bought for the use of the poor. The same author says, that there died above 50,000 persons of the plague in Norwich, which is quite incredible.</NOTE>. This malady dis∣covered
itself first in the north of Asia, was spread over
all that country, made a progress from one end of Europe
to another, and sensibly depopulated every state thro'
which it passed. So grievous a calamity, more than any
cordiality among the princes, served to maintain and pro∣long
the truce between France and England.</P>
<P>DURING this truce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1350</NOTE> Philip de Valois died, without
being able to re-establish the affairs of France, which his
bad success against England had thrown into the most ex∣treme
disorder. This monarch, during the first years of
his reign, had obtained the appellation of <HI>Fortunate,</HI> and
acquired the character of prudent; but he ill maintained
either the one or the other; less from his own fault, than
because he was over-matched by the superior fortune and
superior genius of Edward. But the incidents in the
reign of his son, John, gave the French nation
reason to regret even the calamitous times of his prede∣cessor.
John was distinguished by many virtues, par∣ticularly
a scrupulous honour and sidelity: He was not
deficient in personal courage: But as he wanted that
masterly prudence and foresight, which his difficult situ∣ation
required, his kingdom was at the same time torn
in pieces by intestine commotions, and oppressed with
foreign wars.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1354.</NOTE> The chief fource of all its calamities,
was Charles King of Navarre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> who received the epithet
of the <HI>bad</HI> or <HI>wicked,</HI> and whose actions fully entitled
him to that appellation. This prince was descended by
males of the blood royal of France; his mother was a
daughter of Lewis Hutin; he had himself espoused a
<PB N="464" REF="495"/>
daughter of King John: But all these ties, which ought
to have connected him with the throne, gave him only
greater ability to shake and overthrow it. In his per∣sonal
qualities, he was courteous, affable, engaging, elo∣quent;
full of insinuation and address; inexhaustible in
his resources; active and enterprizing. But these splen∣did
accomplishments were at the same time attended with
such defects, as rendered them pernicious to his country,
and even ruinous to himself: He was sickle, inconstant,
faithless, revengeful, malicious: Restrained by no prin∣ciple
or duty: Insatiable in his pretensions: And whether
successful or unfortunate in one enterprize, he immedi∣ately
undertook another, in which he was never deterred
from employing the most criminal and most dishonourable
expedients.</P>
<P>THE constable d'Eu, who had been taken prisoner by
Edward at Caen, recovered his liberty, on the promise
of delivering to that prince, as his ransom, the town of
Ghisnes, near Calais, of, which he was superior lord:
But as John was offended at this stipulation, which, if
fulfilled, opened still farther that frontier to the enemy,
and as he suspected the constable of more dangerous con∣nections
with the King of England, he ordered him to
be seized, and without any legal or formal trial, put him
to death in prison. Charles de la Cerda was appointed
constable in his place; and had a like fatal end: The
King of Navarre ordered him to be assassinated; and such
was the weakness of the crown, that this prince, instead
of dreading punishment, would not so much as agree to
ask pardon for his offence, but on condition, that he
received an accession of territory, and had John's second
son put into his hands, as a security for his person, when
he came to court, and persormed this act of mock penitence
and humiliation before King John<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 144.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="496"/>
THE two French princes seemed entirely reconciled;
but this dissimulation, to which John submitted from
necessity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1355.</NOTE> and Charles from habit, did not long continue;
and the King of Navarre knew, that he had reason to
apprehend the most severe vengeance for the many crimes
and treasons which he had already committed, and the
still greater, which he intended to commit. To ensure
himself of protection, he entered into a secret correspon∣dence
with England, by means of Henry earl of Derby,
how earl of Lancaster, who at that time was employed
in fruitless negotiations for peace in Avignon, under the
mediation of the Pope. John discovered this correspon∣dence;
and to prevent the fatal effects of it, he sent down
forces into Normandy, the chief seat of the King of Na∣varre's
power, and attacked his castles and fortresses.
But hearing that Edward had prepared an army to support
his ally, he had the weakness to propose an accommodation
with Charles, and even to give this traiterous subject the
sum of a hundred thousand crowns, as the purchase of a
feigned reconcilement, which rendered him still more
dangerous. The King of Navarre, insolent from past
impunity, and desperate from the dangers, which he ap∣prehended,
continued still his intrigues; and associating
himself with Geoffrey de Harcourt, who had received his
pardon from Philip de Valois, but persevered still in his
factious dispositions, he encreased the number of his par∣tizans
in every part of the kingdom. He even seduced
by his address, Charles, the King of France's eldest son,
a youth of seventeen years of age, who was the first that
bore the appellation of Dauphin, by the re-union of the
province of Dauphiny to the crown. But this prince,
being made sensible of the danger and solly of these con∣nexions,
promised to make atonement for the offence by
the sacrifice of his associates; and in concert with his
father, he invited the King of Navarre, and other noble∣men
<PB N="466" REF="497"/>
of the party, to a feast at Roüen, where
they were betrayed into the hands of John. Some of the most ob∣noxious
were immediately led to execution; the King
of Navarre was thrown into prison<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 146. Avesbury, p. 243.</NOTE>: But this stroke of
severity in the King, and of treachery in the Dauphin,
was far from proving decisive in maintaining the royal
authority. Philip of Navarre, brother to Charles, and
Geoffrey d'Harcourt, put all the towns and castles be∣longing
to that prince in a posture of defence; and had
immediate recourse to the protection of England in this
desperate extremity.</P>
<P>THE truce between the two kingdoms, which had
always been very ill observed on both sides, was now
expired; and Edward was entirely free to support the
French malecontents. Well pleased, that the factions
in France had at last gained him some partizans in that
kingdom, which his pretensions to the crown had never
been able to procure him, he proposed to attack his
enemy both on the side of Guienne, under the command
of the prince of Wales, and on that of Calais, in his
own person.</P>
<P>YOUNG Edward arrived in the Garronne with his
army, on board a fleet of three hundred sail, attended
by the earls of Warwic, Salisbury, Oxford, Suffolk, and
other English noblemen. Being joined by the vassals of
Gascony, he took the field; and as the present disorders
in John's affairs prevented every proper plan of defence,
he carried on with impunity his ravages and devastations,
according to the mode of war in that age. He reduced
all the villages and several towns in Languedoc to ashes:
He presented himself before Thouloufe; passed the
Garronne, and burned the suburbs of Carcassonne; ad∣vanced
even to Narbonne, laying every thing waste around
<PB N="467" REF="498"/>
him: And after an incursion of fix weeks, returned with
a vast booty and many prisoners to Guienne, where he
took up his winter quarters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 144, 146.</NOTE>
. The constable of Bourbon,
who commanded in those provinces, received orders,
though at the head of a superior army, on no account to
run the hazard of a battle.</P>
<P>THE King of England's incursion from Calais was of
the same nature, and attended with the same issue. He
broke into France at the head of a numerous army; to
whom he gave a full licence of plundering and ravaging
the open country. He advanced to St. Omer, where the
King of France was posted; and on the retreat of that
prince, followed him to Hesdin<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. Chap. 144. Avesbury, p. 206. Walsing. p. 171.</NOTE>. John still kept at a
distance, and declined an engagement: But in order to
save his reputation, he sent Edward a challenge to fight
a pitched battle with him; an usual bravade in that age,
derived from the practice of single combat, and ridiculous
in the art of war. The King, finding no sincerity
in this defiance, retired to Calais, and thence went over to
England, in order to defend that kingdom against a
threatened invasion of the Scots.</P>
<P>THE Scots, taking advantage of the King's absence,
and that of the military power of England, had surprized
Berwic; and had collected an army with a view of
entering and committing ravages upon the northern pro∣vinces:
But on the approach of Edward, they abandoned
that place, which was not tenable, while the castle was
in the hands of the English; and retiring to their moun∣tains,
gave the enemy a full liberty of burning and
destroying the whole country from Berwic to Edinburgh<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 171.</NOTE>.
Baliol attended Edward on this expedition; but finding,
that his constant adherence to the English had given his
<PB N="468" REF="499"/>
countrymen an unconquerable aversion to his title, and
that he himself was declining through age and infirmities,
he finally resigned into the King's hands his pretensions
to the crown of Scotland<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. v. p. 823. Ypod Neust. p. 521.</NOTE>, and received in lieu of them
an annual pension of 2000 pounds, with which he passed
the remainder of his life in privacy and retirement.</P>
<P>DURING these military operations, Edward received
information of the encreasing disorders in France, arising
from the seizure of the King of Navarre; and he sent Lan∣caster
at the head of a small army, to support his partizans in
Normandy. The war was conducted with various success;
but chiefly to the disadvantage of the French malecon∣tents;
till an important event happened in the other
quarter of the kingdom, which had well nigh proved fatal
to the monarchy of France, and threw every thing into
the utmost confusion.</P>
<P>THE prince of Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1356.</NOTE> encouraged by the success of
the preceding campaign, took the field with an army,
which no historian makes amount to above 12,000 men,
and of Which not a third were English; and with this
small body, he ventured to penetrate into the heart of
France. After ravaging the Agenois, Quercy, and the
Limousin, he entered the province of Berry; and made
some attacks, tho' without success, on the towns of
Bourges and Issoudun. It appeared, that his intentions
were to march into Normandy, and to join his forces
with those of the duke of Lancaster, and the partizans of
the King of Navarre; but finding all the bridges on the
Loire broke down, and every pass carefully guarded, he
was obliged to think of making his retreat into Guienne<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 171.</NOTE>.
He found this resolutian the more necessary, from the
intelligence which he received of the King of France's
motions. That monarch, provoked at the insult offered
<PB N="469" REF="500"/>
him by this incursion, and entertaining hopes of success
from the young prince's temerity, collected a great army
of above 60,000 men, and advanced with hasty marches
to intercept his enemy. The prince, not aware of John's
near approach, lost some days, on his retreat, before
the castle of Remorantin<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv, 1. chap. 158. Walsing. p. 171.</NOTE>; and thereby gave the French
an opportunity of overtaking him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Poictiers.</NOTE> They came within
sight at Maupertuis near Poictiers; and Edward, sensible
that his retreat was now become impracticable, prepared
for battle with all the courage of a young hero, and with
all the prudence of the oldest and most experienced
commander.</P>
<P>BUT the utmost prudence and courage would have
proved insufficiert to save him in this extremity, had
the King of France known how to make use of his present
advantages. His vast superiority in numbers enabled
him to surround the enemy; and by intercepting all their
provisions, which were already become scarce in the
English camp, to reduce this small army, without a blow,
to the necessity of surrendering at discretion. But such
was the impatient ardour of the French nobility, and so
much had their thoughts been bent on overtaking the
English as their sole object, that this idea never struck
any of the commanders; and they immediately prepared
themselves for the assault, as for a certain victory. while
the French army was drawn. up in order of battle, they
were slopped by the appearance of the cardinal of Perigord;
who, having learned the approach of the two armies to
each other, had hastened, by interposing his good offices,
to prevent any farther effusion of Christian blood. By
John's permission, he carried proposals to the prince of
Wales; and found him so sensible of the bad posture
of his affairs, that an accommodation seemed not im∣practicable.
Edward told him, that he would agree to
<PB N="470" REF="501"/>
any terms consistent with his own honour and that of
England; and he offered to purchase a retreat by resgn∣ing
all the conquests, which he had made during this
and the former campaign, and by stipulating not to serve
against France during the course of seven years. But
John, imagining that he had now got into his hands a
sufficient pledge for the restitution of Calais, required
that Edward should surrender himself prisoner with a
hundred of his attendants; and offered on these terms a
sase retreat to the English army. The prince rejected
the proposal with disdain; and declared, that whatever
fortune sshould attend him, England should never be
obliged to pay the price of his ranssom. This resolute
answer cut off all hopes of accommodation; but as the
day was already spent in negociating, the battle was
delayed till the next morning<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Froiffart, liv. 1. Chap. 161.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE cardinal of Perigord, as all the prelates of the
court of Rome, was extremely attached to the French
cause; but the most determined enemy could not have
contrived a greater prejudice to John's affairs, than he
did them by this delay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th Sept.</NOTE> The prince of Wales had
leisure, during the night, to strengthen, by new intrench∣ments,
the pot which he had before so judiciously chosen;
and he contrived an ambush of 300 men at arms, and as
many archers, whom he put under the command of the
Captal de Buche, and ordered to make a circuit, that
they might fall on the flank or rear of the French army
during the engagement. The van of his army was
commanded by the earl of Warwic, the rear by the earls
Salisbury and Suffolk, the main body by the prince him∣self.
The lords Chandos, Audelcy, and many other
brave and experienced commanders, were at the head of
different corps of his army.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="502"/>
JOHN also arranged his forces in three divisions, nearly
equal: The first was commanded by the duke of Orleans,
the King's brother; the second by the Dauphin attended
with his two younger brothers; the third by the King
himself, who had by his side Philip, his fourth son and
favourite, then about fourteen years of age. There was
no reaching the English army but thro' a narrow lane,
covered on each fide by hedges; and in order to open
this passage, the mareschals, Andrehen and Clermont,
were ordered to advance with a separate detachment of
men at arms. While they marched along the lane, a
body of English archers, who lined the hedges, plyed
them on each side with their arrows; and being very
near them, yet placed in perfect safety, they coolly took
their aim against the enemy, and massacred them with
impunity. The French detachment, much discouraged
with, the unequal fight, and diminished in their number,
arrived at the end of the lane, where they met on the
open grounds the prince of Wales himself, at the head
of a chosen body, ready for their reception. They were
discomfited and overthrown: One of the mareschals was
slain; the other taken prisoner: And the remainder of
the detachment, who were still in the lane, and exposed
to the shot of the enemy, without being able to make
resistance, recoiled upon their own army, and put every
thing into disorder<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Floissart, liv. 1. Chap. 162.</NOTE>. In that critical moment, the Captal
de Buche unexpectedly appeared, and attacked in flank
the Dauphin's line, which fell into Tome confusion.
Landas, Bodenai, and St. Venant, to whom the care of
that young prince and his brothers had been committed,
too anxious for their charge or for their own safety,
carried them off the field of battle, and set the example
of flight, which was followed by that whole division.
The duke of Orleans, feized with a like panic, and
<PB N="472" REF="503"/>
imagining, all was lost, thought no longer of fighting,
but carried off his division by a retreat, which loon turn∣ed
also into a flight. The lord Chandos called out to
the prince, that the day was won; and encouraged him
to attack the division, under King John, which, tho'
more numerous than the whole English army, were
somewhat dismayed with the precipitate flight of their
companions. John here made the utmost efforts to re∣trieve
by his valour, what his imprudence had betrayed;
and the only resistance made that day was by his line of
battle. The prince of Wales fell with impetuosity on
some German cavalry placed in the front, and com∣manded
by the counts of Sallebruche, Nydo, and Nosto:
A fierce battle enfued: The one side were encouraged by
the near prospect of so great a victory: The other were
retained by the shane of quitting the field to an enemy
so much inferior: But the three German generals,
together with the duke of Athens, constable of France,
falling in battle, that body of cavalry gave way, and left
the King himself exposed to the whole fury of the enemy.
The ranks were every moment thinned around him:
The nobles fell by his fide, one after another: His son,
scarce fourteen years of age, received a wound, while
he was fighting valiantly in defence of his father: The
King himself, spent with fatigue, and overwhelmed by
numbers, might easily have been disspatched; but every
Englissh gentleman, ambitious of taking alive the royal
prisoner, spared him in the action, called to him to sur∣render
himsself, and offered him quarter: Several who
attempted to seize. him, suffered for their temerity. He
still cried out, <HI>Where is my cousin, the prince of Wales?</HI> and
seemed unwilling to become prisoner to any person of
inferior rank.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captivity of the King of France.</NOTE> But being told, that the prince was at a
the King of great disstance on the field, he threw down his gauntlet,
and yielded himself to Dennis de Morbec, a knight of
<PB N="473" REF="504"/>
Arras, who had been obliged to fly his country for murder.
His son was taken with him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 72, 154. Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 164.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE prince of Wales, who had been carried awy in
pursuit of the flying enemy, finding the field entirely
clear, had ordered a tent to be pitched, and was reposing
himself after the toils of battle; enquiring still with great
anxiety concerning the fate of the French monarch. He
dispatched the earl of Warwic to bring him intelligence,
and that nobleman came happily in time to save the life
of the captive prince, which was exposed to greater danger
than it had been during the heat of action. The English
had taken him by violence from Morbec: The Gascons
claimed the honour of detaining the prisoner: And some
brutal soldiers, rather than yield the prize to their rivals,
had threatened to put him to death<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 164.</NOTE>. Warwic overawed
both parties, and approaching the King with great de∣monstrations
of respect, offered to conduct him to the
prince's tent.</P>
<P>HERE commences the real and truly admirable heroism
of Edward: For victories are vulgar things in comparison
of that moderation and humanity discovered by a young
prince of twenty-seven years of age, not yet cooled from
the fury of battle, and elated by as extraordinary and
as unexpected success as had ever crowned the arms of
any general. He came forth to meet the captive King
with all the signs of regard and sympathy; administered
comfort to him amidst his misfortunes; paid him the
tribute of praise due to his valour; and ascribed his own
victory merely to the blind chance of war or to a superior
providence, which controuls all the efforts of human
force and prudence<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Poul. Oemil. p. 197.</NOTE>. The behaviour of John showed
him not unworthy of this courteous treatment: His pre∣sent
abject fortune never made him forget a moment that
<PB N="474" REF="505"/>
he was a King: More sensible to Edward's generosity
than to his own calamities, he confessed, that, notwith∣standing
his defeat and captivity, his honour was still
unimpared; and that, if he yielded the victory, it was at
least gained by a prince of such consummate valour and
humanity.</P>
<P>EDWARD ordered a magnificent repast to be prepared
in his tent for the prisoner; and he himself served the
royal captive's table, as if he had been one of his retinue:
He flood at the King's back during the meal; constantly
refused to take a place at table; and declared, that, being
a subject, he was too well acquainted with the distance
between his own rank, and that of royal majesty, to as∣sume
suck. freedom. All his father's pretensions to the
crown of France were now buried in oblivion: John in
captivity received the honours of a King, which were
refused him when seated on the throne: His misfortunes,
not his title, were respected: And the French prisoners,
conquered by this elevation of mind, more than by their
late discomfiture, burst out into tears of joy and admiration;
which were only checked by the reflection, that such ge∣nuine
and unaltered heroism in an enemy mull certainly
in the issue prove but the more dangerous to their native
country<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Froiffart, liv. 1. chap. 168.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the English and Gascon knights imitated the
generous example set them by their prince. The cap∣tives
were every where treated with humanity, and were
soon after dismissed on paying moderate ransoms to the
persons, into whose hands they had fallen. The extent
of their fortunes was considered, and no more was exacted
of them than what would still leave them sufficient to
enable them, for the future, to perform their military
service in a manner suitable to their rank and quality.
Yet so numerous were the noble prisoners, that these
<PB N="475" REF="506"/>
ransoms, joined to the spoils of the field, were sufficient
to enrich the prince's army; and as they had suffered
very little in the action, their joy and exultation was
complete.</P>
<P>THE prince of Wales conducted his prisoner to Bourdeaux; and not being provided of forces so numerous
as might enable him to push his present advantages, he
concluded a two years truce with France<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 3.</NOTE>, which was
also become requisite, that he might conduct the captive
King with safety into England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1357.</NOTE> He landed at Southwark,
and was met by a prodigious concourse of people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th May.</NOTE> of all
ranks and stations. The prisoner was clad in royal ap∣parel,
and mounted on a white steed, distinguished by its
size and beauty, and by the richness of its furniture.
The conqueror rode by his side in a meaner attire, and
carried by a black palfry. In this situation, much more
glorious than all the insolent parade of a Roman tri∣umph,
he passed thro' the streets of London, and presented
the King of France to his father, who advanced to meet
him, and received him with the same courtesy, as if he
had been a neighbouring potentate, who had voluntarily
come to pay him a friendly visit<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1, chap. 173.</NOTE>. It is impossible, in
reflecting on this noble conduct, not to perceive the
advantages which resulted from the otherwise whimsical
principles of chivalry, and which gave men in those rude
times some superiority even over people of a more culti∣vated
age and nation.</P>
<P>THE King of France, besides the generous treatment
which he met with in England, had the melancholy
consolation of the wretched, to see companions in afflic∣tion.
The King of Scots had been eleven years a cap∣tive
in Edward's hands; and the good fortune of this
monarch had reduced at once the two neighbouring
<PB N="476" REF="507"/>
potentates, with whom he was engaged in war, to be
prisoners in his capital. But Edward, finding that the
conquest of Scotland was nowise advanced by the cap∣tivity
of its sovereign, and that the government, con∣ducted
by Robert Stuart, his heir and nephew, was still
able to defend itself, consented to restore David Bruce
to his liberty, for the ransom of 100,000 marks sterling;
and that prince delivered the sons of all his principal
nobility, as hostages for the payment<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 45, 46, 52, 56. Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 174. Walsing. p. 173.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1358.</NOTE> the captivity of John, joined to the
preceding disorders of the French government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> had
produced in that country a dissolution, almost total, of
civil authority, and had occasioned confusions, the most
horrible and destructive, which had ever been experienced
in any age or in any nation. The Dauphin, now about
eighteen years of age, naturally assumed the royal power
during his father's captivity; but tho' endowed with
excellent abilities, even in such early years, he posssessed
neither the experience nor authority requisite to defend
a state, assailed at once by foreign power and shaken by
internal factions. In order to obtain supply, he assembled
the estates of the kingdom: That assembly, instead of
supporting his administration, were themselves seized
with the spirit of corsusion; and laid hold of the present
opportunity to demand limitations of the prince's power, the punishment of
past malversations, and the liberty of the King of Navarre. Marcel, provost of the merchants
and first magistrate of Paris, put himself at the head of
the unruly populace; and from the violence and temerity
of his character, pushed them to commit the most criminal
outrages against the royal authority. They detained the
Dauphin in a sort of captivity; they murdered in his
presence Robert de Clermont and John de Conflans,
<PB N="477" REF="508"/>
mareschals of France; they threatened all the other
ministers with a like fate; and when Charles, who was
obliged to temporize and dissemble, made his escape from
their hands, they levied war against him, and openly
erected the slandard of rebellion. The other cities of
the kingdom, in imitation of the capital, shook off the
Dauphin's authority; took the government into their own
hands; and spread the disorder into every province.
The nobles, whose inclinations led them to adhere to the
crown, and were naturally disposed to check these tu∣mults,
had lost all their influence; and being reproached
with cowardice on account of the base desection of their
sovereign in the battle of Poictiers, were treated with
universal contempt by the inferior orders. The troops,
who, from the deficiency of pay, were no longer re∣tained
in discipline, threw off all regard to their officers,
sought the means of subsistence by pillage and robbery,
and associating to them all the disorderly people, with
which that age abounded, formed numerous bands, which
infested all quarters of the kingdom. They laid the
open country desolate; burned and plundered the villages;
and by cutting off all means of communication or subsis∣tence,
reduced even the inhabitants of the walled towns
to the most extreme necessity. The peasants, formerly
oppressed, and now left unprotected, by their masters,
became desperate from their present<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>misery; and rising
every where in arms, carried to the last extremity those
disorders, which were derived from the sedition of the
citizens and disbanded soldiers<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 182, 183, 184.</NOTE>. The gentry, hated for
their tyranny, were every where exposed to the violence
of popular rage; and instead of meeting with regard for
their past dignity, became only, on that account, the
object of more wanton insult to the mutinous peasants.
They were hunted like wild beasts, and put to the sword
<PB N="478" REF="509"/>
without mercy: Their castles were consumed with fire,
and levelled to the ground: Their wives and daughters
were first ravished, and then murdered: The savages
proceeded so far as to impale some gentlemen, and roast
them alive before a slow fire: A body of nine thousand
of them broke into Meaux, where the wife of the
Dauphin with above 300 ladies had taken shelter: The
most brutal treatment and most atrocious cruelty were
justly dreaded by this helpless company: But the Captal
de Buche, tho' in thesfervice of Edward, yet moved by
generosity and by the gallantry of a true knight, flew to
their relief, and beat off the peasants with great slaughter.
In other civil wars, the opposite factions, falling under
the government of their several leaders, commonly pre∣serve
still the vestige of some rule and order: But here
the wild state of nature seemed to be renewed: Every
man was thrown loose and independent of his fellows:
And the great multitude of people, which had arisen
from the preceding police of civil society, served only to
encrease the horrour and confusion of the scene.</P>
<P>AMIDST these disorders, the King of Navarre made
his escape from prison, and presented a dangerous leader
to the furious malecontents<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 181.</NOTE>. But the splendid talents
of this prince qualified him only to do mischief, and to
encrease the public confusions: He wanted the steadiness
and prudence requisite for making his intrigues subservient
to his ambition, and forming his numerous partizans into
a regular faction. He revived his pretensions, somewhat
obsolete, to the crown of France; and indeed, if female
succession was to be admitted, his mother, the daughter
of Lewis Hutin, brought him undoubtedly the only
lawful title, and slood before Isabella, the mother of
Edward, in the course of descent. But while he ad∣vanced
this claim, he relied entirely on his alliance with
<PB N="479" REF="510"/>
the English, who were concerned in interest to disap∣point
his pretensions, and who, being public and inve∣terate
enemies to the state, served only, by the friendship
which they seemingly bore him, to render his cause the
more odious. And in all his operations, he acted more
like a leader of banditti, than one who aspired to be the
head of a regular government, and who was engaged by
his station to endeavour the re-establishment of order in
the community.</P>
<P>THE eyes, therefore, of all the French, who wished
to restore peace to their miserable and desolated country,
were turned towards the dauphin; and that young prince,
tho' not remarkable for his military talents, possessed so
much prudence and spirit, that he gained daily the as∣cendant
over all his enemies. Marcel, the seditious
provost, was slain, while he was attempting to deliver
the city to the King of Navarre and the English; and
the capital immediately returned to its duty<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 187.</NOTE>. The
most considerable bodies of the mutinous peasants were
dissipated, and put to the sword: Some bands of military
robbers underwent the same fate: And tho' many griev∣ous
disorders still remained, France began gradually to
assume the face of a regular civil government, and to
form some plan for its defence and security.</P>
<P>DURING the confusion in the Dauphin's affairs, Ed∣ward
seemed to have a favourable opportunity of pushing
his conquests: But besides that his hands were tied by
the truce, and he could only assist underhand the faction
of Navarre; the state of the English finances and military
power during those ages rendered the kingdom incapable
of making any regular or steady effort, and obliged it to
exert its force at very distant intervals, by which all the
projected ends were commonly disappointed. Edward
employed himself, during a conjuncture so inviting,
<PB N="480" REF="511"/>
chiefly in negotiations with his prisoner; and John had
the weakness to sign terms of peace, which, had they
taken effect, must have totally ruined and dismembered
his kingdom. He agreed to restore all the provinces,
which had been possessed by Henry II. and his two sons,
and to annex them forever to England without any
obligation of homage or fealty on the part of the
English monarch. But the Dauphin arid the states of
France rejected this treaty, so dishonourable and pernici∣ous
to the kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 201.</NOTE>; and Edward, on the expiration of
the truce, having now, by subsidies and frugality, collected
some treasure, prepared himself for a new invasion of
France.</P>
<P>THE great authority and renown of the King and
the prince of Wales, the splendid success of their former
enterprizes, and the certain prospect of plunder from the
defenceless provinces of France, soon brought together
all the military power of England; and the same motives
invited to Edward's standard all the hardy adventurers of
the different countries of Europe<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 205.</NOTE>. He passed over to
Calais with an army of hear 100,000 men; a force,
which the Dauphin could not pretend to withstand in the
open field: And he therefore prepared himself to elude
a blow, which it was impossible for him to resist. He
put all the considerable towns in a posture of defence;
ordered them to be supplied with magazines and provi∣sions;
distributed proper garrisons in all places; secured
every thing valuable in the fortified cities; and chose
his own station at Paris, with a view of allowing the
enemy to waste their fury on the open country.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1359.</NOTE> aware of this plan of defence, was obliged
to carry along with him six thousand waggons loaded
with the provisions necessary for the subsistence of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Novr.</NOTE>
<PB N="481" REF="512"/>
army. After ravaging the province of Picardy, he ad∣vanced
into Champagne; and having a strong desire of
being crowned King of France at Rheims, the usual place
in which that ceremony is performed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> he laid siege to the
city, and carried on his attacks, tho' without success,
for the space of seven weeks<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 208. Walsing. p. 174.</NOTE>. The place was bravely
defended by the inhabitants, encouraged by the exhor∣tations
of the archbishop, John de Craon; till the ad∣vanced
season (for this expedition was entered upon in
the beginning of winter) obliged the King to raise the
siege. The province of Champagne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1360.</NOTE> meanwhile, was
laid desolate by his incursions; and he thence conduct∣ed
his army, with a like intent into Burgundy. He
took and pillaged Tonnerre, Gaillon, Avalon, and other
small places; but the duke of Burgundy, that he might
preserve his country from farther ravages, consented to
pay him the sum of 100,000 nobles<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 161. Walsing. p. 174.</NOTE>. Edward then
bent his march towards the Nivernois, which saved itself
by a like composition: He laid waste the Brie and the
Gatinois; and after a long march, very destructive to
France, and somewhat ruinous to his own troops, he
appeared before the gates of Paris, and taking up his
quarters at Bourg-la-Reine, extended his army to Long-jumeau,
Mont-rouge and Vaugirard. He tried to pro∣voke
the Dauphin to hazard a battle, by sending him a
defiance; but could not make that prudent prince change
his plan of operations. Paris was safe from the danger
of an assault by its numerous garrison; from that of a
blockade by its well supplied magazines; and as Edward
could not subsist his own army in a country, wasted by
foreign and domestic enemies, and left also empty by
the precaution of the Dauphin, he was obliged to remove
his quarters, and he spread his army into the provinces of
<PB N="482" REF="513"/>
Maine, Beausse, and the Chartraine, which were aban∣doned
to the fury of their devastations<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 175.</NOTE>. The only re∣pose
which France experienced was during the festival
of Easter, when the King slopped the course of his
ravages. For superstition can sometimes restrain the
rage of men, which neither justice nor humanity is able
to controul.</P>
<P>WHILE the war was carried on in this ruinous man∣ner,
the negotiations for peace were never interrupted:
But as the King still insisted on the full execution of
the treaty, which he had made with his prisoner at
London, and which was strenuously rejected by the Dau∣phin,
there appeared no likelihood of an accommo∣dation.
The earl, now duke of Lancaster (for this title
was introduced into England during the present reign)
endeavoured to soften the rigour of these terms, and to
finish the war on more equal and reasonable conditions.
He insisted, with Edward, that, notwithstanding his
great and surprizing successes, the object of the war, if
such was to be esteemed the acquisition of the crown of
France, was not become any nearer than at the com∣mencement
of it; or rather, was set at a greater dis∣tance
by those very victories and advantages, which
seemed to lead to it. That his claim of succession had
not from the first procured him one partizan in the
kingdom; and the continuance of these destructive hostilities
had united every Frenchman in the most impla∣cable
animosity against him. That tho' interstine faction
had crept into the government of France, it was abating
every moment; and no party, even during the greatest
heat of the contest, when subjection under a foreign
enemy usually appears preferable to the dominion of
fellow citizens, had ever adopted the pretensions of the
King of England. That the King of Navarre himself,
<PB N="483" REF="514"/>
who alone was allied with the English, instead of being
a cordial friend, was Edward's most dangerous rival,
and in the opinion of his partizans appeared to possess a
much preferable title to the crown of France. That
the prolongation of the war, however it might enrich
the English soldiers, was ruinous to the King himself,
who bore all the charges of the armament, without
reaping any solid or durable advantage from it. That
if the present disorders of France continued, that king∣dom
would soon be reduced to such desolation as to
afford no spoils to its ravagers; if it could establish a
more steady government, it might turn the chance of
war in its favour, and by its superior force and advan∣tages
be able to repel the present victors. That the
Dauphin, even during his greatest distresses, had yet
conducted himself with so much prudence as to prevent
the English from acquiring one foot of land in the king∣dom;
and it were better for the King to accept by a
peace what he had in vain attempted to acquire by
hostilities, which, however hitherto successful, had been
extremely expensive, and might prove very dangerous.
And that Edward having acquired so much glory by his
arms, the praise of moderation was the only honour,
which he could now aspire to; an honour so much the
greater, as it was durable, was united with that of pru∣dence,
and might be attended with the most real ad∣vantages<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 211.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE reasons induced Edward to accept of more equitable terms of peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Bretigni.</NOTE> and it is probable, that, in order to palliate this change of resolution, he ascribed it to a vow, made during a terrible tempest which attacked his army on their march, and which the antient historians represent as the cause of this sudden accommo∣dation<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 211.</NOTE>.
<PB N="484" REF="515"/>
The conferences between the English and
French commissioners were carried on during a few days
at Bretigni in the Chartraine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th May.</NOTE> and the peace was at last
concluded on the following conditions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 178. Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 212.</NOTE>: It was stipu∣lated,
that King John should be restored to his liberty,
and should pay as his ransom three millions of crowns of
gold, about 1,500,000 pounds of our present money<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">This is a prodigious sum, and probably near the half of what the King received from the parliament during the whole course of his reign. It must be remarked, that a tenth and fifteenth (which was always thought a high grant) were, in the eighth year of his reign, fixed at about 29,000 pounds: There were about 30,000 sacks of wool exported every year: A sack of wool was at a medium sold for five pounds. Upon these suppositions it would be easy to compute all the parliament∣ary grants, taking the lift as they stand in Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 780: Tho' much must still be left to conjecture. This King levied more money from his subjects than any of his predecessprs; and the parlia∣ment frequently complain of the poverty of the people, and the oppressions under which they laboured. But it is to be remarked, that the half of the French King's ransom was not paid before the war broke out between the two crowns: His son chose rather to employ the money in combating the English, than in enriching them. See Rymer, vol. viii. p. 315.</NOTE>;
which was to be discharged at different payments: That
Edward should for ever renounce all claim to the crown
of France, and to the provinces of Normandy, Maine,
Touraine, and Anjou, possessed by his ancestors; and
should receive in exchange the provinces of Poictou,
Xaintonge, l'Agenois, Perigort, the Limousin, Quercy,
Rovergue, l'Angoumois, and other districts in that quar∣ter,
together with Calais, Guisnes, Montreuil, and the
county of Ponthieu, on the other side of France: That
the full sovereignty of all these provinces, as well as
that of Guienne, should be vested in the crown of
England, and that France should renounce all title to
<PB N="485" REF="516"/>
feudal jurisdiction, homage, or appeal from them: That
the King of Navarre should be restored to all his ho∣nours
and possessions: That Edward should renounce
his confederacy with the Flemings, John his connexions
with the Scots: That the disputes concerning the suc∣cession
of Brittany, between the families of Blois and
Mountfort, should be decided by arbiters, appointed by
the two Kings, and if the competitors refused to sub∣mit
to the sentence, the dispute should no longer be
a ground of war between the kingdoms: And that
forty hostages, such as should be
agreed on, should be sent to England as a security for the execution of all
these conditions<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">The hostages were the two sons of the French King, John and Lewis; his brother Philip duke of Orleans, the duke of Bourbon, James de Bourbon count de Ponthieu, the counts d'Eu, de Longueville, de St. Pol, de Harcourt, de Vendome, de Couci, de Craon, de Mont∣morenci, and many of the chief nobility of France. The princes were mostly released on the fulfulling of certain articles: Others of the hostages, and the duke of Berry among the rest, were permitted to return upon their parole, which they did not keep. Rymer, vol. vi. p. 278, 285, 287.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN consequence of this treaty of peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th July.</NOTE> the King of
France was brought over to Calais; whither Edward also
soon after arrived: And both princes there solemnly
ratified the treaty. John was sent to Boulogne; the
King accompanied him a mile in his journey; and the
two monarchs parted, with many professions, probably
cordial and sincere, of mutual friendship and amity<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 213.</NOTE>.
The good disposition of John made him fully sensible of
the generous treatment which he had met with in
England, and obliterated all memory of the ascendant
gained over him by his rival. There seldom has been
a treaty of so great importance so faithfully executed by
both parties. Edward had scarcely from the beginning
<PB N="486" REF="517"/>
entertained any hopes of acquiring the crown of France:
By restoring John to his liberty, and making peace at
a juncture so favourable to his arms, he had now plainly
renounced all pretensions of this nature: He had sold
at a very high price that chimerical claim: And had
at present no other interest than to retain those acqui∣sitions
which he had made with such singular prudence
and good fortune. John, on the other hand, tho' the
terms were severe and rigorous upon him, possessed
such fidelity and honour, that he was determined at all
hazards to execute them, and to use every expedient for
satisfying a monarch, who had indeed been his greatest
political enemy, but had treated him personally with
singular humanity and regard. But, notwithstanding all
his endeavours, there occurred many difficulties in ful∣filling
his purpose; chiefly from the extreme reluctance,
which many towns and vassals in the neighbourhood of
Guienne, expressed against submitting to the English do∣minion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 214.</NOTE>;
and John, in order to adjust these differences,
took a resolution of coming over himself into England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1363.</NOTE>
His council endeavoured to dissuade him from this rash
design; and probably would have been pleased to see
him employ more chicanery, for eluding the execution
of so disadvantageous a treaty: But John replied to
them, that, tho' good faith were banished from the rest
of the earth, she ought still to retain her habitation in
the breasts of princes. Some historians would detract
from the merit of this honourable behaviour, by repre∣senting
John as enamoured of an English lady, to whom
he was glad, on this pretence, to pay a visit: But
besides, that this surmise is not founded on any good
authority, it appears very unlikely on account of the
advanced age of that prince, who was now in his fifty-sixth
year.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1364.</NOTE> He was lodged in the Savoy; the palace
<PB N="487" REF="518"/>
where he had resided during his captivity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th April.</NOTE> and where he
soon after sickened and died. Nothing can be a stronger
proof of the great dominion of fortune over men, than
the calamities which pursued a monarch of such eminent
valour, goodness and honour, and which he incurred
merely by reason of some slight imprudences, which, in
other situations, would have beens of no importance.
But tho' both his reign and that of his father, proved ex∣tremely
unfortunate to their kingdom, the French crown
acquired, during their time, very considerable accessions,
those of Dauphiny and Burgundy. This latter province,
however, John had the imprudence again to dismember
from the crown, by bestowing it on Philip his fourth
son, and chief favourite<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 421.</NOTE>; a deed, which was afterwards
the source of many calamities to his kingdom.</P>
<P>JOHN was succeeded in the throne by Charles, the
Dauphin, a prince educated in the school of adversity,
and well qualified, by his consummate prudence and ex∣perience,
to repair all the losses, which the kingdom had
suffered from the errors of his two predecessors. Con∣trary
to the practice of all the great princes of those
times, which held nothing in estimation but military
courage, he seems to have fixed it as a maxim never to
appear at the head of his armies; and he was the first
King in Europe, who showed the advantages of policy,
foresight and judgment, above a rash and precipitate va∣lour.
The events of his reign, compared with those of
the preceding, are a proof, how little reason kingdoms
have to value themselves on their victories, or to be hum∣bled
by their defeats, which in reality ought to be ascribed
entirely to the good or bad conduct of their rulers, and
go a very little way towards determining national cha∣racters
and manners.</P>
<P><PB N="488" REF="519"/>
BEFORE Charles could think of counter-balancing so
great a power as England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> it was necessary for him to
remedy the many disorders, to which his own kingdom
was exposed. He turned his arms against the King of
Navarre, the great disturber of France during that age:
He deseated that prince by the conduct of Bertrand du
Guesclin, a gentleman of Brittany, one of the most ac∣complished
characters of the age, whom he had the dif∣cernment
to choose as the instrument of all his victories<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 119, 120, 122.</NOTE>:
And he obliged his enemy to accept of moderate terms
of peace. Du Guesclin was less fortunate in the wars of
Brittany, which still continued, notwithstanding the me∣diation
of France and England: He was defeated and
taken prisoner at Auray by Chandos: Charles de Blois
was there slain, and the young count de Mountfort soon
after got entire possession of that dutchy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv 1. chap. 227, 228, &amp;c. Walsing, p. 180.</NOTE>. But the pru∣dence
of Charles broke the force of this blow: He sub∣mitted
to the decision of fortune: He acknowledged the
title of Mountfort, tho' a zealous partizan of England;
and received the proffered homage for his dominions.
But the chief obstacle which the French King met with
in the settlement of the state, proceeded from obscure
enemies, whom their crimes alone rendered eminent,
and their number dangerous.</P>
<P>ON the conclusion of the treaty of Bretigni, the many
military adventurers, who had followed the fortunes of
Edward, being dispersed into the several provinces, and
possessed of strong holds, refused to lay down their arms,
or relinquish a course of life, to which they were now
accustomed, and by which alone they could gain a sub∣sistance<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 214.</NOTE>.
They associated themselves with the banditti, who were already enured to the habits of rapine. an vio∣lence;
<PB N="489" REF="520"/>
and under the name of the <HI>companies</HI> and <HI>compa∣nions,</HI>
became a terror to all the peaceable inhabitants.
Some English and Gascon gentlemen of character, parti∣cularly
Sir Matthew Gournay, Sir Hugh Calverley, the
chevalier Verte, and others, were not ashamed to take
the command of these ruffians, whose numbers amounted
on the whole to near 40,000 men, and who bore the
appearance of regular armies, rather than bands of rob∣bers.
These leaders fought pitched battles with the
troops of France, and gained victories; in one of which
Jaques de Bourbon, a prince of the blood, was slain<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 214, 215.</NOTE>:
And they proceeded to such a height, that they wanted
little but regular establishments to become princes, and
thereby sanctify, by the maxims of the world, their in∣famous
profession. The greater spoil they committed on
the country, the more easy they found it to recruit their
number: All those, who were reduced to misery and
despair, flocked to their standard: The evil was every
day increasing: And tho' the Pope declared them excom∣municate,
these military plunderers, however deeply af∣fected
with this sentence, to which they paid a much
greater regard than to any maxims of justice or huma∣nity,
could hot be induced by it to betake themselves to
any peaceable or lawful profession.</P>
<P>As Charles was not able by power to redress so enor∣mous
a grievance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1366.</NOTE> he was led, both by necessity, and
by the turn of his character, to correct it by policy, and
to contrive some method of discharging into foreign coun∣tries
this dangerous and intestine evil.</P>
<P>PETER, King of Castile, stigmatized by his contem∣poraries
and by posterity, with the epithet of <HI>Cruel,</HI> had
filled with blood and murder his kingdom and his own
family; and having incurred the universal hatred of his
<PB N="490" REF="521"/>
subjects, he kept only from present terror an anxious
and precarious possession of the throne. His nobles fell
every day the victims of his severity: He put to death
several of his natural brothers from groundless jealousy:
Each murder, by multiplying his enemies, became the
occasion of fresh barbarities: And as he was not destitute
of talents, his neighbours, no less than his own subjects,
were alarmed by the progress of his violence and injus∣tice.
The ferocity of his temper, instead of being sostened
by his strong propensity to love, was rather enflamed by
that passion, and took thence new occasion to exert itself.
Instigated by Mary de Padilla, who had acquired the
ascendant over him, he threw into prison Blanche de
Bourbon, his wife, sister to the Queen of France; and
soon after made way by poison for the espousing of his
mistress.</P>
<P>HENRY, count de Transtamare, his natural brother,
seeing the fate of every one who had become obnoxious
to this tyrant, took arms against him; but being foiled
in the attempt, he sought for refuge in France, where
he found the minds of every one extremely enflamed
against Peter, on account of his murder of the French
princess. He proposed to Charles the enlisting of the
<HI>companies</HI> into his service, and leading them into Castile;
where, from the concurrence of his own friends, and the
enemies of his brother, he had the prospect of certain
and immediate success. The French King, charmed
with the project, employed du Guesclin in negotiating
with the leaders of these banditti. The treaty was soon
concluded. The high character of honour, which that
general possessed, made every one trust to his promises:
Tho' the intended expedition was kept a secret, the compa∣nies
implicitly inlifted under his standard: And they required
no other condition before their engagement, than an as∣surance,
that they were not to be led against the prince
<PB N="491" REF="522"/>
of Wales in Guienne. But that prince was so little averse
to the enterprize, that he allowed some gentlemen of his
retinue to enter into the service under du Guesclin.</P>
<P>DU GUESCLIN, having compleated his levies, led the
army first to Avignon, where the Pope then resided, and
demanded, sword in hand, an absolution for his soldiers,
and the sum of 200,000 livres. The first was very rea∣dily
promised him; some more difficulty was made with
regard to the second. “I believe my fellows,” replied
du Guesclin, “may make a shift to do without your
absolution; but the money is absolutely necessary.”
The Pope then extorted from the inhabitants in the city
and neighbourhood the sum of an hundred thousand
livres, and offered it to du Guesclin. “It is not my
purpose,” cried that generous warrior, “to oppress
the innocent people. The Pope and his cardinals
themselves can easily spare me that sum from their
own pockets. This money, I insist, must be restored
to the owners. And should they be defrauded of it,
I shall myself return from the other side of the Pyre∣nees,
and oblige you to make them restitution.” The
Pope found the necessity of submission, and paid him,
from his own treasury, the sum demanded<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hist. du Guescli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. The army
hallowed by the blessings, and enriched by the spoils of
the church, proceeded on their expedition.</P>
<P>THESE experienced and hardy soldiers, conducted by
so able a general, easily prevailed over the King of Cas∣tile,
whose subjects, instead of supporting their oppressor,
were ready to join the enemy against him<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 230.</NOTE>. Peter fled
from his dominions, took shelter in Guienne, and craved
the protection of the prince of Wales, whom his father
had invested with the sovereignty of these conquered
provinces, under the title of the principality of Aqui∣taine<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 384. Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 231.</NOTE>.
<PB N="492" REF="523"/>
The prince seemed now to have entirely
changed his changed his sentiments with regard to the Spanish trans∣actions:
Whether that he was moved by the generosity
of supporting a distrest prince, and thought, as is but
too usual among sovereigns, that the rights of the people
were a matter of much less consideration; or dreaded the
acquisition of so powerful a consederate to France as the
new King of Castile; or what is most probable, was
impatient of rest and ease, and sought only an opportu∣nity
of exerting his military talents, by which he had al∣ready
acquired so much renown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1367.</NOTE> He promised his assist∣ance
to the dethroned monarch;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedition into Castile.</NOTE> and having obtained
the consent of his father, he levied a great army, and set
out upon his enterprize. He was accompanied by his
younger brother, John of Gaunt, created duke of Lan∣caster,
in the place of the good prince of that name,
who had died without any male issue, and whose daugh∣ter
he had espoused. Chandos also, who bore among
the English the same character, which du Guesclin had
acquired among the French, commanded under him in
this expedition.</P>
<P>THE first blow which the prince of Wales gave to
Henry de Transtamare, Was the recalling all the <HI>compa∣nies</HI>
from his service; and so much reverence did they
bear to the name of Edward, that great numbers of them
immediately withd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew from Spain, and inlisted under his
standard. Henry however, beloved by his new subjects,
and supported by the King of Arragon and others of his
neighbours, was able to meet the enemy with an army of
100,000 men; forces three times more numerous than
those commanded by Edward. Du Guesclin and all his
experienced officers advised him to delay any decisive
action, to cut off the prince of Wales's provisions, and
<PB N="493" REF="524"/>
to avoid every engagement with a general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d April.</NOTE> whose enter∣prizes
had hitherto been always conduced with prudence,
and crowned with, success. Henry trusted too much to
his numbers; and ventured to encounter the English
prince at Najara<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. Chap. 241.</NOTE>. Historians of that age are commonly
very copious in describing the shock of armies in battle,
the valour of the combatants, the slaughter and various
succesies of the day: But tho' small rencounters in those
times were often well disputed, the military discipline
was always too imperfect to preserve order in great ar∣mies;
and such actions deserve more the name of routs
than of battles. Henry was chaced off the field, with
the loss of above 20,000 men: There perished only four
knights and forty private men on the side of the English.</P>
<P>PETER, who so well merited the infamous epithet
which he bore, proposed to murder all his prisoners in
cold blood; but was restrained from this barbarity by
the remonstrances of the prince of Wales. All Castile
now submitted to the victor: Peter was restored to the
throne: And Edward finished this perilous enterprize;
with his usual glory. But he had soon reason to repent
the associating himself with a man like Peter, abandoned,
to all sense of virtue and honour. The ungrateful ty∣rant
refused the stipulated pay to the English forces; and
Edward, finding his soldiers daily perish by sickness, and,
even his own health impaired by the climate, was obliged,
without receiving any satisfaction on this head, to return
into Guienne<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 242, 243. Walsingham, p. 182.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE monstrous cruelties exercised by. Peter over his
helpless subjects, whom he now regarded as vanquished
rebels, revived all the animosity of the Castilians against
him; and on the return of Henry de Transtamare, to∣gether
with du Guesclin, and some forces levied anew
<PB N="494" REF="525"/>
in France, the tyrant was again dethroned, and was
taken prisoner. His brother, in resentment of his cru∣elties,
murdered him with his own hand; and was
placed on the throne of Castile, which he transmitted to
his posterity. The duke of Lancaster, who espoused in
second marriage the eldest daughter of Peter, inherited
only the empty title of that fovereignty, and encreased
the animosity of the new King of Castile against Eng∣land.</P>
<P>BUT the prejudice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1368.</NOTE> which the affairs of prince Ed∣ward
received from this splendid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with France.</NOTE> tho' imprudent expesdition,
ended not with it. He had involved himself
in so much debt by his preparations and the pay of his
troops, that he found it necessary, on his return, to im∣pose
on his principality a new tax, which some of the
nobility submitted to with extreme reluctance, and to which
others absolutely refused compliance<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This tax was a livre upon a hearth; and it was imagined, that this imposition would have yielded 1,200,000 livres a year, which sup∣poses so many hearths in the, provinces possessed by the English. But such loose conjectures have no manner of authority, much less, in such ignorant times. There was a strong instance of it in the present reign. The house of commons granted the King a tax of twenty-two shillings on each parish, supposing that the amount of the whole would be 50,000 pounds. But they were found to be in a mistake of near fix to one. Cotton, p. 3. And the privy council assumed the power of augmenting the tax, so as to make it answer the sums proposed to be levied by it; which was certainly a very irregular practice.</NOTE>. This incident revived the animosity which the inhabitants bore to the
English, and which all the amiable qualities of the prince
of Wales were not able to mitigate or assuage. They
complained, that they were considered as a conquered
people, that their privileges were disregarded, that all
trust was given to the English alone, that every office of
honour and profit was conferred on these foreigners, and
that the extreme reluctance, which most of them had
<PB N="495" REF="526"/>
expresed, to receive this new yoke, was likely to be
long remembered against them. They cast, therefore,
their eyes towards their antient sovereign, whose prudence,
they found, had now brought the affairs of his kingdom
into excellent order; and the counts of Armagnac,
Comminge, and Perigord, the lord d'Albert, with other
nobles, went to Paris, and were encouraged to carry
their complaints to Charles, as to their lord paramount,
against these oppressions of the English government<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 244.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the treaty of Bretigni it had been agreed, that the
two Kings should make renounciations; Edward of his
claim to the crown of France and to the provinces of
Normandy, Maine, and Anjou; John of the homage
and fealty due for Guienne and the other provinces ceded
to the English. But when that treaty was confirmed and
renewed at Calais, it was found necessary, on account
of some formalities peculiar to the seudal law, that the
mutual renounciations should for some time be deferred;
and it was agreed, that the parties, mean-while, should
make no use of these claims against each other<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 219, 230, 237.</NOTE>. Tho'
the failure in exchanging these renounciations had still
proceeded from France<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rot. Franc. 35 Edw. III. m. 3, from Tyrrel, vol. iii. p. 643.</NOTE>, Edward appears to have taken
no umbrage at it; both because this clause seemed to give
him entire security, and because some reasonable apology
had probably been made to him for each delay. It was,
however, on this pretence, gross and iniquitous as it was,
that Charles resolved to ground his claim, of considering
himself still as superior lord of these provinces, and of
receiving the appeals of his sub-vassals<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 245.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT as the views of policy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1369.</NOTE> more than those of jus∣tice,
enter into the deliberations of princes; and as the
<PB N="496" REF="527"/>
mortal injuries received from the English the pride of
their triumphs, the severe terms imposed by the treaty of
peace, seemed to render every prudent means of revenge
honourable against them; Charles was determined to
take this measure, less by the reasonings of his civilians
and lawyers, than by the present situation of the two
monarchies. He considered the declining years of Ed∣ward,
the languishing mate of the prince of Wales's
health, the affection which the inhabitants of all these
provinces bore to their antient master, their distance
form England, their contiguity to France, the extreme
animosity expressed by his own subjects against these in∣vaders,
and their ardent thirst of vengeance; and having
made silently all the preparations requisite, he sent to the
prince of Wales a summons to appear in his court at
Paris, and there to justify his conduct towards his vassals.
The prince replied, that he would come to Paris; but it
should be at the head of sixty thousand men<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. Chap. 247, 748.</NOTE>. The un∣warlike
character of Charles kept Edward, even yet,
from thinking, that that monarch was in earnest, in this
bold and hazardous attempt.</P>
<P>IT soon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1370.</NOTE> appeared what a poor return the King re∣ceived
by his distant conquests for all the blood and trea∣sure
expended in the quarrel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ill success the English.</NOTE> and how impossible it was
to retain acquisitions, in an age when no regular force
could be maintained sufficient to defend them against the
revolt of the inhabitants, much less, if that danger was
conjoined with the invasion of a foreign enemy. Charles
fell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1370.</NOTE> first upon Ponthieu, which gave the English an inlet
into the heart of France: The citizens of Abbeville
opened their gates to him<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 183.</NOTE>: Those of St. Valori, Rue,
and Crotoy imitated the example, and the, whole coun∣try
was in a little time reduced to submission. The
<PB N="497" REF="528"/>
dukes of Berri and Anjou, brothers to Charles, being
assisted by du Guesclin, who was recalled from Spain,
invaded the southern provinces; and by means of their
good conduct, the favourable inclinations of the people,
and the ardour of the French nobility, they made every
day considerable progress against the English. The state
of the prince of Wales's health did not permit him to
mount on horseback, or exert his usual activity: Chan∣dos,
the constable of Guienne, was slair in one action<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 277. Walsingham, p. 185.</NOTE>:
The Captal de Buche, who succeeded him in that office,
was taken prisoner in another<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 310.</NOTE>: And when young Ed∣ward
himself was obliged by his increasing infirmities to
throw up the command, and return to his native coun∣try,
the English affairs in the south of France seemed to
be menaced with a total ruin.</P>
<P>EDWARD, incensed at these injuries, threatened to
put to death all the French hostages, who remained in
his hands; but on reflection abstained from that ungene∣rous
revenge. After resuming, by advice of parliament,
the vain title of King of France<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 621. Cotton's Abridg. p. 108.</NOTE>, he endeavoured to
send succours into Gascony; but all his attempts, both
by sea and land, proved unsuccessful. The earl of Pem∣broke
was intercepted at sea and taken prisoner with his
whole army near Rochelle by a fleet, which Henry,
King of Castile, had fitted out for that purpose<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 302, 303, 304. Walsingham, p. 186.</NOTE>: Ed∣ward
himself embarked for Bourdeaux with another
army; but was so long detained by contrary winds, that
he was obliged to lay aside the enterprise<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 311. Walsingham, p. 187.</NOTE>. Sir Robert
Knolles, at the head of 30,000 men, marched out of
Calais, and continued his ravages to the gates of Paris,
<PB N="498" REF="529"/>
without being able to provoke the enemy to an engage∣merit:
He proceeded on his march to the provinces of
Maine and Anjou, which he laid waste; but part of his
army being there defeated by the conduct of du Gues∣clin,
who was now created constable of France, and
who seems to have been the first consummate general,
that had yet appeared in Europe, the rest were scattered
and dispersed, and the small remains of it, instead of
reaching Guienne, took shelter in Brittany, whose sove∣reign
had embraced the alliance of England<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 291. Walsingham, p. 185.</NOTE>. The
duke of Lancaster, some time after, made a like attempt
with an army of 25,000 men; and marched the whole
length of France from Calais to Bourdeaux; but was so
much harassed by the flying parties which attended him,
that he brought not the half of his army to the place of
their destination. Edward, from the necessity of his af∣fairs,
was at last obliged to conclude a truce with the
enemy<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Froissart, liv. 1. chap. 321. Walsingham, p. 187.</NOTE>; after almost all his antient possessions in France
had been ravished from him, except Bourdeaux and Bay∣onne,
and all his. conquests, except Calais.</P>
<P>THE decline of the King's life was exposed to many
mortifications, and corresponded not to the splendid and
noisy scenes, which had filled the beginning and the
middle of it. Besides seeing the loss of his foreign do∣minions,
and being baffled in every attempt to defend them;
he felt the decay of his authority at home, and
experienced, from the sharpness of some parliamentary
remonstrances, the great inconstancy of the people, and
the influence of present fortune over all their judgments<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 189. Ypod. Neust. 530.</NOTE>.
This prince, who, during the vigour of his age, had been
chiefly occupied in the pursuits of war and ambition,
began, at an unseasonable period, to indulge himself in
<PB N="499" REF="530"/>
pleasure; and being now a widower, he attached himself
to a lady of sense and spirit, one Alice Pierce, who ac∣quired
a great ascendant over him, and by her influence
gave so much disgust to his people, that, in order to sa∣tisfy
the parliament, he was obliged to remove her from
court<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, p. 189.</NOTE>. The indolence also, naturally attending old
age and infirmities, had made him, in a great measure,
resign the administration into the hands of his son, the
duke of Lancaster; who, as he was far from being po∣pular,
weakened extremely the affection, born by the
English to the person and government of the King.
Men carried their jealousies very far against the duke;
and as they saw, with infinite regret, the death of the
prince of Wales every day approaching, they appre∣hended,
lest the succession of his son, Richard, now a
minor, should be defeated by the intrigues of Lancaster,
and by the weak indulgence of the old King. But Ed∣ward,
in order to satisfy both the people and the prince
on this head, declared in parliament his grandson heir
and successor to the crown; and thereby cut off all the
hopes of the duke of Lancaster, if he ever had the teme∣rity
to entertain any.</P>
<P>THE prince of Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1376.</NOTE> after a lingering illness, died
in the forty-sixth year of his age;<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th June. Death of the prince of Wales.</NOTE> and left a character,
illustrated by every eminent virtue, and from his earliest
youth till the hour he expired, unstained by any blemish.
His valor and military talents formed the smallest part of
his merit: His generosity, humanity, affability, mode∣ration,
gained him the affections of all the world; and
he was qualified to throw a lustre, not only on that rude
age, in which he lived, and which nowise infected him
with its vices, but on the most shining period of antient
or modern history. The King survived about a year this
<PB N="500" REF="531"/>
melancholy incident:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1377.</NOTE> England was deprived at once of
both of these princes, its chief ornament and support:
He expired in the sixty-fifth year of his age and the fifty∣first
of his reign; and the people were sensible, tho' too
late, of the irreparable loss, which they had sustained.</P>
<P>THE English are apt to consider with peculiar fond∣ness
the history of Edward III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st June. Death and charac∣ter of the King.</NOTE> and to esteem his reign,
as it was one of the longest, the most glorious also, which
occurs in the annals of their nation. The ascendant
which they then began to acquire over France, their
rival and national enemy, makes them cast their eyes on
this period with great complacency, and sanctifies every
measure, which Edward embraced for that end. But
the domestic government of this prince is really more ad∣mirable
than his foreign victories; and England enjoyed,
by the prudence and vigor of his administration, a longer
interval of domestic peace and tranquillity than she had
been, blest with in any former period, or than she expe∣rienced
for many ages after. He gained the affections of
the great, yet curbed their licentiousness: He made them
feel his power, without their daring, or even being in∣clined,
to murmur at it: His affable and obliging beha∣viour,
his munificence and generosity, made them sub∣mit
with pleasure to his dominion; his valor and con∣duct
made them successful in most of their enterprizes;
and their unquiet spirits, directed against a public enemy,
had no leisure to breed those disturbances, to which they
were naturally so much inclined, and which the frame
of the government seemed so much to authorizer This
was the chief benefit, which resulted from Edward's
victories and conquests. His foreign wars were, in other
respects, neither founded in justice, nor directed to any
very salutary purpose. His attempt against the King of
Scotland, a minor and a brother-in-law, and the revival
of his grandfather's claim of superiority over that king∣dom,
<PB N="501" REF="532"/>
were both unseasonable and ungenerous; and he
allowed himself to be too soon seduced, by the glaring
prospect of French conquests, from the acquisition of a
point, which was practicable, and which might really,
if attained, have been of lasting. utility to his country
and his successors. The suecess, which he met with in
France, tho' chiefly owing to his eminent talents, was
unexpected; and yet, from the very nature of things,
not from any unforeseen accidents, was found, even
during his own life-time, to have procured him no solid
advantages. But the glory of a conqueror is so dazling
to the vulgar, the animosity of nations is so extreme,
that the fruitless desolation of so fine a part of Europe, as
France, is totally disregarded by us, and is never consi∣dered
as a blemish in the character or conduct of this
prince: And indeed, from the unfortunate state of
human nature, it will commonly happen that a sovereign of
great genius, such as Edward, who usually finds every
thing easy in his domestic government, will turn himself
towards military enterprizes, where alone he meets with
opposition, and where he has full exercise for his industry
and capacity.</P>
<P>EDWARD had a numerous posterity by his Queen,
Philippa of Hainault. His eldest son was the heroic
Edward, commonly called the Black Prince, from the
colour of his armour. This prince essed his cousin
Joan, commonly called the <HI>fair maid of Kent,</HI> daughter
and heir of his uncle, the earl of Kent, who was beheaded
in the beginning of this reign. She was first married to
Sir Thomas Holland, by whom the had children. She
had a son, Richard, by the prince of Wales, who alone
survived his father.</P>
<P>THE second son of King Edward (for we pass over
such as died in their childhood) was Lionel duke of Cla∣rence,
who was first married to Elizabeth de Burgh,
<PB N="502" REF="533"/>
daughter and heir of the earl of Ulster, by whom he left
only one daughter, married to Edmund Mortimer, earl
of Marche. Lionel espoused in second marriage, Vio∣lante,
the daughter of the duke of Milan<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi, p. 364.</NOTE>, and died in
Italy soon after the consummation of his nuptials, with∣out
leaving any posterity by that princess. Of all the
family, he resembled most his father and eldest brother in
his noble qualities.</P>
<P>EDWARD'S third son was John of Gaunt, so called
from the place of his birth: He was created duke of
Lancaster; and from him, sprung that branch, which
afterwards possessed the crown. The fourth son of this
royal family was Edmund, created earl of Cambridge by
his father, and duke of York by his nephew. The fifth
ton was Thomas, who received the title of earl of Buck∣ingham
from his father, and that of duke of Glocester
from his nephew. In order to prevent confusion, we
shall always distinguish these two princes by the titles of
York and Glocester, even before they were advanced to them.</P>
<P>THERE were also several princesses born to Edward
by Philippa, <HI>viz.</HI> Isabella, Joan, Mary and Margaret,
who espoused, in the order of their names, Ingelram de
Coucy earl of Bedford, Alphonso King of castile, John
de Mountfort duke of Brittany, and John Hostings earl
of Pembroke. The princess Joan died at Bourdeaux
before the consummation of her marriage.</P>
<P>IT is remarked by an elegant historian<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dr. Robertson's Hisory of Scotland, book 1.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscella∣neous trans∣actions in this reign.</NOTE> that Con∣querors,
tho' usually the bane of human kind, proved
often, in those feudal times, the most indulgent of sove∣reigns:
They stood most in need of supplies from their
people; and not being able to compel them by force to
<PB N="503" REF="534"/>
submit to the necessary impositions, they were obliged
to make them some compensation, by equitable laws and
popular concessions. This remark is, in some measure,
tho' imperfectly, justified by the conduct of Edward III.
He took no steps of moment without consulting his par∣liament,
and obtaining their approbation, which he after∣wards
pleaded as a reason for their supporting his mea∣sures<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 108, 120.</NOTE>.
The parliament therefore role into greater con∣sideration
during his reign, and acquired a more regular
authority than in any former times; and even the house
of commons, which, during turbulent and factious pe∣riods,
was naturally oppressed by the greater power of
the crown and barons, began to appear of some weight in
the constitution. In the latter years of Edward, the
King's ministers were impeached in parliament, particu∣larly
lord Latimer, who fell a sacrifice to their authority<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">cotton's Abridg. p. 122.</NOTE>;
and they even obliged him to banish his stress by their
remonstrances. Some attention was also paid to the
elections of their members; and lawyers, in particular,
who were, at that time, men of very inferior character,
were totally excluded the house during several parlia∣ments<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE of the most popular laws, enacted by any prince,
was the statute, which passed in the twenty-fifth of this
reign<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">chap. 2.</NOTE>, and which limited the cases of high treason,
before vague and uncertain, to three principal heads, the
conspiring the death of the King, the levying war against
him, and the adhering to his enemies; and the judges
were prohibited, if any other cases should occur, from
inflicting the penalty of treason, without an application
to parliament. The bounds of treason were indeed so
much limited by this statute, which still remains in force
without any alteration, that the lawyers were obliged to
<PB N="504" REF="535"/>
enlarge them, and to explain a conspiracy for levying
war against the King to be equivalent to a conspiracy
against his life; and this interpretation, seemingly forced,
has, from the necessity of the case, been tacitly acqui∣esced
in. It was also ordained, that a parliament should be
held once a year or of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner, if need be: A law which,
like many others, was never observed, and lost its autho∣rity
by disuse<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">4 Edw. III. cap. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD granted above twenty parliamentary confir∣mations
of the great charter; and these concessions are
commonly appealed to as proofs of his great indulgence
to the people, and his tender regard to their liberties.
But the contrary presumption is much more natural. If
the maxims of Edward's reign had not been in general
somewhat arbitrary, and if the great charter had not been
frequently violated, the parliament would never have
applied for thes frequent confirmations, which could
add no force to a deed regularly observed, and which
could serve to no other purpose, than to prevent the con∣trary
precedents from turning into a rule, and acquiring
authority. It was indeed the effect of the irregular go∣vernment
during those ages, that a statute, which had
been enacted some years, instead of acquiring, was ima∣gined
to lose force by time, and needed to be often re∣newed
by recent statutes of the same sense and tenor.
Hence likewise that general clause, so frequent in old
acts of parliament, that the statutes, enacted by the
King's progenitors, shall be served<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">36 Edw. III. cap. 1. 37 Edw. III. cap. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>; a precaution,
which, if we do not consider the circumstances of the
times, might appear absurd and ridiculous. The fre∣quent
confirmations in general terms of the church's pri∣vileges
proceeded from the fame cause.</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="536"/>
IT is a clause in one of Edward's statutes, <HI>that no man,
of what estate or condition soever, shall be put out of land or
tenement, nor taken nor imprisoned, nor disherited, nor put to
death, without being brought in answer by due process of the law</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">28 Edw. III. cap. 3.</NOTE>.
This privilege was sufficiently secured by a clause
of the great charter, which had received a general con∣firmation
in the first chapter of the same statute. Why
then is this clause so anxiously, and, as we may think,
so superfluously repeated? Plainly; because there had been
some late infringements of it, which gave umbrage to
the commons<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">They plainly assert, in the 15th of this reign, that there had been such instances. Cotton's Abridg. p. 31. They repeat the same in the 21st Year. see p. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT there is no article, in which the laws are more
frequently repeated during this reign, almost in the same
terms, than that of purveyance, which the parliament
always calls an <HI>outrageous</HI> and <HI>intolerable</HI> grievance, and
the source of <HI>infinite</HI> damage to the people<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">36 Edw. III. &amp;c.</NOTE>. The par∣liament
tried to abolish this prerogative altogether, by
prohibiting any one to take goods without the consent of
the owners<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">14 Edw. III cap. 19.</NOTE>, and by changing the heinous name of pur∣veyors,
as they call it, into that of <HI>buyers</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">36 Edw. III. cap. 2.</NOTE>: But the arbi∣trary
conduct of Edward still brought back the grievance
upon them; tho' contrary both to the Great Charter,
and to many statutes. This disorder was in a good mea∣sure
derived from the state of the public finances and of
the kingdom; and could therefore the less admit of any
remedy. The prince frequently wanted ready money;
yet his family must be provided for: And he was obliged
to employ force and violence for that purpose, and to
give tallies, at what rate he pleased, to the owners of
<PB N="506" REF="537"/>
the goods which he laid hold of. The kingdom also
abounded so little in commodities, that, had the owners
been strictly protected by law, they could easily have
exacted any price from the King; especially in his fre∣quent
progresses, when he came to distant and poor places, where
the court did not usually reside, and where a regular plan for supplying it could not easily be esta∣blished.</P>
<P>THE magnificent castle of Windsor was built by Ed∣ward
III. and his method of conducing that work
may serve as a specimen of the condition of the
people in that age. Instead of alluring workmen by
contracts and wages, he assessed every county in England
to send him so many masons, tilers, and carpenters, as
if he had been levying an army<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ashmole's hist. of the garter, p. 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEY mistake, indeed, very much the genius of this
reign, who imagine that it was not very arbitrary. All
the high prerogatives of the crown were to the full ex∣erted
in it; but what was some consolation, and pro∣mised
in time some relief to the people, they were always
complained of by the commons: Such as the dispensing
power<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 148.</NOTE>; the extension of the forests<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 71.</NOTE>; the erecting mo∣nopolies<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 56, 61, 122.</NOTE>,
the first of the kind which we read of; the exacting of loans<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. v. p. 491, 574. Cotton's Abridg. p. 56.</NOTE>;
the stopping of justice by particular
warrants<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 114.</NOTE>; the renewal of the commissions of <HI>trai∣lbaton</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 67.</NOTE>;
the pressing of men and ships into the public
service<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 47, 79, 113.</NOTE>;
the levying of arbitrary and exorbitant fines<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 32.</NOTE>;
the extending the authority of the privy council or star∣chamber
to the decision of private causes<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 74.</NOTE>; the enlarging
<PB N="507" REF="538"/>
the power of the mareschal's and other arbitrary courts<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 74.</NOTE>;
the imprisoning members for freedom of speech in parlia∣ment<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 189, 190.</NOTE>;
the obliging people without any rule to send re∣curits
of men at arms, archers, and hoblers, to the army<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel's Hist. vol. iii. p. 554. from the records.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT there was no act of arbitrary power more fre∣quently
repeated in this reign, than that of the imposition
of taxes without consent of parliament. Tho' that as∣sembly
granted the King more supplies than ever had been obtained by any of his predecessors, his great under∣takings
and the necessity of his affairs obliged him still to
levy more; and after his great success against France had
added weight to his authority, these impositions became
almost annual and perpetual. Cotton's Abridgement of
the records affords numerous instances of this kind, in
the first<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 363.</NOTE> year of his reign, in the thirteenth year<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P. 17, 18.</NOTE>, in
the fourteenth<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P. 39.</NOTE>, in the twentieth<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 47.</NOTE>, in the twenty-first<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">P. 52, 53, 57, 58.</NOTE>,
in the twenty-second<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">P. 69.</NOTE>, in the twenty-fifth<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">P. 76.</NOTE>, in the thir∣ty-eighth<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">P. 101.</NOTE>,
in the fiftieth<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">P. 138.</NOTE>, and in the fifty-first<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">P. 152.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King openly avowed and maintained this power
of levying taxes at pleasure. At one time, he replied to
the remonstrance of the commons, that the impositions
had been exacted from great necessity, and had been
assented to by the prelates, counts, barons, and <HI>some</HI> of
the commons<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 53. He repeats the same answer in p. 60. <HI>Some of the commons</HI> were such as he was pleased to consult with.</NOTE>; at another, that he would advise with
his council<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 57.</NOTE>. When the parliament desired, that a law
might be enacted for the punishment of such as levied these arbitrary impositions; he refused compliance<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 138.</NOTE>. In
<PB N="508" REF="539"/>
the subsequent year, they desire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the King might
renounce this pretended prerogative; but his answer
was, that he would levy no taxes without necessity, for
the defence of the realm, and where he reasonably might
use that authority<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 152.</NOTE>. This incident patted a very few
days before his death; and these were, in a manner, his last words to his people. It would seem, that the famous
charter or statute of Edward I. <HI>de tallagio non concedendo,</HI>
tho' never repealed, was supposed to have already lost by
age all its authority.</P>
<P>THESE facts can only show the <HI>practice</HI> of the times:
For as to the <HI>right,</HI> the continual remonstrances of the
commons may seem to prove that it rather lay on their
side: At least, these remonstrances served to prevent the
arbitrary practices of the court from becoming an esta∣blished
part of the constitution. In so much a better
condition were the privileges of the people even during
the arbitrary reign of Edward III. than during some
subsequent ones, particularly those of the Tudors, where
no tyranny or abuse of power ever met with any check
or opposition, or so much as a remonstrance, from par∣liament.</P>
<P>IT is easy to imagine, that a prince of so much sense
and spirit as Edward, would be no slave to the court of
Rome. Tho' the old tribute was paid during some years
of his minority<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 434.</NOTE>, he afterwards withheld it; and when
the Pope in 1367 threatened to cite him to the court of
Rome, for default of payment, he laid the matter before
his parliament. That assembly unanimously declared, that
King John could not, without a national consent, subject
his kingdom to a foreign power: And they were
therefore determined to support their sovereign against
this exorbitant pretenfion<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Abridg. p. 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="509" REF="540"/>
DURING this reign, the statute of provisors was
enacted, rendering it penal to procure any presentations
to benefices from the court of Rome, and securing the
rights of all patrons and electors, which had been ex∣tremely
encroached on by the Pope<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">25 Edw. III. 27 Edw. III.</NOTE>. By a subsequent
statute, every person was out-laved who carried any
cause or appeal to the court of Rome<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">27 Edw. III. 38 Edw. III.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE laity at this time seem to have been extremely
prejudiced against the papal power, and even somewhat
against their own clergy, because of their connexions
with the Roman pontiff. They pretended that the usur∣pations
of the Pope were the cause of all the plagues,
injuries, famine, and poverty of the realm; was more
destructive to it than all the wars; and was the cause
why it contained not a third of the inhabitants and com∣modities,
which it formerly possessed: That the taxes,
levied by him, exceeded five times those paid to the King:
That every thing was venal in that sinful city of Rome;
and that even the patrons in England had thence learned
to practice simony without remorse or scruple<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 74, 128, 129.</NOTE>. At
another time, they petition the King to employ no
churchman in any office of state<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 112.</NOTE>; and they even speak,
in plain terms, of expelling by force the papal authority,
and thereby providing a remedy against oppressions, which
they neither could nor would any longer endure<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 41.</NOTE>. Men
who talked in this strain, were not sar from the reforma∣tion:
But Edward did not think proper to second all this
zeal. Tho' he passed the statute of provisors, he took
little care of its execution; and the parliament made fre∣quent
complaints of his negligence on this head<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 119, 128, 129, 130, 148.</NOTE>. He
was content with having reduced such of the Romish ec∣clesiastics,
<PB N="510" REF="541"/>
as possessed revenues in England, to depend
entirely upon him by means of that statute.</P>
<P>As to the police of the kingdom during this period, it
was certainly better than during the times of faction,
civil wars, and disorder, to which England was so often
exposed: Yet were there several vices in the constitution,
the bad consequences of which all the power and vigi∣lance
of the King could not prevent. The barons, by
their confederacies with those of their own order, and by
supporting and defending their retainers in every iniquity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">11 Edw. III. cap. 14. 4 Edw. III. cap. 2. 15 Edw. III. cap. 4</NOTE>,
were the chief abettors of robbers, murderers, and ruf∣fians
of all kinds; and no law could be executed against
these criminals. The nobility were brought to give their
promise in parliament, that they would not avow, retain,
or support any felon or breaker of the law<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 10.</NOTE>; yet this
engagement, which we may wonder to see exacted from
men of their rank, was never regarded by them. The
commons make continual complaints of the multitude of
robberies, murders, ravishment of women, and other
disorders, which, they say, were become numberless in
every part of the kingdom, and which they always ascribe
to the protection which the criminals received from the
great<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 51, 62, 64, 70, 160.</NOTE>. The King of Cyprus, who paid a visit to Eng∣land
during this reign, was robbed and stript on the
high-way with his whole retinue<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Walsing. p. 179.</NOTE>. Edward himself
contributed to this dissolution of law, by his facility in
granting pardons to felons from the solicitation of his
courtiers. Laws were made to retrench this preroga∣tive<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Edw. III. cap. 2. 27 Edw. III. Cap. 2.</NOTE>,
and remonstrances of the commons were presented
against the abuse of it<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p 75.</NOTE>: But to no purpose. The gra∣tifying
a nobleman of power and interest continued still
<PB N="511" REF="542"/>
to be of more importance than the protection of the peo∣ple.
The King also granted many franchises, which
interrupted the course of justice and the execution of the laws<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COMMERCE and industry were certainly at a very low
ebb during this period. The bad police of the country
alone affords a sufficient reason. The only exports were
wool, skins, hydes, leather, butter, tin, lead, and such
unmanufactured goods, of which wool was by far the
most considerable. Knyghton has asserted, that 100,000
sacks of wool were annually exported, and sold at twenty
pounds a sack, money of that age. But he is widely
mistaken both in the quantity exported and the value.
In 1349, the parliament remonstrate, that the King, by
an illegal imposition of forty shillings on each sack ex∣ported,
had levied 60,000 pounds a year<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 48, 69.</NOTE>: Which re∣duces
the annual exports to 30,000 sacks. A sack con∣tained
twenty-six stone, and each stone fourteen pounds<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">34 Edw. III. cap. 5.</NOTE>;
and at a medium was not valued at above five pounds a
sack<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 29.</NOTE>, that is, fourteen or fifteen pounds of our present
money. Knyghton's computation raises it to sixty pounds,
which is near four times the present price of wool in
England. According to this reduced computation, the
export of wool returned about 450,000 pounds of our
present money, instead of six millions, which is an ex∣travagant
sum.</P>
<P>EDWARD endeavoured to introduce and promote the
woollen manufacture by giving protection and encou∣ragement
to foreign weavers<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">11 Edw. III. cap. 5. Rymer, vol. iv. p. 723. Murimuth, p. 88.</NOTE>, and by enacting a law,
prohibiting every one to wear any cloth but of English
make<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">11 Edw. III, cap. 2.</NOTE>. The parliament prohibited the exportation of
<PB N="512" REF="543"/>
woollen goods, which was not so well judged, especially
while the exportation of unwrought wool was so much
allowed and encouraged. A like injudicious law was
made against the exportation of manufactured iron<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">28 Edw. III. cap. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the first of Richard II. the parliament complains
extremely of the decay of shipping during the preceding
reign, and assert, that one sea-port formerly contained
more vessels than were then to be found in the whole
kingdom. This calamity, they ascribe to the arbitrary
seizure of ships by Edward, for the service of his frequent
expeditions<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 155, 164.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE parliament attempted the impracticable scheme of
reducing the price of labour after the pestilence, and also
that of poultry<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">37 Edw. III. cap. 3.</NOTE>. A reaper, in the first week of Au∣gust,
was not allowed to take above two pence a day, or
near six pence of our present money; in the second week
a third more. A master carpenter was limited thro' the
whole year to three pence a day, a common carpenter to
two pence, money of that age<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">25 Edw. III. cap. 1, 3.</NOTE>. It is remarkable, that
in the same reign, the pay of a common soldier, an ar∣cher,
was six pence a day; which, by the change, both
in denomination and value, would be equivalent to four
or five shillings of our present money<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's baronage, vol. i. p. 784. Brady's hist. vol. ii. App. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 92. The pay of a man at arms was quadruple. We may there∣fore conclude, that the numerous armies, mentioned by historians in those times, consisted chiefly of ragamuffins, who followed the camp, and lived by plunder. Edward's army before Calais consisted of 31,094 men; yet its pay for sixteen months was only 127,201 pounds. Bra∣dy▪ ibid.</NOTE>. Soldiers were
then inlisted only for a very short time: They lived idle
all the rest of the year, and commonly all the rest of
their lives: One successful campaign, by pay and plun∣der,
and the ransom of prisoners, was supposed to be a
<PB N="513" REF="544"/>
small fortune to a man; which was a great allurement
to enter into the service<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Commodities seem to have risen since the Conquest. Instead of being ten times cheaper than at present, they were in the age of Edward III. only three or four times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE staple of wool, wool-fells, leather, and lead, was
fixed by act of parliament in particular towns of Eng∣land<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">27 Edw. III.</NOTE>.
Afterwards it was removed by law to Calais:
But Edward, who commonly deemed his prerogative su∣perior
to law, paid little regard to these statutes; and
when the parliament remonstrated with him on account
of such acts of power, he told them plainly, that he
would proceed in that matter as he thought proper<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 117.</NOTE>. It
is not easy to perceive any advantages, which arose from
this great anxiety of fixing a staple; unless perhaps it
invited foreigners to a market, when they knew before∣hand,
that they would meet there with great choice of
any particular species of commodity. This policy of in∣viting
foreigners to Calais was carried so far, that all
English merchants were prohibited by law from exporting
any English goods from the staple; which was in a man∣ner
the total abandoning all navigation, except that to
Calais<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">27 Edw. III. cap. 7.</NOTE>. A contrivance seemingly very absurd and ex∣traordinary.</P>
<P>LUXURY was complained of in that age, as well as in
others of more refinement; and attempts were made by
parliament to restrain it, particularly on the head of ap∣parel,
where surely it is the most obviously innocent and
inoffenfive. No man under an hundred a year was al∣lowed
to wear gold, silver, or silk in his cloaths:
Servants also were prohibited from eating flesh meat, or
fish, above once a day<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">37 Edw. III. cap. 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.</NOTE>. It was easy to foresee that
<PB N="514" REF="545"/>
such ridiculous laws must prove ineffectual, and could
never be executed.</P>
<P>THE use of the French language, in pleadings and
public deeds, was abolished<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">36 Edward III. cap. 15.</NOTE>. It may appear strange,
that the nation should so long have worn this badge of
conquest. But the King and nobility seem never to have
become thoroughly English, till Edward's wars with
France gave them an antipathy to that nation. Yet still,
it was long before the use of the English tongue came
into fashion. The first English paper which we meet
with in Rymer is in the year 1386, during the reign of
Richard II.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. p. 526. This paper, by the stile, seems to have been drawn by the Scots, and was signed only by the wardens of the marches.</NOTE> There are Spanish papers in that collec∣tion
more antient<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vi. p. 554.</NOTE>: And the use of the Latin and French
still continued.</P>
<P>IN 1364, the commons petitioned, that in considera∣tion
of the preceding pestilence, such persons as possessed
manors holding of the King in chief, and had let liferent
leases without obtaining licences, might continue to ex∣ercise
the same power, till the country was become more
populous<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>. The commons were sensible, that this se∣curity
of possession was a good means for rendering the
kingdom prosperous and flourishing; yet durst not apply,
all at once, for a greater relaxation of their chains.</P>
<P>THERE is not a reign among those of the antient Eng∣lish
monarchs, which deserves more to be studied than
that of Edward III. nor one where the domestic transac∣tions
will better discover the true genius of that kind of
mixed government, which was then established in Eng∣land.
The struggles, with regard to the validity and
authority of the great charter, were now over: The
King was acknowledged to lie under some limitations:
<PB N="515" REF="546"/>
Edward himself was a prince of great capacity, not go∣verned
by favourites, nor led astray by any unruly pas∣sion,
sensible that nothing could be more essential to his
interests than to keep on good terms with his people:
Yet on the whole it appears, that the government, at
best, was only a barbarous monarchy, not regulated by
any fixed maxims, nor bounded by any certain undis∣puted
rights, which were in practice regularly observed.
The King conducted himself by one set of principles;
the barons by another; the commons by a third; the
clergy by a fourth. All these systems of government
were contrary and incompatible: Each of them prevailed
according as incidents were favourable to it: A great
prince rendered the monarchical power predominant:
The weakness of a King gave reins to the aristocracy:
A superstitious age saw the clergy triumphant: The
people, for whom alone government was instituted, and
who alone deserve consideration, were commonly the
weakest of the whole. But the commons, little ob∣noxious
to any other order; though they sunk under
the violence of tempests, silently reared their head in
more peaceable times; and while the storm was brewing,
were courted by all sides, and thus received still some
accession to their privileges, or, at worst, some confir∣mation
of them.</P>
