<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I shall only say in excuse for offering this work to
your Ladyship, that if I could write any thing re∣ally
deserving your acceptance, I should not prefix your
name to such trifles as the following sheets. But my
gratitude for the goodness and unmerited distinction
which your Ladyship has so long shown me, is impa∣tient
to express itself; and though in the present case
<PB REF="5"/>
I am rather an editor than an author, yet having little
purpose of appearing again in the latter character, I
am forced to pay my debts to your Ladyship with
Mr. Vertue's coin. If his industry has amassed any
thing that can amuse one or two of your idle hours,
when neither affection, friendship, nor the several du∣ties
which you fill with so much ease and dignity,
have any demands upon you, I shall think his life was
well employed; I am sure my time will have been so,
if I have made him tolerable company to my lady
Hervey, who has conversed familiarly with the most
agreable persons dead and living of the most polished
ages and most polished nations.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, <HI>MADAM,</HI>
your Ladyship's
most obedient Servant,

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN one offers to the public the labours of another person,
it is allowable and precedented to expatiate in praise of the
work. Of this indulgence however I shall not make ad∣vantage.
The industry of Mr. Vertue was sufficiently known: the
antiquarian world had singular obligations to him. The many valu∣able
monuments relating to our history, and to the persons of our mo∣narchs
and great men, which he saved from oblivion, are lasting evi∣dences
of his merit. What thanks are due to him for the materials of
the following sheets, the public must determine. So far from endea∣vouring
to prepossess them in favour of the work, it shall be my part
fairly to tell them what they must expect.</P>
<P>In Italy, where the art of painting has been carried to an amazing
degree of perfection, the lives of the painters have been written in num∣berless
volumes, alone sufficient to compose a little library. Every pic∣ture
of every considerable master is minutely described. Those bio∣graphers
treat of the works of Raphael and Corregio with as much
importance as commentators speak of Horace or Virgil; and indulging
themselves in the inflated style of their language, they talk of pictures
as works almost of a divinity, while at the same time they lament them
<PB N="vi" REF="7" MS="y"/>
as perishing before their eyes. France, neither possessed of such masters,
nor so hyperbolic in their diction, contrives however to supply by va∣nity
what is wanting in either. Poussin is their miracle of genius; Le
Brun would dispute precedence with half the Roman school. A whole
volume is written even on the life and works of Mignard. Voltaire,
who understands almost every thing, and who does not suspect that
judgment in painting is one of his deficiences, speaks ridiculously in
commendation of some of their performers.</P>
<P>This country, which does not always err in vaunting it's own produc∣tions,
has not a single volume to show on the works of it's painters.
In truth, it has very rarely given birth to a genius in that profession.
Flanders and Holland have sent us the greatest men that we can boast.
This very circumstance may with reason prejudice the reader against a
work, the chief business of which must be to celebrate the arts of a
country which has produced so few good artists. This objection is so
striking, that instead of calling it <HI>The Lives of English Painters,</HI> I
have simply given it the title of <HI>Anecdotes of Painting in England.</HI> As
far as it answers that term, perhaps it will be found curious. The in∣defatigable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ains of Mr. Vertue left nothing unexplored that could il∣luminate
his subject, and collaterally led him to many particularities
that are at least amusing: I call them no more, nor would I advise any
man, who is not fond of curious trifles, to take the pains of turning
over these leaves. From the antiquarian I expect greater thanks; he is
more cheaply pleased than a common reader: the one demands to be
diverted, at least instructed—the other requires only to be informed.</P>
<P>Mr. Vertue had for several years been collecting materials for this
work: He conversed and corresponded with most of the virtuosi in
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
England; he was personally acquainted with the oldest performers in
the science; he minuted down every thing he heard from them. He
visited every collection, made catalogues of them, attended sales, co∣pied
every paper he could find relative to the art, searched offices, re∣gisters
of parishes and registers of wills for births and deaths, turned
over all our own authors, and translated those of other countries which
related to his subject. He wrote down every thing he heard, saw, or
read. His collections amounted to near forty volumes large and
small: In one of his pocket-books I found a note of his first intention
of compiling such a work; it was in 1713; he continued it assiduously
to his death in 1757. These MSS. I bought of his widow after his
decease; and it will perhaps surprize the reader to find how near a
compleat work is offered to him, though the research was commenced
at so late a period: I call it commenced; what little had been done
before on this subject, was so far from assistance, it was scarce of use.
The sketch, called, <HI>An Essay towards an English School,</HI> at the end of
the translation of Depiles, is as superficial as possible; nor could a fact
scarce be borrowed from it 'till we come to very modern times. In
general I have been scrupulous in acknowledging both Mr. Vertue's
debts and my own. The catalogues of the works of Hollar and Simon,
and those of the collection of King Charles I. King James II. and the
Duke of Buckingham, were part of Mr. Vertue's original plan, which
is now compleated by these volumes.</P>
<P>The compiler had made several draughts of a beginning, and several
lives he had written out, but with no order, no connection, no accu∣racy;
nor was his style clear or correct enough to be offered to the
reader in that unpolished form. I have been obliged to compose
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>
a-new every article, and have recurred to the original fountains from
whence he drew his information; I mean, where it was taken from
books. The indigested method of his collections, registered occasio∣nally
as he learned every circumstance, was an additional trouble, as I
was forced to turn over every volume many and many times, as they
laid in confusion, to collect the articles I wanted; and for the second
and third parts, containing between three and four hundred names, I
was reduced to compose an index myself to the forty volumes. One
satisfaction the reader will have, in the integrity of Mr. Vertue; it
exceeded his industry, which is saying much. No man living, so bi∣gotted
to a vocation, was ever so incapable of falshood He did not
deal even in hypothesis, scarce in conjecture. He visited, and revisited
every picture, every monument, that was an object of his researches;
and being so little a slave to his own imagination, he was cautious of
trusting to that of others. In his memorandums he always put a quaere
against whatever was told him of suspicious aspect; and never gave cre∣dit
to it 'till he received the fullest satisfaction. Thus whatever trifles
the reader finds, he will have the comfort of knowing that the greatest
part at least are of most genuine authority. Whenever I have added
to the compiler's stores, I have generally taken care to quote as religi∣ously
the source of my intelligence. Here and there I have tried to
enliven the dryness of the subject by inserting facts not totally foreign
to it. Yet upon the whole I despair of it's affording much entertain∣ment.
The public have a title to whatever was designed for them: I
offer this to them as a debt—nobody will suspect that I should have
chosen such a subject for fame.</P>
<P>If the observation of a dearth of great names in this list should ex∣cite
emulation, and tend to produce abler masters, Mr. Vertue, I be∣lieve,
<PB N="ix" REF="10"/>
and I should be glad to have the continuation of the work do
greater honour to our country. It would be difficult perhaps to assign
a physical reason, why a nation that produced Shakespear, should owe
it's glory in another walk of genius to Holbein and Vandyck. It can∣not
be imputed to want of protection: Who countenanced the arts
more than Charles the First? That Prince, who is censured for his want
of taste in pensioning Quarles, is celebrated by the same pen for em∣ploying
Bernini—but want of protection is the apology for want of
genius: Milton and Fontaine did not write in the bask of court-favour.
A poet or a painter may want an equipage or a villa, by wanting pro∣tection:
They can always afford to buy ink and paper, colours and
pencils. Mr. Hogarth has received no honours, but universal admi∣ration.</P>
<P>But whatever has been the complaint formerly, we have ground to
hope that a new aera is receiving it's date. Genius is countenanced,
and emulation will follow; Nor is it a bad indication of the flourish∣ing
state of a country, that it daily makes improvements in arts and
sciences. They may be attended by luxury, but they certainly are pro∣duced
by wealth and happiness. The conveniences, the decorations of
life are not studied in Siberia, or under a Nero. If severe morality
would at any time expect to establish a thorough reformation, I fear it
must chuse inhospitable climates, and abolish all latitude from the
laws. A corporation of merchants would never have kept their oaths
to Lycurgus of observing his statutes 'till he returned. A good go∣vernment,
that indulges it's subjects in the exercise of their own
thoughts, will see a thousand inventions springing up, refinements will
follow, and much pleasure and satisfaction will be produced at least be∣fore
that excess arrives, which is so justly said to be the forerunner of
<PB N="x" REF="11"/>
ruin. But all this is in the common course of things, which tend to
perfection, and then degenerate. He would be a very absurd legisla∣tor,
who should pretend to set bounds to his country's welfare, lest it
should perish by knowing no bounds. Poverty will stint itself; riches
must be left to their own discretion; they depend upon trade, and to
circumscribe trade is to annihilate it. It is not rigid nor Roman to say
it, but a people had better be unhappy by their own fault, than by that
of their government. A <HI>Censor morum</HI> is not a much greater blessing
than an <HI>Arbiter elegantiarum.</HI> The world, I believe, is not at all agreed
that the austerities of the Presbyterians were preferable to the licenti∣ousness
under Charles II. I pretend to defend the one no more than
the other; but I am sure that in the body politic, symptoms that prog∣nosticate
ill, may indicate well. All I meaned to say was, that the dis∣position
to improvements in this country is the consequence of its' vi∣gour.
The establishment of a society for the encouragement of arts
will produce great benefits before they are perverted to mischiefs.
The bounties bestowed by that society, for facilitating the necessaries
of life to the poor, for encouraging the use of our own drugs and ma∣terials,
or for naturalizing those of other countries, are bestowed on
noble principles and with patriot views. That society does not ne∣glect
even the elegancies of life: Arts that are innocent in themselves,
and beneficial to the country, either by adding value to our produc∣tions,
or by drawing riches as they invite strangers to visit us, are
worthy the attention of good citizens; and in all those lights that so∣ciety
acts upon a national and extensive plan.</P>
<P>The art, that is chiefly the subject of these pages, is one of the least
likely to be perverted: Painting has seldom been employed to any bad
purpose. Pictures are but the scenery of devotion. I question if Ra∣phael
<PB N="xi" REF="12"/>
himself could ever have made one convert, though he had ex∣hausted
all the expression of his eloquent pencil on a series of popish
doctrines and miracles. Pictures cannot adapt themselves to the
meanest capacities, as unhappily the tongue can. Nonsense may make
an apprentice a catholic or a methodist; but the apprentice would see
that a very bad picture of St. Francis was not like truth; and a very
good picture would be above his feeling. Pictures may serve as helps
to religion; but are only an appendix to idolatry; for the people must
be taught to believe in false gods and in the power of saints, before
they will learn to worship their images. I do not doubt but if some
of the first reformers had been at liberty to say exactly what they
thought, and no more than they thought, they would have permitted
one of the most ingenious arts implanted in the heart of man by the Su∣preme
Being to be employed towards his praise. But Calvin by his te∣nure,
as head of a sect, was obliged to go all lengths. The vulgar will
not list but for total contradictions: They are not struck by seeing re∣ligion
shaded only a little darker or a little lighter. It was at Constan¦tinople
alone where the very shopkeepers had subtlety enought to fight
for a letter more or less in a Greek adjective<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the decline of the empire there were two sects who proceeded to the greatest violences against each other in the dispute whether the nature of the second person was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, co-essentialis; or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, similis essentiae.</NOTE> that expressed an abstract
idea. Happily at this time there is so total an extinction of all party-animosity
both in religion and politics, that men are at liberty to pro∣pose
whatever may be usefull to their country, without it's being impu∣ted
to them as a crime, and to invent what they mean should give
pleasure without danger of displeasing by the very attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="13"/>
At this epoch of common sense, one may reasonably expect to see the
arts flourish to as proud a height as they attained at Athens, Rome, or
Florence. Painting has hitherto made but faint Efforts in England.
Our eloquence and the glory of our arms have been carried to the
highest pitch. The more peacefull arts have in other countries gene∣rally
attended national glory. If there are any talents among us, this
seems the crisis for their appearance: The Throne itself is now the altar
of the graces, and whoever sacrifices to them becomingly, is sure that
his offerings will be smiled upon by a Prince, who is at once the exam∣ple
and patron of accomplishments. The institution of a school of
statuary in the house of a young<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Duke of Richmond.</NOTE> Nobleman of the first rank rivals the
boasted munificence of foreign Princes. When we abound with heroes,
orators and patrons, it will be hard if their images are not transmitted
to posterity under gracefull representations.</P>
<P>This is by no means said to depreciate the artists we have, but to in∣spire
with emulation those arising. Rysbrack, Roubiliac, Scheemaker,
Wilton, would do honour to any country: But hitherto their skill has
been in a manner confined to private monuments. When we have sub∣jects
for history, the people should read on public edifices the actions
of their ancestors and fellow-citizens in basreliefs: Busts and statues
should reward the galant behaviour of the brave, and exhibit them as
models. What made Rome more venerable than every street being an
illustration of Livy? Painting has been circumscribed within as selfish
bounds as statuary; historic compositions totally neglected. Reynolds
and Ramsay have wanted subjects, not genius. There is another artist,
who seems born for an age of naval glory, and is equal to it, Mr. Scott.
<PB N="xiii" REF="14"/>
Architecture, the most suitable field in which the genius of a people,
arrived at superiority, may range, seems reviving. The taste and skill
of Mr. Adam is formed for public works. Mr. Chambers's treatise<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On civil architecture, folio, 1759.</NOTE>
is the most sensible book and the most exempt from prejudices that ever
was written on that science. But of all the works that distinguish this
age, none perhaps excell those beautifull editions of Balbec and Palmy∣ra—not
published at the command of a Louis quatorze, or at the ex∣pence
of a cardinal nephew, but undertaken by private curiosity and
good sense, and trusted to the taste of a polished nation. When I en∣deavour
to do justice to the editions of Palmyra and Balbec, I would not
confine the encomium to the sculptures; the books have far higher me∣rit.
The modest descriptions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">By Mr. Wood.</NOTE> prefixed are standards of writing: The
exact measure of what should and should not be said, and of what was
necessary to be known, was never comprehended in more clear diction,
or more elegant stile. The pomp of the buildings has not a nobler air
than the simplicity of the narration.—but I must restrain myself; tho'
it is pleasing to expatiate on the just praise of one's country; and they
who cannot perform great things themselves, may yet have a satisfaction
in doing justice to those who can. If Juvenal was honest in his satires,
he would have been hapy if he could have lived to write the panegy∣ric
of Trajan.</P>

<P>THEY who undertake to write the History of any art, are fond
of carrying it's origine as far back as possible. When This
tends to show the improvements made in it, by comparing
latter works with the first rude inventions, it may be of service; but
it often happens that the Historian thinks the antiquity of a discovery
reflects honour on his country, though perhaps his country has been so
careless or has wanted genius so much, as to have refined very little on
the original hints. Some men push this farther, and venerate the first
dawnings of an art more than it's productions in a riper age. The
inventor may have had more genius, but the performances of the im∣prover
must be more perfect. Mr. Vertue had taken great pains to
prove that painting existed in England before the restoration of it in
Italy by Cimabue. If what we possessed of it in those ignorant times
could be called painting, I suppose Italy and every nation in Europe re∣tained
enough of the deformity of the art to contest with us in point of
antiquity. That We had gone backwards in the science farther almost
than any other country, is evident from our coins, on which there is no
more of human similitude, than an infant's first scrawl of the profile of
<PB N="2" REF="17"/>
a face; and so far therefore as badness of drawing approaches to anti∣quity
of ignorance, we may lay in our claim to very ancient possession.
As Italy has so long excelled us in the refinement of the art, she may
leave us the enjoyment of original imperfection.</P>
<P>However, as Mr. Vertue's partiality flowed from love of his coun∣try,
and as this is designed for a work of curiosity, not of speculation
and reasoning, I shall faithfully lay before the reader such materials as
that laborious antiquarian had amassed for deducing the History of
English Painting from a very early period.</P>
<P>The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Thorpe M. D. when writing his his<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory of the town and dio∣cese of Rochester, discovered at the west end of that cathedral two busts of Henry I. and his queen in stone, which had never been observed be∣fore.</NOTE> first evidences in favour of the art are drawn from our records<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Since the first edition of this work I have been informed by a curi∣ous gentleman, that the earliest place in a catalogue of English painters is due to St. Wolstan bishop of Worcester in 1062, or at least to Erve∣nius or Erwen, his master. William of Malmsbury, who wrote the life of Wolstan in three books, gives the following account; “Habebat tunc [Wolstanus] magistrum Ervenium nomine, inscribendo et quidlibet colo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibus effingendo peritum. Is libros scriptos, sacramentarium &amp; psalterium, quorum principales litteras auro effigiaverit, puero Wolstano delegandos cu∣ravit. Ille preciosorum apicum captus miraculo, dum pulchritudinem inten∣tis oculis rimatur, scientiam litterarum internis hausit medullis. Verum doctor ad saeculi spectans commodum, spe majoris premii, sacramentarium regi, tunc temporis Cnutoni, psalsterium Emmae reginae contribuit. Percu∣lit puerilem animum <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acti dispendium, &amp; ex imo pectore alta traxit suspi∣ria.” If this passage is not sufficient authority, as I think it is not, to prove St. Wolstan a painter, at least it is decisive for Ervenius, who was certainly an illuminator of MSS.</NOTE>,
<PB N="3" REF="18"/>
which Mr. Vertue had carefully consulted. There he found the
following entries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There are two records more ancient than any that follow; but they relate to architecture, not painting; however, as not foreign to this work, I shall insert them here: They are both of the reign of King JOHN:</P>

<P>William Puintell might be only a surveyor, but Elyas was certainly an architect.</P></NOTE>;</P>

suis salutem. Liberate cuidam pictori 20<HI>s.</HI> ad cameram magni scac∣carii
depingendam.”</P>
<P>This does not express the kind; whether the chamber was to be
painted with figures, ornaments, &amp;c. or whether the <HI>Quidam Pictor</HI>
was not a meer house-painter; probably an artist of higher rank, as
twenty shillings would have been a great price in that age for painting
wainscot. However the next record is more explicit, and ascertains the
point in question.</P>

<P>There are more remarkable circumstances than one in this venerable
scrap: as, the simplicity of the times; the king sending a precept to
<PB N="4" REF="19"/>
the sheriff of Hampshire to have a chamber in the royal castle
painted; and his majesty, like the Roman general, who threatened his
soldiers if they broke any of the antique Corinthian statues that they
should pay for having others made, giving orders to the same sheriff
to have the chamber repainted with the same pictures and histories with
which it had been adorned before; and which, by the way, implies,
that history-painting had been in use still longer than this date, which
was the earliest Mr. Vertue could discover<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some have ascribed the introduction of painting into this island to venerable Bede.</NOTE></P>

gentes videre possint,</HI> and for white-washing the chapel of St. John, and
for making three glass windows in the same chapel, in which were to
be represented, a little Virgin Mary holding the child, and the Tri∣nity
and St. John the Apostle. It gives orders too that (Patibulum) a
cross should be painted behind the altar, <HI>bene et bonis coloribus;</HI> and
where ever it could be done most conveniently, there were to be drawn
in the same chapel two images of St. Edward holding out a ring and
delivering it to St. John the Evangelist. “Et dealbari faciatis, adds
the record, totum veterem murum circa sepedictam turrim nostram.
Et custum quod ad hoc posueritis, per visum et testimonium legali∣um
hominum, computabitur vobis ad scaccarium. Teste rege
apud Windesor. x. die Decembr.”</P>
<P>It is evident from this and some following passages that as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Aubrey's MS. survey of Wiltshire, in the library of the Royal Society, he says, on the authority of Sir W. Dugdale, that the first painted glass in England was done in king John's time. Vol. ii. p. 85.</NOTE> paint∣ing
<PB N="6" REF="21"/>
on glass was then known, the art of painting in general could not
be at a very low ebb.</P>
<P>Then follows another, regarding the same place; “Rex eisdem sa∣lutem.
Praecipimus vobis quod cancellum beatae Mariae in ecclesiâ

Petri in eadem ecclesia, et ab introitu cancelli beati Petri usque ad

<P>The next again specifies the sum to be expended on paintings at
Westminster: “Rot. Liberat. A°. 21. HEN. III. m. 5. Rex thesau∣rario

aurifabro custodi operationis nostrae Westm. quatuor libras et unde∣cim

<P>The next contains the first mention we have of a star-chamber.</P>
<P>“Liberat. A°. 22. HEN. III. m. 3. Mandatum est vic. Southampt.
quod cameram apud Winton colorari faciat viridi colore, et <HI>stellari</HI>
auro, in quibus depingantur historiae veteris et novi testamenti.”</P>
<P>The next precept is very remarkable, as implying the use of oil-colours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John ab Eyck the supposed inventor of painting in oil, which He was said to discover in a search for varnish, died in 1441. In the record before us, both oil and varnish are mentioned, and the former might indeed be only used in the com∣position of the latter.</NOTE> long before that method is supposed to have been discovered.
It is dated in his 23d year, 1239, and runs in these words;</P>
<P>“Rex thesaurario et camerariis suis salutem. Liberate de thesauro
nostro Odoni aurifabro et Edwardo filio suo centum et septemdecem

sanctae trinitatis anno regni nostri xxiii usque ad festum sancti Bar∣nabae
apostoli eodem anno, scilicet per xv dies.”</P>
<P>There is another mandate of his 25th year, for two windows with
pictures in the hall, and with the motto above mentioned, of which
I do not know that any of our antiquarians have taken notice.</P>
<P>The two following precepts are so connected with the foregoing,
that though relating only to building not to painting, I shall insert
them here, as their most proper place.</P>
<P>“A°. 28. HEN. III. Mandatum est vicecomiti Kanciae quod sub omni

praecepit: et talem et tam festinantem diligentiam ad hoc mandatum
regis exequendum ponat, quod se inde rex commendare debeat: et
ne W. De Haverhull thesaurarius ed Edwardus, quibus operationes
praedictas rex injunxit faciendas, culpam dilationis in se refundere
possint, si praedictae operationes contra voluntatem regis differantur.”</P>
<P>“Rex dedit et concessit Deo et beato Edwardo et ecclesiae Westmo∣nasterii
ad fabricam ipsius ecclesiae 2591 libras, in quibus regi tene∣tur
Licoricia, quae fuit uxor David de Oxonio Judaei. Et rex vult
quod pecunia illa reddatur ad novum scaccarium, quod rex ad hoc
constituit apud Westmonasterium, archidiacono Westmonasterii, et
Edwardo de Westminstre, quos ejusdem scaccarii thesaurarios assig∣navit.
Teste rege apud Windsore.”</P>
<P>The miserable Latin of these orders is not the most curious part of
them. The hundred barge loads of grey stone to be purchased by the
sheriff of Kent might be either from a Kentish quarry, or to be im∣ported
from the coast of France. The king's great impatience about
his new works, and the large fine from a Jew's widow which he be∣stows
on his new edifice, are very observable. But the most memorable
is the origine of the Exchequer, which seems by this precept to have
been instituted solely for the carrying on the new building at Westmin∣ster.</P>
<P>The next is in the year 1248. “Rex vicecomiti Southamtoniae sa∣lutem.
Praecipimus tibi quod de exitibus comitatus tui depingi fa∣cias

Another. “Rex custodi manerii de Wudestoke praecepit, ut inter

etiam scaccarium fieri faciat in eadem aulâ, quod contineat hunc ver∣sum,

<P>“Claus. 33. HEN. III. m. 3. Rex injunxit magistro Johanni de

<P>In Henry's 34th year Edward of Westminster is ordered to have
painted in the chapel of St. Stephen the images of the apostles round
about the said chapel, by the following precept;</P>
<P>“Claus. 54. HEN. III. m. 7. Mandatum est Edwardo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Edward of Westminster is the same person with Edward Fitz-Odo men∣tioned in the preceding order, and I suppose son of Odo Aurifaber, recorded above. It appears by Dart's History of the Abbey that he was master of the works; and Dart quotes the records in the tower on the authority of Strype. The whole passage is worth transcribing, as it shows the passion of Henry for adorning his new foundation there, called then, The new work at Westminster<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Duchesne, antiq.

<P>“And the queen set up in the feretry of St. Edward the image of the blessed Virgin Mary; and the king caused the aforesaid Edward Fitz-Odo, keeper of his works at Westminster, to place upon her forehead for ornament, an emerald and a ruby, taken out of two rings which the bishop of Chichester had left the king for a legacy.” Dart vol. i. p. 26. edit. 1742.</P></NOTE>.</NOTE> de Westm.

<P>I conclude that master William, William the monk of Westminster,
and William of Florence were the same person. What arts we had, as
well as learning, lay chiefly among the religious in those ages. One re∣mark
I am surprized Mr. Vertue did not make, when he was assigning
<PB N="16" REF="31"/>
greater antiquity to painting in England than in Italy, that this Wil∣liam
of Florence was an Italian.</P>
<P>The two following are little remarkable, except that in the last we
find the name of another painter.</P>
<P>“Liberate A°. 49. HEN. III. m. 7. Rex Thes. et camerariis suis

<P>Besides the palaces above-mentioned, this prince laid out too large
sums in repairing and beautifying Kenelworth castle, cieling the chapel

the wall on the outside, as it remained to the time of Sir William
Dugdale.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his Warwicksh. p. 244.

<P><PB N="18" REF="33" MS="y"/>
I cannot pass over the princess Eleanor, so much celebrated by our
legendary historians for sucking the poison out of her husband's wound,
without mentioning the crosses erected to her memory, which Vertue
with great probability supposed were built on the designs of Peter Ca∣valini,
a Roman sculptor, and whom from various circumstances he
discovered to be the architect of the shrine of Edward the Confessor.</P>
<P>The reader, I am persuaded, will be pleased to see how ingeniously
my author traced out this hitherto unknown fact.</P>
<P>The original inscription on the tomb ran thus:
<Q><L>Anno milleno Domini cum septuageno</L>

<L>Hoc opus est factum, quod Petrus duxit in actum</L>

<L>Rex fuit Henricus, sancti praesentis amicus.</L></Q></P>
<P>The words <HI>Petrus duxit in actum Romanus civis</HI> were discernable 'till
very lately. Some old authors ascribe the erection of the shrine to Hen∣ry
himself, others, to Richard de Ware the Abbat, elected in 1260. It
is probable that both were concerned. The new Abbat repaired to
Rome immediately on his election to receive consecration from Urban
IV. At that time, says Vasari, flourished there Peter Cavalini, a painter
and the inventor of Mosaic, who had performed several costly works
in that city. About four years before the arrival of Abbat Ware, that
<PB N="19" REF="34"/>

exactly in the taste, though not in the precise form of that of St. Ed∣ward.
Nothing is more probable than that a rich abbat, either at his
own expence, or to gratify the taste of his magnificent master should
engage a capital artist to return with him and undertake the shrine of
his master's patron saint, and the great patron of his own church.
Weaver says expresly that the abbat brought back with him from
Rome <HI>Workmen</HI> and rich porphyry stones for Edward the Confessor's
feretory; and for the pavement of the chapel<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Before Henry III. began the present church, there had been a rich shrine for the confessor erected by Wiliiam I. as the latter says expresly in his charter. Edward had bestowed Windsor on the Abbey of Westminster; the conqueror, on his accession, prevailed on the abbat and convent to restore Windsor, in ex∣change for other lands, being delighted with the scite; “Maximè utilis &amp; com∣modus est visus propter contiguam aquam et silvam venationibus aptam,” says he; and after naming the lordships he gave them, he mentions the gift of an hundred pounds of silver to compleat and finish the building of the Abbey, and then adds, “Ob reverentiam nimii amoris quem ego in ipsum inclitum regem Edwardum habueram, Tumbum ejus &amp; reginae juxta cum positae, ex auro et argento fabrili opere artisi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iosi decoris mirificè operiri feci.”</NOTE> This abbat was lord

<P>Vasari's silence on Cavalini's journey to England ought to be no objec∣tion;
he not only wrote some hundred years after the time, but con∣founds
his own account so strangely as to make Peter Cavalini scholar
of Giotto, who was twenty years younger. If it may be imagined that
Richard Ware could not have interest enough to seduce so capital a
workman from the service of the pope, it might still be accounted for,
by higher authority. Edward I. returning from the Holy Land
was conducted by the king of Sicily to Rome to visit Gregory X. who
had been Edward's companion and friend in the Holy War. An artful
Pope would certainly be glad to furnish a young king with artists who
would encourage him in raising shrines and temples. The monument
of Henry III. erected by his son, is beautified in the same taste with
porphyry and mosaic; and the first brazen statue known to have been
cast here, lies upon it. The old paintings round the chapel of St. Ed∣ward,
and those, in a very beautiful and superior style, though much
decayed, over the ragged regiment, Vertue ascribes to the same Cava∣lini.
This painter and sculptor probably, as I have said, gave the designs
for the crosses erected by Edward to his beloved Eleanor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have some suspicion that a son of Peter Cavalini, is the person called Peter le Orfever, mentioned in a precept of Edward II. He is there intituled of Stanford, and brought an action against certain persons for assault and battery. As one of
Queen Eleanor's crosses was erected there, it is not improbable that a son of Ca∣valini might marry and settle in that town. See Peck's Stanford, lib. x. sect. 13.</NOTE> Vertue
had drawn them, with a design of engraving; I have his original
drawings, I must not omit that it was no small part of Peter Cavalini's
fame, that he made the crucifix that spoke to St. Bridget<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Felibien. vol. i. p. 172.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="36"/>
From all the testimonies above recited, Henry III. appears in a new
light from what has hitherto been known of him. That he was a weak
prince in point of government is indisputable. That he was a great
encourager of the arts, these records demonstrate. When historians
talk of his profusion, they evidence only in what he dissipated on his
favorites. But it is plain that the number and magnificence of his
buildings and palaces must have swallowed great part of the sums, ma∣liciously
charged to the single article of unworthy favorites. It matters
not how a prince squanders what he has tyrannically squeezed from the
subject: If he exceeds his revenue, it is almost as ill spent on edifices
as on ministers. But it is perhaps no more than justice to make some
allowance for partial or exaggerated relations. Henry was not a wise
prince—may I venture to say more—He was not a martial prince.
Even in these more sensible ages one illustrious defect in a king converts
all his other foibles into excellencies. It must have done so much more
in a season of such heroic barbarism as that of Henry III. and the want
of an enterprizing spirit in that prince made even his patronage of the
arts be imputed to effeminacy, or be overlooked. The extravagance of
Louis XIV. in his buildings, gardens, water-works, passed for an ob∣ject
of glory under the canon (if I may say so) of his ambition. Hen∣ry
III. had no conquests to illuminate his cielings, his halls, his basre∣liefs.
Yet perhaps the generous sentiment implied in his motto, <HI>Qui
non dat quod habet, non accipit ille quod optat,</HI> contained more true
glory than all the Fast couched under Louis's emblem of the sun, and
his other ostentatious devices. But let us compare Henry with one
nearer to him. Henry's reign is one of the most ignominious in our
annals; That of Edward the Ist. of the most triumphant. Yet I would
<PB N="22" REF="37"/>
ask by which of the Two did the nation suffer most? By sums lavished
on favorites and buildings; or by sums and blood wasted in unjust
wars? If we look narrowly into Edward's reign, we shall scarce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Parliamentary History.</NOTE> find
fewer representations against the tyranny of the son than against the
encroachments of the father. Who will own that he had not rather
employ master William and Edward of Westminster to paint the gestes
of the kings of Antioch, than imitate the son in his barbarities in
Wales and usurpations in Scotland?</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">State of Painting from the Reign of HENRY III. to the
End of HENRY VI.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the reign of Henry III. Mr. Vertue could discover no re∣cords
relating to the arts for several reigns. I shall endeavour
to fill this hiatus by producing an almost entire chronologic
series of paintings from that time to Henry VII. when Mr. Vertue's
notes recommence.</P>
<P>During the reigns of the two first Edwards I find no vestiges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Except that in the reign of Edward I. Bishop Langton built a palace and hall at Litchfield, in which was painted the ceremony of the coronation, &amp;c. Brown Willis's Cath. vol. i. p. 17.</NOTE> of the
art, though it was certainly preserved here, at least by painting on glass.
No wonder that a proud, a warlike, and ignorant nobility encouraged
only that branch which attested their dignity. Their dungeons were
rendered still darker by their pride. It was the case of all the arts;
none flourished, but what served to display their wealth, or contributed
to their security. They were magnificent without luxury, and pom∣pous
<PB N="24" REF="39"/>
without elegance. Rich plate, even to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Wickham's crozier at Oxford is an instance how well the pomp of prelacy was served by ingenious artists. It is certain that in the reigns of the two first Edwards there were Greek enamellers in England, who both practiced and taught the art. In Dugdale's Warwickshire, p. 397, 403. are mentioned enamel∣led cups very near that period; and some ancient pieces are still extant. The beautifull cup of gold, enamelled with figures in the habits of the time, given by king John to the corporation of Lynn in Norfolk, and still preserved there, gives a very favorable idea of the taste and artisans of an age, a little antecedent to that I am speaking of. King Alfred's jewel, found at Athelney in Somerset∣shire, and of which there is a print in Camden's Britannia, is of much more an∣cient date, but of workmanship far more rude. I call it a jewel, because it seems to have been used as jewels were afterwards, appendent to ribbands. By the cut, I should take it for engraven gold; Camden, which is extraordinary, does not describe the materials, but calls it a picture, which would make one think it was enamelled.</NOTE> the enamelling on gold,
rich stuffs, and curious armour were carried to excess, while their chairs
were mere pedestals, their cloaths were incumbrances, and they knew
no use of steel but as it served for safety or destruction. Their houses,
for there was no medium between castles and hovels, implied the dan∣gers
of society, not the sweets of it; and whenever peace left them lei∣sure
to think of modes, they seemed to imagine that fashion consisted
in transfiguring the human body, instead of adding grace to it. While
the men wore shoes so long and picked, that they were forced to sup∣port
the points by chains from their middle; the ladies erected such py∣ramids
on their heads, that the face became the center of the body; and
they were hardened to these preposterous inconveniencies by their priests,
who instead of leaving them to be cured by the fickleness of fashions,
or by the trouble of them, denounced God's judgments on follies against
<PB N="25" REF="40"/>
which a little laughter and a little common sense had been more effectual
sermons. It was not far distant I think from the period of which I am
speaking that the ladies wore looking-glasses about the same height of
their bodies, with that, on which the men displayed such indecent sym∣bols<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Bruyere has expressed this with the happiest decency; “Ils avoient tróuvè le secret de paroitre nuds tout habillez.” Vol. ii. p. 234.</NOTE>.
The representations of these extravagances (as we see them col∣lected
by Montfaucon in his antiquities of France) demanded Japonese
and Indian painters; were not likely to produce Vandycks and Titians.
While we are curious in tracing the progress of barbarism, we wonder
more that any arts existed, than that they attained no degree of per∣fection.</P>
<P>Of the third Edward, says Mr. Vertue<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See an account, in solio, prefixed to his prints of the kings of England.</NOTE>, many portraits are preserved,
at Windsor, in illuminated MSS. and elsewhere. As he has not marked
where these limnings exist, I can give no account of them myself, nor
refer the reader to the inspection of them. But there is a portrait taken
from a bust of the same age, the face of which is far from being ex∣ecuted
in a contemptible manner. It represents that artist and patron
of arts William of Wickham bishop of Winchester, and prime minis∣ter
to Edward III. a prelate whose magnificent charities yet exist, both
in the benefits he calculated for posterity and in the edifices erected on
his own designs for perpetuating those pious bounties The portrait
has been engraven by Houbraken among the heads of illustrious men;
a noble memorial, which I am sorry to say was forced to be dropped
(though exhibited at the trifling expence of five shillings for four
beautiful prints) the moment the novelty of it was exhausted.</P>

The Black Prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Onslow, the late speaker, has a head of the Black Prince, which there is great reason to believe was painted at the time. It is not very ill done: It repre∣sents him in black armour, embossed with gold, and with a golden lion on his breast. He has a hat with a white feather, and a large ruby, exactly in the shape of the rough ruby still in the crown. He appears lean and pale, as he was to∣wards the end of his life. This very curious picture came out of Betchworth∣castle in Surrey.</NOTE> was represented on glass in a window at the west
end of Westminster abbey, but the image is now almost defaced. Mr.
Maurice Johnson, the antiquarian of Spalding, had a MS. of Ralph
Higden's Polychronicon, written in 1340, wherein was an illumination
of the author. It was shown to the Society of Antiquaries in 1735.</P>
<P>The person of Richard II. is still preserved in the most lively man∣ner,
in two different pictures. The first a whole length in the abbey
of Westminster; the other<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See a full description of it in the accounts of the curiosities at Wilton by Gambarini, Cowdry, or Kennedy.</NOTE> at the earl of Pembroke's at Wilton, a
small piece consisting of two tablets, on which are represented the king
kneeling, accompanied by his patron saints, John the Baptist, St. Ed∣mund
the king and Edward the Confessor, before the Virgin and Child,
attended by angels. Hollar engraved it. To the bottom of this picture
are affixed these words, “Invention of painting in oil 1410. This was
painted before in the beginning of Richard II. 1377, &amp;c.” These words,
which are very equivocal, started a question with me, which I found
nobody that could resolve. Do they imply that this piece was painted
in oil before John ab Eyck discovered that secret in 1410? so one
should think, for what news did the inscriber tell, if he only meant that
painting in water-colours or miniature was practiced before painting in
oil? Every illuminated MS. antecedent to that date was a proof of that.
<PB N="27" REF="42"/>
The short quaere would be, With what is the picture in question
painted? To that I can only reply, that it is covered with glass, and
is too great a curiosity to have experiments made upon it. It is painted
on a bright golden ground, the colours of the utmost freshness, and
not grown black as oil-colours would be, and is, as I have said, guarded
by a glass, all which indicate that it is miniature. Yet I do not pretend
to decide: The inscription I have mentioned and some other circum∣stances
seem to leave a doubt whether John ab Eyck was really the first
person who mixed his colours with oil. We have seen by a record re∣ported
above, that long before this period oil was at least used as a var∣nish,
and it is difficult to conceive how it was possible to varnish with
oil either water-colours or colours mixed with size. It occured to me to
enquire with what the painters antecedent to John ab Eyck mixed their
colours: Even in this country there are a few pictures extant, and
painted on board, before oil-painting can be supposed to have been in∣troduced
here. Not to mention the picture at Wilton, the other of
Richard II. at Westminster, and an undoubted original of Henry IV.
at Hampton-court in Herefordshire, who died within two years after
John ab Eyck's discovery, must be allowed to have been drawn before
the new art arrived here. The picture at Westminster has indeed been
repainted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By one Capt. Broom, a print-seller near the parliament house; but this was after Mr. Talman had taken his drawing, from whence the print was engraved.</NOTE>, therefore no conclusion can be drawn from it. This que∣stion,
easy as I thought it, I found had been passed over without con∣sideration,
and though proposed to a very learned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The society of Antiquaries.</NOTE> body of men, ar∣rived
at no solution. After turning over several books of painting,
<PB N="28" REF="43"/>
all treating of John ab Eyck's invention, but without one word of the
method which his secret dispossessed, I at last found what I sought.
Sandrart put an end to the difficulty by these words:</P>
<P>Quia autem metuebant ne muri scissuris diffinderentur, hinc eosdem
linteo, prius glutine mediante, induxerunt, desuperque applicito gypso,
postmodo demum picturas suas effigurarunt, qui modus dici solet <HI>alla
tempera,</HI> id est, temperaturae aquariae. Hanc autem temperaturam ita
praeparabant: effracto prius ovo gallinaceo, in ejusdem liquore fron∣dem
teneram ficulneam de ficu juniore discutiebant: ubi è lacte istius
frondis, eque vitello illa nascebatur temperatura: qua mediante, post∣modum
loco aquae vel gummi, vel tragacanthae, colores suos subige∣bant,
quibus dehinc opera sua perficerent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Academ. pictur. p. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When they painted on walls, lest their work should crack, they pro∣ceeded
in this manner: They glued a linnen cloth upon the wall, and
covered that with plaister, on which they painted in distemper: This
was thus prepared: They dropped into the yolk of an egg the milk
that flows from the leaf of a young fig-tree, with which instead of wa∣ter,
gum, or gumdragant, they mixed their last layer of colours. It is
probable from the last words of this passage that they laid their first co∣lour
with water or gum only.</P>
<P>I shall be told perhaps, that this method was only used for painting
on walls; but, leaving out the plaister, I see nothing to hinder the
same preparation from being used on board. Of what mixture Cima∣bue,
the restorer of the art, made use, we are told by the same author.
Multaeque illius manu confectae non historiae minus, quam imagi∣nes,
in tabulis ligneis, colore ovis vel glutine temperato<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="44"/>
Cimabue used yolk of egg or glue, which I suppose means size.</P>
<P>Still the much more ancient use of oil, were it but as a varnish, leaves
a doubt whether John ab Eyck's discovery was entirely his own. The
remarkable record which I have so often mentioned, dates above an
hundred years before the common aera of painting in oil. John ab
Eyck is allowed to have found it in searching for a varnish. Might he
not have heard that such a varnish or composition was in use in Eng∣land?
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot help hazarding a conjecture (though unsupported by any of the wri∣ters on painting). There is an old altar-table at Chiswick, representing the lord Clifford and his lady kneeling—Van Eyck's name is burnt in on the back of the board. If Van Eyck was ever in England, would it not be probable that he learned the secret of using oil here, and took the honour of the invention to himself, as we were then a country little known to the world of arts, nor at leisure enough, from the confusions of the times, to claim the discovery of a secret which soon made such fortune abroad? An additional presumption, though certainly not a proof of Van Eyck's being in England, is a picture in the duke of Devonshire's collection painted by John ab Eyck in 1422, and representing the consecration of St. Tho∣mas Becket. The tradition is, that it was a present to Henry V. from his uncle the duke of Bedford, regent of France; but tradition is no proof; and two pic∣tures of this author in England, one of them of an English family, and the other of an English story, are at least as good evidence for his having been here, as tra∣dition for one of them being painted abroad. However I pretend to nothing more in all this than meer conjecture.</NOTE> The very pictures I have mentioned as still extant and under
all the appearances of being painted in oil, seem to say even more.
The Painters employed by Henry III. appear to have been Italians, and
yet it is easy to vindicate the secret from them, at least I can prove that
they must have found the practice here, not have brought it over with
them, for we are told expresly that in Italy they knew of no such me∣thod.
<PB N="30" REF="45"/>
When some of John ab Eyck's pictures were carried to Al∣phonso
king of Naples, the Italian painters were surprized, says San∣drart
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 105. Maffei indeed in his Verona Illustrata is of a different opinion, and thinks oil-painting was known in Italy before John ab Eyck.</NOTE>, Quod aquâ purgari possent, coloribus non deletis.</P>
<P>I must beg not to have it supposed that I am setting up any novel
pretensions for the honour of my own country. Where the discovery
was made I do not pretend to guess: the fact seems to be that we had such
a practice. Curious facts are all I aim at relating, never attempting to
establish an hypothesis, which of all kind of visions can nourish itself
the most easily without any. The passion for systems did not introduce
more errors into the old philosophy, than hypothesis has crouded into
history and antiquities. It wrests all arguments to the favorite point.
A man who sees with Saxon eyes sees a Saxon building in every mole-hill:
a Mercian virtuoso can discover king lords and commons in the
tumultuary conventions of the Wittenagemot; and an enthusiast to the
bards find primaeval charms in the rudest ballad that was bawled by
the mob three or four hundred years ago. But the truths we antiqua∣rians
search for, do not seem of importance enough to be supported by
fictions: the world in general thinks our studies of little consequence;
they do not grow more valuable by being stuffed with guesses and in∣vention.</P>
<P>The painters of these portraits<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Another representation of this king is exhibited by Montfaucon from a MS. Froisard in the library of the king of France. There is another illuminated edi∣tion of that author in the British Museum, in which is a miniature of the young monarch sitting on his throne and attended by his uncles. In the same place is an historic poem in old French, written by a person of condition in the service of Richard II. and an eye-witness of all that he relates. It has sixteen curious illumi∣nations, in which that king is eight times represented in different situations. There are also the portraits of Henry of Lancaster (four times) of Archbishop Arundel, the dukes of Surrey and of Exeter, the earls of Northumberland, Salis∣bury, &amp;c.

See Dugdale's Warwickshire p. 402, 431.

where the science flourished more, our knowledge of the professors is
very imperfect. Though Cimabue restored the art as early as 1250,
yet the number of his successors on record is extremely small, 'till An∣tonello
of Messina carried the secret of painting in oil into Italy: and
for Flanders, where it was invented, the biographers of the masters of
that country, as Carl Vermander, Sandrart, &amp;c. professedly begin their
lists with John ab Eyck. We must leave therefore in the dark what
we find irrecoverably so.</P>
<P>Two of the artists employed on the tomb of Richard are recorded

receiving the book from Frater Johannes Sifernas, who was probably
the illuminator. It is now in the British Museum.</P>

for his own work four shillings a week, and to finish the whole in less
than three years. The indenture, still preserved, adds, that he was to
receive an hundred shillings sterling, each of the three years; and if
he executed his work truly and perfectly, he was to have ten pounds
more. Another indenture of 1338, for glazing some of the west win∣dows,

<P>The painted effigies of Chaucer remained 'till within these few years
on his tomb at Westminster; and another, says Vertue on his print of
that poet, is preserved in an illuminated MS. of Thomas Occleve,
painted by Occleve himself. D'Urry and Tanner both mention such
a portrait, which places Occleve in the rank of one of our first paint∣ers
as well as poets<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I find by Montfaucon that the use of crayons was known in this age in France; but nothing of that kind appears to have been practiced in this country.

<P>Henry V. is likewise on board at Kensington, and on vellum in some
MSS. as Vertue says in his account prefixed to the heads of our kings,
but he does not mention where those MSS. are preserved. But a most
curious picture of this king and his family is still extant in the collec∣tion
of James West, es{que} secretary of the treasury. This piece is evi∣dently
painted in oil-colours, and though the new art might have reach∣ed
England before the death of that prince, which happened in 1422,
yet there are many circumstances that lead me to think it of a later
date. It was an altar-piece at Shene, and in all probability was painted
by order of Henry VII. for the chapel in his palace there. His fondness
for the house of Lancaster is too well known to be dwelt on: the small
resemblance of the portrait of Henry V. to genuine pictures of him,
and the great resemblance of all the other personages to one another,

make it evident that it was rather a work of command and imagination
than of authenticity. Add to this that on the tents (which I shall men∣tion

that time, is a mark of virginity. It has been supposed that the two
elder were the wives of the dukes of Clarence and Bedford, and the two
younger their sisters; but this clashes with all history and chronology.
Blanche and Philippa were both married early in their father's reign:
and to suppose the two younger ladies the brides of Clarence and Bed∣ford
would be groundless, for Margaret Holland the wife of the form∣er
was a widow when he married her. As all the portraits are imagi∣nary,
it does not much signify for whom the painter intended them. A
larger angel standing, holds the cloth of the two tents together. On
a rising ground above the tents is St. George on a brown steed striking
with his sword at the dragon, which is flying in the air, and already
pierced through the forehead with a spear, on which is a flag with the
cross of St. George. Cleodelinde, with a lamb, is praying beneath
the dragon. On the hills are gothic buildings and castles in a pretty
taste.</P>

<P>Of that indiscreet but amiable and unfortunate prince Humphrey
duke of Glocester, I know no memorial; nor will I mention him but
to make one remark, sufficient alone to detect the malice of his enemies,

of a man illustrious for exposing impostors, who encouraged learning,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He had a valuable library for that time, and gave 129 volumes to the univer∣sity. Hearne.</NOTE>
and founded the Divinity-school at Oxford, should have dared under
his roof to dabble with witches and necromancers? His first wife Ja∣queline,
the amorous Countess of Holland, is known by more than one
monument. Two fine prints of her, and her last husband, were pub∣lished
in 1753 by Folkema, from pictures painted by Mostert at Har∣lem.
William Bridges, the first Garter King at Arms, instituted by
Henry V. set up in the windows of the church of St. George at Stan∣ford

<P>In the reign of Henry VI. our field begins to grow less barren.
Many portraits of the king himself are preserved, as on board at Ken∣sington
and on glass in the chapel of King's college. In my possession
is a remarkable piece, which so many circumstances affix to the history
of this prince that I cannot hesitate to believe it designed for him,
though I imagine it was painted after his death. It is the representa∣tion
of his marriage. There are eleven figures, of which all the heads
are well painted: the draperies are hard and stiff. The king in rich

<PB N="37" REF="54"/>
robes, but with rude dishevelled hair, as are all the men, stands before
the portal of a magnificent church, giving his hand to the queen, who
is far from being a lovely bride, and whom the painter seems satiri∣cally
to have insinuated by the prominence of her waist not to have
been so perfect a virgin as her flowing hair denotes. Kemp arch∣bishop
of York and afterwards of Canterbury, and one of her chief
counsellors, is performing the marriage rites by holding the pallium
over their conjoined hands. It is remarkable that the prelate wears
thin yellow gloves which are well represented. Behind the king in a
robe of state stands the duke of Glocester, and seems reproving a no∣bleman,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He has a hawk on his fist, a mark of nobility in old paintings.</NOTE> whom I take for the marquis of Suffolk. Behind the
queen is a lady in a kind of turban or diadem, probably designed for
her mother the titular queen of Naples and Jerusalem. Beyond her,
another in a widow's dress, opposite to whom is a comely gentleman.
This pair I conclude is Jaqueline, duchess of Bedford, widow of duke
John, and her second husband. Our historian says that pretty sudden∣ly
after the duke's death, she married Sir Richard Widville, a goodly
young knight. They were the parents of Elizabeth, queen of Edward IV.</P>
<P>On the fore ground opposite to the marquiss of Suffolk stands a
noble virgin, whom I take for Margaret of Richmond, mother of
Henry VII. one of the charges against the marquis of Suffolk was,
that he endeavoured to marry his son to this lady Margaret, a princess
of the blood. Near the archbishop is a cardinal, who is certainly
Winchester, the king's great uncle. The face is very like the image
on his tomb at Winchester; nor can one account for his not perform∣ing
the ceremony, but by his dignity of prince of the blood, which
did not suffer by the ministration of an inferior prelate. Behind the
<PB N="38" REF="55"/>
queen of Naples is an abbess, and at a distance a view of a town, that
must be Tichfield, from whence the queen was led to be married at
Southwick. Besides the seeming pregnancy of the queen, there is
another circumstance, conclusive for this picture being painted after
the death of Henry. Round his head is the nimbus or glory: an ad∣dition
that was as posterior to his marriage, as the painter seems to in∣timate
the queen's fruitfullness was anterior to it. Round the hem of
the queen's robe are some letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a fashion as early as the reign of Richard II. when Edward Earl of Rutland, the Lord Spencer and others accused the Earl of Arundel of treason, they appeared before the king at Nottingham in red gowns of silk, garded and bordered <HI>with white silk and embroidered with letters of gold.</HI> Peck's Annals of Stanford 12, 39.

as the other incidents. The words are involved in the folds;
what appear, are Vol salv Regin m—one knows that Salve Regina
mater coelorum is the beginning of a hymn—but I know not what
to make of Vol.—the painter probably was no Latinist—and in∣deed
the first letter of Regina, he has drawn more like to a <HI>B</HI> than an

as her majesty's Vol.</P>
<P>But it is to Sir William Dugdale that I am indebted for the greatest
discoveries I have made towards the history of our ancient artists. In
that collection of various treasures which he has saved from oblivion
[saved the more luckily, as he wrote but the instant before it became
piety to commit devastation] He has incidentally preserved some me∣morials
of the state of painting in the reigns of our earliest princes. I
have found some names of the professors, and even the rates of their
<PB N="39" REF="56"/>
work. I call them professors, agreably to modern estimation, but our
ancestors seem to have treated them without any distinction from other
mecanics. If Henry III. bespoke pictures by the intervention of the
sheriff, under Henry VI. we were still so unpolished, that a peer of the
first nobility going into France on an embassy, contracted with his
taylor for the painter's work that was to be displayed in the pageantry
of his journey. The bill itself is so curious that I shall transcribe part
of it.</P>

If it is objected to me, that This was meer herald's painting, I an∣swer,
That was almost the only painting we had. The art was en∣grossed
by and confined to the vanity or devotion of the nobility. The
arms they bore and quartered, their missals, their church-windows and
the images of their idols were the only circumstances in which they had
any employment for a painter. Even portraits, the object of modern
vanity, seem not to have been in fashion. I know not one except of
the blood royal or of a bishop or two, painted during the period of
which I am writing. Devout subjects were held in sufficient estimation.
Isabel countess of Warwick in 1439, bequeathed her tablet with the
image of our lady to the church of Walsingham, and it is even men∣tioned
that this tablet had a glass over it. I cannot pass over this
magnificent lady without taking a little notice of some other particu∣lars
of her will. She was daughter and at length sole heiress of Tho∣mas
le Despenser earl of Glocester, widow of Richard Beauchamp earl
of Worcester, and afterwards by dispensation married to his cousin that
potent and warlike peer, Richard Beauchamp earl of Warwick. Their
portraits on glass with others of their lineage were long extant in the
church at Warwick. Her great templys<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jewels hanging on the foreheads of ladies by bodkins thrust into their hair. See Dugdale's Warwickshire, p. 413.</NOTE> with the baleys sold to the
utmost, she gave to the monks of Tewksbury, so that they grucht not
with her burial there, and what else she had appointed to be done a∣bout
the same. To our lady of Walsingham, her gown of green alyz
cloth of gold with wide sleeves, and a tabernacle of silver like in the
timbre to that over our lady of Caversham, and ordered that her great
image of wax, then at London, should be offered to our lady of Wor∣cester.
<PB N="41" REF="58"/>
To the abbey of Tewksbury she gave her wedding gown, and
all her cloaths of gold and cloaths of silk without furs, saving one of
russet velvet which she bestowed on St. Winifrede. But having thus
disposed of her wardrobe for the use of the saints, she seems to have
had very different thoughts about her self, ordering that “a statue of
her should be made all nakyd with her hair cast backward, according
to the design and model that one Thomas Porchalion had for that
purpose.” This extreme prohibition of all covering, I suppose,
flowed from some principle of humility in this good lady, who having
divested herself of all vain ornaments in favour of our lady and St.
Winifrede, would not indulge her own person even in the covering of
the hair of her head. And it looks, by the legacy to the monks above,
as if she had some apprehensions that they would not relish or compre∣hend
the delicacy of such total rejection of all superfluities. I was will∣ing
to mention this testament too, because it seems to record even the
name of an ancient statuary. Other statuaries and founders are men∣tioned
in the cost bestowed on the tomb of the earl her husband.
Dugdale has preserved the covenant between the executors and the
artists. There I find John Essex, marbler, William Austin, founder,
Thomas Stevens, copper-smyth, John Bourde of Corffe castle, marbler,
Bartholomew Lambspring a Dutch gold-smith; they agree on all the
particulars for the image on the tomb, and the little images and es∣cutcheons
round it. The tomb with the image still extant in po∣lished
brass of the highest preservation witnesses that the artists were ex∣cellent
enough to deserve this memorial. John Prudde of Westmin∣ster,
called simply, glazier, appears to have painted the windows of
the chapel; and it was particularly stipulated that “he should employ
<PB N="42" REF="59"/>
no glass of England, but with glass beyond the seas, and that in the
finest wise, with the best, cleanest, and strongest glasse of beyond sea
that may be had in England, and of the finest colours of blew, yellow,
red, purpure, sanguine and violet, and of all other colours that shall be
most necessary and best to make rich and embellish the matters, images
and stories that shall be delivered and appointed by the said executors
by patterns in paper, afterwards to be newly traced and pictured by
another painter in rich colour at the charges of the said glazier.” By
all these circumstances it is plain that the executors thought that the
magnificence of the intended monument must consist in the value and
show of the materials, rather than in any excellence of the workman∣ship.
This covenant carries us still farther, and has even brought to
light a history-painter of that time. <HI>John Brentwood</HI> citizen and steyn∣er
of London engages “to paint on the west wall of the chapel the
dome of our Lord Jesus and all manner of devises and imagery there∣unto
belonging, of fair and sightly proportion, as the place shall serve
for, with the finest colours and fine gold;” and <HI>Kristian Coleburne,</HI>
another painter dwelling in London, undertakes to paint “in most
fine, fairest and curious wise four images of stone, of our lady, St.
Gabraell the angel, St. Anne and St. George; these four to be paint∣ed
with the finest oil colours, in the richest, finest and freshest clothings
that may be made of fine gold, azure, of fine purpure, of fine white,
and other finest colours necessary, garnished, bordered and poudered in
the finest and curiousest wise.”</P>
<P>This singular record contains too the prices stipulated for the seve∣ral
performances. The tomb was to cost 125<HI>l.</HI> sterling; the image
40<HI>l.</HI> the gilding of the image and its appurtenances, 13<HI>l.</HI> The glass-painter

and the painting of the four images 12<HI>l.</HI> The whole expence of the
chapel and monument, which were not compleated under one and
twenty years, amounted to 2481<HI>l. 3s. 7d.</HI></P>
<P>The wealth and splendor of that family was so great, that Henry
Beauchamp, son of Richard and Isabel, was at the age of nineteen
created premier earl of England, and three days after he was made
duke of Warwick, with precedence next to the duke of Norfolk and
before the duke of Buckingham—an act of power so destructive of all
the vanity of nobility and blood, that the duke of Buckingham could
not digest it: It occasioned such animosity, that the king was obliged
to qualify his grant, by establishing between the contending parties a
rotation of seniority, each to take place alternately for a year, the sur∣vivor
to precede for his life the heir of the other, and so in perpetuum.
A senseless jumble, soon liquidated by a more egregious act of folly,
the king with his own hand crowning the young duke of Warwick
king of the isle of Wight—nor can one easily conceive a more ridicu∣lous
circumstance, than a man who had lost the kingdom of France
amusing himself with bestowing the diadem of the little isle of Wight—but
to return to our artists—I find the name of another sculptor at the
same aera; not employed indeed in any considerable work, and called
only Richard the carver; he and one brother Rowsby a monk were en∣gaged
on some repairs in the church of St. Mary at Stanford.</P>
<P>But t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e most valuable artists of that age were the illuminators of
manuscripts. Their drawing was undoubtedly stiff, but many of the or∣naments

taste, and finished highly. To several missals were added portraits of
the princes and princesses to whom they belonged, or for whom they
were designed as presents. The dresses and buildings of the times are
preserved, though by frequent anachronisms applied to the ages of
scripture; and the gold and colours are of the greatest brightness and
beauty. Several receipts for laying these on are still extant, particularly
in the British Museum.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Catal. Harl. MSS. No. 273. art. 34. where is also a receipt for painting on glass. In that collection is a MS. in which Henry VI. is represented looking out of a window in the tower. In Dufresne's Greek glossary are three receipts for illuminating under the article <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. There are two others in Montfau∣con's Palaeographia Graeca.</NOTE> Dugdale from some of these illuminations
has given cuts of two remarkable combats or tournaments performed
in the 15th year of king Henry VI.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Warwickshire, p. 110.</NOTE> in which the designs are far from
unworthy of a better age; and the customs and habits delineated with
great accuracy.</P>
<P>Henry himself, I suppose, had no taste for the arts—the turbulent
ambition of his queen left her as little—yet she was the daughter of a
prince, who was not only reckoned the best painter of his age, but who
would really appear no mean performer in the present: This was Renè
of Anjou, king of the two Sicilies, duke of Lorrain and count of
Provence, much known from having lost almost all his dominions;
yet it has been little remarked that he was one of the very few princes
who did not deserve to lose them, having merited from his subjects
the title of THE GOOD. His own picture painted by himself is still ex∣tant
in the chapel of the Carmelites at Aix, and the print from it in
<PB N="45" REF="62"/>
Montfaucon's Antiquities of France will justify what I have said of
this prince's talent.</P>
<P>In this age was finished the cloyster adjoining to the old church of
St. Paul: It was built round a chapel in Pardon-church Hawgh, a
place situated on the north side of the church, where Thomas More
dean of St. Paul's in the reign of Henry V. restored an ancient chapel,
but dying before he had accomplished it, it was finished by his execu∣tors,
by license from Henry VI. On the walls of this cloyster was
painted, at the charge of Jenkyn Carpenter, a citizen of London, the
Dance of Death, in imitation of that in the cloyster adjoining to St. In∣nocent's
church-yard at Paris. Underneath were English verses (to
explain the paintings) translated from the French, by John Lidgate
the famous poetic monk of Bury. Dugdale has preserved the lines,
and Holbein by borrowing the thought, ennobled the pictures.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dugdale's St. Paul's, p. 134, and Stowe, 354.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this reign John de Whethamsted abbot of St. Albans, a man of
great learning and merit, adorned the chapel of our lady there with va∣rious
paintings, as he did the sides of the church and his own lodg∣ings,
under all which paintings he caused mottos and inscriptions to
be placed. At his manor of Tittenhanger he had pictures in the church
of all the saints of his own name.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chauncy, 445.</NOTE></P>
<P>I shall close my notes on the state of painting under Henry VI. with
observing that the portraits on glass in the windows of the college of
All Souls at Oxford, were painted in his reign.</P>

<P>WHETHER it was owing to the confusions of his reign, or to

Museum at Oxford, conveys no idea of her loveliness nor of any
skill in the painter. Almost as few charms can be discovered in his

favorite Jane Shore, preserved at Eton, and probably an original, as
her confessor was provost of that college, and by her intercession reco∣vered
their lands, of which they had been despoiled, as having owed
their foundation to Edward's competitor. In this picture her fore∣head
is remarkably large, her mouth and the rest of her features small;
her hair of the admired golden colour:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This picture answers to a much larger mentioned by Sir Thomas More; who, speaking of her, says, “her stature was mean; her hair of a dark yellow, her face round and full, her eyes grey; delicate harmony being betwixt each part's proportions, and each proportion's colour; her body fat, white and smooth; her countenance chearfull, and like to her condition; the picture which I have seen of her was such as she rose out of her bed in the morning, having nothing on but a rich mantle, cast under one arm and over her shoulder, and sitting in a chair, on which one arm did lie.” The picture at Eton is not so large, and seems to have been drawn earlier than that Sir Thomas saw; it has not so much as the rich mantle over one shoulder. There is another portrait of Jane Shore to be∣low the breasts, in the provost's lodge at King's college, Cambridge; the body quite naked, the hair dressed with jewels, and a necklace of massive gold. It is
painted on board, and from the meaness of the execution seems to be original.</NOTE> A lock of it (if we may be∣lieve
tradition) is still extant in the collection of the countess of Car∣digan,
and is marvelously beautiful, seeming to be poudered with
golden dust without prejudice to it's silken delicacy. The king him∣self,
with his queen, eldest son and others of his court, are represented
in a MS. in the library at Lambeth, from which an engraving was
made, with an account of it, and prefixed to the Catalogue of Royal
and noble Authors. It was purchased of Peacham by Sir Robert
Cotton. Richard III. the successor of these princes, appears in ano∣ther
old picture at Kensington. In the princess dowager's house at

him with the thought that it would not be paid for 'till after his

arose in that reign. The only names of painters that Vertue
could recover of that period were both foreigners, and of one of them
the account is indeed exceedingly slight; mention being barely made
in the register's office of Wells, that one Holbein lived and died here in

Kensington, drawn before the great master of that name could have

Vertue engraved his print. The other painter had merit enough to
deserve a particular article; He was called

defects of his cotemporary countrymen, stiffness in his manner, and
drunkenness. Yet his industry was sufficient to carry him to great

He was a friend rather than a rival of Lucas<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lucas made an entertainment for Mabuse and other artists that cost him sixty florins of gold.</NOTE> of Leyden. After some
practice at home he travelled into Italy, where he acquired more truth

in treating naked subjects than freedom of expression. Indeed Raphael
himself had not then struck out that majestic freedom, which has since
animated painting, and delivered it from the servility of coldly copy∣ing
motionless nature. Mabuse so far improved his taste, as to intro∣duce
among his countrymen poetic history, for so I should understand
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 234.</NOTE> Sandrart's varia poemata conficiendi, if it is meant as a mark of real
taste, rather than what a later<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Descamps, Vies des Peintres Flamands, p. 83.</NOTE> author ascribes to Mabuse, that he first
treated historic subjects allegorically. I never could conceive that rid∣dles
and rebus's (and I look upon such emblems as little better) are
any improvements upon history. Allegoric personages are a poor de∣composition
of human nature, whence a single quality is separated and
erected into a kind of half deity, and then to be rendered intelligible,
is forced to have it's name written by the accompanyment of symbols.
You must be a natural philosopher before you can decypher the voca∣tion
of one of these simplified divinities. Their dog, or their bird, or
their goat, or their implement, or the colour of their cloaths, must all
be expounded, before you know who the person is to whom they be∣long,
and for what virtue the hero is to be celebrated, who has all this
hieroglyphic cattle around him. How much more genius is there in
expressing the passions of the soul in the lineaments of the countenance!
Would Messalina's character be more ingeniously drawn in the warmth
of her glances, or by ransacking a farm-yard for every animal of a con∣genial
constitution?</P>
<P>A much admired work of Mabuse was an altar-piece at Middle∣burgh,
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Painted for the abbot Maximilian of Burgundy who died 1524.</NOTE> a descent from the cross: Albert Durer went on purpose to
<PB N="52" REF="70"/>
see and praised it. Indeed their style was very like: A picture of Ma∣buse
now at St. James's is generally called Albert's. The piece at
Middleburgh was destroyed by lightning. A great number of Ma∣buse's
works were preserved in the same city in the time of Carl Ver∣mander.
M. Magnus at Delft had another descent from the cross by
this master. The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mint-master of Zeland.</NOTE> Sieur Wyntgis at Amsterdam had a Lucretia by
him. But one of his most striking performances was the decollation of
St. John, painted in the shades of a single colour.</P>
<P>The Marquis de Veren took him into his own house, where he drew
the Virgin and Child, borrowing the ideas of their heads from the Ma∣quis's
lady and son. This was reckoned his capital piece. It afterwards
passed into the cabinet of M. Frosmont.</P>
<P>While he was in this service, the Emperor Charles V. was to lodge
at the house of that lord, who made magnificent preparations for his re∣ception,
and among other expences ordered all his houshold to be
dressed in white damask. Mabuse, always wanting money to waste in
debauchery, when the tailor came to take his measure, desired to have
the damask, under pretence of inventing a singular habit. He sold the
stuff, drunk out the money, and then painted a suit of paper, so like
damask, that it was not distinguished, as he marched in the procession,
between a philosopher and a poet, other pensioners of the Marquis,
who being informed of the trick, asked the Emperor which of the three
suits he liked best: The Prince pointed to Mabuse's, as excelling in the
whiteness and beauty of the flowers; nor did he 'till convinced by the
touch, doubt of the genuineness of the silk. The Emperor laughed
much—but, though a lover of the art, seems to have taken no other
<PB N="53" REF="71"/>
notice of Mabuse; whose excesses some time after occasioned his being
flung into prison at Middleburgh, where however he continued to work.
Vermander had seen several good drawings by him in black chalk.</P>
<P>At what time Mabuse came to England I do not find; Vermander
says expresly that he was here, and the portraits drawn by him are a
confirmation. The picture of Prince Arthur, Prince Henry and Prin∣cess
Margaret, when children, now in the china-closet at Windsor, was
done by him. A neat little copy of, or rather his original design for it,
in black and white oil-colours is at the Duke of Leeds's at Kiveton.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is another of these in small in queen's Caroline's closet at Kensington, another, very good, at Wilton, and another in Mr. Methuen's collection. One of these pictures, I do not know which of them, was sold out of the royal collec∣tion, during the civil war, for ten pounds. The picture that was at Kiveton is now in London, and is not entirely black and white, but the carnations are pale, and all the shadows tinged with pure black: but that was the manner of painting at the time; blues, reds, greens and yellows not being blended in the gradations.</NOTE>
Sandrart speaks of the pictures of two noble youths drawn by him at
Whitehall. Over one of the doors in the King's anti-chamber at St.
James's is his picture of Adam and Eve, which formerly hung in the
gallery at Whitehall, thence called the Adam and Eve gallery.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Evelyn in the preface to his idea of the perfection of painting, mentions this picture, painted, as he calls him, by Malvagius, and objects to the absurdity of re∣presenting Adam and Eve with navels, and a fountain with carved imagery in Pa∣radise—the latter remark is just; the former is only worthy of a critical manmid∣wise.</NOTE> Mar∣tin
Papenbroech, formerly a famous collector in Holland, had another of
them. It was brought over as a picture of Raphael in his first manner,
in the time of Vertue, who by the exact describtion of it in Vermander
discovered it to be of Mabuse. It was sold however for a considerable
<PB N="54" REF="72" MS="y"/>
price.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is now at the Grange in Hampshire, the seat of the lord chancellor Henley.</NOTE> In a MS. catalogue of the collection of King Charles I. taken

Sir Peter Lely had the story of Hercules and Deianira by him.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See catalogue of his collection, p. 48. No. 99.</NOTE>
The only work besides that I know of this master in England, is a ce∣lebrated
picture in my possession. It was bought for 200<HI>l.</HI> by Henri∣etta
Louisa Countess of Pomfret, and hung for some years at their
seat at Easton Neston in Northamptonshire, whence it was sold after the
late earl's death. The earl of Oxford once offered 500<HI>l.</HI> for it.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I gave eighty-four pounds.</NOTE> It is
painted on board and is four feet six inches and three quarters wide
by three feet six inches and three quarters high. It represents the inside
of a church, an imaginary one, not at all resembling the abbey where
those princes were married. The perspective and the landscape of the
country on each side are good. On one hand on the fore ground
stand the king and the bishop of Imola who pronounced the nuptial
benediction. His majesty<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">He is extremely like his profile on a shilling.</NOTE> is a trist, lean, ungracious figure, with a
down-cast look, very expressive of his mean temper, and of the little sa∣tisfaction
he had in the match.

an emblematic personage, and designed from its lofty stature to give an
idea of something above human. It is an elderly man,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This allegoric figure seems to agree with the account of Descamps mentioned above, and Mabuse might have learned in Italy that the Romans always represent∣ed their divine personages larger than the human, as is evident from every model whereon are a Genius and an Emperor.</NOTE> dressed like a
monk, except that his habit is green; his feet bare, and a spear in his
hand. As the frock of no religious order ever was green, this cannot
be meant for a friar. Probably it is St. Thomas, represented, as in the
martyrologies, with the instrument of his death. The queen might
have some devotion to that peculiar saint, or might be born or mar∣ried
on his festival. Be that as it may, the picture, though in a hard
manner, has it's merit, independent of the curiosity.</P>
<P>John Schorel studied some time under Mabuse, but quitted him on
account of his irregularities, by which Schorel was once in danger of
his life. Paul Van Aelst excelled in copying Mabuse's works, and
John Mostart assisted the latter in his works at Middleburgh.</P>
<P>In the library of St. John's college Cambridge is an original of their
foundress Margaret of Richmond, the king's mother, much damaged,
and the painter not known. Mr. West has a curious missal (the painter
unknown) which belonged to Margaret queen of Scotland, and was a
present from her father Henry VII. His name of his own writing is in
the first page. The queen's portrait praying to St. Margaret, appears
twice in the illuminations, and beneath several of them are the arms
and matches of the house of Somerset, besides representations of the
twelve months, well painted.</P>
<P>In this reign died John Rous, the antiquarian of Warwickshire, who
drew his own portrait and other semblances, but in too rude a manner

<P>1509. THE accession of this sumptuous prince brought along with it
the establishment of the arts. He was opulent, grand and li∣beral—how
many invitations to artists! A man of taste en∣courages
abilities; a man of expence, any performers; but when a
king is magnificent, whether he has taste or not, the influence is so ex∣tensive,
and the example so catching, that even merit has a chance of
getting bread. Though Henry had no genius to strike out the im∣provements
of latter ages, he had parts enough to chuse the best of
what the then world exhibited to his option. He was galant as
far as the rusticity of his country and the boisterous indelicacy of his
own complexion would admit. His tournaments contracted, in imi∣tation
of the French, a kind of romantic politeness. In one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a description and exhibition of this tournament among the prints pub∣lished by the Society of Antiquaries, vol. i.</NOTE> which he
held on the birth of his first child, he styled himself <HI>Coeur Loyal.</HI> In
his interview with Francis I. in the vale of Cloth of Gold, he revived
<PB N="57" REF="76"/>
the pageantry of the days of Amadis. He and his favorite Charles
Brandon were the prototypes of those illustrious heroes, with which
Mademoiselle Scuderi has enriched the world of chivalry. The Favo∣rite's
motto on his marriage with the monarch's sister retained that mo∣ral
simplicity, now totally exploded by the academy of sentiments;</P>

<L>Tho' thou be matched with cloth of gold.</L></Q>
<P>Francis the first was the standard which these princely champions co∣pied.
While he contended with Charles V. for empire, he rivalled our
Henry in pomp and protection of the arts. Francis handelled the pen∣cil
himself; I do not find that Henry pushed his imitation so far; but
though at last He wofully unravelled most of the pursuits of his early
age, (for at least it was great violation of galantry to cut off the heads
of the fair damsels whose true knight he had been, and there is no for∣giving
him that destruction of ancient monuments and gothic piles and
painted glass by the suppression of monasteries; a reformation, as he
called it, which we antiquarians almost devoutly lament) yet he had
countenanced the arts so long, and they acquired such solid foundation
here, that they were scarce eradicated by that second storm which broke
upon them during the civil war,—an aera we antiquarians lament
with no less devotion than the former.</P>
<P>Henry had several painters in his service, and, as Francis invited
Primaticcio and other masters from Italy, he endeavoured to tempt
hither Raphael<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Raphael did paint a St. George for him, which has since been in Monsr. Cro∣zat's collection. See Recueil des plus beaux tableaux qui sont on France, p. 13.</NOTE> and Titian. Some performers he did get from that

was both his painter and engineer, and attending him in the latter qua∣lity
to the siege of Boulogne, was killed at the age of thirty-six. Joan∣nes
Corvus was a Fleming. Vertue discovered his name on the anci∣ent
picture of Fox bishop of Winchester, still preserved at Oxford. It
was painted in the beginning of the reign of this king, after the prelate
had lost his sight. The painter's name <HI>Johannes Corvus Flandrus fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iebat</HI>

coloured in imitation of red marble with veins of green.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There are two or three pictures of the same prelate in the college, but this is probably the original; is flat and a poor performance.</NOTE></P>
<P>Others of Henry's painters are recorded in an office-book<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It was in the collection of Mrs. Bridgman of Hanover-square.</NOTE> signed
monthly by the king himself, and containing payments of wages, pre∣sents,

of Ridolphi, fils de Dominique Ghirlandaio, he says, “Chez luy il

<P>But Toto's works are all lost or unknown, his fame with that of his
associates being obscured by the lustre of Holbein.</P>
<P>Penne or Penn, mentioned above, is called by Vasari, not Barthole∣mew,
but Luca Penni; he was brother of Gio. Francesco Penni, a
favorite and imitator of Raphael. Luca, or Bartholomew (for it is un∣doubtedly
the same person) worked some time at Genoa and in other
parts of Italy, from whence he came into England, and painted seve∣ral
pieces for the king, and for some merchants here<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vasari adds, that Luca Penni addicted himself latterly to making designs for Flemish engravers. This is the mark on his prints, #, that is, Luca Penni Romano.</NOTE>. In a small room

passion. He and Sir James Thornhill agreed that they were much in
the style of Raphael, particularly the small figures and landscapes in the
perspective, and not at all in the German taste. These Vertue conclu∣ded
to be of Luca Penni.</P>
<P>To some of these painters Vertue ascribes, with great probability,
the battle of the spurs, the triumphs of the valley of cloth of gold,
and the expedition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not very surprizing, that a prince of seemingly so martial a disposition should make so little figure in the roll of conquerors, when we observe by this pic∣ture that the magnificence of his armament engaged so much of his attention.

but painted (at least two of them) if painted as in all likely∣hood
they were on the several occasions, before the arrival of that
great master in England.</P>
<P>Of another painter mentioned in the payments above, we know still
less than of Toto. He is there called Gerard Luke Horneband. Ver∣mander
and Descamps call him Gerard Horrebout, and both mention
him as painter to Henry VIII. He was of Ghent, where were his prin∣cipal
works, but none are known in England as his.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Susanna, the sister of Luke Horneband, painter in miniature, was invited, says Vasari, into the service of Henry VIII▪ and lived honorably in England to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of her life.</NOTE> In the same
book of payments are mentioned two other painters, Andrew Oret,
and one Ambrose, painter to the queen of Navarre. The former in∣deed
was of no great rank, receiving 30<HI>l.</HI> for painting and covering
the king's barge; the latter had 20 crowns for bringing a picture to
the king's grace at Eltham.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="82"/>
Henry had another serjeant-painter, whose name was Andrew
Wright; he lived in Southwark and had a grant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From a MS. in the possession of the late Peter Leneve Norroy. In the British Museum, among the Harleian MSS. is a grant of arms and crest to the Crast of Painters dated in the first year of Henry VIII.</NOTE> of arms from Sir
Thomas Wriothesly, Garter. His motto was, En Vertu Delice; but
he never attained any renown; indeed this was in the beginning of
Henry's reign before the art itself was upon any respectable footing:
they had not arrived even at the common terms for it's productions.
In the inventory in the augmentation-office which I have mentioned,
containing an account of goods, pictures and furniture in the palace of
Westminster, under the care of Sir Anthony Denny keeper of the
wardrobe, it appears that they called a picture, <HI>a table with a picture;</HI>
prints, <HI>cloths stained with a picture;</HI> and models and basreliefs, they
termed <HI>pictures of earth;</HI> for instance,</P>
<P>Item, One table with the picture of the duchess of Milan, being
her whole stature.</P>
<P>Item, One table with the history of Filius Prodigus.</P>
<P>Item, one folding table of the passion, set in gilt leather.</P>
<P>Item, One table like a book with the pictures of the king's ma∣jesty

<P>Item, One other table with the whole stature of my lord prince his

<P>Item, One table of the history of Christiana Patientia.</P>
<P>Item, One table of the passion, of cloth of gold, adorned with pearls

<P>Item, One table of russet and black, of the parable of the 18th
chapter of Matthew, raised with liquid gold and silver.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="83" MS="y"/>
Item, One table of the king's highness, standing upon a mitre with
three crowns, having a serpent with seven heads going out of it, and
having a sword in his hand, whereon is written, Verbum Dei.</P>
<P>Item, One cloth stained with Phebus rideing with his cart in the air,
with the history of him.</P>
<P>Item, One picture of Moses made of earth, and set in a box of
wood.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In an old chapter-house at Christ church Oxford I discovered two portraits, admirably painted and in the most perfect preservation, which certalnly belonged to Henry VIII. the one an elderly, the other, a young man, both in black bon∣nets, and large as life. On the back of the one is this mark, No. # 22; on the other, No. # 25. In the catalogue of King Henry's pictures in the aug∣mentation office, No. 25. is Frederic Duke of Saxony, No. 26. is Philip Archduke of Austria; in all probability these very pictures. They have a great deal of the manner of Holbein, certainly not inferior to it, but are rather more free and bold. Frederic, the wise, Duke of Saxony, died in 1525, about a year before Holbein came to England, but the Arch duke Philip died when Holbein was not above eight years of age: Holbein might have drawn this Prince from another picture, as a small one of him when a boy, in my possession, has all the appearance of Hol∣bein's hand. Whoever painted the pictures at Oxford, they are two capital por∣traits.</NOTE></P>
<P>Another serjeant-painter in this reign was John Brown,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His arms were, argent, on a fess counter-embatteled, sable, three escallops of the first; on a canton, quarterly gules and azure, a leopard's head caboshed, or.</NOTE> who if he

by persons of the society. Their first charter in which they are styled
Peyntours, was granted in the 6th of Edward IV. but they had existed
as a fraternity long before. Holme Clarenceux, in the 1st of Henry
VII. granted them arms, viz. azure, a chevron, or, between three
heads of phoenixes erased. They were again incorporated or con∣firmed
by charter of the 23d of queen Elizabeth, 1581, by the title of
Painter-stainers.</P>
<P>In this reign flourished
<Q>LUCAS CORNELII.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sandrart, p. 232.</NOTE></Q>
Who was both son and scholar of Cornelius Engelbert, but reduced to

came to England with his wife and seven or eight children, and was
made his majesty's painter. Some of his works in both kinds are still
preserved at Leyden; one particularly, the story of the woman taken
in adultery. His chief performances extant in England are at Pens∣hurst,
as appears by this mark on one of them #, that is, Lucas Cor∣nelii
pinxit. They are a series, in<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">One of them, I have heard, was given by Mr. Perry, the last master of Pens∣hurst, to Mr. Velters Cornwall. It was the portrait of his ancestor Sir John Cornwall.</NOTE> sixteen pieces, of the constables of
<PB N="64" REF="85"/>
Queenborough castle from the reign of Edward III. to Sir Thomas
Cheyne knight of the garter in the 3d of Henry VIII. Though not
all originals, they undoubtedly are very valuable, being in all proba∣bility
painted from the best memorials then extant; and some of them,
representations of remarkable persons, of whom no other image remains.
Of these, the greatest curiosities are, Robert de Vere, the great duke of
Ireland, and George, the unfortunate duke of Clarence. Harris, in
his history of Kent,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 377.</NOTE> quotes an itinerary by one Johnston, who says,
that in 1629, he saw at the house of the minister of Gillingham, the
portrait of Sir Edward Hobby, the last governor but one, who had
carefully assembled all the portraits of his predecessors, and added his
own; but at that time they were all lost or dispersed. He did not know
it seems that they had been removed to Penshurst; nor can we now dis∣cover
at what time they were transported thither.</P>
<P>Many more of the works of Lucas Cornelii were bought up and
brought to England by merchants, who followed Robert Dudley Earl
of Leicester into the Low-countries, and who had observed how much
this master was esteemed here. However, none of these performers
were worthy the patronage of so great a Prince; his munificence was
but ill bestowed 'till it centered on
<Q>HANS HOLBEIN.</Q></P>
<P>Few excellent artists have had more justice done to their merit than
Holbein. His country has paid the highest honours to his memory
and to his labours. His life has been frequently written; every cir∣cumstance

<PB N="65" REF="87"/>
that could be recoverd in relation to him has been sedu∣lously
preserved; and, as always happens to a real genius, he has been
complimented with a thousand wretched performances that were un∣worthy
of him. The year of his birth, the place of his birth have been
contested; yet it is certain that the former happened in 1498, and the
latter most probably was Basil. His father was a painter of Ausburg,
and so much esteemed, that the Lord of Walberg paid an hundred flo∣rins
to the monastery of St. Catherine for a large picture of the saluta∣tion
painted by him. He executed too in half figures the life of St.
Paul, on which he wrote this inscription, “This work was compleated
by J. Holbein, a citizen of Ausburg, 1499.” John Holbein, the elder,
had a brother called Sigismond, a painter too. Hans, so early as 1512,
drew the pictures of both, which came into the possession of Sandrart,
who has engraved them in his book, and which, if not extremely im∣proved
by the engraver, are indeed admirable performances for a boy
of fourteen.</P>
<P>I have said that in the register's office of Wells there is mention of a
Holbein who died here in the reign of Henry VII. Had it been the
father, it would probably have been mentioned by some of the biogra∣phers
of the son; but I find it no where hinted that the father was ever
in England. It is more likely to have been the uncle, who we have
seen was a painter, and do not find that he was a very good one. He
might have come over, and died here in obscurity.</P>
<P>Holbein's inclination to drawing appeared very early, and could not
fail of being encouraged in a family<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Holbein had two brothers, Ambrose and Bruno, who were also painters at Basil.</NOTE> so addicted to the art. His father
<PB N="66" REF="88"/>
himself instructed him; and he learned besides, graving, casting, mo∣delling
and architecture: in the two latter branches he was excellent.
Yet with both talents and taste, he for some time remained in indigence,
dissipating with women what he acquired by the former, and drowning
in wine the delicacy of the latter. At that time Erasmus was retired to
Basil, a man, whose luck of fame was derived from all the circumstan∣ces
which he himself reckoned unfortunate. He lived when learning
was just emerging out of barbarism, and shone by lamenting elegantly
the defects of his cotemporaries. His being one of the first to attack
superstitions which he had not courage to relinquish, gave him merit
in the eyes of protestants, while his time-serving had an air of modera∣tion;
and his very poverty, that threw him into servile adulation, ex∣pressed
itself in terms that were beautifull enough to be transmitted to
posterity. His cupboard of plate, all presented to him by the greatest
men of the age, was at once a monument of his flattery and genius.
With a mind so polished no wonder he distinguished the talents of
young Holbein. He was warmly recommended to employment by
Erasmus and Amerbach,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of him in Palmer's history of printing, p. 218.</NOTE> a printer of that city. He painted the pic∣ture
of the latter in 1519, who showing him the Moriae Encomium of
the former, Holbein drew on the margin many of the characters descri∣bed
in the book. Erasmus was so pleased with those sketches that he
kept the book ten days—the subsequent incidents were trifling indeed,
and not much to the honour of the politeness of either. Holbein, rude∣ly
enough, wrote under the figure of an old student, the name of Eras∣mus.
The author, with very little spirit of repartee, wrote under a
fellow drinking, the name of Holbein. These are anecdotes certainly
<PB N="67" REF="89"/>
not worth repeating for their importance, but very descriptive of the
esteem in which two men were held of whom such anecdotes could be
thought worth preserving.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Moriae Encomium published at Basil by M. Patin, 1656, with cuts from Holbein's designs, there is a large account of him collected by Patin, and a catalogue of his works. On those drawings were written the following lines;
<L>Rex Macedon Coo tumidus pictore, cani se</L>
<L>Maeoniae doluit non potuisse sene.</L>
<L>Stultitiae potior sors est; hanc alter Apelles</L>
<L>Pingit, et eloquium laudat, Erasme, tuum.</L>
<L>Seb. Feschius Basil.</L></NOTE></P>
<P>Supported by the protection of these friends, Holbein grew into
great reputation. The earl of Arundel<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Others say it was the earl of Surrey who was travelling into Italy; and that Holbein not recollecting his name, drew his picture by memory, and Sir Thomas More immediately knew it to be that lord.</NOTE> returning from Italy through
Basil, saw his works, was charmed with them, and advised him to go
into England. At first Holbein neglected this advice; but in 1526
his family and the froward temper of his wife increasing, and his bu∣siness
declining, he determined upon that journey.</P>
<P>At first he said he should quit Basil but for a time, and only to raise
the value of his works, which were growing too numerous there; yet
before he went, he intimated that he should leave a specimen of the
power of his abilities. He had still at his house a portrait that he had just
finished for one of his patrons—on the forehead he painted a fly, and
sent the picture to the person for whom it was designed. The gentle∣man
struck with the beauty of the piece, went eagerly to brush off the
fly—and found the deceit. The story soon spread, and as such trifling
<PB N="68" REF="90"/>
deceptions often do, made more impression than greater excellencies▪
Orders were immediately given to prevent the city being deprived of so
wonderfull an artist—but Holbein had withdrawn himself privately.
Erasmus had given him recommendatory letters to Sir Thomas More,
with a present of his own picture by Holbein, which he assured the
Chancellor was more like than one drawn by Albert Durer.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At lord Folkston's at Longford in Wiltshire, are the portraits of Erasmus and Aegidius, said to be drawn by Holbein; they belonged to Dr. Meade, and while in his collection had the following lines written on the frames, and still re∣maining there: On that of Erasmus,
<Q><L>E tenebris clarum doctrinae attollere lumen</L>
<L>Qui felix potuit, primus Erasmus erat.</L>
<L>On Aegidius.</L>
<L>Aegidium musis charum dilexit Erasmus;</L>
<L>Spirat ab Holbenio pictus uterque tuo.</L></Q>
The latter is far the better; that of Erasmus, is stiff and flat. However this is believed to be the very picture which Erasmus sent by Holbein himself to Sir Tho∣mas More, and which was afterwards in the cabinet of Andrew de Loo and from thence passed into the Arundelian collection. But I should rather think it is the picture which was in king Charles's (see his catal. No. 13, p. 154.) where it is said to have been painted by George Spence of Nuremberg. Quintin Matsis too painted Aegidius, with which Sir Thomas More was so pleased, that he wrote a panegyrie on the painter, beginning,
<Q><L>Quintine, o veteris novator artis,</L>
<L>Magno non minor artifex Apelle.</L></Q>
Aegidius held a letter in his hand from Sir Thomas, with his hand-writing so well imitated, that More could not distinguish it himself. Quintin too in the year 1521 drew the picture of the celebrated physician Dr. Linacre.</NOTE> Holbein
stopped for a short time at Antwerp, having other letters for P. Aegi∣dius,
<PB N="69" REF="91"/>
a common friend of Erasmus and More. In those letters the for∣mer
tells Aegidius, that Holbein was very desirous of seeing the works
of Quintin Matsis, the celebrated black-smith painter, whose tools, it is
said, Love converted into a pencil. Of this master Holbein had no
reason to be jealous: With great truth and greater labour, Quintin's
pictures are inferior to Holbein's. The latter smoothed the stiffness of
his manner by a velvet softness and lustre of colouring; the perfor∣mances
of his cotemporary want that perfecting touch; nor are there
any evidences that Quintin could ascend above the coarseness or defor∣mities
of nature. Holbein was equal to dignified character—He could
express the piercing genius of More, or the grace of Ann Boleyn. Em∣ployed
by More, Holbein was employed as he ought to be: This was
the happy moment of his pencil; from painting the author, he rose to
the philosopher, and then sunk to work for the king. I do not know
a single countenance into which any master has poured greater energy
of expression than in the drawing of Sir Thomas More at Kensington:
It has a freedom, a boldness of thought and acuteness of penetration
that attest the sincerity of the resemblance. It is Sir Thomas More in
the rigour of his sense, not in the sweetness of his pleasantry—Here he
is the unblemished magistrate, not that amiable philosopher, whose hu∣mility
neither power nor piety could elate, and whose mirth even mar∣tyrdom
could not spoil. Here he is rather that single cruel judge whom
one knows not how to hate, and who in the vigour of abilities, of know∣ledge
and good humour persecuted others in defence of superstitions
that he himself had exposed; and who capable of disdaining life at the
price of his sincerity, yet thought that God was to be served by promo∣ting
<PB N="70" REF="92"/>
an imposture; who triumphed over Henry and Death, and sunk
to be an accomplice, at least the dupe, of the holy maid of Kent!</P>
<P>Holbein was kindly received by More and was taken into his house
at Chelsea. There he worked for near three years, drawing the por∣traits
of Sir Thomas, his relations and friends. The king visiting the
chancellor, saw some of those pictures, and expressed his satisfaction.
Sir Thomas begged him to accept which ever he liked—but he enqui∣red
for the painter, who was introduced to him. Henry immediately
took him into his own service, and told the chancellor, that now he
had got the artist, he did not want the pictures. An apartment in the
palace was immediately allotted to Holbein, with a salary of 200 florins,
besides his being paid for his pictures: The price of them I no where
find.</P>
<P>Patin says that after three years Holbein returned to Basil to display
his good fortune, but soon returned to England. It is not probable that
he lived so long with Sir Thomas More as is asserted. He drew the
king several times, and I suppose all his queens, though no portrait
of Catherine Parr is known of his hand. He painted too the king's
children, and the chief persons of the court, as will be mentioned here∣after.
The writers of his life relate a story, which Vermander, his first
biographer, affirms came from Dr. Isely of Basil and from Amerbach:
yet, in another place, Vermander complaining of the latter, to whom
he says he applied for anecdotes relating to Holbein and his works;
after eight or ten years could get no other answer, than that it would
cost a great deal of trouble to seek after those things, and that he should
expect to be well paid. The story is, that one day as Holbein was pri∣vately
drawing some lady's picture for the king, a great lord forced
<PB N="71" REF="93"/>
himself into the chamber. Holbein threw him down stairs; the peer
cried out; Holbein bolted himself in, escaped over the top of the house,
and running directly to the king, fell on his knees, and besought his
majesty to pardon him, without declaring the offence. The king pro∣mised
to forgive him if he would tell the truth; but soon began to re∣pent,
saying he should not easily overlook such insults, and bad him
wait in the apartment 'till he had learned more of the matter. Imme∣diately
arrived the lord with his complaint, but sinking the provoca∣tion.
At first the monarch heard the story with temper, but broke out,
reproaching the nobleman with his want of truth, and adding, “You
have not to do with Holbein, but with me; I tell you, of seven pea∣sants
I can make as many lords, but not one Holbein—begone, and
remember, that if you ever pretend to revenge yourself, I shall look
on any injury offered to the painter as done to myself.” Henry's be∣haviour
is certainly the most probable part of the story.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lovelace, in his collection of poems called Lucasta, has an epigram on this subject, but it is not worth repeating.</NOTE></P>
<P>After the death of Jane Seymour, Holbein was sent to Flanders to
draw the picture of the duchess dowager of Milan,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Christiana daughter of Christiern king of Denmark. Lord Herbert says that Holbein drew her picture in three hours. p. 496.</NOTE> widow of Fran∣cis
Sforza, whom Charles V. had recommended to Henry for a fourth
wife, but afterwards changing his mind, prevented him from marrying.
Among the Harleian MSS. there is a letter from Sir Thomas Wyat to
the king, congratulating his majesty on his escape, as the duchess's
chastity was a little equivocal. If it was, considering Henry's temper,
I am apt to think that the duchess had the greater escape. It was
about the same time that it is said she herself sent the king word,
<PB N="72" REF="94"/>
“That she had but one head; if she had two, one of them should be
at his majesty's service.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue saw a whole length of this princess at Mr. Howard's in Soho-square. Such a picture is mentioned to have been in the royal collections.</NOTE></P>
<P>Holbein was next dispatched by Cromwell to draw the lady Anne
of Cleve, and by practicing the common flattery of his profession, was
the immediate cause of the destruction of that great subject, and of the
disgrace that fell on the princess herself. He drew so favorable a<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This very picture, as is supposed, was in the possession of Mr. Barret of Kent, whose collection was sold a few years ago, but the family reserved this and some other curiosities. The print among the illustrious heads is taken from it; and so far justifies the king, that he certainly was not nice, if from that picture he con∣cluded her handsome enough. It has so little beauty, that I should doubt of it's being the very portrait in question—it rather seems to have been drawn after Holbein saw a little with the king's eyes.</NOTE> like∣ness,
that Henry was content to wed her—but when he found her so
inferior to the miniature, the storm which really should have been di∣rected
at the painter, burst on the minister; and Cromwell lost his
head, because Anne was <HI>a Flanders mare,</HI> not a Venus, as Holbein
had represented her.</P>
<P>Little more occurs memorable of this great painter, but that in
1538, the city of Basil, on the increase of his fame, bestowed an annuity
of fifty florins on him for two years, hoping, says my author, that it
would induce him to return to his country, to his wife and his children.
How large so ever that salary might seem in the eyes of frugal Swiss
citizens, it is plain it did not weigh with Holbein against the opulence
of the court of England. He remained here 'till his death, which was
occasioned by the plague in the year 1554, in the fifty-sixth year of his
age. Some accounts make him die in the spot where is now the paper-office;
<PB N="73" REF="95"/>
but that is not likely, as that very place had been king Henry's
private study, and was then appointed for the reception of the letters
and papers left by that prince and of other public papers. Vertue
thought, if he died in the precincts of the palace, that it was in some
slight lodgings there, then called the paper-buildings, or in Scotland∣yard
where the king's artificers lived; but he was rather of opinion
that Holbein breathed his last in the duke of Norfolk's house in the
priory of Christ-church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a priory given at the dissolution to Sir Thomas Audley, from whose family it came by marriage to the duke of Norfolk, but this was not 'till four years after the death of Holbein, consequently Vertue's conjecture is not well grounded.</NOTE> near Aldgate, then called Duke's-place, having
been removed from Whitehall, to make room for the train of Philip,
to whom queen Mary was going to be married.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Holbein was not likely to be in savour in that reign, being supposed a pro∣testant.</NOTE> The spot of his in∣terment
was as uncertain as that of his death. Thomas earl of Arun∣del,
the celebrated collector in the reign of Charles I. was desirous of
erecting a monument for him, but dropped the design from ignorance
of the place. Strype in his edition of Stowe's Survey says that he was
buried in St. Catherine-Cree church, which stands in the cimetery of
that dissolved priory, and consequently close to his patron's house.</P>
<P>Who his wife was, or what family he left we are not told; mention
of some of his children will be made in the list of his works.</P>
<P>Holbein painted in oil, in distemper and water-colours. He had
never practiced the last 'till he came to England, where he learned it of
Lucas Cornelii, and carried it to the highest perfection. His miniatures
have all the strength of oil-colours joined to the most finished delicacy.
<PB N="74" REF="96"/>
He generally painted on a green ground; in his small pictures often on
a deep blue. There is a tradition that he painted with his left hand,
like the Roman knight Turpilius, but this is contradicted by one of
his own portraits that was in the Arundelian collection and came to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord Stafford, in which he holds his pencil in the right hand.</P>
<P>It is impossible to give a compleat catalogue of his works; they were
extremely numerous; and as I have said, that number is increased by
copies, by doubtfull or by pretended pieces. Many have probably
not come to my knowledge; those I shall mention were of his hand,
as far as I can judge.</P>

<P>The dance of Death in the church-yard of the Predicants of the

to strangers through a grate. And yet, as Vertue observed, our
painter had undoubtedly no hand in it. Pope Eugenius IV. appointed
the council of Basil 1431, and it sat there 15 years, during which
time a plague raged that carried off all degrees of people. On the ces∣sation
of it, the work in question was immediately painted as a memo∣rial
of that calamity. Holbein could not be the original painter, for
he was not born 'till 1498; nor had any hand in the part that was add∣ed
in 1529, at which time he had left Basil. Even if he had been there
when it was done (which was about the time of his short return thither)
it is not probable that mention of him would have been omitted in the
inscription which the magistrates caused to be placed under those paint∣ings,
especially when the name of one Hugo Klauber, a painter who
repaired them in 1569, is carefully recorded. But there is a stronger
proof of their not being the work of Holbein, and at the same time an
evidence of his taste. The paintings at Basil are a dull series of figures,
of a pope, emperor, king, queen, &amp;c. each seized by a figure of Death;
but in the prints which Hollar has given of Holbein's drawings of
Death's Dance, a design he borrowed from the work at Basil, there
are groupes of figures, and a richness of fancy and invention peculiar
to himself. Every subject is varied, and adorned with buildings and
habits of the times, which he had the singular art of making pic∣turesque.</P>

of Henry are ascribed to him—I would not warrant many of them.
There is one at Trinity college Cambridge,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It has # <HI>Fecit</HI> upon it; and was probably a copy by Lucas de Heere, of whom hereafter.</NOTE> another at lord Torring∣ton's
at Whitehall, both whole lengths, and another in the gallery of
royal portraits at Kensington, which whoever painted it, is execrable;
one at Petworth, and another in the gallery at Windsor. But there is
one head of that king at Kensington, not only genuine, but perhaps
the most perfect of his works. It hangs by the chimney in the second
room, leading to the great drawing-room; and would alone account
for the judgment of Depiles, who in his scale of picturesque merit,
allows 16 degrees to Holbein, when he had alloted but 12 to Raphael.
I conclude that it was in the same light that Frederic Zucchero consi∣dered
our artist, when he told Goltzius that in some respects he pre∣ferred
him to Raphael. Both Zucchero and Depiles understood the
<PB N="82" REF="104"/>
science too well to make any comparison except in that one particular
of colouring, between the greatest genius, in his way, that has ap∣peared,
and a man who excelled but in one, and that an inferior
branch of his art. The texture of a rose is more delicate than that of
an oak; I do not say that it grows so lofty or casts so extensive a shade.</P>
<P>Opposite to this picture hangs another, but much inferior, called in
the catalogue lord Arundel, or Howard;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fine original of Thomas Howard duke of Norfolk with the staves of earl-marshal and lord treasurer, from whence the print is taken, is at Leicester-house.</NOTE> the latter name is a confu∣sion,
occasioned by the title of Arundel passing into the family of
Howard. The portrait in question, I suppose, is of H. Fitzalan earl
of Arundel, and probably the very person who first persuaded Hol∣bein
to come into England.</P>
<P>In the state bed-chamber is a portrait of Edward VI. It was origi∣nally
a half length; but has been very badly converted into a whole
figure since the time of Holbein.</P>
<P>Considering how long he lived in the service of the crown, it is sur∣prizing
that so few of his works should have remained in the royal col∣lection;
Charles I. appears by his catalogue to have possessed but about
a dozen. All the rest were dispersed but those I have mentioned (unless
the whole length of the unfortunate earl of Surrey, in a red habit, in
the lower apartment at Windsor is so, as I believe it is) and a fine little
picture of a man and woman, said to be his own and wife's portraits
which hangs in an obscure closet in the gallery at Windsor; and the
portrait of a man opening a letter with a knife, in the standard-closet
in the same palace. But at present an invaluable treasure of the works
<PB N="83" REF="105"/>
of this master is preserved in one of our palaces. Soon after the acces∣sion
of the late king, queen Caroline found in a bureau at Kensington
a noble collection of Holbein's original drawings for the portraits of
some of the chief personages of the court of Henry VIII. How they
came there is quite unknown. They did belong to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After Holbein's death they had been sold into France, from whence they were brought and presented to king Charles by Mons. de Liencourt. Vanderdort, who did nothing but blunder, imagined they were portraits of the French court.

changed them with William earl of Pembroke for a St. George by

are duplicates: a great part are exceedingly fine,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Some have been rubbed, and others traced over with a pen on the outlines by some unskillfull hand. In an old inventory belonging to the family of Lum∣ley mention was made of such a book in that family, with a remarkable note, that it had belonged to Edward VI. and that the names of the persons were written on them by Sir John Cheke. Most of the drawings at Kensington have names in an old hand; and the probability of their being written by a minister of the court who so well knew the persons represented, is an addition to their value.</NOTE> and in one respect
preferable to his finished pictures, as they are drawn in a bold and free
manner: and though they have little more than the out-line, being
drawn with chalk upon paper stained of a flesh colour, and scarce
<PB N="84" REF="106"/>
shaded at all, there is a strength and vivacity in them equal to the
most perfect portraits. The heads of Sir Thomas More,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Richardson the painter had another of these, which was sold at his auction, and from whence Houbraken's print among the illustrious heads was taken.</NOTE> bishop
Fisher, Sir Thomas Wyat, and Broke lord Cobham are master-pieces.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They were first placed by the queen at Richmond, but afterwards removed to Kensington where they still remain; but it is a very improper place for them, ma∣ny hanging against the light or with scarce any, and some so high as not to be dis∣cernible, especially a most gracefull head of the duchess of Suffolk.</NOTE>
It is great pity that they have not been engraved, not only that such
frail performances of so great a genius might be preserved, but that the
resemblances of so many illustrious persons, no where else existing,
might be saved from destruction. Vertue had undertaken this noble
work, and after spending part of three years on it, broke off, I do not
know why, after having traced off on oil-paper but about five and
thirty. These I bought at his sale; and they are so exactly taken as
to be little inferior to the originals.</P>
<P>In the same closet are two fine finished portraits by Holbein, said to
be his own and his wife's; they were presented to queen Caroline by
Sir Robert Walpole, my father.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The father of lord treasurer Oxford passing over London bridge, was caught in a shower, and stepping into a goldsmith's shop for shelter, he found there a pic∣ture of Holbein (who had lived in that house) and his family.

<P>He drew Will. Somers,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a burlesque figure of him in the armory at the Tower.</NOTE> king Henry's jester, from which there is a
print. It is perhaps a little draw-back on the fame of heroes and states∣men,
that such persons, who shared at least an equal portion of royal
favour formerly, continue to occupy a place even in the records of time—at
least, we antiquarians, who hold every thing worth preserving,
merely because it has been preserved, have with the names of Henry,
Charles, Elizabeth, Francis I. Wolsey, Sir Thomas More, &amp;c. trea∣sured
up those of Will. Somers, Saxton, Tom Derry, (queen Anne's
jester) Tarlton, (queen Elizabeth's) Pace, another fool in that reign,
Archee, the disturber of Land's greatness; Muckle John, who suc∣ceeded;
Patch, Wolsey's fool; Harry Patenson, Sir Thomas More's;
and of Bisquet and Amaril, the jesters of Francis I. not to mention
Hitard,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Dart's antiq. of Canterbury, p. 6.</NOTE> king Edmund's buffoon; Stone,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A fool mentioned in Selden's table-talk.</NOTE> and Jeffery Hudson, the
dwarf of Henrietta Maria. Of some of these personages I have found
the following anecdotes: Saxton is the first person recorded to have
worn a wig: In an account of the treasurer of the chambers in the
reign of Henry VIII. there is entered “Paid for Saxton, the king's
fool, for a wig, 20 <HI>s.</HI>” In the accounts of the lord Harrington who
was in the same office under James I. there is, “Paid to T. Mawe for
<PB N="86" REF="108"/>
the diet and lodging of Tom Derry, her majesty's jester, 13 weeks,
10 <HI>l.</HI>—18 <HI>s.</HI>—6 <HI>d.</HI>” Patch and Archee were political characters: The
former, who had been Wolsey's fool, and who like wiser men, had
lived in favour through all the changes of religion and folly with which
four successive courts had amused themselves or tormented every body
else, was employed by Sir Francis Knollys to break down the crucifix,
which queen Elizabeth still retained in her chapel; and the latter, I
suppose on some such instigation, demolished that which Laud erected
at St. James's, and which was probably the true cause of that prelate
engaging the king and council in his quarrel, though abusive words
were the pretence. Of little Jeffery I shall say more in another place.</P>
<P>King James II. as appears by the catalogue of his pictures published
by Bathoe, had several of Holbein; though all in that list were not
painted by him.</P>
<P>Of Holbein's public works in England I find an account of only
four. The first is that capital picture in surgeon's hall, of Henry VIII.
giving the charter to the company of surgeons. The character of his
majesty's bluff haughtiness is well represented, and all the heads are
finely executed. The picture itself has been retouched, but is well
known by Baron's print. The physician in the middle on the king's
left hand is Dr. Butts, immortalized by Shakespear.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ring which Henry sent by Dr. Butts to Cardinal Wolsey, was a cameo on a ruby of the king himself, formerly given to him by the Cardinal.</NOTE></P>
<P>The second is the large piece in the hall of Bridewell, representing
Edward VI. delivering to the lord mayor of London the royal charter,
by which he gave up and erected his palace of Bridewell into an hos∣pital
and workhouse. Holbein has placed his own head in one corner of
the picture. Vertue has engraved it. This picture, it is believed, was
<PB N="87" REF="109"/>
not compleated by Holbein, both he and the king dying immediately
after the donation.</P>
<P>The third and fourth were two large pictures, painted in distemper,
in the hall of the Easterling merchants in the Steelyard, Where Des∣camps
found, I do not know, that they were designed for ceilings.
It is probably a mistake. These pictures exhibited the triumphs of
riches and poverty. The former was represented by Plutus riding in a
golden carr; before him sat Fortune scattering money, the chariot
being loaded with coin, and drawn by four white horses, but blind,
and led by women, whose names were written beneath. Round the carr
were crowds with extended hands catching at the favours of the god.
Fame and Fortune attended him, and the procession was closed by
Croesus, Midas, and other avaritious persons of note.</P>
<P>Poverty was an old woman, sitting in a vehicle as shattered as the
other was superb; her garments squalid, and every emblem of wretch∣edness
around her. She was drawn by asses and oxen, which were
guided by Hope, and Diligence, and other emblematic figures, and at∣tended
by mechanics and labourers, The richness of the colouring,
the plumpness of the flesh, the gaudy ornaments in the former; and
the strong touches and expression in the latter were universally admi∣red.
It was on the sight of these pictures that Zucchero expressed such
esteem of this master: he copied them in Indian ink, and those draw∣ings
came afterwards into the possession of Mons. Crozat. Vosterman
jun. engraved prints from them, at least of the triumph of Poverty,
but Vertue could never meet with that of Riches: however in Buck∣ingham-house
in St. James's park, he found two such drawings, on
one of which was an inscription attributing them to Holbein, and add∣ing,
<PB N="88" REF="110"/>
that they were the gift of Sir Thomas More, who wrote verses
under them. Vertue thought that these drawings were neither of
Holbein nor Zucchero, but the copies which Vosterman had made,
in order to engrave. These drawings I suppose were sold in the
duchess's auction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So I concluded, but have since been so lucky to find that they were pre∣served at Buckingham house, till it was purchased by his majesly, when the pic∣tures being exposed to auction, these very drawings were exhibited there, as alle∣goric pieces by Vandyck. They more than come up to any advantageous idea I had formed of Holbein. The composition of each is noble, free, and masterly. The expressions admirable, the attitudes gracefull, and several of them bearing great resemblance to the style of Raphael. The Triumph of Riches is much wider than the other. The figures in black and white chalk, the skies coloured. On each are Latin verses, but no mention of Holbein, as Vertue relates. The figure of Croesus has great resemblance to the younger portraits of Henry VIII. By the masterly execution of these drawings, I should conclude them Zucchero's copies; but the horses, which are remarkably fine and spirited, and other touches, are so like the manner of Vandyck, that one is apt to attribute them to Voster∣man who lived in his time. Probably the Triumph of Riches is Vosterman's copy and that of Poverty, Zucchero's. They are now at Strawberry-hill.</NOTE> For the large pictures themselves Felibien and
Depiles say that they were carried into France from Flanders, whither
they were transported I suppose after the destruction of the company,
of which Stowe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Survey of London p. 249.</NOTE> gives the following account. The Steelyard was a
place for merchants of Almaine who used to bring hither wheat, rye,
and other grain; cables, ropes, masts, steel and other profitable mer∣chandize.
Henry III. at the request of his brother Richard earl of
Cornwall and king of Almaine gave them great privileges, they then
having a house called, Guilda Aula Teutonicorum. Edward I. con∣firmed
<PB N="89" REF="111"/>
their charter; and in the same reign there was a great quarrel
between the mayor of London and those merchants of the Haunce,
about the reparation of Bishop-gate, which was imposed on them in
consideration of their privileges, and which they suffered to run to ruin.
Being condemned to the repairs, they were in recompence indulged
with granaries, and an alderman of their own; but in time were com∣plained
of, for importing too great quantities of foreign grain. They
were restricted, yet still increased in wealth, and had a noble hall in
Thames-street with three arched gates, and in the reign of Edward III.
they hired another house of Richard Lions, a famous lapidary, one of
the sheriffs, who was beheaded by the Kentish rebels in the reign of
Richard II, and another for which they paid 70<HI>l.</HI> per ann. But still
continuing to engross the trade, they were suppressed in the reign of
Edward VI. who seized the liberties of the Steelyard into his own
hands.</P>
<P>But for nothing has Holbein's name been oftener mentioned than
for the picture of Sir Thomas More's family, Yet of six pieces ex∣tant
on this subject, the two smaller are certainly copies, the three
larger probably not painted by Holbein, and the sixth, tho' an original
picture, most likely not of Sir Thomas and his family. That Hol∣bein
was to draw such a piece is indubitable; a letter of Erasmus is
extant, thanking Sir Thomas for sending him the sketch of it; but there
is great presumption, that though Holbein made the design, it was
not he who executed the picture in large, as will appear by the follow∣ing
accounts of the several pieces. The most known is that at Burford,
the seat of the famous Speaker Lenthall. To say that a performance
is not equal to the reputation of it's supposed author, is not always an
<PB N="90" REF="112"/>
argument sufficient to destroy it's authenticity. It is a well-known say∣ing
of Sir Godfrey Kneller, when he was reproached with any of his
hasty slovenly daubings, “Pho, it will not be thought mine; nobody
will believe that the same man painted this and the Chinese at Wind∣sor.”</P>
<P>But there is a speaking evidence on the picture itself against it's own
pretensions. Holbein died in 1554. The picture at Burford is dated
1593. It is larger and there are more figures than in it's rival, the
piece in Yorkshire, and some of these Vertue thought were painted
from the life. This was kept at Gubbins in Hertfordshire, the seat of
the Mores; but by what means the piece passed into the hands of
Lenthall, is uncertain; the remains of the family of More are seated
at Barnborough in Yorkshire, where they have a small picture of their
ancestor and his relations like that at Burford, but undoubtedly not an
original. There too they preserve some relicks which belonged to that
great man; as a George enamelled, and within it a miniature of Sir
Thomas; a gold cross with pearl drops, and the cap he wore at his
execution.</P>
<P>The second picture is at Heron in Essex, the seat of Sir John Tyrrel,
but having been repainted, it is impossible to judge of it's antiquity.
The dispute of originality has lain only between the piece at Burford,
and the next.</P>
<P>The third large picture, and which Vertue thought the very one
painted for Sir Thomas himself, is twelve feet wide, and is the actual
piece which was in Deloo's collection, after whose death it was bought
by Mr. Roper, Sir Thomas's grandson. As Deloo was a collector of
Holbein's works, and his contemporary, it sounds extraordinary, that a
<PB N="91" REF="113"/>
picture, which he thought genuine, should be doubted now; and yet
Vertue gives such strong reason, supported by so plausible an hypothe∣sis,
to account for its not being Holbein's, that I think them worth lay∣ing
before the reader. He says the picture is but indifferent; on this
I lay no more stress than I do in the case of that at Burford; but his
observation that the lights and shades in different parts of the picture
come from opposite sides, is unanswerable, and demonstrate it no ge∣nuine
picture of Holbein, unless that master had been a most ignorant
dauber, as he might sometimes be a careless painter. This absurdity
Vertue accounts for, by supposing, that Holbein quitted the chancel∣lor's
service for the king's, before he had drawn out the great picture,
which however Sir Thomas always understood was to be executed;
that Holbein's business increasing upon him, some other painter was
employed to begin the picture, and to which Holbein was to give the
last touches; in short that inimitable perfection of flesh which charac∣terizes
his works. And this is the more probable as Vertue observed
that the faces and hands are left flat and unfinished, but the ornaments,
jewels, &amp;c. are extremely laboured. As the portraits of the family,
in seperate pieces, were already drawn by Holbein, the injudicious
journeyman stuck them in as he found them, and never varied the
lights, which were disposed, as it was indifferent in single heads, some
from the right, some from the left, but which make a ridiculous con∣tradiction
when transported into one piece. This picture, purchased
as I have said by Mr. Roper, the son of that amiable Margaret, whose
behaviour when Sir Thomas returned to the tower was a subject not
for Holbein, but for Poussin or Shakespear! This picture remained
'till of late years at Wellhall in Eltham, Kent, the mansion of the Ro∣pers.
<PB N="92" REF="114"/>
That house being pulled down, it hung for some time in the
king's house at Greenwich, soon after which, by the death of the last
Roper, whose sole daughter married Mr. Henshaw, and left three
daughters, the family-picture then valued at 300<HI>l.</HI> came between them,
and Sir Rowland Wynne, who married one of them, bought the
shares of the other two, and carried the picture into Yorkshire where
it now remains.</P>
<P>The other small one is in the collection of colonel Sothby in Blooms∣bury-square.
It is painted in the neatest manner in miniature. On
the right hand are inserted the portraits of Mr. More and his wife,
Sir Thomas's grandson, for whom it was drawn, and their two sons,
with their garden at Chelsea behind, and a view of London. The
painter of this exquisite little piece is unknown.</P>
<P>The fifth was in the palace of the Delfino family at Venice, where it
was long on sale, the price first set 1500<HI>l.</HI> When I saw it there in 1741,
they had sunk it to 400<HI>l.</HI> soon after which the present king of Polend
bought it.</P>
<P>It was evidently designed for a small altar-piece to a chapel; in the
middle on a throne sits the Virgin and child; on one side kneels an
elderly gentleman with two sons, one of them a naked infant; opposite
kneeling are his wife and daughters. The old man is not only unlike
all representations of Sir Thomas More, but it is certain that he never
had but one son<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is recorded a bon-mot of Sir Thomas on the birth of his son: He had three daughters: His wife was impatient for a son; at last they had one, but not much above an idiot—“You have prayed so long for a boy, said the chancellor, that now we have got one who, I believe, will be a boy as long as he lives.”</NOTE>—For the colouring it is beautifull beyond descrip∣tion,
<PB N="93" REF="115"/>
and the carnations have that enamelled bloom so peculiar to
Holbein, who touched his works 'till not a touch remained discerni∣ble!
A drawing of this picture by Bischop was brought over in 1723,
from whence Vertue doubted both of the subject and the painter; but
he never saw the original! By the description of the family-picture of
the consul Mejer, mentioned above, I have no doubt but this is the
very picture—Mejer and More are names not so unlike, but that in
process of time they may have been confounded, and that of More re∣tained,
as much better known.</P>
<P>In private houses in England are or were the following works of
Holbein, besides what may not have come to Vertue's or my know∣ledge.</P>
<P>In the Arundelian collection, says Richard Symonds,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In one of his pocket-books which will be mentioned more particularly in the second volume.</NOTE> was a head
of Holbein in oil by himself, most sweet, dated 1543.</P>

Zucchero admired exceedingly.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">There is a view of the Siege of Pavia at Wilton, said to be by Holbein, but it is by Albert Durer. I even question whether the profile of Edward VI. there be an original.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="116"/>
The duke of Buckingham had eight of his hand, in particular the
story of Jupiter and Io. See his catal. p. 16.</P>
<P>At the earl of Uxbridge's at Drayton, his ancestor lord Paget.</P>
<P>At the earl of Guilford's at Wroxton, Sir Thomas Pope, the founder
of Trinity-college, Oxford.</P>
<P>At Blenheim, a very lively head of a young man.</P>
<P>At Buckingham house was the portrait of Edmund lord Sheffield.</P>
<P>Henry VIII. and Francis I. exchanged two pictures; the king of
France gave to Henry the Virgin and child by Leonardo da Vinci;
the English present was painted by Holbein, but the subject is not men∣tioned.
The former came into the possession of Catherine Patin.</P>
<P>In the late duke of Somerset's possession was a head of his ancestor
the protector, engraved among the illustrious heads.</P>
<P>Vertue mentions having seen a fine miniature of Henry VIII. and
his three children, but does not say where. It had a glass over it, and
a frame curiously carved.</P>
<P>At lord Orford's at Hougton is a small whole length of Edward
VI. on board, which was sold into Portugal from the collection of
Charles I. and Erasmus, smaller than life.</P>
<P>I have</P>

Charles II. I bought it at the sale of the lady Isabella Scott, daughter
of the duchess of Monmouth.</P>
<P>A head of the same queen on board in oil; hard, and in her latter
age. It is engraved among the illustrious heads.</P>
<P>Cath. Howard, a miniature, damaged. It was Richardson's who

illustrious heads; and by Hollar, who called it, Mary queen of France,
wife of Charles Brandon duke of Suffolk.</P>
<P>Edmund Montacute, a judge. D<SUP>o</SUP>. flat.</P>
<P>Philip, the Fair, son of the emperor Maximilian, and father of
Charles V. when a boy. It is finely coloured; and is engraved in
Mountfaucon's antiquities of France. This must have been copied
from some other picture.</P>
<P>A drawing of a man in a blue gown, cap, and buskins. It seems to
be a masquerade dress.</P>
<P>Another drawing, the head of a man, with a hat and picked beard.</P>
<P>A design in water colours, which he afterwards executed on a house
at Basil.</P>
<P>A head of Melancthon, in oil on board, a small round, very fine.</P>
<P>Several drawings by Holbein, and some miniatures are preserved
in various collections.</P>
<P>There is a very curious picture in the collection of col. Sothby, said
to be begun in France by Janet, and which Vertue thinks might be
retouched by Holbein, as it was probably painted for his patron the
duke of Norfolk, from whom it descended immediately to the earl
of Arundel, out of whose collection the father of the present possessor
purchased it. It represents three royal pair dancing in a meadow, with
a magnificent building at a distance; they are Henry VIII. and Anne
Boleyn; and his sisters Margaret queen of Scots and Mary queen of
France with their second husbands, Archibald Douglas and Charles
Brandon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was Vertue's opinion. The account in the family calls the man in the middle the duke of Norfolk, and him on the right hand the duke of Suffolk If the tradition that this picture represents only English personages were not so well grounded, I should take it for a French composition. The person in the middle is a black swarthy man with a sharp beard, like Francis I. and resembling neither of the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the former of whom is never drawn with a beard, the latter always with a short square one: add to this, that the figure called Henry VIII. and which certainly has much of his countenance, is in an obscure corner of the picture, and exhibits little more than the face.</NOTE> The circumstances of three matches so unequal assembled
<PB N="96" REF="118"/>
together, induced Vertue, with much probability to conclude that it
was a tacit satire, and painted for the duke of Norfolk, who, however
related to Anne Boleyn, was certainly not partial to her, as protectress
of the reformed. If this conj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cture could be verified, it would lead
one to farther reflections. The jealousy which Henry towards the
end of his reign conceived against the Howards, and his sacrificing
the galant earl of Surrey for quartering the arms of England, as he
undoubtedly had a right to quarter them, have always appeared acts
of most tyrannic suspicion. He so little vouchsafed to satisfy the pub∣lic
on the grounds of his proceedings, that it is possible he might some∣times
act on better foundation than any body knew. If he really dis∣covered
any ambitious views in the house of Norfolk, this picture
would seem a confirmation of them. To expose the blemishes in the
blood of the three only branches of the royal family, might be a lead∣ing
step towards asserting their own claim—at least their own line
would not appear less noble, than the descendents of Boleyn, Brandon
and Douglas.</P>
<P>Holbein's talents were not confined to his pictures; he was an ar∣chitect,
he modelled, carved, was excellent in designing ornaments,
and gave draughts of prints for several books, some of which it is sup∣posed

He invented patterns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The noble seal appendent to the surrender of Cardinal Wolsey's college at Oxford, has all the appearance of being designed by Holbein.

gold-smith's work, for enamellers and chasers of plate, arts much
countenanced by Henry VIII. Inigo Jones showed Sandrart another
book of Holbein's designs for weapons, hilts, ornaments, scabbards,
sheaths, sword-belts, buttons and hooks, girdles, hatbands and clasps
for shoes, knives, forks, saltsellers and vases, all for the king. Hollar
engraved several of them. The duchess of Portland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The dagger, in her grace's collection, is set with jacynths, and cost lord Ox∣ford 45<HI>l.</HI> at Tart-hall, when the remains of the Arundelian collection were sold there in 1720.</NOTE> and lady Eli∣zabeth
Germayn have each a dagger set with jewels, which belonged
to that prince and were probably imagined by Holbein. The latter
lady has a fine little figure of Henry cut in stone, whole length; Hol∣bein
cut his own head in wood, and I have another by his hand of the
king▪ in which about his neck instead of a George he wears a watch.
Two other figures carved in stone were in the museum of Tradescant
at Lambeth.</P>
<P>His cuts to the bible were engraved and printed at Leyden by Jo∣hannes
Frellonius, in 1547, under this title, Icones Historiarum vete∣ris
Testamenti. The titles to every print are in Latin, and beneath is
an explanation in four French verses. Prefixed is a copy of Latin
verses, in honour of Holbein, by Nicholas Borbonius, a celebrated
<PB N="98" REF="120"/>
French poet of that time, and of whom there is a profile among the
drawings at Kensington.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In St. John's college Camb. is Henry the 8th's bible printed on vellum, with Holbein's cuts finely illuminated, and the figures of Henry, Cromwell and others.</NOTE></P>
<P>Lord Arundel showed Sandrart a little book of twenty-two designs
of the Passion of Christ, very small; in which, says the same author,
Christ was every where represented in the habit of a black monk—but
that was a mistake, for Hollar engraved them, and there is only Christ
persecuted by monks. Sandrart adds that it is incredible what a quan∣tity
of drawings of this master lord Arundel had collected, and sur∣prizing,
the fruitfullness of Holbein's invention, his quickness of exe∣cution
and industry in performing so much.</P>
<P>To the Catechismus or Instruction of Christian Religion, by Tho∣mas
Cranmer, printed by Walter Lynn 1538, quarto, the title is a
wooden cut representing Edward VI. sitting on his throne giving the
bible to the Archbishop and Nobles kneeling: This and several head∣pieces
in the same book were designed by Holbein, and probably some
of them cut by him; one has his name.</P>
<P>On the death of Sir Thomas Wyat the poet in 1541, a little book
of verses, entituled Naenia, was published by his great admirer Le∣land.
Prefixed was a wooden cut of Sir Thomas, from a picture of
Holbein, with these lines;
<Q><L>Holbenus nitidâ pingendi maximus arte</L>
<L>Effigiem expressit graphicè; sed nullus Apelles</L>
<L>Exprimet ingenium felix animumque Viati.</L></Q></P>
<P>Of his architecture nothing now remains standing but the beautifull
porch at the earl of Pembroke's at Wilton. From that and his draw∣ings
<PB N="99" REF="121"/>
it is evident that he had great natural taste. One cannot but la∣ment
that a noble monument of his genius has lately been demolished,
the gateway at Whitehall, supposed to have been erected for the entry
of Charles V. but that was a mistake; the emperor was here in 1521;
Holbein did not arrive at soonest 'till five years after. Peacham men∣tions
a design that he saw for a chimney-piece for Henry's new palace
at Bridewell. There undoubtedly, at Whitehall, and at Nonsuch
were many of his productions.</P>
<P>It may be wondered that I have said nothing of a work much re∣nowned
and ascribed to this master; I mean the chamber at the lord
Montacute's at Coudray; but it is most certainly not executed by him.
Though the histories represented there, the habits and customs of the
times, make that room a singular curiosity, they are it's only merit.
There is nothing good either in th designs, disposition or colouring.</P>
<P>There are three other historic pieces in the same house, of much
more merit, ascribed likewise to Holbein, and undoubtedly of his time.
The first represents Francis I. on his throne, with his courtiers, and
the duke of Suffo (so it is written) and the earl of Southampton stand∣ing
before him on an embassy. This is by much the worst of the three,
and has been repainted. The next is smaller, and exhibits two knights
running a tilt on the foreground; one wears the crown of France,
another a coronet, like that of an English prince, composed of crosses
and fleurs de lys, and not closed at top. An elderly man with a broad
face, and an elderly lady in profile, with several other figures, boldly
painted, but not highly finished, are sitting to see the tilt. On the
back ground is the French king's tent, and several figures dancing, re∣joycing,
and preparing entertainments. A person seems leading a
queen to the tent. Under this is written, “The meeting of the kings
<PB N="100" REF="122"/>
between Guines and Arden in the Vale of Gold.” This is an upright
piece. The third is the largest, broad like the first. Francis on his
throne at a distance with guards &amp;c. on each side in a line. Before him
sit on stools with their backs towards you four persons in black, and
one like a clergyman standing in the middle and haranguing the king.
One each side sit noblemen, well drawn, coloured and neatly finished.
On this piece is written, “The great ambassade sent to the French
king, of the earl of Worcester, lord chamberlain, the bishop of Ely, the
lord St. John, the lord Vaux and others.” These pictures I should
not think of Holbein; the figures are more free than his, less finished,
and the colouring fainter: and none of the English seem portraits.
The spelling too of <HI>Suffo,</HI> is French. Probably these pieces were done
by Janet, who was an able master, was contemporary with Holbein,
and whose works are often confounded with our painter's.</P>
<P>Holbein's fame was so thoroughly established,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sandrart.</NOTE> even in his life, that
the Italian masters vouchsafed to borrow from him. In particular
Michael Angelo Caravaggio was much indebted to him in two differ∣ent
pictures. Rubens was so great an admirer of his works that he
advised young Sandrart to study his Dance of Death, from which Ru∣bens
himself had made drawings.</P>
<P>This account of a man, dear to connoisseurs for the singular perfec∣tion
of his colouring, become dear to antiquaries by the distance of
time in which he lived, by the present scarcity of his works, and by
his connections with More and Erasmus, I must close with all I can
discover more relating to him; that he formed but one scholar, Chris∣topher
Amberger of Ausburg; and that in a roll<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was in the possession of Mr. Holmes keeper of the records in the tower, and was exhibited to the Antiquarian society in 1736.</NOTE> of new-year's gifts

<P>The advancement of his salary is a proof that Holbein was both
favoured and poor. As he was certainly very laborious, it is probable
that the luxury of Britain did not teach him more oeconomy than he
had practiced in his own country.</P>
<P>Henry, besides these painters had several artists of note in his ser∣vice.
The superb tomb of his father, says Stowe,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 499.</NOTE> was not finished
'till the eleventh year of this king, 1519. It was made, adds the same
author, by one Peter, a painter of Florence, for which he received a
thousand pounds, for the whole stuff and workmanship. This Peter,
Vertue discovered to be, Pietro Torregiano, a valuable sculptor. That
he was here in the preceding year appears by a book of acts, orders,
decrees and records of the Court of Requests printed in 1592 in quarto,
where it is said, p. 60, that in a cause between two Florentine mer∣chants,
Peter de Bardi and Bernard Cavalcanti, heard before the coun∣cil
at Greenwich, master Peter Torisano, a Florentine sculptor, was
one of the witnesses. Vasari says, that Torregiano having made seve∣ral
figures in marble and small brass, which were in the town-hall at
Florence, and drawn many things with spirit and a good manner, in
competition with Michael Angelo (and consequently could be no de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pi∣cable
<PB N="103" REF="125"/>
performer) was carried into England by some merchants, and en∣tertained
in the king's service, for whom he executed variety of works
in marble, brass, and wood, in concurrence with other masters of this
country, over all whom he was allowed the superiority—He receiv∣ed,
adds Vasari, such noble rewards, that if he had not been a proud,
inconsiderate, ungovernable man, he might have lived in great felicity
and made a good end; but the contrary happened, for leaving Eng∣land
and settling in Spain, after several performances there, he was
accused of being a heretic,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a passion he had broken an image of the Virgin, that he had just carved.</NOTE> was thrown into the inquisition, tried
and condemned—the execution indeed was respited, but he became
melancholy mad and starved himself to death at Seville in 1522 in the
fiftieth year of his age.</P>
<P>Torregiano, it seems, with Henry's turbulence of temper, had a∣dopted
his religion, and yet, as he quitted England, one should sup∣pose
had not suppleness enough to please the monarch, even after
that complaisance. In the life of Benvenuto Cellini is farther evi∣dence
of Torreggiano's being employed here, and of his disputes with
Michael Angelo.</P>
<P>When Cellini was about seventeen he says there arrived at Florence
a sculptor called Pietro Torreggiani, who came from England where
he had resided many years; this artist much frequenting Cellini's
master, told the former, that having a great work of bronze to execute
for the king of England, he was come to engage as many youths as
he could to assist him; and that Cellini being rather a sculptor than a
graver, Torreggiani offered to make his fortune if he would accom∣pany
him to London. He was, adds Cellini, of a noble presence, bold,
and with the air of a great soldier rather than of a statuary, his admi∣rable
<PB N="104" REF="126"/>
gestures, sonorous voice, and the action of his brow striking with
amazement, ed ogni giorno ragionava delle sue bravure con quelle be∣stie
di quelli Inglesi, every day relating his brave treatment of those
beasts the English. But as much struck as Cellini was with this lofty
behaviour to us savages, he took an aversion to his new master, on the
latter boasting of a blow in the face that he had given to the divine
Michael Angelo with his fist, the marks of which he would carry to his
grave. Others say that this event happened in the palace of the Car∣dinal
de' Medici, Torreggiano being jealous of the superior honours
paid to Michael Angelo, whose nose was flattened by the blow. The
aggressor fled, and entered into the army, where he obtained a cap∣tain's
commission, but being soon disgusted with that life, he retired to
Florence, and from thence came to England.</P>
<P>To Torreggiano Vertue ascribes likewise the tomb of Margaret
countess of Richmond, the mother of Henry VII. and that of Dr.
Young master of the rolls, in the chapel at the rolls in Chancery-lane.
There is a head of Henry VIII. in plaister in a round at Hampton-court,
which I should suppose is by the same master.</P>

Walker, founder; Nicholas Ewer, copper-smith and gilder; John
Bell and John Maynard, painters; Robert Vertue, Robert Jenings,
and John Lebons, master masons. There was another called William

It appears however from their books at King's college [as I am informed by my friend Mr. Baker, the learned antiquary of Cambridge] that one Mr. Cloos, father of Nicholas Cloos, one of the first fellows of that college, and afterwards bishop of Litchfield, was the architect of that chapel [though Godwin says the bishop himself was master of the king's works here] as far as king Henry 6th's share reacheth, and contriver or designer of the whole, afterwards finished by Henry 7th, and beauti∣fied by Henry 8th.”</P>

In these instruments there appears little less simplicity than in the old
ones I have reported of Henry III. Yet as much as we imagine our∣selves
arrived at higher perfection in the arts, it would not be easy for a
master of a college now to go into St. Margaret's parish or Southwark
and bespeak the roof of such a chapel as that of King's college, and a
dozen or two of windows, so admirably drawn, and order them to be
sent home by such a day, as if he was bespeaking a chequered pave∣ment
or a church bible. Even those obscure artists Williamson, Sy∣monds,
Flower, Hoone, &amp;c. would figure as considerable painters in
any reign; and what a rarity in a collection of drawings would be
one of their vidimus's! It is remarkable that one of the finest of these
windows is the story of Ananias and Saphira as told by Raphael in
the cartoons—probably the cartoons being consigned to Flanders for
tapestry, drawings from them were sent hither; an instance of the di∣ligence

<P>In the cathedral of Chichester are pictures of the kings of England
and bishops of that see, painted about the year 1519 by one Bernardi,

expence of bishop Sherborne, who erected a monument for himself,
yet remaining there. Vermander mentions one Theodore Bernardi of
Amsterdam, master of Michael Coxie, who Vertue thinks painted those

works at Chichester, as they are in a Dutch taste. They were repaint∣ed
in 1747 by one Tremaine.</P>
<P>The congenial temper of Wolsey displayed itself in as magnificent a
manner as the king's. Whitehall, Hampton-court, and his college of
Christ-church, were monuments of his grandeur and disgrace, flowing
from the bounty of and then reverting to the crown. In 1524 he be∣gun
a monument for himself at Windsor, erecting a small chapel ad∣joining
to St. George's church which was to contain his tomb, the de∣sign
whereof, says lord Herbert,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 342.</NOTE> was so glorious that it exceeded far
that of Henry VII. One Benedetto, a statuary of Florence took it in
hand and continued it 'till 1529, receiving for so much as was already
done 4250 ducats. The Cardinal, adds the historian, when this was
finished, did purpose to make a tomb for Henry, but on his fall, the
king made use of so much as he found fit and called it his. Dr. Fiddes
says that the Cardinal made suit to the king to have his own image
with such part of his tomb as shall please the king to let him have, to
be sent to York, where he intended to be buried. In the same collec∣tions
mention is made of Antony Cavallari, as guilder of the tomb,
whom the Cardinal is besought to permit to return home to Antwerp,
if he means to employ him no farther, and also that Benedict the carver
may return to Italy. But Benedict Henry took into his own service,
and employed on the same tomb which his majesty had now adopted
for himself—This person was Benedetto da Rovezzano, another Flo∣rentine
sculptor, who, Vasari says, executed many works of marble
and bronze for Henry, and got an ample fortune, with which he re∣turned
to his native country, but his eyes having suffered by working
in the foundery, he grew blind in 1550 and died soon after. The
<PB N="111" REF="133"/>
celebrated Baccio Bandinelli made an admirable model of wood with
figures of wax for the same monument; but Benedetto of Rovezzano,
it seems, was preferred.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I suppose it was Antony Cavallari or Benedetto da Rovezzano who made the large statue in metal of Henry VIII. in a cloyster at Gorhambury; it is not in a bad taste.</NOTE></P>

See Leland's comment on the Cygnea Cantio published with his Itinerary by Hearne, vol. 9.</NOTE> chapel was never compleated. Henry and Jane
Seymour were buried in St. George's church, with an intention of their
being removed into the monument as soon as it should be finished.
Charles I. resumed the design, proposing to enlarge the chapel and fit
it for his own and the interment of his successors. But the whole was
demolished in 1646, by order of parliament and the rich figures of
copper gilt melted down. James II. repaired this building, and em∣ployed
Verrio to paint it, intending it for a popish chapel—but no de∣stination
of it has yet succeeded; it remains a ruin, known by the name

<P>IT is unlucky for the world, that our earliest ancestors were not
aware of the curiosity which would inspire their descendents of
knowing minutely every thing relating to them. When they
placed three or four branches of trees across the trunks of others and
covered them with boughs or straw to keep out the weather, the good
people were not apprized that they were discovering architecture, and
that it would be learnedly agitated some thousand of years afterwards
who was the inventor of this stupendous science. In complaisance to
our inquiries they would undoubtedly have transmitted an account of
the first hovel that was ever built, and from that patriarch hut we should
possess a faithfull genealogy of all it's descendents: Yet such a curiosity
would destroy much greater treasures; it would annihilate fables,
researches, conjectures, hypotheses, disputes, blunders and dissertations,
that library of human impertinence. Necessity and a little common
sense produced all the common arts, which the plain folks who prac∣ticed
them were not idle enough to record. Their inventions were
obvious, their productions usefull and clumsy. Yet the little merit
<PB N="113" REF="135"/>
there was in fabricating them being soon consigned to oblivion, we are
bountifull enough to suppose that there was design and system in all
they did, and then take infinite pains to digest and methodize those
imaginary rudiments. No sooner is any aera of an invention invented,
but different countries begin to assert an exclusive title to it, and the
only point in which any countries agree is perhaps in ascribing the dis∣covery
to some other nation remote enough in time for neither of them
to know any thing of it. Let but France and England once dispute
which first used a hatchet, and they shall never be accorded 'till the
chancery of learning accommodates the matter by pronouncing that
each received that invaluable utensil from the Phoenicians. Common
sense that would interpose by observing how probable it is that the ne∣cessaries
of life were equally discovered in every region, cannot be
heard; a hammer could only be invented by the Phoenicians, the first
polished people of whom we are totally ignorant. Whoever has thrown
away his time on the first chapters of general histories, or of histories
of arts, must be sensible that these reflections are but too well ground∣ed.
I design them as an apology for not going very far back into the
history of our architecture. Vertue and several other curious persons
have taken great pains to enlighten the obscure ages of that science;
they find no names of architects, nay little more, than what they might
have known without inquiring; that our ancestors had buildings.
Indeed Tom Hearne, Brown Willis, and such illustrators did sometimes
go upon more positive ground: They did now and then stumble up∣on
an arch, a tower, nay a whole church, so dark, so ugly, so uncouth,
that they were sure it could not have been built since any idea of grace
had been transported into the island. Yet with this incontestable secu∣rity
on their side, they still had room for doubting; Danes, Saxons,
<PB N="114" REF="136"/>
Normans, were all ignorant enough to have claims to peculiar ugliness
in their fashions. It was difficult to ascertain the period<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When men inquire, “who invented Gothic buildings?” they might as well ask, “who invented bad Latin?” The former was a corruption of the Roman architecture, as the latter was of the Roman language. Both were debased in bar∣barous ages; both were refined, as the age polished itself; but neither were re∣stored to the original standard. Beautifull Gothic architecture was engra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted on Saxon deformity; and pure Italian succeeded to vitiated Latin.</NOTE> when one
ungracious form jostled out another: and this perplexity at last led
them into such refinement, that the term <HI>Gothic Architecture,</HI> inflicted
as a reproach on our ancient buildings in general by our ancestors who
revived the Grecian taste, is now considered but as a species of modern
elegance, by those who wish to distinguish the Saxon style from it.
This Saxon style begins to be defined by flat and round arches, by
some undulating zigzags on certain old fabrics, and by a very few other
characteristics, all evidences of barbarous and ignorant times. I do not
mean to say simply that the round arch is a proof of ignorance; but
being so natural, it is simply, when unaccompanied by any gracefull
ornaments, a mark of a rude age—if attended by mishapen and heavy
decorations, a certain mark of it. The pointed arch, that peculiar of
Gothic architecture, was certainly intended as an improvement on the
circular, and the men who had not the happiness of lighting on the sim∣plicity
and proportion of the Greek orders, were however so lucky as
to strike out a thousand graces and effects, which rendered their build∣ings
magnificent, yet genteel, vast, yet light,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For instance, the facade of the cathedral of Rheims.</NOTE> venerable and pictu∣resque.
It is difficult for the noblest Grecian temple to convey half so
many impressions to the mind, as a cathedral does of the best Gothic
taste—a proof of skill in the architects and of address in the priests
<PB N="115" REF="137"/>
who erected them. The latter exhausted their knowledge of the pas∣sions
in composing edifices whose pomp, mechanism, vaults, tombs,
painted windows, gloom and perspectives infused such sensations of ro∣mantic
devotion; and they were happy in finding artists capable of
executing such machinery. One must have taste to be sensible of the
beauties of Grecian architecture; one only wants passions to feel
Gothic. In St. Peter's one is convinced that it was built by great
princes—In Westminster-abbey, one thinks not of the builder; the
religion of the place makes the first impression—and though stripped
of it's altars and shrines, it is nearer converting one to popery than all
the regular pageantry of Roman domes. Gothic churches infuse su∣perstition;
Grecian, admiration. The papal see amassed it's wealth by
Gothic cathedrals, and displays it in Grecian temples.</P>
<P>I certainly do not mean by this little contrast to make any compari∣son
between the rational beauties of regular architecture, and the unre∣strained
licentiousness of that which is called Gothic. Yet I am clear
that the persons who executed the latter, had much more knowledge
of their art, more taste, more genius, and more propriety than we
chuse to imagine. There is a magic hardiness in the execution of some
of their works which would not have sustained themselves if dictated by
mere caprice. There is a tradition that Sir Christopher Wren went
once a year to survey the roof of the chapel of King's college, and said
that if any man would show him where to place the first stone, he
would engage to build such another. That there is great grace in se∣veral
places, even in their clusters of slender pillars, and in the appli∣cation
of their ornaments, though the principles of the latter are so
confined that they may almost all be reduced to the trefoil, extended
<PB N="116" REF="138"/>
and varied, I shall not appeal to the edifices themselves—It is sufficient
to observe, that Inigo Jones, Sir Christopher Wren and Kent, who cer∣tainly
understood beauty, blundered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Lincoln's-inn chapel, the steeple of the church at Warwick, the king's-bench in Westminster-hall, the screen at Gloucester &amp;c.</NOTE> into the heaviest and clumsiest
compositions whenever they aimed at imitations of the Gothic—Is an
art despicable in which a great master cannot shine?</P>
<P>Considering how scrupulously our architects confine themselves to
antique precedent, perhaps some deviations into Gothic may a little re∣lieve
them from that servile imitation. I mean that they should study
both tastes, not blend them: that they should dare to invent in the one,
since they will hazard nothing in the other. When they have built a
pediment and portico, the Sibyll's circular temple, and tacked the wings
to a house by a colonade, they seem <HI>au bout de leur Latin.</HI> If half a
dozen mansions were all that remained of old Rome, instead of half a
dozen temples, I do not doubt but our churches would resemble the
private houses of Roman citizens. Our buildings must be as Vitru∣vian,
as writings in the days of Erasmus were obliged to be Ciceronian.
Yet confined as our architects are to few models, they are far from
having made all the use they might of those they possess. There are
variations enough to be struck out to furnish new scenes of singular
beauty. The application of loggias, arcades, terrasses and flights of
steps, at different stages of a building, particularly in such situations as
Whitehall to the river, would have a magnificent effect. It is true, our
climate and the expence of building in England are great restrictions
on imagination; but when one talks of the extent of which architec∣ture
is capable, one must suppose that pomp and beauty are the prin∣cipal
objects; one speaks of palaces and public buildings; not of shops
<PB N="117" REF="139"/>
and small houses—but I must restrain this dissertation, and come to
the historic part, which will lie in a small compass.</P>
<P>Felibien took great pains to ascertain the revival of architecture, af∣ter
the destruction of the true taste by the inundation of the northern
nations; but his discoveries were by no means answerable to his labour.
Of French builders he did find a few names, and here and there an
Italian or German. Of English he owns he did not meet with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he least
trace; while at the same time the founders of ancient buildings were
every where recorded: so carefull have the monks (the only historians
of those times) been to celebrate bigotry and pass over the arts. But I
own I take it for granted that these seeming omissions are to be attri∣buted
to their want of perspicuity rather than to neglect. As all the
other arts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The arts flourished so much in convents to the last, that one Gyffard, a visitor employed by Thomas Cromwell to make a report of the state of those societie previous to their suppression, pleads in behalf of the house of Wolstrop, “That there was not one religious person there, but that he could and did use, either embrotheryng, writing books with very fair hand, making their own garments, <HI>carving, painting, graffing.</HI>” Strype's memor. vol. i. p. 255.</NOTE> were confined to cloysters, so undoubtedly was architecture
too; and when we read that such a bishop or such an abbot built such
and such an edifice, I am persuaded that they often gave the plans as
well as furnished the necessary funds; but as those chroniclers scarce ever
specify when this was or was not the case, we must not at this distance
of time pretend to conjecture what prelates were or were not capable
of directing their own foundations.</P>
<P>Felibien is so impartial an author, that he does not even reject the
fables with which our own writers have replenished the chasms in our
history. He quotes Matthew of Westminster for the flourishing con∣dition
<PB N="118" REF="140"/>
of architecture in Britain at a time when indeed neither that nor
any other science flourished here—King Arthur, say they,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Felib. vol. v. p. 165.</NOTE> caused
many churches and considerable edifices to be erected here. It would
in truth have been an act of injustice to us to omit this vision, in a man
who on the authority of Agathias, relates that the emperor Justinian
had in his service one Anthemius, so able a <HI>mathematician</HI> that he could
make artificial earthquakes, and actually did revenge himself by such
an experiment on one Zeno a rhetorician. The machinery was ex∣tremely
simple, and yet I question whether the greatest mathematician
of this age is expert enough to produce the same effect; it consisted in
nothing but placing several caldrons of hot water against the walls of
Zeno's house. The same author has cited Procopius for the origine
of dams to restrain the course of rivers, the method of whose construc∣tion
was revealed to Chryses, an architect of Alexandria, in a dream.
Dreams, lies, and absurdities are all one finds in searching into early
times. In a scarcity of facts probability was the last thing to which
such authors attended, and consequently they left a mark by which, if
we pleased, we might distinguish between the truth and what they
invented.</P>
<P>In Felibien<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Felib. p. 185.</NOTE> the only thing I find to my purpose, and all that he
really found in Matthew of Westminster, is, that in the kingdom of the
Mercians Sexulphus, abbot and afterwards bishop, built a considerable
monastery called<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Peterborough.</NOTE> Medes Hampstede: Unless it may be a satisfaction

Pope Innocent III. Indeed I speak now critically; Marchion used
those grinning animals only to support columns—but in so fantastic
an age they were sure of being copied, and soon arrived at the top.</P>
<P>Vertue, no less industrious than Felibien, could discover but two
ancient architects, Gundulphus who built the tower<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the compact between the king and bishop in the Textus Roffensis, pub∣lished by Hearne; and that between the same bishop and William Rufus for erect∣ing the castle of Rochester. cap. 88. and Stowe's Survey of London.</NOTE> (the same person

But the brightest name in this list is William of Wykeham, who
from being clerk of the works rose to be bishop of Winchester and
lord chancellor—a height which few men have reached by mere merit
in any mechanic science. Wykeham had the sole direction of the
buildings at Windsor and Queenborough-castle; not to mention his
own foundations. He rose by pleasing one of the greatest princes, and
deserved his fortune by bestowing it on noble charities.</P>
<P>William Rede bishop of Chichester in 1369, reckoned the best ma∣thematician
of the age, was a prelate of similar taste; he built the first
library at Merton college, and the castle of Amberley.</P>
<P>In St. Michael's church at St. Alban's were the following inscrip∣tions:</P>
<P>“Hic jacet Thomas Wolvey [or Wolven] Latomus in arte, nec

Angliae, qui obiit Anno Dom. M, cccc, xxx. in vigilià Sti. Thomae
Martyris, cujus animae propitietur Deus. Amen.”</P>
<P>“This man, as far as I understand by this inscription [says Weaver,
p. 582.] was the master-mason, or surveior of the king's stone-works,
as also esquire to the king's person.”</P>
<P>“Hic jacet Richardus Wolven [or Wolvey] Lathonius, filius Jo∣hannis

<P>I have myself turned over most of our histories of churches, and can
find nothing like the names of artists. With respect to the builders of
Gothic, it is a real loss: there is beauty, genius and invention enough
in their works to make one wish to know the authors. I will say no more
<PB N="121" REF="143"/>
on this subject, than that, on considering and comparing it's progress,
the delicacy, lightness and taste of it's ornaments, it seems to have been
at it's perfection about the reign of Henry IV. as may be seen particu∣lary
by the tombs of the archbishops at Canterbury. That cathedral
I should recommend preferably to Westminster to those who would
borrow ornaments in that stile. The fretwork in the small oratories at
Winchester, and the part behind the choir at Glocester would furnish
beautifull models. The windows in several cathedrals offer gracefull
patterns; for airy towers of almost filigraine we have none to be com∣pared
with those of Rheims.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some instances of particular beauty, whose constructions date at different aeras from what I have mentioned, have been pointed out to me by a gentleman to whose taste I readily yield; such as the nave of the minster at York (in the great and simple style) and the choir of the same church (in the rich and filigraine work∣manship) both of the reign of Edward III. The Lady-chapel (now Trinity-church) at Ely, and the Lantern-tower in the same cathedral, noble works of the same time: and the chapel of bishop West (also at Ely) who died in 1533, for exquisite art in the lesser style. These notices certainly can add no honour to a name already so distinguished as Mr. Gray's; it is my own gratitude or vanity that prompts me to name him; and I must add, that if some parts of this work are more accurate than my own ignorance or carelessness would have left them, the reader and I are obliged to the same gentleman, who condescended to correct, what he never could have descended to write.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is certain that the Gothic taste remained in vogue 'till towards
the end of the reign of Henry VIII. His father's chapel at Westmin∣ster
is entirely of that manner. So is Wol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey's tomb-house at Windsor
But soon after the Grecian style was introduced; and no wonder when
so many Italians were entertained in the king's service. They had seen
that architecture revived in their own country in all it's purity—but
<PB N="122" REF="144"/>
whether they were not perfectly masters of it, or that it was necessary
to introduce the innovation by degrees, it certainly did not at first ob∣tain
full possession. It was plaistered upon Gothic, and made a barba∣rous
mixture. Regular columns, with ornaments, neither Grecian nor
Gothic, and half embroidered with foliage, were crammed over fron∣tispieces,
facades and chimnies, and lost all grace by wanting simplici∣ty.
This mungrel species lasted 'till late in the reign of James the first.</P>
<P>The beginning of reformation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brunelleschi began to reform architecture in the fourteenth century. See Voltaire. Hist. Univ. vol. ii. p. 179.</NOTE> in building seems owing to Hol∣bein.
His porch at Wilton, though purer than the works of his suc∣cessors,
is of this bastard sort; but the ornaments and proportions are
gracefull and well chosen. I have seen of his drawings too in the
same kind. Where he acquired this taste is difficult to say; probably
it was adopted from his acquaintance with his fellow-labourers at court.
Henry had actually an Italian architect in his service, to whom I should
without scruple assign the introduction of regular architecture, if it was
clear that he arrived here near so early as Holbein. He was called
John of Padua, and his very office seems to intimate something novel
in his practice. He was termed <HI>Devizor of his majesty's buildings.</HI> In
one of the office-books which I have quoted, there is a payment to

<P>This grant was renewed to him in the third of Edward VI. From

of the pioneers in Scotland. Henry gave him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chauncy's Hertfordshire, p. 461, where he is called Sir Richard à Leigh.</NOTE> the manor of Sopewell
in Hertfordshire, and he himself bestowed a brazen font on the church
of Verulam, or St. Alban's, within a mile of which place out of the
ruins of the abbey he built a seat called Lees-place. The font was
taken in the Scottish wars, and had served for the christening of the
royal children of that kingdom. A pompous inscription<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See it in Camden's Britannia p. 355. vol. i. edit. 1722.</NOTE> was engrav∣ed

<P>UNDER a minor prince, and amidst a struggle of religions, we
are not likely to meet with much account of the arts. No∣body
was at leisure to mind or record them. Yet the seeds
sown by Henry were not eradicated; Holbein was still alive. We have
seen that he was chosen to celebrate the institution of Bridewell. He
drew the young king more than once after he came to the crown.</P>
<P>Among the stores of old pictures at Somerset-house was one, paint∣ed
on a long board, representing the head of Edward VI. to be discern∣ed
only by the reflection of a cylindric mirrour. On the side of the
head was a landscape, not ill done. On the frame was written Guiliel∣mus
pinxit. This was probably
<Q>MARC WILLEMS,</Q>
Who was born at Antwerp about 1527, and was scholar of Michael
Coxie. He was reckoned to surpass his cotemporaries in his manner
and facility of composing. This picture is the sole evidence of his
having been in England: in his own country he painted the decolla∣tion
<PB N="126" REF="148" MS="y"/>
of St. John, still extant in the church of St. Rombout, for which
too he drew the story of Judith and Holofernes. When Philip II.
made his public entry into Mechlin in 1549, Willems was employed
to paint a triumphal arch, on which he represented the history of
Dido. He made designs for most of the painters, glass-painters and
arras-makers of his time, and died lamented in 1561.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Descamps and Sandrart.</NOTE></P>
<P>Another picture of Edward VI. was in the collection of Charles I.
painted by Hans Hueet, of whom nothing else is known. It was sold
for 20<HI>l.</HI> in the Civil War.</P>
<P>There was another painter who lived at this time, of whom Vertue
found an account in a MS. of Nicholas Hilliard, but never discovered
any of his works. As this person is so much commended by a brother
artist, one may believe he had merit, and as the testimony may lead to
farther investigation, I shall give the extract in the author's own words;</P>
<P>“Nevertheless, if a man be so induced by nature, and live in time
of trouble and under a government wherein arts be not esteemed, and
himself but of small means, woe be unto him, as unto an untimely
birth; for of my own knowledge, it hath made poor men poorer, as
amongst others many, that most rare English drawer of story works
in black and white.
<Q>JOHN BOSSAM.</Q>

therefore for the most part in white and black; and growing yet poorer
by charge of children, &amp;c. gave painting clean over: but being a very

<P>The protector was magnificent, and had he lived to compleat Somer∣set-house,
would probably have called in the assistance of those artists
whose works are the noblest furniture. I have already mentioned his
portrait by Holbein. His ambitious duchess Anne Stanhope and her
son are preserved in a small piece<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is a head of her too at Sion, and Mr. Bateman has given me another in small, with a portrait of the protector in her hand; painted probably after his death.</NOTE> of oil-colours at Petworth, but I
know not who the painter was, nor of the portrait of the protector's
brother, admiral Seymour, at Longleat. A miniature of the same per∣son
is in the possession of Mrs. George Grenville. Of the admiral's
creature Sir William Sherrington there are two or three pictures ex∣tant;
one, among Holbein's drawings at Kensington. This man was
master of the mint, and was convicted by his own confession of great
frauds.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype's memorials vol. ii. p. 123.</NOTE> He put the mint of Bristol into the hands of the admiral, who

Yet Sherrington was pardoned and restored. It has never been ob∣served,
but I suppose the lightness which is remarked in the coins of
Edward VI. was owing to the embezzlements of this person.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="150"/>
Now I am mentioning the mint, I shall take notice that among the
patent-rolls is a grant in the 6th of Edward to Antony Deric of the
office of capital sculptor of the monies in the tower of London; and at
the end of the same year John Brown is appointed during pleasure sur∣veyor
of the coins. Clement Adams has a grant to instruct the king's
henchmen or pages; an office he retained under queen Elizabeth.

<P>Of the protector's rival, Dudley duke of Northumberland, there is
a good head in the chamber at Knowle, where there are so many cu∣rious
portraits, supposed to have been assembled by the treasurer Buck∣hurst.</P>
<P>Another person of some note in this reign was Sir John Godsalve,
created knight of the carpet at the king's coronation;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Strype.</NOTE> and commis∣sioner
of visitation the same year;<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heylin.</NOTE> and in the third year comptroller
of the mint. His portrait is in the closet at Kensington, and Vertue
mentions another in miniature, drawn by John Betts,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vertue says that Betts learned of Hilliard.</NOTE> (who he says
was an esteemed painter in the reign of queen Elizabeth) On this pic∣ture
was written, captum in castris ad Boloniam 1540; with his arms,
party per pale gules and azure, on a fess wavy argent, between three
croslets pattee, or, as many crescents sable. The knight was drawn
with a spear and shield. This picture belonged to Christopher God∣salve,
clerk of the victualling-office in the reign of Charles I. in whose
<PB N="129" REF="151"/>
cause he lost 7000<HI>l.</HI> and was near being hanged. He was employed
by Charles II. in the navy-office and lived to 1694.</P>
<P>Guillim Stretes was painter to king Edward; in 1551 “He had
paid him, says Strype,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 494.</NOTE> fifty marks for recompence of three great ta∣bles
made by the said Guillim, whereof two were the pictures of his
highness, sent to Sir Thomas Hoby, and Sir John Mason (ambassadors
abroad) the third a picture of the late earl of Surrey attainted, and by
the council's commandment fetched from the said Guillim's house.”
The peculiarity of these last words induce me to think that I have dis∣covered
this very picture. In my father's collection was a very large
piece representing that unfortunate lord, at whole length, leaning on
a broken column, with this motto, Sat superest, and other devices,
particularly the arms of England, one of the articles of his impeach∣ment,
and only the initial letters of his name. This was evidently
painted after his death, and as his father was still detained in prison du∣ring
the whole reign of Edward, it cannot be probable that a portrait
of the son, with such marks of honour, should be drawn by order of the
court. On the contrary, it's <HI>being fetched from Guillim's house by the
council's commandment,</HI> seems to imply that it was seized by their order.
It is now in the possession of his grace the duke of Norfolk.</P>
<P>Architecture preserved in this reign the footing it had acquired un∣der
the last king. Somerset-house is a compound of Grecian and
Gothic. It was built on the scite of Chester inn, where the ancient
poet Occleve formerly lived. As the pension to John of Padua was
renewed in the third of this king, one may suppose that he owed it to
the protector, and was the architect of his palace. In the same style
and dating it's origine from the same power, as Somerset-house, is
<PB N="130" REF="152"/>
Longleat, though not begun 'till 1567. It was built by Sir John
Thynne, a principal officer to the protector.</P>
<P>1553.</P>
<P>The reign of Mary, though shorter even than that of her brother,
makes a much more considerable figure in the annals of painting. It
was distinguished by more good painters than one; the principal was
<Q>Sir ANTONIO MORE.</Q>
He was a native of Utrecht, and scholar of John Schorel,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schorel was scholar of Mabuse, and was a poet, musician and orator. See an account of him in Sandrart, p. 235.</NOTE> but seems
to have studied the manner of Holbein, to which he approached nearer
than to the freedom of design in the works of the great masters, that
he saw at Rome. Like Holbein he was a close imitator of nature, but
did not arrive at his extreme delicacy of finishing; on the contrary,
Antonio sometimes struck into a bold and masculine style, with a good
knowledge of the Chiaro Scuro. In 1522 he drew Philip II. and was
recommended by cardinal Granvelle to Charles V. who sent him to
Portugal, where he painted John III. the king, Catherine of Austria
his queen, and the infanta Mary, first wife of Philip. For these three
pictures he received six hundred ducats, besides a gold chain of one
thousand florins, and other presents. He had one hundred ducats<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Titian himself had but one hundred pieces of gold. See Sandrart, p. 224.</NOTE> for
his common portraits. But still ampler rewards were bestowed on him
when sent into England, to draw the picture of queen Mary,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sandrart says she was very handsome. It is certain that the drawing of her (when about sixteen) by Holbein at Kensington is not disagreable, though her later pictures have all a stern hard-favoured countenance.</NOTE> the in∣tended

bride of Philip. They gave him one hundred pounds, a gold
chain, and a pension of one hundred pounds a quarter as painter to
their majesties. He made various portraits of the queen;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In king Charles's collection was a miniature in oil of this queen by Antonio More, painted on a round gold plate, in blue flowered velvet and gold tissue with sleeves of fur, two red roses and a pair of gloves in her hand; the very same dress of her picture at the duke of Bedford's at Woburn. The miniature was a present to the king from the earl of Suffolk.</NOTE> one was
sent by cardinal Granvelle to the emperor, who ordered two hundred
florins to Antonio. He remained in England during the reign of
Mary, and was much employed, but having neglected, as is frequent,
to write the names on the portraits he drew, most of them have lost
part of their value, by our ignorance of the persons represented. The
poorest performers have it in their power to add so much merit to their
works, as can be conferred by identifying the subjects, which would
be a little reparation to the curious world, though some families should
miss imaginary ancestors.</P>
<P>On the death of the queen, More followed Philip [and probably
his religion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He was suspected by the inquisition of making use of his interest with the king in favour of his countrymen, says Sandrart. This might be meant either of their religious or political principles. But sure the inquisitors knew Philip too well to be apprehensive of his listening to any insinuations of tenderness on either head.</NOTE>] into Spain, where he was indulged in so much familia∣rity,
that one day the king slapping him pretty roughly on the
shoulder, More returned the sport with his handstick: A strange li∣berty
to be taken with a Spanish monarch, and with such a monarch!
His biographer gives but an awkward account of the sequel; and I
<PB N="132" REF="155"/>
repeat it as I find it. A grandeè interposed for his pardon, and he was
permitted to retire to the Netherlands, but under promise of returning
again to Spain. I should rather suppose that he was promised to have
leave to return thither, after a temporary banishment; and this suppo∣sition
is the more likely, as Philip, for once forgetting majesty in his
love of the arts, dispatched a messenger to recall him, before he had
finished his journey. But the painter sensible of the danger he had
escaped, modestly excused himself: and yet, says the story, the king
bestowed noble presents and places on his children. At Utrecht An∣tonio
found the duke of Alva, and was employed by him to draw se∣veral
of his mistresses, and was made receiver of the revenues of West-Flanders;
a preferment, with which, they say, he was so elated, that
he burned his easel, and gave away his painting tools.</P>
<P>More was a man of a stately and handsome presence; and often went
to Brussels, where he lived magnificently. He died at Antwerp in
1575 in the 56th year of his age.</P>
<P>His portrait, painted by himself, is in the chamber of painters at
Florence, with which the great duke, who bought it, was so pleased,
that he ordered a cartel with some Greek verses, written by Antonio
Maria Salvini, his Greek professor, to be affixed to the frame. Salvini
translated them into Italian and into the following Latin,
<Q><L>Papae! est imago cujus,</L>
<L>Qui Zeuxin atque Apellem,</L>
<L>Veterumque quot fuere,</L>
<L>Recentiumque quot sunt,</L>

<P>Another picture of himself, and one of his wife, were in the collec∣tion
of Sir Peter Lely. More's was three feet eight inches high, by
two feet nine wide. King Charles had five pictures painted by this
master; and the duke of Buckingham had a portrait of a man by
him. See his catalogue p. 18. A print of him in profile was publisbed
by Hondius, and a medal struck of him in Italy with this legend, Ant.
More, pictor transmontanus. At what time or where he was knighted
is uncertain. He painted his master John Schorel in 1560. Several
of his works are or were at Sir Philip Sydenham's at Brympton in So∣mersetshire.
A very good portrait of Sir Thomas Gresham is at
Houghton. I have a miniature by him, called Thomas duke of
Norfolk, engraved among the illustrious heads: it belonged to Rich∣ardson
the painter, and came out of the Arundelian collection; and a
half length of a lady in black with a gold chain about her waste, which
is mentioned in the catalogue of pictures of James II. and by that of
Charles I. appears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 108. No. 7.</NOTE> to be Margaret of Valois, sister of Henry II. of
France, and duchess of Savoy, at the tournament for whose wedding
that monarch was killed. Lady Elizabeth Germayn has the portrait
of Anne daughter of Francis earl of Bedford and wife of Ambrose
earl of Warwick.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="157"/>
At Newstede abbey in Nottinghamshire, the beautifull seat of the
lord Byron, where are the most perfect remains of an ancient convent,
is an admirable portrait, painted as I believe by this master, and wor∣thy
of Holbein. It is a half length of a fat man with a beard, on a
light greenish ground. His arms are, three roses, the middle one
highest, on a field argent; in base, something like a green hill: These
arms are repeated on his ring, and over them, J. N. aet. 1557. As
this bearing is evidently foreign, I suppose the portrait represents one
of the family of Numigen. Nicholas Byron married Sophia, daughter
of Lambert Charles of Numigen.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thoroton's Nottinghamshire, p. 261.</NOTE></P>
<P>But More did not always confine himself to portraits. He painted
several historic pieces, particularly one much esteemed of the resurrec∣tion
of Christ with two angels; and another of Peter and Paul. A
painter, who afterwards sold it to the prince of Condè, got a great
deal of money by showing it at the foire St. Germain.</P>
<P>He made a fine copy of Titian's Danae for the king; and left un∣finished
the Circumcision, designed for the altar in the church of our
Lady at Antwerp.</P>
<P>In the catalogue of pictures at the palais royal is a portrait said to
be of Grotius by Antonio More, who was dead above twenty years
before Grotius was born.</P>
<P>Another performer in this reign was
<Q>JOAS VAN CLEEVE,</Q>
Or Sotto Cleefe, an industrious painter of Antwerp: his colouring was
good, and his figures fleshy and round; but before he arrieved at the
<PB REF="158"/>
<FIGURE>

<PB N="135" REF="159"/>
perfection he might have attained, his head was turned with vanity; a
misfortune not uncommon to the profession, who living secluded from
the world and seeing little but their own creation rising around them,
grow intoxicated with the magic of their own performances. Cleeve
came to England, expecting great prices for his pictures from king
Philip, who was making a collection, but unluckily, some of the works
of Titian arrived at the same time. Cleeve begged the recommenda∣tion
of Sir Antonio More, his countryman; but Philip was too much
charmed with the beauties of the Venetian master, and overlooked the
labours of the Fleming. This neglect compleated his frenzy, the storm
of which first vented itself on Sir Antonio. Cleeve abused him, un∣dervaluing
his works, and bidding him return to Utrecht and keep his
wife from the canons. At last the poor man grew quite frantic,
painted his own cloaths, and spoiled his own pictures, 'till they were
obliged to confine him, in which wretched condition he probably died.
He had a son that followed his profession, and was, it is said, no des∣picable
performer.</P>
<P>Of Joas there is a print with this legend, vivebat Antwerpiae in pa∣triâ
1544. Another inscribed, Justo Clivensi, Antwerpiano pictori.
The original painted by himself with a black cap and furred gown,
upon a greenish ground, and a portrait of his wife, were purchased by

a man, and Sir Peter Lely a bacchanalian two feet one inch wide, by
three feet four inches high.</P>
<P>Vertue found grants in this reign to another painter, who, it seems,
had been in the service too of Henry and Edward. His name was
<HI>Nicholas Lysard;</HI> he had a pension for life of ten pounds a year, and
the same fee charged on the customs, as had been granted to the
serjeant-painters John Brown and Andrew Wright—Of Lysard I find
no farther mention, but that in a roll of queen Elizabeth's new-years
gifts he presents her with a table painted of the history of Ahasuerus,
and her majesty gives him one gilt creuse and cover. This was in the
first year of her reign. He died in her service 1570. In the register
of St. Martin's is this entry, “April 5, buried Nicholas Lyzard ser∣jeant-painter
unto the queen's majestie.”</P>
<P>There was in this reign another person too illustrious a lover and
even practicer of the art to be omitted, though I find no mention of
him in Vertue's MSS. This was
<Q>EDWARD COURTENEY,</Q>

years old; and from that time to thirty when he died, he scarce
enjoyed two years of liberty. It was a happiness peculiar to him
to be able to amuse himself with drawing,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My authority is Strype, who produces undoubted authority for his assertion, having given us the oration pronounced at his funeral by Sir Thomas Wilson, afterwards Secretary of State. Besides his progress in philosophy, mathematics, music, and the French, Spanish and Italian languages, Sir Thomas adds, “Tanta etiam expingendarum effigierum cupiditate ardebat, ut facile et laudabiliter cu∣juscumque imaginem in tabula exprimeret.” See Strype's memorials vol. iii. p. 339, and appendix p. 192.</NOTE> in an age in which
there were so many prisoners and so few resources, and it gives
one very favorable ideas of his being naturally accomplished, of
a spirit not easily to be depressed, when we find that queen
Mary no sooner delivered him from his captivity than she wished
to marry him; and that he, conscious of his great blood and yet
void of interested ambition, declined a crown, and preferred the
younger sister, the princess Elizabeth. For this partiality, and on
the rising of the Carews in Devonshire who were flattered with
the hopes of this match, the princess and he were committed to
the tower, and accused by Wyat as his accomplices. Our historians<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Holinshead, Heylin, and Burnet.</NOTE>
all reject this accusation, and declare that Wyat cleared him at his
death; and indeed the earl's gratitude would not have been very shi∣ning,
had he plotted to dethrone a princess who had delivered him
from a prison and offered him a throne. The English, who could
not avoid feeling partiality to this young prince, were pleased with
king Philip, to whose intercession they ascribed the second release of

the earl, as well as the safety of the lady Elizabeth. Courteney asked
leave to travel, and died at Padua, not without suspicion of poison,
which seems more probable than those rumours generally are, as
he was suspected of being a Lutheran and as his epitaph,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See it at length in the genealogical history of the noble house of Courtenay by Edward Cleaveland, fol. 1735, p. 261.</NOTE> written in
defence of the Spaniards, formally declares that he owed his death to
affecting the kingdom, and to his ambition of marrying the queen;
the last of which assertions at least is a falshood, and might be a blun∣der,
confounding the queen and princess. After his death one Cley∣bery
was executed for pretending to be this earl, and thence endea∣vouring
to raise commotions.</P>
<P>There is a very good portrait of him at the duke of Bedford's at

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Painters in the Reign of Queen ELIZABETH.</HEAD>
<P>THE long and remarkable reign of this Princess could not but
furnish many opportunities to artists of signalizing themselves.
There is no evidence that Elizabeth had much taste for
painting; but she loved pictures of herself. In them she could appear
really handsome; and yet to do the profession justice, they seem to
have flattered her the least of all her dependents: There is not a
single portrait of her that one can call beautifull. The profusion of
ornaments with which they are loaded, are marks of her continual
fondness for dress, while they entirely exclude all grace, and leave no
more room for a painter's genius than if he had been employed to
copy an Indian idol, totally composed of hands and necklaces. A pale
Roman nose, a head of hair loaded with crowns and powdered with
diamonds, a vast ruff, a vaster fardingale and a bushell of pearls are
the features by which every body knows at once the pictures of queen
Elizabeth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is observable that her majesty thought enormity of dress a royal prerogative, for on the 12th of February 1579, an order was made in the Star-chamber, “that no person should use or wear excessive long cloaks (this might proceed from ap∣prehension of their concealing arms under them) as of late be used, and before two years past hath not been used in this realm; no persons to wear such great ruffes about their necks; to be left off such monstrous undecent attyring.” Also another against wearing any sword rapier, that shall passe the length of one yard and half a quarter in the blade, nor dagger above twelve inches in the blade at most. In her father's time, who dictated in every thing from religion to fashions, an act of parliament was passed in his twenty-fourth year against inordinate use of apparel, directing that no one should wear on his apparel any cloth of gold, silver or tinsel, satyn, silk, or cloth mixed with gold or silver, any sables, velvet, furrs, embroidery, velvet in gowns or outermost garments, EXCEPT PERSONS OF DI∣STINCTION, dukes, marquisses, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arls, barons and knights of the order, barons' sons, knights or such that may dispend 250<HI>l.</HI> per ann. This act was renewed in the second of Elizabeth. Edward VI. carried this restraint still farther: In heads of a bill drawn up with his own hand 1551, (though it never passed into a law) no one, who had less than 100<HI>l.</HI> a year for life, or gentlemen, the king's sworn ser∣vants, was to wear satten, damask, ostrich-feathers, or furs of conies; none not worth 200<HI>l.</HI> or 20<HI>l.</HI> in living certain, to wear chamblet: no serving man, under the degree of a gentleman, to wear any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur, save lamb; nor cloth above ten shil∣ling the yard.</NOTE> Besides many of her majesty, we are so lucky as to possess
the portraits of almost all the great men of her reign, and though the
<PB N="140" REF="165"/>
generality of painters at that time were not equal to the subjects on
which they were employed, yet they were close imitators of nature, and
have perhaps transmitted more faithfull representations, than we could
have expected from men of brighter imagination. The first painter
who seems to have made any figure in this reign, was
<Q>LUCAS DE HEERE;</Q>
Born at G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent in 1534, of a family peculiarly addicted to the arts.
John his father was a good statuary and architect: Anne Smitter his
<PB N="141" REF="166"/>
mother painted in miniature, and with such diminutive neatness, that
she executed a landscape with a windmill, millers, a cart and horse and
passengers; and half a grain of corn would cover the whole composi∣tion.
The father went often to Namur and Dinant, where the son
copied ruins and castles; but he soon learned of a better master, Fran∣cis
Floris, under whom Lucas improved much, and drew many designs
(which passed for his master's) for tapestry and glass-painters. From
Ghent he went to France and was employed by the queen and queen-mother
in making drawings for tapestry; and residing some time at
Fontainbleau, where he married Eleanor Carboniere, he contracted a
taste for the antique by seeing the statues there, an inclination he show∣ed
less by his own works, than by making a collection of bronzes and
medals. He returned to Ghent, where he drew the Count de Vaken,
his lady and their jester, and painted two or three churches; in St. Pe∣ter's,
the shutters of an altar piece, in which he represented the Lord's
Supper, much admired for the draperies of the apostles. In St. John's
church he painted an altar-piece of the Resurrection, and on the doors
of it, Christ and the disciples at Emaus, and his apparition in the
garden.</P>
<P>Lucas was not only a painter, but a poet: He wrote the Orchard of
Poesie; and translated from the French of Marot, the Temple of Cu∣pid
and other pieces. He had begun the lives of the Flemish painters
in verse. Carl Vermander his scholar, who has given the lives of those
masters, learned many anecdotes of our English painters from Lucas.</P>
<P>At what time the latter arrived in England is not certain: nor were
his works at all known here, 'till the indefatigable industry of Mr.
Vertue discovered several of them.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="167"/>
1. The first of these was a portrait of Sir William Sidney, grand∣father
of Sir Philip; but as Sir William died in 1553 at the age of 72,
when Lucas de Heere was but nineteen, it is not probable that Sir
William was abroad after that young man was in repute enough to
draw his picture; and it is less probable that he had been in France,
had married and arrived here by the age of nineteen. This picture
which Vertue found at Penshurst, was in all likelyhood a copy.</P>
<P>2. The next was a portrait of Henry lord Maltravers eldest son of
Henry Fitzalan earl of Arundel, dated 1557, the year before the ac∣cession
of queen Elizabeth; but as this young lord died at Brussels,
it is probable that De Heere drew his picture there, and that very ac∣quaintance
might have been a recommendation of Lucas to England.</P>
<P>3. The third is a picture in my possession, well known by the print
Vertue made from it. It contains the portraits of Frances duchess of
Suffolk, mother of lady Jane Grey, and her second husband Adrian
Stoke. Their ages, and De Heere's mark # are on the picture,
which is in perfect preservation, the colouring of the heads clear, and
with great nature, and the draperies which are black with furs and
jewels, highly finished and round, though the manner of the whole is
a little stiff. This picture was in the collection of lord Oxford.
There is a tradition that when this great lady made this second match
with a young fellow who was only master of her horse, queen Eliza∣beth
said, “What! has she married her horse-keeper? Yes, madam,
replied my lord Burleigh, and she says your majesty would like to do
so too.”—Leicester was master of the horse. The date on this picture
is 1559.</P>
<P>4. lord Darnley, husband of Mary queen of Scots, and his brother
<PB N="143" REF="168"/>
Charles Stuart, a boy, afterwards father of the lady Arabella. There
are two of these; one as large as life, in the room going into the king's
closet at St. James's; the other small and neatly finished in the private
apartments below stairs at Hampton-court. The date 1569.</P>
<P>5. The next is a very remarkable picture on board at Kensington:
Queen Elizabeth richly drest, with her crown, scepter, and globe, is
coming out of a palace with two female attendants. Juno, Pallas, and
Minerva seem flying before her; Juno drops her scepter, and Venus
her roses; Cupid flings away his bow and arrows, and clings to his
mother. On the old frame remain these lines, probably written by
the painter himself, who, we have seen, dabled in poetry too;
<Q><L>Juno potens sceptris, et mentis acumine Pallas,</L>
<L>Et roseo Veneris fulget in ore decor;</L>
<L>Adsuit Elizabeth; Juno perculsa refugit;</L>
<L>Obstupuit Pallas, erubuitque Venus.</L></Q></P>
<P>To have compleated the flattery, he should have made Juno or
Venus resemble the queen of Scots, and not so handsome as Elizabeth,
who would not have blushed like the last goddess.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Another curious picture painted about the same time, I know not by what hand, is in the collection of James West, es{que} It represents Henry VIII. sitting under a canopy supported by pillars and delivering the sword to prince Edward. On the right hand of the king stand Philip and Mary; Mars is coming in behind them. Queen Elizabeth, too large in proportion to the rest, stands foreward on the other side, and leads Peace and Plenty, whose faces are said to be portraits of the countesses of Shrewsbury and Salisbury; but the latter must be a mistake in the tradition, for there was no countess of Salisbury at that time. Lady Shrewsbury I suppose was the famous Elizabeth of Hardwicke. Circumscribed in golden letters on the frame are these lines, extremely in the style of the queen's own compo∣sitions;

<P>7. At lord Dacre's at Belhouse in Essex is one of the best works of
this master; it always passed for Holbein's, but Vertue discovered it to
be of De Heere, whose mark is still discernible. It is the portrait of
Mary Neville daughter of George lord Abergavenny, and widow of
Thomas Fienes lord Dacre, executed for an accidental murder in the
reign of Henry VIII. a picture of her husband, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. 22, 1549, copied
from a larger piece, is represented as hanging in the room by his wife.
Her head is finely coloured.</P>
<P>8. The picture from whence Vertue engraved his lady Jane Grey,
he thought, was drawn too by Lucas; but that is liable to the same
objection as his painting Sir William Sidney.</P>
<P>Since the first edition of this work, I have discovered another con∣siderable
work of this master; it is at Longleate, and represents a
<PB N="145" REF="170"/>
whole family. The figures are less than life, and about half lengths.
An elderly gentleman is at table with his wife, and another lady, pro∣bably
from the resemblance, her sister. The first lady has tags of a
particular form, exactly like those on the dress of my duchess of Suf∣folk,
as is the colouring, though not so highly finished; yet the heads
have great nature. Before them are seven young children, their ages
marked, which show that three of them were born at a birth. They
are playing with fruit, and by them are a parrot and a monkey: but
the animals and fruit are much inferior to the figures. There are some
Latin verses in commendation of the gentleman, whose name or title
was <HI>Cobham.</HI> I suppose Sir George Brooke lord Cobham, who died
in the first year of queen Elizabeth, leaving eight sons and two daugh∣ters.
He had been committed to the tower by queen Mary, as privy
to Wyat's rebellion. I have likewise found two more pieces of this
master at Drayton, the ancient castle-like mansion of the Mordaunts,
now of the lady Elizabeth Germain. One is a half length of Marga∣ret
Audley second wife of Thomas duke of Norfolk beheaded temp.
Eliz. Her arms and titles are on the back ground: but the picture
has suffered. The other, of the same size, is of a young nobleman, in
a white stiff-bodied habit, black cloak and hat; he is very swarthy but
handsome. His age 22, 1563. This piece is finely preserved and
strongly coloured. In the life of Holbein I have mentioned the Henry
VIII. at Trinity Coll. Cambridge, with De Heere's mark. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace
has been repainted, but the rest of the body is highly finished, and does
great honour to the copyist.</P>
<P>In 1570 Lucas was employed to paint a gallery for Edward earl of
Lincoln, the lord high admiral.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the duke of Bedford's at Woburn are two heads of a countess of Lincoln and of lady Anne Ayscough, daughter of the earl. As they are evidently painted at the same time, and as the daughter appears the elder person, there is great rea∣son to believe that the countess was only the mother-in-law, and consequently that this portrait represents the fair Geraldine, so much celebrated by the earl of Surrey. Her chief beauty seems to have been her golden hair. These pictures, I should think, were painted by the following master, Ketel, rather than by Lucas de Heere.</NOTE> He was to represent the habits of
<PB N="146" REF="171"/>
different nations. When he came to the English, he painted a naked
man with cloth of different sorts lying by him, and a pair of sheers, as
a satire on our fickleness in fashions. This thought was borrowed from
Andrew Borde, who in his introduction of knowledge, to the first
chapter prefixed a naked Englishman, with these lines,
<Q><L>I am an Englishman, and naked I stand here,</L>
<L>Musing in my mind what rayment I shall wear.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not extraordinary that this witticism should have been adopted into the lord admiral's gallery. Andrew Borde, or Andreas Perforatus, as he called him∣self, was an admired wit in the latter end of Henry VIII. to whom he was some∣time physician. He had been a Carthusian, then rambled over many parts of the world, turned physician, and at last wrote against the marriage of priests; for which I conclude (though Antony Wood could not guess the reason) he was shut up in prison, where some said he poisoned himself. He wrote The Introduc∣tion to knowledge, partly in verse and partly in prose, and dedicated it to the lady Mary, afterwards queen. There are cuts before every chapter. Before the seventh is his own picture, standing in a pew with a canopy over him, a gown with wide sleeves and a chaplet of laurel. The title of the chapter is, “The seventh chapter showeth how the author of this boke had dwelt in Scotland, and did go thorow and round about Christendom, and out of Christendom, declaring the pro∣perties of all the regions, countries and provinces, the which he did travel thorow.” He wrote besides, The Breviary of Health; a Dietary of Health; The merry tales of the mad men of Gotham; a book extremely admired and often reprinted in that age. A right pleasant and merry history of the mylner of Abingdon, with his wife and his fair daughter, and of two poor scholars of Cambridge; and other things which may be seen in Antony Wood, vol. i. p. 75.</NOTE></L></Q>

Was born at Gouda in 1548, and early prosecuted his art with great
ardour, under the direction of his uncle, a tolerable painter and a better
scholar. At eighteen he went to Delft, and placed himself with Antony
Blockland, with whom he remained a year. From thence he travelled
to Fontainbleau, where he worked with great applause, in competition
with three of his countrymen; but the court coming to Fontainbleau,
they were ordered to leave the palace; Ketel went to Paris and lodged
with John de la Hame, the king's enameller, where he painted some
histories; but an edict obliging the subjects of the king of Spain to
quit France, Ketel returned to Gouda and remained there six years.
The troubles in his own country continuing, and consequently little
encouragement being given to the arts, Ketel embarked in 1573 for
England, and was entertained at London by a sculptor and architect
there, a friend of his uncle. Here he married a Dutch woman, and
his works growing into esteem, he was much employed by the mer∣chants
<PB N="148" REF="174"/>
in painting portraits, but was seldom engaged on history, to
which his inclination chiefly led him. However, having painted an
allegoric piece of Strength vanquished by Wisdom, it was purchased
by a young merchant, and presented to Sir Christopher Hatton, after∣wards
lord chancellor. This incident introduced Ketel to court; he
drew a good whole length of Sir Christopher, now at the earl of
Litchfield's at Ditchley; the portrait of Edward Vere earl of Oxford,
of William Herbert earl of Pembroke; of the lord admiral Lincoln,
now at Woburn, and of Henry Fitzalan earl of Arundel; and of se∣veral
others. At last, in 1578, he had the honour of painting the
queen herself, at the request of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I suppose was Frances Howard, second wife of the earl, and sister of the lord admiral Nottingham, a favorite. The earl of Hertford had been in dis∣grace for his first marriage with the lady Catherine Grey.</NOTE> countess of Hertford; Elizabeth
being then entertained at Hanworth by the famous Anne Stanhope,
widow of the protector, and mother of the earl of Hertford, then
very aged.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The duchess died nine years afterwards at the age of ninety.</NOTE></P>
<P>Ketel left England in 1581, and settled at Amsterdam, where he
painted a large picture of the trained bands with their portraits, and
their captain Herman Rodenburgh Beths at their head. In this pic∣ture
too he introduced his own portrait. The disposition, resemblances,
and the different stuffs of the habits, well imitated, were much admi∣red
in this piece. It was placed in the gallery of the Mall at Amster∣dam.
In 1589 he undertook another picture of the same sort for the
company of St. Sebastian, in which was the portrait of their captain
Didier Rosencraus. It was reckoned not inferior to the former, and
<PB N="149" REF="175"/>
was neither confused nor unanimated, notwithstanding the number of
portraits it contained.</P>
<P>In another of his works, under the figures of Christ and the apostles,
he represented Henry Keyser an architect of Amsterdam, and the prin∣cipal
virtuosos of that city. His best picture was the portrait of Si∣mon
Lack of that city; it was in the possession of one of the same fa∣mily
at the Hague. Many of his works were carried to Dantzick.</P>
<P>In the duke of Buckingham's collection was a large picture by this
master, representing the Virtues and Vices. See his catal. p. 19.</P>
<P>But Ketel, not content with the glory he acquired by these perfor∣mances,
instead of aiming at greater perfection, took it into his head to
make himself known by a method of painting entirely new. He laid
aside his brushes, and painted only with his fingers,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descamps mentions a fine picture painted by Weeninx in the same manner. Vol. ii. p. 310. And in a sale of pictures in Covent-garden 1729, were two heads painted by one Brandell with his thumb.</NOTE> beginning with his
own portrait. The whim took; he repeated the practice, and they
pretend, executed those fantastic works with great purity and beauty
of colouring. In this manner he painted two heads for the Sieur Van
Os of Amsterdam; the first, a Democritus, was his own portrait; the
other, of M. Morosini, in the character of Heraclitus. The duc de
Nemours, who was a performer himself, was charmed with the latter
and bought it. Another, was the picture of Vincent Jacobson, a
noted Wine-merchant of Amsterdam, with a glass of renish in his
hand. As his success increased, so did his folly; his fingers appeared
too easy tools; he undertook to paint with his feet, and his first essay
he pretended to make in public on a picture of the God of Silence. That
public, who began to think like Ketel, that the more a painter was a
<PB N="150" REF="176"/>
mountebank, the greater was his merit, were so good as to applaud
even this caprice.</P>
<P>Ketel, like De Heere, was a poet too, and wrote descriptions of seve∣ral
of his own works in verse. He understood architecture, geometry
and perspective, and modelled in clay and wax. He was living in 1600,
when Vermander wrote his account of him. Sandrart who makes him
travel to Venice and Rome, and die young, while he was employed on
a picture of the king of Denmark, has confounded the master with the
scholar; the latter incidents relate to Isaac Oteryn of Copenhaguen,
Ketel's only disciple.</P>
<P>Vermander dedicated to Ketel a dissertation on the statues of the an∣cients,
in which he mentions the great friendship that had subsisted be∣tween
them for thirty years.</P>
<P>Vertue observed on the works of De Heere and Ketel, that those of
the former are generally smaller than the life, neater, not so strongly
coloured, and most commonly painted on board. Those of Ketel, more
strongly coloured and with a fuller pencil, and always as large or rather
larger than nature.</P>
<P>The next on our list is a name of more note, celebrated even in the
lists of the great Italian masters: this was
<Q>FREDERIC ZUCCHERO,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sandrart, Felibien, and Baglione.</NOTE></Q>
The younger brother of Taddeo, and born like him, at Vado in the
duchy of Urbino, in the year 1550. Frederic was carried by his pa∣rents
to Rome, where their elder son was then employed: the younger
improved so much in the space of six years, that without his brother's
<PB REF="177"/>
<FIGURE>
<P>FREDERIC ZUCCHERO.—</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="151" REF="178"/>
assistance he painted a picture of Helicon and the Muses for a Roman
nobleman; and executed greatest part of a chapel in which his brother
was engaged. They worked for some time in concert; and being at
Florence painted in four days the whole history of the Passion which
was bespoken in a hurry for the decoration of a church on Easter sun∣day.
Taddeo dying at the age of thirty-seven, Frederic finished his
imperfect works, among which were the paintings at the magnificent
palace then lately built at Caprarola by cardinal Farnese. His picture
in distemper of Calumny, borrowed from the description of one paint∣ed
by Apelles, was supposed a tacit satire on that cardinal, with whom
he had quarrelled on some deficience of payment. Zucchero's temper
seems by another instance to have been pretty strongly tinctured with
resentment; while he was employed by Gregory XIII. to paint the Pau∣line
chapel in the vatican, he fell out with some of his holiness's officers.
To be revenged, he painted their portraits with ears of asses, and expo∣sed
the picture publicly over the gate of St. Luke's church, on the festi∣val
of that saint, the patron of painters.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verrio quarrelling with Mrs. Marriot the housekeeper at Windsor, drew her picture for one of the furies. This was to gratify his own passion; to flatter that of the court, he has represented lord Shaftsbury among the Demons o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> faction, in St. George's hall.</NOTE> But for this exploit he was
forced to fly from Rome; and passing into France, he was for some
time employed in the service of the cardinal of Lorrain. Thence he
went into Flanders, and made cartoons for tapestry; and in the year
1574 arrived in England. The queen sat to him for her picture; so
did the queen of Scots, for that well-known portrait at Chiswick,
which has been engraved by Vertue. Another picture of Elizabeth,
in a fantastic habit, something like a Persian, is in the gallery of royal
<PB N="152" REF="179"/>
personages at Kensington. Melville mentions her having and wearing
dresses of every country: In this picture too appears her romantic
turn; she is drawn in a forest, a stage behind her, and on a tree are in∣scribed
these mottoes and verses, which as we know not on what oc∣casion
the piece was painted, are not easily to be interpreted;

earl of Nottingham, lord high admiral, at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There too by his hand was a picture of Venus passing sentence on the boar that had killed Adonis. It was sold for 25<HI>l.</HI> at the sale of king Charles's collec∣tion.</NOTE> Hampton-court, and

own portrait, and copied the works of Holbein at the Steelyard as I
have mentioned. A chapel at Roehampton belonging to Mr. Bagnols
was said to be painted by him. What other works he performed here
I do not find;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vertue mentions a portrait of a marquis of Somerset; but there was no such person in that reign. At Wilton is a Nativity by Taddeo and Frederic, and two small portraits of Francis II. and Charles IX. of France, but these were not paint∣ed in England.</NOTE> probably not many; his stay was not long; historic
subjects were not in fashion, and he was offended at our religion. He
returned to Italy, and finished the dome at Florence begun by Vasari.
The Pope's anger too being vanished, he was readmitted to his old
employment at Rome, where he built a house for himself on the Monte
di Trinita, adorned with four portals, and painted on the outside in
fresco by his own hand. On the accession of Sixtus V. Zucchero was
invited to Spain by Philip II. to paint the Escurial, but his frescos not
pleasing, he returned to Rome, and founded the academy of painting,
for which Gregory XIII. had given him a brief, and of which he was
elected the first prince. These expences however drained him so much,
<PB N="154" REF="181"/>
that he again quitted Rome, and went to Venice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There he was competitor with Tintoret for painting the chapel of St. Roch. Catal. rai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onnè des tableaux du Roi. vol. ii. p. 70.</NOTE> to print some trea∣tises
that he had written on painting; and some poems too, for Zuc∣chero
was a poet like others of his profession. From Venice he passed
into Savoy, where he was favorably received by the duke for whom he
began to paint a gallery. Returning, he visited Loreto, and died at
Ancona in 1616, aged 66, leaving the remains of his fortune to his
academy.
<Q>MARC GARRARD<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His name is written Gerhardus, Guerards, and Garrard. Among the Sid∣ney-papers at Penshurst was a letter from Sir Robert Sidney to his lady about 1597, desiring her to go to Mr. Garrats, and pay him for the picture of her and the children, so long done and unpaid.</NOTE></Q>
The son of a painter of the same names, was born at Bruges in 1561,
and practiced history, landscape, architecture and portrait. He engra∣ved,
illuminated, and designed for glass-painters. His etchings for
Aesop's fables and view of Bruges were much esteemed. He came to
England not long after the year 1580, and remained here 'till his death
which did not happen 'till 1635, having been painter to queen Eliza∣beth
and Anne of Denmark.</P>
<P>His works are very numerous, though not easily known, as he never
used any peculiar mark. In general they are neat, the ruffs and habits
stiff, and rich with pearls and other jewels. His flesh-colours are thin,
and light, tending to a blueish tincture.</P>
<P>His procession of queen Elizabeth to Hunsdon-house has been en∣graved

order. The portraits, though small, have great resemblance, with
that uncommon fidelity of representing the air, stature and bulk of the
persons exhibited. Vertue made a copy of this roll in water-colours,
which I bought at his sale. It is not quite compleat, the original nor
having been entirely finished.</P>
<P>Garrard painted both prince Henry and prince Charles. Some
portraits of ladies by him are at lord Litchfield's at Ditchley. His
own picture was engraved by Hollar.</P>

<Q>HENRY CORNELIUS VROOM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sandrart 274 and Descamps 254.</NOTE></Q>
Was born in 1566 at Harlem, where his father was a statuary, of
whom and of his father-in-law, a painter of Florence, young Henry
learned to draw. His inclination led him first to paint views of towns;
in that pursuit he went to Rotterdam, and soon after on board a Spa∣nish
ship to St. Lucar, and thence to Seville, where he lived a short
time with a Dutch performer, a painter of monkeys, called by the
Spaniards, a Pintemony: From thence to Florence and Rome, where
he fixed for two years and was employed by Cardinal de' Medici, and
became acquainted with Paul Brill. At Venice he staid a year, and
<PB N="156" REF="185"/>
passing through Milan, Genoa, Turin and Paris, returned to Harlem,
where he employed himself on devout subjects in little, and having
stocked himself with a quantity, again set out for Spain, where he pro∣posed
to sell them, but was cast away on a small island near the coast of
Portugal. He and some of the crew were relieved by monks that lived
among the rocks, and conducted to Lisbon, where relating the danger
he had escaped, a paltry painter there engaged Vroom to draw the
storm he described, in which he succeeded so happily, that it was sold
to a nobleman for a considerable price. The Portuguese painter was
charmed, and continued to employ Vroom, who improved so much in
sea-pieces, that having got money, and returning home, he applied
himself entirely to that style of painting.</P>
<P>At this period, the great earl of Nottingham, lord high admiral
of England, whose defeat of the Spanish Armada had established the
throne of his mistress, being desirous of preserving the detail of that il∣lustrious
event, had bespoken a suit of tapestry describing the particu∣lars
of each day's engagement. Francis Spiering, an eminent maker
of tapestry, undertook the work, and engaged Vroom to draw the de∣signs.
The excellence of the performance, obvious to the public eye,
makes encomiums unnecessary.</P>
<P>It is pleasingly remarkable that there are two monuments of this
sort, and both finely executed, the tapestry in question and the suit at
Blenheim, monuments of two signal victories, acquired by sea and
land, under the auspices of two queens of the same country, and both
gained in defence of the liberties of nations, attacked by two of the
most powerfull princes, Philip II. and Louis XIV.</P>
<P>Vroom received an hundred pieces of gold for his labour: The arras
itself containing 708 ells Flemish, at 10<HI>l. 1s.</HI> per ell, cost 1628<HI>l.</HI> which

<P>The painter came to England to receive instructions and execute
his commission; and contracting a friendship with Isaac Oliver was
drawn by him: There is a print from that picture.</P>
<P>He returned to his own country, and painted a large picture, which
was much admired by prince Maurice, of the seventh day's action of
the fight above-mentioned. Vroom died rich, in what year is not
mentioned.</P>
<P>In the collection of king James II. were two sea-pieces, and in that
of Sir Peter Lely, a landscape, both described to be of old Vroom,
whence I suppose he had a son who followed his profession, and his
style too, as in the former catalogue is mentioned a sea-piece with king
Charles coming from Spain, said to be by Vroom, without the adjunct
of old. I find no other account of the son, nor of his being in Eng∣land.</P>

less note, and of whom but little is recorded, I shall mention at the
end of this chapter; but first I shall treat of the painters in miniature.

<Q>NICHOLAS HILLIARD</Q>
Limner, jeweller and goldsmith to queen Elizabeth and afterwards to
king James, was son of Richard Hilliard of Exeter, high sheriff of
that city and county in the year 1560. Nicholas (I suppose a younger
son) was born in 1547, and brought up to the business of a jeweller
and goldsmith, to which his inclination soon added that of painting in
miniature. The want of an able instructor directed him to study the
works of Holbein, as he says in a MS. I shall mention; “Holbein's
manner of limning I have ever imitated and hold it for the best.” But
though Hilliard copied the neatness of his model, he was far from at∣taining
that nature and force which that great master impressed on his
most minute works. Hilliard arrived at no strength of colouring; his
faces are pale, and void of any variety of tints, the features, jewels
and ornaments expressed by lines as slender as a hair. The exact dress
of the times he curiously delineated; but he seldom attempted beyond
a head, yet his performances were greatly valued; Dr. Donne in his
poem on the storm in which the earl of Essex was surprized returning
from the island voyage, says,
<Q><L>—a hand or eye</L>
<L>By Hilliard drawn, is worth a history</L>

painters, brings the comparison to our own time and country; nor

Mr. Isaac Oliver, inferior to none in Christendome for the countenance
in small, &amp;c.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of him in Wood's Athenae vol. ii. p. 296.</NOTE> Richard Heydock too of new college Oxon, in his
translation of Lomazzo on painting, published in 1598, says, “Lim∣nings,
much used in former times in church-books, as also in drawing
by the life in small models; of late years by some of our countrymen,
as <HI>Shoote, Betts,</HI> &amp;c. but brought to the rare perfection we now see, by
the most ingenious, painfull and skilfull master, Nicholas Hilliard,
and his well-profiting scholar, whose farther commendations I refer to
the curiositie of his works.”</P>
<P>The same author in another place mentioning “Mr. N. Hilliard so
much admired by strangers as well as natives, adds,” “to speak truth
of his ingenious limnings, the perfection of painting (in them is) so
extraordinary, that when I devized with myself the best argument to
set it forth, I found none better than to persuade him to do it himself
to the view of all men by his pen, as he had before unto very many by
his learned pencil, which in the end he assented to; and by me promis∣eth
a treatise of his own practice that way, with all convenient speed.”
This tract Hilliard actually wrote but never published. Vertue met
with a copy of it, which I have among his MSS.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An extract of it is in Brown's Ars pictoria p. 95. Lond. 1675. and some of his receipts in Sanderson's Graphice.</NOTE></P>
<P>Blaise Vigenere mentions Hilliard and the neatness of his pencil
very particularly; “Telle estoit aussi l'ecriture et les traits d'un pein∣tre

faisoit avec un pinceau fait des poils de la queue d'un escurieul, qui ne
<PB N="162" REF="192"/>
resiste ni ne soutient pas comme feroit une plume de corbeau, qui est
tres ferme.”</P>
<P>Hilliard's portrait, done by himself at the age of thirteen, was in the
cabinet of the earl of Oxford. He was still young when he drew the
queen of Scots. Queen Elizabeth sat to him often. Charles I. had
three of her portraits by him, one, a side face in the clouds, another,
one of his most capital performances, a whole length of her in her
robes sitting on her throne. In the same collection were several more
of his works, particularly a view of the Spanish Armada; and a curi∣ous
jewel, containing the portraits of Henry VII. Henry VIII. Edward
VI. and queen Mary; on the top was an enamelled representation of
the battle of Bosworth, and on the reverse, the red and white roses.
This jewel was purchased by the king of Hilliard's son.</P>
<P>In the essay towards an English school of painters,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed in 1706 at the end of the translation of De Piles Art of Painting. See p. 430.</NOTE> it is said that

Hilliard continued in vogue during this reign, and great numbers of
portraits by his hand, especially of ladies, are extant. He obtained
still greater favour from king James, drawing his majesty's and prince
Henry's pictures; and receiving a patent, printed by Rymer, to this
effect,</P>
<P>Whereas our well-beloved servant Nicholas Hilliard, gentleman,
our principal drawer of small portraits, and embosser of our medals in
gold, in respect of his extraordinary skill in drawing, graving, and
imprinting, &amp;c. we have granted unto him our special licence for
twelve years, to invent, make, grave and imprint any pictures of our
image or our royal family, &amp;c. and that no one do presume to do,
without his licence obtained, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This grant was of great emolument to him, as about that time he
engraved many small plates and sold licences for others, with the heads
of the king and royal family, which were then and are still used for
counters. Simon Pass and other engravers were employed by him in
these works.</P>
<P>Hilliard died January 7, 1619, and was buried in St. Martin's
church in the fields, Westminster (as appears by the register) in which
parish he had a house. He made his will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the register in Doctors Commons.</NOTE> in the preceding Decem∣ber,
leaving twenty shillings to the poor of the parish; to his sister
Anne Avery twenty pounds of thirty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He had the same salary as Holbein.</NOTE> that were due of his pension;
the remaining ten pounds to his other sister; some goods to his ser∣vant
maid; and all the rest of his effects, plate, jewels, rings, &amp;c. to
<PB N="164" REF="194" MS="y"/>
his son Laurence Hilliard, his sole executor. But the greatest obliga∣tion
we have to Hilliard is his having contributed to form<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Betts, whom I have mentioned as painting the portrait of Sir John Godsalve, is said by Vertue to have learned of Hilliard, and is called DESIGNER in Hall's chronicle about the year 1576, where too is mentioned one Tyrrel, a carver in wood.</NOTE></P>
<Q>JSAAC OLIVER.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I must not disguise, that, though Oliver was probably born in England, he was in all likelyhood of French extraction: In his will he spells his name Oliver, but on his drawings writes it Olivier. Vertue found mention of one “Aubin Olivier natif de Boisy, inventeur des engins de monoyes a Moulins;” and in Pal∣mer's History of Printing, p. 274, are accounts of Peter Olivier printer at Caen in Normandy 1515, and of Jean Olivier printer in the same city 1521. But Hondius, Sandrart, and all the writers who mention him, call him an English∣man, and it is an additional confirmation of his English birth, that he wrote in that language a treatise on limning, partly printed in Sanderson's Graphice; in his pocket-book was a mixture of French and English.</NOTE></Q>
<P>Hitherto we have been obliged to owe to other countries the best
performances exhibited here in painting. But in the branch (miniature)
in which Oliver excelled, we may challenge any nation to show a great∣er
master, if perhaps we except a few of the smaller works of Holbein.
Don Julio Clovio, the celebrated limner, whose neatness and taste in
grotesque were exquisite, cannot be compared with Jsaac Oliver, be∣cause
Clovio never painted portraits, and the latter little else. Petitot,
whose enamels have exceeding merit, perhaps owed a little of the beau∣ty
of his works to the happy nature of the composition: We ourselves
have nobody to put in competition with Oliver, except it be our own
<PB REF="195"/>

Cooper, who, though living in an age of freer pencil and under the au∣spices
of Vandyke, scarce compensated by the boldness of his expres∣sion,
for the truth of nature and delicate fidelity of the older master.
Oliver's son, Peter, alone approached to the perfection of his father.</P>
<P>Of the family of Jsaac Oliver I find no certain account; nor is it of
any importance; he was a genius; and they transmit more honour by
blood than they can receive. After studying under Hilliard, he had
some instructions from Zucchero; Vertue even thought, from variety
of his drawings after the great masters, especially Parmegiano, that he
had been in Italy. For whatever else relates to him, let his works
speak.</P>
<P>Dr. Meade possessed some of the most capital; as Oliver's own por∣trait,
extremely small; the head of the queen of Scots,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zink made an exceedingly fine copy of this in enamel, purchased by his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland. It is engraved in Jebb's collections.</NOTE> an admirable
piece, though very doubtfull whether of her; queen Elizabeth, pro∣file;

of Sir Philip Sidney, sitting under a tree. All these were purchased
by the late prince of Wales. I have another portrait of Oliver him∣self,
larger than that of Dr. Meade's, and without a hat, bought at
Mr. Barret's sale. This picture alone would justify all I have said of
him. The art of the master and the imitation of nature are so great in
it, that the largest magnifying glass only calls out new beauties.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Col. Sothby has another larger, and containing only the head, but bold, and admirably painted.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="197" MS="y"/>
At the lord Montacute's at Coudray is another invaluable work of
Jsaac. It represents three brothers of that lord's family, whole lengths,
in black: their ages twenty-one, twenty-four, and eighteen, with the
painter's mark <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. These young gentlemen resembled each other
remarkably, a peculiarity observeable in the picture, the motto on
which is, Figurae conformis affectus, 1598.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue met with a print, from whence he supposed Oliver borrowed his de∣sign. It was inscribed, Colignaei Fratres, Odetus, Gaspar, Franciscus.</NOTE> another person is coming
into the room, aged twenty-one. The picture is ten inches by seven.</P>
<P>His painting of James I. served Rubens and Vandyke, when they
had occasion to draw that prince after his decease.</P>
<P>In an office-book of the lord Harrington treasurer of the chambers,
in the possession of the late Dr. Rawlinson, was an entry of payment to
Jsaac Oliver picture-drawer, by a warrant dated at Lincoln April 4,
1617, for four several pictures drawn for the prince's highness as ap∣peareth
by a bill thereunto annexed, 40 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>In king Charles's catalogue are accounts of several of his works:
king James II. had still more; the earl of Arundel many. He drew
a whole length of Robert earl of Essex in white, and heads of him
several times, and of many others of the nobility; but his works are
much scarcer than those of his master Hilliard.</P>
<P>Colonel Sothby has a fine Magdalen by him, and the duchess of
Portland a head of Christ, that was Dr. Meade's.</P>
<P>Of his drawings several are extant, particularly a capital one in
queen Caroline's closet at Kensington; the subject, the placing of
<PB N="167" REF="198"/>
Christ in the sepulchre, consisting of twenty-six figures.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hollis has a fine drawing of the same, inscribed Jsa. Ollivier, which he bought at Vertue's sale. It has been retouched in several places.</NOTE> This piece
which Jsaac had not compleated, was finished by his son, and is dated
1616. Another, a large drawing, the murder of the Innocents, on
blue paper heightened, after Raphael. Vertue saw a print of the his∣tory
of St. Laurence, touched and heightened by Oliver with great
skill.</P>
<P>He did not always confine himself to water-colours. There are in∣stances
of his working in oil. In this manner he painted his own, his
wife's, and the portraits of his children; a head of St. John Baptist on
board; and the holy family.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Four heads on board in oil, by Oliver, are at lord Guildford's at Wroxton. These Vertue owns have a little of the stiffness of miniature, though at the same time very neat. Lord Oxford had the famous seaman T. Cavendish and Sir Philip Sidney, by Oliver, in oil: the last is now lord Chesterfield's: the former is at Welbeck.</NOTE> Vertue commends these much: as I ne∣ver
saw them, I can give no other account of his success in this way,
than that the works I have seen in oil by him are but indifferent.</P>
<P>Jsaac Oliver died at his house in the Black-friars London, in 1617
aged sixty-one or sixty-two. He was buried in St. Anne's church in
that parish, where his son erected a monument to his memory, with his
bust in marble<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The monument and bust were destroyed in the great fire in 1666, but a mo∣del of the latter is probably extant, Vertue having seen it.</NOTE> By his will (in the Prerogative-office) proved in
October, and executed in the preceding June, he bequeathed to his
wife the third of his effects, and the lease of his house in Black-friars;
excepting only to his eldest son Peter, all his drawings, limnings, histo∣rical

<P>Hondius, in his collection of artists of that age, has given the por∣trait
of Oliver, with these lines, which are poor enough,

<P><PB N="169" REF="200"/>
Besides these principal, there were several other artists in this reign,
of whom there are only slight memorials. I shall throw them together
as I find them, without observing any particular method.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue had seen on a large skin of velom a plan of the town and bounda∣ries of Dunwich in Suffolk, with it's churches, adjacent villages, &amp;c. and several remarks, made by Radulphus Aggas in March 1589. Whether this person was a professed painter does not appear; but from him was probably descended Ro∣bert Aggas, commonly called Augus, “who, says Graham in his English school, p. 398, was a good landscape-painter both in oil and in distemper, and was skill∣full in architecture, in which he painted many scenes for the playhouse in Co∣vent-garden.” Few of his works are extant; the best is a landscape presented by him to the company of painter-stainers, and still preserved in their hall, with other works of professors, whose dates I cannot assign. Robert Aggas died in London in 1679, aged about sixty—but I know not what the author I quote means by a playhouse in Covent-garden before the year 1679—I suppose it should be the theatre in Dorset-gardens.</NOTE></P>
<P>At the duke of Bedford's at Woburn is a portrait of Elizabeth
Bruges, daughter of the lord Chandois, with this inscription, Hiero∣nymus
Custodio, Antwerpiensis fecit 1589. The colouring is flat and
chalky.</P>
<P>On the picture of the murder of the lord Darnley at Kensington is
the name of the painter, but so indistinct, that Vertue who engraved it,
could not be sure whether it was Levinus <HI>Vogelarius</HI> or Venetianus. As
it is as little certain whether the picture was painted in England, Scot∣land,
or abroad, no great stress can be laid on this painter, as one of
queen Elizabeth's artists. Vertue thought he might be the same per∣son
with Levino, nephew of Pordenone, of whose hand king Charles
had a picture.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="201" MS="y"/>
At the same time resided here one Le Moyne, called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Indorum Floridam provinciam habitantium Icones primum ibidem ad vivum expressae a Jacopo Le Moyne cui nomen De Morgues 1591.</NOTE> Le Mor∣gues,
who is mentioned by Hackluyt in his translation of Laudonnie∣re's
voyage to Florida, vol. iii. p. 300. “Divers things of chiefest
importance at Florida drawn in colours at the charge of Sir Walter
Raleigh by that skillfull painter James Morgues, some time living in
the Blackfryars London, he whom monsieur Chatillon, then Admiral
of France, sent thither with Laudonniere for that purpose.”</P>
<P>We have seen in the life of Hilliard that Shoote and Bettes are men∣tioned
as painters in miniature. The former I suppose was John Shute,
who styles himself paynter and architecte in a book written and pub∣lished
by him in folio in 1563, called, The first and chief groundes of
architecture, used in all the auncient and famous monyments, with a
farther and more ample discourse uppon the same, than hitherto hath
been set out by any other. The cuts and figures in the book are in a
better style than ordinary, the author, as he tells the queen in the dedi∣cation,
having been sent into Italy in 1550 by the duke of Northum∣berland,
(in whose service he had been) and who maintained him there
in his studies under the best architects. This person published another
work, intituled, Two notable commentaries, the one of the original of
the Turks, &amp;c. the other of the warres of the Turke against George
Scanderbeg, &amp;c. translated out of Italian into English. Printed by
Rowland Hall 1562.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ames's History of Printing p. 217.</NOTE> Of Bettes, there were two of the name, Tho∣mas
and John, who, with several other painters of that time, are men∣tioned
by Meres in his second part of Wit's Commonwealth, published
in 1598 at London. “As learned Greece had these excellent artists
<PB N="171" REF="202" MS="y"/>
renowned for their learning, so England has these, Hilliard, Jsaac Oli∣ver
and John de Cretz, very famous for their painting. So as Greece
had moreover their painters, so in England we have also these, William
and Francis Segar brethren, Thomas and John Bettes, Lockie, Lyne,
Peake, Peter Cole, Arnolde, Marcus (Garrard) Jacques de Bruy, Cor∣nelius,
Peter Golchi, Hieronimo (de Bye) and Peter Vandevelde. As
Lysippus, Praxiteles and Pyrgoteles, were excellent engravers, so have
we these engravers, Rogers, Christopher Switzer and Cure.” I quote
this passage to prove to those who learn one or two names by rote, that
every old picture they see is not by Holbein, nor every miniature by
Hilliard or Oliver. By Nicholas Lockie, mentioned in this quotation,
there are several portraits; Dr. Rawlinson had one of Dr. John King
bishop of London, from which Simon Pass engraved a plate. Stowe
mentions one master Stickles, <HI>an excellent architect</HI> of that time, who
in 1596, built for a trial a pinnace that might be taken to pieces.

inventory of the goods, chattels, jewels, &amp;c. of the earl of Sussex

<P>Richard Stephens above-mentioned was a Dutchman, and no com∣mon
artist. He was a statuary, painter and medallist. The figures
on lord Sussex's tomb were his work, and in a good style. In the fa∣mily
of Lumley are some portraits painted by him,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly John lord Lumley 1590. When Jervase saw this picture (on which the name of Stephens appears) it was so well coloured, and so like the man∣ner of Holbein, that he concluded many pictures ascribed to that master are the works of Stephens.</NOTE> and among other
accounts some of his receipts, as there are too in the possession of the
duke of Devonshire, which makes it highly probably that the curious
portraits at Hardwicke of queen Elizabeth, in a gown embroidered
with sea-monsters, the queen of Scots, both at whole length, and others,
were painted by this Richard Stevens. But his best performances
seem to have been his medals, which are bold and in good taste. Mr.
Bryan Fairfax had one with a lady's head in the dress of the times,
and this legend,</P>

<P>Dr. Meade had two more, one of William Parr marquis of North∣ampton;
the other of Robert Dudley earl of Leicester, engraved in
Evelyn's discourse on English medals. That author says, that when
Leicester quitted Holland, he caused several medals to be engraved,
which he gave to his friends there. The medal in question is remark∣able
for the impertinence of the reverse; sheep grazing, and a dog
turning from them; under his feet, Invitus desero—round, Non
gregem sed ingratos. Vertue mentions others by the same workman,
of the earl of Pembroke and Sir Thomas Bodley.</P>
<P>Robert Adams, surveyor of the queen's buildings, seems to have
been a man of abilities. I cannot specify his works in architecture,
but there are two plans extant that he published; one is a large print
of Middleburgh dated 1588; the other, of the same date, is a small
parchment roll, drawn with the pen and intituled Thamesis Descriptio;
shewing by lines cross the river how far and from whence canon-balls
may obstruct the passage of any ship upon an invasion, from Tilbury
to London, with proper distances marked for placing the guns. Adams
was buried in an isle on the north side of the church of Greenwich
with this inscription; Egregio viro, Roberto Adams, operum regio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um

<P>Valerio Belli, called Valerio Vicentino, was a celebrated engraver of
precious stones; Felibien says,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 121.</NOTE> if his designs were equal to his execu∣tion,
he might be compared with the ancients. He engraved caskets
and vases of rock chrystal for pope Clement VII. and performed an
<PB N="175" REF="206" MS="y"/>
infinite number of other works. He certainly was in England in this
reign, and carved many portraits in cameo. Dr. Meade had a fine
bust of queen Elizabeth on onyx,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Charlemont bought it at Dr. Meade's sale.</NOTE> alto relievo in profile, and very
large, by the hand of this master. I have a jewel by him, containing
the head of lord treasurer Burleigh, affixed to the back of an antique
intaglia of Caracalla, and appendant to it, a smaller head of the queen,
both in cameo on onyx. The duke of Devonshire has several of his
works: Two<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The earl of Exeter has also one or two.</NOTE> profiles in cameo of queen Elizabeth; another gem with
the head of Edward VI. cameo on one side, and intaglia on the other;
and two pieces of chrystal with intaglias of several figures from the an∣tique.
To these two last is the sculptor's name.</P>
<P>The duchess of Leeds has a singular curiosity by this hand; it is a
pebble, in the shape of an oblong button; the upper side, brown, and
very convex; the under, red and white, and somewhat concave. On
the top is a profile of queen Elizabeth, incircled with foliage: at bot∣tom,
a knight, compleatly armed, in the act of tilting: on the back
ground the front of a castle with columns; on the bases of which
are the syllables, Es—sex; intimating the earl to be her majesty's
knight. In the museum Trevisanum is a medalion of him in marble,
another smaller in copper; on the back of it Valerio Belli Vicentino,
and a third of his son, dated 1572.</P>
<P>Among the Harleian MSS. is a list of jewels belonging to queen
Elizabeth; Item, a flower of gold garnished with sparkes of diamonds,
rubyes and ophals, with an agath of her majestie's visnomy and a perle
pendante with devises painted on it given by eight maskers in the
Christmas week anno regni 24. The agate was perhaps the work of
Vicentino.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="207" MS="y"/>
It is certain, though the queen's oeconomy or want of taste restrained
her from affording great encouragement to genius, that the riches and
flourishing situation of the country offered sufficient invitations to the
arts. Arcbishop Parker retained in his service at Lambeth a printer,
a painter and more than one engraver. Of the latter, the principal
were Berg or Hogen Berg, and Lyne above-mentioned, who was pro∣bably
his painter too. Prefixed to the archbishop's life, printed at
Lambeth, is a cut of his grace, inscribed, R. Berg f. Above twenty
books were published by the archbishop from his own printing-house:
two only have this head. At Ruckolt in the parish of Low-layton in
Essex (the mansion of the Hicks's) was a large genealogy of the kings
of England from the conquest to queen Elizabeth, with all the line of
France and England under these two titles, Linea Valesiorum et Linea
Angliae; at bottom the workman's name, Remigius Hogenbergius,
servus D. Matt. archiep. Cant. sculpsit 1574.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ames's Typograph. antiqu. p. 540.</NOTE></P>
<P>There was another such genealogic chart, intituled, Regnum Britan∣niae

<P>One Lyly too is mentioned as curious in copying the hands of an∣cient
deeds, who was employed by the same patron.</P>
<P>D. John Twisden, a divine of that age, was himself a performer in
painting. He died at the age of eighty-five in 1588. Vertue was

But there was one gentleman in this reign, who really attained the
perfection of a master, Sir Nathaniel Bacon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He married the daughter of the famous Sir Thomas Gresham, by whom he was ancestor of the present lord Townshend. See Collins's English Baronets, vol. i. p. 4.</NOTE> knight of the Bath, a
younger son of the keeper, and half brother of the great Sir Francis.
He travelled into Italy and studied painting there; but his manner and
colouring approaches nearer to the style of the Flemish school. Peach∣am
on limning p. 126, says, “But none in my opinion deserveth
more respect and admiration for his skill and practice in painting than
master Nathaniel Bacon of Broome in Suffolk (younger son to the most
honorable and bountifull-minded Sir Nicholas Bacon) not inferior in
my judgment to our skillfullest masters,” At Culford where he lived,
are preserved some of his works, and at Gorhambury his father's seat,
is a large picture in oil by him, of a cook maid with dead fowls, ad∣mirably
painted, with great nature, neatness and lustre of colouring.
In the same house is a whole length of him by himself<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His monument and bust are in the church at Culford, with his pallet and pencils. There is another for him at Stiff key in Norfolk, the inscription on which may be seen in the appendix to Masters's History of Corpus Christi coll. Camb. p. 85. It is said in the note that Sir Nathaniel was famed for painting plants, and well skilled in their virtues.</NOTE>; drawing on
a paper: his sword and pallet hung up: and a half length of his mother
by him. At Redgrave-hall in Suffolk were two more pieces by the
same hand, which afterwards passed into the possession of Mr. Row∣land
Holt, the one, Ceres with fruit and flowers; the other, Hercules
and the Hydra. In Tradescant's Museum was a small landscape,
painted and given to him by Sir Nathaniel Bacon.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="210"/>
Of the engravers in the reign of queen Elizabeth, who were many
and of merit, I shall say nothing here; Vertue having collected an
ample and seperate account of them, which makes another volume
of this work. I shall only mention now that that age resembled
the present in it's passion for portraits of remarkable persons. Stowe
in his annals speaking of the duke d'Alencon, who came over to
marry the queen, says, “by this time his picture, state and titles were
advanced in every stationer's shop and many other public places.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Cecil papers is a letter to the lord mayor of London dated July 21, 1561, telling him “The queen's majesty understandeth that certain bookbinders and stationers utter certain papers wherein be printed the face of her majesty and the king of Sweden; and although her highness is not miscontented that either her own face or the said king's should be painted or portraited; yet to be joined with the said king or with any other prince that is known to have made any request in marriage to her majesty, is not to be allowed; And therefore your lordship should send for the warden of the stationers or other wardens that have such papers to sell, and cause such papers to be taken from them and packed up to∣gether in such sort as none of them be permitted to be seen in any place.” The effect of this order appears from a passage in Evelyn's art of chalcography; “Had queen Elizabeth been thus circumspect, there had not been so many vile copies multiplied from an ill painting; as being called in and brought to Essex-house, did for several years furnish the pastrymen with peels for the use of their ovens.” p. 25.</NOTE>
The same author mentioning Sir Francis Drake's return, says, there
were books, pictures and ballads published of him.” In another point
too there was a parity; auctions were grown into vogue, and conse∣quently,
abuse; the first orders for regulating them by the lord mayor
were issued in that reign.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="211"/>
At the same period was introduced the custom of publishing repre∣sentations
of magnificent funerals. There is a long roll exhibiting the
procession at the obsequies of Sir Philip Sidney. It was (as is said at
the bottom of it) contrived and invented by Thomas Lant,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Thomas Lant was portcullis poursuivant: there are several copies ex∣tant in MS. of a treatise called, the Armoury of Nobility, first gathered by Ro∣bert Cook Clarencieux, corrected by Robert Glover, Somerset herald, and lastly augmented with the knights of the garter by Thomas Lant, portcullis, anno 1589. One copy of this work is in the possession of the Rev. Mr. Charles Parkin of Ox∣burgh in Norfolk, to whom I am obliged for this and other curious communi∣cations.</NOTE> gentle∣man,
servant to the said honorable knight, and graven in copper by
Derick or Theodor de Brie in the city of London 1587. It contains
about thirty-four plates. Perfixed is a small oval head of Mr. Lant,
aet. 32. The same person wrote a treatise of Heraldry.</P>
<P>John Holland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the pedigree of Holland in Blomfield's Norfolk.</NOTE> of Wortwell es{que} living in 1586, is commended as
an ingenious painter in a book called “The excellent Art of Paint∣ing,”
p. 20. But it is to the<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gray.</NOTE> same hand, to which this work owes
many of it's improvements, that I am indebted for the discovery of a
very valuable artist in the reign of queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>The eastern side of the college of Caius and Gonville at Cambridge,
in which are the Portae Virtutis et Sapientiae, was built in the years
1566 and 1567. These are joined by two long walls to the Porta
Humilitatis, and in these are two little Doric frontispieces, all, in ap∣pearance,
of the same date, and showing the Roman architecture revi∣ving,
with little columns and pilasters, well enough proportioned in
themselves and neatly executed, though in no proportion to the build∣ing
<PB N="180" REF="212" MS="y"/>
they were intended to adorn. In the entries of the college under
the year 1575 are these words, “Porta, quae honoris dicitur et ad
scholas publicas aperit, a lapide quadrato duroque extruebatur, ad eam
scilicet formam et effigiem, quam Doctor Caius, dum viveret, archi∣tecto
praescripserat, elaborata.” This gate cost 128<HI>l.—9s.—d.</HI> Dr.
Caius died July 29, 1573. In the same year are these words, “Positum
est Joh. Caio ex alabastro monumentum summi decoris et artificii eo∣dem
in sacelli loco, quo corpus ejus antea sepeliebatur: cui praeter in∣sculpta illius insignia, et annotatum aetatis obitusque diem et annum
(uti vivus executoribus ipse praeceperat) duas tantummodo sententias
has inscripsimus, <HI>Vivit post funera Virtus—Fui Caius.”</HI> This monu∣ment
(made to stand upon the ground, but now raised much above the
eye on a heavy base projecting from the wall) is a sarcophagus with
ribbed work and mouldings, somewhat antique, placed on a basement
supporting pretty large Corinthian columns of alabaster, which uphold
an entablature, and form a sort of canopy over it. The capitals are
gilt and painted with ugly scrolls and compartments, in the taste of
that reign. The charge of the founder's tomb was as follows;
<LIST>

<ITEM>To labourers 0—18—1</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>Then in the year 1576 are these words, “In atrio doctorio Caii
columna erecta est, eique lapis miro artificio elaboratus, atque in se 60
horologia complexus imponitur, quem THEODORUS HAVEUS Clevien∣sis,
artifex egregius, et insignis architecturae professor, fecit, et insigni∣bus

but when Loggan did his views of the colleges, the pillar (though
not the dia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s) was yet standing.</P>
<P>In the college is a good portrait on board of Dr. Keys (not in pro∣file)
undoubtedly original, and dated 1563, aetatis suae 53, with Latin
verses and mottoes; and in the same room hangs an old picture (bad
at first and now almost effaced by cleaning) of a man in a slashed
doublet, dark curled hair and beard, looking like a foreigner, and hold∣ing
a pair of compasses, and by his side a Polyedron, composed of
twelve pentagons. This is undoubtedly Theodore Haveus himself,
who, from all these circumstances, seems to have been an architect,
sculptor, and painter, and having worked many years for Dr. Caius and
the college, in gratitude left behind him his own picture.</P>
<P>In the gallery of Emanuel college, among other old pictures, is one
with the following inscription, recording an architect of the same age
with the preceding; “Effigies Rodulphi Simons, architecti suâ aetate
peritissimi, qui (praeter plurima aedificia ab eo praeclarè facta) duo
collegia, Emanuelis hoc, Sidneii illud, extruxit integrè: magnam etiam
partem Trinitatis reconcinnavit amplissimè.” head and hands, with a
great pair of compasses.</P>
<P>In a book belonging to the jewel-office, in the possession of the earl
of Oxford, Vertue found mention “of a fair bason and lair (Ewer)
guilt, the bason having in the bushel (body) a boy bestriding an eagle,
and the ewer of the worke of Grotestain, with gooses heads antique
upon the handle and spoute, weighing together xx ounces.” In the

same book was this memorandum, “remaining in the hands of Robert
Brandon and Affabel Partrage, the queen's goldsmiths, four thousand
ounces of guilt plate, at five shillings and four pence the ounce, in the
second year of the queen.”</P>
<P>I shall conclude this reign and volume with what, though executed
in the time of her successor, properly relates to that of Elizabeth.
In the earl of Oxford's collection was an office-book in which was con∣tained
