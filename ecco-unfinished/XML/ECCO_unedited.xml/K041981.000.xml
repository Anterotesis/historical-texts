<SP>

<P>Stop a minute; may I be permitted to speak?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUDS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the affair is this. My wife Alice—for you must know my name is Ephraim Suds, I am a soap-boiler in the city, took it into her head, and nothing would serve her turn, but that I must be a common-council man this year; for says Alice, <HI>says she</HI>, It is the <HI>onliest</HI> way to rise in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A just observation—you succeeded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUDS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! there was no danger of that—yes, yes, I got it all hollow; but now to come to the
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
marrow of the business. Well, Alice, says I, now I am chosen, what's next to be done? <Q>“Why now, says Alice, <HI>says she</HI>, thee must learn to make speeches; why dost not see what purferment neighbour Grogram has got; why man 'tis all brought about by his <HI>speechifying</HI>. I tell thee what, Ephraim, if thee can'st but once learn to lay down the law, there's no knowing to what thee may'st ”rise—</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your lady had reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUDS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I thought so too; and, as good luck would have it, who should come into the city, in the very nick of time, but master professor along with his lectures—Adod, away in a hurry, Alice and I danced to Pewterers Hall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You improv'd, I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUDS.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lud! It is unknown what knowledge we got; we can read—oh! we never stop to spell a word now—and then he told us such things about verbs, and nouns, and adverbs, that ne∣ver entered our heads before, and empharis, and accent; heav'n bless us, I did not think there had been such things in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you <HI>speechify'd</HI> yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>SUDS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soft; soft and fair; we must walk before we can run—I think I have laid a pretty foun∣dation. The Mansion-house was not built in a day, Master Foote. But to go on with my tale, my dame one day looking over the pa∣pers, came running to me; now Ephraim, says she, thy business is done, rare news, lad; here is a man at the other end of the town, that will make thee a <HI>speecher</HI> at once, and out she pull'd your proposals. Ah Alice, says I, thee be'st but a fool, why I know that man, he is all upon his fun, he lectures—why, 'tis all but a bam—well, 'tis but seeing, says she, so, <HI>wolens nolens</HI>, she would have me come hither; now if so be you be serious, I shall think my money wisely bestow'd; but if it be only your comical works, I can tell you, you shall see me no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I should be extremely sorry to lose you; If I knew but what would content you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUDS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I want to be made an orator <HI>on</HI>; and to speak speeches, as I tell you, at our meet∣ings, about politicks, and peace, and addresses, and the new bridge, and all <HI>them</HI> kind of things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, with your happy talents I should think much might be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>SUDS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am proud to hear you say so. Indeed I am. I did <HI>speechify</HI> once at a vestry concerning new lettering the church buckets, and came off cutely enough, and to say the truth, that was the thing that provok'd me to go to Pew∣terers-Hall.<STAGE><HI>Sits down again.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I flatter myself, that in propor∣tion to the difference of abilities in your two instructors, you will here make a tolerable progress. But now, Sir, with your favour, we will proceed to explain the nature of our design, and I hope in the process, you, gen∣tlemen, will find entertainment, and you, Sir, information.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Mr. Foote then proceeds to his lecture.</HI></STAGE>
<P>My plan, gentlemen, is to be consider'd as a superstructure on that admirable founda∣tion laid by the modern professor of English, both our labours tending to the same general end; the perfectioning of our countrymen in a most essential article, the right use of their native language.</P>
<P>But what he has happily begun, I have the vanity to think I have as happily finish'd; he has, it is true, introduc'd you into the body of the church, but I conduct you into the quoir of the cathedral: Or, to explain myself by a more familiar allusion, tho' he is the Poitier who
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
teaches you the step and the grounds; yet I am the Gallini who gives you the air, and the grace of the minuet.</P>
<P>His aim is propriety alone; mine propriety with elegance.</P>
<P>For tho' reading, so shamefully neglected, not only by those of tender years, but the adult; not only by children, but even by grown men and women; not only in our private se∣minaries, but in our publick universities, is al∣lowed to be a necessary ingredient towards the formation of an orator; yet, a great many other rules, a great many other precepts, are re∣quisite to obtain his perfection.</P>
<P>Nay, perhaps we might, to support an ar∣gument without the danger of a defeat, at least if we may trust observation, that of all the pro∣fessions that require a verbal intercourse with the public, there is no one to whom reading is of so little utility as that of oratory.</P>
<P>I need not insist upon this head, as I be∣lieve every gentleman's experience will fur∣nish him with instances of men eminent in oratory, who, from an early vivacity, have neglected, or the indulgence of their parents have been emancipated from the attention and application necessary, it is true, to acquire this rugged art; but at the same time so ill∣suited to their tender years, and so opposite to those innocent amusements in which children are known universally to delight. <HI>Thwart not a child, for you spoil his temper</HI>,—is, or at least
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
ought to be, an English proverb, as it is an universal practice.</P>
<P>I would not here be understood to depre∣ciate the usefulness of reading, or to detract from the exceeding merit of the professor's plan; no, my meaning is only just to drop a a hint that I may occasionally use him as a walking-stick; a kind of an <HI>elegantly clouded Mocoa</HI>, or an <HI>airy Anamaboo:</HI> yet, that it is by no means my intention to depend upon him as <HI>a support</HI>, or lean upon him as <HI>a crutch</HI>; in a word, he will be rather ornamental than neces∣sary tome.</P>
<P>But useless as his plan is to me, I sincerely wish it success for the sake of the public; and if my influence was equal to my inclination, I would have a law enacted, upon the plan of the militia bill, that annually, or biennially, draughts should be made from every parish of two, three, or more, as in that act of able bodied, so in this of intelligent persons, who, at the expence of the several counties, should be sent to the capital, and there compelled to go thro' as many courses of the professor's lec∣tures as he shall deem sufficient: thus, by those periodical rural detachments, the whole nation will in a few years be compleatly served, and a stock of learning laid in that will last 'till time shall be no more.</P>
<P>Would our rulers but adopt this scheme! how superior would England be even to the most illustrious periods of Greece and Rome!
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
what an unrival'd happiness for us, what an eternal fund of fame for them! ye Solons, ye Lycurguses, ye Numas hide your diminish'd heads, see what a revolution two laws in a few years have produc'd, see a whole people sunk in more than Gothic ignorance, accustom'd to no other iron implements than the pacific plough-shear, or the harmless spade, start out at once profound scholars and veteran soldiers: If at this happy period, a Frenchman thinking any thing out of his own country worthy his attention should condescend to pay this kingdom a visit; methinks, I anticipate the account he will give of us at his return, (like his countryman of old, who at the taking of Rome, bursting into the capitol, and there finding the senate fix'd and immoveable in their seats, declar'd them an assembly of kings), so will he at once pronounce the whole British nation to be an army of generals, and one congregation of doctors. Happy country! where the <HI>Arma &amp; Toga</HI> are so fortunately blended, as to pre∣vent all contention for the pre-eminence.</P>
<P>I know but one objection that can be made to this plan, and that merely a temporary one; that the culture of our lands will sustain an infinite injury, if such a number of peasants were to deparochiate, there being already scarce hands sufficient, from the recruits con∣stantly made for Germany, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. to carry on the common business of husbandry.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16"/>But what are riches, perishable commodities, glittering, transitory, fallacious goods, when compar'd to the substantial incorruptible en∣dowments of the mind: this truth is indeed happily inculcated by an old English adage;</P>
<Q><L>When lands and goods are gone and spent,</L>
<L>Then learning is most excellent.</L></Q>
<P>This sensible and poetical distich, I would recommend to Mr. Professor, as a motto for his intended treatise; but I suppose he is al∣ready well provided with an apt <HI>Latin</HI>, if not a <HI>Greek</HI> one, to either of which I must yield the preference.</P>
<P>But to wave this ethical argument, I think I can easily foil the force of this objection, by a natural and obvious <HI>Succedaneum</HI>. Suppose a clause was to be added to the bill for the im∣portation of tallow, raw hides, and live cattle from Ireland, that during this literary emigra∣tion, a sufficient number of inhabitants of that country may be transported hither to supply the vacancy; but here it must be observ'd, that for this purpose an act of parliament is indispensably necessary; for tho' it would be difficult, if not impossible for us in our pre∣sent condition, to get in even our harvests, without the aid of hands annually exported for that purpose from Ireland; yet this is at best but an illicit trade, and the men themselves are to be consider'd under the article of smug∣gled goods: a very heavy penalty being laid
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
by statute on all masters of vessels, who shall venture to import any of the above cited com∣modity into this realm, without special li∣cence; to this purpose I recollect a case in point, the fifth of William and Mary, Ban. Reg. The king contra Oflaarty. Vide V. Rep. vol. 3. chap. 9. page 4.</P>
<P>But if this should be thought by the people in power too great an indulgence to the Irish, as we have never been remarkably profuse in our favours to our loyal and affectionate sister; I see no other method of redressing the ima∣ginary evil, than by exempting from this ser∣vice all the males 'till a general peace, and accepting in their room, a suitable number of discreet middle aged females; and these, when they have been properly perfected in the my∣steries of our language, may be return'd to their several parishes, and there form little in∣fantine communities of literati, which will be a stock for the succeeding generation; and indeed upon consideration, I don't know whether this won't prove the best method for the in∣troduction and universal propagation of the plan.</P>
<P>For the English common people, naturally sullen and obstinate, and religiously attach'd to their old customs, might be shock'd and scan∣daliz'd to see at one bold stroke, the fescues, and fasces, which have been from time im∣memorial consign'd to one, or more matron in every village, ravish'd at once from their
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
hands, and deliver'd over to the administration of the opposite sex.</P>
<P>But to return to my own subject, from which my zeal for Mr. Professor's success, has tempted me to make rather too long a digression.</P>
<P>When I ventur'd to affirm that the profession of an orator, might exist independently of an accurate knowledge of the arrangement, and different combinations of the four and twenty letters, so far as <STAGE><HI>in the words of the Professor</HI></STAGE>, they relate to their being the arbitrary marks of meaning upon paper; yet, I would not be understood to assert this generally, as to every species of oratory, but to confine myself to those particular branches, only where the ora∣tor's own mind suggests the matter that his own mouth discharges: For instance, now, as when affairs of state are weigh'd at a com∣mon-council, religious points militated at the Robin-hood, the arts and sciences handled in the Strand, or politicks debated near West∣minster-abby; here the arguments, and words given are suppos'd to arise from the imme∣diate impulse of the giver; but where there are concurrent agents, as in the oratory peculiar to the pulpit, and the stage, where one indivi∣dual furnishes the matter, and another ad∣ministers the manner, the case is widely dif∣ferent.</P>
<P>In the first instance, a tolerable proficiency in reading is indispensably requisite, as scarce any memory but the late Mr. Heydigger's
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
could retain to any degree of certainty, the various parts of the liturgy, the old, and new testament, briefs, faculties, excommunications, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and a lapse on those solemn oc∣casions might be attended with very aukward circumstances: nor would I here be suppos'd to insinuate, that the pieces of oratory deli∣ver'd from the pulpit, are not the composition of the deliverer, no—This is so far from be∣ing generally the case, that I have often heard complaints made against particular agents, that they have forc'd upon their congregations their own crude, and insipid productions, when at the same time, their native language would furnish them with so extensive, and noble col∣lection of admirable materials. But here the auditor, unless he be well read in theology, may be led into a mistake; for there are some men, who, by a particular happiness in their manner, have the address to make the works of other men so absolutely their own, that there is no distinguishing the difference; at this the poet hints in his <HI>male dum recitas</HI>, &amp;c. For these various reasons, I think a warm application to the art of reading, cannot be too strongly recommended to the professors of this kind of oratory.</P>
<P>With regard to the professors of the stage, tho' reading is undoubtedly useful, yet, as the performer is to repeat, and not to read, the deficience may be supply'd by the introduction of a third agent, viz. a person to read to him 'till
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
the words are rooted in his memory. This ex∣pedient, tho' tedious, I have known frequently practis'd with good success: little blunders will now and then unavoidably arise, either from the misapprehension of the second agent, or the ig∣norance, or waggery of the third; but these slips are generally unobserv'd, or thro' inattention, or indulgence, overlook'd by an audience. But to return to the consideration of my own plan, from which, no temptation shall for the future seduce me to digress.</P>
<P>We will first, then, consider the utility of oratory.</P>
<P>Secondly, the distinct and various kinds, or species of that science, as they are practis'd at this day in this kingdom.</P>
<P>Thirdly, we will demonstrate that every branch of English oratory is peculiarly our own, owes its rise, progress, and perfection to this country, and was not only unknown to the antients, but is entirely repugnant to all those principles they have endeavour'd to esta∣blish.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that any rhetorical system now existing, instead of a cross in the hands, with letters to direct you on your road, will prove only, but a Will in the Wisp to confound, perplex, and bewilder you.</P>
<P>Fifthly, from hence will result a necessity, for the immediate establishment of an academy, for the promulgation and inculcation of mo∣dern oratory.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="21"/>To which academy, the author of these proposals, does hope, sixthly, that he shall be appointed perpetual professor.</P>
<P>Perhaps, it may not be impertinent here to observe, that the author has industriously avoid∣ed, and will in the course of this treatise avoid all poetical allusion; all grandeur of expression, all splendor of diction, in short, renounce every rhetorical prop, as knowing that on di∣dactic subjects, order, simplicity, and perspi∣cuity are the means to gain his end, which is not to gratify the imagination, but to improve and polish the understanding of my country∣men.</P>
<P>First, then, we are to demonstrate the uti∣lity of oratory: and, this we flatter ourselves will, in a great measure be evident from the consideration of its universality, and the dis∣tinctions it procures, both lucrative and honour∣able, to any man eminent in the art.</P>
<P>There is, by the constitution of this king∣dom, an assembly of many individuals, who, as the seventh son of a seventh son, is born a physician, are orators by hereditary right; that is, by birth they are enabled to give their opinions, and sentiments on all subjects, where the interest of their country is concern'd: To this, we are to add another assembly, consist∣ing of 558 individuals, where, tho' the same privilege is enjoy'd as in the first instance; yet this advantage is not possess'd in virtue of any inherent natural right, but is obtain'd in

consequence of an annual, triennial, or sep∣tennial deputation from the whole body of the people; if then we add to this list the number of all those candidates who are ambitious of this honour, with the infinite variety of changes that a revolution of twenty years will produce, we cannot estimate those funds of national orators in <HI>esse, posse</HI>, and <HI>velle</HI>, to a smaller quan∣tity than 20,000; and this, I believe, by the disciples of Demoivre, will be thought a very moderate computation.</P>
<P>The two orders of the long robe next de∣mand our attention; and as the pre-eminence is unquestionably due to the priesthood, let us consider what number of persons is necessary to supply that service? England is divided into nine thousand nine hundred and thirteen parishes: now, if we suppose two pastors for every parish, this learned body will be found to consist of nineteen thousand eight hundred and twenty-six individuals; but as the most sacred characters are no more exempted from the fatal stroke that puts a temporary period to our existence, than the prophane, it is ne∣cessary that a provision should be made of fit and able persons; so that at all events there be no lack of labourers in this plentiful vineyard: nor has the policy of this nation been so blinded as not to guard against this possible contin∣gency, by erecting schools, seminaries, and uni∣versities, in which a convenient quantity of our youth are properly trained, in order to fill
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
up chasms which may be occasionally made by the insatiable scythe of death. If then we estimate this corps de reserve at the half only of the standing force, we shall find the army entire amount to 29,739.</P>
<P>I foresee that the objection will be made to this calculation, viz. That two pastors to every parish is a most exorbitant and impro∣bable charge; for that many parishes, from impropriations, appropriations, and other acci∣dents, instead of two are scarce able to sup∣port one pastor; and that this complaint is al∣most general throughout the whole principality of Wales, where many individuals of this re∣spectable order, to the great damage of their dignity, are oblig'd to have recourse to very unclerical professions for the support of them∣selves and families.</P>
<P>This objection we will allow its full force; but then if it be consider'd that in our origi∣nal estimate we omitted all deans, canons, prebends, heads and fellows of colleges, chap∣lains to ships, regiments, and private families, together with the whole body of dissenting mi∣nisters of all denominations, field-preachers and parish-clerks, I believe we shall be thought rather to have diminished than exaggerated the real quantity.</P>
<P>As I have not been able to get admittance to the archives of the several inns of court in this metropolis, I am afraid we shall not be able to determine with the same degree of cer∣tainty,
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
the exact number of those who have devoted their lives and labors to the explana∣tion and due execution of our municipal laws: I am therefore obliged to depend on circum∣stantial evidence, which, in some cases is ad∣mitted even in our courts to have equal force with proof positive.</P>
<P>And here the reason of the law (as the law is the perfection of reason) is extremely clear. To illustrate this by an instance.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> swears a robbery against <HI>B. A.</HI> may lye, or at least be mistaken; but if the goods stolen from <HI>A.</HI> and previously described by him, are found with their mark in the posses∣sion of <HI>B. B.</HI> not being able to account for such possession, that circumstance shall be deem'd of at least equal weight against <HI>B.</HI> as if <HI>A.</HI> was to swear positively to the personal iden∣tity of <HI>B.</HI> This being the practice of the courts, we shall proceed with all possible ex∣pedition (which indeed is not the practice of the courts) to produce our proofs circumstan∣tial. As in the former instance we have grounded our calculation on the number of parishes, we shall in this derive our computation from the number of houses in the kingdom.</P>
<P>To any man tolerably acquainted with the country of England, it is unnecessary to ob∣serve that not only in every town, but almost in every hamlet thro' which he travels, his eyes are constantly caught by the appearance of a smart house, prefac'd with white rails and
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
prologu'd by a red door with a brass knocker; when you desire to be acquainted with the name and quality of the owner of this mansion, you are always told that it belongs to lawyer such a one: now, if a hamlet containing thirty houses, with perhaps an environ of an equal number, where labour and the fruits of the earth are the only sources of wealth, can support one attorney in this rural magnificence; what an infinite number of lawyers can a commercial capital sustain? But because I would rather retrench than exceed, I will only quarter one attorney upon fifty houses. The number of houses in the reign of George the First (since which time the quantity is considerably en∣creas'd) was computed at 1,175,951. The number of attorneys then will be 23,518, and if we reckon one barrister to twenty attorneys, the sum total is 24,693.</P>
<P>I know it will be here objected that but one small part of this numerous body can be bene∣fited by my plan, the privilege of speech∣ing publickly being permitted to the superior order, the barristers alone: but this criticism is confin'd to the observation of what passes merely in Westminster-Hall, without con∣sidering that, at every quarter and petty session at all county-courts, courts-leets, courts-ba∣ron, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. full power of pleading is per∣mitted to every practitioner of the law.</P>
<P>As the number of those who incorporate themselves to promote, not only with their
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
cash but their counsel, the progress of the arts and sciences, is unlimited, it will be impossible for any fix'd period to ascertain their quantity: nor can we, with any certainty, as the Court-Register has been silent to the members of common-council, determine the amount of the city orators; besides, as what has been already offered is more than sufficient to prove the utility of our scheme from its universality, we shall not trouble our readers nor ourselves with any farther calculations; for tho' they are replete with great depth of knowledge, are the result of intense application, and the vehicles of mathematical truths, yet to the million the disquisition is but dry and tedious, and our pupose always was and is to mix with our instruction, a proper portion of delectation.</P>
<P>We will therefore, for these reasons, hasten to the consideration of the second point pro∣pos'd, viz. An enquiry into the various kinds of oratory now existing in this country. And we shall not, on this occasion, trouble our∣selves with the investigation of all the smaller branches of this art; but, like the professors in anatomy, contenting ourselves with the dissec∣tion of the noble parts, remit the examination of the ignoble ones to the care of subaltern artists. Leaving, then, to the minute philo∣sophers of the age all the orators of vestries, clubs, and coffee-houses, <HI>Paulo majora cana∣mus</HI>, and for the better illustration of this head, permit me, reader, to be a little fanci∣ful.

<P>But here, reader, let me not arrogate to my∣self the merit of this happy explication; I own the hint was first given me with my Grammar.
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
The ingenious, profound Lilly, after he has led his pupils thro' the various, and almost impervious provinces of nouns, pronouns, verbs, participles, and adverbs, conducts them to the foot of that arduous and stupendous mountain <HI>Qui Mihi:</HI> here dreading lest his youthful ardour might be dampt with the steep ascent, he re-animates his slacken'd nerves with the mystick picture of an apple-tree, the access to whose boughs, tho' tedious and difficult, will yet be amply rewarded by leave torevel un∣controul'd thro' the whole region of pepins. May the luscious fruit sprouting from the apex of each of my ramifications prove an equal spur to every beardless orator.</P>
<P>I don't know whether the mentioning an∣other order of orators, as they are not at present existing in this kingdom, may not be deemed an impropriety. But as I am a sincere lover of my country, I can't help recommending an im∣mediate importation of some of those useful and able artists. Sir William Temple, in his Essay on Poetry, has recorded their virtues; and as the race was not extinguished in his time, it is to be hoped that it still remains.</P>
<P>In Ireland, says Sir William, the great men of their scepts, amongst many officers of their family, had not only a physician, a huntsman, a smith, and such like, but a poet and tale∣teller.</P>
<P>The first recorded and sung the actions of their ancestors, and entertained the company
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
at feasts. The latter amused them with tales when they were melancholy and could not sleep; and a very gallant gentleman has told me of his own experience, that in his wolf-hunting there, when he us'd to be abroad in the mountains three or four days together, and lay very ill at nights, so as he could not well sleep, they would bring one of those tale-tel∣lers, that when he lay down would begin a story of a king, or a giant, a dwarf and a damsel, and continue all night long in such an even tone that you heard him going on when∣ever you awakened. And he believ'd nothing any physicians could give had so good and so innocent an effect to make men sleep in any pains or distempers of body or mind. These are Sir William Temple's words, which con∣tain an amazing instance of the power of those orators over the passions, it requiring full as much art and address to asswage and quell, as to blow up, and excite a tumult in the mind.</P>
<P>In a bill not long since depending in parlia∣ment for the better regulating the city-watch, a clause was recommended by a late respecta∣ble magistrate, that to prevent the watchmen from sleeping at nights on bulks (the source of many disorders) the said watchmen should be compelled to sleep six hours in the day; an arch member seconded the motion, and begg'd to be included in this clause, for that being grievously afflicted with the gout, he could not for many days sleep a single wink; now
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
if he could be compelled to take a six hours sleep every day, he apprehended that his fits would be of a much shorter duration. Upon this dry comment the motion was rashly re∣jected; but if the house had received the least intimation of the astonishing abilities of the Rockers (for by that appellation I choose to distinguish this order of orators) I am con∣vinced that the above clause would not only have been receiv'd, but that proper encourage∣ment would have been given by parliament for the introduction and establishment of this useful oratorical sect.</P>
<P>Nor, indeed, considering the vast addition to our customary cares, from the unaccount∣able fluctuation of our funds, the cause of con∣cern to many thousand individuals, do I think a visit from a convenient quantity of those artists would be now out of season; but how this honour is to be obtain'd, whether any of these great men are now residing amongst us, under the disguise of chairmen and hack∣ney coachmen? or, whether it would not be more adviseable to employ those gentlemen, who have so lately and successfully rummaged the Highlands of Scotland and Ireland for the remains of Runic poetry in search of the ablest professors, is submitted to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts?</P>
<P>I am aware that on this occasion some arch wag, possess'd of the same spirit with the above senator, will object to my scheme of
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
importation, by alledging, that we have of our own growth, an ample provision of rockers, and refers us for proof to our several churches and chapels, during the hours of eleven and two on a Sunday, where the sleep-compell∣ing power, will be experimentally demon∣strated to exist in its full force amongst us; but not to derogate from the abilities of my countrymen, surely the shortness of the time, the cause of the nap, rarely continuing above fifteen or sixteen minutes, will not admit of a proper experiment: besides, how can one ora∣tor supply a whole parish, unless, indeed, our churches were to be converted into dormitories, which I can't think will happen, as this would be attended with inconveniencies too obvious to need a recital.</P>
<P>Abstracted from this last order, the English orators are to be divided into four distinct classes, the pulpit, the senate, the bar, and the stage; with the first of these branches, the pulpit, I shan't interfere, and indeed, so few people now of consequence and consi∣deration frequent the churches, that the art is scarce worth cultivation.

<P>Mr. President, the case is this; it is not be∣case I am any grate lover of that same usque∣bagh that I have set my mark to the motion: but becase I did not think it was decent for a number of gontlemen that were, d'ye see, met to settle the affairs of the nation, to be guzling a pot of porter; to be sure the liquor is a pretty sort of a liquor enough when a man is hot with trotting between a couple of poles; but this is another guess matter, becase why, the head is concerned, and if it was not for the malt and the haps, dibble burn me but I would as soon take a drink from the Thames as your porter. But as to usquebagh; ah long life to the liquor—it is an exhilirator of the bowels, and a stomatic to the head; I say, Mr. President, it invigorates, it stimulates, it—in short it is the onliest liquor of life, and no man alive will die whilst he drinks it.</P>

<P>Mr. President, I second Mr. O'Droheda's motion, and, sir, give me leave—I say, Mr. President—<STAGE><HI>looks in his hat</HI></STAGE> give me leave to observe that, sir, tho' it is impossible to add any force to what has been advanced by my honourable friend in the straps; yet, sir <STAGE><HI>looks into his hat again</HI></STAGE> It may, sir, I say be neces∣sary to obviate some objections that may be made to the motion, and first, it may be thought—I say, sir, some gentlemen may think, that this may prove pernicious to our manufacture—<STAGE><HI>looks in his hat</HI></STAGE> and the duty doubtless it is of every member of this illustri∣ous assembly to have a particular eye unto that, but Mr. President—sir—<STAGE><HI>looks in his hat, is confused and sits down.</HI></STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>STRAP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. President, it was not my intention to
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
trouble the assembly upon this occasion, but when I hear insinuations thrown out by gen∣tlemen, where the interest of this country is so deeply concerned, I own I cannot sit silent; and give me leave to say, sir, there never came before this assembly a point of more impor∣tance than this; it strikes, sir, at the very root, sir, of your constitution; for, sir, what does this motion imply? it implies that porter, a whole∣some domestic manufacture, is to be prohibited at once, and for what, sir? for a foreign per∣nicious commodity. I had, sir, formerly the honour, in conjunction with my learned friend in the leather apron, to expel sherbet from a∣mongst us, as I looked upon lemons as a fatal and foreign fruit; and can it be thought, sir, that I will sit silent to this? No, sir, I will put my shoulders strongly against it, I will oppose it <HI>manibus totibus</HI>. For should this proposal pre∣vail, it will not end here: fatal, give me leave to say, will I foresee be the issue; and I shan't be surprised, in a few days, to hear from the same quarter, a motion for the expulsion of gin, and a premium for the importation of whisky.</P>

<SPEAKER>ANVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, Mr. President, that if we consider this case in its utmost extent—<STAGE><HI>all the members cough and blow their noses again</HI></STAGE> I say, sir, I will. Nay, I insist on being heard. If any gentleman has any thing to say any where else, I'll hear him.</P>

<SPEAKER>SLAUGHTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I declare it, at the bare hearing of this here motion, I am all over in a sweat; for my part I can't think what gentlemen mean by talking in that there manner; not but I likes that every man should deliver his mind; I does mine, it has been ever my way, and when a member opposes me I like him the bet∣ter
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
for it, it's right, I am pleas'd, he can't please me more, it is as it should he, and tho' I differ from the honourable gentleman in the flannel night-cap over the way, yet I am pleased to hear him say what he thinks; for, sir, as I said, it is always my rule to say what I think, right or wrong—<STAGE><HI>a loud laugh</HI></STAGE> ay, ay, gentlemen may laugh, with all my heart, I am used to it, I dont mind it a farthing, but, sir, with regard to that there motion, I en∣tirely agree with my worthy friend with the pewter pot at his mouth. Now, sir, I would fain ask any gentleman this here question, can any thing in nature be more natural for an Englishman than porter? I declare, Mr. Pre∣sident, I think it the most wholesomest liquor in the world. But if it must be a change, let us change it for rum, a wholesome palatable liquor, a liquor that—in short, Mr. President, I don't know such a liquor. Ay, gentlemen may stare; I say, and I say it upon my con∣science, I don't know such a liquor. Besides, I think there is in this here affair a point of law, which I shall leave to the consideration of the learned, and for that there reason, I shall take up no more of your time.</P>

<P>I get up to the point of law. And tho', sir, I am bred to the business, I can't say I am prepared for this question. But tho' this us∣quebaugh as a dram may not (by name) be subject to a duty, yet it is my opinion, or ra∣ther belief, it will be consider'd, as in the case of horses, to come under the article of dry'd goods—But I move that another day this point be debated.</P>

<P>And now, ladies and gentlemen, having pro∣duced to you glaring proofs of our great ability in every species of oratory, having manifested in the persons of our pupils, our infinite ad∣dress in conveying out knowledge to others,

we shall close our morning's lecture, instituted for the public good, with a proposal for the particular improvement of individuals. We are ready to give private instructions to any reverend gentleman in his probationary sermon for a lectureship; to young barristers who have causes to open, or motions to make; to all candidates for the sock or buskin; or to the new members of any of those oratorical societies with which this metropolis is at present so plentifully stock'd.</P>
