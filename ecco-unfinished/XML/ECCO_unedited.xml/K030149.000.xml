<P>THE following Trifle is not a Transla∣tion from the French, nor any other Lan∣guage:—I have an exclusive right to all it's imperfections.</P>
<P>I am far from endeavouring to vitiate the taste of the Town, and over-run the Stage with Romance, and Legends:—but English Children, both old and young, are disappointed without a Pantomime, at Christmas;—and, a Pantomime not being forth-coming, in Drury-Lane, I was pre∣vail'd upon to make out the subsequent Sketch, expressly for that season, to sup∣ply the place of Harlequinade:—Acci∣dents, however, retarded it's representa∣tion, a fortnight beyond it's intended ap∣pearance.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>I feel nothing upon my conscience in having substituted a Blue Beard for a Black Face.—I have not attempted to make Magick usurp that space of the Eve∣ning's Entertainment much better occu∣pied by Dramas of instruction, and pro∣bability. I have kept my Enchantment within the limits where rational minds, without pedantry, have not only long to∣lerated it, but have found pleasure in un∣bending with it, after they have been more solidly engaged. In short my Syllabub does not make it's appearance until the substan∣tial part of the repast is over.—I am care∣less, therefore, of those sapient Gentle∣men, who, in the words of <HI>Gresset</HI>,
<Q><L>"Port<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt leur petite sentence"</L>
<L>"Sur la rime, &amp; sur les Auteurs,"</L>
<L>"Adec autant de connoissance"</L>
<L>"Qu'un aveugle en a des couleurs."</L></Q>
But, I could tell such Gentlemen that I have done some good.—I have given an
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
opportunity to Mr. KELLY of fully esta∣blishing his reputation, as a Musical Com∣poser, with a Publick, whose favour he has long, and deservedly experienced as a Singer. Crowded audiences have testi∣fied the most strong, and decided appro∣bation of his original Musick, in <HI>Blue-Beard</HI>; and amply applauded his taste, and judgment, in Selection.</P>
<P>Dully as the matter of fact may be sta∣ted, I feel gratified in relating this Truism of a worthy and industrious man.</P>
<P>Add to this, I have brought forward <HI>Young Greenwood</HI> (a Scene-Painter of Nine∣teen!) to shew Design, and Execution of uncommon promise:—</P>
<P>And <HI>Johnstone</HI>, a <HI>classical</HI> Machinist, (a <HI>rara avis</HI>, alas! in Theatres) has added another wreath to his well-earn'd laurels.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>I have made the Dialogue and Songs (such as they are) subservient to the above-mention'd Artists:—and, no men, surely, ever made better use of a vehicle.</P>
<P>I have only, now, to say that I heartily thank the Performers for the kind, and zealous exertions, of their well-known ta∣lents:—and that it would be as ungrateful as impudent to deny that I took the out∣line of my Story from the works of the ce∣lebrated Mrs. GOOSE:—at whose feet with all due deference I beg to lay my present weighty labour;—and I do hereby inscribe to her the Grand Dramatick Romance of <HI>Blue-Beard</HI>.</P>
