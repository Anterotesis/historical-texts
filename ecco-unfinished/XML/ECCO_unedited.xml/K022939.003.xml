<LG>
<L>FATE gave the Word; the cruel arrow sped;</L>
<L>And POPE lies number'd with the mighty Dead!</L>
<L>Resign'd he fell; superior to the dart,</L>
<L>That quench'd its rage in YOURS and BRITAIN'S Heart:</L>
<L>YOU mourn: but BRITAIN, lull'd in rest profound,</L>
<L>(Unconscious Britain!) slumbers o'er her wound.</L>
<L>Exulting Dulness ey'd the setting Light,</L>
<L>And flapp'd her wing, impatient for the Night:</L>
<L>Rouz'd at the signal, Guilt collects her train,</L>
<L>And counts the Triumphs of her growing Reign:</L>
<L N="11">With inextinguishable rage they burn;</L>
<L>And Snake-hung ENVY hisses o'er his Urn:</L>
<L>Th' envenom'd Monster spit their deadly foam,</L>
<L>To blast the Laurel that surrounds his Tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But YOU, O WARBURTON! whose eye refin'd</L>
<L>Can see the greatness of an honest mind;</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="10"/>
Can see each Virtue and each Grace unite,</L>
<L>And taste the Raptures of a <HI>pure</HI> Delight;</L>
<L>You visit oft his awful Page with Care,</L>
<L>And view that bright Assemblage treasur'd there;</L>
<L>You trace the Chain that links his deep Design,</L>
<L>And pour new Lustre on the glowing Line.</L>
<L>Yet deign to hear the efforts of a Muse,</L>
<L>Whose eye, not wing, his ardent flight pursues;</L>
<L N="25">Intent from this great Archetype to draw</L>
<L>SATIRE'S bright Form, and fix her equal Law;</L>
<L>Pleas'd if from hence th'unlearn'd may comprehend,</L>
<L>And rev'rence HIS and SATIRE'S gen'rous End.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN ev'ry Breast there burns an active flame,</L>
<L N="30">The Love of Glory, or the Dread of Shame:</L>
<L>The Passion ONE, tho' various it appear,</L>
<L>As brighten'd into Hope, or dimm'd by Fear.</L>
<L>The lisping Infant, and the hoary Sire,</L>
<L>And Youth and Manhood feel the heart-born fire:</L>
<L>The Charms of Praise the Coy, the Modest wooe,</L>
<L N="36">And only fly, that Glory may pursue:</L>
<L>She, Pow'r resistless, rules the wise and great▪</L>
<L>Bends ev'n reluctant Hermits at her feet;</L>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="11"/>
Haunts the proud City, and the lowly Shade,</L>
<L N="40">And sways alike the Scepter and the Spade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus Heav'n in Pity wakes the friendly Flame,</L>
<L>To urge Mankind on Deeds that merit Fame:</L>
<L>But Man, vain Man, in folly only wise,</L>
<L>Rejects the Manna sent him from the Skies:</L>
<L N="45">With rapture hears corrupted Passion's call,</L>
<L>Still proudly prone to mingle with the stall.</L>
<L>As each deceitful shadow tempts his view,</L>
<L>He for the <HI>imag'd</HI> Substance quits the <HI>true;</HI></L>
<L>Eager to catch the visionary Prize,</L>
<L N="50">In quest of Glory plunges deep in Vice;</L>
<L>'Till madly zealous, impotently vain,</L>
<L>He forfeits ev'ry Praise he pants to gain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus still imperious NATURE plies her part;</L>
<L>And still her Dictates work in ev'ry heart.</L>
<L N="55">Each Pow'r that sov'reign Nature bids enjoy,</L>
<L>Man may corrupt, but Man can ne'er destroy.</L>
<L>Like mighty rivers, with resistless force</L>
<L>The Passions rage, obstructed in their course;</L>
<L>Swell to new heights, forbidden paths explore,</L>
<L>And drown those Virtues which they fed before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="viii" REF="12"/>
<L>And sure, the deadliest Foe to Virtue's flame,</L>
<L>Our worst of Evils, is <HI>perverted Shame.</HI></L>
<L>Beneath this load what abject numbers groan,</L>
<L>Th' entangled Slaves to folly not their own!</L>
<L N="65">Meanly by fashionable fear oppress'd,</L>
<L>We seek our Virtues in each other's breast;</L>
<L>Blind to ourselves, adopt each foreign Vice,</L>
<L>Another's weakness, int'rest, or caprice.</L>
<L>Each Fool to low Ambition, poorly great,</L>
<L N="70">That pines in splendid wretchedness of state,</L>
<L>Tir'd in the treach'rous Chase, would nobly yield,</L>
<L>And but for Shame, like SYLLA, quit the field:</L>
<L>The Daemon <HI>Shame</HI> paints strong the ridicule,</L>
<L><HI>And whispers close,</HI> "the World will call you Fool."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold, yon Wretch, by impious fashion driv'n,</L>
<L>Believes and trembles while he scoffs at Heav'n.</L>
<L>By weakness strong, and bold thro' fear alone,</L>
<L>He dreads the sneer by shallow Coxcombs thrown;</L>
<L>Dauntless <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rsues the path <HI>Spinoza</HI> trod;</L>
<L N="80">To Man a <HI>Coward,</HI> and a <HI>Brave</HI> to God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="ix" REF="13"/>
<L>Faith, Justice, Heav'n itself now quit their hold,</L>
<L>When to false Fame the captiv'd heart is sold:</L>
<L>Hence, blind to truth, relentless <HI>Cato</HI> dy'd;</L>
<L>Nought could subdue his Virtue, but his Pride.</L>
<L N="85">Hence chaste <HI>Lucretia's</HI> Innocence betray'd</L>
<L>Fell by that Honour which was meant its aid.</L>
<L>Thus Virtue sinks beneath unnumber'd woes,</L>
<L>When Passions, born her friends, revolt her foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence SATIRE'S pow'r: 'Tis her corrective part,</L>
<L N="90">To calm the wild disorders of the heart.</L>
<L>She points the arduous height where Glory lies,</L>
<L>And teaches mad Ambition to be wise:</L>
<L>In the dark bosom wakes the fair desire,</L>
<L>Draws good from ill, a brighter flame from fire;</L>
<L N="95">Strips black Oppression of her gay disguise,</L>
<L>And bids the Hag in native horror rise;</L>
<L>Strikes tow'ring Pride and lawless Rapine dead,</L>
<L>And plants the wreath on Virtue's awful head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor boasts the Muse a vain imagin'd Pow'r,</L>
<L N="100">Tho' oft she mourn those ills she cannot cure.</L>
<L><PB N="x" REF="14"/>
The Worthy court her, and the Worthless fear;</L>
<L>Who shun her piercing eye, that eye revere.</L>
<L>Her awful voice the Vain and Vile obey,</L>
<L N="104">And ev'ry foe to Wisdom feels her sway.</L>
<L>Smarts, Pedants, as she smiles, no more are vain;</L>
<L>Desponding Fops resign the <HI>clouded cane:</HI></L>
<L>Hush'd at her voice, pert Folly's self is still,</L>
<L>And Dulness wonders while she drops her quill.</L>
<L>Like the arm'd BEE, with art most subtly true,</L>
<L>From poys'nous Vice she draws a healing dew:</L>
<L N="111">Weak are the ties that civil arts can find,</L>
<L>To quell the ferment of the tainted mind:</L>
<L>Cunning evades, securely wrapt in wiles;</L>
<L>And force strong-sinew'd rends th' unequal toils:</L>
<L N="115">The stream of vice impetuous drives along,</L>
<L>Too deep for Policy, for Pow'r too strong.</L>
<L>Ev'n fair Religion, Native of the skies,</L>
<L>Scorn'd by the Crowd, seeks refuge with the Wise;</L>
<L>The Crowd with laughter spurns her awful train,</L>
<L N="120">And Mercy courts, and Justice frowns in vain.</L>
<L>But SATIRE'S shaft can pierce the harden'd breast:</L>
<L>She plays a <HI>ruling Passion</HI> on the rest:</L>
<L><PB N="xi" REF="15"/>
Undaunted storms the batt'ry of his pride,</L>
<L>And awes the <HI>Brave</HI> that Earth and Heav'n defy'd.</L>
<L N="125">When fell Corruption, by her vassals crown'd,</L>
<L>Derides fall'n Justice prostrate on the ground;</L>
<L>Swift to redress an injur'd People's groan,</L>
<L>Bold SATIRE shakes the Tyrant on her throne;</L>
<L>Pow'rful as Death, defies the sordid train,</L>
<L N="130">And Slaves and Sycophants surround in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But with the friends of Vice, the foes of SATIRE,</L>
<L>All truth is spleen; all just reproof, Ill-nature.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well may they dread the Muse's fatal skill;</L>
<L>Well may they tremble when she draws her quill:</L>
<L N="135">Her magic quill, that, like ITHURIEL'S spear,</L>
<L>Reveals the cloven hoof, or lengthen'd ear:</L>
<L>Bids Vice and Folly take their natural shapes,</L>
<L>Turns Duchesses to strumpets, Beaux to apes;</L>
<L>Drags the vile Whisp'rer from his dark abode,</L>
<L N="140">Till all the Daemon starts up from the toad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O sordid maxim, form'd to screen the vile,</L>
<L>That true good-nature still must wear a smile!</L>
<L>In frowns array'd her beauties stronger rise,</L>
<L>When love of Virtue wakes her scorn of Vice:</L>
<L N="145"><PB N="xii" REF="16"/>
Where Justice calls, 'tis Cruelty to save;</L>
<L>And 'tis the Law's good-nature hangs the Knave.</L>
<L>Who combats Virtue's foe is Virtue's friend:</L>
<L>Then judge of SATIRE'S merit by her end:</L>
<L>To Guilt alone her vengeance stands confin'd,</L>
<L N="150">The object of her love is all Mankind.</L>
<L>Scarce more the friend of Man, the wise must own</L>
<L>Ev'n ALLEN'S bounteous hand, than SATIRE'S frown:</L>
<L>This to chastise, as That to bless, was giv'n;</L>
<L>Alike the faithful Ministers of Heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="155">Oft in unfeeling hearts the shaft is spent:</L>
<L>Tho' strong th' example, weak the punishment.</L>
<L>They least are pain'd, who merit satire most;</L>
<L>Folly the <HI>Laureat's,</HI> Vice was <HI>Chartres'</HI> boast:</L>
<L>Then where's the wrong, to gibbet high the name</L>
<L N="160">Of Fools and Knaves already dead to shame?</L>
<L>Oft SATIRE acts the faithful Surgeon's part;</L>
<L>Gen'rous and kind tho' painful is her art:</L>
<L>With caution bold, she only strikes to heal,</L>
<L>Tho' Folly raves to break the friendly steel.</L>
<L N="165">Then sure no fault impartial SATIRE knows,</L>
<L>Kind ev'n in Vengeance, kind to Virtue's foes.</L>
<L>Whose is the crime, the scandal too be theirs:</L>
<L>The Knave and Fool are their own Libellers.</L>

<HEAD>THE DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING proposed to write some pieces on Hu∣man Life and Manners, such as (to use my lord Bacon's expression) <HI>come home to Men's Business and Bo∣soms,</HI> I thought it more satisfactory to begin with con∣sidering <HI>Man</HI> in the abstract, his <HI>Nature</HI> and his <HI>State;</HI> since, to prove any moral duty, to enforce any moral precept, or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature whatsoever, it is necessary first to know what <HI>condition</HI> and <HI>relation</HI> it is placed in, and what is the proper <HI>end</HI> and <HI>purpose</HI> of its <HI>being.</HI></P>
<P>The science of Human Nature is, like all other sciences, reduced to a <HI>few clear points:</HI> There are not <HI>many certain truths</HI> in this world. It is therefore in the Anatomy of the mind as in that of the Body; more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and perceptible parts, than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels, the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation. The <HI>disputes</HI> are all upon these last, and, I will venture to say, they have less sharpened the <HI>wits</HI> than the <HI>hearts</HI> of men against each other, and have diminished the practice, more than advanced the theory, of Morality. If I could flatter myself that this Essay has any merit, it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seem∣ingly opposite, in passing over terms utterly unintelli∣gible, and in forming a <HI>temperate</HI> yet not <HI>inconsistent,</HI> and a <HI>short</HI> yet not <HI>imperfect</HI> system of Ethics.</P>
<P>This I might have done in prose; but I chose verse, and even rhyme, for two reasons. The one will ap∣pear obvious; that principles, maxims, or precepts so written, both strike the reader more strongly at first,
<PB REF="38"/>
and are more easily retained by him afterwards: The other may seem odd, but is true, I found I could ex∣press them more <HI>shortly</HI> this way than in prose itself; and nothing is more certain, than that much of the <HI>force</HI> as well as <HI>grace</HI> of arguments or instructions, de∣pends on their <HI>conciseness.</HI> I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in <HI>detail,</HI> without becoming dry and tedious; or more <HI>poetically,</HI> without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament, without wandring from the precision, or breaking the chain of reasoning: If any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them, I freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity.</P>
<P>What is now published, is only to be considered as a <HI>general Map</HI> of MAN, marking out no more than the <HI>greater parts,</HI> their <HI>extent,</HI> their <HI>limits,</HI> and their <HI>con∣nection,</HI> but leaving the particular to be more fully de∣lineated in the charts which are to follow. Consequent∣ly, these Epistles in their progress (if I have health and leisure to make any progress) will be less dry, and more susceptible of poetical ornament. I am here only opening the <HI>fountains,</HI> and clearing the passage. To deduce the <HI>rivers,</HI> to follow them in their course, and to observe their effects, may be a task more agree∣able.</P>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Opening of this poem, in fifteen lines, is taken up in giving an account of the Subjećt; which, agreeably to the title, is an ESSAY on MAN, or a Philosophical Enquiry into his <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>End,</HI> his <HI>Passions</HI> and <HI>Pursuits.</HI></P>
<P>The Exordium relates to the whole work, of which the <HI>Essay on Man</HI> was only the first book. The 6th, 7th, and 8th lines allude to the subjects of this <HI>Essay,</HI> viz. the general Order and Design of Providence; the Constitution of the human Mind; the origin, use, and end of the Passions and Affections, both selfish and social; and the wrong pursuits of Power, Pleasure, and Happiness. The 10th, 11th, 12th, &amp;c. have relation to the subjects of the books intended to follow, <HI>viz.</HI> the Characters and Capacities of Men, and the Limits of Learning and Ignorance. The 13th and 14th, to the Knowledge of Mankind, and the various Manners of the age.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="43"/>
Next, in line 16, he tells us with what design he wrote, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><L>To vindicate the ways of God to Man.</L></Q>
The Men he writes against, he frequently informs us, are such as <HI>weigh their opinion against Providence</HI> (℣ 114) such as <HI>cry, if Man's unhappy, God's unjust</HI> (℣ 118) or such as fall into the notion, <HI>that Vice and Virtue there is none at all</HI> (Ep. ii. ℣ 212) This occasions the poet to divide his vindication of the ways of God into two parts. In the first of which he gives direct answers to those objections which libertine Men, on a view of the disorders arising from the perversity of the human will, have in∣tended against Providence. And in the second, he obviates all those objections, by a true delineation of human Nature; or a general, but exact, <HI>map of Man.</HI> The first epistle is employed in the management of the first part of this dispute; and the
<PB N="5" REF="44"/>
three following in the management of the second. So that this whole book constitutes a complete <HI>Essay on Man,</HI> written for the best purpose, <HI>to vindicate the ways of God.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 17. <HI>Say first, of God above, or Man below, &amp;c.]</HI> The poet having declared his <HI>Subject,</HI> his <HI>End of writing,</HI> and the <HI>Quality of his Adversaries,</HI> proceeds (from ℣ 16 to 23) to in∣struct us, <HI>from whence</HI> he intends to draw his arguments; namely, from the <HI>visible</HI> things of God in this system to demonstrate the <HI>invisible</HI> things of God, his <HI>eternal Power</HI> and <HI>God-head:</HI> And
<PB N="6" REF="45" MS="y"/>
<HI>why?</HI> because we can <HI>reason only from what we know,</HI> and as we <HI>know</HI> no more of <HI>Man</HI> than what we see of his station here; so we know no more of <HI>God</HI> than what we see of his dispensa∣tions in this station; being able to trace him no further than to the limits of our own system. This naturally leads the poet to ex∣probrate the miserable Folly and Impiety of pretending to pry into, and call in question the profound dispensations of Providence: Which reproof contains (from ℣ 22 to 43) a sublime description of the Omniscience of God, and the miserable Blindness and Presumption of Man.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="46"/>
VER. 43. <HI>Of systems possible,</HI> &amp;c.] So far his modest and so∣ber Introduction; in which he truly observes, that no wisdom less than omniscient
<Q><L>Can tell why Heav'n <HI>has</HI> made us as we are.</L></Q>
Yet, though we cannot discover the <HI>particular</HI> reasons for this mode of our existence, we may be assured in <HI>general</HI> that it is <HI>right.</HI> For now, entering upon his argument, he lays down this self-evident proposition as the foundation of his Thesis,
<PB N="8" REF="47" MS="y"/>
which he reasonably supposes will be allowed him, <HI>That, of all possible systems, infinite wisdom hath formed the best</HI> (℣ 43, 44) From whence he draws two consequences:</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>first</HI> (from ℣ 44 to 51) is, that as the best system can∣not but be such a one as hath no inconnected Void; such a one in which there is a perfect coherence and gradual subordi∣nation in all its parts; there must needs be, in some part or other of the scale of reasoning life, such a creature as MAN: Which reduces the dispute to this absurd question, <HI>Whether God has placed him wrong?</HI></P>
<P>VER. 51. <HI>Respecting Man,</HI> &amp;c.] It being shewn that MAN, <HI>the Subject of his enquiry,</HI> has a necessary place in such a system as this is confessed to be; and it being evident, that the abuse of Free-will, from whence proceeds all moral evil, is the cer∣tain effect of such a creature's existence; the next question will be, How these evils can be accounted for, consistently with the idea we have of God's attributes? Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>second</HI> consequence he draws from his principle, <HI>That of all possible systems, infinite wisdom has formed the best,</HI> is, that whatever is wrong in our private system, is right as rela∣tive to the whole:</P>
<Q><L>Respecting Man, whatever wrong we call,</L>
<L><HI>May, must</HI> be right, as relative to <HI>ALL.</HI></L></Q>
<P>That it <HI>may,</HI> he proves (from ℣ 52 to 61) by shewing in what consists the difference between the <HI>systematic</HI> works of God,
<PB N="9" REF="48"/>
and those of Man; <HI>viz.</HI> that, in the latter, a thousand move∣ments scarce gain one purpose; in the former, one movement gains many purposes. So that
<Q><L>—Man, who here seems <HI>principal</HI> alone,</L>
<L>Perhaps acts <HI>second</HI> to some sphere unknown.</L></Q>
And acting thus, the appearances of <HI>wrong</HI> in the <HI>partial</HI> system, may be <HI>right</HI> in the <HI>universal:</HI> For

<P>VER. 61. <HI>When the proud steed</HI> &amp;c.] From all this he draws a general conclusion (from ℣ 60 to 91) that, as what has been said is sufficient to vindicate the ways of Providence, Man should rest submissive and content, and confess every thing to be disposed for the best; that to pretend to enquire into the <HI>manner</HI> how God conducts this wonderful scheme to its com∣pletion, is as absurd as to imagine that the horse and ox shall
<PB N="10" REF="49" MS="y"/>
ever come to comprehend why they undergo such different <HI>ma∣nage</HI> and <HI>fortunes</HI> in the hand of Man; nay, that such know∣ledge, if communicated, would be even <HI>pernicious</HI> to Man, and
<PB N="11" REF="50"/>
make him <HI>neglect</HI> or <HI>desert</HI> his Duty here. This he illustrates by an instance in the lamb, which is happy in not knowing the fate that attends it from the butcher; and from thence takes
<PB N="12" REF="51"/>
occasion to observe, that God is the equal master of all his creatures, and provides for the proper happiness of <HI>each</HI> being.</P>
<P>VER. 91. <HI>Hope humbly then;</HI> &amp;c.] But now the objector is supposed to put in, and say, You tell us indeed, that all things will terminate in good; but we see ourselves surrounded with present Evil; and yet you forbid us all inquiry into the manner how we are to be extricated; and, in a word, leave us in a very disconsolate condition. Not so, replies the poet, you may reasonably, if you so please, receive much comfort from the HOPE of a happy futurity; a <HI>Hope</HI> implanted in the human breast for this very purpose by God himself, as an earnest of that Bliss, which here perpetually flying us, is reserved for the good Man hereafter. The reason why the poet chuses to insist on this proof of a future state, in preference to others, is in order to give his system (which is founded in a sublime and improved <HI>Platonism)</HI> the higher grace of uniformity. For HOPE was <HI>Plato's</HI> peculiar argument for a future state; and the words here employed—<HI>the soul uneasy</HI> &amp;c. his particular ex∣pression. The poet in this place, therefore, says in express terms, that <HI>God gave us Hope to supply that future bliss, which he at present keeps hid from us.</HI> In his second epistle, ℣ 274, he goes still farther, and says, this HOPE quits us not even at Death, when every thing mortal drops from us:
<Q><L>Hope travels thro', nor quits us when we die.</L></Q>
And, in the fourth epistle, he shews how the same HOPE is a <HI>proof</HI> of a future state, from the consideration of God's giving man no appetite in vain, or what he did not intend should be satisfied;</P>
<LG>
<L>He sees, why Nature plants in Man alone</L>
<L>Hope of known bliss, and Faith in bliss unknown:</L>

VER 99. <HI>Lo, the poor Indian!</HI> &amp;c.] The poet, as we said, having bid Man comfort himself with expectation of future hap∣piness, shewn him that this HOPE is an earnest of it, and put in one very necessary caution,
<Q><L>Hope <HI>humbly</HI> then, with <HI>trembling</HI> pinions soar;</L></Q>
provoked at those miscreants whom he afterwards (Ep. iii. ℣ 263) describes as building <HI>Hell on Spite, and Heaven on Pride,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="54"/>
he upbraids them (from ℣ 99 to 112) with the example of the poor Indian, to whom also Nature hath given this <HI>common</HI> HOPE <HI>of Mankind:</HI> But, tho' his untutored mind had betrayed him into many childish fancies concerning the nature of that future state, yet he is so far from excluding any part of his own species (a vice which could proceed only from vain science, which <HI>puffeth up)</HI> that he humanely admits even his <HI>faithful dog to bear him company.</HI></P>

<PB N="16" REF="55" MS="y"/>
of providence (from ℣ 112 to 122) and shews them, that complaints against the <HI>established order of things</HI> begin in the <HI>highest absurdity,</HI> from misapplied <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> and end in the <HI>highest impiety,</HI> in an attempt to degrade the God of heaven, and assume his place:

<P><PB N="17" REF="56"/>
From these men the poet now turns to his friend, and (from ℣ 123 to 130) remarks, that the ground of all this extravagance is <HI>Pride;</HI> which, more or less, infects the whole Species; shews the ill effects of it, in the case of the fallen Angels; and ob∣serves, that even <HI>wishing</HI> to invert the laws of Order, is a lower species of their crime: Then brings an instance of one of the effects of Pride, which is the folly of thinking every thing made <HI>solely</HI> for the use of Man; without the least regard to any other of God's creatures:</P>
<Q><L>Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>The ridicule of imagining the <HI>greater portions</HI> of the material system to be solely for the use of Man, Philosophy has sufficiently exposed: And Common sense, as the poet shews, instructs us to know that our fellow-creatures, placed by Providence the joint∣inhabitants of this globe, are designed by Providence to be joint∣sharers with us of its blessings:</P>

<P>VER. 141. <HI>But errs not Nature from this gracious end,]</HI> The author comes next to the confirmation of his Thesis, That <HI>par∣tial moral Evil</HI> is <HI>universal Good;</HI> but introduceth it with a proper argument to abate our wonder at the phaenomenon of moral Evil, which argument he builds on a concession of his adversaries: If we ask you, says he (from ℣ 140 to 150) whe∣ther Nature doth not err from the gracious purpose of its creator, when plagues, earthquakes, and tempests unpeople whole regions at a time; you readily answer No. For that God acts by ge∣neral, and not by particular laws; and that the course of matter and motion must be necessarily subject to some irregularities, be∣cause nothing is created perfect. I then ask why you should expect this perfection in Man? If you own that the <HI>great end</HI> of <HI>God</HI> (notwithstanding all this deviation) be <HI>general happiness,</HI> then 'tis <HI>Nature,</HI> and not God, that deviates; and do you ex∣pect greater constancy in Man?</P>
<P><Q><L>Then Nature deviates; and can Man do less?</L></Q>
<PB N="19" REF="58"/>
That is, if Nature, or the inanimate system (on which God hath imposed his laws, which it obeys as a machine obeys the hand of the workman) may in course of time deviate from its first direction, as the best philosophy shews it may; where is the wonder that Man, who was created a free Agent, and hath it in his power every moment to transgress the eternal rule of Right, should sometimes go out of Order?</P>
<P>VER. 151. <HI>As much that end</HI> &amp;c.] Having thus shown how moral evil came into the world, namely, by <HI>Man's abuse of his own free-will;</HI> he comes to the point, the <HI>confirmation</HI> of his thesis, by shewing how <HI>moral</HI> evil promotes good; and employs the <HI>same</HI> concessions of his adversaries, concerning <HI>natural</HI> evil, to illustrate it.</P>
<P N="1">1. He shews it tends to the <HI>good</HI> of the <HI>whole,</HI> or <HI>Universe</HI> (from ℣ 151 to 164) and this by analogy. You own, says he▪ that storms and tempests, clouds, rain, heat, and variety of sea∣sons
<PB N="20" REF="59"/>
are necessary (notwithstanding the accidental evil they bring with them) to the health and plenty of this Globe; why then should you suppose there is not the same use, with regard to the Universe, in a Borgia and a Catiline? But you say you can see the one and not the other. You say right: one terminates in this <HI>system,</HI> the other refers to the <HI>whole:</HI> of which none are capable of judging but the great Author of it himself: For, says the poet, in another place,</P>

VER. 165. <HI>Better for us,</HI> &amp;c.] But, secondly, to strengthen the foregoing <HI>analogical</HI> argument, and to make the wisdom and goodness of God still more apparent, he observes (from ℣ 165
<PB N="22" REF="61"/>
to 172) that <HI>moral evil</HI> is not only productive of <HI>good</HI> to the <HI>whole,</HI> but is even productive of <HI>good in our own system.</HI> It might, says he, perhaps, appear better to us, that there were nothing in this world but <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>virtue:</HI></P>
<Q><L>That never air or ocean felt the wind;</L>
<L>That never passion discompos'd the mind.</L></Q>
<P>But then consider, that as our <HI>material system</HI> is supported by the strife of its elementary particles; so is our <HI>intellectual system</HI> by the conflict of our Passions, which are the elements of hu∣man action.</P>
<P>In a word, as without the benefit of tempestuous winds, both air and ocean would stagnate, corrupt, and spread universal con∣tagion throughout all the ranks of animals that inhabit, or are supported by, them; so, without the benefit of the Passions, such virtue as was merely the effect of the absence of those Passions, would be a lifeless calm, a stoical Apathy:</P>
<Q><L>Contracted all, retiring to the breast:</L>
<L>But health of Mind is <HI>Exercise,</HI> not <HI>Rest.</HI> <BIBL>Ep. ii. ℣ 103.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>Therefore, instead of regarding the Conflict of the elements, and the Passions of the mind as disorders, you ought to consider them as part of the <HI>general order</HI> of Providence: And that they are so, appears from their always preserving the same unvaried course, throughout all ages, from the creation to the present time:</P>
<Q><L>The <HI>gen'ral order,</HI> since the Whole began,</L>
<L>Is kept in <HI>Nature,</HI> and is kept in <HI>Man.</HI></L></Q>
<P>We see, therefore, it would be doing great injustice to our author to suspect that he intended, by this, to give any encourage∣ment to Vice. His system, as all his Ethic Epistles shew, is this: That the <HI>Passions,</HI> for the reasons given above, are ne∣cessary to the support of Virtue; That, indeed, the Passions in excess produce Vice, which is, in its own Nature, the greatest of all Evils, and comes into the world from the abuse of Man's free-will; but that God, in his infinite wisdom and goodness, devi∣ously
<PB N="23" REF="62"/>
turns the natural bias of its malignity to the advancement of human happiness, and makes it productive of general Good:</P>
<Q><L>TH'ETERNAL ART EDUCES GOOD FROM ILL. <BIBL>Ep. ii. ℣ 175.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>This set against what we have observed of the Poet's doctrine of a <HI>future State,</HI> will furnish us with an instance of his <HI>steering</HI> (as he well expresses it in his preface) <HI>between Doctrines seem∣ingly opposite: If his Essay has any merit, he thinks it is in this.</HI> And doubtless it is uncommon merit to reject the extravagances of every System, and take in only what is rational and real.</P>
<P>The <HI>Characteristics</HI> and the <HI>Fable of the Bees</HI> are two seem∣ingly inconsistent systems; the extravagancy of the first is in giving a scheme of <HI>Virtue without Religion;</HI> and of the latter, in giving a scheme of <HI>Religion without Virtue.</HI> These our Poet leaves to Any that will take them up; but agrees however so far with the first, that <Q>“Virtue would be worth having, though itself was its only reward;”</Q> and so far with the latter, that <Q>“God makes Evil, against its nature, productive of Good.”</Q></P>
<P>VER. 173. <HI>What would this Man?</HI> &amp;c.] Having thus justified Providence in its <HI>permission</HI> of partial MORAL EVIL, he employs the remaining part of his Epistle in vindicating it from the im∣putation
<PB N="24" REF="63"/>
of certain supposed NATURAL EVILS. For now he shews (from ℣ 172 to 207) that though the complaint of his adversaries against Providence be on pretence of <HI>real moral evils;</HI> yet, at bottom, it all proceeds from their impatience under <HI>ima∣ginary natural ones,</HI> the issue of a depraved appetite for visionary advantages, which if Man had, they would be either <HI>useless</HI> or <HI>pernicious</HI> to him, as unsuitable to his state, or repugnant to his condition. Though God (says he) hath so bountifully bestowed, on Man, Faculties little less than <HI>angelic,</HI> yet he ungratefully grasps at higher; and then, extravagant in another extreme, with a passion as ridiculous as that is impious, envies even the peculiar accommodations of <HI>brutes.</HI> But here his own princi∣ples shew his folly. He supposes them all made for his use: Now what use could he have of them, when he had robbed them of all their qualities? Qualities, distributed with the highest wisdom, as they are divided at present; but which, if bestowed according to the froward humour of these childish complainers, would be found to be, every where, either <HI>wanting</HI> or <HI>super∣fluous.</HI> But even with these brutal qualities, Man would not only be no gainer, but a considerable loser; as is shewn, in
<PB N="25" REF="64" MS="y"/>
explaining the consequences that would follow from his having his sensations in that exquisite degree, in which this or that animal is observed to possess them.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="67"/>
VER. 207. <HI>Far as Creation's ample range extends,]</HI> He tells us next (from ℣ 206 to 233) that the complying with such extravagant desires would not only be useless and pernicious to Man, but would be breaking into the Order, and deforming the Beauty of God's Creation, in which <HI>this</HI> animal is subject to <HI>that,</HI> and every one to Man; who by his Reason enjoys the sum of all their powers.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="69"/>
VER. 233. <HI>See, thro' this air,</HI> &amp;c.] And farther (from ℣ 232 to 267) that this breaking the order of things, which, as a link or chain, connects all beings from the highest to the lowest, would unavoidably be attended with the destruction of the Uni∣verse: For that the several parts of it must at least compose as entire and harmonious a whole, as the parts of a human body, can hardly be doubted: Yet we see what confusion it would make in our frame, if the members were set upon invading each other's office:
<Q><L>What if the foot, &amp;c. <BIBL>℣ 259, &amp;c.</BIBL></L></Q>
Who will not acknowledge, therefore, that so harmonious a
<PB N="29" REF="70"/>
connection in the disposition of things, as is here described, is transcendently beautiful? But the <HI>Fatalists</HI> suppose such an one.—What then? Is the First Free Agent, the great Cause of all things, debarred from a contrivance so exquisite, because some Men, to set up their idol, Fate, absurdly represent it as presiding over such a system?</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="72"/>
VER. 267. <HI>All are but parts of one stupendous whole,]</HI> Having thus given a representation of God's creation, as <HI>one entire whole,</HI> where all the parts have a necessary dependence on, and relation to each other, and where every Particular works and concurs to the perfection of the whole; as such a system would be thought above the reach of vulgar ideas; to reconcile it to common con∣ceptions, he shews (from ℣ 266 to 281) that God is equally and intimately present to every sort of <HI>substance,</HI> to every par∣ticle of <HI>matter,</HI> and in every instant of <HI>being;</HI> which eases the labouring imagination, and makes it expect no less, from such a <HI>Presence,</HI> than such a <HI>Dispensation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="75"/>
VER. 281. <HI>Cease then, nor Order Imperfection name:]</HI> And now the poet, as he had promised, having <HI>vindicated the ways of God to Man,</HI> concludes (from ℣ 280 to the end) that, from what had been said, it appears, that the very things we blame, con∣tribute to our Happiness, either as Particulars, or as Parts of the Universal system; that our State of Ignorance was allotted to us out of compassion; that yet we have as much Know∣ledge as is sufficient to shew us that we are, and always shall be, as blest as we can bear; for that NATURE is neither a <HI>Stratonic</HI> chain of blind Causes and Effects,
<Q><L><HI>(All Nature</HI> is but <HI>Art,</HI> unknown to thee)</L>
<L>nor yet the fortuitous result of <HI>Epicurean</HI> Atoms,</L>
<L>(All <HI>Chance, Direction,</HI> which thou canst not see)</L></Q>
as those two species of atheism supposed it; but the wonderful Art and Direction, unknown indeed to Man, of an all-powerful, all-wise, all-good, and free Being. And therefore, we may be assured, that the arguments, brought above, to prove partial moral Evil productive of universal Good, are conclusive; from
<PB N="35" REF="76"/>
whence one certain truth results, in spite of all the pride and cavils of vain Reason, That WHATEVER IS, IS RIGHT.</P>
<P>That the reader may see in one view the Exactness of the Method, as well as Force of the Argument, I shall here draw up a short synopsis of this Epistle. The poet begins by telling us his subject is an Essay on Man: That his end of writing is <HI>to vindicate Providence:</HI> That he intends to derive his argu∣ments, <HI>from the visible things of God seen in this system:</HI> Lays down this Proposition, <HI>That of all possible systems infinite Wisdom has form'd the best:</HI> draws from thence two Consequences, 1. <HI>That there must needs be somewhere such a creature as Man;</HI> 2. <HI>That the moral Evil which he is author of, is productive of the Good of the Whole.</HI> This is his general Thesis; from whence he forms this Conclusion, <HI>That Man should rest submissive and content, and make the hopes of Futurity his comfort; but not suffer this to be the occasion of</HI> PRIDE, which is the cause of all his impious complaints.</P>
<P>He proceeds to confirm his Thesis.—Previously endeavours to abate our wonder at the phaenomenon of <HI>moral Evil;</HI> shews, first, <HI>its use to the Perfection of the Universe,</HI> by Analogy, from the use of <HI>physical Evil</HI> in this particular system.—Secondly, <HI>its use in this system,</HI> where it is turned, providentially, from its natural bias, to promote Virtue. Then goes on to vindicate Providence from the imputation of certain <HI>supposed natural Evils;</HI> as he had before justified it for the Permission of <HI>real moral Evil,</HI> in shewing that, though the atheist's complaint against Providence be on pretence of <HI>real moral Evil,</HI> yet the true cause is his impatience under <HI>imaginary natural Evil;</HI> the issue of a <HI>depraved appetite for fantastical advantages,</HI> which, if obtained, would be <HI>useless</HI> or <HI>hurtful</HI> to Man, and deforming
<PB N="36" REF="77"/>
and destructive to the Universe, as breaking into that Order by which it is supported.—He describes that <HI>Order, Harmony, and close Connection of the Parts;</HI> and, by shewing the intimate pre∣sence of God to his whole creation, gives a reason for an Uni∣verse so amazingly beautiful and perfect. From all this he de∣duces his general Conclusion, <HI>That Nature being neither a blind chain of Causes and Effects, nor yet the fortuitous result of wan∣dering atoms, but the wonderful Art and Direction of an all-wise, all-good, and free Being;</HI> WHATEVER IS, IS RIGHT, <HI>with re∣gard to the Disposition of God, and its Ultimate Tendency;</HI> which once granted, all complaints against Providence are at an end.</P>

VER. 30. <HI>The strong con∣nections, nice dependencies,]</HI> The thought is very noble, and ex∣pressed with great philosophic beauty and exactness.

VER. 93. <HI>What future bliss,</HI> &amp;c.] It hath been objected, that the <HI>System of the best</HI> weak∣ens the other natural arguments for a future state; because, if the evils which good Men suf∣fer promote the benefit of the whole, then every thing is here in order; and nothing amiss that wants to be set right: Nor has the good man any reason to expect amends, when the evils he suffered had such a tendency. To this it may be replied, 1. That the poet tells us (Ep. iv. ℣ 361) that <HI>God loves from whole to parts.</HI> 2. That the <HI>system of the best</HI> is so far from weakening those natural arguments, that it strength∣ens and supports them. For if those evils, to which good men are subject, be mere Disorders, without any tendency to the greater good of the whole; then, though we must indeed conclude that they will here∣after be set right, yet this view of things, representing God as suffering disorders for no other end than to set them right, gives us a very low idea of the divine wisdom. But if those evils (according to the <HI>system of the best)</HI> contribute to the greater perfection of the whole; such a reason may be then given for their permission, as supports
<PB N="14" REF="53" MS="y"/>
our idea of divine wisdom to the highest religious purposes. Then, as to the good man's <HI>hopes</HI> of a retribution, those still remain in their original force: For our idea of God's justice, and how far that justice is en∣gaged to a retribution, is ex∣actly and invariably the same on either hypothesis. For though the <HI>system of the best</HI> supposes that the <HI>evils themselves</HI> will be fully compensated by the good they produce to the <HI>whole,</HI> yet this is so far from supposing that <HI>particulars</HI> shall suffer for a <HI>general good,</HI> that it is es∣sential to <HI>this system</HI> to con∣clude, that, at the completion of things when the whole is arrived to the state of utmost perfection, <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>uni∣versal</HI> good shall coincide.</P>

<P>VER. 268. <HI>Whose body Na∣ture is,</HI> &amp;c.] A certain exa∣miner remarks, on this line, that <Q>“A Spinozist would ex∣press himself in this Man∣ner.”</Q> I believe he would, and so, we know, would St. Paul too, when writing on the same subject, namely the om∣nipresence of God in his Provi∣dence, and in his Substance. <HI>In him we live and move and have our being; i. e.</HI> we are parts of him, <HI>his offspring,</HI> as the Greek poet, a pantheist quoted by the Apostle, ob∣serves: And the reason is, be∣cause a religious theist and an impious pantheist both profess to believe the omnipresence of God. But would Spinoza, as Mr. Pope does, call God <HI>the great directing Mind of all,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="73"/>
who hath intentionally created a persect Universe? Or would a Spinozist have told us,
<Q><L>The workman from the work distinct was known,</L></Q>
a line that overturns all Spino∣zism from its very foundations.</P>
<P>But this sublime description of the Godhead contains not only the <HI>divinity</HI> of St. Paul; but, if that will not satisfy the men he writes against, the <HI>phi∣losophy</HI> likewise of Sir Isaac Newton.</P>

<P>Mr. Pope:</P>

<L>As full, as perfect, in a hair, as heart;</L>
<L>As full, as perfect, in vile Man that mourns,</L>

<P>But now admitting, for ar∣gument's sake, there was an ambiguity in these expressions, so great, as that a Spinozist might employ them to express his own particular principles; and such a thing might well be, because the Spinozists, in order to hide the impiety of their principle, are used to ex∣press the Omnipresence of God in terms that any religi∣ous Theist might employ. In this case, I say, how are we to judge of the poet's mean∣ing? Surely by the whole tenor of his argument. Now take the words in the sense of the Spinozists, and he is made, in the conclusion of his epistle, to overthrow all he has been advancing throughout the body of it: For Spinozism is the de∣struction of an Universe, where every thing tends, by a fore∣seen contrivance in all its parts, to the perfection of the whole. But allow him to employ the passage in the sense of St. Paul, <HI>That we and all creatures live and move and have our being in God;</HI> and then it will be seen to be the most logical support of all that had preceded. For the poet having, as we say, laboured through his epistle to prove, that every thing in the Universe tends, by a foreseen contrivance, and a present di∣rection of all its parts, to the perfection of the whole; it might be objected, that such a disposition of things implying in God a painful, operose, and inconceivable extent of Pro∣vidence, it could not be sup∣posed that such care extended to <HI>all,</HI> but was confined to the more noble parts of the crea∣tion. This gross conception of the First Cause the poet ex∣poses, by shewing that God is equally and intimately present to every particle of Matter, to every sort of Substance, and in every instant of Being.</P>

<L>Respecting Man, whatever wrong we call,</L>

<L>Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal:</L>

</LG>
<P>But without any regard to the evidence of this illustration, there is one who exclaims: <Q>“See the general conclusion, <HI>All that is, is right.</HI> So that at the sight of Charles the first losing his head on the scaffold, we must have said <HI>this is right;</HI> at the sight too of his judges condemn∣ing him, we must have said <HI>this is right;</HI> at the sight of
<PB N="37" REF="78"/>
some of these judges, taken and condemned for the action which he had own∣ed to be right, he must have cried out <HI>this is doubly right.”</HI></Q> Never was any thing more a∣mazing than that the absurdi∣ties arising from the sense in which this critic takes the grand principle, of <HI>whatever is, is right,</HI> did not shew him his mistake: For could any one in his senses employ a proposition in a meaning from whence such evident absur∣dities <HI>immediately</HI> arise? I have observed, that this conclusion, <HI>whatever is, is right,</HI> is a con∣sequence of these premisses, that <HI>partial Evil tends to uni∣versal Good;</HI> which the au∣thor employs as a principle to humble the pride of Man, who would impiously make God accountable for his creation. What then does common sense teach us to understand by <HI>what∣ever is, is right?</HI> Did the poet mean right with regard to Man, or right with regard to God; right with regard to it∣self, or right with regard to its ultimate tendency? Surely WITH REGARD TO GOD; for he tells us his design is to <HI>vindicate the ways of God to Man.</HI> Surely, with regard to its ULTIMATE TENDENCY; for he tells us again, <HI>all par∣tial ill is universal good,</HI> ℣ 291. Now is this any encouragement to Vice? Or does it take off from the crime of him who commits it, that God provi∣dentially produces Good out of Evil? Had Mr. Pope ab∣ruptly said in his conclusion, <HI>the result of all is, that what∣ever is, is right,</HI> the objector had even then been inexcusa∣ble for putting so absurd a sense upon the words, when he might have seen that it was a conclusion from the general principle abovementioned; and therefore must necessarily have another meaning. But what must we think of him, when the poet, to prevent mistakes, had delivered, in this very place, the principle itself, to∣gether with this conclusion as the consequence of it?</P>
<LG>
<L>All Discord, Harmony not understood;</L>
<L>All partial Evil, universal Good:</L>
<L>And, spite of Pride, in erring Reason's spite,</L>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>VER. 2. <HI>The proper study</HI> &amp;c.] The poet having shewn, in the <HI>first</HI> epistle, that the <HI>Ways of God</HI> are too high for our com∣prehension, rightly draws this conclusion: and methodically makes it the subject of his Introduction to the <HI>second,</HI> which treats of the <HI>Nature of Man.</HI></P>
<P>But here immediately the accusers of Providence would be apt to object, and say, Admit that we had run into an excess, while we pretended to censure or penetrate the designs of Pro∣vidence, a matter indeed too high for us; yet have you gone as far into the opposite extreme, while you only send us to the
<PB N="40" REF="82"/>
knowledge of our own Nature: You must mock us when you talk of this as a study; for sure we are intimately acquainted with OURSELVES. The proper conclusion therefore from your demonstration of our inability to comprehend the ways of God, is, that we should turn ourselves to the study of the frame of NATURE. Thus, I say, would they be apt to object; for, of all Men, those who call themselves <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> are most given up to <HI>Pride;</HI> especially that kind of it, which consists in a boasted knowledge of their own nature, the effects of which are so well
<PB N="41" REF="83"/>
exposed in the <HI>first</HI> Epistle. The poet, therefore, to convince them that this study is less easy than they imagine, replies (from ℣ 2 to 19) to the <HI>first</HI> part of the objection, by describing the dark and feeble state of the human Understanding, with regard to the knowledge of ourselves. And farther, to strengthen this ar∣gument, he shews, in answer to the <HI>second</HI> part of the objection (from ℣ 18 to 31) that the highest advances in <HI>natural know∣ledge</HI> may be easily acquired, and yet we, all the while, con∣tinue very ignorant of <HI>ourselves.</HI> For that neither the clearest science, which results from the Newtonian philosophy, nor the most sublime, which is taught by the Platonic, will at all assist us in this self-study; nay, what is more, that Religion itself, when grown fanatical and enthusiastic, will be equally useless: Though pure and sober Religion will best instruct us in Man's Nature, that knowledge being essential to Religion, whose sub∣ject is Man considered in all his relations; and, consequently, whose object is God.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="87" MS="y"/>
VER. 31. <HI>Superior beings,</HI> &amp;c.] To give this second argu∣ment its full force, he illustrates it (from ℣ 30 to 43) by the noblest example that ever was in science, the incomparable NEWTON; who, although he penetrated so far beyond others into the works of GOD, yet could go no farther in the know∣ledge of his own nature than the generality of his fellows. Of which the poet assigns this very just and adequate reason: In all <HI>other sciences</HI> the Understanding is unchecked and uncon∣trouled by any opposite principle; but in the science of <HI>Man,</HI> the Passions overturn as fast as Reason can build up.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="89"/>
VER. 43. <HI>Trace Science then,</HI> &amp;c.] The conclusion, there∣fore, from the whole is (from ℣ 42 to 53) that, as on the one
<PB N="48" REF="90"/>
hand, we should persist in the study of Nature; so, on the other, in order to arrive at Science, we should proceed in the simpli∣city of Truth; and the product, tho' small, will yet be real.</P>
<P>VER. 53. <HI>Two Principles,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet having thus shewn the difficulty attending the study of Man, proceeds to remove it, by laying before us the elements or true principles of this science, in an account of the <HI>Origin, Use,</HI> and <HI>End</HI> of the PAS∣SIONS; which, in my opinion, contains the truest, clearest, shortest, and consequently the best system of Ethics that is any
<PB N="49" REF="91"/>
where to be met with. He begins (from ℣ 52 to 59) with point∣ing out the two grand principles in human nature, SELF-LOVE and REASON. Describes their general nature: The first sets Man upon acting, the other regulates his action. However, these principles are <HI>natural,</HI> not <HI>moral;</HI> and, therefore, in them∣selves, neither good nor bad, but so only as they are directed. This observation is made with great judgment, in opposition to the desperate solly of those fanatics, who, as the Ascetic, pre∣tend to eradicate Self-love; as the Mystic, would stifle Rea∣son; and both, on the absurd fancy of their being moral, not natural principles.</P>
<P>VER. 59. <HI>Self-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul;]</HI> The poet proceeds (from ℣ 58 to 67) more minutely to mark out the distinct offices of these two principles, which he had before assigned only in general; and here he shews their necessity; for without Self-love, as the <HI>spring,</HI> Man would be unactive; and without Reason, as the <HI>balance,</HI> active no purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="92"/>
VER. 67. <HI>Most strength the moving principle requires;]</HI> Having thus explained the ends and offices of each principle, he goes on (from ℣ 66 to 79) to speak of their qualities; and shews how they are fitted to discharge those functions, and answer their respective intentions. The business of Self-love being to excite to action, it is quick and impetuous; and moving instinctively, has, like attraction, its force prodigiously increased as the object approaches, and proportionably lessened as that recedes. On the contrary, Reason, like the Author of attraction, is always calm and sedate, and equally preserves itself, whether the object be near, or far off. Hence the moving principle is made more strong, though the restraining be more quick-sighted. The consequence he draws from this is, that if we would not be carried away to our destruction, we must always keep Reason upon guard.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="93"/>
VER. 79. <HI>Attention,</HI> &amp;c.] But it would be objected, that, if this account were true, human life would be most miserable; and, even in the wisest, a perpetual conflict between Reason and the Passions. To this, therefore, the poet replies (from ℣ 78 to 81) first, that Providence has so graciously contrived, that even in the voluntary exercise of Reason, as in the mere mechanic motion of a limb, Habit makes what was at first done with pain, easy and natural. And, secondly, that the experience gained by the long exercise of Reason, goes a great way towards eluding the force of Self-love. Now the attending to Reason, as here recommended, will gain us this habit and experience. Hence it appears, that this station, in which Reason is to be kept constantly upon guard, is not so uneasy a one as may be at first imagined.</P>
<P>VER. 81. <HI>Let subtle schoolmen</HI> &amp;c.] From this description of Self-love and Reason it follows, as the poet observes (from ℣ 80 to 93) that both conspire to one end, namely, human hap∣piness, though they be not equally expert in the choice of the means; the difference being this, that the first hastily seizes
<PB N="52" REF="94"/>
every thing which hath the appearance of good; the other weighs and examines whether it <HI>be indeed</HI> what it appears.</P>
<P>This shews, as he next observes, the folly of the schoolmen, who consider them as two opposite principles, the one good and the other evil. The observation is seasonable and judicious; for this dangerous school-opinion gives great support to the Mani∣chean or Zoroastran error, the confutation of which was one of the author's chief ends in writing. For if there be <HI>two prin∣ciples</HI> in Man, a <HI>good</HI> and <HI>bad,</HI> it is natural to think him the joint product of the two Manichean deities (the first of which contributed to his <HI>Reason,</HI> the other to his <HI>Passions)</HI> rather than the creature of one Individual Cause. This was Plutarch's notion, and, as we may see in him, of the more ancient Mani∣cheans. It was of importance, therefore, to reprobrate and subvert a notion that served to the support of so dangerous an error: And this the poet has done with more force and clear∣ness than is often to be found in whole volumes written against that heretical opinion.</P>
<P>VER. 93. <HI>Modes of Self-love</HI> &amp;c.] Having given this ac∣count of the nature of Self-love in general, he comes now to anatomize it, in a discourse on the PASSIONS, which he aptly names the <HI>modes</HI> of Self-love. The object of all these, he shews (from ℣ 92 to 101) is good; and, when under the guidance of Reason, real good, either of ourselves or of another; for some goods not being capable of division or communication, and Reason at the same time directing us to provide for ourselves,
<PB N="53" REF="95"/>
we therefore, in pursuit of these objects, sometimes aim at our own good, sometimes at the good of others: when fairly aim∣ing at our own, the quality is called <HI>Prudence,</HI> when at an∣other's, <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>Hence (as he shews from ℣ 100 to 105) appears the folly of the Stoics, who would eradicate the Passions, things so necessary both to the good of the Individual and of the Kind. Which preposterous method of promoting Virtue he therefore very rea∣sonably reproves.</P>
<P>VER. 105. <HI>The rising tempest puts in act the soul,]</HI> But as it was from observation of the evils occasioned by the Passions, that the Stoics thus extravagantly projected their extirpation, the poet recurs (from ℣ 104 to 111) to his grand principle, so often before, and to so good purpose, insisted on, that <HI>partial Ill is uni∣versal Good;</HI> and shews, that though the tempest of the Pas∣sions, like that of the air, may tear and ravage some few parts of nature in its passage, yet the salutary agitation produced by it preserves the whole in life and vigour. This is his <HI>first</HI> argument against the Stoics, which he illustrates by
<PB N="54" REF="96"/>
a very beautiful similitude, on a hint taken from Scripture:</P>
<Q><L>Nor God alone in the still calm we find,</L>
<L>He mounts the storm, and walks upon the wind.</L></Q>
<P>VER. 111. <HI>Passions, like Elements,</HI> &amp;c.] His <HI>second</HI> argument against the Stoics (from ℣ 110 to 133) is, that Passions go to the composition of a moral character, just as elementary parti∣cles go to the composition of an organized body: Therefore, for Man to project the destruction of what composes his very Being, is the height of extravagance. 'Tis true, he tells us,
<PB N="55" REF="97"/>
that these Passions, which, in their natural state, like elements, are in perpetual jar, must be tempered, softened, and united, in order to perfect the work of the great plastic Artist; who, in this office, employs human Reason; whose business it is to fol∣low the road of Nature, and to observe the dictates of the Deity; <HI>Follow her and God.</HI> The use and importance of this precept is evident: For in doing the first, she will discover the absurdity of attempting to eradicate the Passions; in doing the second, she will learn how to make them subservient to the in∣terest of Virtue.</P>
<P>VER. 123. <HI>Pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes;]</HI> His <HI>third</HI> argument against the Stoics (from ℣ 122 to 127) is, that the Passions are a continual spur to the pursuit of Happiness; which, without these powerful inciters, we should neglect, and sink into a senseless indolence. Now Happiness is the end of our
<PB N="56" REF="98"/>
creation; and this excitement the means of Happiness; there∣fore, these movers, the Passions, are the instruments of God, which he hath put into the hands of Reason to work withal.</P>
<P>VER. 127. <HI>All spread their charms,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet now pro∣ceeds in his subject; and this last observation leads him natu∣rally to the discussion of his next principle. He shews then, that though all the Passions have their turn in swaying the deter∣minations of the mind, yet every Man hath one MASTER PASSION that at length stifles or absorbs all the rest. The fact he illustrates at large in his epistle to Lord Cobham. Here (from ℣ 126 to 149) he giveth us the cause of it. Those Pleasures or Goods, which are the objects of the Passions, affect the mind by striking on the senses; but, as through the formation of the organs of our frame, every man hath some one sense stronger and more acute than others, the object which strikes that stronger or acuter sense, whatever it be, will be the object most desired; and consequently, the pursuit of that will be the <HI>ruling Passion.</HI> That the difference of force in this ruling Passion shall, at first, perhaps, be very small or even imperceptible; but Nature, Ha∣bit, Imagination, Wit, nay even Reason itself shall assist its growth, 'till it hath at length drawn and converted every other into itself. All which is delivered in a strain of Poetry so won∣derfully
<PB N="57" REF="99"/>
sublime, as suspends, for a while, the <HI>ruling passion,</HI> in every Reader, and engrosses his whole Admiration.</P>
<P>This naturally leads the poet to lament the weakness and in∣sufficiency of human Reason (from ℣ 148 to 161) and the pur∣pose he had in so doing, was plainly to intimate the necessity of a more perfect dispensation to Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="101"/>
VER. 161. <HI>Yes, Nature's road</HI> &amp;c.] Now as it appears, from the account here given of the <HI>ruling Passion</HI> and its cause which results from the structure of the organs, that it is the road of Na∣ture, the poet shews (from ℣ 160 to 167) that this road is to be followed. So that the office of Reason is not to direct us what Passion to exercise, but to assist us in RECTIFYING, and keeping within due bounds, that which Nature hath so strongly impressed; because</P>
<Q><L>A mightier Pow'r the strong direction sends,</L>
<L>And sev'ral Men impels to sev'ral ends.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="60" REF="104"/>
VER. 167. <HI>Like warying winds,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet having proved that the <HI>ruling passion</HI> (since Nature hath given it us) is not to be overthrown, but <HI>rectified,</HI> the next inquiry will be of what <HI>use</HI> the ruling Passion is; for an use it must have, if reason be to treat it thus mildly. This use he shews us (from ℣ 166 to 197) is twofold, Natural and Moral.</P>
<P N="1">1. Its <HI>Natural</HI> use is to conduct Men steddily to one certain end; who would otherwise be eternally fluctuating between the equal violence of various and discordant passions, driving them up and down at random; and, by that means, to enable them to promote the good of Society, by making each a contributor to the common stock:</P>
<Q><L>Let pow'r or knowledge, gold or glory, please, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P N="2">2. Its <HI>Moral</HI> use is to ingraft our ruling Virtue upon it; and by that means to enable us to promote our own good, by turn∣ing
<PB N="61" REF="105"/>
the exorbitancy of the <HI>ruling passion</HI> into its neighbouring Virtue:</P>
<Q><L>See anger, zeal and fortitude supply; &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>The wisdom of the divine Artist is, as the poet finely ob∣serves, very illustrious in this contrivance; for the mind and body having now one common interest, the efforts of Virtue will have their force infinitely augmented:</P>
<Q><L>'Tis thus the Mercury, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="62" REF="106"/>
VER. 197. <HI>Reason the byass</HI> &amp;c.] But lest it should be objected that this account favours the doctrine of Necessity, and would insinuate that Men are only acted upon, in the production of Good out of Evil, the poet teacheth (from ℣ 196 to 203) that Man is a free agent, and hath it in his own power to turn the natural passions into Virtues or into Vices, properly so called:
<Q><PB N="63" REF="107"/>
<L>Reason the byass turns to good from ill,</L>
<L>And Nero reigns a Titus, if he will.</L></Q></P>
<P>Secondly, If it should be objected, that though he doth in∣deed tell us some actions are beneficial and some hurtful, yet he could not call those <HI>virtuous</HI> nor these <HI>vicious,</HI> because, as he hath described things, the motive appears to be only the gratifi∣cation of some passion; give me leave to answer for him, that this would be mistaking the argument, which (to ℣ 249 of this epistle) considers the passions only with regard to <HI>Society,</HI> that is, with regard to their <HI>effects</HI> rather than their <HI>motives.</HI> That how∣ever, 'tis his design to teach that actions are <HI>properly virtuous and vicious;</HI> and though it be difficult to distinguish genuine Virtue from spurious, they having both the same appearance, and both the same public effects, yet they may be disembarrassed. If it be asked, by what means? He replies (from ℣ 202 to 205) By Conscience; which is to the purpose; for it is solely a Man's own concern to know whether his Virtue be pure and solid; for
<PB N="64" REF="108"/>
what is it to <HI>others,</HI> whether this Virtue, while, as to them, the effects of it is the same, be real or unsubstantial?</P>
<P>VER. 205. <HI>Extremes in Nature equal ends produce,]</HI> But still it will be said, why all this difficulty to distinguish true Virtue from false? The poet shews why (from ℣ 204 to 211) That though indeed Vice and Virtue so invade each other's bounds, that some∣times we can scarce tell where one ends and the other begins, yet great purposes are served thereby, no less than the perfect∣ing the constitution of the whole, as lights and shades, which run into one another in a well-wrought picture, make the har∣mony and spirit of the composition. But on this account to say there is neither Vice or Virtue, the poet shews (from ℣ 210 to 217) would be just as wise as to say there is neither black nor white; because the shade of that and the light of this often run into one another:
<Q><L>Ask your own heart, and nothing is so plain;</L>
<L>'Tis to mistake them, costs the time and pain.</L></Q>
This is an error of <HI>speculation,</HI> which leads Men so foolishly to conclude, that there is neither Vice nor Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="109" MS="y"/>
VER. 217. <HI>Vice is a monster</HI> &amp;c.] There is another Error of <HI>practice,</HI> which hath more common and fatal effects; and is next considered (from ℣ 216 to 221.) It is this, that though, at the first aspect, Vice be so horrible as to affright all behold∣ers, yet, when by habit we are once grown familiar with her, we first suffer, and in time begin to lose the memory of her na∣ture; which necessarily implies an equal ignorance in the na∣ture of Virtue. Hence Men conclude, that there is neither one nor the other.</P>
<P>VER. 221. <HI>But where th' Extreme of Vice,</HI> &amp;c.] But it is not
<PB N="66" REF="110"/>
only that extreme of Vice next to Virtue, which betrays us into these mistakes. We are deceived too, as he shews us (from ℣ 220 to 231) by our observations about the other extreme: For from the extreme of Vice being unsettled, Men conclude that Vice itself is only nominal.</P>
<P>VER. 231. <HI>Virtuous and vicious ev'ry Man must be,]</HI> There is yet a third cause of this error, of <HI>no Vice no Virtue,</HI> composed of the other two, <HI>i. e.</HI> partly <HI>speculative,</HI> and partly <HI>practical.</HI> And this also the poet here considers (from ℣ 230 to 239) shew∣ing it ariseth from the imperfection of the best characters, and the inequality of all; whence it happens that no Man is ex∣tremely virtuous or vicious, nor extremely constant in the pur∣suit of either. Why it so happens, the poet assigns an admira∣ble reason in this line:
<Q><L>For, Vice or Virtue, <HI>SELF</HI> directs it still.</L></Q>
An adherence or regard to what is, in the sense of the world, a Man's own Interest, making an extreme in either impossible. Its effect in keeping a good Man from the extreme of Virtue, needs no explanation; and in an ill Man, Self-interest shewing him the necessity of some kind of reputation, the procuring, and preserving that, will necessarily keep him from the extreme of Vice.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="111"/>
VER. 239. <HI>That counterworks each folly and caprice;]</HI> The mention of this principle, that <HI>Self</HI> directs Vice and Virtue, and its consequence, which is, that
<Q><L>Each individual seeks a sev'ral goal,</L></Q>
leads the author to observe
<Q><L>That <HI>HEAV'N</HI>'s great view is One, and that the Whole.</L></Q>
And this brings him naturally round again to his main subject, namely, <HI>God's producing good out of ill,</HI> which he prosecutes from ℣ 238 to 249.</P>
<P>VER. 249. <HI>Heav'n forming each on other to depend,]</HI> I. Hither∣to the poet hath been employed in discoursing of the use of the Passions, with regard to Society at large; and in freeing his
<PB N="68" REF="112"/>
doctrine from objections: This is the <HI>first</HI> general division of the subject of this epistle.</P>
<P N="2">II. He comes to shew (from 248 to 261) the use of these Passions, with regard to the more confined circle of our Friends, Relations, and Acquaintance: And this is the <HI>second</HI> general division.</P>
<P>VER. 261. <HI>Whate'er the Passion,</HI> &amp;c.] III. The poet having thus shewn the use of the Passions in <HI>Society,</HI> and in <HI>Domestic</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="113"/>
life; he comes, in the last place (from 260 to the end) to shew their use to the <HI>Individual,</HI> even in their illusions; the imaginary happiness they present, helping to make the real miseries of life less insupportable: And this is his <HI>third</HI> general division:</P>
<LG>
<L>—Opinion gilds with varying rays</L>
<L>Those painted clouds that beautify our days, &amp;c.</L>
<L>One prospect lost, another still we gain;</L>
<L>And not a vanity is giv'n in vain.</L>
</LG>
<P>Which must needs vastly raise our idea of God's goodness, who hath not only provided more than a counter-balance of real hap∣piness to human miseries, but hath even, in his infinite compas∣sion, bestowed on those, who were so foolish as not to have made this provision, an imaginary happiness; that they may not be quite over-borne with the load of human miseries. This is the poet's great and noble thought; as strong and solid as it is new
<PB N="70" REF="114"/>
and ingenious; which teaches. That these illusions are the fol∣lies of Men, which they willfully fall into, and through their own fault; thereby depriving themselves of much happiness, and exposing themselves to equal misery: But that still God (according to his universal way of working) graciously turns these follies so far to the advantage of his miserable creatures, as to be the present solace and support of their distresses:

<PB N="39" REF="81"/>
<P>VER. 3. <HI>Plac'd on this isth∣mus</HI> &amp;c.] As the Poet hath given us this description of man for the very contrary pur∣pose to which <HI>Sceptics</HI> are wont to employ such kind of paint∣ings, namely not to deter men from the <HI>search,</HI> but to excite them to the <HI>discovery</HI> of truth; he hath, with great judgment, represented Man as doubting and wavering between the <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> object; from which state there are great hopes he may be relieved by a careful and circumspect use of Reason. On the contrary, had he supposed Man so blind as to be busied in chusing, or doubtful in his choice, between
<PB N="40" REF="82"/>
two objects <HI>equally wrong,</HI> the case had appeared desperate, and all <HI>study of Man</HI> had been effectually discouraged. But his Translator, M. <HI>De Resnel,</HI> not seeing the reason and beauty of this conduct, hath run into the very absurdity which, I have here shewn, Mr. Pope so artfully avoided. Of which, the learned Reader may take the following exam∣ples. The Poet says,
<Q><L>Man acts between; in doubt to <HI>act,</HI> or <HI>rest.</HI></L></Q>
Now he tells us 'tis Man's duty to <HI>act,</HI> not <HI>rest,</HI> as the Stoics thought; and, to this their principle the latter word alludes, whose Virtue, as he says afterwards, is
<Q><L>—fix'd as in a Frost,</L>
<L>Contracted all, retiring to the breast:</L>
<L>But strength of mind is <HI>EXERCISE</HI> not <HI>REST.</HI></L></Q>
Now hear the Translator, who is not for mincing matters,
<Q><L><HI>Seroit-il en naissant</HI> au travail condamné?</L>
<L><HI>Aux</HI> douceurs du répos <HI>seroit-il destiné?</HI></L></Q>
and these are both wrong, for Man is neither condemned to <HI>slavish Toil and Labour,</HI> nor yet indulged in the <HI>Luxury of repose.</HI> Again, the Poet, in a beautiful allusion to Scripture
<PB N="41" REF="83"/>
sentiments, breaks out into this just and moral reflection on man's condition here,
<Q><L>Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err.</L></Q>
The Translator turns this fine and sober thought into the most outragious Scepticism;
<Q><L>Ce n'est que pour mourir, qu'il est né, qu'il respire,</L>
<L><HI>Et</HI> toute sa raison n'est presque qu'un delire.</L></Q>
and so makes his Author di∣rectly contradict himself, where he says of Man, that he hath
<Q><L>—too much knowledge for the Sceptic side.</L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 10. <HI>Born but to die,</HI> &amp;c.] The author's meaning is, that, as we are <HI>born to die,</HI> and yet enjoy some small por∣tion of life; so, though we <HI>reason to err,</HI> yet we compre∣hend some few truths. This is the weak state of Reason, in which Error mixes itself with all its true conclusions concerning Man's Nature.</P>

VER. 11. <HI>Alike in igno∣rance,</HI> &amp;c.] <HI>i. e.</HI> The proper sphere of his Reason is so nar∣row, and the exercise of it so nice, that the too immoderate use of it is attended with the same ignorance that proceeds from the not using it at all. Yet, tho' in both these cases, he is <HI>abused by himself,</HI> he has it still in his own power to <HI>disabuse himself,</HI> in making his Passions subservient to the <HI>means,</HI> and regulating his Rea∣son by the <HI>end</HI> of Life.</P>
<P>VER. 12. <HI>Whether he thinks too little, or too much:]</HI> This is so true, that ignorance arises as well from pushing our enquiries too far, as from not carrying them far enough, that we may observe, when Speculations, even in Science, are carried beyond a certain point; that point where use is reasonably supposed to end, and mere curiosity to begin; they con∣clude in the most extravagant and senseless inferences; such as the unreality of matter; the reality of space; the ser∣vility of the Will, &amp;c. The reason of this sudden fall out of full light into utter darkness appears not to result from the natural condition of things, but to be the arbitrary decree of infinite wisdom and good∣ness, which imposed a barrier to the extravagances of its giddy lawless creature, al∣ways inclined to pursue truths of less importance too far, to the neglect of those more ne∣cessary for his improvement in his station here.</P>

have imagined that the author, by, <HI>in endless error hurl'd,</HI> meant, <HI>cast into endless error,</HI> or <HI>into the regions of endless error,</HI> and therefore have taken notice of it as an incongruity of speech. But they neither understood the poet's language, nor his sense, to <HI>hurl</HI> and <HI>cast</HI> are not synonymous; but are related only as the genus and species; for to <HI>hurl</HI> signifies, not simply to <HI>cast,</HI> but to <HI>cast backward and forward,</HI> and is taken from the rural game called <HI>hurling.</HI> So that, <HI>into endless error hurl'd,</HI> as these critics would have it, would have been a barbarism.

<P>VER. 31. <HI>Superior beings,</HI> &amp;c.] In these lines he speaks to this effect: But to make you fully sensible of the dif∣ficulty of this study, I shall instance in the great Newton himself; whom, when superior beings, not long since, saw capable of unfolding the whole law of Nature, they were in doubt whether the owner of such prodigious science should not be reckoned of their own order; just as men, when they see the surprising marks of Reason in an Ape, are almost tempted to rank him with their own kind. And yet this wondrous Man could go no farther in the knowledge of himself than the generality of his species. In which we see it was not Mr. Pope's inten∣tion to bring any of the Ape's <HI>qualities,</HI> but its <HI>sagacity,</HI> into the comparison. But why the <HI>Ape's,</HI> it may be said, rather than the sagacity of some more decent animal, particularly the <HI>half-reasoning elephant,</HI> as the poet calls it; which, as
<PB N="46" REF="88"/>
well on account of this its superiority, as for its having no ridiculous side, like the Ape, on which it could be viewed, seems better to have deserved this honour? I reply, Because, as none but a shape <HI>resembling human,</HI> accompa∣nied with great sagacity, could occasion the <HI>doubt</HI> of that ani∣mal's relation to Man, the Ape only having that resemblance, no other animal was fitted for the comparison. And on this ground of relation the whole beauty of the thought depends; Newton and those superior spirits being equally immortal, though of different orders. And here let me take notice of a new species of the Sublime, of which our poet may be justly said to be the maker; so new, that we have yet no name for it, though of a nature distinct from every other poetical excellence. The two great perfections of works of genius are Wit and Subli∣mity. Many writers have been witty, several have been sublime, and some few have even possessed both these qua∣lities separately; but none that I know of, besides our Poet, hath had the art to incorporate them; of which he hath given many examples, both in this Essay and his other poems, one of the noblest being the pas∣sage in question. This seems to be the last effort of the imagination, to poetical per∣fection: and in this com∣pounded excellence the Wit receives a dignity from the Sublime, and the Sublime a splendor from the Wit; which, in their state of separate ex∣istence, they both wanted.</P>

VER. 109. <HI>Nor God alone,</HI> &amp;c.] These words are only a simple affirmation in the poetic dress of a similitude, to this purpose: Good is not only pro∣duced by the subdual of the Passions, but by the turbulent exercise of them. A truth con∣veyed under the most sublime imagery that poetry could con∣ceive or paint. For the au∣thor is here only shewing the providential issue of the Pas∣sions, and how, by God's gra∣cious disposition, they are turned away from their natu∣ral byas, to promote the hap∣piness of Mankind. As to the method in which they are to be treated by Man, in whom
<PB N="55" REF="97"/>
they are found, all that he con∣tends for, in favour of them, is only this, that they should not be quite rooted up and
<PB N="56" REF="98"/>
destroyed, as the Stoics, and their followers in all religions, foolishly attempted. For the rest, he constantly repeats this advice,</P>
<Q><L>The action of the stronger to suspend,</L>

This <HI>An∣tipater</HI> was in the times of Crassus, and is celebrated for the quickness of his parts by Cicero.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="102"/>
VER. 147. <HI>Reason itself,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet, in some other of his epistles, gives examples of the doctrine and precepts here delivered. Thus, in that <HI>Of the use of Riches,</HI> he has illustrated this truth in the cha∣racter of Cotta:</P>
<LG>
<L>Old Cotta sham'd his fortune and his birth,</L>
<L>Yet was not Cotta void of wit or worth.</L>
<L>What tho' (the use of barb'rous spits forgot)</L>
<L>His kitchen vy'd in coolness with his grot?</L>
<L>If Cotta liv'd on pulse, it was no more</L>
<L>Than bramins, saints, and sages did before.</L>
</LG>
<P>Ver. 149. <HI>We, wretched sub∣jects</HI> &amp;c.] St. Paul himself did not chuse to employ other ar∣guments, when disposed to give us the highest idea of the use∣fulness of Christianity <HI>(Rom.</HI> vii.) But, it may be, the poet finds a remedy in Natural Re∣ligion. Far from it. He here leaves reason unrelieved. What is this then, but an intimation that we ought to seek for a cure in that religion, which only dares profess to give it?</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="103"/>
VER. 163. <HI>'Tis hers to rec∣tify,</HI> &amp;c.] The meaning of this precept is, That as the ruling Passion is implanted by Nature, it is Reason's office to regulate, direct, and restrain, but not to overthrow it. To regulate the passion of Avarice, for instance, into a parsimoni∣ous dispensation of the public revenues; to direct the pas∣sion of Love, whose object is worth and beauty,
<Q><L>To the first good, first perfect, and first fair,</L></Q>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as his master Plato advises; and to restrain Spleen to a contempt and ha∣tred of Vice. This is what
<PB N="60" REF="104"/>
the poet meant, and what every unprejudiced man could not but see he must needs mean, by RECTIFYING THE MASTER PASSION, though he had not confined us to this sense, in the reason he gives of his pre∣cept, in these words:
<Q><L>A mightier Pow'r the strong direction sends,</L>
<L>And sev'ral Men impels to sev'ral ends.</L></Q>
For what ends are they which God impels to, but the ends of Virtue?</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="107"/>
VER. 203. <HI>This light</HI> &amp;c.] A Platonic phrase for Consci∣ence; and here employed with great judgment and propriety. For Conscience either signifies, speculatively, the judgment we pass of things upon whatever principles we chance to have; and then it is only Opinion, a very unable judge and divider. Or else it signifies, practically, the application of the eternal rule of right (received by us as the law of God) to the regula∣tion of our actions; and then it is properly Conscience, <HI>the God</HI> (or the law of God) <HI>within the mind,</HI> of power to divide the light from the darkness in this chaos of the passions.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="112"/>
VER. 253. <HI>Wants, frail∣ties, passions, closer still ally The common int'rest,</HI> &amp;c.] As these lines have been misun∣derstood, I shall give the rea∣der their plain and obvious meaning. To these frailties (says he) we owe all the en∣dearments of private life; yet, when we come to that age, which generally disposes Men to think more seriously of the true value of things, and con∣sequently of their provision for a future state, the considera∣tion, that the grounds of those joys, loves, and friendships, are wants, frailties, and pas∣sions,
<PB N="69" REF="113"/>
proves the best expedient to wean us from the world; a disengagement so friendly to that provision we are now making for another. The ob∣servation is new, and would in any place be extremely beau∣tiful, but has here an infinite grace and propriety, as it so well confirms, by an instance of great moment, the general thesis, <HI>That God makes Ill, at every step, productive of Good.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 270.—<HI>the poet in his Muse.]</HI> The author having said, that no one would change his profession or views for those of another, intended to carry his observation still fur∣ther, and shew that Men were
<PB N="70" REF="114"/>
unwilling to exchange their own acquirements even for those of the same kind, con∣fessedly larger, and infinitely more eminent, in another. To this end he wrote,
<Q><L>What partly pleases, totally will shock:</L>
<L>I question much, if <HI>Toland</HI> would be <HI>Locke.</HI></L></Q>
but wanting another proper instance of this truth when he published his last Edition of the Essay, he reserved the lines above for some following one.</P>
<P>VER. 280. <HI>And beads and pray'r-books are the toys of age:]</HI> A Satire on what is called in Popery the <HI>Opus operatum.</HI> As this is a description of the circle of human life returning into itself by a second child∣hood, the poet has with great elegance concluded his descrip∣tion with the same figure with which he set out.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="115"/>
<HI>VER. 286.</HI> And each vacuity of sense by Pride:] <HI>An eminent Casuist,</HI> Father Francis Garasse, <HI>in his</HI> Somme Theologique, <HI>has drawn a very charitable con∣clusion from this principle.</HI> So∣lon la Justice (dit cet equitable Théologien) tout travail honnête doit être recompensé de loüange ou de satisfaction. Quand les bons esprits font un ouvrage ex∣cellent, ils sont justement recom∣pensez par les suffrages du Pub∣lic. Quand un pauvre esprit travaille beaucoup, pour faire un mauvais ouvrage, il n'est pas juste ni raisonable, qu'il attende des loüanges publiques: car elles ne lui sont pas duës. Mais afin que ses travaux ne demeurent pas sans recompense, <HI>Dieu</HI> lui donne une satisfaction personnelle, que personne ne lui peut envier sans une injustice plus que barbare; tout ainsi que Dieu qui est juste donne de la satisfaction aux Grenoüilles de leur chant. Au∣trement le blâme public, joint à leur mécontentement, seroit suf∣fisant pour les réduire au des∣espoir.</P>

<L>That very life his learned hunger craves,</L>

<L>As, while he dreads it, makes him hope it too:</L>
<L N="75">The hour conceal'd, and so remote the fear,</L>
<L>Death still draws nearer, never seeming near.</L>
<L>Great standing miracle! that Heav'n assign'd</L>
<L>Its only thinking thing this turn of mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>II. Whether with Reason, or with Instinct blest,</L>
<L>Know, all enjoy that pow'r which suits them best;</L>
<L N="81"><PB N="81" REF="127"/>
To bliss alike by that direction tend,</L>
<L>And find the means proportion'd to their end.</L>
<L>Say, where full Instinct is th'unerring guide,</L>
<L>What Pope or Council can they need beside?</L>
<L N="85">Reason, however able, cool at best,</L>
<L>Cares not for service, or but serves when prest,</L>
<L>Stays 'till we call, and then not often near;</L>
<L>But honest Instinct comes a volunteer,</L>
<L>Sure never to o'er-shoot, but just to hit;</L>
<L N="90">While still too wide or short is human Wit;</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="128" MS="y"/>
Sure by quick Nature happiness to gain,</L>
<L>Which heavier Reason labours at vain.</L>
<L>This too serves always, Reason never long;</L>
<L>One must go right, the other may go wrong.</L>
<L N="95">See then the acting and comparing pow'rs</L>

<L>Who taught the nations of the field and wood</L>

<L N="105">Who bid the stork, Columbus-like, explore</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>III. God, in the nature of each being, founds</L>
<L N="110">Its proper bliss, and sets its proper bounds:</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="129"/>
But as he fram'd a Whole, the Whole to bless,</L>
<L>On mutual Wants built mutual Happiness:</L>
<L>So from the first, eternal ORDER ran,</L>
<L>And creature link'd to creature, man to man.</L>
<L N="115">Whate'er of life all-quick'ning aether keeps,</L>
<L>Or breathes thro' air, or shoots beneath the deeps,</L>
<L>Or pours profuse on earth, one nature feeds</L>
<L>The vital flame, and swells the genial seeds.</L>
<L>Not Man alone, but all that roam the wood,</L>
<L N="120">Or wing the sky, or roll along the flood,</L>
<L>Each loves itself, but not itself alone,</L>
<L>Each sex desires alike, 'till two are one.</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="130" MS="y"/>
Nor ends the pleasure with the fierce embrace;</L>
<L>They love themselves, a third time, in their race.</L>
<L>Thus beast and bird their common charge attend,</L>
<L N="126">The mothers nurse it, and the sires defend;</L>
<L>The young dismiss'd to wander earth or air,</L>
<L>There stops the Instinct, and there ends the care;</L>
<L>The link dissolves, each seeks a fresh embrace,</L>
<L N="130">Another love succeeds, another race.</L>
<L>A longer care Man's helpless kind demands;</L>
<L>That longer care contracts more lasting bands:</L>
<L>Reflection, Reason, still the ties improve,</L>
<L>At once extend the int'rest, and the love;</L>
<L N="135">With choice we fix, with sympathy we burn;</L>
<L>Each Virtue in each Passion takes its turn;</L>
<L>And still new needs, new helps, new habits rise,</L>
<L>That graft benevolence on charities.</L>
<L>Still as one brood, and as another rose,</L>
<L N="140">These nat'ral love maintain'd, habitual those:</L>
<L>The last, scarce ripen'd into perfect Man,</L>
<L>Saw helpless him from whom their life began:</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="131"/>
Mem'ry and fore-cast just returns engage,</L>
<L>That pointed back to youth, this on to age;</L>
<L N="145">While pleasure, gratitude, and hope, combin'd,</L>
<L>Still spread the int'rest, and preserv'd the kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IV. Nor think, in NATURE'S STATE they blindly trod;</L>
<L>The state of Nature was the reign of God:</L>
<L>Self-love and Social at her birth began,</L>
<L N="150">Union the bond of all things, and of Man.</L>
<L>Pride then was not; nor Arts, that Pride to aid;</L>
<L>Man walk'd with beast, joint tenant of the shade;</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="132"/>
The same his table, and the same his bed;</L>
<L>No murder cloath'd him, and no murder fed.</L>
<L N="155">In the same temple, the resounding wood,</L>
<L>All vocal beings hymn'd their equal God:</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="133"/>
The shrine with gore unstain'd, with gold undrest,</L>
<L>Unbrib'd, unbloody, stood the blameless priest:</L>
<L>Heav'n's attribute was Universal Care,</L>
<L N="160">And Man's prerogative to rule, but spare.</L>
<L>Ah! how unlike the man of times to come!</L>
<L>Of half that live the butcher and the tomb;</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="134"/>
Who, foe to Nature, hears the gen'ral groan,</L>
<L>Murders their species, and betrays his own.</L>
<L N="165">But just disease to luxury succeeds,</L>
<L>And ev'ry death it's own avenger breeds;</L>
<L>The Fury-passions from that blood began,</L>
<L>And turn'd on Man a fiercer savage, Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See him from Nature rising slow to Art!</L>
<L N="170">To copy Instinct then was Reason's part;</L>
<L><PB N="89" REF="135"/>
Thus then to Man the voice of Nature spake—</L>
<L>"Go, from the Creatures thy instructions take:</L>
<L>"Learn from the birds what food the thickets yield;</L>
<L>"Learn from the beasts the physic of the field;</L>
<L N="175">"Thy arts of building from the bee receive;</L>
<L>"Learn of the mole to plow, the worm to weave;</L>
<L>"Learn of the little Nautilus to sail,</L>
<L>"Spread the thin oar, and catch the driving gale.</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="136" MS="y"/>
"Here too all forms of social union find,</L>
<L>"And hence let Reason, late, instruct Mankind:</L>
<L N="181">"Here subterranean works and cities see;</L>
<L>"There towns aerial on the waving tree.</L>
<L>"Learn each small People's genius, policies,</L>
<L>"The Ant's republic, and the realm of Bees;</L>
<L>"How those in common all their wealth bestow,</L>
<L N="186">"And Anarchy without confusion know;</L>
<L>"And these for ever, tho' a Monarch reign,</L>
<L>"Their sep'rate cells and properties maintain.</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="137"/>
"Mark what unvary'd laws preserve each state,</L>
<L N="190">"Laws wise as Nature, and as fix'd as Fate.</L>
<L>"In vain thy Reason finer webs shall draw,</L>
<L>"Entangle Justice in her net of Law,</L>
<L>"And right, too rigid, harden into wrong;</L>
<L>"Still for the strong too weak, the weak too strong.</L>
<L N="195">"Yet go! and thus o'er all the creatures sway,</L>
<L>"Thus let the wiser make the rest obey;</L>
<L>"And for those Arts mere Instinct could afford,</L>
<L>"Be crown'd as Monarchs, or as Gods ador'd."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>V. Great Nature spoke; observant Men obey'd;</L>
<L N="200">Cities were built, Societies were made:</L>
<L>Here rose one little state; another near</L>
<L>Grew by like means, and join'd, thro' love or fear.</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="138"/>
Did here the trees with ruddier burdens bend,</L>
<L>And there the streams in purer rills descend?</L>
<L>What War could ravish, Commerce could bestow,</L>
<L N="206">And he return'd a friend, who came a foe.</L>
<L>Converse and Love mankind might strongly draw,</L>
<L>When Love was Liberty, and Nature Law.</L>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY</HEAD>
<P>WE are now come to the third epistle of the Essay on Man. It having been shewn, in explaining the origin, use, and end of the Passions, in the second epistle, that Man hath social as well as selfish passions, that doctrine naturally introduceth the third, which treats of Man as a SOCIAL animal; and connects it with the second, which considered him as an INDIVIDUAL. And as the conclusion from the subject of the first epistle made the introduction to the second, so here again, the conclusion of the second
<Q><L>(Ev'n mean Self-love becomes, by force divine,</L>
<L>The scale to measure others wants by thine.)</L></Q>
maketh the introduction to the third.</P>
<P>VER. 1.</P>
<P><Q><L>Here then we rest: "The Universal Cause</L>
<L>"Acts to one end, but acts by various laws."]</L></Q>
The reason of <HI>variety</HI> in those laws, which tend to <HI>one</HI> and the same <HI>end,</HI> the good of the Whole generally, is, because the good of the individual is likewise to be provided for; both which toge∣ther make up the good of the Whole universally. And this is the cause, as the poet says elsewhere, that
<Q><L>Each individual seeks a sev'ral goal.</L></Q>
But to prevent our resting there, God hath made each need the assistance of another; and so
<Q><L>On mutual wants built mutual happiness.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="120" MS="y"/>
It was necessary to explain these two first lines, the better to see the pertinency and force of what followeth (from ℣ 2 to 7) where the poet warns such to take notice of this truth, whose circumstances placing them in an imaginary station of Indepen∣dence, and a real one of Insensibility to mutual Wants (from whence general Happiness results) make them but too apt to overlook the true system of things; <HI>viz.</HI> Men in full health and opulence. This caution was necessary with regard to Society; but still more necessary with regard to Religion: Therefore he especially recommends the memory of it both to Clergy and Laity, when they preach or pray; because the preacher, who doth not consider the first Cause under this view, as a Being consulting the good of the whole, must needs give a very un∣worthy idea of him; and the supplicant, who prayeth as one not related to a whole, or as disregarding the happiness of it, will not only pray in vain, but offend his Maker by an im∣pious attempt to counter-work his dispensation.</P>
<P>VER. 7. <HI>Look round our World;</HI> &amp;c.] Next he introduceth his system of human Sociability (℣ 7, 8) by shewing it to be the
<PB N="75" REF="121" MS="y"/>
dictate of the Creator; and that Man, in this, did but follow the example of general Nature, which is united in one close system of benevolence.</P>
<P>VER. 9. <HI>See plastic Nature working to this end,]</HI> This he proveth, <HI>first</HI> (from ℣ 8 to 13) on the noble theory of Attraction, from the oeconomy of the material world; where there is a ge∣neral conspiracy in all the particles of Matter to work for one end; the use, beauty, and harmony of the whole mass.</P>
<P>VER. 13. <HI>See Matter next,</HI> &amp;c.] The <HI>second</HI> argument (from ℣ 12 to 27) is taken from the vegetable and animal world; whose Beings serve mutually for the production, sup∣port, and sustentation of each other.</P>
<P>But this part of the argument, in which the poet tell us, that God
<Q><L>Connects each being, greatest with the least;</L>
<L>Made Beast in aid of Man, and Man of Beast;</L>
<L>All serv'd, all serving—</L></Q>
<PB N="76" REF="122" MS="y"/>
awaking again the old pride of his adversaries, who cannot bear that Man should be thought to be <HI>serving</HI> as well as <HI>served;</HI> he takes this occasion again to humble them (from ℣ 26 to 49) by the same kind of argument he had so successfully employed in the first epistle, and which our comment on that epistle hath considered at large.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="124" MS="y"/>
VER. 49. <HI>Grant that the pow'rful still the weak controul;]</HI> However, his adversaries, loth to give up the question, will reason upon the matter; and we are now to suppose them objecting against Providence in this manner.—We grant, say they, that in the irrational, as in the inanimate creation, all is <HI>served,</HI> and all is <HI>serving:</HI> But, with regard to Man, the case is different; he standeth single. For his Reason hath endowed him both with power and address sufficient to make all things serve him; and his Self-love, of which you have so largely provided for him, will dispose him, in his turn, to serve none: Therefore your theory is imperfect.—Not so, replies the poet (from ℣ 48 to 79) I grant that Man, indeed, affects to be the Wit and Ty∣rant of the whole, and would fain shake off
<Q><L>—that chain of love,</L>
<L>Combining all below and all above:</L></Q>
But Nature, even by the very gift of Reason, checks this tyrant. For Reason endowing Man with the ability of setting together the memory of the past with his conjectures about the future; and past misfortunes making him apprehensive of more to come, this disposeth him to pity and relieve others in a state of suffer∣ing. And the passion growing habitual, naturally extendeth its
<PB N="79" REF="125"/>
effects to all that have a sense of suffering. Now as brutes have neither Man's Reason, nor his inordinate Self-love, to draw them from the system of Benevolence; so they wanted not, and therefore have not, this human sympathy of another's misery. By which passion, we see, those qualities, in Man, balance one another; and so retain him in that general Order, in which Providence hath placed its whole creation. But this is not all; Man's interest, amusement, vanity, and luxury, tie him still closer to the system of benevolence, by obliging him to provide for the support of other animals; and though it be, for the most part, only to devour them with the greater gust, yet this does not abate the proper happiness of the animals so pre∣served, to whom Providence hath not imparted the useless knowledge of their end. From all which it appears, that the theory is yet uniform and perfect.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="126" MS="y"/>
VER. 79. <HI>Whether with Reason,</HI> &amp;c.] But even to this, as a caviller would still object, we must suppose him so to do, and say,—Admit you have shewn that Nature hath endowed all ani∣mals, whether human or brutal, with such faculties as admira∣bly fit them to promote the general good: yet, in its care for this, hath not Nature neglected to provide for the private good of the individual? We have cause to think she hath; and we suppose, it was on this exclusive consideration that she kept back from brutes the gift of Reason (so necessary a means of private happiness) because Reason, as we find in the instance of
<PB N="81" REF="127"/>
<HI>Man,</HI> where there is occasion for all the complicated contrivance you have described above, to make the effects of his Passions counter-work the immediate powers of his Reason, in order to keep him subservient to the general system; Reason, we say, naturally tends to draw Beings into a private, independent system. This the poet answers, by shewing (from ℣ 78 to 109) that the happiness of animal and that of human life are widely dif∣ferent: The happiness of human life consisting in the improve∣ment of the mind, can be procured by Reason only; but the happiness of animal life consisting in the gratifications of sense, is best promoted by Instinct. And, with regard to the regular and constant operation of each, in <HI>that,</HI> Instinct hath plainly the advantage; for here God directs immediately; there, only mediately through Man.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="128" MS="y"/>
VER. 109. <HI>God, in the nature of each being,</HI> &amp;c.] The au∣thor now cometh to the main subject of his epistle, the proof of Man's SOCIABILITY, from the two general societies com∣posed by him; the <HI>natural,</HI> subject to <HI>paternal</HI> authority; and the <HI>civil,</HI> subject to that of a <HI>magistrate.</HI> This he hath the ad∣dress to introduce, from what had preceded, in so easy and na∣tural
<PB N="83" REF="129"/>
a manner, as sheweth him to have the art of giving all the grace to the dryness and severity of Method, as well as wit to the strength and depth of Reason. The philosophic na∣ture of his work requiring he should shew by what means those Societies were introduced, this affords him an opportunity of sliding gracefully and easily from the preliminaries into the main subject; and so of giving his work that perfection of method, which we find only in the compositions of great writers. For having just before, though to a different purpose, described the power of bestial Instinct to attain the happiness of the <HI>Indivi∣dual,</HI> he goeth on, in speaking of Instinct as it is serviceable both to that, and to the <HI>Kind</HI> (from ℣ 108 to 147) to illustrate the original of <HI>Society.</HI> He sheweth, that though, as he had before observed, God had founded the proper bliss of each crea∣ture in the nature of its own existence; yet these not being independent individuals, but parts of a Whole, God, to bless that Whole, built mutual happiness on mutual wants: Now, for the supply of mutual wants, creatures must necessarily come together; which is the first ground of Society amongst Men. He then proceeds to that called <HI>natural,</HI> subject to <HI>paternal</HI> autho∣rity, and arising from the union of the two sexes; describes the
<PB N="84" REF="130" MS="y"/>
imperfect image of it in brutes; then explains it at large in all its causes and effects. And lastly shews, that as <HI>infact,</HI> like mere animal society, it is founded and preserved by mutual wants, the supplial of which causeth mutual happiness; so is it likewise in <HI>right,</HI> as a rational Society, by equity, gratitude, and the ob∣servance of the relation of things in general.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="131"/>
VER. 147. <HI>Nor think, in Nature's state they blindly trod;]</HI> But the Atheist and Hobbist, against whom Mr. Pope argueth, deny the principle of <HI>Right,</HI> or of natural Justice, before the inven∣tion of civil compact; which, they say, gave Being to it: And accordingly have had the effrontery publicly to declare, <HI>that a state of Nature was a state of War.</HI> This quite subverteth the
<PB N="86" REF="132"/>
poet's <HI>natural</HI> Society: Therefore, after his account of that state, he proceedeth to support the reality of it by overthrowing the oppugnant principle of <HI>no natural Justice;</HI> which he doth (from ℣ 146 to 169) in shewing, by a fine description of the state of Innocence, as represented in Scripture, that a state of Nature was so far from being without natural Justice, that it was, at first, <HI>the reign of God,</HI> where Right and Truth universally prevailed.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="134"/>
VER. 169. <HI>See him from Nature rising slow to Art!]</HI> Strict method (in which, by this time, the reader finds the poet more conversant than some were aware of) leads him next to speak of that Society, which succeeded the <HI>Natural,</HI> namely the <HI>Civil.</HI> He first explains (from ℣ 169 to 199) the intermediate <HI>means</HI> which led Mankind from natural to civil Society. These were the invention and improvement of Arts. For while Mankind lived in a mere state of Nature, there was no need of any other government than the Paternal; but when Arts were found out and improved, then that more perfect form, under the direc∣tion of a Magistrate, became necessary. And for these rea∣sons;
<PB N="89" REF="135"/>
first, to bring those arts, already found, to perfection: And, secondly, to secure the product of them to their rightful proprietors. The poet, therefore, comes now, as we say, to the invention of Arts; but being always intent on the great end for which he wrote his Essay, namely to mortify that Pride which occasions the impious complaints against Providence; he speaks of these inventions as only lessons learnt of mere animals guided by instinct; and thus, at the same time, gives a new instance of the wonderful Providence of God, who has contrived to teach mankind in a way, not only proper to humble human arrogance, but to raise our idea of infinite Wisdom to the greatest pitch. This he does in a <HI>prosopopoeia</HI> the most sublime that ever entered into the human imagination:</P>
<LG>
<PB N="90" REF="136" MS="y"/>
<L>Thus then to Man the voice of Nature spake:</L>
<L>"Go, from the Creatures thy instructions take, &amp;c.</L>
<L>"And for those Arts mere Instinct could afford,</L>
<L>"Be crown'd as Monarchs, or as Gods ador'd."</L>
</LG>
<P>The delicacy of the poet's address in the first part of the last line, is very remarkable. In this paragraph he has given an ac∣count of those intermediate means, that led Mankind from na∣tural to civil Society, namely, the invention and improvement of Arts. Now here, on his conclusion of this account, and his entry upon the description of civil Society itself, he connects the two parts the most gracefully that can be conceived, by this true historical circumstance, that it was the invention of those Arts which raised to the Magistracy in this new Society formed for the perfecting them.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="137"/>
VER. 199. <HI>Great Nature spoke;]</HI> After all this necessary pre∣paration,
<PB N="92" REF="138"/>
the poet shews (from ℣ 198 to 209) how civil Society followed, and the advantages it produced.</P>
<P>VER. 209. <HI>Thus States were form'd;]</HI> Having thus explained the original of Civil Society, he shews us next (from ℣ 208 to 215) that to this Society a <HI>civil magistrate,</HI> properly so called, did belong: And this in confutation of that idle hypothesis which pretends that God conferred the regal title on the Fathers of fa∣milies;
<PB N="93" REF="139" MS="y"/>
from whence men, when they had instituted Society, were to fetch their Governors. On the contrary, our author shews, that a King was unknown, 'till common interest, which led men to institute civil government, led them at the same time to institute a governor. However, that it is true that the same wisdom or valour, which gained regal obedience from sons to the fire, procured kings a paternal authority, and made them con∣sidered as fathers of their people. Which probably was the ori∣ginal (and, while mistaken, continues to be the chief support) of that slavish error; antiquity representing its earliest monarchs under the idea of a common father, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Afterwards indeed they became a kind of foster-fathers, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as Ho∣mer calls one of them: 'Till at length they began to devour that flock they had been so long accustomed to shear; and, as Plu∣tarch says of Cecrops, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> TYPANNON.</P>
<P>VER. 215. <HI>'Till then, by Nature crown'd,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet now returns (at ℣ 215 to 241) to what he had left unfinished in his description of natural Society. This, which appears irregular, is indeed a fine Instance of his thorough knowledge of the art of Method. I will explain it:</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="140"/>
This third epistle, we see, considers Man with respect to So∣ciety; the second, with respect to Himself; and the fourth, with respect to Happiness. But in none of these relations does the poet ever lose sight of him under that in which he stands to God; it will follow, therefore, that speaking of him with respect to So∣ciety, the account would be then most imperfect, were he not at the same time considered with respect to his Religion; for be∣tween these two there is a close, and, while things continue in order, a most interesting connection:
<Q><L>True faith, true policy united ran;</L>
<L>That was but love of God, and this of Man.</L></Q>
Now Religion suffering no change or depravation, when Man first entered into civil Society, but continuing the same as in the state of Nature; the author, to avoid repetition, and to bring the accounts of <HI>true</HI> and <HI>false</HI> religion nearer to one another, in or∣der to contrast them by the advantage of that situation, deferred giving account of his <HI>Religion</HI> till he had spoken of the origin of that Society. Thence it is that he here resumes the account of the state of Nature, that is, so much of it as he had left un∣touched, which was only the Religion of it. This consisting in
<PB N="95" REF="141"/>
the knowledge of one God, the creator of all things, he shews how Men came by that knowledge: That it was either found out by Reason, which giving to every effect a cause, instructed them to go from cause to cause, till they came to the first, who being causeless, would necessarily be judged self-existent: or else taught by Tradition, which preserved the memory of the Crea∣tion. He then tells us <HI>what</HI> these men, undebauched by false science, understood by God's Nature and Attributes: <HI>First,</HI> of God's <HI>Nature,</HI> that they easily distinguished between the Worker and the Work, saw the substance of the Creator to be distinct and different from that of the creature, and so were in no dan∣ger of falling into the horrid opinion of the Greek philosophers, and their follower, Spinoza. And simple Reason teaching them that the Creator was but One, they easily saw that all was right, and were in as little danger of falling into the Manichean error; which, when oblique Wit had broken the steddy light of Reason, imagined all was not right, having before imagined all was not the work of One. <HI>Secondly,</HI> he shews what they understood of God's <HI>Attributes;</HI> that they easily conceived a Father where they
<PB N="96" REF="142"/>
had found a Deity; and that a sovereign being could only be a sovereign Good.</P>
<P>VER. 241. <HI>Who first taught souls enslav'd,</HI> &amp;c.] Order lead∣eth the poet to speak next (from ℣ 240 to 246) of the cor∣ruption of <HI>civil Society</HI> into <HI>Tyranny,</HI> and its Causes; and here, with all the art of address as well as truth, he observes it arose from the violation of that great Principle, which he so much insists upon throughout his Essay, <HI>that each was made for the use</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="143"/>
<HI>of all.</HI> We may be sure, that, in this corruption, where natural justice was thrown aside, and force, the Atheist's justice, pre∣sided in its stead, <HI>Religion</HI> would follow the fate of civil Society: We know, from ancient history, it did so. Accordingly Mr. Pope (from ℣ 245 to 269) with corrupt Politics describes corrupt Religion and its Causes: he first informs us, agreeable to his exact knowledge of Antiquity, that it was the Politician and not the Priest (as our illiterate tribe of Free-thinkers would make us believe) who first corrupted Religion. Secondly, That the Su∣perstition he brought in was not invented by him, as an engine to play upon others (as the dreaming Atheist feigns, who would thus miserably account for the origin of Religion) but was a trap he first fell into himself.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="145"/>
VER. 269. <HI>So drives Self-love,</HI> &amp;c.] The inference our au∣thor draws from all this (from ℣ 268 to 283) is, that Self-love driveth through right and wrong; it causeth the Tyrant to violate the rights of mankind; and it causeth the People to vindicate that violation. For Self-love being common to the whole species, and setting each individual in pursuit of the same objects, it became necessary for each, if he would secure his own, to provide for the safety of another's. And thus Equity and Benevolence arose from that same Self-love which had given birth to Avarice and Injustice:
<Q><L>His Safety must his Liberty restrain;</L>
<L>All join to guard what each desires to gain.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="146"/>
There is not any where shewn greater address in the disposi∣tion of this work than with regard to the inference before us; which not only giveth a proper and timely support to what was before advanced, in the second epistle, concerning the nature and effects of Self-love; but is a necessary introduction to what follows, concerning the reformation of Religion and So∣ciety, as we shall see presently.</P>
<P>VER. 283. <HI>'Twas then, the studious head</HI> &amp;c.] The poet hath now described the rise, perfection, and decay of civil Policy and
<PB N="101" REF="147" MS="y"/>
Religion, in the more early times. But the design had been imperfect, had he here dropt his discourse: there was, in after ages, a recovery from their several corruptions. Accordingly, he hath chosen that happy Aera for the conclusion of his song. But as good and ill Governments and Religions succeed one another without ceasing, he now leaveth facts, and turneth his discourse (from ℣ 282 to 295) to speak of a more lasting re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm of mankind, in the Invention of those philosophic Principles, by whose observance a Policy and Religion may be for ever kept from sinking into Tyranny and Superstition:</P>

Social; and shewing that they are only two different motions of the appetite to Good; by which the Author of Nature hath en∣abled Man to find his own happiness in the happiness of the Whole. This he illustrates with a thought as sublime as that general harmony he describes:</P>

<P>VER. 159. <HI>Heav'n's attri∣bute,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet supposes the truth of the Scripture ac∣count, that Man was created Lord of this inferior world (Ep. i. ℣ 230.)

Scrip∣ture says, that Man was made Lord of All.

<P>It is true, the poet observes, that afterwards, when the Ty∣rant's fright was over, he had cunning enough, from the ex∣perience of the effect of Su∣perstition upon himself, to turn it by the assistance of the Priest (who for his reward went sharer with him in the Tyran∣ny) as his best defence against his Subjects.

The ancient Pagan Gods are here very exactly described.

For Force being the Tyrant's Vir∣tue, and Luxury his Happiness, the attributes of his God would of course be Revenge and Lust; in a word, the anti-type of himself. But there was ano∣ther, and more substantial cause, of the resemblance be∣tween a Tyrant and a Pagan god; and that was the making <HI>Gods of Conquerors,</HI> as the poet says, and so canonizing a ty∣rant's vices with his person.

VER. 295. <HI>Such is the World's great harmony,</HI> &amp;c.] An harmony very different from the <HI>pre-established har∣mony</HI> of the celebrated Leib∣nitz, which establisheth a Fa∣tality destructive of all Reli∣gion and Morality. Yet hath the poet been accused of es∣pousing that impious whimsy. The <HI>pre-established harmony</HI> was built upon, and is an outrage∣ous extension of a conception of Plato; who, combating the atheistical objections about the <HI>origin of Evil,</HI> employs this argument in defence of Providence; <Q>“That amongst an infinite number of pos∣sible worlds in God's idea, this, which he hath created and brought into being, and which admits of a mixture of Evil, is the best. But if the best, then Evil conse∣quently is partial, compara∣tively small, and tendeth to the greater perfection of the whole.”</Q> This Principle is espoused and supported by Mr. Pope with all the power of reason and poetry. But nei∣ther was Plato a Fatalist, nor is there any fatalism in the ar∣gument. As to the truth of the notion, that is another question; and how far it clear∣eth up the very difficult con∣troversy about the origin of Evil, is still another. That it
<PB N="103" REF="149"/>
is a full solution of all difficul∣ties, I cannot think, for rea∣sons too long to be given in this place. Perhaps we shall never have a full solution in this world: and it may be no great matter though we have not, as we are demonstrably certain of the moral attributes of the Deity. However, Mr. Pope may be justified in re∣ceiving and inforcing this Pla∣tonic notion, as it hath been adopted by the most celebrat∣ed and orthodox divines both of the ancient and modern church.</P>
<P>This doctrine, we own then, was taken up by Leibnitz; but it was to ingraft upon it a most pernicious fatalism. Plato said, God <HI>chose</HI> the best: Leibnitz said, he <HI>could not but</HI> chuse the best. Plato supposed freedom in God to chuse one of two things equally good: Leibnitz held the supposition to be ab∣surd; but however, admitting the case, he maintained that God could <HI>not</HI> chuse one of two things equally good. Thus it appears, the first went on the system of <HI>Freedom;</HI> and that the latter, notwithstanding the most artful disguises in his Theodicée, was a thorough <HI>Fatalist:</HI> For we cannot well suppose he would give that freedom to Man which he had taken away from God. The truth of the matter seems to be this; he saw, on the one hand, the monstrous absurdity of supposing with Spinoza, that blind Fate was the au∣thor of a coherent Universe; but yet, on the other, could not conceive with Plato, that God could foresee and con∣duct, according to an arche∣typal idea, a World, of all pos∣sible Worlds the best, inhabited by <HI>free Agents.</HI> This difficul∣ty therefore, which made the Socinians take Prescience from God, disposed Leibnitz to take Free-will from Man: And thus he fashioned his fantastical hy∣pothesis; he supposed that when God made the body, he im∣pressed on his new cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated Ma∣chine a certain series or suite of <HI>motions;</HI> and that when he made the fellow soul, a cor∣respondent series of <HI>ideas;</HI> whose operations, throughout the whole duration of the uni∣on, so exactly jumped, that whenever an <HI>idea</HI> was excited, a concordant <HI>motion</HI> was ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r
<PB N="104" REF="150" MS="y"/>
ready to satisfy the volition. Thus, for instance, when the mind had the <HI>will</HI> to raise the arm to the head, the body was so pre-contrived, as to raise, at that very moment, the part required. This he called the PRE-ESTABLISHED HARMO∣NY; and, with this, he pro∣mised to do wonders.</P>
<P>VER. 303. <HI>For Forms of Go∣vernment</HI> &amp;c.] These fine lines have been strangely misunder∣stood: the author, against his own express words, against the plain sense of his system, has been conceived to mean, That all Governments and all Reli∣gions were, as to their forms and objects, indifferent. But as this wrong judgment proceed∣ed from ignorance of the rea∣son of the reproof, as explain∣ed above, that explanation is alone sufficient to rectify the mistake.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="151"/>
However, not to leave him under the least suspicion in a matter of so much importance, I shall justify the sense here given to this passage more at large: <HI>First,</HI> by considering the words themselves; and then, by comparing this mis∣taken sense with the context.</P>
<P>The poet, we may observe, is here speaking, not of civil Society <HI>at large,</HI> but of a <HI>just</HI> legitimate Policy:
<Q><L>Th'according music of a <HI>well-mix'd</HI> State.</L></Q>
Now mix'd States are of se∣veral kinds; in some of which the Democratic, in others the Aristocratic, and in others the Monarchic form prevails. Now as each of these mix'd Forms is equally legitimate, as being founded on the principles of natural Liberty, that man is guilty of the highest folly, who chuseth rather to employ him∣self in a speculative contest for the superior excellence of one of these <HI>Forms</HI> to the rest, than in promoting the good admi∣nistration of that settled <HI>Form</HI> to which he is subject. And yet all our warm disputes about Government have been of this kind. Again, if by <HI>Forms</HI> of Government must needs be meant Legitimate Govern∣ment, because that is the sub∣ject under debate; then by <HI>Modes</HI> of Faith, which is the correspondent idea, must needs be meant the modes or expla∣nations of the True Faith, be∣cause the author is here too on the subject of true Religion:
<Q><L>Relum'd her ancient light, not kindled new.</L></Q>
Besides, the very expression (than which nothing can be more precise) confineth us to understand, by <HI>Modes</HI> of Faith, those human explanations of Christian Mysteries, in con∣testing which, Zeal and Igno∣rance have so perpetually vio∣lated Charity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If we consider the <HI>context;</HI> to suppose him to mean, that <HI>all Forms</HI> of <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> are indifferent, is making him directly contra∣dict the preceding paragraph; where he extols the Patriot for discriminating the <HI>true</HI> from the <HI>false</HI> modes of Govern∣ment. He, says the poet,</P>
<LG>
<L>Taught Pow'r's <HI>due</HI> use to People and to Kings,</L>
<L>Taught nor to <HI>slack,</HI> nor <HI>strain</HI> its tender strings;</L>
<L>The less and greater set so justly <HI>true,</HI></L>
<L>That touching one must strike the other too;</L>
<L>'Till jarring int'rests of themselves create</L>
<L>Th'<HI>according</HI> music of a <HI>well-mix'd</HI> State.</L>
</LG>
<P>Here he recommendeth the <HI>true</HI> Form of Government, which is the <HI>mix'd.</HI> In ano∣ther place he as strongly con∣demneth the <HI>false,</HI> or the ab∣solute <HI>jure divino</HI> Form:
<Q><L>For Nature knew no right divine in Men.</L></Q>
But the Reader will not be dis∣pleased to see the Poet's own apology, as I find it written in the year 1740, in his own hand, in the margin of a book, where he found these two celebrated lines misapplied. <Q>“The author of these lines was far from meaning that no one form of Govern∣ment is, in itself, better than another (as, that mixed or limited Monarchy, for ex∣ample, is not preferable to absolute) but that no form of Government, however excellent or preferable, in itself, can be sufficient to make a people happy, un∣less it be administered with integrity. On the contrary, the best sort of Govern∣ment, when the <HI>form</HI> of it is preserved, and the <HI>ad∣ministration</HI> corrupt, is most dangerous.”</Q></P>
<P>Again, to suppose the Poet to mean, that <HI>all Religions</HI> are in∣different, is an equally wrong as well as uncharitable suspi∣cion. Mr. Pope, though his subject in this <HI>Essay on Man</HI> confineth him to Natural reli∣gion (his purpose being to vin∣dicate God's natural dispen∣sations to Mankind against the Atheist) yet giveth frequent intimations of a more sublime dispensation, and even of the necessity of it; particularly in his second epistle (℣ 149, &amp;c.) where he confesseth the weak∣ness and insufficiency of hu∣man Reason.</P>
<P>And in his fourth epistle, where, speaking of the good Man, the favourite of Hea∣ven, he sayeth,</P>
<LG>
<PB N="107" REF="153"/>
<L>For him alone <HI>Hope</HI> leads from goal to goal,</L>
<L>And opens still, and opens on his soul;</L>
<L>'Till, lengthen'd on to <HI>Faith,</HI> and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>It pours the bliss that fills up all the Mind.</L>
</LG>
<P>But Natural Religion never lengthened Hope on to Faith; nor did any Religion, but the Christian, ever conceive that Faith could fill the Mind with Happiness.</P>
<P>Lastly, In this very epistle, and in this very place, speak∣ing of the great Restorers of the <HI>religion of Nature,</HI> he inti∣mates that they could only draw God's <HI>shadow,</HI> not his <HI>image:</HI>
<Q><L>Re-lum'd her ancient light, not kindled new,</L>
<L>If not God's image, yet his shadow drew:</L></Q>
as reverencing that truth, which telleth us, this disco∣very was reserved for the <HI>glo∣rious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God.</HI> 2 Cor. iv. 4.</P>
<P>VER. 305. <HI>For Modes of Faith let graceless zealots fight;]</HI> These latter Ages have seen so many scandalous contentions for <HI>modes of Faith,</HI> to the vio∣lation of Christian Charity, and dishonour of sacred Scrip∣ture, that it is not at all strange they should become the object of so benevolent and wise an Author's resentment.</P>
<P>But that which he here seemed to have more particu∣larly in his eye was the long and mischievous squabble be∣tween W—d and JACKSON, on a point confessedly above Reason, and amongst those adorable mysteries which it is the honour of our Religion to find unfathomable. In this, by the weight of answers and replies, redoubled upon one another without mercy, they

made so profound a progress, that the <HI>One</HI> proved, nothing hindered, in Nature, but that <HI>the Son might have been the Fa∣ther;</HI> and the <HI>Other,</HI> that no∣thing hindered, in Grace, but that <HI>the Son may be a mere Creature.</HI> In a word, they made all things disputable but their own dullness; and this they left unquestioned; and it was the only thing they did leave, of which their readers could be certain. But if, in∣stead of throwing so many Greek Fathers at one ano∣ther's heads, they had but chanced to reflect on the sense of one Greek word, A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>EIPIA, that it signifies both INFINITY and IGNORANCE, this single <HI>equivocation</HI> might have saved them ten thousand▪ which they expended in carrying on the controversy. However those <HI>Mists that magnified the Scene,</HI> enlarged the Character of the Combatants: and no body ex∣pecting <HI>common</HI> sense on a sub∣ject where we have no ideas, the defects of dulness disap∣peared, and its advantages (for, advantages it has) were all provided for.</P>
<P>The worst is, such kind of Writers seldom know when to have done. For writing themselves up into the same delusion with their Readers, they are apt to venture out
<PB N="109" REF="155"/>
into the more open paths of Literature, where their repu∣tation, made out of that stuff, which Lucian calls <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, presently falls from them, and their nakedness appears. And thus it fared with our two Worthies. The World, which must have always some∣thing to amuse it, was now in good time grown weary of its play-things, and catched at a new object that promised them more agreeable entertainment. Tindal, a kind of Bastard-Socrates, had brought our spe∣culations from <HI>Heaven</HI> to <HI>Earth:</HI> and, under the pre∣tence of advancing the Anti∣quity of Christianity, laboured to undermine its original. This was a controversy that required another management. Clear sense, severe reasoning, a thorough knowledge of pro∣phane and sacred Antiquity, and an intimate acquaintance with human Nature, were the qualities to determine upon this Question. A very unpro∣mising adventure for these metaphysical nurslings, bred up under the shade of chi∣meras. Yet they would needs venture out. What they got by it was only to be once well laughed at, and then forgotten. But one odd circumstance de∣serves to be remembered; tho' they wrote not, you may be sure, in concert, yet each at∣tacked his Adversary at the same time, fastened upon him in the same place, and mum∣bled him just in the same manner. But the ill success of this escape soon brought them to themselves. The One made a fruitless effort to re∣vive the old game, in a dis∣course on <HI>The importance of the Doctrine of the Trinity;</HI> and the Other has been ever since, till very lately, rambling in SPACE.</P>
<P>This short history, as insig∣nificant as the subjects of it are, may not be altogether unuse∣ful to posterity. Divines may learn by these examples to avoid the mischiefs done to Religion and Literature thro' the affectation of being wise above what is written, and knowing beyond what can be understood.</P>

<HEAD>EPISTLE IV.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>OH HAPPINESS! our being's end and aim!</L>
<L>Good, Pleasure, Ease, Content! whate'er thy name:</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="161"/>
That something still which prompts th'eternal sigh,</L>
<L>For which we bear to live, or dare to die,</L>
<L N="5">Which still so near us, yet beyond us lies,</L>
<L>O'er-look'd, seen double, by the fool, and wise.</L>
<L>Plant of celestial seed! if dropt below,</L>
<L>Say, in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow?</L>
<L><PB N="113" REF="162"/>
Fair op'ning to some Court's propitious shine,</L>
<L N="10">Or deep with di'monds in the flaming mine?</L>
<L>Twin'd with the wreaths Parnassian lawrels yield,</L>
<L>Or reap'd in iron harvests of the field?</L>
<L>Where grows?—where grows it not? If vain our toil,</L>
<L>We ought to blame the culture, not the soil:</L>
<L N="15">Fix'd to no spot is Happiness sincere,</L>
<L>'Tis no where to be found, or ev'ry where;</L>
<L>'Tis never to be bought, but always free,</L>
<L>And fled from monarchs, ST. JOHN! dwells with thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ask of the Learn'd the way? The Learn'd are blind;</L>
<L N="20">This bids to serve, and that to shun mankind;</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="163"/>
Some place the bliss in action, some in ease,</L>
<L>Those call it Pleasure, and Contentment these;</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="164" MS="y"/>
Some sunk to Beasts, find pleasure end in pain;</L>
<L>Some swell'd to Gods, confess ev'n Virtue vain;</L>
<L N="25">Or indolent, to each extreme they fall,</L>
<L>To trust in ev'ry thing, or doubt of all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who thus define it, say they more or less</L>
<L>Than this, that Happiness is Happiness?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take Nature's path, and mad Opinion's leave;</L>
<L N="30">All states can reach it, and all heads conceive;</L>
<L>Obvious her goods, in no extreme they dwell;</L>
<L>There needs but thinking right, and meaning well;</L>
<L>And mourn our various portions as we please,</L>
<L>Equal is Common Sense, and Common Ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="116" REF="165"/>
<L N="35">Remember, Man, "the Universal Cause</L>
<L>"Acts not by partial, but by gen'ral laws;"</L>
<L>And makes what Happiness we justly call</L>
<L>Subsist not in the good of one, but all.</L>
<L>There's not a blessing Individuals find,</L>
<L N="40">But some way leans and hearkens to the kind:</L>
<L>No Bandit fierce, no Tyrant mad with pride,</L>
<L>No cavern'd Hermit, rests self-satisfy'd:</L>
<L>Who most to shun or hate Mankind pretend,</L>
<L>Seek an admirer, or would fix a friend:</L>
<L N="45">Abstract what others feel, what others think,</L>
<L>All pleasures sicken, and all glories sink:</L>
<L>Each has his share; and who would more obtain,</L>
<L>Shall find, the pleasure pays not half the pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ORDER is Heav'n's first law; and this confest,</L>
<L N="50">Some are, and must be, greater than the rest,</L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="166"/>
More rich, more wise; but who infers from hence</L>
<L>That such are happier, shocks all common sense.</L>
<L>Heav'n to Mankind impartial we confess,</L>
<L>If all are equal in their Happiness:</L>
<L N="55"><PB N="118" REF="167"/>
But mutual wants this Happiness increase;</L>
<L>All Nature's diff'rence keeps all Nature's peace.</L>
<L>Condition, circumstance is not the thing;</L>
<L>Bliss is the same in subject or in king,</L>
<L>In who obtain defence, or who defend,</L>
<L N="60">In him who is, or him who finds a friend:</L>
<L>Heav'n breaths thro' ev'ry member of the whole</L>
<L>One common blessing, as one common soul.</L>
<L>But Fortune's gifts if each alike possest,</L>
<L>And each were equal, must not all contest?</L>
<L N="65">If then to all Men Happiness was meant,</L>
<L>God in Externals could not place Content.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fortune her gifts may variously dispose,</L>
<L>And these be happy call'd, unhappy those;</L>
<L><PB N="119" REF="168"/>
But Heav'n's just balance equal will appear,</L>
<L>While those are plac'd in Hope, and these in Fear:</L>
<L N="71">Not present good or ill, the joy or curse,</L>
<L>But future views of better, or of worse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh sons of earth! attempt ye still to rise,</L>
<L>By mountains pil'd on mountains, to the skies?</L>
<L N="75">Heav'n still with laughter the vain toil surveys,</L>
<L>And buries madmen in the heaps they raise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Know, all the good that individuals find,</L>
<L>Or God and Nature meant to mere Mankind,</L>
<L><PB N="120" REF="169" MS="y"/>
Reason's whole pleasure, all the joys of Sense,</L>
<L>Lie in three words, Health, Peace, and Competence.</L>
<L N="81">But Health consists with Temperance alone;</L>
<L>And Peace, on Virtue! Peace is all thy own.</L>
<L>The good or bad the gifts of Fortune gain;</L>
<L>But these less taste them, as they worse obtain.</L>
<L N="85"><PB N="121" REF="170"/>
Say, in pursuit of profit or delight,</L>
<L>Who risk the most, that take wrong means, or right?</L>
<L>Of Vice or Virtue, whether blest or curst,</L>
<L>Which meets contempt, or which compassion first?</L>
<L>Count all th'advantage prosp'rous Vice attains,</L>
<L N="90">'Tis but what Virtue flies from and disdains:</L>
<L>And grant the bad what happiness they wou'd,</L>
<L>One they must want, which is, to pass for good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh blind to truth, and God's whole scheme below,</L>
<L N="94">Who fancy Bliss to Vice, to Virtue Woe!</L>
<L><PB N="122" REF="171" MS="y"/>
Who sees and follows that great scheme the best,</L>
<L>Best knows the blessing, and will most be blest.</L>
<L>But fools, the Good alone, unhappy call,</L>
<L>For ills or accidents that chance to all.</L>
<L>See FALKLAND dies, the virtuous and the just!</L>
<L N="100">See god-like TURENNE prostrate on the dust!</L>
<L><PB N="123" REF="172" MS="y"/>
See SIDNEY bleeds amid the martial strife!</L>
<L>Was this their Virtue, or Contempt of Life?</L>
<L>Say, was it Virtue, more tho' Heav'n ne'er gave,</L>
<L>Lamented DIGBY! sunk thee to the grave?</L>
<L N="105">Tell me, if Virtue made the Son expire,</L>
<L>Why, full of days and honour, lives the Sire?</L>
<L>Why drew Marseille's good bishop purer breath,</L>
<L>When Nature sicken'd, and each gale was death!</L>
<L>Or why so long (in life if long can be)</L>
<L N="110">Lent Heav'n a parent to the poor and me?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What makes all physical or moral ill?</L>
<L>There deviates Nature, and here wanders Will.</L>
<L><PB N="124" REF="173" MS="y"/>
God sends not ill; if rightly understood,</L>
<L>Or partial Ill is universal Good,</L>
<L N="115">Or Change admits, or Nature lets it fall;</L>
<L>Short, and but rare, till Man improv'd it all.</L>
<L><PB N="125" REF="174"/>
We just as wisely might of Heav'n complain</L>
<L>That righteous Abel was destroy'd by Cain,</L>
<L>As that the virtuous son is ill at ease</L>
<L N="120">When his lewd father gave the dire disease.</L>
<L>Think we, like some weak Prince, th'Eternal Cause,</L>
<L>Prone for his fav'rites to reverse his laws?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall burning Aetna, if a sage requires,</L>
<L>Forget to thunder, and recall her fires?</L>
<L N="125">On air or sea new motions be imprest,</L>
<L>Oh blameless Bethel! to relieve thy breast?</L>
<L>When the loose mountain trembles from on high,</L>
<L>Shall gravitation cease, if you go by?</L>
<L>Or some old temple, nodding to its fall,</L>
<L N="130">For Chartres' head reserve the hanging wall?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="126" REF="175"/>
<L>But still this world (so fitted for the knave)</L>
<L>Contents us not. A better shall we have?</L>
<L>A kingdom of the Just then let it be:</L>
<L>But first consider how those Just agree.</L>
<L N="135"><PB N="127" REF="176"/>
The good must merit God's peculiar care;</L>
<L>But who, but God, can tell us who they are?</L>
<L>One thinks on Calvin Heav'n's own spirit fell;</L>
<L>Another deems him instrument of hell;</L>
<L>If Calvin feel Heav'n's blessing, or its rod,</L>
<L N="140">This cries there is, and that, there is no God.</L>
<L>What shocks one part will edify the rest,</L>
<L>Nor with one system can they all be blest.</L>
<L>The very best will variously incline,</L>
<L>And what rewards your Virtue, punish mine.</L>
<L><PB N="128" REF="177" MS="y"/>
WHATEVER IS, is RIGHT.—This world, 'tis true,</L>
<L N="146">Was made for Caesar—but for Titus too:</L>
<L>And which more blest? who chain'd his country, say,</L>
<L>Or he whose Virtue sigh'd to lose a day?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"But sometimes Virtue starves, while Vice is fed."</L>
<L N="150">What then? Is the reward of Virtue bread?</L>
<L>That, Vice may merit, 'tis the price of toil;</L>
<L>The knave deserves it, when he tills the soil,</L>
<L>The knave deserves it, when he tempts the main,</L>
<L>Where Folly fights for kings, or dives for gain.</L>
<L N="155">The good man may be weak, be indolent;</L>
<L>Nor is his claim to plenty, but content.</L>
<L>But grant him Riches, your demand is o'er?</L>
<L>"No—shall the good want Health, the good want Pow'r?"</L>
<L><PB N="129" REF="178"/>
Add Health, and Pow'r, and ev'ry earthly thing,</L>
<L N="160">"Why bounded Pow'r? why private? why no "king?"</L>
<L>Nay, why external for internal giv'n?</L>
<L>Why is not Man a God, and Earth a Heav'n?</L>
<L>Who ask and reason thus, will scarce conceive</L>
<L>God gives enough, while he has more to give:</L>
<L>Immense the pow'r, immense were the demand;</L>
<L N="166">Say, at what part of nature will they stand?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What nothing earthly gives, or can destroy,</L>
<L>The soul's calm sun-shine, and the heart-felt joy,</L>
<L>Is Virtue's prize: A better would you fix?</L>
<L N="170">Then give Humility a coach and six,</L>
<L><PB N="130" REF="179"/>
Justice a Conq'ror's sword, or Truth a gown,</L>
<L>Or Public Spirit its great cure, a Crown.</L>
<L>Weak, foolish man! will Heav'n reward us there</L>
<L>With the same trash mad mortals wish for here?</L>
<L N="175">The Boy and Man an individual makes,</L>
<L>Yet sigh'st thou now for apples and for cakes?</L>
<L>Go, like the Indian, in another life</L>
<L>Expect thy dog, thy bottle, and thy wife:</L>
<L>As well as dream such trifles are assign'd,</L>
<L N="180">As toys and empires, for a god-like mind.</L>
<L>Rewards, that either would to Virtue bring</L>
<L>No joy, or be destructive of the thing:</L>
<L><PB N="131" REF="180" MS="y"/>
How oft by these at sixty are undone</L>
<L>The virtues of a saint at twenty-one!</L>
<L N="185">To whom can Riches give Repute, or Trust,</L>
<L>Content, or Pleasure, but the Good and Just?</L>
<L>Judges and Senates have been bought for gold,</L>
<L>Esteem and Love were never to be sold.</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="181"/>
Oh fool! to think God hates the worthy mind,</L>
<L N="190">The lover and the love of human-kind,</L>

<L>Honour and shame from no Condition rise;</L>

<L>Fortune in Men has some small diff'rence made,</L>
<L>One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade;</L>

<L><PB N="133" REF="182" MS="y"/>
You'll find, if once the monarch acts the monk,</L>

<L>Worth makes the man, and want of it, the fellow;</L>
<L N="204">The rest is all but leather or prunella.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stuck o'er with titles and hung round with strings,</L>
<L>That thou may'st be by kings, or whores of kings.</L>
<L>Boast the pure blood of an illustrious race,</L>
<L>In quiet flow from Lucrece to Lucrece:</L>
<L>But by your father's worth if your's you rate,</L>
<L N="210">Count me those only who were good and great.</L>
<L>Go! if your ancient, but ignoble blood</L>

What can ennoble sots, or slaves, or cowards?</L>

<L>Look next on Greatness; say where Greatness lies?</L>
<L>"Where, but among the Heroes and the Wise?"</L>
<L>Heroes are much the same, the point's agreed,</L>
<L N="220">From Macedonia's madman to the Swede;</L>
<L>The whole strange purpose of their lives, to find</L>
<L>Or make, an enemy of all mankind!</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="184" MS="y"/>
Not one looks backward, onward still he goes,</L>

<L>All sly slow things, with circumspective eyes:</L>
<L>Men in their loose unguarded hours they take,</L>
<L>Not that themselves are wise, but others weak.</L>
<L>But grant that those can conquer, these can cheat;</L>
<L N="230">'Tis phrase absurd to call a Villain Great:</L>
<L>Who wickedly is wise, or madly brave,</L>
<L>Is but the more a fool, the more a knave.</L>
<L>Who noble ends by noble means obtains,</L>

Just what you hear, you have, and what's unknown</L>

<L>An Eugene living, as a Caesar dead;</L>
<L N="245">Alike or when, or where, they shone, or shine,</L>

<L>Fame but from death a villain's name can save,</L>
<L N="250">As Justice tears his body from the grave;</L>

<L>All fame is foreign, but of true desert;</L>
<L>Plays round the head, but comes not to the heart:</L>
<L>One self-approving hour whole years out-weighs</L>
<L N="256">Of stupid starers, and of loud huzzas;</L>

And more true joy Marcellus exil'd feels,</L>

<L>In Parts superior what advantage lies?</L>
<L N="260">Tell (for You can) what is it to be wise?</L>

<L>To see all others faults, and feel our own:</L>

<PB N="111" REF="160"/>
<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE two foregoing epistles having considered Man with regard to the <HI>Means</HI> (that is, in all his relations, whether as an Individual, or a Member of Society) this last comes to consider him with regard to the <HI>End,</HI> that is, Happiness.</P>
<P>It opens with an Invocation to Happiness, in the manner of the ancient poets, who, when destitute of a patron God, applied to the Muse, and, if she was engaged, took up with any simple Virtue next at hand, to inspire and prosper their designs. This was the ancient Invocation, which few modern poets have had the art to imitate with any degree either of spirit or decorum; but our author hath contrived to make it subservient to the me∣thod and reasoning of his philosophic composition. I will en∣deavour to explain so uncommon a beauty.</P>
<P>It is to be observed that the Pagan deities had each their se∣veral <HI>names</HI> and <HI>places of abode,</HI> with some of which they were supposed to be more delighted than others, and consequently to be then most propitious when invoked by the favourite name and place: Hence we find, the hymns of Homer, Orpheus, and Callimachus to be chiefly employed in reckoning up the several names and places of abode by which the patron God was distinguished. Our poet hath made these two circumstances
<PB N="112" REF="161"/>
serve to introduce his subject. His purpose is to write of Hap∣piness; method therefore requires that he first define what men mean by Happiness, and this he does in the ornament of a poetic Invocation; in which the several names, that <HI>happiness</HI> goes by, are enumerated.</P>
<Q><L>Oh Happiness! our being's end and aim,</L>
<L>Good, Pleasure, Ease, Content! whate'er thy Name:</L></Q>
<P>After the Definition, that which follows next, is the Proposi∣tion, which is, <HI>that human Happiness consists not in external Ad∣vantages, but in Virtue.</HI> For the subject of this epistle is the de∣tecting the <HI>false</HI> notions of Happiness, and settling and explain∣ing the <HI>true;</HI> and this the poet lays down in the next sixteen lines. Now the enumeration of the several <HI>situations</HI> in which Happiness is supposed to reside, is a summary of <HI>false</HI> Happiness, placed in Externals:</P>
<LG>
<L>Plant of celestial seed! if dropt below,</L>
<L>Say, in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow?</L>
<L>Fair op'ning to some Court's propitious shine,</L>
<L>Or deep with Di'monds in the flaming mine,</L>
<L>Twin'd with the wreaths Parnassian laurels yield,</L>
<L>Or reap'd in iron harvests of the field?</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="113" REF="162"/>
The six remaining lines deliver the <HI>true</HI> notion of Happiness to be in Virtue. Which is summed up in these two:
<Q><L>Fix'd to no spot is Happiness sincere,</L>
<L>'Tis no where to be found, or ev'ry where.</L></Q>
The Poet having thus defined his terms, and laid down his pro∣position, proceeds to the support of his Thesis; the various argu∣ments of which make up the body of the Epistle.</P>
<P>VER. 19. <HI>Ask of the Learn'd</HI> &amp;c.] He begins (from ℣ 18 to 29) with detecting the false notions of Happiness. These are of two kinds, the <HI>Philosophical</HI> and <HI>Popular:</HI> The latter he had re-capitulated in the invocation, when Happiness was called upon at her several supposed places of abode; the Philosophic only remained to be delivered:</P>
<LG>
<L>Ask of the Learn'd the way, the Learn'd are blind;</L>
<L>This bids to serve, and that to shun Mankind:</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="163"/>
Some place the bliss in action, some in ease;</L>
<L>Those call it Pleasure, and Contentment these.</L>
</LG>
<P>They differed as well in the means, as in the nature of the end. Some placed Happiness in Action, some in Contemplation; the first called it Pleasure, the second Ease. Of those who placed it in Action and called it Pleasure, the moral rout they pursued either sunk them into <HI>sensual pleasures,</HI> which ended in <HI>Pain,</HI> or led them in search of <HI>imaginary perfections,</HI> unsuitable to their nature and station (see Ep. i.) which ended in <HI>Vanity.</HI> Of those who placed it in Ease, the contemplative station they were fixed in made some, for their quiet, find truth in <HI>every thing,</HI> others in <HI>nothing.</HI></P>
<P><Q><L>Who thus define it, say they more or less</L>
<L>Than this, that Happiness is Happiness?</L></Q>
The confutation of these Philosophic errors he shews to be very easy, one common fallacy running through them all; namely this, that instead of telling us in what the Happiness of <HI>human nature</HI> consists, which was what was asked of them, each busies himself in explaining in what he placed <HI>his own.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="164" MS="y"/>
VER. 29. <HI>Take Nature's path,</HI> &amp;c.] The Poet then proceeds (from ℣ 28 to 35) to reform their mistakes; and shews them that, if they will but take the road of Nature and leave that of mad Opinion, they will soon find Happiness to be a good of the <HI>species,</HI> and, like Common Sense, equally distributed to all Man∣kind.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="165"/>
VER. 35. <HI>Remember, Man,</HI> &amp;c.] Having exposed the two false species of Happiness, the <HI>Philosophical</HI> and <HI>Popular,</HI> and de∣nounced the true, in order to establish the last, he goes on to a confutation of the two former.</P>
<P>I. He first (from ℣ 34 to 49) confutes the <HI>Philosophical,</HI> which, as we said, makes Happiness a particular, not a general good: And this two ways; 1. From his grand principle, that God acts by general laws; the consequence of which is, that Happiness, which supports the well being of every system, must needs be universal, and not partial, as the Philosophers conceived. 2. From fact, that Man instinctively concurs with this designa∣tion of Providence, to make Happiness universal, by his having no delight in any thing uncommunicated or uncommunicable.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="166"/>
VER. 49. <HI>Order is Heav'n's first law;]</HI> II. In the second place (from ℣ 48 to 67) <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e confutes the popular error concern∣ing Happiness, namely, that it consists in Externals: Which he does, <HI>first,</HI> by inquiring into the reasons of the present providen∣tial disposition of external goods: A topic of consutation chosen with the greatest accuracy and penetration: For, if it appears they were distributed in the manner we see them, for reasons different from the Happiness of Individuals, it is absurd to think that they should make part of that Happiness.</P>
<P>He shews therefore, that disparity of external possessions among Men was for the sake of Society: 1. To promote the Harmony and Happiness of a system; because the want of external goods in some, and the abundance in others, increase general Har∣mony in the obliger and obliged.</P>
<P>Yet here (says he) mark the impartial wisdom of Heaven; this very Inequality of Externals, by contributing to general Har∣mony and Order, produceth an Equality of Happiness amongst Individuals.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="118" REF="167"/>
2. To prevent perpetual discord amongst men equal in power, which an equal distribution of external goods would necessarily occasion. From hence he concludes, that, as external goods were not given for the reward of Virtue, but for many differ∣ent purposes, God could not, if he intended Happiness for all, place it in the Enjoyment of Externals.</P>

<P N="2">2. To prevent perpetual discord amongst men equal in power, which an equal distribution of external goods would necessarily occasion.

<P><HI>VER. 67.</HI> Fortune her gifts may variously dispose,] <HI>His</HI> second
<PB N="119" REF="168"/>
argument (from ℣ 66 to 73) against the popular error of Hap∣piness being placed in Externals, is, that the Possession of them is inseparably attended with Fear; the want of them with Hope; which directly crossing all their pretensions to making happy, evidently shews that God had placed Happiness elsewhere. And hence, in concluding this argument, he takes occasion (from ℣ 72 to 77) to upbraid the desperate folly and impiety of those, who, in spite of God and Nature, will yet attempt to place Happiness in Externals:</P>
<LG>
<L>Oh sons of earth! attempt ye still to rise,</L>
<L>By mountains pil'd on mountains, to the skies?</L>
<L>Heav'n still with laughter the vain toil surveys,</L>
<L>And buries madmen in the heaps they raise.</L>
</LG>
<P>VER. 77. <HI>Know, all the good</HI> &amp;c.] The Poet having thus con∣suted the two errors concerning Happiness, <HI>Philosophical</HI> and <HI>Popular;</HI> and proved that true Happiness was neither solitary and partial, nor yet placed in externals; goes on (from ℣ 76 to 83) to shew in what it doth consist. He had before said in ge∣neral, and repeated it, that Happiness lay in common to the whole species. He now brings us better acquainted with it, in a more explicite account of its nature; and tells us, it is all contained in <HI>Health, Peace,</HI> and <HI>Competence;</HI> but that these are
<PB N="120" REF="169" MS="y"/>
to be gained only by VIRTUE, namely, by Temperance, In∣nocence, and Industry.</P>
<P>VER. 83. <HI>The good or bad,</HI> &amp;c.] But hitherto the poet hath only considered <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Peace:</HI>
<Q><L>But Health consists with Temperance alone;</L>
<L>And Peace, oh Virtue! Peace is all thy own.</L></Q>
One head yet remained to be spoken to, namely, <HI>Competence.</HI> In the pursuit of Health and Peace there is no danger of running into excess; but the case is different with regard to Compe∣tence: here Wealth and Affluence would be too apt to be mis∣taken for it, in Mens passionate pursuit after <HI>external</HI> goods. To obviate this mistake therefore, the poet shews (from ℣ 82 to 93) that, as exorbitant wealth adds nothing to the Happiness arising from a <HI>Competence;</HI> so, as it is generally ill-gotten, it is
<PB N="121" REF="170"/>
attended with circumstances that weaken another part of this triple chord, namely <HI>Peace:</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Reason's whole pleasure, all the joys of Sense,</L>
<L>Lie in three words, Health, Peace, and Competence.</L>
<L>But Health consists in Temperance alone;</L>
<L>And Peace, oh Virtue! Peace is all thy own.</L>
</LG>
<P>VER. 93. <HI>Oh blind to truth,</HI> &amp;c.] Our author having thus largely confuted the mistake of Happiness's consisting in exter∣nals, proceeds to expose the terrible consequences of such an opi∣nion on the sentiments and practice of all sorts of men, making the Dissolute impious and atheistical; the Religious uncharita∣ble and intolerant; and the Good restless and discontent. For when it is once taken for granted, that Happiness consists in ex∣ternals,
<PB N="122" REF="171" MS="y"/>
it is immediately seen that ill men are often more hap∣py than good; which sets all conditions on objecting to the ways of Providence; and some even on rashly attempting to rectify its dispensations, though by the violation of all Law, divine and human. Now this being the most momentous part of the sub∣ject under consideration, is deservedly treated most at large. And here it will be proper to take notice of the art of the poet in making this confutation serve, at the same time, for a full solution of all objections which might he made to his main pro∣position, <HI>that Happiness consists not in externals.</HI></P>
<P>I. He begins, first of all with the Atheistical complainers, and pursues their impiety, from ℣ 93 to 131
<Q><L>Oh! blind to truth, and God's whole scheme below, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 97. <HI>But fools the Good alone unhappy call,</HI> &amp;c.] He ex∣poses their folly even on their own notions of external goods,</P>
<P N="1">1. By examples (from ℣ 98 to 111) where he shews, first, that if good men have been untimely cut off, this is not to be ascribed to their Virtues, but to a contempt of life that hur∣ried
<PB N="123" REF="172" MS="y"/>
them into dangers. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That if they will still persist in ascribing untimely death to Virtue; they must needs, on the same principle, likewise ascribe long life to it: consequently, as the argument, in fact, concludes both ways, in logic it concludes neither.</P>
<LG>
<L>Say, was it Virtue, more tho' Heav'n ne'er gave,</L>
<L>Lamented Digby! sunk thee to the grave?</L>
<L>Tell me, if Virtue made the Son expire,</L>
<L>Why, full of days and honour, lives the Sire?</L>
</LG>
<P>VER. 111. <HI>What makes all physical or moral ill?]</HI> 2. He ex∣poses their folly (from ℣ 100 to 131) by considerations drawn
<PB N="124" REF="173" MS="y"/>
from the system of Nature; and these twofold, natural and mo∣ral You accuse God, says he, because the good man is sub∣ject to natural and moral evil. Let us see whence these pro∣ceed. Natural evil is the necessary consequence of a material world so constituted: But that this constitution was best, we have proved in the first Epistle. Moral evil ariseth from the de∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved will of Man: Therefore neither the one nor the other from God.</P>
<P>But you say (adds the poet, to these impious complainers) that though it be fit Man should suffer the miseries which he brings upon himself by the commission of moral evil, yet it seems unfit that his innocent posterity should bear a share of them. To this, says he, I reply,</P>
<LG>
<L>We just as wisely might of Heav'n complain,</L>
<L>That righteous Abel was destroy'd by Cain;</L>
<L>As that the virtuous son is ill at ease,</L>
<L>When his lewd father gave the dire disease.</L>
</LG>
<P>But you will still say, why doth not God either prevent, or immediately repair these evils? You may as well ask why he doth not work continual miracles, and every moment reverse the established laws of Nature:
<Q><L>Shall burning Aetna, if a sage requires, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<PB N="125" REF="174"/>
This is the force of the poet's reasoning; and these the men to whom he addresseth it; namely, the Libertine Cavillers against Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="175"/>
VER. 131. <HI>But still this world</HI> &amp;c.] II. But now, so un∣happy is the condition of our corrupt nature, that these are not the only complainers. RELIGIOUS Men are but too apt, if not to speak out, yet sometimes secretly to murmur against Provi∣dence, and say, its ways are not equal; especially the more in∣ordinately devoted to a sect or party are scandalized that the Just (for such they esteem themselves) who are to judge the world, have no better portion in their own inheritance: The poet there∣fore now leave<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those more prosligate complainers, and turns (from ℣ 130 to 149) to the religious, in these words:
<Q><L>But still this world (so fitted for the knave) &amp;c.</L></Q>
As the more Impious wanted external goods to be the reward of Virtue for the Moral man; so These want them for the Pious, in order to have a kingdom of the Just: To this the poet holds it sufficient to answer; Pray first agree among yourselves, who those Just are.</P>
<P>As this is the case, he bids them rest satisfied; remember his fundamental principle, that <HI>whatever is, is right;</HI> and content themselves (as their religion teaches them to profess a more than ordinary submission to the will of Providence) with that com∣mon answer which he, with so much reason and piety, gives to every kind of Complainer.</P>
<P>However, though there be yet no <HI>Kingdom of the Just,</HI> there is still no kingdom of the Unjust: both the Virtuous and the Vi∣cious (whatsoever becomes of those whom every sect calls the Faithful) have their shares in external goods; and what is more, the Virtuous have infinitely the most enjoyment of them.</P>

I have been the more solicitous to explain this last argument, and to shew <HI>against whom</HI> it is directed, because much depends upon it for the illustration of the sense, and the just defence of the poet. For if we suppose him still addressing himself to those IMPIOUS complainers, confuted in the forty preceding lines, we should make him guilty of a paralogism in the argument about the Just; and in the illustration of it by the case of Calvin. For then the Libertines ask, Why the Just, that is, the moral man, is not rewarded? The answer is, That none but God can tell, who the Just, that is, the truly faithful man, is. Where the Term is changed, in order to support the argument; for about the <HI>truly moral man</HI> there is no dispute; about the <HI>truly faith∣ful</HI> or the orthodox, a great deal. But take the poet right, as arguing here against RELIGIOUS complainers, and the reason∣ing is strict and logical. They ask, Why the truly faithful are not rewarded? he answereth, They may be, for ought you know; for none but God can tell who they are.</P>

VER. 149. <HI>"But sometimes Virtue starves, while Vice is fed."]</HI> III. The poet, having dispatched these two species of murmurers, comes now to the third and still more pardonable sort, the <HI>dis∣contented</HI> GOOD MEN, who lament only that Virtue starves, while Vice riots. To these he replies (from ℣ 148 to 157) that admit this to be the case, yet they have no reason to complain, either of the good man's lot in particular, or of the dispensation of Providence in general. Not of the former, because Hap∣piness, the reward of Virtue, consisteth not in Externals; nor of the latter, because ill men may gain wealth by commenda∣ble industry, good men want necessaries through indolence or bad conduct.</P>
<P>VER. 157. <HI>But grant him Riches,</HI> &amp;c.] But as modest as this
<PB N="129" REF="178"/>
complaint seemeth at first view, the poet next shews (from ℣ 156 to 167) that it is founded on a principle of the <HI>highest extrava∣gance,</HI> which will never let the discontented good man rest, 'till he becomes as vain and foolish in his imaginations as the very worst sort of complainers. For that when once he begins to think he wants what is his due, he will never know wheré to stop, while God hath any thing to give.</P>
<P>VER. 167. <HI>What nothing earthly gives,</HI> &amp;c.] But this is not all; he proveth next (from ℣ 166 to 185) that these demands are not only unreasonable, but in the highest degree absurd like∣wise. For that those very goods, if granted, would be the de∣struction of that Virtue for which they are demanded as a Re∣ward. He concludes therefore on the whole, that,</P>
<LG>
<L>What nothing earthly gives, or can destroy,</L>
<L>The soul's calm-sun-shine, and the heart-felt joy,</L>
<L>Is Virtue's prize.—</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="130" REF="179"/>
And that to aim at other, which not only is of no use to us here, but, what is more, will be of none hereafter, is a passion like that of an Insant or a Savage, where the one is impatient for what he will soon despise, and the other makes a pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ision for what he can never want.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="180" MS="y"/>
VER. 185. <HI>To whom can Riches give Repute, or Trust,]</HI> The poet now enters more at large upon the matter: And still conti∣nuing his discourse to this third sort of complainers (whom he indulgeth, as much more pardonable than the first or second, in rectifying all their doubts and mistakes) he proves, both from reason and example, how unable any of those things are which the world most admires, to make a good man happy. For as to the Philosophic mistakes concerning Happiness, there being little danger of their making a general impression, he had, after a short confutation, dismissed them at once. But External goods are those Syrens which so bewitch the world with dreams of Happiness, that it is of all things the most difficult to awaken it out of its delusions; though, as he proves in an exact review of the most pretending, they dishonour bad men, and add no lustre to the good. That it is only this third and least criminal fort of complainers, against which the remaining part of the dis∣course is levelled, appeareth from the poet's so frequently ad∣dressing himself, while he inforceth his arguments in behalf of Providence, from henceforward to his friend.</P>
<P N="1">I. He beginneth therefore (from ℣ 184 to 205) with consi∣dering RICHES. 1. He examines, first, what there is of real value or enjoyment in them; and sheweth, they can give the good man only that very Contentment and that very Esteem and Love which he had before: And scornfully cries out to those of a different opinion,</P>
<LG>
<L>Oh fool! to think God hates the worthy mind,</L>
<L>The lover and the love of human kind,</L>
<L>Whose life is healthful, and whose conscience clear;</L>
<L>Because he wants a thousand pounds a year!</L>
</LG>
<P N="2"><PB N="132" REF="181"/>
2. Next he examines the imaginary value of Riches, as the fountain of Honour. For his adversaries' objection standeth thus:—As Honour is the genuine claim of Virtue, and Shame the just retribution of Vice; and as Honour, in their opinion, fol∣lows Riches, and Shame Poverty; therefore the good man should be <HI>rich.</HI> He tells them in this they are much mistaken:
<Q><L>Honour and shame from no Condition rise;</L>
<L>Act well your part, there all the honour lies.</L></Q>
What power then has Fortune over the Man? None at all; for as her favours can confer neither worth nor wisdom; so nei∣ther can her displeasure cure him of any of his follies. On his Garb indeed she hath some little influence; but his Heart still remains the same:
<Q><L>Fortu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in Men has some small diff'rence made,</L>
<L>One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade.</L></Q>
But this <HI>difference</HI> extends no farther than to the habit; the pride of heart is the same both in the <HI>flaunter</HI> and the <HI>flutterer,</HI> as it is the poet's intention to insinuate by the use of those terms.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="182" MS="y"/>
VER. 205. <HI>Stuck o'er with titles,</HI> &amp;c.] II. Then as to NOBILITY, by creation or birth; this too the poet shews (from ℣ 204 to 217) is in itself as devoid of all real worth as the rest; because, in the first case, the Title is generally gain'd by no merit at all; in the second, by the merit of the first Founder of the family; which will generally, when reflected on, be rather the subject of Mortifica∣tion than Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="183"/>
VER. 217. <HI>Look next on Greatness;</HI> &amp;c.] III. The poet in the next place (from ℣ 216 to 237) unmasks the false pretences of GREATNESS; whereby it is seen that the <HI>Hero</HI> and <HI>Politician</HI> (the two characters that would monopolize that quality) after all their bustle effect only this, if they want Virtue, that the one
<PB N="135" REF="184" MS="y"/>
proves himself a Fool, and the other a Knave: And Virtue they but too generally want; the art of Heroism being under∣stood to consist in Ravage and Desolation, and the art of Poli∣tics in Circumvention.</P>
<P>It is not success, therefore, that constitutes true Greatness; but the end aimed at, and the means which are employed: And if these be right, Glory will be the reward, whatever be the issue:</P>
<LG>
<L>Who noble ends by noble means obtains,</L>
<L>Or failing, smiles in exile or in chains,</L>
<L>Like good Aurelius let him reign, or bleed</L>

<P>VER. 237. <HI>What's Fame?]</HI> IV. With regard to FAME,
<PB N="136" REF="185" MS="y"/>
that still more fantastic blessing, he sheweth (from ℣ 236 to 259) that all of it, besides what we hear ourselves, is merely nothing; and that even of this small portion, no more of it giveth the possessor a real satisfaction, than what is the fruit of Virtue. Thus he shews, that Honour, Nobility, Greatness, Glory, so far as they have any thing real and substantial, that is, so far as they contribute to the Happiness of the possessor, are the sole issue of Virtue; and that neither Riches, Courts, Armies, nor the Populace, are capable of conferring them.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="186"/>
VER. 259. <HI>In Parts superior what advantage lies?]</HI> V. But lastly, the poet proves (from ℣ 258 to 269) that as <HI>no external</HI> goods can make man happy, so neither is it in the power of <HI>all internal.</HI> For that even SUPERIOR PARTS bring no more real Happiness to the possessor than the rest; nay, that they put him into a worse condition; for that the quickness of appre∣hension and depth of penetration do but sharpen the miseries of life.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="187"/>
VER. 269. <HI>Bring then these blessings to a strict account;</HI> &amp;c.] Having thus proved how empty and unsatisfactory all these greatest external goods are, from an examination of their na∣ture; he proceeds to strengthen his argument (from ℣ 268 to 309) by these three farther considerations:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the acquirement of these goods is made with the loss of one another, or of greater; either as inconsistent with them, or as spent in attaining them.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the possessors of each of these goods are generally such, as are so far from raising envy in a good man, that he would refuse to take their persons, though accompanied with their pos∣sessions: And this the poet illustrates by examples.</P>
<P N="3">3. That even the possession of them all together, where they have excluded Virtue, only terminates in more enormous misery.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="190"/>
VER. 309. <HI>Know then this truth</HI> &amp;c.] Having thus at length shewn that Happiness consists neither in <HI>any</HI> external goods, nor in <HI>all</HI> kinds of internal (that is, such of them as are not of our own acquirement) nor yet in the visionary pursuits of the Phi∣losophers, he concludes (from ℣ 308 to 311) that it is to be found in VIRTUE ALONE.</P>
<P>VER. 311. <HI>The only point where human bliss stands still,</HI> &amp;c.] Hitherto the poet had proved, NEGATIVELY, that Happiness consists in Virtue, by shewing it consisted not in any other thing. He now (from ℣ 310 to 327) proves the same POSI∣TIVELY, by an enumeration of its Qualities, all naturally adapt∣ed
<PB N="142" REF="191"/>
to give and to increase human Happiness; as its Constancy, Capacity, Vigour, Efficacy, Activity, Moderation, and Self∣sufficiency.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="192"/>
VER. 327. <HI>See the sole bliss Heav'n could on all bestow!]</HI> Having thus proved that Happiness is indeed placed in <HI>Virtue;</HI> he proves next (from ℣ 326 to 329) that it is <HI>rightly</HI> placed there; for that then, and then only, ALL may partake of it, and ALL be capable of relishing it.</P>
<P>VER. 329. <HI>Yet poor with fortune,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet then ob∣serveth, with some indignation (from ℣ 328 to 341) that as easy and as evident as this truth was, yet Riches and false Philosophy had so blinded the discernment even of improved minds, that the possessors of the first, placed Happiness in Externals, un∣suitable to Man's Nature; and the followers of the latter, in refined Visions, unsuitable to his Situation: while the simple∣minded man, with NATURE only for his guide, found plainly in what it should be placed.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="193"/>
VER. 341. <HI>For him alone, Hope leads from goal to goal,]</HI> But this is not all; the author shews farther (from ℣ 340 to 353) that when the simple-minded man, on his first setting out in the pursuit of Truth in order to Happiness, hath had the wisdom
<Q><L>To look thro' Nature up to Nature's God,</L></Q>
(instead of adhering to any sect or party, where there was so great odds of his chusing wrong) that then the benefit of gain∣ing
<PB N="145" REF="194"/>
the knowledge of God's will <HI>written in the mind,</HI> is not con∣fined there; for standing on this sure foundation, he is now no longer in danger of chusing wrong, amidst such diversities of Religions; but by pursuing this grand Scheme of universal Be∣nevolence, in practice as well as theory, he arrives at length to the knowledge of the <HI>revealed</HI> will of God, which is the con∣summation of the system of benevolence:</P>
<LG>
<L>For him alone, Hope leads from goal to goal,</L>
<L>And opens still, and opens on his soul,</L>
<L>'Till lengthen'd on to Faith, and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>It pours the bliss that fills up all the mind.</L>
</LG>
<P>VER. 353. <HI>Self-love thus push'd to social,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet, in the last place, marks out (from ℣ 352 to 373) the Progress of his good man's Benevolence, pushed through natural religion to revealed, 'till it arrives to that height which the sacred writers describe as the very summit of Christian perfection: And shews how the progress of <HI>human</HI> differs from the progress of <HI>divine</HI> benevolence. That the divine descends from <HI>whole</HI> to <HI>parts;</HI> but that the human must rise from <HI>individual</HI> to <HI>universal.</HI> His argument for this extended benevolence is, that as God has made a Whole, whose parts have a perfect relation to, and an entire dependency on each other; Man, by extending his bene∣volence
<PB N="146" REF="195"/>
throughout that Whole, acts in conformity to the will of his Creator; and therefore this Enlargement of his affection becomes a duty. But the poet hath not only shewn his piety in this observation, but the utmost art and address likewise in the disposition of it. The <HI>Essay on Man</HI> opens with exposing the murmurings and impious conclusions of foolish men against the present constitution of things: As it proceeds, it occasionally detects all those principles and opinions that led them to conclude thus perversely. Having now done all that was necessary in Speculation, the author turns to Practice; and ends his Essay with the recommendation of an acknowledged virtue, Charity; which, if exercised in the <HI>Extent</HI> that conformity to the will of God requireth, would effectually prevent all com∣plaints against the present order of things: such complaints be∣ing made with a total disregard to every thing but their <HI>own private system,</HI> and seeking remedy in the disorder, and at the expence, of all the rest. This observation,
<Q><L>Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake,</L></Q>
is important: Rochefoucault, Esprit, and their wordy disciple Mandeville, had observed that Self-love was the Origin of all those virtues Mankind most admire; and therefore foolishly supposed it was the End likewise: And so taught that the highest pretences to disinterestedness were only the more artful disguises of Self-love. But our author, who says somewhere or other,
<Q><L>Of human Nature, Wit its worst may write,</L>
<L>We all revere it in our own despite, <BIBL>MS.</BIBL></L></Q>
faw, as well as they and every body else, that the Passions began in Self-love; yet he understood human Nature better than to imagine they terminated there. He knew that Reason and Religion could convert Selfishness into its very opposite; and therefore teacheth that
<Q><L>Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake:</L></Q>
And thus hath vindicated the dignity of human Nature, and the philosophic truth of the Christian doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="199"/>
VER. 394. <HI>Shew'd erring Pride, Whatever Is, is Right;]</HI> The poet's address to his friend, which concludeth this epistle so nobly, and endeth with a recapitulation of the general argument, affords me the following observation, with which I shall con∣clude these remarks. There is one great beauty that shines through the whole <HI>Essay:</HI> The Poet, whether he speaks of Man as an Individual, a Member of Society, or the Subject of Hap∣piness, never misseth an opportunity, while he is explaining his state under any of these capacities, to illustrate it in the most art∣ful manner by the inforcement of his grand Principle, <HI>That every thing tendeth to the good of the Whole,</HI> from whence his system receives the reciprocal advantage of having that grand Theorem realized by facts, and his facts justified on a principle of Right or Nature.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to analyse, and explain the exact reasoning of these four epistles. Enough I presume to convince every one, that it hath a precision, force, and closeness of con∣nection, rarely to be met with, even in the most formal treatises of Philosophy. Yet in doing this, it is but too evident I have destroyed that grace and energy which animates the original. And now let the reader believe, if he be so disposed, what a certain Critic upon this work insinuates to be his own opinion, as well as that of his friends: <Q>“Some persons, says he, have conjectured that Mr. Pope did not compose this Essay at once, and in a regular order; but that after he had wrote several fragments of poetry, all finished in their kind, (one, for example, on the parallel between Reason and Instinct, an∣other upon Man's groundless Pride, another on the Prerogatives of human Nature, another on Religion and Superstition, another on the Original of Society, and several fragments
<PB N="151" REF="200" MS="y"/>
besides on Self-love and the Passions) he tacked these together as he could, and divided them into four epistles; as, it is said, was the fortune of Homer's Rhapsodies.”</Q> I suppose this will be as soon believed of one as the other. But his French Poetical Translator is not behind his Critic, in this judgment on their Author's work. <Q>“The only reason (says this translator) for which this poem can be properly termed an <HI>Essay,</HI> is, that the author has not formed his plan with all the regularity of method which it might have admitted—and again—I was, by the unanimous opinion of all those whom I have consulted on this occasion, and amongst these, of several <HI>Englishmen</HI> completely skilled in both languages, <HI>obliged to follow a different method. The French are not satisfied with sentiments, however beautiful, unless they be methodically dis∣posed: Method being the Characteristic that distinguishes our performances from those of our Neighbours,”</HI></Q> &amp;c. It is enough just to have quoted these wonderful Men of method, and to leave them to the laughter of the Public.</P>

The times, in which others succeeded in this attempt, were such as saw the spirit of Liberty suppressed and stifled by a general luxury and venality: But Cromwell subdued his country, when this spirit was at its height, by a successful struggle against court-oppression; and while it was conducted and supported by a

<P><HI>Universal Prayer.]</HI> Concerning this poem, it may be proper to observe, that some passages, in the preceding <HI>Essay,</HI> having been unjustly suspected of a tendency towards Fate and <HI>Na∣turalism,</HI> the author composed this Prayer as the sum of all, to shew that his system was founded in <HI>free-will,</HI> and terminated in piety: That the first cause was as well the Lord and Governor of the Universe as the Creator of it; and that, by submission to his will (the great principle inforced throughout the <HI>Essay)</HI> was not meant the suffering ourselves to be carried along with a blind determination; but a religious acquiescence, and confidence full
<PB N="156" REF="203"/>
of <HI>Hope</HI> and Immortality. To give all this the greater weight and reality, the poet chose for his model the LORD'S PRAYER, which, of all others, best deserves the title prefixed to this Para∣phrase.</P>

As the <HI>imparting grace</HI> on the christian system is a stronger exertion of the divine power, than the natural illumination of the heart, one would ex∣pect that the request should have been expressed reversely; more aid being required to re∣store men to the <HI>right</HI> than to keep them in it.

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Of the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of <HI>MEN.</HI></P>
<P>THAT it is not sufficient for this knowledge to consider Man in the <HI>Abstract: Books</HI> will not serve the pur∣pose, nor yet our own <HI>Experience</HI> singly, <HI>℣ 1.</HI> General maxims, unless they be formed upon <HI>both,</HI> will be but notional, <HI>℣ 10.</HI> Some Peculiarity in every man, cha∣racteristic to himself, yet varying from himself, <HI>℣ 15.</HI> Difficulties arising from our own Passions, Fancies, Fa∣culties, <HI>&amp;c. ℣ 31.</HI> The shortness of Life, to observe in, and the uncertainty of the <HI>Principles of action</HI> in men, to observe by, <HI>℣ 37, &amp;c.</HI> Our <HI>own</HI> Principle of action often hid from ourselves, <HI>℣ 41.</HI> Some few Characters plain, but in general confounded, dissembled, or incon∣sistent, <HI>℣ 51.</HI> The same man utterly different in differ∣ent places and seasons, <HI>℣ 71.</HI> Unimaginable weak∣nesses in the greatest, <HI>℣ 70, &amp;c.</HI> Nothing constant and certain but <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature, ℣ 95.</HI> No judging of

the <HI>Motives</HI> from the actions; the same actions pro∣ceeding from contrary Motives, and the same Motives influencing contrary actions, <HI>℣ 100.

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Epistle of the Knowledge and Characters of Men.]</HI> Whoever compares this with the former Editions of this poem, will observe that the order and disposition of the several parts are entirely changed and transposed, tho' with hardly the Alteration of a single Word. When the Editor, at the Author's desire, first examined this Epistle, he was surprized to find it contain a num∣ber of fine observations, without order, connexion, or depen∣dence: but much more so, when, on an attentive review, he saw, that, if put into a different form, on an idea he then conceived, it would have all the clearness of method, and force of connected reasoning. Indeed the observations then appeared to him so jumbled and confounded in one another, as if the se∣veral parts of a regular poem had been rolled up in tickets, drawn at random, and then set down as they arose. The au∣thor appeared as much struck with the observation as the editor, and agreed to put it in the present form, which has given the poem all the justness of a true composition. The introduction of the epistle on Riches was in the same condition, and under∣went the same reform.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="211"/>
EPISTLE I.] This Epistle is divided into three principal parts or members: The first (from ℣ 1 to 99) treats of the difficul∣ties in coming at the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and true <HI>Characters of Men.</HI>—The second (from ℣ 98 to 173) of the <HI>wrong means</HI> which
<PB N="165" REF="212"/>
both <HI>Philosophers</HI> and <HI>Men of the World</HI> have employed in sur∣mounting those difficulties. And the third (from ℣ 174 to the end) treats of the <HI>right means,</HI> with directions for the applica∣tion of them.</P>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>Yes, you despise the man</HI> &amp;c.] The Epistle is intro∣duced (from ℣ 1 to 15) in observing, that the <HI>Knowledge of Men</HI> is neither to be gained by Books nor Experience alone, but by the joint use of both; for that the <HI>Maxims</HI> of the <HI>Philosopher</HI> and the <HI>Conclusions</HI> of the <HI>Man of the World</HI> can, separately, but supply a vague and superficial knowledge: And often not so much; as those <HI>Maxims</HI> are sounded in the abstract <HI>notions</HI> of the writer; and these <HI>conclusions</HI> are drawn from the uncertain
<PB N="166" REF="213"/>
<HI>conjectures</HI> of the observer: But when the writer joins his <HI>specu∣lation</HI> to the <HI>experience</HI> of the observer, his <HI>notions</HI> are rectified into <HI>principles:</HI> and when the observer regulates his <HI>experience</HI> on the <HI>general principles</HI> of the writer, his <HI>conjectures</HI> advance into <HI>science.</HI> Such is the reasoning of this introduction; which, besides its propriety to the general subject of the Epistle, has a peculiar relation to each of its parts or members: For the <HI>causes of the difficulty</HI> in coming at the knowledge and characters of men, explained in the first, will shew the importance of what is here delivered, of the <HI>joint</HI> assistance of speculation and practice to surmount it; and the <HI>wrong means,</HI> which both <HI>philoso∣phers</HI> and <HI>men of the world</HI> have employed in overcoming those difficulties discoursed of in the second, have their source here deduced, which is seen to be a <HI>separate</HI> adherence of each to his own method of studying men, and a mutual contempt of the others. Lastly, the <HI>right means</HI> delivered in the third, will be of little use in the application, without the direction here delivered: For tho' <HI>observation</HI> discovered a <HI>ruling passion,</HI> yet, without a <HI>philosophic</HI> knowledge of the human mind, we may easily mistake a <HI>secondary</HI> and <HI>subsidiary</HI> passion for the <HI>principal,</HI> and so be never the nearer in the Knowledge of Men. But the elegant and easy <HI>Form</HI> of the <HI>introduction</HI> equals the Pro∣priety of its <HI>matter;</HI> for the epistle being addressed to a noble person, distinguished for his knowledge of the World, it opens, as it were, in the midst of a familiar converse, which lets us at once into his character; where the poet, by affecting <HI>only</HI> to ridicule the useless Knowledge of Men confined to Books, and under the appearance of extolling only that acquired by the World, artfully insinuates how equally defective this may be, when conducted on the same narrow principle: Which is too often the case, as <HI>men of the world</HI> are more than ordinarily pre∣judiced in favour of their own observations for the sake of the
<PB N="167" REF="214"/>
observer, and, for the same reason, less indulgent to the disco∣veries of others.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>VER. 15. <HI>There's some Peculiar &amp;c.]</HI> The poet enters on the First division of his subject, <HI>the difficulties of coming at the Know∣ledge and true Characters of Men.</HI> The first cause of this dif∣ficulty which he prosecutes (from ℣ 14 to 19) is the great <HI>di∣versity of Characters,</HI> of which, to abate our wonder, and not discourage our inquiry, he only desires we would <HI>grant</HI> him
<Q><L>—but as many sorts of Mind as Moss.</L></Q>
Hereby artfully insinuating, that if Nature has varied the most worthless vegetable into above three hundred species, we need not wonder at the like diversity in the human mind: And if a variety in that vegetable has been thought of importance enough to employ the leisure of a serious enquirer, much more will the same quality in this master-piece of Nature deserve our study and attention.</P>
<P>VER. 19. <HI>That each from other differs, &amp;c.]</HI> A second cause of this difficulty (from ℣ 18 to 21) is <HI>Man's inconstancy,</HI> where∣by not only one man differs from another, but each man from himself.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="215"/>
VER. 21. <HI>Add Nature's,</HI> &amp;c.] A third cause (from ℣ 20 to 23) is that <HI>obscurity</HI> thrown over the Characters of men, through the strife and contest between <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>custom,</HI> between <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>appetite,</HI> between <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>opinion.</HI> And as most men, either thro' <HI>education, temperature,</HI> or <HI>profession,</HI> have their Cha∣racters warp'd by <HI>custom, appetite,</HI> and <HI>opinion,</HI> the obscurity arising from thence is almost universal.</P>
<P>VER. 23. <HI>Our depths who fathoms,</HI> &amp;c.] A fourth cause (from ℣ 20 to 25) is deep <HI>dissimulation,</HI> and restless <HI>caprice,</HI> whereby the shallows of the mind are as difficult to be <HI>found,</HI> as the depths of it to be <HI>fathom'd.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 25. <HI>On human actions</HI> &amp;c.] A fifth cause (from ℣ 24 to 31) is the sudden change of his <HI>Principle of action,</HI> either on the point of its being laid open and detected, or thro' mere in∣constancy.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="216"/>
VER. 31. <HI>Yet more; the difference</HI> &amp;c.] Hitherto the poet hath spoken of the causes of difficulty arising from the <HI>obscurity of the Object;</HI> he now comes to those which proceed from <HI>de∣fects in the Observer.</HI> The First of which, and a sixth cause of difficulty, he shews (from 30 to 37) is the perverse <HI>manners, affections,</HI> and <HI>imagination</HI> of the observer, whereby the Cha∣racters of others are rarely seen either in their true <HI>light, com∣plexion,</HI> or <HI>proportion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>VER. 37.</HI> Nor will Life's stream for Observation &amp;c.] <HI>The</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="217"/>
Second of these, and seventh cause of difficulty (from ℣ 36 to 41) is the <HI>shortness of human life,</HI> which will not suffer the observer to select and weigh out his knowledge, but just to snatch it as it rolls rapidly by him down the current of Time.</P>
<P>VER. 41. <HI>Oft, in the Passions'</HI> &amp;c.] We come now to the eighth and last cause, which very properly concludes the ac∣count, as, in a sort, it sums up all the difficulties in one (from ℣ 40 to 51) namely, that very often the <HI>man himself is ignorant of his own motive of action;</HI> the cause of which ignorance our author has admirably explain'd: When the mind (says he) is now quite tired out by the long conflict of opposite motives, it withdraws its attention, and suffers the <HI>will</HI> to be seized upon by the first that afterwards obtrudes itself, without taking notice what that motive is. This is finely illustrated by what he sup∣poses the general cause of dreams; where the fancy, just let loose, possesses itself of the <HI>last image</HI> which it meets with on the confines between sleep and waking, and on that erects all its visionary operation; yet this image is, with great difficulty, re∣collected; and never, but when some accident happens to inter∣rupt our first slumbers: Then (which proves the truth of the hypothesis) we are sometimes able to trace the workings of the Fancy backwards, from image to image, in a chain, till we come to that from whence they all arose.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="218" MS="y"/>
VER. 51. <HI>True, some are open,</HI> &amp;c.] But now in answer to all this, an <HI>objector,</HI> as the author shews (from ℣ 50 to 61) may say, <Q>“That these difficulties seem to be aggravated: For many Characters are so plainly marked, that no man can mistake them: And not so only in the more <HI>open</HI> and <HI>frank,</HI> but in the very <HI>closest</HI> and most <HI>recluse</HI> likewise.”</Q> Of each of which the objector gives an instance, whereby it appears, that the for∣bidding closeness and concealed hypocrisy in the one, are as con∣spicuous to all mankind, as the gracious openness and frank
<PB N="172" REF="219" MS="y"/>
plain-dealing of the other.—The Reader sees this objection is more particularly level'd at the doctrine of ℣ 23.
<Q><L>Our <HI>depths</HI> who fathoms, and our <HI>shallows</HI> finds?</L></Q>
for it here endeavours to prove, that both are equally explorable.</P>
<P>VER. 63. <HI>But these plain Characters</HI> &amp;c.] To this objection, therefore, our author replies (from ℣ 60 to 67) that indeed the fact may be true in the instances given, but that such <HI>plain characters</HI> are extremely rare: And for the truth of this, he not only appeals to experience, but explains the causes of it: 1. The First of which is, the <HI>vivacity of the Imagination;</HI> for that when the bias of the Passions is enough determined to mark out the Character, yet then, as the vigour of the Fancy generally rises in proportion to the strength of the Appetites, the one no sooner directs the bias, than the other reverses it,
<Q><L>Tho' <HI>strong</HI> the bent, yet <HI>quick</HI> the turns of mind.</L></Q>
2. A Second cause is the <HI>contraricty of Appetites,</HI> which drawing several ways, as <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Luxury, Ambition</HI> and <HI>Indolence,</HI> &amp;c. they must needs make the same Character inconsistent to itself, and consequently inexplicable to the observer,
<Q><L>Or puzzling <HI>Contraries</HI> confound the whole.</L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 66. <HI>Or Affectations</HI> &amp;c.] 3. A Third cause is <HI>Affectation,</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="220"/>
that aspires to qualities, which neither <HI>nature</HI> nor <HI>education</HI> has given us, and which, consequently, neither <HI>art</HI> nor <HI>use</HI> will ever render graceful or becoming. On this account it is, he well ob∣serves, that <HI>Affectation reverses the soul;</HI> other <HI>natural passions</HI> may indeed turn it from that bias which the <HI>ruling one</HI> has given it; but the <HI>affected passions</HI> distort all its faculties, and cramp all its operations; so that it acts with the same constraint that a tumbler walks upon his hands.</P>
<P>VER. 69. <HI>Unthought-of frailties</HI> &amp;c.] 4. A Fourth cause lies in the <HI>Inequalities in the human mind,</HI> which expose the <HI>wise</HI> to unexpected frailties, and conduct the <HI>weak</HI> to as unlooked for wisdom.</P>
<P>VER. 71. <HI>See the same man,</HI> &amp;c.] Of all these Four <HI>causes</HI> he here gives examples: 1. Of the <HI>vivacity of the Imagination</HI> (from ℣ 71 to 77)—2. Of the <HI>contrariety of Appetites</HI> (from ℣ 76 to 81)—3. Of <HI>Affectation</HI> (from ℣ 80 to 87)—and 4. Of the <HI>Inequalities of the human mind</HI> (from ℣ 86 to 95.)</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="223" MS="y"/>
VER. 95. <HI>Know, God and Nature</HI> &amp;c.] Having thus proved what he had proposed, the <HI>premisses</HI> naturally lead him into a moral reflexion, with which he concludes his <HI>first part,</HI> namely, that constancy is to be expected in no human Character what∣soever, but to be found only in God and his Laws: That as to Man, he is not only perpetually shifting and varying, even while <HI>within the verge</HI> of his own nature; but is frequently flying out into each extreme both <HI>above</HI> and <HI>below</HI> it: Now associating in good earnest with Brutes; and now again affecting the ima∣ginary conversation of Angels [See <HI>Essay on Man,</HI> Ep. ii. ℣ 8.]

<L>Now in the <HI>Moon</HI> perhaps, now <HI>under ground.</HI></L></Q></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VER. 99. <HI>In vain the Sage,</HI> &amp;c.] The author having shewn the difficulties in coming to the Knowledge and true Characters of men, enters now upon the <HI>second division</HI> of his Poem, which is <HI>of the wrong means that both Philosophers and Men of the world</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="224"/>
<HI>have employed in surmounting those difficulties.</HI> He had, in the Introduction, spoken of the absurd conduct of both, in despising the assistance of each other: He now justifies his censure by an examination of their peculiar doctrines; and, to take them in their own way, considers them, as they would be considered, <HI>separately.</HI> And <HI>first,</HI> of the <HI>Philosopher,</HI> whose principal mis∣take is in supposing <HI>that Actions best dccipher</HI> the <HI>Motive of the actor.</HI> This he confutes (from ℣ 98 to 109) by shewing that <HI>different Actions</HI> proceed often from the <HI>same motive;</HI> whether of <HI>accident,</HI> as disappointed views; or of <HI>temperature,</HI> as an adust complexion; which he thus illustrates,
<Q><L>Behold! If Fortune or a Mistress frowns, &amp;c.</L></Q>
In judging therefore of <HI>Motives</HI> by <HI>Actions,</HI> the Philosopher must needs be frequently misled; because the passion or appetite, which, when impelling to <HI>Action,</HI> we call the <HI>Motive,</HI> may be equally gratified in the pursuit of quite different measures.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="225" MS="y"/>
VER. 109. <HI>Not always Actions shew the man:</HI> &amp;c.] The Phi∣losopher's <HI>second</HI> mistake is, that <HI>Actions decipher the Character of the actor.</HI> This too, the author consutes (from ℣ 108 to 135) and, as in correcting the foregoing mistake, he proved, <HI>that different Actions often proceed from the same Motive;</HI> so here he proves, <HI>that the same Action often proceeds from different Motives;</HI> thus a <HI>kind Action,</HI> he observes, as commonly arises from the accidents of prosperity or fine weather, as from a natural disposition to huma∣nity; a <HI>modest Action,</HI> as well from pride, as humility; a <HI>brave Action,</HI> as easily from habit or fashion, as magnanimity; and a <HI>prudent Action</HI> as often from vanity, as wisdom. Now the <HI>Cha∣racter</HI> being really determined by the <HI>Motives,</HI> and various, may contrary <HI>Motives</HI> producing the same <HI>Action,</HI> the <HI>Action</HI> can never decipher the <HI>Character of the actor.</HI> But further (con∣tinues the poet) if we attend to what has been said, we shall discover another circumstance in the case, that will not only make it extremely difficult, but absolutely impracticable to decipher the Character by the Action; and that is, the <HI>discor∣dancy of Action</HI> in the same Character; a necessary consequence of the two principles proved above, that <HI>different Actions proceed from the same Motive,</HI> and that <HI>the same Action proceeds from different Motives.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="226"/>
VER. 119. <HI>But grant that Actions</HI> &amp;c.] If you will judge of man by his <HI>Actions,</HI> you are not to select such only as you like, or can manage, you must fairly take all you find: But, when you have got these together, they will prove so very discordant that no consistent Character can possibly be made out of them. What is then to be done? Will you <HI>suppress</HI> all those you can∣not reconcile to the few capital Actions which you chuse for the foundation of your Character? But this the laws of truth will not permit. Will you then miscall them? and say they were not the natural workings of the man, but the disguises of the politician? But what will you get by that, but reversing the best known Character, and making the owner of it the direct opposite of himself? And this (says our author) the reasoning and philosophic historian has been always ready to do with the <HI>Actions</HI> of great men; of which he gives two famous instances in the life of Caesar. The conclusion, from the whole, is, that <HI>Actions do not shew the Man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="228"/>
VER. 135. <HI>'Tis from high Life,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet having done with the <HI>Philosopher,</HI> now turns to the <HI>Man of the world;</HI> whose <HI>first</HI> mistake is in supposing men's true <HI>Characters may be known by their station.</HI> This, tho' a mere mob-opinion, is the opi∣nion in fashion, and cherished by the Mob of all ranks; there∣fore, tho' beneath the poet's reasoning, he thought it deserving of his ridicule; and the strongest was what he gives (from ℣ 134 to 141) a naked exposition of the fact; to which he has sub∣joined (from ℣ 140 to 149) an ironical apology, that, as Vir∣tue is cultivated with infinitely more labour in Courts than in
<PB N="182" REF="229" MS="y"/>
Cottages, it is but just to set an infinitely higher value on it; which, says he with much pleasantry, is most agreeable to all the fashionable ways of estimation.

<P>VER. 149. <HI>'Tis Education forms,</HI> &amp;c.] This <HI>second</HI> mistake of the <HI>Man of the world</HI> is more serious; it is, that <HI>Characters are best judged of by the general Manners.</HI> This the poet con∣futes in a lively enumeration of examples (from ℣ 148 to 158) which shew, that how similar or different soever the <HI>Manners</HI> be by <HI>Nature,</HI> yet they are all new model'd by <HI>Education</HI> and <HI>Profession;</HI> where each man invariably receives that exotic form which the mould he falls into, is fitted to imprint.

<P><PB N="183" REF="230"/>
VER. 158. <HI>Ask mens Opinion's:</HI> &amp;c.] The <HI>third</HI> mistake is in judging of mens characters by their <HI>Opinions and turn of think∣ing.</HI> But these, the poet shews by two examples (from ℣ 157 to 166.) are generally swayed by <HI>Interest,</HI> both in the <HI>affairs of Life</HI> and <HI>Speculation.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 166. <HI>Judge we by Nature?</HI> &amp;c.] The poet having
<PB N="184" REF="231" MS="y"/>
gone through-the <HI>mistakes</HI> both of the <HI>Philosopher</HI> and <HI>Man of the world,</HI> separately, turns now to <HI>both;</HI> and (from ℣ 165 to 174) jointly addresses them in a <HI>recapitulation</HI> of his reasoning against <HI>both:</HI> He shews, that if we pretend to develope the <HI>Character</HI> by the <HI>natural disposition in general,</HI> we shall find it extremely difficult, because this is often <HI>effaced</HI> by <HI>Habit, overswayed</HI> by <HI>Interest,</HI> and <HI>suspended</HI> by <HI>Policy.</HI>—If by <HI>Actions,</HI> their contra∣riety will leave us in utter doubt and uncertainty.—If by <HI>Pas∣sions,</HI> we shall be perpetually misled by the mask of <HI>Dissimula∣tion.</HI>—If by <HI>Opinions,</HI> all these concur together to perplex the enquiry. Shew us, then, says he, in the whole range of your <HI>Philosophy</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> the thing we can be <HI>certain</HI> of: For (to sum up all in a word)
<Q><L><HI>Manners</HI> with Fortunes, <HI>Humours</HI> turn with Climes,</L>
<L><HI>Tenets</HI> with Books, and <HI>Principles</HI> with Times.</L></Q>
We must seek therefore some other road to the point we aim at.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="232" MS="y"/>
VER. 174. <HI>Search then the Ruling Passion:</HI> &amp;c.] And now we enter on the <HI>third</HI> and last part; which treats of the <HI>right means</HI> of surmounting the difficulties in coming to the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Characters of Men:</HI> This the poet shews, is <HI>by investigat∣ing the</HI> RULING PASSION; of whose origin and nature we may find an exact account in the second Ep. of the <HI>Essay on Man.</HI> This <HI>Principle</HI> he rightly observes (from ℣ 173 to 180) is the clue that must guide us thro' all the intricacies in the ways of men: To convince us of which, he applies it (from ℣ 179 to 210) to the most wild and inconsistent Character that ever was; which (when drawn out at length, in a spirit of poetry as rare as the character itself) we see, this <HI>Principle</HI> unravels, and renders throughout of one plain consistent thread.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="235"/>
VER. 210. <HI>Yet, in this search,</HI> &amp;c.] But here (from ℣ 209 to 222) he gives one very necessary caution, that, in developing the <HI>Ruling Passion,</HI> we must be careful not to mistake a <HI>subsi∣diary</HI> passion for the <HI>principal;</HI> which, without great attention, we may be very liable to do; as the <HI>subsidiary,</HI> acting in support of the <HI>principal,</HI> has frequently all its <HI>vigour</HI> and much of its <HI>per∣severance:</HI> This error has misled several both of the ancient and modern historians; as when they supposed <HI>Lust</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI> to be Characteristics of <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Lucullus;</HI> whereas, in truth, the <HI>Ruling Passion</HI> of both was <HI>Ambition;</HI> which is so certain, that, at whatsoever different time of the Republic these men had lived, their <HI>Ambition,</HI> as the <HI>Ruling Passion,</HI> had béen the
<PB N="189" REF="236"/>
same; but a different time had changed their <HI>subsidiary</HI> ones of <HI>Lust</HI> and <HI>Luxury,</HI> into their very opposites of <HI>Chastity</HI> and <HI>Fru∣gality.</HI> 'Tis in vain therefore, says our author, for the observer of human nature to fix his attention on the <HI>Workman,</HI> if he all the while mistakes the <HI>Scaffold</HI> for the <HI>Building.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 222. <HI>In this one Passion</HI> &amp;c.] But now it may be ob∣jected to our philosophic poet, that he has indeed shewn <HI>the true means</HI> of coming to <HI>the Knowledge and Characters of men</HI> by a <HI>Principle</HI> certain and infallible, when found, yet, by his own account, of so difficult investigation, that its <HI>Counterfeit,</HI> and it is always attended with one, may be easily mistaken for it. To
<PB N="190" REF="237" MS="y"/>
remove this difficulty, therefore, and consequently the objection that arises from it, the poet has given (from ℣ 221 to 228) one certain and infallible criterion of the <HI>Ruling Passion,</HI> which is this, that all the <HI>other</HI> passions, in the course of time, change and wear away; while <HI>this</HI> is ever constant and vigorous; and still going on from strength to strength, to the very moment of its demolishing the miserable machine that it has now at length over∣worked. Of this great truth, the poet (from ℣ 227 to the end) gives various instances in all the principal <HI>Ruling Passions</HI> of our nature, as they are to be found in the <HI>Man of Business,</HI> the <HI>Man of Pleasure,</HI> the <HI>Epicure,</HI> the <HI>Parcimonious,</HI> the <HI>Toast,</HI> the
<PB N="191" REF="238" MS="y"/>
<HI>Courtier,</HI> the <HI>Miser,</HI> and the <HI>Patriot;</HI> which last instance the poet has had the art, under the appearance of Satire, to turn in∣to the noblest Compliment on the person to whom the Epistle is addressed.</P>

<P><HI>Moral Essays.]</HI> The ESSAY ON MAN was intended to have been comprised in Four Books:</P>
<P>The <HI>First</HI> of which, the Au∣thor has given us under that title, in four Epistles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> was to have consisted of the same number: 1. Of the extent and limits of human Reason. 2. Of those Arts and Sciences, and of the parts of them, which are use∣ful, and therefore attainable, to∣gether with those which are un∣useful, and therefore unattain∣able. 3. Of the Nature, Ends, Use, and Application of the different Capacities of Men. 4. Of the Use of Learning, of the Science of the World, and of Wit; concluding with a Satyr against the Misapplication
<PB N="164" REF="211"/>
of them, illustrated by Pictures, Characters, and Examples.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> Book regarded Civil Regimen, or the Science of Politics, in which the seve∣ral forms of a Republic were to have been examined and explained; together with the several Modes of Religious Worship, as far forth as they affect Society; between which the Author always supposed there was the most interesting relation and closest connec∣tion; so that this part would have treated of Civil and Re∣ligious Society in their full ex∣tent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fourth</HI> and last Book concerned private Ethics or practical Morality, considered in all the Circumstances, Or∣ders, Professions, and Stations of human Life.</P>
<P>The Scheme of all this had been maturely digested, and communitated to the L. Bolin∣broke, Dr. Swist, and one or two more, and was intended for the only work of his riper Years: but was, partly thro' ill health, partly through dis∣couragements from the depra∣vity of the times, and partly on prudential and other considera∣tions, interrupted, postponed, and, lastly, in a manner laid aside.</P>
<P>But as this was the Author's favourite Work, which more exactly reflected the Image of his strong capacious Mind, and as we can have but a very im∣perfect idea of it from the <HI>dis∣jecta membra Poetae</HI> that now remain, it may not be amiss to be a little more particular con∣cerning each of these project∣ed books.</P>
<P>The FIRST, as it treats of Man in the abstract, and con∣siders him in general under every of his relations, becomes the foundation, and furnishes out the subjects, of the <HI>three</HI> following; so that</P>
<P>The SECOND BOOK takes up again the <HI>First</HI> and <HI>Second</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="212"/>
Epistles of the <HI>First</HI> Book, and treats of man in his intellectual Capacity at large, as has been explained above. Of this, on∣ly a small part of the conclu∣sion (which, as we said, was to have contained a Satire a∣gainst the misapplication of Wit and Learning) may be found in the <HI>Fourth</HI> book of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and up and down, occasionally, in the other <HI>three.</HI></P>
<P>The THIRD Book, in like manner, reassumes the subject of the <HI>Third</HI> Epistle of the <HI>First,</HI> which treats of Man in his Social, Political, and Reli∣gious Capacity. But this part the Poet afterwards conceived might be best executed in an EPIC POEM; as the Action would make it more animated, and the Fable less invidious; in which all the great Princi∣ples of true and false Govern∣ments and Religions should be chiefly delivered in feigned Examples.</P>
<P>The FOURTH and last Book pursues the subject of the <HI>Fourth</HI> Epistle of the <HI>First,</HI> and treats of <HI>Ethics,</HI> or prac∣tical Morality▪ and would have consisted of many mem∣bers; of which the four fol∣lowing Epistles were detached Portions: the <HI>two first,</HI> on the <HI>Characters of Men and Wo∣men,</HI> being the <HI>introductory</HI> part of this concluding Book.</P>

To acknowledge a God and his Providence would be next to introducing a morality destruc∣tive of that public system which they think necessary for the government of the world. They have recourse therefore to that absurd scheme of Power which rules by no other law than <HI>Fate</HI> or <HI>Destiny.</HI> The consideration of this per∣haps was the reason that the poet, to keep up decorum, and to preserve the distinction between a <HI>Patriot</HI> and a <HI>Poli∣tician,</HI> makes the former rely on <HI>Providence</HI> for the public safety, in the concluding words of the Epistle,

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Of the Characters of Wo∣men.]</HI> There is nothing in Mr. Pope's works more highly finished than this Epistle: Yet its success was in no propor∣tion to the pains he took in composing it. Something he chanced to drop in a short Ad∣vertisement prefixed to it, on its first publication, may per∣haps account for the small at∣tention given to it. He said, that <HI>no one character in it was drawn from the life.</HI> The Public believed him on his word, and expressed little cu∣riosity about a Satire in which there was nothing personal.</P>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>Nothing so true</HI> &amp;c.] The reader perhaps may
<PB N="194" REF="242"/>
be disappointed to find that this <HI>Epistle,</HI> which proposes the same subject with the pre∣ceding, is conducted on very different rules of method; for instead of being disposed in the same logical connection, and filled with the like philosophi¦cal remarks, it is wholly taken up in drawing a great variety of capital Characters: But if he would reflect, that the <HI>two Sexes</HI> make but <HI>one Species,</HI> and consequently, that the Cha∣racters of both must be studied and explained on the same principles, he would see, that when the poet had done this in the preceding Epistle, his business here was, not to re∣peat what he had already de∣livered, but only to verify and illustrate his doctrine, by every <HI>view</HI> of that perplexity of Na∣ture, which <HI>his</HI> philosophy only can explain. If the reader therefore will but be at the pains to study these Characters with any degree of attention, as they are here masterly drawn, one important parti∣cular (for which the poet has artfully prepared him by the introduction) will very forci∣bly strike his observation; and that is, that all the great strokes in the several Characters of <HI>Women</HI> are not only infinitely perplexed and discordant, like those in <HI>Men,</HI> but absolutely inconsistent, and in a much higher degree <HI>contradictory.</HI> As strange as this may appear, yet he will see that the poet has all the while strictly fol∣lowed Nature, whose ways, we find by the former Epistle, are not a little mysterious; and a mystery this might have re∣mained, had not our author explained it at ℣ 207, where he shuts up his <HI>Characters</HI> with this philosophical reflexion:</P>
<LG>
<L>In Men, we <HI>various ruling Passions</HI> find;</L>
<L>In Women, <HI>two</HI> almost divide the kind;</L>
<L>Those, only fix'd, they first or last obey,</L>
<L>The love of Pleasure, and the love of Sway.</L>
</LG>
<P>If this account be true, we see the perpetual necessity (which is not the case in <HI>Men)</HI> that <HI>Women</HI> lye under of <HI>disguising</HI> their <HI>ruling passion.</HI> Now the variety of arts employed to this purpose must needs draw them into infinite contradic∣tions
<PB N="195" REF="243"/>
in those <HI>Actions</HI> from whence their general and ob∣vious Character is denomi∣nated: To verify this observa∣tion, let the reader examine all the Characters here drawn▪ and try whether with this key he cannot discover that all their Contradictions arise from a desire to hide the <HI>ruling Pas∣sion.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not the worst. The poet afterwards (from ℣ 218 to 249) takes notice of another mischief arising from this necessity of hiding their ruling Passions; which is, that generally the end of each is defeated even there where they are most violently pursued: For the necessity of hiding them inducing an habitual dis∣sipation of mind, Reason, whose office it is to regulate the <HI>ruling Passion,</HI> loses all its force and direction; and these unhappy victims to their prin∣ciples, tho' with their atten∣tion still <HI>fixed</HI> upon them, are ever prosecuting the means destructive of their end, and thus become ridiculous in youth, and miserable in old age.</P>
<P>Let me not omit to observe the great beauty of the con∣clusion: It is an Encomium on an imaginary Lady to whom the Epistle is addressed, and artfully turns upon the fact which makes the subject of the Epistle, the <HI>contradiction of a Woman's Character,</HI> in which contradiction he shews that all the lustre even of the best Character consists:
<Q><L>And yet, believe me, good as well as ill,</L>

VER. 156. <HI>Chameleons who can paint in white and black?]</HI> There is one thing that does a very distinguished honour to the accuracy of our poet's judgment, of which, in the course of these observations, I have given many instances, and shall here explain in what it consists; it is this, that the <HI>Si∣militudes</HI> in his didactic poems, of which he is not sparing, and which are highly poetical, are always chosen with such exqui∣site discernment of Nature, as not only to illustrate the par∣ticular point he is upon, but to establish the general princi∣ples he would inforce; so, in the instance before us, he com∣pares the inconstancy and con∣tradiction in the Characters of Women, to the change of co∣lours in the Chameleon; yet 'tis nevertheless the great prin∣ciple of this poem to shew that the general Characteristic of the Sex, as to the Ruling Pas∣sion, which they all have, is more uniform than that in Man: Now for this purpose, all Nature could not have sup∣plied such another illustration as this of the Chameleon; for tho' it instantaneously assumes much of the colour of every subject on which it chances to be placed, yet, as the most ac∣curate <HI>Virtuosi</HI> have observed, it has two native colours of its own, which, amidst all these changes are never totally dis∣charged, but, tho' often dis∣coloured by the neighbourhood of adventitious ones, still make the foundation, and give a tinc∣ture to all those which, from thence, it occasionally assumes.</P>
<P>VER. 157. <HI>"Yet Cloe sure</HI> &amp;c.] The purpose of the poet in this Character is important: It is to shew that the politic or prudent government of the passions is not enough to make a Character amiable, nor even to secure it from being ridi∣culous, if the end of that go∣vernment be not pursued, which is the free exercise of the social appetites after the selfish
<PB N="205" REF="253"/>
ones have been subdued; for that if, tho' reason govern, the heart be never consulted, we interest ourselves as little in the fortune of such a Character, as in any of the foregoing, which passions or caprice drive up and down at random.</P>

VER. 253. <HI>So when the Sun's broad beam</HI> &amp;c.] One of the great beauties observable in the poet's management of his <HI>Similitudes,</HI> is the ceremo∣nious preparation he makes for them, in gradually raising the imagery of the similitude in the lines preceding, by the use of metaphors taken from the sub∣ject of it:
<Q><L>—while what <HI>fatigues</HI> the ring,</L>
<L><HI>Flaunts</HI> and <HI>goes down,</HI> an unregarded thing.</L></Q>
And the civil dismission he gives them by the continuance of the same metaphor, in the lines following, whereby the traces of the imagery gradually decay, and give place to others, and the reader is never offended with the sudden or abrupt dis∣appearence of it,
<Q><L>Oh! blest with Temper, whose <HI>unclouded ray</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>

VER. 269.

And having thus made his <HI>Woman,</HI> he did, as the ancient poets were wont, when they had made their. <HI>Muse,</HI> in∣voke, and address his poem to, her.</P>

VER. 285. &amp;c. <HI>Ascendant Phoebus watch'd that hour with care, Averted half your Pa∣rents' simple Pray'r; And gave you Beauty, but deny'd the Pelf]</HI> The poet concludes his Epistle with a fine <HI>Moral,</HI> that deserves the serious attention of the pub∣lic: It is this, that all the ex∣travagances of these <HI>vicious</HI> Characters here described, are much inflamed by a wrong Education, hinted at in ℣ 203; and that even the <HI>best</HI> are ra∣ther secured by a <HI>good natural</HI> than by the prudence and pro∣vidence of parents; which ob∣servation is conveyed under the sublime classical machinery of Phoebus in the ascendant, watching the natal hour of his favourite, and averting the ill effects of her parents mistaken fondness: For Phoebus, as the god of Wit, consers Genius; and, as one of the astronomical influences, defeats the adventitious byas of education.</P>
<P>In conclusion, the great Mo∣ral from both these Epistles to∣gether is, that the two rarest things in all Nature are a DIS∣INTERESTED MAN, and a REASONABLE WOMAN.</P>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>EPISTLE III.] This Epistle was written after a violent out∣cry against our Author, on a supposition that he had ridiculed a worthy nobleman merely for his wrong taste. He justified him∣self upon that article in a letter to the Earl of Burlington; at the end of which are these words: <Q>“I have learnt that there are some who would rather be wicked than ridiculous; and there∣fore it may be safer to attack vices than follies. I will there∣fore leave my betters in the quiet possession of their idols, their groves, and their high places; and change my subject from their pride to their meanness, from their vanities to their mi∣series; and as the only certain way to avoid misconstructions, to lessen offence, and not to multiply ill-natured applications, I may probably, in my next, make use of real names instead of fictitious ones.”</Q> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>Who shall decide,</HI> &amp;c.] The address of the <HI>Introduction</HI> (from ℣ 1 to 21) is remarkable: The poet represents him∣self and the noble Lord his friend, as in a conversation, philo∣sophising on the <HI>final cause</HI> of <HI>Riches;</HI> and it porceeds by way of
<PB N="216" REF="267" MS="y"/>
dialogue, which most writers use to hide want of method; our Author only to soften and enliven the dryness and severity of it. <HI>You</HI> (says the poet)</P>
<LG>
<L>—hold the word from Jove to Momus giv'n,</L>
<L>But I, who think more highly of our kind, &amp;c.</L>
<L>Opine that Nature, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>As much as to say, <Q>“You, my Lord, hold the subject we are upon as fit only for <HI>Satire;</HI> I, on the contrary, esteem it a case of Philosophy and profound <HI>Ethics:</HI> But as we both agree in the main <HI>Principle,</HI> that <HI>Riches were not given for the reward of Virtue, but for very different purposes</HI> (See <HI>Essay on Man,</HI> Ep. iv.) let us compromise the matter, and consider the subject jointly, both under your idea and mine, <HI>i. e. Sati∣rically</HI> and <HI>Philosophically.”</HI></Q>—And this, in fact, we shall find to be the true character of this poem, which is a <HI>Species</HI> pecu∣liar to itself, and partaking equally of the nature of his <HI>Ethic Epistles</HI> and his <HI>Satires,</HI> as the best pieces of <HI>Lucian</HI> arose from a combination of the Dialogues of <HI>Plato,</HI> and the Scenes of <HI>Aristo∣phanes.</HI> This it will be necessary to carry with us, if we would see either the <HI>Wit</HI> or the <HI>Reasoning</HI> of this Epistle in their true light.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="269"/>
VER. 21. <HI>What Nature wants,</HI> &amp;c.] Having thus settled the terms of the <HI>Debate,</HI> before he comes to the <HI>main Question,</HI> the <HI>Use of Riches,</HI> it was necessary to discuss a <HI>previous</HI> one, whe∣ther indeed they are, upon the whole, <HI>useful to mankind or not;</HI> (which he does from ℣ 20 to 77.) It is commonly observed, says he (from ℣ 21 to 35) <HI>That Gold most commodiously supplies the wants of Nature:</HI> <Q>“Let us first consider the proposition in <HI>ge∣neral,</HI> both in <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Expression;</HI> 1. As it regards the <HI>Sup∣ply;</HI> and this we shall find to be very <HI>unequal:</HI> 2. As it regards the <HI>Wants;</HI> and these, we shall see, are very <HI>ambiguous;</HI> under
<PB N="219" REF="270"/>
that term, all our fantastic and imaginary, as well as real wants being comprized. Hitherto the use is not very ap∣parent.
<PB N="220" REF="271"/>
Let us in the second place, therefore, consider the proposition in <HI>particular,</HI> or how Gold supplies the <HI>wants of Nature</HI> both in private and public life: 1. As to <HI>private;</HI> it aids us, indeed, to support life; but it, at the same time, hires the assassin: 2.

As to <HI>Government;</HI> it pays the Guards necessary for the support of public liberty; but it may, with the same ease, bribe a Senate to overturn it.”</Q></P>
<P>The matter, therefore, being thus problematical, the poet, in∣stead of formally balancing between the <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Ill,</HI> chuses to leave this <HI>previous Question undetermined</HI> (as <HI>Tacitus</HI> had done before him; where, speaking of the ancient <HI>Germans,</HI> he says, <HI>Argentum et aurum propitii aut irati Dii negaverint dubito;)</HI> and
<PB N="221" REF="272"/>
falls at once upon what he esteems the <HI>principal</HI> of these abuses, <HI>public▪Corruption.</HI></P>
<P>For having in the last instance, of the <HI>Use of Riches</HI> in Go∣vernment, spoken of <HI>venal Senates,</HI> he goes on to lament the mischief as desperate and remediless; <HI>Gold,</HI> by its power to corrupt with <HI>Secrecy,</HI> defeating all the efforts of public Spirit, whether exerted in the Courage of Heroes, or in the Wisdom of Patriots.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed (continues the poet from ℣ 34 to 49) the very weight of the Bribery has sometimes detected the Cor∣ruption:
<Q><L>From the crack'd bag the dropping Guinea <HI>spoke,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>
But this inconvenience was soon repaired, by the invention of <HI>Paper credit:</HI> Whose dreadful effects on public Liberty he de∣scribes in all the colouring of his poetry, heightened by the warmest concern for virtue; which now makes him willing to give up, as it were, the <HI>previous question,</HI> in a passionate wish (from ℣ 48 to 59) for the return of that incumbrance attendant on public Corruption, before the so <HI>common</HI> use of money.</P>
<P>And pleased with this flattering idea, he goes on (from ℣ 58 to 77) to shew the other advantages that would accrue from <HI>Riches only in kind;</HI> which are, that neither <HI>Avarice</HI> could contrive to hoard, nor <HI>Prodigality</HI> to lavish, in so mad and boundless a man∣ner as they do at present. Here he shews particularly, in a fine ironical description of the embarras on <HI>Gaming,</HI> how effectually at would eradicate that execrable practice.</P>
<P>But this whole <HI>Digression</HI> (from ℣ 34 to 77) has another very uncommon beauty; for, at the same time that it arises naturally from the <HI>last</HI> consideration in the debate of the <HI>previous Question,</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="273" MS="y"/>
it artfully denounces, in our entrance on the <HI>main Question,</HI> the principal topics intended to be employed for the dilucidation of it, namely AVARICE, PROFUSION, and PUBLIC CORRUP∣TION.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="276"/>
VER. 77. <HI>Since then, my Lord, on such a World</HI> &amp;c.] Having thus ironically described the incumbrance which the want of money would occasion to all criminal excesses in the use of Riches, particularly to <HI>Gaming,</HI> which being now become of public concern, he affects much regard to:
<Q><L>Oh filthy check on all industrious skill,</L>
<L>To spoil the Nation's last great trade, Quadrille!</L></Q>
<PB N="226" REF="279"/>
he concludes the <HI>previous Question</HI> without deciding it, in the same <HI>ironical</HI> manner,
<Q><L>Since then, my Lord, on such a World we fall:</L>
<L>What say you? Say? Why take it, Gold and all.</L></Q>
That is, since for these great purposes we must have <HI>Money,</HI> let us now <HI>seriously</HI> inquire into its <HI>true Use.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 79. <HI>What Riches give us</HI> &amp;c.] He examines therefore in the <HI>first</HI> place (from ℣ 78 to 97) I. <HI>Of what Use Riches are to ourselves:</HI>
<Q><L>What Riches give us let us then enquire:</L>
<L>Meat, Fire, and Cloaths. What more? Meat, Cloaths, and Fire.</L></Q>
The mere <HI>turn</HI> of the expression here shews, without further reasoning, that all the infinite ways of spending <HI>on ourselves,</HI> contrived in the insolence of Wealth, by those who would <HI>more than live,</HI> are only these <HI>three</HI> things diversified throughout every wearied mode of Luxury and Wantonness.</P>
<P>Yet as little as this is, adds the poet (from ℣ 81 to 85) it is only to be had by the <HI>moderate use</HI> of Riches; <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Pro∣fusion</HI> not allowing the possessors of the most exorbitant wealth even this little:</P>
<LG>
<L>Alas! 'tis more than <HI>Turner</HI> finds they give.</L>
<L>Alas! 'tis more than (all his visions past)</L>
<L>Unhappy <HI>Wharton,</HI> waking, found at last!</L>
</LG>
<P>But what is it you would expect them to give? continues the poet (from ℣ 84 to 91) Would you have them capable of <HI>re∣storing</HI> those <HI>real</HI> blessings, which men have <HI>lost</HI> by their <HI>Vices</HI> or their <HI>Villainies;</HI> or of <HI>satisfying</HI> those <HI>imaginary</HI> ones, which they have <HI>gotten</HI> by their <HI>irregular Appetites</HI> and <HI>Passions? These,</HI> sure, the bad or foolish man cannot have the face to demand; and <HI>those,</HI> by the wise provision of Nature, Riches are incapable of giving, if he had.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="280"/>
But now admit, pursues our author (from ℣ 90 to 97) that wealth might, in some cases, alleviate the unmerited miseries of life, by procuring medicine both for the mind and body; yet it
<PB N="228" REF="281"/>
is not to be thought it should operate like a charm, while only worn about one: Yet this, these <HI>poor men of pelf</HI> expect from it; while <HI>Avarice,</HI> on the one hand, with-holds them from giving at all; even to the <HI>Doctor</HI> in extremity; or <HI>Vanity</HI> diverts the donation from a <HI>Friend</HI> in life, to the Endowment of a <HI>Cat</HI> of <HI>College</HI> at their death. It is true, <HI>Riches</HI> might give the greatest of all blessings, a <HI>virtuous consciousness</HI> of our having employed them as became the <HI>substitutes of Providence,</HI>
<Q><L>To ease or emulate the care of Heav'n, <BIBL>℣ 230.</BIBL></L></Q>

<P><PB N="229" REF="282"/>
VER. 97. <HI>To some, indeed,</HI> &amp;c.] For now the poet comes' in the second place, to examine, II. <HI>Of what use Riches are to others;</HI> which he teaches, as is his way throughout this poem' by the <HI>abuse</HI> that stands opposed to it: Thus he shews (from ℣ 96 to 107) that with regard to acts of <HI>Beneficence,</HI> the utmost Hea∣ven will grant to those who so greatly abuse its blessings, is either to enrich some favourite <HI>Bastard,</HI> and so perpetuate their vice and infamy; or else, contrary to their intent, a legitimate <HI>Son they hated,</HI> and so expose to public scorn and ridicule, the de∣feat of their unnatural cruelty. But with regard to acts of <HI>Charity,</HI> they are given up to so reprobate a sense, as to believe they are then seconding the designs of Heaven, when they pur∣sue the indigent with imprecations, or leave them in the midst of their distresses unrelieved, as the common enemies of God and Man.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="283" MS="y"/>
VER. 107. <HI>Yet, to be just,</HI> &amp;c.] Having thus shewn the <HI>true use</HI> of Riches in a description of the <HI>abuse,</HI> and how that use is perpetually defeated by <HI>Profusion</HI> and <HI>Avarice;</HI> it was natural to enquire into the spring and original of these vices; as the <HI>abuse</HI> they occasion, must be well understood, before it can be cor∣rected. The disposition, therefore, of his subject now calls upon him to come to the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of it: And he examines particularly into the <HI>Motives</HI> of <HI>Avarice:</HI> But what is observable, he, all along, satirically intermixes with the <HI>real motives,</HI> several
<PB N="231" REF="284" MS="y"/>
<HI>imaginary;</HI> and those as wild as imagination could conceive. This, which at first fight might seem to vitiate the purpose of his <HI>philosophical inquiry,</HI> is found, when duly considered, to have the highest art of design. His business, the reader sees, was to prove that the <HI>real motives</HI> had the highest extravagancy: No∣thing could more conduce to this end, than the setting them by, and comparing them with, the most extravagant that the fancy itself could invent; in which situation it was seen, that the <HI>real</HI> were full as wild as the <HI>fictitious</HI> To give these images all the force they were capable of, he first describes (from ℣ 118 to 123)
<PB N="232" REF="285"/>
the <HI>real</HI> and a different <HI>imaginary</HI> motive in the <HI>same person:</HI> and then (from ℣ 122 to 133) an <HI>imaginary</HI> one, and a <HI>real</HI> the very same with the imaginary, in <HI>different persons.</HI> This ad∣dress the poet himself alludes to, ℣ 155.</P>
<Q><L>Less mad the wildest whimsey we can frame, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>Let me observe, that this has still a further beauty, arising from the <HI>nature</HI> of the poem, which (as we have shewn) is partly <HI>satirical,</HI> and partly <HI>philosophical.</HI>—With regard to the <HI>parti∣cular</HI> beauties of this disposition, I shall only take notice of one; where the poet introduces the <HI>fictitious</HI> motive of Blunt's avarice, by a wizard's prophecy:</P>
<LG>
<L>"At length Corruption, like a gen'ral flood</L>
<L>"(So long by watchful Ministers withstood)</L>

<L>"See Britain sunk in lucre's sordid charms,</L>
<L>"And France reveng'd on Anne's and Edward's arms!</L>
</LG>
<P>For it was the poet's purpose, in this poem, to shew, that the <HI>main</HI> and <HI>principal abuse</HI> of Riches arises from AVARICE.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="288" MS="y"/>
VER. 151. <HI>"All this is madness,"</HI> &amp;c.] But now the <HI>Sage,</HI> who has confined himself to <HI>books,</HI> which prescribe the <HI>government of the passions;</HI> and never looked out upon the world, where he might see them let loose, and, like Milton's devils, <HI>riding the air in whirlwind,</HI> cries out, <HI>All this is madness.</HI> True, replies the poet (from ℣ 151 to 177) but this madness is a common one, and only to be prevented by a severe attention to the rule laid down in the <HI>Essay,</HI>
<Q><L>Reason still use, to Reason still attend,</L>

<L>The <HI>ruling Passion</HI> conquers Reason still.</L></Q>
But then (continues he) as wild as this passion appears, by the sway of its overbearing bias, it would be still more senseless had it no bias at all. You have seen us here intermix with the <HI>real,</HI> the most <HI>fantastical</HI> and extravagant that imagination could form; yet even these are less extravagant than a <HI>ruling Passion without a constant aim.</HI> Would you know the reason? then listen to this important truth: <Q>“”'Tis HEAVEN itself that gives the <HI>ruling Passion,</HI> and thereby directs different men to dif∣ferent ends:</Q> But these being exerted through the ministry of

<P>In the first part, to ℣ 109, the <HI>use</HI> and <HI>abuse</HI> of Riches are <HI>satirically</HI> delivered in <HI>precept.</HI> From thence, to ℣ 177, the causes of the abuse are <HI>philosophically</HI> inquired into: And from thence to the end, the <HI>use</HI> and <HI>abuse</HI> are <HI>historically</HI> illustrated in <HI>examples.</HI> Where we may observe, that the conclusion of the <HI>first</HI> part, concerning the Miser's cruelty to others, naturally introduces the <HI>second,</HI> by a satirical apology, shewing that he is full as cruel to himself: The explanation of which extraordinary phenomenon brings the author into the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of his subject;
<PB N="239" REF="292"/>
and this ending in an observation of Avarice and Profusion's cor∣recting and reconciling one another, as naturally introduces the <HI>third,</HI> which proves the truth of the observation from <HI>fact.</HI> And thus the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of his subject standing between his <HI>Precepts</HI> and <HI>Examples,</HI> gives strength and light to both, and receives it reflected back again from both.</P>
<P>He first gives us two examples (from ℣ 176 to 219) of these opposite <HI>ruling Passions,</HI> and (to see them in their full force) taken from <HI>subjects,</HI> as he tells us, <HI>not void of wit or worth;</HI> from such as could <HI>reason</HI> themselves (as we see by ℣ 183, &amp; <HI>seqq.</HI> and ℣ 205, &amp; <HI>seqq)</HI> into the whole length of each extreme: For the poet had observed of the <HI>ruling passion,</HI> that

VER. 219. <HI>The Sense to value Riches,</HI> &amp;c.] Having now large∣ly exposed the ABUSE of Riches by <HI>example,</HI> not only the <HI>Plan,</HI> but the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of his <HI>Poem,</HI> required, that he should in the same way, shew the USE likewise: He therefore (from ℣ 218 to 249) calls for an EXAMPLE, in which may be found, against
<PB N="242" REF="295"/>
the <HI>Prodigal,</HI> the <HI>Sense to value Riches;</HI> against the <HI>Vain,</HI> the <HI>Art to enjoy them;</HI> and against the <HI>Avaricious,</HI> the <HI>Virtue to im∣part them,</HI> when acquired. This whole Art (he tells us) may be comprized in one great and general precept, which is this, <Q>“That the rich man should consider himself as the substitute of Providence in this unequal distribution of things; as the person who is
<Q><L>To case, or emulate, the care of Heav'n;</L></Q>
”</Q>
To <HI>mend</HI> the faults of fortune, or to <HI>justify</HI> her grace. And thus the poet slides naturally into the prosecution of his subject in an <HI>Example</HI> of the <HI>true Use</HI> of Riches.</P>

VER. 249. <HI>But all our praises why should Lords engross? Rise, honest Muse!]</HI> This invidious expression of the poet's unwilling∣ness that the Nobility should ingross all his praises, is strongly ironi∣cal;

their example having been given hitherto only to shew the <HI>abuse</HI> of Riches. But there is great justness of <HI>Design,</HI> as well as agreeableness of <HI>Manner</HI> in the preference here given to the <HI>Man of Ross.</HI> The purpose of the poet is to shew, that an <HI>im∣mense</HI> fortune is not wanted for all the good that Riches are ca∣pable of doing; he therefore chuses such an instance, as proves, that a man with five hundred pounds a year could become a blessing to a whole country; and, consequently, that the poet's precepts for the <HI>true use of money,</HI> are of more <HI>general</HI> service than a bad heart will give an indifferent head leave to con∣ceive. This was a truth of the greatest importance to inculcate: He therefore (from ℣ 249 to 297) exalts the character of a <HI>very private</HI> man, one Mr. J. Kyrle, of Herefordshire: And, in ending his description, struck as it were with admiration at a sublimity of <HI>his own creating,</HI> and warmed with sentiments of a gratitude he had raised in himself in behalf of the public, the poet bursts out,

VER. 297.
<Q><L>Behold what blessings Wealth to life can lend!</L>

In the <HI>first</HI> part of this Epistle the author had shewn, from <HI>Rea∣son,</HI> that Riches abused afford no comfort either in <HI>life</HI> or <HI>death.</HI> In <HI>this</HI> part, where the same truth is taught by <HI>examples,</HI> he had, in the case of <HI>Cotta</HI> and his son, shewn, that they afford no comfort in <HI>life:</HI> the other member of the division remained to be spoken to,
<Q><L>Now see what Comfort they afford our <HI>end.</HI></L></Q>
And this he illustrates (from ℣ 298 to 339) in describing the unhappy deaths of the last Villers, Duke of Buckingham, and Sir J. Cutler; whose profusion and avarice he has beautifully contrasted. The miserable end of these two extraordinary per∣sons naturally leads the poet into this humane reflexion, how∣ever ludicrously expressed,
<Q><L>Say, for such worth, are other worlds prepar'd?</L>
<L>Or are they both, in this, their own reward?</L></Q>

When, on a sudden, the whole scene is changed,

<PB N="254" REF="307"/>
<HI>things;</HI> while, at the same time, it is an answer to the latter part of the question,
<Q><L>Say, for such worth are other worlds prepar'd?</L>
<L>Or are they both, in this their own reward?</L></Q>
For the solution of which only, this example was jocularly pre∣tended to have been given.</P>
<P>All this the poet has admirably supported, in the artful con∣struction of his fable of Sir Balaam; whose character is so drawn, as to let the reader see he had it in his power to regulate the <HI>ruling Passion</HI> by reason, as having in himself the seeds of Inte∣grity, Religion, and Sobriety. These are gradually worked out by an insatiable <HI>thirst of Wealth;</HI> and this again (thro' a false sense of his own abilities in acquiring it) succeeded by as immo∣derate a <HI>Vanity:</HI> Which will lead us to another beauty in the management of the Story. For, in order to see, in one conclud∣ing
<PB N="255" REF="308"/>
example, the miseries of exorbitant wealth ill employed; it was necessary to set before the Reader all the misuse, that flow∣ed from avarice and profusion at once. The vices of the <HI>Citi∣zen</HI> and the <HI>Noble,</HI> therefore, which were separated and contrast∣ed in the foregoing instances, are here shewn incorporated in a <HI>Courtly Cit.</HI> Perhaps it will be said, that the character has, by this means, the appearance of two <HI>ruling passions:</HI> but those studied in human nature know the contrary: and that <HI>alieni ap∣petens sui profusus,</HI> is frequently as much one as either the pro∣fuse or avaricious apart. Indeed, this is so far from an inaccu∣racy, that it produces a new beauty. The <HI>Ruling Passion</HI> is of two kinds, the <HI>simple</HI> and the <HI>complex.</HI> The first sort the poet had given examples of before. Nothing then remained to com∣plete his philosophic plan, but concluding with the latter. Let me only observe farther, that the author, in this <HI>Tale,</HI> has art∣fully summed up and recapitulated those three principal mischiefs in the <HI>abuse</HI> of money, which the <HI>satirical</HI> part of this poem throughout was employed to expose, namely AVARICE, PRO∣FUSION, and PUBLIC CORRUPTION.</P>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>EPISTLE IV.] The extremes of <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Profusion</HI> being treated of in the foregoing Epistle; this takes up one particular branch of the latter, the <HI>Vanity of Expence</HI> in people of wealth and quality; and is therefore a corollary to the preceding, just as the Epistle on the <HI>Characters of Women</HI> is to that <HI>of the Knowledge and Characters of Men.</HI> It is equally remarkable for exactness of method with the rest. But the nature of the sub∣ject, which is less philosophical, makes it capable of being ana∣lised in a much narrower compass.</P>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>'Tis strange,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet's introduction (from ℣ 1 to 39) consists of a very curious <HI>remark,</HI> arising from his intimate knowledge of nature; together with an <HI>illustration</HI> of it, taken from his observations on life. It is this, That the Prodigal no more <HI>enjoys</HI> his Profusion, than the Miser, his Ra∣pacity. It was generally thought that <HI>Avarice</HI> only <HI>kept</HI> with∣out enjoyment; but the poet here first acquaints us with a cir∣cumstance in human life much more to be lamented, viz. that <HI>Profusion</HI> too can <HI>communicate</HI> without it; whereas <HI>Enjoyment</HI> was thought to be as peculiarly the reward of the <HI>beneficent</HI> pas∣sions (of which this has the appearance) as <HI>want</HI> of enjoyment was the punishment of the <HI>selfish.</HI> The phaenomenon observed is odd enough. But if we look more narrowly into this matter, we shall find, that Prodigality, when in pursuit of <HI>Taste,</HI> is only a <HI>Mode of Vanity,</HI> and consequently as selfish a passion as even avarice itself; and it is of the ordonance and constitution of all selfish passions, when growing to excess, to defeat their own end, which is <HI>Self-enjoyment.</HI> But besides the accurate
<PB N="263" REF="317" MS="y"/>
philosophy of this observation, there is a fine <HI>Morality</HI> contained in it; namely, that <HI>ill-got</HI> Wealth is not only as <HI>unreasonably,</HI> but as <HI>uncomfortably</HI> squandered as it was raked together; which the poet himself further insinuates in ℣ 15.</P>
<Q><L>What brought Sir Visto's <HI>ill-got wealth</HI> to waste?</L></Q>
<P>—He then illustrates the above observation by divers examples in every branch of <HI>wrong Taste;</HI> and to set their absurdities in the strongest light, he, in conclusion, contrasts them with se∣veral instances of the <HI>true,</HI> in the Nobleman to whom the Epi∣stle is addressed. This disposition is productive of various beau∣ties; for, by this means, the <HI>Introduction</HI> becomes an <HI>epitome</HI> of the body of the Epistle; which, as we shall see, consists of ge∣neral reflections on <HI>Taste,</HI> and particular examples of <HI>bad</HI> and <HI>good.</HI> And his friend's Example concluding the Introduction, leads the poet gracefully into the subject itself; for the Lord, here celebrated for his good Taste, was now at hand to deliver the first and fundamental precept of it himself, which gives au∣thority and dignity to all that follow.</P>
<P><PB N="720" REF="324"/>
VER. 39. <HI>Ost have you hinted to your brother Peer, A certain truth,—]</HI> and in this artful manner begins the body of the Epistle.</P>
<P>I.</P>
<P>The first part of it (from ℣ 38 to 99) delivers rules for at∣taining to the MAGNIFICENT in just expence; which is the same in Building and Planting, that the SUBLIME is in Paint∣ing and Poetry; and, consequently, the qualities necessary for the attainment of both must have the same relation.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first and <HI>fundamental,</HI> he shews (from ℣ 38 to 47) to be SENSE:
<Q><L><HI>Good Sense,</HI> which only is the gift of Heav'n,</L>
<L>And, tho' no Science, fairly worth the seven.</L></Q>
And for <HI>that</HI> reason; not only as it is the foundation and parent of them all, and the constant regulator and director of their ope∣rations, or, as the poet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter expresses it,—<HI>of every art of the soul;</HI> but likewise as it alone can, in case of need, very often supply the offices of every one of them.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="325"/>
VER. 47. <HI>To build, to plant,</HI> &amp;c.] 2. The next quality, for dignity and use, is TASTE, and but the next: For, as the poet truly observes, there is—<HI>something previous ev'n to Taste—'tis Sense;</HI> and this, in the order of things: For <HI>Sense</HI> is a taste and true concep∣tion of <HI>Nature;</HI> and <HI>Taste</HI> is a sense or true concep∣tion of <HI>beautiful Nature;</HI> but we must first know the <HI>Essences</HI> of things, before we can judge truly of their <HI>Qualities.</HI> The bu∣siness of <HI>Taste,</HI> therefore, in the pursuit of <HI>Magnificence,</HI> is, as the poet shews us (from ℣ 46 to 65) 1. (to ℣ 51) To catch or lay hold on <HI>Nature,</HI> where she appears most in her charms. 2. (to ℣ 57) To adorn her, when taken, as best suits her dig∣nity and quality; that is, to dress her in the light and modest habit of a virgin, not load her with the gaudy ornaments of a prostitute. This rule observed, will prevent a transgression in the following, which is, not to let all its beauties be seen at once, but in succession; for that advantage is inseparable from a grace∣ful and well-dressed person. 3. (to ℣ 65) To take care that
<PB N="272" REF="326"/>
the ornaments be well suited to <HI>that part,</HI> which it is your pur∣pose to adorn; and, as in dressing out a <HI>modest Fair</HI> (which is the poet's own comparison) the colours are proportioned to her complexion; the stuff, to the enbonpoint of her person; and the fashion, to her air and shape; so in ornamenting a villa, <HI>the rise or fall of waters</HI> should correspond to its acclivities or decli∣vities; the <HI>artificial hills or vales</HI> to its cover or exposure; and the manner of <HI>calling in the country,</HI> to the disposition of its a∣spect. But again, as in the illustration, whatever be the variety in colour, stuff, or fashion, they must still be so suited with re∣spect to one another, as to produce an agreement and harmony in their assemblage; so woods, waters, mountains, vales, and vistas must, amidst all their diversity, be so disposed with a re∣lation to each other, as to create a perfect symmetry resulting from the whole; and this, the <HI>Genius</HI> of the place, when reli∣giously
<PB N="273" REF="327"/>
consulted, will never fail to inform us of; who, as the poet says,
<Q><L>Now breaks, and now directs th' intending lines,</L>
<L>Paints as you plant, and, as you work, designs.</L></Q>
And this is a full and complete description of the <HI>office of Taste.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="328" MS="y"/>
VER. 65. <HI>Still follow Sense,</HI> &amp;c] But now when <HI>Good Sense</HI> has led us up to <HI>Taste,</HI> our fondness for the elegancies of our new mistress, oftentimes occasions us to neglect the plainness and simplicity of the old; we are but too apt to forsake our Guide, and to give ourselves up solely to <HI>Taste.</HI> Our author's next rule therefore 3. is, <HI>Still to follow Sense,</HI> and let it perpetually accompany us thro' all the works of <HI>Taste.</HI>
<Q><L>Still follow Sense, of ev'ry art the <HI>Soul.</HI></L></Q>
That is, <HI>Good Sense</HI> should never be a moment absent from the works of <HI>Taste,</HI> any more than the Soul from the Body; for just as the Soul animates and informs every air and feature of a beau∣teous body, so <HI>Sense</HI> gives life and vigour to all the products of <HI>Taste.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 66. <HI>Parts answ'ring parts,</HI> &amp;c.] The particular advan∣tages of the union of Sense with Taste he then explains (from this verse to 71) 1. That the beautiful parts which <HI>Taste</HI> has laid
<PB N="275" REF="329"/>
out and contrived, <HI>Sense</HI> makes to answer one another, and to <HI>slide</HI> naturally, without violence, <HI>into a whole.</HI> 2. That many beauties will <HI>spontaneously</HI> offer themselves, suggested from the very necessity which <HI>Sense</HI> lays upon us, of conforming the parts to the whole, that no original invention of <HI>Taste</HI> would have supplied. 3. A third advantage is, that you are then always sure to have <HI>Nature on your side,</HI>
<Q><L>Nature shall join you—</L></Q>
The expression is important, when we were bid to <HI>begin with Sense</HI> we were shewn how this would lead us to <HI>Taste,</HI> in the pursuit of <HI>Nature:</HI> but now that he bids us to go on with Sense, or <HI>still to follow it,</HI> after having arrived at <HI>Taste,</HI> he tells us, that <HI>Nature</HI> will then <HI>join</HI> us of her own accord: This has a great beauty, which arises from the Philosophic Truth of the ob∣servation. For, as we observed before,—<HI>Sense</HI> being a right conception of <HI>Nature;</HI> and <HI>Taste</HI> a right conception of <HI>beautiful Nature;</HI> when these are in conjunction, Nature can stand out
<PB N="276" REF="330" MS="y"/>
no longer, but presents herself to you without further pains or search.</P>
<P>VER. 71. <HI>Without it, proud Versailles!</HI> &amp;c.] To illustrate this doctrine, the poet next shews us (from ℣ 70 to 99) that with∣out this continued support of <HI>Good Sense,</HI> things even of the <HI>highest Taste</HI> and <HI>utmost Magnificence,</HI> such as the Buildings of <HI>Versailles,</HI> the Gardens of <HI>Villario,</HI> and the Groves of <HI>Sabinus,</HI> (which are the instances he gives) all, in a very little time, come to nothing, and no wonder. For the exercise of <HI>Taste</HI> WITHOUT SENSE is, where something that is <HI>not beautiful Nature</HI> is mis∣taken for it; and <HI>ornamented</HI> as beautiful Nature should be: These ornaments, therefore, being destitute of all real support, must be continually subject to change. Sometimes the owner himself will grow weary of them (as in the case of <HI>Villario)</HI> and find at last, that <HI>Nature</HI> is to be preferred before them,</P>
<Q><L>Tir'd of the scene <HI>Parterres</HI> and <HI>Fountains</HI> yield,</L>
<L>He finds at last he better likes a <HI>Field.</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB N="277" REF="331" MS="y"/>
Sometime, again, the Heir (like <HI>Sabinus's)</HI> will be changing a bad Taste for a worse,
<Q><L><HI>One</HI> boundless green, <HI>or</HI> flourish'd carpet <HI>views,</HI></L>
<L>With all the <HI>mournful family</HI> of Yews.</L></Q>
So that <HI>mere Taste</HI> standing exposed between the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>false,</HI> like the decent man, between the rigidly virtuous, and tho∣roughly profligate, hated and despised by both, can never long support itself; and with this the <HI>first part</HI> of the Epistle concludes.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="336"/>
II.</P>
<P>VER. 99. <HI>At Timon's Villa,</HI> &amp;c.] As the first part ended with exposing the works of <HI>Taste without Sense,</HI> the second begins with a description (from ℣ 98 to 173) of <HI>false Magnificence</HI> WITH∣OUT FITHER SENSE OR TASTE, in the gardens, buildings, table furniture, library, and way of living of Lord <HI>Timon;</HI> who, in none of these, could distinguish between <HI>greatness</HI> and <HI>vast∣ness,</HI> between <HI>regularity</HI> and <HI>form,</HI> between <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>state,</HI> or between <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>pedantry.</HI> But what then? says the poet, here resuming the great <HI>principle of his Philosophy</HI> (which these moral Epistles were written to illustrate, and consequently on which they are all regulated) tho'</P>
<Q><L>Heav'n visits with a Taste the wealthy Fool,</L>
<L>And needs no <HI>Rod</HI>—</L></Q>
<P><PB N="281" REF="337"/>
Yet the punishment is confined as it ought; and the evil is turned to the benefit of others: For</P>
<LG>
<L>—hence the Poor are cloath'd, the Hungry fed;</L>
<L>Health to himself, and to his Infants bread,</L>
<L>The Lab'rer bears; what his <HI>hard heart</HI> denies,</L>
<L><HI>His</HI> charitable vanity <HI>supplies.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="288" REF="344"/>
VER. 173. <HI>Another age,</HI> &amp;c.] But now a difficulty sticks with me, (answers an objector) this load of evil still remains a monument of folly to future ages; an incumbrance to the plain on which it stands; and a nuisance to the neighbourhood round about, filling it</P>
<Q><L>—with imitating fools.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="289" REF="345"/>
For men are apt to take the example next at hand; and aptest of all to take a bad one. No fear of that, replies the poet, (from ℣ 172 to 177.) Nothing absurd or wrong is exempt from the jurisdiction of Time, which is always sure to do full justice on it;</P>
<LG>
<L>Another age shall see the golden Ear</L>
<L>Imbrown the Slope, and nod on the Parterre,</L>
<L>Deep Harvests bury all his pride has plann'd,</L>
<L>And laughing Ceres re-assume the land.</L>
</LG>
<P>For the prerogative of
<Q><L>—Time shall make it grow,</L></Q>
is only due to the designs of <HI>true Taste</HI> joined to <HI>Use:</HI> And
<Q><L>'Tis <HI>Use</HI> alone that <HI>sanctifies</HI> Expence;</L></Q>
and nothing but the sanctity of <HI>that</HI> can arrest the justice of Time. And thus the second part concludes; which consisting of an <HI>example</HI> of <HI>false</HI> Taste in every attempt to Magnificence, is full of concealed <HI>precepts</HI> for the <HI>true:</HI> As the first part, which contains <HI>precepts</HI> for <HI>true</HI> Taste, is full of <HI>examples</HI> of the <HI>false.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VER. 177. <HI>Who then shall grace,</HI> &amp;c.] We come now to the third and last part, (from ℣ 176 to the end) and, as in the first, the poet had given examples of wrong judged <HI>Magnificence,</HI> in
<PB N="290" REF="346" MS="y"/>
things of <HI>Taste without Sense;</HI> and, in the second, an example of others <HI>without either Sense or Taste;</HI> so the third is employed in two examples of <HI>Magnificence</HI> in <HI>Planting and Building;</HI> where <HI>both Sense and Taste</HI> highly prevail: The one in him, to whom this Epistle is addressed; and the other, in the truly noble person whose amiable Character bore so conspicuous a part in the foregoing.</P>
<P><Q><L>Who then shall grace, or who improve the Soil?</L>
<L>Who plants like <HI>BATHURST,</HI> or who builds like <HI>BOYLE.</HI></L></Q>
Where in the fine description he gives of these two species of <HI>Magnificence,</HI> he artfully insinuates, that tho', when executed in a <HI>true Taste,</HI> the great end and aim of both be the same. viz. the <HI>general</HI> good, in use or ornament; yet that their progress to this end is carried on in direct contrary courses; that, in
<PB N="291" REF="347"/>
<HI>Planting,</HI> the private advantage of the neighbourhood is first promoted, till, by time, it rises up to a public benefit:</P>
<LG>
<L>Whose ample Lawns are not asham'd to feed</L>
<L>The milky heifer and deserving steed;</L>
<L>Whose rising Forests, not for pride or show,</L>
<L>But future Buildings, future Navies grow.</L>
</LG>
<P>On the contrary, the wonders of Architecture ought first to be bestowed on the public:</P>
<LG>
<L>Bid Harbors open, public Ways extend,</L>
<L>Bid Temples, worthier of the God, ascend;</L>
<L>Bid the broad Arch the dang'rous flood contain;</L>
<L>The Mole projected break the roaring main.</L>
</LG>
<P>And when the public has been properly accommodated and adorn∣ed, then, and not till then, the works of private <HI>Magnificence</HI> may take place. This was the order observ'd by those two great Empires, from whom we received all we have of this polite art: We read not of any Magnificence in the private build∣ings of Greece or Rome, till the generosity of their public spi∣rit had adorned the State with Temples, Emporiums, Council∣houses, Common-Porticos, Baths, and Theatres.</P>

Nor will any ex∣amples of this vanity of orna∣ment in the sacred buildings of antiquity justify this imitation; for those ornaments might be very suitable to a Temple of Bacchus, or Venus, which would ill become the sobriety and pu∣rity of the present Religion.</P>
<P>Again, we should consider, that the usual form of a The∣atre would only permit the ar∣chitectonic ornaments to be placed on the outward face; whereas those of a <HI>Church</HI> may be as commodiously, and are more properly put within; par∣ticularly in great and close pent∣up Cities, where the incessant driving of the smoke, in a lit∣tle time corrodes and destroys all outward ornaments of this kind; especially if the mem∣bers, as is the common taste, be small and little.</P>
<P>Our Gothic ancestors had juster and manlier notions than these modern mimics of Greek and Roman magnificence: which, because the thing does honour to their genius, I shall endea∣vour to explain. All our anci∣ent churches are called, without distinction, <HI>Gothic;</HI> but errone∣ously. They are of two sorts; the one built in the Saxon times; the other during our Norman race of kings. Several <HI>Cathe∣dral</HI> and <HI>Collegiate</HI> Churches of the first sort are yet remaining, either in whole or in part; of which this was the Original▪
<PB N="267" REF="321"/>
When the Saxon kings became christian, their piety, (which was the piety of the times) con∣sisted in building Churches at home, and performing pilgri∣mages to the Holy I and: and these spiritual exercises assisted and supported one another. For the most venerable as well as most elegant models of re∣ligious edifices were then in Palestine. From these our Saxon Builders took the whole of their ideas, as may be seen by comparing the drawings which travellers have given us of the churches yet standing in that country, with the Saxon remains of what we find at home; and particularly in that sameness of style in the <HI>later</HI> religious edifices of the Knights Templars (professedly built up∣on the model of the church of the holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem) with the <HI>earlier</HI> remains of our Saxon Edifices. Now the ar∣chitecture of the Holy Land was entirely Grecian, but greatly fallen from its ancient elegance. Our Saxon performance was in∣deed a bad copy of it, and as much inferior to the works of
St. Helene, as her's were to the Grecian models she had follow∣ed: Yet still the footsteps of an∣cient art appeared in the circu∣lar arches, the entire columns, the division of the entablature, into a sort of Architrave, Frize and Cornich, and a solidity e∣qually diffused over the whole mass. This, by way of distinc∣tion, I would call the SAXON Architecture.</P>
<P>But our Norman works had a very different original. When the <HI>Goths</HI> had conquered Spain, and the genial warmth of the climate, and the religion of the old Inhabitants, had ripened their wits, and inflamed their mistaken piety (both kept in exercise by the neighbourhood of the Saracens, thro' emula∣tion of their science and aver∣sion to their superstition,) they struck out a new species of Architecture unknown to Greece and Rome; upon ori∣ginal principles, and ideas much nobler than what had given birth even to classical magni∣ficence. For having been ac∣customed, during the gloom of paganism, to worship the Deity in GROVES (a practice common to all nations) When their new Religion required co∣vered edifices, they ingeniously projected to make them resem∣ble <HI>Groves,</HI> as nearly as the
<PB N="268" REF="322" MS="y"/>
distance of Architecture would permit; at once indulging their old prejudices, and providing for their present conveniencies, by a cool receptable in a sultry climate. And with what art and success they executed the project appears from hence, That no attentive observer ever viewed a regular Avenue of well grown trees intermixing their branches over head, but it presently put him in mind of the long Visto thro' a Gothic Cathedral; or ever entered one of the larger and more elegant Edifices of this kind, but it represented to his imagination <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Avenue of trees. And this alone is that which can be truly called the GOTHIC style of Building.</P>
<P>Under this idea of so extra∣ordinary a species of Architec∣ture, all the irregular trans∣gressions against art, all the monstrous offences against na∣ture, disappear; every thing has its reason, every thing is in order, and an harmonious Whole arises from the studious application of means proper and proportioned to the end. For could the <HI>Arches</HI> be otherwise than <HI>pointed</HI> when the Work∣man was to imitate that curve which branches make by their intersection with one another? Or could the <HI>Columns</HI> be other∣wise than spilt into distinct shafts, when they were to re∣present the Stems of a group of Trees? On the same principle was formed the spreading rami∣fication of the stone-work in the windows, and the stained glass in the interstices; the one being to represent the branches, and the other the leaves of an opening Grove; and both con∣curring to preserve that gloomy light inspiring religious horror. Lastly, we see the reason of their studied aversion to <HI>appa∣rent</HI> solidity in these stupen∣dous masses, deemed so ab∣surd by men accustomed to the <HI>apparent</HI> as well as <HI>real</HI> strength of Grecian Architec∣ture. Had it been only a wan∣ton exercise of the Artist's skill, to shew he could give real strength without the ap∣pearance of any, we might in∣deed admire his superior science, but we must needs condemn his ill judgment. But when one considers, that this surprizing lightness was necessary to com∣plete the execution of his idea of a rural place of worship, one cannot sufficiently admire the ingenuity of the contrivance.</P>
<P>This too will account for
<PB N="269" REF="323"/>
the contrary qualities in what I call the <HI>Saxon Architecture.</HI> These artists copied, as has been said, from the churches in the holy Land, which were built on the models of Grecian architecture; but corrupted by prevailing barbarism; and still further depraved by a religious idea. The first places of Chri∣stian worship were Sepulchres and subterraneous caverns, places, of necessity, low and heavy. When Christianity be∣came the Religion of the State, and sumptuous Temples began to be erected, they yet, in regard to the first pious ages, preserved the massive Style: which was made still more venerable by the <HI>Church of the holy Sepulchre:</HI> This, on a double account being more than ordinary heavy, was for its superior sanctity generally imitated.</P>

This was not only said to deride the indecency and aukward position of the figures, but to insinuate the want of dignity in the subjects. Raphael's pagans, as the devils in Milton, act a nobler part than the Gods and <HI>Saints</HI> of ordinary poets and painters. The cartons at Hampton-Court are talked of by every body; they have been copied, engraved, and criti∣cised; and yet so little studied or considered, that in the noblest of them, of which more, too, has been said than of all the rest, we are as much strangers to St. Paul's audience in the Arcopagus, as to those he preached before at Thessalo∣nica or Beroea.</P>
<P>The story from whence the painter took his subject is this, <Q>“St. Paul came to Athens, was encountered by the Epi∣cureans and Stoics, taken up by them to the court of Areo∣pagus, before which he made his apology; and amongst his converts at this time, were Dionysius, the Areopagite, and a woman named Dama∣ris.”</Q> On this simple plan he exercises his invention. Paul is placed on an eminence in the act of speaking, the audience round him in a circle; and a statue of Mars in the front of his temple denotes the scene of Action.</P>
<P>The first figure has been taken notice of for the force of it's expression. We see all the marks of conviction, and re∣signation to the will of the di∣vine Messenger. But I do not know, that it has been suspect∣ed, that a particular character was here represented. And yet the Platonic countenance, and the female attendant, shew plainly, that the painter design∣ed DIONYSIUS, whom Eccle∣siastical story makes of this sect, and to whom sacred history has given this companion. For the woman is DAMARIS mention∣ed, with him, in the <HI>Acts,</HI> as a joint convert. Either the Ar∣tist mistook his text, and sup∣posed her converted with him at this audience; or, what is more likely, he purposely com∣mitted the indecorum of bring∣ing a woman into the Areopa∣gus, the better to mark out his <HI>Dionysius;</HI> a character of great fame in the Romish Church, from a voluminous mystic im∣postor who has assumed his ti∣tles. Next to this PLATONIST of open visage and extended
<PB N="285" REF="341"/>
arms, is a figure deeply col∣lected within himself, immerged in thought, and ruminating on what he hears. Conformable to his state, are his arms bu∣ried in his garment, and his chin reposing on his bosom; in a word, all his lineaments denote the STOIC; the symbol of which sect was, <HI>Ne te quaesiveris extra.</HI> Adjoining to him is an old man with a squalid beard and habit, leaning on his crouch, and turning his eyes upwards on the Apostle; but with a countenance so sour and <HI>canine,</HI> that one cannot hesi∣tate a moment in pronouncing him a CYNIC. The next that follows, by his elegance of dress, and placid air of raillery and neglect, betrays the EPI∣CUREAN: As the other which stands close by him, with his singer on his lips denoting <HI>si∣lence,</HI> plainly marks out a fol∣lower of PYTHAGORAS. Af∣ter these come a groupe of figures caveling in all the rage of disputation, and criticising the divine Speaker. These plainly design the ACADE∣MICS, the genius of whose school was to debate <HI>de quoli∣bet ente,</HI> and never come to a determination. Without the Circle, and behind the princi∣pal figures, are a number of young faces to denote the scho∣lars and disciples of the seve∣ral sects. These are all before the apostle. Behind him are two other Figures: One re∣garding the Apostle's action, with his face turned upwards; in which the passions of mali∣cious zeal and disappointed rage are so strongly marked that we needed not the <HI>red bonnet</HI> to see he was a Jewish Rabbi. The other is a pagan priest full of anxiety for the danger of the established Re∣ligion.</P>
<P>Thus has this great Master, in order to heighten the dignity of his subject, brought in the heads of every sect of philoso∣phy and religion which were most averse to the principles, and most opposed to the suc∣cess of the Gospel; so that one may truly esteem this carton as the greatest effort of his di∣vine genius.</P>

How∣ever, the Ornament itself pre∣tends to science, and would justify its use by antiquity, tho' it betrays the most miserable ignorance of it. The <HI>Serpent</HI> amongst the ancients, was sa∣cred, and full of venerable my∣steries. Now things do not excite ideas so much according to their own natural impres∣sions, as by fictitious ones, ari∣sing from foreign and acciden∣tal combinations; consequent∣ly the view of this animal raised in <HI>them</HI> nothing of that abhor∣rence which it is wont to do in us; but, on the contrary, very agreeable sensations, cor∣respondent to those foreign asso∣ciations. Hence, and more e∣specially,
<PB N="287" REF="343"/>
because the Serpent was the peculiar <HI>Symbol of health,</HI> it became an extreme proper ornament to the <HI>genial <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooms</HI> of the ancients. In the mean time, we who are strangers to all this superstition, yet make ourselves liable to one much more absurd, which is, idolizing the very <HI>fashions</HI> that arose from it. But if these pretenders to Taste can so widely mistake, it is no wonder that those who pretend to none, I mean the verbal Critics, should a little <HI>hallucinate</HI> in this matter. I remember, when the short La∣tin inscription on Shakespear's monument was first set up, and in the very style of elegant and simple antiquity, the News∣papers were full of these small critics; in which the only ob∣servation that looked like learn∣ing, was founded in this igno∣rance of Taste and Antiquity. One of these Critics objected to the word <HI>Mors</HI> (in the in∣scription) because the Roman writers of the purest times scru∣pled to employ it; but, in its stead, used an improper, that is, a figurative word, or other∣wise a circumlocution. But had he considered that it was their Superstition of <HI>lucky</HI> and <HI>unlucky words</HI> which occasion'd this delicacy, he must have seen that a Christian writer, in a Christian inscription, acted with great judgment in avoiding so senseless an affectation of, what he miscalls, classical expression.</P>

Imperial wonders rais'd on Nations spoil'd,</L>

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was originally writ∣ten in the year 1715, when Mr. Addison intended to pub∣lish his book of medals; it was sometime before he was secretary of State; but not pub∣lished till Mr. Tickell's Edition of his works; at which time the verses on Mr. Craggs, which conclude the poem, were ad∣ded, viz. in 1720. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>EPIST. V.] As the third Epistle treated of the extremes of <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Profusion;</HI> and the fourth took up one parti∣cular branch of the latter, namely, the <HI>vanity of expence</HI> in people of wealth and quality, and was therefore a corollary to the third; so this treats of one circumstance of that Va∣nity, as it appears in the com∣mon collectors of old coins;
<PB N="295" REF="351"/>
and is, therefore, a corollary to the fourth.</P>
<P>VER. 6. <HI>Where mix'd with slaves the groaning Martyr toil'd]</HI> The inattentive reader might wonder how this circumstance came to find a place here. But let him compare it with ℣ 13, 14, and he will see the Rea∣son,
<Q><L><HI>Barbarian</HI> blindness, <HI>Christian</HI> zeal conspire,</L>
<L>And <HI>papal</HI> piety, and <HI>gothic</HI> fire.</L></Q>
For the <HI>Slaves</HI> mentioned above were of the same nation with the <HI>Barbarians</HI> here: and the <HI>Christians</HI> here, the Successors of the <HI>Martyrs</HI> there: Provi∣dence ordaining, that <HI>these</HI> should ruin what <HI>those</HI> were so injuriously employed in rear∣ing: for the poet never loseth sight of his great principle.</P>
<P>VER. 9. <HI>Fanes, which</HI> ad∣miring <HI>Gods with</HI> pride <HI>survey,]</HI> These Gods were the then Ty∣rants of Rome, to whom the Empire raised Temples. The epithet, <HI>admiring,</HI> conveys a strong ridicule; that passion, in the opinion of Philoso∣phy, always conveying the ideas of ignorance and mi∣sery:
<Q><L>Nil admirari prope res est una, Numici,</L>
<L>Solaque quae possit facere &amp; servare beatum.</L></Q>
<HI>Admiration</HI> implying our ignorance of other things; <HI>pride,</HI> our ignorance of ourselves.</P>

VER. 49. <HI>Nor blush, these Studies thy regard engage;]</HI> A senseless affectation which some writers of eminence have be∣trayed; who when fortune, or their talents have raised them to a condition to do without those arts, for which only they gained our esteem, have pretended to think letters below their Character. This false shame M. Voltaire has very well, and with proper indig∣nation, exposed in his ac∣count of Mr. Congreve: <Q>“He had one Defect, which was, his entertaining too mean an Idea of his first Profession, (that of a Wri∣ter) tho' 'twas to this he ow'd his Fame and For∣tune. He spoke of his Works as of Trifles that were beneath him; and hinted to me in our first Conversation, that I should visit him upon no other Foot than that of a Gentleman, who led a Life of plainness and simplicity. I answer'd, that, had he been so unfortunate as to be a mere Gentleman, I should never have come to see him; and I was very much disgust∣ed at so unseasonable a piece of vanity.”</Q> <HI>Letters concern∣ing the English Nation,</HI> xix.</P>
<P>VER. 53. <HI>Oh when shall Bri∣tain,</HI> &amp;c.] A compliment to one of Mr. Addison's papers in
<PB N="299" REF="355"/>
the Spectator- on this subject.</P>
<P>VER. 67. <HI>"Statesman, yet friend to truth,</HI> &amp;c.] It should be remembered that this poem was written to be printed be∣fore Mr. Addison's <HI>discourse on Medals,</HI> in which there is the the following censure of long legends upon coins: <Q>“The first fault I find with a modern legend is its diffusiveness. You have sometimes the whole side of a medal over∣run with it. One would fancy the Author had a De∣sign of being Ciceronian—but it is not only the tedi∣ousness of these inscriptions that I find fault with; sup∣posing them of a moderate length, why must they be in verse? We should be sur∣prized to see the title of a serious book in rhime.”</Q>—Dial. iii.</P>
<P>VER. ult. <HI>And prais'd</HI> un∣envy'd <HI>by the Muse he lov'd.]</HI> It was not likely that men acting in so different spheres as were those of Mr. Craggs and Mr. Pope, should have their friend∣ship disturbed by Envy. We must suppose then that some circumstances in the friendship of Mr. Pope and Mr. Addison are hinted at in this place.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT before the 12<SUP>mo</SUP>. Edition of the Essay on Man, printed at London in 1751.</HEAD>
<P>The Essay on Man, to use the Author's own Words, is a perfect▪ System of Ethics; in which Definition he included▪ Religion: For he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar from that opinion of the noble Writer of the Characteristics, that Morality could long support itself, or have even a real existence, without a reference to the Deity. Hence it is that the first Epistle regards Man with respect to the Lord and Governor of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>auverse; as the second with respect to himself; the third to Society; and the fourth, to Happiness. Having therefore form'd and finished his Essay in this view, he was much mortified whenever▪ he found it considered in any other; or as a part and introduction only to a larger work. As appears from the conclusion of his second Dialogue, intitled <HI>MDCCXXXVIII,</HI> where he makes his impertinent advisor say Alas! alas! pray <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd what you began, And write, n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, more Essays on Man.
<PB N="302" REF="358"/>
which a MS. note of his thus explains: <Q>“The Author un∣doubtedly meant this as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sarcasm on the ignorance of these friends of his, who were daily pestering him for more Essays on Man, as not seeing that the▪ four Epistles he had published entirely compleated that Subject.”</Q> But it must be owned that the Public, by the great and continued demand for his Essay, suffi∣ciently <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reed itself from this imputation of wrong Judg∣ment. And how great and continued that demand has been, appears from the vast variety of pirated and imperfect Editions continually obtruded on the World, ever since the first Publication of the Poem; and which no repeated prosecutions of the Offenders have been able totally to restrain.</P>
<P>These were the considerations which have now induced the Proprietor to give one perfect Edition of the Essay on Man, from Mr. Pope's last corrections and improvements; that the Public may from henceforth be supplied with this Poem alone, in a manner suitable to its dignity, and to the honest intention of its great Author.</P>
<P>Concerning the Universal▪ Prayer, which concludes the Essay, it may be proper to observe that, some passages in the Essay having been unjustly sus∣pected of a tendency towards Fale and Naturalism,
<PB N="303" REF="359"/>
the Author composed that Prayer as the Sum of all, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em that his System was founded in Free-will; and ter∣minated in Piety: That the first Cause was as well the Lord and Governor as the Creator of the Universe▪ and that by Submission to his Will (the great Principle infor∣ced throughout the Essay) was not meant the Suffering ourselves to be carried along with a blind determination; but a religious acquiescence, and confidence full of Hope and Immortality. To give all this the greater Weight and reality, the Poet choose for his Model the Lords Prayer, which of all others best deserves the Title <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to his Paraphrase.</P>
<P>The Reader will excuse my adding a Word concerning the Frontispiece; which as it was designe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and drawn by. W. Pope himself, would be a kind of Curi∣osity, had not the excellence of the thought otherwise recom∣mended it. We see it repersents the Vanily of human Glory, in the false pursuits after Happiness: Where the Ridicule in the Curtain-cobruch, the Death's head crown'd with Laurel, and the several In<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eriptions, have all the force and beauty of one of his best wrote Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>res: Nor is there less expression in the bearded Philosopher sitting by a foun∣tain running to waste, and bloming up Bubbles with a straw from a small portion of Water taken out of it, in a dirty dish▪ admirably representing the vain Business of School Philosophy, that with a little artificial Logic sits inventing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arguments in support of false Science, while the human understanding at large is suffered to lie waste and uncultivated.</P>
