<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Adventures with Aeolus, the Lestrigons, and Circe.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Ulysses</HI> arrives at the Island of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> who gives him prosperous
winds, and incloses the adverse ones in a Bag, which his compa∣nions
untying, they are driven back again, and rejected. Then
they sail to the <HI>Lestrigons,</HI> where they lose eleven ships, and with
one only remaining, proceed to the Island of <HI>Circe. Eurylochus</HI>
is sent first with some Companions, all which, except <HI>Eurylochus,</HI>
are transform'd into Swine. <HI>Ulysses</HI> then undertakes the adventure,
and by the help of <HI>Mercury,</HI> who gives him the herb <HI>Moly,</HI> over∣comes
the Enchantress, and procures the restoration of his men.
After a year's stay with her, he prepares at her instigation for his
voyage to the infernal shades.</P>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T length we reach'd <HI>Aeolia's</HI> sea∣girt
shore,</L>
<L>Where great <HI>Hippotades</HI> the scep∣ter
bore,</L>
<L>A floating Isle! High-rais'd by
toil divine,</L>
<L>Strong walls of brass the rocky coast confine.</L>
<L>Six blooming youths, in private grandeur bred,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>And six fair daughters, grac'd the royal bed:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
These sons their sisters wed, and all remain</L>
<L>Their parent's pride, and pleasure of their reign.</L>
<L>All day they feast, all day the bowls flow round,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="10"/>And joy and music thro' the Isle resound:</L>
<L>At night each pair on splendid carpets lay,</L>
<L>And crown'd with love the pleasures of the day.</L>
<L>This happy port affords our wand'ring fleet</L>
<L>A month's reception, and a safe retreat.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="15"/>Full oft the Monarch urg'd me to relate</L>
<L>The fall of <HI>Ilion,</HI> and the <HI>Grecian</HI> fate;</L>
<L>Full oft I told: at length for parting mov'd;</L>
<L>The King with mighty gifts my suit approv'd.</L>
<L>The adverse winds in leathern bags he brac'd,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="20"/>Compress'd their force, and lock'd each struggling blast:</L>
<L>For him the mighty Sire of Gods assign'd</L>
<L>The tempest's Lord, and tyrant of the wind;</L>
<L>His word alone the list'ning storms obey,</L>
<L>To smooth the deep, or swell the foamy sea.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="25"/>These in my hollow ship the Monarch hung,</L>
<L>Securely fetter'd by a silver thong.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
But <HI>Zephyrus</HI> exempt, with friendly gales</L>
<L>He charg'd to fill, and guide the swelling sails:</L>
<L>Rare gift! but oh, what gift to fools avails!</L>
<L>Nine prosp'rous days we ply'd the lab'ring oar;<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>The tenth presents our welcome native shore:</L>
<L>The hills display the beacon's friendly light,</L>
<L>And rising mountains gain upon our sight.</L>
<L>Then first my eyes, by watchful toils opprest,</L>
<L>Comply'd to take the balmy gifts of rest;<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>Then first my hands did from the rudder part,</L>
<L>(So much the love of home possess'd my heart)</L>
<L>When lo! on board a fond debate arose;</L>
<L>What rare device those vessels might enclose?</L>
<L>What sum, what prize from <HI>Aeolus</HI> I brought?<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Whilst to his neighbour each express'd his thought,</L>
<L>Say whence, ye Gods, contending nations strive</L>
<L>Who most shall please, who most our Hero give?</L>
<L>Long have his coffers groan'd with <HI>Trojan</HI> spoils;</L>
<L>Whilst we, the wretched part'ners of his toils,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>Reproach'd by want, our fruitless labours mourn,</L>
<L>And only rich in barren same return.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Now <HI>Aeolus,</HI> ye see, augments his store:</L>
<L>But come, my friends, these mystick gifts explore.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="50"/>They said: and (oh curs'd fate!) the thongs unbound;</L>
<L>The gushing tempest sweeps the Ocean round;</L>
<L>Snatch'd in the whirl, the hurried navy flew,</L>
<L>The Ocean widen'd, and the shores withdrew.</L>
<L>Rowz'd from my fatal sleep, I long debate</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="55"/>If still to live, or desp'rate plunge to Fate:</L>
<L>Thus doubting, prostrate on the deck I lay,</L>
<L>'Till all the coward thoughts of death gave way.</L>
<L>Mean-while our vessels plough the liquid plain,</L>
<L>And soon the known <HI>Aeolian</HI> coast regain:</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="60"/>Our groans the rocks re-murmur'd to the main.</L>
<L>We leap'd on shore, and with a scanty feast</L>
<L>Our thirst and hunger hastily repress'd;</L>
<L>That done, two chosen heralds strait attend</L>
<L>Our second progress to my royal friend;</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="65"/>And him amidst his jovial sons we found,</L>
<L>The banquet steaming, and the goblets crown'd:</L>
<L>There humbly stopp'd with conscious shame and awe,</L>
<L>Nor nearer than the gate presum'd to draw.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
But soon his sons their well-known guest descry'd,</L>
<L>And starting from their couches loudly cry'd,<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L><HI>Ulysses</HI> here! what Daemon cou'dst thou meet</L>
<L>To thwart thy passage, and repel thy fleet?</L>
<L>Wast thou not furnish'd by our choicest care</L>
<L>For <HI>Greece,</HI> for home, and all thy soul held dear?</L>
<L>Thus they; in silence long my fate I mourn'd,<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>At length these words with accent low return'd.</L>
<L>Me, lock'd in sleep, my faithless crew bere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</L>
<L>Of all the blessings of your god-like gift!</L>
<L>But grant, oh grant our loss we may retrieve:</L>
<L>A favour you, and you alone can give.<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>Thus I with art to move their pity try'd,</L>
<L>And touch'd the Youths; but their stern Sire reply'd,</L>
<L>Vile wretch, begone! this instant I command</L>
<L>Thy fleet accurs'd to leave our hallow'd land.</L>
<L>His baneful suit pollutes these bless'd abodes,<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>Whose fate proclaims him hateful to the Gods.</L>
<L>Thus fierce he said: we sighing went our way,</L>
<L>And with desponding hearts put off to sea.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
The sailors spent with toils their folly mourn,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="90"/>But mourn in vain; no prospect of return.</L>
<L>Six days and nights a doubtful course we steer,</L>
<L>The next proud <HI>Lamos</HI>' stately tow'rs appear,</L>
<L>And <HI>Laestrigonia</HI>'s gates arise distinct in air.</L>
<L>The shepherd quitting here at night the plain,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="95"/>Calls, to succeed his cares, the watchful swain;</L>
<L>But he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear</L>
<L>And adds the herdsman's to the shepherd's care,</L>
<L>So near the pastures, and so short the way,</L>
<L>His double toils may claim a double pay,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="100"/>And joyn the labours of the night and day.</L>
<L>Within a long recess a bay there lies,</L>
<L>Edg'd round with cliffs, high-pointing to the skies;</L>
<L>The jutting shores that swell on either side</L>
<L>Contract its mouth, and break the rushing tide.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="105"/>Our eager sailors seize the fair retreat,</L>
<L>And bound within the port their crowded fleet:</L>
<L>For here retir'd the sinking billows sleep,</L>
<L>And smiling calmness silver'd o'er the deep.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
I only in the bay refus'd to moor,</L>
<L>And fix'd, without, my haulsers to the shore.<MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>From thence we climb'd a points whose airy brow</L>
<L>Commands the prospect of the plains below:</L>
<L>No tracks of beasts, or signs of men we found,</L>
<L>But smoaky volumes rolling from the ground.</L>
<L>Two with our herald thither we command,<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>With speed to learn what men possess'd the land.</L>
<L>They went, and kept the wheel's smooth-beaten road</L>
<L>Which to the city drew the mountain wood;</L>
<L>When lo! they met, beside a crystal spring,</L>
<L>The daughter of <HI>Antiphates</HI> the King;<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>She to <HI>Artacia</HI>'s silver streams came down,</L>
<L>(<HI>Artacia</HI>'s streams alone supply the town:)</L>
<L>The damsel they approach, and ask'd what race</L>
<L>The people were? who monarch of the place?</L>
<L>With joy the Maid th' unwary strangers heard,<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>And shew'd them where the royal dome appear'd.</L>
<L>They went; but as they ent'ring saw the Queen</L>
<L>Of size enormous, and terrific mien,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
(Not yielding to some bulky mountain's height)</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="130"/>A sudden horror struck their aking sight.</L>
<L>Swift at her call her husband scowr'd away</L>
<L>To wreak his hunger on the destin'd prey;</L>
<L>One for his food the raging glutton slew,</L>
<L>But two rush'd out, and to the navy flew.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="135"/>Balk'd of his prey, the yelling monster flies,</L>
<L>And fills the city with his hideous cries;</L>
<L>A ghastly band of Giants hear the roar,</L>
<L>And pouring down the mountains, crowd the shore.</L>
<L>Fragments they rend from off the craggy brow,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="140"/>And dash the ruins on the ships below:</L>
<L>The crackling vessels burst; hoarse groans arise,</L>
<L>And mingled horrors eccho to the skies▪</L>
<L>The men, like fish, they stuck upon the flood,</L>
<L>And cram'd their filthy throats with human food.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="145"/>Whilst thus their fury rages at the bay,</L>
<L>My sword our cables cut, I call'd to weigh;</L>
<L>And charg'd my men, as they from fate wou'd flie,</L>
<L>Each nerve to strain, each bending oar to ply.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
The sailors catch the word, their oars they seize,</L>
<L>And sweep with equal strokes the smoaky seas;<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>Clear of the rocks th'impatient vessel flies;</L>
<L>Whilst in the port each wretch encumber'd dies.</L>
<L>With earnest haste my frighted sailors press,</L>
<L>While kindling transports glow'd at our success;</L>
<L>But the sad fate that did our friends destroy<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>Cool'd ev'ry breast, and damp'd the rising joy.</L>
<L>Now dropp'd our anchors in th' <HI>Aeaean</HI> bay,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Circe</HI> dwelt, the daughter of the Day;</L>
<L>Her mother <HI>Persè,</HI> of old Ocean's strain,</L>
<L>Thus from the Sun descended, and the Main.<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>(From the same lineage stern <HI>Aeaetes</HI> came,</L>
<L>The far-fam'd brother of th' enchantress dame)</L>
<L>Goddess, and Queen, to whom the pow'rs belong</L>
<L>Of dreadful Magic, and commanding Song.</L>
<L>Some God directing, to this peaceful bay<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>Silent we came, and melancholy lay,</L>
<L>Spent and o'erwatch'd. Two days and nights roll'd on,</L>
<L>And now the third succeeding morning shone.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
I climb'd a cliff, with spear and sword in hand,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="170"/>Whose ridge o'erlook'd a shady length of land;</L>
<L>To learn if aught of mortal works appear,</L>
<L>Or chearful voice of mortal strike the ear?</L>
<L>From the high point I mark'd, in distant view,</L>
<L>A stream of curling smoke ascending blue,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="175"/>And spiry tops, the tufted trees above,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Circe's</HI> Palace bosom'd in the grove.</L>
<L>Thither to haste, the region to explore,</L>
<L>Was first my thought: but speeding back to shore</L>
<L>I deem'd it best to visit first my crew,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="180"/>And send out spies the dubious coast to view.</L>
<L>As down the hill I solitary go,</L>
<L>Some pow'r divine who pities human woe</L>
<L>Sent a tall stag, descending from the wood,</L>
<L>To cool his fervor in the crystal flood;</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="185"/>Luxuriant on the wave-worn bank he lay,</L>
<L>Stretch'd forth, and panting in the sunny ray.</L>
<L>I lanc'd my spear, and with a sudden wound</L>
<L>Transpierc'd his back, and fix'd him to the ground.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
He falls, and mourns his fate with human cries:</L>
<L>Thro' the wide wound the vital spirit flies.<MILESTONE N="190"/></L>
<L>I drew, and casting on the river side</L>
<L>The bloody spear, his gather'd feet I ty'd</L>
<L>With twining osiers which the bank supply'd.</L>
<L>An ell in length the pliant wisp I weav'd,</L>
<L>And the huge body on my shoulders heav'd:<MILESTONE N="195"/></L>
<L>Then leaning on the spear with both my hands,</L>
<L>Up-bore my load, and prest the sinking sands</L>
<L>With weighty steps, 'till at the ship I threw</L>
<L>The welcome burden, and bespoke my crew.</L>
<L>Chear up my friends! it is not yet our fate<MILESTONE N="200"/></L>
<L>To glide with ghosts thro' <HI>Pluto's</HI> gloomy gate.</L>
<L>Food in the desart land, behold! is giv'n,</L>
<L>Live, and enjoy the providence of heav'n.</L>
<L>The joyful crew survey his mighty size,</L>
<L>And on the future banquet feast their eyes,<MILESTONE N="205"/></L>
<L>As huge in length extended lay the beast;</L>
<L>Then wash their hands, and hasten to the feast.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
There, 'till the setting sun rowl'd down the light,</L>
<L>They sate indulging in the genial rite.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="210"/>When evening rose, and darkness cover'd o'er</L>
<L>The face of things, we slept along the shore.</L>
<L>But when the rosy morning warm'd the east,</L>
<L>My men I summon'd, and these words addrest.</L>
<L>Followers and friends! attend what I propose:</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="215"/>Ye sad companions of <HI>Ulysses</HI>' woes!</L>
<L>We know not here what land before us lies,</L>
<L>Or to what quarter now we turn our eyes,</L>
<L>Or where the sun shall set, or where shall rise?</L>
<L>Here let us think (if thinking be not vain)</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="220"/>If any counsel, any hope remain.</L>
<L>Alas! from yonder Promontory's brow,</L>
<L>I view'd the coast, a region flat and low;</L>
<L>An Isle incircled with the boundless flood;</L>
<L>A length of thickets, and entangled wood.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="225"/>Some smoak I saw amid the forest rise,</L>
<L>And all around it only seas and skies!</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
With broken hearts my sad companions stood,</L>
<L>Mindful of <HI>Cyclops</HI> and his human food,</L>
<L>And horrid <HI>Lestrygons,</HI> the men of blood.</L>
<L>Presaging tears apace began to rain;<MILESTONE N="230"/></L>
<L>But tears in mortal miseries are vain.</L>
<L>In equal parts I strait divide my band,</L>
<L>And name a chief each party to command;</L>
<L>I led the one, and of the other side</L>
<L>Appointed brave <HI>Eurylochus</HI> the guide.<MILESTONE N="235"/></L>
<L>Then in the brazen helm the lotts we throw,</L>
<L>And fortune casts <HI>Eurylochus</HI> to go:</L>
<L>He march'd, with twice eleven in his train:</L>
<L>Pensive they march, and pensive we remain.</L>
<L>The Palace in a woody vale they found,<MILESTONE N="240"/></L>
<L>High rais'd of stone; a shaded space around:</L>
<L>Where mountain wolves and brindled lions roam,</L>
<L>(By magic tam'd) familiar to the dome.</L>
<L>With gentle blandishment our men they meet,</L>
<L>And wag their tails, and fawning lick their feet.<MILESTONE N="245"/></L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
As from some feast a man returning late,</L>
<L>His faithful dogs all meet him at the gate,</L>
<L>Rejoycing round, some morsel to receive,</L>
<L>(Such as the good man ever us'd to give.)</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="250"/>Domestick thus the griesly beasts drew near;</L>
<L>They gaze with wonder, not unmixt with fear.</L>
<L>Now on the threshold of the dome they stood,</L>
<L>And heard a voice resounding thro' the wood:</L>
<L>Plac'd at her loom within, the Goddess sung;</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="255"/>The vaulted roofs and solid pavement rung.</L>
<L>O'er the fair web the rising figures shine,</L>
<L>Immortal labour! worthy hands divine.</L>
<L><HI>Polites</HI> to the rest the question mov'd,</L>
<L>(A gallant leader, and a man I lov'd.)</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="260"/>What voice celestial, chaunting to the loom</L>
<L>(Or Nymph, or Goddess) ecchos from the room?</L>
<L>Say shall we seek access? With that they call;</L>
<L>And wide unfold the portals of the hall.</L>
<L>The Goddess rising, asks her guests to stay,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="265"/>Who blindly follow where she leads the way.</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
<HI>Eurylochus</HI> alone of all the band,</L>
<L>Suspecting fraud, more prudently remained.</L>
<L>On thrones around, with downy coverings grac'd,</L>
<L>With semblance fair th' unhappy men she plac'd.</L>
<L>Milk newly prest, the sacred flow'r of wheat,<MILESTONE N="270"/></L>
<L>And honey fresh, and <HI>Pramnian</HI> wines the treat:</L>
<L>But venom'd was the bread, and mix'd the bowl,</L>
<L>With drugs of force to darken all the soul:</L>
<L>Soon in the luscious feast themselves they lost,</L>
<L>And drank oblivion of their native coast.<MILESTONE N="275"/></L>
<L>Instant her circling wand the Goddess waves,</L>
<L>To hogs transforms 'em, and the Sty receives.</L>
<L>No more was seen the human form divine,</L>
<L>Head, face and members bristle into swine:</L>
<L>Still curst with sense, their mind remains alone,<MILESTONE N="280"/></L>
<L>And their own voice affrights them when they groan.</L>
<L>Mean-while the Goddess in disdain bestows</L>
<L>The mast and acorn, brutal food! and strows</L>
<L>The fruits of cornel, as their feast, around;</L>
<L>Now prone, and groveling on unsav'ry ground.<MILESTONE N="285"/></L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
<HI>Eurylochus</HI> with pensive steps and slow,</L>
<L>Aghast returns; the messenger of woe,</L>

<L><MILESTONE N="290"/>His swelling heart deny'd the words their way:</L>
<L>But speaking tears the want of words supply,</L>

<L>Access we sought, nor was access deny'd:</L>

<L>I waited long, and ey'd the doors in vain:</L>

and <HI>Charybdis, Cyclops</HI> and <HI>Antiphates?</HI> How are these incredible
stories to be reduc'd into the bounds of probability? 'tis true,
the Marvellous ought to be used in Epic Poetry; but ought it to
transgress all power of belief? <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his <HI>Art of Poetry</HI> lays
down a rule to justifie these incidents; <HI>A Poet,</HI> says that Author,
<HI>ought to prefer things impossible, provided they are probable, before things
possible, that are nevertheless incredible.</HI> Chap. 15. This <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
not without obscurity; but Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI> has explain'd it in his
Annotations upon that Author: A thing may be impossible, and
yet probable: Thus when the Poet introduces a Deity, any inci∣dent
humanly impossible receives a full probability by being ascri∣bed
to the skill and power of a God: 'Tis thus we justifie the
story of the transformation of the ship of the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> into a
rock, and the fleet of <HI>Aeneas</HI> into Sea-nymphs. But such relati∣ons
ought not to be too frequent in a Poem; for it is an esta∣blished
rule, that all incidents which require a divine probability
only, should be so disengaged from the action, that they may be
substracted from, it, without destroying it; for instance, if we
omit the transformation of the ship, the action of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> will
retain the same perfection. And therefore those Episodes which
are necessary, and make essential parts of the Poem, ought to be
grounded upon human probability; now the Episodes of <HI>Circe,
Polypheme,</HI> the <HI>Sirens, &amp;c.</HI> are necessary to the action of the <HI>O∣dyssey:</HI>
But will any man say they are within the bounds of hu∣man
probability? How then shall we solve this difficulty? <HI>Homer</HI>
artificially has brought them within the degrees of it; he makes
<HI>Ulysses</HI> relate them before a credulous and ignorant assembly; he
lets us into the character of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> by saying they were
a very dull nation, in the sixth book,
<Q>Where never Science rear'd her laurel'd head.</Q>
It is thus the Poet gives probability to his fables, by reciting
them to a people who believ'd them, and who thro' a laziness
of life were fond of romantic stories; he adapts himself to his
audience, and yet even here he is not unmindful of his more in∣telligent
Readers; he gives them (observes <HI>Bossu</HI>) in these fables all
the pleasure that can be reap'd from physical or moral truths, dis∣guis'd
under miraculous Allegories, and by this method recon∣ciles
them to poetical probability.</P>
<P>There are several heads to which Probability may be reduced;
either to Divinity, and then nothing is improbable, for every thing
is possible to a Deity; or to our Ideas of things whether true or
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
false: thus in the descent of <HI>Ulysses</HI> into Hell, there is not one word
of probability or historic truth, but if we examine it by the
ideas that the old world entertain'd of Hell, it becomes probable;
or lastly, we may have respect to vulgar opinion or fame; for a
Poet is at liberty to relate a falshood, provided it be commonly
believ'd to be true. We might have recourse to this last rule,
which is likewise laid down by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> to vindicate the <HI>Odyssey,</HI>
if there were occasion for it; for in all ages such fables have found
belief.</P>
<P>I will only add, that <HI>Virgil</HI> has given a sanction to these stories,
by inserting them in his <HI>Aeneis;</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> calls them by the re∣markable
epithet of <HI>specious</HI> miracles.
<Q><L>—Ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat,</L>
<L>Antiphaten, Scyllamque &amp; cum Cyclope Charybdin.</L></Q>
<HI>Longinus</HI> calls these fables Dreams, but adds, that they are the
dreams of <HI>Jupiter;</HI> he likewise blames these Episodes, because in
all of them there is much more fable and narration than action;
Which criticism may perhaps be too severe, if we consider that
past adventures are here brought into present use, and tho' they
be not actions, yet they are the representations of actions, agreea∣ble
to the nature of Episodes.</P>
<P>It may be question'd if <HI>Virgil</HI> is so happy in the choice of the
audience, to which he relates many of these fables; the <HI>Carthagi∣nians</HI>
were not ignorant, like the <HI>Phaeacians:</HI> From whence then
do his stories receive their Probability? It is not so easy to answer
this objection, unless we have recourse to common fame: <HI>Virgil</HI>
was not the Author of them, <HI>Homer</HI> had establish'd them, and
brought them into fame, so that <HI>Virgil</HI> had common opinion to
vindicate him, joyn'd with <HI>Homer's</HI> authority.</P>

<P>VERSE 1. <HI>We reach'd</HI> Aeolia'<HI>s shore.</HI>] It is difficult to di∣stinguish
what is truth from what is fiction in this relation: <HI>Dio∣dorus,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
who was a <HI>Sicilian,</HI> speaks of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> and refers to this pas∣sage:
“This is that <HI>Aeolus,</HI> says he, who entertain'd <HI>Ulysses</HI> in
his voyages: He is reported to have been a pious and just
Prince, and given to hospitality, and therefore <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
as <HI>Homer</HI> expresses it.” But whence has the fable of his being
the Governour of the Winds taken its foundation? <HI>Eustathius</HI> tells
us, that he was a very wise man and one who from long obser∣vation
could foretell what weather was like to follow: others say
he was an Astronomer, and studied chiefly the nature of the Winds;
and as <HI>Atlas</HI> from his knowledge in Astrology was said to sustain
the heavens; so <HI>Aeolus,</HI> from his experience and observation, was fa∣bled
to be the ruler or disposer of the Winds. But what explication
can be given of this bag, in which he is said to bind the Winds?
<HI>Eratosthenes,</HI> continues <HI>Eustathius,</HI> said pleasantly, that we shall then
find the places where <HI>Ulysses</HI> voyag'd, when we have discover'd
the artist, or cobler, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, who sew'd up this bag of the
winds. But the reason of the fiction is suppos'd to be this: <HI>Aeo∣lus</HI>
taught the use and management of sails, and having foretold
<HI>Ulysses</HI> from what quarter the winds would blow, he may be
said to have gather'd them into a kind of enclosure, and retain'd
them as use should require. <HI>Diodorus</HI> explains it a little differently,
<HI>lib.</HI> 5. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; that is, “He taught the use of sails, and having
learn'd from observing the bearing of the smoke and fires (of
those <HI>Vulcanian</HI> Islands) what winds would blow, he usually
foretold them with exactness, and from hence he is fabled to be
the disposer of the winds.” The words of <HI>Varro,</HI> quoted by
<HI>Servius,</HI> are to the same purpose: <HI>Varro autem dicit hunc insularum
regem fuisse, ex quarum nebulis &amp; fumo Vulcaniae insulae praedicens fu∣tura
flabra ventorum, ab imperitis visus est ventos su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> potestate re∣tinere.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Polybius</HI> will not admit that this story of <HI>Aeolus</HI> is entirely
fable; and <HI>Strabo</HI> is of the same opinion, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> was in the
<HI>Sicilian</HI> seas; and that there was such a King as <HI>Aeolus,</HI> he affirms
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
to be truth, but that he met with such adventures is, in the main,
fiction. There may another reason, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, be
given for the fiction of binding up the winds in a bag: they who
practis'd the art of Incantation or charms, made use of the skin
of a Dolphin, and pretended by certain ceremonies to bind or
loose the winds as they pleased; and this practice is a sufficient
ground to build upon in Poetry.</P>
<P>The solution also of <HI>Bochart</HI> is worth our notice: <HI>Homer</HI> bor∣row'd
the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> from the <HI>Phaeacian Aol,</HI> which signifies a
whirlwind or tempest, from whence the <HI>Greeks</HI> form'd their word
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> observing the King of this Island to be
very expert in foretelling the winds, call'd him King <HI>Aolin,</HI> or
King of the winds and storms; from hence <HI>Homer</HI> form'd a pro∣per
name, and call'd him <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It must be confess'd, that
this solution is ingenious, and not without an appearance of pro∣bability.</P>
<P>But having laid together what may be said in vindication of
this story of <HI>Aeolus:</HI> Justice requires that I should not suppress
what has been objected against it by no less a Critic than <HI>Lon∣ginus:</HI>

for it is seen sometimes on the right, at other times on

may be preferable, as it best contributes to raise the wonder and
admiration of the credulous ignorant <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> which was the
sole intention of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P>These Islands were seven in number, (but eleven at this day)
<HI>Strongyle, Hiera, Didyme, Hicesia, Lipara, Erycodes,</HI> and <HI>Phaenicodes,</HI>
all lying in the <HI>Sicilian</HI> seas, as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> testifies; but dif∣fers
in the name of one of the Islands.</P>
<P><HI>Strabo</HI> is of opinion, that the Island call'd by <HI>Homer,</HI> the <HI>Aeo∣lian,</HI>
is <HI>Strongyle;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. “This Island <HI>Stron∣gyle</HI>
abounds with subterraneous fires, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and here <HI>Aeolus</HI> is said
to have reign'd.” <HI>Pliny</HI> agrees with <HI>Strabo, lib.</HI> 3. but <HI>Dacier</HI> un∣derstands
it to be <HI>Lipara,</HI> according to <HI>Virgil, Aen. lib.</HI> 8. but
in reality the seven were all call'd the <HI>Aeolian</HI> Islands.
<Q><L>Insula Sicanium juxta latus, Aeoliamque</L>
<L>Erigitur Liparen, fumantibus ardua saxis.</L></Q>
But why is it fabled to be surrounded with a wall of brass? <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI>
says, that this may proceed from its being almost inacces∣sible;
but this reason is not sufficient to give foundation to such
a fiction. <HI>Dacier</HI> observes that it is thus described, because of the
subterranean fires, which from time to time break out from the
entrails of this Island. <HI>Aristotle</HI> speaking of <HI>Lipara,</HI> which is the
most considerable of the <HI>Aeolian</HI> Islands, thus describes it; “All
night long the Island <HI>Lipara</HI> appears enlighten'd with fires.”
The same relation agrees with <HI>Strongyle,</HI> call'd <HI>Strombolo</HI> at this
day.</P>
<P>I will take the liberty to propose a conjecture, which may per∣haps
not unhappily give a reason of this fiction of the wall of
brass, from this description of <HI>Aristotle:</HI> All night fires appear
(says that Author) from this Island, and these fires falling upon
the seas, might cast a ruddy reflexion round the Island, which to na∣vigators
might look like a wall of brass enclosing it. This is but a

<P>VERSE 5. <HI>Six blooming youths—and six fair daughters.</HI>] <HI>Diodo∣rus
Siculus</HI> mentions the names of the six sons of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> but is
silent concerning his daughters; and therefore others, who can find
mysteries in the plainest description, assure us, that this is not to
be understood historically, but allegorically: <HI>Aeolus</HI> represents the
year, his twelve children are the twelve months, six of which
are female, to denote those six months in which the earth brings
forth her fruits; by his six sons the other months are under∣stood,
in which the seed is sown, or in which the herbs, fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are nourish'd in order to production, these may therefore be call'd
males. But this is to darken an Author into mystery, not to explain
him. <HI>Dacier</HI> gives us another allegorical interpretation: The Poet
makes him the governour of the winds, and gives him twelve
children, these denote the twelve principal winds; half of which
children are males, half females; the males denote the winter winds,
which as it were brood upon the earth, and generate its increase;
the females those warmer seasons of the year, when the more
prolific winds blow, and make the earth teem with fruitfulness:
These children of <HI>Aeolus</HI> are in continual feasts in his Palace; that
is, the winds are continually fed by the exhalations from the earth,
which may be call'd their food or nourishment: The brothers and
sisters inter-marry; this denotes the nature of the winds, which
blow promiscuously, and one wind unites it self with another
from all quarters of the world indifferently: The brothers and
sisters are said to sleep by night together; that is, the winds are
usually still and calm, and as it were rest together, at that season.
But what occasion is there to have recourse to an uncertain Allegory,
when such great names as <HI>Polybius, Strabo,</HI> and <HI>Diodorus</HI> assure us,
that this relation is in part true History; and if there was really
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>

<P>VERSE 94. <HI>The shepherd quitting here at night the plain,</HI> &amp;c.]
This passage has been thought to be very difficult; but <HI>Eustathi∣us</HI>
makes it intelligible: The land of the <HI>Laestrigons</HI> was fruitful,
and fit for pasturage; it was the practice to send the sheep by
day, and the oxen by night; for it was infested by a kind of fly that
was very grievous to the oxen by day, whereas the wool of the sheep
defended them from it; and therefore the shepherds drove their oxen
to pasture by night. If the same shepherd who watched the
sheep by day, could pass the night without sleep, and attend the
oxen, he perform'd a double duty, and consequently merited a
double reward. <HI>Homer</HI> says, that the ways of the night and day
were near to each other, that is, the pastures of the sheep and
oxen, and the ways that led to them were adjacent; for the shep∣herd
that drove his flocks home, (or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as <HI>Homer</HI> expresses
it,) could call to the herdsman, who drove his herds to pasture,
or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and be heard with ease, and therefore the roads must
be adjoining.</P>
<P><HI>Crates</HI> gives us a very different interpretation: He asserts that
<HI>Homer</HI> intended to express the situation of the <HI>Laestrigons,</HI> and
affirms that they lay under the head of the Dragon, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
which <HI>Dacier</HI> renders the tail of the Dragon) accor∣ding
to <HI>Aratus,</HI>
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
which <HI>Tully</HI> thus translates,
<Q><L>Hoc caput hic paullum sese subitoque recondit</L>
<L>Ortus ubi atque obitus partem admiscentur in unam.</L></Q>
If this be true, the Poet intended to express that there was
scarce any night at all among the <HI>Laestrigons,</HI> according to that of
<HI>Manilius,</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
<Q>Vixque ortus, occasus erit—</Q></P>
<P>But how will this agree with the situation of the <HI>Laestrigons,</HI>
who were undoubtedly <HI>Sicilians,</HI> according to the direct affirma∣tion
of <HI>Thucydides, lib.</HI> 6. of his History? Besides, if <HI>Laestrigonia</HI>
lay under the head of the Dragon, <HI>Ulysses</HI> must have spent seven
months, instead of seven days, in sailing from the <HI>Aeolian</HI> Islands
to that country. Neither is there any necessity to have recourse
to this solution; for what signifies the length or shortness of the
day to the double wages of the shepherds, when it was paid to
him who took upon him a double charge of watching the whole
day and night, which comprehends the space of four and twenty
hours; which alone whether the greater part of it was by night
or day, entitled the shepherd to a double reward? I therefore should
rather chuse the former interpretation, with which <HI>Didymus</HI> agrees.
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; that is,
“both the night pastures, and those of the day, are adjacent to
the city.”</P>
<P>It is evident that the <HI>Laestrigons</HI> also inhabited <HI>Formiae,</HI> a city
of <HI>Campania</HI> near <HI>Cajeta:</HI> Thus <HI>Horace, lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Ode</HI> 17.

that is, “<HI>Formiae</HI>
was built by a <HI>Laconian,</HI> call'd also <HI>Hormiae,</HI> from its being an

of the Sun.</P>
<P>This <HI>Aeaea</HI> is a mountain or promontory in <HI>Italy:</HI> perhaps
originally an Island, and still keeping the resemblance of it. Thus

<P>VERSE 218. <HI>Or where the sun shall set, or where shall rise.</HI>]
The interpretations of this passage are various; some, says <HI>Eusta∣thius,</HI>
judge these words not to proceed from the ignorance of <HI>U∣lysses,</HI>
but that they are the language of despair suggested by his
continual calamities: For how could <HI>Ulysses</HI> be ignorant of the
east or west, when he saw the sun rise and set every day? others
understand it to signifie, that he was ignorant of the clime of the
world <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in which this Island lay. <HI>Strabo</HI>
was of opinion, that the appearances of the heavenly bodies, as
the stars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were different in this Island from the position
which he had ever before observ'd in any country, and therefore
he might well confess his ignorance, and express his concern for
his almost desperate condition. He understands by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> all that
region thro' which the Sun passes opposite to the North. It is
true, that the four quarters of the world may be suppos'd to be
here mention'd by <HI>Ulysses,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> may express the southern parts
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
thro' which the sun passes, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the opposite quarter, which
may be said comparatively to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or dark: And then the
rising and setting of the Sun, will undeniably denote the eastern
and western regions. <HI>Spondanus</HI> is of opinion, that <HI>Homer</HI> inten∣ded
to express the four quarters of the world, otherwise the se∣cond
verse is a tautology: <HI>Dacier</HI> calls it an explication of the first
description. And indeed the mind of man is apt to dwell long
upon any object, by which it is deeply affected, as <HI>Ulysses</HI> must
here be supposed to be, and therefore he might enlarge upon the
sentiment advanc'd in the former line. The meaning then will
be this. I know not, says that Heroe, where this Island lies, whe∣ther
east or west, where the Sun rises, or where he sets. I should
therefore understand <HI>Ulysses</HI> to mean, that he knows not how this
Island lies with respect to the rest of the world, and especially to
<HI>Ithaca</HI> his own country. This is evident from his conduct when
he fail'd from <HI>Formiae</HI> the land of the <HI>Lastrigons;</HI> for instead of
making toward the east where <HI>Ithaca</HI> lay, he bore to this Island
of <HI>Circe,</HI> which lies on the west of <HI>Formiae.</HI></P>

and sets the danger they are in full before their eyes, that they may
proceed with due circumspection. We do not find that <HI>Ulysses</HI>

<P>VERSE 236. <HI>Then in the brazen helm the lotts we throw.</HI>]
<HI>Dacier</HI> is of opinion that <HI>Ulysses</HI> cast lotts out of an apprehen∣sion
of being disobey'd if he had given positive commands; his
companions being so greatly discourag'd by the adventures of <HI>Po∣lypheme</HI>
and the <HI>Lastrigons.</HI> It will be a nobler reason, and more
worthy of an Heroe to say, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> was so far from declining
a common danger, that he submits himself to an equal chance
with his companions to undertake it: This expedition appear'd
very hazardous, and if he had directly commanded a select num∣ber
of his men to attempt it, they might have thought he had
exposed them to almost certain destruction; but the contrary
conduct takes away this apprehension, and at the same time shews
the bravery of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who puts himself upon a level with the
meanest of his, soldiers, and is ready to expose his person to an
equality of danger.</P>
<P><HI>Ulysses</HI> divides his men into two bodies; each contains two and

<L>And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors ears:</L>

<L>With words and wicked herbs, from human kind</L>
<L>Had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd.</L>
</LG>
<P>Dryden.</P></Q>
<P>It must be confess'd, that <HI>Irae leonum vincla recusantum,</HI> and the
epithets and short descriptions adapted to the nature of each sa∣vage,
are beautiful additions. <HI>Virgil</HI> likewise differs from <HI>Homer</HI>
in the manner of the description: <HI>Homer</HI> draws the beasts with a
gentleness of nature; <HI>Virgil</HI> paints them with the fierceness of sa∣vages.
The reason of <HI>Homer's</HI> conduct is, because they still retain'd
the sentiments of men, in the forms of beasts, and consequently
their native tenderness.</P>
<P>There is a beautiful moral couch'd under this fable or allegory:
<HI>Homer</HI> intended to teach, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> remarks, that pleasure and
sensuality debase men into beasts. Thus <HI>Socrates</HI> understood it,
as <HI>Xenophon</HI> informs us. Perhaps, adds <HI>Dacier,</HI> by the fawning
wolves and lions that guard the portals of <HI>Circe</HI>'s Palace, the Poet
means to represent the attendants of such houses of debauchery,
which appear gentle and courteous, but are in reality of a brutal
disposition, and more dangerous than lions. But upon what foun∣dation
is this fable built? Many writers inform us, that <HI>Circe</HI> was
a famous Courtezan, and that her beauty drew her admirers as it
were by enchantment. Thus <HI>Horace</HI> writes,
<Q><L>—Circes pocula nosti,</L>
<L>Quae si cum sociis stultus, cupidusque bibisset,</L>
<L>Sub dominâ <HI>Meretrice</HI> fuisset turpis &amp; excors,</L>
<L>Vixisset canis immundus, vel amica luto sus.</L></Q>
It is evident, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> had a very intimate commerce with
<HI>Circe,</HI> for <HI>Hesiod</HI> writes that he had two sons by her, <HI>Agrius</HI> and
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
<HI>Latinus,</HI> who afterwards reign'd in <HI>Tuscany;</HI> other Authors call
them <HI>Nausithous</HI> and <HI>Telegonus.</HI>

<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
<HI>Dionysius Halicarn.</HI> and <HI>Aristotle</HI> mention <HI>Telegonus</HI> as the son of
<HI>Circe</HI> and <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who afterwards slew his father with the bone
of a fish inadvertently. Thus <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q>Telegoni juga Parricidae.</Q>
But then is not this intrigue a breach of Morality, and conjugal
infidelity in that Heroe? I refer the Reader to Note XIV of
the fifth book of the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> I shall only add, that the notions
of Morality are now very different from what they were in for∣mer
ages: Adultery alone was esteem'd criminal, and punish'd
with death by the ancient Heathens: Concubinage was not only
permitted, but thought to be honourable, as appears from the
practice, not only of Heroes, but even of the Pagan Deities; and
consequently this was the vice of the age, not in particular of <HI>U∣lysses.</HI>
But there is a stronger objection against <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and it
may be ask'd, how is he to be vindicated for wasting no less space
than a whole year in dalliance with an harlot? <HI>Penelope</HI> and his
country seem both forgotten, and consequently he appears to ne∣glect
his own re-establishment, the chief design of the <HI>Odyssey:</HI>
What adds some weight to this observation is, that his companions
seem more sensible of his long absence from his country, and re∣gret
it more than that Heroe; for they awake him out of his
dream, and intreat him to depart from the Island: It is there∣fore
necessary to take away this objection: for if it be unanswe∣rable,
<HI>Ulysses</HI> is guilty of all the miseries of his family and coun∣try,
by neglecting to redress them by returning; and therefore
he must cease to be an Heroe, and is no longer to be propos'd
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
as a pattern of Wisdom, and imitation, as he is in the opening
of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> But the stay of <HI>Ulysses</HI> is involuntary, and con∣sequently
irreproachable; he is in the power of a Deity, and
therefore not capable of departing without her permission: this is
evident: for upon the remonstrance made by his companions, he
dares not undertake his voyage without her dismission. His ask∣ing
consent plainly shews that it was not safe, if practicable, to go
away without it; if he had been a free agent, her leave had been
unnecessary: 'tis true, she tells him she will hot detain him any
longer against his inclinations; but this does not imply that his
stay till then had been voluntary, or that he never had intreated
to be dismissed before, but rather intimates the contrary: it only
shews that now at last she is willing he should go away. But
why should <HI>Ulysses</HI> stand in need of being admonish'd by his com∣panions?
does not this imply that he was unmindful of return∣ing?
This is only an evidence that they were desirous to return
as well as he; but he makes a wise use of their impatience,
and takes an occasion from their importunities to press for an
immediate dismission.</P>
<P>In short, I am not pleading for perfection in the character of
<HI>Ulysses:</HI> Human Nature allows it not, and therefore it is not to
be ascribed to it in Poetry. But if <HI>Ulysses</HI> were here guilty, his
character ceases to be of a piece; we no longer interest our selves
in his misfortunes, since they are all owing to his own folly; the
nature of the Poem requires, that he should be continually endeavour∣ing,
to restore his affairs: if then he be here sunk into a lethargy, his
character is at once lost, his calamities are a just punishment, and
the moral of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is destroy'd, which is to shew Wisdom
and Virtue rewarded, and Vice and Folly punished by the death of
the suitors, and re-establishment of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>

It is an undoubted truth, that <HI>Homer</HI> ascribes more power to these
magical drugs and incantations than they have in reality; but we
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
are to remember that he is speaking before a credulous audience,
who readily believed these improbabilities, and at the same time he
very judiciously provides for the satisfaction of his more under∣standing
Readers, by couching an excellent moral under his fa∣bles;
<HI>viz.</HI> that by indulging our appetites we sink below the
dignity of Human Nature, and degenerate into brutality.</P>
<P>I am not in the number of those who believe that there ne∣ver

nature: The story of <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres,</HI> of the Witch of <HI>En∣dor,</HI>
and <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> are undeniable instances of the contrary.
Magic is suppos'd to have been first practis'd in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and to
have spread afterwards among the <HI>Chaldeans:</HI> It is very evident
that <HI>Homer</HI> had been in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> where he might hear an account
of the wonders perform'd by it. <HI>Dacier</HI> is of opinion, that these
deluders, or Magicians, were mimics of the real miracles of <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI>
and that they are describ'd with a wand, in imitation of that
great Prophet.</P>
<P>But if any person thinks that Magic is mere fable, and never
had any existence, yet establish'd fame and common opinion ju∣stifie
a Poet for using it. What has been more ridicul'd than the
winds being inclosed in a bag by <HI>Aeolus,</HI> and committed to <HI>U∣lysses?</HI>
but as absurd as this appears, more countries than <HI>Lap∣land</HI>
pretend to the power of selling a storm or a fair wind at
this day, as is notorious from travellers of credit: and perhaps
a Poet would not even in these ages be thought ridiculous, if speak∣ing

describe the ceremonies she used in the performance of her pre∣tended

is nothing, says that Critic, which gives more life to a discourse,
than the taking away the connections, and conjunctions; when

<Q><L>We went, <HI>Ulysses</HI>—such was thy command</L>
<L>Access we sought—nor was access deny'd:</L>

<L>I only wait behind—of all the train;</L>

These periods thus cut off, and yet pronounc'd with precipitati∣on,
are signs of a lively sorrow; which at the same time hinders,
yet forces him to speak.</P>
<P>Many such sudden transitions are to be found in <HI>Virgil,</HI> of e∣qual
beauty with this of <HI>Homer:</HI>
<Q>Me, me, inquam qui feci, in me convertite tela.</Q>
Here the Poet shews the earnestness of the speaker, who is in so
much haste to speak, that his thoughts run to the end of the
sentence almost before his tongue can begin it. Thus <HI>Achaemeni∣des</HI>
in his flight from the <HI>Cyclops,</HI>
<Q><L>—Per sidera testor,</L>
<L>Per superos, atque hoc caeli spirabile lumen,</L>
<L>Tollite me, Teucri.</L></Q>
Here the Poet makes no connection with the preceding discourse,
but leaves out the <HI>inquit,</HI> to express the precipitation and terror
of <HI>Achaemenides.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66"/>
But our countryman <HI>Spenser</HI> has equall'd if not surpass'd these
great Poets of Antiquity, in painting a figure of Terror in the
ninth <HI>Canto</HI> of the <HI>Fairy Queen,</HI> where Sir <HI>Trevisan</HI> flies from
Despair.
<Q><LG>
<L>He answer'd nought at all: but adding now</L>
<L>Fear to his first amazement, staring wide</L>
<L>With stony eyes, and heartless hollow hue,</L>
<L>Astonish'd stood, as one that had espy'd</L>
<L>Infernal furies, with their chains unty'd;</L>
<L>Him yet again, and yet again bespake</L>
<L>The gentle Knight; who nought to him reply'd,</L>
<L>But trembling every joynt did inly quake,</L>
<L>And falt'ring tongue at last, these words seem'd forth to shake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For God's dear love, Sir Knight, do me not stay,</L>
<L>For lo! he comes, he comes, fast after me,</L>
<L>Eft looking back, would fain have run away.</L>
</LG></Q>
The description sets the figure full before our eyes, he speaks
short, and in broken and interrupted periods, which excellently
represent the agony of his thoughts; and when he is a little more
confirm'd and embolden'd, he proceeds,
<Q><L>And am I now in safety sure, quoth he,</L>
<L>From him who would have forced me to die?</L>
<L>And is the point of Death now turn'd from me?</L>
<L>Then I may tell this hapless History.</L></Q>
We see he breaks out into interrogations, which, as <HI>Longinus</HI> ob∣serves,
give great motion, strength, and action to discourse. If
the Poet had proceeded simply, the expression had not been equal
to the occasion; but by these short questions, he gives strength
to it, and shews the disorder of the speaker, by the sudden starts
and vehemence of the periods. The whole <HI>Canto</HI> of Despair is a
piece of inimitable Poetry; the picture of Sir <HI>Trevisan</HI> has a ge∣neral
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
resemblance to this of <HI>Eurylochus,</HI> and seems to have been
copy'd after it, as will appear upon comparison.</P>

<P>VERSE 313. <HI>With both hands embrac'd my knees</HI>] The
character of <HI>Eurylochus,</HI> who had married <HI>Climene</HI> the sister of <HI>U∣lysses,</HI>
is the character of a brave man, who being witness to the
dreadful fate of his companions is diffident of himself, and judges
that the only way to conquer the danger is to fly from it. To
fear upon such an occasion, observes <HI>Dacier,</HI> is not Cowardice, but
Wisdom. But what is more remarkable in this description, is
the art of <HI>Homer</HI> in inserting the character of a brave man un∣der
so great a consternation, to set off the character of <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
who knows how at once to be bold and wise; for the more ter∣rible
and desperate the adventure is represented by <HI>Eurylochus,</HI>
the greater appears the intrepidity of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who trusting to his▪
own wisdom, and the assistance of the Gods, has the courage to
attempt it. What adds to the merit of the action is, that he un∣dertakes
it solely for his companions, as <HI>Horace</HI> describes him:

his fears. <HI>Dacier</HI> remarks, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> having not seen what is re∣lated
by <HI>Eurylochus,</HI> believes his refusal to return, proceeds from
his faint-heartedness: An instance, adds she, that we frequently
form wrong judgments of mens actions, when we are ignorant
of the motives of them. I confess I am of opinion, that there
is some degree of cowardice in the character of <HI>Eurylochus:</HI> A
man truly brave would not express such confusion and terror in

any extremity; he is not to be inspirited either by <HI>Ulysses,</HI> or the
example of his other companions, as appears from the sequel, in∣somuch
that <HI>Ulysses</HI> threatens to kill him for a coward; this pre∣vails
over his first fears, and he submits to meet a future danger,
merely to avoid one that is present. What makes this observation
more just is, that we never see a brave man drawn by <HI>Homer</HI> or
<HI>Virgil</HI> in such faint colours; but they always discover a presence
of mind upon all emergencies.</P>

This whole passage is to be understood allegorically. <HI>Mercury</HI>
is Reason, he being the God of Science: The plant which he
gives as a preservative against incantation is instruction; the root
of it is black, the flower white and sweet; the root denotes that
the foundation or principles of instruction appear obscure and
bitter, and are distasteful at first, according to that saying of <HI>Plato,
The beginnings of instruction are always accompanied with reluctance
and pain.</HI> The flower of <HI>Moly</HI> is white and sweet; this denotes
that the fruits of instruction are sweet, agreeable, and nourishing.
<HI>Mercury</HI> gives this plant; this intimates, that all instruction is the
gift of Heaven: <HI>Mercury</HI> brings it not with him, but gathers it
from the place where he stands, to shew that Wisdom is not con∣fin'd
to places, but that every where it may be found, if Heaven
vouchsafes to discover it, and we are disposed to receive and fol∣low
it. Thus <HI>Isocrates</HI> understands the Allegory of <HI>Moly;</HI> he
adds, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
The root of <HI>Moly</HI> is bitter, but the flower of
it white as milk, to denote the excellency of instruction, as well
as the pleasure and utility of it in the end. He further illustrates
the Allegory, by adding <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That is, “the fruits of instructi∣on
are not only white as milk, but sweet, tho' they spring

moral of the fable is, that all pleasure is not unlawful, but the

<HI>Ulysses</HI> does not taste till he is fortify'd against it; whereas his com∣panions

<P>VERSE 468. <HI>More young,—more graceful to my eyes.] Homer</HI>

<P>VERSE 485. <HI>As from fresh pastures and the dewy field,</HI> &amp;c.] If

are fill'd with their pasturage, run skipping out to meet them;
the stalls no longer detain them, but running round their dams
they fill the plain with their lowings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>” If a similitude
of this nature were to be introduced into modern Poetry, I am
of opinion it would fall under ridicule for a want of delicacy:
but in reality, images drawn from Nature, and a rural life, have
always a very good effect; in particular, this before us enlivens a
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
melancholy description of sorrows, and so exactly expresses in
every point the joy of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s companions, we see them in the
very description. To judge rightly of comparisons, we are not
to examine if the subject from whence they are deriv'd be great
or little, noble or familiar, but we are principally to consider if
the image produc'd be clear and lively, if the Poet have skill to
dignifie it by Poetical words, and if it perfectly paints the thing
it is intended to represent. This rule fully vindicates <HI>Homer;</HI> tho'
he frequently paints low life, yet he never uses terms which are
not noble; or if he uses humble words or phrases, it is with so
much art, that, as <HI>Dionysius</HI> observes, they become noble and har∣monious:
In short, a Top may be used with propriety and ele∣gance
in a similitude by a <HI>Virgil,</HI> and the Sun may be dishonour'd
by a <HI>Maevius;</HI> a mean thought express'd in noble terms being
more tolerable, than a noble thought disgrac'd by mean expressi∣ons.

There should in all the Episodes of Epic Poetry appear a Con∣venience,

if not a Necessity of every incident; it may therefore
be ask'd what Necessity there is for this descent of <HI>Ulysses</HI> into
hell, to consult the shade of <HI>Tiresias?</HI> Could not <HI>Circe,</HI> who was
a Goddess, discover to him all the future contingencies of his
life? <HI>Eustathius</HI> excellently answers this objection; <HI>Circe</HI> declares
to <HI>Ulysses</HI> the necessity of consulting <HI>Tiresias,</HI> that he may learn
from the mouth of that Prophet, that his death was to be from
the Ocean; she acts thus in order to dispose him to stay with
her, after his return from the regions of the dead: or if she can∣not
persuade him to stay with her, that she may at least secure
him from returning to her rival <HI>Calypso;</HI> she had promis'd him
Immortality, but by this descent, he will learn that it is decreed
that he should receive his death from the Ocean; for he dy'd by
the bone of a sea-fish call'd <HI>Xiphias.</HI> Her love for <HI>Ulysses</HI> indu∣ces
her not to make the discovery her self, for it was evident she
would not find credit, but <HI>Ulysses</HI> would impute it to her love,
and the desire she had to deter him from leaving her Island.
This will appear more probable, if we observe the conduct of
<HI>Circe</HI> in the future parts of the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> she relates to him the
dangers of <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis,</HI> of the Oxen of <HI>Phoebus,</HI> and the
<HI>Sirens;</HI> but says nothing concerning his death: This likewise
gives an air of probability to the relation. The Isle of <HI>Circe</HI> was
adjoining to <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis, &amp;c.</HI> and consequently she may
be suppos'd to be acquainted with those places, and give an ac∣count
of them to <HI>Ulysses</HI> with exactness, but she leaves the decrees
of Heaven and the fate of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to the narration of the Pro∣phet,
it best suiting his character to see into futurity. By the de∣scent
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> into Hell may be signify'd, that a wise man ought
to be ignorant of nothing, that he ought to ascend in thought
into Heaven, and understand the heavenly appearances, and be
acquainted with what is contain'd in the bowels of the earth,
and bring to light the secrets of Nature: That he ought to know
the nature of the Soul, what it suffers, and how it acts after it is
separated from the body.</P>

This expression is fully explain'd, and the notion of the Soul af∣ter
death, which prevail'd among the Ancients, is set in a clear
light, Verse 92, and 122, of the 23d book of the <HI>Iliads,</HI> to which

<HI>Tully</HI> mentions this preheminence of <HI>Tiresias</HI> in his first book of <HI>Di∣vination.</HI>
Perhaps the whole fiction may arise from his great reputa∣tion

memory they might imagine that his soul after death retain'd the
same superiority. <HI>Ovid</HI> in his <HI>Metamorphoses</HI> gives us a very jocu∣lar
reason, for the blindness and prophetic knowledge of <HI>Tiresias,</HI>
from a matrimonial contest between <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno. Cato

suitable to the ideas we have of those infernal regions.
<HI>Ulysses</HI> arrives at this place, where he calls up the shades of the

<P>VERSE 659. <HI>A youth there was,</HI> Elpenor <HI>was he nam'd.] Ho∣mer</HI>
dismisses not the description of this house of Pleasure and
Debauch, without shewing the Moral of his Fable which is the
ill consequences that attend those who indulge themselves in sen∣suality;
this is set forth in the punishment of <HI>Elpenor.</HI> He de∣scribes
him as a person of no worth, to shew that debauchery e∣nervates
our faculties, and renders both the mind and body inca∣pable
of thinking, or acting with greatness and bravery. At the
same time these circumstantial relations are not without a good
effect; for they render the story probable, as if it were spoken
with the veracity of an History, not the liberty of Poetry.</P>

I will conclude this book with a Paragraph from <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s
<HI>Morals:</HI> It is a piece of advice to the Fair Sex, drawn from this
story of <HI>Circe</HI> and <HI>Ulysses.</HI> “They who bait their hooks (says
this Philosopher) with intoxicated drugs may catch fish with
little trouble; but then they prove dangerous to eat, and un∣pleasant
to the taste: Thus women who use arts to ensnare
their admirers, become wives of fools or madmen: They
whom the sorceress <HI>Circe</HI> enchanted, were no better than
brutes; and she used them accordingly, enclosing them in
styes; but she lov'd <HI>Ulysses</HI> entirely, whose prudence avoided
her intoxications, and made his conversation agreeable. Those
women who will not believe that <HI>Pasiphae</HI> was ever enam∣our'd
of a bull, are yet themselves so extravagant, as to abandon
the society of men of sense and temperance, and to betake
themselves to the embraces of brutal and stupid fellows.” <HI>Plut.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Ancients call'd this book <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the book of Necromancy: because
(says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) it contains an interview be∣tween
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> and the shades of the dead.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has not only borrow'd the general
design from <HI>Homer,</HI> but imitated many par∣ticular
incidents: <HI>L'Abbé Fraguier</HI> in the
<HI>Memoirs of Literature</HI> gives his judgment in
favour of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet, and justly ob∣serves,
that the end and design of the journey is more important
in <HI>Virgil</HI> than in <HI>Homer. Ulysses</HI> descends to consult <HI>Tiresias, Aeneas</HI>
his father. <HI>Ulysses</HI> takes a review of the shades of celebrated per∣sons
that preceded his times, or whom he knew at <HI>Troy,</HI> who
have no relation to the story of the <HI>Odyssey: Aeneas</HI> receives the
<PB N="126" REF="126"/>
History of his own posterity; his father instructs him how to manage
the <HI>Italian</HI> war, and how to conclude it with honour; that is,
to lay the foundations of the greatest Empire in the world: and
the Poet by a very happy address takes an opportunity to pay a
noble compliment to his patron <HI>Augustus.</HI> In the <HI>Aeneid</HI>
there is a magnificent description of the descent and entrance
into Hell; and the <HI>diseases, cares,</HI> and <HI>terrors</HI> that <HI>Aeneas</HI>
sees in his journey, are very happily imagin'd, as an introduction
into the regions of Death: whereas in <HI>Homer</HI> there is nothing so
noble, we scarce are able to discover the place where the Poet
lays his scene, or whether <HI>Ulysses</HI> continues below or above the
ground. Instead of a descent into hell, it seems rather a conju∣ring
up, or an evocation of the dead from hell; according to
the words of <HI>Horace,</HI> who undoubtedly had this passage of <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
in his thoughts, <HI>Satyr</HI> 8. <HI>lib.</HI> 1.
<Q><L>—Scalpere terram</L>
<L>Unguibus, &amp; pullam divellere mordicus agnam</L>
<L>Coeperunt; cruor in fossam confusus, ut inde</L>
<L>Manes <HI>elicerent,</HI> animas responsa daturas.</L></Q>
But if it be understood of an evocation only, how shall we ac∣count
for several visions and descriptions in the conclusion of
this book? <HI>Ulysses</HI> fees <HI>Tantalus</HI> in the waters of hell, and <HI>Sisy∣phus</HI>
rowling a stone up an infernal mountain; these <HI>Ulysses</HI> could
not conjure up, and consequently must be suppos'd. to have
enter'd at least the borders of those infernal regions. In short,
<HI>Fraguier</HI> is of opinion, that <HI>Virgil</HI> profited more by the <HI>Frogs</HI>
of <HI>Aristophanes</HI> than by <HI>Homer;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> prefers the
sixth book of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> to the eleventh of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> I think
with very great reason.</P>
<P>I will take this opportunity briefly to mention the original of
all these fictions of infernal Rivers, Judges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> spoken of
by <HI>Homer,</HI> and repeated and enlarged by <HI>Virgil.</HI> They are of
<PB N="127" REF="127"/>
<HI>Aegyptian</HI> extract, as Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> (that faithful traveller, and judi∣cious
Poet) observes, speaking of the Mummies of <HI>Memphis,
p.</HI> 134.</P>
<P>“These ceremonies perform'd, they laid the corps in a
boat to be wafted over <HI>Acherusia,</HI> a lake on the south of
<HI>Memphis,</HI> by one only person, whom they call'd <HI>Charon;</HI>
which gave <HI>Orpheus</HI> the invention of his infernal ferriman;
an ill-favoured slovenly fellow, as <HI>Virgil</HI> describes him, <HI>Aeneid</HI> 6.
About this lake stood the shady temple of <HI>Hecate,</HI> with the ports
of <HI>Cocytus</HI> and <HI>Oblivion,</HI> separated by bars of brass, the original
of like fables. When landed on the other side, the bodies were
brought before certain Judges; if convinc'd of an evil life
they were depriv'd of burial; if otherwise they suffer'd them
to be interr'd”. This explication shews the foundation of those
ancient fables of <HI>Charon, Rhadamanthus, &amp;c.</HI> And also that the
Poets had a regard to truth in their inventions, and grounded
even their fables upon some remarkable customs, which grew ob∣scure
and absurd only because the memory of the customs to
which they allude is lost to posterity.</P>
<P>I will only add from <HI>Dacier,</HI> that this book is an evidence
of the antiquity of the opinion of the Soul's Immortality.
It is upon this that the most ancient of all divinations was
founded, I mean that which was perform'd by the evocation of
the dead: There is a very remarkable instance of this in the holy
Scriptures, in an age not very distant from that of <HI>Homer.
Saul</HI> consults one of these infernal agents to call up <HI>Samuel,</HI> who
appears, or some evil spirit in his form, and predicts his impend∣ing
death and calamities. This is a pregnant instance of the an∣tiquity
of Necromancy, and that it was not of <HI>Homer</HI>'s inventi∣on;
it prevailed long before his days among the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> and
spread over all the oriental world. <HI>Aeschylus</HI> has a Tragedy in∣titled
<HI>Persae,</HI> in which the shade of <HI>Darius</HI> is call'd up, like that
of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and foretells Queen <HI>Atossa</HI> all her misfortunes. Thus it
appears that there was a foundation for what <HI>Homer</HI> writes; he only
embellishes the opinions of Antiquity with the ornaments of Poetry.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="128"/>
I must confess that <HI>Homer</HI> gives a miserable account of a fu∣ture
state; there is not a person describ'd in happiness, unless per∣haps
it be <HI>Tiresias;</HI> the good and the bad seem all in the same
condition: Whereas <HI>Virgil</HI> has an Hell for the wicked, and an
<HI>Elysium</HI> for the just. Tho' perhaps it may be a vindication of <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
to say, that the notions of <HI>Virgil</HI> of a future state were dif∣ferent
from these of <HI>Homer;</HI> according to whom Hell might on∣ly
be a receptacle for the vehicles of the dead, and that while
they were in Hell, their <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or Spirit might be in Heaven, as
appears from what is said of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of <HI>Hercules</HI> in this 11th
book of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>

<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 15. There in a lonely land, and gloomy cells,</L>
<L>The dusky nation of <HI>Cimmeria</HI> dwells.]</L></Q>
It is the opinion of many Commentators, that <HI>Homer</HI> constantly
in these voyages of <HI>Ulysses</HI> makes use of a fabulous Geography;
but perhaps the contrary opinion in many places may be true:
In this passage, <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the space of one day sails from
the Island of <HI>Circe</HI> to the <HI>Cimmerians:</HI> Now it is very evident
from <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> that they inhabited the regions
near the <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> and consequently <HI>Ulysses</HI> could not sail
thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her in the compass of a day; and therefore, says <HI>Strabo,</HI> the
Poet removes not only the <HI>Cimmerians,</HI> but their climate and
darkness, from the northern <HI>Bosphorus</HI> into <HI>Campania</HI> in <HI>I∣taly.</HI></P>
<P>But that there really were a people in <HI>Italy</HI> named <HI>Cimmerians</HI>
is evident from the testimony of many Authors. So <HI>Lyco∣phron</HI>
plainly understands this passage, and relates these adven∣tures
as perform'd in <HI>Italy.</HI> He recapitulates all the voyages of
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> and mentioning the descent into Hell and the <HI>Cimmerians,</HI>
he immediately describes the infernal rivers, and adds, (speaking
of the <HI>Apennine</HI>)
<PB N="129" REF="129"/>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
That is, “From whence all the rivers, and all the fountains
flow thro' the regions of <HI>Italy.</HI>” And these lines of <HI>Tibullus,</HI>
<Q><L>Cimmerion etiam obscuras accessit ad arces,</L>
<L>Queis nunquam candente dies apparuit ortu,</L>
<L>Sive supra terras Phaebus, seu curreret infra.</L></Q>
are understood by all interpreters to denote the <HI>Italian Cim∣merians;</HI>
who dwelt near <HI>Baiae</HI> and the lake <HI>Avernus;</HI> and
therefore <HI>Homer</HI> may be imagin'd not entirely to follow a fabu∣lous
Geography. It is evident from <HI>Herodotus</HI> that these <HI>Cimme∣rians</HI>
were anciently a powerful nation, for passing into <HI>Asia</HI> (says
that Author in his <HI>Clio</HI>) they possess'd themselves of <HI>Sardis,</HI> in the
time of <HI>Ardyes,</HI> the son of <HI>Gyges.</HI> If so, it is possible they might
make several settlements in different parts of the world, and call
those settlements by their original name, <HI>Cimmerians,</HI> and conse∣quently
there might be <HI>Italian,</HI> as well as <HI>Scythian Cimmerians.</HI></P>
<P>It must be allow'd that this horrid region is well chosen, for
the descent into Hell: It is describ'd as a land of obscurity and
horrors, and happily imagin'd to introduce a relation concerning
the realms of death and darkness.</P>

Ancients constantly understood to imply a mixture of honey
and milk; but all writers who succeeded <HI>Homer</HI> as constantly
used it to signify a composition of water mix'd with honey. The
<HI>Latin</HI> Poets have borrow'd their magical rites from <HI>Homer:</HI> Thus

This libation is made to all the departed shades; but to what
purpose (objects <HI>Eustathius</HI>) should these rites be paid to the dead,
when it is evident from the subsequent relation that they were
ignorant of these ceremonies 'till they had tasted the libation? He
answers from the Ancients, that they were merely honorary to
the regents of the dead, <HI>Pluto</HI> and <HI>Proserpina;</HI> and used to obtain
their leave to have an interview with the shades in their domi∣nions.</P>

<DIV2 N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 47. When lo! appear'd along the dusky coasts,</L>
<L>Thin airy shoals of visionary ghosts.]</L></Q>
We are inform'd by <HI>Eustathius,</HI> that the Ancients rejected these six
verses; for say they, these are not the shades of persons newly slain,
but who have long been in these infernal regions: How then can
their wounds be suppos'd still to be visible, especially thro' their
armour, when the Soul was separated from the body? Neither is
this the proper place for their appearance, for the Poet immedi∣ately
subjoins, that the ghost of <HI>Elpenor</HI> was the first that he encoun∣ter'd
in these regions of darkness. But these objections will be ea∣sily
answer'd by having recourse to the notions which the Anci∣ents
entertain'd concerning the dead; we must remember that
<PB N="131" REF="131"/>
they imagin'd that the soul tho' freed from the body had still a
vehicle, exactly resembling the body; as the figure in a mold
retains the resemblance of the mold, when separated from it; the
body is but as a case to this vehicle, and it is in this vehicle that
the wounds are said to be visible; this was suppos'd to be less
gross than the mortal body, and less subtile than the Soul; so that
whatever wounds the outward body receiv'd when living, were
believ'd to affect this inward Substance, and consequently might
be visible after separation.</P>
<P>It is true that the Poet calls the ghost of <HI>Elpenor</HI> the first ghost,
but this means the first whom he knew: <HI>Elpenor</HI> was not yet bu∣ried,
and therefore was not yet receiv'd into the habitation of
the dead, but wanders before the entrance of it. This is the rea∣son
why his shade is said to present it self the foremost; it comes
not up from the realm of death, but descends towards it from
the upper world.</P>
<P>But these shades of the warriors are said still to wear their ar∣mour
in which they were slain, for the Poet adds that it was
stain'd with blood: How is it possible for these ghosts, which
are only a subtle substance, not a gross body, to wear the armour
they wore in the other world? How was it convey'd to them in
these infernal regions? All that occurs to me in answer to this
objection is, that the Poet describes them suitably to the chara∣cters
they bore in life; the warriors on earth are warriors in
Hell; and that he adds these circumstances only to denote the
manner of their death, which was in battle, or by the sword. No
doubt but <HI>Homer</HI> represents a future state according to the no∣tions
which his age entertain'd of it, and this sufficiently justifies
him as a Poet, who is not oblig'd to write severe truths, but ac∣cording
to fame and common opinions.</P>
<P>But to prove these verses genuine, we have the authority of
<HI>Virgil:</HI> he was too sensible of their beauty not to adorn his Poems
with them. <HI>Georg.</HI> 4. 470.

It must be confess'd that the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet omits the circumstance
of the armour in his translation, as being perhaps contrary to the
opinions prevailing in his age; but in the sixth book he describes
his Heroes with arms, horses, and infernal chariots; and in the
story of <HI>Deiphobus</HI> we see his shade retain the wounds in Hell,
which he received at the time of his death in <HI>Troy.</HI>

<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 73. How could thy soul, by realms and seas disjoyn'd,</L>
<L>Out-fly the nimble sail?]</L></Q>
<HI>Eustathius</HI> is of opinion, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> speaks pleasantly to <HI>Elpenor,</HI>
for were his words to be literally translated they would be, <HI>Elpe∣nor,
thou art come hither on foot, sooner than I in a ship.</HI> I suppose
it is the worthless character of <HI>Elpenor</HI> that led that Critic into
this opinion; but I should rather take the sentence to be spoken
seriously, not only because such railleries are an insult upon the
unfortunate, and levities perhaps unworthy of Epic Poetry, but
also from the general conduct of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who at the sight of <HI>Elpe∣nor</HI>
bursts into tears, and compassionates the fate of his friend.
Is there any thing in this that looks like raillery? if there be, we
must confess that <HI>Ulysses</HI> makes a very quick transition from sor∣row
to pleasantry. The other is the more noble sense, and there∣fore
I have follow'd it, and it excellently paints the surprize of
<HI>Ulysses</HI> at the unexpected sight of <HI>Elpenor,</HI> and expresses his won∣der
that the Soul the moment it leaves the body, should reach the
receptacle of departed shades.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="133"/>
But it may be ask'd what connection this story of <HI>Elpenor</HI> has
to the subject of the Poem, and what it contributes to the end
of it? <HI>Bossu</HI> very well answers that the Poet may insert some in∣cidents
that make no part of the fable or action; especially if
they be short, and break not the thread of it: this before us is
only a small part of a large Episode, which the Poet was at li∣berty
to insert or omit, as contributed most to the beauty of his
Poetry: besides, it contains an excellent moral, and shews us the
ill effects of drunkenness and debauchery. The Poet represents
<HI>Elpenor</HI> as a person of a mean character, and punishes his crime
with sudden death, and dishonour.</P>
<P>I will only add that <HI>Virgil</HI> treads in the footsteps of <HI>Homer,</HI>
and <HI>Misenus</HI> in the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> is the <HI>Elpenor</HI> of the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> There is
indeed some difference; <HI>Misenus</HI> suffers for his presumption, <HI>Elpe∣nor</HI>
for his debauchery.</P>

<P>VERSE 105. <HI>All pale ascends my royal mother's shade.</HI>] The
behaviour of <HI>Ulysses</HI> with respect to his mother may appear not
sufficiently tender and affectionate, he refrains all manner of ad∣dress
to her, a conduct which may be censur'd as inconsistent
with filial piety; but <HI>Plutarch</HI> very fully answers this objection.
“It is (says that Author) a remarkable instance of the prudence
of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who descending into the regions of the dead, refus'd
all conference even with his mother, 'till he had obtain'd an
answer from <HI>Tiresias,</HI> concerning the business which induc'd
him to undertake that infernal journey.” A wise man is not
inquisitive about things impertinent; accordingly <HI>Ulysses</HI> first
shews himself a wise man, and then a dutiful son. Besides, it is
very judicious in <HI>Homer</HI> thus to describe <HI>Ulysses:</HI> the whole design
of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is the return of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to his country; this is the
mark at which the Heroe should continually aim, and therefore
it is necessary that all other incidents should be subordinate to this;
<PB N="135" REF="135"/>
and the Poet had been blameable if he had shew'd <HI>Ulysses</HI> enter∣taining

cui non moveat,</HI> says <HI>Scaliger, cum ensem ait &amp; vulnera metuisse?</HI>
What have the dead to fear from a sword, who are beyond the
power of it, by being reduc'd to an incorporeal shadow? But this
description is consistent with the notions of the Ancients concern∣ing
the dead. I have already remark'd, that the shades retain'd a
vehicle, which resembled the body, and was liable to pain as well
as the corporeal substance; if not, to what purpose are the Fu∣ries
describ'd with iron scourges, or the Vultur tearing the liver
of <HI>Tityus?</HI></P>

the ingredients; a privilege not claim'd by any other of the in∣fernal

this about? By shewing that it was decreed by the Gods that
he should be conducted thither by strangers; so that the
<HI>Phaeacians</HI> immediately conclude, that they are the people de∣stin'd
by Heaven to conduct him home; to give this the greater
weight, he puts the speech into the mouth of the Prophet <HI>Tire∣sias,</HI>
and exalts his character in an extraordinary manner, to
strengthen the credit of the prediction: By this method likewise
the Poet interweaves his Episode into the texture and essence of
the Poem, he makes this journey into Hell contribute to the
restoration of his Heroe, and unites the subordinate parts very
happily with the main action,</P>

<P>VERSE 167. <HI>When late stern</HI> Neptune <HI>points the shaft with death.</HI>]
The death of <HI>Ulysses</HI> is related variously, but the following ac∣count
is chiefly credited: <HI>Ulysses</HI> had a son by <HI>Circe</HI> named <HI>Tele∣gonus,</HI>
who being grown to years of maturity, sail'd to <HI>Ithaca</HI> in
search of his father; where seizing some sheep for the use of his
attendants, the shepherds put themselves into a posture to rescue
them; <HI>Ulysses</HI> being advertis'd of it, went with his son <HI>Telemachus</HI>
to repel <HI>Telegonus,</HI> who in defending himself wounded <HI>Ulysses,</HI> not
knowing him to be his father. Thus <HI>Oppian, Hyginus,</HI> and <HI>Dictys</HI>
relate the story. Many Poets have brought this upon the stage,
and <HI>Aristotle</HI> criticizing upon one of these Tragedies gives us the
title of it, which was, <HI>Ulysses wounded.</HI> But if <HI>Ulysses</HI> thus dy'd,
how can <HI>Neptune</HI> be said to <HI>point the shaft with death?</HI> We are
inform'd that the spear with which <HI>Telegonus</HI> gave the wound, was
pointed with the bone of a sea Turtle; so that literally his death
came from the sea, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. and <HI>Neptune</HI> being the God of
the Ocean, his death may without violence be ascrib'd to that
Deity. It is true, some Critics read <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as one word, and
then it will signify that <HI>Ulysses</HI> should escape the dangers of the
sea, and die upon the continent far from it; but the former sense
is most consonant to the tenour of the Poem, thro' which <HI>Nep∣tune</HI>
is constantly represented as an enemy to <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P>I will only add the reason why <HI>Ulysses</HI> is enjoyn'd to offer a
Bull, a Ram, and a Boar to <HI>Neptune:</HI> the Bull represents the
roaring of the sea in storms; the Ram the milder appearance of

it when in tranquility: the Boar was used by the Ancients as an

<P>VERSE 195. <HI>There the wide sea with all his billows raves.</HI>]
If this passage were literally translated, it would run thus: <HI>My
son, how didst thou arrive at this place of darkness, when so many
rivers, and the Ocean lie in the midway?</HI> This (says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) plainly
shews that <HI>Homer</HI> uses a fabulous Geography; for whereas the
places that are mention'd in these voyages of <HI>Ulysses</HI> are really si∣tuated
upon the <HI>Mediterranean, Anticlea</HI> here says that they lie
in the middle of the Ocean. But this is undoubtedly an error:
The whole of the observation depends upon the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; But
why must this denote the <HI>midway</HI> so exactly? Is it not suffi∣cient
to say, that <HI>between Ithaca</HI> and this infernal region,
rivers and the Ocean roul? And that this is the real meaning
is evident from this book, for <HI>Ulysses</HI> sails in the space of one day
from the Island of <HI>Circe</HI> to the place where he descends: How
then could these places where <HI>Ulysses</HI> touches in his voyage lie in
the middle of the Ocean, unless we can suppose he pass'd half
the Ocean in one day? The Poet directly affirms, that he descends
at the extremity of it; but this extremity is no more than one
day's voyage from the Island of <HI>Circe,</HI> and consequently that
Island could not lie in the middle of the Ocean: Therefore
this place is no evidence that <HI>Homer</HI> uses a fabulous Geography.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> very justly observes, that <HI>Homer</HI> judiciously places the
descent into Hell at the extremity of the Ocean: for it is natu∣ral
to imagine, that to be the only passage to it, by which the
Sun and the Stars themselves appear to descend, and sink into

having a very good effect upon his <HI>Phaeacian</HI> audience: By them
he very artfully (and as it seems undesignedly) lets them into the
knowledge of his dignity, and shews the importance of his per∣son;
to induce them to a greater care to conduct him to his
country. The process of the whole story is so artfully carried
on, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> seems only to relate an accidental interview,
while he tacitly recommends himself, and lets them know
the person who asks their assistance is a King. It is observable
that <HI>Anticlea</HI> inverts the order in her answer, and replies last to
the first question. Orators always reserve the strongest argument
for the conclusion, to leave it fresh upon the memory of their
auditors: or rather, the Poet uses this method to introduce the
sorrow of <HI>Ulysses</HI> for the death of his mother more naturally:

feasts; this was to do them honour: and the chief seat was
always reserved for the chief Magistrate. Without this observation,
the lines are unintelligible. It is evident that the words are not
spoken of sacrifices or feasts made to the Gods, but social enter∣ments,
for they are general, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, “all the people

this is not criticizing, but trifling; and ascribing to an Author

There are no fables in the Poets that seem more bold than these
concerning the commerce between women, and river Gods; but
<HI>Eustathius</HI> gives us a probable solution: I will translate him lite∣rally.
It was customary for young Virgins to resort frequently
to rivers to bathe in them; and the Ancients have very well
explain'd these fables about the intercourse between them and
the water Gods: <HI>Receive my Virginity O</HI> Scamander! says a
Lady; but it is very apparent who this <HI>Scamander</HI> was: Her
lover <HI>Cimon</HI> lay conceal'd in the reeds. This was a good excuse
for female frailty, in ages of credulity: for such imaginary in∣tercourse
between the fair Sex and Deities was not only be∣liev'd,
but esteem'd honourable. No doubt the Ladies were
frequently deceiv'd their lovers personated; the Deities, and
<PB N="144" REF="144"/>
they took a <HI>Cimon</HI> to their arms in the disguise of a <HI>Scaman∣der.</HI></P>
<P>It is uncertain where this <HI>Enipeus</HI> flows: <HI>Strabo</HI> (says <HI>Eustathi∣us</HI>)
imagines it to be a river of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> that disembogues
its waters into the <HI>Alphaeus;</HI> for the <HI>Thessalian</HI> river is <HI>Eniseus,</HI> and
not <HI>Enipeus:</HI> This rises from mount <HI>Othrys,</HI> and receives into it
the <HI>Epidanus.</HI> The former seems to be the river intended by <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>
for it takes its source from a village call'd <HI>Salmone;</HI> and
what strengthens this conjecture is the neighbourhood of the O∣cean
(or <HI>Neptune</HI> in this fable) to that river. <HI>Lucian</HI> has made

<P>VERSE 357. <HI>This dares a Seer,</HI> &amp;c.] This story is related
with great obscurity, but we learn from the 15th book that the
name of this Prophet was <HI>Melampus. Iphyclus</HI> was the son of <HI>Dei∣on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI>
and Uncle to <HI>Tyro;</HI> he had seiz'd upon the goods of <HI>Tyro</HI>
the mother of <HI>Neleus,</HI> among which were many beautiful oxen:
these <HI>Neleus</HI> demands, but is unjustly deny'd by <HI>Iphyclus: Neleus</HI>
had a daughter named <HI>Pero,</HI> a great beauty who was courted by
all the neighbouring Princes, but the father refuses her, unless to
the man who recovers these oxen from <HI>Iphyclus: Bias</HI> was in
love with <HI>Pero,</HI> and persuades his brother <HI>Melampus</HI> a Prophet to
undertake the recovery; he attempts it, but being vanquish'd, is
thrown into prison; but at last set at liberty, for telling <HI>Iphyclus,</HI>
who was childless, how to procure issue. <HI>Iphyclus</HI> upon this gave
him the oxen for a reward.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more ridiculous than the explanation of this
story in <HI>Eustathius,</HI> which I will lay before the Reader for his en∣tertainment.
<HI>Melampus,</HI> after he was made a prisoner, was trust∣ed
to the care of a man and a woman; the man used him
with mercy, and the woman with cruelty: One day he heard a
low noise, and a family of <HI>worms</HI> in conference. (He understood
the language of all the animal creation, beasts and reptiles) These
worms were discoursing how they had eaten thro' a great beam
that lay over the head of <HI>Melampus:</HI> He immediately provides for
his own safety, feigns a sickness, and begs to be carried into
the fresh air; The woman and the man immediately comply with
his request; at which instant the beam falling, kills the woman:
An account of this is forthwith carried to <HI>Iphyclus,</HI> who sending
for <HI>Melampus,</HI> asks who he is? He tells him, a Prophet, and that
he came for the Oxen of <HI>Neleus; Iphyclus</HI> commands him to de∣clare
how he may have an heir? <HI>Melampus</HI> kills an Ox, and calls
all the birds of the air to feast on it; they all appear except the
<PB N="147" REF="147"/>
Vultur; he proposes the case to them, but they give no satisfa∣ctory
answer; at last the Vultur appears, and gives <HI>Melampus</HI> a

<P>VERSE 383. <HI>Nine ells aloft they rear'd their head.</HI>] This is

seem utterly incredible that any human creatures could be nine
ells, that is, eleven yards and a quarter in height, at the age of
nine years. But it may vindicate <HI>Homer</HI> as a Poet to say that he only
made use of a fable, that had been transmitted down from the ear∣liest
times of the world, for so early the war between the Gods and
Giants was supposed to be. There might a rational account be
given of these apparent incredibilities; if I might be allow'd to
say what many Authors of great name have conjectur'd, that
these stories are only traditional, and all founded upon the ejecti∣on
of the fall'n Angels from Heaven, and the wars they had
with the good Angels to regain their stations. If this might be
allow'd, we shall then have real Giants, who endeavour'd to take
<PB N="149" REF="149"/>
Heaven by assault; then nothing can be invented by a Poet
so boldly, as to exceed what may justly be believ'd of these
beings: then the stories of heaping mountain upon moun∣tain
will come within the bounds of credibility. But without
having recourse to this solution, <HI>Longinus</HI> brings this passage
as an instance of true sublimity, <HI>Chap.</HI> 6. He is proving that
the Sublime is sometimes found without the pathetic, for some
passions are mean, as fear, sadness, sorrow, and consequently in∣capable
of sublimity; and on the other hand, there are many things
great and sublime, in which there is no passion; of this kind is what
<HI>Homer</HI> says concerning <HI>Otus,</HI> and <HI>Ephialtes,</HI> with so much boldness.
<Q>The Gods they challenge, and affect the skies.</Q>
And what he adds concerning the success of these Giants is still
bolder.

to <HI>Homer</HI>'s in Majesty; in <HI>Homer</HI> we have the height and
breadth of these Giants, and he happily paints the very size of
their limbs in the run of his Poetry; two words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
almost make one verse, designedly chosen to express
their bulk in the turn of the words; but <HI>Virgil</HI> says only <HI>immania

proportion of these Giants, for the body is of a due sym∣metry,
when the thickness is three degrees less than the height
of it: According to this account, these Giants grew one
cubit every year in bulk, and three in height. <HI>Homer</HI> says, that
they fell by the shafts of <HI>Apollo,</HI> that is they dy'd suddenly; but

<L>Than reign the scepter'd Monarch of the dead.]</L></Q>
Nothing sure can give us a more disadvantagious image of a fu∣ture
state, than this speech which <HI>Homer</HI> puts into the mouth of
so great an Heroe as <HI>Achilles:</HI> If the Poet intended to shew the
vanity of that destructive glory which is purchas'd by the sword,
and read a lecture to all the disturbers of mankind, whom we
absurdly honour as Heroes, it must be allow'd he has done it
effectually: If this was not his design, the remark of <HI>Plato</HI> 3
<HI>Repub.</HI> is not without a foundation; he there proscribes this whole
passage as dangerous to morals, and blames the Poet for mak∣ing
<HI>Achilles</HI> say he prefers misery and servitude to all the honours
which the dead are capable of enjoying. For what, says he, can make
death more terrible to young persons? and will it not dispose
them to suffer all calamities to avoid it, deter them from ex∣posing
themselves to danger, even in the defence of their coun∣try,
and teach them, to be cowards and slaves? <HI>Lucian</HI> was of
<PB N="158" REF="158"/>
<HI>Plato's</HI> opinion, for he mentions this passage, and ridicules it in
his dialogues. <HI>Dacier</HI> gives a different turn to it, and endea∣vours
to shew that there is no danger of such consequences, as
<HI>Plato</HI> draws from it: “<HI>Achilles,</HI> adds she, speaks directly contra∣ry
to his declared sentiments and actions, and therefore there
is no danger he should persuade mankind to prefer servitude
before death, when he himself dy'd rather than not revenge
his friend <HI>Patroclus.</HI> Such words which are contradicted both by
the sentiments and actions of him that speaks, have on the contrary
a very good effect.” But I cannot come into her opinion, I will
let <HI>Achilles</HI> answer for himself out of <HI>Lucian:</HI> “In the other world
I was ignorant, says he, of the state of the dead, I had not
experienced the difference between the two states, when I
preferr'd a little empty glory to life.” This is an answer
to what <HI>Dacier</HI> advances, for <HI>Achilles</HI> speaks with experience,
and yet prefers misery and life before glory and death. I know
not how to vindicate <HI>Homer,</HI> unless it be a vindication to say, that
he wrote according to the opinions that anciently prevail'd in the
world; or that like <HI>Hercules,</HI> while the vehicle of <HI>Achilles</HI> is in this
state of horrour, his soul may be in Heaven; especially since he
received divine honours after death, as well as <HI>Hercules. Tull. Nat.

<P>VERSE 626. <HI>The third in wisdom</HI>—] I have not ventu∣red
to render the <HI>Greek</HI> literally, <HI>Ulysses</HI> says that <HI>Neoptolemus</HI> was
so wise, that only he himself and <HI>Nestor</HI> were wiser; a truth that
would appear more graceful, if spoken by any other person than
<HI>Ulysses.</HI> But perhaps the Poet puts these words into his mouth,
only because he is speaking to the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> who loved them∣selves
to boast, and were full of vain-glory; and consequently
they could not think self-praise a crime in <HI>Ulysses;</HI> on the con∣trary,
it could not fail of having a very good effect, as it sets
him off as a person of consummate wisdom.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="159"/>
The Poet excellently sustains the character of <HI>Achilles</HI> in this
interview: In the <HI>Iliad</HI> he is describ'd a dutiful son, and always
expressing a tender affection for his father <HI>Peleus;</HI> in the <HI>Odyssey</HI>
he is drawn in the same soft colours: In the <HI>Iliad</HI> he is repre∣sented
as a man of strong resentment; in the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> he first
imagines that his father suffers, and upon this imagination he im∣mediately
takes fire, and flies into threats and fury.</P>
<P><HI>Dictys, lib. 6.</HI> relates, that <HI>Peleus</HI> was expuls'd from his king∣dom
by <HI>Acastus,</HI> but that <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> the son of <HI>Achilles</HI> afterwards

<P>VERSE 635. <HI>How lost, thro' love,</HI> Eurypylus <HI>was slain.</HI>] It
must be own'd that this passage is very intricate: <HI>Strabo</HI> himself
complains of its obscurity: The Poet (says that Author) rather
proposes an <HI>Aenigma,</HI> than a clear History: for who are these
<HI>Cetaeans,</HI> and what are these <HI>presents of women?</HI> and adds, that
the Grammarians darken, instead of clearing the obscurity. But it
is no difficulty to solve these objections from <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
<P>It is evident from <HI>Strabo</HI> himself, that <HI>Eurypylus</HI> reign'd near
the river <HI>Caicus,</HI> over the <HI>Mysians,</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> confines it to <HI>Teu∣thranes;</HI>
this agrees with what <HI>Ovid</HI> writes, <HI>Metam.</HI> 2.

But what relation has <HI>Caïcus</HI> to the <HI>Cetaeans? Hesychius</HI> informs
us, that they are a people of <HI>Mysia,</HI> so call'd from the river <HI>Ce∣tium,</HI>
which runs thro' their country; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. This river discharges
it self into the <HI>Caïcus,</HI> and consequently the <HI>Cetaeans</HI> were <HI>Mysians,</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="160"/>
over whom <HI>Eurypylus</HI> reign'd. It would be endless to transcribe
the different opinions of writers cited by <HI>Eustathius;</HI> some read
the verse thus:
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
Then the meaning will be, <HI>How they fell far from their wives,
for the sake of a reward;</HI> that is, for their pay from <HI>Hector,</HI> who,
as it appears from the <HI>Iliad,</HI> tax'd the <HI>Trojans</HI> to pay the auxiliaries,
one of whom was <HI>Eurypylus.</HI> Others think the word signifies, <HI>Great
of stature,</HI> and in this sense we find it used in the first line of the
4th <HI>Odyssey.</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
But I have follow'd the first opinion, as appearing most probable
and natural.</P>
<P>But how are we to explain the second objection, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>?
Some (says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) understand the expression as
apply'd to <HI>Neoptolemus,</HI> and not <HI>Eurypylus;</HI> namely, <HI>Eurypylus</HI> and
his soldiers fell by means of the <HI>gifts of women;</HI> that is, <HI>Neopto∣lemus</HI>
was led to the war by the promise of having <HI>Hermione</HI> in
marriage, the daughter of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> which promise occasion'd the
death of <HI>Eurypylus,</HI> by bringing <HI>Neoptolemus</HI> to the siege of <HI>Troy.</HI>
Others understand it to be spoken of a golden vine, sent by <HI>Priam</HI>
to his sister <HI>Astyoche</HI> the mother of <HI>Eurypylus,</HI> to induce her to
persuade her son to undertake this expedition to <HI>Troy,</HI> where he
was slain by the son of <HI>Achilles;</HI> this vine was said to be given
to <HI>Tros</HI> the father of <HI>Priam</HI> by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> as a recompense for his
carrying away his son <HI>Ganymede</HI> to be his cup-bearer; but this is
too much a fable to be follow'd. Others more probably assert,
that <HI>Priam</HI> had promis'd one of his daughters to <HI>Eurypylus,</HI> to
engage his assistance in the war; and this agrees very well with
<HI>Homer's</HI> manner of writing in many places of the <HI>Iliad;</HI> and
there is a great resemblance between <HI>Eurypylus</HI> in the <HI>Odyssey</HI> and

There are two particulars which want explication in these verses:
How did <HI>Thetis</HI> give the law to the contest between <HI>Ajax</HI> and
<HI>Ulysses?</HI> and how could the <HI>Trojans</HI> be made judges to determine
between two <HI>Grecian</HI> Heroes? <HI>Thetis</HI> the mother of <HI>Achilles</HI>
was a Goddess, and out of honour to her, the Chiefs of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> army propos'd the arms of her son as a reward to
the most worthy; and Poetry, to give a magnificence to the
story, introduces the Goddess as acting in person what is done
upon her account. <HI>Thetis</HI> may properly be said to be desi∣rous
that the memory of her son should be honour'd; and <HI>Homer</HI>
to express this desire poetically, tells us it was the act of that God∣dess,
to propose the arms of <HI>Achilles</HI> as a reward to the most
worthy of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Heroes.</P>
<P>The second difficulty is fully explain'd by <HI>Eustathius: Aga∣memnon</HI>
finding it an invidious affair to give the preference
to any one of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Heroes, and being willing to a∣void
the reproach of partiality, commanded the <HI>Trojan</HI> priso∣ners
to be brought before the whole army, and ask'd from
which of the two Heroes <HI>Ajax</HI> or <HI>Ulysses</HI> they had received the
greater detriment, they immediately reply'd from <HI>Ulysses;</HI> thus
the <HI>Trojans</HI> adjudg'd the cause. The Poet adds, that this was done
<PB N="162" REF="162"/>
by <HI>Minerva;</HI> that is, the affair was conducted with wisdom, the
result of which in Poetry, is usually ascrib'd to the Goddess of it;
and no doubt, but the Goddess of Wisdom must always prefer
Wisdom to mere Valour, or an <HI>Ulysses</HI> to an <HI>Ajax.</HI> This deci∣sion,
is related in a very different manner by other Poets; in parti∣cular,
by <HI>Ovid</HI> in his <HI>Metamorphosis;</HI> but <HI>Lucian</HI> in his Dialogues agrees
with <HI>Homer</HI> in every point, very circumstantially; and conse∣quently,

<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 691.—The shade disdains to stay,</L>
<L>In silence turns, and sullen stalks away.]</L></Q>
This silence of <HI>Ajax</HI> was very much admir'd by the Ancients,
and <HI>Longinus</HI> proposes it as an instance of the true sublimity of
thought, which springs from an elevation of soul, and not from
the diction; for a man may be truly sublime without speaking
a word: Thus in the silence of <HI>Ajax</HI> there is something
more noble, than in any thing he could possibly have spoken.
Mons. <HI>Rapin</HI> agrees with <HI>Longinus:</HI> The stubborn, untractable <HI>Ajax,</HI>
(says that Author) could not have made a better return to the
compliments full of submission which were paid him by <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
than by a disdainful and contemptuous silence: <HI>Ajax</HI> has more the
air of grandeur and majesty, when he says nothing, than when the
Poet makes him speak. <HI>Virgil</HI> was sensible of the beauty of it,
and paints <HI>Dido</HI> in the attitude of <HI>Ajax. Fraguier</HI> infinitely pre∣fers
the silence of <HI>Dido</HI> to that of <HI>Ajax;</HI> she was a woman dis∣appointed
in love, and therefore no wonder if she was greatly
passionate, and sunk under the weight of the calamity; but <HI>Ajax</HI>
was a Heroe, and ought to have freed himself by his courage
from such an unworthy degree of resentment. But to me there
appears no weight in this objection: We must remember what
an Heroe <HI>Ajax</HI> is, a sow'r, stubborn, untractable Heroe; and up∣on
all occasions given to taciturnity; this is his universal and
notorious character thro' the whole <HI>Iliad:</HI> The Poet therefore
<PB N="163" REF="163"/>
adapts his description to it, and he is the same <HI>Ajax</HI> in
the <HI>Odyssey</HI> as he was in the <HI>Iliad:</HI> Had this been spoken of
any other Heroe, the criticism had been more just, but in <HI>Ajax</HI>
this stubborn silence is proper and noble.</P>

is fabled to be the son of the earth: He adds, that the fiction of
his covering nine acres, arose from that space of ground which

<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</L></Q>
Here, (says <HI>Dionysius</HI>) we see in the choice and disposition of
the words the fact which they describe; the weight of the
stone, and the striving to heave it up the mountain: To ef∣fect
this, <HI>Homer</HI> clogs the verse with Spondees or long syllables,
and leaves the vowels open, as in <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and in <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
which two words it is impossible to pronounce without hesitati∣on
and difficulty; the very words and syllables are heavy, and as
it were make resistance in the pronunciation, to express the hea∣viness
of the stone, and the difficulty with which it is forced up
the mountain. To give the <HI>English</HI> Reader a faint image of
the beauty of the original in the translation, I have load∣ed
the verse with monosyllables, and these almost all begin with
<HI>Aspirates.</HI>
<Q>Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone.</Q>
<HI>Homer.</HI> is no less happy in describing the rushing down of the
stone from the top of the mountain.
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
Is it not evident, (continues <HI>Dionysius</HI>) that the swiftness of the
verse imitates the celerity of the stone in its descent; nay, that
the verse runs with the greater rapidity? What is the cause of
<PB N="167" REF="167"/>
this? It is because there is not one monosyllable in the line, and
but two dissyllables, ten of the syllables are short, and not one
spondee in it, except one that could not be avoided at the con∣clusion
of it; there is no hiatus or gap between word and word,
no vowels left open to retard the celerity of it: the whole seems
to be but one word, the syllables melt into one another, and; flow
away with the utmost rapidity in a torrent of Dactyls. I was
too sensible of the beauty of this not to endeavour to imitate
it, tho' unsuccessfully: I have therefore thrown it into the swift∣ness
of an <HI>Alexandrine,</HI> to make it of a more proportionable num∣ber

verse is not without obscurity; <HI>Eustathius</HI> gives us several inter∣pretations
of it.
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
The negative <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, by being repeated, seems to be redundant; and
this in a great measure occasions the difficulty; but in the <HI>Greek</HI>
language two negatives more strongly deny; this being premis'd,
we may read the verse as if the former <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> were absent, and
then the meaning will be, “He that made this zone, never made
any thing equal to it:” as if we should say that <HI>Phidias</HI> who made
the statue of <HI>Jupiter</HI> never made any other statue like it; that
is, he employ'd the whole power of his skill upon it. Others un∣derstand
the verse as an execration: <HI>Oh never, never may the hand
that made it, make any thing again so terrible as this Zone!</HI>
And this will give some reason for the repetition of the nega∣tive
particles. <HI>Dacier</HI> approves of this latter explication, and mo∣ralizes
upon it: It proceeds (says she) from a tender sentiment
of humanity in <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who wishes that there may never more be
occasion for such a design, as the artist executed in this belt of
<HI>Hercules;</HI> that there may be no more giants to conquer, no more
monsters to tame, or no more human blood be shed. I wish
that such a pious and well-natur'd explication were to be drawn
from the passage! But how is it possible that the artist who made
this Zone should ever make another, when he had been in his
grave some Centuries? (for such a distance there was between the
days of <HI>Hercules</HI> and <HI>Ulysses;</HI>) and consequently it would be im∣pertinent
to wish it. I have therefore follow'd the former inter∣pretation.

<P>VERSE 769. <HI>Down to these worlds I trod the dismal way.</HI>]
Nothing can be more artfully inserted than the mention of this
descent of <HI>Hercules</HI> into the regions of the dead: <HI>Ulysses</HI> shews by
it at least that it was a vulgar opinion, and consequently within
the degrees of poetical probability; a Poet being at liberty to
follow common fame: In particular, it could not fail of having
a full effect upon his <HI>Phaeacian</HI> auditors, not only as it in some
measure sets him upon a level with <HI>Hercules,</HI> but as it is an ex∣ample
of a like undertaking with this which he has been relating,
and therefore a probable method to gain their belief of it.</P>

<HI>Plutarch</HI> in his life of <HI>Theseus</HI> informs us, that this verse has been
thought not genuine; but added to the <HI>Odyssey</HI> in honour of the
<HI>Athenians</HI> by <HI>Pisistratus.</HI></P>
<P>The Poet shews us that he had still a noble fund of invention,
and had it in his power to open new scenes of wonder and en∣tertainment;
but that this infernal Episode might not be too
long, he shifts the scene: The invention of the Gorgon, which
terrifies him from a longer abode in these realms of dark∣ness
gives a probable reason for his immediate return. <HI>Eusta∣thius</HI>
informs us from <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> that <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Mydian</HI>
writes in his History of Animals, that there really was a creature
in <HI>Libya,</HI> which the <HI>Nomades</HI> call'd a Gorgon; it resembled a wild
Ram, or as some affirm a calf; whose breath was of such
a poisonous nature, as to kill all that approach'd it: In the
same region the <HI>Catolepton</HI> is found, a creature like a bull,
whose eyes are so fix'd in the head as chiefly to look downward;
<PB N="170" REF="170"/>
<HI>Pliny</HI> calls it <HI>Catoblepas, lib.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 21. which is likewise suppos'd to
kill with its eyes: The Gorgon (proceeds <HI>Athenaeus</HI>) has its hair
hanging over its eyes down from the forehead, of such thickness
that it scarce is able to remove it, to guide it self from danger;
but it kills not by its breath, but with emanations darted from
its eyes: The beast was well known in the time of <HI>Marius,</HI> for
certain of his soldiers seeing it, mistook it for a wild sheep, and
pursued it to take it; but the hair being remov'd by the motion
of its flying, it slew all upon whom it look'd: at length the
<HI>Nomades,</HI> who knew the nature of the beast, destroy'd it with darts
at a distance, and carried it to the General <HI>Marius.</HI> Howso∣ever
little truth there be in this story, it is a sufficient ground for
poetical fictions, and all the fables that are ascrib'd to the
Gorgon.</P>

It may not probably be unpleasant to the Reader to observe the
manner how the two great Poets <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> close the scene
of their infernal adventures, by restoring their Heroes to the
earth. <HI>Ulysses</HI> returns by the same way he descended, of which
we have a plain description in the beginning of this book: <HI>Virgil</HI>
takes a different method, he borrows his conclusion from another
part of <HI>Homer;</HI> in which he describes the two gates of sleep;
the one is ivory, the other of horn: Thro' the ivory gate, issue
fashoods, thro' the gate of horn truths: <HI>Virgil</HI> dismisses <HI>Aeneas</HI>
thro' the gate of falshood: Now what is this, but to inform us
that all that he relates is nothing but a dream, and that dream a
falshood? I submit it to the Critics who are more dispos'd to find
fault than I am, to determine whether <HI>Virgil</HI> ought to be censur'd
for such an acknowledgment, or prais'd for his ingenuity?</P>

ON THE
TWELFTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E are now drawing to a conclusion of the
Episodic narration of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> it may
therefore not be unentertaining to speak
something concerning the nature of it, be∣fore
we dismiss it.</P>
<P>There are two ways of relating past sub∣jects;
the one, simply and methodically by
a plain rehearsal, and this is the province of
History; the other artificially, where the
Author makes no appearance in person, but introduces Speakers,
and this is the practice of Epic Poetry. By this method the Poet
brings upon the stage those very persons who perform'd the action
he represents: he makes them speak and act over again the words
and actions they spoke or perform'd before, and in some sort
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
transports his auditors to the time when, and the places where, the
action was done. This method is of great use; it prevents the
Poet from delivering his story in a plain simple way like an Hi∣storian,
it makes the Auditors witnesses of it, and the action
discovers it self. Thus for instance, it is not <HI>Homer</HI> but <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>
who speaks; the Poet is withdrawn, and the Heroe whose
story we hear is as it were rais'd from the grave, and relates it
in person to the audience. <HI>Aristotle</HI> observes, that the Epic Poem
ought to be Dramatic, that is active; <HI>Homer</HI> (says that Author)
ought to be especially commended for being the only Poet who
knew exactly what to do; he speaks little himself, but introduces
some of his persons, a man or a woman, a God or a Goddess;
and this renders his Poem active, or Dramatic. Narration is the
very soul that animates the Poem, it gives an opportunity to the
Poet to adorn it with different Episodes; it has, as it were, the
whole world for its stage, and gives him liberty to search thro'
the Creation for incidents or adventures for the employment
of his Heroes: Thus for instance, he was at liberty to ascribe the
several dangers of <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis,</HI> of <HI>Polypheme</HI> and <HI>Antipha∣tes</HI>
to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> tho' that Heroe had been as unacquainted with those
dangers, as <HI>Aeneas</HI> was in reality with <HI>Dido;</HI> the choice of the
Episodes being not essential, but arbitrary.</P>
<P>In short, it is from this Episodic narration that the Poet could
at all find room to place these Episodes in the <HI>Odyssey. Aristotle,</HI>
I confess, has set no precise limits to the time of the action, but
the Critics in general confine it to one Campaign; at least,
they affirm this to be the most perfect duration, according to the
model of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey.</HI> Now this Episodic narration
gives the Poet an opportunity to relate all that is contain'd in
four books without breaking in upon the time of the action: for
all that we read between the eighth book and the thir∣teenth
comprehends only the space of one evening; namely,
the evening of the thirty third day. The Poet inserts all the
adventures that happen'd to <HI>Ulysses</HI> in almost ten years from his
departure from <HI>Troy,</HI> into the compass of one evening by way of
<PB N="205" REF="206"/>
narration, and so maintains the Unity both of the time and
action.</P>
<P>I speak not of the Narration in general; concerning which the
curious may consult <HI>Bossu,</HI> or <HI>Dryden</HI>'s preface to the translation
of the <HI>Aeneis.</HI></P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 1. <HI>Thus o'er the rolling surge</HI>—] The words in the
original are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which <HI>Strabo</HI> judges to mean
no more than a <HI>part</HI> of the ocean, for if it be otherwise under∣stood
it will be a tautology, and who would write that <HI>he
went out of the ocean into the ocean,</HI> as it must be rende∣red
if <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> be the same with <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the next line,
But it is perhaps better to understand the passage literally and
plainly, only to denote the place from whence <HI>Ulysses</HI> return'd
from his infernal voyage; that is, from the extremity of the O∣cean.
It is usual for the waves of the sea to bear violently
and rapidly upon the same shores, the waters being pent up by
the nearness of the land, and therefore forming a current, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
So that the expression means no more than <HI>Ulysses</HI> surmounted
this current, and then gain'd the wide Ocean.</P>
<P>It is likewise evident from the beginning of this book, that
<HI>Ulysses</HI> pass'd only one night in Hell; for he arriv'd at the <HI>Cimme∣rians</HI>
in one day, saw the visions of Hell in the following night,
and in the space of the next day return'd from the <HI>Cimmerians</HI> in
the evening to <HI>Circe</HI>'s Island, as appears from his going to re∣pose
immediately upon his landing.</P>
<P>It may be further prov'd that this was a Nocturnal interview,
from the nature of the magical incantations which were always
perform'd by night: all sacrifices were offer'd by night to the
infernal powers, the offering it self was black, to represent the
kingdom of darkness: Thus also in other Poets the Moon is said
to turn pale at these magical rites, or as <HI>Virgil</HI> expresses it,
<Q>Carmina vel coelo possunt deducere lunam.</Q>
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
And indeed, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes (from whom this note is chiefly
translated) it would have been absurd to have represented the
realms of darkness survey'd by the light of the day.</P>

<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 3. Here the gay Morn resides in radiant bow'rs,</L>
<L>Here keeps her revels—]</L></Q>
This passage is full of obscurity: For how is it possible
to suppose this Island of <HI>Circe</HI> to be the residence of the
Morning; that is, for the day to rise immediately upon it, when
it is known to lie in a western scituation? Some have imagin'd
that this is spoken solely with respect to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who returning
from the shades, might properly say that he arriv'd at the place
where the day resides, that is to a place enlighten'd by the sun.
Others understand it comparatively, with respect to the <HI>Cim∣merians,</HI>
or rather to the realms of death, which <HI>Homer</HI> places in
the west; with regard to these, <HI>Aeaea</HI> may be said to lie in
the east, or in the poetical language, to be the residence of the
morning. Besides the <HI>Circaean</HI> promontory is of an extraordinary
altitude, and consequently the beams at sun-rising may fall upon
it; nay, it is said to be illustrated by the Sun even by night. Others
have conjectur'd, that what is here said implies no more than
that <HI>Ulysses</HI> landed upon the eastern parts of the Island: And lastly,
others not improbably refer the whole to the word <HI>Ocean</HI> in the
former line, and then the whole passage will be clear, and agree
with the fable of the Sun's rising and setting in the Ocean. This
is what <HI>Eustathius</HI> remarks, who adds, that the Ancients under∣stood
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> not to signify <HI>dances,</HI> but <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>regions of
the morning.</HI> I have translated it in the former sense, according
to the consent of most interpreters: And I am persuaded it is
used to denote the pleasure and gaiety which the Sun restores to
the whole Creation, when dispelling the melancholy darkness, he
restores light and gladness to the earth; which is imag'd to us by
the playing or dancing of the first beams of the Sun; or rather
of <HI>Aurora,</HI> who properly may be said to dance, being a Goddess.
<PB N="207" REF="208"/>
<HI>Dacier</HI> renders <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, dances; but judges that <HI>Homer</HI> here follows
a fabulous Geography, and that as he transported the <HI>Cimmerians</HI>
with all their darkness from the <HI>Bosphorus</HI> to <HI>Campania;</HI> so like∣wise
he now removes <HI>Aeaea</HI> with all its light from <HI>Cholchis</HI> into
<HI>Italy:</HI> and therefore the Poet gives the properties and scituation
to the Island of <HI>Circe,</HI> which are only true of the eastern <HI>Chol∣chis.</HI></P>
<P>It is very evident, (continues she) that <HI>Homer</HI> was perfectly ac∣quainted
with the <HI>Phaenician</HI> story; he tells us that <HI>Elpenor</HI> was
buried upon the promontory on the sea-shores, and that it was
called by his name, <HI>Elpenor.</HI> Now the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> who endea∣vour'd
to naturalize all names in their own language, affirm'd, ac∣cording
to <HI>Bochart,</HI> that this promontory was not so call'd from
<HI>Elpenor,</HI> but from their word <HI>Hilbinor,</HI> which signifies, <HI>ubi albe∣scit

<P>What may seem to confirm <HI>Dacier</HI>'s opinion of the transpor∣tation

<P>VERSE 51. <HI>Next, where the</HI> Sirens <HI>dwell</HI>—] The Critics
have greatly labour'd to explain what was the foundation of this
fiction of the <HI>Sirens.</HI> We are told by some, that the <HI>Sirens</HI> were
Queens of certain small Islands, named <HI>Sirenusae,</HI> that lye near
<HI>Capreae</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and chiefly inhabited the Promontory of <HI>Minerva,</HI>
upon the top of which that Goddess had a Temple, as some af∣firm,
built by <HI>Ulysses,</HI> according to this verse of <HI>Seneca, Epist.</HI> 77.
<Q>Alta procelloso speculatur vertice Pallas.</Q>
Here, there was a renown'd Academy in the reign of these <HI>Sirens,</HI>
famous for Eloquence and the liberal Sciences, which gave occa∣sion
for the invention of this fable of the sweetness of the
voice, and attracting songs of the <HI>Sirens.</HI> But why then are they
fabled to be destroyers, and painted in such dreadful colours?
We are told that at last the Students abus'd their knowledge, to
the colouring of wrong, the corruption of manners, and subversion
of government; that is, in the language of Poetry, they were
feign'd to be transform'd into monsters, and with their music to
have entic'd passengers to their ruin, who there consum'd their pa∣trimonies,
and poison'd their virtues with riot and effeminacy.
The place is now call'd <HI>Massa.</HI> In the days of <HI>Homer</HI> the <HI>Sirens</HI>
were fabled to be two only in number, as appears from his speak∣ing
of them in the dual, as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
their names (adds <HI>Eustathius</HI>) were <HI>Thelxiepaea,</HI> and <HI>Aglaophemè.</HI>
Other writers, in particular <HI>Lycophron,</HI> mention three <HI>Sirens, Ligaea,
Parthenope,</HI> and <HI>Leucosia.</HI> Some are of opinion (continues the
same Author) that they were <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; that is,
“singing women and harlots,” who by the sweetness of their
voices drew the unwary to ruin their health and fortune. O∣thers
tell us of a certain Bay contracted within winding streights
and broken cliffs, which by the singing of the winds, and beat∣ing
of the waters, returns a delightful harmony; that allures the
<PB N="209" REF="210"/>
passenger to approach, who is immediately thrown against the
rocks, and swallow'd up by the violent eddies.</P>
<P>But others understand the whole passage allegorically, or as a
fable containing an excellent moral, to shew that if we suffer
our selves to be too much allur'd by the pleasures of an idle life,
the end will be destruction: thus <HI>Horace</HI> moralizes it;
<Q><L>—Vitanda est improba Siren</L>
<L>Desidia—</L></Q>
But the fable may be apply'd to all pleasures in general, which
if too eagerly pursued betray the uncautious into ruin; while wise
men, like <HI>Ulysses,</HI> making use of their reason stop their ears a∣gainst
their insinuations.</P>

There is a great similitude between this passage and the words of

of an harlot, in the eighth and ninth chapters.</P>
<P><HI>I beheld among the simple ones, I discern'd among the youths, a

undoubtedly a great amplification in the description of <HI>Scylla</HI> and
<HI>Charybdis;</HI> it may not therefore be unnecessary to lay before the
Reader, what is truth and what fiction.</P>
<P><HI>Thucydides, lib.</HI> 4. thus describes it. “This streight is the sea
that flows between <HI>Rhegium</HI> and <HI>Messenè,</HI> where at the nar∣rowest
distance, <HI>Sicily</HI> is divided from the Continent; and this is
that part of the sea which <HI>Ulysses</HI> is said to have pass'd, and 'tis
called <HI>Charybdis:</HI> This sea, by reason of the streights, and the con∣course
of the <HI>Tyrrhene</HI> and <HI>Sicilian</HI> seas breaking violently into it,
and there raising great commotions, is with good reason call'd
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or destructive.” <HI>Charybdis</HI> stands on the coast of <HI>Sicily;
Scylla</HI> on the coast of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> examin'd these rocks and seas with a paricular view
to the descriptions of the Poets: Speaking of <HI>Charybdis,</HI> he writes,
“When the winds begin to ruffle, especially from the south, it
forthwith runs round with violent eddies, so that many vessels
miscarry by it. The stream thro' the streight runs toward the
<HI>Ionian,</HI> and part of it sets into the haven, which turning about,
and meeting with other streams makes so violent an encoun∣ter
that ships are glad to prevent the danger by coming to an
anchor. <HI>Scylla,</HI> adds he, is seated in the midst of a bay,
upon the neck of a narrow mountain, which thrusts it self
into the sea, having at the uppermost end a steep high rock,
so celebrated by the Poets, and hyperbolically describ'd by <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
as unaccessable. The fables are indeed well fitted to the
place, there being divers little sharp rocks at the foot of the
greater: These are the dogs that are said to bark there, the
waters by their repercussion from them make a noise like the
barking of dogs; and the reason why <HI>Scylla</HI> is said to devour the
fishes, as <HI>Homer</HI> expresses it.”
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
<Q><L>When stung with hunger she embroils the flood,</L>
<L>The Sea-dog and the Dolphin are her food;</L>
<L>She makes the huge Leviathan her prey,</L>
<L>And all the monsters of the wat'ry way.</L></Q>
“The reason of this is, because these rocks are frequented by
Lamprons, and greater fishes, that devour the bodies of the
drown'd. But <HI>Scylla</HI> is now without danger, the current not set∣ting
upon it; and I much wonder at the proverb,”
<Q>Incidit in Scyllam qui vult vitare Charybdim,</Q>
“when they stand twelve miles distant: I rather conjecture, adds
he, that there has been more than one <HI>Charybdis,</HI> occasion'd by
the recoiling streams: As one there is between the south end
of this bay of <HI>Scylla,</HI> and the opposite point of <HI>Sicily;</HI> there
the waves justling make a violent eddy, which when the winds
are rough, more than threaten destruction to ships, as I have
heard from the <HI>Scyllians,</HI> when seeking perhaps to avoid the
then more impetuous turning they have been driven by wea∣ther
upon the not far distant <HI>Scylla.</HI>”</P>
<P><HI>Strabo,</HI> (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> remarks) speaking of the <HI>Leontines,</HI> says,
that they were an unhospitable people, <HI>Cyclopeans</HI> and <HI>Laestrigons:</HI>
and adds, that <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis</HI> were inhabited by robbers and
murderers. From the terrible scituation of those rocks, and the
murders and depredation of the robbers these fictions might arise; they
might murder six of the companions of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and throw them
into the sea from <HI>Scylla,</HI> which may be expressed in their being
said to be swallow'd up by that monster.</P>
<P><HI>Bochart</HI> judges the names of <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis</HI> are of <HI>Phae∣acian</HI>
extract, the one deriv'd from <HI>Sool,</HI> which signifies loss and
ruin, the other from <HI>Chorobdam,</HI> which implies the abyss of de∣struction.</P>
<P>It is highly probable that these rocks were more dangerous for∣merly
than at these times, the violence of the waters may not
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
only have enlarg'd their channel by time, but by throwing up
banks and sands, have diverted their course from bearing upon
these rocks with the same violence as anciently; add to this, that
men by art may have contributed to render these seas more
safe, being places of great resort and navigation. Besides, the
unskilfulness of the Ancients in sea affairs, and the smallness and
form of their vessels, might render those seas very dangerous to
them, which are safe to modern navigators.</P>

<P>VERSE 74. <HI>Hence nam'd</HI> Erratic—] It will reconcile the
Reader in some measure to the boldness of these fictions, if he
considers that <HI>Homer,</HI> to render his Poetry more marvellous, joyns
what has been related of the <HI>Symplegades,</HI> to the description of
<HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis:</HI> such a fiction of the justling of these rocks
could not be shocking to the ears of the Ancients, who had be∣fore
heard of the same property in the <HI>Symplegades.</HI> The whole
fable is perhaps grounded upon appearance: Navigators looking
upon these rocks at a distance, might in different views, according
to the position of the ship, sometimes see them in a direct line,
and then they would appear to joyn, and after they had pass'd a
little further they might look upon them obliquely, and then they
would be discover'd to be at some distance; and this might give
occasion to the fable of their meeting and recoiling alternately.
<HI>Strabo</HI> agrees that <HI>Homer</HI> borrow'd his description of <HI>Scylla</HI> and
<HI>Charybdis</HI> from the <HI>Symplegades; Homer</HI> (says he) describes these,
like the <HI>Cyanean</HI> rocks; he continually lays the foundation of his
fables upon some well known History: Thus he feigns these rocks

was criminal to eat of it, nay it was forbid to be offer'd even

<L><HI>Tet safe return'd</HI>—Ulysses <HI>led the way.</HI>]</L></Q>
<HI>Plutarch</HI> excellently explains this passage in his Dessertation, <HI>How
a man may praise himself without blame or envy:</HI> “<HI>Ulysses</HI> (says
that Author) speaks not out of vanity; he saw his companions
terrify'd with the noise, tumult, and smoke of the gulphs of <HI>Scylla</HI>
and <HI>Charybdis;</HI> he therefore to give them courage, reminds them
of his wisdom and valour, which they found had frequently
extricated them from other dangers: This is not vain-glory or
boasting, but the dictate of Wisdom; to infuse courage into
his friends, he engages his virtue, prowess and capacity for
their safety, and shews what confidence they ought to repose
in his conduct.” <HI>Virgil</HI> puts the words of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the mouth
of <HI>Aeneas.</HI>
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>
<Q><L>O socii, neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum,</L>

<L>Experti, revocate animos, maestumque timorem</L>

It must be allow'd, that <HI>Virgil</HI> has improv'd what he borrows;
it tends more to confirm the courage of his friends than what <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
speaks: <HI>Macrobius</HI> is of this opinion, <HI>Saturn. lib.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 11.
<HI>Ulysses</HI> lays before his companions only one instance of his con∣duct
in escaping dangers, <HI>Aeneas</HI> mentions a second: there is some∣thing
more strong in
<Q><L>—Forsan &amp; haec olim meminisse juvabit,</L></Q>
than in <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; not only as it gives them hope
to escape, but as it is an assurance that this very danger shall be
a pleasure, and add to their future happiness: it is not only an
argument of resolution but consolation. <HI>Scaliger</HI> agrees with <HI>Ma∣crobius,

<P>VERSE 241.—<HI>The smoking billows roll'd.</HI>] What is to be
understood by the smoke of the billows? Does the Poet mean a
real fire arising from the rocks? Most of the Critics have judg'd
that the rock vomited out flames; for <HI>Homer</HI> mentions in the be∣ginning
of this book.
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>
I have taken the liberty to translate both these passages in a diffe∣rent
sense; by the smoke I understand the mists that arise from
the commotion and dashing of the waters, and by the <HI>storms of
fire,</HI> (as <HI>Homer</HI> expresses it) the reflections the water casts in
such agitations that resemble flames; thus in storms literally
<Q><L>—Ardescunt ignibus undae.</L></Q>
<HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis</HI> are in a continual storm, and may there∣fore
be said to emit flames. I have soften'd the expression in
the translation by inserting the word <HI>seem.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ulysses</HI> continues upon one of these rocks several hours; that
is, from morning till noon, as appears from the conclusion of
this book; for leaping from the float, he laid hold upon a fig-tree
that grew upon <HI>Charybdis;</HI> but both the fig-tree and <HI>Ulysses</HI>
must have been consum'd, if the rock had really emitted flames.</P>

<P><Q><L>VERSE 268.—xsForgetful of the voice divine,</L>

This seemingly small circumstance is not without a good effect:
It shews that <HI>Ulysses,</HI> even by the injunctions of a Goddess, cannot
lay aside the Heroe. It is not out of a particular care of his own
safety that he arms himself, for he takes his stand in the most
open and dangerous part of the vessel. It is an evidence likewise
that the death of his companions is not owing to a want of
his protection; for it is plain that, as <HI>Horace</HI> expresses it,
<Q><L>Dum sibi, dum sociis reditum parat, aspera multa</L>
<L>Pertulit—</L></Q>
By this conduct we see likewise, that all the parts of the <HI>Odyssey</HI>
are consistent, and that the same care of his companions, which
<HI>Homer</HI> ascribes to <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the first lines of it, is visible thro' the

This conduct may seem somewhat extraordinary; the compani∣ons

themselves with a due refreshment, and then find leisure to
mourn; whereas a true sorrow would more probably have taken
away all appetite. But the practice of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s friends is conso∣nant
to the customs of Antiquity: It was esteem'd a propha∣nation
and a piece of ingratitude to the Gods, to mix sorrow
with their entertainments: The hours of repast were allotted to
joy, and thanksgiving to heaven for the bounty it gave to man
by sustenance. Besides, this practice bears a secret instruction,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the principal care is owing to the living; and when
that is over, the dead are not to be neglected. <HI>Aeneas</HI> and

more rational than to suppose him withdrawn to offer up his de∣votions
to the Gods? His affairs are brought to the utmost ex∣tremity,
his companions murmur, and hunger oppresses. The
Poet therefore, to bring about the crime of these offenders by
probable methods, represents <HI>Ulysses</HI> retiring to supplicate the Gods;
a conduct which they ought to have imitated: Besides, there is
a poetical justice observ'd in the whole relation, and by the piety

This is a very bold fiction, for how can the Sun be imagin'd to
illuminate the regions of the dead; that is, to shine within the
earth, for there the realm of <HI>Pluto</HI> is plac'd by <HI>Homer?</HI> I am per∣suaded
the meaning is only that he would no more rise, but
leave the earth and heavens in perpetual darkness. <HI>Erebus</HI> is pla∣ced
in the west, where the Sun sets, and consequently when he
disappears he may be said to be sunk into the realms of dark∣ness
or <HI>Erebus.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps the whole fiction might be founded really upon the
observation of some unusual darkness of the Sun, either from a
total eclipse or other causes, which happen'd at the time when
some remarkable crime was committed, and gave the Poets liberty
to feign that the Sun withdrew his light from the view of it.
Thus at the death of <HI>Caesar</HI> the globe of the Sun was obscured,
or gave but a weak light, (says <HI>Plutarch</HI>) a whole year; and
<HI>Plin. lib.</HI> 2. 80. <HI>fiunt prodigiosi &amp; longiores solis defectus, totius

He adds, that the terrors of a guilty conscience drove
the companions of <HI>Ulysses</HI> into these imaginations: Guilt is able to
create a phantom in a moment, so that these appearances were no∣thing
but the illusions of a disturb'd imagination. He cites a pas∣sage
from the <HI>Calliope</HI> of <HI>Herodotus</HI> to vindicate <HI>Homer: Artayctes</HI>
a <HI>Persian</HI> General had plunder'd a temple in which was the tomb
of <HI>Protesilaus,</HI> where great riches were deposited; afterwards he
<PB N="227" REF="228"/>
was besieg'd in <HI>Sestus,</HI> and taken prisoner: One day, one of his
guards was boiling salted fishes (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) and they leap'd, and
moved as if they had been alive, and newly taken out of the
water: Divers persons crouded about the place, and wonder'd at
the miracle; when <HI>Artayctes</HI> said, <HI>Friends, you are not at all con∣cern'd
in this miracle:</HI> Protesilaus, <HI>tho' dead, admonishes me by this
sign, that the Gods have given him power to revenge the injury I of∣fer'd
to his monument in</HI> Eleus. But this is justifying one fable
by another; and this looks also like the effects of a guilty con∣science.</P>
<P>This is not among the passages condemn'd by <HI>Longinus;</HI> and
indeed it is no way blameable, if we consider the times when it
was spoken, and the persons to whom it is related: I mean <HI>Phae∣acians,</HI>
who were delighted with such wonders. What was said ju∣diciously
by a great Writer, may very properly be apply'd to these
people, <HI>Credo, quia impossibile est.</HI> But we need not have recourse

us an account of all the abstruse arts, such as Necromancy, Witch∣craft,
and natural portents; here he relates a prodigy, the be∣lief
of which universally prevailed among the Ancients; Let any
one read <HI>Livy,</HI> and he will find innumerable instances of prodi∣gies,
equally incredible as this, which were related by the wise,
and believed at least by the vulgar. Thus we read of speaking
Oxen, the sweating of the statues of the Gods, in the best <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Histories. If such wonders might have a place in History,
they may certainly be allow'd room in Poetry, whose province is
fable: it signifies nothing whether a story be true or false, pro∣vided

<HI>Longinus</HI> brings this passage as an instance of the decay of <HI>Homer</HI>'s
Genius, and his launching out into extravagant Fables. I wonder
<HI>Eustathius</HI> should be silent about this Objection; but <HI>Dacier</HI> en∣deavours
to vindicate <HI>Homer,</HI> from a similar place in the <HI>Acts of
the Apostles, Cap.</HI> 27. ver. 33. where Saint <HI>Paul</HI> says to the Sailors,
<HI>this is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried, and continued fasting,
having taken nothing.</HI> Now it the Sailors in the <HI>Acts</HI> could fast
fourteen days, why might not <HI>Ulysses</HI> fast ten? But this place
by no means comes up to the point. The words are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
that is, expecting the
fourteenth day, (which is to-day) you continue without eating;
so the meaning is, they had taken no food all that day; the
danger was so great that they had no leisure to think upon hun∣ger:
This is the literal construction of the Words, and implies
<PB N="232" REF="233"/>
that out of expectation of the fourteenth Day, (which they
look'd upon as a critical time when their danger would be at
the highest) they had forgot to take their usual repast; and
not, that they had fasted fourteen Days. But if any Person
thinks that the fasting is to be apply'd to the whole fourteen
Days, it must be in that latitude wherein Interpreters expound
<HI>Hesiod,</HI>
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</L></Q>
which signifies not that they eat no Meat at all, but that they
had not leisure thro' their danger to observe the usual and sta∣ted
hours of repast: They eat in their Arms, with their Hands
foul'd with Blood. But I take the former sense to be the better.
Besides, it is impossible to make this place of any service to <HI>Ho∣mer;</HI>
for if these Men continued so long fasting, it was a mira∣culous
fast; and how can this be apply'd to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who is not
imagin'd to owe his power of fasting to any supernatural assist∣ance?
But it is almost a demonstration that the sailors in the
<HI>Acts</HI> eat during the tempest: Why should they abstain? It was
not for want of food; for at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s injunction they take some
sustenance: Now it is absurd to imagine a miracle to be per∣form'd,
when common and easy means were at hand to make
such a supernatural act unnecessary. If they had been without
food, then indeed a miracle might have been suppos'd to supply
it. If they had dy'd thro' fasting, when meat was at hand, they
would have been guilty of starving themselves. If therefore
we suppose a miracle, we must suppose it to be wrought, to pre∣vent
men from being guilty of wilful self-murder, which is an
absurdity.</P>
<P>Besides, the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is used to denote a person who takes
no food for the space of one day only, as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies a
person who eats but one meal in the compass of one day; this
therefore is an evidence, that the sailors in the <HI>Acts</HI> had not been
without sustenance fourteen days.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="234"/>
In short, I am not in the number of those who think <HI>Homer</HI>
has no faults; and unless we imagine <HI>Ulysses</HI> to have fasted ten
days by the assistance of the Gods, this passage must be allow'd
to be extravagant: 'Tis true, <HI>Homer</HI> says, the Gods guided him to
the <HI>Ogygian</HI> shores; but he says not a word to soften the incredi∣bility
of the fasting of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> thro' any assistance of the Gods.
I am therefore inclin'd to subscribe to the opinion of <HI>Longinus,</HI>
that this relation is faulty; but say with <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q><L>—Non ego paucis</L>
<L>Offendar maculis, quos aut incuria fudit,</L>
<L>Aut humana parum cavit natura.</L></Q></P>

<P>Ulysses <HI>takes his leave of</HI> Alcinous <HI>and</HI> Arete, <HI>and embarks in the
evening. Next morning the ship arrives at</HI> Ithaca; <HI>where the sail∣ors,

<HI>by reason of a mist which</HI> Pallas <HI>had cast round him. He breaks
into loud lamentations; 'till the Goddess appearing to him in the

particular places. He then tells a feign'd story of his adventures, upon
which she manifests her self, and they consult together of the mea∣sures

disguise his person the more effectually, she changes him into the fi∣gure

by the bard, he means <HI>Demodocus.</HI></P>
<P>The same Critic further remarks, that <HI>Homer</HI> judiciously short∣ens
every circumstance before he comes to the dismission of <HI>U∣lysses:</HI>
Thus he omits the description of the sacrifice, and the sub∣ject
of the song of <HI>Demodocus;</HI> these are circumstances that at best
would be but useless ornaments, and ill agree with the impati∣ence
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to begin his voyage toward his country. These
therefore the Poet briefly dispatches.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 39. <HI>As weary plowman,</HI> &amp;c.] The simile which
<HI>Homer</HI> chuses is drawn from low life, but very happily sets off the
impatience of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> It is familiar, but expressive. <HI>Horace</HI> was
not of the judgment of those who thought it mean, for he uses
it in his Epistles.

It was very necessary to dwell upon this impatience of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to
return; it would have been absurd to have represented him cool,
or even moderately warm upon this occasion; he had refused
immortality thro' the love of his country; it is now in his power
to return to it: he ought therefore consistently with his former
<PB N="269" REF="267"/>
character to be drawn with the utmost earnestness of soul, and
every moment must appear tedious that keeps him from it; it
shews therefore the judgment of <HI>Homer</HI> to describe him in this
manner, and not to pass it over cursorily, but force it upon the
notice of the Reader, by insisting upon it somewhat largely, and
illustrating it by a proper similitude, to fix it more strongly upon
our memory.</P>

It may be ask'd why <HI>Ulysses</HI> addresses his words to the Queen ra∣ther
than the King; The reason is, because she was his patroness,
and had first receiv'd him with hospitality, as appears from the
seventh book of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ulysses</HI> makes a libation to the Gods, and presents the bowl to
the Queen: This was the pious practice of Antiquity upon all
solemn occasions: <HI>Ulysses</HI> here does it, because he is to undertake
a voyage, and it implies a prayer for the prosperity of it. The
reason why he presents the bowl to the Queen is, that she may
first drink out of it, for so <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> properly and originally sig∣nifies,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, says <HI>Eustathius. Propino</HI> is
used differently by the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>

<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 98. As fiery coursers in the rapid race</L>
<L>Toss their high heads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q>
The Poet introduces two similitudes to represent the sailing of
the <HI>Phaeacian</HI> vessel: The former describes the motion of it, as it
bounds and rises over the waves, like horses tossing their heads in
a race; and also the steddiness of it, in that it sails with as much
firmness over the billows, as horses tread upon the ground.
The latter comparison is solely to shew the swiftness of the
vessel.</P>
<P>The word in the original is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; an instance, that four
horses were sometimes joyn'd to the chariot. <HI>Virgil</HI> has borrow'd
this comparison, <HI>Aen.</HI> 5.
<Q><L>Non tam praecipites bijugo certamine campum</L>
<L>Corripuere, ruuntque effusi carcere currus,</L>
<L>Nec sic immissis aurigae undantia lora</L>
<L>Concussere jugis, pronique in verbera pendent.</L></Q>
It must be allow'd that nothing was ever more happily executed
than this description, and the copy far exceeds the original. <HI>Ma∣crobius,
Saturnal. lib.</HI> 5. gives this as his opinion, and his reasons
for it. The <HI>Greek</HI> Poet (says that Author) paints only the swift∣ness
of the horses when scourg'd by the driver; <HI>Virgil</HI> adds, the
rushing of the chariot, the fields as it were devour'd by the ra∣pidity
of the horses; we see the throwing up of the reins, in <HI>un∣dantia
lora;</HI> and the attitude of the driver, leaning forward in
the act of lashing the horses, in the words, <HI>Pronique in verbera
pendent.</HI> 'Tis true, nothing could be added more elegantly than
the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; in <HI>Homer,</HI> it paints at once the swiftness of
the race, and the rising posture of the horses in the act of run∣ning;
but <HI>Virgil</HI> is more copious, and has omitted no circum∣stance,
and set the whole race fully before our eyes; we may add,
that the versification is as beautiful as the description compleat;
every ear must be sensible of it.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="269"/>
I will only further observe the judgment of <HI>Homer,</HI> in speak∣ing
of every person in his particular character. When a vain∣glorious
<HI>Phaeacian</HI> describ'd the sailing of his own vessels, they
were swift as thought, and endued with reason; when <HI>Homer</HI>
speaks in his own person to his readers, they are said only to be
as swift as hawks or horses: <HI>Homer</HI> speaks like a Poet, with some
degree of amplification, but not with so much hyperbole as <HI>Alci∣nous.</HI>
No people speak so fondly as sailors of their own ships to
this day, and particularly are still apt to talk of them as of living
creatures.</P>

<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 112. But when the morning star with early ray</L>
<L>Flam'd in the front of heav'n—]</L></Q>
From this passage we may gather, that <HI>Ithaca</HI> is distant from
<HI>Corcyra</HI> or <HI>Phaeacia</HI> no further than a vessel sails in the compass
of one night; and this agrees with the real distance between those
Islands; an instance that <HI>Homer</HI> was well acquainted with Geo∣graphy:
This is the morning of the thirty fifth day.</P>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 116.—A spacious port appears,</L>
<L>Sacred to <HI>Phorcys</HI>—]</L></Q>
<HI>Phorcys</HI> was the son of <HI>Pontus</HI> and <HI>Terra,</HI> according to <HI>Hesiod</HI>'s
genealogy of the Gods; this Haven is said to be sacred to that
Deity, because he had a temple near it, from whence it receiv'd
its appellation.</P>
<P>The whole voyage of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to his country, and indeed the
whole <HI>Odyssey,</HI> has been turn'd into allegory; which I will lay be∣fore
the Reader as an instance of a trifling industry and strong
imagination. <HI>Ulysses</HI> is in search of true felicity, the <HI>Ithaca</HI> and
<HI>Penelope</HI> of <HI>Homer:</HI> He runs thro' many difficulties and dangers;
this shews that happiness is not to be attain'd without labour and
afflictions. He has several companions, who perish by their vices,
<PB N="272" REF="270"/>
and he alone escapes by the assistance of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> and is
transported in his sleep to his country; that is, the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI>
whose name implies blackness, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, are the mourners at his
death, and attend him to his grave: The ship is his grave, which
is afterwards turn'd into a rock; which represents his monumen∣tal
marble; his sleep means death, thro' which alone man arrives
at eternal felicity. <HI>Spondanus.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 124.—<HI>A gloomy Grotto's cool recess.</HI>] <HI>Porphyry</HI>
has wrote a volume to explain this cave of the Nymphs, with
more piety perhaps than judgment; and another person has per∣verted
it into the utmost obscenity, and both allegorically. <HI>Por∣phyry</HI>
(observes <HI>Eustathius</HI>) is of opinion, that the cave means the
world; it is called gloomy, but agreeable, because it was made
out of darkness, and afterwards set in this agreeable order by the
hand of the Deity. It is consecrated to the Nymphs; that is,
it is destin'd to the habitation of spiritual substances united to the
body: The bowls and urns of living stone, are the body which
are form'd out of the earth; the bees that make their hony in
the cave are the souls of men, which perform all their operati∣ons
in the body, and animate it; the beams on which the
Nymphs roul their webs, are the bones over which the admira∣ble
embroidery of nerves, veins and arteries are spread; the foun∣tains
which water the cave are the seas, rivers and lakes that wa∣ter
the world; and the two gates, are the two poles; thro' the nor∣thern
the souls descend from Heaven to animate the body, thro'
the southern they ascend to Heaven, after they are separated from
the body by death. But I confess I should rather chuse to un∣derstand
the description poetically, believing that <HI>Homer</HI> never
dream'd of these matters, tho' the age in which he flourish'd
was addicted to Allegory. How often do Painters draw from the
imagination only, merely to please the eye? And why might not
<HI>Homer</HI> write after it, especially in this place where he mani∣festly

horrors, and his imagination being tired with the melancholy
story, it is not impossible but his spirit might be enliven'd with
the subject while he wrote, and this might lead him to indulge
his fancy in a wonderful, and perhaps fabulous description. In
short, I should much rather chute to believe that the memory of
the things to which he alludes in the description of the cave is lost,
than credit such a labour'd and distant Allegory.</P>

It has been already observ'd, that the <HI>Aethiopians</HI> held an annual

their images in procession, and placed them at their festivals,
and for this reason the Gods were said to feast with the <HI>Aethiopi∣ans;</HI>
that is, they were present with them by their statues: Thus
also <HI>Themis</HI> was said to form or dissolve assemblies, because they
carried her image to the assemblies when they were conven'd,
and when they were broken up they carried it away. Now we have
already remark'd, that this port was sacred to <HI>Phovcys,</HI> because he
had a Temple by it: It may not then be impossible, but that
this Temple having two doors, they might carry the statues of
the Gods in their processions thro' the southern gate, which
might be consecrated to this use only, and the populace be for∣bid
to enter by it: For that reason the Deities were said to enter:
namely, by their images. As the other gate being allotted to

<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 138. <HI>Ulysses</HI> sleeping on his couch they bore,</L>
<L>And gently plac'd him on the rocky shore.</L></Q>
There is nothing in the whole <HI>Odyssey</HI> that more shocks our rea∣son
than, the exposing <HI>Ulysses</HI> asleep on the shores by the <HI>Phaeaci∣ans:</HI>
“The passage (says <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his <HI>Poetics</HI>) where <HI>Ulysses</HI> is
landed in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> is so full of absurdities, that they would be
intolerable in a bad Poet; but <HI>Homer</HI> has conceal'd them un∣der
an infinity of admirable beauties, with which he has a∣dorn'd
<PB N="275" REF="273"/>
all that part of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> these he has crowded toge∣ther,
as so many charms to hinder our perceiving the defects
of the story:” <HI>Aristotle</HI> must be allow'd to speak with great
judgment; for what probability is there that a man so prudent
as <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who was alone in a vessel at the discretion of strangers,
should sleep so soundly, as to be taken out of it, carried with all
his baggage on shore, and the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> should set sail, and he ne∣ver
awake? This is still more absurd, if we remember that <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>
has his soul so strongly bent upon his country; Is it then possible,
that he could be thus sunk into a lethargy, in the moment when
he arrives at it? “However (says Mons. <HI>Dacier</HI> in his reflections
upon <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <HI>Poetics</HI>) <HI>Homer</HI> was not ashamed of that Ab∣surdity,
but not being able to omit it, he used it to give Pro∣bability
to the succeeding story: It was necessary for <HI>Ulysses</HI>
to land alone, in order to his concealment; if he had been
discover'd, the suitors would immediately have destroy'd him,
if not as the real <HI>Ulysses,</HI> yet under the pretext of his being
an impostor; they would then have seiz'd his dominions, and
married <HI>Penelope:</HI> Now if he had been waked, the <HI>Phaeacians</HI>
would have been oblig'd to have attended him, which he could
not have deny'd with decency, nor accepted with safety: <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
therefore had no other way left to unravel his fable hap∣pily:
But he knew what was absurd in this method, and uses
means to hide it; he lavishes out all his wit and address, and
lays together such an abundance of admirable Poetry, that the
mind of the Reader is so inchanted, that he perceives not the
defect; he is like <HI>Ulysses</HI> lull'd asleep, and knows no more than
that Heroe, how he comes there. That great Poet first
describes the ceremony of <HI>Ulysses</HI> taking leave of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> and
his Queen <HI>Arete;</HI> then he sets off the swiftness of the vessel by
two beautiful companions; he describes the Haven with great
exactness, and adds to it the description of the cave of the
Nymphs; this last astonishes the Reader, and he is so intent
upon it, that he has not attention to consider the absurdity in
the manner of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s landing: In this moment when
<PB N="276" REF="274"/>
he perceives the mind of the Reader as it were intoxicated
with these beauties, he steals <HI>Ulysses</HI> on shore, and dismisses the
<HI>Phaeacians;</HI> all this takes up but eight verses. And then lest
the Reader should reflect upon it, he immediately introduces
the Deities, and gives us a dialogue between <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Neptune.</HI>
This keeps up still our wonder, and our reason has not time
to deliberate; and when the dialogue is ended, a second won∣der
succeeds, the bark is transform'd into a rock: This is
done in the sight of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> by which method the Poet
carries us a-while from the consideration of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> by remov∣ing
the scene to a distant Island; there he detains us 'till we
may be suppos'd to have forgot the past absurdities, by relat∣ing
the astonishment of <HI>Alcinous</HI> at the sight of the prodigy,
and his offering up to <HI>Neptune,</HI> to appease his anger, a sacri∣fice
of twelve bulls. Then he returns to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who now
wakes, and not knowing the place where he was, (because
<HI>Minerva</HI> made all things appear in a disguis'd view) he com∣plains
of his misfortunes, and accuses the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> of infide∣lity;
at length <HI>Minerva</HI> comes to him in the shape of a young
shepherd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus this absurdity, which appears in the fable
when examin'd alone, is hidden by the beauties that surround it:
this passage is more adorn'd with fiction, and more wrought up
with a variety of poetical ornaments than most other places of the
<HI>Odyssey.</HI> From hence <HI>Aristotle</HI> makes an excellent observation. All ef∣forts
imaginable (says that Author) ought to be made to form
the fable rightly from die beginning; but if it so happen that
some places must necessarily appear absurd, they must be ad∣mitted,
especially if they contribute to render the rest more
probable: but the Poet ought to reserve all the ornaments of
diction for these weak parts: The places that have either shi∣ning
sentiments or manners have no occasion for them; a da∣zling
expression rather damages them, and serves only to e∣clipse
their beauty.</P>

<P>VERSE 142.—<HI>Then launch'd the bark again.</HI>] This vo∣luntary
and unexpected return of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> and their landing
<HI>Ulysses</HI> in his sleep, seems as unaccountable on the part of the
<HI>Phaeacians,</HI> as of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> for what can be more absurd than to
see them exposing a King and his effects upon the shores with∣out
his knowledge, and then flying away secretly as from an ene∣my?
Having therefore in the preceding note shew'd what the
Critics say in condemnation of <HI>Homer,</HI> it is but justice to lay to∣gether
what they say in his defence.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> should fly away in secret is no wonder:
<HI>Ulysses</HI> had thro' the whole course of the eleventh book, (particu∣larly
by the mouth of the Prophet <HI>Tiresias</HI>) told the <HI>Phaeacians</HI>
that the suitors plotted his destruction; and therefore the mariners
might very reasonably be apprehensive that the suitors would use
any persons as enemies, who should contribute to restore <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>
to his country. It was therefore necessary that they should sail
away without any stay upon the <HI>Ithacan</HI> shores. This is the
reason why they made this voyage by night; namely, to avoid
discovery; and it was as necessary to return immediately, that
is, just at the appearance of day, before people were abroad,
that they might escape observation.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> remarks, that the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> were an unwarlike na∣tion,
or as it is expressed by a <HI>Phaeacian,</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
and therefore they were afraid to teach any persons the way to
their own country, by discovering the course of Navigation to it;
for this reason they begin their voyage to <HI>Ithaca</HI> by night, land
<HI>Ulysses</HI> without waking him, and return at the appearance of day∣light,
that they might not shew what course was to be steer'd to
come to the <HI>Phaeacian</HI> shores.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="276"/>
<HI>Plutarch</HI> in his treatise of reading the Poets, tells us, that there
is a tradition among the <HI>Tuscans,</HI> that <HI>Ulysses</HI> was naturally <HI>drow∣zy,</HI>
and a person that could not easily be convers'd with, by
reason of that <HI>sleepy</HI> disposition. But perhaps this might be only
artful in a man or so great wisdom, and so great disguise or dis∣simulation;
he was slow to give answers, when he had no mind
to give any at all: Tho' indeed it must be confess'd, that this tra∣dition
is countenanc'd by his behaviour in the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> or rather
may be only a story form'd from it. His greatest calamities rise from
his <HI>sleeping:</HI> when he was ready to land upon his own country, by
the favour of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> he falls <HI>asleep,</HI> and his companions let loose
a wind that bears him from it: He is <HI>asleep</HI> while they kill the
oxen of <HI>Apollo;</HI> and here he <HI>sleeps</HI> while he is landed upon his
own country. It might perhaps be this conduct in <HI>Homer,</HI> that
gave <HI>Horace</HI> the hint to say,
<Q>—<L><HI>Aliquando bonus</HI> dormitat <HI>Homerus.</HI></L></Q>
implying, that when <HI>Homer</HI> was at a loss to bring any diffi∣cult
matter to an issue, he immediately laid his Heroe <HI>asleep,</HI>
and this salv'd all the difficulty; as in the above-mention'd in∣stances.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> is of opinion that this <HI>sleep</HI> of <HI>Ulysses</HI> was feign'd; and
that he made use of the pretence of a <HI>natural infirmity,</HI> to con∣ceal
the streights he was in at that time in his thoughts; being
asham'd to dismiss the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> without entertainment and gifts
of hospitality, and affraid of being discover'd by the fuitors, if
he entertain'd such a multitude: Therefore to avoid both these
difficulties, he feigns a Sleep while they land him, 'till they
sail away.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> agrees with <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the main, and adds another
reason why the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> land <HI>Ulysses</HI> sleeping; namely, because
they were asham'd to wake him, left he should think they did it
out of avarice, and expectation of a reward for bringing him to
his own country.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="277"/>
I will only add, that there might be a natural reason for the
Sleep of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> we are to remember that this is a voyage in the
night, the season of repose: and his spirits having been long a∣gitated
and fatigued by his calamities, might, upon his peace of
mind at the return to his Country, settle into a deep calmness and
tranquility, and so sink him into a deep Sleep; <HI>Homer</HI> himself
seems to give this as the reason of it in the following lines:
<Q><L>Much danger long and mighty toils he bore.</L>
<L>In storms by sea, and combats on the shore;</L>
<L>All which soft sleep now banish'd from his breast,</L>
<L>Wrapt in a pleasing, deep, and death-like rest.</L></Q>
It must be allowed that the last line admirably paves the way for
the following account; and the Poet undoubtedly inserted it, to
prevent our surprize at the manner of his being set on shore, by
calling his Sleep
<Q><L>—a pleasing, deep, and death-like rest.</L></Q>
How far a wise man is oblig'd' to resist the calls of nature, I
leave to the discussion of Philosophers; those of sleep are no more
to be resisted, than those of thirst or hunger. But yet I confess
<HI>Ulysses</HI> yielded unseasonably, and the strong passion and love for his
Country that so fully possess'd his soul, should have given him
a few hours of vigilance, when he was ready to fee it after an
absence of almost twenty years.</P>

<L>A mark of vengeance—</L>
<L>And roots her down, an everlasting rock]</L></Q>
I refer the Reader to the eighth book of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> for a further
account of this transformation. <HI>Scaliger</HI> condemns it, <HI>Ulyssis navis
<PB N="280" REF="278"/>
in saxum mutatur a Neptuno, ut immortalem faciat, quem odio habere
debuit.</HI> But will it not be an answer to say, that it is an immortal
monument of the vengeance and power of <HI>Neptune,</HI> and that when∣ever
the story of the Vessel was mention'd, the punishment like∣wise
must be remembred in honour of that Deity? Some are of
opinion, that it is a physical Allegory, and that <HI>Homer</HI> delivers
the opinion of the Ancients concerning the Transmutation of one
species into another, as wood into stone, by Water, that is by <HI>Nep∣tune</HI>
the God of it; according to those lines of <HI>Ovid:</HI>
<Q><L>Flumen habent Cicones, quod potum saxea reddit</L>
<L>Viscera, quod tactis inducit marmora rebus.</L></Q>
But perhaps this is only one of those marvellous fictions written
after the taste of antiquity, which delighted in wonders, and
which the nature of Epic Poetry allows. “The Marvellous
(says <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his <HI>Poetics</HI>) ought to take place in Tragedy,
but much more in the Epic, in which it proceeds even to the ex∣travagant;
for the Marvellous is always agreeable, and a Proof
of it is, that those who relate any thing, generally add some∣thing
to the Truth of it, that it, may better please those who
hear it. <HI>Homer</HI> (continues he) is the man who has given the
best Instructions to other Poets how to tell Lies agreeably.”
<HI>Horace</HI> is of the same opinion.
<Q><L>Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet,</L>
<L>Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum.</L></Q>
However we must not think that <HI>Aristotle</HI> advises Poets to put
things evidently false and impossible into their Poems, or gives
them licence to run out into wildness; he only means (as Mon∣sieur
<HI>Dacier</HI> observes) that the Wonderful should exceed the Pro∣bable,
but not destroy it; and this will, be effected if the Poet
has the Address to prepare the Reader, and to lead him by a
probable train of things that depend on miracle, to the miracle
<PB N="281" REF="279"/>
it self, and reconcile him to it by degrees, so that his Reason does
not perceive, at least is not shock'd at the Illusion; thus for in∣stance,
<HI>Homer</HI> puts this Transformation into the hands of a Deity;
he prepares us for it in the eighth book, he gives us the reason
of the transformation; namely the anger of <HI>Neptune;</HI> and at
last he brings in <HI>Jupiter</HI> assenting to it. This is the method
<HI>Homer</HI> takes to reconcile it to Probabilty. <HI>Virgil</HI> undoubtedly
thought it a beauty, for after <HI>Homer</HI>'s example, he gives us a
transformation of the ships of <HI>Aeneas</HI> into Sea-nymphs.</P>
<P>I have already remark'd from <HI>Bossu,</HI> that such miracles as these
ought not to be too frequent in an Epic Poem; all the ma∣chines
that require Divine probability ought to be so detach'd
from the action of the Poem, that they may be retrench'd from
it, without destroying the action: Those that are essential to the
action ought to be founded upon human probability. Thus if
we take away this transformation, there is no chasm; and it no
way affects the integrity of the action,</P>

averted by the piety of <HI>Alcinous.</HI> But (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes)
it was artful in the Poet to leave this point doubtful, to avoid
detection in deviating from true History; for should posterity
enquire where this land of the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> lay, it would be found
to be <HI>Corfou</HI> of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and not covered with any moun∣tain;

The meaning of this whole passage is probably no more than
that <HI>Ulysses</HI> by his long absence had forgot the face of his own
country; the woods by almost twenty years growth had a different
appearance; and the public roads were alter'd by so great a
length of time. How then should <HI>Ulysses</HI> come to the know∣ledge
of the place? He goes to a shepherd, and by telling him
a plausible story draws it from him. This artifice is the <HI>Mi∣nerva</HI>
that gives him information. By the <HI>veil of thicken'd air</HI>
is meant, that <HI>Ulysses,</HI> to accomplish his re-establishment, took up∣on
him a disguise, and conceal'd himself from the <HI>Ithacans;</HI> and
this too being the dictate of Wisdom, <HI>Homer</HI> ascribes it to <HI>Pal∣las.</HI></P>

<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</L></Q>
which are usually apply'd by interpreters to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and mean that
the Goddess disguis'd him with this veil, that no one might know
him. <HI>Dacier</HI> is of opinion that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ought to be used active∣ly;
that is, the Goddess acted thus to make him <HI>unknowing</HI> where
<PB N="283" REF="281"/>
he was, not <HI>unknown</HI> to the people; for that this was the effect
of the veil appears from the removal of it; for immediately
upon the dispersion,
<Q><L>The King with joy confess'd his place of birth.</L></Q>
That the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> will bear an active signification, she
proves from the scholiast upon <HI>OEdipus</HI> of <HI>Sophocles.</HI> But per∣haps
the context will not permit this interpretation, tho' we
should allow that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> will bear it. The pas∣sage
runs thus: <HI>Pallas</HI> cast round a veil of air, that she might
make him unknown, that she might instruct him, and that his
wife and friends might not know him; for thus <HI>Homer</HI> interprets
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the very next line, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It is there∣fore
probable, that this veil had a double effect, both to render
<HI>Ulysses</HI> unknown to the country, and the country to <HI>Ulysses.</HI> I

The conduct of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in numb'ring his effects, has been censur'd
by some Critics as avaritious: But we find him vindicated by
<HI>Plutarch</HI> in his treatise of reading the Poets: “If (says that Author)
<HI>Ulysses</HI> finding himself in a solitary place, and ignorant of the
country, and having no security even for his own person, is
nevertheless chiefly sollicitous for his effects, lest any part might
have been stol'n; his covetousness is really to be pitied and de∣tested.
<PB N="284" REF="282"/>
But this is not the case: He counts his goods merely
to prove the fidelity of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> and to gather from it,
whether they had landed him upon his own country; for it
was not probable that they would expose him in a strange re∣gion,
and leave his goods untouch'd, and by consequence reap
no advantage from their dishonesty: This therefore was a very

<P>This observation is necessary to shew the value of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s do∣minions,

it is likewise of use to convince us, that the domestic
cares and concerns of <HI>Telemachus</HI> proceeded not from meanness,
but from the manners of the age; when pomp and luxury had
not yet found countenance from Princes; and that when we see
<HI>Eumaeus,</HI> who has the charge of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s hogs, we are not to sup∣pose
him a person of low rank and fortunes, but an Officer of
State, and trust: The riches of those ages consisting in flocks and
herds, in swine and oxen.</P>

<P>VERSE 299. <HI>Ev'n to those shores is</HI> Ithaca <HI>renown'd.</HI>] Nothing
can more raise our esteem of the judgment of <HI>Homer,</HI> than such

the knowledge of his country; How does she do this? She Geo∣graphically
describes it to him; so that he must almost know it
by the description: but still she suppresses the name, and this keeps
him in a pleasing suspense; he attends to every syllable to hear her
name <HI>Ithaca,</HI> which she still defers, to continue his doubts and
<PB N="286" REF="284"/>
hopes, and at last in the very close of her speech she indirectly
mentions it. This discovery in my judgment is carried on with
great address, and cannot fail of awakening the curiosity of the

the Commentators upon the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>

<HI>Eustathius</HI> observes that this relation is not consonant to ancient
Histories, but invented to make the disguis'd <HI>Ulysses</HI> more accep∣table
to the Suitors, should he be brought before them: For this
person, whom they could not know to be <HI>Ulysses,</HI> could not fail of
finding favour with them, having slain the son of <HI>Idomeneus</HI> the
friend of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> And tho' it be not recorded by the Ancients,
yet it may be conjectur'd, that <HI>Orsilochus</HI> was thus slain, tho' not
by <HI>Ulysses.</HI> If the death of <HI>Orsilochus</HI> was a story that made a noise
in the world about that time, it was very artful in <HI>Ulysses</HI> to
make use of it, to gain credit with this seeming <HI>Ithacan;</HI> for he
relating the Fact truly, might justry be believ'd to speak truly
when he nam'd himself the Author of it, and consequently avoid
all suspicion of being <HI>Ulysses.</HI> It is observable that <HI>Ulysses</HI> is very
circumstantial in his story, he relates the time, the place, the man∣ner,
and the reason of his killing <HI>Orsilochus:</HI> this is done to give
the story a greater air of truth; for it seems almost impossible
that so many circumstances could be invented in a moment, and
so well laid together as not to discover their own falsity. What
he says concerning the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> leaving his effects entire without
any damage, is not spoken (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes) in vain; he
extolls the fidelity of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> as an example to be imita∣ted
by this seeming <HI>Ithacensian,</HI> and makes it an argument that
he should practise the same integrity, in not offering violence or
fraud to his effects or person.</P>

was truth that <HI>Orsilochus</HI> was killed in that manner, <HI>Ulysses</HI> could

<P>VERSE 316. <HI>In a</HI> Phaenician <HI>vessel took my flight.</HI>] The whole
story of the Voyages of <HI>Ulysses</HI> is related differently by <HI>Dictys
Cretensis,</HI> in his History of the war of <HI>Troy:</HI> I will transcribe it,
if not as a truth, yet as a curiosity.</P>
<P>“About this time <HI>Ulysses</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Crete</HI> with two vessels hir'd
of the <HI>Phaenicians:</HI> For <HI>Telamon,</HI> enrag'd for the death of his Son
<HI>Ajax,</HI> had seiz'd upon all that belong'd to <HI>Ulysses</HI> and his com∣panions,
and he himself was with difficulty set at liberty. While
he was in <HI>Crete, Idomeneus</HI> ask'd him how he fell into such great ca∣lamities;
to whom he recounted all his adventures. He told him,
that after his departure from <HI>Troy</HI> he made an incursion upon
<HI>Ismarus</HI> of the <HI>Ciconians,</HI> and there got great booty; then touch∣ing
upon the coasts of the <HI>Lotophagi,</HI> he met with ill success,
and sail'd away to <HI>Sicily;</HI> there, <HI>Cyclops</HI> and <HI>Laestrigon</HI> two bro∣thers
used him barbarously; and at length he lost most of his
companions thro' the cruelty of <HI>Polypheme</HI> and <HI>Antiphates,</HI> the
sons of <HI>Cyclops</HI> and <HI>Laestrygon;</HI> but being afterwards received
into favour by <HI>Polypheme,</HI> his companions attempted to carry
off <HI>Arene</HI> the King's daughter, who was fall'n in love with <HI>El∣penor,</HI>
one of his associates; but the affair being discover'd, and
<HI>Ulysses</HI> dismiss'd, he sail'd away by the <HI>Aeolian</HI> Islands, and
came to <HI>Circe</HI> and <HI>Calypso,</HI> who were both Queens of two
Isles; there his companions wasted some time in dalliance and
pleasures: Thence he sail'd to a people that were fam'd for ma∣gical
incantations, to learn his future fortunes. He escap'd
<PB N="288" REF="286"/>
the rocks of the <HI>Sirens, Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis,</HI> tho' he there lost
many of his companions; then he fell into the hands of <HI>Phae∣nician</HI>
rovers, who spar'd him; and afterwards coming to <HI>Crete,</HI>
he was dismiss'd by <HI>Idomeneus</HI> with two vessels, and arrived at
the coast of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> who being prevail'd upon by the glory
of his name entertain'd him courteously: From him he learn'd
that <HI>Penelope</HI> was address'd by thirty Princes; upon this, with
much intreaty, he persuaded <HI>Alcinous</HI> to undertake a voyage to
re-establish him in his territories; they set sail together, and
concealing themselves with <HI>Telemachus</HI> 'till all things were con∣certed,
they led their friends to the Palace, and slew the Suit∣ors
oppress'd with sleep and drowziness.”</P>
<P>The difference between the Poet and the Historian lies chiefly
in what is here said of the death of <HI>Orsilochus; Dictys</HI> tells
us, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> was entertain'd like a friend by <HI>Idomeneus,</HI> and
<HI>Homer</HI> writes that he slew his Son; now <HI>Idomeneus</HI> cannot be sup∣pos'd
to have favour'd the murtherer of his son: But this is no
objection, if we consider that <HI>Ulysses</HI> speaks not as <HI>Ulysses,</HI> but in
a personated character, and therefore <HI>Orsilochus</HI> must be judg'd to
have fall'n by the hand of the person whose character <HI>Ulysses</HI> as∣sumes;
that is, by a <HI>Cretan,</HI> and not <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dictys</HI> is suppos'd to have serv'd under this <HI>Idomeneus,</HI> and to
have wrote an History of the <HI>Trojan</HI> war in <HI>Phaenician</HI> characters;
and <HI>Tzetzes</HI> tells us, that <HI>Homer</HI> form'd his Poem upon his plan;
but the History now extant publish'd by Mrs. <HI>L'Fevre</HI> is a coun∣terfeit:
So that what I have here translated, is inserted not as an
authority, but as the opinion of an unknown writer; and I lay no
other weight upon it.</P>

<L>In arts of counsel, and dissembling well.]</L></Q>
It has been objected against <HI>Homer,</HI> that he gives a degree of
dissimulation to his Heroe, unworthy of a brave man, and an
<PB N="289" REF="287"/>
ingenuous disposition: Here we have a full vindication of <HI>U∣lysses,</HI>
from the mouth of the Goddess of Wisdom; he uses only
a prudent dissimulation; he is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which we may al∣most
literally render, <HI>master of a great presence of mind:</HI> that
is, upon every emergency he finds an immediate resource to
extricate himself from it. If his dissimulation had been vicious,
it would have been an absurdity to have introduced <HI>Minerva</HI>
praising and recommending it; on the contrary, all disguise which
consists with innocence and prudence, is so far from being mean,
that it really is a praise to a person who uses it. I speak not of com∣mon
life, or as if men should always act under a mask, and in dis∣guise;
that indeed betrays design and insincerity: I only recom∣mend
it as an instance how men should behave in the article
of danger, when it is as reputable to elude an enemy as to de∣feat
one.
<Q><L>—dolus an virtus quis in hoste requirit.</L></Q>
This is the character of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who uses only such artifice as is
suggested by Wisdom, such as turns to his benefit in all extre∣mities,
such as <HI>Minerva</HI> may boast to practise without a rival a∣mong
the Gods, as much as <HI>Ulysses</HI> among mankind. In short,
this dissimulation, in war may be call'd stratagem and conduct,
in other exigencies address and dexterity; nor is <HI>Ulysses</HI> criminal,
but artful.</P>

may appear somewhat extraordinary that <HI>Ulysses</HI> should not
believe <HI>Minerva,</HI> who had already assured him that he was
landed in his own country: But two answers may be given to
this objection, and his doubts may be ascrib'd to his having lost
the knowledge of it thro' his long absence, for that is the veil
which is cast before his eyes; or to the nature of man in general,
who when he desires any thing vehemently scarce believes him∣self
<PB N="290" REF="288"/>
in the possession of it, even while he possesses it. Nothing
is more frequent than such expressions upon the Theater, and in
the transport of an unexpected happiness, we are apt to think it
a delusion; from hence die fears of <HI>Ulysses</HI> arise, and they are to
be imputed to his vehement love of his country, not to his un∣belief.</P>

reason if it were related suddenly, without any preparation to
shew us the probability of it: This is the intent of <HI>Homer</HI> in this
and various other places of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> he softens the relation,
and reconciles us to it by such insertions, before he describes that
great event. The Ancients (says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) would not here al∣low
<HI>Ulysses</HI> to speak hyperbolically; he is that Heroe whom we
have already seen in the <HI>Iliad</HI> resist whole bands of <HI>Trojans,</HI> when
the <HI>Greeks</HI> were repuls'd, where he slew numbers of enemies, and
sustain'd their assaults till he was disengag'd by <HI>Ajax.</HI> Besides,
there is an excellent moral in what <HI>Ulysses</HI> speaks; it contains this

whom we left at <HI>Sparta</HI> with <HI>Menelaus</HI> in the fourth book
of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> He has been long out of sight, and we have
heard of none of his actions; <HI>Telemachus</HI> is not the Heroe of
the Poem, he is only an under Agent, and consequently the
Poet was at liberty to omit any or all of his adventures,
unless such as have a necessary connection with the story of the
<HI>Odyssey,</HI> and contribute to the re-establishment of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> by
this method likewise <HI>Homer</HI> gives variety to his Poetry, and breaks
or gathers up the thread of it, as it tends to diversify the whole:
We may consider an Epic Poem as a spacious garden, where
there are to be different walks and views, left the eye should be
tir'd with too great a regularity and uniformity: The chief avenue
ought to be the most ample and noble, but there should be by∣walks
to retire into sometimes for our ease and refreshment. The
Poet thus gives us several openings to draw us forward with plea∣sure;
and tho' the great event of the Poem be chiefly in view,
yet he sometimes leads us aside into other short passages which
<PB N="293" REF="291"/>
end in it again, and bring us with pleasure to the conclusion of
it. Thus for instance, <HI>Homer</HI> begins with the story of <HI>Telemachus</HI>
and the Suitors; then he leaves them a-while, and more largely
lays before us the adventures of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> the Heroe of his Poem;
when he has satisfy'd the curiosity of the Reader by a full nar∣ration
of what belongs to him, he returns to <HI>Telemachus</HI> and the
suitors: at length he unites the two stories, and proceeds directly
to the end of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> Thus all the collateral and indirect
passages fall into one center, and main point of view. The eye
is continually entertain'd with some new object, and we pass on
from incident to incident, not only without fatigue, but with
pleasure and admiration.</P>

ON THE
FOURTEENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E see in this book the character of a faith∣ful,
wise, benevolent old man in <HI>Eumaeus;</HI>
one happily innocent, unambitious, and whol∣ly
employed in rural affairs. The whole inter∣view
between <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus</HI> has fallen
into ridicule; <HI>Eumaeus</HI> has been judg'd to be
of the same rank and condition with our mo∣dern
swineherds. But herds and flocks were
then kept and attended by the sons of Kings;
thus <HI>Paris</HI> watched the flocks of <HI>Priam</HI> in the groves of <HI>Ida,</HI> and
the same is said of many of the Heroes in the <HI>Iliad;</HI> these offices
were places of dignity, and fill'd by persons of birth; and such
was <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> descended from a Prince, named <HI>Ctesius:</HI> Thus the
Master of the <HI>Horse</HI> is a post of Honour in modern ages.</P>
<P>It is in Poetry, as in Painting; where the artist does not con∣fine
himself to draw only Gods or Heroes, Palaces and Princes;
but he frequently employs his pencil in representing Landschapes,
rural scenes, groves, cottages, and shepherds tending their flocks.</P>
<P>There is a passage in Monsieur <HI>Boileau</HI>'s reflections upon <HI>Lon∣ginus,</HI>
which fully vindicates all the places of <HI>Homer</HI> that have
been censur'd as low and too familiar. “There is nothing, (ob∣serves
that Author) that more disgraces a composition than the
<PB N="336" REF="328"/>
use of <HI>vulgar words:</HI> A mean thought expressed in noble terms,
is generally more taking than a noble thought debased by
mean terms: The reason is, every person cannot judge of the
justness and strength of a thought, but there are very few, es∣pecially
in living languages, who are not shock'd at mean
words: and yet almost all writers fall, into this fault. <HI>Longinus</HI>
accuses <HI>Herodotus,</HI> the most polite of all the <HI>Greek</HI> Historians, of
this defect; and <HI>Livy, Sallust,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> have fall'n under the
same imputation. Is it not then very surprizing that no reproach
upon this account has fall'n upon <HI>Homer?</HI> especially, tho' he has
compos'd two large Poems, and tho' no Author has descended
more frequently into the detail of little particularities; yet he ne∣ver
uses terms which are not noble, or if he uses humble words
or phrases it is with so much art, that as <HI>Dionysius Halicarnassus</HI>
observes, they become noble and harmonious. We may learn
from hence the ignorance of those modern Criticks, who judge
of the <HI>Greek</HI> without the knowledge of it; and having never read
<HI>Homer</HI> but in low and inelegant translations, impute the Meanes∣ses
of the Translator to the Poet. Besides, the words of different
languages are not exactly correspondent, and it often happens that
an expression which is noble in the <HI>Greek</HI> cannot be render'd in
a version but by words that are either mean in the sound or
usage. Thus <HI>ass,</HI> and <HI>asinus</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> are mean to the last degree;
tho' <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the <HI>Greek</HI> be used in the most magnificent descri∣ptions,
and has nothing mean in it; in like manner the terms
<HI>Hogherd</HI> and <HI>Cowkeeper,</HI> are not to be used in our Poetry;
but there are no finer words in the <HI>Greek</HI> language than <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: And <HI>Virgil,</HI> who entitles his <HI>Eclogues Bucolics</HI> in the
<HI>Roman</HI> tongue, would have been ashamed to have call'd them
in our language <HI>the Dialogues of Cowkeepers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> himself convinces us of the truth of this Observation;
nay, one would imagine that he intended industriously to force
it upon our notice: for he frequently calls <HI>Eumaeus</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
or <HI>Prince of men;</HI> and his common epithet is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
<HI>Homer</HI> would not have apply'd these appellations to him,
if he had not been a person of dignity; it being the same title
that he bestows upon his greatest Heroes, <HI>Ulysses</HI> or <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 1. <HI>But He, deep-musing, o'er the mountains stray'd.</HI>]
I shall transcribe the observation of <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus</HI> up∣on
the first verses in this book: The same method, remarks
that Author, makes both prose and verse beautiful; which
consists in these three things, the judicious coaptation and
ranging of the words, the position of the members and parts of
the verse, and the various measure of the periods. Whoever
would write elegantly, must have regard to the different turn
and juncture of every period, there must be proper distances and
pauses; every verse must be a compleat sentence, but broken and
interrupted, and the parts made unequal, some longer, some
shorter, to give a variety of cadence to it. Neither the turn of
the parts of the verse, nor the length, ought to be alike. This is
absolutely necessary: For the Epic or Heroic verse is of a fix'd de∣terminate
length, and we cannot, as in the Lyric, make one long∣er,
and another shorter; therefore to avoid an identity of
cadence, and a perpetual return of the same periods, it is re∣quisite
to contract, lengthen, and interrupt the pause and stru∣cture
of the members of the verses, to create an harmonious in∣equality,
and out of a fix'd number of syllables to raise a perpe∣tual
diversity. For instance,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
Here one line makes one sentence; the next is shorter,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</Q>
The next is still shorter,
<Q>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</Q>
The next sentence composes two Hemystics,
<PB N="336" REF="330"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="337" REF="331"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="338" REF="332"/>
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</L></Q>
and is entirely unlike any of the preceding periods.
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q>
Here again the sentence is not finish'd with the former verse, but
breaks into the fourth line; and lest we should be out of breath
with the length of the sentence, the period and the verse conclude
together at the end of it.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Homer</HI> begins a new sentence, and makes it pause diffe∣rently
from any of the former.
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q>
Then he adds,
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</L></Q>
This is perfectly unequal to the foregoing period, and the pause of
the sentence is carry'd forward into the second verse; and what
then follows is neither distinguish'd by the pauses nor parts peri∣odically,
but almost at every word there is a stop.
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
No doubt but <HI>Homer</HI> was a perfect master of numbers; a man
can no more be a Poet than a Musician, without a good ear, as
we usually express it. 'Tis true, that versisication is but the Me∣chanism
of Poetry, but it sets off good sense to the best advantage,
'tis a colouring that enlivens the portrait, and makes even a beau∣ty
more agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="333"/>
I will conclude this note, with observing what Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> says
of these two lines from <HI>Cowper</HI>'s Hill,
<Q><L>Tho' deep, yet clear, tho' gentle, yet not dull,</L>
<L>Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full.</L></Q>
“There are few (says he) who make verses, that have observ'd the
sweetness of these lines, and fewer who can find the reason of
it.” But I believe no one will be at a loss to solve the difficulty
who considers this observation of <HI>Dionysius:</HI> and I doubt not but
the chief sweetness arises from the judicious and harmonious
pauses of the several periods of the verses; not to mention the
happy choice of the words, in which there is scarce one rough
consonant, many liquids, and those liquids soften'd with a mul∣titude
of vowels.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 25. <HI>Here sate</HI> Eumaeus, <HI>and his cares apply'd,</HI> &amp;c.]
I doubt not but this employment of <HI>Eumaeus</HI> has been another
cause of the mean character that has been form'd of his conditi∣on:
But this mistake arises from our judging of the dignity of
men from the employments they follow'd three thousand years
past, by the notions we have of those employments at present;
and because they are now only the occupation of the vulgar, we
imagine that they were so formerly: Kings and Princes in the
earlier ages of the world labour'd in arts and occupations, and
were above nothing that tended to promote the conveniencies
of life; they perform'd that with their own hands, which we
now perform by those of our servants: If this were not so, the
cookery of <HI>Achilles</HI> in the <HI>Iliad</HI> would equally disparage that
Heroe, as this employment would disgrace <HI>Eumaeus</HI> in the <HI>Odys∣sey:</HI>
Arts were then in their infancy, and were honourable to
the practisers: Thus <HI>Ulysses</HI> builds a vessel with his own hands,
as skilfully as a Shipwright.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="334"/>
Besides, even at this day Arts are in high esteem in the orien∣tal
world, and are practis'd by the greatest personages. Every
man in <HI>Turky</HI> is of some trade; Sultan <HI>Achmet</HI> was a maker
of Ivory Rings, which the <HI>Turks</HI> wear upon their thumbs
when they shoot their arrows, and in this occupation he
work'd several hours daily; and another of their Emperors was
depos'd, because he refus'd to work in his occupation.</P>
<P>It must be confess'd that our Translations have contributed to
give those who are unacquainted with the <HI>Greek,</HI> a mean Idea
of <HI>Eumaeus.</HI> This place is thus render'd by two of his Translators.
<Q><L>Himself there sate ord'ring a pair of brogues,</L>
<L>Of a py'd bullock's skin—</L></Q>
<Q><L>Himself was leather to his foot applying,</L>
<L>Made of a good cow-hide well coloured.</L></Q>
Whereas <HI>Homer</HI> is as lofty and harmonious, as these are flat and
inelegant.
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
'Tis true, a Translator in such places as these has an hard task;
a language like the <HI>Greek,</HI> which is always flowing, musical,
and sonorous, is very difficult to be imitated in other tongues,
especially where the corresponding words are not equally signifi∣cant
and graceful.</P>
<P>In short, the Reader is to consider this whole description as a
true picture of ancient life; and then he will not fail of the plea∣sure
of knowing how the great men of ancient times passed
their lives, and how those Heroes who perform'd such noble parts
on the public stage of life, acted in private when withdrawn from
notice and observation. Those ages retain'd an universal simplicity
of manners: <HI>Telemachus</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus</HI> have both dogs for their
<PB N="341" REF="335"/>
attendants; nay, and in later times before luxury prevail'd among
the <HI>Romans,</HI> we read of a Dictator brought from the plough,
to lead the bravest soldiers in the world to conquer it.</P>

<HI>Homer</HI> has been censur'd for representing his Heroe unworthily:
Is it probable that he who had met whole armies in battle,
should now throw away his staff out of fear of a dog? that he
should abandon his defence by casting himself on the ground,
and leave himself to his mercy? But <HI>Eustathius</HI> fully vindicates
<HI>Ulysses.</HI> It is a natural defence to avert the fury of a dog, to
cast away our weapons, to show that we intend him no violence.
<HI>Pliny</HI> has the like observation in the eighth book of his Natural
History: <HI>Impetus canum &amp; saevitia mitigatur ab homine, humi con∣sidente.</HI></P>
<P>All that <HI>Homer</HI> says of the dogs, is imitated by <HI>Theocritus, Idyll</HI>

What <HI>Homer</HI> speaks of <HI>Ulysses, Theocritus</HI> applies to <HI>Hercules;</HI> a

therefore inserted it in that Heroic <HI>Idyllium.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 37. <HI>Sudden, the master runs,</HI> &amp;c.] This is thought
to be an adventure that really happen'd to the Poet himself; it is
related in the life of <HI>Homer</HI> ascrib'd to <HI>Herodotus. Thestorides</HI> hav∣ing
persuaded <HI>Homer</HI> to permit him to transcribe his verses, he
immediately remov'd to <HI>Chios,</HI> and proclaim'd himself the Author:
<PB N="342" REF="336"/>
<HI>Homer</HI> being inform'd of it, set sail for <HI>Chios,</HI> and landing near
it, he was in danger of being torn in pieces by the dogs of <HI>Glau∣cus,</HI>
who protected him, and receiv'd him hospitably: The Poet
in return labour'd to reward his kindness, by relating to him the
most curious of his adventures that had happen'd in the course
of his voyages. When therefore (adds <HI>Dacier</HI>) we see <HI>Ulysses</HI> en∣tertain'd
by <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> we have the satisfaction of imagining we see
<HI>Homer</HI> himself in discourse with his courteous friend <HI>Glaucus.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 41.—<HI>Thus the faithful swain,</HI> &amp;c.] The words
in the <HI>Greek</HI> are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, literally render'd, <HI>the divine
swineherd,</HI> which are Burlesque in modern languages, and
would have been no less in <HI>Greek,</HI> if the person of <HI>Eumaeus</HI> had not
been honourable, and his office a station of dignity: For the sole
reason why such a translation would now be ridiculous, is because
such employments are now fall'n into contempt. Let any person
ask this question, Would <HI>Homer</HI> have apply'd the epithet <HI>divine</HI>
to a modern swineherd? If he would not, it is an evidence that
<HI>Eumaeus</HI> was a man of consequence, and his post a place of ho∣nour;
otherwise <HI>Homer</HI> would have been guilty of burlesquing his
own Poetry.</P>
<P><HI>Dacier</HI> very well remarks, that the words <HI>Eumaeus</HI> here speaks,
and indeed his whole conversation, shew him to be a person of
a good education, and of noble and pious sentiments: he discovers
a natural and flowing Eloquence, and appears to be a man of
great humanity and wisdom.</P>
<P>There is a peculiarity in <HI>Homer</HI>'s manner of apostrophizing <HI>Eu∣maeus,</HI>
and speaking of him in the second person; it is generally
apply'd by that Poet only to men of account and distinction,
and by it the Poet, as it were, addresses them with respect; thus
in the <HI>Iliad</HI> he introduces <HI>Menelaus,</HI>

This enlivens the diction, and awakens the attention of the Rea∣der.
<HI>Eustathius</HI> observes that <HI>Eumaeus</HI> is the only person of whom
<HI>Homer</HI> thus speaks in the whole <HI>Odyssey:</HI> No doubt (continues

The person who best understood the beauty of it, and
best explain'd the precepts it comprehends, was <HI>Epictetus,</HI> from

This passage has been greatly mistaken by almost all who have
translated <HI>Homer:</HI> the words at first view seem to imply that <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>
had given <HI>Eumaeus</HI> a wife, a house, and an inheritance; but
this is not the meaning. The words are thus to be render'd, “<HI>U∣lysses</HI>

and such things as an indulgent Master gives a faithful
<PB N="344" REF="338"/>
servant; namely a wife, inheritance, and an house:” These
gifts are to be apply'd to <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and not to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and the
sentence means that it is the custom of good Kings in that man∣ner
to reward their faithful servants. It is very evident from
<HI>Homer,</HI> that <HI>Ulysses</HI> had not yet given a Wife to <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> for he
promises him and <HI>Philaetius</HI> all these rewards, <HI>lib.</HI> 21. of the <HI>O∣dyssey.</HI>

It appears therefore that <HI>Eumaeus</HI> was not married, and therefore
this whole period is to be apply'd to the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and not
to <HI>Ulysses. Eustathius.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 122. <HI>Twelve herds, twelve flocks,</HI> &amp;c.] I have alrea∣dy
remark'd that <HI>Ulysses</HI> was a wealthy King, and this place is
an instance of it. He is master of twelve herds of Oxen, which
<PB N="345" REF="339"/>
probably amounted to fourteen thousand four hundred head; for
if we count the herds by the same way of computation as the
droves of swine, they will make that number, each drove con∣sisting
of twelve hundred; for tho' <HI>Homer</HI> mentions but three hun∣dred
and sixty boars, yet he tells us, the reason why they were in∣ferior
to the females was because of the luxury of the suitors. If
this be allow'd, then he had likewise the same number of sheep,
and as many hogs: for <HI>Eumaeus</HI> had the charge only of one herd,
eleven more were under the care of other officers: <HI>Ulysses</HI> like∣wise
had thirteen thousand two hundred goats. This will appear
to be a true calculation from the words of <HI>Homer,</HI> who tells us
that twenty of the greatest Heroes of the age were not so wealthy
as <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P>The old Poets and Historians to express a person of great riches
gave him the epithet of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
that is, “a person that had a great number of sheep or cattle,
or a person of great wealth:” This is likewise evident from
the holy Scriptures: <HI>David</HI> had his Officers, like <HI>Ulysses,</HI> to attend
his flocks and herds: Thus 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxvii. <HI>Jehonathan</HI> was set over
his treasures in the field, cities and villages; <HI>Shimei</HI> over his vine∣yards;
<HI>Zabdi</HI> over his wines; <HI>Baal-hanan</HI> over his olive trees, and
<HI>Joash</HI> over his oil: He had herdsmen that had charge over his
cattle, sheep, camels and asses. It was by cattle that the ancient
Kings enriched themselves from the earliest ages: Thus no less a
person than <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> a powerful King of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> gave <HI>Joseph</HI>
leave to appoint his brethren to be Rulers over his cattle; and
we read in all the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets, that the wealth of Kings origi∣nally
consisted in herds and flocks. They lose much of the plea∣sure
of <HI>Homer</HI> who read him only as a Poet: he gives us an ex∣act
Image of ancient life, their manners, customs, laws, and
Politics; and it must double our satisfaction, when we consider
that in reading <HI>Homer</HI> we are reading the most ancient Author
in the world, except the great Lawgiver <HI>Moses.</HI></P>

<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
In the former verse <HI>Eustathius</HI> tells us there is a various reading,
and judges that it ought to be written <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
and it must be allow'd that the repetition of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> gives
a greater emphasis to the words, and agrees better with the ve∣hemence
of the speaker in making his asseveration.</P>
<P>The latter verse in the obvious sense seems to mean that <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
would return in the space of a month, and so <HI>Eumaeus</HI> un∣derstood
<PB N="347" REF="341"/>
it; but in reality it means in the compass of a day.
<HI>Solon</HI> was the first who discover'd the latent sense of it, as <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI>
informs us; “<HI>Solon,</HI> says that Author, observing the ine∣quality
of the months, and that the Moon neither agreed with
the rising or setting of the Sun, but that often in the same
day she overtook and went before it, nam'd that same day <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>the old and new Moon;</HI> and allotted that part of the day
that preceded the Conjunction, to the old Moon, and the o∣ther
part of it to the new: from hence we may judge that
he was the first that comprehended the sense of this verse of
<HI>Homer,</HI>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
Accordingly he nam'd the following day, <HI>the day of the new
Moon. Ulysses</HI> then means that he will return on the last day of
the month, for on that day the Moon is both old and new; that
is, she finishes one month, and begins another.” This is taken
from the life of <HI>Solon;</HI> but whether the obvious sense in which
<HI>Eumaeus</HI> is suppos'd to understand it, or the latent meaning of <HI>So∣lon</HI>
be preferable, is submitted to the Reader's judgment; I confess
I see no occasion to have recourse to that mysterious explication:
What <HI>Ulysses</HI> intended was to certifie <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> that <HI>Ulysses</HI> would
assuredly return very speedily; and the verse will have this effect,
if it be understood literally and plainly; besides, <HI>Ulysses</HI> is to con∣tinue
in an absolute disguise, why then should he endanger a dis∣covery,
by using an ambiguous sentence, which might possibly
be understood; but if it was so dark that it was utterly unintel∣ligible
to <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> then it is used in vain, and a needless ambi∣biguity.</P>

<P>VERSE 229. <HI>Know then I came From sacred</HI> Crete.] This
whole narration is a notable instance of that artful dissimulation
so remarkable in the character of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and an evidence that
<PB N="348" REF="342"/>
<HI>Homer</HI> excellently sustains it thro' the whole Poem, for <HI>Ulysses</HI>
appears to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as he is represented in the first line,
throughout the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> This narrative has been both prais'd and
censur'd by the Critics, especially by <HI>Rapin;</HI> I will lay his obser∣vations
before the reader.</P>
<P>“<HI>Homer</HI> is guilty of verbosity, and of a tedious prolix man∣ner
of speaking: he is the greatest talker of all Antiquity: The
very <HI>Greeks,</HI> tho' chargeable with an excess this way above all
Nations, have reprehended <HI>Homer</HI> for his intemperance of
words; he is ever upon his Rehearsals, and not only of the
same words, but of the same things, and consequently is in a
perpetual circle of repetitions. 'Tis true he always speaks na∣turally,
but then he always speaks too much: His adventures
in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which he relates to <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> are truly idle imperti∣nent
stories, purely for amusement: there is no thread in his
discourse, nor does it seem to tend to any propos'd end, but
exceeds all bounds: that vast fluency of speech, and those
mighty overflowings of fancy, make him shoot beyond the
mark. Hence his draughts are too accurate, and leave no∣thing
to be perform'd by the imagination of the reader, a fault
which (as <HI>Cicero</HI> observes) <HI>Apelles</HI> found in the antient Pain∣ters.”
This objection is intended only against the fulness of
<HI>Homer</HI>'s expression, not against the subject of the Narration: for
<HI>Rapin</HI> in another place speaking of the beauties of <HI>Homer,</HI> gives
this very Story as an instance of his excellency: these are his
words,</P>
<P>“I shall say nothing of all the Relations which <HI>Ulysses</HI> makes
to <HI>Eumaeus</HI> upon his return to his Country, and his wonderful
management to bring about his Re-establishment; that whole
story is drest in colours so decent, and at the same time so
noble, that Antiquity can hardly match any part of the Nar∣ration.</P>
<P>If what <HI>Rapin</HI> remarks in the latter Period be true, <HI>Homer</HI> will
easily obtain a pardon for the fault of prolixity, imputed to him in
the aforemention'd objection. For who would be willing to retrench
one of the most decent and noble narrations of Antiquity, meerly
<PB N="349" REF="343"/>
for the length of it? But it may, perhaps, be true that this sto∣ry
is not impertinent, but well suited to carry on the design of
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> and consequently tends to a propos'd End: for in this
consists the strength of <HI>Rapin</HI>'s objection.</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident than that the whole success of <HI>Ulysses</HI>
depends upon his disguise; a discovery would be fatal to him, and at
once give a single unassisted person into the power of his enemies.
How then is this Disguise to be carried on? especially when <HI>Ulysses</HI>
in person is required to give an account of his own story? Must
it not be by assuming the name of another person, and giving
a plausible relation of his life, fortunes, and calamities, that brought
him to a strange country, where he has no acquaintance or friend?
This obliges him to be circumstantial, nothing giving a greater
air of probability than descending to particularities, and this
necessitates his prolixity. The whole relation is comprehended in
the compass of an hundred and seventy lines; and an Episode
of no greater length may not perhaps deserve to be call'd <HI>ver∣bose,</HI>
if compar'd with the length of the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> Nay, there
may be a reason given why it ought to be of a considerable
length: There is a pause in the action, while <HI>Minerva</HI> passes
from <HI>Ithaca,</HI> to <HI>Telemachus</HI> in <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> This interval is to be
fill'd up with some incident relating to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> until <HI>Telemachus</HI>
is prepar'd to return; for his assistance is necessary to re-establish
the affairs of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> This then is a time of leisure, and the Poet
fills it up with the narrations of <HI>Ulysses</HI> till the return of <HI>Telema∣chus,</HI>
and consequently there is room for a long relation. Be∣sides
(remarks <HI>Eustathius</HI>) <HI>Homer</HI> interests all men of all ages in
the story, by giving us pieces of true history, antient customs,
and exact descriptions of persons and places, instructive and de∣lightful
to all the world, and these incidents are adorn'd with all
the embellishments of Eloquence and Poetry.</P>

These Oaks of <HI>Dodona</HI> were held to be oraculous, and to be en∣dued
with speech, by the Antients; and Pigeons were suppos'd
to be the Priestesses of the Deity. <HI>Herodotus</HI> in <HI>Euterpe</HI> gives a
full account of what belongs to this Oracle, who tells us, that
he was inform'd by the Priestesses of <HI>Dodona,</HI> that two black
Pigeons flew away from <HI>Thebes</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and one of them perch∣ing
upon a Tree in <HI>Dodona,</HI> admonish'd the Inhabitants with an
human voice to erect an Oracle in that place to <HI>Jupiter.</HI> But
<HI>Herodotus</HI> solves this Fable after the following manner. “There
were two Priestesses carryed away from <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and one of
them was sold by the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> where she in her
servitude consecrated an Altar to <HI>Jupiter</HI> under an oak; the <HI>Do∣donaeans</HI>
gave her the name of a Pigeon, because she was a
<HI>Barbarian,</HI> and her speech at first no more understood than the
chattering of a Bird or Pigeon; but as soon as she had learn'd
the <HI>Greek</HI> tongue, it was presently reported that the Pigeon
spoke with an human Voice. She had the epithet <HI>Black,</HI> be∣cause
she was an <HI>Aegyptian.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> informs us, that <HI>Dodona</HI> was antiently a City of
<HI>Thesprotia,</HI> and in process of time the limits of it being chang'd,
it became of the country of the <HI>Molossians,</HI> that is, it lay be∣tween
<HI>Thessaly</HI> and <HI>Epirus:</HI> Near this city was a mountain nam'd
<HI>Tmarus</HI> or <HI>Tomourus;</HI> on this mountain there stood a Temple, and
within the precincts of it were these oraculous Oaks of <HI>Jupiter:</HI>
This was the most ancient Temple of <HI>Greece,</HI> according to <HI>He∣rodotus,</HI>
founded by the <HI>Pelasgians,</HI> and at first serv'd by Priests
call'd <HI>Selli;</HI> and the Goddess <HI>Dione</HI> being joyn'd with <HI>Jupiter</HI> in
the worship, the service was perform'd by three aged Priestesses,
call'd in the <HI>Molossian</HI> tongue <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as old men were call'd
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (perhaps from the corrupted word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or Ancients)
and the same word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifying also Pigeons, gave occasion
<PB N="352" REF="346"/>
to the fable of the Temple of <HI>Dodona</HI> having Doves for Priestes∣ses.
But if, as <HI>Herodotus</HI> affirms, the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> sold this Priestess
of <HI>Jupiter</HI> originally to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> it is probable they were
called Doves, after the <HI>Phoenician</HI> language, in which the same
word with a small alteration signifies both a Dove and a Priest∣ess.
See Note on <HI>Odyssey</HI> 12.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> gives us another solution of this difficulty, and tells
us that as there were <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Augurs,</HI> who drew predicti∣ons
from the flight and gestures of Crows; so there were o∣thers
who predicted from observations made upon Doves: and
from hence these Doves were called the Prophetesses of <HI>Dodona,</HI>
that being the way by which the decrees of the Gods were dis∣cover'd
by the Augurs.</P>
<P>I have remark'd that the Temple of <HI>Dodona</HI> stood upon the
mountain <HI>Timourus,</HI> hence the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> came to signify
those Oracles, and thus <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is used by <HI>Lycophron.</HI> Now

<HI>Strabo</HI> therefore instead of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> reads <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; for, observes
that Author, the Oracles, not the Laws, of <HI>Jupiter</HI> are preserv'd
at <HI>Dodona.
Eustathius.</HI></P>
<P>But whence arose the Fable of these oaks being vocal? I doubt
not but this was an illusion of those who gave out the oracles to
the people: They conceal'd themselves within the cavities or
hollow of the oaks, and from thence deliver'd their Oracles;
and imposing by this method upon the superstition and credu∣lity
of those ages, persuaded the world that the Gods gave a
voice and utterance to the Oaks.</P>

It may appear at first view as if <HI>Eumaeus</HI> thought his absence from
the court an aggravation to his calamities, but this is not his
meaning: He speaks thus to prevent <HI>Ulysses</HI> from asking him to
introduce him immediately to <HI>Penelope;</HI> and this is the reason why
he enlarges upon the story of the <HI>Aetolian,</HI> who had deceiv'd him
by raising his expectations of the immediate return of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P>It is remarkable that almost all these fictions are made by
<HI>Cretans,</HI> or have some relation to the Island of the <HI>Cretans;</HI>
Thus <HI>Ulysses</HI> feigns himself to be of <HI>Crete,</HI> and this <HI>Aetolian</HI> lays
the Scene of his falsehood in the same Island: which, as <HI>Eusta∣thius</HI>
observes, may possibly be a latent Satyr upon that People,

<P>This Sacrifice being different from any other in <HI>Homer,</HI> I will

It may be ask'd why <HI>Eumaeus</HI> allots part of the Victim to <HI>Mer∣cury</HI>
and the Nymphs, since there is nothing of the like nature
to be found in the whole <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey?</HI> This is done in com∣pliance
to the place and person of <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> whose employment
lies in the Country, and who has the care of the Herds of <HI>U∣lysses;</HI>
he therefore offers to the Nymphs, as they are the Pre∣sidents
of the Fountains, Rivers, Groves, and furnish sustenance
and food for Cattle: And <HI>Mercury</HI> was held by the Ancients to
be the Patron of Shepherds: thus <HI>Simonides,</HI>

<HI>Eustathius</HI> adds (from whom this is taken) that <HI>Mercury</HI> was a lu∣crative
God, and therefore <HI>Eumaeus</HI> sacrifices to him for increase
of his Herds: or because he was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and like <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
Master of all the arts of Cunning and Dissimulation, and then
<HI>Eumaeus</HI> may be understood to offer to him for the safety of <HI>U∣lysses,</HI>
that he might furnish him with artifice to bring him in se∣curity
to his Country; and we see this agrees with his prayer.</P>
<P>What <HI>Dacier</HI> adds is yet more to the purpose: <HI>Eumaeus</HI> joyns
<HI>Mercury</HI> with the Nymphs because he was Patron of Flocks,
and the Ancients generally plac'd the figure of a Ram at the
<PB N="358" REF="352"/>
base of his Images, sometimes he is represented carrying a
Ram upon his Arms, sometimes upon his Shoulders: In short,
it suffices that he was esteem'd a rural Deity, to make the Sacri∣fice
proper to be offer'd to him by a person whose occupation
lay in the Country.</P>

which mention is made of Slaves bought with Money. The <HI>Ta∣phians</HI>
liv'd in a small Island adjacent to <HI>Ithaca; Mentes</HI> was
King of it, as appears from the first of the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> They were
generally Pirates, and are suppos'd to have had their name from
their way of living, which in the <HI>Phoenician</HI> tongue (as <HI>Bochart</HI>
observes) signifies Rapine; <HI>Hataph,</HI> and by contraction <HI>Taph,</HI> bear∣ing
that signification.</P>
<P>Frequent use has been made of <HI>Phoenician</HI> interpretations thro'
the course of these Notes, and perhaps it may be judg'd necessa∣ry
to say something why they may be suppos'd to give names
to Countries and Persons, more than any other Nation.</P>
<P>They are reported to be the inventors of Letters, <HI>Lucan</HI> lib. 3.
<Q><L>Phoenices primi, famae si creditur, ausi</L>

<HI>The first who used Navigation, the first who traffick'd by the Ocean.</HI>
If we put these two qualities together, it is no wonder that a
great number of places were call'd by <HI>Phoenician</HI> Names: for
<PB N="359" REF="353"/>
they being the first Navigators, must necessarily discover a mul∣titude
of Islands, Countries arid Cities, to which they would
be oblig'd to give names when they describ'd them: And nothing
is so probable as that they gave those names according to the
observations they made upon the Nature of the several Countries,
or employment of the Inhabitants. In the present instance, the
<HI>Taphians</HI> being remarkable Pirates, (as appears from <HI>Homer,</HI>

the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> who first discover'd this Island, call'd it <HI>Taph,</HI> the
Island of Pirates. Places receive appellations according to the
language of the Discoverer, and generally from observations
made upon the People. It will add a weight to this supposi∣tion,
if we remember that <HI>Homer</HI> was well acquainted with
the traditions and customs of the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> for he speaks
frequently of that People through the course of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>

<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 510. Now came the Night.—</L>
<L>—the winds began to roar; <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<HI>Eustathius</HI> observes that <HI>Homer</HI> introduces the following story by
a very artful connection, and makes it as it were grow out of
the subject: the coldness of the present Season brings to his mind
a time like it, when he lay before <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P>It is remarkable that almost all Poets have taken an opportu∣nity
to give long descriptions of the Night; <HI>Virgil, Statius,
Apollonius, Tasso,</HI> and <HI>Dryden,</HI> have enlarg'd upon this Subject:
<HI>Homer</HI> seems industriously to have avoided it: perhaps he judg'd
such descriptions to be no more than excrescencies, and at best
but beautiful superfluities. A modern Hypercritick thinks
Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> to have excell'd all the Poets in this point.
<PB N="360" REF="354"/>
<Q><L>All things are hush'd as Nature's self lay dead,</L>
<L>The mountains seem to nod their drowzy head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
The last Verse is translated from <HI>Statius,</HI>
<Q>Et simulant fessos curvata cacumina somnos.</Q>
which I mention only to propose it to consideration, whe∣ther
<HI>cacumina</HI> must in this place of necessity signify the Tops of
Mountains; why may it not be apply'd, as it is frequently, to
the Tops of the Trees? I question whether the nodding of a
Mountain, or the appearance of its nodding, be a natural Image:
whereas if we understand it of the Trees, the difficulty vanishes,
and the meaning will be much more easy, that the very Trees
seem to nod, as in sleep.</P>
<P>I beg the Reader's patience to mention another Verse of <HI>Sta∣tius,</HI>
that has undoubtedly been mistaken.
<Q><L>Qualis ubi audito venantum murmure Tigris,</L>
<L>Horruit in maculas.</L></Q>
Which <HI>Cowley</HI> renders,
<Q><L>—he swells with angry pride,</L>
<L>And calls forth all his spots on every side.</L></Q>
In which sense also the Author of the <HI>Spectator</HI> quotes it from
<HI>Cowley.</HI> But it is impossible to imagine that the hair of any
creature can change into spots; and if any creature could change
it by anger, would not the spots remain when the passion was
over? The assertion is absolutely against nature, and matter of
fact; and as absurd as to affirm that the hair of a Tiger blushes.
This mistake arises from the double sense of the word <HI>Maculae,</HI>
which signifies also the <HI>Meshes</HI> of a <HI>Net,</HI> as any common Dicti∣onary
will inform us. So <HI>Tully, Reticulum minutis maculis;</HI> Colu∣mella,
<PB N="361" REF="355"/>
<HI>Rete grandi macula;</HI> Ovid, <HI>Distinctum maculis rete.</HI> This
way the sense is obvious: no wonder that a Tiger when enclo∣sed
in the toils should <HI>horrere in maculas,</HI> or erect his hair when
he flies against the Meshes, endeavouring to escape; and it a∣grees
with the nature of that animal, to roughen his hair when
he is angry. I beg the Reader's pardon for all this, but the
mention of a Hypercritick was infecting, and led me into it un∣awares.</P>

<P>VERSE 540. <HI>I left behind my cloak,</HI> &amp;c.] To understand
this passage, we must remember that in those eastern regions, af∣ter
very hot days an extream cold night would sometimes suc∣ceed,
even with frost and snow, contrary to the usual order of
the season: If it had been winter, no doubt <HI>Ulysses</HI> would have
arm'd himself against the nocturnal cold, and not have been
reduc'd to such an extremity.</P>
<P>There is one incident in this story that seems extraordinary,
<HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Menelaus</HI> are said to form an ambush under the very
walls of <HI>Troy,</HI> and yet are describ'd to be sleeping while they thus
form it: The words are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> does not necessari∣ly
signify to be asleep, as is already prov'd from the conclusion
of the first <HI>Iliad:</HI> But here it must have that import, for <HI>Ulysses</HI>
tells his companions that he has had an extraordinary dream.
Besides, even a tendency towards sleep should be avoided by
soldiers in an ambuscade, especially by the leaders of it: The
only answer that occurs to me, is that perhaps they had Centi∣nels
waking while they slept; but even this would be unsoldier-like
in our ages.</P>

<P><PB N="362" REF="356"/>
The word in the <HI>Greek</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which it is impossible
to translate without a circumlocution: It paints (observes <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI>)
exactly the dress of a beggar, and the difficulty he labours

how a beggar is embarrassed in the act of covering his body, by
reason of the rents in his cloaths.</P>

<P>VERSE 581. <HI>For here one vest suffices ev'ry swain.</HI>] It is not
at first view evident why <HI>Ulysses</HI> requests a change of rayment from
<HI>Eumaeus,</HI> for a better dress would only have expos'd him to the dan∣ger
of a discovery. Besides, this would have been a direct opposi∣tion
to the injunctions of the Goddess of Wisdom, who had not
only disguis'd him in the habit of a beggar, but chang'd his fea∣tures
to a conformity with it. Why then should he make this pe∣tition?
The answer is, to carry on his disguise the better before
<HI>Eumaeus;</HI> he has already told him that he was once a person of
dignity, tho' now reduced to poverty by calamities: and consequent∣ly
a person who had once known better fortunes would be un∣easy
under such mean circumstances, and desire to appear like him∣self;
therefore he asks a better dress, that <HI>Eumaeus</HI> may believe his
former story.</P>
<P>What <HI>Eumaeus</HI> speaks of not having many changes of garments,
is not a sign of poverty, but of the simplicity of the manners
of those ages. It is the character of the luxurious, vain <HI>Phaeaci∣ans,</HI>
to delight in changes of dress, and agrees not with this
plain, sincere, industrious <HI>Ithacan, Eumaeus.</HI></P>
<P>I wonder this last part of the relation of <HI>Ulysses</HI> has escap'd
the censure of the Critics: The circumstance of getting the
Cloak of <HI>Thoas</HI> in the cold Night, tho' it shows the artifice of
<HI>Ulysses</HI> essential to his Character, yet perhaps may be thought un∣worthy
the Majesty of Epic Poetry, where every thing ought to
be great and magnificent. It is of such a nature as to raise a
<PB N="363" REF="357"/>
smile, rather than admiration, and <HI>Virgil</HI> has utterly rejected such
levities. Perhaps it may be thought that <HI>Ulysses</HI> adapts himself
to <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> and endeavours to engage his favour by that piece
of pleasantry; yet this does not solve the objection, for <HI>Eumaeus</HI>
is not a person of a low Character: no one in the <HI>Odyssey</HI> speaks
with better Sense, or better Morality. One would almost imagine
that <HI>Homer</HI> was sensible of the weakness of this Story, he in∣troduces
it so artfully: He tells us in a short Preface, that Wine
unbends the most serious and wise Person, and makes him laugh,
dance, and speak without his usual caution: And then he pro∣ceeds
to the fable of his ambush before <HI>Troy.</HI> But no introducti∣on
can reconcile it to those who think such Comic relations
should not at all be introduc'd into Epic Poetry.</P>
