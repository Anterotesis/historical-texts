<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS small Treatise was
originally intended for a
private Paper of Instru∣ctions
to the</HI> GENTLEMAN, <HI>whose
Name it bears, to direct Him how
to manage himself under the</HI> Gout.
<HI>It is, indeed, an Abstract of a
larger one, on the same Subject,
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
which has lain by me these seven
Years; which, yet, I have not
had Leisure or Humour to finish.
Several Copies of this having got
Abroad, and the pitiful Condes∣cendence
of Pyrating Booksellers,
even to such Trifles as these,
have constrain'd me to let it come
out in Print, as it is, to pre∣vent
its coming out from them.
The Gentlemen of the Profession
may easily perceive, by the Gross∣ness
of the Philosophy, and the
low Detail of the Pharmacy, it
was not design'd for them. If
any shall think fit to dispute or
criticise on the</HI> Doctrine <HI>here
laid down, they may do it secure∣ly,
as if the</HI> Author <HI>were as much
dead, as these his Labours will
shortly be: I hope I know the
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
Value of Time and Pains, and
the Vanity of all Human Specula∣tions
better, than to employ them
in defending such Trifles. All I
undertake for them, is, That the
Facts may be depended upon for
their Truth. And the Method
and Medicines for their Efficacy,
towards the End, in the Circum∣stances
propos'd. If any Person
under them, shall either amuse him∣self,
by reading this Paper; or
lighten his Pain, by following its
Directions, I shall have obtain'd
all I propos'd by it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the Account of the</HI> Bath
Waters <HI>given here, it came natu∣rally
in the way of my Subject; and
is such as the Observations I have
made suggested to me. I scarce
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
know, and have taken no Notice
of what others may have writ∣ten
or observ'd on these Waters;
nor, indeed, had it been possible
for me, in my present Situation,
being without my Books, and con∣fin'd
to Bounds, by the Nature of
my Design. I have often observ'd,
with Admiration, the Wisdom and
Goodness of Providence, in fur∣nishing
so wonderful an Antidote,
to almost all the</HI> Chronical <HI>Dis∣tempers
of an</HI> English <HI>Constitu∣tion
and Climate, which are chiefly
owing to Errors of Diet, or ra∣ther,
as a Sacred Writer expres∣ses
it, To</HI> Idleness and Fulness of
Bread. <HI>The Rankness of the Soil;
the Richness of the Provisions; the
living so much on Flesh Meats; the
Inconstancy of the Weather, and
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
the indulging in sedentary Amuse∣ments,
or speculative Studies, di∣rectly
leading thereto. To Reme∣dy

<LIST>
<ITEM><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Introduction. <HI>Page</HI> 1. §. 1.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the reason why, of two Persons in
all other Circumstances the same, the
one has the <HI>Gout,</HI> the other is free from
it, is, That the <HI>small Vessels</HI> of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person
in their <HI>original Conformation</HI> are narrower and
more stiff than those of the other. <HI>p.</HI> 2. §. 2.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>Cause</HI> of an acquir'd <HI>Gout</HI> in the first
Person, or those born of sound Parents; is the
abundance of <HI>Tartarous, Urinous,</HI> or other <HI>Salts</HI>
introduc'd into the Blood by the Food. <HI>p.</HI> 3. §. 3.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we learn the reason why, on the first At∣tacks
of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in otherwise healthy People,
the Humours generally fall on the Joints of the
Limbs. <HI>p.</HI> 4. §. 4.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may likewise see the reason, why the first
<HI>Fits</HI> enrage and remit once in twenty four Hours:
why the whole <HI>Fit</HI> lasts fourteen Days; and
lastly, why the <HI>Accesses</HI> and <HI>Remissions</HI> of those
broken with the <HI>Gout,</HI> happen only in fourteen
Days: And why the whole <HI>Duration</HI> in such
is made up of several such <HI>Accesses</HI> and <HI>Remis∣sions. p.</HI> 5. §. 5.</ITEM>
<PB REF="8"/>
<ITEM>Hence we may discover the reason why <HI>Gouty</HI> Per∣sons
are People of good natural 'Parts, large
Feeders, and long-liv'd. <HI>p.</HI> 6. §. 6.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may conclude, that a <HI>Fit</HI> of the <HI>Gout</HI>
is an Effort of Nature to throw off this abun∣dance
of Salts, through the more stiff and nar∣row
<HI>Strainers;</HI> or we may consider it as a <HI>Crisis</HI>
of a putrid Fever, where the noxious Humour
is discharg'd on some of the Muscles or Joints.
<HI>Ibid.</HI> §. 7.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may discover the Vanity of all Preten∣ders
to an <HI>universal</HI> and certain Remedy for the
<HI>Gout. p.</HI> 9. §. 8.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence there can be but two direct ways of treat∣ing
the <HI>Gout;</HI> one by widening the Capacities
of the <HI>small Vessels;</HI> the other by lessening the
Quantity of the <HI>Salts. Ibid.</HI> §. 9.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Difference between <HI>Hereditary</HI> and <HI>Acquir'd
Gouts. p.</HI> 10. §. 10.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From hence is concluded the Necessity of a much
more strict Management in an <HI>Hereditary</HI> than
in an <HI>Acquir'd Gout. p.</HI> 11. §. 11.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Advantages of Labour and Exercise in the
<HI>Gout;</HI> to which however, two Conditions must
be added: 1. That it be not too violent: 2. That
a moderate Diet be joined to it. <HI>Ibid.</HI> §. 12.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Two ways of lessening the Quantity of <HI>Salts</HI> in the
Blood. The first by a Vegetable Diet, and the
Inconveniencies thereof. <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s Diet re∣commended.
<HI>p.</HI> 13. §. 13.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The other way is by <HI>Evacuations</HI> in the Intervals,
and by a gentle slow Perspiration in the Fits.
<HI>p.</HI> 15. §. 14.</ITEM>
<PB REF="9"/>
<ITEM>The <HI>Secondary</HI> Methods of relieving the <HI>Gout</HI> are
two: 1. <HI>Dilution</HI> by proper Liquids, such as
<HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>German Spaa</HI> Water, or other <HI>Chaly∣beat</HI>
Waters; <HI>Dwarf Elder Ten, Trifoil Tea,</HI>
light, quick <HI>Green Tea,</HI> small <HI>Spicy Bitters</HI> on
Water, and the like. <HI>p.</HI> 17. § 15.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Strengthners of the Instruments of <HI>Digestion:</HI>
The <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark especially; where its Vir∣tues
and Qualities are explain'd. <HI>p.</HI> 18. §. 16.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Advantages of <HI>Mercurial</HI> Medicines in the
<HI>Gout</HI> consider'd. A <HI>Salivation</HI> will banish the
<HI>Gout</HI> for some time; but then it tears and rends
the small <HI>Fibres,</HI> whereby the future Fits become
more painful and obstinate. <HI>p.</HI> 20. §. 17.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Method by which one is to treat himself under
the Fit, in its beginning, middle and end. <HI>p.</HI> 23.
§. 18.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Opiats</HI> not to be given in the <HI>Gout,</HI> but in the last
Extremity; with two ways of ordering Forms
of such Medicines. <HI>p.</HI> 25. §. 19.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The manner of treating the <HI>Gouty</HI> after the Pain
is over: <HI>Stomach</HI> Purgers first, then <HI>Asses</HI> Milk
is recommended; and lastly, <HI>Spaa</HI> or <HI>Bath</HI> Waters
with <HI>Aromatick</HI> Bitters. <HI>p.</HI> 27. §. 20.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Rhubarb</HI> recommended as an excellent Preservative
from the <HI>Gout,</HI> taken in the Intervals of the
Fits; with the Reasons thereof. <HI>p.</HI> 28. §. 21.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The manner of using <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> with other <HI>succeda∣neous</HI>
Purgatives, in case of its disagreeing.
<HI>p.</HI> 30. §. 22.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sulphur,</HI> and its <HI>Flowers</HI> recommended as the most
noble of all Medicines, for the Cure of the
<HI>Gout,</HI> with the Reasons thereof; its Nature
<PB REF="10"/>
and Qualities, and the manner of using it
<HI>p.</HI> 32. §. 23.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Several <HI>Diluters</HI> recommended, especially a weak
Decoction of the <HI>Bark</HI> of the Root of <HI>Sarsa;</HI> with Observations
on <HI>Rosclli</HI>'s Drops; and the <HI>Fa∣mous
Pox Doctor's</HI> Medicines. <HI>p.</HI> 37. §. 24.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Drinking freely of light, clear <HI>Spring Water</HI> of
great use after Intemperance in <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons.

<HEAD>SOME SHORT
OBSERVATIONS
Concerning the due
METHOD
Of Treating the
GOUT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I. <SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>Esigning this Paper for the
Instruction and Relief of my
particular Friend, I shall on∣ly
make such Observations,
as directly tend to that Purpose; Passing
by all <HI>Theories</HI> of the Distemper, as
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
far as is consistent with giving the Rea∣son
of my Opinions. For after having
laid down two <HI>Propositions</HI> (which will
be found the Principles of my Reason∣ing
through this Discourse) I proceed
to the Observations themselves.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Prop.</HI> 1. Of two Men having all
other Circumstances alike, as near as
may be; Of the same Parents; Born
Healthy; Of the same Stature, Com∣plexion,
Diet, Air, Exercise, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It
seems to me impossible to assign a solid
Reason, why the One shou'd be afflicted
with the <HI>Gout,</HI> the Other be absolutely
free from it, but this, That the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capillaries.</NOTE> smallest
Vessels of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person must be in
their natural<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Make.</NOTE> Conformation narrower
and more<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tense.</NOTE> stiff, than those of the Other,
who is free from the <HI>Gout,</HI> in respect of
their common Stature and Size. For
thereby the Crude and Gross Humours,
which are confin'd, or pass with Pain, in
the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person, will easily flee off by
<PB N="3" REF="15"/>
Perspiration, and the other Drains of
the Body, in the Person free from the
<HI>Gout.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Prop.</HI> 2. The Cause of an Ac∣quir'd
<HI>Gout</HI> in the first Person, or in
those born of sound Parents, seems to
me, to be the Abundance of Tarta∣rous,
Urinous, or other Salts, intro∣duc'd
into the Blood by the Food. Salts
seem neither to perish, nor to be be∣gotten;
but to be constant and incor∣ruptible
Parts of Animal and Vegetable
Bodies. The Delicacy and Flavour of
Flesh and Fish, is entirely owing to their
abounding with a fine, soft, oyly, or uri∣nous
Salt, as is evident in Venison and
Wild Fowl. Wines, of all kinds, have a
greater or lesser Quantity of Tartar in
them: And other strong Liquors abound
in their peculiar Salts, in Proportion
to their Strength. Spirits are nothing
but a great Quantity of Vegetable Salts
crowded together in a little Water and
Oyl. These Salts receiv'd in abun∣dance,
but neither sufficiently broke by
<PB N="4" REF="16"/>
the Digestive Powers, nor driven out
of the Habit by due Exercise; but by
their Plenty and Nearness, uniting in
greater Clusters, must necessarily form
Obstructions, and give Pain, when, by
the Force of the Circulation, they are
thrust through narrower and stiffer
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capillaries.</NOTE> small Vessels. Nothing either re∣ceiv'd
or bred within the Body, besides
these Salts, can account for this Dif∣ference.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 1. Hence we may learn
the Reason why, on the first Attacks of
the <HI>Gout,</HI> in otherwise healthy People,
the Humours generally fall on the Joints
of the Limbs: Because, in the Joints, the
smallest Vessels are more compress'd, by
the larger Heads or Protuberancy of the
Bones, and are thereby render'd narrow∣er
and more readily obstructed. These
Obstructions fall on the Joints of the
Limbs; because of the greater Length
of these small Vessels, between the
Heart, the Origin of the Motion of all
<PB N="5" REF="17"/>
the Fluids, and these Joints; their other
Extremity: Whereby the Quickness of
the Circulation diminishing, Obstruc∣tions
are there more readily form'd.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Corroll.</HI> 2. Hence likewise we may
see the Reason, why the first Fits, of
otherwise healthy Persons, Enrage and
Remit once in Four and twenty Hours.
The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When it begins to enrage.</NOTE> Access being at Sun-set, and the
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When it begins
to be easier.</NOTE> Remission about Day-break. Why
the whole Fit in such lasts about Four∣teen
Days. And lastly, why the par∣ticular
Accesses and Remissions, of Per∣sons
advanc'd in Years, and broken
with the <HI>Gout,</HI> happen only once in
Fourteen Days. And why the whole
Duration of the Fit is made up of seve∣ral
such Accesses and Remissions in equal
Times. In the first Stages of the <HI>Gout,</HI>
the Fluids being less Sizy and Glutinous,
their Salts and Siziness are sooner broken
and dissolv'd, by the Action of the So∣lids
in the Circulation; and are there∣by
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="5" REF="19"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="20"/>
by sooner brought into a Condition to
be carry'd off by Perspiration; which
makes an Access and a Remission. The
greater Weight and Grossness of the Air
(which hinders Perspiration) at Sun-set,
beyond what it is at Day-break, toge∣ther
with the particular Degree of Sizi∣ness,
seems to determine the Times.
The greater Degree of Siziness in the
Fluids, of People advanc'd in Years,
and broken with the <HI>Gout,</HI> lengthens
out the Duration of these Accesses
and Remissions. And the precise Pe∣riod
of Fourteen Days, seems to arise
from the special Nature of the Siziness
of the Fluids; and its Resemblance to
that of a Regular intermittent Fever.
The whole Duration of whose Fits put
together, <HI>Sydenham</HI> has observ'd alrea∣dy,
to be equal to Fourteen Days. But
the particular Explication of all these
Things, wou'd require more Room than
can be allow'd them, in the Bounds I
have prescrib'd to my self. My Friend,
if he pleases, may consult <HI>Bellini</HI> on
this Head.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="21"/>
VI. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 3. Hence we may disco∣ver
the Reason of the common Obser∣vation,
that Gouty Persons are People
of good Natural Parts, large Feeders,
and long-liv'd: Because the Fibres of
the smallest Vessels, being more stiff
and springy than ordinary, the Circu∣lation
is brisker, more full and free:
whereby the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>That is Eating, Digesting, and Evacuating,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> Natural Functions are
more readily and regularly perform'd;
and therein the best Health and truest
Sensations consist: Strong Health re∣quires
liberal Supplies; and both toge∣ther
lengthen out Life.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 4. From these also, we
may discover what a Fit of the Gout is,
to wit, An Effort of Nature, to throw
off this Abundance of Salts, through
more stiff and narrow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Secretory Ducts.</NOTE> Strainers. Salts
of all Kinds are more or less<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Caustick.</NOTE> Burning:
The Urinous most of all, as is evident
from <HI>Spanish</HI> Flies, and that unextin∣guishable
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
Substance, call'd the <HI>Phosphe∣ros,</HI>
so readily and plentifully to be had
from Human Urine. (The Reason of
which may be from their pointed Figure,
piercing more readily, by its being be∣smear'd
with a light Oyl: Or from their
greater attractive Force; or from some
other Quality, not yet, or perhaps ne∣ver
to be discover'd.) What is certain
is this, That Persons of a large Appe∣tite,
as <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons generally are,
feeding plentifully of Flesh and Fish, and
drinking liberally of generous Wines,
or other strong Liquors, and using,
either too little, or too much Exercise,
must necessarily overstock their Blood
with these fix'd and incorruptible Parts
of Animal and Vegetable Bodies; which
in their Nature being Hard and Burn∣ing,
can't fail, first, to raise a Tumult
and Fever; and then to give violent
Pain, as they are driven out of the Ha∣bit,
through more stiff and narrow small
Vessels, by the Force of the Circulation:
So that a Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI> may be consi∣der'd,
as a <HI>Crisis</HI> of a putrid Fever,
<PB N="9" REF="23"/>
wherein the noxious Humour is thrown
upon some of the Muscles or Joints of
the Body.</P>
<P>VIII. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 5. Hence we may dis∣cover
the Vanity of the Pretenders, to
a certain and universal Remedy for the
<HI>Gout.</HI> For unless a Remedy could be
found, which at once cou'd change and
new-mould the solid Parts of Human
Bodies; alter the Nature and Qualities
of Animal and Vegetable Bodies; and
destroy Parts, that are in their own
Nature fix'd and permanent, it is im∣possible
it shou'd be certain and univer∣sal;
and how possible such a Remedy is,
I leave every one to judge.</P>
<P>IX. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 6. Hence it is evident,
there can be only two direct Ways of
Treating the <HI>Gout,</HI> with any Prospect
of Success. The one is, by stretching
and widening the Capacities of the small
Vessels, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Slackning.</NOTE> relaxing their <HI>Fibres.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="24"/>
The other is, by lessening the Quanti∣ty
of the Salts introduc'd into the Fluids
by the Food; these being the two An∣tidotes
or Opposites to the two funda∣mental
Causes of acquir'd <HI>Gouts.</HI></P>
<P>X. Here it may be convenient to
take notice of the Difference between
hereditary and acquir'd <HI>Gouts.</HI> The
latter is produc'd in a Person, otherwise
sound, from Ignorance or Negligence
of the exact Rules of living. For tho'
there be a natural Configuration of Parts,
that disposes one Man more than ano∣ther
to the <HI>Gout;</HI> yet there might be a
Method of Diet order'd, which shou'd
prevent it. The former is a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stain</NOTE> Taint
(compounded perhaps of Scurvy, Stone
and Pox) transmitted to the Patient
with the Principles of Life, together
with a Disposition in this Taint, to
unite it self to any Malignity, intro∣duc'd
into the Habit, through Ex∣cesses.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="25"/>
XI. <HI>Coroll.</HI> Hence we may observe
the Necessity of a much more strict
and careful Management, in hereditary
<HI>Gouts,</HI> than what is necessary in acquir'd
ones. In the first, the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour is
ingrain'd and transubstantiated into the
Solids, and other Principles of Life,
and impossible to be rooted out by hu∣man
Art and Industry: The most that
can be done is, to lessen and relieve the
Symptoms. Whereas in acquir'd <HI>Gouts,</HI>
the noxious Humour being more con∣fin'd
to the Fluids, a proper Diet, due
Exercise, and a few well-chosen Reme∣dies,
may go a great way; if not to a
perfect Cure, yet to make Life tolera∣bly
easy under them.</P>
<P>XII. Of all those things that a <HI>Gouty</HI>
Person can safely undertake for his
Health, wisely manag'd Exercise, seems
that alone, which can best answer one
part of the first Intention, <HI>viz.</HI> The
widening the Capacities of the small
Vessels. Labour or Exercise assists the
<PB N="12" REF="26"/>
<HI>Gouty</HI> three different ways: <HI>First,</HI> as it
increases the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Intestine Motion.</NOTE> Motion of the Parts of
the Fluids among themselves; so that
their Salts, by their<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Collision.</NOTE> striking one a∣gainst
another, are broken and made
less, that they may pass more readily
through the small Vessels. <HI>Secondly,</HI>
as it adds a new and <HI>foreign</HI> Force to
the Blood, and thereby promotes its
Circulation from the Heart through the
small Vessels; driving some of the gros∣ser
Parts of the Fluids through them,
which in the ordinary Course of the Cir∣culation
wou'dn't pass so freely; and
thereby opening their Obstructions and
enlarging their Capacities. <HI>Thirdly,</HI>
as it increases the natural Perspiration;
the Action of the Muscles in Labour
and Exercise, and the Spring of the So∣lids
by their multiply'd Efforts, squeez∣ing
the Strainers of all their Contents.
But to make Labour and Exercise as use∣ful
as they may be, two Cautions must
be added to them: <HI>First,</HI> that they be
<PB N="13" REF="27"/>
not too violent, in respect of the Pa∣tient.
For too violent Exercise will,
necessarily, either spend the Spirits,
whereby the Digestions and Circulation
will be impair'd; and so a regular <HI>Gout</HI>
be brought into an irregular one: Or
by shaking all the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts at once
upon the Extremities, a regular Fit will
be forc'd out; which, in less violent
Exercise, might have been spent by Per∣spiration.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> that Moderation
in eating and drinking be join'd to it;
For commonly <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons are large
Feeders; and Exercise emptying the
Stomach, the Guts and small Vessels,
if the Appetite be satisfy'd to its Crav∣ing,
the Evil is rather increas'd than di∣minish'd
thereby.</P>
<P>XIII. There be two direct Ways of
lessening the Quantity of the Salts, which
produce the <HI>Gout.</HI> The first is, by a
total Abstinence from, or a great Ab∣stemiousness
in Flesh, Fish and strong
Liquors, which introduce those Salts
into human Fluids. But this Course is
<PB N="14" REF="28"/>
never to be undertaken, but with great
Caution, and in the last Extremity: For
these two Reasons; <HI>First,</HI> because an
entire Vegetable Diet weakens all the
digestive Powers, and all the Functions
of Life; impoverishes the whole Mass
of the Fluids; impairs the Strength,
and dispirits the Man: And thereby ne∣cessarily
begets the worst kind of Hyste∣rical
and Hypocondriacal Disorders,
and all their black and dismal Conse∣quences
(at least till the Body has been
long accustom'd to it) which is a Dis∣ease
far worse than the <HI>Gout</HI> it self: And
to which the <HI>Gout</HI> only brings the Pa∣tient,
in its last and fatal Stages. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
because this Diet, once enter'd
upon, is never after to be chang'd, un∣der
the Danger of certain Death, or
the most violent enraging of all the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Symptoms. For a Vegetable
Diet, as has been just now hinted, weak∣ening
the Digestive Powers, and all the
Functions of Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Patient can
never after be brought to bear with a
free way of living, without the Hazard
<PB N="15" REF="29"/>
of certain Death, or a violent enraging
of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Symptoms; as is too plain
from many<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Life of the P. of <HI>Conde.</HI></NOTE> fatal Instances. If any
Diet is ever to be try'd in the <HI>Gout,</HI> it
is to be order'd in <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s Method;
that is, by living on the white Foods;
eating Flesh and Fish of the lightest Di∣gestion,
and drinking generous, un∣mix'd
Wines, both of them in small,
and constantly equal Quantities; in
Weight and Measure; under the Crav∣ing,
of the Appetite, and proportion'd
for the mere Support of Life.</P>
<P>XIV. The other direct way of ba∣nishing
the Salts out of the Habit is by
Evacuations. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> otherwise a
most accurate Observer of Nature, and
a most judicious Practitioner, has been
the Occasion, I think, of a great Mi∣stake
in the Management of the <HI>Gout;</HI>
by forbidding almost all Evacuations,
either in the Fit, or in the Intervals,
for fear of weakening the Constitution.
<PB N="16" REF="30"/>
There are two Seasons, to wit, Spring
and Fall, when the Periodical Fits of
regular <HI>Gouts</HI> commonly happen; which
I consider as Cardinal and Critical Dis∣charges,
under general and mechanical
Influences, for purifying the Blood, and
discharging the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts: In which
Nature is no more to be disturb'd in its
Operations (I mean as to Purging, for
even then a gentle, slow, constant and
uniform Perspiration and Breathing
Sweat may be promoted, not only safe∣ly,
but with great Advantage) than in
the Monthly Purgations of the Sex. But
in light, flying Touches of the <HI>Gout,</HI>
out of these Seasons; and in the Inter∣vals
of the Fits, gentle, warm, sto∣machick
Purgers will be an excellent
Remedy to send these a going, to lessen
the Fits, and lengthen the Intervals.
A Person out of the Pain and Inflamma∣tion
of the Fits, and in their Intervals
(except his natural Disposition to breed
another Fit) is, to all Intentions of
Medicines, the same as a well Person.
And all Medicines levell'd against other
<PB N="17" REF="31"/>
Diseases incident to human Bodies, may
be as safely administer'd to a <HI>Gouty</HI> (re∣gard
being had to his particular Consti∣tution)
as to any other Person. Where∣fore,
the general and direct Methods
of relieving the <HI>Gout,</HI> are, In the Fits,
a gentle, uniform, continu'd Perspira∣tion
and Breathing Sweat. In the In∣tervals,
Labour or Exercise, and gen∣tle,
Stomachick Purgers.</P>
<P>XV. The Secondary or less direct
Methods of relieving the <HI>Gout,</HI> are prin∣cipally
these two, <HI>First,</HI> Dilution, by
proper Liquors. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Strengthners
of the Instruments of the Digestion.
Nothing is more likely to thin the
Blood; to dissolve and break the Salts,
and keep them at a distance from run∣ning
into Clusters, than proper Dilu∣ters;
as we see in Fevers, Rheumatisms,
and other inflammatory Distempers.
For this Reason, among others, it is,
that <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>German Spaw</HI> Waters,
and all other <HI>Mineral Chalybeat</HI> Waters;
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>
Dwarf-Elder Tea; Trifoil Tea; light,
quick, Green Tea; small spicy Bitters
on Water, and such like, drunk freely,
Blood warm, on an empty Stomach,
become so useful in Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI>
Water is the universal Dissolvent of Salts
of all sorts; and being replenish'd with
the spicy, bitter and active Parts of other
Bodies, it strengthens the Stomach and
Bowels; breaks and dissolves the Salts;
cleanses the insides of the Vessels from
the Foulness that constantly adheres
to them, and carries it out of the
Body, by increas'd Perspiration and
Urine.</P>
<P>XVI. Strengthners of the Instruments
of Digestion, are an excellent Remedy
in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> If the Di∣gestions
be true and good; the Parts of
the <HI>Chyle</HI> be made sufficiently small,
and the Circulation be full and com∣pleat
(all which are the common Ef∣fects
of Stomachick Medicines) the Salts
will be less; the Obstructions of the
<PB N="19" REF="33"/>
small Vessels fewer, and the Impurities
of the Fluids will more easily pass by
Perspiration, and the other Drains of
the Body; and so the Fits of the <HI>Gout</HI>
become more easy, and less frequent.
Among all the Strengthners of the Di∣gestions,
I wou'd recommend a strong
Infusion of the <HI>Jesuit</HI>'s Bark, in gene∣rous
Claret, as being the coolest Bitter,
the most powerful Strengthner of re∣lax'd
<HI>Fibres</HI> in the Instruments of Di∣gestion;
and the greatest Antidote of
the urinous Salts, especially if join'd
with <HI>Chalybeats,</HI> and some Qualifiers of
its mawkish and nauseous Taste. The
Bark has the same Effect on the Coats
and <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Vessels, that Oak Bark
has on raw Leather; and the same Ef∣fects
on the Fluids to prevent their Co∣agulation;
and to render them uniform,
that the <HI>Testaceous</HI> Powders have on Vi∣negar,
or as they have on Milk, to
prevent its Curdling: But more espe∣cially,
as it produces such Wonders on
the Solids and Fluids in intermittent
<PB N="20" REF="34"/>
Fevers; to the State and Condition of
both which, the Solids and Fluids of
<HI>Gouty</HI> Persons bear so near a Resem∣blance,
as has been observ'd in <HI>Coroll.</HI> 2.
Wherever the Bark is proper, I re∣commend
the <HI>Glans Guercma,</HI> or A∣corn,
as of the same Class of Medi∣cines,
and in some Cases of Relaxation
exceeding the other. It is cool and ea∣sily
digested. But they do best united.
All bitter and spicy Medicines have more
or less of the same Quality; but heat
the Body more, and brace the <HI>Fibres</HI>
less.</P>
<P>XVII. <HI>Mercury,</HI> by its Weight, and
its constantly forming it self in little
Spheres (or perhaps from its greater
attractive Force) throughout all its pos∣sible
Divisions, seems to offer fairest,
of any internal Medicine, for breaking
the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts; for relaxing the <HI>Fibres;</HI>
and enlarging the Capacities of the small
Vessels. And the Fact is, that by a
full and free Salivation. <HI>Gouty</HI> People
<PB N="21" REF="35"/>
have been freed from all its Symptoms
for several Years. But it is also Matter
of Fact, and Experience, that a full and
free Salivation does so break, rend and
tear all the smallest, tenderest and finest
Vessels and <HI>Fibres,</HI> that the Body be∣comes
in a worse State, in respect of the
future Fits, than it would have been in
several Years time, under the common
Symptoms. For tho' a Salivation may
open all the Obstructions of the small
Vessels; cleanse their insides from the
Foulness that cleaves to them; purify
the Blood, and break its saline Impuri∣ties;
yet by its great Weight, and the
excessive Force it adds to the Blood,
rending and tearing the finest Vessels and
<HI>Fibres;</HI> when the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person comes
to his former Diet, and the other Cir∣cumstances
of living; and the Fluids
become thereby loaded with their Salts,
they stick more obstinately to the Joints,
than if the Parts had been subdu'd and
broken by regular Fits of the <HI>Gout.</HI> So
that a Salivation, tho' it banish the Fits
<PB N="22" REF="36"/>
for some time, yet when the Blood is
replenish'd again with <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts, the
Habit is reduc'd to a worse Condition,
in respect of the future Fits, than if they
had never been interrupted: And, in∣deed,
it is observable, that after a full,
or repeated Salivations, the Man is sel∣dom
or ever the same, as to the Quick∣ness
of Sensation; or the Usage of the
most beautiful animal Faculties. But
there is an absolute Necessity of hav∣ing
recourse to <HI>Mercurial</HI> Vomits and
Purges, when the <HI>Gout</HI> becomes fixt
to, and permanent in a Place, as also
when it is dispersed all over the Habit,
like a Rheumatism. These active Me∣dicines
must first render the Humours
fluid, which <HI>Gum Guajac</HI> with Dia∣phoretick
<HI>Antimony</HI> persisted in will af∣terwards
carry off. I come now to
consider the <HI>Gouty</HI> Person under two
different Circumstances. <HI>First,</HI> under
a regular Fit. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> in the
Intervals.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="37"/>
XVIII. 1. On the <HI>First</HI> Attack of the
Fit, especially while the Fever, that
ushers it in, remains, Dilution is the
only Remedy. Fine, clear, old small
Beer, with a little old Mountain, or
<HI>Madera</HI> Wine; Water boil'd with a few
Spicy Seeds, mix'd with these Wines:
Water Gruel with some Wine, or Harts∣horn-Drink
with Cinnamon; and little
or no Flesh Meat, will succeed best dur∣ing
all the time of the Fever. After
the Fit is distinctly form'd, the milder
Cordial and Stomachick Medicines,
which promote a gentle Breathing Sweat
(I mean in the more compounded and
tedious Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> chiefly in Per∣sons
advanc'd in Years) such as <HI>Gascoin</HI>
Powder, <HI>Goa</HI> Stone, <HI>Bezoar;</HI> Sir <HI>Wal∣ter
Rawleigh</HI>'s Cordial, <HI>Diascordium,</HI>
Confection of <HI>Alkermes,</HI> and the like,
wash'd down with clear Blood-warm
Sack-whey; in every Draught of which
ten or fifteen Drops of Spirit of Harts∣horn
has been first pour'd; with Flan∣nel
<PB N="24" REF="38"/>
on the Parts, and much lying a Bed;
such a Method, and such Medicines, I
say, will best forward the Fit. Towards
the Decline, the stronger, warmer,
spicy and Stomachick Medicines; such
as <HI>Serpentary</HI> Root, <HI>Casamunair, Zedo∣ary,</HI>
old <HI>Venice</HI> Treacle, <HI>Electuarium
de Ovo,</HI> and such like; with a few Grains
of <HI>Camphir,</HI> and Salt of <HI>Vipers;</HI> and a
good Stomach Bitter on Wine to wash
them down, will finish this Affair,
strengthen the Bowels, and prevent the
Recoil of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour on them.
And here it may be taken Notice of,
that as the Fever, that ushers in the
<HI>Gout,</HI> is, so will the Fit be: If the Fe∣ver
is short and sharp, the Fit will be
so likewise, in regular <HI>Gouts:</HI> If it be
feeble, long and lingering, the Fit will
be such also. In the Management of
the foregoing Method and Medicines,
two Cautions are to be minded: <HI>First,</HI>
That during the whole Fit, Liquors
may be more freely and safely indulg'd,
than solid Foods. For Repletion from
<PB N="25" REF="39"/>
solid Foods, in a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> might
be of fatal Consequence, by rendering
a regular Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI> irregular:
Whereas Fluids will certainly pass, ei∣ther
by Perspiration, Sweating, or U∣rine.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> The Cordial Medicines
are always to be regulated, by their
Lightness on, and Agreeableness to the
Stomach of the Patient; (for whatever
makes him sick, will more or less draw
in the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour on the Stomach)
and by their not rendering him more
hot and restless, than the <HI>Gout</HI> it self
wou'd naturally make him: For if they
produce an agreeable Sensation on the
Stomach, and do not inflame, they
will necessarily procure Coolness and
Quiet.</P>
<P>XIX. Here it may be consider'd,
whether <HI>Opiats</HI> may be safely given in a
Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> to procure Rest, and
alleviate Pain. In the general, it is
the safest side, not to administer any
kind of <HI>Opiats</HI> in the Fits; because they
<PB N="26" REF="40"/>
constantly pall the Appetite, and leave
a Nauseating, and perhaps a Reaching
on the Stomach, the readiest way to
bring the <HI>Gout</HI> there. But in Extremi∣ties,
when the Patient has been many
Days without Rest, and the Pain be∣comes
intolerable, all other Means fail∣ing,
or equally dangerous, <HI>Opiats</HI> may
be so qualify'd, and their mischievous
Effects so bridl'd, by joining spicy, ner∣vous
and Stomach Medicines to them,
that they may become an excellent Re∣medy.
Thus liquid <HI>Laudanum,</HI> with
Tincture of <HI>Castor,</HI> of Snakeweed, of
<HI>Diambra,</HI> of Saffron, <HI>Sal Volatile,</HI> Com∣pound
Spirit of Lavender, Hysterick
Water, and some agreeable Simple Wa∣ter;
some of these mix'd in a due Pro∣portion,
and proper Dose, will not on∣ly
procure Rest, and ease Pain, but
answer all the other Intentions in the
Cure of a Fit of the <HI>Gout.</HI> Thus also,
<HI>London Laudanum,</HI> with old <HI>Venice</HI>
Treacle, or <HI>Mythridate,</HI> Serpentary
Root, and unscented Species of <HI>Diam∣bra,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="41"/>
made into a <HI>Bolus,</HI> with any agree∣able
Syrup, and caution'd, as before,
will produce the same Effect.</P>
<P>XX. As soon as the Pain is almost
gone, and the Swelling and Weakness
only remain, nothing will more quick∣en
and finish the Cure, and strengthen
the weaken'd Parts, than gentle, warm,
stomachick and spicy Purgers, dos'd
and repeated according to the Strength
of the Patient; by carrying out of the
Habit, the more gross and unperspira∣ble
Remains of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour. This
premis'd, especially after long and se∣vere
Fits, which have impair'd the
Strength, and wasted the Muscular Flesh;
I should advise Asse's Milk with Pearl,
half a Pint, or a Pint, in the Morn∣ing
early, and five or six a Clock in
the Afternoon; to lengthen out the
Morning Sleep, to pulp up the exhaust∣ed
Muscles, to cool and refresh the
parch'd <HI>Fibres,</HI> and keep the Body so∣luble;
which Asse's Milk commonly
does. And to keep up the Appetite,
<PB N="28" REF="42"/>
which the Milk commonly palls, and
to prevent its too cooling Effects on the
Stomach, a light bitter made of Gen∣tian,
Cinnamon, and Orange Peel on∣ly,
the last double of the other two, in∣fus'd
on Sherry or White-Wine, and
taken two Hours before Meals, may be
us'd most conveniently. This Course
might be continu'd for two or three
Weeks: After which I shou'd order a
Course of <HI>Bath</HI> or <HI>German Spaw</HI> Waters,
with Steel, riding, a light White-food
Diet, and generous Wines drunk tem∣perately.</P>
<P>XXI. It is in the Intervals of the Fits
that any thing great or probable is to
be undertaken for the Relief or Cure of
the <HI>Gouty.</HI> The Methods, both gene∣ral
and particular, I have touch'd upon.
I come now to recommend some spe∣cial
Medicines, which have been found
useful in this Case. It is certain that
great Abstinence from Flesh, Fish, and
Wines, would prevent the Fluids from
being overloaded with <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts. It
<PB N="29" REF="43"/>
is also certain, that if the Food be
carry'd out before it is digested, it
will be pretty near the same thing, as
if the Quantity carry'd out, had not
been taken down. Now if a Medicine
can be found, that without weakening
the Stomach and Bowels, shall carry
off the greater part of the Food, be∣fore
it is quite rob'd of its Salts, it
can't fail to be of great Use in the In∣tervals
of the <HI>Gout.</HI> For this purpose,
I wou'd recommend fine Rhubarb, taken
regularly once, twice, or oftner a Week,
in such a Dose, as to procure two or
three Motions: For these Reasons, <HI>First,</HI>
Because it is an excellent Stomach Bit∣ter,
as is evident from its Taste, and
from the sharp Appetite it gives those
that take it frequently. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Be∣cause
it is one of the noblest Astringents
hitherto known, as is evident from its
Cure of Fluxes, and intestine <HI>Haemor∣rhages;</HI>
and from the Tightness it leaves
on the Bowels. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Because it re∣quires
neither Diet, nor keeping warm,
nor any other particular Management;
<PB N="30" REF="44"/>
and yet taken frequently and regularly,
it will carry off any Proportion of the
Food one pleases; and so reduce the
Diet, as near as needs be, to <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s,
which, in Article XIII, has been shewn
to be of so excellent Use in the <HI>Gout.</HI>
I knew a Noble Lord, of great Worth,
and much <HI>Gout,</HI> who, by taking from
the Hands of a Quack, a Dram of Rhu∣barb,
ting'd with <HI>Cochineal</HI> to disguise
it, every Morning for the Space of six
Weeks, liv'd in Health for four Years
after, without any Symptom of it.</P>
<P>XXII. It is worth here taking Notice,
that all the Preparations of this Medi∣cine
serve only to spoil it: And that it
is best taken in a spoonful of Soup, or
any other agreeable Liquor, immedi∣ately
before Dinner, or chew'd in a
Morning fasting. But to those to whom
its Mawkishness is nauseous, I wou'd
recommend this Form. <HI>Take</HI> Gentian
<HI>and</HI> Zedoary <HI>of each a Dram,</HI> Serpen∣tary
<HI>Root, and unscented Species of</HI>
Diambra, <HI>of each half a Dram;</HI> Co∣chineal
<PB N="31" REF="45"/>
<HI>and</HI> Saffron <HI>of each a Scruple;</HI>
Orange Peel <HI>an Ounce; infuse in a Quart
of Mountain, in a warm place twenty
four Hours, strain, and to the Liquor
add three Ounces of the best</HI> Rhubarb;
Salt of Wormwood <HI>a Dram and an half;
set in a warm Sand heat twelve Hours;
and then strain a second time.</HI> Of this
four Spoonfuls every Night, or every
other Night, as occasion requir'd, I
have found an excellent Remedy in this
and other Chronical Cases. Where no
Preparations of Rhubarb will agree with
the Constitution, as there are many
such, then <HI>Elixir Salutis,</HI> Tincture of
<HI>Hiera Picra;</HI> a Solution of <HI>Gum Guajac,</HI>
or the <HI>Scotch</HI> Pills, might take place;
but that all the Preparations of <HI>Aloes</HI> are
apt to throw out both <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Piles.</HI>
However in this matter there is great
Variety; out of which every one may
fit themselves with what is most agree∣able
to their own Constitution; which
if they use regularly and frequently,
they cannot fail to prevent violent
Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> and perhaps most
<PB N="32" REF="46"/>
other, both Acute and Chronical Di∣stempers.</P>
<P>XXIII. Next to Rhubarb, and all
Circumstances consider'd, even far be∣fore
it, I would recommend <HI>Sulphur,</HI>
as one of the best Remedies in the In∣tervals
of the <HI>Gout.</HI> It is but in little
Use at present in Physick, except in the
<HI>Itch,</HI> and the <HI>Piles;</HI> and yet in the
whole Extent of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI>
I know not a more safe and more active
Medicine. Its wonderful Efficacy, and
particular manner of Operating in these
common Cases, might, I think, have
encourag'd its Trial in other Chronical
Cases, especially considering the Faci∣lity
of its Working, and the little Trou∣ble
it gives in taking it. Its principal
Qualities are these. 1. The Parts of
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> and those of Light and Fire,
act mutually upon one another, more
powerfully than those of other Bodies.
It is to their <HI>Sulphur</HI> that Bodies owe
reflecting and refracting Virtues; from
whence its Inflammability proceeds.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="47"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Sir</HI> Isaac Newton'<HI>s Treatise of Light and Co∣lours,</HI>
1 <HI>Edit. in</HI> English <HI>towards the end.</HI></NOTE> The Particles of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies re∣ceive
and retain those of Light and Fire,
more strongly than any other Bodies:
And the Rays of Light and Particles of
Fire, separate, move and turn the Parts
of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies into Fire and Flame.
2. The Parts of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies are
very small, even smaller than those of
Water it self, whereby it comes to pass
that they will enter those small Vessels,
where Water it self (our best and most
universal Diluent) can't come; this is
evident from hence, that Water will not
dissolve <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and that no Moisture
will stick to fat Substances, or the Fea∣thers
of Water Fowl: As also from its
Cure of all cutaneous Foulness; which
it cou'd never effectuate but by entering
all those smallest Vessels. which scarce
any other Medicine can enter. And
<HI>lastly,</HI> by its dissolving the sizy Juices
of the smallest internal <HI>Glands,</HI> when
obstructed; particularly those of the
<PB N="34" REF="48"/>
<HI>Lungs, Mesentery</HI> and <HI>Rectum;</HI> as in
the humorous <HI>Asthma, Scrophula</HI> and
<HI>Piles.</HI> 3. <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies will readi∣ly
unite with, and destroy the Effects
of all <HI>Saline</HI> Particles, but especially
those of the acid kind. And in this
their great Energy seems to consist.
<HI>Sulphur</HI> yields the most piercing, active,
and agreeable <HI>Acid</HI> in the World; such
as Spirit of <HI>Sulphur, Gas</HI> of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and
the like. 4. The fat and oily Parts of
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> like other fat and unctuous
Bodies, are the lightest, the most co∣herent,
and the most springy of all Bo∣dies.
These two last Qualities are most
manifest from the artificial <HI>Sulphur</HI> made
of Oyl of Turpentine and Spirit of <HI>Vi∣triol</HI>
(the strongest Glew, and the most
penetrating Acid) duly digested and
carefully manag'd, which in all respects
is the same with natural <HI>Sulphur.</HI> “No
Body denies” (says <HI>Tournfort</HI> in his
Voyage to the <HI>Levant,</HI> Pag. 122. Part I.
<HI>English</HI> Edit.) “that <HI>Sulphur</HI> is only a
fat Substance, fix'd by an acid Spirit:
<PB N="35" REF="49"/>
The <HI>Sulphur</HI> which is artificially
made, and the <HI>Analysis</HI> of common
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> put this Truth out of all
Dispute. For the Sea Water being
fat by the Oil of the Sea Fish conti∣nually
corrupting there, and bitter
and saltish from its saline Rocks,
produces in proper Nests natural <HI>Sul∣phur.</HI>”
And Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> says, in
his last Edition of his Opticks, <HI>pag.</HI> 359.
“By dissolving Flower of Brimstone
in Oil of Turpentine, and distilling
the Solution, it is found, that <HI>Sul∣phur</HI>
is compos'd of an inflammable
thick Oil, or fat <HI>Bitumen,</HI> an acid
Salt, a very thick Earth, and a little
Metal: The three first were found
not much unequal to one another;
the fourth in so small a Quantity, as
scarce to be worth the considering.”
Join all these Qualities together, and
you have one of the most admirable Re∣medies
in the World, for all Intentions
in the Cure of the <HI>Gout:</HI> By its agree∣able
Taste and Lightness on the Sto∣mach,
<PB N="36" REF="50"/>
(especially when wash'd down
with any milky Vehicle) its Tenacity,
Ropiness and Elasticity; the Smallness
of its Parts; their Efficacy in destroy∣ing
the Mischief of all saline Particles,
with their natural Warmth, join'd to
the Activity of its acid Salt, (making it
a kind of natural Soap) it enters the
small Vessels, where no other Diluent,
hitherto known, can come; cleanses
their insides from the Foulness that sticks
to them; imbibes and retains all the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Salts, and carries them out of the
Body by Perspiration; softens, smooths
and relaxes the parch'd and stiffen'd <HI>Fi∣bres;</HI>
and by leaving some of its oily
Parts on their Surfaces, sheaths and de∣fends
them from the Points of the Salts
afterwards introduc'd. And the Fact
is, from repeated Trials I can recom∣mend
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> as a most powerful Re∣medy
in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> For
I have known half a Dram of pow∣der'd
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> or Flowers of Brimstone,
taken regularly twice a Day in a Spoon∣ful
<PB N="37" REF="51"/>
of Milk, prevent the Fit for many
Years; and lessen both its Pain and Du∣ration
when it happen'd: For it mov'd
the Body gently once or twice a Day.
I have in my Possession Testimonies
under the Hands of some treated and
tended by my self; and of others of un∣doubted
Credit, witnessing to the great
Success of this Medicine in the Intervals
of the <HI>Gout.</HI> Nothing hitherto disco∣ver'd,
I believe, equals it obstinately
persisted in.</P>
<P>XXIV. Especially if to these be ad∣ded
plentiful Dilution by some Blood
warm Infusion of a spicy and diuretick
Plant in Water, so as to provoke a
gentle Breathing Sweat, and pass free∣ly
by Urine. Thus large Draughts of
Sage, Dwarf-Elder, Buckbean, or Green
Tea; but especially of weak Whey made
on old Mountain, drunk Blood warm,
and on an empty Stomach, and join'd
to any of the now mention'd Medicines,
will be of great Advantage in the In∣tervals
<PB N="38" REF="52"/>
of the <HI>Gout;</HI> by diluting and
breaking its Salts, and carrying them off
by Perspiration and Urine. And certain∣ly
<HI>Roselli</HI>'s Drops, (perhaps the <HI>Tinctura
Metallorum</HI> somehow alter'd) which were
said to work gently by Stool and Sweat,
in the Hands of a prudent and knowing
Physician, had been an admirable Re∣medy,
as answering both the Intentions
mention'd, in the Intervals of the Fits;
and even in the Fits themselves, it had
not been without its Use (always ex∣cepting
the <HI>Vernal</HI> and <HI>Autumnal</HI> regu∣lar
Fits) had he dealt with recent <HI>Gouts,</HI>
and firm Constitutions only. That
which I wou'd particularly recommend
here, is, a weak Decoction of the
<HI>BARK</HI> of <HI>Sarsa</HI> Root (in the <HI>BARK</HI>
the Virtues of the Plants chiefly con∣sist:
For being replenish'd with most
part of, if not all the Juice-circulating
Vessels, it contains all its Salts and
most active Parts; and being Spungy
and Tender, it is thereby more easily
digested: And where Roots are most
<PB N="39" REF="53"/>
in Use, the <HI>Bark</HI> of the Root is more
eminently useful, for the Reasons as∣sign'd:
As also because, towards the
End of the <HI>Autumn,</HI> when Roots are
gather'd, the Cold has already driven
the Juices into their <HI>Bark.</HI> And this
may be one Reason why the famous
Pox-Doctor succeeds in some Cases,
when mismanag'd <HI>Mercurial</HI> Treat∣ments
have fail'd: His Diet-Drink
chiefly consists of a Decoction of the
Bark of this Root: His Pill is <HI>Mercu∣rial,</HI>
perhaps the <HI>Arcanum Corallinum,</HI>
or <HI>Panacaea,</HI> and these two persisted in
for so long a time, must necessarily
sweeten the tainted Juices, and expel
the entangl'd and grosser <HI>Mercurial</HI>
Parts, which clustering together, cou'd
not perform the Circulation, but were
retain'd within the Habit, by former
mismanag'd Salivations, and thereby
render'd ineffectual to the Cure; espe∣cially,
if to these be added, the low
and starving Diet he prescribes. For
I have heard of a famous Sea-Com∣mander,
<PB N="40" REF="54"/>
who effectually cur'd the first
Stages of <HI>Venereal</HI> Distempers by living
twenty Days on <HI>Water Gruel</HI> only, in
which a little <HI>Cream</HI> of <HI>Tartar</HI> had been
first dissolv'd; and higher Degrees of
the same by the like Diet continu'd twice
the Time;) with a little Milk, drunk
freely Blood warm every Morning,
which I have known wonderfully relieve
<HI>Gouty</HI> Persons, when drunk all the Win∣ter
between the <HI>Cardinal</HI> Fits. And
even Cow's Milk warm, taken for Break∣fast
and Supper, has been of great Ser∣vice
to those <HI>Gouty</HI> Persons who drink
not much Wine; for those who drink
Wine freely, have too hot and sour Sto∣machs
to deal in Milk.</P>
<P>XXV. Even drinking freely of light,
clear Spring Water after full Meals, and
indulging in strong Liquors, will be
found of great Use in the Intervals of
the <HI>Gout.</HI> It is well known that warm
Water alone, drunk in a Morning fast∣ing
freely, and at Meals, from its Heat,
<PB N="41" REF="55"/>
its Dilution, and cleansing Qualities,
has been a sovereign Remedy in restor∣ing
decay'd Appetites, and strengthning
weak Digestions, when other more pom∣pous
Medicines have fail'd. <HI>Lower</HI> ve∣ry
justly observes, that Persons that
have drunk beyond the Rules of Tem∣perance,
may be much reliev'd from
the ill Effects of it, by exposing them∣selves
to the free Air, to cool the Blood,
and to force off the Liquors by Urine.
I'm of Opinion, were there neither Sin
nor Shame in it, as there are eminent∣ly
both, a <HI>Gouty</HI> Person ought to avoid
Intemperance, as he wou'd avoid the
Bite of a Snake or mad Dog. But since
such Accidents do happen, let the <HI>Gou∣ty</HI>
Person, after the Excess either in
Meat or Drink, swill down as much fair
Water as his Stomach will bear, before
he go to Bed; whereby he'll reap these
Advantages: <HI>First,</HI> Either the Contents
of the Stomach will be thrown upwards,
and he freed from a great part of the
Load. Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Both Meat and
<PB N="42" REF="56"/>
Drink will be much diluted; and the
Labour and Expence of Spirits in Di∣gestion
much sav'd. And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Salts will thereby be dissolv'd and
distanc'd from one another; and so be
more readily carry'd off by the free
Perspiration, Sweating and Urine which
ensue.</P>
<P>XXVI. But beyond all other
things, a well order'd Course of
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters, with <HI>Chalybeats</HI> and warm
Bitters, and a frequent and regular
Use of Stomach Purgers will be found
to succeed best in <HI>Gouty,</HI> as well as other
Chronical Cases. The Learn'd have
been divided, and much perplex'd a∣bout
the Heat of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters. I have
always endeavour'd to account to my
self for it, from the common Experi∣ment
of mixing filings of <HI>Steel,</HI> and
Powder of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> working them into
a Paste with Water, and putting them
into a Cellar, under a Cock, droping
Water slowly and regularly; the Paste
<PB N="43" REF="57"/>
will ferment to such a degree, that the
Water running from it shall be of the
same Heat and Virtue with the <HI>Bath</HI> Wa∣ters;
tho' not so pleasant, nor so well
fitted to human Bodies. This is a com∣mon
Experiment, and these are the on∣ly
natural Bodies known, which meet∣ing
together will produce Heat in Wa∣ter,
without artificial Fires. <HI>Tournfort,</HI>
in the Place before mention'd, says,
“It's certain that filings of Iron steep'd
in common Water will grow consi∣derably
warm, and much more so in
Sea Water: And if you mingle there∣with
some <HI>Sulphur</HI> powder'd, you'll
see this Mixture really burn.” Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> in his last Edition of his
Opticks, <HI>page</HI> 354, says, “That e∣ven
the gross Body of <HI>Sulphur</HI> pow∣der'd,
and with an equal Weight
of Iron filings, and a little Wa∣ter
made into a Paste, acts up∣on
the Iron; and in five or six
Hours grows too hot to be touch'd,
and emits a Flame.” That the Heat
<PB N="44" REF="58"/>
of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters is owing to a Prin∣ciple
within themselves, is evident, from
their retaining it longer than any other
Water, heated to the same Degree, will.
Wherefore there can be no Necessity of
having recourse to <HI>Vulcano</HI>'s or subter∣raneous
Fires, to account for this Ap∣pearance.
There are no burning Moun∣tains
known in this our <HI>Northern</HI> Cli∣mate;
and 'tis pretty hard to conceive,
how Fires shou'd have burn'd so long
under Ground without a Vent, or any
other remarkable Sign. The <HI>Sulphur</HI>
in the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters is evident to the
Senses, swimming in large Clusters on
the Tops of the <HI>Baths</HI> mix'd with Earth,
and some vegetable Substances, where∣with
the Guides commonly gild Silver:
and is found an excellent Remedy in
<HI>Scurvies, Leprosies, Ringworms,</HI> and
other <HI>Foulnesses</HI> of the Skin. The Steel
is manifested by the blewish Tincture
given to the Water from the Pump, by
an Infusion of Nut-gall. It is true, this
Tincture is neither so deep, nor is it
to be had from the Water, in any short
<PB N="45" REF="59"/>
time after it comes hot from the Pump,
thereby to manifest any great Quantity
of Steel in the Composition, such as
can have the full Proportion to the Ex∣periment
now mention'd. But, to set
this in a clearer Light, let us put toge∣ther
these Considerations. <HI>First,</HI> That
upon Distillation of <HI>Bath</HI> Water, there
remains little in the Bottom of the Glass
but the common <HI>Calx</HI> or Sea Salt, that
is found in the Distillation of Spring
Water, if we except some Sand or Earth,
that is forc'd up by the Violence of the
Pump; wherefore the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters not
being impregnated with any Quantity
of a saline Mixture, can retain nothing
in their own proper Substance but the
lightest Parts of the Steel and <HI>Sulphur.
Secondly,</HI> That this Water is as fully
impregnated with <HI>Sulphur,</HI> as it can bear,
has been already shewn: And that there
must be a greater Proportion of Steel in
<HI>Bath</HI> Water than is manifested to the
Senses, or discover'd by any Experi∣ment
hitherto made, is evident from
its healing Effects, which no known
<PB N="46" REF="60"/>
Medicine but Steel can bring about, or
account for: None but those who have
seen it, can believe the wonderful Effi∣cacy
it has, in most Chronical Cases.
What, but Steel, in a few Weeks, can
make the Blood, from a white blewish
or tallow Hue, resisting the Knife, like
Glew, swimming in its <HI>Serum,</HI> like an
Island amidst the Ocean, look all of a
Piece, of a Scarlet Colour, and a due
Proportion between its nourishing and
its watery Parts. Nothing but Steel
can make a pale ash-colour'd Counte∣nance,
hollow and deep Eyes, no Ap∣petite,
little Strength, and less Sleep;
eat, and drink, and sleep, look gay and
sleek, like the best Health. Thousands
of such Instances may be seen every Sea∣son
at these healthful Springs. <HI>Third∣ly,</HI>
The Effects of <HI>Sulphur</HI> in bridling
the sensible Appearances and Operations
of most active Medicines, is very well
known. Instances of which, in natu∣ral
Bodies, are, <HI>Antimony</HI> and native
<HI>Cinnabar;</HI> in artificial ones, <HI>Aethiops</HI>
Mineral, and <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of <HI>Antimony:</HI> In
<PB N="47" REF="61"/>
all which the <HI>Mercury</HI> is so bridl'd up
by the <HI>Sulphur,</HI> that none of their sen∣sible
Operations and Appearances are
felt, while they produce the most won∣derful
Changes on animal Bodies. I
cannot pass over <HI>Aethiops</HI> Mineral with∣out
pressing its more universal Use than,
for ought I know, it has yet had in
common Practice. It is one of the most
certain and universal Alteratives, if dos'd
sufficiently and long enough persisted
in, of all the <HI>Dispensatory.</HI> It radical∣ly
extirpates the Itch, the Piles, scor∣butick
and scrophulous Ulcers; all cu∣taneous
Foulnesses; all Inflammations
and Fluxions of the Eyes; all internal
Ulcers, Rheumatisms, white Swellings;
sharp Humours in the Stomach and Guts,
and almost all Distempers arising from
sizy Juices. I say, it cures these, if Art
can do it; for some of these (like he∣reditary
<HI>Gouts</HI>) are so transubstantiated
into the Solids, that nothing but a new
Conformation of Parts can cure them.
It may be given almost to half an Ounce
a Day, especially with interspers'd <HI>Mer∣curial</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="62"/>
Purges, without Trouble, or any
sensible Operation, and continu'd for a
Twelve-month, if one pleases. The
finest <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and fittest to make <HI>Aethi∣ops</HI>
of, is common <HI>Sulphur</HI> pouder'd,
and boiled seven or eight times in Spring
Water, whereby it becomes as light on
the Stomach as prepared Peach, and as
effectual in the Cases mentioned, as
the celebrated <HI>Sulphur</HI> of <HI>Aix la Chap∣pelle</HI>
Waters. But to return to the Bu∣siness.</P>
<P>XXVII. The sum of all then is, since
the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters derive their Heat from
a Principle within themselves; since no
natural Body, but <HI>Sulphur</HI> and Iron can
produce such a Degree of Heat, as is in
them; since nothing but Steel can pro∣duce
those wonderful Cures on human
Bodies, which <HI>Bath</HI> Waters do; since
<HI>Sulphur</HI> will lock up and bridle the sen∣sible
Appearances and Effects of the most
active Bodies, and yet not destroy their
healthful and medical Virtues; it is
plain, that <HI>Bath</HI> Waters must owe their
<PB N="49" REF="63"/>
Heat to a Mixture of steely and sulphu∣rous
Particles; and their healthful Ef∣fects,
to a greater Proportion of Steel,
than is sensible, or easily discoverable by
any Experiment hitherto made, join'd
to a light <HI>Sulphur,</HI> whose Virtues and
Efficacy in all Chronical Cases, we have
already shewn. The Mountains which
surround the Place, which every Body
now knows, to be but the Nests of Mi∣nerals,
and the Receptacles of the Wa∣ters,
which feed the Springs, (which
Mountains are continu'd even to the Sea)
confirm this Opinion. The manner
I conceive thus: The Dews drilling and
droping through the Cranies of the
Mountains, fall upon a Bed of Iron Oar,
and are there as fully impregnated with
<HI>Chalybeat</HI> Particles as such Water can
bear; and gently owzing down upon a
Nest of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and there fermenting
to such a Degree, that requiring more
room, they bubble up at the Foot of the
Mountains, with their sulphurous Spoils,
and furnish out this healing and balsa∣mick
Fluid. All hot Waters seem chief∣ly
<PB N="50" REF="64"/>
to consist of these two Principles; and
to differ only as the <HI>Sulphur</HI> or <HI>Steel</HI>
predominates in them. Where the <HI>Sul∣phur</HI>
predominates, they are hotter, more
nauseous, and more purgative. Of the
three hot <HI>European</HI> Waters of Note, the
<HI>Aix la Chapelle, Bourbon,</HI> and <HI>Bath;</HI>
the first abounds more eminently in
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> which makes its Heat, Nau∣seousness
and Purgative Faculty so great,
that few weak Stomachs can bear its
Heat and Nauseousness; and fewer weak
Constitutions, the Violence of its Purg∣ing.
The <HI>Bourbon</HI> are of a middle Nature,
between the <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI> and the <HI>Bath</HI>
Waters, and are less hot, nauseous and
purgative than the <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> but
more than the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters. The <HI>Bath</HI>
partake less of the <HI>Sulphur</HI> and more of
the <HI>Steel</HI> than either of these two; and
are by far the most pleasant; of a milky
Taste, never purge, except they be
drunk either too fast, or in too great
Quantities, and always mend the Ap∣petite,
and raise the Spirits. The weak∣est
hot Waters are but of little Use, ex∣cept
<PB N="51" REF="65"/>
in the lowest Cases, and hectick
or consumptive Constitutions; but for
Medical Uses, the weaker hot Waters
may be made pretty near equal to the
stronger by Evaporation, as to the sul∣phurous
Principle; as the stronger may
be brought down to the weaker by Di∣lution,
as I have experienc'd; tho' Na∣ture
be always the wisest and most per∣fect
Operator. But neither the same
Proportion of <HI>Steel,</HI> nor <HI>Sulphur,</HI> nor
Heat, indifferently fit all Constitutions.
Generally the Strength (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Quan∣tity
of <HI>Steel</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI>) of the same
hot Waters is in proportion to their
Heat; and therefore to fit the same Wa∣ters
to weaker Constitutions, they need
only be drunk proportionably cooler.</P>
<P>XXVIII. The <HI>Bath</HI> Waters having
such an Origin, and such Qualities,
must needs be an excellent Remedy in
the <HI>Gout,</HI> and other Chronical Cases,
for these Reasons; 1. Because of their
Warmth, just suited to the Wants of
Nature, and a little above the Heat of
<PB N="52" REF="66"/>
human Bodies, sufficient to introduce
a foreign Warmth and Motion to cold
and decay'd Bowels and Fluids; whereby
the natural Warmth and slow Circulati∣on
is increas'd and enliven'd. 2. This,
with its agreeable Taste and milky Soft∣ness,
makes it sit so easily on the Sto∣mach,
and become so excellent a Vehi∣cle,
to wash into the Blood other pro∣per
and specifick Medicines, without
that Nauseousness and Fret on the Spi∣rits,
which all other hot Waters, hitherto
known; or that Chillyness and Damp,
which all cold Mineral Waters, give:
whereby they are render'd useless or
hurtful in some low and nervous Cases.
To these add, 3. Their <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Prin∣ciple,
so peculiarly lock'd up in <HI>Sul∣phur,</HI>
that the Patient reaps all the Be∣nefit
and healthful Effects of the best
Preparations of this Medicine (and what
are not two such powerful Medicines
combin'd able to effect?) without the
nauseous Taste, and frequent Disorders
upon the Stomach, that every other
way of giving <HI>Steel</HI> produces. 4. The
<PB N="53" REF="67"/>
<HI>Sulphur</HI> united with the <HI>Steel,</HI> makes it
a natural kind of Soap, for cleansing
the insides of the Vessels from the Foul∣ness
that cleaves to them; and for open∣ing
the Obstructions of the small Ves∣sels.
But 5. That which, together
with the others, makes it specifick in
the <HI>Gout,</HI> is, its relaxing Quality, where∣by
it softens and supples the rigid and
stiff <HI>Fibres,</HI> so as the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humours
may pass freely by Perspiration. Much
more might be said of this wonderful
Remedy provided by the Hand of Na∣ture,
to relieve the Miseries of human
Life; but this the innumerable Crowds
of Cripples of all sorts, and those other
Persons made miserable by Chronical
Distempers, sent thence, every Year,
cur'd, or reliev'd, do witness, more
convincingly than either Philosophy or
Rhetorick can.</P>
<P>XXIX. I will here remove two Diffi∣culties:
The <HI>First</HI> is, concerning Bath∣ing
in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> The
only Reason given for this Difficulty is,
<PB N="54" REF="68"/>
lest the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour shou'd be driven
inwards upon the Bowels. But this
seems to me a mere groundless Jealou∣sy:
For in regular <HI>Gouts,</HI> when the Fit
is over, it is to be suppos'd, that the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Fluid or Matter is mostly or alto∣gether
spent, and the Fluids in a heal∣thy
sound Condition. And therefore
it might be as reasonably doubted, if
in the Intervals of two putrid Fevers
(of which many have had more than
two in their Life-time) a Person might
safely bath. There is no Question, but
that a <HI>Gouty</HI> Person may both as safely
bath, and take any Medicine, for any
incident Disease, as any other Person;
regard being had to his particular Con∣stitution.
And 'tis Matter of Fact, that
those who have been crippl'd by the fix∣ing
of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts upon the Joints, or
disabl'd by the Tenderness of the Parts,
have been extremely reliev'd by a long
Course of Drinking and Bathing in these
hot Waters, which by relaxing the <HI>Fi∣bres,</HI>
dissolving the sizy Humours, di∣luting
the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts, and making them
<PB N="55" REF="69"/>
pass by Perspiration, have restor'd them
to the Use of their Limbs.</P>
<P>XXX. The other Difficulty is, how
the same hot Water shou'd relax con∣tracted
<HI>Fibres,</HI> as in the <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Rheu∣matism;</HI>
and yet contract and brace re∣lax'd
<HI>Fibres,</HI> as in the Palsy and wasted
Limbs. That the Matter of Fact is so,
is past all Doubt in these and many other
Cases of Contraction and Relaxation.
But to clear up this, we need only to
consider what Contraction and Relaxa∣tion
are. Since all the Fluids of the
Body are contain'd in Vessels, Con∣traction
can arise from nothing but
from the Blood and other Fluids (or
whatever is the Cause of Muscular Moti∣on)
Their being retain'd and obstructed
by their Siziness; or from some external
Injury: in the Substance of the Muscle
it self; whereby it becomes fuller and
firmer, and so acts as upon its Office of
Contraction. Relaxation, upon the
other hand, is an Obstruction of the
Nerves or Vessels of the Fluids, before
<PB N="56" REF="70"/>
they arrive at the Muscles; as is seen
in Palsies and the Nervous <HI>Atrophy</HI> of
the Limbs; so that in both Cases, Ob∣structions
are the Cause both of Con∣traction
and Relaxation. Wherefore,
whatever Medicine can dissolve the Si∣ziness
of the Fluids; open the Obstru∣ctions
of the small Vessels; make the
Perspiration full and free, and brace
the <HI>Fibres;</HI> will both contract Relaxa∣tions,
and relax Contractions: And
that these are some of the Effects of
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters, has, I think, been made
sufficiently appear.</P>
<P>XXXI. If it be enquir'd into, what
other Cases, besides the <HI>Gout, Bath</HI>
Waters may be useful in; the Answer
will be obvious from the Account now
laid down; to wit, That they must be
beneficial in all Cases, where <HI>Steel</HI> or
<HI>Sulphur</HI> is; that is, in almost all Chro∣nical
Cases whatsoever. In Acute and
Inflammatory Cases, in all Cases at∣tended
with a strong, quick Pulse, no
<HI>Mineral</HI> Water, nor <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Medicine
<PB N="57" REF="71"/>
can be proper. But in all other Ca∣ses
(excepting those only attended
with a Bleeding or <HI>Haemorrhage</HI>) they
are not only safe, but exceedingly be∣neficial.
More particularly, their won∣derful
Efficacy has been often experi∣enc'd
in <HI>Cachexies, Scurvies;</HI> in the
<HI>Stone, Rheumatism</HI> and <HI>Jaundice;</HI> in
<HI>Hypocondriacal</HI> and <HI>Hysterical</HI> Affecti∣ons;
in <HI>Vapours</HI> and <HI>Melancholy;</HI> in
<HI>Palsies, Epilepsies,</HI> and other <HI>Cephalick</HI>
and <HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers; in Disorders
of the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Bowels;</HI> Obstru∣ctions
of the <HI>Liver</HI> and <HI>Gall-bladder;</HI>
in <HI>green</HI> and <HI>breeding</HI> Sicknesses; in
<HI>Barrenness</HI> and <HI>Weakness</HI> after Child∣birth;
in Obstructions of the <HI>Monthly</HI>
Purgations; and all other peculiar Dis∣eases
of the <HI>Sex.</HI> And truly, if a Per∣son
afflicted with a low, broken or ten∣der
Constitution, suffering under the
tedious Pains and Inquietudes of any of
the lingering Distempers now men∣tion'd,
where the <HI>Viscera</HI> or Bowels are
yet sound, wou'd know the fittest Place
<PB N="58" REF="72"/>
in <HI>Britain</HI> to spend their Life-time with
the greatest Ease and Pleasure; take all
the Advantages of the Place together,
the Agreeableness of the Waters to the
Stomach; the Certainty of their pro∣curing
a good Appetite, when it fails;
and the no less certain Consequence
thereupon, Freedom and Chearfulness
of Spirits; the regular way of living;
the Excellency of the Provisions; the
Warmness, Cleanness and Neatness of
the Housing; the Conveniency of the
free, fresh and open Air of the neigh∣bouring
Downs for Exercise; the Easi∣ness
of the Amusements; and the Ad∣vantage
of what Conversation one de∣sires;
I say, taking all these Advanta∣ges
together, I can affirm, from near
twenty Years Experience, without Sus∣picion
of Flattery, or Fear of Contra∣diction,
that <HI>Bath</HI> is the Place.</P>
<P>XXXII. Some wise and frugal Peo∣ple
think the mere drinking of these
Waters, for some time, without taking
<PB N="59" REF="73"/>
any Medicine, either before or with
them, may be sufficient to remove any
of the Chronical Ails they are good
for; but those, if they are really ill,
in any other manner, except mere Loss
of Appetite, are generally convinc'd,
upon Trial, at their own Expence, that
they neither ought to begin a Course of
the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, without a previous
cleansing of the Stomach and Bowels,
lest they wash into the Blood through
the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> by the perpetual Dilution
of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, those Impurities,
which constantly cleave to them; nor
that they ought to expect a perfect Cure
of a long-breeding and lingering Di∣stemper,
without the Assistance of those
other Medicines which are reckon'd Spe∣cifick
in the Case; and to which the
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters are so pleasant and so as∣sistent
a Vehicle. For it is but Pru∣dence
to bring all the Forces one can
raise, against so potent and so formi∣dable
an Enemy as a Chronical Di∣stemper.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="74"/>
XXXIII. It is not possible to lay down
a general Rule, about the Quantity of
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters, which it is convenient to
drink daily; that being to be varied ac∣cording
to some Circumstances of the
Patient, and the Nature of the Distem∣per:
Strong, full and large Bodies bear
more Waters than tender, thin and
lesser ones; the younger more than the
elder; those of strong and firm, than
those of weak and relax'd <HI>Nerves;</HI> those
who labour under the <HI>Gravel</HI> and <HI>Rheu∣matism,</HI>
than those who are disorder'd
in the <HI>Alimentary</HI> Passages, or are sub∣ject
to <HI>Scorbutick</HI> or <HI>Nervous</HI> Weaknesses,
and the like. But in general, it were
to be wish'd, that <HI>People</HI> who come to
<HI>Bath</HI> for their Healths, drunk less daily
than they commonly do; and allow'd
more Time for a Chronical Distemper.
I think it may be safely advanc'd, That
any Quantity greater than an <HI>English
Quart,</HI> in a Morning, drunk in two
Hours Time, half a Pint every half
Hour, is more than what is reasonable.
<PB N="61" REF="75"/>
For, drinking in this Proportion, all
the rest of the Day; at Meals, <HI>to wit,</HI>
in the Afternoon, and going to Bed,
they must take down no less than five
Pounds in about sixteen Hours; <HI>viz.</HI>
two Pounds in the Morning, a Pint and
an half with Wine at Dinner, half a
Pound in the Afternoon, and as much
at Supper and at going to Bed. This
every Body must see is fully sufficient to
answer all the Intentions of drinking
<HI>Mineral</HI> Waters. A greater Quantity
than this will serve only to distend and
<HI>relax</HI> the Alimentary Passages; to force
its way through the largest, and most
patent <HI>Tubes;</HI> and to propagate the Cir∣culation
through the Branches and <HI>In∣osculations</HI>
of the larger Arteries and
Veins, where the least Foulness and
fewest Obstructions can happen: So
that it will scarce ever reach the finest
Capillary Vessels, in which alone the
Danger lies. And the late <HI>Ingenious</HI>
and <HI>Learned Doctor James Keill</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 49. <HI>Tentam, Medico-Physic. Jac. Keill.</HI></NOTE> has
<PB N="62" REF="76"/>
made it evident, that the most expedi∣tious
way of altering the whole Mass of
the Blood, by <HI>Mineral</HI> Waters, is,
by small and frequent Draughts. In
most Cases a <HI>Pint</HI> in a Morning is suf∣ficient,
and in low Constitutions and
Disorders in the Alimentary Passages,
tending to Vomiting and Purging, <HI>half
a Pint</HI> is enough; and whatever Quan∣tity
is to be drunk, 'tis always best to
take it in small Quantities, and at good
Distances, provided it come within the
Compass of the Morning. What is
drunk at Meals, tho' cold, yet being
fresh, and not altogether drain'd of its
Principles and Virtues, contributes near
as much to the Cure, as that which is
taken in the Morning. The Afternoon
and Evening's Draughts are more <HI>arbi∣trary,</HI>
and must depend upon the Ob∣servation
of the Patient, as he finds
them agreeable to his Stomach, and sit
easily or not: Where too great Quan∣tities
have not been swallow'd down in
a Morning, they are very proper, pro∣vided
they be in Proportion to the
<PB N="63" REF="77"/>
Morning's Quantity, and never taken
under four or five Hours after Dinner;
and that at Night, not under two or
three Hours after Supper; these times
being the most proper to assist the Di∣gestion,
and carry off the Remains of
the Food. But the Truth is, as no∣thing
is more necessary, in a Course of
these Waters, than setting out right at
first; so nothing requires more the Ex∣perience
and Judgment of a Physician,
than the accommodating the previous
Preparations, the Quantities to be drunk,
and the Medicines to be taken with them,
to the Distemper and the Constitution
of the Patient. For these once settl'd,
the rest generally goes on successfully.</P>
<P>XXXIV. I come now, in the last
place, to make a few Observations up∣on
irregular <HI>Gouts.</HI> When the original
Constitution is broken and impair'd;
the Parts subdu'd and full of <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts;
the Force of the Circulation, by Age
and frequent Fits, weaken'd, and con∣tinu'd
only through the Inosculations
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
of the great Vessels; the Humour re∣coils
inwardly upon the Bowels. And
this is call'd an irregular <HI>Gout.</HI> While
it is in any Joynt, or any <HI>Muscular</HI> Part,
it is still esteem'd regular, tho' the near∣er
it comes to those outward Parts, the
least remote from the Heart and Bow∣els,
the nearer it comes to an irregular
one, and so consequently to its last and
fatal Stages. To which it seldom comes
unattended; for it generally brings the
<HI>Stone</HI> along with it: Of which it mayn't
be amiss to make this one Observation,
to wit,</P>
<P>XXXIV. That the Chalk-Stones
voided from the Joynts of <HI>Gouty</HI> Per∣sons,
and the Gravel Stones found in
the Bladders of such as were afflicted
with this Distemper (perhaps the Stones
found sometimes in the Gall-Bladder,
but of this I can affirm nothing) are,
to all their essential Qualities, the same.
They have both the same Colour, Taste
and Smell; they yield both the same
Principles, and produce the same Ap∣pearances,
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
when treated chymically.
They have both the same internal Tex∣ture
of Parts, as far as can be known,
and even the same outward Shape, when
unbroken and unconfin'd by hard Sub∣stances;
and they generally happen to
one and the same Person: At least it
seldom comes to pass, that any one is
much troubl'd with the <HI>Gout,</HI> but he
has the <HI>Stone</HI> at last. And this shews
that they are both owing to the same
Conformation of Parts, and other ge∣neral
Causes. It is true, some have
suffer'd violently by the <HI>Stone,</HI> who ne∣ver
had the <HI>Gout;</HI> but this may be ow∣ing
to a special, hereditary Narrowness
and Stiffness of the Urinary Passages,
in respect of the other Vessels; and a
particular unhappy Texture of Parts, as
it happens to some other Organs in other
Persons: For fat People have smaller
Vessels in proportion to their Stature
than lean. But in the general, it is pret∣ty
constant, that those who suffer long
under severe Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> seldom
escape the <HI>Stone.</HI> Dr. <HI>Cyprianus,</HI> the
<PB N="66" REF="80"/>
late ingenious Cutter for the <HI>Stone,</HI> had
observ'd, that those who only drunk
Malt Liquor were seldom ever violent∣ly
afflicted with that Distemper: And
among many hundred he had cut, he
had never found one, who had only
drunk Ale or Beer. Whether this was
owing to the lesser Quantity of Salts in
those Liquors than in Wine, or to the
Slipperiness they induce upon the Bow∣els
and other Vessels, or to both, I will
not here take upon me to determine.
But I believe the Fact is, both in the
<HI>Stone</HI> and acquir'd <HI>Gouts,</HI> that those who
only drink Malt Liquors, without Wine
or Spirits, are seldom violently afflicted
with either. And for the same Reasons
it comes to pass, that the <HI>Gouts</HI> and
<HI>Gravel</HI> of the Sex, are seldom so severe
as in Men; they generally drinking
less Wine, and feeding less of Fish and
Flesh Meats. And that in the <HI>Gouts,</HI>
both of Men and Women, who drink
no Wine nor Spirits, any little proper
Medicine has entirely kept off the Pain,
and prevented the Fits. I know an
<PB N="67" REF="81"/>
antient Gentleman, formerly treated
pretty roughly by the <HI>Gout,</HI> who drink∣ing
only Malt Liquors, has, for seve∣ral
Years, with certain Success, entire∣ly
kept off the Pains and Fits of the
<HI>Gout,</HI> by taking only every Morning,
regularly, a Pint of warm White Wine
Whey, to encourage Perspiration:
Which when he neglects to do, they
as certainly return. We may therefore
conclude, 1. That since the <HI>Gout</HI> and
<HI>Gravel</HI> Stones are, as to their essential
Qualities, much the same; and since
'tis hardly possible to account for the
breeding of the <HI>Stone,</HI> but from a par∣ticular
Narrowness and Stiffness of the
Urinary Vessels, and an abundance of
such Salts in the Fluids; it is highly
probable, that the <HI>Gout</HI> must proceed
from the same general Causes: And
this is some kind of Confirmation of
the two first Propositions laid down in
the beginning of this Discourse. 2. The
same Method and Medicines that have
been deduc'd from the first two Propo∣sitions,
for relieving <HI>Gouty</HI> Pessons, in
<PB N="68" REF="82"/>
the Intervals of the Fits, will likewise
serve for preventing the Encrease of the
<HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel;</HI> as we are certain they
do from the best Experience and Prac∣tice
in this Case. I will now go on
with my purpose, and consider an ir∣regular
<HI>Gout,</HI> fix'd on these three great
Instruments of Human Life, the <HI>Head,</HI>
the <HI>Stomach,</HI> and <HI>Guts.</HI></P>
<P>XXXV. When the <HI>Gout</HI> has seiz'd
on the Head, it is to be treated as any
other violent Head-ach, or as an In∣flammation
on the Brain, or its Mem∣branes;
by Bleeding at the Arm or <HI>Ju∣gular;</HI>
Cupping on the Back; Blister∣ing
between the Shoulders, but especi∣ally
on the Ancles, to give the <HI>Gouty</HI>
Humour a Vent downwards. In young
and strong Constitutions, <HI>Mercurial</HI> and
<HI>Antimonial</HI> Vomits will do Wonders,
tho' they are seldom to be ventur'd up∣on
in any Constitution above Forty.
The Intention here to be had in View
(as in all other irregular <HI>Gouts</HI>) is to
expel the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour outwardly upon
<PB N="69" REF="83"/>
the Muscles or Joynts, and to fix it
there. Wherefore in order to carry it
to as great a Distance from the noble
Organs as may be, a free Passage is to
be open'd to it on the Limbs, by bli∣stering
the Ancles and Wrists; and to
promote its Conveyance thither, gen∣tle
Stomach Purgers are to be pour'd
down continually, two or three Spoon∣fuls
every third Hour, till the Effect is
obtain'd. And for this end, I recom∣mend
principally Tincture of <HI>Hiera Pi∣cra</HI>
with compound Spirit of <HI>Lavender,</HI>
and a few Drops of Tincture of <HI>Snake∣weed,</HI>
and Tincture of <HI>Diambra,</HI> as
being one of the most powerful Expel∣lents,
and an excellent Strengthner of
the Stomach and Bowels. Its common
Mischief is little to be minded here, for
the forcing Blood or the Piles will car∣ry
the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour along with it;
and these Disorders are but Trifles in
respect of an irregular <HI>Gout.</HI> This Me∣thod
will either spend the <HI>Gouty</HI> Hu∣mour,
or turn it to a regular Fit. But
here Care is to be taken that the Me∣dicines
<PB N="70" REF="84"/>
be not too hot, especially in
young sanguine Complexions, lest an
Inflammation on the Brain, or its Mem∣branes
shou'd turn to a Phrenzy or Fe∣ver:
But there is less Danger of this,
because the <HI>Gout</HI> in the Head seldom
happens to the younger, except through
much and long Intemperance.</P>
<P>XXXVI. The <HI>Gout</HI> in the Stomach
is a common and less dangerous Case;
for the <HI>Gout</HI> seldom comes on and goes
off without touching there by the way.
In the slight Touches of it, any little
Stomach Purge will set it a packing.
But it is more obstinate towards the De∣cline
of Life; when it settles in a con∣stant
Pain, nauseating and kecking in
the Stomach. Vomits are reckon'd
dangerous in the <HI>Gout,</HI> lest they shou'd
derive the Humour on the Stomach:
But there can be room for no such a
Suspicion here. Wherefore upon the
first Seizure of the Stomach, a Vomit
is instantly to be administred, and re∣peated
according to the occasion of the
<PB N="71" REF="85"/>
Case: After that <HI>Hiera Picra</HI> as is be∣fore
caution'd and qualify'd, with a hot
<HI>Sinapism,</HI> or Blister on the Ancles: And
last of all, the highest Cordials, and
most generous Wines, may be freely
indulg'd, without fear of Inflammation.
Among the Cordials, I wou'd recom∣mend
the <HI>Electuarium de Ovo,</HI> as con∣taining
<HI>Camphir</HI> (the most constant and
active <HI>Diaphoretic,</HI> and the most useful
one for that purpose) and some other of
the richest Cordials. After all this Ma∣nagement,
shou'd the <HI>Gout</HI> still conti∣nue
in the Stomach, and become habi∣tual
(which it seldom does after such a
Method taken in time) nothing but a
long Course of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters with
<HI>Steel,</HI> Bitters, and gentle Stomach Pur∣gers,
a regular Diet, and proper Exer∣cise,
can effectually cure it.</P>
<P>XXXVII. The <HI>Gout</HI> in the Guts, on
its first Seizure, may be easily treated,
as a bilious <HI>Cholic;</HI> only the <HI>Opiats,</HI>
commonly and justly given in the <HI>Cho∣lic,</HI>
are not here to be us'd, but in the
<PB N="72" REF="86"/>
last Extremity. But this Distemper
ought to be treated altogether in the
manner prescrib'd in the former Section,
about the <HI>Gout</HI> in the Stomach.</P>
<P>XXXVIII. There remains but one
Distinction more of the <HI>Gout,</HI> and one
which has not hitherto been much con∣sider'd:
For as the <HI>Cholic</HI> or <HI>Asthma</HI> is,
so the <HI>Gout</HI> may be, divided into the
Humorous and <HI>Nervous;</HI> tho' this Di∣stinction
depends more upon the Com∣plexion
of the Patient, than the ab∣stracted
Nature of the Distemper. The
Humorous <HI>Gout</HI> happens only to People
of grosser Habits, more robust Consti∣tutions,
and more stiff and springy. <HI>Fi∣bres,</HI>
and is the <HI>Gout</HI> which I have been
hitherto treating. All I can further
add to what has been said, is, that un∣der
the Fit White Wines are more eli∣gible
than Red; because those part
more readily with their Spirits, and are
less astringent than these. And for the
same Reason in the Intervals, the Red
is preferable to the White: Tho' nei∣ther
<PB N="73" REF="87"/>
of them, in either Case, be useful
or necessary, but because Custom or
Habit, which it is not safe to alter sud∣denly,
has made them so. For in all
the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, where little Flesh
Meat, and no Wine is us'd; and in
<HI>Spain,</HI> where they use them very mo∣derately;
and among the wild Moun∣taineers
in the <HI>Northern</HI> Countries; and
the lower Rank of the People in every
Country, where they can procure nei∣ther,
there is little or no <HI>Gout.</HI> Rub∣bing
the Part affected with a soft Hand,
or warm Napkin, as strongly as the Pa∣tient
can bear it, is the ready way to
make the Humour perspire in the Fit.
And Cold Bathing, and rubbing with a
Flesh Brush, Morning and Night, are
some of the most certain outward Means,
to bring Strength and Nourishment in∣to
it, in the Intervals.</P>
<P>XXXIX. Having mention'd Cold
Bathing, I am the more willing to set
this so safe and universal a Mean, for
the Recovery of the weaken'd Parts,
<PB N="74" REF="88"/>
after a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in a clearer
light; because a groundless Jealousy of
the Danger of its throwing the <HI>Gout</HI>
inwardly, has made it universally dis∣us'd.
Nothing made a greater Noise
upon its first Restoration, and nothing
cou'd have sunk lower in its Reputation
since, than Cold Bathing: And it will
always happen so in things fitted to the
vulgar Capacity, when they are uni∣versally
prescrib'd, without Distinction
and without Choice. Those who know
how greatly Foulness and Uncleanliness
promote Epidemical, Pestilential and
Infectious Distempers, can only tell
what Cleanness contributes to Health.
The <HI>Eastern</HI> People (whose Laziness,
in other things, is owing to their Cli∣mate)
have found Cold Bathing and
Ablution so necessary to their Health,
that they have made it a part of their
Religion, as it is a Precept of a Reli∣gion
of a nobler Extract, from whence
they borrow'd it. If the modern Do∣ctrine
be true, as I really think it is,
that the smallest <HI>Fibres,</HI> or those of the
<PB N="75" REF="89"/>
last Division, in animal Bodies, be not
open and pervious, but solid; then it
may be affirm'd, that warm Water (I
mean pure Element, endu'd with no
Medical Principle) by the active Power
of its Heat, must necessarily relax such
<HI>Fibres.</HI> And that cold Water from the
<HI>Nitre,</HI> which produces its Coldness,
must necessarily contract them. The
Tumour of the <HI>Gout,</HI> like other inflam∣matory
Swellings, is owing to an Ob∣struction,
or to the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humours flow∣ing
faster by the <HI>Arteries,</HI> than it can
be receiv'd by the Veins; the Smallest
or Capillary Vessels are thereby extend∣ed
and stretch'd, beyond their natural
Power of Restitution; so that when the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Humour is spent by Perspiration,
or driven into the Veins by the succes∣sive
Stroaks of the Circulation; the Ob∣struction
remov'd; and the Pain entire∣ly
gone off; the Vessels continue thus
widen'd and stretch'd, beyond their
Power of Restitution, for a long time
after. And this is the sole Cause of the
long and tedious Weakness on the Part
<PB N="76" REF="90"/>
after the Fit is over; which wou'd yet
continue longer, did not the Coolness
and Pressure of the Ambient Air, and
the now sufferable Weight of the Cloath∣ing,
give the first Impulses to the <HI>Fi∣bres</HI>
towards their contracting them∣selves
again. Now nothing in Nature
can so readily or so certainly bring this
about, as Bathing in cold Water: For
the <HI>Nitre</HI> in the Water, which is the
Cause of its Coolness; and also the uni∣form
equal Pressure upon the Part,
which arises from its Gravity and Flui∣dity,
concur to communicate to the
<HI>Fibres</HI> a strong and lasting Impulse to∣wards
restoring themselves to their na∣tural
State of Contraction. And the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Humour now being spent, and
the Obstruction entirely remov'd, as is
suppos'd, how can any such Humour
be translated upon another part, by
cold Bathing, more than if the Person
had never had the <HI>Gout?</HI> Now to make
this Remedy still more effectual, after
a previous Course of cold Bathing, cold
Pumping on the part, by the Force
<PB N="77" REF="91"/>
of a Pump, or the Fall of Water from
a Height, may be conveniently us'd:
The wonderful Efficacy of which is no
less certain here, than it is in White
Swellings on the Joints, where, I think,
it is a never failing Remedy. I am ve∣ry
well inform'd of the Case of a very
considerable Person, who, for many
Years before, being tormented with
constant and uninterrupted Pains of the
<HI>Gout,</HI> Summer and Winter, by daily
Bathing in a Tub of cold Water, has,
for these several Years by-past, brought
them to regular and periodical Fits, at
the Cardinal and Critical Seasons only;
and of no longer Duration than usual.
I know also an ingenious Physician,
who, after a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> goes dai∣ly
into the cold Bath, till the part has
recover'd its natural Strength, which
constantly happens in much less time
than it wou'd do otherwise. And many
others, who are considerably strength∣en'd,
and preserv'd from catching Cold,
by cold Bathing in the Intervals of the
<HI>Gout;</HI> tho' this Practice is very cauti∣ously
<PB N="78" REF="92"/>
to be gone about by the old and
weak.</P>
<P>XL. The <HI>Nervous</HI> or Flying <HI>Gout</HI>
(both which I take to be the same, and
to differ from the Windy <HI>Gout,</HI> which
is nothing but a <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> or <HI>Hy∣sterical</HI>
Symptom) is owing to the Weak∣ness,
Softness, or Relaxation of the
<HI>Nerves</HI> of those Persons who labour un∣der
it. All the Solids of the Body are
made up of small Threads or Filaments
of different Natures and Textures. They
are divided into the <HI>Fleshy,</HI> the <HI>Ner∣vous,</HI>
the <HI>Membranous,</HI> and the <HI>Bony;</HI>
and make up the solid Substance of the
whole Animal Body: But all of them
agree in a greater or lesser Degree of
Springiness or Elasticity. And it is ob∣servable,
that some of the most perfect
springy Bodies, are made of animal and
vegetable Substances; such as Ivory,
Ebony and Whalebone. Wherein the
general Nature of Elasticity consists, or
what is the particular Cause of the emi∣nent
Springiness of animal <HI>Fibres,</HI> is as
<PB N="79" REF="93"/>
hard to explain as conceive; which
notwithstanding, is the noblest Instru∣ment
of all the Actions and Functions
of an animated Body. All the At∣tempts
hitherto made to discover the
particular Nature of a <HI>Contractile</HI> and
<HI>Distractile</HI> Animal <HI>Fibre,</HI> to me seem in∣sufficient
and conjectural. <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI>
has discover'd, by his Glasses, that the
smallest <HI>Fibre</HI> of an <HI>Elephant</HI> is not big∣ger
than that of the smallest <HI>Insect:</HI>
And if the modern System of Genera∣tion
be just, to wit, That an Animal
or Plant comes from another lesser one;
then Growth is nothing, but the un∣folding
the original <HI>Membranes</HI> and <HI>Fi∣bres:</HI>
And the Length of every <HI>Fibre</HI> is
the same in the youngest, as in the full
grown Animal or Plant. So Growth
and Motion both, that is, the whole
Business of the Animal Life, is owing
to the Springiness of these <HI>Fibres.</HI> The
best Resemblance I can make of them,
is that of a long Hair, or small twisted.
Gut, which, when stretch'd to any
length beyond its natural State, will
<PB N="80" REF="94"/>
restore it self again to its former Di∣mensions.
And in this Contraction
and Restitution of an Animal <HI>Fibre,</HI>
the greatest Mysteries of the whole Stru∣cture
consist. As there are some Peo∣ple
who have hard, gross, stiff Hair,
with a strong Spring; so there are o∣thers,
who have soft, fine, weak Hair,
with a feeble Spring: And generally
speaking, as the Hair is, so the Threads,
Filaments and <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Body are.
Those whose <HI>Fibres</HI> are soft, fine, weak
and of a feeble Spring, are generally
said to be of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> and liable to
<HI>Nervous</HI> Distempers. And here we may
observe the Difference between more
tense and stiffer <HI>Fibres,</HI> and more sprin∣gy
and elastick ones. All the <HI>Fibres</HI>
of the Body are in a State of <HI>Distension,</HI>
as is evident from the gaping Lips of
Wounds. Two Persons may have <HI>Fi∣bres</HI>
of the same Degree of Springiness
and Elasticity; and yet in their natural
State, and original Formation, the <HI>Fi∣bres</HI>
of the one may be more stretch'd,
bent and distracted, and consequently
<PB N="81" REF="95"/>
more stiff and tense than those of the
other; whereby the more stiff or tense
<HI>Fibres</HI> making a greater Resistance, and
being with more Difficulty stretch'd and
widen'd, will give more Pain, when a
gross Fluid passes thro' them, than less
stiff or tense <HI>Fibres</HI> will. Which gives an
Account why of two Persons, both of
them of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> the one shou'd
have the <HI>Gout,</HI> the other be free from
it. Persons of weak <HI>Nerves</HI> must neces∣sarily
have less Strength, a weaker Pulse
and Digestion; a slower and more im∣perfect
Circulation of the Fluids, and
a less free and perfect Perspiration; and
if they happen to indulge in strong
Meats and generous Wines, they must
become subject to <HI>Hysteric, Hypochon∣driac</HI>
and <HI>Cephalic</HI> Disorders. But if, toge∣ther
with weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> a greater De∣gree
of Tensity or Stiffness be join'd,
under the same Circumstances, they
will be liable to <HI>Gouty,</HI> together with
the foremention'd Disorders. But by
reason of the Natural Weakness and
less Original Springiness of their <HI>Ner∣vous
<PB N="82" REF="96"/>
Fibres,</HI> the Fits of these <HI>Gouts</HI> will
be less painful and more constant.</P>
<P>XLI. <HI>Coroll.</HI> From this Account of
the <HI>Nervous Gout</HI> and other <HI>Nervous</HI> Di∣stempers,
'tis plain, all Evacuations (ex∣cept
the most gentle) must be prejudi∣cial
in them. Gentle Vomits, as they
cleanse the Stomach and Bowels, and
principally as they free the <HI>Nerves</HI> from
all extraneous Bodies, and increase the
Perspiration, by the violent Convulsions
and Contractions of the internal Mus∣cles
and Membranes; Blisters, as they
open the Obstructions of the small Ves∣sels,
by their external, and thin the
sizy Juices by their internal Efficacy; I
say, both these Evacuations, may not
only safely, but with great Advantage,
be us'd in <HI>Nervous</HI> Cases. But all vio∣lent
Purges and excessive Bleedings, are
religiously to be abstain'd from, as en∣creasing
the original Weakness. Pur∣ges
in People of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> in Chro∣nical
Cases, carry off a great part of
the Nourishment of almost three Days.
<PB N="83" REF="97"/>
Vomits, on the contrary, carry off
only those Crudities, that send up to
the Head and <HI>Nervous</HI> System, the noxi∣ous
Fumes and Vapours that cause their
Misery. Purges relax and weaken the
<HI>Fibres</HI> of a natural and necessary Fun∣ction,
to wit, those of Digestion:
Whereas Vomits can but weaken the
Action of <HI>Muscular Fibres,</HI> less us'd,
strong in themselves, and not so neces∣sary
to Concoction; as is evident from
<HI>Monsieur Chirac</HI>'s Experiment about Vo∣miting.
Purges carry off little, but
what wou'd otherwise pass off, in time,
by the natural Course of the <HI>Peristaltic</HI>
Motion; and generally leave behind
them what wants the inverted Mo∣tion,
as they found it. Whereas Vo∣mits
pump up those Crudities, that
Nature it self wou'd (gladly, so to
speak) throw up, by the same Or∣gans,
the same way Nature tends.
<HI>Lastly,</HI> sour and acid Humours, lodg'd
in the Stomach and Guts, must neces∣sarily
weaken both, more than either
gentle Vomits, or Purges possibly can;
<PB N="84" REF="98"/>
with this Difference tho', that a very
gentle, natural, or artificial Purging,
continu'd for any long time, in Persons
of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> shall both weaken the
Person, and waste the <HI>Muscular</HI> Flesh.
Whereas you shall find, after several
Months daily Vomiting, in a Sea Voy∣age,
a Day or two's Refreshment ashoar,
restores the Person to a greater Degree
of Alacrity and Strength than before:
Whence it comes to pass, that Persons
of weak <HI>Nerves</HI> are so much reliev'd and
rais'd by Vomits; and, on the contrary,
so much sunk and depress'd by rough
and strong Purges in Chronical Cases.
What farther is to be expected in such
Cases, is to be done by a regular and
strict Diet, fitted to the mere Necessities
of Nature. Strengthners of the Di∣gestive
Faculties, (and here the <HI>Bark</HI>
and <HI>Steel</HI> claim the first place, as being
the most certain Strengthners of weak
<HI>Nerves</HI>) gentle and constant Exercise,
as encouraging the Perspiration: <HI>Aro∣matic</HI>
and Spicy Bitters, Volatile and
attenuating Medicines, and whatever
<PB N="85" REF="99"/>
may be thought fit to nourish, comfort
and support the Animal Functions.</P>
<P>XLII. Having had frequent occasion
to mention the <HI>Bark,</HI> as being absolute∣ly
necessary to the Subject I treat; it
may not be amiss to remove one Obje∣ction
against it; and the only one I
have ever heard or read made with any
Shew of Reason. I have taken as much
of it my self, and as often, and have
prescrib'd it as freely as any of my Age,
I believe; and never observ'd it, either
in my self or others, do any Hurt, ex∣cept
when it has been injudiciously and
improperly prescrib'd, and that in con∣tinu'd
acute Cases only. The Objecti∣on
is, that it often leaves behind it a
bad Habit, a <HI>Scorbutic, Cachectic,</HI> or
<HI>Hectic</HI> Constitution; bad <HI>Lungs, Li∣ver,</HI>
or <HI>Stomach;</HI> or some of the great
<HI>Viscera</HI> spoil'd or corrupted. But the
Mistake in this Objection lies here, to
wit, that few Constitutions break, and
seldom any of these great Organs be∣come
vitiated; but they begin with an
<PB N="86" REF="100"/>
intermittent or periodical <HI>Fever.</HI> And
these I have constantly observ'd to be
of that kind, and approaching that Sea∣son,
which <HI>Sydenham</HI> most judiciously
distinguishes from <HI>Vernal</HI> ones, and calls
<HI>Autumnal Agues;</HI> and are indeed sympto∣matical
only, arising from beginning
Obstructions in the whole Habit, or in
these greater <HI>Viscera:</HI> where all Nature
is at work, and the whole Organs la∣bour
and struggle to thin the sizy Flu∣ids,
and to open the obstructed Bowels;
but not being able to bring about this
End, Nature succumbs after every Fe∣verish
Fit, thus excited, into a worse
State. And even here too, the <HI>Bark</HI>
does all its proper Office, in quenching,
to wit, the violent <HI>Paroxysms</HI> of the <HI>Fe∣ver,</HI>
which only can endanger the Life
of the Patient: and allows time for other
Medicines to act. But when the Ha∣bit
is already broken, and the great
<HI>Viscera</HI> already unsound; it cannot be
blamed that it do's not restore these; no∣thing
like that being expected from it,
or ascribed to it. When the <HI>Bark</HI> has
<PB N="87" REF="101"/>
extinguish'd the Feverish Fits, which
threaten Death to the Patient, a Re∣prieve
is obtain'd: in which, by deobstru∣ent
and attenuating Medicines, Health
and Life may be secur'd. In relax'd
<HI>Nerves</HI> of the <HI>Primae viae;</HI> in almost all
sorts of <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Cephalic</HI> Diseases
depending on these; in all <HI>Gouty</HI> Disor∣ders
in the <HI>Alimentary</HI> Passages; in all
<HI>Nervous Gouts;</HI> in all Intermittent and
<HI>Periodical</HI> Distempers, or Pains what∣soever:
'tis preferable to any thing hi∣therto
us'd; only in very cold Sto∣machs
and Constitutions, I have found a
Decoction of the <HI>Indian Bark,</HI> by some
call'd <HI>Elatherium,</HI> to be yet more effe∣ctual
and strengthning; as it will also
more readily remove the Periodical
Disorders of such. But the <HI>Peruvian
Bark</HI> I never found did any Hurt, but
in acute continu'd Cases; where it runs
into violent Purgings: And in the
<HI>Monthly Purgations</HI> of the Sex, which
sometimes it will obstruct; and there∣fore
it ought not to be given without
<PB N="88" REF="102"/>
<HI>Steel;</HI> which ought also to be added,
when it is given in Chronical Cases.
It were to be wish'd only, in these Cases
it gave the same Relief the second and
succeeding times it does the first.</P>
<P>XLIII. I have formerly observ'd, that
when the <HI>Gout</HI> becomes dispers'd over
the whole Habit, or fix'd and settl'd on
a particular Joint, <HI>Mercurial</HI> Vomits
and Purges were absolutely necessary to
dislodge it. But there is one Species of
the <HI>Gout</HI> which miserably torments its
Subjects, and yet yields not to that,
or very rarely to any of the Methods
in use; I mean the <HI>Gout</HI> on the Hip∣Joint,
when fix'd and constant, com∣monly
call'd the <HI>Sciatica;</HI> and yet treat∣ed
after the manner I'm to explain,
never fails of a perfect Cure. The
Foundation of the Method I had from
the late <HI>most Learn'd and Eminent Physi∣cian
Doctor Archibald Pitcairn;</HI> he hav∣ing
communicated it to me under no
Restriction of Secrecy, I think my self
<PB N="89" REF="103"/>
oblig'd to publish it to the World, for
the Benefit of the afflicted. I have us'd
it with great Success these several Years,
and I think have improv'd it in several
Particulars of the Management; and so
never fail of a perfect Cure, if the Di∣stemper
is a genuine <HI>Sciatica,</HI> tho' of
many Years standing; and after having
baffled all other Attempts. It consists
in taking from one, two, three Drams,
to half an Ounce (according to the
Strength of the Patient's Stomach) of
the Aetherial Oyl of <HI>Turpentine</HI> (that
which comes off between the Spirit and
Oyl, in drawing off the common Oyl
of <HI>Turpentine</HI>) in triple the Quantity of
Virgin Honey in a Morning fasting,
for four, five, six, or eight Days at far∣thest,
intermitting a Day now and then,
as the Patient's Occasions require, or
his Stomach suffers by it: In drinking,
after it is down, large Draughts of Sack∣Whey,
to settle it on the Stomach, and
carry it into the Blood: And lastly, in
taking a proper Dose of <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Pills
<PB N="90" REF="104"/>
every Night, that Day the Medicine is
swallow'd. This Course never fails to
remove the Violence of the Pain, and
to leave only a Weakness on the Part.
To remove the grosser Remains, and
strengthen the weaken'd Part, I order
a Dram to two Drams of Flower of
Brimstone, for some time, twice a
Day, in a Tea Cup full of Milk. If
through great Intemperance, or a vi∣olent
Cold, the Patient relapses, I
order the Repetition of the former
Medicines for a Day or two, which
commonly sets it a packing. And last∣ly,
to strengthen the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> and
enliven the Spirits, I advise <HI>Bath</HI> or
<HI>Spaa</HI> Waters with <HI>Steel,</HI> and Bitters
with <HI>Volatiles;</HI> and perhaps pumping
on the Part affected, which never fails
to perfect the Cure in a genuine <HI>Scia∣tic.</HI>
And I hope it may be of some
use, to have a Method of Cure for this
Distemper, so plainly laid down, so
effectual in it self, so easy to the Pa∣tient,
and so restorative of his Consti∣tution
<PB N="91" REF="105"/>
in general, in respect of those
Tortures and the nauseous Load of Me∣dicines
the afflicted are forc'd to go
through in common Practice. The
great Efficacy of this Course consists
in the <HI>Aetherial Oyl:</HI> It has been com∣mon
to prescribe a few Drops of the
Oyl of <HI>Turpentine</HI> in cold <HI>Rheumatisms</HI>
and fix'd Pains on the Joints: But this
seldom proves effectual in the <HI>Sciati∣ca:</HI>
Whereas this <HI>Aetherial Oyl,</HI> hav∣ing
all the Penetration of the <HI>Spirit,</HI>
together with the Softness and Deter∣gency
of the finest <HI>Balsam,</HI> but chief∣ly
being of such Lightness, that any
Quantity of it may be given, that can
stay on the Stomach, or be kept down
by frequent Draughts of any soft Li∣quor,
especially Sack-Whey: which by
its Milkiness uniting readily with the
<HI>AEtherial Oyl;</HI> Penetrates into the
least and finest Vessels, and the most
secret Recesses of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy;</HI>
opens their Obstructions; dissolves the
glutinous Gellies in the Joints; clean∣ses
<PB N="92" REF="106"/>
the insides of the <HI>Tubes,</HI> and makes
all pass by Perspiration. The Rule
whereby to accommodate the Dose
to the Patient, is to order it so, that
it mayn't be so much as to recoil up∣wards;
to prevent which, a large
Quantity of Sack-Whey is order'd:
And it seldom moves above once down∣wards;
but lest it shou'd go farther,
in the subsequent Doses, the Pills take
place.</P>
<P>XLIV. As to <HI>Topicks</HI> or outward Ap∣plications,
to ease or relieve the Part
affected in a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> they are
dangerous, unless discreetly manag'd.
In the frequently mention'd <HI>Cardinal</HI>
Fits of <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Autumn,</HI> when,
through Ignorance or Neglect of the
Methods hitherto laid down, they shall
happen <HI>Regular;</HI> I would by no means
encourage any such outward Applica∣tion
of what kind soever hitherto dis∣cover'd,
except in the very last Extre∣mities
of Pain. In the <HI>Regular Gouts</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="107"/>
at those Seasons, these Fits are not to
be tamper'd with in any manner, but
in the way formerly directed. For the
Habit being loaded with the <HI>Gouty</HI> Hu∣mour
and Salts, must be allow'd a time
to discharge it self, and drive them out of
the Body; otherwise Life must be en∣danger'd
by a <HI>putrid</HI> or <HI>malignant Fever:</HI>
And these being the Seasons when the
Humours naturally undergo some Al∣terations;
if the <HI>Gout</HI> be thrown upon
the extreme Parts, Nature must not
be disturb'd in her Operations: But
whatever is to be done, is to be direct∣ed
to encourage and fortify her in her
own way; and to assist her to expel
the last Breathings of this Humour up∣on
the Parts most remote from the
Head and Heart, the two Sources of
the Motion of all the Fluids: (which has
been the Intention of all the Methods
and Medicines prescrib'd in this Trea∣tise:)
For thus the Blood will be puri∣fy'd;
the Spirits reliev'd from their Op∣pression;
the Joints render'd pliable,
<PB N="94" REF="108"/>
and all the natural Functions set at liber∣ty.
When these Fits are over, any thing
that is just and probable, and attend∣ed
with no Danger, for lessening the
future Fits, and lengthening their In∣tervals,
may be try'd. But in the Fits
falling out of these Seasons; in the te∣dious
and lingering Fits of those bro∣ken
with Age, and Habitual <HI>Gouts;</HI> a
well chosen outward Application may
be safely and successfully us'd; especi∣ally,
if at the same time gentle Sto∣machic
Purges be administred; or a
Blister on the Ancles or Wrists be o∣pen'd,
to let out what may be repell'd
by the <HI>Topick;</HI> and thereby to secure
the noble Organs. For let Pretenders
brag what they will, I know of no out∣ward
Application, hitherto discover'd,
but what by its Sluggishness stops the
natural Perspiration: Or by its Activity
counter-acts the Direction of the Cir∣culation;
and consequently repels the
Humour in some degree or other. But
by thus opening a Way for the Hu∣mours
<PB N="95" REF="109"/>
to pass elsewhere, the Part af∣fected
may be much reliev'd by proper
Applications. <HI>Fuller</HI> and <HI>Bates</HI> give the
Forms of some; and Doctor <HI>Pitcairn</HI>
was exceeding fond of, and held as a
great Secret, that which himself has
publish'd in the last Edition of his Trea∣tises,
which is made of two Ounces of
white <HI>Arsenick,</HI> and six Ounces of <HI>Live-Lime
Stone,</HI> put into four Quarts of
boiling Water, set in a warm place
twenty four Hours: Stoups of this ap∣ply'd
warm to the Part, he had found
effectual and safe. That which I wou'd
rather recommend is Stoups of a De∣coction
of <HI>Butterburr, Ground-Pine</HI> or
<HI>Camomel</HI> Flowers, or any <HI>Aromatic</HI> bit∣ter
Plant in Milk; or a <HI>Pultis</HI> of the
Head of a Sack-Whey Posset, or any
such soft and active Application, to
moisten, soften, relax and open at first;
and towards the Decline of the Fit a
<HI>Mithridate</HI> or <HI>Venice Treacle</HI> Plaister;
the <HI>Emplastrum Stomachicum Magistrale,</HI>
or the like, to strengthen, warm and
<PB N="96" REF="110"/>
comfort; especially if with these last a
stomachic warm Purge be join'd. As
to <HI>Symptomatic Gouts,</HI> there can be no
place for them, in the Doctrine hi∣therto
laid down. For on the Suppo∣sition,
that the <HI>Gout</HI> is owing to a par∣ticular
Texture and Conformation of
Parts; where that Texture and Con∣formation
of Parts is, and the Mate∣rials
for forming the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour is
supply'd, there the <HI>Gout</HI> must necessa∣rily
be, without the Concurrence of
any other Distemper: And where these
are not, there it cannot be, let the
Person be subjected to what other Di∣stemper
soever. And if a Person be
subjected to two Distempers, in the
Cure of the one, due regard is to be
had to the Cure of the other. What
has been said is all I intend at present
on this Subject.</P>
<P>XLV. For a concluding Observa∣tion,
we shall take notice, as it is on∣ly
the <HI>Rich,</HI> the <HI>Lazy,</HI> the <HI>Voluptuous,</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="111"/>
who suffer most by the <HI>Gout:</HI> (I mean
<HI>Acquir'd Gouts,</HI> and those hereditary
ones enrag'd by <HI>Luxury</HI>) so those on∣ly,
who have spent their Life-time
under its Tortures best can tell, what
astonishing Miseries <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI>
bring upon Human Kind! When the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Humour has seiz'd upon all the
<HI>Noble Principles</HI> of Life, when it has
broken, subdu'd and obstructed all the
<HI>fine Pipes,</HI> and slender Passages, in
whose Openness and Soundness all the
<HI>Exquisite Sensations,</HI> all the <HI>Delicate
Usages</HI> of the <HI>Animal Faculties</HI> consist.
When nothing but Pain, and melan∣choly,
frightful Ideas, horrible Dreams
and black Despair remain; who wou'd
not have parted with the <HI>Richest De∣licacies,</HI>
the most <HI>Delicious Wines,</HI>
and the most <HI>Enticing Vices,</HI> for a
plain, simple Diet, an useful labo∣rious
Life, Freedom from Pain, and
a good <HI>Conscience?</HI> TEMPERANCE on∣ly,
Divine, Innocent, Indolent and
Joyous <HI>Temperance</HI> can Cure or ef∣fectually
