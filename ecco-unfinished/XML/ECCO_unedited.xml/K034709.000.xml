<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following traiterous <HI>Epistle</HI> from his Holiness to the Reverend Doctor in the Title Page, was no less surprizingly than happily inter∣cepted by the Master of a small <HI>English</HI> Vessel not far off from the <HI>British</HI> Coast. The Manner and Circumstances of it will, I doubt not, in due time, be communicated to the Publick by Authority: So that it shall be my Business at present only to inform the World how it came into my Hands, and for what Reasons I make so Seditious a Libel pub∣lick. It was transmitted to me by one of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, to whom it was delivered when first taken, with Leave to make what use of it I should judge best for the
<PB REF="3"/>
Interest of the Nation. I thought that if it were publish'd, it would stand for an unquestionable Testimony of the close Conjunction of the Parti∣zans at <HI>Rome</HI> to some amongst us in <HI>England;</HI> and that it would particularly serve for a Clue to the present Controversy. These were the Reasons which chiefly induc'd me to publish it. The Ori∣ginal is in <HI>Latin</HI> Hexameter Verse; but for several Political Reasons, which shall remain secret, as well as because it would be otherwise very unpo∣pular, I have been at the trouble of translating it, as well as I could with sufficient Expedition, into <HI>English.</HI> The Original is indeed admirably fine, and discovers through almost every Line of it the Marks of a more than ordinary Inspiration: But in the Translation, my main Design in it being to ex∣pose the Enemies of our happy Establishment in Church and State to the most vulgar Eye, I have had Regard rather to the Matter of it, than to those numerous, unusual Flights and Delicacies of Poetry, with which an Imagination, professedly Infallible, and therefore more than Humane, must naturally abound.</P>
<P>I know very well, that the Doctor will stifly de∣ny any such Correspondence, solemnly declare this Epistle to be maliciously forged against him,
<PB REF="4"/>
and endeavour to extricate Himself from the Con∣sequences of it, by amusing the World with <HI>an Account</HI> of his <HI>Loyalty,</HI> and Averseness to <HI>Popery,</HI> supported by <HI>ample Testimonies of Gentlemen, Clergy, and others;</HI> and perhaps even <HI>Bishops</HI> Themselves: But I do hereby before-hand advise him to get such <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> such <HI>Clergy,</HI> and such <HI>Bishops,</HI> in his behalf, as stand in the Eye of the World un∣suspected of any the like Practices and Designs with himself. The Fact is openly produced against him; and Facts are, he knows very well, <HI>stubborn, unmanageable Things.</HI> If what I have already said will not convince him, and the World, that this Piece is Genuine, what I have farther to propose, <HI>must.</HI> If then he be really curious to know whether Jus∣tice be done him in this Matter, and desires a ful∣ler Satisfaction in it, and if he will acquaint my Bookseller therewith, he shall meet me at any proper Place, which he shall appoint, and see the <HI>Latin</HI> Original in his Holiness's own Hand-writing: <HI>Provided</HI> (which I think very fair) he will bring along with him the genuine, original Copy of <HI>Mr. Pillonniere</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> which He publish'd in his <HI>Vindication.</HI></P>
<P>Having made this generous Proposal to remove all manner of Doubts, I will however for once sup∣pose
<PB REF="5"/>
it not to be (what I have proved it to be) genuine; I will suppose it forged purposely to re∣flect on the Doctor, and yet, I am persuaded, the impartial World would notwithstanding acquit me of the Scandal: For if the Doctor's own late Anti-christian Attempts utterly to ruin the good Name of two innocent Persons (a pious Bishop, and a learn∣ed and valuable Fugitive, from the Absurdities and Cruelties of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church) will not suf∣ficiently justify a Satyrical Chastisement; then Re∣bellion, and Atheism it self, Murder, Rapine, Drunkenness, Debauchery, and all the grossest Wickednesses in the World, ought for the same Reason to go unpunished and uncondemn'd. His insolent Behaviour towards the Bishop; and his unnatural, barbarous Treatment of a sincere Con∣vert to the Religion which he <HI>professes,</HI> who had given him no Provocation, is, I may safely say, unparallel'd as well as unjustifiable. His own heartiest Well-wishers, and the heartiest Well-wishers to that Cause which he has undertaken, must, whether they will or no, in this Case, una∣nimously abhor such Proceedings in their Hearts, tho' they care not openly to avow it, for fear of discountenancing the great <HI>Achilles</HI> of their Party, and lessening the Interest which he is so strenuously
<PB REF="6"/>
serving: For let the most partial, the most bigot∣ted and interested Man upon Earth look back, if he can, upon this long, continued Series of Ini∣quity, without at least a tacit, conscientious In∣dignation; Let him behold it first beginning in the Heat and Hurry of Passion, by a rash Assertion, which this Reverend Divine, embarass'd on all sides with Difficulties, made at random without any Proof, or any possible well-grounded Hopes of Proof, and against the Light and inward Con∣viction of his own Mind: Let him behold it carried on by the same wicked, unaccountable Me∣thods of Revenge, and blind Fury; and at last, when nothing else could be done, confirm'd by the Evidence of a <HI>profligate, perjur'd</HI> Wretch, confes∣sed so on both sides, an <HI>Ecclesiastical Knight of the Post,</HI> who was resolved to turn a Penny in this Af∣fair, and swear for him that Paid best. I say, the most prejudic'd of all Men, if he has yet any Re∣mains of Tenderness left, if he has but one poor Spark of Humanity unextinguish'd in his Breast, if he calls himself a Man or a Christian, will make the Case of this <HI>unhappy Stranger</HI> his own, and share in all the Bitterness and Severity of his Enemies. For my own Part, I do indeed think my self at Liberty to persist in the Defense of <HI>Innocence</HI> and
<PB REF="7"/>
<HI>Virtue,</HI> and to animadvert on the different Cha∣racters of <HI>Vice,</HI> in whatsoever <HI>sanctified Shapes</HI> it shall make its Appearance, and under whatsoever popular Disguises it shall insinuate itself into the Passions of the unthinking or designing Part of Mankind. I am resolved, upon all Occasions, as far as I am able, to detect and expose the scandalous Artifices of an enraged, disappointed and revenge∣ful <HI>Party:</HI> I am resolved to vindicate the Reputa∣tion of an innocent and eminently pious and learn∣ed Bishop from the Aspersions undeservedly thrown upon him by Persons who are under the greatest Obligations to him for his excellent (I may say) unanswerable Writings in Defense of <HI>Protestantism</HI> in general, and of the <HI>Church of England</HI> in par∣ticular; and who for that Reason ought, instead of the ungrateful Returns of Envy, Malice and Defamation, to join their Hands and their Hearts with him in the same Cause, against the Common Enemy. And this I shall do, notwithstanding all the hard Names and unjust Imputations which I must expect to meet with; notwithstanding all the Enemies I shall by this means rouze up against me, and (what with me weighs more than every thing else put together) notwithstanding it should prove disgustful to the very Man for whose Service it is
<PB REF="8"/>
intended: for that the Bishop is unwilling any of his Adversaries should experience any Severities upon his Account, he has often told us, and that he dis∣approves such Methods of Controversy equally on both sides: And this is the only thing in which I could prevail with myself to give him any Pain and Uneasiness. But shall a peaceable, good-natur'd Man be torn to Pieces, meerly because he is so? Shall the best inward Disposition, and the most candid outward Behaviour meet with nothing but Affronts and Insolences? And shall it become unjust to use Men in the same manner, that they use others? No, no: For tho' they have found it impossible to provoke his Lordship to any indecent Returns of ill Treatment, and therefore are continually railing and reviling without any Fears of the like Usage from him; they must however expect, that the Spectators of their Behaviour will rise up in De∣fense of Modesty, Virtue and Good-nature, and re∣buke the <HI>proud and haughty Scorner, who dealeth in proud Wrath.</HI> These sort of Men indeed have been so long used to receive Argument and Reason in return for <HI>Billingsgate</HI> and Impudence; Pity and Forgive∣ness, for Injuries and Abuses; Civility, for Reproach; and in short, the best Treatment for the worst; that they seem at length to esteem it a Privilege belonging
<PB REF="9"/>
peculiarly to themselves; and will in time, if not check'd in their Arrogance, plead for it by Pre∣scription and Charter.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with assuring the Doctor, that when he shall think fit to desist from his In∣sults on Innocence and Merit, I will desist from (what he may call, if he pleases) insulting him; and that I will still follow his Example, whether he be inclin'd to Peace or War. And this is what I thought proper to say as the Publisher of the fol∣lowing Poem; and so I take my leave.</P>

<HEAD>A CONGRATULATORY EPISTLE FROM His Holiness the POPE TO <HI>The Reverend Dr.</HI> SNAPE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O Thee, my SNAPE, in these <HI>Reform∣ing</HI> Times,</L>
<L>Grateful, we send our Blessing and our Rimes.</L>
<L>Odd it may seem for Us, the Guide of <HI>Kings,</HI></L>
<L>To sport and flutter on Poetic Wings;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="11"/>Odd it may seem for your unerring Sire</L>
<L>To rave, like <HI>School-boys,</HI> with Romantic Fire;</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>Conscience-liberty</HI> disturbs our Peace,</L>
<L>And stubborn, miter'd Heretics increase;</L>
<L>While the declining <HI>See</HI> expects her Doom,</L>
<L>And <HI>Europe</HI> plots the second Fall of <HI>Rome;</HI></L>
<L>Whilst o'er the World the impious Scheme prevails</L>
<L>Of <HI>English</HI> BANGOR, and of <HI>French</HI> NOAILLES.</L>
<L>Licentious Miscreants! with Gigantic Pride,</L>
<L>Our Apostolic Censures they deride;</L>
<L>We ply each Engine with successless Pain,</L>
<L>And with Damnation threaten 'em in vain:</L>
<L>Our <HI>Bulls</HI> the Hangman to the Flame commands,</L>
<L>Fated to perish by unhallow'd Hands;</L>
<L>The faithless <HI>Gaul</HI> augments our sacred Woes,</L>
<L>And <HI>Brunswick</HI> smiles, disdainful, on his Foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor yet, my Son, these ghostly Lays refuse,</L>
<L>The Labours of a Sacerdotal Muse;</L>
<L>Think not that Rimeing is beneath our Care,</L>
<L>Or that a Poet ill becomes the <HI>Chair:</HI></L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="12"/>My Soul to such an Extasy is wrought,</L>
<L>Verse can alone unload my swelling Thought;</L>
<L>Verse can alone with proper Force impart</L>
<L>The <HI>fervent Breathings</HI> of a grateful Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When first WE heard, confirm'd by ev'ry Mail,</L>
<L>What Labours you attempt, what Foes assail;</L>
<L>How, fir'd with vengeful Zeal, and pious Rage,</L>
<L>You durst with HOADLY in the Lists engage:</L>
<L>On ev'ry Brow a sudden Smile appear'd,</L>
<L>On ev'ry Tongue a sudden Joy was heard:</L>
<L>My self am ravish'd with the pleasing Tale,</L>
<L>And in my Breast reviving Hopes prevail.</L>
<L>Thro' <HI>Albion</HI>'s Isle, I seem once more to Reign,</L>
<L>And sanguine Triumphs beat in ev'ry Vein.</L>
<L>With silent Joy thy Labours I peruse,</L>
<L>And bless thro' every Page thy glorious Views:</L>
<L>I scan each Doctrine, sift each doubtful Line,</L>
<L>And prove THY <HI>darling Principles</HI> by MINE;</L>
<L>Thy <HI>stable Fundamentals</HI> are the <HI>same,</HI></L>
<L>And bear, like <HI>Sterling-Gold,</HI> the purging Flame:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="13"/>Unmix'd with gross, <HI>Heretical Allay,</HI></L>
<L>Thy Works the <HI>Dictates of the</HI> CHURCH display;</L>
<L>And, after the severest Test, are found</L>
<L><HI>Pure, Catholick,</HI> and <HI>Orthodoxly</HI> sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But most those learned Pages we admire,</L>
<L>(For so our Int'rest and our Cause inspire)</L>
<L>Where, with consummate, controversial Strength,</L>
<L>You treat of <HI>Church Authority</HI> at length.</L>
<L>In that <HI>main Point</HI> exactly WE agree,</L>
<L>And BELLARMINE himself might yield to THEE.</L>
<L>Well do'st thou plead for UNDISPUTED Pow'r;</L>
<L>The <HI>Church,</HI> if once that ceases, is no more:</L>
<L>POWER is the Cement of Religious Truth,</L>
<L>And from Division AWES the roving Youth:</L>
<L>POWER can old Modes restore, or new ones make,</L>
<L>And claim SUBMISSION for SUBMISSION'S sake;</L>
<L>POWER can alone uphold th' <HI>implicit Cause,</HI></L>
<L>And gain <HI>Belief</HI> to UNEXAMIN'D Laws;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="14"/>POWER can alone our UNITY increase,</L>
<L>And sooth the <HI>stubborn Schismatic</HI> to PEACE;</L>
<L>POWER can enforce that Faith, which first it made,</L>
<L>And Conscience from its strongest Bent dissuade.</L>
<L>(From wild to wild <HI>unguided</HI> Conscience strays,</L>
<L>And wanders on in her erroneous Maze.)</L>
<L>Your true, staunch Churchman disbelieves his Mind,</L>
<L>And trusts to the Decisions of Mankind;</L>
<L>He, blindly, Faith at <HI>second hand</HI> receives,</L>
<L>And not in JESUS, but the <HI>Priest</HI> believes.</L>
<L>He piques not of himself with haughty Pride,</L>
<L>Nor boasts the Dictates of an <HI>inward Guide;</HI></L>
<L>Nor in his Heart erects a <HI>Conscience-Throne,</HI></L>
<L>But models, by the <HI>Standard Faith,</HI> his <HI>own:</HI></L>
<L>Since <HI>Conscience</HI> is at best a doubtful Light;</L>
<L>But <HI>Priests</HI> are, by their Office, in the <HI>Right.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tho' the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s Arguments excel,</L>
<L>Since <HI>Railing</HI> and <HI>Reproach</HI> will do as well?</L>
<L>Thy <HI>Sacred Scandals,</HI> and <HI>Religious Lies</HI></L>
<L>Conceal the latent Truth from vulgar Eyes.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="15"/>Our common Cause on Artifice depends,</L>
<L>The gravest Villains are its surest Friends:</L>
<L>Whose venal Faith on worldly Sanctions moves,</L>
<L>And such my dearest SNAPE himself approves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With <HI>fervent Soul</HI> I bless'd the great Design,</L>
<L>When <HI>Defamation</HI> flow'd thro' ev'ry Line;</L>
<L>When you unravel'd, with no vulgar Art,</L>
<L>The mazy Folds and Doublings of the Heart;</L>
<L>The Prelate-Foe by <HI>Hear-say</HI> you abus'd,</L>
<L>And HOADLY stood of Perjury accus'd:</L>
<L>You broke into the Secrets of his Breast,</L>
<L>And to your Eyes his <HI>Meanings</HI> were confess'd;</L>
<L>You call'd him <HI>Atheist,</HI> unbelieving <HI>Sot,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Free-Thinker, Jesuit,</HI> and in short, what not?</L>
<L>Names ill conjoin'd! — but what can Priests con∣trive,</L>
<L>That an implicit Rabble won't believe?</L>
<L>They glean the straggling <HI>Rumours</HI> of the Town,</L>
<L>And swallow each luxurious <HI>Scandal</HI> down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
<L>Nor less I joy'd, when in the self-same Page,</L>
<L>Th' <HI>Apostate</HI> fell a Victim to thy Rage:</L>
<L>He, PILLONNIERE, who from our Altars fled,</L>
<L>(Damnation light upon his impious Head.)</L>
<L>You strive, indeed, to blacken him in vain;</L>
<L>His late Behaviour is alas! too plain:</L>
<L>A most outragious Heretick in Grain!—</L>
<L>Full well thou know'st it — come we Two are Friends;</L>
<L>To me thou mayst confess thy Covert Ends:</L>
<L>Because no Jesuit, therefore you defame;</L>
<L>And if it please the Party, 'tis the same.</L>
<L>Thy famous <HI>Letter to the</HI> COLLEGE feign'd</L>
<L>Of Wit and Gall no common Marks contain'd:</L>
<L>For in the shrewdest Ironies express'd,</L>
<L>The keenest Satire lurk'd in ev'ry Jest.</L>
<L>'Twas subtly finish'd, subtly 'twas design'd,</L>
<L>To wake the Passions, and inflame the Mind.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="17"/>No Ranks and Orders can escape thy Pen,</L>
<L>Ev'n BRUNSWICK fares with <HI>Thee</HI> like other Men.</L>
<L>With smart Lampoon you gall'd the <HI>Victor</HI>-KING;</L>
<L>My Heart exulted when I 'spy'd the Sting.</L>
<L>The <HI>Innuendo</HI> was exceeding smart,</L>
<L>And couch'd in poignant Words with wond'rous
Art.</L>
<L>Methinks I saw the old Usurper Rage,</L>
<L>And rend with conscious Wrath the biting Page:</L>
<L>The shocking Charge so artfully imply'd,</L>
<L>Tickled his rising Spleen, and check'd his Pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A certain learned Wight, not long ago</L>
<L>Our Correspondent was, nor Friend nor Foe:</L>
<L>He entertain'd Us with diverting Chat;</L>
<L>One <HI>Richard Steele</HI> — a smoaky Fellow that!</L>
<L>He told us frankly, in the <HI>Christian Creed,</HI></L>
<L>That <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>England</HI> were almost agreed.</L>
<L>Ah! little did I deem, what since I find,</L>
<L>Your Hearts so strongly to my Cause inclin'd:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="18"/>A thousand silly Scruples fill'd my Breast;</L>
<L>I thought the merry Knight dispos'd to Jest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor shalt <HI>Thou</HI> labour in our Cause in vain,</L>
<L>The <HI>Hat</HI> and <HI>Purple</HI> shall reward thy Pain:</L>
<L>Henceforth no more we wage religious Wars;</L>
<L>Henceforth our Quarrels cease, and mutual Jars.</L>
<L>My <HI>Snape</HI> the Charm of Heresy has broke,</L>
<L>And <HI>Albion</HI> scorns no more the <HI>Romish Yoke:</HI></L>
<L>My <HI>Snape</HI> has recogniz'd our sacred Reign;</L>
<L>And <HI>Reformation</HI> shall roll back again.</L>
<L>The <HI>Beadsman</HI> oft, with Rapture in his Face,</L>
<L>And Eyes up-lifted, blesses all thy Race:</L>
<L>And oft, as thoughtful o'er the Meads he strays,</L>
<L>Repeats in Transport thy establish'd Praise:</L>
<L>The publick Voice of <HI>Rome</HI> applauds thy Deeds,</L>
<L>And a full <HI>Conclave</HI> has receiv'd thy <HI>Creeds.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But oh! one fatal Ill remains behind;</L>
<L>One painful Doubt disturbs my Anxious Mind:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="19"/>Still, still, I fear, our tow'ring Hopes are crost,</L>
<L>And all this flatt'ring, gaudy Vision lost.</L>
<L>For oh! distracting Thought! our dreadful Foes,</L>
<L>BRUNSWICK and HOADLY Thy Designs oppose,</L>
<L>And propagate to late succeeding Time,</L>
<L>Contagious <HI>Heresy</HI> thro' ev'ry Clime.</L>
<L>Wherefore dispatch Them to the Shades below;</L>
<L>Shoot, stab, or poison; 'tis no Matter how.</L>
<L>In lavish Reams, no more your Pamphlets spread;</L>
<L>You'll never <HI>argue</HI> a Fanatic dead:</L>
<L>Fire, Sword and Faggot will alone convince,</L>
<L>And bring the stupid Heretic to Sense;</L>
<L>At once the Tyrant from his Throne displace,</L>
<L>And quite extirpate his usurping Race:</L>
<L>Nor think that Vengeance on such Crimes will fall,</L>
<L>A <HI>Dispensation</HI> shall reverse it all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Thee, and all his unsuccessful Friends,</L>
<L>Most grateful Thanks your hapless Monarch sends.</L>
<L>Beneath our Eye, so partial Heav'n ordains,</L>
<L>The pensive Youth with mimic Splendor reigns;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="20"/>From Land to Land the Royal <HI>Out-Law</HI> fled,</L>
<L>Nor had a Place to rest his weary Head;</L>
<L>'Till <HI>Rome</HI> at length, by strong Compassion sway'd,</L>
<L>With friendly Arm reach'd out the timely Aid.</L>
<L>His long disputed Titles he lays down,</L>
<L>And to his Rival quits the <HI>British</HI> Throne:</L>
<L>Forc'd to resign to BRUNSWICK'S pow'rful Might,</L>
<L>And boasts in vain his <HI>Patriarchal Right.</HI></L>
<L>Henceforth he studies to oblige the Fair,</L>
<L>And dedicates his Life to Love and Pray'r:</L>
<L>In Love and Pray'r, like Thee, all rapt in <HI>Flame,</HI></L>
<L>His Crucifix addresses, and his Dame.</L>
<L>You've heard how, with persuasive Pow'rs endu'd,</L>
<L>The exil'd <HI>Ormond</HI> for his Monarch su'd:</L>
<L>In vain he su'd; relentless to his Sighs,</L>
<L>The scornful PRINCESS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Of</HI> Courland.</NOTE> his Espousals flies;</L>

<L>Unhappy PRINCE! on Ills, new Ills arise,</L>
<L>Disastrous News! His Bigot-Mother dies:</L>

<L>She dies forgetful of Her JAMES'S Fate.</L>
<L>Her hoarded Wealth, alas! the fatal Day,</L>
<L>She from her darling JAMES bequeaths away;</L>
<L>A <HI>Stranger</HI> seizes on the lawless store,</L>

<L>How will the Tyrant triumph, when he hears,</L>

<LG>
<L>Of all the <HI>Stuart</HI>-Race but One is left,</L>

<L>Assert their Independent, Priestly Crown,</L>

<L>Nor tamely to a Civil Pow'r resign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To fiery <HI>Trap</HI> in strongest Ties I'm bound,</L>

<L><HI>Law,</HI> with unwearied, and unanswer'd Pains,</L>

<L>The long successive Priesthood he displays:</L>

<L>And each declares himself the Apostles Heir:</L>
<L>While Ignorance the Christian World defac'd,</L>

<P>SINCE the inserting of my Advertisement in the <HI>Evening-Post</HI> of <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 20th instant, my Bookseller has given me to understand from Mr. <HI>Sewell,</HI> that his <HI>sole</HI> Design in his Advertisement in the <HI>Post-Boy</HI> was to acquit Himself from the Charge of being the Author of my Poem, intituled, <HI>Protestant Popery,</HI> &amp;c. Mr. <HI>Sewell</HI> has likewise the Gentleman-like Ingenuity to assure him that the warm Expressions He has made use of against me were occasion'd by his delaying to put in an Advertisement which he left with him, dated <HI>May</HI> the 5th, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>This Justice to Himself being, as I think it, very reasonable, so I hope that I have given Him the fullest Satisfaction therein. And I do likewise think my self obliged to comply with the Request, which He now makes to me, in explaining an Expression in my Advertisement, where I say, that <Q>I doubt “not but the same <HI>ETONIAN</HI> Charge of Scurrility and Nonsense will be fix'd on this Poem as to my ”other:</Q> Which Expression, He informs Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> has by some Gentlemen been understood to carry an invidious Reflection on that excellent School in general: Wherefore I do hereby declare, that I meant only by <HI>it</HI> to allude to the ill-manner'd Conduct of Dr. <HI>Snape</HI> during this Controversy. This Declaration I the rather make, because I am sensible, that the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of BANGOR has, in that Place, very few Enemies (if any) besides the present, egregious <HI>Letter-wri∣ting</HI> Master; whose continued, unretracted Calum∣nies, and unprovok'd, insolent Abuses of that truly valuable Prelate, justly deserve the severest Management; and which He and his Gang must always, until They are brought to a due Sense of Shame, expect to meet with from</P>
