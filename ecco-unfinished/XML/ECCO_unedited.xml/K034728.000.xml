<L>HOW bold a Venture does our Author make!</L>
<L>And what strange Measures to his Wishes take?</L>
<L>How cou'd he hope the Tragick Scene shou'd please,</L>
<L>When Art's a Jest, and Sence a loath'd Disease?</L>
<L>What prospect of Advantage cou'd he find</L>
<L>In the just painted Passions of the Mind,</L>
<L>And the sublimer Draughts of Human Kind?</L>
<L>Who listens now to Nature's charming Voice,</L>
<L>When all are pleas'd with empty Show and Noise,</L>
<L>Loud tumid Bombast, or low Farce and Dance,</L>
<L>The far-fetch'd Trash of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France.</HI></L>
<L>What various Dishes for you have we drest,</L>
<L>And what strange Olio's have set out our Feast?</L>

<L>The Tragick Muse, the Glory of our Nation,</L>
<L>Is thrown Aside, Despis'd, like an old Fashion.</L>
<L>In vain with Toyl the artful Bards have strove</L>
<L>Your fickle Taste to please, and to improve.</L>
<L>All this our Author knew, yet still wou'd on,</L>
<L>And tempt the Dangers he was warn'd to shun.</L>
<L>No dire Prediction cou'd his Mind depress,</L>
<L>And sure his Cou age merits some Success.</L>
<L>Bravely resolv'd, he does his Sentence wait;</L>
<L>Nor dreads your Frowns, nor wou'd provoke your Hate;</L>
<L>But owns your Power, and hopes a prosperous Fate.</L>

<LG>
<L>YOu've seen the unhappy Monarch's wretched Fate,</L>
<L>Who to the best of Subjects prov'd ingrate:</L>
<L>No wonder he sat loose upon his Throne,</L>
<L>After such Treatment to its Supporter shown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How happy is our Isle, which can't complain</L>
<L>That her great Heroe has de serv'd in vain?</L>
<L>Gladly we've seen the Senate and the Crown,</L>
<L>Making their Gratitude, like his Renown,</L>
<L>For ever to succeeding Ages known.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You, fairest Charmers, to whose gentle sway</L>
<L>With pleasure we submit, and chuse t'obey;</L>
<L>Whom to offend base Cowards only dare,</L>
<L>And those, whom nothing else can frighten, fear.</L>
<L>He runs a double risque that injures you,</L>
<L>Breaking the Allegiance to your Beauties due,</L>
<L>And must expect our Sex his Enemies too.</L>
<L>We've seen the greatest Powers▪ prove no defence</L>
<L>To him that wrong'd your unarm'd Innocence.</L>
<L>The generous Warriors scorn to assert his Cause,</L>
<L>Who'as violated Honours sacred Laws.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>None are so brave as those whom you inspire</L>
<L>With Life and Vigour from Love's active Fire:</L>
<L>When you our willing Hands and Hearts Command,</L>
<L>Our daring Onsets nothing can withstand.</L>
<L>We fear no Darts but from your piercing Eyes,</L>
<L>And every Terror but your Frowns despise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus when in mighty <HI>ANNA's</HI> Cause we Fight,</L>
<L>Toils are our Pleasures, Dangers our ▪Delight.</L>
<L>Since to maintain her Rights we've us'd our Arms,</L>
<L>They've prov'd resistless as Her powerful Charms:</L>
<L>VVhose Influence has in one Campaign done more</L>
<L>Than we in Ages could perform before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still may your Smiles our Victories Reward,</L>
<L>Their happy Progress nothing shall retard.</L>
<L>All the united Powers of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>Our fearless Legions shall oppose in vain:</L>
<L>To Grace your glorious Triumphs both shall joyn,</L>
<L>And their lost Trophies at your Feet resign.</L>
