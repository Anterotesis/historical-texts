<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD DUBERLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT what does it matter, my Lady, whether I drink my tea out of a cup or a saucer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great deal, in the polite circles, my Lord. We have been raised by a strange freak of fortune, from nothing, as a body may say; and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing! As reputable a trade as any in all Gosport. You hold a merchant as cheap as if he trotted about with his property in a pack, like a pedlar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>A merchant, indeed! Curious merchandize you dealt in, truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>A large assortment of articles:—Coals, cloth, herrings, linens, candles, eggs, sugar, treacle, tea, bacon, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick dust; with many more, too tedious to mention in this here advertisement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, praise the bridge that carried you over; but, you must now drop the tradesman, and learn life. Consider, by the strangest accident, you have been raised to—neither more nor less than a peer of the realm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but I han't been a nobleman more nor a week; and my throat isn't noble enough yet to be proof against scalding. Hand over the milk, my Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hand over! oh, what's bred in the bone will never come out of the flesh, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! there's a fuss indeed! when I was plain Daniel Dowlass, of Gosport, I was reckoned as cute a dab in discourse as any in our town, nobody found fault with me; my thoughts were like a fat plough▪man's chub∣by children. If folks found them fresh and strong enough, no matter how they were clothed. But people, I take it, fancy a great Lord's thoughts, are like his ricketty brats—plaguy weak, and damned ordinary; and want a deal of dressing up to make 'em pass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why so loud?—I declare the servants will hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear! and what will they hear but what they know? our story a secret, Lord help you!—tell 'em Queen Anne's dead, my Lady. Don't every body know that old Lord Duberly was supposed to die without any heir to his estate—as the Doctors say, of an implication of disorders; and, that his son, Henry Moreland, was lost some time ago, in the salt sea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there's no occasion to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't every body know that Lawyer Ferret, of Fernival's Inn, owed the Legatees a grudge—and pop'd a bit of an advertisement into the News? "Whereas, if the Heir at Law, if there be any reviving, of the late Ba∣ron Duberly, will apply—so, and so; he'll hear of som'ut greatly to his advantage."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why, bawl it to the—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Didn't he hunt me out to secure my title? and lug me from the counter, to clap me into a coach? a house here, in Hanover-square, and an estate in the country, worth fifteen thousand per annum?—Why, bless you, my Lady, every little black devil, with a soot-bag, cries it about the streets, as often as he says sweep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a pity but my Lord had left you some manners, with his money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>He, what my cousin twenty thousand times removed, he must have left them by word of mouth.—Never spoke to him but once, in all my born life, upon electioneering matter—that's a time when most of your proud folks make no bones of tippling with a tallow-chan∣dler, in his back-room, on a melting day: but he!—ex∣cept calling me cousin, and buying a lot of damaged huck∣aback, to cut into kitchen towels, he was as old and stiff as he is now, tho' he has been dead and buried these nine months, rot him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, again, now!—Rot him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, blood and thunder! what is a man to say, when he wants to consecrate his old stiff-rumped relations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, an oath, now and then, may slip in to garnish genteel conversation: but then it should be done with an air to one's equals, and with a kind of careless condescension to menials.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Should it?—well then—here John—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Servant.</STAGE>
<P>my good man, take away the tea and be damn'd to you?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Lord.</P>
<STAGE>(Exit Servant.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, my lord, I must leave you for the concerns of the day, we elegant people are as full of busi∣ness as an egg's full of meat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we elegant people find the trade of the tone, as they call it, plaguy fataguing—What, are you for the <HI>wis-a-was</HI> this morning? much good may do you, my lady,—damn it, it makes me sit stuck up like a bear in a bathing tub.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a hundred places to call at—Folks are so civil since we came up to take possession—there's dear Lady Littlefigure, Lord Sponge, Mrs. Heldbank, Lady Betty Pillory, the Hon. Mrs. Cheatwell, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye; you may always find plenty, in this here town, to be civil to 15,000 a year, my Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there's no learning you life. I'm sure they are as kind and friendly—the supper Lady Betty gave to us and a hundred friends, must have cost her fifty good pounds, if it cost a brass farden; and she does the same thing, I'm told, three times a week. If she isn't monstrous rich, I wonder, for my part, how she can afford it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ecod, my lady, that would have puz∣zled me too, if they hadn't hooked me into a damn'd game of cocking and punting, I think they call it, where I lost as much in half-an-hour, as would keep her and her com∣pany in fricassee's and whipt sullibub's for a fortnight. But I may be even with her some other a'ternoons. Only let me catch her at put,—that's all.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> JOHN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doctor Pangloss, is below, my Lord.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush, consider.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum! I forgot—curse me, my honest fellow, shew him up stairs d'ye hear?—<STAGE>[exit John.]</STAGE>—There—was that easy?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now, get along, my lady. The doctor and I must be snug?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, I bid you a good morning, my Lord, as Lady Betty says, I wish you a <HI>bone repos.</HI></P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>A bone repose!</HI> I don't know how it is, but the woman are more cuter at these here matters, nor the men. My wife, as every body may see, is as genteel al∣ready, as if she'd been born a dutchess. This doctor Pangloss will do me a great deal of good, in the way of fashioning my discourse, so here he is,—</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> DOCTOR PANGLOSS.</STAGE>
<P>Doctor, good morning—I wish you a <HI>bone repos!</HI>—Take a chair, Doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, my Lord; I am not inclined to be sedentary, I would with permission, <HI>"erectos ad sidera toll<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re vultus."</HI>—Ovid.—Hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Tollery vultures!</HI> I suppose that means you rather stand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fye, this is a locomotive morning with me.—Just hurried, my Lord, from the Society of Arts; whence, I may say, <HI>"I have borne my blushing honours thick upon me."</HI>—Shakespeare.—Hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what has put your honor to the blush, this morning, doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the blush?—A ludicrous perversion of the author's meaning.—He, he, he!—Hem!—you shall hear, my Lord.—<HI>"Lend me your ears."</HI>—Shakespeare, again.—Hem!—'Tis not unknown to your Lordship, and the no less literary world, that the Caledonion University of Aberdeen, long since conferred upon me the dignity of L. L. D.—and as I never beheld that erudite body, I may safely say, they dubb'd me with a degree, from sheer consi∣deration of my celebrity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>For nothing, my Lord, but my own innate modesty, could suppose the Scotch College to be swayed by one pound, fifteen shillings, and three pence, three far∣things, paid on receiving my <HI>diploma,</HI> as a handsome compli∣ment to the numerous and learned heads of that Seminary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, damn it, no; it wasn't for the matter of money</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think it was altogether the <HI>"auri sacra fames."</HI>—Virgil—Hem!—But this very day, my Lord, at eleven o'clock, A. M. the Society of Arts, in consequence, as they were pleased to say, of my merits,—he, he, he!—have admitted me an unworthy member; and
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
I have, henceforward, the privilege of adding to my name the enviable title of A. double S.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I make no doubt, doctor, but you have rightly deserved it. I warrant a man don't get A. double S. tacked to his name for nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Decidedly not, my Lord.—Yes, I am now <HI>Artium Societatis Socius.</HI>—My two last publications did that business.—<HI>"Exêgi monumentum aere perennius."</HI>—Horace.—Hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what might these two books be about, Doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first, my Lord, was a plan to lull the restless to sleep by an infusion of opium into their ears:—the efficacy of this method originally struck me in St. Ste∣phen's chapel, while listening to the oratory of a worthy country gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder it wasn't hit upon before, by the Doctors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Physicians, my Lord, put their patients to sleep in another manner. He, he, he!—<HI>"To die—to sleep—no more"</HI>—Shakespeare.—Hem!—My second treatise was a proposal for erecting Dove-houses, on a principle, tending to create the propagation of pigeons. This, I may affirm, has received considerable countenance from many who move in the circles of fashion.—<HI>"Nec gemëre cessabit turtur."</HI>—Virgil.—Hem!—I am about to publish a third edition by subscription. May I have the honour to pop your Lordship down among the pigeons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye; down with me, Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I am grateful. I ever insert names and titles at full length. What may be your Lord∣ship's sponsorial and patronymick appellations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>My what?</P>

<P>The process which we are now upon, is to eradicate that blemish in your Lordship's language which

</SP>

<P>I'am afraid, Doctor, my <HI>Cakelology</HI> will give you a tolerable tight job of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>"Nil desperandum."</HI> Virgil.—Hem! We'll begin in the old way, my Lord. Talk on;—when you stumble, I check. Where was your Lordship yesterday evening?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>At a <HI>Consort.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>tète á tête,</HI> with five hundred people, hearing music.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I conceive.—Your Lordship would say, a Concert.—Mark the distinction.—A Concert, my Lord, is an entertainment visited by fashionable lovers of harmo∣ny. Now a Consort is a Wife; little conducive to harmo∣ny, in the present day, and seldom visited by a Man of Fashion, unless she happens to be his friends or his neigh∣bours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>A devil of a difference, indeed! Between you and I, Doctor—now my Lady's out of hearing, a wife is the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>He, he, he!—There are plenty of Jobs in the world, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a damned sight of Jezabels, too, Doctor. But patience, as you say—for I never give my Lady no bad language. Whenever she gets in her tantrums, and talks high, I always sit mum-chance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>"So spake our mother, Eve, and Adam heard."</HI> Milton.—Hem!—Silence is most secure, my Lord, in these cases; for if once your Lordship opened your mouth, 'tis twenty to one, but bad language would follow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that's a sure thing; and I never like to disperse the woman.</P>

<P>Humph! There's another stumble!—After all, Doctor, I shall make but a poor progress in my <HI>ver∣micular</HI> tongue.</P>

<P>Your knowledge of our native, or <HI>vernacu∣lar</HI> language, my Lord, time and industry may meliora<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. Vermicular is an epithet seldom applied to tongues, except in the case of puppies who want to be wormed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod, then, I'ant so much out, Doctor; I've met plenty of puppies, since I came to town—whose tongues are so very troublesome, that worming might chance to be of service.—But, Dr. I've a bit of a proposal to make to you, concerning of my own family.</P>

<P>Why, you must know, I expect my son, Dicky, in town this here very morning. Now, Doctor, if you would mend his <HI>cakelology,</HI> mayhap it might be bet∣ter worth than the mending of mine.</P>

<P>I smell a pupil. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> Whence, my Lord, does the young gentleman come?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>A tradesman, you know, must mind the main chance, so when Dick-began to grow as big as a porpus, I got an old friend of mine, who lives in Derbyshire, close to the Devil's—hum! close to the peak, to take Dick 'pren∣tice, at half price.—He's just now out of his time, and I warrant him, as wild and rough as a rock; now, if you doctor—if you would but take him in hand, and soften him a bit—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, my Lord—<HI>"To soften rocks!"</HI> Congreve.—Hem!—Pray, my Lord, what profession may the Honourable Mr. Dowlas have followed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, Dick? He served his clerkship to an attorney, at Castleton,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>An Attorney!—Gentlemen of his profes∣sion, my Lord, are very difficult to soften.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but the pay may make it worth the while; I'm told that Lord Spindle gives his eldest son's, master Drumstick's tutorer, three hundred a year; and besides learning his pupil, he has to read my lord to sleep of an afternoon, and walk out with the lap-dogs and chil∣dren. Now, if three hundred a year, doctor, will do the business for Dick, I shan't begrudge it you.</P>

<P>Och, now, if I had but minded to tell him, that—but I made the half-crown tell it him, as plain as it could speak—for I threw it upon the old miser's table, with a great big whack; and by my soul, he never jumped so high at two and six-pence, before, in all his beggarly born days.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Um! there is one reason, indeed, that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>You alarm me!—What can that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they have never received them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more likely; consider, your last let∣ter from Quebec, told your father, Lord Duberly, that you had avenged all the business which had call'd you there, and that in three days you should embark for England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that he never answered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't tell—probably not. Most people think it somewhat superfluous to write to a correspondent at Quebec, after he has left the place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! I'm bewildered.—But since—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why since, the chances have been against you.—Wreck'd on our passage—thrown upon the uninha∣bited part of the island of Cape Breton—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall never think of it without horror, nor without gratitude, Stedfast. To your friendly care, stran∣gers as we then were to each other, in that frozen shore of desolation, I owe my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw!—nonsense—We both met as fellow∣passengers, and were fellow-sufferers; I happened to be the toughest, that's all.—I do as we would be done by, is merely a part of our duty!—But, there's so much fuss about it, now, that, I'm afraid the duty is too often ne∣glected.—I suppose we shall soon thank our shoe-black for brushing our boots, though we reward him for the business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet humanity, Stedfast—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is every man's business, and the reward he will ultimately receive for it as far above human calcula∣tion. But come, thank providence, and not me.—To furvive at the end of two months, when most of the small parcel of our comrades were dead, or dying about us, with cold and hunger, is no common escape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then in a desperate hope to launch our shat∣tered boat in quest of an inhabited country, and to be tossed about for two months more, 'till benumbed and pe∣rishing, we were discovered by the natives and friendly Indians.—All this, Stedfast, was indeed a stout trial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then away with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rifling fears, now, since our deliverance, we have changed our ground, daily, on our
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
turn to England, the time—the distance—your letters—theirs—all may have miscarried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it prove so. But let me hasten to my fa∣ther's and clear my doubts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, stay, stay. You know 'twas at my request you drove to this hotel; now pray, at my request let me wait on Lord Duberly, to prepare him for your ap∣pearance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very evident one. The wreck of our ship, has doubtless, long been public in London. And as the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew and passengers are probably all supposed to have pe∣rished, your abrupt entrance at your father's, might be too much for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are perfectly right. In the moment when our passions are afloat, how beneficial is the cool advice of a friend to direct us. But shouldn't I give you a line of introduction to my father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Umph! why according to usual form, indeed—but I was never good at forms; and, in this case, it may be better to let me introduce myself in my own way. I hope Lord Duberly is no stickler for ceremonies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has the manliest virtue and the warmest heart in the world, my friend, but I confess to those who are unacquainted with them, these qualities are a little con∣cealed by a coldness in his manner that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I understand.—A little stately or so.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only a little of the <HI>veille coeur</HI> about him. A long habit too, of haranguing in Parliament, gives a man a kind of dignity of deportment, and an elevation of style not to be met with every day you know. But Gentle∣man is written legibly upon his brow; erudition shines thro' every polished period of his language; and he is the best of men, and of fathers, believe me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye. I see—I see.—Grand and stiff, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of sterling value, like an old fashion'd silver candle∣stick.—Well, I'll soon bring you an account of my em∣bassy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>And while you are at my father's, I'll walk to Mrs. Dormer's; my suspense about Caroline is intolerable. I must see the good old gentleman, and he will break my arrival to his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meet me, then, here, in a couple of hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it so, a thousand thanks my dear Stedfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>A thousand fiddlestick! I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to be thank'd a thousand times for a trifle.—I know 'tis the language of the day; but modern complimentary cant is the coin∣age of dishonesty, for the profession exceeds the feeling;

<P>Apt—very apt, indeed, for his age.—Defec∣tive in nothing, now, but words, phrases and grammar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you could learn him to follow my ex∣ample, and be a little genteel:—but there's no making a silk purse out of a sow's ear, they say.</P>

<P>Time may do much. But, as to my Lord, every body has'nt your Ladyship's exquisite elegance.—"Upon my soul a lie." Shakespeare—Hem!</P>

<P>A mighty pretty spoken man!—and you are made tutorer, I'm told, Doctor, to my Dicky?</P>

<P>That honour has accrued to your obsequious servant, Peter Pangloss: I have now the felicity of super∣intending your Ladyship's Dicky.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mustn't have my son thwarted, Doctor—for when he has his way in every thing, he's the sweetest tempered youth in Christendom.</P>
</SP>

<P>An extraordinary instance of mildness!</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, as mild as mother's milk, I assure you.—And what is he to learn, doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our readings will be various—Logic, Ethics, and Mathematics; History, Foreign and Domestic; Geo∣graphy, Ancient and Modern; Voyages and Travels, An∣tiquities, British and Foreign, Natural History, Natural and moral philosophy, Classics, Arts, and Sciences, Belles Lettres, and Miscellanies.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>This is a damned barbarous old woman! With submission to your Ladyship, my business is with the the head, not with the heels, of my pupil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Fiddle faddle! Lady Betty tells me, that the heads of young men of fashion, now a-days, are by no means overloaded. They are left to the Barber and Dentist.</P>

<P>'Twould be daring to dispute so self-evident an axiom—But if your Ladyship—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the fashion father—that's modern ease young Oats, the beau brewer, from the boro', brought it down, last Christmas, to Castleton. A young fellow is nothing now without the Bond-street roll, a tooth-pick be∣tween his teeth, and his knuckles crammed into his coat-pockets—then away you go, lounging lazily along—Oh, Tom—what Will! Rolling away, you see—How are you, Jack?—What, my little Dolly!—That's the way—Isn't it, mother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it? Grace must have got plaguy limber, then, and lopt of late.—There's the last lord Duberly's father done in our dining room, with a wig as wide as a wash-tub, and stuck up as stiff as a poker. He was one of your tip-tops, too, in his time, they tell me:—he car∣ried a gold stick before George the first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and looks for all the world as straight as if he swallowed it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter for that, my lady;—what signi∣fies dignity without it's <HI>crakeristick</HI>—a man should know how to bemean himself, when he is as rich as Pluto.</P>

From exalted rank like yours, my Lord, men lock for exalted virtue; and when these are coupled, they command respect, and grace each other:—but the coronet, which gives and receives splendour, when fixed on the brow of merit, glitters on the worthless head, like a mark of disgrace, to render vice, folly, and inhumanity conspicuous. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Isn't the fashion to pay a visit at this time of the evening—who let you in?</P>

<P>Why a fat man in the hall, that pop't out of a leather chair, that comes all over his head like a tub.</P>
</SP>

<P>The porter, I suppose.</P>

<P>But why did you come now:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I do tell you, I was uneasy about ye, Dick, I couldn't ha' staid away, if I was to be hanged for't.—You did promise to meet us, this afternoon.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been prevented; we young fellows of fashion can't answer for our hours.</P>
</SP>

<P>Ah, Dick, London fashions and friendship, I do fear, go seldom cheek by jowl. I ha' just left Cecily at the place.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>All along o' you man. You did promise to come, and she do tell me, she never know'd you to break your word till you were made a gentleman. I said all I could to comfort her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what did you say, Zekiel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I told her, that you had always dealt fair and open with her, 'till now—and if you could be honest to her when you were a lawyer, there might be some hope of your being so now, even though you be an ho∣nourable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; I shall see her to-morrow, and see you too, Zekiel; and settle some plan for her; and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plan?—why the plan be settled already—and, you do know, she be in place, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw!—in place will never do; I have a liking for her, you know; and when—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>A liking!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; that's a love, you know; and a regard for you, Zekiel—and, in short, a girl on whom Lord Duberly's son has fixed his affections, must not remain in service; it would disgrace one of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>It can't disgrace one of us, Dick.—A good girl who have lost her parents support, and do get her bread in honest industry, be a pride instead of a disgrace, to any one that loves her, you do know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I didn't mean that; I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Noa—noa—bless you, 'tware only your good heart run away wi' you. You do wish us well, Dick—you do wish to serve us; and overshot yourself a little, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what you said, that be all.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look ye, Zekiel; you are a well-mean∣ing lad—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and so be you, Dick; I ware getting a bit tiffish wi' you at the Blue-boar. I did think sudden pride ware going to turn you topsy-turvey—I was angry at myself, afterwards.—But I do beg your pardon—heartily, my good friend—faith heartily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay; hear me: 'tis fit we should understand one another—which we don't seem to do—at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't us! Ecod I should be grieved at that, Dick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Listen to me. My situation, you see, is much altered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Woundedly indeed!—Here be a house—and what a brave coat you ha' gotten on, Dick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter; but there are situations in the world, Zekiel, that do not always tally: chance may re∣move one man so far from another, in the rank of life; that,
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
tho' their good-will may continue, the same custom requires, that they should not live exactly—mind, I say, not <HI>exactly,</HI> on the same footing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see what you be driving at, Dick; I see it; I did fear it, all along. Well, well, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—I do know that I be'nt fit company for a Lord's son;—but when a Lord was once a Chandler, I thought indeed—no matter—bless thee, Dick.—I shall always wish thee well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay; I dont mean that we should separ∣ate; on the contrary, I wish we may be closer in friend∣ship than ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Dick! I ha' loved thee!—I'd ha' parted wi' my last farthing to—no matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no occasion to take it in this manner; we may be both rich, both happy, Zekiel: But, you know, how impossible it is for the son of a Peer to marry your sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, aye, I do see it—it be all over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No reason for that on earth; for though the world places a distance between Cis and me, as to matri∣mony; yet it makes an allowance for every thing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't understand you, Dick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>My rank not permitting the usual forms be∣tween us, which my regard for her happiness makes me wish, could take place; all I can now do is to raise her from future fear of poverty; and we may be man and wife in every thing but the ceremony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, now I do understand ye.—You be a rascal!—Odds flesh! I shall choak!—a damed rascal—keep out o' my way or I may do ye a mischief.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but—</P>

<P>I begin to feel that it does, Zekiel.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>And well you may. If it be the part of a Lord's son to stab his friend to the heart, by robbing his sister of her honesty, much good may do ye, wi' your grandeur.—But let me tell your grandeur this, Mr. Dow∣las; you do know some'at (little enow to be sure) of the laa; and the laa of the land do make no difference between a Peer and a Ploughman—if you do dare to hurt Cecily, the laa shall lay you flat, in the first place, and my plough∣man's fist, in the second!—and so my service to you. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be more yourself, Henry. Firmness in the moment of disappointment—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Disappointment!—'tis torture—it racks me—Caroline fled, none knows whither—unprotected! Per∣haps exposed to want too! to biting penury! The ac∣count, though confused, which I gathered last night from the unfeeling wretch in possession of the late Mr. Dor∣mer's house—why not have gone to my father's—Caroline might there have relied on an assylum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Umph! perhaps not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Stedfast! how little you know of my wor∣thy father's heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I've had a specimen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did you prevent me from going to him last night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>After the ill news you had just received, at the late Mr. Dormer's, your mind was too much agitated for such an encounter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; you see I followed your commands. You▪ rule me like a child, Stedfast; I went to bed, but not to rest—why should'nt you then, explain every thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were unfit-to hear any thing. You were almost distracted. 'Twas sufficient that I sent word to Lord Duberly, that you would pay your duty to him, to∣day, after breakfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you saw my father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he received you with that complacency so friendly a messenger deserved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to say the truth, I found none of that stately dignity about him, which you led me to expect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>To you, of course, when you explained the pur∣port of your visit, he would throw that aside. The ten∣derness
<PB N="42" REF="42"/>
of the father softened the austerity of habit, and his language came warm from the heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul, 'twould puzzle me to tell where it came from: but to do him justice (notwithstand∣ing his harrangues in the House of Peers, which you talk'd of) his language was as little Parliamentary as any lan∣guage I ever heard in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, your's was no meeting of formality.—Bu∣siness like your's called for no pomp of words on either side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Words!—no—so his Lordship seemed to think, when he told me they buttered no parsnips.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father! You jest, sure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I do not—and I'm afraid my dear young friend, your ardent feelings have painted the pa∣rental affection of Lord Duberly, in warmer colours than it merits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Heaven! what do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be plain, he received the account of his lost son's arrival with more than coldness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you mistook my dear father's manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing could be less equivocal—He treated me with—but that does'nt signify—When I intro∣duced myself by informing him, that I came from Que∣bec—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; that must have excited his attention. He made a thousand enquiries?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith. Only one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw!—trivial—merely ribaldry.—Damn it, I'm ashamed for his sake, and your's to mention it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay; I entreat you tell me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he asked if—pshaw!—if I was a yan∣kee doodle, if you must have it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>You astonish me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not more than I was astonished. In short, instead of finding the fond, anxious, agitated, father, I met a man reckless of his child's fate, and treating the man who brought him the news of a son's preservation with levity and insult.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! 'Tis not his nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, even with buffoonery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take care, Stedfast—you may have miscon∣ceived; But I must not have my father's character made an ill-timed sport.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, 'tis sportive enough in itself, for that matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sportive!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, beyond comprehension. He deals in witchcraft, it seems;—for he was even jocular enough to tell me that he had a familiar in the shape of a Blue-boar, who had given him intelligence of your arrival. I confess, I was shocked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I am Stedfast, shocked at your attempt in a moment like this, to trifle with the feelings of a friend, and endeavour to fully a venerable character, too well established to be tainted by the breath of misrepresenta∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Zounds! I tell you that Lord Du∣berly—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Duberly, Sir, is as incapable of the con∣duct and language you have described, as I am incapable of hearing it without resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Resentment! you are warm, Mr. Moreland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have reason, Sir. Look at the man—Look at Lord Duberly—his very countenance contradicts the assertion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I dont know. I believed, since you said it, that gentleman was once written legibly on his brow—but damme, if time has'nt scratched out the writing, as thoroughly as ever writing was scratched out in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>This conduct of yours shall not go unpunished, Mr. Stedfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unpunished, young man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, by Heaven! Such a gross aspersion of my good and worthy father, shall be answered with the life of that man—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who lately saved your's Henry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Stedfast, I—I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young man, 'tis well for us, that winter's enough have passed over my head, to make my blood flow in a temperate current.—Did it run riot like your's, we might now be cutting one another's throats.—Would it please you, think you, to have done me that office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Please me! It makes me shudder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet this, now, is what the world calls satis∣faction. I trust, I am as little daunted with big words, and a stern look, as most men. But the truest courage, Henry, is founded on reason:—and were the head oftner permitted to check the passions of the heart, there would be less fatal encounters, on foolish causes, and the peace of many a parent, wife and child might remain unbroken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Stedfast! The man that reasons thus would surely never mean to sport with my anxieties.—There
<PB N="44" REF="44"/>
must be some mistake; pray pardon me, and accompany me to my father's. Assist me in unravelling this mystery which confounds me. Can you forgive my heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the very bottom of my heart, Henry:—for, however rash in itself, the impulse was filial piety; and that with me will amply excuse it. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>A gig? Umpe! that's an Eaton phrase—the Westminster call it Quiz.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look'ye, doctor,—I've done an injury to two worthy souls; and I can't rest till I've made re∣paration. We are all of us wrong, at times, doctor, but a man doubles his ill-conduct, when he is too proud to make an apology for it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>However changed, they shall not now alter my purpose, Cecily, I have been dazzled, and I have wounded you, I have covered myself too, with shame and confu∣sion; but if they can make atonement, my fortune, my heart, and my hand, are all at your service.</P>

<P>My dear, dear Cecily, I rose strangely to rank; and I shall, now, perhaps, in the eyes of the great world, strangely support it; for, I am afraid Cis, that half your young fellows of fashion, would rather seem wicked than ridiculous; but I shall never, for the future, think that marrying a worthy woman, whom chance has placed be∣neath us in life, can be any disgrace, while seducing her is reckoned among profligate fops, a matter of triumph.—Dry, dry your tears, Cecily.</P>

<P>TO be sure misfortune isn't a neat touchstone to try friendship upon. Faith, now, all my loving friends de∣serve a decent kicking; and, by my soul, I believe they expected it from my hands; for I no sonner said the word "lend"—but they all turned their backs to me. How my poor ould bones ache—and sure the biggest bone about me is in my heart, for that aches more than all the other half of my body. Och, my poor Miss Caroline<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what will I do, now your aground, to keep your pretty little chin above water! If we could have kept the brave

Mr. Henry Moreland's chin above water, now; but he's gone—he's gone; and twenty humane societies could'nt bring him back.—I'll make bold just to rest me a bit at this door. Don't be frightened, good gentleman within, for I an't coming to borrow any money from you. <STAGE>[Sits down at door.]</STAGE> Faith, this step is like my dear friends hearts; for, by St. Patrick. it's as could and hard as a hailstone.</P>

<P>I can't see their faces, now, but sure these two must be a rich man that won't lend, and a borrower; for one is trotting about in great distress, and t'other as cool as a cucumber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Henry; the encounter was a strange one, 'tis true; and the shock sudden. When you entered a father's house, and prepared to leap into a fa∣ther's arms, to meet that low wretch, who has caused all our mistakes, was indeed—</P>

<P>Oh, it distracts me! so many things are floating in my disordered mind; I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>But 'tis necessary you shou'd be collected, now, absolutely necessary. You must do speedy justice to your∣self▪ to the memory of your departed father. How came you not to discover yourself to that lump of ignorance, who has jump'd into your inheritance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was staggered; I heard enough from him to unravel all; and 'tis well perhaps, we withdrew so abruptly, I might have done something rash at the moment. Oh, Stedfast, I shall sink under it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfast.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, Henry! fye on this weakness! Sink under it! Decent sorrow for a near loss is amiable; and modest nature never looks more lovely, than when the filial tear steals gently on the tomb of a parent: but des∣perate grief outrages manhood and religion; for in the trials, which we all are born to undergo, Henry, the man and the christian forgets his duties to providence, and to himself, when he loses his resignation and his fortitude.</P>

<P>Then I must'nt listen to you, My Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Um—why I've been almost scared out of my seven senses, for certain. The old man that was here last night, rushed in with another young one with him, this morning. I can't make head nor tail of what he wants for my part. But, as to Dick, he'll certainly break his heart, if he does'nt marry this here wench.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder, my Lord, you can think of such a thing—A Peer's son to marry a maid-servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Od rabbit it, my lady, now don't be obstra∣pulous. You know when his father married you, you was but a clear-starcher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's quite another sort of an affair; and you might have more manners than to mention it now; but as to learning you elegance—ah! we may take the horse to the water, but there's no making him drink.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I'm sure I did'nt mean any disparage∣ment to you—for you was counted, on all hands, the best getter-up of small linen, in our town. Here's the doctor, let's ax his advice in this here business.—</P>

<P>Well, she is but a farmer's daughter, they say, and what's a farmer, my dear?</P>

<P>I have little reason to be so, Cecily.</P>

<P>Oh, I hope you have! and if the worst comes to the worst—but I'm almost asham'd to tell you, madam.</P>

<P>Innocence, like yours, my good girl, can know nothing it should fear to reveal.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Cecily?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecily H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he looked so sorry that it made my heart bleed to see him—and when I love him so dearly, it would

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>May you be very, very happy!—'tis an ease to my mind, in the midst of my misfortunes, to know that you will be provided for. I was on the point of tel∣ling you, Cecily, that my reduced circumstances would not permit me to keep you with me any longer.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kenrick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be satisfied ma'am, for he's too much bother'd to talk. But you see he's here, and that's enough—the true, long lost, Mr. Henry Moreland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh? what? Henry Moreland! Why, zounds! the late Lord Duberly's lost heir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Son and heir to that revered and respected man, be assured Sir. You have done me the favour to be my <HI>tocum tenens</HI> in my absence, and I am now return'd to re∣lieve you from further trouble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what the devil! have I only been a kind of peer's warming-pan after all—just pop'd in to keep his place from getting cold, 'till he jump'd into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more, believe me. I have witnesses sufficient, should it be necessary to identify my person in a minute.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is this, my Caroline?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>An honest creature, Henry.—Brother to this simple girl.—Their affection to me in my distress, has been most piercing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it shall not go unrewarded, my Caroline.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wi' humble submission, Sir, kindness to a fellow creature in distress do reward itself.—Thanks to the Lottery, we be rich, enow.—But as Dick Dowlas be to marry Cecily, if you would just lend me a helping hand, for his father and mother here.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh rest contented, honest friend, I shall not dis∣possess them without making a proper provision.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord.—Hem!—<STAGE>(To Henry.)</STAGE>—if a boy should bless your nuptials, which is now shortly to take place, he will certainly require a tutor.—Three hundred per annum are the terms of your Lordship's obsequious servant, Peter Pangloss, E. E. D. and A, double S.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="58" REF="58"/>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not one of those, Sir, it seems who lose an appointment for want of an early application for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>The human mind, my lord, naturally looks forward,—<HI>"anum us pactviuet fultura,"</HI> Cicero—Hem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I should need such a person, Sir, depend upon it, I should be very particular in my choice—for I suspect there are some amongst those to whom youth is entrusted who bring the character of a tutor into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isrepute—and draw ridicule upon a respectable situation, in which many men of learning and probity are placed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>This will never do for me. Again must I retire to Milk-alley, and spin my brain for subsistence. <HI>"Panglos's occupations gone!"</HI>—Shakespeare—Hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>In calmer moments, my Caroline, I will explain the circumstances of my preservation, and when I have paid the mournful tribute due to a much lamented father, let me call you mine, and place you above the reach of fu∣ture sorrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>Little sorrow can reach me, when you are safe, Henry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zekiel H.</SPEAKER>
<P>And we'll get into the country—Take a bit of a farm—and all be as merry as grigs, Dick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed, Zekiel, come Cecily, I have seen enough already of splendour, to seek for happiness in qui∣eter scenes, and I have learn't, Zekiel, that, in spite of all the allurements which riches or titles may boast—the most solid and valuable possession, is, a true friend.—</P>
