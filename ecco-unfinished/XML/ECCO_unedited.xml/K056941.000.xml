<HEAD>A HYMN TO PEACE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HAIL Image, of th' Eternal Mind,</L>
<L>The only perfect Blessing of Mankind;</L>
<L>Thou Emblem of the Sacred Rest,</L>
<L>And surest Pledge, it shall be once possess'd;</L>
<L>Where e're thou dwellest, 'tis always Calm and Clear,</L>
<L>Bright like they Glorious self and Fair:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Clouds thy Heavenly Climates know,</L>
<L>Thou find'st it all Serene, or make'st it so:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
If Nations thou, or Souls hast once possess'd,</L>
<L>From all their Broils and Burthens they'r releass'd,</L>
<L>All Humane Happiness attends on thee,</L>
<L>In Gaol thou sets the Pris'ner Free,</L>
<L>If thou Unlock'st the Fetters of the Mind,</L>
<L>In spight of Bars and Bolts 'tis unconfin'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell us, bright Nymph, by what strange Art,</L>
<L>Thou fan'st the heated Souls of Men Oppress'd;</L>
<L>Cool'st all the Fury of the Heart,</L>
<L>And guid'st the Mind to Light and Rest?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell us, Great Interposing Something, how,</L>
<L>To thy Great Influence, all the Passions bow;</L>
<L>How thou deny'st the Gust of sweet Revenge,</L>
<L>Can'st all to Calms and Softness change?</L>
<L>In the least Moment act thy part,</L>
<L>And lock up all the <HI>Lab'rinths</HI> of the Heart?</L>
<L>Fill'd with just Rage, the Furious Sp'rits take Arms,</L>
<L>When Injury and Power to hurt Combine,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
What Mind can once resist th' Unhappy Charms,</L>
<L>Where wish'd Revenge, with wish'd Occasion join.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the Exasperated Passions rage,</L>
<L>And all the Man against himself Engage;</L>
<L>The Mighty Tempests rise within,</L>
<L>And strong Convulsions, act the swelling Spleen.</L>
<L>When Fury leads him to the Fatal Brink,</L>
<L>Thou turn'st him round but once, and mak'st him think;</L>
<L>The Ungovern'd Wretch in Arms appears,</L>
<L>Against his Eyes, against his Ears;</L>
<L>Judges of nothing, Scorns his Sence,</L>
<L>Lampoons his Nature, Bullies Providence;</L>
<L>Headlong he seeks to give his Fury vent,</L>
<L>Bursting with Rage, and swell'd with Discontent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then thy soft showers distill upon the Soul,</L>
<L>And all the Frenzy of the Mind controul;</L>
<L>Reduce the Wretch, by Rage and Passions blind,</L>
<L>To Exercise the Opticks of his Mind;</L>

Thy Balmy Dews, the Raging Storms restrain,</L>
<L>And Cool the Fermentations of his Brain;</L>
<L>Assisting Reason in her just Defence,</L>
<L>And Hand in Hand, Conduct him to his Sense;</L>
<L>Disperses all the Vapours that remain,</L>
<L>Brings him to act, and so restores the Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Touch'd with thy Scepters Golden point,</L>
<L>The Hypochondraick Poisons lose their Taint;</L>
<L>Th' Infecting Venome of inflam'd desire,</L>
<L>Flows back, and of it self puts out the Fire:</L>
<L>The Soul returns to Rectitude, and shows,</L>
<L>That Heaven within, from whence that Influence flows.</L>
<L>Blest Peace! May every Soul that knows thy Name,</L>
<L>Fan thy just Fires and keep alive the Flame;</L>
<L>So their due Homage, to thy Blessing pay,</L>
<L>So banish Storms, and banish Crimes away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, Virgin Peace, thou Branch of Innocence,</L>
<L>How art thou sunk in early Crimes of Men,</L>

How hard to be restor'd again,</L>
<L>And only art obtain'd in Penitence.</L>

<LG>
<L>Thou bright <HI>Effluvium,</HI> of the Heavenly Ray,</L>
<L>Great Emanation, from Eternal Day;</L>
<L>The Guilty only from thee run,</L>
<L>Like Storms and Darkness from the Sun;</L>
<L>Darkness and Storms, with Guilty pace,</L>
<L>Flee from the Glorious Lustre of thy Face,</L>
<L>And Hell it self's Enrag'd to know,</L>
<L>Thy Absence helps to make her so.</L>

<L>When Men by Pride, and wild Ambition led,</L>
<L><HI>For wild Ambition, oft distracts the Head;</HI></L>

<L>How soon does War, its vile Effects Explain,</L>
<L>And his own Miseries inform the Man;</L>
<L>Damn'd to Repentance, and his Fate</L>
<L>Show's him his Follies, but too late.</L>
<L>With Crowds of consequential Harms Oppress'd,</L>
<L>He Learns the Sweetness of unvalu'd Rest,</L>
<L>But Learns it at a price so Dear,</L>
<L>As makes his Early Follies soon appear:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Both sides well Beaten, call for Peace,</L>
<L>And find too late their Happiness.</L>
<L>Their Mutual Mischiefs, Mutual Wits restore,</L>
<L>And show them both, that both were Fools before;</L>
<L>Then, <HI>Goddess,</HI> to thy Courts they sue,</L>
<L>With Penitence, most likely to be true,</L>
<L>For none Repent, like those that feel,</L>

Kingdoms in Tumults, and Confusions Dye,</L>
<L>And sink in <HI>Ʋndirected Anarchy.</HI></L>
<L>Societies with Justice cease,</L>
<L>For what's our Property, without our Peace?</L>
<L>Contentions all Prosperity invade,</L>
<L>Like two fixt Stocks, to one <HI>East-India</HI> Trade;</L>
<L>Both Languish, while they strive and Fight,</L>
<L>And both Succeed, when they Unite.</L>
</LG>

<L>Not Heaven it self, could Strife of Parties bear,</L>
<L>The first Attempt Un-Angel'd <HI>Lucifer;</HI></L>
<L>The Mighty Seraph from his Glory fell,</L>

<L>That was the Fire and Brimstone of the Place,</L>

Heaven is the Emanation of his Face,</L>

<L>Tell us, ye Men of Notion, tell us why,</L>
<L>You seek for Bliss and wild Prosperity,</L>
<L>In Storms and Tempests, Feuds and War,</L>

<L>Afflictions lose their Acid Powers,</L>

<L>The Darkest Article of Life with Peace,</L>

<L>Death in its blackest shapes can never fright;</L>
<L>Thou can'st see Day, beyond his Night;</L>

<L>Nay, Hell it self, could it admit of Peace,</L>
<L>Would change its Nature, and its Name would cease.</L>
<L>The Bright Transforming Blessing would Destroy</L>
<L>The Life of Death, and Damn the Place to Joy;</L>
<L>The <HI>Metamorphosis,</HI> would be so strange,</L>
<L>Twould fright the Devils, and make them bless the Change</L>

<L>They'd shun the Light, and flye from thence.</L>

<L>Let Heaven, that Unknown Happiness,</L>

<L>No Storms without, or Storms within;</L>
<L>No Fear, no Danger there, because no Sin:</L>

<L>Because He dwells within, whose Name is PEACE.</L>
