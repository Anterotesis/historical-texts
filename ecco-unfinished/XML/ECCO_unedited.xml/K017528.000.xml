<P>NEW BROOMS! AN OCCASIONAL PRELUDE, AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN <HI>CROW-STREET.</HI> BY GEORGE COLMAN.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little Piece was written at the request of Mr. SHERIDAN, who thought that whatever was said of the late Manager, or of his Successors, would come with a better grace from a third person than from the parties concerned. I am happy to have had it in my power to oblige him; and heartily wish that the candour and indulgence, which the Public have shewn to these Scenes, may prove a Prelude to the success of his su∣perior abilities to entertain them. His laurels being yet green from the fame of the DUEN∣NA, revived in my mind the idea of two cha∣racters, Crotchet and Sir Dulcimer Dunder, which it is well known that I had in contem∣plation about twelve years ago, and which were then intended to serve as an introduction to a Comick Opera. The thought proposed for the subject matter of the <HI>Prologue,</HI> was kindly worked up by a friend, who desired to remain concealed, but whose stile and manner are too familiar to the Stage, not to betray him to the Publick, who will doubtless be pleased to see him disposed, even in his retirement, to contribute to their amusements.</P>

<P>To be sure I don't know bitter, honey!

<P>And why not, sir?—Operas are the only real entertainment. The plain unornamented Drama is too flat, sir. Common dialogue is a dry imitation of Nature, as insipid as real conversation; but in an Opera, the dialogue is refreshed by an Air every instant.—Two gentlemen meet in the Park, for example, admire the place and the weather; and, after a speech or two, the orchestra take their cue, the musick strikes up, one of the characters takes a genteel turn or two on the stage, during the symphony, and then breaks out—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Crotchet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We know that you are a writer of Comedy yourself, Sprightly—Success attend you! —but believe me, Sprightly, Dramatick Pieces, unadorned by dance and scenery, and unenlivened by musick, will never be able to make a stand against Opera and Pantomime. All men have eyes and ears; but all men have not the like un∣derstandings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sprightly.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Englishmen, Mr. Crotchet, English∣men consider their eyes and ears as the inlets of in∣struction, as well as entertainment. The stage is the region of enchantment, I grant you. Shew and sing song may be admitted as garnish—the mere lace and fringe of the theatre—but the main body of the stage entertainments should be wrought out of the loom of Shakespeare and his noble assistants. The old Drama, Opera, and Pantomime, may indeed dance the hayes on the stage, like the sun, moon, and earth in the rehearsal—sometimes one in eclipse, and sometimes another. Opera or Pantomime may for a season cause a temporary obscurity, as the dull earth may now and then stand in its own light; but Tragedy and Comedy, like the Sun and Moon, will continue to be the life, delight, and chief support of the English Theatre.</P>
