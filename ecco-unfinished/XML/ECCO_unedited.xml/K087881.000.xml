<HEAD>PREFATORY DEDICATION.
TO
LORD HAWKE,
BARON TOWTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN an aera when ambition—dissipation—and
hypocritic gentleness of man∣ners
are professedly the pursuits of the
most distinguished characters;—when
the external graces are more coveted,
and more assiduously cultivated than the
virtues of the heart:—In an aera, my
Lord, when many authors, and some
the most eminent, labour to promote
the first—encrease the second—heighten
the polish of the third—and prostitute
their pens, as if determined, to extinguish
the last, by every art of false reasoning,
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
by every invention of imagination; it
may appear singular, that this little vo∣lume,
directly militating against these
accomplishments of the great world,
and attempting to supply their places
by qualities built on the more solid
basis of religion and morality, should
ask for patronage from one whom
fate has ordained to move in that
elevated sphere; but, my Lord, even
in courts the most notorious for the
profligacy of manners, virtue has ever
found some votaries.</P>
<P>The corruptions of vice become con∣sequential
in proportion as they be∣come
fashionable;—and folly assumes
the air of ornamental grace, and diffuses
itself almost universally, only when che∣rished
and supported by those whom the
little world look up to in the superior
walks of life, and consider as exam∣ples
of imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
From hence we find the advocates
for error perpetually multiplying, and
the clear fountain of true happiness ex∣changed
for the turbid stream of unpro∣fitable
pleasure.—For it is certain, real
felicity cannot be obtained but by a
firm adherence to virtue, and a deter∣mined
conformity to its dictates.—The
glare of vice may, for a while, dazzle
the sight; but it cheers not the soul, or
makes glad the heart from the purity of
its lustre: like an <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> it leads
us into perplexities—doubts—and mis∣fortune,
and there leaves us to struggle
with the calamities it has enticed us to pursue.</P>
<P>The intent, therefore, of the follow∣ing
sheets, is to give a relish for the religi∣ous
and moral duties; that the veil un∣der
which vice approaches the young
and inexperienced may be thrown aside;
and its allurements, too often fatally suc∣cessful,
be exposed and evidently dis∣covered
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
as the harpies of mischief, and
the harbingers of destruction.</P>
<P>The intent is by gentle means to lead
the negligent and incautious into the
path of rectitude,—implant in their bo∣soms
a love of truth,—and from the
richness of the manure and fertility of
the soil make the young plant shoot up
with vigour, and bring forth the plea∣sant
fruit of goodness in abundance and
perfection.</P>
<P>The intent is, I will not say to make
every man the builder of his own for∣tune,
but I will say more, the establisher
of his own peace;—a blessing infinitely
more valuable than fame—riches—or
power.—For if he inculcates the maxims
herein contained, he will pass through
the bustle of the busy world, though
surrounded with the snares of villainy,
and machinations of treachery, in safety
and without reproach:—and when he
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
retires into the sequestered and solitary
scene, he will provide for himself a rich
repast, where reflection will feed on the
consolitary comfort of self-approbation,
and his hours pass away in the sweetness
of content.—He will view the misfor∣tunes
of mankind with an eye of pity,
and afford them relief:—He will behold
the pleasures of his neighbours with a
smile of sympathy, and enjoy them as
his own:—he will pay every tribute
due to his Creator, with gratitude and
joy, and will hold converse with the God
of his worship from the incorruptibility
of his heart, and the purity of his actions.</P>
<P>From your Lordship's well-known
love of the social virtues,—from that phi∣lanthropy
with which your bosom is re∣plete,—from
the rising progeny of lit∣tle
innocents with which Heaven has
blessed you, it cannot be doubted but
every effort intended to produce these
effects will meet with your countenance
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>
and protection.—On these considera∣tions,
therefore, I have ventured to de∣dicate
this selection to your Lordship,
flattering myself the liberty will not be
offensive, as the motive originated from
an honest and laudable zeal, and the de∣sire
of shewing the gratitude and defe∣rence
with which I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
Your Lordship's most devoted,
most obedient,
and very humble Servant,
THE EDITOR.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>SENTIMENTAL BEAUTIES
AND
MORAL DELINEATIONS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>ACUTENESS IN REPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS has ever been allowed a happiness
peculiar to the female sex, particularly on
subjects wherein they are in some degree con∣versant;
for their imaginations generally keep
pace with the narration, that they anticipate its
end, and are ready to deliver their sentiments on
it as soon as it is finished, while some of the
male hearers, whose minds were buried in set∣tling
the propriety, comparing the circumstances,
and examining the consistencies of what was said,
are obliged to pause and discriminate before they
think of answering.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="16"/>
Indeed a man of reflection, if he does not
keep an intimate commerce with the world, will
be sometimes so entangled in the intricacies of
intense thought, that he will have the appear∣ance
of a confused and perplexed expression,
while a sprightly woman will extricate herself
with that lively and <HI>rash dexterity</HI> which will al∣most
always please, though it is very far from being always right.</P>
<P>It is easier to confound than convince an op∣ponent;
the former may be effected by a turn
that has more happiness than truth in it, but a
young lady's vanity should not be too much ela∣ted
with this false applause, which is given, not
to her merit, but her sex: she has not per∣haps
gained a victory, though she may be al∣lowed
a triumph; and it should humble her to
reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her
strength, but her weakenss. It is worth while
to discriminate between the applause, which is
given from the complaisance of others, and that
which is paid to our own merit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="3" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>AFFABILITY.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to render ourselves amiable in so∣ciety,
we should correct every appearance
of harshness in our behaviour. That courtesy
should distinguish our demeanour, which springs,
not so much from studied politeness, as from a
mild and gentle heart. We should follow the
customs of the world in matters indifferent; but
stop when they become sinful. Our manners
ought to be simple and natural, and of course
they will be engaging. Affectation is certain
deformity—By forming themselves on fantastic
models, and vying with one another in every
reigning folly, the young begin with being ri∣diculous,
and end in being vicious and immo∣ral.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>ANXIETY, THE VICE OF AGE.</HEAD>
<P>IGNORANCE of what is good or evil should cor∣rect
Anxiety about worldly success. As rash∣ness
is the vice of youth, the opposite extremes
of immoderate care is the vice of advancing
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
years, but since attention is so often frustrated,
is should never be allowed to deprive us of tran∣quillity;
that degree of uncertainty therefore
ought to render us temperate in pursuit, calm
the perturbation of hope and fear, and cure the
pain of anxiety.</P>
<P>Anxiety is the poison of human life. It is the
parent of many sins, and of more miseries. In a
world where every thing is so doubtful;—where
we may succeed in our wish, and be miserable,
—where we may be disappointed, and be bless'd
in the disappointment; what means a restless
stir and commotion of the mind? Solicitude
cannot alter the course, or unravel the intricacy
of human events:—Curiosity cannot pierce thro'
the cloud which the Supreme Being hath made
impenetrable to the human eye—Wisdom com∣mands
man to retire after he has done all that
was incumbent on him, and to possess his mind
in peace. By going beyond this point, by giving
himself up to immoderate concern about un∣known
events, he can do nothing to advance
his success, and does much to ruin his Peace;
—he plants within his breast the thorn which is
long to gall him—To the vanity of life he adds
<PB N="5" REF="19"/>
vexation of spirit, which is wholly of his own
creation, not of diving appointment.</P>
<P>For the dubious goods of this world were
never designed by God to raise such eager at∣tachment.
They were given to man for his oc∣casional
refreshment, not for his chief felicity:
be setting an excessive value upon objects which
were intended only for his secondary regard, he
changes their nature. Seeking more satisfaction
from them than they are able to afford, he re∣ceives
less than they might give; from a mis∣taken
care to secure his happiness, he brings
upon himself certain misery.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>INDISCRIMINATE APPLAUSE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the fault of many that they do not always
carefully distinguish between running into the
error of detraction, and its opposite extreme of
undeserved praise—This proceeds from the false
idea they entertain, that the direct contrary to
what is wrong, must be right. Thus the dread
of only being suspected of one fault, makes them
actually guilty of another.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="20"/>
The desire of avoiding the imputation of envy,
impels them to be insincere; and to establish a
reputation for sweetness of temper and genero∣sity,
they affect to speak sometimes of very in∣different
characters with the most extravagant
applause. But this habit of exaggeration greatly
weakens their credit, and destroys the weight
of their opinion on other occasions; for people
very soon discover what degree of faith is to be
given both to their judgment and their veracity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>METHOD IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF
IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>IN delivering our sentiments on particular sub∣jects,
there is nothing which is attended
with better effect, and makes us appear to
more advantage than offering our opinions with
clearness and precision; and this only can be
done by arranging them in proper order, so that
they may appear regularly to arise one from
the other: this is stiled method, and prevents
confusion; hinders us from indulging in the
luxuriance of fancy, running into desultory di∣gressions,
and makes us appear superior to our
subject.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="21"/>
Where great sprightliness is the natural bent
of the temper, girls should endeavour to habi∣tuate
themselves to a custom of observing,
thinking, and reasoning. It is not necessary
that they should devote themselves to abstruse
speculation, or the study of logic; but she who
is accustomed to give a due arrangement to her
thoughts, to reason justly and pertinently on
common affairs, and judicioussly to deduce effects
from their causes, will be a better logician than
some of those who claim the name, because
they have studied the art. That species of
knowledge, which appears to be the result of
reflection rather than of science, sits peculiarly
well on women.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon to find a lady, who,
though she does not know a rule of syntax,
scarcely ever violate one; and who constructs
every sentence she utters with more propriety
than many a learned dunce, who has every rule
of Aristotle by heart, and who can lace his own
thread-bare discourse with golden shreds of
Cicero and Virgil.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
<HEAD>AVARICE.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the vices of old age, which appears
the most unaccountable, is that covetous
attachment to worldly interest with which it is
often charged. But this too can naturally be
deduced from the sense of its feebleness and
decay.</P>
<P>In proportion as the vigour both of body and
mind declines, timidity may be expected to
encrease. With anxious and fearful eye, the
aged look forward to the evils which threaten
them, and to the changes which may befal.
Hence, are they apt to overvalue riches, as the
instruments of their defence against these dangers,
and as the most certain means of securing them
against solitude and disrespect.</P>
<P>But though this cautious frugality may be justi∣fied;
sordid avarice can by no means be excused.
They should be charitable and do good. They
should mix beneficence to their friends, with a
cheerful enjoyment of the comforts which befit
<PB N="9" REF="23"/>
their state. They will then receive the returns
of real respect and love. Otherways, by their
riches, they procure no more than pretended
demonstrations of regard; while their ill-judged
parsimony occasions many secret wishes for their
death.</P>
<P>Chilled by the hand of time the heart loses
that tender sensibility, with which it once en∣tered
into the concerns and sorrows of others.
However, as in every period of life, humanity
and friendship contribute to happiness, it is both
our duty and interest to cherish the remains of
the kind affections, not suffer them to be blunted
or destroyed by sordid avarice. We should not,
from having suffered much in the course of our
long pilgrimage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> become callous to the suffer∣ings
of others. But, remembering we still are
men, study to keep our heart open to the sense
of human woe.</P>
<P>Practised in the ways of men, we are apt to
be suspicious of design and fraud; for the know∣ledge
and distrust of mankind too often go toge∣ther.
We should not however suffer that wary
caution, which is the fruit of experience, to
<PB N="10" REF="24"/>
dwindle into craft; for amidst the falsehoods of
men, integrity is the best defence, he who con∣tinueth
to the end to walk uprightly, shall con∣tinue
to walk surely.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>AWE.</HEAD>
<P>AWE is the first sentiment which arises in the
soul at the view of greatness. But in
the heart of a devout man, it is a solemn and
elevating, not a dejected emotion; for he glows,
rather than trembles, in the divine presence.
It is not the superstitious dread of unknown
power, but the homage yielded by the heart to
him, who is at once the greatest and best of
beings.</P>
<P>Omnipotence, viewed alone, would be a for∣midable
object. But, considered in conjunction
with the moral perfections of the divine nature,
it serves to heighten devotion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="11" REF="25"/>
<HEAD>BEHAVIOUR.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the chief beauties in a female cha∣racter
is that modest reserve, that re∣tiring
delicacy which avoids the public eye, and
is disconcerted even at the gaze of admiration.
For when a girl ceases to blush, she has lost the
most powerful charm of beauty. That extreme
sensibility, which it indicates, is pecularly en∣gaging.</P>
<P>Silence in company, particularly a large one,
is never mistaken by the judicious and discerning
for dulness, but bespeaks a modesty essential in
the female sex. Dignity of behaviour is neces∣sary
at public places, but care must be taken
not to mistake that for that confident ease, that
unabashed countenance which seems to set the
company at defiance.</P>
<P>Women should be cautious even in displaying
their good sense. It is often thought assuming
a superiority over the rest of the company; but
their learning should be kept a profound secret,
<PB N="12" REF="26"/>
especially from men, who generally look with
a jealous and malign eye on a woman of great
parts, and a cultivated understanding.</P>
<P>The great art of pleasing in conversation con∣sists
in making the company pleased with them∣selves.
Detraction should be avoided, especially
amongst women where their own sex is con∣cerned;
it would be more noble for them to
shew a compassionate sympathy to the unfortu∣nate,
especially to those who are rendered so
by the villainy of men. It is a laudable pride, as
well as secret pleasure, which ought to be in∣dulged
in being the friend and refuge of the un∣happy,
but without the vanity of shewing it.</P>
<P>Every species of indelicacy in conversation
should be considered as shameful and highly dis∣gusting.
A sacred regard should ever be had to
truth, for lying is a mean and despicable vice;
though a lively embellishment of a humourous
story, which is only intended to promote inno∣cent
mirth, cannot be understood to fall under
that head.</P>
<P>Gentleness of sprit and manners is extremely
engaging; but not that indiscriminate attention,
<PB N="13" REF="27"/>
that unmeaning simper, which smiles on all alike.
For this airses either, from affectation of softenss,
or from perfect insipidity.</P>
<P>A fine woman, like other fine things in nature,
has her proper point of view, from which she
may be seen to most advantage. To fix this
point requires great judgment, and an intimate
knowledge of the human heart. By the present
mode of female manners, the ladies seem to ex∣pect
that they shall regain their ascendency over
men, by the fullest display of their personal charms,
by being always in their eyes at public places, by
conversing with them with the same unreserved
freedom as they do with one another; in short, by
resembling men as near as they can. The folly of
this expectation and conduct will soon be shown.
For the power of a fine woman over the hearts
of men, of men of the finest parts, is even be∣yond
what she conceives. They are sensible of
the pleasing illusion, but they cannot, nor do
they wish, to desolve it. But if she id determined

girl.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="28"/>
There is a native dignity in ingenious mo∣desty
to be expected in the gentler sex, which
is their natural protection from the familiarity
of men. The sentiment that a woman may al∣low
all innocent freedoms, provided her virtue
is secure, is both grosly indelicate and dange∣rous,
and has proved fatal to many who have
confided too much in this fallacious doctrine.</P>
<P>In fine, to form a complete lady she should
possess the most perfect simplicity of heart and
manners; dignity without pride, affability with∣out
meaness, and simple elegance without affec∣tation.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>MAN OF BUSINESS.</HEAD>
<P>AN uninterrupted intercourse with the world,
oppresses the man of business and ambition.
The strongest spirit must at length fail and sink
under it. The happiest temper must be soured by
incessant returns of the opposition, the incon∣stancy
and treachery of men. For he who lives
always in the bustle of the world, lives in a
perpetual warfare: here, an enemy encounters;
<PB N="15" REF="29"/>
there, a rival supplants him. The ingratiude
of a friend stings him this hour, and the pride
of a superior, wounds him the next. In vain he
flies for relief to trifling amusements. These
may afford a temporary opiate to cure; but
they communicate no strength to the mind.
On the contrary, they leave it more soft and de∣fenceless,
when molestations and injuries renew
the attack.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MIXED COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind of each sex has some natural kind
of bias, which constitutes a distinction of
character, and the happiness of both depends,
in a great measure, on the preservation and ob∣servance
of this distinction. For where would
be the superior pleasure and satisfaction result∣ing
from mixed conversation, if this difference
was abolished?</P>
<P>If the qualities of both were invariably and
exactly the same, no benefit or entertainment
would arise from the tedious and insipid unifor∣mity
of such an intercourse; whereas consider∣able
are the advantages reaped from a select so∣ciety
of both sexes.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="30"/>
The rough angles and asperities of male man∣ners
are imperceptibly filed and gradually worn
smooth, by the polishing of female conversation,
and the refining of female taste: while the ideas
of women acquire strength and solidity by their
associating with sensible, intelligent, and judi∣cious
men.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>COMPASSION.</HEAD>
<P>COMPASSION is an emotion of which we
ought never to be ashamed. Graceful, parti∣cularly
in youth, is the fear of sympathy, and the
heart that melts at the tale of woe. We should
not permit ease and indulgence to contract our
affections, and wrap us up in selfish enjoyment.
But we should accustom ourselves to think of the
distresses of human life, of the solitary cottage,
the dying parent, and the weeping orphan.
Nor ought we ever to sport which pain and dis∣tress
in any of our amusements; nor treat even
the meanest insect with wanton cruelty.</P>
<P>It has been objected, and it is to be feared
with some reason, that female conversation is
too frequently tinctured with a censorious spirit,
<PB N="17" REF="31"/>
and that ladies are seldom apt to discover much
tenderness for the errors of a fallen sister. No
arguments can justify, no pleas extenuate it.</P>
<P>To insult over the miseries of an unhappy
creature is inhuman, not to compassionate them is
unchristian. The worthy part of the sex always
epress themselves humanely on the failings of
others, in proportion to their own undeviating
goodness, and by that gentle virtue are prompted
to alleviate the distresses of the unfortunate and
wretched; it prevents us from retaliating injuries;
and restrains our severe judgments and angry
passions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>CONFIDANTS.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST women these appear to be neces∣sary
associates without whom few pass
through life. If, therefore, they must have a
friend of this sort to pour out their heart to,
they should be sure of their honour and secrecy.
She should not be a married woman, especially
if she lives happily with her husband.</P>
<P>There are certain unguarded moments, in
which such a woman, though the best and
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>
worthiest of her sex, may let hints escape, which,
at other times, or to any other person than her
husband, she would be incapable of; nor will a
husband in this case feel himself under the same
obligation of secrecy and honour, as if confi∣dence
had originally been put in himself, espe∣cially
on subjects which the world is apt to treat
lightly.</P>
<P>Making confidants of servants should be care∣fully
avoided. Dignity, not properly under∣stood,
very readily degenerates into pride, which
enters into no friendships, because it cannot bear
an equal, and is so fond of flattery as to grasp at
it even from servants and dependents.</P>
<P>The most intimate confidants, therefore, of
proud people, are valets-de-chambres, and wait∣ing
women. The utmost humanity should be
shewn to servants; their situation made to them
as comfortable as possible; but if made confi∣dants,
we spoil them and debase ourselves.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="19" REF="33"/>
<HEAD>CONSCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the gay and active periods of life,
sinners elude, in some measure, it force.
Carried round in the whirl of affairs and pleasures;
intent on contrivance, eager in pursuit, amused
by hope, or elated by enjoyment, they are shel∣tered
by that croud of trifles which surrounds
them from serious thought. But conscience is
too great a power to remain always suppressed.</P>
<P>In the dark and solitary hour of distress, the
recollection of the past becomes dreadful. It ex∣hibits
a life thrown away in vanities and follies,
or consumed in flagitiousness and sin: crimes
rise in their native deformity. How miserable the
state of that man condemned to endure at once
the pangs of guilt, and the vexations of cala∣mity!</P>
<P>But a clear conscience enjoys, in the worst
conjunction of human life, a peace, a dignity,
an elevation of mind peculiar to virtue, not a
presumptuous boast of innocence. The better a
<PB N="20" REF="34"/>
man is, he will be more humble and sensible in
his failings. Of his piety and virtue, he reaps
the fruits in the season of adversity: the im∣provement
he makes; the temperate spirit with
which he enjoys those advantages; the bene∣ficent
actions which he performed, and the good
example which he set to others, remain behind.</P>
<P>By the memory of these, he enjoys his pro∣sperity
a second time in reflection. His mind
has no load: futurity no terrors. For reflection
cheers the lonely house of poverty, and attends
the conscientious sufferer into prison and exile.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>CONSTANCY AND FIRMNESS OF ACTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE great motives which produce these, must
be of a palpable and striking kind. A
divine legislator uttering his voice from hea∣ven;
—an omniscient witness beholding us in all
our retreats;—an Almighty governor stretching
forth his arm to punish or reward, disclosing
the secrets of the invisible world, informing us
of perpetual rest prepared hereafter for the righ∣teous,
<PB N="21" REF="35"/>
and of indignation and wrath awaiting
the wicked.</P>
<P>These considerations overawe the world, sup∣port
integrity, and check guilt; they add to
virtue that solemnity which should ever charac∣terise
it.—to the admonitions of conscience they
give the authority of law.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>CONTENT.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the whole progress of the human
course and events, the principal materials of
our comforts, or uneasiness, lie withing ourselves.
Every age will prove burdensome to those
who have no fund of happiness in their own
breasts. Could they be preserved from all infir∣mities
of frame; could they have bestowed upon
them, if it were possible, perpetual youth; still
they would be restless and miserable, through the
influence of ill-governed passions—It is not sur∣prizing
that such people are peevish, and queru∣lous
when old. Unjustly they impute to their
time of life, that misery with which their vices
and follies embitter every age.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="36"/>
Whereas, to good men, no period of life is
insupportable, because they draw their chief
happiness from sources which are independent of
age or time; Wisdom, Piety, and Virtue grow
not old with our bodies; they suffer no decay
from length of days; to them belongs only un∣alterable
and unfading youth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN conversing with a fellow-creature on earth,
it is not with his body we converse, though
it is his body only which we see. From his
words and actions we conceive his mind; with
his mind, though invisible, we hold correspond∣ence,
and direct towards this spiritual essence
our affection and regard.</P>
<P>It has been laid down as a rule, that in con∣versation,
women should carefully conceal any
knowledge or learning they happen to possess;
but there seems neither to be necessity or pro∣priety
in this advice: let discretion and modesty,
without which all knowledge is little worth, go∣vern
a lady's understanding, she will never make
<PB N="23" REF="37"/>
an ostentatious parade of it, because she will ra∣ther
be intent on acquiring more, than on dis∣playing
what she has.</P>
<P>For why should she exhibit her skill in music,
dancing, singing, taste in dress, those orna∣mental
graces, and her acquaintance with the most
fashionable arts and amusements; while her piety
is to be anxiously concealed, and her knowledge
<HI>affectedly</HI> disavowed, lest the former should draw
on her the appellation of an enthusiast, or the
latter that of a pedant.</P>
<P>It would, without doubt, be, to the last de∣gree,
presumptuous and absurd for a young wo∣man
to pretend to give the <HI>Ton</HI> to the com∣pany;
to interrupt the pleasure of others, and
her own opportunity of improvement, by <HI>talk∣ing</HI>
when she ought to listen;—or to introduce
subjects out of the common road, in order to
shew her own wit, or expose the want of it in
others; but were the sex to be totally silent
when any topic of literature happens to be dis∣cussed
in their presence, conversation would lose
much of its vivacity, and society would be rob∣bed
of one of its most interesting charms.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="24" REF="38"/>
<HEAD>ARTIFICIAL COURTESY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is that studied smoothness of manners,
which is learned in the school of the world.
Such accomplishments, the most frivolous may
possess. Too often they are employed by the
artful, as a snare; too often affected by the
hard and unfeeling, as a cover to the baseness
of their minds.</P>
<P>The imitation of virtue has been reduced into
art, and, in the commerce of life, the first study
of all who would either gain the esteem, or win
the hearts of others, is to learn the speech, and
to adopt the manners of candour, gentleness,
and humanity; but nothing except what flows
from the heart, can render even external man∣ners
truly and permanently pleasing; for no as∣sumed
behaviour can at all times hide the real
character.</P>
<P>A low voice and a soft address are the com∣mon
indications of a well bred woman, and
should seem to be the natural effect of a meek,
<PB N="25" REF="39"/>
and quiet spirit, but they are only the outward
and visible signs of it; for they are no more
meekness itself, that a red coat is courage, or a
black one devotion. To regulate the features,
while the soul is in tumult, or to command the
voice while the passions are without restraint,
is as idle as throwing odours into a steam when
the source is polluted.</P>
<P>It is not difficult to distinguish the true from the
artificial meekness. The former is universal and
habitual; the latter, local and temporary; and this
we may be assured of, that it we are not as gentle
to our servants, as to our visitors, the spirit of
gentleness is not in us.</P>
<P>Must we not be shocked and disappointed
when we behold a well-bred young lady soft and
engaging as the doves of Venus, displaying a
thousand graces and attractions to win the
hearts of a large company, and the instant they
are gone, to see her look mad as the Pythian
maid, and all the frightened graces driven from
her furious countenance, only because her gown
was brought home a quarter of an hour later
than she expected, or her ribband sent half a
shade lighter or darker than she ordered.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="40"/>
Amongst women of breeding, the exterior of
gentleness is so uniformly assumed, and the whole
manner is so perfectly level and <HI>uni,</HI> that it is next
to impossible for a stranger to know any thing
of their true dispositions by conversing
with them; and even the very features are so exactly
regulated, that physionomy, which may some∣times
be trusted among the vulgar, is with the
polite, a most lying science. That gentleness is
ever liable to be suspected for the counterfeited,
which is so excessive as to deprive people of the
proper use of speech and motion, or which, as
Hamlet says, “makes them lisp and amble, and
nick-name God's creaturs.”</P>
<P>Among the various artifices of factitious meek∣ness,
one of the most frequent and the most plau∣sible,
is that of affecting to be always equally de∣lighted
with all persons and characters. The so∣ciety
of these languid beings is without confidence,
their friendship without attachment, and their love
without affection, or even preference. This
insipid mode of conduct may be safe, but is en∣dowed
with neither taste, sense, or principle.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="27" REF="41"/>
<HEAD>COQUETRY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no character more truly disgusting
then that of a coquette; it originates from
folly, is supported by vanity, and terminates in
contempt. It is the certain mark of a narrow
mind, the illiberal slave of fulsome adulation, and
has all its enjoyments encreased by self-adoration.</P>
<P>Yet there is a case where a woman may
coquet justifiably to the utmost verge which her
conscience will allow. It is where a gentleman
purposes and declines to make his addresses, till
such time as he thinks himself perfectly sure of
her consent. This at bottom is intended to force
a woman to give up the undoubted privilege of
her sex, the privilege of refusing; it is intended
to force her to explain herself, in effect, before
the gentleman deigns to do it, and, by this
means, to oblige her to violate the modesty and
delicacy of her sex, and to invert the clearest
order of nature.</P>
<P>All this sacrifice is proposed to be made merely
to gratify a most despicable vanity in a man,
<PB N="28" REF="42"/>
who would degrade the very woman, whom he
wishes to make his wife.</P>
<P>But it should be distinguished whether from
this motive he delays to speak explicitly, or
from a diffidence inseperable from true attach∣ment.
In the one case he can scarce be used too
ill; in the other, he ought to be treated with
the greatest kindness.</P>
<P>Women endeavour to justify themselves to
the world, and to their own consciences by a
variety of excuses, when they act otherwise.
Sometimes they plead ignorance, or at least un∣certainty
of the gentleman's real sentiments.
Sometimes they plead the decorum of their sex,
which enjoins an equal behaviour to all men,
and forbids them to consider any man as a lover,
till he has directly told them so. But they are
not entitled to plead the obligation of their
virtues in opposition to the superior ones of
gratitude, justice, and humanity.</P>
<P>The man is entitled to all these, who prefers
one woman to the rest of her sex, and perhaps
whose greatest weakness is this very preference.
The truth of the matter is, vanity and the love
<PB N="29" REF="43"/>
of admiration is so prevailing a passion amongst
the sex, that they can be fond of the love, when
they are indifferent to, or, even, when they des∣pise
the lover.</P>
<P>But the deepest, and most artful coquettry is
employed by women of superior taste and sense,
to engage and fix the heart of a man whom the
world, and whom they themselves esteem, al∣though
they are determined never to marry
him. His conversation amuses them, and his at∣tachment
is the highest gratification to their
vanity; nay, they can sometimes be gratified
with the utter ruin of his fortune, fame, and
happiness.</P>
<P>How odious must characters of this kind ap∣pear,
especially when contracted with those
who have principles, have generosity and dignity
of soul, that elevates them above the worthless
vanity recited!</P>
<P>Such a woman may always convert a lover,
if she cannot give him her affections, into a warm
and steady friend, provided he is a man of
sense, resolution and candour. If she explains
herself to him with a generous openess and free∣dom,
<PB N="30" REF="44"/>
he must feel the stroke as a man; but he
will likewise bear it as a man: what he suffers
he will suffer in silence.</P>
<P>Every sentiment of esteem will remain; but
love, though it requires very little food, and is
easily surfeited with too much, yet it requires
some. He will view her in the light of a mar∣ried
woman; and though passion subsides, yet a
man of a candid and generous heart, always re∣tains
a tenderness for a woman, he has once
loved, and who has used him well, beyond what
he feels for any other of her sex.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>COURTSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>IF the attachment of a lover is agreeable to the
object of his wishes, a woman should permit
nature, good-sense and delicacy to direct her.
If she loves him she should not discover to him
the full extent of her love; no, not although she
marries him. That sufficiently shews her pre∣ference,
which is all he is entitled to know. If
he has delicacy he will ask for no stronger proof
<PB N="31" REF="45"/>
of her affection, for her sake: if he sense, he
will not ask if for his own.</P>
<P>Violent love cannot subsist, at least cannot be
expressed, for any time together on both sides;
otherwise the certain consequence, however
concealed, is satiety and disgust: nature in this
case has laid the reserve on woman.</P>
<P>If she sees evident proofs of a gentleman's
attachment, and is determined to shut her heart
against him, she should treat him honourable and
humanely. She should not let him linger in a
miserable suspence, but be anxious to let him
know her sentiments with regard to him; and
this may be done by a variety of ways,—from a
certain species of easy familiarity in behaviour
he may be satisfied, if he has any discernment,
he has nothing to hope for,—from sollicitously
avoiding his company,—from the interposition of
a common friend to explain matters to him.
But, if these methods are ineligible, opportunities
of letting him explain himself, should not be
avoided; it is acting barbarously and unjustly.
If he forces an explanation the answer should
be polite, resolute, and decisive.</P>

<HEAD>MAN'S DANGER AND SECURITY IN YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>IN that period of life too often characterized
by forward presumption and headlong pur∣suit,
self conceit is the great source of those dan∣gers
to which men are exposed; and it is pecu∣liarly
unfortunate, that the age which stands
most in need of the counsel of the wise, should
be the most prone to contemn it. Confident in
the opinions which they adopt, and in the mea∣sures
which they pursue, the bliss which youth
aim at, is, in their opinion, fully apparent.
It is not the danger of mistake, but the
failure of success, which they dread. Activity to
seize, not sagacity to discern, is the only requisite
which they value.</P>
<P>The whole state of nature is now become a
scene of delusion to the sensual mind. Hardly
any thing is what it appears to be: and what
flatters most is always farthest from reality.
There are voices which sing around us, but
whose strains allure to ruin, There is a banquet
spread where poison is in every dish. There is
<PB N="33" REF="47"/>
a couch which invites us to repose, but to slum∣ber
upon it is death. Sobriety should temper
unwary ardour; Modesty check rash presump∣tion;
Wisdom be the offsping of reflection now,
rather than the bitter fruit of experience here-after.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>DECEIT.</HEAD>
<P>THAT darkness of character, where we can
see no heart,—those foldings of art, through
which no native affection is allowed to penetrate,
present an object unamiable in every season of
life, but particularly odious in youth. If at an
age when the heart is warm, when the emo∣tions
are strong, and when nature is expected to
shew itself free and open, we can already smile
and deceive, what is to be expected, when we
shall be longer hackneyed in the ways of men,
when interest shall have completed the obdura∣tion
of our hearts, and experience shall have im∣proved
us in all the arts of guile?
Dissimulation in youth is the forerunner of
perfidy in old age: its first appearance is the
<PB N="34" REF="48"/>
fatal omen of growing depravity and future
shame. It degrades parts and learning, obscures
the lustre of every accomplishment, and sinks
us into contempt with God and man. The path
of falshood is a perplexing maze. After the
first departure from sincerity, it is not in our
power to stop. One artifice unavoidably leads
on to another; till, as the intricacy of the laby∣rinth
increases, we are left entangled in our own
snare.</P>
<P>Deceit discovers a little mind, which stops at
temporary expedients, without rising to compre∣hensive
views of conduct. IT betrays a dastardly
spirit. It is the resource of one who wants cou∣rage
to avow his designs, or to rest upon him∣self.
To set out in the world with no other
principle than a crafty attention to interest, be∣tokens
one who is destined for creeping through
the inferior walks of life. He may be fortunate,
he cannot be happy; the eye of a good man
will weep at his error: he cannot taste the
sweets of confidential friendship, and his evening
of life will be embittered by universal contempt.</P>

<HEAD>DEVOTION.</HEAD>
<P>IS the lively exercise of those affections, which
we owe to the supreme Being. It compre∣hends
several emotions of the heart which ter∣minate
in the same object. The chief of them
are veneration, gratitude, desire, and resig∣nation.</P>
<P>It implies first profound veneration for God,
that is an affection compounded of awe and
love;—secondly, sincere gratitude for all his
benefits: this is a warmer emotion than vene∣ration;
veneration looks up to the Deity
as he is himself; gratitude regards what he
is towards us;—thirdly, the desire of the soul
after the favour of the suprement Being, as its
chief good and final rest;—and fourthly, it ad∣vances
to an entire resignation of the soul to
God. It is the consummation of trust and hope.
It banishes anxious cares and murmuring thoughts.
It reconciles us to every appointment of divine
providence; and resolves every wish into the
desire of pleasing him, whom our hearts adore.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="50"/>
It is one of the noblest acts of which the hu∣man
mind is capable. It is a powerful principle
which penetrates the soul, which purifies the af∣fections
from debasing attachments; and, by
a fixed and steady regard to God, subdues every
sinful passion, and forms the inclinations to piety
and virtue.</P>
<P>It expresses the spirit which must animate all
religious duties. It stands opposed not merely
to downright vice; but to a heart which is
cold and insensible to sacred things, and obeys
the divine commands without ardour, love and
joy. It is rational and well-founded. It is of the
highest importance to every other part of reli∣gion
and virtue; and, in fine, is the most con∣ducive
to our happiness. It diffuses an auspici∣ous
influence over the whole of virtue. It is
often found a powerful instrument in humanizing
the manners of men, and taming their unruly
passions. It smooths what is rough, and softens
what is fierce in our nature. It is the great
purifier of the affections. It inspires contempt
of the low gratifications belonging to animal
life. It promotes a humble and cheerful con∣tentment
with our lot, and subdnes the eager
desire of riches and of power, which has filled
<PB N="37" REF="51"/>
this unhappy world with crimes and misery.
The spirit of devotion is the gift of God. From
his inspiration it proceeds; towards him it
tends; and in his presence hereafter, it shall
attain its full perfection.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MORALITY AND DEVOTION SEPERATE∣LY
INSUFFICIENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE man of mere morality is a stranger to all
the delicate and refined pleasures of devo∣tion.
In works of beneficence and mercy he
may enjoy satisfaction; but it will be destitute
of that glow of affection, which enlivens the
feelings of one, who lifts his heart at the same
time to the Father of the universe, and considers
himself as imitating God.</P>
<P>The man again who rests solely on devotion,
if that devotion opens not his heart to humanity,
not only remains a stranger to the pleasures of
beneficence, but must often undergo the pain
arising from bad passions.</P>

<HEAD>MODERN SENTIMENTAL DEVOTEES.</HEAD>
<P>IF we trace the history of sentiment from its
beginning, we shall find that girls, for a∣mongst
this class it runs to its greatest excess,
of this cast have had their heads originally turned
by pernicious reading, and the insanity confirmed
by imprudent friendships. They never fail to
select beloved confidants of their own turn and
humour, though, if they can help it, not so
handsome as themselves. Violent intimacies en∣sue,
or an <HI>intimate union of souls</HI> immediately
takes place.</P>
<P>They represent romantic love as the great
important business of human life, and describe
all the other concerns of it as too low and paltry
to merit the attention of such elevated beings,
and fit only to employ the daughters of the
plodding vulgar.</P>
<P>Another favourite topic, is the groveling
spirit and sordid temper of their parents, who
will be sure to find no quarter at the hands of
<PB N="39" REF="53"/>
their daughters, should they presume to direct
their course of reading, interfere in their choice
of friends, or interrupt their very important
correspondence. For a prohibited correspon∣dence,
is one of the great incidents of sentimen∣tal
life, and a letter clandestinely received, the
supreme felicity of a sentimental lady. Hence,
such prohibition with them carries a certain air
of tyranny and persecution <HI>which is very de∣lightful.</HI></P>
<P>They consider the aged and experienced,
who endeavour to destroy this ignis fatuus, as
wretches utterly ignorant of the sublime plea∣sures
of a delicate and exalted passion, as tyrants
whose authority is to be condemned, and as
spies whose vigilance is to be eluded. The pru∣dence
of these worthy friends they term suspi∣cion,
and their experience dotage.</P>
<P>But young people never shew their folly and
ignorance more conspicuously, than by this over∣confidence
in their own judgment, and this
haughty disdain of the opinion of those who
have known more days. Youth has a quickenss
of apprehension, which it is very apt to mis∣take
for an acuteness of penetration. But youth,
<PB N="40" REF="54"/>
like cunning, though very conceited, is very
short sighted; and never more so, than when

<P>These daughters of vanity imagine that none
but the young and beautiful have any right to
the pleasures of society, or even to the common
benefits and blessings of life.—Ladies of this
turn also affect the most lofty disregard for use∣ful
qualities and domestic virtues; they princi∣pally
value themselves on the enlargement of
their notions, and their liberal way of thinking.
This superiority of soul chiefly manifests itself
in the contempt of those minute delicacies, and
little decorums, which, trifling as they may be
thought, tend at once to dignify the character,
restrain the levity of the younger part of the
sex, and to eradicate this sort of sentiment,
which is only a weed of idleness; for they,
who are constantly and usefully employed, have
neither leisure nor propensity to cultivate this
<HI>delightful folly.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DISCONTENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the humble and seemingly quiet shade of
private life, as well as among the great and
mighty, discontent broods over its imaginary
sorrows; preys upon the citizen no less than the
courtier, and often nourishes passions equally ma∣lignant
in the cottage and in the palace. Hav∣ing
once seized the mind, it spreads its own
gloom over every surrounding object; it every
where searches out materials for itself; and
in no direction more frequently employs its un∣happy
activity, than in creating divisions among
mankind, and in magnifying slight provocations
into mortal injuries.</P>
<P>In situations where much comfort might be
enjoyed, this man's superiority and that man's
neglect, our jealousy of a friend, our hatred of a
rival, an imagined affront, or a mistaken point
of honour, allow us no respose. Hence dis∣cord
in families, animosities among friends, and
wars among nations! Look around us! every
where we find a busy multitude. Restless and
<PB N="42" REF="56"/>
uneasy in their present situation, they are inces∣santly
employed in accomplishing a change of it;
and as soon as their wish is fulfilled, we discern
by their behaviour, that they are as dissatisfied as
they were before. Where they expected to
have found a paradise, they find a desert.</P>
<P>The man of business pines for leisure; the lei∣sure
for which he had longed proves an irksome
gloom, and through want of employment, he
languishes, sickens, and dies.</P>
<P>The man of retirement fancies no state so
happy as that of active life; but he has not en∣gaged
long in the tumults and contests of the
world, until he finds cause to look back with re∣gret
on the calm hours of his former privacy and
retreat.</P>
<P>Beauty, wit, eloquence, and fame, are
eagerly desired by persons in every rank of life.
They are the parents fondest wish for his child;
the ambition of the young, and the admiration
of the old; and yet in what numberless instances
have they proved, to those who possessed them,
no other than shining snares, seductions to vice,
instigations to folly, and, in the end, sources
of misery.</P>

<HEAD>DISSIPATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE love of dissipation is allowed to be the
reigning evil of the present day. It is an
evil which many content themselves with regret∣ting,
without seeking to redress.</P>
<P>It is too often cultivated as the readiest relief
to domestic infelicity; it draws the mind awhile
from the subject of its distress, and suffers it to
enjoy an interval of ease; but this resource is as
treacherous as it is momentary, and plunges the
mind into more real distress than that from which
it promised to relieve it.</P>
<P>Every one seems convinced that the evil so
much complained of does really exist somewhere,
though all are inwardly persuaded that it is not
with themselves. All desire a general reforma∣tion,
but few will listen to proposals of particular
amendment.</P>
<P>Dissipation not only indisposes its votaries, by
relaxing the tone of mind, and rendering it in∣capable
<PB N="44" REF="58"/>
of application, study or virtue, to every
thing useful and excellent, but disqualifies them
for the enjoyment of pleasure itself. It softens
the soul so much, that the most superficial em∣ployment
becomes a labour, and the slightest in∣convenience
an agony. The roses of pleasure
seldom last long enough to adorn the brow of
him who plucks them; for they are the only
roses which do not retain their sweetness after
they have lost their beauty.</P>

<HEAD>DUTY OF OLD AGE.</HEAD>
<P>A MATERIAL part of the duty of the aged

who are to succeed them. Here opens to them
extensive field, in which they may so employ
themselves as considerably to advance the hap∣piness
of mankind. To them it belongs to
impart to the young the fruit of their long expe∣rience;
to instruct them in the proper conduct,
and to warn them of the various dangers of
life; by wife counsel to temper their precipi∣tate
ardour, and both by precept and example
to form them to piety and virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="59"/>
It never appears with greater dignity, than
when tempered with mildness and enlivened
with good-humour; it acts as a guide and a
patron of youth.</P>
<P>Religion, displayed in such a character, strikes
the beholders, as at once amiable and venerable.
They revere its power, why they see it adding
so much grace to the decays of nature, and shed∣ding
so pleasing a lustre over the evening of life.
The young wish to tread in the same steps, and
to arrive at the close of their days with equal
honour.</P>
<P>They listen with attention to counsels which
are mingled with tenderness, and rendered respectable
by grey hairs.</P>
<P>Aged wisdom, when joined with acknow∣ledged
virtue, exerts an authority over the hu∣man
mind, greater even than that which arises
from power and station. It can check the most
forward; abash the most profligate, and strike
with awe the most giddy and unthinking.</P>

<HEAD>FEMALE EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the great and real
improvements which have been made in the
affair of female education, and the more en∣larged
and generous views of it, which prevail
in the present day, there is still a material defect,
which is not in general the object of attention
to remove. The defect seems to consist in this,
that too little regard is paid to the dispositions
of the mind, that the indications of the temper
are not properly cherished, nor the affections of
the heart sufficiently regulated.</P>
<P>The exterior should be made a considerable
object of attention, but not the principal,
not the only one. The graces should be in∣dustriously
cultivated, but they should not be
cultivated at the expense of the virtues. The
arms, the head, the whole person should be
carefully polished, but the heart should not be
the only portion of the human anatomy, which
should be totally overlooked.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="61"/>
Music, dancing, and languages gratify those
who teach them, by perceptible and almost im∣mediate
effects; and every observer can, in some
measure, judge of the progress. The effects of
these accomplishments adderss themselves to the
senses; and there are more who can hear and
see, than there are who can judge and reflect.</P>
<P>Personal perfection is not only more obvious,
it is also more rapid; and even in very accom∣plished
characters, elegance usually precedes
principle.</P>
<P>But the heart, that natural seat of evil pro∣pensities,
that little troublesome empire of the
passions, is led to what is right by show mo∣tions
and imperceptible degrees. It must be ad∣monished
by reproof, and allured by kindness.
Its liveliest advances are frequently impeded by
the obstinacy of prejudice, and its brightest pro∣mises
often obscured by the tempests of passion.
It is slow in its acquisition of virtue, and re∣luctant
in its approaches to piety.</P>
<P>The labours of a good and wise mother, who
is anxious for her daughter's most important in∣terests,
will seem to be at variance with those
<PB N="48" REF="62"/>
of her instructors. Humility and piety form the
solid and durable basis on which she wishes to
raise the superstructure of the accomplishments,
while the accomplishments themselves are fre∣quently
of that unsteady nature, that if the foun∣dation
is not secured, in proportion as the build∣ing
is enlarged, it will be overloaded and de∣stroyed
by those very ornaments, which were
intended to embellish what they have contri∣buted
to ruin.</P>
<P>The more ostensible qualifications should be
carefully regulated, or they will be in danger of
putting to flight the modest train of retreating
virtues, which cannot safely subsist before the
bold eye of public observation, nor bear the
bolder tongue of impudent and audacious flattery.</P>
<P>Merely ornamental accomplishments will but
indifferently qualify a woman to perform the
<HI>duties</HI> of life, thought it is highly proper she should
possess them, in order to furnish the <HI>amusements</HI> of
it. Yet, though the well-bred woman should learn
to dance, sing, recite, and draw; the end of a good
education, is not that they may become singers,
dancers, players or painters; its real object is to
make them good daughters, good wives, good
<PB N="49" REF="63"/>
mistresses, good members of society, and good
christians.</P>
<P>To an injudicious and superficial eye, the best
educated girl may make the least brilliant figure,
as she will probably have less flippancy in her
manner, and less repartee in her expression;
and her acquirements will be rather <HI>enamelled
than embossed.</HI> But her merit will be known by
all who come near enough to discern, and have
taste enough to distinguish.</P>
<P>A truly good and well educated young lady
will be found in the bosom of retirement, in
the practice of every domestic virtue, in the
performance of every amiable accomplishment, ex∣erted
in the shade, to enliven retirement,—to
heighten the endearing pleasures of social inter∣course,—and
to embellish the narrow, but charm∣ing
circle of family delights; and to this amiable
purpose dedicating her more elegant accomplish∣ments,
instead of exhibiting them to attract ad∣miration,
or depress inferiority.</P>
<P>One great art of education consists in not suf∣fering
the feelings to become too acute by un∣necessary
awakening, nor too obtuse by the want
of exertion. The former renders them the source
<PB N="50" REF="64"/>
of calamity, and totally ruins the temper; while
the latter blunts and debases them, and produces
a dull, cold, and selfish spirit. The precious sen∣sibility
of an open temper; the amiable glow of
an ingenuous soul; the bright flame of a noble
and generous spirit, are of higher worth than all
the documents of learning, of dearer price than
all the advantages, which can be derived from
the most refined and artificial mode of education.</P>
<P>Sensibility, delicacy and an ingenuous temper,
are of more esteem than language or music, for
they are the language of the heart, and the music
of the according passions. Every appearance of
amiable simplicity, or of honest shame, will be
dear to sensible hearts; they should carefully
cherish every such indication in a young female;
for they will perceive that it is this temper,
wisely cultivated, which will one day make her
enamoured of the loveliness or virtue, and the
beauty of holiness; from which she will acquire
a taste for the doctrines of religion, and a spirit
to perform the duties of it.</P>
<P>Prudence is not natural to children; however,
they can substitute art in its stead. But there is
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very errors of
<PB N="51" REF="65"/>
nature, where they are undisguised, than in the
affectation of virtue itself, where the reality is
wanting. The precise and premature wisdom,
which some girls have cunning enough to assume,
is of a more dangerous tendency than any of
their natural failings can be, as it effectually
covers those secret bad dispositions, which, if they
displayed themselves, might be rectified. The
hypocrisy of assuming virtues which are not in∣herent
in the heart, prevents the growth and
disclosure of those real ones, which it is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he
great end of education to cultivate.</P>
<P>This cunning, which of all the different dispo∣sitions
girls discover, is most to be dreaded, is
encreased by nothing so much as fear. The in∣discreet
transports of rage, which many betray
on every slight occasion; and the little distinctions
they make between venial errors and premedi∣tated
crimes; naturally dispose a child to con∣ceal,
what she does not however care to suppress;
anger in one, will not remedy the faults of another.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding girls should not be trea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
with unkindness, nor the first openings of the
passions blighted by cold severity; yet they
<PB N="52" REF="66"/>
should be accustomed very early in life to a cer∣tain
degree of restraint. The natural cast of
character, and the moral distinctions of the sexes,
should not be disregarded, even in childhood.</P>
<P>That bold, independent enterprizing spirit,
which is so much admired in boys, should not,
when it happens to discover itself in the other
sex, be encouraged, but suppressed. Girls should
be taught to give up their opinions betimes,
and not pertinaciously carry on a dispute, even
if they know themselves to be in the right.
Yet they should not be robbed of the liberty of
private judgment, but by no means encouraged
to contract a contentious or contradictory turn.
It is of the greatest importance to their future
happiness, that they should acquire a submissive
temper, and a forbearing spirit: for it is a les∣son
the world will not fail to make them fre∣quently
practise, when they come abroad into
it, and they will not practise it the worse for
having learnt it the sooner.</P>
<P>There is more piety, as well as more sense,
in labouring to improve the talents which chil∣dren
actually have, than in lamenting that they
do not possess supernatural endowments or angelic
<PB N="53" REF="67"/>
perfections. A girl who has docility, will sel∣dom
be found to want understanding enough
for all the purposes of a social, a happy, and an
useful life, and those who hope to do a great
deal, must not expect to do every thing. If they
know any thing of the malignity of sin, the blind∣ness
of prejudice, or the corruption of the human
heart; they will also know, that the heart will
always remain after the very best possible edu∣cation,
full of infirmity and imperfection.—They
should consider that they are not educa∣ting
cherubims and seraphims, by men and
women; creatures, who at their best estate, are
altogether vanity: how little can be expected
from them in the weakness and imbecillity of
infancy!</P>
<P>Our passions themselves by proper manage∣ment,
may be made subservient to some good
end, for there is scarcely a single one which may
not be turned to profitable account, if prudently
rectified, and skilfully directed into the road of
some neighbouring virtue. Envy and lying
must be always excepted, they must be radically
cured before any good can be expected from
the heart which has been infected with them.
For envy, though passed through all the moral
<PB N="54" REF="68"/>
strainers cannot be refined into virtuous emula∣tion,
or lying improved into an agreeable turn
for innocent invention.</P>
<P>To win the passions, therefore, over to the
cause of virtue, answers a much nobler end than
their extinction would possibly do, even if that
could be effected; for they resemble fires, which
are friendly and beneficial when under proper
direction; but if suffered to blaze without re∣straint
they carry devastation along with them;
and, if totally extinguished, leave the benighted
mind in a state of cold and comfortless inanity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>EFFECTS OF RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION prepares the mind of man for all
the events of this inconstant state, instructs
him in the nature of true happiness; early weans
him from an undue love of the world: afflictions
do not attack him by surprise, and therefore do
not overwhelm him; he is equiped for the
storm, as well as the calm, in this dubious navi∣gation
of life. He is not overcome by dissappoint∣ment,
when that which is mortal dies; when
<PB N="55" REF="69"/>
that which is mutable begins to change; and
when that which he knew to be transient passes
away.</P>
<P>Religion not only purifies, but also fortifies
the heart, so that the devout man is neither
lifted up by success, nor enervated by sensuality,
he meets the changes in his lot without unmanly
dejection.—He is inured to temperance and
restraint.—he has learned firmness, and self-com∣mand.—He
is accustomed to look up to supreme
providence, not with reverence only, but with
trust and hope.</P>
<P>In prosperity he cultivates his mind. Stores
it with useful knowledge, with good principles,
and virtuous dispositions. The resources remain
entire when the day of trouble comes. His
chief pleasures are always of the calm innocent
and temperate kind, and over those, the changes
of the world have the least power. His mind is
a kingdom to him, and he can ever enjoy it.</P>

<DIV2>
<PB N="56" REF="70"/>
<HEAD>SUPERSTITION AND ENTHUSIASM.</HEAD>
<P>SUPERSTITION and enthusiasm are two ca∣pital
sources of delusion. Superstition, on
the one hand, attaching men with immoderate
zeal, to the ritual and external part of religion.
Enthusiasm, on the other, directing their whole
intention to internal emotions, and mystical
communications with the spiritual world; while
neither the one, nor the other, has paid suffi∣cient
regard to the great moral duties of the
Christian life. Indeed the horror of superstition
has sometimes reached so far, as to produce
contempt for all external institutions; whilst
persons of a devout turn being carried by warm
affections at times into unjustifiable excesses,
have thence made many conclude that all devo∣tion
was akin to enthusiasm.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>ANGER AND ENVY CONTRASTED.</HEAD>
<P>ANGER is less reasonable and more sincere
than envy. Anger breaks out abruptly;
envy is a great prefacer: anger wishes to be
understood at once: envy if fond of remote
<PB N="57" REF="71"/>
hints and ambiguities; but obscure as it's oracles
are, it never ceases to deliver them till they are
perfectly comprehended: anger repeats the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> circumstances over again; envy invents
new ones at every fresh recital: anger gives a
broken, vehement, and interrupted narrative;
envy tells a more consistent, and more probable,
though a falser tale: anger is excessively im∣prudent,
for it is impatient to disclose every
thing it knows; envy is discreet for it has a
great deal to hide: anger never consults times
or seasons; envy waits for the lucky moment
when the wound it meditates may be made the
most exquisitely painful, and the most incurably
deep: anger uses more invective; envy does
more mischief.</P>
<P>Simple anger soon runs itself out of breath,
and is exhausted at the end of it's tale; but it
is for that chosen period that envy has treasured
up the most barbed arrow in its whole quiver:
anger puts a man out of himself; but the truly
malicious generally preserve the appearance of
self-possession, or they could not so effectually
injure: anger talks loudly of its own wrongs;
envy of its adversary's injustice: anger is a vio∣lent
act; envy a constant habit: no one can be
always angry, but he may be always envious.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="72"/>
An angry man's enmity (if he be generous)
will subside when the object of his resentment
becomes unfortunate; but the envious man can
extract food from his malice out of calamity
itself, if he finds his adversary bears it with
dignity, or is pitied or assisted in it. The rage
of the passionate man is totally extinguished by
the death of his enemy; but the hatred of the
malicious is not buried even in the grave of his
rival; he will envy the good name he has left
behind him; he will envy him the tears of his
widow, the prosperity of his children, the
esteem of his friends, the praises of his epitaph;
nay, the very magnificence of his funeral.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>EVENTS UNCERTAIN.</HEAD>
<P>MAN walketh in a vain show. His fears are
often as vain as his wishes. As what flat∣tered
him in expectation, frequently wounds
him in possession; so that the event to which
he looked forward with an anxious and fearful
eye, has often, when it arrived, laid its terrors
aside; nay, has brought in its train unexpected
blessings.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="73"/>
Both good and evil are beheld at a distance;
through a perspective which deceives. The
colours of objects when nigh, are entirely dif∣ferent
from what they appeared, when they ap∣peared
in futurity. It is common for men to be
deceived in their prospects of happiness. They
judge by the sensations of the present moment,
and in the fervour of desire pronounce confi∣dently
concerning the desired object. But reflect
not that their minds, like their bodies, undergo
great alteration from the situation into which
they are thrown, and the progressive stages of
life through which they pass.</P>
<P>Hence, concerning any conditon which is
yet untried, they conjecture with much uncer∣tainty.
In imagination they carry their pre∣sent
wants, inclinations, and sentiments into
the state of life to which they aspire. But no
sooner have they entered into it than their sen∣timents
and inclinations change. New wants
and desires arise, new objects are required to
gratify them; and by consequence their old dis∣satisfaction
returns, and the void which was to
have been filled remains as great as it was before.</P>

<HEAD>FAITH, PIETY, AND ACTIVE VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>LIFE passed under the influence of such dis∣positions

It is not enough to say faith and piety joined
with active virtue constitute the requisite prepa∣ration
for heaven. They in truth begin the
enjoyment of heaven. In every state of our
existence they form the chief ingredients of
felicity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>FALSE SENTIMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a refined jargon, which has infest∣ed
letters and tainted morals unknown to
our plaint ancestors called <HI>sentiment, which is the
varnish of virtue to conceal the deformity of
vice;</HI> and it is not uncommon for the same
persons to make a jest of religion, to break
through the most solemn ties and engagements,
to practise every art of latent fraud and open
seduction, and yet to value themselves on speak∣ing
and writing sentimentally.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="75"/>
Error is never likely to do so much mischief
as when it disguises its real tendency, and puts
on an engaging and attractive appearance.
Many a young woman who would be shocked
at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely
flattered at the idea of a sentimental connexion,
though perhaps with a dangerous and designing
man. Such an engagement will be infinitely
dearer to her vanity, than an avowed and au∣thorised
attachment.</P>
<P>In order to maintain the sentimental cha∣racter
with dignity and propriety, a woman en∣tertains
the most elevated ideas of dispropor∣tionate
alliances, and disinterested love; and
considers fortune, rank, and reputation as mere
chimerical distinctions and vulgar prejudices.
And among the many smooth mischiefs of senti∣ment,
it is one of its sure and successful frauds
to affect the most frigid indifference to those
external and pecuniary advantages, which is
its great and real object to obtain.</P>
<P>A sentimental girl very rarely entertains any
doubt of her personal beauty; for she has been
daily accustomed to contemplate it herself, and
to hear it from others. She will not, therefore,
<PB N="62" REF="76"/>
be very solicitous for the confirmation of a truth
so self-evident; but she suspects her pretensions
to understanding are more likely to be disputed;
and, for that reason, greedily devours every
compliment offered to those perfections which
are less obvious, and more refined. She is per∣suaded
that men need only open their eyes to
decide on her beauty; while it will be the most
convincing proof of the taste, sense, and ele∣gance
of her admirer that he can discern, and
flatter those qualities in her.</P>
<P>This latent but leading foible forms a clue to
the heart; directed by this the lover affects to
overlook that beauty which attracts common
eyes: while he bestows the most delicate praises
on the beauties of the mind; and finishes the
climax of adulation by hinting she is superior
to it.</P>
<P>These sublime attachments, if they end not
in seduction, seldom conclude delightfully, even
though they should terminate in the vulgar cata∣strophe
of marriage. The visionary heaven
soon fleets away, and the deluded goddess is
shocked to find herself stripped of all her celestial
attributes. She now beholds herself of less im∣portance
<PB N="63" REF="77"/>
in the esteem of the man she has
chosen, than <HI>any other mere mortal woman.</HI></P>
<P>No longer she is gratified with the tear of
counterfeited passion, the sigh of dissembled
rapture, or the language of premeditated ado∣ration.
No longer is the altar of her vanity
loaded with the oblations of fictitious fondness,
the incense of falsehood, or the sacrifice of flat∣tery.
Her apothosis is ended!—She feels her∣self
degraded from the dignities and privileges
of a goddess, to all the imperfections, vanities,
and weaknesses of a slighted woman, and a neg∣lected
wife. Her faults which were so lately
overlooked, or mistaken for virtues, are now
set in a note book. The passion, which was
vowed eternal, lasted only a few short weeks;
and the indifference which was so far from be∣ing
included in the bargain, that it was not so
much as suspected, follows them through the
whole tiresome journey of their insipid, vacant
and joyless existence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
<HEAD>FELICITY EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the different conditions and ranks
of men, the balance of happiness is pre∣served
in a great measure equal; and the high
and low, the rich and the poor, approach in
point of real enjoyment much nearer to each
other than is commonly imagined. Providence
never intended that any state here should either
be completely happy, or entirely miserable.</P>
<P>If the feelings of pleasure are more numerous
and more lively, in the higher departments of
life, such also are those of pain.—If greatness
flatters our vanity, it multiplies our dangers.—
If opulence encreases our gratification, it en∣creases,
in the same proportion, our desires and
demands.—If the poor are confined to a more
narrow circle, yet within that circle lie most
of those natural satisfactions, which, after all
the refinements of art, are found to be the most
genuine and true. For the happiness of every
man depends more upon the state of his own
mind than upon any one external circumstance;
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
nay, more than upon all external things put to∣gether.</P>
<P>Inordinate passions are the great disturbers
of life; and unless we possess a good consci∣ence,
and a well governed mind, discontent
will blast every enjoyment, and the highest pro∣sperity
will only prove disgusted misery. This
conclusion then should be fixed in the mind:
The destruction of virtue is the destruction of
peace. In no station—in no period are we se∣cure
from the dangers which spring from our
passions. Every age, and every station they
beset, from youth to grey hairs, and from the
peasant to the prince.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>FELICITY TEMPORAL.</HEAD>
<P>OUR imperfect knowledge of what is good
or evil should attach us the more to those
few things, concerning which, there can be no
doubt of their being truly good.</P>
<P>Of temporal things which belong to this class,
the catalogue, it must be confessed, is small.
<PB N="66" REF="80"/>
Perhaps the chief worldly good we should wish
to enjoy, is a sound mind in a sound body.
Health and peace, a moderate fortune, and a
few friends, sum up all the undoubted articles
of temporal felicity.</P>
<P>He whose wishes, respecting this world, are
the most reasonable and bounded, is likely to
lead the safest, and, for that reason, the most
desirable life. By aspiring too high we frequent∣ly
miss the happiness, which by a less ambitious
aim, we might have gained. High happiness
on earth is rather a picture which the imagina∣tion
forms, than reality which man is allowed
to possess.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SPIRITUAL FELICITY</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to spiritual felicity, we are
not confined to humble views. Clear and
determinate objects are proposed to our pursuits,
and full scope is given to our most ardent desires.
The forgiveness of our sins, and God's holy
grace to guide our life; the protection and fa∣vour
of the great father of all, of the blessed Re∣deemer
<PB N="67" REF="81"/>
of mankind, and of the spirit of sanctifi∣cation
and comfort; these are objects, in the
pursuit of which there is no room for hesitation
and distrust.</P>
<P>Had providence spread an equal obscurity
over happiness of every kind, we might have
had some reason to complain of the vanity of
our condition. But we are not left to so hard
a fate. The Son of God hath removed that veil
which covered true bliss from the search of wan∣dering
mortals, and hath taught them the way
which leads to eternal life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>WANT OF FORESIGHT RESPECTING
OUR SPIRITUAL STATE.</HEAD>
<P>WE foresee the dangers of our spiritual still
less than we do those of our natural state;
because we are less attentive to trace them. We
are still more exposed to vice than misery.
We cannot esteem him prosperous who is raised
to a situation which flatter his passions, but
which corrupts his principles, disorders his tem∣per,
and, finally, oversets his virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="82"/>
In the ardour of pursuit these effects are not
foreseen; and yet how often are they accom∣plished
by the change of condition. Latent
corruptions are called forth;—seeds of guilt are
quickened into life;—a growth of crimes arises,
which, had it not been for the fatal culture: of
prosperity, would never have seen the light.</P>
<P>Man, boastful as he is of reason, is merely
the creature of his fortune, formed and moulded
by the incidents of his life; incapable of pro∣nouncing
with certainty concerning his own good
or evil; of futurity he discerns little, and even
that little he sees through a cloud.—Ignorant of
the alteration which his sentiments and desires
will undergo from new situations in life;—igno∣rant
of the consequences which will follow from
the combination of his circumstances with those
of others around him;—ignorant of the influence
which the present may have on the future events
of life;—ignorant of the effect which a change of
condition may produce on his moral character
and his eternal interests; how can he know <HI>what
is good for him all the days of his vain life, which
spendeth as a shadow.</HI> Instead therefore of la∣menting
this ignorance only, he should consider
<PB N="69" REF="83"/>
how it onght to be improved; what duties it
suggests; and what wise ends it was intended
by providenoe to promote.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>IN young minds there is commonly a strong
propensity to particular intimacies and friend∣ships.
Youth, indeed, is the season when friend∣ships
are sometimes formed, which not only con∣tinue
through succeeding life, but which glow
to the last, with a tenderness unknown to the
connections begun in cooler years. The pro∣pensity
therefore is not to be discouraged;
though at the same time, it must be regulated
with much circumspection and care.</P>
<P>Too many of the pretended friendships of
youth, are mere combinations in pleasure. They
are often founded on capricious likings, sudden∣ly
contracted, and as suddenly dissolved▪ Some∣times
they are the effect of interested complai∣sance
and flattery on the one side, and of cre∣dulous
fondness on the other. Such rash and dan∣gerous
connections should be avoided, lest they
afterwards load us with dishonour.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="84"/>
We should ever have it fixed in our memories,
that by the character of those whom we choose
for our friends our own is likely to be formed,
and will certainly be judged of by the world.
We ought, therefore, to be slow and cautious
in contracting intimacy; but when a virtuous
friendship is once established we must ever con∣sider
it as a sacred engagement.</P>
<P>We should not expose ourselves to the re∣proach
of lightness and inconstancy; which al∣ways
bespeak either a trifling or a base mind.
We should not reveal any secrets of our friends;
but be faithful to his interests. Forsake him
not in danger; and abhor the thought of acqui∣ring
any advantage by his prejudice or hurt.</P>
<P>In the choice of friends principal regard should
be had to goodness of heart and fidelity. If
they possess taste and genius, that will make
them more agreeable and useful companions.
To those who deserve the name of friends we
should always unbosom ourselves with the most
unsuspicious confidence. An open temper, if re∣strained
but by tolerable prudence, will make us,
upon the whole, much happier than a suspicious
one, although by it we may sometimes suffer.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="85"/>
Coldness and distrust are but the too certain
consequences of age and experience; but they
are unpleasant feelings, and need not be antici∣pated
before their time. We should never disclose
the secrets of one friend to another. They
are secret deposits which do not belong to us,
nor have we any right to make use of them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>GALLANTRY.</HEAD>
<P>THOUSANDS of women of the best hearts
and finest parts have been ruined by men
who approach them under the specious name of
friendship. But supposing a man to have the
most undoubted honour, yet his friendship to
woman is often so near a-kin to love, that if
she be very agreeable in her person, she will
probably very soon find a lover, where she wished
only to meet a friend. Yet women should be
warned against that weakness so common among
the vain, the imagination that every man who
takes particular notice of them is a lover. No∣thing
can expose them more to ridicule, than ta∣king
up a man on the suspicion of being their
lover, when perhaps he never once thought
<PB N="72" REF="86"/>
of them in that view; and giving themselves
those airs so common to silly women on such oc∣casions.</P>
<P>For there is a kind of unmeaning gallantry
much practised by some men, which, by those
who have any discernment, will readily be found
harmless. The little observances, attentions
and compliments of such men should be regarded
as things of course, which they repeat to every
agreeable woman of their acquaintance. There
is a familiarity they are apt to assume, which a
proper dignity of behaviour will be easily able to
check.</P>
<P>But there are people, whose sentiments, and
particularly whose tastes, correspond naturally,
like to associate together, although neither of
them have the most distant view of any further
connection. But this similarity of minds often
gives rise to tenderness superior to what friend∣ship
demands, it will be prudent in this case to
keep a watchful eye over ourselves, lest our hearts
become too far engaged before we are aware of
that something more than friendly partiality;
and experience the unsuspected power of a too
interested attachment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="73" REF="87"/>
<HEAD>GOD WITH RESPECT TO MAN.</HEAD>
<P>IN the midst of his glory the Almighty is not
inattentive to the meanest of his subjects.
Neither obscurity of station, nor imperfection of
knowledge, sinks those below his regard who
worship and obey him. Every prayer which
they send up from their secret retirement is lis∣tened
to by him; and every work of charity
which they perform, how unknown soever to
the world, attracts his notice.</P>
<P>He is the patron of the distressed. Compas∣sion
is that attribute of his nature which he has
chosen to place in the greatest variety of lights,
on purpose that he might accommodate his ma∣jesty
to our weakness, and provide a cordial for
human griefs.</P>
<P>All his creatures he governs with justice and
wisdom—an afflicted state he commisserates—he
is the refuge of the virtuous and pious, and in∣vites
them, amidst all their troubles to pour out
their hearts before him. The neglect, or scorn
<PB N="74" REF="88"/>
of the world, exposes them not to any contempt
in his sight. No obscurity conceals them from
his notice, and though they should be for∣gotten
by every friend on earth, they are re∣membered
by the God of heaven.</P>
<P>That sigh heaved from the afflicted bosom,
which is heard by no human ear, is listened to
by him; and that tear is remarked which falls
unnoticed, or despised by the world. These present
his administration under an aspect so mild
and benign as in a great measure to disperse
the gloom which hangs over human life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>IGNORANCE OF GOOD AND EVIL,
ITS UTILITY.</HEAD>
<P>IT serves to check presumption and rashness,
and to enforce a diligent exertion of our ra∣tional
powers, joined with a humble depend∣ence
on divine aid. It moderates eager passions
respecting worldly success. It inculcates resig∣nation
to the disposal of a providence which is
much wiser than man. It restrains us from em∣ploying
unlawful means, in order to compass our
<PB N="75" REF="89"/>
most favourite designs. It tends to attach us
more closely to those things which are unques∣tionably
good. It is therefore such a degree of
ignorance as suits the present circumstances of
man better than more complete information con∣cerning
good and evil. At the same time the
causes which render this obscurity necessary, too
plainly indicate a broken and corrupted state of
human nature. They shew this life to be a short
trial. They suggest the ideas of a land of pilgri∣mage,
not of a house of rest.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>GOOD MAN.</HEAD>
<P>HE is devout and benevolent, and according
to his measure of religious knowledge stu∣dies
to perform his duty, prays to God always,
and gives much alms to the people; joining piety
with charity; faith with good works; devo∣tion
with morality, consistent with the con∣nexion
ordained by God between them: for alms
without prayers, or prayers without alms; mo∣rality
without devotion, or devotion without
morality, are extremely defective.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="90"/>
A good man acts with vigour, and suffers with
a patience more than human, when he believes
himself countenanced by the Almighty. Injured
or oppressed by the world, he looks up to a judge
who will vindicate his cause; he appeals to a
witness who knows his integrity; he commits
himself to a friend who will never forsake him.
When tired with the vexations of life, devotion
opens to him its quiet retreat, where the tumults
of the world are hushed, and its cares are lost in
happy oblivion.</P>
<P>There his mind regains its serenity; the agi∣tation
of passion is calmed; and a softening balm
is infused into the wounds of the spirit; his heart
is lightened; he does not feel himself solitary or
sorsaken; he believes God to be present with
him, and as he hears a voice which speaks to
none but the pure in heart, so he beholds a hand
which sinners cannot see.</P>
<P>Those afflictions which appear to others the
messengers of the wrath of heaven, appear to
him the ministers of sanctification and justice.
Where they discern nothing but the horrours of
the tempest which surrounds them, his more en∣lightened
eye beholds the angel who rides in the
whirlwind and directs the storm.</P>

<DIV2>
<PB N="77" REF="91"/>
<HEAD>EFFECT OF LOOSE GRATIFICATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>BY a continued series of loose, though appa∣rently
trivial gratifications, the heart is of∣ten
as thoroughly corrupted, as by the commis∣sion
of any one of those enormous crimes which
spring from great ambition, or great revenge.
Habit gives the passions strength, while the ab∣sence
of glaring guilt seemingly justifies them;
and unawakened by remorse, the sinner proceeds
in his course, till he waxes bold in guilt, and be∣comes
ripe for ruin; for by gradual and latent
steps the destruction of our virtue advances.
We are imperceptibly betrayed; and from one
licentious attachment, are by a train of conse∣quences,
drawn on to another, till the govern∣ment
of our minds is irrecoverably lost.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>GRATITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>GRATITUDE is a pleasing emotion. The
sense of being distinguished by the kindness
of another gladens the heart, warms it with
<PB N="78" REF="92"/>
reciprocal affection, and gives to any profession,
which is agreeable in itself, a double relish, from
its being the gift of a friend. Favours though,
conferred by men, may become burdensome;
but nothing of this kind can affect the inter∣course
of gratitude with heaven. Its favours
are wholly disinterested. The Almighty aims
at no end but the happiness of those whom he
blesses, and who desires no return from them
but a devout and thankful heart.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>WORLDLY GREATNESS AND HONOURS,</HEAD>
<P>WHEN enjoyed with temperance and wis∣dom,
both enlarge our utility, and con∣tribute
to our comfort. But we should not over∣rate
them; for unless we add to them the ne∣cessary
correctives of piety and virtue, besides
corrupting the mind, and ingendering internal
misery, they lead us among precipices, and be∣tray
us into ruin.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="79" REF="93"/>
<HEAD>HAPPINESS—HOW JUDGED OF;</HEAD>
<P>IMPERFECTLY can we judge of real happi∣ness
or misery from external appearance.—We
are seduced and deceived by that false glare
which prosperity throws around bad men;—we
are tempted to imitate their crimes, in order
to partake of their imagined felicity.</P>
<P>The pageant of grandeur displayed to public
view is not the ensign of certain happiness. We
must follow the great man into the retired
apartment, where he lays aside his disguise, in
order to form any just conclusion. We must
have a faculty by which we can look into the
inside of hearts; then should we behold good
men, in proportion to their goodness, satisfied
and easy; atrocious sinners always restless and
unhappy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="80" REF="94"/>
<HEAD>HAPPINESS NOT INDEPENDENT.</HEAD>
<P>NO individual can be happy unless the circum∣stances
of those around him be so adjusted
as to conspire with his interest. For in human
society, no happiness or misery stands uncon∣nected
and independent. Our fortunes are in∣terwoven
by threads innumerable: one man's
success or misfortune, his wisdom or folly often,
by its consequences, reaches through multitudes.</P>
<P>Such a system is too far complicated for our
arrangement.—It requires ajustments beyond
our skill and power.—It is a chaos of events
into which our eye cannot pierce; and is capa∣ble
of regulation only by him who perceives at
one glance the relation of each to all. We are
ignorant of the influence which the present
transactions of our life may have upon those
which are future.</P>
<P>The important question is, not what will
yield to man a few scattered pleasures, but what
will render his life happy on the whole amount.
<PB N="81" REF="95"/>
There is not any present moment that is uncon∣nected
with some future one.—The life of every
man is a continued chain of incidents, each link
of which hangs upon the former. The transi∣tion
from cause to effect, from event to event,
is often carried on by secret steps, which our
foresight cannot divine, and our sagacity in un∣able
to trace. Evil may at some future period
bring forth good; and good may bring forth
evil, both equally unexpected.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>HEALTH.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH good health be one of the greatest
blessings of life, it is thought necessary pru∣dently
to caution women against making a boast
of it, and exhort them to enjoy it in grateful si∣lence.
For men so naturally associate the idea
of female softness and delicacy with a correspon∣dent
delicacy of constitution, that when a wo∣man
speaks of her great strength, her extraordi∣nary
appetite, her ability to bear excessive fa∣tigue,
we recoil at the description in a way she
is little aware of.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="82" REF="96"/>
<HEAD>HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY is a mirror which holds up man∣kind
to their own view: in the circle of
worldly affairs the same characters and situa∣tions
are perpetually returning, and in the fol∣lies
and passions, the vices and crimes of the ge∣nerations
that are past we read those of the
present.</P>
<P>The history of mankind has ever been a con∣tinued
tragedy—the world a great theatre, ex∣habiting
the same repeated scene of the follies of
men shooting forth into guilt, and of their pas∣sions
fermenting by a quick process into misery.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>TRUE VIRTUE AND HONOUR.</HEAD>
<P>MEN possessed of these, value not themselves
upon any regard to inferior obligations,
and yet violate that which is the most sacred
and ancient of all,—religion.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="97"/>
They should consider such violation as a severe
reproach in the most enlightened state of human
nature; and under the purest dispensation of reli∣gion,
it appears to have extinguished the sense
of gratitude to Heaven, and to slight all acknow∣ledgment
of the great and true God. Such con∣duct
implies either an intire want, or a wilful sup∣pression
of some of the best and most generous
affections belonging to human nature.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>HOPE.</HEAD>
<P>HOPE to the soul, when distracted by the con∣fusions
of the world, is as an anchor to a
ship in a dark night, on an unknown coast, and
amidst a boisterous ocean. In danger it gives
security;—amidst general fluctuation it affords
one fixed point of rest.—It is the most eminent
of all the advantages which religion now con∣fers.
—It is the universal comforter;—it is the
spring of all human activity.</P>
<P>Upon futurity, men are constantly suspended;
animated by the prospect of some distant good,
they toil and suffer through the whole course of
<PB N="84" REF="98"/>
life; and it is not so much what they are at
present, as what they hope to be in some after
time; that enlivens their motions, fixes their at∣tention,
and stimulates industry.</P>
<P>Was this hope entertained with that full per∣suasion
which Christian faith demands, it would
in truth totally annihilate all human miseries; it
would banish discontent, extinguish grief, and
suspend the very feeling of pain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>HUMANITY.</HEAD>
<P>GENTLENESS, which belongs to virtue, is
to be carefully distinguished from the mean
spirit of cowards, and the fawning assent o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> syco∣phants.—It
renounces no just right from fear:—it
gives up no important truth from flattery:—it
is indeed not only consistent with a firm mind,
but it necessarily requires a manly spirit and a
fixed principle in order to give it any real value.</P>
<P>It stands opposed to harshness and severity,—to
pride and arrogance,—to violence and oppres∣sion:—it
is, properly, that part of the real vir∣tue
<PB N="85" REF="99"/>
charity, which makes us unwilling to give
pain to any of our brethren.—It corrects what∣ever
is offensive in our manners, and by a con∣stant
train of humane attentions, studies to alle∣viate
the burden of common misery.—Its office
is therefore extensive;—it is continually in action,
when we are engaged in intercourse with men.—It
ought to form our address, to regulate our
speech, and to diffuse itself over our whole be∣haviour.</P>
<P>That gentleness which is characteristic of a
good man, has, like every other virtue, its seat
in the heart.—In that unaffected civility which
springs from a gentle mind, there is a charm in∣finitely
more powerful than in all the studied
manners of the most finished courtier.</P>
<P>It is founded on a sense of what we owe to
him who made us, and to the common nature
of which we all share.—It arises from reflection
on our own failings and wants; and form just
views of the condition and duty of man.—It is
native feeling heightened and improved by prin∣ciple.
It is the heart which easily relents;
which feels for every thing that is human; and
is backward and slow to inflict the least wound.
<PB N="86" REF="100"/>
It is affable in its address, and mild in its de∣meanour;
ever ready to oblige, and be obliged
by others; breathing habitual kindness towards
friends, courtesy to strangers, long suffering to
enemies.</P>
<P>It exercises authority with moderation;—ad∣ministers
reproof with tenderness;—confers fa∣vours
with care and modesty.—It is unassuming
in opinion, and temperate in zeal.—It contends
not eagerly about trifles; slow to contradict,
and still slower to blame; but prompt to allay
dissention and restore peace.—It neither inter∣meddles
unnecessarily with the affairs, nor pries
inquisitively into the secrets of others.—It de∣lights
above all things to alleviate distress; and,
if it cannot dry up the falling tear, to soothe
at least the grieving heart.</P>
<P>Where it has not the power of being useful,
it is never burdensome.—It seeks to please ra∣ther
than shine and dazzle, and conceals with
care that superiority, either of talents or of
rank, which are oppressive to those who are
beneath it. It is the great avenue to mutual en∣joyment:
amidst the strife of interfering inte∣rests,
it tempers the violence of contention, and
<PB N="87" REF="101"/>
keeps alive the seeds of harmony.—It softens
animosities, renews endearments, and renders
the countenance of man a refreshment to man.
It prepoffesses and wins every heart.—It per∣fuades
when every other argument fails; often
disarms the fierce, and melts the stubborn.</P>
<P>To the man of humanity the world is gene∣rally
disposed to ascribe every other good qua∣lity;
of its influence all in some degree partake,
and therefore all love it.</P>
<P>The man of this character rises in the world
without struggle, and flourishes without envy:
his misfortunes are universally lamented, and
his sailings are easily forgiven. The inward
tranquillity which it promotes is the first requi∣site
of every pleasurable feeling. It is the calm
and clear atmosphere, the serenity and sunshine
of the mind.</P>
<P>Attacked by great injuries, the man of mild
and gentle spirit will feel what human nature
feels; and will defend and resent as his duty
allows him: but to slight provocations he is
happily superior.—Inspired with noble senti∣ments,
taught to regard, with indulgent eye,
<PB N="88" REF="102"/>
the frailties of men, the omissions of the care∣less,
the follies of the imprudent, and the levity
of the fickle; he retreats into the calmness of
his spirit, as into an undisturbed sanctuary, and
quietly allows the usual current of life to hold
its course.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>HUMILITY IN COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P>Of all the qualifications for conversation, hu∣mility,
if not the most brilliant, is the safest,
the most amiable, and the most feminine. The
affectation of introducing subjects with which
others are unacquainted, and of displaying ta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nts
superior to the rest of the company, is as
dangerous as it is foolish.</P>
<P>There are many who never can forgive ano∣ther
for being more agreeable and more accom∣plished
than themselves, and who can pardon
any offence rather than an eclipsing merit. The
fable of the nightingale should be ever had in re∣membrance,
as it conveys a most useful lesson
replete with valuable instructions. Had the
silly warbler conquered his vanity, and resisted
<PB N="89" REF="103"/>
the temptation of shewing fine voice, he might
have escaped the talons of the hawk. The me∣lody
of his singing was the cause of his destruc∣tion;
his merit brought him into danger, and his
vanity cost him his life</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>HUMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>HUMOUR, though often mistaken for wit, is
a very different quality. It makes our
company much solicited; but we should be cau∣tious
in indulging it. It is often a great ene∣my
to delicacy, and a still greater one to digni∣ty
of character. It may sometimes gain ap∣plause,
but will never procure respect.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>INDUSTRY.</HEAD>
<P>DILIGENCE, and proper improvement of
time, are material duties of the young.
To no purpose are they endued with the best
abilities, if they want activity for exerting
them.—In youth the habits of industry are most
<PB N="90" REF="104"/>
easily acquired.—In youth the incentives to it
are the strongest; from ambition and from duty,
from emulation and hope, all the prospects
which the beginning of life affords.</P>
<P>Industry is not only the instrument of im∣provement,
but the foundation of pleasure. He
who is a stranger to it may possess, but cannot
enjoy. For it is labour only which gives relish
to pleasure.—It is the appointed vehicle of every
good to man.—It is the indispensible condition
of our possessing a sound mind in a sound body.</P>
<P>We should seek to fill our time with employ∣ments
which may be reviewed with satisfaction.
The acquisition of knowledge is one of the most
honourable occupations of youth. The desire
of it discovers a liberal mind, and is connected
with many accomplishments, and may virtues.
But though our train of life should not lead us
to study, the course of education always fur∣nishes
proper employments to a well-disposed
mind. Whatever we pursue, we should be
emulous to excel.</P>
<P>Generous ambition and sensibility to praise,
are, especially at the youthful period, among
<PB N="91" REF="105"/>
the marks of virtue. We never ought to think
that any affluence of fortune, or any elevation
of rank, exempts us from the duties of applica∣tion
and industry; industry is the law of our
being; it is the demand of nature, of reason,
and of God.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>INTENT OF RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>IF there be any principle fully ascertained by
religion; it is, that this life was intended
for a state of trial and improvement to man.
His preparation for a better world required a
gradual purification, carried on by steps of pro∣gressive
discipline. The situation here assigned him
was such as to answer this design, by calling
forth all his active powers, by giving full scope
to his moral dispositions, and bringing to light
his whole character. Hence it became proper,
that difficulty and temptation should arise in the
course of his duty; ample rewards were pro∣mised
to virtue; but these rewards were left,
as yet, in obscurity and distant prospect.</P>
<P>The impressions of sense were so balanced
against immortality, as to allow a conflict be∣tween
<PB N="92" REF="106"/>
faith and sense,—between conscience and
desire,—between present pleasure and future
good. In this conflict the souls of good men
are tried,—improved and strengthened:—in this
field their honours are reaped;—here are formed
the capital virtues of fortitude, temperance,
and self-denial;—moderation in prosperity, pa∣tience
in adversity, submission to the will of
God, charity and forgiveness to men amidst the
various competitions of worldly interest.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>LOVE OF JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>A SENSE of justice should be the foundation
of all our social qualities. In our most
early intercourse with the world, and even in our
most youthful amusements, no unfairness should
be found. That sacred rule of doing all things
to others, according as we wish they would do
unto us, should be engraved on our minds.
For this end, we should impress ourselves with
a deep sense of the orginal, and natural equa∣lity
of men.</P>
<P>Whatever advantages of birth or fortune we
possess, we ought never to display them with an
<PB N="93" REF="107"/>
ostentatious superiority. We should leave the
subordinations of rank, to regulate the inter∣course
of more advanced years.—In youth it
becomes us to act among our companions, as
man with man. We should remember how un∣known
to us are the vicissitudes of the world;
and how often they, on whom ignorant and
contemptuous young men once looked down
with scorn, have risen to be their superiors in
future years.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SELF-KNOWLEDGE.</HEAD>
<P>TO acquire a thorough knowledge of our∣selves,
is an attainment no less difficult
than important. For men are generally unwil∣ling
to see their own imperfections; and when
they are willing to enquire into them, their
self-love imposes upon their judgment. Their
intercourse with one another assists their delu∣sion,
to which, of themselves, they are prone.</P>
<P>For the ordinary commerce of the world, is
a commerce of flattery and falsehood; where
reciprocality they deceive and are deceived,
<PB N="94" REF="108"/>
where every one appears under an assumed
form, professes esteem, which he does not feel,
and bestows praise in order to receive it.</P>
<P>There are three characters which every man
sustains; and these often extremely different
from one another. One which he possesses is
his own opinion;—another, which he carries in
estimation of the world;—and a third, which he
bears in the judgment of God:—it is only the last
which ascertains what he really is. Whether
the character which the world forms of him,
be above or below truth, it imports not much
to know. But it is of eternal consequence, that
the character which a man possesses in his own
eyes, be formed upon that which he bears in
the sight of God.</P>
<P>He should enquire, after laying aside all par∣tiality
for himself, and exploring the heart with
such accurate scrutiny, as may bring all hidden
defects to light, whether he be not conscious,
that the fair opinion which the world entertains
of him, is founded on their partial knowledge,
both of his abilities and virtues.—He should be
willing that all his actions should be publicly
canvassed.—He should bear to have his thoughts
laid open.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="109"/>
When he has kept from vice, it should be
known whether his innocence proceeded from
purity of principle, or from worldly motives;
—whether any malignity or envy rises within
him, when he compares his own condition with
that of others.—He should enquire whether
he has been as sollicitous to regulate his heart, as
to preserve his manners from reproach;—pro∣fessing
himself a Christian, whether the spirit of
Christ has appeared in his conduct;—declaring
that he hopes for immortality, whether that
hope surmounted undue attachment to the pre∣sent
life.</P>
<P>Such investigation, seriously pursued, may
produce to every man many discoveries of him∣self;
discoveries, not pleasing, perhaps, to va∣nity,
but salutary and useful. For he can only
be a flatterer, but no true friend to himself,
who aims not at knowing his own defects, as
well as virtues.</P>

<HEAD>CHEERFULNESS OF OLD AGE, AND LE∣VITY
OF YOUTH, CONTRASTED.</HEAD>
<P>CHEERFULNESS, in old age, is graceful. It
is the natural concomitant of virtue. But
this is widely different from the levity of youth.
Many things are allowable in that early period,
which, in maturer years, would deserve censure;
but which in old age, become both ridiculous
and criminal.—By awkwardly affecting to imitate
the manners, and to mingle in the vanities of the
young; as the aged depart from the dignity,
so they forfeit the privileges of grey hairs.
But if by follies of this kind they are degraded,
they are exposed to much deeper blame, by
descending to vicious pleasure, and continuing
to hover round those sinful gratifications to
which they were once addicted.</P>
<P>Amusement and relaxation the aged require
and may enjoy: but they should consider well by
every intemperate indulgence they accelerate
decay; instead of enlivening, they oppress and
precipitate their declining state.</P>

<PB N="97" REF="111"/>
<HEAD>PUBLIC LIFE,
ITS INCONVENIENCIES.</HEAD>
<P>HE who lives always in public cannot live to
his own soul. Conversation and inter∣course
with the world is, in several respects, an
education for vice. From earliest youth we are
accustomed to hear riches and honour extolled
as the chief possessions of man, and proposed to
us as the principal aim of our future pursuits.
We are trained up to look with admiration on
the flattering marks of distinction which they
bestow. In quest of those fancied blessings, we
see the multitude around us eager and fervent.
Principles of duty we may, perhaps, hear
sometimes inculcated; but we seldom behold
them brought in competition with worldly
profit.</P>
<P>The soft names and plausible colours under
which deceit, sensuality, and revenge are pre∣sented
to us in common discourse, weaken, by
degrees, our natural sense of the distinction be∣tween
<PB N="98" REF="112"/>
good and evil. We often meet with
crimes authorized by high examples, and re∣warded
with the caresses and smiles of the
world. We discover, perhaps, at last, that
those whom we are taught to reverence and to
regard as our patterns of conduct, act upon
principles no purer than those of others.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is commonly called love amongst the
women, is rather gratitude, and a parti∣ality
to the man who prefers any individual to
the rest of the sex; such a man she often marries
with little of either personal esteem or affection.
Indeed without an unusual share of natural sen∣sibility,
and very peculiar good fortune, a woman
in this country has very little probability of
marrying for love.</P>
<P>For love is not to begin on the part of the fe∣male,
but entirely to be the consequence of a
man's attachment to her. Nature has therefore
as wisely and benevolently assigned to the tender
sex, a greater flexibility of taste on this subject.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="113"/>
Some agreeable qualities recommend a gentle∣man
to common good liking, and friendship.
In the course of acquaintance, he contracts an
attachment. When a woman perceives it, it
excites her gratitude; this rises into preference,
and this preference, perhaps, at last advances to
some degree of attachment, especially if it
meets with crosses and difficulties; for these,
and a state of suspense are very great incite∣ments
to attachment, and are the food of love
in both sexes.</P>
<P>The effects of love among men are diversified
by their different tempers. An artful man may
counterfeit every one of them so, as easily to
impose on a young girl of an open, generous,
and feeling heart, if she is not extremely on her
guard. The finest parts of such a girl may not
always prove suficient for her security. <HI>The
dark and crooked paths of cunning are unsearch∣able,
and inconceivable to an honourable and ele∣vated
mind.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="100" REF="114"/>
<HEAD>ARTFUL SENTIMENTAL LOVER.</HEAD>
<P>THE man versed in the wiles of deceit puts
on the mask of plausibility and virtue, and,
by these means, disarms the object of his atten∣tion
and apparent administration of her pru∣dence,
lays her apprehensions asleep, and in∣volves
her in misery: misery the more inevita∣ble,
because unsuspected. For she who appre∣hends
no danger, will not think it necessary to
be always upon her guard; but will rather in∣vite
than avoid the ruin which comes under so
specious and so fair a form.</P>
<P>One of these sentimental lovers will not scru∣ple
very seriously to assure a credulous girl, that
her unparalelled merit entitles her to the ado∣ration
of the whole world; and that the univer∣sal
homage of mankind is nothing more than
the unavoidable tribute extorted by her charms.</P>
<P>But she sould reflect, that he who endeavours
to intoxicate her with adulation, intends one
day most effectually to humble her. For an art∣ful
<PB N="101" REF="115"/>
man has always a secret design to pay him∣self
in future for any present sacrifice. If he
has address and conduct, and the object of his
pursuit much vanity, and some sensibility, he
seldom fails of success; for so powerful will be
his ascendency over her mind, that she will soon
adopt his notions and opinions.</P>
<P>The lover, deeply versed in all the obliqui∣ties
of fraud, and skilled to wind himself into
every avenue of the heart which indiscretion has
left unguarded, soon discovers on which side it
is most accessible.—He avails himself of this
weakness by addressing her in a language exact∣ly
consonant to her own ideas.—He attacks her
with her own weapons, and opposes, if a senti∣mental
girl, rhapsody to sentiment.—He pro∣fesses
so sovereign a contempt for the paltry
concerns of money, that she thinks it her duty to
reward him for so generous a renunciation.—Every
plea he artfully advances of his own unworthi∣ness,
is considered by her as a fresh demand, that
her gratitude must answer.—And she makes it a
point of honour to sacrifice to him that fortune
which he is too noble to regard.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="116"/>
These professions of humility are the common
artifices of the vain, and these protestations of
generosity the resuge of the rapacious.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>EFFECTS OF HONOURABLE LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN of delicacy ost betrays his passion by
his too great anxiety to conceal it; espe∣cially
if he has little hopes of success. True
love, in all its stages, seeks concealment, and ne∣ver
expects success—It renders a man not only
respectful, but timid, to the highest degree, in
his behaviour to the woman he loves.</P>
<P>To conceal the awe he stands in of her, he
may sometimes affect pleasantry, but it sits awk∣wardly
on him; and he quickly relapses into se∣real
perfections in his imagination, and is either
blind to her failings, or converts them into
beauties.—Like a person conscious of guilt, he
is jealous that every eye observes him; and to
avoid this, he shuns all the little observances of
common gallantry.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="117"/>
His heart and his character will be improved
in every respect by his attachment.—His man∣ners
will become more gentle, and his conver∣sation
more agreeable; but diffidence and em∣barrassment
will always make him appear to
disadvantage in the company of his mistress.
If the fascination continues long, it will depress
his spirit, and extinguish every vigorous and
manly principle of his mind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MALE COQUETRY.</HEAD>
<P>MALE coquetry is much more inexcusable
than female, as well as more pernicious;
but it is rare in this country. Very few men
will give themselves the trouble to gain, or re∣tain
any woman's affections, unless they have
views on them either of an honourable or dis∣honourable
kind.</P>
<P>Men employed in the pursuits of business,
abmbition or pleasure, will not give themselves
the trouble to engage a woman's affections,
merely from the vanity of conquest, and of
<PB N="104" REF="118"/>
triumphing over the heart of an innocent and
defenceless girl.</P>
<P>A man of parts, sentiment, and address, if he
lays aside all regard to truth and humanity,
may engage the heart of fifty women at the
same time; and may likewise conduct his coque∣try
with so much art, as to put it out of the
power of any of them to specify a single expre∣ssion
that could be said to be directly expressive
of love.</P>
<P>This ambiguity of behaviour, <HI>this art of keep∣ing
one in suspense,</HI> is the great surety of coque∣try
of both sexes.—It is the more cruel in men,
because they can carry it what length they please,
and continue it as long as they please, without the
women being so much as at liberty to complain or
expostulate; whereas men can break the chain,
and force women to explain whenever they
become impatient of their situation.</P>
<P>But as a woman in this country may easily
prevent the first impressions of love, every mo∣tive
of prudence and delicacy should make her
guard her heart against them, till such time as
she has received the most convincing proofs of
<PB N="105" REF="119"/>
the attachment of a man of such merit as will
justify a reciprocal regard. She should studious∣ly
labour to possess such high principles of ho∣nour
and generosity, as will render her incapa∣ble
of deceiving, and, at the same time, to possess
that acute discernment which may secure her
against being deceived.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MAN OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>HE pretends that virtue is, at least, a respec∣table
and honoured name, while piety
sounds meanly in his ears—and claims to be a
man of honour.—He rests upon humanity—public
spirit—probity—and truth.—He arro∣gates
to himself all the manly and active vir∣tues:—but
devout affections and religious du∣ties
he treats with contempt, as founded on
shadowy speculation, and fit to employ the at∣tention
only of weak and superstitious minds.—Hence
this neglect of piety argues depravity of
soul—infers and irregular discharge of the duties
of morality, and discovers a cold and hard heart.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="120"/>
He who acts from worldly wisdom lays prin∣ciple
aside, and trust his defence to his art and
ability. He avails himself of every advantage
which his knowledge of the world suggests—he
attends to nothing but what he considers as his
interest; and unconfined by conscience, pursues
it by every course which promises him success.</P>
<P>Persons of this character condemn themselves
to live a most unquiet life;—they pass their days
in perpetual anxiety,—listeningto every mo∣tion,—startled
by every alarm,—changing their
measures on every new occurrence,—and when
distress breaks in over all their defences, they
are left under it hopeless and disconsolate.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MAN'S REAL DEPENDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>MAN should proceed with caution and cir∣cumspection
through a world, where evil
so frequently lurks under the form of good.—
To be humble and modest in opinion,—to be vi∣gilant
and attentive in conduct,—to distrust fair
appearances,—and to restrain rash desires—are
<PB N="107" REF="121"/>
instructions which the darkness of his present
state should strongly inculcate.</P>
<P>God hath appointed his situation to be so am∣biguous
in order both to call forth the exertion
of those intelligent powers which he hath given
him, and to enforce his dependence on his gra∣cious
aid.—Surrounded by so many bewildering
paths, among which the wisest are ready to
stray, he should earnestly implore, and thankful∣ly
receive that divine illumination which is pro∣mised
to the pious and humble.</P>
<P>What must be the fate of him who looks not
up to Heaven for direction, nor properly exerts
the reason which God hath given him?—who
brings neither patience nor attention to the
search of true happiness?—who applies to no
other counsellor than present pleasure, and with
a rash and credulous mind delivers himself up to
every suggestion of desire?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="108" REF="122"/>
<HEAD>DEVOUT MAN.</HEAD>
<P>HIS veneration is not confined to acts of im∣mediate
worship. It is the habitual tem∣per
of his soul. No place and no object appear
to him void of God.—When he surveys this
vast universe, where beauty and goodness are
every where predominant;—when he reflects
on the numberless multitudes of creatures,
who, in their different stations enjoy the bles∣sings
of existence;—and when, at the same time,
he looks up to an universal father, who hath
thus filled creation with life and happiness; his
heart glows within him. He looks forward
to immortality, and discovers the highest subjects
of gratitude.—He views himself as a guilty crea∣ture,
whom divine benignity has received into
grace, whose, forfeited hopes it has restored,
and to whom it has opened the most glorious
prospect of future felicity.—He contemplates
with astonishment the labours of the Son of God,
in accomplishing redemption for men, and his
soul overflows with thankfulness to him.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="123"/>
To inferior enjoyments, he allots inferior and
secondary attachments.—He disclaims not every
earthly affection.—He pretends not to renounce
all pleasure in the comforts of this present state.—Such
an unnatural renunciation humanity for∣bids,
and religion cannot require.—But from
these he expects not supreme bliss—He dis∣cerns
the vanity which belongs to them all;
and beyond the circle of mutable objects, which
surround him, he aspires after some principles
of more perfect felicity, which shall not be su∣bject
to change or decay.</P>
<P>But where is this complete and permanent
good to be found? Ambition pursues it in courts
and palaces, and returns from the pursuit load∣ed
with sorrows.—Pleasure seeks it among
sensual joys, and retires with the confession of
disappointment.</P>
<P>After exploring heaven and earth for hap∣piness,
to the devout man they seem a migh∣ty
void, a wilderness of shadows, where all
would be empty and unsubstantial without God.—<HI>True

<HEAD>MEN AND WOMEN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">HOW DIFFERING IN POINT OF UNDERSTANDING.</HEAD>
<P>WOMEN generally have quicker percep∣tions;
men have juster sentiments.—Wo∣men
consider how things may be prettily said;
men how they may be properly said.—In wo∣men
(young ones at least) speaking accompanies,
and sometimes precedes reflection; in men re∣flection
is the antecedent.</P>
<P>Women speak to shine or please; men to con∣vince
or confute.—women admire what is bril∣liant;
men what is solid.—Women prefer an
extemporaneous sally of wit, or a sparkling ef∣fusion
of fancy, before the most accurate reason∣ing,
or the most laborious investigation of facts.</P>
<P>In literary composition women are pleased
with point, turn, and antithesis; men with ob∣servation,
and a just deduction of effects from
their causes.—Women are found of incidents;
men of agrument.—Women admire passionate∣ly;
<PB N="110" REF="125"/>
men cautiously.—One sex will think it be∣trays
a want of feeling to be moderate in their
applause; the other will be afraid of exposing a
want of judgment by being in raptures with any
thing.—Men refuse to give way to the emo∣tions
they actually feel; while women some∣times
affect to be transported beyond what the
occasion will justify.</P>
<P>The women of this country were not sent in∣to
the world to shun society but embellish it;—they
were not designed for wilds and solitudes,
but for the amiable and endearing offices of so∣cial
life.—They have useful stations to full, and
imporant characters to sustain.—They are of a
religion which does not impose penances, but en∣joins
duties; a religion of perfect purity, but of
perfect benevolence also,—a religion which does
not condemn its followers to indolent seclusion
from the world, but affigns them the more dan∣gerous,
though more honourable province of liv∣ing
uncorrupted in it. In fine, a religion,
which does not direct them to fly from the mul∣titude,
that they may do nothing, but which po∣sitively
forbids them to follow a multitude to do
evil.</P>

<PB N="112" REF="126"/>
<HEAD>MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing which renders a woman
more despicable than her thinking it essen∣tial
to happiness to be married. Besides the
gross indelicacy of the sentiment, it is a false
one, as thousands of women have experienced.
But a married state, if entered into from pro∣per
motives of esteem and affection, is the hap∣piest,
makes women the most respectable in the
eyes of the world, and the most useful members
of society. Care should be taken not to relin∣quish
the ease and independence of a single life,
to become the slaves of a fool, or a tyrant's
caprice.</P>
<P>Love is very seldom produced at first sight;
at least, in that case, it must have a very un∣justifiable
foundation. True love is founded on
esteem, in a correspondence of tastes and senti∣ments,
and steals on the heart imperceptibly.
Therefore, before the affections come to be in
the least engaged to any man, women should
examine their tempers, their tastes, and their
<PB N="113" REF="127"/>
hearts. <HI>very severely;</HI> and settle in their own
minds, what are the requisites to their happi∣ness
in a married state; and, as it is almost im∣possible
that they should get every thing they
wish, they should come to a steady determina∣tion
what they are to confider as essential, and
what may be sacrificed.</P>
<P>Should they have hearts disposed by nature
for love and friendship, and possess those feel∣ings
which enable them to enter into all the re∣finements
and delicacies of these attachments,
matters should be well considered before they
give them any indulgence.</P>
<P>Should they have the misfortune to have such
tempers, and such sentiments deeply rooted in
them; should they have spirit and resolution to
resist the sollicitations of vanity, the persecution
of friends: and can they support the prospect of
the many inconveniences attending the state of
an old maid, then they may indulge themselves
in that kind of sentimental reading and con∣versation,
which is most correspondent to their
feelings.</P>
<P>But if it is found, on a strict self-examination,
that marriage is absolutely essential to their
<PB N="114" REF="128"/>
happiness, the secret should be kept inviolable
in their own bosoms;—but they should shun,
as they would do the most fatal poison, all that
species of reading and conversation, which
warms the imagination, which engages and
softens the heart, and raises the taste above the
leavel of common life. If they do otherwise,
let them consider the terrible conflict of pas∣sions
this may afterwards raise in their breasts.</P>
<P>If this refinement once takes deep root in
their minds, and they do not mean to obey its
dictates, but marry from vulgar and mercenary
views, they may never be able to eradicate it
entirely, and then it will embitter all their mar∣ried
days. Instead of meeting with sense,—ten∣derness,—delicacy,—a
lover,—a friend,—an
equal companion in an husband, they may be
tried with insipidity and dulness;—shocked with
indelicacy;—and mortified by indifference.</P>
<P>To avoid these complicated evils, joined to
others which may arise from the opinion of the
world relative to the infelicity thence arising;
women, who are determined, at all events, to
marry, should have all their reading and amuse∣ments
of such a kind, as do not affect the heart nor
<PB N="115" REF="129"/>
the imagination, except in the way of wit and
humour.</P>
<P>Whatever are a woman's views in marrying,
she should take every possible precaution to pre∣vent
being disappointed. If fortune, and the
pleasure it brings be her aims, the principal se∣curity
she can have for this will depend on her
marrying a good natured, generous man; who
despises money, and who will let her live where
she can best enjoy that pleasure, that pomp, and
parade of life for which she married him.</P>
<P>In order to ensure felicity, it is difficult to
point out in the married state the most effectual
method; nor can we advise whom a woman
should marry, but we may with great confi∣dence
advise whom she should not marry.</P>
<P>A companion that may entail and hereditary
disease on posterity, particularly madness should
be avoided. Such risque is the height of impru∣dence
and highly criminal.</P>
<P>A woman should not marry a fool; he is the
most <HI>intractable</HI> of all animals; he is led by his
passions and caprices, and is incapable of hear∣ing
<PB N="116" REF="130"/>
the voice of reason. Besides it may probably
too hurt a woman's vanity to have an husband,
for whom she has reason to blush and tremble
every time he opens his lips in company.</P>
<P>But the worst circumstance that attends a fool,
in his constant jealousy of his wife's being thought
to govern him. This renders it impossible to
lead him; and he is continually doing absurd
and disagreeable things, for not other reason but
to shew he dare to them.</P>
<P>A rake is always a suspicious husband, be∣cause
he has only known the most worthless of
the sex.</P>
<P>Women, who have a sense or religion, should
not think of husbands who have none. If they
have tolerable understandings, they will be glad
that their wives have religion, for their own
sakes, and for the sake of their familes; but it will
sink them in their esteem.</P>
<P>If they are weak men, they will be continu∣ally
shocking and teasing them about their prin∣ciples.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="131"/>
A sudden sally of passion should never be given
way to, and dignified with the name of love.—
Genuine love is not founded on caprice; it is
founded in nature, or honourable views;—on
virtue—on similiarity of tastes—and sympathy
of souls.</P>
<P>In point of fortune, which is necessary to the
happiness of both, a competency is requisite.
But what that competency may be, can only be
determined by their own tastes. If they have
enough between them, as will satisfy all de∣mands,
it is sufficient.</P>
<P>Marriage will at once dispel the enchantment
raised by external beauty; but the virtues and
graces that first warmed the heart, that reserve,
and delicacy which always left the lover some∣thing
further to wish, and often made him
doubtful of his mistress's sensibility and attach∣ment,
may and ought ever to remain.</P>
<P>The tumult of passion will naturally subside;
but it will be succeeded by an endearment that
affects the heart in a more equal, more sensible,
and more tender manner.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="118" REF="132"/>
<HEAD>TRUE MEEKNESS.</HEAD>
<P>MEEKNESS, like most other virtues, has
certain limits, which is no sooner exceeds
than it becomes criminal. She who hears in∣nocence
maligned without vindicating it,—false∣hood
asserted without contradicting it,—or reli∣gion
profaned without resenting it, is not gentle,
but wicked.</P>
<P>Meekness is imperfect, if it be not both
active and passive; if it will not enable us to
subdue our own passions and resentments, as
well as qualify us to bear patiently the passions
and resentments of others. If it were only for
mere human reasons, it would turn to a profi∣table
account to be patient; nothing defeats the
malice of an enemy like the spirit of forbear∣ance;
the return of rage for rage cannot be so
effectually provoking.</P>
<P>True gentleness, like an impenetrable ar∣mour,
repels the most pointed shafts of malice:
they cannot pierce through this vulnerable shield,
<PB N="119" REF="133"/>
but either fall hurtless to the ground, or return
to wound the hand that shot them.</P>
<P>A meek spirit will not look out of itself for
happiness, because it finds a constant banquet at
home; yet, by a sort of divine alchymy, it
will convert all external events to its own pro∣fit;
and be able to deduce some good, even from
the most unpromising, it will extract comfort
and satisfaction, from the most barren, circum∣stances;
“It will suck honey out of the rock,
and oil out of the flinty rock.”</P>
<P>Meekness may be called the pioner of all the
other virtues, which levels every obstruction;
and smooths every difficulty that might impede
their entrance, or retard their progress.—Ho∣nours
and dignities are transient;—beauty and
riches frail and fugacious;—but this amiable vir∣tue
is permanent. And surely the truly wise
would wish to have some one profession, which
they might call their own in the severest exi∣gencies.
This can only be accomplished by ac∣quiring

<HEAD>MIDDLE AGE.</HEAD>
<P>AS we advance from youth to middle age,
a new field of action opens, and a different
character is required.—The flow of gay and
impetuous spirits begins to subside.—Life gra∣dually
assumes a graver cost; the mind a more
sedate and thoughtful turn.—The attention is
now transferred from pleasure to interest; that
is, to pleasure, diffussed over a wider extent,
and measured by a larger scale.</P>
<P>Formerly, the enjoyment of the present mo∣ment
occupied the whole attention. Now, no
action terminates alternately in itself, but refers
to some more distant aim.—Wealth and power,
the instruments of lasting gratification, are now
coveted more than any single pleasure;—pru∣dence
and foresight lay their plan;—industry
carries on its patient efforts;—activity pushes
forward;—address winds around;—here, an
enemy is to be overcome;—there, a rival to be
displaced;—competitions warm;—and the strife
the world thickens on every side.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="121" REF="135"/>
<HEAD>THE UNION OF PIETY AND MORALITY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS forms the consistent, the graceful, the
respectable character of the real christian,
the man of true worth. Either of them left
out, one side of the character is only fair; the
other side will be always open to much reproach.
Hence we dishonour ourselves, and do great in∣justice
to religion: as by division it is exposed to
the censure of the world.</P>
<P>The unbeliever will scoff at such piety, where
he sees neglect of moral duties. The bigot
will decry all morality, where he sees a pre∣tence
of virtue, though a contempt of God.
Whereas he who fears God, and is at the same
time just and beneficent to men, exhibits reli∣gion
to the world with full propriety.—His cha∣racter
is above reproach.—It is at once amiable
and venerable.—Malice itself is afraid to at∣tack
him; and even the worst men respect
and honour him in their hearts. He who fails
materially either in piety, or virtue, is always ob∣noxious
to the anguish or remorse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="122" REF="136"/>
<HEAD>NEGLECT OF RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE Religion is neglected there can be
no regular or steady practice of the duties
of morality. The character will be often incon∣sistent;
and virtue, placed on a basis too narrow
to support it, will be always loose and tottering.
For such is the propensity of our nature to vice,
so numerous are the temptations to a relaxed and
immoral conduct, that stronger restraints than
those of mere reason, are necessary to be impo∣sed
of man.</P>
<P>The sense of right and wrong, the principle
of honour, or the instinct of benevolence, are
barriers too feeble to withstand the strength of
passion. For the heart wounded by sore distress,
or agitated by violent emotions, soon discovers;
that virtue without religion is inadequate to the
government of life. It is destitute of its proper
guard—of its firmest support—of its chief en∣couragement.—It
will sink under the weight
of misfortune,—or will yield to the solicitations
of guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="137"/>
Humanity seconded by piety renders the
spring from whence it flows of course more re∣gular
and constant. In short, withdraw reli∣gion
and you shake all the pillars of morality.
In every heart you weaken the influence of vir∣tue:
and among the multitude, the bulk of man∣kind,
you overthrow its power.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>OLD MAID.</HEAD>
<P>IT is to be lamented that so universal a stigma
should fall upon that state, called antiquated
virginity; and that those whose <HI>unhappy</HI> lot it is
should experience such general derision. It is a
mistaken notion, though, to conclude that it al∣ways
arises in consequence of the situation of
such individuals; it often originates from their
own peculiar conduct.</P>
<P>Being unable to bear with becoming fortitude
their forlorn and unprotected allotment in life,
chagrin and peevishness are apt to infect their
tempers; and they too severely feel the great
difficulty of making a transition with dignity,
<PB N="124" REF="138"/>
and cheerfulness, from the period of youth,
beauty, admiration, and respect, into the calm,
silent, unnoticed retreat of declining years.</P>
<P>For we see some unmarried women of active
vigorous minds and great vivacity of spirits de∣grading
themselves; sometimes by entering into
a dissipated course of life, unsuitable to their
years, and exposing themselves to the ridicule of
girls, who might have been their grand chil∣dren;—sometimes
by oppressing their acquaint∣ances
by impertinent intrusions into their pri∣vate
affairs;—and sometimes by being the pro∣pagators
of scandal and defamation.</P>
<P>All this is owing to an exuberant activity of
spirit; which, if it had found employment at
home, would have rendered them respectable
and useful members of society.</P>
<P>We see other women, in the same situation,
gentle, modest, blest with sense, taste, delicacy,
and every milder feminine virtue of the heart,
but of weak spirits, bashful and timid. Them
we see sinking into obscurity and insignificance,
and gradually losing every elegant accomplish∣ment;
for this evident reason, that they are
not united to a partner who has sense and worth,
<PB N="125" REF="139"/>
and taste to know their value;—one who is able
to draw forth their concealed qualities, and shew
them to advantage;—who can give that support
to their feeble spirits which they stand so much
in need of,—and who, by his affection and tender∣ness,
might make such a woman happy in exert∣ing
every talent, and accomplishing herself in
every elegant art that could contribute to his
amusement.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>OLD AGE.</HEAD>
<P>OLD Age is a stage of the human course,
which every one hopes to reach; it is a pe∣riod
justly entitled to general respect. Even
its failings ought to be touched with a gentle
hand. For though in every part of life vexa∣tions
occur; yet, in former years, either busi∣ness,
or pleasure, served to obliterate their im∣pression,
by supplying occupation to the mind.</P>
<P>Old age begins its advances by disqualifying
men either from relishing the one, or for taking
an active part in the other; while it withdraws
their accustomed supports, it imposes, at the same
<PB N="126" REF="140"/>
time, the additional burden of growing infirmi∣ties.</P>
<P>In the former stages of their journey, hope
continued to flatter them with many a fair and
enticing prospect; but as old age increases
these illusions vanish.—Life is contracted within
a narrow and barren circle.—Year after year
steals somewhat away from their store of com∣fort,—deprives
them of some of their antient
friends,—blunts some of their powers of sensa∣tion,—and
incapacitates them for some function
of life.</P>
<P>The querulous temper, to them imputed, is to
be considered as a natural infirmity rather than
a vice: the same apology cannot be made for
that peevish disgust at the manners, and that
malignant censure of the enjoyments, of the
young, which is sometimes found to accompany
declining years.</P>
<P>It is too common to find the aged at declared
enmity with the whole system of present cus∣toms
and manners; perpetually complaining of
the growing depravity of the world, and of the
astonishing vices and follies of the rising genera∣tion.
<PB N="127" REF="141"/>
All things, according to them, are rushing
fast into ruin. Decency and good order have
become extinct; ever since that happy discipline,
under which they spent their youth, has passed
away.</P>
<P>Former follies vanish, and are forgotten.
Those which are present, strike observation and
sharpen censure. Had the depravation of the
world continued to increase in proportion to
those gloomy calculations, which, so many cen∣turies
past, have estimated each race as worse
than the preceding; by this time, not one ray
of good sense, nor one spark of piety and virtue,
must have remained unextinguished among man∣kind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>PASSIONATE WOMAN.</HEAD>
<P>A PASSIONATE woman's happiness is never
in her own keeping;—it is the sport of ac∣cident
and the slave of events.—It is in the
power of her acquaintance,—her servants,—but
chiefly her enemies;—and all her comforts lie at
the mercy of others. So far from being willing
<PB N="128" REF="142"/>
to learn of him who was meek and lowly,
she considers meekness as the want of a becom∣ing
spirit, and lowliness as a despicable and vul∣gar
meanness.</P>
<P>An imperious woman will so little covet the
ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, that it is
the only ornament she will not be sollicitous to
wear. But resentment is a very expensive vice.
How dearly has it cost its votaries, even from
the sin of Cain, the first offender of this kind?
“It is cheaper (says a pious writer) to forgive
and save the charges.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPEARANCES OF PIETY.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are often substituted in the place of
the great duties of humanity and mercy.—Too
many flatter themselves with the hope of
obtaining the friendship of their Creator, though
they neglect to do justice to their fellow-crea∣tures.</P>
<P>But supposed piety is an invention of their
own, unknown to reason—unknown in the word
<PB N="129" REF="143"/>
of God.—For piety is a principle which regene∣rates
the heart, and forms it to goodness.—If
therefore, while piety seems ardent, morality
shall decline; or if ever the regard to it should
totally fail—if, whilst making prayers, no alms
are given—if, whilst we appear zealous for God,
we are false or unjust to men—if we are hard
or contracted in heart, severe in our censures,
and oppressive in our conduct, then conclude
what we have termed piety, was no more than
an empty name, resolving itself either into an
hypocritical form of godliness—a transient im∣pression
of seriousness—an accidental melting of
the heart—or the deliberate refuge of a deluded
and superstitious, but, at the same time, a cor∣rupted
mind. For all men, even the most de∣praved,
are subject, more or less, to compunc∣tions
of conscience.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MEN OF TRUE PLEASURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE seat of enjoyment is the soul.—None but
the temperate, the regular, and the vir∣tuous
know how to enjoy prosperity.—They
bring to its comforts the manly relish of a sound
<PB N="130" REF="144"/>
uncorrupted mind.—They stop at the proper
point before enjoyment degenerates into disgust,
and pleasure is converted into pain.—They are
strangers from those complaints which flow from
spleen, caprice, and all the fantastical distresses of
a vitiated mind.—Purity and virtue heighten
all the powers of human fruition▪—Moderate
and simple pleasures relish high with the tempe∣rate.</P>
<P>Innocence confers ease and freedom on the
mind; leaves it open to every pleasing sensa∣tion;
gives a lightness to the spirits, similar to
the native gaiety of youth and health;—for
prosperity is redoubled to a good man by his
generous use of it; it is reflected back upon him
from every one whom he makes happy.</P>
<P>In the intercourse of domestic affection,—in
the attachment of friends,—the gratitude of de∣pendents,—the
esteem and good will of all who
know him,—he sees blessings multiplied around
him on every side; like a tree in the midst of
an inhabited country, affording to some friendly
shelter; to others fruit, which is not only ad∣mired
by all for its beauty, but blessed by the
traveller for the shade, and by the hungry for
the sustenance it has given.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="131" REF="145"/>
<HEAD>MAN OF PLEASURE.</HEAD>
<P>TO a man of pleasure every moment appears to
be lost, which partakes not of the vivacity of
amusement.—To connect one plan of gaiety with
another is his sole study, till in a very short time
nothing remains but to tread the same bea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a
round,—to enjoy what they have already enjoy∣ed,—and
to see what they have often seen.</P>
<P>Pleasures thus drawn to the dregs become va∣pid
and tasteless. What might have pleased
long, if enjoyed with temperance and mingled
with retirement, being devoured with such eager
haste, speedily surfeits and disgusts. Hence,
having run through a rapid course of pleasure,
after having glittered for a few years in the fore∣most
line of public amusements, such men are
the most apt to fly at last to a melancholy re∣treat;
not led by religion or reason, but driven
by disappointed hopes and exhausted spirits to
the pensive conclusion, <HI>that all is vanity.</HI></P>

<DIV2>
<PB N="132" REF="146"/>
<HEAD>PLEASURE, SENSUAL AND SPIRITUAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE refined pleasures of a pious mind, are,
in many respects, superior to the coarse
gratifications of sense;—they are pleasures
which belong to the highest powers and best af∣fections
of the soul; whereas the gratifications
of sense reside in the lowest region of our na∣ture.
To the one the soul stoops below its na∣tive
dignity; the other raises it above itself.—The
one leaves always a comfortless, often a
mortifying remembrance behind it; the other
ir reviewed with applause and delight.—The
pleasures of some resemble a foaming torrent;
which, after a disorderly course, speedily runs
out, and leaves an empty and offensive channel:
but the pleasures of devotion resemble the
equable current of a pure river, which enlivens
the fields through which it passes, and diffuses
verdure and fertility along its banks.</P>

<PB N="133" REF="147"/>
<HEAD>PLEASURES OF OLD AGE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH, in old age, the circle of pleasure
is contracted, yet within its limits, many of
those enjoyments remain which are most grate∣ful
to human nature.</P>
<P>Temperate mirth is not extinguished by ad∣vanced
years;—the mild pleasures of domestic
life still cheer the heart.—The entertainments
of conversation and social intercourse continue
unimpaired.—The desire of knowledge is not
abated by the frailty of the body, and the lei∣sure
of old age affords many opportunities for
gratifying that desire.—The sphere of observa∣tion
and reflection is not so much enlarged by
long acquaintance with the world, as to supply,
within itself, a wide range of improving thought:
whilst the aged are engaged in such employ∣ments
as best suit the infirmities of their nature,
they are surrounded, perhaps, with families,
who treat them with attention and respect;
they are honoured by their friends; their cha∣racters
are established, and are placed beyond
<PB N="134" REF="148"/>
the reach of clamour and the strife of tongues;
and, free from distracting cares, can calmly at∣tend
to their eternal interests.</P>
<P>No age is doomed to total infelicity, provid∣ed
that we attempt not to do violence to na∣ture,
by seeking to extort from one age the plea∣sures
of another, and to gather in the winter of
life those flowers which were destined to blossom
only in its summer or its spring.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>PRESUMPTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE constant concomitant of presumption is
self-conceit and obstinacy; and of all the
follies incident to youth particularly, there are
none which either deform its present appear∣ance,
or blast the prospect of its future prospe∣rity
more than these. By checking its natural
progress in improvement, they fix it in long
immaturity, and frequently produce mischiefs,
which can never be repaired.</P>
<P>These are the vices too commonly found
among the young.—Big with enterprise, and
<PB N="135" REF="149"/>
elated by hope, they resolve to trust for success
to none but themselves.—Full of their own abi∣lities,
they deride the admonitions which are
given them by their friends, as the timorous sug∣gestions
of age.—Too wise to learn,—too im∣patient
to deliberate,—too forward to be re∣strained,
they plunge with precipitate indiscre∣tion
into the midst of all the dangers with
which life abounds.—Positive in opinion, and
confident in their assertions, as they are at this
period, the time will arrive when both men and
things will appear in a different light. Many
characters now admired, will sink, by and by,
in esteem;—and many opinions of which they
are at present most tenacious, will alter as they
advance in years.</P>
<P>The glare of youthful presumption which
dazzles our eyes should always be distrusted;
we should not abound in our own sense, nor
put ourselves forward with too much eagerness;
nor imagine that by the impetuosity of juvenile
ardour, systems can be overturned which have
been long established, or that the face of the
world can be changed; but by patient and gra∣dual
progression in improvement, we may in due
time command lasting esteem. But by assuming,
<PB N="136" REF="150"/>
at present, a tone of superiority to which we
have no title, we shall disgust those whose ap∣probation
it is most important to gain. For∣ward
vivacity may fit us to be the companions
of an idle hour. More solid qualities must re∣commend
us to the wise, and mark us out for
importance and consideration in subsequent life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>DISSAPPOINTED PRIDE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a man's sufferings arises from the
bad dispositions of his own heart; when
in the height of prosperity he is rendered mise∣rable
solely by disappointed pride, every ordi∣nary
motive for communication ceases. The
violence of anguish drives him to confess a pas∣sion
which renders him odious, and a weakness
which renders him despicable.</P>
<P>In the eye of his family, every man wishes to
appear respectable, and to cover from their
knowledge whatever may vilify, or degrade
him. Attacked or reproached abroad, he con∣soles
himself with his importance at home; and
in domestic attachment and respect, seeks for
<PB N="137" REF="151"/>
some compensation for the injustice of the world.
But the torments this folly occasions forces him
to break through all restraints, and publish his
shame before those from whom all men seek
most to hide it.</P>
<P>All the evils which poverty, disease, or vio∣lence
can conflict, and their stings will be found
by far less pungent than those which such guilty
passions dart into the heart. But those disorders,
by seizing directly on the mind, attack human
nature in its strong hold, and cut off its last re∣source.
They penetrate to the very seat of
sensation, and convert all the powers of thought
into instruments of torture.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE AND SENTIMENT
CONTRASTED.</HEAD>
<P>SENTIMENT and principle are often mistaken
for each other; though in fact they widely
differ.—Sentiment is the virtue of ideas, and
principle the virtue of action.—Sentiment has
its seat in the head; principle in the heart.—
Sentiment suggests fine harrangues, and subtle
<PB N="138" REF="152"/>
distinctions; principle conceives just notions,
and performs good actions in consequence of
them.—Sentiment refines away the simplicity
of truth, and the plainness of piety; and, as
Voltaire, that celebrated wit, has remarked of
his no less celebrated cotemporary Rousseau,
“gives us virtue in words and vice in deeds”—
Sentiment may be called the Athenian who
<HI>knew</HI> what was right; and principle the Lace-demonian
who <HI>practised</HI> it.</P>
<P>These qualities may be exemplified from con∣sidering
two characters beautifully drawn by the
admirable pen of Milton.—Belial, who may be
called, and not improperly, the Demon of senti∣ment;
and Abdiel, the Angel of principle.</P>

For dignity composed, and high exploit,

<HEAD>PROSPERITY.</HEAD>
<P>A SINGLE disappointment is sufficient to em∣bitter
all the pleasures of worldly prospe∣rity.
Though it might be expected, one in pos∣session
of high power and station should disre∣gard
slight injuries. But prosperity debilitates
instead of strengthening the mind.—Its common
effect is, to create an extreme sensibility to the
slightest wound.—It foments impatient desires;
and raises expectations which no success can sa∣tisfy.
—It fosters a false delicacy, which sickens
<PB N="140" REF="154"/>
in the midst of indulgence;—by repeated grati∣fication,
it blunts the feelings of men to what is
pleasing; and leaves them unhappily acute to
whatever is uneasy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>NECESSITY OF PRUDENCE IN EVERY
STAGE OF LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>AT the first setting out in life, especially
when yet unacquainted with the world
and its snares, when every pleasure enchants
with its smile, and every object shines with the
gloss of novelty, youth should beware of the
seducing appearances which surround them;
and recollect what others have suffered from
the power of head-strong desire. If any passion
be allowed, even though it should be esteemed
innocent, to acquire an absolute ascendant, their
inward peace will be impaired. But if any,
which has the taint of guilt, they may date
from that moment the ruin of their tranquility.</P>
<P>Nor with the season of youth does the peril
end. To the impetuosity of youthful desire,
succeed the more sober, but no less dangerous
<PB N="141" REF="155"/>
attachments of advancing years; when that pas∣sions
which are connected with interest and am∣bition
begin their reign, and too frequently
extend their influence, even over those periods
of life which ought to be the most tranquil.</P>
<P>From the first to the last of man's abode on
earth, the discipline must never be relaxed of
guarding the heart form the dominion of pas∣sion.
Eager passions and violent desires were
not made for man.—They exceed his shpere.
—They find no adequate object on earth;—
and, of course, can be productive of nothing
but misery.</P>
<P>The certain consequence of indulging them,
is, that there shall come an evil day, when the
anguish of disappointment shall acknowledge
that all which we enjoy availeth us nothing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>REDEMPTION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is one of the most glorious works of
the Almighty—illustrious is the hour of
the restoration of the world—the hour when
<PB N="142" REF="156"/>
from condemnation and misery, it emerged
into happiness and peace.</P>
<P>In this hour, the long series of prophecies,
visions, types, and figures was accomplished.
This was the center in which they all met;—this
the point to which they tended and verged,
throughout the course of so many generations.
—We behold the law and the prophets standing
at the foot of the cross and doing homage.—We
behold Moses and Aaron bearing the ark of the
covenant; David and Elijah presenting the ora∣cle
of testimony;—we behold all the priests and
sacrifices,—all the rites and ordinances,—all the
types and symbols, assembled together to receive
their consummation.—In this hour every rite as∣sumed
its significancy;—every prediction met
its event;—every symbol displayed its corre∣spondence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>REFORMATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE rage for reformation commonly shews
itself in a violent zeal for suppressing what
is wrong, rather than in a prudent attention
to establish what is right; but we shall never
<PB N="143" REF="157"/>
obtain a fair garden merely by rooting up weeds;
we must also plant flowers: for the natural
richness of the soil we have been clearing will
not suffer it to lie barren, but whether it shall be
vainly or benficially prolific, depends on the
culture.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>THE spirit of true religion breathes gentle∣ness
and affability.—It gives a native unaf∣fected
ease to the behaviour. It is social, kind,
and cheerful;—far removed from that gloomy
and illiberal superstition which, clouds the brow,
sharpens the temper, dejects the spirit, and
teaches men to fit themselves for another world,
by neglecting the concerns of this.</P>
<P>On the contrary, religion connects our pre∣paration
for Heaven, with an honourable dis∣charge
of the duties of active life.—It is asso∣ciated
in the imagination with all that is lovely
and useful,—with whatsoever things are true,
are just, are pure, are lovely, are of good
report,—wherever there is any virtue,—and
wherever there is any praise.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="158"/>
Religion is rather a matter of sentiment than
reasoning. The important and interesting arti∣cles
of faith, are sufficiently plain. Our atten∣tion
should be fixed on these, and not suffered
to meddle with controversy. For there we are
plunged into a chaos, from which we never
shall be able to extricate ourselves. It spoils
the temper, and has no good effect on the heart.</P>
<P>All books, and all conversation that tend to
shake our faith, on those great points of religion
which should serve to regulate our conduct, and
on which our hopes of future and eternal happi∣ness
depend, should be avoided.</P>
<P>We should never indulge ourselves in ridi∣cule
on religious subjects, nor give countenance
to it in others, by seeming diverted with what
they say. This, to people of good breeding,
will be a sufficient check. It is not necessary to
go further than scripture for our religious opi∣nions.</P>
<P>We should embrace those we find clearly re∣vealed,
and never perplex ourselves about such
as we do not understand, but treat them with
silent and becoming reverence.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGIOUS REFLECTION.</HEAD>
<P>IF there be any impression which man is form∣ed
by nature to receive, it is religion.—As
soon as his mind opens to observation he dis∣cerns
innumerable marks of his dependent
state;—he finds himself placed, by some supe∣rior
power, in a vast world, where the wisdom
and goodness of the Creator are conspicuous on
every side.</P>
<P>The magnificence, the beauty, the order of
nature, excite him to admire and adore. When
he looks up to the omnipotent hand which ope∣rates
throughout the universe, he is impressed
with reverence!—when he receives blessings
which he cannot avoid ascribing to divine good∣ness
he is prompted to gratitude.</P>
<P>Tribes of men, without policy, or laws, or
cities, or any of the arts of life are discovered;
but no where without some form of religion.
In every region we behold the prostrate worship∣er,
the temple, the altar, and the offering.</P>

<DIV2>
<PB N="146" REF="160"/>
<HEAD>RESIGNATION.</HEAD>
<P>IGNORANCE of good or evil should determine
man to follow providence, and resign him∣self
to God. Resignation to his maker is one of
the most important lessons which can be given
to man. He knows not what is good for him∣self
in the future periods of life; but God per∣fectly
knows it; and if he faithfully serves him,
he has reason to believe that God will always
consult it. Before him lies the whole succession
of events, which are to fill up man's existence.
It is in his power to arrange, and model them
at his pleasure.</P>
<P>Amidst the agitations of desire, and the per∣plexities
of doubt, there is one fixed point of
rest. By this let man abide; and dismiss his
anxiety about things uncertain and unknown.
He should acquire an interest in divine favour;
and he may safely surrender himself to the di∣vine
administration. When tempted to repine
at his condition he should reflect whether he
would have been happier in any other station.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="161"/>
He should not be too particular in his petitions
to heaven concerning his temporal interest, but
suffer God to govern the world according to his
own plan; and only pray, thathe would bestow
what his unerring wisdom fees to be best for
him. On the whole he should follow wherever
his providence leads; comply with whatever
he requires, and leave all the rest to him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>RIDICULE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fatal fondness for indulging a spirit of ri∣dicule,
and the injurious and irreparable con∣sequences
which sometimes attend the too severe
reply, can never be condemned with more asperity
than it deserves. Not to offend is the first step
towards pleasing. To give pain is as much an
offence against humanity as against good breed∣ing;
and surely it is as well to abstain from an
action because it is sinful, as because it is im∣polite.</P>
<P>A man of sense and breeding will sometimes
join in the laugh, which has been raised at his
<PB N="148" REF="162"/>
expense by an ill-natured repartee; but if it was
very cutting, and one of those shocking sorts of
truths, which as they scarcely can be pardoned
even in private, ought never to be uttered in pub∣lic.
He does not laugh because he is pleased,
but because he wishes to conceal how much he is
hurt; and will remember it, as a treat of malice,
when the whole company should have forgotten
it as a stroke of ridicule.—Even women are so
far from being privileged by their sex to say un∣handsome
or cruel things, that it is this very
circumstance which renders them intolerable.
When the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is no
relief to him who is wounded to reflect, that
the hand which shot it was a fair one.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SELF COMMUNION</HEAD>
<P>AS recommended by men of virtue and true
piety, is religious recollection. It is to
commune with ourselves, under the character
of spiritual and immortal beings; and to ponder
those paths of our feet which are leading us to
eternity.—It is to bring home to our souls the
internal, authorative sense of God, as of a sove∣reign
<PB N="149" REF="163"/>
and a father; to contemplate what is dis∣played
of his perfections.—It is to realize the
presence of the supreme Being, so as to produce
the most profound veneration,—and to awaken
the earnest desire of as near an approach, as our
nature will permit, to that great fountain of hap∣piness
and life.</P>
<P>By this the pious man walks among the vari∣ous
scenes of nature as within, the precincts of a
great temple, in the habitual exercise of devo∣tion.
And from hence, when his thoughts have
been thus employed, he returns to the world like
a superior being. He carries into active life,
those pure and elevating sentiments, to which
the giddy crowd are strangers. A certain odour
of sanctity remains upon his mind, which, for
awhile at least, will repel the contagion of the
world.</P>
<P>As he views the world with the eye of a chris∣tian
he will see, that however men appear to move
and act after their own pleasure, they are never∣theless
retained in secret bonds by the Almighty;
and all their operations rendered subservient to
the ends of his moral government.—He will be∣hold
him punishing the sinner by means of his own
<PB N="150" REF="164"/>
iniquities; from the trials of the righteous bring∣ing
forth their reward; and to a state of seeming
universal confusion preparing the wisest and
most equitable Issue.—While the fashion of this
world is passed fast away, he will discern the
glory of another arising fast to succeed it.—He
will behold all human events; our grief and our
joys,—our love and hatred,—our character and
our memory, absorbed in the ocean of eternity;
and no traces of our present existence left, ex∣cept
its being for ever well with the righteous,
and ill with the wicked.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SILENCE.</HEAD>
<P>SILENCE is one of the great arts of conversa∣tion,
as allowed by Cicero himself, who says,
“there is not only an art but an eloquence in it,”
and this opinion is confirmed by a great modern,
Lord Bacon. For a well-bred woman may easily
and effectually promote the most useful and ele∣gant
conversation, without speaking a word.
The modes of speech are scarcely more variable
than the modes of silence.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="165"/>
The silence of listless ignorance, and the si∣lence
of sparkling intelligence, are perhaps as
seperately marked, and as distinctly expressed,
as the same feelings could have been by the most
unequivocal language. A woman, in a company
where she has the least influence, may promote
any subject by a profound and invariable atten∣tion;
which shews that she is pleased with it;
and by an illuminated countenance, which proves
she understands it.</P>
<P>Attention is the most flattering encourage∣ment
in the world to men of sense and letters,
to continue any topic of instruction, or enter∣tainment,
they happen to be engaged in. It
owed its introduction perhaps to accident, the
best introduction for a subject of ingenuity,
which, though it could not have been formally
proposed without pedantry, may be continued
with ease and good-humour; but which will be
frequently and effectually stopped by the listless∣ness,
inattention, or whispering of silly girls;
whose weakness betrays their ignorance, and
whose impatience exposes their ill-breeding.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="152" REF="166"/>
<HEAD>SINCERITY.</HEAD>
<P>SINCERITY is the basis of every virtue. The
love of truth, as we value the approba∣tion
of heaven, or the esteem of the world,
should be cultivated.—In all our proceedings it
will make us direct and consistent.—Ingenuity
and candour possess the most powerful charm;
they bespeak universal favour, and carry an
apology for almost every failing.</P>
<P>The path of truth is a plain and safe path.—It
supplies us with an openess of character which
displays a generous boldness, necessary to dis∣tinguish
youth.—To give an early prefer∣ence
honour above gain when they stand in
competition;—to despise every advantage, which
cannot be attained without dishonest arts;—to
brook no meanness,—and stoop to no dissimula∣tion,
are the indications of a great mind, the
presages of future eminence and distinction in
life.</P>
<P>At the same time, this virtuous sincerity is
perfectly consistent with the most prudent vigi∣lance
<PB N="153" REF="167"/>
and caution.—It is opposed to cunning,
not to true wisdom.—It is not the simplicity of
the weak and improvident, but the candour of
an enlarged and noble mind; of one who scorns
deceit, because he accounts it both base and un∣profitable;
and who seeks no disguise, because
he needs none to hide him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SLOTH.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is so opposite to the true enjoy∣ment
of life, as the relaxed and feeble
state of an indolent mind. Sloth is so incon∣sistent
with both soundness of mind and body,
that it is harder to determine whether it be a
greater foe to virtue, or to health and happiness.
—Inactive as it is in itself, its effects are fatally
powerful.—Though it appear a slowly flowing
stream, yet it undermines all that is stable and
flourishing.—It not only saps the foundation of
every virtue, but pours upon us a deluge of
crimes and evils.—It is like water, which first
putrifies by stagnation; and then sends up noxi∣ous,
vapors, and fills the atmosphere with death.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="168"/>
Idleness is the certain parent both of guilt and
ruin which should be avoided.—Under this are
included, not mere inaction only, but all that
circle of trifling occupations, in which too many
saunter away their youth; perpetually engaged
in frivolous society, or public amusements;—in
the labour of dress, or the o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tentation of their
persons.</P>
<P>Amusements, youth requires. It were vain—it
were cruel, to prohibit them. But, though
allowable as the relaxation, they are most cul∣pable
as the business of the young. For they
then become the gulph of time, and the poison
of the mind.—They foment bad passions—they
weaken the manly powers—they sink the na∣tive
vigour of youth into contemptible effemi∣nacy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SOBRIETY OF MIND,
ITS NECESSITY.</HEAD>
<P>SOBRIETY of mind is one of those virtues,
which the present condition of human life
strongly inculcates. The uncertainty of its en∣joyments,
<PB N="155" REF="169"/>
checks presumption; the multiplicity
of its dangers, demands perpetual caution.</P>
<P>Moderation,—vigilance,—and self-govern∣ment,
are duties incumbent on all; but especially
on such as are beginning the journey of life. For
the whole state of youthful views, and passions,
is adverse to sobriety of mind.—The scenes
which present themselves at our entering upon
the world, are commonly fiattering.—Whatever
they be in themselves, the lively spirits of the
young gild every opening prospect.—The field
of hope appears to stretch wide before them.
Pleasure seems to put forth its blossoms on every
side.—Impelled by desire, forward they rush
with inconsiderate ardour:—prompt to decide
and to chase;—averse to hesitate or to enquire;—credulous,
because untaught by experience;—
rash, because unacquainted with danger;—head∣strong,
because unsubdued by disappointment.</P>
<P>In human actions there is a right and wrong.
—Those who are born with the same advan∣tages
of fortune, are not all equally prosperous
in the course of life.—Some of them, by wise
and steady conduct, attain distinction in the
world, and pass their days with comfort and
<PB N="156" REF="170"/>
honour;—others, of the same rank, by mean
and. vicious behaviour, forfeit the advantages
of their birth,—involve themselves in much mi∣sery,—and
end in being a disgrace to their
friends, and a burden on society. Early, then,
we may learn, that it is not on the external
condition in which we find ourselves placed;
but on that part on which we are to act, that
our welfare or unhappiness, our honour or in∣famy
depend.</P>
<P>When beginning to act that part, it is of the
greatest moment to regulate our plan of con∣duct,
with the most serious attention before
we have yet committed any fatal or irretrevi∣able
errors.—If, instead of exerting reflection
for this valuable purpose, we deliver ourselves
up, at so critical a time, to sloth and pleasure;—if
we refuse to listen to any counsellor but hu∣mour,
or to attend to any pursuit except that
of amusement;—if we allow ourselves to float
loose and careless on the tide of life, ready to
receive any direction which the current of
fashion may chance to give us—the sad conse∣quences
of such indiscretion will extend to us:—we
cannot attain success without preparation,
and escape dangers without precaution.—Hap∣piness
<PB N="157" REF="171"/>
will not grow up to us of its own ac∣cord,
and solicit our exceptance, when to the
rest of mankind, it is the fruit of long cultiva∣tion,
and the acquisition of labour and care.—
We should not deceive ourselves with such arro∣gant
hopes.</P>
<P>Whatever be our rank, providence will not,
for our sakes, reverse its established order. But,
by tempering the vivacity of youth with a
proper mixture of serious thought, we may en∣sure
cheerfulness for the rest of life; whilst by de∣livering
ourselves up at present to giddiness and
levity, we lay the foundation of lasting heavi∣ness
of heart.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SOLITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>SOLITUDE is the hallowed ground which re∣ligion
hath, in every age, chosen for her
own.—There her inspiration is felt, and her
secret mysteries elevate the soul.—There, falis
the tear of contrition;—there, rises towards hea∣ven
the sigh of the heart; there, melts the
soul with all the tenderness of devotion, and
<PB N="158" REF="172"/>
pours itself forth, before him who made, and
redeemed it.</P>
<P>The great and worthy,—the pious and the
virtuous, have ever been addicted to serious
retirement. Refined and enlarged minds leave
the world behind them,—feel a call for higher
pleasures,—and seek them in retreat.</P>
<P>But a total feclusion from the world, is so
far from being the perfection of religion, that
it is no other than the abuse of it.—Yet there
will be neither consistency in the conduct, nor
dignity in the character, of one who sets apart
no share of time for meditation and reflection.</P>
<P>If we wish that reason should exert her native
power, we must step aside from the crowd into
the cool and silent shade.—It is there that with
sober and steady eye, she examines what is good
and evil, what is wise or foolish, in human con∣duct;
—she looks back on the past, and forms
plans, not for the present moment only, but for
the whole of life.</P>
<P>Man cannot discharge any part of his duty
aright, who never suffers his passions to cool—
<PB N="159" REF="173"/>
and his passions cannot cool, who is engaged
without interruption in the tumult of the world.
This incessant stir may be called the perpetual
drunkenness of life. It raises that eager fer∣mentation
of spirit which will ever be sending
forth the dangerous fumes of rashness and folly.</P>
<P>Whereas, he who mingles religious retreat
with worldly affairs, remains calm and master
of himself—he is not whirled round, and ren∣dered
giddy by the agitation of the world, but
comes forth with manly tranquility, fortified
by principles which he has formed, and pre∣pared
for whatever may befal.—For he who
wishes for an effectual cure of the wounds
which the world can inflict, should retire
from intercourse with men, to intercourse with
God.—When he enters into his closet, and
shuts the door, let him shut out at the same time
all intrusion of worldly care, and dwell among
objects divine and immortal: for celestial inha∣bitants
quarrel not.—For amongst them there
is neither ingratitude nor envy, nor tumult;
concord and tranquility reign for ever—From
such objects, upon the mind, of the pious man,
there beams a pure and enlivening light; there
is diffused over his heart a holy calm.—his agi∣tated
<PB N="160" REF="174"/>
spirit reassumes its firmness, and regains
its peace.—The world sinks in its importance,
and the load of mortality and misery loses almost
all its weight.—The disturbances and alarms, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
formidable to those who are engaged in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umults of the world, seem to him like thunder
only rolling afar off.</P>
<P>Besides, it is also necessary to prepare us for
a life to come. For breathing habitually a con∣tagious
air, how certain is our ruin, unless we
sometimes retreat from this pestilential region,
and seek for proper correctives of the disorders
which are contracted there?—Religious retire∣ment
both abates the disease, and furnishes the
remedy.—It lessens the corrupting influence of
the world; and it gives opportunity for better
principles to exert their power.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>THE STUDY OF MAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE life of man is a mixed state full of un∣certainty
and vicissitude, of anxieties and
fears.—For no man's prosperity on earth is
stable and assured—hence no study, to a thought∣ful
<PB N="161" REF="175"/>
mind, can appear more important than how
to be suitably prepared for the misfortunes of
life, so as to contemplate them in prospect with∣out
dismay; and, if they must befal, to bear
them without dejection.</P>
<P>Throughout every age, power has endea∣voured
to remove adversity to a distance.—
Philosophy has studied when it drew nigh, to
conquer it by patience,—and wealth has sought
out every pleasure that can compensate or ale∣viate
pain.</P>
<P>But religion has been no less attentive to the
same important object.—The defence which it
provides is altogether of an internal kind.—It
is the heart, not the outward state, which it
professes to guard, by affording the distressed
that security and peace, which arise from a be∣lief
of divine protection.—It opens to them
sources of consolation which are hidden from
others.—By that strength of mind with which
it endowes them, it sets them upon a rock,
against which the tempest may violently beat,
but cannot shake: for it prepares the mind for
encountering with fortitude, the most severe
shocks of adversity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="162" REF="176"/>
<HEAD>READING AND STUDY.</HEAD>
<P>READING, unless perverted, as the best
things may be, answers many excellent
purposes beside the great leading one; and is,
perhaps the safest remedy for dissipation.</P>
<P>The woman who dedicates a portion of her
leisure to <HI>useful</HI> reading, feels her mind in a con∣stant
progressive state of improvement, whilst
the mind of a dissipated female is continually
losing ground.—An active spirit rejoiceth, like
the sun, to run his daily course; while indo∣lence,
like the dial of Ahaz, goes backwards.</P>
<P>As for study, we may venture to assert, that
next to religious influences, it is the most pro∣bable
preservative of the virtue of young persons.</P>
<P>Those who cultivate letters, have rarely a
strong passion for promiscuous visiting, or dissi∣pated
society; study therefore induces a relish
for domestic life, the most desirable temper in
the world for women.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="177"/>
Study, as it rescues the mind from an inor∣dinate
fondness for gaming, dress, and public
amusements, is an oeconomical propensity; for
a lady may read at a much less expense than she
<HI>can play at cards.</HI>—As it requires some appli∣cation,
it gives the mind an habit of industry;
as it is a relief against that mental disease,
which the French emphatically call <HI>ennui,</HI> it
cannot fail of being beneficial to the temper and
spirits: in that moderate degree it is to be un∣derstood,
in which ladies use it;—as an enemy
to indolence, it becomes a social virtue;—as
it demands the full exertion of our talents, it
grows a rational duty; and when directed to
the knowledge of the supreme Being, and his
laws, it rises into an act of religion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>PASSIVE TAMENESS OF SPIRIT, AND UNLIMITED COMPLIANCE.</HEAD>
<P>PASSIVE tameness which submits without
struggle, to every encroachment of the
violent and assuming, forms no part of Christian
duty, but is destructive of general happiness
and order.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="178"/>
Unlimited complaisance which, on every oc∣casion,
falls in with the opinions and manners
of others, is so far from being a virtue, that it
is itself; vice, and the parent of many vices.—
It overthrows all steadiness of principle, and
produces that sinful conformity with the world,
which taints the whole character.</P>
<P>In the present corrupted state of human man∣ners
always to assent and to comply, is the
very worst maxim which can be adopted. It
is impossible to support the purity and dignity
of Christian morals, without opposing the world
on various occasions, even though we should
stand alone.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>TEMPERANCE.</HEAD>
<P>TEMPERANCE in pleasure is essentially ne∣cessary
to be observed, particularly by youth,
that they may beware of that rock on which
thousands, from race to race, continue to split.
The love of pleasure, natural to man in every
period of his life, glows at this age with exces∣sive
ardour.—Novelty adds fresh charms, as yet,
<PB N="165" REF="179"/>
to every gratification.—The world appears to
spread <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> continual feast;—and health, vigour,
and high spirits invite them to partake of it with∣out
restraint. In vain are they warned of the
latent danger.—The old, when they offer their
admonitions, are upbraided with having forgot
that they once were young. And yet, to what
do the counsels of age, with respect to pleasure,
amount? They may all be comprized in few
words, not to hurt ourselves, and not to hurt
others by our pursuit of pleasure, and those will
be fully effected by temperance. Within these
bounds, pleasure is lawful, beyond them it be∣comes
criminal, because it is ruinous.</P>
<P>Hence by this virtue we are not called to re∣nounce
pleasure, but to enjoy it in safety.—In∣stead
of abridging it, we are exhorted to pur∣sue
it on an extensive plan; we have measures
proposed for securing its possession, and for pro∣longing
its duration.—As we consider ourselves
not only as sensitive, but as rational beings;—
not only as rational but social;—not only as social
but immortal; whatever violates our nature in
any of these respects cannot afford true pleasure.</P>
<P>Have we not found that in the course of cri∣minal
excess, pleasure was more than compen∣sated
<PB N="166" REF="180"/>
by succeeding pain? Have we not from
every habit, at least, of unlawful gratification,
found some thorn spring to wound us; some
consequence to make us repent of it in the issue.
We should therefore avoid temptations, for
which we have found ourselves unequal, with as
much care as we would shun pestilential infec∣tion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>TRUE GENUINE SENTIMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TRUE genuine sentiment may be so connected
with the virtue of action, as to bestow on
it its brightest lustre, and its most captivating
graces. And enthusiasm under these circumstan∣stances
is so far from being disagreeable, that a
portion is indispensibly necessary in an engaging
woman; but it must be of the heart, not of the
senses.—It must grow up with a feeling mind,
and be cherished by a virtuous education, not
compounded of irregular passions and artificially
refined by books of unnatural fiction, and impro∣bable
adventure.</P>
<P>But this dangerous merit cannot be too rigid∣ly
watched, as it is very apt to lead those who
<PB N="167" REF="181"/>
possess it into inconveniencies from which
less interesting characters are happily exempt.
Strong sensibility may carry a very amiable tem∣per
into the most alarming extremes.—The
tastes of those so actuated are passions.—They
love and hate with all their hearts, and scarcely
suffer themselves to feel a reasonable preference,
before it strengthens into a violent attachment.</P>
<P>When an innocent girl of this open, trusting,
tender hearty happens to meet with one of her
own sex and age, whose address and manners
are engaging, she is instantly seized with an ar∣dent
desire to commence a friendship with her.
—She feels the most lively impatience at the re∣straint
of company and the decorums of ceremony.
—She longs to be alone with her,—longs to assure
her of the warmth of her tenderness,—and gene∣rally
ascribes to the fair stranger all the good
qualities she feels in her own heart, or rather all
those which she has met with in her reading,
disper<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in a variety of heroines.—She is per∣suaded
that her new friend unites them all in
herself, because she carries in her prepossessing
countenance the promise of them all.</P>
<P>If hints of her defects are given, she mistakes
the voice of discretion for the insinuation of an
<PB N="168" REF="182"/>
uncharitable disposition. At first she listens to
them with a generous impatience, and after∣wards
with a cold and silent disdain, and de∣spises
them as the effect of prejudice misrepre∣sentation,
or ignorance.</P>
<P>Yet this trusting confidence, this honest indis∣cretion,
is, at this early period of life, as amia∣ble
as it is natural; and will, if <HI>wisely</HI> cultivated,
produce, at its proper season, fruits infinitely
more valuable than all the guarded circumspec∣tion
of premature, and therefore artificial pru∣dence.
Nay, if the younger part of the sex are
sometimes deceived in the choice of a friend, they
enjoy even then an higher degree of satisfaction
than if they never trusted.—For to be always
clad in the burthensome armour of suspicion is
more painful and inconvenient, than to run the
hazard of suffering, now and then, a transient in∣jury.</P>
<P>These observations chiefly respect the inex∣perienced;
for it is a certainty that women are
capable of as faithful and as durable friendship
as any of the other sex. They can enter not
only into all the enthusiastic tenderness, but into
all the solid fidelity of attachment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="169" REF="183"/>
<HEAD>GOVERNMENT OF TEMPER.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY human creature is sensible of the pro∣pensities
to some infirmity of temper, which
it should be his care to correct and subdue;
particularly in the early period of life; else,
when arrived at a state of maturity, he may
relapse into those faults which were originally in
his nature, and which will require to be dili∣gently
watched, and kept under, through the
whole course of life;—for the cultivation of an
amiable disposition is a great part of religious
duty; since nothing leads more directly to the
breach of charity, and to the injury and mo∣lestation
of our fellow-creatures, than the in∣dulgence
of an ill temper.</P>
<P>With respect to a woman, the principal vir∣tues
and vices must be of a domestic kind.—
Within the circle of her own family and de∣pendents
lies her sphere of action—the scene
of almost all those tasks and trials, which must
<PB N="170" REF="184"/>
determine her character and her fate here and
hereafter.—The happiness of her husband, chil∣dren,
and servants, must depend on her temper;
and it will appear, that the greatest good or
evil which she may ever have in her power to
do, may arise from her correcting or indulging
its infirmities.</P>
<P>The greatest outward blessings cannot afford
enjoyment to a mind uneasy and ruffled within.
—A fit of ill humour will spoil the finest enter∣tainment,
and is as real a torment as the most
painful disease.—Another unavoidable conse∣quence
of ill temper, is the dislike and aversion
of all who are witnesses to it; and, perhaps, the
deep and lasting resentments of those who suffer
from its effects.</P>
<P>We all, from social and self-love, earnestly
desire the esteem and affection of our fellow-creatures;
and indeed our condition renders
them so necessary to us, that the wretch, who
has forfeited them, must feel desolate and un∣done—deprived
of all the best enjoyments and
comforts the world can afford—and given up to
his inward misery, unpitied and scorned.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="185"/>
Every temper is inclined, in some degree, to
passion, peevishness, or obstinacy: we should
therefore always watch the bent of our nature,
and apply remedies proper for the infirmities to
which we are most liable.—The first is so injuri∣ous
to society, and so odious in itself, that men
who give way to it render themselves, not only
disgusting, but dangerous:—hurried on by the
violence of rage, they break through the bounds
of decorum—destroy the order of civil society—
disregard truth—sacrifice justice—and disgrace,
as well as offend, the dignity of their Creator.</P>
<P>In a female character, one should think that
shame alone would be sufficient to preserve a
young woman from becoming a slave to it; for
it is as unbecoming her character to be betrayed
into ill behaviour by passion, as by intoxication;
and she ought to be ashamed of the one, as
much as the other.—Gentleness,—meekness,—
and <HI>patience,</HI> are her peculiar distinctions, and
<HI>an enraged woman is one of the most disgusting
sights in nature.</HI></P>
<P>The placid countenance—the mild deport∣ment
—and a smooth address, are strong incen∣tives
to just admiration, and to honest praise.—
<PB N="172" REF="186"/>
But these perfections all fall victims to that
monster passion.—It behoves us therefore to re∣tire
from such an occasion of sin,—and wait
till we are cool, before we presume to judge
of what has passed.</P>
<P>By accustoming ourselves thus to conquer and
disappoint our anger, we shall, by degrees, find
it grow weak and manageable, so as to leave
our reason at liberty.—We shall be able to re∣strain
our tongue from evil, and our looks and
gestures from all expressions of violence and ill∣will.</P>
<P>Pride, which produces so many evils in the
human mind, is the great source of passion.—
Whoever cultivates in himself a proper humi∣lity,—a
due sense of his own faults and insuffi∣ciences,—and
a due respect for others, will
find but small temptation to violent or unrea∣sonable
anger.</P>
<P>Whenever, therefore, we feel ourselves high∣ly
enraged, we should suspect ourselves to be
in the wrong, and resolve to stand the delibe∣rate
decision of our own conscience before we cast
<PB N="173" REF="187"/>
upon another the punishment which is perhaps
due to ourselves.—This self-examination will,
at least, give us time to cool, and, if we are
just, as it should be our chief aim to be so, will
dispose us to balance our own wrong with that
of our antagonist, and to settle the account
with him on equal terms.</P>
<P>There are many who acquire the character
of ill-temper, when in reality they merit not the
severity of the accusation; and this arises mere∣ly
from their mode of replication, or their man∣ner
of interrogating—as they are generally and
unfortunately attended with a species of tart∣ness
on every trivial occasion.—This indicates
to common observers a degree of petulance, and
seems to take its origin from a jealousy, or ra∣ther
fear of their own consequence being de∣graded
or injured in some respect.—This should
be carefully avoided, for the very appearance
of peevishness, is ungraceful and painful.</P>
<P>The fretful man, though he injures us less,
disgusts us more than him who is passionate:—
because he betrays a low and little mind,—in∣tent
on trifles,—and engrossed by a paltry self-love,
<PB N="174" REF="188"/>
which knows not how to bear the appre∣hension
of any inconvenience. It is self-love,
then, which we must combat, when we find
ourselves assaulted by this infirmity; and by vo∣luntarily
enduring inconveniences, we shall ha∣bituate
ourselves to bear them with ease, and
good humour, when occasioned by others.</P>
<P>We should endeavour, by denying ourselves
now and then innocent indulgences, to ac∣quire
a habit of command over our passions
and inclinations, particularly such as are
likely to lead us into evil; and abstract our
minds from that attention to trifling circum∣stances,
which usually creates this uneasiness.—
Our minds should, therefore, have always some
objects in pursuit worthy of them, that they
may not be engrossed by such, as are in them∣selves
scarce a worth a moment's anxiety; yet
from too minute and anxious attention seldom
fail to produce a teazing,—mean—and fretful
disposition.</P>
<P>We should substitute in their room the pursuit
of glory and happiness in another life.—Read∣ing
—reflection—rational conversation—and
<PB N="175" REF="189"/>
above all, conversting with God, by prayer and
meditation, would preserve us from taking that
interest in the little comforts and conveniences
of our remaining days, which usually gives birth
to so much fretfulness in old people.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this is generally attributed
to age, still we often see the young—the healthy
—and those who enjoy the most outward bles∣sings,
inexcusably guilty of it.—The smallest dis∣appointment
in pleasure, or difficulty in the most
trifling employment, will put <HI>wilful</HI> young
people out of temper, and their very amuse∣ments
becomes sources of vexation and peevish∣ness.
—There is a degree of resignation neces∣sary
even in the enjoyment of pleasure,—we
must be ready and willing to give up some part
of what we could wish for, before we can en∣joy
that which is indulged to us.—The craving
of restless vanity, the too constant companion
of youthful bosoms, will endure a thousand mor∣tifications,
which, in the midst of seeming plea∣sure,
will secretly corode the heart; whilst the
meek and humble generally find more gratifica∣tion
than they expected, and return home plea∣sed
and enlivened from every scene of amuse∣ment,
<PB N="176" REF="190"/>
though they could have stayed away
from it with perfect ease and contentment.</P>
<P>Sulleness and obstinacy, is, perhaps, a worse
fault of temper than, either of the former—and,
if indulged, may end in the most fatal extremes
of stubborn melancholy—malice—and revenge.
—The resentment which, instead of being ex∣pressed,
is passed in secret and continually ag∣gravated
by the imagination, will in time be∣come
the ruling passion; and then, how hor∣rible
must be his case, whose kind and pleasur∣able
affections are all swallowed up by the tor∣menting,
as well as detestable, sentiments of
hatred and revenge!</P>
<P>We should not brood over resentment, but
speak calmly—reasonably—and kindly—then
expostulate with our adversary; and either re∣concile
ourselves to him, or quiet our minds
under the injury, we have supposed he has
done us, by the principle of Christian charity.
—But if it appears we ourselves have been the
aggressors, we should acknowledge our error
fairly and handsomely;—a generous confession
ostentimes more than atones for the fault which
requires it.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="191"/>
Truth and justice demand that we should
acknowledge conviction, as soon as we feel it,
and not maintain an erroneous opinion, or jus∣tify
a wrong conduct, merely from the false
shame of confessing our past ignorance.—With
a disposition, strongly inclined to sulleness or
obstinacy, this may appear perhaps impracti∣cable;
—but by constant use the mind will
gain strength from the contest, and this inter∣nal
enemy will by degrees be forced to give
ground.</P>
<P>The love of truth, and a real desire of im∣provement,
ought to be the <HI>only</HI> motives of
argumentation; and where these are sincere,
no difficulty can be made of embracing the
truth, as soon as it is perceived.—To receive
advice—reproof—and instruction properly, is
the surest sing of a sincere and humble heart,—
and shews a greatness of mind, which commands
our respect and reverence, while it appears so
willingly to yield to us in superiority.</P>
<P>We should consider, that those who tell us of
our faults, if they do it from motives of kind∣ness,
<PB N="178" REF="192"/>
and not of malice, exert their friendship in
a painful office; which must have cost them as
great an effort, as it can be to us to acknow∣ledge
the service;—and if we refuse this en∣couragement,
we cannot expect that any one,
who is not absolutely obliged to it by duty, will
a second time undertake such an ill requited
trouble.</P>
<P>Excessive and ill-judged indulgence, seldom
fails to reduce a woman to the miserable condi∣tion
of a humoured child, always unhappy from
having nobody's will to study but its own—
The insolence of such demands for herself, and
such disregard to the choice and inclinations of
others, can seldom fail to make as many enemies
as there are persons obliged to bear with those
humours; whilst a compliant—reasonable—and
contented disposition, would render her happy
in herself, and beloved by all her companions;
—particularly by those who live constantly with
her.</P>
<P>Family friendships are the friendships made
for us by an all-wise Providence—hence ought
we to employ every faculty of entertainment—
<PB N="179" REF="193"/>
every engaging qualification which we possess to
the best advantage for those, whose love is of
the most importance to us;—for those, who live
under the same roof, and with whom we are
connected in life, either by the ties of blood
—or by the still more sacred obligation of vo∣luntary
engagement.—The <HI>sincere</HI> and <HI>genuine</HI>
smiles of complacency and love should adorn
our countenance.—That ready compliance—
that alertness to assist and oblige, which demon∣strates
true affection, must animate our behavi∣our,
and endear our most common actions.—Politeness
must accompany our greatest familia∣rities,
and restrain us from every thing that is
really offensive, or which can give a moment's
unnecessary pain.—Conversation, which is so
apt to grow dull and insipid in families, nay,
in some to be almost wholly laid aside, must be
cultivated with the frankness and openess of
friendship, and by the mutual communication
of whatever may conduce to the improvement
or innocent entertainment of each other.</P>
<P>All these qualifications, which cannot fail to
render us pleasing, will be the natural result of
a well-governed temper, as it will derive, plea∣sure
<PB N="180" REF="194"/>
to itself, in proportion as it has the power
of communicating it to others.—This disposition
of mind should therefore be cultivated with the
utmost care and diligence—the symptoms of that
humour, against which all our artillery should
be levied, should be minutely watched, and with
a firm resolution conquered as they rise;—for
a sweet disposition is its own reward, and is in
itself essential to happiness.</P>

<PB N="181" REF="195"/>
<HEAD>GOOD TEMPER,
ITS EFFECTS AND UTILITY.</HEAD>
<P>A good natured man, whatever faults he may
have, they will for the most part be treated
with lenity;—he will generally find an advocate
in every human heart;—his errors will be la∣mented,
rather than abhorred;—and his virtues
will be viewed in the fairest point of light;—
His good humour, without the help of great ta∣lents
or acquirements, will make his company
preferable to that of the most brilliant genius, in
whom this quality is wanting—but with it, such
a brightness will be added to their lustre, that
all the world will envy and admire, whilst his
associates will almost adore, and labour to imi∣tate
him.—In short, it is almost impossible that
we can be sincerely beloved by any body, with∣out
this engaging property, whatever other
excellencies we may possess;—but with it, we
shall scarcely fail of finding some friends and fa∣vourers,
even though we should be destitute of
almost every other advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="196"/>
It is true we are not all equally happy in our
dispositions; but human virtue consists in che∣rishing
and cultivating every good inclination,
and in checking and subduing every propensity
to evil.—If a man had been born with a bad
temper, it might have been made a good one,
at least with regard to its outward effects, by
education, reason, and principle: and though
he is so happy as to have a good one while
young, he must not suppose it will always conti∣nue
so, if he neglects to maintain a proper com∣mand
over it.—Power—sickness—disappoint∣ments
—or worldly cares may corrupt, or em∣bitter
the finest disposition, if they are not coun∣teracted
by reason and religion.—Hence these
should be ever exerted in the exigencies of life—
they will teach us a becoming submission under
all the accidents of our mortal state, with which
it is so variously chequered;—divest calamity of
its severest sting—make our enemies ashamed of
their persecuting spirit—and cause us to smile
even in the midst of misfortune.</P>
<P>By good temper is not meant an insensible in∣difference
to injuries—and a total forbearance
from manly resentment.—There is a noble and
generous kind of anger, a proper and necessary
<PB N="183" REF="197"/>
part of our nature which has nothing in it sin∣ful
or degrading—We are not to be dead to
this—for the person, who feels not an injury,
must be incapable of being properly affected by
benefits,—With those, who treat us ill without
provocation, we ought to maintain our own dig∣nity
—but whilst we shew a sense of their im∣proper
behaviour, we must preserve calmness,
and even good breeding,—and thereby convince
them of the impotence, as well as injustice of
their malice.</P>
<P>Generous anger does not preclude esteem for
whatever is really estimable, nor does it destroy
good-will to the person of its object—or autho∣rize
any impeachment to rest on the goodness
of our disposition:—It even inspires the desire
of overcoming our enemy by benefits,—and
wishes to inflict no other punishment than the
regret of having injured one who deserved his
kindness:—It is always placable, and ready to
be reconciled, as soon as the offender is convin∣ced
of his error; nor can any subsequent injury
provoke it to recur to past disobligations, which
had been once forgiven.—The consciousness of
injured innocence naturally produces, dignity,
and usually prevents anger;—but if tempered
<PB N="184" REF="198"/>
with the calmness of a quiet spirit, it ever rises
superior to the oppressive hand of insolence and
cruelty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>EFFECTS OF VICE.</HEAD>
<P>VICE by its natural influence on the temper
tends to produce dejection under the slight∣est
trials, and weakens that which only can sup∣port
mankind when those vicissitudes come.—For
it is their mind which must then support
them; and their mind, by their sensual attach∣ments,
is corrupted and enfeebled—so that they
have neither principles, nor temper which can
stand the assault of trouble.</P>
<P>They have no principles which lead them to
look beyond the ordinary rotation of events—and
therefore, when misfortunes involve them,
the prospect must be comfortless on every side.—Strangers
to all the temperate satisfactions of
a good and pure mind—Strangers to every plea∣sure
except what was seasoned by vice or vanity,
their adversity is to the last degree disconso∣late—From
hence we may deduce the causes
<PB N="185" REF="199"/>
to which we must ascribe the broken spirits—the
peevish temper,—and impatient passions that
so often attend the declining age, or falling for∣tunes
of vicious men.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>VILLAIN.</HEAD>
<P>HE climbs the steep rock, and treads on the
edge of a precipice, in order to catch a
shadow—He has cause to dread not only the un∣certainty
of the event which he wishes to ac∣complish,
but the nature also of that enent when
accomplished—He is not only liable to that dis∣appointment
of success, which so often frustrates
all designs of men; but liable to a disappoint∣ment
still more cruel, that of being successful
and miserable at once.</P>
<P>Riches and pleasure are the chief temptations
to criminal deeds.—Yet those riches, when ob∣tained,
may very possibly overwhelm him with
unforeseen miseries.—Those pleasures may cut
short his health and life—And is it for such
doubtful and fallacious rewards, that the decei∣ver
fills his mouth with lies, the friend betrays
<PB N="186" REF="200"/>
his benefactor, the apostate renounces his faith,
and the assassin covers himself with blood!</P>
<P>Whoever commits a crime, incurs a certain
evil for a most uncertain good—What will turn
to his advantage in the course of this life,
he cannot with any assurance know;—but this he may know, with full certainty, that he will
draw upon his head that displeasure of the Al∣mighty,
which shall crush him for ever.</P>
<P>The advantages of this world when obtained
by criminal means carry a curse in their bosom,
nay even when innocently gained, are uncertain
blessings.—To the virtuous, they are often no
more than chaff—to the guilty they are always
poison.</P>

<PB N="187" REF="201"/>
<HEAD>VIRTUE AND PROSPERITY CONTRASTED.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE situations which favour pleasure are
too generally adverse to virtue.—Virtue
requires internal government, and discipline;
prosperity relaxes the mind, and inflames the
passions:—virtue is supported by a regard to
what is future—prosperity attaches us wholly to
what is present—virtue checks our pursuits,
which, are the result of intemperance—refrains
our desires, and makes them flow in the calm
tide of moderation:—prosperity encreases our
evil propensities—inflames our passions—and
plunges us deep in the stream of riot and excess:—virtue
is the sovereign pilot which steers us
into the harbour of true lasting pleasure—pro∣sperity
is too apt to turn the helm to the port
of sensual enjoyment—unites us too closely to the
things of this world—and makes us eye the mo∣ment
of our dissolation with regret and horror.—The
characteristics of virtue are modesty and
humility—the most common attendants upon
prosperity are pride and presumption; and
often proves the motive of impiety.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="188" REF="202"/>
<HEAD>VIRTUE</HEAD>
<P>IS the universal charm: even its shadow is
courted, when the substance is wanting—
It must be formed and supported, not by unfre∣quent
acts, but by daily and repeated exertions,
in order to its becoming vigorous and useful.—Great
events give scope for great virtues; but
the main tenour of human life is composed of
small occurrences—Within the round of these,
lie the materials of the happiness of most men;
the subjects of their duty, and the trials of their virtue.</P>
<P>Whatever is to be our profession, no educa∣tion
is more necessary to success, than the ac∣quirement
of virtuous dispositions and habits.—
This is the universal preparation for every cha∣racter,
and every station in life—Bad as the
world is, respect is. always paid to virtue.—In
the usual course of human affairs, it will be found
that a plain understanding joined with acknow∣ledged
worth, contributes more to prosperity
than the brightest parts without probity and
honour.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="203"/>
Whether science, or business, or public life,
be our aim, virtue still enters, for a principal
share, into all those great departments of society.</P>
<P>It is connected with eminence, in every libe∣ral
art;—with reputation, in every branch of
fair and useful business;—with distinction, in
every public station. The vigour which it gives
to the mind, and the weight which it adds to
the character;—the generous sentiment which
it breathes;—the undaunted spirit which it in∣spires;
—the ardour of diligence which it quickens;—the
freedom which it procures from pernicious
and dishonourable avocations, are the founda∣tion
of all that is high in same, or great in success among men.</P>
<P>Whatever ornamental or engaging endow∣ments
we possess, virtue is a necessary requisite
in order to their shining with proper lustre—By
whatever arts we may at first attract the at∣tention,
we can hold the esteem, and secure the
hearts of others, only by amiable dispositions,
and the accomplishments of the mind—These
are the qualities whose influence will last, when
the lustre of all that once sparkled and dazzled has passed away.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="190" REF="204"/>
<HEAD>VOLUPTUARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE corrupted temper, and the guilty passions
of the bad frustrate the effect of every
advantage which the world confers on them—The
world may call them men of pleasure; but
of all men they are the greatest foes to pleasure:
from their eagerness to grasp, they strangle
and destroy it—riotous indulgence enervates
both the body and the mind: so that in the
midst of his studied refinement the voluptuary
languishes.</P>
<P>Wherever guilt mingles with prosperity a
certain gloom and heaviness enter along with it.
Vicious intrigues never fail to entangle, and em∣barrass
those who engage in them;—besides,
the selfish gratifications of the bad are both nar∣row
in their circle, and short in their duration.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="191" REF="205"/>
<HEAD>WIT.</HEAD>
<P>WIT is the most dangerous talent we can
possess.—It must be guarded with great
discretion, and good nature, otherwise it will
create many enemies.</P>
<P>Wit is perfectly consistent with softness and
delicacy; yet they are seldom found united.—Wit
is so flattering to vanity, that they who
possess it become intoxicated, and love all self-command.</P>
<P>Though it is the most captivating, yet it is
the most dreaded of all talents: the most dan∣gerous
to those who have it, and the most
feared by those who have it not. He who is
grown rich without it, in safe and sober dull∣ness,
shuns it as a disease, and looks upon po∣verty
as its invariable concomitant.</P>
<P>The moralist declaims against it as the source
of irregularity; and the frugal citizen dreads
it more than bankruptcy itself: for he considers
<PB N="192" REF="206"/>
it as the parent of extravagance and beggary.—The
Cynic will ask of what use is it? Of
very little perhaps: no more is a flower garden,
and yet it is allowed, as an object of innocent
amusement, and delightful recreation.</P>
<P>A woman who possesses this quality has re∣ceived
a most dangerous present, perhaps, not
less so than beauty itself: especially if it be
not shearhed in a temper peculiarly inoffensive,—chastised
by a most correct judgment,—and re∣strained
by more prudence than falls to the common lot.</P>
<P>This talent is more likely to make a woman
vain than knowledge; for there is much more
danger that that folly should arise from the con∣sideration
of what is our own, than of what we
borrow.—But wit, like learning, is not near so
common a thing as is imagined.—For flippancy,
pertness, and impudence are often mistaken for
this brilliant quality; and people often imagine
They are witty, only because they are indiscreet;
and this makes the name of wit so cheap, while
its real existence is so rare.</P>
<P>But those who happily possess this talent,
cannot be too abstinent in the use of▪ it.—It
<PB N="193" REF="207"/>
often makes admirers, but never makes friends;
and she, who does not desire friends, has a sor∣did
and insensible soul; but she, who is ambiti∣ous
of making every man her admirer, has an
invincible vanity and a cold heart.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>WOMAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE prevailing manners of an age depend
more than we are aware, or are willing
to allow, on the conduct of the women; this
is one of the principal things on which the
great machine of human society turns. Those
who allow the influence which female graces
have, in contributing to polish the manners of
men, would do well to reflect how great an in∣fluence
female morals must also have on their con∣duct.
How much then is it to be regretted,
that women should ever sit down contented to
polish, when they are able to reform: to en∣tertain,
when they might instruct; and to
dazzle for an hour, when, they are candidates
for eternity!</P>
<P>In this land of civil and religious liberty,
where there is as little despotism exercised over
the minds, as over the persons of women, they
<PB N="194" REF="208"/>
have every liberty of choice, and every oppor∣tunity
of improvement; and how greatly does
this encrease their obligation to be exemplary
in their general conduct, attentive to the govern∣ment
of their families, and instrumental to the
good order of society.</P>
<P>The woman who is at a loss to find amuse∣ment
at home, cannot apologize for her dis∣sipation
abroad, by saying the is deprived of
the benefit and pleasure of books; and she who
regrets being doomed, to a state of dark and
gloomy ignorance, by the injustice and tyranny
of the men, complains of an evil which does
not exist.</P>
<P>It is a certain truth, that women the most
accomplished are sure to acquire the universal
admiration and esteem of the world, if the im∣provement
of the heart accompanies their thirst
of other knowledge:—and vanity, that idol of
the sex, be supplanted by modest humility.</P>
<P>Nothing delights men more than the strength
of understandings, when true gentleness of man∣ners
is its associate:—United, they become irre∣sistible
orators—blessed with the power of per∣suasion—fraught
with the sweetness of instruction
making woman the highest ornament of human nature.</P>

<HEAD>WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>THE world is the great deceiver; whose fal∣lacious
arts it highly imports us to detect.
But in the midst of its pleasures and pursuits, the
detection is impossible. We tread as within an
enchanted circle, where nothing appears as it
truly is.—We live in delusion, forming plans of
imaginary bliss.—We wander for ever in the
paradise of fools—meditating in secret on the
means of attaining worldly success;—which ac∣quired
has seldom, in one instance, fulfilled our
expectation;—but where we have reckoned
most upon enjoyment, there have we generally found the least.</P>
<P>It is too often considered as the only field of
pleasure; and beat over and over in quest of joys
unsubstantial and transitory:—Pleased with the
visionary trifles which it affords, we forget the
probationary state of our existence,—madly
pursue what at best we cannot retain—barter
our eternal welfare for vain shadows and empty
shew;—and as if careless of the justice of God
seem to regard not his threatened vengeance,
but depend solely on the extent of his mercy;
and divest ourselves of the smallest right to
demand our promised felicity.</P>

<PB N="196" REF="210"/>
<HEAD>RELIGIOUS WORSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>THE expressions of those affections under its
various forms, are no other than native
effusions of the human heart. Ignorance may
mislead, and superstition may corrupt them,
but their origin are derived from sentiments
that are essential to man.</P>
<P>Wherever men have existed, they have been
sensible that some acknowledgment was due, on
their part, to the Sovereign of the world;
which Christian revelation has placed in such a
light, as one should think were sufficient over∣awe
the most thoughtless, and to melt the most
obdurate mind.</P>
<P>But religious worship, disjoined from justice
and virtue, can on no account whatever find ac∣ceptance
with the supreme Being.—Because it
is for the sake of man that worship and prayers
are required, that he may be rendered better,
and acquire those pious and virtuous dispositions,
in which his highest improvement consists.</P>

<HEAD>YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>YOUTH is the season of warm and generous
emotions;—the heart should then sponta∣neously
rise into the admiration of what is great,
glow with the love of what is fair and excellent,
and melt at the discovery of tenderness
and
goodness.—In this season we should endeavour,
upon rational and sober enquiry, to have our
principles established, nor suffer them to be
shaken by the scoffs of the licentious, or the
cavils of the sceptical.—No wantoness of youth∣ful
spirits, no compliance with the intemperate
mirth of others, should ever betray us into pro∣fane
sallies.</P>
<P>It should not be barren of improvements, so
essential to future felicity and honour.</P>
<P>This is the feed-time of life.—The character
is now, under divine assistance, of our own
forming; our fate is, in some measure, put into
our own hands.—Nature is as yet pliant and
soft—habits have not established their dominion
<PB N="198" REF="212"/>
—prejudices have not pre-occupied our under∣standing
—the world has not had time to con∣tract
and debase our affections.—All our powers
are more vigorous, disembarrassed and free, than
they will be at any future period. Whatever
impulse we now give to our desires and passions,
the direction is likely to continue.—It will form
the channel in which our life is to run; nay, it
may determine its everlasting issue.</P>
<P>Virtuous youth gradually brings forward ac∣complished
and flourishing manhood; and such
manhood passes of itself without uneasiness, into
respectable and tranquil old age.—But if youth
be trifled away without improvement, manhood
will be contemptible, and old age miserable.—
If the beginning of life has been vanity, its
latter end can be no other than vexation of
spirit.</P>

<HEAD>DETACHED SENTIMENTS
AND
MORAL MAXIMS.</HEAD>
<P>THE things in our own power, are in their
own nature free, not capable of being coun∣termanded
or hindered; but those that are not
in our power are feeble, servile, liable to opposition,
and not ours, but anothers.</P>
<P>When any frightful and discouraging imagi∣nations
assaults us, we should harden ourselves,
and meet it boldly, with this reflection, that it
is only our apprehension of things, and not the
real nature of the things themselves.</P>
<P>We should, on all occasions, reflect with our∣selves,
of what nature and condition those things
are, that minister delight, or are useful and be∣neficial
to us, and that we have a natural tend∣ency
for; and that these reflections may answer
their end, we should make them familiar, by
<PB N="200" REF="214"/>
beginning at the slightest and most inconsiderable
things, and so rise to the higher and more va∣lauble.</P>
<P>In every action we undertake, we should con∣sider
first with ourselves, and weigh well the na∣ture
and circumstances of the thing; nay,
though it be a slight one represent to ourselves
what accident we may probably meet with, and
determine to preserve our minds and reasson un∣disturbed
—by which means we shall be guarded against their disagreeable effects; which never
can be done, if we suffer every one to discom∣pose
us.</P>
<P>That which gives men disquiet, and makes
their lives miserable, is not the nature of things
as they really are, but the notions and opinions
which they form to themselves concerning them.—wherever
therefore we meet with obstructions
and perplexities—and fall into them, let us be
just, and not lay the blame where it is not due;
but impute it all to ourselves, and our prijudi∣cate
opinions.</P>
<P>We should never be exalted with any excel∣lence
that is not properly our own.—We should
<PB N="201" REF="215"/>
content ourselves with making a right use of
our own ideas, and when we manage these as
we ought, we may be allowed to please our∣selves;
for this is being exalted with some ex∣cellence
that is properly ours.</P>
<P>Let us not trouble ourselves with wishing that
things may be just as we would have them; but
well pleased that they should be just as they are,
then we shall live easy.</P>
<P>Upon every fresh accident we ought to turn
our eyes inward, and examine how we are qua∣lified
to encounter it,—and prepare ourselves to
meet it with patience and resolution—If we use
ourselves to these, by begrees no accident what∣ever
will be able to surprize or subdue us.</P>
<P>Our constant care should be to behave our∣selves
in the affairs of human life, with the
same decency as at a public entertainment—If
any thing be offered us, we should receive it;
with modesty; if it pass by us, and be sent to
another, let us not withhold it from him, or keep
what was not intended us; if it be not come
down to us, let us not shew ourselves eager nor
<PB N="202" REF="216"/>
snatch at it greedily, but wait patiently till it
comes to our turn.—In case of riches, honour,
power or preferment, we should manage our∣selves
in the same manner: it will render us
pleasing to man, and acceptable to God.</P>
<P>The world we should consider as a theatre,
that our parts in this play of life is determined
by the poet; upon him it must depend whether
we shall act a long or short one; whether our
characters shall be high or low;—if therefore
he assigns us that of a beggar, we must be care∣ful
to humour it well;—if a cripple—or a
prince—or a private obscure man, and whatever
it be, we must make the best of it.—The play∣ing
of the parts commendably depends on our∣selves
—the giving them out, and choosing the
actors is not ours but another person's.</P>
<P>It is always in our power to come off conque∣rors,
provided we will never engage in any
combats, but such whose successes will be deter∣mined
by our own choice.</P>
<P>If we see any person advanced to an eminent
station of honour and power, or any other kind
<PB N="203" REF="217"/>
of prosperity, we should avoid being presently
surprized with a false idea of his condition, nor
rashly pronounce him happy;—for if all the
happiness and tranquillity of our minds depend
upon things within our own power, there can
be no room for envy of emulation.</P>
<P>When any man reviles of strikes us we should
consider that it is not the tongue that gives us
the opprobrious language, or the hand that deals
the blow that injures or affronts us; but it is
our own resentment of it, as an injury or af∣front,
that makes if such to us; the provoca∣tion
is entirely owing to our own apprehensions
which swells us into revenge.</P>
<P>It is necessary to keep all those calamities, of
which mankind are most afraid, constantly be∣fore
our eyes, and let them be familiar to our
minds; but above all, death should be ever pre∣sent
there;—it is an excellent remedy against
base and mean thoughts, and a powerful restraint
to all immoderate desires.</P>
<P>If we resolve to make wisdom and virtue the
study and business of our lives, we must be sure
<PB N="204" REF="218"/>
to arm ourselves beforehand against all the in∣conveniencies
and discouragements that are like
to attend this resolution.—We shall meet with
many scoffs and much derision—but let us not be
affected, or supercilious; only stick close to
whatever we are in our judgment convinced is
virtuous and becoming—and consider this as our
proper station assigned by God, which we must
not quit upon any terms; and remember,
that if we persevere in goodness, those very
men who derided us at first, will afterwards
turn our admirers;—but if we give way to
their reproaches, and are vanquished by them,
we shall render ourselves doubly, and most de∣servedly
ridiculous.</P>
<P>If we ever happen to accommodate ourselves
to the humour of the world, for the sake of re∣putation
and applause;—we should take notice
that it is below a philosopher:—and therefore
content ourselves upon all occasions with really
being what we would be thought—but if we
will need be thought so too, we should deserve
our own good opinion: that will be sufficient.</P>
<P>If we observe some other person more caressed
than ourselves;—invited to entertainments when
<PB N="205" REF="219"/>
we are left out;—saluted before we are
taken notice of;—thought more proper to ad∣vise
with, and his counsel followed rather than
ours;—we should consider whether these re∣spects
paid to him are good things, or evil;—if
they deserve to be esteemed good, this ought
to be matter of joy to us;—but if they be evil,
how unreasonable is it to be troubled because
they have not fallen to our share.</P>
<P>We should consider with ourselves seriously,
what figure is most fit for us to make in the
world; and then fix upon a method and rule
in order hereunto: which we should be sure to
observe nicely, both at home alone, and abroad
in company.</P>
<P>One of our principal rules should be silence;—and
when we discourse, confine ourselves to such
subjects as are necessary, and express our sense
in as few words as possible. Loquacity is a most
impertinent intruder on society; and many
useless words, though the pride of the speaker,
the destruction of his consequence,—an un∣pardonable
infringement on the laws of good-breeding,—and
a fatigue to his auditors.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="220"/>
Whenever we happen into company, where
we have authority, and influence enough to do
it, we should try to change the discourse if unin∣structive,
unentertaining, or offensive, and bring
it to becoming subjects:—but if we are among
people of another temper, such as will not en∣dure
restraint or reproof, then it behoves us to
hold our own tongues.</P>
<P>Loud laughing is a mark of ill-breeding—laughing
at our own jokes, too oft the effect of
ignorance:—we should not indulge even in
laughing at all but upon few occasions, and then
it should not be much.</P>
<P>If possible we should avoid swearing altoge∣ther,
it is vulgar and impious—but if we can∣not
do that absolutely, we should be sure to de∣cline
it as much as is in our power.</P>
<P>All public entertainments and mixed compa∣nies
without they are calculated to produce in∣nocent
amusement, improve the understanding,
or polish the manners, should be declined:—but
if any extraordinary occasion calls us to them,
we should keep a strict guard upon ourselves,
<PB N="207" REF="221"/>
lest we should be infected with rude and vulgar
conversation; for though a man be never so
clear himself, yet, by frequenting company
that are tainted, he will of necessity contract
some pollution from them.</P>
<P>Use and necessity should be the rule of all the
provisions we make for the body—we should
choose meat and drink—apparel—house—and
retinue of such kinds, and in such proportions
as will most conduce to these purposes.—but as
for all beyond this, which ministers to vanity
and luxury, let us retrench and despise.</P>
<P>To render us truly amiable, in the sight of
the just and virtuous, nothing, however it may be
laughed at by the dissolute, contributes so much
to that end as chastity,—but how perfect so∣ever
ours may be, the conceit of this should not
make us troublesome to others, that are more
frail; nor should we be too lavish in either re∣proving
their failings, nor in commendation of
our own virtue.</P>
<P>If we happen to be told at any time, that
another person hath spoken ill of us, we should
<PB N="208" REF="222"/>
never trouble ourselves to confute the report,
or excuse the thing without being publicly cal∣led
forth, and the preservation of character
makes it necessary;—but rather put all up with
this reply,—that we have several faults besides
that, and if he had known us more, he would
have spoken worse.—</P>
<P>In familiar conversations with our friends
and acquaintance, we should never make it our
business to entertain the company with tedious
narratives of ourselves, or our own affairs—The
exploits by which we have signalized our∣selves,—the
successes we have obtained,—the
dangers we have encountered—or the afflictions
we have undergone, may be very
agreeable stories for us to tell; yet they will
not be equally so for others to hear.</P>
<P>It will not become us to render ourselves the
common buffoon, and be always trying to make
a company laugh; for this is a nice and very
ticklish thing, exceeding apt to degenerate into
vice and folly—and he that only studies men's
diversion, shall be sure at the same time to lose
their respect.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="223"/>
Of all kinds of discourse, none is more unsafe,—none
more despicable than that which breaks
in upon modesty and good manners.—Wherever
therefore any person flies out into obscenity, if
such a liberty dare be taken, we should reprove
him publicly, and put a stop to his lewd conver∣sation;—but
if that cannot conveniently be
done, yet at least we may do ourselves the
justice to disapprove it; and by forbearing
to join with him—by blushing for him—and by
chiding looks, let all the company see plainly,
that we detest his filthy ribaldry.</P>
<P>When the idea of any pleasure strikes our
imagination, as we must on other occasions, so
should we in this, especially stand upon our
guard, and not suffer ourselves to be hurried
away with the impetuous torrent;—we should
not run eagerly upon enjoyment, nor improve
the thought into action;—but take time to con∣sider,
and let that time be employed in making
a just computation between the duration of the
pleasure, and that of the repentance sure to
follow it; and then we shall not fail to check
our inclinations, and chide ourselves for indulg∣ing
them in any degree at all.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="224"/>
When upon mature deliberation we are per∣suaded
a thing is fit to be done—let us do it
boldly, and not affect privacy in it, nor con∣cern
ourselves at all what impertinent censures,
or reflections the world may pass upon it; for
if the thing be just and innocent, it is foolish to
stand in fear of those, who will themselves do
ill in censuring and condemning what we do
well.</P>
<P>If we take upon us a character above our ca∣pacity,
we fall into a twofold inconvenience;—first,
to miscarry in what we have under∣taken;
and then to lose the opportunity of un∣dertaking
somewhat else, more proportionable
to our abilities, in which we might have come
off with honour.</P>
<P>In all the affairs of human life, we should
take care not to hurt our mind, or offend our
judgment; and this rule, if cautiously observed
in all our deportment, will be a mighty secu∣rity
to us in all our undertakings, and prevent
us from being injured by folly, or aggreived
by impetuosity.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="225"/>
At the age of fourteen women begin to be
courted and caressed; then they think that the
recommending themselves to the affections of
the men is the only business they have to attend
to; and so presently fall to tricking—to dres∣sing—and
practising all the little engaging arts
peculiar to their sex: in these they place all
their hopes, as they do all their happiness in
the success of them:—But they should under∣stand,
that there are other attractives much
more powerful than these; that the respect we
pay them, is not due to their beauty, so much
as to their modesty, and innocence, and unaf∣fected
virtue: and that these are the true,—the
irresistible charms, such as will make the
surest and most lasting conquests.</P>
<P>There is no surer sign of stupidity, and want
of sense, than to trifle away a great deal of time
in things relating to the body, as to be long at
exercise—or at meals—or drinking—or in the
other functions of nature. For we ought to
look upon all that is done to the body as things
by the by, and the improvement of the soul, as
that which challenges our time, and is the true
and main end, and business of our lives.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="226"/>
We should never profess ourselves philoso∣phers,
nor talk much of rules and wise observa∣tions
among the ignorant and vulgar—but let
our rules be seen in our practice—nor should
we be sollicitous in making a shew of our eru∣dition,
or boast of our learning, it raises the
envy of the illiterate—disgusts the modest—gives
us the character of ostentatious, and loads
us with general odium.—Nay, if we happen in
conversation with ignorant and common men,
though they themselves start a discourse con∣cerning
some point in philosophy, we should
forbear joining with them in it; for when men
are forward to vent their notions, it is a shrewd
sign they are not well digested.—We should ra∣ther
labour to approve the excellence of our
doctrines to the world, not by disputes and
plausible harrangues, but by digesting them into
practice, and growing strong in virtue.</P>
