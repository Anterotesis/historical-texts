<P>THE editor of this ingenious, though small tract on the <HI>Art of Acting,</HI> will not insist so much on the utility of it as naturally pre∣sents itself at this time, when <HI>a critical judgment of the stage business being in high esteem in conversation,</HI> and <HI>a desire of acquiring ability for that walk in life,</HI> give ample room for such a production. He is persuaded the public will derive great satis∣faction in the perusal of it; especially, as now presented to them—the substance of the work is drawn into <HI>an analysis for the instanta∣neous expression of any particular passion,</HI> and the <HI>Actor's Epitome</HI> (a valuable Poem, by the same author), being prefixed; which, it is presumed, are no inconsiderable appen∣dages.—And as there is not the least doubt of a general approbation of the author's labors, the editor fully trusts the candid with <HI>a re∣publication</HI> of this <HI>Essay on the Art of Act∣ing,</HI> more for the <HI>facilitating</HI> of <HI>improve∣ment</HI> therein, than in expectation of any pe∣cuniary return.</P>

<PB REF="7"/>
<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE ART OF ACTING.</HEAD>
<P>THE first dramatic principle (and it must always be uppermost in a good actor's me∣mory, if he hopes to reach perfection in his business) is the following:</P>
<P>To act a passion well, the actor never must attempt its imitation, till his fancy has conceived so strong an image, or idea, of it, as to move the same im∣pressive springs within his mind, which form that passion when it is undesigned and natural.</P>
<P>This is an absolutely necessary, and the only general rule. And let no actor ap∣prehend it over difficult. The <HI>practice</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
it shall be laid down clearly; and it will be found extremely easy and delightful, both in study and execution. And the truth of its <HI>foundation</HI>, that it is wholly built on nature, is evident beyond dis∣pute, upon examining its effects, in this deduction, from their causes.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI>, The imagination must conceive a <HI>strong idea</HI> of the passion.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, But that idea cannot <HI>strongly</HI> be conceived, without impressing its own form upon the muscles of the <HI>face</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>, Nor <HI>can</HI> the look be muscularly stamped, without communicating, instant∣ly, the same impressions to the muscles of the <HI>body</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>, The muscles of the body (braced or slack, as the idea was an active or passive <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne), must, in their natural, and not-to-be-avoided consequence, by impelling or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etarding the flow of the animal spirits, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ransmit their own conceived sensation to he sound of the <HI>voice</HI>, and disposition of the <HI>gesture</HI>.</P>
<P>And this is a short abstract of the art, in its most comprehensive and reduced idea.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="9"/>But there must follow <HI>applications</HI> of the general rule, by particular references, for the practical use of the actor.</P>
<P>And, first, it should be noted, that there are only <HI>ten</HI> dramatic passions; that is, passions which can be distinguished by their outward marks, in action; all others being relative to, and but varied degrees of, the foregoing.</P>
<P>These are the ten dramatic passions:
<Q>JOY, GRIEF, FEAR, ANGER, PITY, SCORN, HATRED, JEALOUSY, WONDER, LOVE.</Q></P>
<P>And now, for application of the rule to each of these in its particular distinction; <HI>in which an actor will be fully prepared for the expression of either, or all, of the above passions</HI>.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION I. Of JOY. DEFINITION. <HI>JOY is Pride, possessed of Triumph.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is a warm and conscious expansion of the heart, indulging a sense of present
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
pleasure, and comparing it with past af∣fliction: It cannot, therefore, be expressed without vivacity in look, air, and accent.</P>
<P>But it will be proper, for distinguishing the modes of representing this, and every other passion, to consider their effect on speeches, wherein that particular passion governs, which is about to be attempted by the speaker.</P>
<P>And, for ever, let it be the first and chief care of an actor who aspires to shine in his profession, to discover where, in all his characters, the author has intended any change of passions. For, unless the passion is first known, how is it possible it should be painted?</P>
<P><HI>Joy</HI>, for instance, is the passion, in the fol∣lowing transport of <HI>Torrismond</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>—"Oh heaven! she pities me.</L>
<L>"And pity, still, fore-runs approaching love;</L>
<L>"As lightning does the thunder.—Tune your harps,</L>
<L>"Ye angels! to that sound: and thou, my heart!</L>
<L>"Make room—to entertain the flowing joy!</L></Q>
<P>When the actor has discovered, that the passion in this place is <HI>joy</HI>, he must not, upon any account, attempt the utterance of one single word, till he has first com∣pelled
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
his fancy to conceive an idea of joy. And it would be his natural, though most difficult way, to endeavour the effacement of all note, or image of himself, and for∣cibly bind down his fancy to suppose, that he is, really, <HI>Torrismond</HI>—that he is in love with <HI>Leonora</HI>, and has been blessed, be∣yond his hope, by her kind declaration in his favor.</P>
<P>But there is a shorter road to the same end, and it shall, in due place, be shewn him. When he believes himself possessed of such an idea of joy, that would not fail to warm a strong conception; let him not imagine the impression rightly hit, till he has ex∣amined both his face and air, in a long, upright, looking glass; for <HI>there</HI>, only, will he meet with a sincere and undeceiv∣able test of his having strongly enough, or too slackly, adapted his fancy to the pur∣pose before him.</P>
<P>If, for example, his brow, in the glass, appears bent, or cloudy, his neck bowing, and relaxed, his breast not thrown grace∣fully back, and elate; if he sees his arm swing languid, or hang motionless, his
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
back-bone reposed, or unstraitened, and the joints of his hip, knee, and ancle, not strong∣braced, by swelling out the sinews to their full extent. All, or any of these spiritless signs, in the glass, may convince him, that he has too faintly conceived the impression: and, at once, to <HI>prove</HI> it, to his own full satisfaction, let him, at that time, endea∣vour to speak out, with a voice as high raised as he pleases, he will find, that, in that languid state of muscles, he can never bring it to sound <HI>joy:</HI> no, not though the sense of the words were all rapture; but, in spite of the utmost possible strain upon his lungs, his tone will be too sullen, or too mournful, and carry none of the music of sprightliness. But if, on the contrary, he has hit the conception exactly, he will have the pleasure, in that case, to observe, in the glass, that his forehead appears open, and raised, his eye smiling, and sparkling, his neck will be stretched and erect, without stiffness, as if it would add new height to his stature; his breast will be inflated, and majestically backened; his back-bone erect, and all the joints of
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
his arm, wrist, fingers, hip, knee, and ancle, will be high-strung and braced boldly. And <HI>now</HI>, if he attempts to speak <HI>joy</HI>, all the spirit of the passion will as∣cend in his accents, and the very tone of his voice will seem to out-rapture the meaning.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>reason</HI> of all this, it is as clear as the consequence. For these are nature's own marks and impressions on the body, in cases where the passion is produced by involuntary emotions.—And, when natural impressions are imitated exactly by art, the effect of such art must seem natural.</P>
<P>But, because difficulties would arise, in the practice of so strong a conception, before fancy is become ductile enough to assume such impressions at will (as in the instance of <HI>joy</HI>, now before us), the actor, taking the <HI>shorter road</HI>, above promised him, may help his defective idea, in a moment, by annexing at once, the <HI>look</HI> to the <HI>idea</HI>, in the very instant, while he is bracing his nerves into springiness: for so, the image, the look, and the muscles, all concurring <HI>at once</HI>, to the purpose, their effect will be
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
the same, as if each had succeeded another progressively.</P>
<P>To convince himself of the natural truth of these principles, he has nothing to do but, first, to speak the foregoing example of <HI>joy</HI>, with his look grave, or idle, and his nerves eased or languid; and immedi∣ately afterwards repeat the same speech, with a smile of delight in his eye, with his joints all high-braced, and his sinews ex∣tended—his own ear will become his ac∣knowledged instructor.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION II. Of GRIEF. DEFINITION. GRIEF is Disappointment, void of Hope.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a mournful and unstruggling resig∣nation of defence, to apprehension of ca∣lamity: and therefore must require, to express it rightly, a sad look, careless air, and voice unraised, and indolent.</P>
<P>For a speech, wherein this melancholy reverse of the foregoing passion is expressed,
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
to the wish of an actor, we may borrow a second time from the same <HI>Torrismond</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"But, I have been in such a dismal place!</L>
<L>"Where joy ne'er enters, which the sun ne'er cheers,</L>
<L>"Bound in with darkness, overspread with damps,</L>
<L>"Where I have seen—if I could say, I saw—</L>
<L>"The good old king—majestic, ev'n in bands!</L>
<L>"And, 'midst his griefs, most venerably great!</L>
<L>"By a dim, winking lamp, that feebly broke</L>
<L>"The gloomy vapors, he lay, stretch'd along,</L>
<L>"Upon th' unwholsome ground, his eyes cast low;</L>
<L>"And, ever and anon, a silent tear</L>
<L>"Stole down, and trickled from his aged cheek."</L></Q>
<P>A speaker, who would distress his imagi∣nation into a complete assumption of the sorrow expressed in these lines, will first consider, that <HI>grief</HI> being a passion the most opposite in nature to joy, his look, that was before enlivened, must, now, in a moment, take a mournful and declined impression. His muscles must fall loose, and be unbraced into the habit of languor. And, then, no sooner shall his nerves have formed themselves to this lax disposition, for complying with the melancholy de∣mand of the sentiments, than his voice also will associate its sound to the plaintive re∣signation of his gesture, and the result, both
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
in air and accent, will be the most moving resemblance of a heart-felt and passionate sorrow. Whereas, let him endeavour with all possible industry, so to sadden his voice, without a previous accommodation of his look, and his sinews, to the faintness of the image intended, his tone will be hard, austere, and unfeeling—and more and more remote from the true sound of distress, in exact proportion to the spring he had re∣tained on his nerves, and the vigor that had over-animated his eye, or too ardently quickened his gesture.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION III. Of FEAR. DEFINITION. FEAR is Grief, discerning and avoiding Danger.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an apprehensive, but unsinewed struggle, betwixt caution and despair: It cannot therefore be expressed but by a look alarmed and watchful, with a voice and air unanimated.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="17"/>Take, for example of this passion, the fol∣lowing short speech, from <HI>Clarence</HI>, in Shakespear's <HI>Richard the Third</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"O! I have pass'd a miserable night!</L>
<L>"So full of fearful dreams! of ugly sights!</L>
<L>"That, as I am a christian faithful man,</L>
<L>"I would not spend another such a night,</L>
<L>"Tho' 'twere to buy a world of happy days!</L>
<L>"So full of dismal terror was the time!"</L></Q>
<P>Here, an actor, who would impress his imagination with a natural idea of fear, will most effectually represent it, by as∣suming the same languor, in look and in muscles, that was just now described, as peculiar to <HI>grief</HI>. For then, if he would strike out, in an instant, the distinction by which fear is diversified from sorrow, let him only, in place of that resigned, plain∣tive, passive distress, that is proper to <HI>grief</HI>, add (without altering the relax'd state of his nerves) a starting, apprehensive and listening alarm to his look, keeping his eyes widely stretched, but unfixed; his mouth still, and open; his steps light and shifting,—yet, his joints unbraced, faint, nerveless. And, then will his whole air
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
express the true picture of Fear, and his voice, too, <HI>sound</HI> it significantly.</P>
<P>But still—This caution let the thinking actor, forever, take care to remember.— That he is not to begin to utter, even so much as a single word, till he has first re∣flected on, and felt the idea; and then adapted his look, and his nerves to express it. But as soon as this pathetic sensation has strongly and fully imprinted his fancy, let him then, and never a moment before, attempt to give the speech due utterance. So shall he always hit the right and touch∣ing sensibility of tone, and move his au∣ditors impressingly; whereas, should he, with an unfeeling volubility of cadence, hurry on from one over-leaped distinction to another, without due adaption of his look and muscles, to the meaning proper to the passion, he will never speak to hearts; nor move himself, nor any of his audience, beyond the simple and unani∣mating verbal sense, without the spirit of the writer.</P>
<P>Besides the reputation of a fine and pathetic speaker, and a feeler and inspirer of the
<PB N="21" REF="19" MS="y"/>
passions, he will derive another benefit and grace, from such a natural practice; for the time which it must necessarily take, so to conform his look and nerves to the suc∣cessive changes of the passions, will preserve his voice, at every turn, by giving it due <HI>rests</HI>; allowing frequent and repeated op∣portunities for a recovery of its wasted strength, in easy and unnoted <HI>breathings:</HI> And yet, all such beautiful and pensive pausing places, will at the same time ap∣pear to an audience, but the strong and natural attitudes of thinking, and the in∣ward agitations of a heart that is, in truth, disturbed and shaken. Whereas, the glib, round, rolling emptiness of an unpausing insignificance in speaking (far from paint∣ing, or resembling nature), represents no image at all, to a discerning audience, but that of a full player's memory; pouring out its over measure, with no meaning, from a voice that neither touches, nor is touched by character.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>APPLICATION IV. Of ANGER. DEFINITION. ANGER is Pride provoked beyond Regard of Caution.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a fierce and unrestrained effusion of reproach and insult: It must therefore be expressed impatiently, by a firey propension in the eye, with a disturbed and threatning air, and with a voice strong, swift, and often interrupted by high swells of choak∣ing indignation.</P>
<P>To explain this passion, two examples will be necessary; the first, not so much for containing the passion itself, as a great ac∣tor's rules, for feeling and expressing it 2with nature's spirit and propriety. And I do this right to Shakespear, with a double pleasure, as the instance carries with it a clear evidence, how much the play-house old tradition wrongs his memory; for they report him a performer of no power or compass, and but of low rate in his pro∣fession, as to <HI>action</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="21"/>The second speech shall be for an example of the passion, with an explanation of two different modes, whereby nature has dis∣tinguished its expression.</P>
<P>Shakespear's comes first; and is, at once, a rule and example.</P>
<Q><L>"Now imitate the action of a tiger;</L>
<L>"Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood;</L>
<L>"Lend sierce and dreadful aspect to the eye:</L>
<L>"Set the teeth close, and stretch the nostril wide,</L>
<L>"Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit,</L>
<L>"To its full height."</L></Q>
<P>It were impossible to draw a picture of <HI>anger</HI> more naturally, or an instruction more complete and clear for expressing it.</P>
<P>First, The sinews being braced strong, thro' all the joints of the body, the blood (as a consequence unavoidable) is <HI>summoned up</HI>, that is, impelled into violent motion.</P>
<P>Secondly, The look becomes adapted, and adds <HI>fierceness</HI> to the passion, by the fire that flashes from the <HI>eye</HI>.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The <HI>setting</HI> of the <HI>teeth</HI>, and wide expansion of the <HI>nostrils</HI>, follow naturally; because inseparable from an enraged bent of the <HI>eye-brow</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="22"/>And, Fourthly, The breath being <HI>held hard</HI>, as interrupted or restrained by the tumul∣tuous precipitation of the spirits, they must necessarily become inflamed themselves, and will communicate their ardor to the voice and motion.</P>
<P>And thus, this passion of Anger is <HI>bent up</HI> to its full height, as Shakespear, with allusion to the spring upon the sinews, hath expressed it.</P>
<P>I explain this passage to demonstrate his great skill in acting: and in hopes, the player's observation that this favorite ge∣nius of their own profession had ideas of the art (so plainly founded on the very principles sustained in this essay), will recommend it with more weight from the partiality of their affection.</P>
<P>But to return to my own notes. It here deserves reflexion, by how very small a se∣paration nature has disjoined the out-lines of two passions, seemingly the least con∣formable to one another. Few would ima∣gine, that the lineaments of Joy and Anger should unite in any point of strong resem∣blance! And yet, it is evident, they only
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>
differ in a change of look: For, as to the intensely bracing up the nerves, <HI>that</HI> is the same, exactly, in both passions, and the sole distinction lies in this:—a <HI>smile</HI> upon the eye, in bodies strongly-braced, compels the voice to found of Joy—while <HI>frowns</HI>, in the same eye (without the smallest alte∣ration of muscles), immediately transform the gay sound to a dreadful one.</P>
<P>The second speech, which will be neces∣sary, to explain the natural difference above declared, relating to <HI>two modes</HI> of Anger, may be taken from the <HI>Orphan</HI>; and it is <HI>Chamont</HI> who speaks.</P>
<Q><L>—"I say, my sister's wrong'd;</L>
<L>"<HI>Monimia—my</HI> sister: born, as high,</L>
<L>"And noble, as <HI>Castalio</HI>. Do her justice,</L>
<L>"Or, by the gods! I'll lay a scene of blood,</L>
<L>"Shall make this dwelling horrible, to nature:</L>
<L>"I'll do't.*—Hark you, my lord!</L>
<L>"—Your son—Castalio—</L>
<L>"Take him to your closet, and there, teach him manners."</L></Q>
<P>Though the passion, throughout all this speech, is furious and intemperate Anger, yet nature has divided it into two such different tones of utterance, that though it would be impropriety, to a degree of folly,
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>
to pronounce that part foregoing the star, in the sixth line, any other way, than with a fierce, vindictive air, and voice high raised, insulting, and impatient—The re∣mainder (from that star) must, on the contrary, be expressed, by affectation of a low, constrained, and almost whispered composure, concealing a slow, smothered, inward rancor, by a muttered, ironical repression of the voice, strained through the teeth, in a pretended restraint of in∣dignation. And when, from such reliefs, as it were of passion, the rage breaks out again into shrill and exclamatory loud∣ness, the representation becomes movingly varied, and natural; and the voice seems to preserve a kind of musical modulation, even in madness.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION V. Of PITY. DEFINITION. PITY is active Grief for another's Af∣fliction.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a social sadness of heart, propelled by an auxiliary disposition of the spirits,
<PB N="27" REF="25" MS="y"/>
giving tension to impressed and straining muscles: It cannot therefore be expressed, but by a look of sorrow, with a braced and animated gesture.</P>
<P>Take the following example, from <HI>Belmour</HI> in the <HI>Fatal Extravagance</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"Oh! could I feel no misery but my own,</L>
<L>"How easy were it for this sword, to free me,</L>
<L>"From every anguish that embitters life!</L>
<L>"—But, when the grave has given <HI>my</HI> sorrows rest,</L>
<L>"Where shall my miserable <HI>wife</HI> find comfort?</L>
<L>"Unfriended, and alone, in want's bleak storm,</L>
<L>"Not all th' angelic virtues of her mind</L>
<L>"Will shield her from th' unpitying world's derision.</L>
<L>"Can it be kind to leave her so exposed?"</L></Q>
<P>If an actor should endeavour to touch the expressiveness of the passion conceived in this speech, without having previously adapted his look to the sensation peculiar to pity, he would never (though his voice were the finest and most musical in nature), be able to succeed in his purpose: for, his tone would be sometimes too earnest, and sharp, and sometimes too languid, and me∣lancholy.—But let him, first, strain his muscles into the tension, above required for expression of <HI>joy</HI>, and if, then, he add<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the look that is proper to <HI>grief</HI>, the result of
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
this mixed co-operation of contraries (of a visage peculiar to sorrow, with a spring on the muscles adapted to joy) will immedi∣ately produce the gesture, the voice, and the feeling expression of <HI>pity</HI>.—And the more strongly he braces his nerves, in op∣position to the distress that relaxes his look, the more beautifully will he touch the concern, till his utterance paints it, as one may say, to the ear.—For, by effect of a struggle, that will be formed in his mind, between the grief, that has softened his eye, and the force, that invigorates his muscles, there will arise a pathetic and trembling interruptedness of sensible sound, that must affect a whole audience, with a participated concern in the passion.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION VI. Of SCORN. DEFINITION. SCORN is negligent Anger.</HEAD>
<P>THAT is, anger against objects, which excite no esteem: It is therefore unbraced
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
into easiness. See an example in the fol∣lowing answer of <HI>Bajazet</HI> to <HI>Axalla</HI>'s de∣claration, from <HI>Tamerlane</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"Bear back thy fulsome greeting, to thy master;</L>
<L>"Tell him, I'll none on't.—</L>
<L>*Had he been a <HI>god</HI>,</L>
<L>"All his omnipotence could not restore</L>
<L>"The radiancy of majesty eclips'd.*</L>
<L>"For ought besides, it is not worth my care:</L>
<L>"The giver, and his gifts are both <HI>despis'd!</HI>"</L></Q>
<P>In this speech, the beginning and the end contain manifest scorn: But, in the middle part, which is therefore distinguished be∣tween two stars, the passion rises into ner∣vous and exclamatory violence.</P>
<P>All the rest, to be rightly expressed in the acting, will require the seeming contrast of an unsinewy slackness of muscles, to a look that flames with anger and insult.</P>
<P>There is, however, and a skilful actor will always remember to note it, a gayer and very different species of <HI>scorn</HI>, on less so∣lemn occasions, where the lowness of figure, or of power, in some slight, insignificant subject, or the unalarming impertinence of some vain, but not dangerous levity, only calls for a contempt, unconnected with
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
anger. And this lighter expression of scorn will be hit most effectually, by pre∣serving the same disposition of muscles, that was required in the other—but ac∣companied by a look that is smiling and placid, instead of the frown that took place in the former.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION VII. Of HATRED. DEFINITION. HATRED is restrained, yet lasting Anger.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a close, abhorrent, hostile disposition of the heart, averted by ill-will, but guard∣ed by precaution: To express it rightly, it demands a look of malice, with a gesture of restrained impatience.</P>
<P><HI>Bajazet</HI>, will give example in another speech, concerning <HI>Tamerlane</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"The <HI>Tartar</HI> is my bane—I cannot bear him,</L>
<L>"One heaven and earth, can never hold us, both.</L>
<L>"Still shall we hate, and, with defiance deadly,</L>
<L>"Keep rage alive—till one be lost, forever.</L>
<L>"As if two suns should meet, in the meridian,</L>
<L>"And strive, in firey combat, for the passage."</L></Q>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29" MS="y"/>Unless an actor has accustomed his reflexion to examine distinctions in passion, he will be surprized to be told in this place, that there is no other difference but the turn of an eye, in the expression of <HI>hatred</HI> and <HI>pity</HI>. Yet his experience will find it a palpable truth. For, first, pity, and hatred, both of them, require the same intense brace upon the joints and sinews; and then, the characterizing distinction between them, is this: (I mean <HI>only</HI> what regards their <HI>ex∣pression</HI>, that is, the outward marks they impress on the body)—Pity, by a look of inclination, implies affection, and desire to relieve: whereas, Hatred, by averting the visage, and accompanying that look of ab∣horrence with gestures of malice and dis∣approbation, proclaims animosity, and pur∣pose of mischief. The nerves must be braced in both passions alike; because Pity is earnest, and Hatred is earnest; and there∣fore the muscles, to express either passion (however opposite they may seem to each other), must be springy, and bent into promptitude.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="30"/>But the look must be different in each; because Pity is earnest for <HI>beneficence</HI>; and, therefore, the eye (which is the shew-glass of the soul) must be impressed with ideas of <HI>goodness:</HI> whereas Hatred is earnest for <HI>mischief</HI>; and the eye must, in consequence of a malignant intent in the will, reflect an image of meditated <HI>evil</HI>.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION VIII. Of JEALOUSY. DEFINITION. JEALOUSY is doubtful Anger, struggling against Faith and Pity.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a painful softness in the heart, resisted by a vindictive disposition in the spirits: It cannot, therefore, be expressed without a doubtful variation both in look and air, divided and suspended betwixt wavering passions.</P>
<P>But, there are two degrees of Jealousy, and they require different modes for their expression.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="31"/>So that two examples will be necessary; and <HI>Othello</HI> will supply us with them both.</P>
<P>We shall see in this that follows, that first stage of jealousy, which is alarmed, but <HI>doubtfully</HI> suspicious; and not, yet, con∣firmed into the violence of positive <HI>belief</HI>, and its warm consequences:
<Q><L>—"Why dost thou echo me?</L>
<L>"As if there were some monster in thy thought!</L>
<L>"Too hideous to be shewn!—Thou dost mean something</L>
<L>"—I heard thee say but now, thou lik'dst not <HI>that!</HI></L>
<L>"When Cassio left my wife.—What did'st not like?</L>
<L>"And, when I told thee, that he was my <HI>friend</HI>,</L>
<L>"And went a <HI>wooing</HI> for me—with thy brow</L>
<L>"Bent and purs'd up, thy answer was—<HI>Indeed!</HI></L>
<L>"If thou dost love me, tell me—what thou thought'st."</L></Q></P>
<P>For expressing, in a natural manner, these unfixed, apprehensive, reluctant, first dawn∣ings of jealousy, the brace upon the nerves must be but comformable to the unsettled idea. It must be half bent, and half lan∣guid. The look, too, under the same in∣conclusive alarm, must act its part with the indolent muscles; that is, it must partake of two opposite passions; Anger, as disposed to catch flame, under sense of such in∣jury; and Pity, as unwilling to give way
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>
to distrust, against an object so endeared by affection.</P>
<P>The other species, or rather degree of this passion, is, where Jealousy extracts confir∣mation, from appearances, which concur toward a <HI>proof</HI>.</P>
<P>In this case, the nerves must assume the strong brace, that is proper to Anger: And the look must express a turbulent <HI>mixture</HI> of anguish, from a struggle between fury and sorrow. See <HI>Othello</HI> again.</P>
<Q><L>"I think my wife is honest—and think she is not!</L>
<L>"I think that thou art just, and think thou art not!</L>
<L>"I'll have <HI>full proof</HI>.—My name, that was as fresh,</L>
<L>"As chaste Diana's face, is, now, grown black—</L>
<L>"Like my own visage!—If there be cords or knives,</L>
<L>"Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,</L>
<L>"I'll not endure it.—Would I were satisfy'd."</L></Q>
<P>We see in this speech, <HI>doubt</HI> inflamed into agony. It is still, indeed, distrust; but it is, at the same time, indignation and bitterness.—And this is the utmost pitch whereto Jealousy (as Jealousy) can by na∣ture extend itself.—For the least step be∣yond it, is Anger; which unless mixed with, and restrained by, some tempering conceit of uncertainty, is no longer the
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
Jealousy we are considering, but a distinct and new passion; the effect, it is true, of the former; yet, itself quite of a different species.</P>
<P>So that Jealousy can be divided no farther, than into the two foregoing distinctions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION IX. Of WONDER. DEFINITION. WONDER is inquisitive Fear.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an ebb of spirits rushing back upon the heart; but leaving an alarm upon the muscles, that invigorates them towards de∣fence and opposition. No actor can imi∣tate this passion with its natural propriety and force, without dividing its idea into the two following degrees of distinction:</P>
<P>The first degree is <HI>amazement</HI>—the second is <HI>astonishment</HI>.</P>
<P>In <HI>amazement</HI>, the conception catching alarm from the image of something strange∣ly or unnaturally terrible, the nerves, upon a start of apprehension, brace, at once, into
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
an involuntary rigor of intenseness, under a defensive disposition of the will, that would resist and repel the object.</P>
<P>But, in <HI>astonishment</HI>, the recoil of the ani∣mal spirits, hurried back in too precipitate a motion, drives the blood upon the heart with such oppressive redundance, as, re∣tarding circulation, almost stagnates the vital progression; and, arresting the breath, eyes, gesture, and every power and faculty of the body, occasions such an interruption of their several uses, as would bring on an actual <HI>cessation</HI>; but, that the reason, strug∣gling slowly to relieve the apprehension, gives a kind of hesitative articulation to the utterance, and a gradual motion and re∣covery to the look, the limbs, and the countenance.</P>
<P>In the following lines, from <HI>Hamlet</HI>, we shall see an instance of the first degree of Wonder; while it reaches only to <HI>amaze∣ment</HI>; and suspends, not stagnates, the free motion of the blood and spirits:
<Q>"O, day, and night!—but this is wond'rous strange!"</Q></P>
<P>And, again:
<Q><L>"Angels! and ministers of grace! defend me!</L>
<L>"Be thou a spirit of light—or goblin damn'd;</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="35" MS="y"/>"Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell;</L>
<L>"Be thy intents wicked or charitable;—</L>
<L>"Thou com'st in such a questionable <HI>shape</HI>,</L>
<L>"That I <HI>will</HI> speak to thee!"</L></Q></P>
<P>There is manifest, in the beginning of this <HI>speech</HI>, the starting spring upon the nerves, that follows the first shock of ap∣prehension.</P>
<P>In the middle is discerned, as plainly, the slow, struggling, reasoning recollection of the shaken understanding.</P>
<P>And in the two concluding lines, the reso∣lution of recovered firmness, to examine and determine stedfastly.</P>
<P>But in examples, where the passion rises to <HI>astonishment</HI>, as in this below, from <HI>Bel∣mour</HI>; see an almost total deprivation, for the time, of all the powers of sense and motion; except only, that, exerted rea∣son, laboring against oppressive congelation, barely seems to hold breath in, by force, and make life sensible.</P>
<Q><L>—"I feel my blood</L>
<L>"Cool and grow thick; as melted lead flows heavy,</L>
<L>"And hardens in its motion.—A little longer,</L>
<L>"And I, who have a heart already marble—</L>
<L>"Shall petrify throughout—and be—a statue."</L></Q>
<P><PB N="38" REF="36"/>It would be impossible, after an actor had conceived an idea correspondent to the pic∣ture, in the words in this, not to impress every lineament of the passion upon his look, and every attitude of it upon his gesture; and then, the tone of his voice, concurring, cannot fail to sound the slow, conflicting struggle of <HI>astonishment</HI>.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION X. Of LOVE. DEFINITION. LOVE is Desire kept temperate by Re∣verence.</HEAD>
<P>IT is expanded softness, in the heart; in∣dulged attachment, in the fancy; and an awe (from fear to be distasteful where we wish to please), upon the spirits. It can never, therefore, rightly be expressed, with∣out a look of apprehensive tenderness, that softens a high-braced and animated air, and casts a modest cloud of diffidence over too quick a sense of transport. And thus we are come, at last, to a passion, the true
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>
name whereof might be <HI>Legion</HI>; for it in∣cludes all the other, in all their degrees and varieties. It has therefore been post∣poned, and kept to bring up the rear; tho' from the weight and extent of its influence, it ought to have taken place in the front of the number.</P>
<P>There is, however, independent of its au∣xiliary and occasional passions, a distinct air, gesture, look, and manner of speaking, peculiar to Love, in its serene and unruf∣fled impressiveness. And because there are not many actors, in whom nature has done all that appears necessary, for expressing the genteelness and the softness, together with the freedom and the fire, which unite their contraries, of setting off the spirit of this passion, it is necessary to reflect a little on the reason, why it is common to see Love unfeelingly, affectedly, and even ridicu∣lously acted in our theatres.</P>
<P>The lazy cause is, want of <HI>tenderness</HI>, or at least of <HI>application</HI>, to conceive the true idea. For this passion, more than any other, lends a tongue to every look, and sheds an eloquence on every motion. It cannot
<PB N="40" REF="38" MS="y"/>
bear, then, a cold, formal emptiness; a big, broad, mellow troll of smooth, unani∣mated wordiness. It asks for <HI>soul</HI>, in thought, air, movement. It exacts such strict confederacy between the heart, the mien, the eye, and tongue, that it dis∣dains to pardon a bold, voluble, and lec∣ture-like (however musical and sounding) insignificancy.</P>
<P>The idea then to be conceived by one, who would express Love elegantly, is that of Joy, combined with Fear.</P>
<P>It is a conscious and triumphant swell of <HI>hope</HI>, intimidated by respectful apprehension of offending, where we long to seem agree∣able. It is the exhalation of a soft desire, which, to the warmth inspired by wishes, joins the modesty of a submissive doubt∣fulness.</P>
<P>It is complaint, made amiable by graceful∣ness; reproach, endeared by tenderness; and rapture, awed by reverence.</P>
<P>Without a previous fixed idea of the pas∣sion, in this native light, the finest of all human voices would in vain attempt to touch it tenderly. And this might be im∣mediately
<PB N="41" REF="39" MS="y"/>
found evident to the attentive actor's ear, in making trial on some speech, like this of <HI>Edgar</HI>, in the Tragedy of <HI>Athelwold</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"Why have those piercing eyes, so ill distinguish'd</L>
<L>"The reverence of my ardor?—License and Freedom,</L>
<L>"Would, in <HI>your presence</HI>, be dissolv'd to <HI>awe</HI>,</L>
<L>"And flow in sighs, to soften you.—This hand!</L>
<L>"Oh! give it me—and I will swear, upon it,</L>
<L>"That my charm'd spirits never rose, till now,</L>
<L>"In such a tide of ecstasy!—that heaven</L>
<L>"Has left your <HI>sex</HI> in shade, to light up <HI>you</HI>,</L>
<L>"With every grace, that swells desire in mortals,</L>
<L>"Or gives your <HI>guardian angel</HI> pride, to view you!"</L></Q>
<P>Here, if the nerves are braced, with proper warmth, to the high pitch of Joy, and the inclining <HI>look</HI> divided, gracefully, betwixt a tender <HI>fear</HI>, and a triumphant <HI>pleasure</HI>, every accent will confess the passion, in a soft, impressive touchingness. Whereas, without such previous disposition for at∣taining the <HI>idea</HI>, the vague, undirected tone, would sometimes sound too faint, sometimes too harsh; and always insincere, declama∣tory, and unstriking.</P>
<P>I have done with the application of the general Principle to Particular Examples of the Passions.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="40"/>I proceed to a justification of the mecha∣nism in the rules foregoing, by demonstrating its foundation on clear, natural causes.</P>
<P>I will only interpose a short digression for discovering the reason, <HI>why</HI> it is so rare to see an actor elegantly qualified to represent a Love part on the theatre.</P>
<P>I said before, and shall produce the proof immediately, that Love includes, occasion∣ally, all other passions.</P>
<P>He, then, who is not master of a power to represent them ALL, in the distinct pro∣priety of <HI>each</HI>, must, of necessity (so far as his defect in any one of them extends), be found an incomplete and disapproved sustainer of a Lover's character.</P>
<P>And that every other of the Passions hitherto described, occurs, occasionally, in that com∣prehensive <HI>one</HI> of Love, see proofs in these plain instances:</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>QUESTIONS and ANSWERS Demonstrating the natural Causes of the Me∣chanism in the Rules foregoing.</HEAD>
<P><HI>QUESTION</HI> I. Why is Joy expressed by muscles intense, and a smile in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Joy is pride possessed of triumph. Pride and triumph give inflated ideas, and high-raised and bold conceptions.— But the muscles must-be intense when they express elevation; because relaxed nerves are peculiar to depressed conception.
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>
And the eye must be smiling, before it can paint satisfac∣tion: because a frown would imply discontent; and to con∣ceive Joy, with displeasure, is a false, because, an unnatural <HI>impression</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> II. Why is Anger expressed with muscles intense, and a frown in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Anger is pride provoked beyond regard of caution— Uncautious pride exults in menaces and arrogance.—But, neither arrogance nor menaces can consist with relaxation of the nerves; because, slack muscles, are a consequence of weak and faint, not boastful and avowed ideas. The eye, too, in this passion, is over-clouded by a frown; because, it catches sense of indignation, from vindictive and distasteful images; and not to show that outward mark of the mind, agitation, inwardly, would be assuming a DISGUISE, to cover sensibility;—a prudence, never natural in anger; because, its great characteristic property, is rash and open insult.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> III. Why is Pity expressed by muscles intense, and a sadness in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Pity is active grief, for another's afflictions. But we can never sincerely <HI>mourn</HI> distresses when we do not feel them touchingly.—Whatever we so feel, we <HI>look</HI>—by natural in∣clination, and necessity. No visage, but a <HI>sad</HI> one, therefore, can consist with the distress of pity.—But the muscles, to ex∣press this passion, must be braced; because, whatever we pity, we intensely wish to give relief to; and, since the will, when active, compels active fibres; it remains a natural consequence, that this seeming contrariety between the ges∣ture and the look, is the true medium to express compassion; for being nature's own effect, when she impresses marks of pity, in her usual manner; art, assuming the same out∣ward springs to work by, cannot fail to represent <HI>her, with exactness</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="48" MS="y"/><HI>Quest.</HI> IV. Why is Hatred expressed by muscles intense, and aversion in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Hatred is restrained, yet lasting anger. Anger in∣flames the will, and as the will, becoming active, actuates the <HI>muscles</HI>, they must necessarily be strained hard; and prompt to violent exertion, when they would express this passion properly. But then, as it is anger not thrown out, but patient, covered, and restrained; the <HI>eye</HI> withdraws it∣self from a distasteful object, to imply <HI>aversion</HI> in restraint of fury. And herein consists the natural distinction that paints Hatred, on the <HI>outward</HI> lineaments.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> V. Why is Wonder expressed by muscles intense, and an awful <HI>alarm</HI> in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Wonder is inquisitive fear. As it is inquisitive, it is stedfast, and demands firm muscles. —But as it is fear, it cannot justly be expressed, without the marks of appre∣hension, and alarm—Were this alarm a too-disturbed one, full of motion and anxiety; it would paint Fear, instead of Wonder; and would carry no consistence with braced muscles. It is, therefore, firmly nerved, because inqui∣sitive with purpose of defence: And so, this application of <HI>alarm</HI>, with resolution to examine stedfastly, must constitute a nervous, awful, fixed attentiveness; and give the picture of the passion naturally.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> VI. Why is Love expressed by muscles intense, and a respectful <HI>attachment</HI> in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Love is desire kept temperate by reverence—Desire must be attached; and as, in love, its object is a visible one, desire of objects visible must shew itself, most plainly, in the eye.—But then, our fear to give distaste, attempering desire with <HI>reverence</HI>, creates respectful softness in the look and attitude. And this external softness being strengthened, by
<PB N="51" REF="49" MS="y"/>
an inward brace upon the nerves (the natural consequence of hope and joy), enlivening reverence by effusion of a spark∣ling pleasure, there is transmitted to the eye, the ear, and heart, of an attentive audience, the same impression, which the actor's spirits are impelled by.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> VII. Why is Grief expressed by neither muscles or look intense, but <HI>both</HI> languid?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Grief is disappointment void of hope. But muscles braced intense imply hope strongly; and a spirited vivacity in the eye is the effect of pleasure and elevation.—These are naturally consistent with a passage that <HI>depresses</HI>, which grief manifestly does: Because, depression slackens all the nerves, nerves unbraced deject the look, and air, in necessary con∣sequence; and, therefore, a relaxed mien, and languid eye, must form the <HI>truest picture</HI> of a <HI>natural sorrow</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> VIII. Why is Fear expressed by languid look and muscles, with <HI>alarm</HI> in eye and motion?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Fear is grief discerning and avoiding danger.—As it is grief, it must depress the spirits, and unbrace the muscles; whence the languid air becomes adapted and characteristic.— But, as it is a grief, not careless and resigned, but appre∣hensive, fugitive and starting, it demands a lightness in the motion, with a watchful, though unanimated sharpness in the eye; because, the fancy has conceived idea of threatening mischief; but the object, overcharging the imagination, has relaxed the unconcurring fibres into a debility, unable to obey the will, which, therefore, but <HI>evades</HI>, and not <HI>resists</HI> the danger.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> IX. Why is Scorn expressed by languid muscles; with a <HI>smile</HI> upon the eye in the light species, or a <HI>frown</HI> to hit the serious.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="50" MS="y"/><HI>Answ.</HI> Scorn is negligent anger. It insinuates, therefore, by a voluntary slackness, or disarming of the nerves, a known, or a concluded absence of all power in the insulted object, even to make defence seem necessary.—And the unbraced muscles are assisted in this show of contemptuous disregard, by an affected smile upon the eye; because slack nerves, if, at the same time, the look were also languid, would too much resemble <HI>sorrow</HI>, or even <HI>fear</HI>; whereas, the purpose is disdain and insult—And though in more provoking, <HI>serious</HI> cases, where the scorn admits disturbance, it assumes some sense of <HI>anger</HI>; it must, still, retain the slack, unguarded languor on the nerves, lest it should seem to have conceived impressions of some estimable, or important weightiness, where its <HI>design</HI> is <HI>utter</HI> disregard and negligence.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> X. Why is Jealousy expressed by muscles intense, and the look pensive—or by the look intense, and <HI>muscles languid</HI>, interchangeably?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Jealousy is doubtful anger struggling against faith and pity—It is a tenderness resisted by resentment of suspected in∣jury; and thence, the <HI>nerves</HI>, braced strong, imply deter∣mination of revenge and punishment.—While, at the same time, a soft, pensive hesitation in the eye, confesses a reluc∣tance at the heart to part with, or efface, a gentle and in∣dulged idea.</P>
<P>Sometimes again, it is rage at a concluded infidelity—And then the eye receives, and flashes out the sparklings of in∣flamed ideas; while the muscles, counteracting the will's violence, from a repressive disposition of the heart, grow slack, and lose their spring; and so disarm, or mollify, en∣raged imagination.</P>
<P>And from this unsettled wavering in the ballance of the pur∣pose, where the heart and judgment weigh each other, and both scales, by turns, preponderate, is deduced a <HI>glowing</HI> picture of this passion.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="51" MS="y"/>I have travelled, now, through ten pa∣thetic stages, where an actor must not stop for rest, as in his other journies, but for labor; and such a labor will be truly find it (if he enters naturally into the demand of those strong passions), that neither mind nor body can be capable of chusing a more healthfully-fatiguing exercise.</P>
<P>And this remark brings into my remem∣brance, a great and general mistake among the players, at <HI>rehearsal</HI>, where it is their common practice to mutter over their parts inwardly, and keep <HI>in</HI> their voices, with a mis-imagined purpose of preserving them against their evening <HI>acting</HI>—Whereas, the surest, natural means of strengthening their delivery, would be, to warm, de∣phlegm, and clarify the thorax and wind∣pipe, by exerting (the more frequently the better) their fullest power of utterance; thereby to open and remove all hesitation, roughness, or obstruction, and to tune their voices, by effect of such continual ex∣ercise, into habitual mellowness, and ease of compass and inflexion; just from the same reason, that an active body is more strong and healthy, than a sedentary one.</P>
