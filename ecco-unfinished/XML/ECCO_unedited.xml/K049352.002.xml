<HEAD>SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Its SITUATION. EXTENT. DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>SCOTLAND, or North-Britain, lying be∣tween the fifty-fourth and fifty-ninth degrees of North latitude, extends about two hun∣dred and seventy-eight miles in length, the breadth amounting in some places to near one hundred; containing an area of twenty-seven thousand, seven hundred, ninety-four miles. To the south it borders upon England: on the north, east, and west, it is washed by the Deucaledonian, German, and Irish seas. The first and great divi∣sion of this country is that of distinguishing be∣tween the Lowlands and the Highlands, which were originally inhabited by two nations that widely differed from each other in language, garb, man∣ners, customs, and disposition. These differences still subsist; though the families of both are now intimately blended together, by means of those
<PB N="2" REF="40"/>
alliances and marriages that in the course of many hundred years must have happened among peo∣ple connected by mutual interest, and living un∣der the same laws and government. Notwith∣standing this communication, a national and ran∣corous prejudice still prevails between the High∣landers and people of the Lowlands. The High∣lands engross more than one half of Scotland; extending from Dumbartonshire to the most nor∣thern part of the island, a space of two hundred miles in length, and in breadth from fifty to an hundred. This tract, however, includes several extensive districts of low, fruitful ground, inha∣bited by people who are in all respects different from the mountaineers. Nothing can be more savage and horrendous to the eye of a stranger, than the appearance of the Highlands, composed of blue rocks and dusky mountains, heaped upon one another even above the clouds, their inter∣stices rendered impassable by bogs, their sides em∣browned with heath, and their summits covered with snow, which lies all the year unthawed, pouring from their jagged sides a thousand tor∣rents and roaring cataracts that fall into gloomy vales or glens below, some of them so narrow, deep, and dismal, as to be altogether impenetrable by the rays of the sun: yet even these mountains are in some places sloped into agreeable green hills fit for pasture, and skirted or interspersed with pleasant traths or vallies capable of cultiva∣tion. The mountaineers may surely boast of their being unadulterated by any foreign mixture; whereas their neighbours are a strange medley or Britons, Saxons, Danes, Norwegians, French, English, and Highlanders. It may be unnecessary to observe, that the Lowlanders of Scotland speak an antient dialect of the English language, inter∣larded with many terms and idioms which they
<PB N="3" REF="50"/>
borrowed immediately from France, in a long course of correspondence with that kingdom: they likewise copy their southern neighbours in their houses, equipage, habit, industry, and appli∣cation to commerce; while the Highlanders, for the most part, retain their original ferocity, sloth, and martial disdain of all lucrative employ∣ments. Such are the differences that naturally appear between these two classes: but the regu∣lations of society know no distinction. They are all comprehended under the name of Scots, go∣verned by the same laws, and tried by the same judges; and whatever may be their dissensions at home, they always, when abroad, acknowledge, and assist one another as friends and countrymen. Some authors have divided Scotland into that part which lies to the southward of the Frith, and that which lies to the northward: but the true division is like that of England into shires, counties, stewartries or bailiwicks, of which there are above forty within the kingdom of Scotland.</P>

<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>The face of this country exhibits a very moun∣tainous appearance, especially to the west and northward: but, at the same time, it displays many large and long tracts of plain ground fit for all the purposes of agriculture. It is divided from east to west by a chain of huge mountains, known by the name of Grants-Bain, or the Grampian Hills. There is another chain called the Pentland Hills, which run through Lothian, and join the mountains of Tweedale: a third, called Lammer Muir, rising near the eastern coast, runs westward through the Merse: but besides these, there is a vast number of detached hills and mountains re∣markable for their stupendous height and declivity.
<PB N="4" REF="60"/>
There is no country in the world better supplied than Scotland with rivers, lakes, rivulets, and fountains. Over and above the principal rivers of Tweed, Forth, Clyde, Tay, and Spey, there is an infinity of smaller streams that contribute to the beauty, convenience, and advantage of the kingdom. Tweed takes its rise from the borders of Annandale; serves as a boundary between Scot∣land and England; and, after a long, serpentine, course, discharges itself into the sea at Berwick. Forth, the largest river in Scotland, rises in Mon∣teith near Callendar, passes by Stirling, and after a course of five and twenty leagues, runs into thearm of the sea called the Frith of Forth, which divides the coast of Lothian from Fife. Clyde takes its rise from Errick Hill, in the shire of Lanerk, traverses the shire of Clydesdale, to which it gives a name, washes the city of Glasgow, widens in its assage to the castle of Dumbarton, and forms the Firth of Clyde adjoining to the Irish sea. Tay, another large river, derives its source from Loch-Tay in Braidalbin, and after a south-east course, discharges itself into the sea below Dundee. Spay, or Spey, issues from a lake of the same name in Badenoch, and running a north-easterly course, falls into the German ocean, near Aberdour. Some of the fresh-water lakes are beautiful pieces of water incredibly deep, and surprizingly ex∣tended. There are several large forests of fir in Scotland, and a great number of woods, which, however, produce very little timber of any con∣sequence; but the country in general is bare of trees, and in many places neither tree, shrub, nor any kind of plantation is to be seen. The case has been otherwise of old; for huge trunks of trees are often dug from under-ground in almost every part of the kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>AIR. CLIMATE. SOIL. WATER.</HEAD>
<P>In the North of Scotland, the day at Mid∣summer is lengthened out to eighteen hours and five minutes; so that the shortest night does not exceed five hours and forty-five minutes: the night and day, in winter, is long and short in the same proportion. The air of this kingdom is ge∣nerally moist and temperate, except upon the tops of high mountains covered with eternal snow, where it is cold, keen, and piercing. In other parts it is tempered by warm vapours from the sea, which environs it on three sides, and runs far up into the land by friths, inlets, and indentations. This neighbourhood of the sea, and the frequency of hills and mountains, produce a constant undu∣lation in the air, and many hard gales, that purify the climate, which is for the most part agreeable and healthy. Scotland affords a great variety of soil in different parts of the country, which, being hilly, is in general best adapted to pasturage: not, but that the Lowlands are as fertile, and if pro∣perly inclosed and manured, would yield as good crops of wheat, as any grounds in the island of Great-Britain. The water in Scotland is remark∣ably pure, light, and agreeable to the stomach: but, over and above that which is used for the ordinary purposes of life, here are many medi∣cinal springs of great note and wonderful efficacy, which shall be described in the account of parti∣cular places.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRODUCTIONS: MINERAL, VEGETABLE, ANIMAL.</HEAD>
<P>Scotland abounds with quarries of free-stone easily worked, which enable the people to build
<PB N="6" REF="80"/>
elegant houses, both in town and country, at a small expence, especially as they have plenty of lime stone, and labour very cheap. The east, west, and northern parts of the country produce excellent coal; and where this is wanting, the natives burn turf and peat for fuel: but there are some places where the poor people can find no other firing than cow-dung, which they care∣fully dry and deposit for this purpose; nay, for want of this convenience and comfort, they are often obliged in the winter to sit and spin by the light of lamps in their cow-houses, which are kept warm by the breath and perspiration of their cattle. Chrystals, variegated pebbles, and pre∣cious stones, are found in many parts of Scotland; talc, flint, and sea-shells, fuller's earth, potter's clay, and metals in great plenty. The country produces iron and copper ore, a prodigious quan∣tity of lead mixed with a large proportion of silver; and in some places little bits of solid gold are gathered in brooks immediately after torrents.</P>
<P>The Lowlands of Scotland, when duly culti∣vated, yield rich harvests of wheat; and indeed it must be owned that many parts of this king∣dom rival the best spots of England in agri∣culture: but these improvements have not yet advanced into the western and northern extremi∣ties of the island, where we see nothing but scanty harvests of oats, rye, and barley. The Highlands are so defective even in these, that they are fain to import supplies of oatmeal from Ireland and Liverpool. This scarcity, however, we must not impute to the barrenness of the soil, so much as to the sloth and poverty of the tenants, oppressed by rapacious landlords, who refuse to grant such leases as would encourage the husband-man to improve his farm, and make himself bet∣ter acquainted with the science of agriculture.
<PB N="7" REF="90"/>
This is perfectly well understood in the Lothians, where we see substantial inclosures, plantations, meadows for hay and pasture, wide extended fields of wheat, the fruits of skill and industry, and meet with farmers who rent lands to the amount of four or five hundred pounds a year. Of plants, this country produces an immense variety, grow∣ing wild in wood and vale, on rock and mountain, exclusive of those that are raised by the hands of the husbandman and gardener, for food, physic, ornament, and commerce. Their farm-grounds are well stocked with wheat, rye, barley, oats, hemp, and flax: their gardens produce great plenty of kitchen-roots, sallads, and greens, among which last, we reckon the colewort, known by the name of Scotch-kail: their orchards bear a variety of apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, strawberries, gooseberries, raspberries, and currants: here also apricots, nectarines, peaches, and sometimes grapes, are brought to maturity. In a word, there is no∣thing, whether shrub, fruit, or flower, that grows in any part of South-Britain, which may not, with a little pains, be brought to the same per∣fection in the middle of Scotland. Among the trees and shrubs which are the national growth of this country, we may reckon the oak, the fir, the birch, the poplar, the alder, willow, elder, hazle, mountain ash, crab-tree, and juniper, which last abounds to such a degree in some parts of the Highlands, that in the space of a few miles, many tons of the berries might be yearly gathered: be∣sides these, we find the hawthorn, the sloe, the dog∣rose, furze, broom, fern, and whole tracts of land and mountains covered with strong heath. This affords shelter for the myrtillis, the fruit of which, called bilberries, is here found in great abundance, as well as the brambleberry, cranberry, and wild strawberry. The ash, the elm; the sycamore,
<PB N="8" REF="100"/>
lime and walnut-tree, are chiefly planted about the houses of gentlemen; but even the inclosures of quickset appear naked for want of such hedge∣rows as adorn the country of England. Indeed, great part of this kingdom lies naked and exposed like a common; and other parts have no other enclosure than a paultry wall huddled up of loose stones, which yields a bleak and mean prospect, and serves no other purpose than that of keeping out the cattle. All the sea coast is covered with alga marina, dulse, and other marine plants, which we have mentioned in our description of the Western Isles.</P>
<P>There we have particularized, too, all the animals which are found on the continent or main land of Scotland. It may be necessary to observe, that the Highlands are well stocked with red deer, and the smaller species called the roe∣buck, as well as with hares, rabbits, foxes, wild cats, and badgers: that they abound with all sorts of game, and in particular with the growse and heathcock, which last is not so frequent in other parts of the country. The two most remarkable birds in the Highlands are the capperkaily, and the tarmacan: the first is nearly as large as a turkey, frequents the most high and remote hills, is seldom seen, and counted a great rarity for the table. The tarmacan is a kind of pheasant, about the size of the growse, which is here called moor-fowl, but of a lighter colour. It feeds upon the tender tops of the fir branches, from which the flesh contracts a kind of turpentine flavour, ex∣tremely agreeable both to the palate and stomach: this bird is very shy, and reckoned a great deli∣cacy. The black-cock, or heath-cock, in size and plumage resembles a pheasant, but his colour is black and shining: his mate, however, much more nearly resembles a hen pheasant, both in
<PB N="9" REF="110"/>
shape and hue. The rivers and lakes pour forth a profusion of salmon, trout, jack, and eels: the sea-coast swarms with all the productions of the ocean. The hills and mountains are covered with sheep and black cattle for exportation, as well as domestic use. These are of small size, as are also the horses bred in the Highlands; but the Low∣landers use the large breed, which came originally from England.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE, their CHARACTER and PECULIARITIES.</HEAD>
<P>What we have said of the genius and disposition of the islanders, may be applied to those who in∣habit the Highlands of Scotland. They are, in general, brave, passionate, and vindictive. The Lowlanders accuse them of insincerity, cruelty, and rapine: the English writers represent them as insufferably proud, ridiculously vain, and into∣lerably nasty. If the truth must be owned, clean∣liness is a virtue very rarely found in this part of the world. Persons of education, fortune, and sentiment, ought to be exempted from this na∣tional reproach. In the Low-country, the nobi∣lity and gentry are said to be infected with the pride and insolence of their Highland brethren: but, we apprehend, their character will be found nearly congenial with those of the same rank and fortune in England and other countries. Perhaps they may be particular in cherishing a family∣pride, inherited and soothed from generation to generation, through a long series of progenitors. This pride, however, seldom interferes with their avarice, when they are tempted with post or pen∣sion: these they are said to sollicit with unwearied importunity, and to hold on the most abject terms. The estates of the Scottish gentlemen being generally small and indivisible, the younger
<PB N="10" REF="120"/>
brothers commence adventurers, quit their own country, and push their fortunes in the English service, which, both by land and sea, abounds with Scotch officers: nay, they do not confine themselves to Great-Britain, but travel over the face of the earth in the different capacities of sol∣diers, sailors, merchants,, scholars, physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. They swarm in the East and West-Indies, as well as upon the coast of Guiney. There is hardly a town in Europe, or even in Asia, where we do not find some Scots∣man reputably settled. Hence arose the English proverb, that in every corner of the earth, one may find a Scot, a rat, and a Newcastle grind∣stone. All the Scots are tinctured with learning, which, however superficial it may be, will always shine in some places and in certain companies; and they know full well how to turn this commo∣dity to the best advantage. They are, for the most part, sober, industrious, circumspect, shrewd, and insinuating, well aware of their interest, which in foreign countries they prosecute with perseverance and success, even among people by whom they are envied and discountenanced. Their enemies impute their prosperity to their low cunning and servile adulation: but perhaps these reproaches flow from national prejudice, which knows not how to make proper distinctions. There is no creature upon earth less capable of flattery and dissimulation, or more fiery and precipitate, than a Scot who piques himself upon his family: he is jealous in point of honour, even to a degree of being often offensive; but a man of the lower class, who has been taught from his infancy to bridle his passions, to behave submissively to his superiors, and live within the bounds of the most rigid oeconomy, will, through the whole course of his life, retain the colour of his education.
<PB N="11" REF="130"/>
He will not swear, drink, and swagger-like the common people of England: he will not set his betters at defiance, nor commit any breach of law or decorum, which may in the sequel affect his person or his interest. On the contrary, he will save his money and his constitution: he will pay due deference to those whom fortune hath placed in a superior sphere: even when he thinks himself injured, he will rather devour his resent∣ment, than gratify it at the hazard of losing a friend or employer. Truth will own, that there are no better soldiers, seamen, traders, and trades∣men, than those whom Scotland has produced; and that with respect to learning and genius, this people is not behind any other nation in Europe. After all, we cannot deny that the presbyterian discipline which prevails among the people of Scotland, and is maintained even to a degree of oppression, under pretence of diffusing superior sanctity, may dispose them to hypocrisy, and of consequence to fraud. The commonalty of Scot∣land are mostly raw-boned, hard-featured, lean, lank, and muscular. In size they are rather smaller than their neighbours of South-Britain: they have generally long visages, with high-cheek bones, and hair of a sandy, red colour. They possess an aequanimity above most other nations, and enjoy good health, which is the immediate effect of a salubrious air and temperate diet. They are clothed after the English fashion, with this differ∣ence, that the peasants, instead of hats, wear flat blue caps, which they call bonnets; besides, their apparel is neither so good nor so clean as that worn by the people of the same rank on the south side of the Tweed. They dwell in wretched cot∣tages built of loose stones, without lime or mor∣tar, and thatched with straw: they feed on oat∣meal, milk, cheese, sowens, which is a kind of
<PB N="12" REF="140"/>
slummery made of oatmeal, and a sort of soup∣meagre composed of greens, roots, oatmeal, and butter. Some of them do not taste butcher's meat three times in the year: every family, how∣ever, in tolerable circumstances, kills a cow at Martinmass, and keeps the meat in pickle, to be used occasionally in barley-broth, or eaten boiled with greens. The Scots value themselves upon being as original in their cookery as in their mu∣sick: for their dishes are widely different from those of any other country. Of these, the prin∣cipal are the hoggice, the hodge-podge, the sheep's-head singed, the fish in sauce, the chicken broth, and minced collops. The hoggice is a hint taken from Apicius, a kind of hachis made of the lights, liver, and suet of a hog, seasoned, sauced, and boiled in the animal's stomach, so that when it appears upon the table, it looks like a bagpipe blown up with wind. The Scots have an aversion to hog-flesh, and therefore substitute the lights and liver of a sheep, though they still re∣tain the name of haggice: this, when well com∣pounded, is counted a savoury dish, but rather too strong for any ordinary digestion. Hodge∣podge is a succedaneum for the Spanish olla∣podrida, and may be termed a rich soup, com∣posed of beef, mutton, fowl, stewed with rice or barley, green pease, lettuce, turnips, carrots and onions. In such a pottage they very often boil a sheep's head and feet, with the skin singed smooth with a red-hot iron: this operation gives it a very high flavour, which, though it would turn the stomach of an Englishman, has been admired by some foreigners accustomed to the fumet. Fish in sauce, is a kind of soup made with haddocks, or other fish, the heads being stuffed with forced-meat. Chicken broth is a very simple preparation, en∣riched with eggs in such a manner, as to give it
<PB N="13" REF="150"/>
the air of a spoiled fricasee: notwithstanding this appearance, it is very delicate and nourishing. Minced collops are made of the rump of beef and suet, cut very small, seasoned with pepper, spice, and vinegar, par-boiled, and kept close in a jar, to be fried occasionally for the table. In fashion∣able houses, these dishes are now produced rather as curiosities than cates, the French cookery pre∣vailing universally among the great: but the peo∣ple of middle rank still retain their old dainties, though they are said to dress them in a very dirty, slovenly manner. The oatmeal, which the com∣mon people consume in bread, is ground in wa∣ter-mills, except in the Highlands, where these conveniencies are very scarce: there, as well as in the islands, the good women grind their corn in what they call a querne, consisting of two round smooth stones; one hollowed, and fixed for the reception of the other, which being turned round upon a wooden peg that stands up from the infe∣rior stone, and goes through a hole in the supe∣rior, brays the corn into a coarse powder: the meal being winnowed and sifted, is converted into dough, and formed into broad, thin, triangular cakes, which are first baked over the fire on a thin plate of cast iron, which the Scots term a girdle, and afterwards toasted, until they become crisp and fit for eating. This is the only bread used by the commonalty of Scotland, except in the principal towns, where they eat very good wheaten loaves. The Scotch mechanicks are counted neat workmen; and this country has pro∣duced many surprising instances of natural genius among the shepherds and peasantry. These peo∣ple are addicted to rhiming; and so fond of mu∣sick, that one can hardly meet with an individual who cannot play upon some instrument; but their voices are generally harsh or husky. They value
<PB N="14" REF="160"/>
themselves much on their tunes, which are cele∣brated all over Europe for their melody, simplicity, and tenderness. Other nations alledge, that they owe all those pieces to the famous David Riccio, who was murdered in the apartment of the unfor∣tunate queen Mary; but the antiquaries of Scot∣land undertake to prove, that their best tunes are of a much older standing: certain it is, they are wonderfully sweet, expressive, and affecting. The gentlemen of Scotland are stigmatized for hard drinkers; and the kingdom consumes annually a great quantity of French claret, which is sold at a very reasonable rate. The zealous patriots of the country have renounced this liquor; and, in order to encourage the British plantations, commit all their debauches with rum punch; a compo∣sition of water, lemon-juice, sugar, and the spirit called rum, distilled from the refuse of the sugar∣canes and molasses. The housekeepers and publi∣cans brew excellent beer and ale in many parts of Scotland: but the common people, who cannot afford such beverage, make merry on whisky and two-penny, which last is a sort of small ale sold for one penny the quart. Cheared by this liquor, and animated with a Scotch jigg from a fiddle or bagpipe, the country lads and lasses, assembling at a wedding, fair, or market, dance all day with great activity and glee, being to all appearance much more happy than those who contemplate their poverty with contempt. The better sort of people are extremely fond of country-dances, which they perform with uncommon vivacity. The other diversions prevalent in the Lowlands are tennis, fives, goff <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goff is a game at ball, played on an open common, like cricket; but the ball is much harder, and instead of bats, they use clubs faced with horn. A ball struck with one of these, by an expert player, will fly to an incre∣dible distance.</NOTE>, archery, foot-ball, nine∣pins,
<PB N="15" REF="170"/>
long-bullets <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These are iron bullets of such a weight, trolled up∣on the highway for the length of several miles; and he wins the game, who, with the few∣est throws, first reaches the goal.</NOTE>, cudgel-playing, fencing, shooting, vaulting, wrestling, swimming, angling, and skaiting on the ice in winter. The weddings of the common people in Scotland are celebrated with the firing of guns and pistols, while the new∣married couple return from church: then they feast at dinner with the guests. All the company rise up to dance in separate bands, to the sound of fiddles and bagpipes, in houses, barns, and even on the grass, to the number of some hun∣dreds. The evening is generally concluded with drinking and debauchery. The practice is not much different at funerals: the corpse is carried on a bier, by the nearest relations, to the grave, where it is deposited, without any other ceremony than that of hat-lifting, when dust is committed to dust: the company return to the house of the defunct, and drown their sorrow in a deluge of drinking. Among people of fashion, before the corpse is taken up, the company are served round with a glass of wine, sweet cakes, and with almonds and raisins, with which every guest generally fills his pocket. To accompany the funerals of poor persons, their neighbours are summoned by a dis∣mal passing bell, rung by the beadle, who halts in certain places of the street, and in solemn phrase and melancholy tone, announces the name and profession of the defunct, with the time fixed for his burial. Those of a higher rank are in∣vited by printed letters, signed by the next of kin to the deceased. At Highland funerals, the company, both before and after the interment, are cheared with the musick of the bagpipe, which is garnished with long stripes of black crape, and
<PB N="16" REF="180"/>
the corpse is attended by professed mourners, who perform the <HI>Coronach,</HI> consisting of the most hi∣deous yells of lamentation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION. LAWS. GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The prevailing religion in Scotland is Calvinism, or that of the Kirk, imported thither by the re∣former, John Knox, from Geneva. This dis∣cipline, after a long struggle with episcopacy, was at length settled as the national church; though there is still a great number of all ranks who adhere to the religion of England, and a few still retain the Roman catholic faith. The kirk is governed by the general assembly, consisting of the dergy, intermingled with a certain number of laymen, called ruling elders, deputed from each presbytery: these are annually convened at Edin∣burgh by the King's commission, vested in some Scottish nobleman, who presides in the assembly, and appears with great splendour, as the repre∣sentative of his sovereign, being supplied by the crown with a gratuity, which very well enables him to maintain this magnificence. The assembly establishes regulations in the church, and reforms abuses, deposing those ecclesiastics who have dis∣graced the priesthood by their loose morals and irregularities, and affirming or reversing the sen∣tences passed in the synods and presbyteries, which are subordinate courts of church judicature. It must be observed, however, that these judicatories have no power over the laity, as they have in other countries: all the authority they can exert, is to publish the sentence of excommunication against fornicators or adulterers, provided they refuse to do public penance: <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">A convicted fornicator is required to stand upon the black stool of repentance, three successive Sundays, and be solemnly rebuked by the minister in the face of the congregation. Adulterers are obliged to stand in a white sheet, or sack-cloth, at the church door: but in the great towns, this penance is com∣muted for a sum of money payed to the Kirk-treasurer. The disgrace of doing public penance is so dreaded by the common people, that in order to avoid the black-stool, the fruit of an illicit amour is not unfrequently murdered in the birth by the desperate mother, and she afterwards ends her life with infamy upon the gallows.</NOTE> but this sentence
<PB N="17" REF="190"/>
is not attended with outlawry, or any other con∣sequence than the disgrace which it must necessa∣rily leave on the character of the person so cen∣sured. Though there is no benefice in Scotland that exceeds one hundred and fifty pounds a year, the smallest is sufficient to maintain the incumbent in a decent manner; and there is a provision made by law for the widows of poor clergymen. The clergy of Scotland, in order to preserve their in∣fluence among the people, have affected an un∣common austerity in their manners and way of living, and even imposed it, in a great measure, upon the laity of their communion, who may be easily distinguished by their mortified looks, their canting conversation, and their professed aversion to the amusements and vanities of life: we speak of those who are really religionists. This univer∣sal affectation of sanctity, is attended with some good consequences to society. It restrains the passions within the limits of decorum, and pre∣vents those riots, indecencies, and avowed con∣tempt of religion, which prevail so openly in England, to the disgrace of all order and police. There are no people under the sun more decent and orderly than the Scots in their own country. At the Revolution, a great number of ignorant fanatics were admitted to ordination in the church of Scotland; and these acquired wonderful influ∣ence with the vulgar, by long prayers and extem∣pore sermons, delivered through the nose with the sanctified twang, which had an air of inspiration.
<PB N="18" REF="200"/>
Nothing could be more impertinent, tiresome, and absurd than those effusions, which, among persons of sense and education, soon brought the priesthood into ridicule and contempt. This old remnant of fanatics is now almost worn out, and generally succeeded by a set of ministers, who, by their learning, taste, and liberal sentiments, would do honour to any religion: nevertheless, there is a sort of schism in the kirk, occasioned by some of the old leaven of fanaticism. Divers pastors have revolted against temporal supremacy and lay-patronage: they have set up a new light, in opposition to the light of reason, and faith against good works, which they treat as an abo∣mination. In a word, they have plunged head∣long into all the extravagancies of puritanical en∣thusiasm; and though removed from their livings, as schismatics, by the power of the general assem∣bly, they have been followed by the greater part of their flocks, who obey them implicitly, pro∣vide amply for their subsistence, and build meet∣ing-houses for the celebration of their worship. At present there are in Scotland thirteen provin∣cial synods, that meet twice a year, and about sixty-eight presbyteries, consisting each of a num∣ber of ministers, from twelve to twenty: the lowest church judicature is the kirk session of every parish, composed of the minister and cer∣tain elders, chosen from the most reputable of his parishioners. A society was incorporated by pa∣tent, in the reign of queen Anne, for erecting schools in North-Britain and the Western Isles. This was afterwards established by act of parlia∣ment, and a fund appropriated for carrying the design into execution: to this fund his present majesty adds a thousand pounds per annum.</P>

throughout every part of the country, in which children are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and even the classics, at a very small expence. The Scots in general are superstitious: they trust in charms and incantations: they believe every old house is haunted by ghosts and spirits: they imagine they see apparitions, and hear supernatural sounds; and universally adopt the notion of witch∣craft: a poor, old, lone woman, who lives in a solitary hut, and appears with wrinkled face, hol∣low eyes, and a red petticoat, ever incurs the su∣spicion of sorcery; and even in our own times, several miserable wretches have been legally con∣demned, and suffered death for witchcraft, who had no other guilt than poverty and despair. These cruel and absurd laws, however, have been happily repealed by the British legislature. The education of those designed for the learned pro∣fessions, is perfected at the four universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and St. Andrews, which are seminaries tolerably endowed, and well supplied with excellent professors. Justice is like∣wise administered in towns, according to the mu∣nicipal laws, by the magistrates of the corpora∣tion. Every royal borough consists of a provost or mayor, two bailiffs, a treasurer, and dean of guild, which last regulates all affairs of commerce. The magistrates are chosen annually by the town, or common-council; and every company, at the same time, chuses a deacon to decide petty dis∣putes that may happen among themselves. Capi∣tal crimes in Scotland are punished by hanging, except high-treason in noblemen, who are gene∣rally indulged with decapitation. For this pur∣pose, the Scots have contrived a machine, called the Maiden, which is a sharp plate of iron, that descends through a groove in a frame upon the neck of the malefactor, with such force and velo∣city,
<PB N="20" REF="220"/>
that the head is instantaneously severed from the body. A criminal condemned to be hanged walks in his shroud, with a halter about his neck, accompanied by two ministers, the town magi∣strates, and a vast crowd, to the gallows, which he and the executioner ascend by a double ladder. There they stand, until the service of psalm∣singing and praying is performed by the ministers on a scaffold below: then the malefactor addresses himself in a speech to the spectators; the execu∣tioner adjusts the halter to the end of the gibbet, ties a handkerchief about the victim's face, and pushing him off the ladder, he is immediately strangled by the weight of his own body.</P>
<P>The Scots are governed by their own laws, de∣duced partly from the feudal system of govern∣ment, and partly built on the civil law, and the law of nature and nations. The courts of judi∣cature are these: the college of justice, consisting of fifteen judges, called lords of session, who sit twice a year to administer justice according to equity, and determine causes appealed to them from inferior tribunals; yet even from this, there lies an appeal to the British parliament. The justice court for causes, criminal and civil, con∣sists of a justice-general, justice-clerk, and five other judges, who are lords of session. These, assisted with a jury or pannel of fifteen, try and decide all causes by a majority of the pannel, and hold assizes yearly in all parts of the kingdom. The court of exchequer, regulated by act of par∣liament, after the model of that in England. The sheriff's county-court, in which he or his deputy presides, and administers justice in all cases, civil and criminal. These sheriffs were formerly here∣ditary; but the British parliament, having com∣pounded with them for sums of money, lately abolished those jurisdictions, which were produc∣tive
<PB N="21" REF="230"/>
of much oppression and undue influence; and now the sheriffs are appointed by the crown. The commissary-court, composed of four judges, who sit at Edinburgh, and determine all disputes about marriages, wills, and tythes, and all cases of scan∣dal. Besides these tribunals, Scotland is provided with justices of the peace, who possess the same power which is vested in those of England. There is likewise a court of admiralty, which not only takes cognizance of wrecks, and all matters re∣lating to the sea; but likewise grants writs of ar∣rest, called <HI>intentione fugae,</HI> against such debtors or delinquents as are suspected of a design to leave the kingdom. There are three sorts of burghs or burroughs, namely, burghs royal, burghs of re∣gality, and burghs of barony. The royal bur∣roughs form one body and general court, called, the convention of burroughs, held annually at Edinburgh, to make regulations, and take cogni∣zance of all matters relating to the trade and inte∣rest of the community. Regalities are feus granted by the king to particular subjects or corporations, with very extensive authority and jurisdiction in cases criminal, as well as civil. Burghs of barony, holding of the crown, enjoy a court of jurisdic∣tion, wherein small causes are tried; but the royal burroughs only have the privilege of send∣ing members to parliament. The constitution of Scotland has varied, at different times, according as the power of the king, the nobles, or the com∣mons happened to prevail; at last, however, it settled in a limited monarchy. The Scots enjoyed their own parliament, consisting of king, lords, and commons, though differently modelled from that of England; but the two nations being incor∣porated by the act of union, the Scottish parlia∣ment ceased of course, and the kingdom is now represented by sixteen peers, and forty-five com∣moners,
<PB N="22" REF="240"/>
who sit and vote in the British parliament. These peers are elected every parliament from the whole body of the Scotch nobility; and the com∣mons are chosen by the shires and certain burroughs classed for that purpose. The land-tax of Scot∣land is settled at a certain sum, by an article of the treaty of union; but the customs, and other branches of the revenue, are on the same footing here as in England. The great offices of the crown are still maintained and bestowed upon the noblemen of North-Britain The order of knighthood peculiar to Scotland is called that of the Thistle, consisting of the sovereign and twelve knights. They wear a green ribbon over their shoulder, and on their breast an embroidered star, representing St. Andrew irradiated, with the in∣scription, <HI>nemo me impune lacessit.</HI> This order is said to have been originally instituted by king Achaius in the eighth century. It was revived by James V. a prince of great taste and magnificence, but dropped about the time of the Reformation, and was again restored to its former lustre by queen Anne. The armorial bearing of Scotland is sol, a lion rampant gules, within a double tressure flowered and counterflowered; the crest, a lion crowned imperial.</P>

<HEAD>STRENGTH, MANUFACTURE, and COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The security of Scotland, as well as of the whole island, depends chiefly on the naval power and standing army of Great-Britain. In order to preserve the tranquillity of North-Britain, which has been very much subject to commotions within, and invasions from without, there is always a con∣siderable body of troops quartered in this country: here are several old castles garrisoned with invalids; and some modern fortifications in the Highlands,
<PB N="23" REF="250"/>
which are always kept in repair, and well guarded both with men and artillery. The remarkable edi∣fices and monuments of antiquity belonging to this kingdom, shall be specified in our accounts of particular places.</P>
<P>A remarkable spirit of industry has of late years appeared very visibly in many parts of Scot∣land. We have already observed how much agri∣culture hath been improved in the Lothians, and on all the eastern coast: nor have the Scots been more remiss in the article of manufacture. That of their linen, which the government encourages with a bounty and premiums, hath encreased to such a degree, that, exclusive of home consump∣tion, they export to England and the British plan∣tations, in linens, cambricks, checks, Osnabrugs, inkle, and other articles of the same branch, to the amount of four hundred thousand pounds sterling yearly. Though their wool be generally coarse, yet it serves very well for cloathing to the common people; and when mixed with a propor∣tion of English wool, or that produced by sheep of the English breed, may be spun, woven, and dressed into excellent broad-cloth, of which there are some considerable manufactories in different parts of Scotland. Of their wool, they likewise make caps, stockings, and mittins for exportation. The mountains of Scotland produce a great quantity of lead and silver, by which the community is en∣riched, and a vast number of hands employed; but the fishery may be said to be the inexhaustible treasure of this country. We have already en∣larged upon this subject, in our description of the isles, though it cannot be too much recommended to the attention of these people: we shall only ob∣serve at present, that the improvement of the fishery is the more practicable, as plenty of salt may be had for curing them on every part of the
<PB N="24" REF="260"/>
coast. Salt-pans are already erected in many dif∣ferent places, and the sea-water is boiled with all the success that could be expected; nor would it be difficult, we apprehend, to make bay-salt, by overflowing low grounds on the sea-side. The cod, ling, and herring-fishery is already carried on to a considerable extent; and the cured fish ex∣ported to Spain, Portugal, and the plantations, where they are preferred to the produce of New∣foundland. They moreover equip an annual fleet of ships for the whale-fishery, on the coast of Spitzbergen; and have, on the whole, made pros∣perous voyages: indeed, they could hardly prove otherwise, as the government allows a bounty of forty shillings for every ton of shipping thus em∣ployed. Another considerable branch of traffic is the sale of black cattle, which the Scots drive up annually to England, in thousands. These, be∣ing fattened in the rich pastures of South-Britain, are slaughtered for the market, and the beef is counted delicious. The Scots carry on a profitable foreign trade to the British plantations, where they exchange their own manufactures for sugar, rum, and tobacco, as well as to other countries on the continent, where they dispose of their fish, tallow, hides, and woollen manufacture. In a word, this kingdom, though branded with the reproach of poverty and barrenness, might prove an inex∣haustible source of wealth to the natives. It is almost surrounded with an open ocean, provided with a great number of excellent harbours, occu∣pied by a race of hardy people, rich in many na∣tural advantages, and every way adapted for com∣merce. The inhabitants seem at length acquainted with their own interest: they understand the na∣ture of commerce: they see the happy effects of industry: they take example by their southern neighbours and fellow subjects, and pursue their
<PB N="25" REF="270"/>
steps with such emulation, as hath already opened a fair prospect of opulence and importance.</P>
<P>Scotland is divided into thirty-three shires, namely, Edinburgh, Haddington, Berwick, Rox∣borough, Selkirk, Peebles, Lanerk, Dumfries, Wigtown, Aire, Dumbarton, Bute, Caithness, Renfrew, Stirling, Linlithgow, Perth, Kincardin, Aberdeen, Inverness, Nairn, Cromartie, Argyle, Fife, Forfar, Bamff, Kircudbright, Sutherland, Clackmanan, Kinross, Ross, Elgin, Orkney. These we shall separately describe, proceeding in our usual course, from the north to the southward of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Caithness, otherwise called the shire of Weick, is the most northern county of all Scotland; bounded on the east by the ocean, by Strathnaver and Sutherland on the south and south-west: from these it is divided by the mountain Orde, and a continued ridge of hills as far as Knockfin, then by the whole course of the river Hallowdale. On the north it is washed by the Pentland, or Put∣land Firth, which flows between this county and the Orkneys. It extends five and thirty miles from north to south, and about twenty from east to west. The coast is rocky, and remarkable for a number of bays and promontories. Of these, the principal are Sand-side-Head to the west, pointing to the opening of Pentland Frith; Orcas, now Holborn-Head, and Dunnot-Head, both fronting northward to the Frith. Dunnot-Head is a peninsula about a mile broad, and seven in compass; affording several lakes, good pasture, excellent mill-stones, and a lead-mine. Scribister∣bay, on the north-west, is a good harbour, where ships may ride securely. Rice bay, on the east side, extends three miles in breadth, but is of dangerous access, on account of some sunk rocks at the entrance. At the bottom of this bay ap∣pear
<PB N="26" REF="280"/>
the ruins of two strong castles, the seat of the earl of Caithness, called Castle Sinclair, and Gernego, joined to each other by a draw-bridge. Duncan's bay, otherwise called Dunsby head, the north-east point of Caithness, and the extremest promontory in Britain. At this place, the breadth of the Frith does not exceed twelve miles, and in the neighbourhood is the ordinary ferry to the Ork∣neys. Here is likewise Clytheness pointing east, and Noshead pointing north-east. The sea in this place is very impetuous, being in continual agita∣tion from violent counter-tides, currents, and vor∣tices. The only island belonging to this county is that of Stroma, in the Pentland Frith, at the distance of two miles from the main land, extend∣ing about a mile in length, and producing good corn. The navigation is here rendered very diffi∣cult by conflicting tides and currents, which at both ends of the island produce a great agitation in the sea. At the south end, the waves dance so impetuously, that the sailors term them the <HI>merry men of May,</HI> alluding to the house of one Mr. May, on the opposite shore of Caithness, which served them as a land-mark, in the dangerous passage between the island and the continent. The property of this island was once disputed between the earls of Orkney and Caithness; but adjudged to the latter, in consequence of an experiment, by which it appeared, that venomous creatures will live in Stroma, whereas they die immediately if transported to the Orkneys. The country of Caithness, though chiefly mountainous, flattens towards the sea coast, where the ground is arable, and produces good harvests of oats and barley, sufficient for the natives, and yielding a super∣plus for exportation; but the soil being generally a moist clay, and the climate cold, the harvest is late, and the corn counted inferior in quality to
<PB N="27" REF="290"/>
that which is raised in the neighbouring counties. Indeed, the country is better adapted for pasture, and as such, is turned to the best advantage. Caithness is well watered with small rivers, brooks, lakes, and fountains, and affords a few woods of birch, but is in general bare of trees; and even those the inhabitants plant, are stunted in their growth. Lead is found at Dennet, copper at Old-Urk, and iron ore at several places; but these ad∣vantages are not improved. The air of Caithness is temperate, though in the latitude of fifty-eight, where the longest day in summer is computed at eighteen hours; and when the sun sets, he makes so small an arch of a circle below the horizon, that the people enjoy a twilight until he rises again. The fuel used by the inhabitants of Caith∣ness consists of peat and turf, which the ground yields in great plenty. The forest of Moravins and Berridale afford abundance of red deer and roe-bucks: the country is well stored with hares, rabbits, growse, heathcocks, plover, and all sorts of game, comprehending a bird called snowfleet, about the size of a sparrow, exceedingly fat and delicious, that comes hither in large flights about the middle of February, and takes its departure in April. The hills are covered with sheep and black cattle; so numerous, that a fat cow has been sold at market for four shillings sterling. The rocks along the coast are frequented by ea∣gles, hawks, and all manner of sea-fowl, whose eggs and young are taken in vast quantities by the natives. The rivers and lakes abound with trout, salmon, and eels; and the sea affords a very ad∣vantageous fishery. Divers obelisks and antient monuments appear in this district, and several Romish chapels are still standing. Caithness is well peopled with a race of hardy inhabitants, who employ themselves chiefly in fishing, and
<PB N="28" REF="300"/>
breeding sheep and black cattle: they are even remarkably industrious; for between Weick and Dumbith, one continued tract of rugged rocks, extending twelve miles, they have forced several little harbours for their fishing boats, and cut ar∣tificial steps from the beach to the top of the rocks, where they have erected houses, in which they cure and dry the fish for market. The shire of Caithness gives the title of an earl to a branch of the family of Sinclair. It contains a presbytery of twelve parishes, a variety of little towns and villages, and a considerable number of seats be∣longing to gentlemen, though these are far from being elegant or commodious. The two principal towns are Weick, or Weich, and Thurso: Weick is a royal burrough and market town, in which the head courts are kept: it stands on the east side of the shire, at the mouth of Murray Frith, and has a tide-harbour for small vessels; but this is little frequented. Thurso, on the opposite side of the shire, though but a barony burrough, is more populous, and better built, than Weich, and boasts of the best church in the country. The neighbourhood of Holburn-head forms a good and safe harbour for shipping. On the east side of the town, runs the water of Thurso, a small river, so incredibly stocked with salmon, which live there all the year, that several horse∣loads are taken at a time, either by nets or baskets, which the natives call creels, so contrived with barred doors, as to admit the fish, and then con∣fine them: above three hundred good salmons have been taken at one draught of the net, by the fishermen of Thurso.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUTHERLAND.</HEAD>
<P>Sutherland, including Strathnavern, borders on Caithness to the east and north-east, is bounded
<PB N="29" REF="310"/>
by the ocean on the north, the country of Assynt on the west, Rosse on the south, and by the Ger∣man sea on the east and south-east. It stretches about fourscore miles in length, and forty in breadth; is generally hilly, though in many parts arable; well watered with small rivers and streams replete with fish, and exhibiting about sixty lakes, the habitation of various fish, swans, ducks, geese, and other wild-fowl. The largest of these is Lochsyn, extending fourteen miles in length: some of them are interspersed with small verdant islands, which in summer yield a very agreeable prospect. On the coast are many com∣modious harbours, and all the bays swarm with fish; nay, the sea in this place produces some va∣luable pearls. Sutherland affords iron, stone, free-stone, lime-stone, and slate, in abundance. Here are also quarries of marble, and mines of coal, though the people use turf and peat for fuel. Lead-ore, impregnated with silver, and even some gold, hath been found in this province, together with chrystals and pebbles.</P>
<P>The air is so temperate, and the soil so good, that saffron has here been brought to perfection. Many parts of the country are remarkably fruit∣ful in corn, and the pasturage is excellent every where. Besides three great forests, there are many smaller woods in Sutherland, abounding with deer, and other game. On the hills are fed numerous flocks of sheep and black cattle; small, yet sweet and juicy. There is one bird peculiar to this shire, called knag, which resembles a parrot, and digs its nest with its beak, in the trunks of oaks. The northern part, called Strathnaver, and sepa∣rated from the rest by a ridge of mountains, is bounded on the north and west by the Deucalido∣nian and Vergivian oceans, on the east by Caith∣ness, and on the south by Assynt. The length of
<PB N="30" REF="320"/>
it, from east to west, amounts to four and thirty miles; but the breadth from north to south, does not exceed twelve in some places. It is very hilly; and the mountains are so high, that the snow re∣mains on the tops of them till Midsummer. It is watered by the river Navern, from whence it de∣rives its name: as this district gives a title to the eldest son of the earl of Sutherland. Here are several woods, frequented by deer, and other game, which the people take great delight in hunting. Iron-mines have been worked in some places, but to no great advantage. Strathnavern has many fresh-water lakes or lochs; the chief of which are Loch Navern, and Loch Lyel: there are several islands on the northern coast; and in various parts of the country we see monuments of victories obtained over the Danes, or other foreign invaders. Sutherland boasts of some towns, and a great many villages. The people are numerous, hardy, bold, and enterprizing; courteous to strangers; chearful, open, frugal, and industrious. They, as well as their neighbours of Caithness, speak the language, and wear the garb, used in the Lowlands of Scotland. They carry on a con∣siderable salmon fishery. They drive a traffick with their black cattle, sheep, and horses, at the neighbouring fairs; but export their corn, barley, salt, coal, salmon, salted beef, butter, cheese, wool-skins, hides, and tallow. Here are provi∣sions of all sorts in plenty; and so cheap through all this country, that a gentleman may keep house, and live much more sumptuously, for two hundred pounds a year in the North of Scotland, than he can live for three times the money in the South of England.</P>
<P>The chief town of Sutherland is the royal burrough of Dornoch, formerly the see of a bi∣shop, and now the seat of a presbytery, consisting
<PB N="31" REF="330"/>
of nine parishes. In the cathedral, or great church, we see the burying-place of the earls of Sutherland. On the east side of the town ap∣pears a monument, called Thane's-cross: there is likewise in the neighbourhood of Eubo, a stone cross, antiently erected over the body of a Danish king, who was here defeated, slain, and interred. Dornoch has four fairs in the year, well frequented by trading people. There are other towns of in∣ferior order, such as Godspey and Brora; the last situated at the mouth of a river of the same name, which is likewise bestowed upon a small adjacent island, in which the earl of Sutherland has a hunt∣ing-seat, where he sometimes resides for the diver∣sion of deer-hunting. In this neighbourhood are coal-pits, and salt-pans, which afford plenty of these two commodities for exportation. But the earl's principal seat is Dunrobin, about six miles from Dornoch, a noble castle, said to be built in the twelfth century, by Robert, Earl of Suther∣land: it stands by the sea-side, commanding an extensive prospect, and is beautified with parks, plantations, and elegant gardens.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ROSS.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Ross (including Tayne and Cro∣martie) stretches fourscore miles in length, and seventy-eight in breadth: is bounded on the west by the western sea, and part of the isle of Skie; by Inverness on the south; Strathnavern and Su∣therland on the north and north-east; and by Cromartie and Murray-Frith on the east. Tayne includes the greater part of Ross, with the isles of Skie, Lewis, and Harries. Cromartie lies on the other side of Murray-Frith, to the northward of Inverness, extending but twelve miles in length; bounded on the south and east by part of Ross,
<PB N="32" REF="340"/>
and the Frith of Murray, and by the Frith of Cromartie on the north. The shire of Ross takes up the whole breadth of the island; and being much indented with bays and inlets from both seas, appears of a very irregular form. These bays afford safe harbour for shipping, especially that of Cromartie, which is capacious enough to contain all the fleets of Europe, being land-locked on every side, and in all respects one of the best harbours in the known world. The Frith of Tayne, on the east side of the shire, runs up five∣and-twenty miles from the sea, as far as the Cape Tarbat, dividing Ross from Sutherland, being about seven miles broad at the mouth; but, on account of quick-sands, unsafe for navigation. The country of Ross is incumbered with huge mountains, on which the snow lies for the greatest part of the year; these, however, yield good pasture: but, on the eastern side, next the German ocean, the country admits of agriculture, and produces good crops of corn. The vallies are fertilized by several rivers, among which we reckon the Okel, the Charron, and the Braan, besides a good number of fresh-water lakes, which indeed are found in every part of this country. The vallies, or straths, are generally covered with wood; and near Alfarag, there are forests of fir, fifteen or twenty miles in length, well stocked with deer, and game of all sorts. Great numbers of black cattle, horses, sheep, and goats, are fed upon the mountains: the sea, rivers, and lakes, teem with fish and fowl. The lochs on the west∣ern coast abound with herrings in the season, particularly Loch Eu, about nine miles long, and three in breadth: one part of this is formed by a bay, or inlet of the sea; and the other is a lake of fresh water. The sides of it are covered with wood, where formerly abundance of iron was
<PB N="33" REF="350"/>
smelted. Though the middle part of Ross, called Ardross, is mountainous, and scarce inhabited, the north-east parts on the rivers Okel, Charron, and Frith of Tayne, are fruitful, and abound with villages. Coygach and Assgut, two northerly districts, are bare and hilly; yet they abound with deer and black cattle; and we see several good houses towards the coast, where there are also pro∣montories, and huge rocks of marble. Ardmea∣nach, part of the peninsula betwixt the bays of Cromartie and Murray, is a barony, which of old bestowed a title on the king of Scotland's second son. The district of Glen-elchig, on the south-west, was the paternal estate of the earl of Seaforth, chief of the clan Mackenzie: but the last earl of that name, having risen in rebellion, was in the year 1719 defeated at Glenshiel, in this very quar∣ter, together with a small body of Spaniards, by whom he had been joined. His auxiliaries were taken; and though he himself, with some of his friends, escaped to the continent, his estate and honours were forfeited. At the same time, the king's troops, who obtained this victory, dismantled the castle of Ylen-donnen, situated on an island, in a bay that fronts the isle of Skie: it belonged to the crown; but the office of hereditary gover∣nor was vested in the earl of Seaforth, and here he had erected his magazine. Ross is chiefly peo∣pled by the Mackenzies and Frasers, two warlike clans, who speak Erse, and live in the Highland fashion. There are fisheries carried on along the coast; but their chief traffick is with sheep, and black cattle.</P>
<P>The chief towns of Ross, are Channerie, Ding∣well, Tayne, and Fortrose. Channerie, or Cha∣nonrie, so denominated from a college of canons regular settled formerly in this place, was a bishop's see, part of the cathedral and the episcopal palace
<PB N="34" REF="360"/>
still remaining; at present, it is an inconsiderable market town, situated on the peninsula between the bays of Cromartie and Murray, with a ferry over the last of these friths. It is the seat of a presbytery, composed of seven parishes; and is re∣markable for nothing but a stately house belong∣ing to the late earl of Seaforth Dingwell, built at the bottom of Cromartie Frith, is a market-town, and a royal burrough, and the seat of a presbytery, including thirteen parishes. Tayne is also a royal burrough, a market-town, and seat of a presbytery, situated in a pleasant and fruitful coun∣try, tolerably well inhabited, and enjoying a con∣siderable trade, by communication with the Western islands, and the herring-fishery. Before the Re∣formation, here was a church dedicated to St. Do∣this, to which the people went in pilgrimage. Fortrose is another royal burrough, with a castle belonging to the late earl of Seaforth; and now possessed, together with the greatest part of his fortune, by his son, the lord Fortrose.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>INVERNESS-SHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Inverness, including part of Mur∣ray land, together with the countries of Badenoch and Lochaber, adjoins to Ross and Cromartie on the north; to Murray land on the east; to Lorn, Braidalbin, and Athol, on the south; and on the west, is washed by the Western ocean. It extends threescore miles in length from east to west, and five-and-fifty, where broadest, from north to south. It is, on the whole, a barren country, though it yields plenty of iron ore, produces large woods of fir and oak, plenty of pasturage, and some corn. Here is plenty of deer, hares, partridges, growse, and all sorts of game, whether fowls or quadru∣peds. The hills and mountains produce great
<PB N="35" REF="370"/>
flocks of black cattle: the rivers and lakes, of which there is a great number in this country, af∣ford abundance of salmon, eels, and trout; and for sea-fish, there is hardly a district in Scotland so well provided as Invernessshire.</P>
<P>Badenoch, Lochaber, and Mar, include the whole breadth of Scotland from sea to sea. Bade∣noch, or the most northerly part, extends about thirty-three miles in length from east to west, and seven-and-twenty from north-west to south-east, where broadest. This district is barren, hilly, but abounding with deer, and diversion for the sports∣man. Lochaber is bounded on the north by Ba∣denoch; by Athol on the east; by Lorn and Braid∣albin on the south, and by a mountainous ridge on the west, towards the sea-shore. It derives its name from the Lake, or Loch-Aber; extends about twenty miles from east to west, and thirty from north to south. The country is barren, bleak, mountainous, and rugged. In one of the most barren parts of this country, near the mouth of the river Aber, in the center between the West and North Highlands, stands Fort-William, with the town of Maryburgh, built upon a navigable arm of the sea, not far from the foot of a very high mountain, called Benevis. The town, designed as a sutlery for the garrison, was erected into a bur∣rough; and the fort itself was designed as a check upon the clan Cameron, who had been guilty of depredations, and other irregularities. It is inha∣bited mostly by the Macdonalds, Camerons, and Mackintoshes, who are not the most civilized peo∣ple in Scotland, though their chiefs are generally persons of education, honour, and hospitality. Macdonald of Glengary, descended in a straight line from Donald of the Isles, possessed a seat or castle in this district, which was burned to the ground, and destroyed in the year 1715, in conse∣quence
<PB N="36" REF="380"/>
of his declaring for the pretender. The elegant house and gardens belonging to Cameron of Lochiel underwent the same fate, for the same reason, after the extinction of the rebellion in the year 1746. The cadets of these families, which have formed a kind of inferior gentry, are lazy, indigent, and uncleanly; proud, ferocious, and vindictive. The common people, though cele∣brated for their bravery, fidelity, and attachment to their chiefs, are counted very savage, and much addicted to rapine. They speak the Erse language, and conform to the customs we have described as peculiar to the Highlanders. They pay very little attention to any sort of commerce, but that which consists in the sale of their black cattle, and lead a sort of vagrant life among the hills; hunting, fowling, and fishing, as the seasons permit, and as their occasions require. They delight in arms, which they learn to handle from their infancy, submit patiently to discipline in the character of soldiers, and never fail to signalize themselves in the field by their sobriety, as well as their valour. While they remain in their own country, nothing can be more penurious, mean, fordid, and uncom∣fortable, than the way of life to which these poor people are inured, whether we consider their dress, diet, or lodging. In point of provision, they are so improvident, or ill supplied, that, before the winter is over, whole families are in danger of starving. In this emergency, they bleed their mi∣serable cattle, already reduced to skin and bone, and eat the blood boiled with oatmeal. This eva∣cuation, added to their former weakness, enfeebles the cows to such a degree, that when they lie down, they cannot rise again without assistance. The chief town from which the shire derives its name is Inverness, a royal burrough, situated at the bot∣tom of the Frith of Murray, by the mouth of the
<PB N="37" REF="390"/>
river Ness, which, flowing from Lochness, here disembogues itself into the sea. The town stands on the south-side of this river, over which the na∣tives have thrown a bridge of seven arches. Inver∣ness is the seat of a sheriff's judicature, as well as of a presbytery, containing thirteen parishes; and may be justly denominated the key to the North Highlands. Here is a commodious harbour for small ships open to the Frith; in consequence of which, the place enjoys some share of commerce, though not very considerable. The town, which is considered as the capital of the Highlands, con∣sists of four streets, three of these center at the cross, which is a stone pillar erected on a pedestal, with circular steps. Here the people meet at fair and market, to transact business. The houses are built of rough, irregular stones, the interstices be∣ing filled with rubble, and the walls afterwards harled or plaistered with mortar. The ground∣floor is generally destined for a shop, or warehouse; and the possessor ascends to the upper story, either by a stone stair built from the street; or, if the house be more than one story high, by a round winding stair-case within the walls, which the Scots call a turnpike. This strange way of building ob∣tains in all the towns of North-Britain. Inverness is pretty large and regular, provided with two churches; in one of which, divine service is per∣formed in the Highland tongue, for the benefit of those who do not understand English. On a rising ground, adjoining to the south-side of the town, is an old castle, of which the duke of Gordon was hereditary keeper. It was formerly a royal palace, though very small and inconvenient; but is now converted into part of Fort George, a citadel built in the year 1726, to serve as barracks for six com∣panies of soldiers. The people of Inverness are said to have learned English from the garrisons,
<PB N="38" REF="400"/>
which have been here quartered successively since the time of Oliver Cromwell, to the present reign. They likewise pique themselves on their politeness, and look upon their town as a model for neatness and conveniency. Certain it is, some of Crom∣well's soldiers settled in this country, and improved some parts of its neighbourhood, by their industry and skill in agriculture: nor can it be denied, that the present inhabitants of Inverness speak the Eng∣lish language with more propriety than is observed in any other part of North-Britain: but the Erse being vernacular to them, it is not in their power to lay aside their original accent; and they pro∣nounce their words with such a Highland cadence, or tone, as is even more disagreeable to an English ear than the Low-country dialect. If we may be∣lieve travellers, they have still less reason to boast of the neatness of their town, and the convenience of their houses. The streets are always covered with dirt; the houses are ill-contrived, cold, and half finished; their furniture is mean, and their habita∣tions are intolerably nasty. Doubtless, there are some exceptions; but such is the general character of the people. The attire of the common people is wretched, and some of their customs ridiculously absurd. There is nothing more common than to see a tall, raw-boned fisherman, in the sea, mounted on the back of a female, who carries him to and from his boat, with her petticoats tucked up to a very indecent height. This spectacle is not more surprizing to a stranger, than that of half a dozen wenches, standing in as many tubs, and trampling linnen, with their legs and thighs entirely bare. Such is their manner of washing linnen; and the maid-servants here, as in all other parts of Scot∣land, frequently stipulate upon their being hired, that they shall be permitted to wash in this manner, at the water-side. It is a sort of festival; during
<PB N="39" REF="410"/>
which, they think themselves enfranchised from do∣mestic slavery. Standing thus in their tubs, they deal in repartee, and merry altercation with passen∣gers, or hold conversation with their sweet-hearts, who visit them on this occasion, and feast their eyes with the naked beauties of their mistresses. The draught-horses used by the Highlanders in ge∣neral are very small, ragged, and meagre. Carts and waggons they have none; but use, in lieu of them, paltry sledges: in a word, the whole oeco∣nomy of their peasants and labourers exhibits mi∣serable proofs of sloth, poverty, and want of in∣vention.</P>
<P>To the north-east of Inverness, we see the ruins of a fort, built by Oliver Cromwell, on the river Ness, near its issue into the Murray Frith: but the greatest curiosity in this neighbourhood is the fresh-water Loch-ness, above twenty miles long, and two broad, surrounded in many parts by dread∣ful precipices; from whence descend many streams and torrents, above three hundred yards in depth, with a small island at the hither end, formed by two branches of the river, and planted with a va∣riety of trees. The water of this lake, and the river, never freezes, even in the most severe winter season; a phaenomenon said to be owing to veins of sulphur at the bottom: this, however, is not perceivable by the taste, or any other of the senses. There is a communication between the head of Loch-ness and the small lake Loch Oick, about four miles in length. Loch-lochy extends about nine miles in length, communicating with Loch∣aber and the Western Sea; so that there is no more than a neck of land, about fourteen miles in breadth, between them; through which, if a ca∣nal were cut, a conveyance by water would be opened from one side of the island to the other, and the North-Highlands entirely divided from the
<PB N="40" REF="420"/>
rest of Scotland. On the neighbouring heaths, there are some cairns and circles of stones standing erect, like those we have elsewhere described. At the distance of two miles from Inverness stands the house of Culloden, belonging to Mr. Forbes, whose father was lord president of the session at Edinburgh, a gentleman of uncommon talents and unblemished integrity. This edifice is built of stone, strong, large, and commodious, pro∣vided with a noble avenue, good gardens, and parks shaded with beautiful plantations. But what has rendered it most remarkable was the battle of Culloden, fought upon the adjacent moor in the year 1746, when his royal highness the duke of Cumberland obtained a complete victory over the Highlanders, commanded by prince Charles Stuart, pretender to the throne of Great-Britain. The other houses of note in this county are, Ruthen, belonging to the duke of Gordon; Castlestewart, to the earl of Moray; Castledownie, to the late lord Lovat; and Slate, to Sir Alexander Macdo∣nald.</P>
<P>Near the south end of Lochness, at Killechumen, the late field-marshal Wade built a regular fortifi∣cation, called Fort-Augustus, in which there is always a garrison of regular troops to overawe the Highlanders, prevent insurrections, and protect the military roads, which, with incredible pains and perseverance, he carried over mountains, mosses, and morasses; so that there is now a beautiful high∣way into those parts of the Highlands, which were formerly deemed inaccessible. One of these roads begins at Creif, about fourteen miles from Stirling; passes through Glenalmond to Aberfaldy, where it crosses the river Tay on a bridge of free-stone, consisting of five spacious arches, and proceeds to Dalnachardoch: the other road, beginning at Dunkeld, is continued by the Blair of Athol to
<PB N="41" REF="430"/>
the same Dalnachardoch, where both joining in one highway, advances to Dalwhinny: there it is again divided into two branches, one of which stretches to the north-west, through Garva moor, and over the Corieroch mountain, as far as Fort-Augustus: the other directs its course due north to the barracks at Ruthven in Badenoch, and thence by Glengary to Inverness: from hence it proceeds south-westerly across the island to Fort-Augustus, and ends at Fort-William in Lochaber. These excellent roads, which are sixteen feet broad at the narrowest part, include forty bridges thrown over rivers, rivulets, and torrents. Some of these consist of single arches, forty or fifty feet in diameter: some are composed of two arches, one of three, and one of five: they are chiefly founded upon rocks; but this last, over the Tay, is built of Astler stone, three hundred and seventy feet in length; the middle arch is sixty feet in diameter, and bears an elegant Latin in∣scription, to the honour of general Wade, under whose auspices these roads were made and finished by the soldiers, who received extraordinary pay, while they were thus employed. There is a new military road of the same kind, which begins in the neighbourhood of Dumbarton, and penetrates to Inverary, the county-town of Argyle.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>NAIRN.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Nairn, comprehending the west part of Murray, is bounded on the north by Mur∣ray Frith; on the west and south by Inverness, and on the east by Elgin. The length of it amounts to twenty miles, and the breadth to fourteen. The air is temperate and salubrious, and the winters are remarkably mild. The face of the country is rough and mountainous; yet there are some fruit∣ful straths, or vallies, which produce good crops
<PB N="42" REF="440"/>
of oats and barley; but, in general, the country is much better adapted for pasturage. Here are also large woods of fir, and other trees, that afford shelter to the game, of which there is great plenty. A strath is a long, narrow valley, with a river run∣ning through the bottom. Of these, the most re∣markable in this county, are Strath-nairn, on the river of that name, in the south-west part of the shire; and on the south-east side, Strath-erin, on both sides of Findhorne river. Nairn is well wa∣tered with streams, rivulets, and lakes, abounding with fish. In the southern part, there is a small lake, called Moy, surrounding an island, on which there is a castle belonging to the laird of Mackin∣tosh: but the greater part of the shire is peopled by the Frazers, a warlike, Highland clan, whose chief, the lord Lovat, lost his life on a scaffold, for having been concerned in the late rebellion. Here is a great number of villages, but no towns of note, except Nairn, situated at the mouth of the river, which bears the same name, a royal burrough, which gave a title of lord to an antient family, forfeited in the rebellion of 1715. The harbour, which opened in the Murray-Frith, is now choaked up with sand; and the commerce of the town is too inconsiderable to deserve notice. The people in general subsist by feeding sheep and black cattle. About four miles from Nairn stands the castle of Calder, on the river of that name, belonging to a branch of the family of Campbell. In this neigh∣bourhood we find a quarry of free-stone, and many signs of copper. About six miles to the north∣west of Nairn, a new fort hath been lately built, by order of the government, at a place called Ardeseer, a small isthmus upon the Murray-Frith, which it is intended to command.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="43" REF="450"/>
<HEAD>ELGIN.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Elgin is bounded on the east by the river Spey; on the west by Nairn, and part of Lochaber; on the south by Aberdeenshire and Ba∣denoch, and on the north by Invernessshire, from which it is parted by the Frith, and the river Ness. It stretches four-and-twenty miles in length, and about twenty in breadth, including part of Mur∣ray-land, which is portioned out in the three dif∣ferent counties of Inverness, Nairn, and Elgin. Murray-land, in point of climate and soil, is pre∣ferred to any other part in the north of Scotland. The air is mild, temperate, and salubrious: the weather, in fairness and serenity, is a perfect con∣trast to that of the west-side of the island, remark∣able for continual rains and frequent storms; and the soil, which consists of sand, mixed with clay, when duly cultivated, produces all manner of green herbs and fruits in perfection. Murray gives the title of earl to a branch of the Stuart family. Elginshire, to the southward, is moun∣tainous, affording only pasture for cattle: but the low-country yields plenty of corn, and the harvest is remarkably early; and some large tracts are co∣vered with vast woods of oak and fir, some of them ten miles in length. In a word, this county abounds with corn, game of all sorts; beef, mutton, poul∣try; a variety of fish, excellent ale, and aqua-vitae once distilled. The people are civilized, open, hospitable; speak the language, and wear the garb of the Lowlanders; though here is also a mixture of clans, who speak Erse, and observe the customs of the Highlanders. The principal rivers that water Elginshire are the Spey, the Nairn, the Findern, and the Lossie. The Spey is broad and rapid: it rises in Badenoch, and after a serpentine
<PB N="44" REF="460"/>
course of seventy-six miles, passes by Rothes castle, and falls into the German sea at Garmack, afford∣ing an excellent salmon-fishery. The river Nairn takes its rise in the mountains that separate Strath∣ern from Glentarf; divides the valley to which it gives the name of Strathnairn; and, as we have al∣ready observed, disembogues itself into the Murray Frith. The Findern is a continuation of the He∣rin, which rises in Badenoch. It gives the name of Stratherin to the valley through which it runs; then assuming the name of Findern, passes by Turnaway, the town of Forress, and the abbey of Kinloss, and likewise discharges itself into the Frith of Murray. The Lossie is a short river, ri∣sing a few miles above Elgin, and falling into the sea a few miles below that burrough. It produces such abundance of fish, that in the space of one mile, by the village of Germach, and during the few months of summer, fourscore or an hundred lasts of salmon are annually taken, and cured for exportation, besides a great quantity consumed at home, which are killed with spears, or caught in baskets, above the town.</P>
<P>The capital of this sheriffdom is Elgin, a royal burrough, situated in a fertile plain, on the south∣side of the river Lossie, over which there is a stone bridge. From this town, the family of Bruce in England derive the title of earl. It was formerly the see of a bishop, who resided at the castle of Spynie, about a mile from town, a noble seat, beautified with woods and fine gardens, near a lake that harbours all sorts of wild-fowl, and swans in particular. The cathedral appears, from the ruins, to have been a magnificent edifice, inferior to none in the kingdom for extent or workmanship. Elgin, being the county-town, is likewise the seat of a presbytery, consisting of thirteen parishes. The town is tolerably neat, and the market well sup∣plied.
<PB N="45" REF="470"/>
A good number of the Highland gentry reside here during the winter, and form an agreeable assembly; and the adjacent country, which is rich and pleasant, exhibits a great number of seats be∣longing to gentlemen of ample fortunes. At Kin∣loss, in the neighbourhood of Elgin, from which the earl of Elgin derives the title of baron, we see the ruins of an antient abbey, where the body of king Duff, who had been murdered, was dug up by accident, and discovered many hundred years after it had been interred. At the distance of nine miles from Elgin, stands the castle of Rothes, on a small river that falls into the Spey, giving the title of earl to the noble family of Leslie.</P>
<P>Forress, a market-town, and royal burrough, is situated on the west-side of the shire, on the side of a small river, that runs into the Findern. It is the seat of a presbytery, containing ten parishes, and was formerly the county-town. Here are the ruins of an old castle, which heretofore belonged to the kings of Scotland; and in the neighbourhood, we see a very curious tall stone-pillar, or obelisk, three-and-twenty feet high above-ground, adorned with a great variety of figures, engraved in a kind of bas-relief, and supposed to be a monument of a victory obtained by Malcolm Mackenneth, the Scottish monarch, over Sueno, king of Denmark. This, however, is no more than a conjecture, founded on the tradition of the country: for no such victory over the Danes was ever obtained at, or near this place. About eight miles from Elgin is the small town of Aberlour, standing near the Spey, being the seat of a presbytery, composed of seven parishes.</P>

<PB N="46" REF="480"/>
<HEAD>ARGYLE.</HEAD>
<P>Argyleshire, or Argathilia, which, together with Perthshire and the Western Islands, is said to have constituted the antient kingdom of the Scots, while the rest of Caledonia was subject to the Picts and Romans, comprehends Kintyre, Knap∣dale, Askodnish, Cowal, Lorn, and some of the Hebrides. It is bounded on the south by the Irish sea, and the Frith of Clyde; on the east by Perthshire; on the north-east by Lochaber; and on the north-west by several islands. The extent of it from south to north, between the Mull of Kintyre and Lochaber, amounts to ninety miles; and the breadth, in some places, including the isles, to seventy. This country, like all other parts of the Highlands, affords a very wild and horrid prospect of hills, rocks, and huge moun∣tains, piled upon each other in a stupendous and dreadful disorder; bare, bleak, and barren to the view, or at best, covered with shagged heath, which appears black and dismal to the eye, except in the summer, when it is variegated with an a∣greeable bloom of a purple colour. The coast of Argyle is rocky, yet indented with bays and in∣lets, that afford good harbours for shipping. The country is well watered by rivers, brooks, and lakes, abounding with fish; the vales and flat parts of it are cultivated for corn; the mountains feed an innumerable quantity of black cattle, which run wild among the hills in winter as well as summer; the heath and woods, of which there is a considerable number, afford shelter to deer, roebucks, and all sorts of game in great plenty: the circumambient sea, with its locks, bays, and harbours, pours forth myriads of fish; but the innate wealth of the country is dug from the
<PB N="47" REF="490"/>
bowels of the mountains, in iron, copper, lead, and other metals and minerals.</P>
<P>Argyle is the seat of a provincial synod, con∣sisting of five presbyteries and forty-nine parishes; and gives the titles of duke and earl to the noble family of Campbell, the most powerful of all the Scottish nobility. The duke of Argyle is, by he∣reditary right, great master of the king's house∣hold in Scotland, admiral of the Western Isles, general of Denoon castle, and, before the juris∣dictions were abolished, enjoyed other hereditary offices, which rendered him too powerful as the subject of a limited monarchy. He still possesses many royalties; his vassals, even of the name of Campbell, are so numerous, and his influence ex∣tends so far, that he could, on occasion, bring three or four thousand fighting men into the field. Agyleshire is in general peopled by this clan, and affords a great number of castles and seats be∣longing to gentlemen who hold of the duke, and boast themselves descended from his family.</P>
<P>Kintyre, or Cantierre, signifying the Head-Land, and constituting the southern division of this shire, is a peninsula, stretching thirty seven miles from north to south, and seven miles in breadth. It is mostly plain, arable, and populous, inhabited indiscriminately by Highlanders and Lowlanders; the latter being invited to settle in this place by the Argyle family, that the lands might the better be cultivated. It gives the title of marquis to the duke, and is by Lochfyn di∣vided from Argyle-proper. This loch is an inlet from the sea, about sixty miles in length and four in breadth, affording heretofore an excellent her∣ring-fishery. Here are many paultry villages; but the only town of any consideration is Camp∣bell Town, standing on the lough of Kilkerran, a royal burrough, with a weekly market, and the
<PB N="48" REF="500"/>
seat of the presbytery, consisting of ten parishes. It is provided with a safe and commodious har∣bour, secured by an island at the mouth of the bay, and is, in all respects, admirably situated for commerce. Nevertheless, there is very little trade carried on in the place, which is ill built, thin∣ly inhabited, and exhibits all the marks of po∣verty and indigence.</P>
<P>Knapdale, or the second division of Argyleshire, is parted from Cowal on the east, by Lochfyn, borders with Kintyre on the south, with Lorne on the north, by Braidalbin on the north-east, and on the west, by the Hebrides. Its length, from north to south, does not exceed twenty miles, and the breadth in some places may amount to thirteen. It is joined to Kintyre by a neck of land, not above a mile broad, over which the country people often drew their small boats, to save the trouble of sailing round Kintyre. This part of Knapdale abounds with lakes; some of them containing little islands, on which there are castles belonging to differont proprietors. The ground is more adapted for pasturage than grain; but that on the side of Lochaw is fruitful in both. The distance by sea from the Mull, or extreme point of Kintyre, to the Fair Foreland of Colerain, on the north coast of Ireland, does not exceed sixteen miles. The chief town of Knap∣dale is Inverary, on the water, or river Eira, which here falls into Lochfyn. This royal bur∣rough is the seat of a presbytery, consisting of twelve parishes, and gives the title of baron to the duke of Argyle. The town is ill built, small, poor, and inconsiderable; but in the neighbour∣hood stands upon the side of the loch, a strong and spacious castle, built in the Gothick manner, by the present duke of Argyle, commanding a delightful prospect on the lake, provided with ele∣gant
<PB N="49" REF="510"/>
gardens, and surrounded with woods, parks, and plantations, which belonged to the old castle, which was formerly the residence of the family. Here his grace keeps open house, while he him∣self is present; and in the town of Inverary, he has built an inn, in the English fashion, for the accommodation of travellers. Kilmore is another little paultry town, at the distance of five miles from Inverary, built upon a small river, that like∣wise falls into Lochfyn, and the seat of a pres∣bytery, consisting of twelve parishes. Both pla∣ces are admirably situated for commerce, which, as the duke is perfectly well acquainted with all its branches, will, it is to be hoped, flourish un∣der his auspices.</P>
<P>The third division of Argyleshire is Lorne, which gives the title of marquis to the duke of Argyle. It extends above thirty miles in length from north to south; and about nine at its utmost breadth, bounded on the east by Braidalbin; on the west by the islands; on the north by Loch∣aber; and is divided from Knapdale on the south, by Loch Ettif, on the banks of which stands the castle of Bergomarn, wherein the courts of jus∣tice were anciently held. This district, abounding with lakes, is the most pleasant and fertile part of Argyleshire, producing plenty of oats and barley. It once belonged to the antient family of Mac Dougal, still residing on the spot; but devolved to the lords of Argyle, in consequence of a mar∣riage with the heiress, at that time a branch of the Stuart family. The only place of note in this district is the castle of Dunstaffnage, or St. Ste∣phen's Mountain, which formerly belonged to the kings of Scotland, some of whom are here interred: at present it is possessed by the duke of Argyle, and governed by an hereditary cap∣tain.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="520"/>
The fourth division is Argyle, properly so call∣ed, bounded by Knapdale and Cowal on the south; Lochaber on the north; Lennox and the Gram∣pian hills on the east; and Lorne on the west. It lies between Lochfyn and Lochow; which last is a fresh water lake, about a mile broad, but ex∣tending four and twenty in length, including twelve islands, on two of which there are the castles of Enconel and Glenurquhart. This lake, which gives the title of viscount to the duke of Argyle, issues in the river Aw, which, after a course of six or seven miles, enters Loch Ettiff, and this falls into the West Sea, opposite to the isle of Mull: all these abound with excellent trout and sal∣mon.</P>
<P>Cowal, a subdivision of Argyleshire, lies be∣tween Lochfyn and the Frith of Clyde, having the isle of Bute to the southward, and on the north Argyle Proper, with the Grampian moun∣tains. Here are plenty of lakes and streams, a few woods, many mountains, and abundance of heath. Cowal produces some corn, a good num∣ber of cattle, a great deal of game, and a variety of fish, both from the sea and rivers. Here is no other town but the wretched village of Dunoon, inhabited by a few fishermen, formerly the resi∣dence of the bishop of Argyle; but now the seat of a presbytery, including eight parishes. What we have said of the genius, disposition, language, habit, and customs of the Highlanders in general, may be applied to those of Argyle in particular. In point of religion, they are mostly presbyterians; with respect to trade and manufacture, they excel their brethren of the mountains. Some fisheries are car∣ried on with spirit along the coast, and a few pri∣vate adventurers have established a kind of linen manufacture, which affords comfortable subsis∣tence to a good number of both sexes: yet even
<PB N="51" REF="530"/>
here, trade and industry are still in their infancy, and if not very tenderly nursed, will never attain to any degree of maturity.</P>
<P>The shire of Bute, including Arran, has al∣ready been described in our account of the Western Isles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PERTHSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Perth, including Menteith, Brai∣dalbin, Athol, Stratherne, part of Gowree, and Perth Proper, is one of the largest, richest, and fairest counties in North-Britain; bounded by Ba∣denoch and Lochaber on the north and north∣west; by Marr on the north-east; by Argyle and Lennox on the west and south-west; having Clackmannanshire, part of Stirlingshire, and the Forth to the south; the shires of Kinross and Fife to the south-east, and Angus to the east. It ex∣tends above seventy miles in length, and near sixty at its greatest breadth, exhibiting a variety of High∣lands and Lowlands; mountains, hills, dales, and straths, diversified with pasture-grounds, corn∣fields and meadows, rivers, lakes, forests, woods, plantations, inclosures, towns, villages, and a great number of elegant seats, beautifully situated, be∣longing to noblemen and gentlemen. The chief rivers of Perthshire are the Tay, the Keith, and the Ierne, besides a great number of subordinate streams. The Tay, which is the largest river in Scotland, derives its source from the mountains of Braidalbin, spreads itself into a lake, called Loch Tay, fifteen miles in length and six in breadth; then, after a winding course of forty miles, dur∣ing which, it is swelled by many brooks and rivu∣lets, it ends in the Frith of Tay, a broad, navi∣gable inlet, which opens to the sea, not far from the Bay of St. Andrews. The river Keith is fa∣mous
<PB N="52" REF="540"/>
for its salmon fishery, and its steep cataract, near the Blair of Drummond, the noise of which is so loud as to deafen those who approach it. The river Ierne rises from Loch-ierne, a lake seven miles long, in the mountainous country of Strath∣erne: this river, after a course of four and thirty miles from east to west, during which it receives many streams and rivulets, falls into the Tay, at Abernethy.</P>
<P>Free-stone, lead, iron and copper ores, with some lapis calaminaris, are found in different places of Perthshire. The soil, being generally rich and well manured, produces excellent wheat, and all kinds of grain. The hilly country abounds with pasture for the black cattle, horses, sheep, goats, and deer. The heaths, woods, and forests, are stored with variety of game; the rivers teem with salmon and trout; the gardens and orchards are stored with all kinds of herbs, roots, apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, and almost every species of fruit found in South Britain. The houses and attire, even of the commonalty, are neat and decent; and every pea∣sant can produce a good quantity of linen, and great store of blankets, made in his own family. Indeed, this is the case through all the Lowlands of Scotland. Flax is reared by every husband∣man, and, being dressed at home, is spun by the females of his family into thread for linen; this is woven by country weavers, of whom there is a great number through all the Low Country, and afterwards bleached or whitened by the good wife and her servants; so that the whole is made fit for use at a very small expence. They likewise wash, card, spin, and weave their wool into tartan for plaids, kersies, and coarse russet cloth, for com∣mon wearing, besides great part of it, which is knit into caps, stockings, and mitts. Plaids, made of the finest worsted, are worn either plain
<PB N="53" REF="550"/>
or variegated, as veils, by women of the lower, and even of the middling rank: nay, some years ago, ladies of fashion wore silken plaids with an undress: this is a loose piece of drapery, gathered about the head, shoulders, and waist, on which it is crossed, so as to leave the hands at liberty, and produces a very good effect to the eye of the spectator. In the country towns of Perth, and other counties in Scotland, one may, in a sum∣mer's evening, see the females, old and young, sitting at their doors, working at their spinning∣wheels, knitting stockings, and making lace on cushions with bobbins; a little piddling manu∣facture imported of old from France, where it still prevails. The Lowlanders of Perthshire are civilized, hospitable, and industrious: the com∣merce of the country consists chiefly in corn, lin∣nen, and black cattle: there are, moreover, some merchants who trade to foreign countries. We shall now describe Perthshire in its different divi∣sions.</P>
<P>Menteith, bounded on the north by Braidalbin and Stratherne; on the south by Stirlingshire and Lennox; on the east by Fife; and on the west by another part of Lennox, extends forty-four miles from east to west, and twenty-eight in breadth. It derives its name from the river Teith, or Taich, stretches as far as the mountains on the east side of Lochlomond, and gave the title of earl to a branch of the family of Graham. The country is hilly, and neither very populous nor fertile; nor is there any place of note in the whole division, except Dumblaine, standing on the west side of the river Allan, a small, neat town, agreeably situated in a pleasant valley, surrounded with hills, which form a natural amphitheatre. It was here∣tofore a bishop's see, erected by king David I. The ruins of the episcopal palace, of a house
<PB N="54" REF="560"/>
built for canons regular, and of a magnificent ca∣thedral, are still to be seen. The duke of Leeds, in England, derives the title of viscount from Dumblaine; but the place is much more famous for the battle fought in this neighbourhood, in the year 1715, between the duke of Argyle, who commanded the king's army, and the Highland clans under the earl of Mar, who had set up the pretender's standard. At a small distance from Dumblaine, there is a fine seat, which belonged to lord Drummond, viscount of Strathallan.</P>
<P>The district of Braidalbin, stretching two and-thirty miles from east to west, and thirteen, where broadest, from north to south, is a mountainous country, lying among the Grampian hills, sup∣posed to be the country antiently known by the name of Albanii; whence the Highlanders, to this day, call themselves Albinich. It is roughened with mountains and moors; bounded on the west, by Lochaber, Lorn, and Knapdale; on the north and east, by part of Lochaber, and part of Athol; and on the south, by Stratherne and Menteith. It produces plenty of game, and black cattle; is inhabited by Highlanders, said to be the most fe∣rocious in all Scotland; and gives the title of earl to a branch of the Campbell family, which is pos∣sessed of a noble and magnificent seat in this divi∣sion.</P>
<P>Athol, the most northern district, borders on the north, with Badenoch; on the west, with Lochaber; on the east and south-east, with Mar and Gowrie; on the south, with Stratherne and Perth Proper; and on the south-west, with Braid∣albin. The length of it amounts to forty-three miles, and the breadth to thirty. The country exhibits a very rough appearance of mountains, hills, and forest, part of the antient Caledonian forest: yet these are interspersed with fruitful
<PB N="55" REF="570"/>
vallies. Here are several villages, but no towns of any consideration; the people are composed of Highlanders and Lowlanders, though the latter bear the greatest proportion. The most noted place of Athol is Blair castle, seated on the river Tilt, near its influx into the Gurry, a pleasant limpid stream that falls into the Tay. This castle belongs to the duke of Athol, who derives his title from this district, and lives here with great magnificence, the house being a stately edifice, surrounded with fine gardens, parks, and planta∣tions, affording shelter to deer, and all sorts of game. In the same neighbourhood, we see the pass of Gillicranky, rendered memorable by the battle here fought in the beginning of king Wil∣liam's reign, between that monarch's general Mackay, and the Highlanders adhering to king James. These last obtained the victory, though their beloved commander, the viscount of Dun∣dee, lost his life in the engagement.</P>
<P>The stewartry of Stratherne, bounded on the south by Menteith, and part of Fife; by part of Menteith on the west; by Perth Proper on the east; and on the north, by Athol and Braidalbin, extends about forty miles in length, from east to west, and half as much in breadth, deriving its name from the river Erne, which, as we have already observed, takes its rise from a lake of the same name, and, after a winding course of thirty-five miles, falls into the Tay. Stratherne, pro∣perly so called, is a fertile valley, four miles broad on both sides of this river, finely diversified with seats and plantations. The chief of these are Tullibardin and Dupplin castle. The first be∣longs to the duke of Athol, who thence derives the title of marquis: the other is the family seat of the earl of Kinnoul, to whom it gives the title of viscount. This is an elegant house, adorned
<PB N="56" REF="580"/>
with a variety of fine paintings, and having the advantage of a noble park, well planted with fo∣rest-trees. In the neighbourhood, a signal vic∣tory was obtained over the Scots, by a body of English auxiliaries, under the command of Ed∣ward Baliol, competitor with David Bruce, for the Scottish throne. Stratherne is an agreeable country, supposed to be the Ierne mentioned by the Roman writers. It abounds with corn and cattle; woods, peat, and turf for fuel: the Ochil hills, that run along the southern parts, are rich in minerals, particularly copper and lapis calami∣naris; and there is plenty of lead in Glenlyon. At the south-east corner of this district, by the conflux of the Erne and Tay, stands the town of Abernethy, heretofore the capital of the Pictish kingdom; but at present a paultry village, exhi∣biting no signs of its antient magnificence, con∣siderable for nothing but in being the seat of a small presbytery, consisting of five parishes. The only relique of antiquity to be seen in the place is a hollow pillar, or cylinder, seventy-five feet high, and about forty-eight feet in external circum∣ference at the base, built of hewn stone, open at top, and without any inscription. Abernethy gives the titles of marquis and earl to the duke of Dou∣glas, and some individuals of the family are here interred. In the neighbourhood of this town, on the public road, there was a famous stone monu∣ment, called Macduff's cross, distinguished by a barbarous, unintelligible inscription, and said to have been a sanctuary for any person guilty of manslaugh∣ter, provided he could prove himself within the ninth degree of consanguinity to the descendants of Macduff, thane of Fife, by whom the tyrant Macbeth was dethroned. Of this pillar, how∣ever, nothing is now left but the pedestal. At Ardoch and Innerpeffery, we see the remains of
<PB N="57" REF="590"/>
two Roman castella: the fort of Ardoch is the most intire, and best preserved piece of Roman anti∣quity it stands on the water of Kneck, in Strath∣allan: the south side is fortified with five rows of ditches, and six ramparts: three of the four gates are still distinct and plain, as is the praetorium, the spot on which the general's tent was pitched. On the other side of a little bridge is a small barrow, tumulus, or burying-place, in which se∣veral Roman urns and medals were found. On the other side of the river, called the Keir, we perceive a great many circumvallations and ram∣parts of stone, or earth, and regular terraces de∣scending on the declivity of what is called Grin∣ning-Hill. To the northward of fort Ardoch, are the vestiges of a large ditch upon the moor, con∣tinued above two miles; and on the neighbour∣ing hills are two great cairns, distinguished by the names of Cairnwochel and Cairnlee, the for∣mer being the largest of the kind in all Britain. Beyond these, there is another small castellum, call∣ed Cemp's castle. The great Roman military way from Stirling and Dumblaine passes by this hill, in its progress to Innerpeffery; in the neighbour∣hood of which, at the small village of Strathgeth, there is another Roman castellum, with some part of the ditch and ramparts still visible.</P>
<P>The Carse of Gowrie lying on the north side of the Tay, extending fourteen miles in length from Dundee to Perth, and from two to four in breadth, is a rich, plain country, cultivated like a garden, and producing as good harvests of wheat, as are to be seen in any part of Great-Britain. It is in∣terspersed with the seats of gentlemen, and abounds with almost all the necessaries of life. But, from its low, damp situation, the people are subject to agues, and the commonalty in great want of firing. In this district, not far from the
<PB N="58" REF="600"/>
Tay, stands the house of Errol, which formerly belonged to the earls of that name, the chiefs of the antient family of Hay, hereditary constables of Scotland.</P>
<P>Perth Proper, stretching twenty miles in length, and, at some places, fifteen in breadth, is bounded on the north-east, by the Carse of Gow∣rie; on the east, by Angus; on the west, by Stratherne; on the north, by Athol; and on the south, by the Frith of Tay. This is likewise a fruitful country, populous, and well cultivated, abounding with gentlemen who possess opulent estates; with farmers who understand agriculture; and with manufacturers who turn their industry to great account. North-eastward from Perth to Brechin, lies the vale of Strathmore, one of the most fertile districts in Scotland, which gives the title of earl to the noble family of Lyon. Glamis, the seat of this nobleman, standing on the north∣side of the Tay, is a noble palace, by far the largest in Scotland, adorned with lofty turrets and spires, which, being seen through the long vistas of the park, exhibit an ever-varying prospect, like that of a great city. The apartments are large, magnificent, and so numerous, that in the year 1715, fourscore and eight beds were made in it, for the pretender and his retinue.</P>
<P>Perth, the capital of the province, is an agree∣able, populous town, situated twenty miles within land, on the south bank of the river Tay. It was otherwise called St. Johnston's, from a church de∣dicated to St. John, as the patron of the place. It is a royal burrough, second in dignity to the metropolis, the feat of a large presbytery, and gave the title of earl to the family of Drummond, which is now forfeited. Perth, in the reign of Edward I. of England, was possessed by the En∣glish, who secured it with fortifications: but, af∣ter
<PB N="59" REF="610"/>
an obstinate resistance, they were expelled by Robert Bruce. In the year 1715, the rebels made it a place of arms, and retired to it, after the battle of Dumblaine; but they were in a little time dislodged by the duke of Argyle, and re∣treated northwards with the pretender. The town is populous and handsome, the streets are well paved, and tolerably clean at all times, and the houses, though not stately, make a very decent appearance. Here is a large church, an old pa∣lace that belonged to the earls of Gowrie, but now devolved to the crown; a stately town-house, several other public edifices, and houses belonging to gentlemen. A monastery of Carthusians was here established by king James I. of Scotland, who lost his life on the very spot, by the treachery of Athol, and his accomplices. The town was antiently provided with a stone bridge over the river, which an inundation swept away. Perth was formerly one of the richest places in Scot∣land. At present, it is chiefly maintained by the linnen manufacture, and by a tolerable share of trade to the Baltic and Norway: for, though it stands at such a distance from the sea, the tide flows above the town, and brings up vessels of considerable burthen. Dunkeld, standing on the north side of the Tay, at the foot of the Gram∣pian hills, and surrounded with pleasant woods, is the chief market-town of the Highlands, and the seat of a presbytery. The place is beautified with several neat buildings, erected by the duke of Athol. It is a noted pass towards the High∣lands, and supposed to have been formerly the chief town of Caledonia. Its cathedral was dedi∣cated to St. Columba, and the chapter of preben∣daries consisted of black monks, known by the name of Culdees. In the year 1716, Dunkeld was made a place of arms by the Highlanders, who declared for the pretender.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="620"/>
Scone, or Scaan, supposed to be the center of the kingdom, is a royal palace, standing on the north bank of the Tay, famous, in former ages, for the adjoining abbey, founded for the monks of the order of St. Augustine. Here the kings of Scotland were crowned in the fatal chair, said to be brought by Fergus from Ireland, including in its bottom a rough marble stone, formerly in∣scribed with this distich:</P>
<Q><L>Ne fallat fatum Scoti, quocunque locatum,</L>
<L>Invenient lapidem, regnare tinentur ibidem.</L></Q>
<P>The chair was removed from hence by Edward I. of England, and deposited in Westminster∣abbey, where it still remains. Scone gives the title of baron to the viscount Stormont, a branch of the family of Murray. He is also hereditary keeper of this palace, which is large, spacious, and magnificent, though built in the antient man∣ner: some of the pannels are adorned with paint∣ings, performed above two hundred years ago; and here is a bed of fine needle-work, sewed by the hands of Mary, queen of Scots. The house was provided with elegant gardens, a chapel, and offices: but the whole is now fallen into decay. It was in the chapel that king Charles II. took the covenant, when the Scots invited him to this king∣dom. Here the pretender resided three weeks, in all the state of a monarch; while his general, the earl of Mar, lay with his forces at Perth.</P>
<P>Culross is a royal burrough, standing on the side of the river Forth, and formerly included in Fifeshire. The inhabitants of this place carry on a considerable traffick with coals, salt, and a manufacture of girdles, which are round, thin, iron plates, on which the Scots bake their bread, made of oatmeal. In the neighbourhood of the
<PB N="61" REF="630"/>
town stands the noble seat of the earl of Kincar∣din, pleasantly situated on the banks of the Forth, and beautified with gardens, terraces, and plan∣tations.</P>

<HEAD>BAMFFSHIR'E.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Bamff, comprehending part of Buchan, with the countries of Strathdovern, Boyn, Enzie, Strathaven, and Balvenie, extends thirty-two miles from east to west, and thirteen in breadth from north to south. On the south, it is separated from part of Buchan by the river Ugie; on the east, it is watered by the Dovern and the German ocean; on the west, it is bounded by the Spey, and the country of Murray; on the south∣west, it borders on Badenoch, and the Braes of Mar; and on the north, it is confined by the Murray Frith. The face of the country is agree∣ably diversified with hill and dale, not without woods, well watered with rivers, and exhibiting many seats and plantations. The air is pure and keen, the climate healthy, and the soil fertile, producing plentiful crops of corn. The country of Buchan, extending northwards from the river Ugie to the sea, and westward as far as Dovern, comprehending a tract of twenty miles in length, and nine in breadth, is more free from hills and mountains than any other country of the same ex∣tent in the kingdom of Scotland. It is inhabited chiefly by Lowlanders, and gives the title of earl to the chief of the family of Erskine. The coun∣try of Bamff abounds with the necessaries and comforts of life. The pasture-grounds yield sheep, cattle, and horses: the arable lands pro∣duce plenty of corn; while the rivers and sea sup∣ply great quantities of fish. Various minerals have been found in different parts of the shire;
<PB N="62" REF="640"/>
and a piece of amber, as large as a horse, was once cast ashore on the beach. In the moun∣tainous district of Balvenie, on the western side of the shire, watered by the Spey, there is a no∣ted rock, which produces hones and whet-stones, sufficient to supply the whole island. Here are also veins of allom-stone, and springs of allom∣water. Strathalan, another district to the north∣east of Balvenie, abounds with such plenty of lime-stone, that the inhabitants use it as common stone in building their houses; and moreover burn a great quantity of it into lime, which they sell to good advantage in the village of Keith, on the river Dovern. Along this whole coast, there are antient Danish monuments, such as cairns, tumuli, and huge stones standing erect. In Strathaven, a hilly country, lying along the lim∣pid river Avin, which falls into the Spey, we meet with Gordon castle, belonging to the duke of Gordon, the most princely edifice in the north of Scotland, consisting of noble apartments, magnificently furnished, and environed with fine gardens and parks, well stored with fallow deer. The same nobleman possesses several other seats in this county. On the banks of the river Deve∣ron, and in the neighbourhood of the town of Bamff, stands the shell of a princely edifice, of modern architecture, built by Duff lord Braco, lately created earl of Fife in Ireland: but the work was suspended, in consequence of a diffe∣rence between his lordship and the architect; and the former leaving this noble pile unfinished, in a most delightful situation, resides among the wild mountains of Strathbogy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This house is now finished, and the present lord lives in it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among the towns of Bamffshire, we number Bamff, Cullen, Deer-town, Turreff, Fraserburg,
<PB N="63" REF="650"/>
Inverugy, and Keith. Bamff, situated on the coast of the Murray Frith, is a royal burrough, of very little consideration. It was of old secured by a castle, which is now in ruins: this is like∣wise the case with the abbey of Deer, in the neigh∣bourhood, which belonged to the Cistercian monks, and was founded by William Cumin, earl of Bu∣chan. The inhabitants are mostly husbandmen; and here is no other commerce, than that which arises from corn, and the salmon-fishery. The greater part of the adjacent country is occupied by the Ogilvies, a numerous and valiant tribe, headed by the earls of Airly and Findlater, who have elegant seats in this country. Cullen, an antient royal burrough, situated also on the Mur∣ray Frith, is capital of the little district of Boyne, a tract fruitful towards the coast; but in other parts mountainous, and abounding with quarries of spotted marble. Deer-town, on the river Ugie, is remarkable for nothing but being the seat of a presbytery. Turreff, seated on a stream that falls into the Dovern, is a market-town, and seat of a presbytery, standing in an agreeable sporting country, interspersed with the houses of gentlemen. Fraserburg, reckoned the chief town of Buchan, is a sea-port on the Murray Frith, having a large commodious harbour, secured by a pier and bulwark of free-stone, lately built at the expence of Fraser, lord Saltoun, who lives in the neighbourhood. Inverugy is a small inconsi∣derable town, standing near the mouth of the ri∣ver Ugie, commanded by a castle: on the oppo∣site side of the river, there is another, called Craig's Tower, which formerly belonged to the earl-marshal, who was lord of almost all the neigh∣bouring manors; but forfeited his estate and ho∣nours by engaging in the rebellion of the year 1715.</P>

<HEAD>ABERDEENSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Aberdeen, comprehending Mar, the Braes of Mar, Cromar, Strathdee, Strathdon, great part of Buchan, Garioch, and Strathbogy, is bounded on the south, by the river Dee and the Grant's-bain mountains; by part of Murray on the north; by the German ocean on the east; and on the west by the river Spey, and part of Badenoch. It extends near fifty miles from east to west, and about thirty-six from north to south. The air is keen and salubrious, the climate being temperate both in winter and summer. The face of the country is diversified with hill and dale, well watered with rivers, and well furnished with woods. It affords quarries of spotted marble, lime-stone, flint, and slate; and here are springs of allom-water, and veins of stone, from which allom is extracted by boiling. Peat, turf, and wood for fuel, are found in plenty through all parts of this county. The soil, when properly cultivated, yields good harvests, even of wheat, rye, oats, and barley. The hills afford pasture for black cattle, horses, sheep, and deer: the heaths and woods abound with all sorts of game; The sea and rivers swarm with fish; and in some of the rivers, people find mussels, containing large pearls of a fine colour. Aberdeenshire is very populous, and contains a great number of fine seats belonging to noblemen and gentlemen of fortune. The people, who are chiefly Low∣landers, have long distinguished themselves by their sagacity, industry, and talents for business. They carry on a considerable traffick with foreign nations, in various branches of commerce; are civil, courteous, and hospitable, but sharp in their dealings; and, by some of their neighbours, accused of being rather too selfish.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="670"/>
The capital of this county is Aberdeen, situ∣ated in the country of Mar, about fourscore miles north of Edinburgh. It stands upon the rivers Dee and Don, and is in effect divided into two dis∣tinct towns. Old Aberdeen, the seat of a presbytery, built at the mouth of the Don, was formerly the seat of a bishop, having a stately cathedral dedicated to St. Machar, the greater part of which was built by bishop Elphingstone in the year 1500; and here is a noble monument erected to his memory. The church is built of hewn stone, with a lofty steeple or turret, ending in an imperial crown, with a round globe of stone and two gilded crosses. Hard by the church is a library, furnished with a valuable collection of books: but old Aberdeen is chiefly remarkable for the college founded by king James IV. consisting of a principal, sub-principal, regents, or professors, of divinity, civil law, physic, phi∣losophy, and the languages. To these endowments Charles I. added eight bursers out of the revenues, of vacant bishopricks; king Charles II. bestowed upon it the benefices of vacant churches in several dioceses for seven years: from these benefactions it derived the name of the Caroline University. It was erected into an university by a bull of pope Alexander VI. to king James IV. and bishop El∣phingstone, with as ample privileges as those grant∣ed to Paris and Bononia. The town is small, in∣differently built, and inconsiderable, though very antient. About a mile from hence, at the mouth of the river Dee, is New Aberdeen, the county town, a neat, populous, and flourishing city, adorned with churches, hospitals, a fine wharf, a custom-house, and many stately edifices built of hewn stone. The streets are large and well paved, the private houses lofty, and well finished, provided with gardens and orchards, which appear intermingled with the buildings, and at a distance give it the air of a city
<PB N="66" REF="680"/>
built in a wood. The chief of the public edifices is the college, originally a Franciscan monastery, founded by George Keith, earl-marechal, in the year 1593, and from him called the <HI>academia mares∣challana:</HI> it is composed of a principal, four pro∣fessors of philosophy, one for divinity, and one for mathematics; and, together with the old college, forms the university of Aberdeen. Besides this college, there is a grammar school, founded by Dr. Dune, consisting of a master and three ushers. Aberdeen is likewise provided with a school for music, and a library, erected at the charge of the city, well supplied with books, and furnished with mathematical instruments. Among the public buildings, we reckon a bridge over the Dee, about a mile from the city, consisting of seven arches, and built of free stone, at the expence of bishop Gavin Dunbar: a bridge over the Don, consisting of one very lofty Gothic arch: the cathedral dedi∣cated to St. Nicholas; an alms-house, and three hospitals. Aberdeen stands on the beach of the German ocean, covering three hills of an easy ascent, and containing about eighteen thousand inhabitants. It bestows the title of earl upon an antient branch of the family of Gordon, and is, for beauty, wealth, commerce, and extent, the third city of Scotland. The people are civil, polite, and well educated, generally of the episcopal persuasion; so that here are several meeting-houses and chapels provided with organs, in which the English liturgy is read.</P>
<P>With respect to commerce, they are very well situated, having a good anchoring-place for ships in the bay: but the entrance into their tide-haven is very difficult, the channel being narrow, and the bar often shifting. The quantity of salmon taken in the Dee and the Don is altogether astonishing: the best kinds of sea-fish are caught in great abun∣dance;
<PB N="67" REF="690"/>
in particular, herrings, which they pickle for exportation. They raise hogs, and salt them for the same purpose: they carry on several manufactures of linen and woollen, including that of worsted stockings, some of which are knit upon needles of incredible fineness, insomuch that one pair has been sold for thirty shillings. They export their herrings, or woollen commodities, or both, to Dant∣zick, Koningsberg, Riga, Nerva, Stockholm, Ham∣burgh, Norway, all parts of the Baltic, as well as to France and Holland. They send their salmon, linen, and pork, to London; and a great quan∣tity of this last, barrelled up, they sell to the Dutch, as provision for their ships bound to the East In∣dies. In a word, Aberdeen is one of the most thriving and agreeable places in Great Britain. The conversation of the inhabitants is sensible and pleasing: they enjoy most of the polite diversions that are so much coveted in other cities: their mar∣kets are regularly and plentifully supplied with ex∣cellent fish, fowl, and butcher's meat; and every article of expence is so reasonable, that a man may live better in all respects at Aberdeen for three hundred pounds a year, than in London for double that income.</P>
<P>The other towns of Aberdeenshire are Kintore, In∣verurie, Peterhead, Garioch, Kildrummy, Strath∣bogie, Alford, and Ellin. Kintore is a royal borough, situate upon the Don, which gives the title of earl to a branch of the noble family of Keith: in other respects, it is inconsiderable. Inverurie, standing at the conflux of the rivers Ourie and Don, is a royal borough, in the neighbourhood of which king Robert de Brus obtained a signal victory over Cum∣min, the partisan of Edward I. king of England: it is likewise remarkable for a skirmish between the laird of Macleod's men and a party of the rebels under lord Lewis Gordon, in the year 1745, when
<PB N="68" REF="700"/>
the former were discomfited. Peterhead, upon the promontory of Bucchanness, is a market-town and sea-port of considerable commerce, where the Pretender landed in the year 1715. It lies within a small island called Calk-inch, and has two little piers to receive small vessels at high water: but, on the south side of the town, there is a bay or road capable of containing an hundred sail of ships in eight or nine fathoms of water, well secured from the north-west, west, and easterly winds. Garioch, the seat of a presbytery, and chief town of the di∣strict so called, is a small inconsiderable place, situ∣ated in a valley, watered by streams, and sur∣rounded with verdant hills, one of which, known by the name of Mount Bennachy, rises in seven tops so high that it is discerned a good way at sea, though it stands at the distance of fourteen miles from the coast. Kildrummy is an old mar∣ket-town on the south side of the Don, where for∣merly the earls of Mar resided, and where the last nobleman of that name set up the Pretender's standard in the year 1715. Strathbogie, or Strath∣bolgy, giving name to the district so called, stands upon the river Dovern, over which there is a bridge near its conflux with the Bogie, is a market town, the seat of a presbytery, and subsists chiefly by the linen manufacture. The district or divi∣sion of Strathbogie, which king James VI. created into a lordship in favour of the Gordon family, is chiefly inhabited by the vassals of the duke, who possesses a noble seat or castle in this quarter. It is fruitful in corn and pasture, so as to furnish sheep, horses, and black cattle for exportation; and remarkable for fine linen yarn, spun by the good wives, and sold to the merchant manufacturer. The soil of Strathbogie is so rich, and the climate so mild, that the harvest here is more early than in the east parts of Kent and Sussex. Alford, on
<PB N="69" REF="710"/>
the south side of the Don, and Ellen, on the river Ythan, where a presbytery likewise convenes, are paultry towns of little or no importance: but the adjacent country is rich, fertile, and agreeable. In Aberdeenshire, we meet with many monuments of antiquity, such as round Danish forts, single obe∣lisks, tumuli, and cairns.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>KINCARDINSHIRE, or MEARNS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, stretching twenty-seven miles in length, and twenty in breadth, is bounded on the east by the German ocean; on the south by the river of North Esk; on the west, by Angus; and on the north by the river Dee, and Aberdeenshire. The country is pretty plain and level, fruitful in corn and pasturage, producing an infinite number of fir trees, besides a great number of agreeable plantations; and along the sea-coasts there are ma∣ny convenient creeks and harbours.</P>
<P>Stonehive, the seat of the county courts, is a small town with a good haven, improved by the late earl∣marechal, and enjoys a good salmon fishery. Kin∣cardin, another considerable place, stands on the river Dee, and gives the title of earl to a branch of the family of Bruce. Cowy is an antient borough, greatly decayed, and remarkable for nothing but the ruins of a castle, said to have been built by king Malcolm Kenmore. Fourdon, or Mearns, is a small town, the seat of a presbytery, and before the reformation, famous for the reliques of St. Palladius, who was sent over to Scotland in the fifth century by pope Celestine, to enlighten the Scots, and confute the Pelagians. Fourdon is likewise noted as the birth-place of Fordun, author of the Scoti Chronicon, the oldest history of Scot∣land now extant. In the neighbourhood of this town, is Paldy Kirk, deriving its name from St.
<PB N="70" REF="720"/>
Palladius; but remarkable for nothing else except an annual fair, at which great quantities of coarse cloth are bought up and exported to the Nether∣lands.</P>
<P>The most memorable place in Kincardinshire, is the castle of Dunotyr, formerly the family-seat of the earls-marechal of Stotland. It stands almost inaccessible on a steep rock, washed on three sides by the sea, and joined to the land by a narrow isthmus. It is fortified with strong walls and towers, and the old buildings were seven stories high: the new buildings are large and elegant, provided with a good library. Within the close there is a large cistern thirty cubits in circumference; and in the neighbourhood there is a dropping cave, the water of which petrifies and hangs from the roof like icicles. The people of this country are Lowlanders, civil, hospitable, and industrious.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FORFARSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Forfar, including Angus, Glenila, Glenesk, and Glenprassin, extends twenty-nine miles from east to west, and sixteen where broadest, though in some places the breadth does not exceed five miles. On the north it is divided from the Brae of Mar, by a ridge of the Binchinnen mountains; it is bounded on the south by the frith of Tay, and the British ocean; on the east by Mearns; and on the west by Perthshire. Part of the Grampian Mountains runs through this country, which is a∣greeably diversified with hill and dale. It produces lead and iron in abundance, together with quarries of freestone and slate, with which the inhabitants drive a considerable traffic. The county is well watered with lakes, rivers, rivulets, and fountains, shaded with large forests, roughened with brown mountains, and waved with green hills interspersed
<PB N="71" REF="730"/>
with fields and meadows, and adorned with fine seats and plantations. Their heaths and woods abound with hart, hind, roebuck, and moor game; their streams are stocked with trout and salmon. Their hills are covered with flocks of sheep, and their fields afford plentiful harvests of wheat and all sorts of grain. The mountains to the west and north are inhabited by Highlanders; but the Low∣landers possess the towns and champaign country, and are remarkable for their politeness and hospi∣tality, though this last virtue often degenerates into downright debauchery; insomuch that the gentle∣men value themselves upon their prowess in drink∣ing. The common people are sober, numerous, and addicted to traffic. Forfarshire exhibits many monuments of antiquity. At the village of Miggle, in the neighbourhood of Coupar, there are several stones erected in the church-yard, embellished with the figures of different animals and other ornaments. In the church-yard of Glamis, we see an old obelisk or intire stone sixteen feet high, set up over the grave of king Malcolm II. who was murdered by the connivance of his own domestics. This stone is engraved with a number of figures alluding to the regicide; and at a little distance, within the park of Glamis, there is another stone marked with hieroglyphical symbols, which seem to ex∣press the perpetration of the same murder. At the village of Cossens, in the same neighbourhood, a very curious obelisk appears lying in the fields. It is known by the name of St. Orland's stone, and exhibits a great variety of figures in bas relief. There is another small stone inscribed with figures at Balutheren, in the neighbourhood of Dundee. At the distance of a mile to the southward of Glamis, stands Denoon castle, upon an eminence, environed with steep rocks almost inaccessible, hav∣ing on the north two or three rows of terraces. It is
<PB N="72" REF="740"/>
built in a semicircular form, encompassed with a stupendous wall of stone and earth, seven and twenty feet high, and thirty feet in thickness. It has two entries, one to the south-east, and another to the north. The whole circumference of the wall a∣mounts to three hundred and thirty-five yards; and within this area, the ruins of antient buildings are still visible.</P>
<P>The county-town Forfar bestows its name upon the shire, and gave the title of earl to a branch of the noble family of Douglas, which title was ex∣tinguished at the death of the last earl, a gallant youth, who lost his life in the battle of Dumblaine. The town, though inconsiderable, is a royal bo∣rough, and seat of a presbytery. The Scottish par∣liament frequently sat in this place, which was also honoured with a royal palace, of which scarce any ruins now remain. The most flourishing town of this county is Dundee, antiently called Alutum and Taodunum, the birth-place of the historian Hector Boethius. It is situated at the foot of a hill, on the north side of the Tay, not far from this river's influx into the ocean. Dundee is a royal borough, and seat of a presbytery, handsomely built, and inferior to few towns in Scotland, in strength, situation, and commerce. Dundee an∣tiently gave the title of earl and dignity of con∣stable to the family of Scrimgeour, the head of which was hereditary standard-bearer to the kings of Scotland, and possessed a noble seat at Diddup, in the neighbourhood. The title of viscount Dun∣dee was afterwards bestowed upon Graham of Clavers, a valiant partizan of James II. in oppo∣sition to king William. He headed a body of the clans, who obtained a victory over William's troops at Gillicranky; but the viscount lost his life in the engagement. The constabulary of Dundee was afterwards bestowed upon the duke of Douglas,
<PB N="73" REF="750"/>
who, as marquis and earl of Angus, enjoys great superiorities in this county. During the civil wars Dundee made a good defence against the earl of Montrose; but it was afterwards taken by general Monk, who massacred all the garrison, and made himself master of an immense booty. The gen∣tlemen of the neighbourhood had sent thither their best effects for security; and sixty sail of ships were found in the harbour. In the year 1715, the place was possessed by the rebels, and here the chevalier de St. George for some days resided. The town is two miles in compass; and the houses, generally built of stone, are neat and convenient. Here is an open spacious market-place, from whence the town spreads in four large streets, well paved and regular. The great church is a high square build∣ing, larger than that of St. Giles at Edinburgh, with a noble town-house, more spacious than that of the Brill in Holland. Dundee is likewise adorned with several other fine edifices, private as well as public. The harbour, lying two or three leagues within the mouth of the Tay, is large enough to contain an hundred sail of ships; but these not of any considerable bur∣then. The harbour is connected with the town by an agreeable paved walk, shaded with rows of trees. This serves as an exchange for the merchants and ship-masters; and on one side there are large store∣houses for goods, and granaries for corn. The town is large and populous. The inhabitants are gay and wealthy. They carry on a considerable inland traffic in corn and linen, and enjoy a tolera∣ble share of foreign trade. They export to Lon∣don and Amsterdam large quantities of corn brought from the carse of Goury, and the vale of Strathmore.</P>
<P>The second town of Forfar, in point of importance, is Montrose or Monross, antiently called Celuria and Mons Rosarum, standing at the corner of a
<PB N="74" REF="760"/>
small bay fronting the German ocean, betwixt the rivers North Esk and South Esk. The town, consisting of one long handsome street, lying pa∣rallel with the shore, is neatly built and well situ∣ated for commerce, having a good harbour for ships of considerable burthen. The inhabitants are opulent from the effects of industry: they are particularly addicted to commerce, which they have extended to such a degree, that Montrose, for fo∣reign trade, is now one of the most flourishing towns in Scotland. This place gives the title of duke, marquis, and earl, to the noble family of Graham, so distinguished for its valour and integrity; and here it was that the Pretender took shipping for France in the year 1716, when he found himself hard pressed by the duke of Argyle, at the head of his majesty's forces.</P>
<P>On the same coast, by the river Brothock, stands the town of Aberbrothock or Arbroth, a royal borough and seat of a presbytery, situated near the promontory called Redhead, and having a con∣venient harbour for commerce. Here was once a very rich and stately monastery founded by Wil∣liam I. of Scotland, in honour of his friend and intimate acquaintance the celebrated Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury. The founder lies buried in the church, under a magnificent mo∣nument, which he himself caused to be erected for that purpose. On account of this monastery king John of England, at his request, granted to the inhabitants of Aberbrothock, the same privileges through all England except London, that were enjoyed by his own subjects. The patent for this extraordinary indulgence is still preserved among the records of the town.</P>
<P>Brechin is a small town, situated on the river South Esk, over which the inhabitants have built a stately bridge of two arches. It is a royal
<PB N="75" REF="770"/>
borough, the seat of a presbytery, and affords a good market for salmon and cattle. Brechin is memorable for a great battle fought in its neigh∣bourhood in the beginning of the eleventh century, between the Scots and Danes. These last were de∣feated chiefly by the prowess of Keith, who, with his own hand, shew the Danish general. He was immediately after the battle ennobled, and created hereditary earl-marechal of Scotland, a dignity enjoyed by his posterity, until it was forfeited in the year 1716, by the earl's engaging in the cause of the Pretender. Brechin was once a bishop's see: the ruins of the episcopal palace, and the houses in which the canons lived, are still visible. The place was antiently secured by a castle on the south side of the town, which was gallantly defended by Sir Thomas Maule, against Edward the first of Eng∣land: but now there is an elegant house on the spot, belonging to the Earl of Panmure, head of the same family. About four miles to the southward of Brechin, at a place called Aberlemny, we find four or five antient obelisks, one of which is engraved with figures, supposed to be monuments of a great victory gained at the village of Loncarty, by the Scots over the Danes; a victory entirely owing to the va∣lour of an husbandman and his two sons, of the sur∣name of Hay, who were ennobled for their prowess by king Kenneth III. From these descended the earls of Errol, hereditary high-constables of Scotland.</P>

<HEAD>CLACKMANNAN.</HEAD>
<P>The small shire of Clackmannan, not exceeding eight miles in length, and five in breadth, is limited on the north by the Ochil Hills; on the south by the Frith of Forth; on the east by Perthshire; and on the west by Sterlingshire. The country is plain and fertile towards the Frith, producing corn and pasture in abundance. It likewise yields a great
<PB N="76" REF="780"/>
quantity of excellent coal, which is exported to England, France, and Holland. It is watered by the rivers Frith and Devan, and joins the shire of Kinross in sending a member alternately to parli∣ament. Clackmannan, the county town, is a small borough, situated on a rising-ground, about eight and twenty miles from Edinburgh. The castle is a stately edifice, belonging to Bruce of Clackmannan, who was hereditary sheriff of the county before the jurisdictions were abolished. But the most flourishing place of this shire is the vil∣lage of Aloa or Aloway, situated on the Forth, where this river falls into the Frith, a sea-port of considerable trade, which owns a good number of ships, and prosecutes divers profitable manufactures. The inhabitants weave excellent sail-cloth; make ropes; and have erected saw-mills for cutting and splitting timber, which, together with hemp, tar, and other naval stores, they import from Norway, Russia, and Livonia. Here the merchants of Glas∣gow had settled a factory, and erected warehouses for tobacco, sugar, and other American commodi∣ties, for the conveniency of re-exporting them to Holland, Hamburgh, and the Baltic; as well as for stowing such merchandize as they imported from these countries. This scheme however was found to be a pretext, under which the most scan∣dalous frauds were committed, relating to the drawback on tobacco, and other smuggling prac∣tices. The Forth at Aloa is as broad as the Thames at London bridge; and rises so high with every tide of flood, that ships can lie with their sides to the wharf, which is at a small distance from the town, and be loaded and unloaded with∣out the least difficulty. Along the shore there are salt-pans for boiling salt, which is exported in great quantities by ships from Bremen, Hamburgh, Nor∣way, and other parts of the East Country. The
<PB N="77" REF="790"/>
town of Aloa consists of one spacious street, well paved, and shaded with rows of lime trees. The place is large and populous; the houses are neat, and the inhabitants wealthy. Hard by the town stands Alloway castle, which belonged to the earl of Mar, surrounded with beautiful gardens, woods, and plantations, one of the most magnificent seats in Great Britain; whether we consider the edifice itself, the nature of its situation, or the beautiful parterres adorned with statues and vases, the ave∣nues, ponds, and pieces of water, the walks, ter∣races, lawns, and vistas by which it is encompassed. One of these views terminates in the castle of Stir∣ling, which, though no more than four miles distant by land, is about four and twenty by water, tracing the Forth in its beautiful meanders. This superb castle was forfeited to the government, in conse∣quence of the last earl's embarking in the rebellion of the year 1715.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FIFESHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Fife, antiently called Ross, in∣cluding the shire of Kinross, is a peninsula, lying between the Frith of Forth and the Tay, above forty miles in length and seventeen in breadth, bounded on the north by the Frith of Tay; on the south by the Frith of Forth, which divides it from the Lothians; on the west by the Ochil Hills, and part of Perthshire; and on the east by the German ocean. The face of this country is diversified with hill and dale: towards the west it is mountainous; the middle is most proper for pasture: but, the northern and southern parts are plain and fertile, producing excellent corn, full of towns, and indent∣ed with good bays and harbours. The face of the country is enriched with plantations and woods, affording harbour to deer and all sorts of game:
<PB N="78" REF="800"/>
the hills are covered with sheep, whose wool is in great estimation; and the pastures feed plenty of black cattle. Fife produces quarries of excellent freestone, coal mines, and lead ore in great plenty, together with variegated chrystals. It is well wa∣tered by many lakes, rivers, and streams, the chief of which are the Leven and the Eden, abound∣ing with salmon; and the sea that washes the coast affords great abundance of fish. Fife is the most populous province in Scotland, and exhibits a greater number of fine seats belonging to gentlemen and noblemen, than are found in any other shire of the kingdom. The gentry are generous, hospi∣table, and polite, though too much addicted to drinking: the common people are brave and in∣dustrious; but from the nature of their situation, their industry is apt to take a wrong turn, and ex∣ert itself in a smuggling commerce. The whole coast is almost covered with fishing towns, which breed a great number of hardy seamen; and, be∣ing royal boroughs, send a great many mem∣bers to parliament. Among the towns of Fife, we reckon Coupar, Dumfermlin, Falkland, Balmeri∣noch, Inverkythen, Aberdour, Bruntisland, King∣horn, Kircaldy, Dysart, Kinross, Ely, St. Monans, Pittenweem, West and East Anstruther, Crail, and St. Andrews.</P>
<P>Coupar of Fife, the county-town, situated on the river Eden, is a royal borough, tolerably hand∣some, the seat of a presbytery, and well inhabited, though almost quite destitute of trade and manu∣facture. Dumfermlin, situated at the western end of the shire, is a small, neat, royal borough, much decayed in trade, and subsisting chiefly by a manu∣facture of linen and diaper: it is agreeably seated on the river Eden, over which there is a bridge at this town, is the seat of a presbytery, and famous for being a place of residence and burial to many
<PB N="79" REF="810"/>
Scottish kings. Here are the ruins of a royal castle, and a monastery; the first built upon an ad∣jacent hill by king Malcolm Kenmore, the other founded by David I. for Benedictine monks, and finished by one of his successors. Part of it still serves for a church, and is said to be as large and long as the cathedral at Carlisle. At the end of this monastery is a small caemitery, where we see the tomb-stones of king Malcolm and his son Ed∣ward, who were treacherously slain at the siege of Alnwick, as well as that of his queen St. Mar∣garet, sister to Edgar Atheling, the true Saxon heir of the English throne. These tombs are no other than simple grave-stones of coarse marble, plain, unpolished, and uninscribed. King James VI. resided at Dumfermlin, where his children prince Henry, Charles, and Elizabeth, were born. It once gave the title of earl to a branch of the family of Seaton, which is now extinct; and the marquis of Tweedale retains the title of hereditary housekeeper or chamberlain of the royal palace at Dumfermlin, though it is now in ruins. Falkland, situated near the center of the shire, is a neat little town, with an handsome well paved market-place. It stands on the north-east side of the Lomond Hill, a moun∣tain of a vast height, producing fine pasturage, and yielding a very noble and extensive prospect of the adjacent country. Falkland is a borough cor∣porate, of which the king is always provost, and the bailiffs are chosen from the town council. Hard by the town appear the ruins of a palace built by king James V. which, in magnificence and beauty of architecture, exceeded any other edifice in Great Britain. It was built in the form of a square, two stories high, surrounded with rows of marble pil∣lars of the Corinthian order, with a statue on the top of every column, and adorned with sculpture in bas relief, representing the emperors and em∣presses,
<PB N="80" REF="820"/>
between every window. At the entrance stood two stately towers and a chapel on the right hand, likewise adorned with statues as large as the life. This palace was furnished with extensive gardens, and a noble park eight miles in circum∣ference, planted with oak, and well stocked with deer. Two parts of the quadrangle were wantonly burned down by the ruffian soldiers of Cromwell, and the trees felled for timber, to build a citadel and barracks at Perth: the park was also ploughed up, and is now let upon lease, together with the gardens, by the duke of Athol, hereditary keeper of the palace, who draws a considerable income from these lands and the neighbouring stewartry. King James VI. resided at Falkland when he re∣ceived the tidings of queen Elizabeth's decease from the mouth of her kinsman Mr. Carey, whom James forthwith created lord viscount Falkland, a title still enjoyed by his posterity. Balmerinoch, an inconsiderable place on the Frith of Tay, is re∣markable for nothing but the ruins of a famous monastery founded by Ermengrid, wife to William, king of Scotland. It likewise gave the title of baron to a branch of the family of Elphingstone, which was forfeited in the year 1746, by Arthur, lord Balmerinoch, who then suffered decapitation on Tower-hill, for having treasonably joined the son of the Pretender. Innerkythen, a royal bo∣rough at the bottom of the Frith, has the advan∣tage of a good road for shipping, and formerly enjoyed a tolerable share of trade; but is now fallen to decay. Aberdour is a market-town on the Frith, of very little trade or consequence. It gives a title to Douglas, earl of Moreton, who pos∣sesses an agreeable seat in this neighbourhood, almost opposite to Edinburgh. Bruntisland or Burnt∣island, standing on the same Frith, over against Leith, is a paultry market-town with an excellent
<PB N="81" REF="830"/>
harbour, capacious, land-locked, and secure from every wind that blows. From the ruins of a castle, a stately church, and the remains of some other edifices, this seems to have been formerly a place of consequence: at present the inhabitants subsist by strangers that cross the Frith from hence in the passage-boats, or lie wind-bound in the har∣bour; and by a small manufacture of green linen. Kinghorn, on the same coast, is a royal borough, tolerably well built, but exhibiting evident symp∣toms of decay; and indeed this is the case with all the sea-port towns of Fife. Here is a thread manufacture of stockings, knit by the women; as for the men, they are chiefly mariners employed in coasting ships, in the fishery, or the passage-boats from hence to Leith, from which the town of King∣horn derives considerable advantage. The place gives a second title to the earl of Strathmore. Kirk∣aldy, standing on the same beach, two miles farther to the north-east, is likewise a royal borough, the seat of a presbytery, and gives the title of baron to the earl of Melvil. The town is populous, well built, extends a mile in length from west to east, consists of two parishes, and enjoys a tolerable share of trade, by exporting its own produce and manu∣factures of corn, coal, linen, and salt. On the same shore, at the distance of two miles from Kirkaldy, we arrive at Dysart, another royal borough, for∣merly large and populous, and well built, with a commodious harbour and situation well adapted for commerce: but the trade is now decayed, the number of inhabitants diminished, the houses are ruinous, and every thing bears the appearance of poverty. The people subsist by the salt-pans and coal-pits in the neighbourhood, and a few makers of hardware and nail-makers settled in the town. The late lord Sinclair resided at Dysart, which gives the title of earl to the English family of Ptole∣mache,
<PB N="82" REF="840"/>
by means of a marriage with the heiress of Dysart, the patent granted by Charles I. extending to heirs male and female. Kinross, giving name to a shire or county included in Fife, is a small in∣land town, situated on the west side of Lochlevin, a fresh water lake about ten miles in compass, a∣bounding with pike, trout, perch, and water fowl; containing two islands, on one of which appear the ruins of a priory heretofore possessed by the Culdees: the other is famous for the castle in which Mary, queen of Scots, was imprisoned by her rebellious nobles. She escaped from hence by means of the governor's son, joined the Hamiltons and some other noblemen, who preserved their loyalty, gave battle to her bastard brother Murray, at Langside, where her forces being routed, she unhappily fled to England. Ely, a small town upon the coast, inhabited by fishermen and mariners, stands on the western side of the Leven, and has the advantage of a good harbour, secured by a fine mole of free∣stone, built in the last century at the expence of William Scot, baron of Ardross, with so much art and solidity that it might vie with the works of the antient Romans. Here is a little traffic with salt and coal. St. Monans, Pittenweem, the An∣struthers, and Crail, are very poor decayed bo∣roughs, standing on the same coast; but unworthy of any further notice.</P>
<P>The most celebrated place in Fife is the city of St. Andrews, otherwise called Andreanopolis, Fanum Sancti Andreae, and Mons Sancti Reguli. Hither the bones of St. Andrew are said to have been brought from Patras, a town of Peloponnesus, in the fourth century, by Regulus, a Grecian monk, renowned for his piety and learning. St. Andrews was also the principal seat of the Culdees, who directed all sacred institutions from the first con∣version of the Picts to Christianity Here it was
<PB N="83" REF="850"/>
that king Alexander I. founded a priory for the monks of the order of St. Augustine; and hither Kenneth III. translated the episcopal see from Aber∣nethy in the ninth century; so that St. Andrews became the metropolis of the kingdom, the seat of its oldest university, and the see of an archbishop, primate of all Scotland. The city is agreably si∣tuated on the sea-side, near a bay that derives its name from the place, surrounded by fields of wheat, barley, and downs intermingled, in such a favour∣able climate that Cardan, the famous physician and philosopher, who came hither from Italy to pre∣scribe for archbishop Hamilton, declared it was the most healthful place in which he had ever resided. The harbour is formed by a long pier extending into the sea, which is now greatly decayed; so that the anchoring-place is little better than an open road, where ships of any burthen cannot ride in safety. This is the less to be regretted, as the trade and navigation of the place is quite extinguished. St. Andrews was formerly a beautiful city, about two miles in circumference, surrounded with ex∣cellent walls, part of which still remain, consisting of elegant houses built with hewn stone, adorned with magnificent churches, colleges, monasteries, and other public edifices, and inhabited by the most gay, learned, and polite people in Scotland. At present, all its magnificence and splendor are faded; the best houses are forsaken and ruinous; and the number of the inhabitants greatly diminished. They now compute about one thousand inhabited houses, and four times that number of souls in the city of St. Andrews, the very ruins of which strike the beholder with awe and veneration. The antient cathedral was counted the largest in Christendom, and one of the most magnificent Gothic structures in the world. Hard by the ruins of this cathe∣dral, appear the walls of the chapel dedicated to
<PB N="84" REF="860"/>
St. Regulus or Rule, counted one of the most an∣tient monuments of Christianity in Great Britain, together with its square tower above one hundred feet high, built of such durable stone, that for many centuries it hath withstood the injuries of time, and still appears intire. Here are two other churches or chapels dedicated to St. Leonard, and St. Salvator; besides Trinity church, a stately old fabric, of freestone, in good repair, remarkable for the magnificent monument of archbishop Sharp, who was assassinated by fanaticks in the last cen∣tury. Over and above these, St. Andrews contained three religious houses or priories of Franciscan, Do∣minican, and Augustine friars. In a word, this city was famous for sanctity, and before the reformation crowded with religious, who came hither to visit the relics of St. Andrew. It was not only the seat of religion in this country, but the fountain of learning, and still boasts of the oldest university in Scotland. This was founded by bishop Henry Wardlaw, in the year 1412, when he endowed it with ample privileges. It consists at present of three colleges, namely those of St. Salvator, St. Leonard, and St. Mary. The first was built by bishop James Kennedy, grandson to king Robert III. about the middle of the fifteenth century. This munificent prelate at the same time supplied his college with a church and lofty spire of hewn stone; and here is still to be seen his monument of curious workmanship. He spared no expence in this foundation, which he endowed with revenues sufficient to maintain four professors of philosophy, a doctor, a batchelor, and licentiate of divinity, to∣gether with eight poor scholars. This college owns three silver maces as old as the foundation, one of them weighing seventeen pounds, is gilt, and curiously chased. These three, together with six other maces, were, in the reign of Charles II.
<PB N="85" REF="870"/>
found concealed within the tomb of bishop Kennedy, where in all probability they had been hid at the reformation, in order to preserve them from the Gothic rage of the reformers, who destroyed or defaced every thing upon which any kind of ima∣gery was represented. This fabric was repaired and augmented by Dr. Skene, principal of the col∣lege, who likewise founded a library, which soon increased by donations; and the earl of Cassils esta∣blished a fund for the maintenance of a professor of philosophy.</P>
<P>St. Leonard's college was founded before the reformation, by James Hepburn, prior of St. An∣drews, and afterwards endowed by the earl of Lennox. It consists of a principal and four pro∣fessors of philosophy, and eight poor scholars main∣tained on the foundation; and Sir John Scot, of Scots Tarvet, not only established a good salary for a professor of philosophy, but likewise made considerable additions to the library. This was afterwards augmented by a great collection of books bequeathed to it by Sir John Wedderburn, doctor of physic; and at present it contains the manuscript of Fordun's Scoti Chronicon. There is commonly a greater number of students in this than in the other colleges of St. Andrews; and every year they shoot with bows for the prize of a silver arrow.</P>
<P>St. Mary's, or New College, was founded by the famous cardinal archbishop James Beaton, who was assassinated in the castle by Norman Lesly. It con∣sists of two professors, doctors in divinity, and a professor of mathematics. Here the students of the other colleges, having passed through a course of philosophy, may be admitted to finish their edu∣cation. Mr. Gregory, the mathematical professor, erected an observatory in the college garden, and furnished it with proper instruments, by means
<PB N="86" REF="880"/>
of a public contribution. In one of the apartments of this college, which is the most elegant of the three, king Charles I. held a parliament. The rector of the university is chosen annually, and, ac∣cording to the statutes, must be one of the three principals. The students of all the colleges are distinguished by wearing red gowns, and were for∣merly very numerous. But the university, as well as the town, has fallen to decay. Before the re∣volution the archbishop of St. Andrews was always chancellor of the university: but when presbytery was established, the faculty obtained a congé d'elire from king William, to choose the duke of Athol: at his decease they elected the duke of Chandos, who presented them with one thousand pounds to be laid out at interest for the maintenance of a professor of medicine. St. Andrews was hereto∣fore secured by a strong castle, the ruins of which are still visible among the rocks on the sea-side to the northward of the city. Here are also the re∣mains of a strong citadel built by Oliver Cromwell.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ISLE of MAY.</HEAD>
<P>The island of May, about a mile and a half in circumference, lies seven miles from the coast of Fife, almost opposite to the rock of Bass. It for∣merly belonged to the priory of Pittenweem, and was dedicated to St. Adrian, supposed to have been martyred in this place by the Danes; and hither, in times of popish superstition, barren women used to come and worship at his shrine, in hopes of being cured of their sterility. Here is a tower and light house built by Mr. Cunningham of Barns, to whom king Charles I. granted the island in fee, with power to exact two pence per ton from every ship that passes, for the maintenance of the light-house. In the middle of it there is a fresh water spring, and a small lake. The soil produces pasturage for an
<PB N="87" REF="890"/>
hundred sheep and twenty black cattle. On the west side, the steep rocks render it inaccessible; but to the east there are four landing-places and good riding. It was here that the French squadron, having the chevalier de St. George on board, an∣chored in the year 1708, when the vigilance of Sir George Byng obliged him to relinquish his de∣sign, and bear away for Dunkirk. The shores all round the island abound with fish, and the cliffs with water fowl, such as we have described among the rocks of the Hebrides. Before we finish the article of Fife, it will not be improper to take no∣tice of some fine seats belonging to persons of fa∣shion and fortune who reside in this province. The earl of Rothes, who was hereditary sheriff, possesses a fine palace at Lesley, in the neighbourhood of Coupar, situated on the river Leven. This mag∣nificent seat, more resembling a royal palace than the house of a nobleman, was built according to the plan of Sir William Bruce, the Jones of Scot∣land, in the reign of the second Charles. Here it was that James II. while duke of York, resided, when his brother obliged him to retire from Eng∣land. The apartments are splendid and lofty, adorn∣ed with elegant furniture, and a great number of valuable paintings. The gardens at the east end of the house are well laid out, and kept in good order; and towards the south there is a park six miles in circuit, surrounded with a stone wall, furnished with deer, and diversified with clumps of fir, thro' which many beautiful vistas are opened <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This elegant seat was entirely consumed by fire in the year 1755.</NOTE>. The earl of Moray resides at Dinnibersel, a noble seat in the neighbourhood of Aberdour, with extensive gar∣dens, and terrace walks stretching down to the sea∣side. Wemys castle, belonging to the earl of Wemys, stands at the mouth of the Forth, on the top of a
<PB N="88" REF="900"/>
high cliff that commands a very extensive pros∣pect both by land and sea. The building is of freestone, and extends two hundred feet in front, having a terrace on the top of a rock, like that at Windsor. The house is furnished in a magnifi∣cent taste, and surrounded with large gardens, parks, and plantations. The earl of Leven's house, at Melvil, is a large stately quadrangle, with a noble avenue and large fir plantation. At the west end of Lochleven stands the house of Kinross, belonging to Sir John Hope Bruce, which is the most beautiful and regular piece of architecture in all Scotland, planned by Sir William Bruce, sur∣veyor general of the works in that kingdom, and architect of the palace of Holy-rood-house at Edinburgh. The house of Kinross is built of fine white freestone, adorned with columns of the Corinthian order, and crowned with a noble lan∣thorn at top: the offices under ground are vaulted, and the apartments above elegantly disposed. The gardens are large; and there is an extensive wood, through which divers fine avenues and vistas are opened.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>STIRLINGSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Stirling or Striveling, extending twenty miles in length and twelve in breadth, is bounded on the west by part of Lennox and Clyds∣dale; on the east by Clackmannanshire and the river Forth; on the east and south-east by Lothian; and on the north by Monteith. The face of the country is open and agreeable, diversified in hill and dale, shaded with woods and plantations; well watered with streams and rivers, the chief of which is the Forth or Bodotria, rising in the neighbour∣hood of an high mountain called Ben-Lomond, and running eastward into the Frith of Edin∣burgh.
<PB N="89" REF="910"/>
The southern part is hilly, affording plenty of game and pasturage for sheep, horses, and black cattle. The eastern part is fertile, produ∣cing plentiful harvests of corn, and great abun∣dance of coal. Lead ore is found in different parts of the shire, which is full of agreeable seats be∣longing to the noblility and gentry; and the lakes and rivers teem with pike, trout, and salmon.</P>
<P>The people are chiefly Lowlanders, and pres∣byterians; and live by farming, fishing, or the weaving manufacture. Stirling, the capital of the county, which derives its name from <HI>Ster,</HI> a Saxon word, signifying hill, and <HI>lin,</HI> water, was antiently called Binobara, of the same signification in the Scottish language. The town, which is large and populous, stands about thirty miles from Edin∣burgh, on the descent of a hill, the top of which is crowned with a stately old castle, of which the earls of Mar were formerly hereditary castellans, kept in repair and garrisoned by the government. The town is inclosed with a wall, except towards the north, where the part of a fosse is supplied by the river Forth, over which the inhabitants have built a stone bridge, consisting of four stately arches, and secured with an iron gate. As Stirling is counted an important pass into the Highlands, the castle, which is naturally strong, has been streng∣thened with new batteries and ramparts, and well supplied with artillery. In the late rebellion it was defended by general Blakeney, at the head of a small garrison, against the rebel army, which un∣dertook the siege of it; but relinquished their de∣sign at the approach of the king's forces. The royal apartments within the castle, built by king James V. are spacious and magnificent, adorned with carved work and figures in stucco upon the ceiling; and, in a word, inferior to none in Eu∣rope. To these belong a noble hall, roofed
<PB N="90" REF="920"/>
with Irish oak, like that of Westminster, in which ambassadors had their audience, and the parliament was often assembled. The citadel was formerly provided with a church for the garrison and king's retinue, as well as with a private chapel in the palace for the royal family. Above the king's apartments there are elegant lodgings for the go∣vernor; and without the walls there is a large park belonging to the castle. The town is nobly situated, well built, upon the declivity of a hill, which commands a prospect of the charming wind∣ings of the Forth, as well as of Edinburgh castle, the town of Alloway, a great number of fine seats, and distant views of other counties. The principal street is large and handsome; the market-place is spacious; and the town house a stately building: in the upper part, to the eastward, appears the great church, a lofty edifice, with a very high tower. The earl of Mar's palace on the top of the hill over-against the town house, and a fine seat near the castle, belonging to the duke of Argyle, contribute greatly to the beauty of the place. Stirling is the seat of a presbytery; has a weekly market well supplied; is admirably situated for trade in the centre of Scotland, on a navigable river; af∣fords divers manufactories of linens and shalloons; and gives the title of earl to the family of Alex∣ander. Sir William Alexander prevailed upon king James I. of England to institute the order of the knights of Nova Scotia, and he was afterwards en∣nobled; and in the sequel, king Charles I. ad∣vanced him to the dignity of earl of Stirling. This family fell into decay, and their seat was purchased by the grandfather of the present duke of Argyle. At the distance of half a mile from Stirling, we see the ruins of the famous abbey of Cambus∣kennet, the stones of which were carried away and used by the earl of Mar in building his palace;
<PB N="91" REF="930"/>
and under an hawthorn tree hard by these ruins, lies the body of king James III. who was defeated in this neighbourhood by his own nobility, and slain in his flight from the battle, which was fought at Bannockburn. This place is also fa∣mous for the overthrow of the English army com∣manded by Edward II. amounting to one hundred thousand fighting men. They were here encountered by Robert de Brus with less than one third of that number, and sustained the greatest defeat that ever happened to the English since the establishment of the monarchy. The earl of Warrenne, before this period, had been defeated by Wallace, in attempt∣ing to pass the river with his army, by a wooden bridge in the neighbourhood of Stirling. Falkirk, situated at the distance of eight miles from Stir∣ling, on the south side of the Frith, is a small neat market-town of great antiquity, built upon the Roman wall of Antoninus, which extended six and thirty miles across this isthmus, from the Frith of Forth to the river Clyde, in the neighbour∣hood of Dumbarton. Falkirk, which had been famous for a great victory obtained by the English over Wallace and two other Scottish generals, was rendered still more remarkable in the year 1745, by the defeat of the king's troops, who were here routed by the young pretender, at the head of his Highland army. Extensive ruins are perceived in the neighbourhood of this town, supposed by some antiquarians to have been the capital of the Pictish government; but others, with more reason, believe them to be the remains of some stations belonging to the famous Roman work which is still visible within three miles of Falkirk, and ap∣pears to have consisted of two ramparts, two ditches, and a causeway, provided at proper distances with stations or forts that were garrisoned, square watch towers, and exploratory turrets; and running from
<PB N="92" REF="940"/>
Kirkpatrick in Dumbartonshire, to the house of Carrin, on the River Forth, about two miles to the westward of Abercorn. On the north side of the river Carron are two round artificial mounts, called Duni Pacis, supposed to have been raised as monuments of a peace concluded between the Romans and the Caledonions; but more likely to be exploratory mounts, such as are found at other places in the course of Antoninus's wall, vul∣garly called Graeme's Dyke. At the distance of two miles and an half more easterly, near the end of the isthmus, appeared the famous Sacellum, known by the name of Arthur's Oven, and called by Buchannan <HI>Templum Termini,</HI> the most intire and curious monument of Roman antiquity that re∣mained in Great Britain. It was built of hewn freestone, without lime or mortar, the wall being about three feet in thickness, of a round cylindrical form, and open at top, two and twenty feet high, twenty-eight feet in external diameter, norrowing upwards to the aperture, the diameter of which amounted to eleven feet six inches. This building stood on the declivity of a rising-ground, sup∣ported by a basement of stones projecting from below, as a foundation to the edifice, which was provided with an arched door, a window, and a double cornice. Various have been the conjectures concerning the use of this building, which most historians and antiquarians suppose to have been a temple or place of worship, though they have widely differed in their opinion about the deity to which it was dedicated. The author of the Itine∣rarium Septentrionale, has assignedsome reasons for believing it to have been a sacellum or chapel con∣tiguous to the camp of Agricola, in which the vexilla or ensigns of the legions were deposited. Be that as it may, every lover of taste and an∣tiquity must be seized with an emotion of grief
<PB N="93" REF="950"/>
and indignation, when he reflects that a few years ago this noble monument was demolished by the more than Gothic barbarity of the gentleman on whose ground it stood, that he might employ the stones in building a mill-head. Along the tract of the Roman military way, we find the remains of several forts or castella, and a great many stones with Roman inscriptions, dug out of the great val∣lum, are still preserved in the college of Glasgow, and in the cabinets of the curious. The flat country about Falkirk is supposed to have been once overflowed, because anchors have been dug out of the ground at some distance from the river, the sides of which are here low and marshy. At Crieff, near Stirling, a Highland fair is yearly held, and above thirty thousand head of black cattle are here sold for ready money to English drovers.</P>
<P>Those of the inland parts subsist by breeding cattle and farming: but the people settled on the sea-shore and banks of rivers, employ themselves in the herring and salmon fishery. The frith of Clyde, and some of the adjoining bays, afford im∣mense quantities of the best herrings, which are cured and barrelled for exportation. The rivers Clyde and Leven abound with excellent salmon, and those penetrate by the Leven as far as Loch∣lomond, which is replenished with a variety of other fish, trout, pike, perch, flounders, and eels, exclusive of the powan, a species of the eel pecu∣liar to this lake, in great esteem for its delicate fla∣vour. A considerable quantity of coarse woollen cloths, plaids, and fine linen, is made for sale by private persons in this county, which produces plenty of flax; and there is a spacious bleaching-ground on the banks of the Leven, where linen is whitened at an easy rate: many good housewives, however, save this expence, and whiten their own manufac∣ture with the hands of their own family.</P>

<HEAD>DUMBARTONSHIRE, or LENNOX.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Dumbarton, stretching four and twenty miles in length and twenty in breadth, is bounded on the south with the river and frith of Clyde; on the west by Lochlong and Argyleshire; on the north by the Grampian Hills; and on the east by Monteith and Stirlingshire. Great part of this county consists of hills and heath, fit for no∣thing but pasturage and sport; even in the lower lands the soil is not extremely fertile: yet the face of the country is agreeably diversified with hill, dale, mountain, heath, streams, lakes, woods, and fields of corn: the shire is likewise beautified with a great number of agreeable seats and plantations, belong∣ing to gentlemen of fortune. Part of this county is washed by the river Clyde in its course to the sea: even at the castle of Dumbarton, the breadth of it amounts to two miles at high water, and it continues extending in width and depth until it joins the ocean. From the mouth of the Clyde, the two bays of Lochlong and Lochfyn, make large indentations in the shire of Dumbarton. The only river of any consideration that runs through this county, is the Leven, the Lelanonius of Ptolomy, otherwise called Levinia, the Latin name for Len∣nox, an appellation by which Dumbartonshire is often distinguished. The river Leven is a pure transparent pastoral stream, that warbles o'er a bed of pebbles, through a delightful vale adorned with farms, seats, woods, and plantations. It derives its origin from the great lake called Lochlomond, of which indeed it is the overflowing, and, after a delightful meandring course of five or six miles, disembogues itself into the Clyde at the castle of Dumbarton. But the greatest curiosity of this county is Lochlomond itself, a vast body of fresh water,
<PB N="95" REF="970"/>
supplied by subterraneous springs and rivulets, sur∣rounded with huge mountains, extending five and twenty miles in length, and in some places five miles in breadth, incredibly deep in every part, interspersed with four and twenty verdant isles, some of which are stocked with red deer, and in∣habited. Nothing can be more wildly romantic than this part of the country during the summer season, on the south side of the lake: the high road runs in some places through natural woods, overhung on one hand by steep mountains, covered with flowery heath; and on the other opening in long vistas upon the lake, terminated by green islands that seem to float upon the water. Among the rivers of this shire we shall likewise mention the water of Blane, which, though itself an incon∣siderable stream, hath been rendered famous by the birth of George Buchannan, the celebrated Latin poet and historian. He was born on the north side of the lake, not far from the place called Bu∣channan, where we may behold an elegant seat be∣longing to the duke of Montrose, head of the noble family of Graham, so often distinguished by its loyalty, integrity, and valour. The same part of the country gave birth to the great mathematician and naturalist, Napier lord Merchiston, inventor of the logarithms. The title of Lennox, with the property of great part of the shire, was heretofore vested in a branch of the royal family of Stuart, with which it was reunited in the person of king James VI. whose father, Henry lord Darnley, was son to the duke of Lennox. This prince confer∣red the title upon his kinsman Esme Stuart, son of John lord D'aubigney in France: but, his race failing at the death of Charles, duke of Lednox and Richmond, and the estate devolving to the crown, king Charles II. conferred both titles on his own natural son, by the dutchess of Portsmouth;
<PB N="96" REF="980"/>
and they are still enjoyed by his posterity. The people of Dumbartonshire are chiefly Lowlanders, though in some parts of it divine service is per∣formed in the Erse language. The most numerous clans in this district, are the Macfarlans, the Col∣quhouns, and the Buchannans. They generally profess the protestant faith, according to the pres∣byterian discipline; yet some of the gentlemen fol∣low the English ritual. The commonalty are for the most part sober, honest, and industrious; and though they live poorly, are tall, vigorous, and healthy. Near the mounts called Duni Pacis, stands the burgh of Kylsyth, famous for a great victory obtained in this neighbourhood, over the presby∣terians, by James, the great marquis of Montrose. Kylsyth gave the title of vicount to a branch of the family of Levingstone; but the title is now for∣feited by attainder. Callender castle, in the eastern part of Stirlingshire, belonged to the chief of the same family, Levingstone, earl of Linlithgow and Callendar. At the village of Cumbernauld, stands the seat which belonged to Fleming, late earl of Wigtoun; and in the neighbourhood is the house of Elphingston, possessed by the baron of that name.</P>
<P>Dumbarton, the county-town, which bestows its name upon the shire, is a small inconsiderable royal burrough, situated near the conflux of the Clyde and Leven; and at present remarkable for nothing but its castle, which has been described by the pens of Buchannan and Cambden. It is a steep rock, rising up in two points, and every where in∣accessible except by a very narrow passage or entry, fortified with a strong wall and rampart. Within this wall is the guard-house, with lodgings for the officers; and from hence a long flight of stone steps ascends to the upper part of the castle, where there are several batteries mounted with cannon,
<PB N="97" REF="990"/>
the wall being continued almost round the rock. In the middle of this upper part where the rock divides, there are commodious barracks, with a deep well, in which there is always plenty of water. Here likewise are the remains of a gateway, and pro∣digious high wall, at the top of which there was a wooden bridge of communication from one rock to another. This gateway was sometimes blocked up during the intestine commotions of Scotland, so that garrisons of different factions possessed diffe∣rent parts of the castle, and each had a gate to∣wards the water. The castle stands in the angle formed by the Clyde and Leven at their conflux, so that it is wholly surrounded with water, except a narrow isthmus, which with every spring tide is overflowed: nor is there any hill or eminence with∣in a long mile of this fortress. It commands the navigation of the Clyde, and being deemed the key of the Western Highlands, is kept in some repair, and garrisoned with invalids, under the command of a governor and some subaltern officers. The government of it, worth 365 l. a year, is at present vested in the honourable colonel Archibald Mont∣gomery, brother to the earl of Eglintoun The little town of Dumbarton, which stands in the neighbour∣hood of the castle, on the banks of the Leven, was of old a flourishing city, capital of the Cumbrian king∣dom of the Britons, and for a considerable length of time under the immediate protection of the Roman stationary camp, maintained to defend the wall of Antoninus or Graeme's Dyke, which ends or be∣gins at Kirkpatrick, within three miles of Dum∣barton. The antient inhabitants called that place Alcluith, from the castle standing on the bank of the Cluith or Clyde: but the Scots and Picts gave it the name of Dunbrittan, or castle of the Britons, from which it was corrupted into Dumbarton. In the eighth century it was reduced by the Sax∣ons under Egbert, king of Northumberland, assisted
<PB N="98" REF="1000"/>
by the Pictish king Onust; it afterwards fell into the hands of the Scots, and for some time carried on a considerable traffic: but great part of it was destroyed by an inundation, and it met with va∣rious other disasters; in consequence of which it is dwindled into a little inconsiderable borough, the seat of a presbytery, subsisting by the garrison, the gram∣mar school, which has been always in some reputa∣tion, a small fishery, and some piddling efforts in the way of trade and manufacture. There is no other town in this county, except Kirkintulloch, which stands in the eastern part of the shire, a small borough of very little consequence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RENFREWSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Renfrew, or Reinfraw, stiled the Barony by way of eminence, because it was the an∣tient inheritance of the Stuarts, is a small county, extending about twenty miles from north to south, and thirteen from east to west, parted from Dum∣bartonshire by the river Clyde on the west; bor∣dering on the east with Lanerkshire; and on the north with Cunningham. The face of the coun∣try is varied with hill and vale, wood and stream; crowded with populous villages, and adorned with the seats of gentlemen. The soil is in general fertile, producing rye, barley, oats, pease, beans, flax, and some wheat; it likewise yields plenty of coal and turf for fuel; and affords abundance of pasturage for sheep and cattle. The inhabitants are Lowlanders, and presbyterians, wealthy and industrious, addicted to traffic, and particularly ex∣pert in the linen manufacture. Their genius is stimulated to commerce, by the example of their neighbours of Glasgow, as well as the convenience of the river and frith of Clyde, along the course of which they are situated. Renfrew, the county
<PB N="99" REF="1010"/>
town, standing on the small river Cathcart, which flows into the Clyde at the distance of five miles from Glasgow, is a small but antient royal borough, the seat of the sheriff's court and of a presbytery. The town is neatly built, and the inhabitants enjoy a tolerable share of commerce. But it yields greatly in point of importance to the village of Paisley, the seat of a presbytery, four times as large as Ren∣frew, and flourishing by means of the linen ma∣nufacture. It stands about three miles from Ren∣frew, on the little river of Cart, over which the in∣habitants have built a stone bridge; and is famous for its abbey, founded in the twelfth century by Alexander II. high steward of Scotland. It was instituted for monks of the order of Cluny, who for many ages continued a chronicon of the nation, known by the name of the black book of Paisley, which agreed in every material fact with the Scoti-Chronicon of Fordun, and is by some people sup∣posed to be the same performance. At the refor∣mation, the abbey, with all its dependencies, was given to the family of Hamilton, who converted it into a lodging house; and it afterwards became the property of the earl of Dundonald, whose male issue failing, the title has devolved to another branch of the family of Cochran. Paisley gives the title of baron to the earls of Abercorn, the first of whom was a younger son of the due de Chatel∣heraut. It stands upon the descent of a rising ground that slopes from the praetorium of a Roman camp, fortified with fosses and ramparts, which seem to have encompassed all the ground on which the town is now built. The area of the praetorium, when walked upon, emits a hollow sound, arising probably from subterranean vaults. At a small distance from hence we see two small tumuli, sup∣posed to have been stations for the advanced guards of the camp. In the neighbourhood of Paisley,
<PB N="100" REF="1020"/>
there is a remarkable spring which ebbs and flows with the tide, though it is situated much higher than the surface of the river. On the side of the Frith, about ten miles below Renfrew, the mer∣chants of Glasgow have built a neat little sea-port town, called Port Glasgow, with a commodious har∣bour for the reception of large ships and vessels that cannot sail up the river. Two miles nearer the sea, stands Greenock, a thriving well-built hand∣some town, having a secure harbour formed by three noble stone piers or quays, extending a con∣siderable way into the sea, and connected along shore by a large elegant wharf, on which the mer∣chants have built a range of neat warehouses for merchandize. Greenock lies so near the ocean, and its harbour is so accessible and secure, that the greater part of the Glasgow shipping deliver their cargoes, and are loaded again at this town; so that the hurry of business is transferred hither from Glasgow. The place is adorned with an elegant custom-house, and commanded by a fine seat built on the top of an eminence, that seems to overhang the town. This noble house, with large parks and plantations, belonged to Sir John Shaw, at whose death it de∣volved to his grandson, lord Cathcart. Almost adjoining to Greenock, we pass through the village of Crawfurd's Dyke; and on the west side, near the mouth of the Frith, and at the entrance of a fair bay, stands Gourock, a small fishing town, having the advantage of a tolerable road and har∣bour. The sides of the Frith and river of Clyde are beautified with several handsome villas; of these the most remarkable is Findlastone, belonging to the noble family of Cunningham, earl of Glencairne. Stuart, lord Blantyre, resides at Erskine, on the banks of the Clyde, opposite to Kilpatrick, a small village hard by the wall of Antoninus; and from
<PB N="101" REF="1030"/>
hence both sides of the river, as high as Glasgow, are decorated with genteel houses and plantations. The lords Ross, Sempill, and Cathcart, have family seats in this county: but it contains no other towns than those we have mentioned, nor any other place of note except Langsyde, about six miles from Paisley, famous for the remains of an old Roman camp, as well as for the disaster of Mary Stuart, queen of Scots, who was here defeated by her na∣tural brother, the earl of Murray, and obliged to seek for shelter in England.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANERKSHIRE, or CLUYDSDALE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Lanerk, otherwise called Cluydsdale, from the river Clyde, by which it is watered, stretches forty miles in length from south-east to north-west, and four and twenty at its utmost breadth. It is bounded on the south-east and south by Anandale and Dum∣friesshire; on the north-west and north by Renfrew∣shire and Lennox; on the east and north-east by Linlithgowshire and Sterlingshire; and on the south-east by part of Mid-Lothian. It is divided into two districts, called the upper and nether ward; the first, which is roughened with hills and barren heaths, may be denominated the shire of Lanerk; the other be distinguished as the barony of Glasgow. The Clyde derives its source in the upper ward from Errick Hill, which likewise gives rise to the Tweed and the Annan; and these three rivers pursue different courses. The Clyde falls into the Deucaledonian sea; the Annan discharges itself into Solway Frith; and the Tweed runs into the German ocean. The country of Cluydsdale, though in some places barren, mountainous, and embrowned with heath, is in general pleasant and fertile, exhibiting intermingled landskips of wood and water, hill and valley. Even the naked moun∣tains are rich in minerals, producing abundance of lead ore, impregnated with a large proportion of
<PB N="102" REF="1040"/>
silver. Such are the mines belonging to the duke of Queensberry, and the earl of Hopton, at the lead hills washed by the rivulet of Wanlock, which employ some thousands of hands, and en∣rich the proprietors. On the sides of the Wanlock, among the sand and soil swept down from the mountains by torrents, the labourers find often small pieces of pure virgin gold; certain signs that there must be a gold mine in that neighbourhood. Little bits and particles of the same precious metal have been found in Crawford Moor, together with large pieces of lapis lazuli. In the reign of James VI. Cornelius, a German alchymist, found a gold mine at Crawford John in this county, from whence, in thirty days, he sent half a stone weight of pure metal to the mint at Edinburgh. Cluydsdale is for the most part a corn country, abounding with oats, barley, rye, and producing a considerable quantity of wheat; while the hilly parts afford ex∣cellent pasturage and plenty of game. It yields also great store of freestone, limestone, excellent coal, together with peat and turf for fuel. It is adorned with a great number of agreeable seats; nor is it deficient in Roman antiquities: for it is penetrated from one end to the other by a Roman causeway or military way called Watling-street, running from Grukstone to the borders of Ren∣frew. Cluydsdale and Lanerk give the titles of marquis and earl to the duke of Hamilton, whose fortune and influence lie chiefly in this province, which is noted for the number of its gentlemen landholders. Cluydsdale is very populous, inha∣bited by Lowlanders, who profess the presbyterian religion, in which they have signalized their zeal even to a degree of fanaticism. The shire being an inland country, the common people chiefly em∣ploy themselves in farming, breeding sheep and cattle, and in the linen manufacture. Lanerk, the
<PB REF="1050"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A View of Glasgow.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="103" REF="1060"/>
county town, is a royal borough, and seat of a pres∣bytery; but in other respects thinly inhabited, and of little importance. It stands upon the banks of the Clyde, over which there is a stone bridge built at a great expence by the inhabitants. At the distance of a few miles from the town, the river tumbles over a precipice forty feet high, producing a cataract that roars with a hideous noise, deafening those who live in its neighbourhood. Below the town, the Clyde is increased by the small river Douglas, which waters a district called Douglasdale, deriving this appellation from the noble family of Douglas, whose chief <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late duke dying without issue, the title is extinct.</NOTE>, the duke of Douglas, resides in an ancient castle, situated near the banks of this river. At the distance of ten miles from Lanerk stand the castle and burgh of Crawfurd Town, remark∣able for nothing but giving the title of earl to the noble family of Lindsay: a title, which by the death of the late earl, has now devolved to the viscount of Garnock, sprung from the same house, though his surname is changed from Lindsey to Crawford, in consequence of a marriage. But the chief place of Lanerkshire, and indeed the great emporium of the west of Scotland, is the large, elegant, and flourishing city of Glasgow, containing near thirty thousand inhabitants. It is pleasantly situated, about thirty miles from Edinburgh, on the descent of a gentle eminence, and the adjacent plain, ex∣tending to the banks of the river Clyde, over which there is a stately stone bridge of seven arches. The greater part of this fine city is laid out in a regular plan, the streets crossing each other at right angles. The houses are in general lofty, built of hewn stone, and near the cross, or market-place, supported upon arched pillars, which form a commodious pi∣azza before the shops, and give an air of nobleness to the buildings. The streets are well paved,
<PB N="104" REF="1070"/>
clean, straight, and spacious: in a word, Glasgow is the most beautiful town of Great Britain, adorn∣ed with a great number of public edifices, such as the cathedral and five or six other elegant churches, the tolbooth, town hall, and several hospitals, whose lofty turrets and spires yield a magnificent prospect at a distance. In the highest part of the city stands the cathedral, a vast pile of Gothic building, dedicated to St. Mungo or Kentigern, who was bishop of Glasgow in the sixth century, and here lies buried between four pillars. Nothing can be more stupendous than the architecture of this cathedral, ornamented with two spires, one of which rising from a square tower in the middle of the cross, is surprisingly high and beautiful. In the other, there is a bell of vast dimensions, which when tolled, shakes the whole fabrick. This pile of building is now divided into three separate churches, where divine service is performed every Sunday. Hard by the cathedral we see the ruins of a castle, which was the archiepiscopal palace, when Glasgow was the see of a metropolitan: it is now the seat of a presbytery and provincial synod. The churches are all stately buildings, and some of them are built on the best models of architec∣ture: but one of the greatest ornaments of Glas∣gow is the university, consisting of one college, founded in the year 1453, by king James II. of Scotland, in consequence of a bull from pope Nicholas V. vested with all the privileges and honours which had been granted by the apostoli∣cal see to that of Bononia. The edifice, consisting of an outward and inner square, with a lofty tower and front of hewn stone towards the city, was built in the year 1454, at the expence of William Turnbull, bishop of Glasgow, and is a noble monu∣ment of that prelate's munificence. At the ori∣ginal institution it was composed of a rector, a dean of faculty, a principal, or warden, to teach
<PB N="105" REF="1080"/>
theology, and three professors of philosophy: in the sequel there was an establishment for some cler∣gymen to give lectures on the civil and canon law. In the reign of James VI. the institution was chan∣ged, the foundation improved by a new charter and grants, which were afterwards confirmed by that king's son and grandson. Divers arch∣bishops, noblemen, gentlemen, and private eccle∣siastics, have been benefactors to this university, which is well provided with able professors in the different branches of theology, mathematics, phi∣losophy, and the languages. Every branch is taught by its own separate regent or professor, who, not contented with giving general lectures, attends assiduously to the business of his class, where he explains, sets tasks, and examines his pupils like any other school-master: besides, the individuals of every class undergo a public examination an∣nually, in presence of all the regents; and provided they be found duly qualified, are admitted to the degree of master of arts, after a certain standing. Here are likewise professors of the civil law, church history, Hebrew, medicine, anatomy, and botany; so that, upon the whole, the college of Glasgow may be deemed the most flourishing university in Scotland. Besides the divinity hall, the old li∣brary, and the common hall, which are large and spacious, the inner quadrangle contains a great number of commodious apartments for the students. The faculty has lately built an handsome library, which is pretty well filled with books and manu∣scripts; and here are deposited many stones with Roman inscriptions, brought from the wall of An∣toninus. The regents for the most part live in an elegant row of houses, a little detached from the college; and behind there is a pleasant garden laid out in walks for the benefit of all the members of the university. Adjoining to this, there is a bo∣tanical
<PB N="106" REF="1090"/>
garden well supplied with simples, classed alphabetically in their different tribes. The pro∣fessors, while in the exercise of their functions, wear black gowns with open sleeves, and the students are all distinguished by red or scarlet gowns, with∣out which they are not allowed to appear in publick. Many ancient professors have taught, and a great number of learned men have been produced in this university; the rectorship of which being annually elective, is always vested in some nobleman or person of distinguished fortune. The tolbooth, or public jail of Glasgow, is a venerable Gothic building, provided with chimes that play certain tunes at stated periods, by means of a barrel; and are besides played upon a whole hour every day, by a person hired for that purpose, the bells being furnished with keys like those of an harpsichord. Adjoining to the tolbooth, the citizens have built a magnificent town hall; and on the street before it, stands an equestrian statue of king William III. They have likewise taken in a piece of ground called the Green, that skirts the river, and planted it with trees for a publick walk to the inhabitants. The harbour is no more than a simple wharf or quay for the convenience of small craft, as no ves∣sel of any burthen can come so far up the river. At a small distance above the harbour, stands the town workhouse, with an infirmary, built with elegant simplicity. The institution is founded upon an excellent plan, conducted with great sa∣gacity, and proves such an effectual provision for the poor, that there is not a beggar to be seen within the precincts of Glasgow. The people of this city are remarkable for their industry, their commercial spirit, their punctual observance of the presbyterian discipline, and their steady attachment to the reigning family, which they have more than once signalized in a very extraordinary man∣ner:
<PB N="107" REF="1100"/>
yet here too, there are some episcopalians, who have erected a neat meeting house, in which the English service is performed. The merchants of Glasgow are wealthy and adventurous. They have established a great number of manufactures in different branches of traffic, which produce great quantities of linen, checks, stockings, inkle, and almost every commodity which formerly they fetched from Manchester and other parts of Eng∣land. They have built mills for splitting iron, and forges for making nails. They refine sugar, and distil spirit from the dregs, or molasses; and pro∣secute tobacco through all the operations to which that plant is subject after its importation. They send annually a considerable number of ships to Virginia and the sugar islands, where their agents keep stores supplied with their own manufactures. They equip yearly some vessels for the whale fishery on the coast of Greenland, and extend their commerce to the Baltic, and all the East country. Their commerce increases every day, and flourishes the more by the favour of their situation so near the sea, that their ships are immediately disentan∣gled of the land, and fairly entered in the Atlantic ocean. In consequence of this advantage, their voyages are less indangered in time of war, and much more short than those undertaken from Lon∣don and other places in the British channel, through which the navigation is tedious and hazardous, both from the winds and the enemy. Their ships are cleared and delivered at Greenock and Port Glasgow, near the mouth of the Frith, and the cargoes sent up the river in lighters to Glasgow.</P>
<P>The shallowness of the Clyde from Dumbarton castle upwards, has been found such an obstruction to trade, that they have resolved to deepen the channel by contracting the banks, and esta∣blishing locks in certain places: a laudable re∣solution,
<PB N="108" REF="1110"/>
which we hope will be executed with spirit and dexterity.</P>
<P>On the other side of the river, about two miles above Glasgow, stands the town of Rutherglen, a royal borough, ill built, dirty, small, and in∣considerable. Hamilton, situated about eight miles higher up the river, is a large pleasant vil∣lage, well built and populous, deriving its name from the duke of Hamilton, whose palace stands at one end of the town. It is a modern build∣ing of hewn stone, consisting of a corps du logis, and two wings, suitable in grandeur and magni∣ficence to the dignity of the owner, who is the first duke of Scotland. The apartments are spa∣cious and lofty, adorned with elegant furniture, and many excellent pieces of painting. The park is walled round, seven miles in compass, stocked with fallow deer, well planted with oaks, firs, and other trees, and watered by the pleasant river Aven, which runs through this inclosure, and falls into the Clyde. On the side of this stream, over∣hung with woods, stands the summer house of Barncluith, on the top of an eminence, from which to the river appear seven hanging terrace walks, one over another. In a word, whether we consider the palace, the offices, the gardens, or the park, every thing is noble and princely. At the distance of two miles from Hamilton, we see the ruins of Bothwell castle, standing on the banks of the Clyde; and in the neighbourhood, the bridge of that name, rendered famous for the defeat of the fanaticks, who were routed in this place by the duke of Monmouth, in the reign of the second Charles. They had taken up arms in consequence of some restrictions which they inter∣preted into religious oppression; but being desti∣tute of leaders, and unacquainted with discipline, they fled at the first onset. Hard by the castle of
<PB N="109" REF="1120"/>
Bothwell stands the house of Forfar, in which the late earl of that name resided; and in the neigh∣bouring church there are some stately tombs be∣longing to the Douglas family. At the death of the late earl, who was slain in the battle of Dum∣blane, this house and estate reverted to the duke of Douglas, from whose family he had descended.</P>
<P>Besides this, and the other houses we have men∣tioned, there is in Clydesdale a great number of seats and castles, such as that of Castle Crawford, belonging to the earl of Selkirk; Bog-hall, where the late earl of Wigtoun sometimes resided; Wester-hall and Carmichael, possessed by the earl of Hyndford; and Blantyre, from whence the nobleman of that name derives his title.</P>

<HEAD>LINLITHGOWSHIRE, or WEST LOTHIAN.</HEAD>
<P>This small county, not exceeding fourteen miles in length, and thirteen in breadth, is bounded on the north by part of Sterlingshire and the river Forth; by part of Cluydsdale on the west; and on the south and west by Mid-Lothian, from which it is divided by the rivers Breich and Almond. The country is pleasant and fertile, abounding with corn and pasturage. Here is found plenty of coal, lime∣stone, and lead ore; nay, in the reign of James VI. it produced a rich mine of silver. The chief town, Linlithgow, from which it borrows the name, is a royal borough and seat of a presbytery, standing on the side of a small lake, about eighteen miles from Edinburgh: it consists of one open street, from whence lanes are detached on both sides; the houses are built of stone, tolerably neat and commodious; and the place is adorned with some stately public edifices. On the side of the lake stands a royal palace, magnificently built of hewn stone, begun by king James V. and perfected by his
<PB N="110" REF="1130"/>
grandson. Within the inner court, which is larger than that of Hamilton, there is an artificial foun∣tain, adorned with statues and water-works; and at each corner of the square a tower, with a range of fine apartments. Hard by the palace is the church of St. Michael, a noble structure, with a very high steeple. The inhabitants carry on a great manu∣facture of linen, and bleach it with the water of this lake, which is noted for its whitening qua∣lity: they likewise enjoy a tolerable share of trade by means of a good harbour on the Forth, where they have built a custom-house, and magazines or warehouses for the use of the merchants. Hard by this harbour stands the castle of Blackness, be∣longing to the crown, formerly used as a state prison, but now quite ruinous. The chiefs of the Levingstone family were earls of Linlithgow and Calendar, hereditary keepers of the palace in this town, and hereditary constables of Blackness castle. The last of these noblemen forfeited his estate, and honours, by engaging in the rebellion of the year 1716.</P>
<P>At the distance of two miles from Linlithgow stands Burroughstonness, on the same coast, a burgh of regality, consisting of one street, built along the shore. The people of this town export considerable quantities of coal and salt, and main∣tain some trade with France and Holland. This town holds of the duke of Hamilton, whose ad∣joining house of Kenneil is a fine seat, agreeably embellished with wood and water. Abercorn, within four miles of Linlithgow, situated near the Frith, is supposed to be the Kebercurning of Bede, in whose time here was a famous monastery. The family of Douglas once possessed a castle at Aber∣corn, which now belongs to the earl of Hopton, though it gives a title to the Irish branch of the Hamiltons. On this spot the earl of Hopton has

<HEAD><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="111" REF="1150"/>
built one of the most magnificent seats in Great Britain.</P>
<P>Torfichen, two miles from Linlithgow, is a small burgh of regality, where the knights of Malta formerly resided: it now gives the title of baron to the chief of the Sandilands. Three miles from Blackness is the Queen's Ferry, a small royal bo∣rough, at the point of St. Margaret's Bay, deriving its name from this lady, queen of Scotland, who from hence used to cross the Forth into Fife. It still continues to be the common ferry from Lo∣thian to that county, the Forth being here about two miles in breadth. In the middle there is a small rocky island called Inchgarvie, with the ruins of a castle once mounted with artillery, which commanded the channel of both sides.</P>
<P>Linlithgowshire abounds with great houses, a∣mong which we number Cragie Hall, belonging to the marquis of Annandale; Kirkhill, the seat of the earl of Buchan; Newliston, where the late field∣marshal earl of Stair resided; Carridden, apper∣taining to the earl of Dalhousie; and Barnbougle, the residence of the earl of Roseberry. There is besides a good number of elegant seats possessed by private gentlemen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EDINBURGHSHIRE, or WEST LOTHIAN.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Edinburgh stretching one and twenty miles in length, and of a different breadth at different places, from five to sixteen miles, is bounded on the east by East Lothian; on the west by the shire of Linlithgow; on the south by Tweedale; and on the north by part of West Lo∣thian and the Frith of Forth. The aspect of the country is in general level and pleasant, interspersed with a few hills, that help to exhibit agreeable pros∣pects. It is well watered with rivers, and shaded
<PB N="112" REF="1160"/>
with woods. It produces plenty of coal, limestone, a soft black marble, and some copper ore. The soil, of itself fertile, is finely cultivated, and yields as plentiful harvests of excellent wheat, as are found in any part of Great Britain. The whole shire is interspersed with noble houses and plan∣tations belonging to noblemen and gentlemen of fortune. The farmers are master of the science of agriculture, and wealthy in consequence of their skill, some of them paying five hundred pounds of yearly rent. The country is well inhabited, and presents us with a good number of towns and populous villages. Along the sea coast the common people subsist by fishing, and traffic in coals and salt, and some few carry on a smuggling commerce. Those in the inland are employed in farming, and some branches of the weaving ma∣nufacture. The sheriffalty of this shire is in the gift of the crown; and Edinburgh is a county in itself. This antient city, in Latin Edinum, the metropolis of Scotland, and heretofore the royal seats of its kings and parliaments, stands upon the declivity of an eminence, above a mile from the sea coast, four hundred miles north of London, and together with its castle forms a very noble appearance. The castle stands at the upper end, upon a steep solid rock that commands the city and the adjoining plains. It is as well for∣tified with modern works as the nature of its situation would permit; well furnished with artil∣lery and ammunition, and supplied with a gar∣rison of regular forces, detached from the regiment that is quartered in the suburbs. This castle has been distinguished by the name of <HI>Castrum alatum,</HI> but this name is of very obscure derivation; unless we suppose it derived the epithet <HI>alatum</HI> or winged, from two high rocks which stand at a small di∣stance like wings, one on each side; that on the
<PB N="113" REF="1170"/>
right being called Salisbury Craggs, the other Caltoun Craggs. In all probability the castle was founded in the ninth century by Edwin, king of Northumberland, whose dominions extended to the Frith of Forth; and having built this fortress, to defend his frontiers from the incursions of the Scots and Britons, it naturally took the name of Edwin's-burgh, or Edinburgh.</P>
<P>Within the precincts of the castle there is a royal palace, with some noble apartments, in one of which king James VI. was born. Here the deputy governor resides; here the national magazine of arms and ammunition is kept; and here the re∣galia with some old records are deposited. The place is provided with a chapel for the use of the garrison; and furnished with two wells cut out of the solid rock. The situation of this citadel is al∣together imperial, commanding an extensive pros∣pect towards the mouth of the Frith; is seen at a great distance, and saluted by every ship of war that anchors in the road of Leith. Notwithstand∣ing its natural and artificial strength, it has been reduced several times, and could not hold out three days against the modern art of besieging. In the year 1745, it was blocked up by the adherents of the young Pretender; but as he had no artillery nor engineers, and the deputy-governor fired upon the town, which lies immediately under the guns, he raised the blockade at the request of the inha∣bitants. From the castle gate and draw-bridge, a broad bank or terrace extends a few hundred paces to the beginning of the high street; this is called the Castle Hill, used as a public walk, on which the company take the air in summer, and enjoy a noble prospect on both sides of the Frith. The High Street of Edinburgh, counted the most spa∣cious in Europe, stretches with an easy descent from the hither end of the Castle Hill, a long mile in a direct line to the abbey or palace of Holy-rood-House,
<PB N="114" REF="1180"/>
which terminates this noble avenue: one half of this, however, belongs to the suburbs called the Canon-gate, from a society of canons regular, who founded the abbey. The High Street of Edinburgh, properly so called, extends no farther than the Netherbow port, one of the city gates, which is grandly ornamented, and crowned with towers and spires, that exhibit a magnificent ap∣pearance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gate is now removed, so that the street extends with∣out interuption from the Castle∣hill to the abbey.</NOTE>. This is the extent of the city to the eastward; and from hence the town wall runs south and north in a straight line. To the south∣ward of the High Street, and parallel with it, runs another more narrow called Cowgate, so denomi∣nated from the cattle driven through it to the Grass-market, a broad open street at the western extremity of the town, immediately under part of the castle, which rises over it in a steep precipice. To the south side of the Cowgate, the city spreads upwards on another gentle rising, and is every where surrounded by a wall, except on the north, where a small lake called the North Loch serves instead of a fosse. The wall is furnished with seven gates, on the outside of which there are large suburbs; so that Edinburgh is an extensive city, about four miles in compass, and surely, con∣sidering its scite, the most populous in Europe; for the number of inhabitants amounts to fifty thousand. The Grass-market is connected with the High Street by a long, narrow winding lane, called the West Bow, so steep that no carts or wag∣gons can ascend it; and the main street sends off on each side narrow lanes called wynds, to the Cow∣gate, and towards the North Loch, which is a stinking pool, choaked up with all the filth which comes from this side of the metropolis. The High Street of Edinburgh is in all respects noble and magnificent, whether we consider the houses
<PB N="115" REF="1190"/>
on each side built of ashler work, to the heighth of five and six stories; or the street itself extending to a great width, finely paved with smooth square stones, rising in the middle, and sloping on each side to a kennel of hewn freestone, that conveys the rain water by which the causeway is occasion∣ally washed. At proper distances there are elegant conduits continually flowing with delicious water, supplied from a reservoir on the Castle-hill, which is filled by subterraneous leaden pipes brought from fountains at the distance of a mile to the southward of the city. The people of Edinburgh were so hampered for want of room, by the na∣ture of their situation, that they have been obliged to raise the houses to a surprizing heighth: in one particular part where they are built on the slope of a steep hill from the Canongate to the Parlia∣ment Close, some of them rise twelve stories from the foundation. Every floor or story of this city is a separate tenement, like those of the inns of court in London, and the access to them is by a common staircase, which, if winding, is here called a turnpike. The great height of the houses is attended with numberless inconveniencies, and in cases of fire, renders the situation of the inhabitants very dreadful. The nature of the stair-cases, common to many different families, and free to the feet and filth of all comers; the difficulty and expence of carrying a sufficient quantity of water so high upon the backs of porters; and the want of necessary-houses, contribute to fix the imputa∣tion of nastiness on this otherwise magnificent city. The stairs are dirty, dark, and dangerous: all the apartments, even of the best houses, though nicely rubbed, and elegantly furnished, yet retain some smell of the convenience with which every lodging chamber must be provided: but the most disa∣greeable consequence of this expedient is, the
<PB N="116" REF="1200"/>
nocturnal discharge of those nauseous reservoirs. At ten of the clock every window is opened, and such a general deluge of these materials poured forth, that the whole air is impregnated with a most unsufferable odour, and the foot passenger in the most imminent danger of being over-whelmed with the most substantial part of the an∣noyance.</P>
<P>In former times, the dispersers of these benefits taught, in all probability, by their polite allies, the French, were accustomed to give warning, by calling aloud <HI>gardez l'eau;</HI> but now all that ce∣remony is laid aside, and woe will be upon the head of that man, who presumes to walk down the wynd at or about the hour of evacuation, with∣out crying <HI>hold your hand</HI> incessantly, until he finds himself fairly housed. This ordure is cleared away very early in the morning by scavengers ap∣pointed for that purpose, except on Sundays, when those conscientious cleansers, out of mere piety, rest from their labour, leaving the streets in a very nauseous condition. The truth is, however strangers may be disgusted with these filthy cus∣toms, the natives of Edinburgh are, by use, be∣come insensible to the annoyance; and when they perceive new comers giving marks of loathing and abhorrence, generally impute them to false deli∣cacy and affectation. Their neighbours of Eng∣land, it must be owned, have some reason to twit them in the teeth with these and other unsavoury practices.</P>
<P>The city of Edinburgh is adorned with stately churches, spires, and public edifices. The cathe∣dral, dedicated to St. Giles, is a noble Gothic build∣ing, now divided into four different churches or kirks, belonging to different parishes. The spire is a very lofty tower, with a large open cupola of curious workmanship, representing an imperial
<PB N="117" REF="1210"/>
crown, and furnished with a set of well toned bells, on which all manner of tunes are played every day except Sundays, between the hours of eleven and twelve, as an entertainment to the merchants and men of business, who are then assembled at the cross or market-place, to transact their affairs. In a chapel, on the south-west part of this church, the general assembly of the kirk hold their sessions. Besides the cathedral, there are six other stately churches in the city and suburbs of Edinburgh; two elegant chapels, now converted into halls; and above twelve meeting-houses for the use of those who adhere to the church of England. The mint of Edinburgh, now in disuse, forms a large court, provided with neat and convenient buildings for the overseers and workmen. Here are other courts, such as James's Court, Milne Square, and the Par∣liament Close, which last is a noble quadrangle in the heart of the city, adorned with a fine eques∣trian statue of king Charles II. At one side of this square is the parliament house, from whence it derives its name, a large structure of freestone, built by Charles I. In the room where the par∣liament formerly assembled, causes are now tried and determined by the lords of session: in diffe∣rent parts of the same building, the justiciary or criminal court, the sheriff, and commissary courts, are held: near the north end is the town-council, house, or guild-hall: underneath is the post-office, the register office for all deeds and securities; and adjoining to it, the library of the advocates or bar∣risters at law, a noble collection of books, manu∣scripts, medals, and coins, with some Roman and other antiquities. In the Parliament Close there is likewise a spacious apartment for the convention of the royal boroughs. The Tolbooth, or common prison for debtors and criminals, stands near the west end of the great church, and here a guard
<PB N="118" REF="1220"/>
of regular troops was always kept while the so∣vereign resided in the palace of Holyrood-House: at present the peace of the city is preserved by a guard consisting of two companies of soldiers, uni∣formly cloathed and maintained by the community, and commanded by a captain, under the direction of the magistrates. Edinburgh is provided with two banks that issue notes for twenty shillings, cur∣rent all over the kingdom. The market-cross, where all proclamations and public acts were read and published by sound of trumpet, was a curious piece of architecture, but lately demolished, in order to disincumber the street: on the north side, opposite to the Parliament Close, the citizens have begun to build a new exchange for the merchants on a very elegant plan; and they have projected many other improvements, which we hope they will one day be able to execute. Among the hos∣pitals of Edinburgh, the most remarkable is Her∣riot's work, a magnificent structure, situated on an eminence at one side of the Grass-market, op∣posite to the castle: it was founded by George Herriot, goldsmith to king James VI. who left seven thousand pounds sterling for the maintenance and education of poor children belonging to the merchants and tradesmen of this city. It was built upon the plan of Inigo Jones, consisting of an exact square, with piazzas all round; built of freestone, embellished with carved work, and a∣dorned with towers and turrets. A statue of the founder, as big as the life, stands in a niche over the inside of the gate. The entry is by an easy ascent, through three spacious courts; the apart∣ments for the officers and scholars are neat and commodious; the gardens are large, well dis∣posed in delightful walks and grottos: in a word, this hospital has all the air of a royal palace. The magistrates of the city are the perpetual guardians
<PB N="119" REF="1230"/>
of this noble charity, by which one hundred and thirty boys are cloathed, fed, educated, and put out as apprentices at a proper age. Edinburgh con∣tains divers other hospitals, a workhouse like that of Glasgow, a noble infirmary, including cells for lunatics, built and supported by voluntary con∣tribution, and a bridewell, or house of correction, for prostitutes. In Fountain-close, near the Nether∣bow, is the college of Physicians, incorporated by patent under the great seal of Charles II. giving them ample jurisdiction, and certain privileges with∣in the city. On the south side of the Cow-gate is the high school for Latin, supplied with a master and four ushers; and in the neighbourhood, the surgeons hall, adorned with some good portraits and preparations in anatomy. On the north side of the town is a physic garden, exhibiting above three thousand plants, regularly classed for the use of the students in botany. On a rising ground, to the southward of the Cow-gate, stands the college or university, founded by king James VI. in com∣pliance with a petition from the city. The dig∣nity of chancellor or vice-chancellor is vested in the provost, the other magistrates, and town council for the time being: the institution is well supported by very able professors in divinity, philosophy, philology, and especially in medicine, which is here taught in all its branches by men eminent for their learning and ability. It is accordingly crowded with students from all parts of the island, and may be justly deemed the best medical semi∣nary in Europe. The buildings of the college are tolerably neat and commodious. The professors are accommodated with good houses and gardens: the scholars meet in their respective classes at stated hours; but they do not lodge in the college; nor are they distinguished by wearing gowns, like those of the other Scotch universities. This college
<PB N="120" REF="1240"/>
is endowed with all the privileges granted to any other university: it confers the degrees of master of arts and doctor; and is provided with a very good library, under which there is a royal printing house. Towards the south end there is a noble musaeum collected by Sir Andrew Balfour, M. D. who was tutor to the famous earl of Rochester.</P>
<P>On the south side of the town there is a piece of ground called the Meadow, agreeably laid out in walks for the recreation of the citizens: from the outside of the Nether-bow Port, a narrow street called Leith Wynd, stretches along the city wall southerly; and from the end of this, a noble walk is continued to Leith, which is the sea-port of Edin∣burgh. At the extremity of the suburbs called the Canon-gate, stands upon the ground formerly occupied by an abbey the royal palace of Holy∣rood-house, begun by James V. and finished by Charles II. according to a plan of Sir William Bruce, that king's architect for Scotland. It con∣sists of an outward court, having a majestic en∣trance, adorned with stone pillars, and a balustraded cupola above, in form of a crown; within there is a magnificent quadrangle finely paved, with an arcade all around. The rooms of state are large, lofty, elegantly furnished, and every way suitable to a royal palace. There are besides, noble apart∣ments for the great officers of state, particularly for the duke of Hamilton, hereditary keeper of the palace. In one gallery we see the portraits of the Scottish kings from the first Fergus, who is said to have reigned three hundred and twenty years before Christ, to William III. prince of Orange: but they are, for the most part, paultry pieces, drawn from the imagination of the painter; and indeed one may perceive that the majority have been paint∣ed by one hand. Behind the palace stands the cha∣pel, which is no other than the conventual church
<PB N="121" REF="1250"/>
that belonged to the old abbey, with a very lofty roof, and two rows of stone galleries, supported by very curious pillars. James VI. and his son Charles were crowned in the chapel. Here it was that king James VII. created a magnificent throne for the sovereign, and twelve stalls for the knights companions of the order of the thistle, curiously carved and adorned by the best workmen in Europe; the floor was beautifully paved with marble, and a fine organ was set up: but all these ornaments were destroyed by the blind fanaticism of the po∣pulace at the revolution, since which period the chapel has been falling gradually to decay. The people, in their Gothic rage, not only tore up the pavement, but even penetrated into a vault built up, in which were found the bodies of king James V. his first queen Magdalene of Valois, and lord Darnley, husband of queen Mary. These were embalmed, and are still shewn to strangers. The royal garden, at the northern end of the outward court, has been long ago converted into a botanical nursery, where the different plants are arranged ac∣cording to their tribes; and on the southern side, there is a large garden elegantly disposed in walks, parterres, and inclosures, which, in all likelihood, likewise belonged to the palace.</P>
<P>The adjoining park, about four miles in cir∣cuit, is now a bare piece of ground, without tree or shrub, bounded on one side by a steep hill, known by the name of Arthur's Seat; and about half way up this hill are the ruins of a chapel, de∣dicated to St. Anthony.</P>
<P>The city of Edinburgh is governed by a lord provost, four bailiffs, a dean of guild, and a trea∣surer, annually chosen from the common council. Every company or incorporated trade chooses its own deacon, and here are fourteen, namely, sur∣geons, goldsmiths, skinners, furriers, hammer-men,
<PB N="122" REF="1260"/>
wrights or carpenters, masons, taylors, bakers, butchers, cordwainers, weavers, fullers, and bonnet∣makers. The train bands consist of sixteen com∣panies, besides the town guard, which is a standing militia. When any public work begins to decay, or a sum of money is required to defray any ex∣traordinary expence for the benefit of the com∣munity in the cities and boroughs of this kingdom, they by their representatives apply to the British parliament for a tax of two pennies Scots to be laid for a certain period, upon every Scots pint of ale sold within the precincts of the petitioning bo∣rough. This easy imposition, which is scarce felt by the inhabitants, enables them to discharge old debts, repair decayed fabricks, maintain and im∣prove harbours, and execute many works of public utility. By this temporary tax established at Edin∣burgh, and the discontinuance of what was called the petty port customs, the water was brought in leaden pipes to the reservoir we have already men∣tioned, the conduits were rebuilt, the harbour of Leith was enlarged, the channel deepened, and the quay lengthened several hundred feet; two new churches were raised, and the roads leading to the city secured with an excellent pavement; a work∣house was built for the poor, and endowed with three hundred pounds sterling per annum; the city walls were repaired, and stipends settled on a professor of law and two ministers appointed for the new churches. The markets of Edinburgh are well supplied with all kinds of butcher's meat, fish, poultry, game, greens, and fruit, at reasonable rates, and every species is sold in its own distinct markets. The bread is remarkably fine; the but∣ter and cheese inferior to that which is made in England. Here is plenty of small claret, and Portuguese wines neat as imported. There is good entertainment in the taverns, though the
<PB N="123" REF="1270"/>
cooks are not over cleanly, and abundance of fine table linen. Private lodgings are here reasonable and commodious; but the inns of Edinburgh are dirty and uncomfortable. The people of this me∣tropolis are sensible, sprightly, and much more polite to strangers than to each other when they happen to differ in point of religion or politicks: in that case, they are rancorous and implacable. When we mention the people, however, we ought to make a distinction between the natives and the sojourners. The first are, like the burghers of every opulent city, a better kind of vulgar, consisting of merchants and tradesmen, the majority of whom are religionists of the presbyterian leaven, sour and censorious: the others are a medley of all ingre∣dients, composed of those who come hither for education, for pleasure, and to give attendance on the courts of justice. Heretofore the nobility crowded to Edinburgh during the winter, from all parts of the kingdom. The magnificent houses of many noblemen are still remaining in the Canon∣gate; but they are almost quite abandoned by their owners, who now spend their winters in London, solliciting the court for favours, which rob them of their independence. Nevertheless, a great number of the Scottish gentry reside with their families in Edinburgh during the severe season of the year, when they rival their southern neigh∣bours in gaiety of dress, and variety of diversions. Here are assemblies for dancing and card-playing, plays every night, and concerts once a fortnight. On these occasions the ladies make a very splendid appearance, both in dress and in personal beauty: the streets are crowded with their equipages; and Edinburgh still maintains the external marks of a rich metropolis. The inhabitants in a great mea∣sure subsist upon the money expended by these vi∣sitants, and by the commodities of all kinds which
<PB N="124" REF="1280"/>
they collect in their shops and warehouses, and distribute through all parts of the kingdom. Here are likewise merchants and manufacturers, who embark in foreign commerce, and are concerned in the trading ships that sail from Leith to all parts of Europe.</P>
<P>Leith, which may be stiled the warehouse as well as the port of Edinburgh, is a flourishing town, standing on the side of the Frith, at the distance of a long mile from the metropolis, and subject to its jurisdiction, though governed by its own bailiff. It derives its name from a small river called the water of Leith, which divides the town into two parts; but these are connected again by an handsome stone bridge. The houses are very high, and being of ashler work, make an handsome appearance; and all along the quay there are com∣modious warehouses and cellars, in which perish∣able commodities are deposited. The harbour is formed by a long pier or quay of hewn stone, carried out far into the sea, on the east side, and on the west, by strong ranges of piles, breakwaters, or counterpiers, which are kept in repair at a con∣siderable expence. By this contrivance the har∣bour is kept free, open, and accessible, although the shore be flat, and the swell considerable. Above one hundred ships are sometimes seen at once in the harbour of Leith. The town itself is populous; the inhabitants are industrious: here is the custom∣house, where goods for exportation and importa∣tion are entered: but the commissioners keep their office at Edinburgh, where the merchants general∣ly reside. There is a glass-house, a sugar-house, a saw-mill, and divers other works at Leith; and, in a word, the whole place wears the aspect of bu∣siness and success. Hither come the large ferry∣boats with passengers from Kinghorn, on the oppo∣site side of the Frith, which is here seven miles
<PB N="125" REF="1290"/>
over; and hither resort the citizens of Edinburgh on parties of pleasure, chiefly with a view to re∣gale themselves with the sea air and fresh oysters, which are caught near this place in great plenty. At North Leith, that stands on the other side of the harbour, there are docks, in which large ships have been built and repaired; and here we see the ruins of a citadel, built by Oliver Cromwell, when he was master of this country. Between Leith and Kinghorn, about the middle of the Frith, lies the small island Inch Keith, frequented by water fowl. Weshall say nothing further of this sea-port of Edinburgh, but that here are horse-races every year for the king's plate; and on these occasions Edinburgh is crowded with the best company in Scotland. About four miles to the eastward of Leith, and on the same coast, we enter Musselburgh, an antient burgh of regality, and market-town, situated near the mouth of the river Esk, with a tolerable harbour. This place, which is but thinly inhabited, subsists chiefly by a manufacture of coarse woollen stuffs, and by its corn market. A little to the westward, and almost contiguous, is the small town of Fisher-row, inhabited by fishermen, who, together with shell fish in abundance, catch great numbers of cod, haddock, and whiting. There are besides, the villages of Newbiggin and Goodspead, all so close together, that all the four seem to be one continued town; the two last belonging to the parish of In∣veresk, an agreeable village, situated on a rising ground that fronts the Frith, and commands a no∣ble prospect on the opposite coast of Fife. There are many elegant houses at Inveresk, the air of which is esteemed so healthy, that this village is called the Montpelier of Scotland. At one end of Musselburgh stands Pinkey, a noble seat near the sea, belonging to the marquis of Tweedale. This
<PB N="126" REF="1300"/>
palace, which formerly belonged to Seton, earl of Dumfermline, stands upon a rising ground, front∣ing the Frith, of which it commands a noble pros∣pect, and is one of the most magnificent seats in Great Britain; whether we consider the greatness of the edifice, the grandeur of the apartments, the richness of the furniture; the number and excel∣lence of the paintings; the beauty of the gardens, the plantation, and extent of the park, or the de∣lightful situation. Hard by is the field of battle, where the Scots were defeated by the duke of Somerset, regent of England, in the minority of his nephew, the sixth Edward. Two miles further eastward on this coast, is Preston town, and Preston pans, where a great quantity of salt is made by boiling the sea water. This village, inconsiderable in itself, was rendered famous in the year 1745, by the defeat of the king's troops under Sir John Cope, who was here routed by the Highlanders, who declared for the young Pretender. At the distance of five miles east of Edinburgh, the town of Dalkeith is situated at the conflux of the two rivers Esk, a large, populous, and flourishing vil∣lage, that gives the title of earl to the family of Scot, duke of Buccleugh, and is the seat of a small presbytery: but the place is more remarkable for the magnificent palace here built by the late dutchess, on the very scite of the old castle. It stands upon an eminence, on the bank of the river North Esk; is built of freestone, after the model of the palace at Loo, belonging to the prince of Orange, in Guelderland. The front is adorned with columns of the Corinthian order: the grand stair-caise is sup∣ported by pillars of marble. The apartments are spacious and princely, magnificently furnished, and adorned with fine paintings. The offices are suit∣able to the dignity of the palace, which overlooks a large park, well planted with trees, and beauti∣fied
<PB N="127" REF="1310"/>
with a canal and water-works. In a word, the palace of Dalkeith is the largest and noblest mo∣dern house in all Scotland. In this neighbourhood we see the house of Newbottle, a fine old seat, be∣longing to the marquis of Lothian, enriched with a noble collection of pictures and statues, and sur∣rounded by a very agreeable plantation, through which many pleasant walks and vistas are opened. About four miles from Edinburgh is Roslin, noted for a stately Gothic chapel, counted one of the most curious pieces of workmanship in Europe, founded in the year 1440, by William St. Clair, prince of Orkney, and duke of Holdenburg. It was possessed by a provost and seven canons regular, whom the lands of Roslin endowed with considera∣ble revenues. Roslin is likewise famous for a vic∣tory which the Scots, under Cummin and Fraser, obtained in this place, about the year 1303, over Seagrave, the English general. The Scottish his∣torians affirm, that the English army being divided into three bodies of ten thousand each, the Scots, not exceeding eight thousand, defeated each sepa∣rate division in three successive encounters: but the English writers represent this affair as an inconsi∣derable check, occasioned by an ambuscade, in which the van guard of their army fell and was defeated. Mid-Lothian, is adorned with a great number of elegant houses, belonging to the gentry, which we cannot pretend to particularize; among others, the houses of the earls of Morton and Lau∣derdale, about six miles to the westward of Edin∣burgh, two elegant edifices, surrounded with parks agreeably planted with a variety of trees; and at a little distance the house of New Linton, a de∣lightful seat, where the late earl of Stair resided during his honourable recess from courts and cor∣ruption: nor is it deficient in Roman antiquities. At Cramond, upon the Frith, four miles to the
<PB N="128" REF="1320"/>
westward of Edinburgh, we see the remains of a great Roman station, in the estate of Sir John Inglish. Here several Roman altars have been found, and stones having inscriptions dug up, to∣gether with a great quantity of Roman coins, brass, silver, and gold. Great part of these, and many other curious pieces of antiquity, were col∣lected by the late Sir John Clark, of Penny-cuik, one of the barons of the exchequer, a gentleman of considerable fortune, eminent for his taste and learning, whose country house at Mavis Bank, in this county, is one of the most agreeable villas in all Scotland.</P>

<HEAD>The Shire of HADDINGTON, or EAST-LOTHIAN.</HEAD>
<P>The shire or constabulary of Haddington, washed on the north and east by the Frith of Forth; hem∣med in on the south by the hills of Lammermuir; and on the west adjoining to the shire of Edinburgh; stretches about twenty miles in length, and twelve in breadth; and is one of the most fruitful coun∣ties in Scotland; producing great quantities of ex∣cellent wheat and all sorts of grain, well watered with streams, plentifully supplied with fish, fowl, fuel, and all the necessaries of life; abounding with towns, villages, and farms, and interspersed with a great number of agreeable houses belonging to per∣sons of rank and fortune. With respect to cul∣tivation, populousness, and fertility, this shire may vie with any tract of land in the island of Great-Britain. Over and above the farming, which turns out to great account, the people towards the sea∣coast employ themselves in the fishery, salt making, and in foreign trade; and some of the more inland inhabitants engage in the linen and woollen manu∣factures. Limestone and coal are found in most parts of the country; and great numbers of sheep
<PB N="129" REF="1330"/>
are fed on the hills of Lammermuir. The county town, Hadenn or Haddington, which gives the title of earl to a branch of the Hamilton family, is a royal burrough, situated on the small river Tine, over which there is a handsome bridge of three arches. The town is large and well built, has a good corn market, and is the seat of a large presbytery. Here are the remains of an old nun∣nery, founded by Henry, son to St. David, king of Scotland. At present the town of Haddington bears marks of decay. Many houses are ruinous, and there is little appearance of business in the place, though a company of adventurers have here established a large manufacture of broad cloth, little inferior to the best of England. In this neighbourhood there are many fine seats, among which is Yester House, belonging to the marquis of Tweedale; and not far distant is Tinningham, the agreeable seat of the earl of Haddington.</P>
<P>There are many other fine seats in this county, such as Seton House, formerly belonging to the earl of Wintoun, who was forfeited in the rebel∣lion of 1715, a noble palace now in ruins; the houses of lord Elibank, lord Bellhaven, lord Stor∣mount, Fletcher of Saltoun, Nisbet of Dirleton, Cockburn of Ormstoun, and many more, which the nature of our plan will not allow us to describe.</P>
<P>At the distance of four miles, upon the sea coast, is situated North Berwick, a small royal burrough, which by means of its harbour, enjoys some share of commerce. At a small distance from the shore, rises the island or rock called the Bass, about a mile in circumference, steep and in∣accessible on all sides except to the south-west, and even there, it is with great difficulty that a single man can climb up with the help of a rope or lad∣der. It is supplied with water by a spring at the top, and, belonging to the crown, was formerly
<PB N="130" REF="1340"/>
kept as a garrison. A party of king James's ad∣herents surprized it at the Revolution, and it was the last place in the three kingdoms that surrendered to the new government, which ordered the forti∣fications to be slighted. In the summer season this remarkable rock, which rises to a great height above the surface of the water, in form of a cone, is quite covered with sea fowl, which come hither to breed. The chief of those are the solan geese, which arrive in June, and retire in September. The people in this neighbourhood catch the young in great numbers: they sell the meat for dainties, and turn the feathers to good account. The Bass contains a small warren for rabbits, and affords pasture for a few sheep. It is upon the whole a great curiosity; and the force of the tides has worn a hole almost quite through the rock. Hard by North Berwick, is the seat of Sir Hugh Dal∣rymple.</P>
<P>Dunbar is an antient royal burrough, situated near the mouth of the Frith, the seat of a presby∣tery, famous for the defeat of the Scottish army by Oliver Cromwell, as well as for its antient castle, which sustained many a siege from the English, and was at last demolished in the minority of king James VI. Dunbar is a neat little town, with a good market, and a secure harbour, which the in∣habitants have built with great labour and expence. A great quantity of herrings is caught annually at this place, though they are not so good as those caught on the western coast of Scotland. Here are some eminent merchants, who fit out ships, and carry on a considerable share of commerce, which when properly extended, will render this place a flourishing sea-port.</P>

<HEAD>BERWICKSHIRE, or the MERS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, deriving its name from the town of Berwick, which was the head of the shire before it fell into the hands of the English, and obtained the appellation of Mers or March, because it was one of the borders towards England, is washed on the south and east by the river Tweed and the German Ocean, bounded on the west by Tweedale, and on the north by Lothian. It extends four and twenty miles from east to west, and the breadth amounts to sixteen. The face of the country is rough and irregular, exhibiting hills, moors, and mosses, with intermediate vallies, which are plea∣sant and fruitful. It is watered by many streams, and particularly by the famous Tweed, which ri∣sing from the same hills that give birth to the Clyde and Annan, runs with a rapid course through Tweedale Forest, and Teviotdale, and after a course of fifty miles, disembogues itself into the German ocean. Notwithstanding the length of its course, it is not navigable above Berwick, where there is a noble bridge over it, consisting of fifteen arches: there was another at Melross, where nothing but the piers now remain. A third, of five arches, is maintained at Peebles; and a fourth has lately been built at Kelso. The shire of Berwick is ge∣nerally distinguished into the three divisions of Mers, Lammermuir, and Lauderdale. The Mers is low, pleasant, and tolerably fruitful in corn. Lammermuir is a hilly country, abounding with game, and yielding good pasture for sheep and black cattle. Lauderdale is a tract of land lying on each side of the river Lauder, agreeably varied with hill, dale, and forest, producing good store of corn and pasturage, and giving the title of earl to the family of Maitland: but the most fruitful and populous parts of Berwickshire, are those that
<PB N="132" REF="1360"/>
lie along the Tweed, and on both sides of the lesser rivers White Water, Black Water, and Eye. The seats of noblemen and gentlemen abound in this county. The regality of Thulstan belonged to the earl of Lauderdale: the forest of Dye is in possession of the duke of Douglas: the earl of Home resides at the Herfell, near Coldstream: the earl of Marchmont has a fine seat near Duns: and this county of Mers, or March, gives the title of earl to a branch of the noble family of Douglas, immediately descended from the house of Queens∣berry. Berwick was the chief town of this county, until it fell into the hands of the English, and was annexed to their monarchy in the reign of king Edward IV. At present the principal town is Duns, a pretty large populous burgh of barony, standing on a rising ground in the center of the shire, the seat of a presbytery, and formerly of the courts of justice, removed hither when the English reduced Berwick. It has a fair castle, an excellent market for corn and cattle, and is famous as the birth∣place of the famous Duns Scotus.</P>
<P>Aymouth, Eymouth, or Haymouth, is a good fishing town, the only sea-port of the shire, at the mouth of the river Eye, from whence it derives the name: it has a weekly market, and some trade, and is remarkable for having given the first title of nobility to the great John, duke of Marlborough, who was by Charles II. created baron of Eymouth, when he attended the duke of York in Scotland.</P>
<P>Coldstream is a small market-town, situated on the Tweed, in the neighbourhood of a monastery, which has been long demolished. It was here that general Monk raised the two battalions, which are now known by the name of the Coldstream regiment of foot guards. Greenlaw, at the distance of four miles from Duns, is a burgh of regality, be∣longing to the earl of Marchmont, who resides in this
<PB N="133" REF="1370"/>
part of the country. Eyton, or Acton, is a pleasant village belonging to the earl of Home, built upon the river Eye, over which there is a bridge of stone. Coldingham, standing near the coast, is now an inconsiderable place, though famous for an antient abbey, built in the beginning of the twelfth cen∣tury, by Edgar, king of Scotland. This abbey was renowned in consequence of the chastity of its nuns, who, at the Danish invasion, by the advice and example of their abbess, defaced themselves by cutting off their lips and noses, that their beauty might not subject them to brutal violation. The good lady, whose name was Ebba, has been cano∣nized for this act of virtuous self-denial; and a neighbouring promontory is called St. Ebb's head, in memorial of this transaction. Churside is a paultry town, four miles from Eyton, the seat of a presbytery. Ersilton, situated on the river Lauder, is likewise the seat of a small presbytery, famous for the birth of Thomas Lermont, commonly called Thomas the Rhymer, whose prophecies are as much in request among the Scots, as those of Merlin or Nixon are in esteem with the commonalty in Eng∣land. He was born in the thirteenth century, and is said to have prognosticated the union of the two kingdoms. Lauder is an antient royal burrough, situated on the river from whence it takes the name, the capital of Lauderdale, and seat of the commissaries. On the bridge of Lauder, some of the Scottish nobles, headed by the earl of Angus, seized two or three minions of king James III. who were very unpopular, and hanged them without ce∣remony. The earl of Lauderdale has an agreable seat on the banks of this river. At the town of Preston there is a large house belonging to the duke of Douglas. The village of Gordon in this county gave the title of baron and surname to the head of that numerous and powerful clan distin∣guished
<PB N="134" REF="1380"/>
by this appellation. About fourteen miles to the westward of Berwick, stands Cockburn's path, or Copper's path, a small fishing town on the coast, lying between two strong passes, which by a few resolute men might be defended against a large army.</P>

<HEAD>AIRESHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Aire is bounded on the north by Renfrew; on the south by Galloway; on the east and west by Clydsdale and the Frith of Clyde. It extends sixty-four miles in length from north to south; thirty-six miles in breadth, and is divided into the three great bailliages of Kyle, Carrick, and Cunningham. The country is generally level, pleasant, and fertile, well watered with streams and rivers, plentifully supplied with fish; yielding abundance of freestone, limestone, coal, and peat for fuel; producing large harvests of corn, a great number of sheep, horses, and black cattle; shaded and adorned with woods and plantations, belong∣ing to the seats of noblemen and gentlemen, of which there is a great number in this county. The people are rigid presbyterians, numerous, industri∣ous, and wealthy, exercising themselves in the va∣rious employments of farming, fishing, wool∣combing, and the linen manufacture.</P>
<P>Carrick, or Carrict, the southern division, bor∣dering on Galloway, stretches thirty-two miles in length, is a hilly country, fit for pasture, of which the earls of Cassils were hereditary bailiffs. The chief rivers of this tract are the Stencher and Gir∣ven, both abounding with salmon: here are also divers lakes and forests; and the people on the coast are employed in the herring fishery, though they have no harbour of any consequence. The only towns of this district, are Bargeny and May∣bole, two inconsiderable villages; yet the first gives
<PB N="135" REF="1390"/>
the title of baron to a branch of the Hamilton fa∣mily. The division of Kyle, properly called the shire of Aire, is separated from Carrick by the river Dun, over which there is a bridge of one arch, wider than that of the Rialto of Venice, and from Cunningham by the river Irwin. It is a rich and populous country, extending thirty-four miles from east to west, and twenty-six from north to south, divided into two stewartries by the river Aire, which, after a winding course from east to west, falls into the sea below the town that borrows its name. The Scottish writers derive the name of Koyle from a British king called Koilus, supposed to have been defeated and slain in this country by Fergus, king of Scotland. This tradition seems to be in some sort confirmed by divers circumstances. The spot on which the battle is said to have been fought, re∣tains the name of Coil-field: a neighbouring church is distinguished by the name of Coil-toun∣kirk: an adjacent river is called Coil-water; and a lake near which the Scots incamped, is denomi∣nated Loch-fergus. In Coil-field, the natives dug up a kind of trumpet resembling the lituus or clarion of the Romans. The county town is Aire, an antient royal burrough commodiously situated for trade, at the mouth of the river, which abounds with salmon. The place is composed of the old and new towns joined together by a bridge of four arches; is large, open, and pretty well inhabited; has a good harbour, and some share of commerce; but exhibits evident symptoms of decay: it is never∣theless counted the chief market town in this part of Scotland; is the seat of a presbytery, adorned with a stately church, and other handsome public edifices. At a little distance from the town there is a lazar-house near the shore, founded for the maintenance of lepers, by king Robert de Brus, who was himself afflicted with this distemper. Aire
<PB N="136" REF="1400"/>
is remarkable for the cruel massacre of many no∣blemen and gentlemen in Scotland, whom the English governor for Edward I. had assembled on pretence of holding a court of justice. They were seized one by one as they entered the place called the king's barn, and hanged without trial or delay. This barbarous execution being finished, the English officers gave a loose to mirth and intemperance: but in the night they were surprized by a party of Scots under the celebrated William Wallace, a na∣tive of this country, who having surrounded the barns, set fire to them, and all the English were burned to ashes. In this division stands Ochiltree castle, a seat of the Stuarts, descended from the blood-royal: the house of Stair, giving the title of earl to the family of Dalrymple: the messuage Dundonald, giving an earl's title to the family of Cochran; and the seat of the earl of Crawfurd, viscount of Garnock; and the house of the earl of Glasgow. The third division, Cunningham, a Danish word, signifying the king's residence, giving a surname to the antient and noble family of Glen∣cairn, is an agreeable level country, bordering on the south with Kyle; washed on the north and west by the Fryth of Clyde, and bounded on the east by Renfrew and part of Clydsdale. It extends near thirty miles from north-west to south-east, but not above twelve in breadth; and is parted from Kyle by the water of Irwine. The chief town is a bur∣rough of this name, standing at the mouth of the river, pretty large and populous, having an in∣different harbour for small vessels, by means of which the inhabitants drive a considerable coal trade with Dublin. There is an handsome stone bridge over the river; and here we see the remains of a citadel built by Oliver Cromwell. Irwine gives the title of viscount to the English family of In∣gram. In the neighbourhood of this town stands
<PB N="137" REF="1410"/>
Eglinton, the seat of the antient and noble family of Montgomery, which hence derives the title of earl. Of this family was Gabriel de Lorges, count de Montgomery, captain of the Scotch gardes du corps in France, who killed king Henry II. of that kingdom, in a tournament, with a splinter of his spear, which entered his majesty's eye, and penetra∣ted into the brain. Poununy castle, in this shire, was built with the ransom-money payed by Henry Piercy, surnamed Hotspur, whom Sir James Mont∣gomery took with his own hands in the battle of Otterburn. At Larges, on the sea coast, in the shire of Air, Alexander III. king of Scotland, obtained a complete victory over Acho, king of Norway, who invaded this part of the country, with an army of twenty thousand men. In this battle an Irish gentleman distinguished himself by such extraordinary acts of valour, that king Alex∣ander bestowed upon him the lands of Kentail, where he settled; and from him is descended the numerous and valiant clan of the Mackenzies. On the north-east border of the shire, about seven miles from Irwine, stands the populous and flou∣rishing town of Kilmarnock, famous for its manu∣facture of broad cloth and hardware, which gave the title of earl to the noble family of Boyd re∣siding in this neighbourhood: this title was for∣feited by the late earl, who, by engaging in the re∣bellion of 1745, was deprived of his honours, and lost his life on the scaffold. His son, however, who served in the king's army, has since that period succeeded to the earldom of Errol, a title much more antient and honourable. Near the source of the river Irwine, at the distance of nine miles from Kilmarnock, stands the house of Lon∣don, an elegant seat belonging to the earl of that name, descended from the family of Argyle, whose surname he retains.</P>

<PB N="138" REF="1420"/>
<HEAD>The Shire of PEEBLES, or TWEEDALE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Peebles, called Tweedale, from the river Tweed, that runs through the whole length of the county, stretches about five and twenty miles in length, and at some places eighteen in breadth; bounded on the east by Ettrick Forest; on the south by Annandale; on the west by Clydesdale; and on the north by Mid Lothian. Tweedale is a hilly country, well watered with the Tweed, the Yarrow, and a great number of smaller streams that fertilize the valleys, which produce good harvests of oats and barley, with some pro∣portion of wheat. All the rivers of any conse∣quence abound with trout and salmon. The lake called West-Water-Loch, swarms with a prodigious number of eels. In the month of August, when the west wind blows, they tumble into the river Yarrow in such shoals, that the people who wade in to catch them run the risque of being over∣turned. There is another lake on the borders of Annandale, called Lochgennen, which forms a ca∣taract over a precipice two hundred and fifty paces high: here the water falls with such a momentum as to kill the fish underneath. About the middle of this county is the hill or mountain of Braidalb, from the top of which the sea may be seen on each side of the island. Tweedale abounds with lime∣stone and freestone. The hills are generally as green as the downs in Sussex, and feed innume∣rable flocks of sheep, that yield great quantities of excellent wool. The country is well shaded with woods and plantations, abounds with all the ne∣cessaries of life, and is adorned with many fine seats and populous villages. The earls of March were hereditary sheriffs of Tweedale, which be∣stows the title of marquis on a branch of the an∣tient
<PB N="139" REF="1430"/>
house of Hay, earls of Errol and hereditary high constables of Scotland. The family of Tweedale is, by the female side, descended from the famous Simon de Fraser, proprietor of great part of this country, who had a great share in ob∣taining the triple victory at Roslin. The chief, and indeed the only town of consequence in Tweedale, is Peebles, a small inconsiderable royal burrough and seat of a presbytery, pleasantly si∣tuated on the banks of the Tweed, over which there is at this place a stately stone bridge of five arches. In the neighbourhood of Peebles, near the village of Romana, on the river Lene, we see the vestiges of two Roman castella, or stationary forts, like that we have described at Ardoch; and a great many terraces on the neighbouring hills, which perhaps have served as itinerary encamp∣ments. In the shire of Tweedale there are many antient and honourable families of the gentry. Among these Douglas of Cavers, who was heredi∣tary sheriff of the county, still preserves the stan∣dard and the iron mace of the gallant lord Douglas, who fell in the battle of Otterburn, just as his troops had defeated and taken Henry Piercy, sur∣named Hotspur. In the church-yard of Drumal∣zier, belonging to an antient branch of the Hay family, the famous Merlin is supposed to lie buried. There was an old traditional prophecy that the two kingdoms should be united, when the waters of the Tweed and the Pansel should meet at his grave. Accordingly, the country people observe that this meeting happened in consequence of an inundation, at the accession of James VI. to the crown of Eng∣land.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>ROXBURGHSHIRE, or TEVIOTDALE.</HEAD>
<P>This county, deriving its name from the town of Roxburgh, which is now destroyed, and the river
<PB N="140" REF="1440"/>
Teviot, that runs through the shire into the Tweed, is divided into the three districts of Teviotdale, Liddisdale, and Eskdale, or Eusdale, so called from their respective rivers, Teviot, Liddal, and Esk. It is bounded on the east and south-east by Northumberland and Cumberland; on the south and south-west by Annandale; on the west by Tweedale; on the north by the Merse and Lau∣derdale; extending about thirty miles from east to west, and about fifteen in breadth from the border of England to the blue Cairn in Lauder-moor. The shire exhibits a rough irregular appearance of hills, mosses, and mountains, interspersed however with narrow vallies, and watered with delightful streams. Though the face of the country is bare of woods, the valleys yield plenty of corn, and the hills abound with pasture for sheep and black cattle. The principal mountains of this country are known by the name of Cockraw, from whence a range of very high hills runs westward, dividing Scotland from England. On the confines of this shire, are the debateable lands, the property of which was formerly disputed by the Scotch and English bor∣derers, but adjudged to the Scots at the union of the crowns. Roxburghshire yields plenty of lime and freestone, which, in former times, was freely used by the inhabitants in building castles to defend them from the invasions of their English neigh∣bours. The most distinguished families in this county are the Scots and Kers, who raised them∣selves to wealth and honours by their bravery and success in a sort of predatory war with their ene∣mies of South Britain. The shire is very popu∣lous; the people are stout and valiant: they were formerly inured to military discipline and all the dangers of war, by living on dry marches conti∣guous to those of England; being so numerous and alert, that this, and the neighbouring shire of Ber∣wick, could in twenty-four hours produce ten
<PB N="141" REF="1450"/>
thousand men on horseback, well armed and accou∣tered. In the shire of Roxburgh, we still meet with a great number of old castles and seats be∣longing to private gentlemen, whose ancestors sig∣nalized themselves in this manner; and we find the remains of old encampments, and a Roman military way, vulgarly called the causeway, run∣ning from Haunum to the Tweed. The principal town called Roxburgh, giving the title of duke to the chief of the Kers, was antiently a royal bur∣rough, containing divers parishes, large and flou∣rishing, defended by a strong citadel, which was often alternately reduced by the English and Scotch adventurers. It was in besieging this castle, that king James II. of Scotland, lost his life by the bursting of a cannon. In consequence of the al∣most continual wars between the two nations, this fortress was razed, the town ruined, and its royalty translated to Judburgh, which is now a royal bur∣rough situated near the confluence of the Tefy and Jed. It gives the title of lord to the eldest son of the marquis of Lothian; is the seat of the sheriff's court and presbytery, a large well-built populous town, with an handsome church and town-hall, and a good market for corn and cattle. Kelso, a burgh of barony, and likewise the seat of a presbytery, is a large populous town, pleasantly situated on the bank of the Tweed, and conse∣quently a great thoroughfare to and from England. The houses and streets are large and commodious; a very good market is held weekly in a spacious square: the parish church is what remains of an antient abbey of the Cistercian monks founded by king David I. of Scotland. Here is a house be∣longing to the duke of Roxburgh, lord paramount of the town: he has likewise a noble seat called Fleurs, with the gardens near the influx of the Teviot into the Tweed, about a mile from the ruins of the antient castle of Roxburgh: here are
<PB N="142" REF="1460"/>
besides, other agreeable country houses possessed by the neighbouring gentry, who are rich and nu∣merous. At Kelso there is a new bridge of stone built over the Tweed, which, at this place, does not divide Scotland from England; for the Scots possess some miles of territory, on the south side of the river. Hawich is a small market-town on the Teviot, the royalty of which belongs to the duke of Buccleugh. Melross, or Mailros, a small burgh of barony belonging to the earl of Haddington, is the seat of a presbytery, at the distance of six miles from Kelso, standing on the banks of the Tweed, hard by the famous abbey of that name, founded in the twelfth century, for Bernardine or Cistercian monks, so denominated from the monastery of Cisteaux in Burgundy, of which St. Bernard was a brother. The chronicle of Mailros was kept and continued by the monks of this abbey; and the in∣consistencies with which it abounds are attributed to the ignorance and partiality of the writers, as the abbey happened to be in the hands of the Scots or Saxons: the magnificence of the foundation still appears in the ruins. The window over the great gate of the abbey is larger than that of York∣minster; and round the top are the statues of Christ and the twelve apostles: the choir of the Church, which is still visible, amounts to one hun∣dred and forty feet in length; and by the thickness of the foundations, there must have been a large and strong tower or steeple in the centre of the church: we see likewise several fragments of the house, the court, and offices. This abbey was en∣dowed with great revenues, part of which arose from a large sheep-walk in the neighbourhood, on the finest green downs in the island of Great Bri∣tain.</P>

<HEAD>SELKIRKSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Selkirk, otherwise called the she∣riffdom of Ettrick Forest, extends about twenty miles from east to west, and the breadth does not exceed twelve: it borders on the north with part of Tweedale and Mid-Lothian; on the south and east, with Teviotdale; and on the west, with part of Annandale. It is a hilly country, yielding pasture for innumerable flocks of sheep and black cattle; and the intermediate valleys bear good harvests of hay and corn. It was formerly covered with woods, in which there were great numbers of red and fal∣low deer; and hence derived the appellation of a forest; but now the woods are in a great mea∣sure destroyed. It is well watered by many de∣lightful streams, of which the principal are the rivers Ettrick, Yarrow, and Gallowater. In one of these streams called Glaugeber water, pieces of pure gold have been found in the shape of birds eyes and eggs. Here are many agreeable seats be∣longing to the families of Scot, Ker, Pringle, and Murray. The people, in general, are vigorous, healthy, sober, and industrious. The chief town is Selkirk, a small royal burrough, situated on the bank of the river Ettrick, about thirty miles from Edinburgh. It gives a name to the county, and the title of earl to a branch of the house of Ha∣milton; is the seat of a presbytery; the place where the sheriff holds his court; has a weekly market; some annual fairs; but subsists chiefly by its manufacture of shoes and boots. Philip∣haugh on the other side of the river, and Gallas∣heils on the little river Gella, are too inconsiderable to merit a particular description.</P>

<P>The shire of Dumfries, comprehending Annan∣dale, Wachopdale, and Niddisdale, is a large county, extending fifty miles in length from west to south-east, and four and thiry in breadth; bounded on the west, with Galloway and Kyle; on the east, by Solway Frith, and the marches of Scotland and England; on the north, by part of Clydesdale, Tweedale, and Teviotdale; and on the south, by the Irish sea. The country is rough and mountain∣ous, not so well adapted for corn, as for pasture, on which innumerable flocks of sheep and herds of cattle are bred and fed for exportation to Eng∣land. The face of the country is bare and brown, almost destitute of wood, and very deficient in fuel; yet, the vallies being watered and fertilized with abundance of streams, produce good corn. The shire is adorned with a great many seats and plantations, thriving towns, and populous vil∣lages. The people are healthy, strong, and indus∣trious. Annandale, the first division, so called from the river Annan, by which it is watered, is a stew∣artry in the eastern part of the shire, which gives the title of marquis to the chief of the family of Johnston, a name distinguished for warlike ex∣ploits during the petty wars that almost continually raged between the borders of Scotland and Eng∣land before the union of the crowns. The river Annan in its windings through this district, which exhibits fine romantic scenes of pastoral beauty and fertility, receives the tribute of divers inferior streams, and, after a course of seven and twenty miles, falls into the Frith of Solway. The chief town, Annan, stands near the mouth of the river, an antient royal burrough and sea-port, which once enjoyed a considerable share of commerce; but was ruined by the incursions of the English, in
<PB N="145" REF="1490"/>
the minority of Edward VI. and has continued to decay from that period. Lochmaben is another antient burrough on the south side of the same river, a paultry town, the seat of a presbytery, re∣markable for nothing but its castle, now in ruins; and its lake or loch abounding with fish, and par∣ticularly affording a species peculiar to itself. This castle belonged of old to the family of Bruce. Moffat is a neat little town; about seven and thirty miles from Edinburgh, famous for its medicinal wells impregnated with salt and sulphur; to which a great concourse of company resorts in the sum∣mer season from all parts of the kingdom. The water purges like that of Scarborough, and is found efficacious in cholic and nephritic pains, and in re∣moving all obstructions of the viscera. Revell and Middlebie near the English border, are two incon∣siderable places: at the first, the inhabitants boil a bitterish salt, out of the sea sand; and the other is the seat of a presbytery. Wauchopdale is a valley so called, because watered by the river Wauchop. Niddisdale or Nithisdale, lying to the westward of Annandale, is a large mountainous tract deriving its name from the river Nid, which issues from a lake called Loch-cure, runs by the towns of San∣quhar, Morton, and Drumlanrig, and discharges itself into the Solway Frith. This country was formerly shaded with noble forests, which are now almost destroyed; so that at present nothing can be more naked, wild, and savage: yet the bowels of the earth are said to yield lead, silver, and gold; the mountains are covered with sheep and black cattle; and here are still some considerable woods, such as that of Holy Wood, three miles from Dum∣fries, noted for an handsome church built out of the ruins of an antient abbey; and also for being the birth-place of the famous astrologer hence called <HI>Joannes de Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro Bosco.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="1500"/>
The chief town, Dumfries, which may be stiled the capital of the south-west part of Scotland, is a large flourishing royal burrough, situated at the mouth of the Nid, at the distance of sixty-four miles from Edinburgh. The houses are well built and commodious, the streets are open and spacious; the town is adorned with an old castle in tolerable repair, four gates, a stately church, an exchange for the merchants, a tolbooth, a large market-place with a curious cross, and a noble bridge of free∣stone over the river, consisting of thirteen large arches, with a gate in the middle, as a boundary between the shire of Dumfries, and the stewartry of Galloway. Dumfries gives the title of earl to the chief of the family of Crichton; is the seat of a presbytery and provincial synod; and carries on a very considerable share of commerce with the British plantations, and divers parts of Europe. The tide flows up the river about six miles, so as to bring small vessels up to the quay; but four miles lower, there is depth of water and safe an∣chorage for ships of large burthen. The markets at Dumfries are well supplied with fish, fowl, and butcher's meat, at reasonable rates. The merchants are opulent, civil, and polite; the people, in general, industrious, wealthy, rigidly devoted to the pres∣byterian religion, and staunch friends to the protes∣tant succession, in favour of which they signalized their spirit and zeal, during the rebellion of the year 1715, when they fortified the place at their own expence, resolving to hold out against the earl of Nithsdale and other lords that declared for the Pretender. The adjacent country is beautified with many agreeable seats, one of which, called Bridge End, on the other side of the river, opposite to Dumfries, was a regality belonging to the family of Maxwell, earls of Nithsdale, which the last earl forfeited by rebellion. At the distance of a mile
<PB N="147" REF="1510"/>
and a half from Dumfries, we see the ruins of a magnificent collegiate church called Lincluden, be∣cause it stood near the lake and water of Cluden, well stored with salmon, over which there is a bridge in this neighbourhood. The Cluden abounds with salmon, is remarkable for many high cata∣racts, and disembogues itself into the river Nid, or Nith. At the distance of five miles from Dum∣fries, is Lochyre, a lake ten miles in length, and three in breadth, from whence issues a river of the same name; forming in its course a small island, on which there formerly stood a fortress that was deemed impregnable. Glencairn, from whence the antient family of Cunningham derives the title of earl, is a small market-town within eleven miles of Dumfries. Drumlanrig is another market∣town, at the distance of thirteen miles from Dum∣fries, giving the title of earl to the duke of Queens∣bury, who, at this place, possesses a noble palace built of freestone in form of a square, beautified with eight and twenty turrets, containing princely apartments magnificently furnished, adorned with grand avenues, extensive gardens, terrace-walks, water-works, grottos, an oak plantation six miles in length, and an elegant stone bridge over the ri∣ver Nith, on the banks of which it is situated. This palace has the more surprizing effect, as it stands in one of the wildest parts of Scotland. In this neighbourhood are the two inconsiderable bur∣roughs of Sanquhar and Penpont, the last of which is the seat of a presbytery.</P>
<P>The stewartry of Kidcudbright, beginning at the middle of Dumfries bridge, makes a considera∣ble part of Galloway, of which the earls of Niths∣dale were hereditary stewards. The face of the country exhibits the appearance of one continued heath, producing nothing but pasture for sheep and small black cattle, which are generally sold in
<PB N="148" REF="1520"/>
England: yet these dusky moors are intersected with pleasant valleys, and adorned with a great number of castles belonging to private gentlemen, every house being surrounded with an agreeable plantation. It is watered by the river Dee, which taking its rise from the mountains near Carrick, runs a meandring course through a tract of land about seventy miles in length, and entering the Irish sea, forms the harbour of Kidcudbright, a small inconsiderable burrough, admirably situated for the fishery and other branches of commerce, which are almost totally neglected through the poverty and indolence of the inhabitants. There is no other town of any consequence in this stew∣artry.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>WIGTOWNSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>The shire of Wigtown, comprehending the west part of Galloway, and the regality of Glen∣luce, extends about twenty-four miles from east to west, and as much from north to south, bounded on the north by the stewartry of Kidcudbright, on the west by Carrick; the other parts stretching out into the Irish sea in form of a peninsula, indented on both sides by the two inlets called Lochrian and the bay of Glenluce. Galloway is a hilly country, pretty well watered with lakes, streams, and rivers; provided with divers commodious creeks and harbours on the coast; but bare of wood, and destitute of fuel. It was once an independent principality governed by its own princes; and now gives the title of earl to a branch of the Stewart fa∣mily. The people are tall, brawny, and robust, formerly famous for their military genius, and in all probability descended from the race of the an∣tient Britons: at present, they are sober, simple, and religious, adhering to the most rigid sect of
<PB N="149" REF="1530"/>
puritanism; and, though they are blamed for neg∣lecting the natural advantage of commerce which they possess, they cannot be taxed with want of in∣dustry; for they employ themselves incessantly in fishing upon the coast, as well as in the rivers and inland lakes, which last yield an infinite quantity of eels, and these they salt for exportation: or they are continually engaged in farming; in breeding sheep, whose wool turns out to great advantage; in feeding black cattle, of which above fifty thou∣sand are annually sold in England; and in raising and breaking a small breed of horses peculiar to this country, and distinguished by the name of Gal∣loways, remarkably strong, hardy, gentle, and tractable. The capital of the shire is Wigtoun, which bestows the title of earl upon the chief of the Flemings. It is a royal burrough, where the she∣riff holds his court, and the seat of a presbytery, situated near the mouth of a river, in the bay of the same name, eleven miles in breadth, at the dis∣tance of eighty-eight miles from Edinburgh. It has the advantage of a tolerable harbour, and is well situated for trade; but this is entirely neg∣lected, and the town is very poor, and thinly inha∣bited. At the distance of six miles from Wig∣toun, stands the little town of Whitherne, sup∣posed to be the Candidacasa of Bede, the episcopal see of Galloway, founded by St. Ninian, who was a Briton, here he built a church dedicated to St. Martin, of an uncommon structure. Whitherne is a royal burrough and market-town, formerly famous for a noble priory. Stranraer, standing it the bottom of Lochrian, is a royal burrough and market-town, and the seat of a presby∣tery, with a tolerable harbour for shipping; but withal a miserable place, poor, dirty, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hin of inhabitants. About four miles from Stranraer, we enter castle Kennedy, a small market∣town
<PB N="150" REF="1540"/>
lying between two lakes, each including an agreeable island, on which there are houses and plan∣tations. On the other side of the isthmus, is the bay of Glenluce, one headland of which is called the Mull of Galloway. On a river that falls into this bay, stands the little town of Glenluce, a burgh of regality belonging to the earl of Stair, where we now see the ruins of a great abbey. The land that projects into the sea between the two bays of Lochrian and Glenluce, is called the Kennes of Gal∣loway, counted one of the most barren and rugged parts of Scotland. On this edge of the coast, we find Port-Patrick, a paultry town near the river Lessie, with a good harbour, which is never used but by a few fishing vessels, and the pacquet boats, which sail from hence to Donhaghadee, in Ireland; the channel at this place not exceeding twenty miles. From a neighbouring hill, one can plainly see Ireland to the south-west; the coast of Cumber∣land, and the Isle of Man, to the south-east; and to the north-west the Isle of Ilay, and the Mull of Kintyre.</P>

<HEAD>SITUATION, EXTENT, and BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>ENGLAND including Wales, the most southern, the most extensive, populous, rich, and flourishing part of Great Britain, lies in a triangular form, between the fiftieth and fifty∣fifth degrees of north latitude; extending about four hundred miles in length from south to north; and, at some places, three hundred miles in breadth: it is bounded by Scotland on the north; by the English channel on the south, dividing it from France; by the German sea on the east; and washed on the west by St. George's or the Irish channel. England, or Anglia, deriving its name from the East Angles of Jutland, who joined the Saxons in the conquest of this country, is of itself a powerful kingdom, environed with the sea, which hath indented it with a great number of bays and harbours, adapting it in a peculiar manner for
<PB N="152" REF="1560"/>
commerce and navigation; and several islands ap∣pear projecting from different parts of the coast: such as the islands of Scilly, commonly known by the name of Cassiterides, famous for the tin they produced, and lying off the Land's end, or the extremity of Cornwall; the island of Anglesey, or Mona, divided by a narrow channel from Carnar∣vonshire, in Wales; the isle of Man, lying off the coast of Lancashire; and many lesser isles, of which particular notice will be taken.</P>

<HEAD>FACE of the COUNTRY, MOUNTAINS, FORESTS, LAKES, RIVERS, WATERS.</HEAD>
<P>England, except in a few places, exhibits to the view an inchanting variety of gently swelling hills, level plains, corn fields, meadow grounds, wood and water, intermingled in the most agreeable man∣ner. The champain country is parcelled out into beauteous inclosures, surrounded with quick-set hedges, intermixed with stately oaks and elms. The farm houses, scattered about in great numbers all over the face of the kingdom, appear large, neat, and convenient, in the midst of their offices or out-houses. The uncultivated part of the ground is cloathed with a perpetual verdure; and the lands, in general, display the perfection of agriculture. The seats of noblemen and gentlemen rise like in∣chanted castles on every hand: populous villages, thriving towns, and flourishing cities, abound in every part of the kingdom, which excels all the states of Europe in beauty, opulence, and cultivation.</P>
<P>England, though a champain country, is not altogether free of mountains: the most remarkable of which, are those of the Peak in Derbyshire; the Endle in Lancashire; the Wolds in Yorkshire; the Cheviot-hills on the borders of Scotland; the Chiltern in Bucks; Malvern in Worcestershire;
<PB N="153" REF="1570"/>
Cotswold in Gloucestershire; the Wreken in Shrop∣shire; with those of Penlimmon, and Snowdon, in Wales. There are above threescore forests in Eng∣land; of which the chief are those of Windsor, Ep∣ping, the New Forest, the forests of Dean and of Sherwood: but, indeed, the whole kingdom looks like a forest, so much is it shaded with trees and plantations. There are few lakes in England, con∣sidering its extent: the largest are Soham-mere, Wittlesea-mere, and Ramsey-mere, in the isle of Ely, in Cambridgeshire, the fens of which, being overflowed in a rainy season, form one vast lake forty miles in circumference. There is likewise Winander-mere in Westmoreland; and we find some small lakes, called Derwent-waters, in Lan∣cashire. England is copiously watered with many noble rivers, which not only fertilize the ground, but likewise conduce, in a great measure, to the improvement and prosperity of commerce. The chief are the Thames, the Medway, the Severne, the Trent, the Tyne, the Tees, the Eden, the Lower Avon, the Ribble, and the Mersey. The Thames is composed of the Thame and the Isis, which last is the more considerable of the two. It rises on the confines of Gloucestershire, receives the Churne, and runs north-east to Lechlade, in Wiltshire, where it unites with the Colne, and be∣comes navigable; thence continuing its course north-easterly, it is swelled by the Windrush, en∣ters Oxford, where it receives the Charwel; then turning south to Abingdon, proceeds to Dorchester, where it is joined by the Thame. Thus increased, it takes an eastward direction, passes by Walling∣ford, Reading, Marlow, Windsor, Kingston, and Richmond, in its way to London; which having washed, it divides the county of Kent from Essex, and widening as it approaches the ocean, falls into the sea at the Nore, being navigable for large ships
<PB N="154" REF="1580"/>
from its mouth to London bridge. In the course of a few miles, it is adorned with a great number of stately bridges; among which we number those of London and Westminster, of Kew, Kingston, Hampton-court, Shepperton, Staines, and Maiden∣head, besides the wooden bridge at Putney, built upon the plan of that which Caesar threw over the Rhine. The Medway rises near Tunbridge, passes by Maidstone, runs by Rochester, where it becomes navigable, and discharges itself into the mouth of the Thames, by Sheerness: a river chiefly remark∣able for the dock at Chatham, where ships of the first rate are built and repaired for the use of the English navy. The Severne, which in point of im∣portance, is esteemed the second river of England, derives its origin from Plenlimmon-hill in Wales; becomes navigable at Welch-Pool; runs east to Shrewsbury; then turning south, visits Bridgnorth, Worcester, and Tewkesbury, where it receives the Upper Avon: after having passed Gloucester, it takes a south-west direction; is near its mouth in∣creased by the Wye and Ustre, and discharges itself into the Bristol Channel, near King-road. The Severne runs with a rapid stream, and often over∣flows the adjacent country. The Trent rises in the moor-lands of Staffordshire; runs south-east by Newcastle-under-Line; takes a north-easterly course on the borders of Derbyshire; visits Not∣tingham, watering that county as far as Lincoln∣shire: being joined by the Ouse, and several other rivers near its mouth, it obtains the name of the Humber, and falls into the sea near Hull. The Tyne, taking its rise on the borders of Cumberland, runs easterly through the whole length of Northumberland, and passing through Newcastle, falls into the German sea at Tin∣mouth. The Tees, rising on the confines of West∣moreland, follows also an easterly course, dividing
<PB N="155" REF="1590"/>
Yorkshire from Durham, and discharges itself into the German sea below Stockton. The Eden runs northerly through Westmoreland and Cum∣berland, and passing by Carlisle, runs into the Solway Firth, in the neighbourhood of that city. The Lower Avon runs through Wiltshire to Bath, and dividing Somersetshire from Gloucester∣shire, proceeds to Bristol, and falls into the mouth of the Severne, below that city. The Ribble waters Lancashire, running a westerly course, and passing by Preston, falls into the Irish sea. The Mersey follows a north-easterly course through Cheshire, dividing that county from Lancashire, and passing by Liverpool, falls into the Irish channel. Besides these rivers, we ought to men∣tion the Dee, which rising in Wales, divides Flint∣shire from Cheshire, and discharges itself into the channel below the city of Chester.</P>
<P>England, in most parts, is well supplied with water by subterraneous springs and fountains, though very few are free of some mineral impregnation; and in many places there are medicinal wells of great efficacy in various disorders incident to the human frame. The most celebrated of these foun∣tains are the hot baths of Bath and Bristol, in So∣mersetshire, and of Buxton in Derbyshire; the mi∣neral waters of Tunbridge, Epsom, Dulwich, Acton, Harrigate, and Scarborough.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The atmosphere in England is generally loaded with vapours, occasioned partly by the neighbour∣hood of the vast Atlantic ocean, supplying it with continual exhalations wafted thither by westerly winds, which blow the greatest part of the year, and partly by the perspiration of trees and plants, with which the face of the country is covered. The
<PB N="156" REF="1600"/>
warmth of the summer season brooding over this moisture, would produce dangerous putrid fevers, were not the air almost incessantly ventilated by sudden gusts of wind or storms, that blow all round the coast. The climate is more unpleasant than unhealthy: the winters are cold, raw, and wet; consequently much more disagreeable than the severe season in more northern climes, where the rivers are locked up with ice, and the inhabitants enjoy a long course of serene and salutary weather. Not but that England is visited with frost and snow in the winter; but these are generally of short con∣tinuance: indeed the weather is so variable, that it is become proverbial, and in a great degree, no doubt, affects the health, spirits, and dispositions of the people, who are remarkably fickle and ca∣pricious. The spring begins in April, or rather in February; and in May, the whole country is co∣vered with blossoms: nevertheless, the winter wea∣ther continues to prevail with great severity, and while a man's eyes are feasted with all the pomp of vernal bloom, his nerves are chilled by the coldness of the atmosphere. It is in this season that the easterly wind begins to blow with the most disagree∣able effect upon vegetables, as well as upon the human body, blasting the promise of the year, and afflicting the valetudinarian with melancholy, rheums, and aches. The summer, as we have already observed, is generally hot and moist; the autumn serene, moderate, and agreeable. But the only criterion of English weather, is its mutability. The winter is sometimes warm, and the summer cold; the spring dry, and the autumn wet; nay, all the gradations of heat and cold are often felt in the compass of one day. These sudden transitions must disorder and obstruct the perspiration. The matter, which ought to have been thrown off by this out-let, being detained in the circulation, will
<PB N="157" REF="1610"/>
excite feverish frays in the animal oeconomy, will be thrown upon the lungs, the arms, the joints, or the membranes of the brain, producing catarrhs, gravel, gout, rheumatism, scurvy, dejection, and madness.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, MINERAL, VEGETABLE, and ANIMAL.</HEAD>
<P>The soil of England is generally a rich clay, though in many places it consists of gravel and sand; and there is a variety of moulds and marles in dif∣ferent parts of the country. Among the mine∣rals of England the most considerable is the tin of Cornwall, which is found in immense quantities, and has been famous since the Phoenicians traded to Great Britain. Wales, and divers other parts of the kingdom, yield abundance of lead, copper, and iron. The lead is impregnated with silver; and some gold has been found in Cornwall. Quar∣ries of excellent freestone are worked in Derbyshire, Dorsetshire, and Devonshire; and there is a kind of marble found in the neighbourhood of Ply∣mouth. Immense quantities of coal are dug out of the pits of Northumberland, Cumberland, West∣moreland, and the bishoprick of Durham: in Northumberland and Cheshire there is plenty of allum and saltpits; and the kingdom abounds with fullers earth, which is of great use in the cloth manufacture. In plenty of corn England excels all the countries of Europe. The arable lands pro∣duce above five and thirty millions of bushels of wheat annually, great part of which is exported. The same quantity of barley is raised in this king∣dom, and made into malt, partly for beer and ale, and partly for the distilling of English spirit and geneva. The poorer ground likewise yields abundance of rye, oats, pease, beans, and vetches; or in the
<PB N="158" REF="1620"/>
common fields the ground is sown alternately with wheat and horse corn, and on the third year lies fallow: but land that is well manured will produce a good crop every year. In many parts of England, the value of the land has, in a small time, been trebled, by inclosing and sowing it with clover, cinquefoil, trefoil, saint-foin, and lucern, for hay and pasture. The kitchen gardens abound with all sorts of greens, roots, and sallads, in perfection; such as artichokes, asparagus, cauli-flowers, cab∣bage, coleworts, brockery, pease, beans, kidney∣beans, spinage, beets, lettuce, cellary, endive, turnips, carrots, potatoes, mushrooms, leeks, onions, and chalots. There are extensive fields of excel∣lent saffron in Essex and Cambridgeshire; the woad for dying, is raised in Bucks and Bedfordshire. The orchards of England, particularly those of Herefordshire, Devonshire, Worcestershire, and Kent, produce incredible quantities of apples, pears, and cherries; and every garden is stored with a variety of delicate fruits, apricots, nectarines, peaches, and grapes, though it must be owned these do not arrive at perfection in wet seasons, nor do they ever acquire that exquisite flavour by which they are distinguished in more southern climates. Among the fruits of England, we may likewise enumerate excellent plumbs of various genera, rasberries, strawberries, gooseberries, and corinths. By dint of hot-beds and fire-walls, the gardeners of this country, who are the most expert in the whole world, can raise any exotic plant, and pro∣duce the most delicate fruits that grow within the tropicks. There are few gentlemen in England, whose gardens do not, in summer, exhibit the pine apple in maturity. The plants that grow spontaneously in different parts of England, we shall not pretend to particularize. Suffice it to say, where there is such a variety of hill and dale, sun
<PB N="159" REF="1630"/>
and shade, soil and weather, with a climate re∣markably favourable to vegetation, there must be a great collection and diversity of such herbs, shrubs, and trees, as are found naturally growing in the same degree of latitude on the continent of Europe. Among the vegetable productions, how∣ever, we must not forget great quantities of flax and hemp, that are raised in some parts of Eng∣land; and the considerable plantations of hops that adorn Kent, Essex, Surry, and Hampshire. The chief forest trees in this kingdom are oak, ash, elm, and beech: but it produces besides great plenty of walnut tree, poplar, maple, sycamore, horn-beam, hazle, willow, sallow, elder, birch, and many other species of wood, which are not counted timber. As for English oak, it is famous for yielding the best plank for shipping, both in con∣sistence, pliability, and duration.</P>
<P>The animals of England may be classed into quadrupeds, birds, fishes, reptiles, and insects. The four-footed animals which this kingdom af∣fords in common with other countries, are dogs, foxes, squirrels, ferrets, weazles, lizzards, newts, otters, badgers, hedgehogs, polecats, rats, mice, moles, black cattle, sheep, horses, asses, and a few mules. The English oxen are large and fat, and the beef has a delicious flavour; yet in this parti∣cular, the small breed of Wales and Scotland are preferred by epicures. The English sheep are ge∣nerally large, and not so valuable for their flesh, as for their fleeces, which constitute the original staple commodity of England. Above twelve mil∣lions of fleeces are annually shorn and manufactured in this kingdom: there is a smaller breed of sheep fed upon the downs, for mutton; and this is most prized in all the markets, as being more firm, sweet, and juicy, than that which is fattened in the rank pastures of Essex and Lancashire.
<PB N="160" REF="1640"/>
England breeds beautiful horses for the saddle and the chace, finely proportioned, full of mettle; yet gentle, tractable, docile, and so fleet, that they will run above twenty miles in an hour. There is likewise a stronger breed of draught horses, admi∣rably adapted for coach, carriage, waggon, or war. On these the cavalry are mounted, and they prove the best charging horses in the world, for strength, weight, and spirit. Among the animals peculiar to England, we ought to mention the mastifs and bull-dogs, which, in point of strength and courage, exceed all animals of that species to be found in any other part of the world. There is no creature so huge and formidable that these dogs will not attack singly, whether bulls, bears, lions, or tigers, and, generally speaking, they are victorious: but this surprising spirit degenerates, when these dogs are transported to any other country. This is likewise the case with the game cocks of England, remark∣able for their ferocity and courage. Besides all sorts of poultry in perfection, turkies, peacocks, geese, swans, ducks, and tame pigeons, England affords plenty of wild fowl, such as bustards, wild geese, wild ducks, teal, wigeon, plover, pheasants, partridge, wood-cocks in the season, growse, quail, landraile, snipe, wood-pigeons, hawks of different kinds, kites, owls, herons, crows, rooks, ravens, magpies, jack-daws, and jays, blackbirds, thrushes, nightingales, goldfinches, linnets, larks, and a great variety of small birds, common to other countries.</P>
<P>The rivers and ponds of England abound with salmon, trout, eels, pike, perch, smelts, carp, tench, barbles, gudgeons, roach, dace, mullet, bream, plaice, flounders, and craw-fish, besides a delicate lake fish called char, which is found in some fresh water lakes of Wales and Cumberland. The sea that surrounds this kingdom, teems with cod,

mackarel, hadock, whiting, herrings, pilchards, skaite, soles, and many other fish of divers denomi∣nations; over and above plenty of shell-fish, such as oysters, lobsters, crabs, and shrimps. The coast of England is seldom visited by whales; but there are great numbers of porpusses tumbling about in the channel, and many seals upon the rocks, at the extremity of the island. The reptiles of this coun∣try, are adders, vipers, snakes, and worms: the insects such as are found in other parts of Europe, humble bees, wasps, ants, gnats, and flies in great variety.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION, GOVERNMENT, LAWS.</HEAD>
<P>The English constitution is a limited monarchy, and, with all its defects, may be considered as the best that ever was reduced to practice in any part of the world, whether we consider the dignity of the crown, or the happiness of the community. The legislative power is vested in the king, lords, and commons assembled in parliament, and no law can be made without the concurrence of all three. The house of lords is composed of all the peers of the realm, spiritual and temporal: the commons, including the Scotch members, amount in number to five hundred and fifty-eight. They are chosen every new parliament by the counties and boroughs, and, in their collective body, are supposed to repre∣sent the people of England. A new parliament is chosen once in seven years, in consequence of writs issued by the crown: the king likewise has power to prorogue and dissolve this assembly at his plea∣sure; as well as to refuse assent to any bill, without giving any reason for the refusal. He enjoys a re∣venue called the civil list, amounting to eight hun∣dred thousand pounds a year, for the maintenance of his houshold, the payment of foreign ministers,
<PB N="162" REF="1680"/>
and any other purposes in which he may think pro∣per to employ it: he is vested with the power of creating peers, appointing all the great officers of state, judges, and commissioners, and of bestowing all the lucrative employments of the common∣wealth, civil as well as military. He contracts al∣liances, declares war, levies troops, augments the navy, builds fortifications, concludes peace; and, in a word, conducts the whole administration of the government by his own power and authority; though the two houses of parliament insist upon the privilege of enquiring occasionally into every branch of the administration. The peers, though originally created by the crown, enjoy their honours by here∣ditary descent; and when guilty of treason, or any other capital crime, they are tried by the whole house of peers, being subject to no other jurisdic∣tion. The house of peers can apprehend, and com∣mit any man, except a member of the lower house, for breach of privilege, or reflections against their judicature: the commitment is very chargeable to the person so offending; but at the rising of the par∣liament, he is released of course. The house of lords is the last resort in all civil causes of appeal from inferior courts of judicature. They can try a member of the lower house, on an impeachment by the commons; but no prosecution can be com∣menced against a commoner, in the house of lords. They can bring into the upper house any bill for making a new law, except it relates to the revenues or public taxes. These, called Money Bills, cannot be first introduced into the house of peers; nor can the lords alter them when they are sent up by the commons, though they may reject them entirely. No peer is subject to personal arrest in actions of debt, and every lord in his private capacity may bring an action of <HI>scandalum magnatum</HI> in the court
<PB N="163" REF="1690"/>
of King's Bench, against any person that shall de∣fame his character.</P>
<P>The house of commons consists of five hundred and fifty-eight members: of these, eighty knights represent the forty counties of England; twelve stand for the counties of Wales, and thirty for the shires of Scotland. The citizens of England are represented by fifty citizens; the boroughs, by three hundred and thirty-nine burgesses; the two universi∣ties, by four members; and the eight cinque ports, by sixteen barons. Wales returns twelve burgesses, and Scotland fifteen. The commons of England rate all the supplies of the year according to the exi∣gencies of government; and this is a province on which they will not allow the house of peers to en∣croach. They amend differences in the law, and defects in government, by new statutes: they im∣pose taxes, grant subsidies, and limit the number of land forces, ships, and seamen, for the service of the year: they take the necessary steps for the improvement and regulation of commerce, the en∣couragement of manufacture, and the benefit of the community. They commit delinquents who have given offence to the house, whether they are, or are not members; but these are released of course at the end of the session. They sometimes assume the power of enquiring into the conduct of ministers and persons who have acted in a public capacity. They call for papers and records, bring in bills of attainder, and impeach even peers at the bar of the upper house. They enjoy many other powers and privileges, which we cannot pretend to enumerate. They speak freely and boldly on all subjects, without any other controul, than that of their speaker, whom they elect into the chair at the beginning of every parliament, and present to the king for his approbation. For this honourable of∣fice, they always chuse a gentleman of character,
<PB N="164" REF="1700"/>
well acquainted with the forms and business of the house, who can direct them in their proceedings and, in the course of their debates, restrict them by his authority within the bounds of decorum. He appears in black robes, sits in an elevated chair a the upper end of the house with his hat on, and the mace before him; walks at the head of the com∣mons from their house or chamber to the house of peers, in order to attend his majesty, when he goes thither to pass the bills; and harangues the sove reign in the name of the commons of England In a word, the house of commons takes cognizance of every thing in which the oeconomy and interest of the public are concerned; and perhaps would be more than a match for the other two branches of the legislature, were not the king possessed of such advantages, as, if properly managed, will always weaken and overcome the opposition of the com∣mons. The liberty and privileges of an English subject, are founded on the Magna Charta, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great charter, extorted by the barons from king John, and afterwards confirmed by his son and successor Henry III. and some additional indulgen∣cies have been obtained of weak princes, by the spirit of the commons. One of the most valuable rights of an English subject, is that of his being tried by a jury of his peers or equals, who sit in court during the trial, and bring in their verdict <HI>guilty</HI> or <HI>not guilty,</HI> according to the nature of the evidence, without acquiescing in the opinion of the judge, when it happens to be contradictory to their own. Another privilege of equal importance, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that of the writ <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> by means of which every person that is imprisoned, can demand the cause of his commitment, immediate trial, or in∣stant release. The people of England cannot b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taxed in any shape, or under any denomination without their own consent, that is, without the
<PB N="165" REF="1710"/>
concurrence of the majority of their representatives in parliament. No soldiers can be quartered in any private house, without the owner's consent; and every individual can dispose of his own effects ac∣cording his own pleasure, either by will, deed, or conveyance. The constitution of England, though said to be as perfect as human wisdom could suggest, and human frailty permit, yet, nevertheless, contains in itself the seeds of its own dissolution. While individuals are corruptible, and the means of cor∣ruption so copiously abound, it will always be in the power of an artful and ambitious prince to sap the foundations of English liberty. By means of the places and pensions in his gift, he will be able to procure a majority in parliament, devoted to his will. He has it in his power to model the army to his wishes. The parliament can protract its own date, consequently perpetuate itself. The com∣mons can gradually increase the number of land forces, until the nation is saddled with a standing army devoted to the crown, sufficient to trample upon the constitution, and disposed to obey the most arbitrary commands of their sovereign. Then will the parliament become the slaves of the army they have reared. This was actually the case in the usurpation of Cromwell; and had his successor inherited his talents and ambition, in all probability the tyranny would have been established on a solid foundation, notwithstanding the disadvantages he laboured under, as a private man and an upstart, who raised himself over the heads of many compe∣titors, superior to himself in pretension and influence: disadvantages which could never attend the arbi∣trary designs of a sovereign, raised by birth above all competition, and already possessed of royal au∣thority. Thus one branch of the legislature will always be able to influence the other two; and the crown being vested with the executive power, the
<PB N="166" REF="1720"/>
command of the forces by sea and land, the prero∣gative of making treaties and alliances, of creating peers and bishops, to secure a majority in the upper house, and being reinforced by a venal house of commons, may easily acquire and establish an ab∣solute dominion. Such a scheme, however, must be executed by gradual innovation, stealing, as it were, imperceptibly on the constitution. An open and bold violation would alarm and arouse the spirit of the people, who are equally jealous, and well informed of their own privileges, in vindication of which they might throw themselves into the arms of a patron, whose emissaries are ever active, and who numbers friends in every corner of the king∣dom. The interior government of England is the peculiar province of the parliament, so far as laws and regulations are concerned. The laws themselves constitute an immense body, or col∣lection, begun by Ina, one of the kings of the Saxon heptarchy, since whose reign they have been occasionally altered, amended, enlarged, and mul∣tiplied, in such a manner, that they are become a grievance to the subject, and indeed a reproach to the nation. Every thing is so incumbered with form, involved in doubt, and over-shadowed with obscurity, that a man can take no step relating to his own property or effects, without the advice of lawyers, the number of whom, including attornies, sollicitors, and clerks, is said to exceed thirty thou∣sand within the cities of London and Westminster. At present the English laws are compounded of the civil law, the common law, or Saxon law, the for∣rest law, the statute law, manour law, marshal law, and franchises, or peculiar laws founded upon royal grants and charters, confirmed by acts of parliament.</P>
<P>The judges of England, appointed by the king, are twelve in number, disposed in different courts of
<PB N="167" REF="1730"/>
judicature, and divided into certain circuits, for the administration of justice through all parts of the realm. The tribunals held at Westminster are the courts of King's-Bench, Common-Pleas, Chan∣cery, Exchequer, and the dutchy chamber of Lan∣caster. The highest court of common law in England is the King's-Bench, so called, because of old the king presided here in person. At pre∣sent, his power is vested in the lord chief justice of the King's-Bench, stiled by preheminence the lord chief justice of England, created by a short writ from the sovereign; and he is assisted by three inferior judges, consisted by letters patent. This tribunal takes cognizance of every thing that con∣cerns the loss of life or member of any subject; of treasons, felonies, breaches of the peace, oppression, and misgovernment; and it hath power to revise and rectify errors and mistakes, in the sentences and proceedings of all the judges and justices of England: in a word, to superintend all pleas, ex∣cept those in the Exchequer. The jurisdiction of the court extends over all the kingdom: for the law presumes, that the sovereign is always person∣ally present. The court of Common-Pleas, held by another lord chief justice, and three assessors, created by letters patent, tries all civil causes, real, personal, and mixed, between subject and subject. The court of Chancery was instituted as a court of equity, to mitigate the rigour of the common law: but, in fact, there is a double judicature included in this tribunal; for the court of Chancery proceeds either according to the laws of the land, in the Latin lan∣guage, granting writs of grace, mandatory and remedial; or by English bill, according to equity and conscience. This court issues writs of sum∣mons for parliament, charters, protections, safe∣conducts, and patents for sheriffs; and in Chancery are sealed and inrolled all letters patent, treaties
<PB N="168" REF="1740"/>
with foreign princes; all deeds touching the pur∣chase of lands or estates, extents upon statutes, re∣cognizances for payment of money, and securing contracts, commissions of appeal, and of oyer and terminer. The supreme judge is the lord chancel∣lor, keeper of the great-seal, speaker of the house of lords, moderator of the common law; in a word, the first civil officer in the kingdom. He is pro∣vided with twelve assistants, called masters in Chancery, the chief of whom, distinguished by the name of Master of the Rolls, is an officer of great dignity, who hears causes in the absence of the chancellor, is keeper of the rolls, and has several profitable places in his gift. All the judges of England are distinguished by particular robes, and appear in their several characters with great pomp and dignity. The court of Exchequer, so called, either from a chequered cloth that covered the table, or, which is more probable, from the French word <HI>échiquier,</HI> signifying a chess-board, because ac∣comptants formerly made use of such in their cal∣culations, is an antient court of records, in which all causes touching the revenue and rights of the crown, are heard and determined. The judges of this tribunal are the lord chief baron, and three other barons; and here likewise sits a puisne baron, who administers the oath to all high-sheriffs, under-sheriffs, bailiffs, auditors, receivers, collectors, comp∣trollers, surveyors, and searchers, of all the customs in England. The Exchequer includes two courts, one of law, another of equity. All judicial pro∣ceedings, according to law, are transacted before the barons; but the court of equity is held in the Exchequer chamber, before the treasurer, chan∣cellor, and barons. The inferior officers belong∣ing to the court of Exchequer, are the king's re∣membrancer, the treasurer's remembrancer, clerk of the pipe, comptroller of the pipe, clerk of the
<PB N="169" REF="1750"/>
pleas, foreign opposer, clerk of the estreats, au∣ditors of the imprest, auditors of the revenue, re∣membrancer of the first fruits, auditor of the first fruits, receiver of the revenue of the first fruits, deputy chamberlains, clerk of the parcels, clerks of the nails, the marshal, the chief usher of the Ex∣chequer, four under-ushers, and six messengers. In the Lower Exchequer, where the king's revenue is received and disbursed, the principal officer is the lord treasurer; but this office is now generally put in commission. Next whom is the chancellor of the Exchequer, an officer of great authority, who sits above the barons, has an under-treasurer, and many places in his gift. In the custody of the two chamberlains of the Exchequer are many antient records and treaties, the standards of money, weights, and measures, the black book of the Exchequer, and the famous Doomsday book, compiled by order of William the Conqueror, in which all the lands of England, except the Bishoprick of Durham, and the three northern counties, are described, with an exact account of all the cities, towns, and villages of England, the number of families, men, soldiers, and husband∣men, bondsmen, servants, and cattle; the quan∣tity of money, rent, meadow, pasture, wood, til∣lage, common, marsh, and heath, that every in∣dividual possessed. All differences and disputes concerning taxes or impositions are determined by this register, which is kept under three locks and keys, not to be opened except upon payment of six shillings and eight pence, and not to be tran∣scribed under fourpence for every line. The au∣ditor of the receipts of the Exchequer files the bills of the tellers, by which they charge themselves with all money received, draws all orders to be signed by the lord high treasurer, for issuing money by virtue of privy seals, makes debentures to the
<PB N="170" REF="1760"/>
several persons who enjoy fees, annuities, or pen∣sions, by letters patent from the king, out of the Exchequer, and directs them for payment to the tellers. He knows every day the state of the ac∣count of each teller, and weekly certifies the whole to the lord high treasurer, or lords commissioners. He at Michaelmas and Lady-day delivers to the lord treasurer, and the chancellor of the Exche∣quer, a declaration, containing a methodical ab∣stract of all accounts and payments made in the preceding half-year: he keeps the several registers appointed for paying all persons in course, upon several branches of the king's revenue: he is <HI>scrip∣tor talliorum,</HI> provided with five clerks to manage the whole estate of monies received, disbursed, and remaining. He that pays or lends money to the king receives for his acquittance or acknowledge∣ment, a tally, or piece of stick, inscribed on both sides with the acquittance, expressing the use for which the money is received: this tally being cloven asunder by the deputy chamberlains, one half, called the stock, is delivered to the person that pays the money; and the other part, called the counter-stock, or counter-foil, they keep, and afterwards transmit to the other deputies, to be pre∣served, till demanded, in order to be joined with the stock: this being done, they send it by an offi∣cer of their own to the Pipe, to be applied to the discharge of the accountant. This antient way of striking tallies hath been found, by long experience, the best method that ever was invented for preventing fraud and forgery: for it is morally impossible so to counterfeit a tally, but, that upon rejoining it with the counterfoil, the fraud will ob∣viously appear by examining and comparing the notches, cleaving, length, breadth, natural growth, or shape of the two pieces. The four tellers re∣ceive all money due to the king, and for each sum
<PB N="171" REF="1770"/>
received, throw down a bill through a pipe, into the tally court, where it is received by the auditor's clerk, who there attends to write the words of the bill upon a tally, and delivers it to be entered by the clerk of the Pells: then the tally is cloven by the two deputy chamberlains; and while the senior reads one part, the other is examined by the junior. The clerk of the Pells enters the teller's bill on a parchment skin, whence the office derives its name, as well as all receipts and payments for the king, for what cause, or by whomsoever. He hath four clerks, and is in the nature of a comptroller. The tally cutter attends in the Tally-court, with the de∣puties of the two chamberlains.</P>
<P>The court of the dutchy chamber of Lancaster consists of the chancellor of the dutchy as chief judge, assisted by the attorney of the dutchy, and divers other officers. He takes cognizance of all causes that concern the revenue of that dutchy, which is now annexed to the crown. All these courts of judicature sit in Westminster-hall, and are opened at the four terms of Easter, Trinity. Michaelmas, and Hillary. The pleading lawyers, denominated counsel, are educated at the inns of court, which are seminaries for students in the law; and after a man has been entered as member of any such society, he is called to the bar, where he always appears in a black gown, until he at∣tains to the degree of serjeant at law, and then he is distinguished by a coif and particular kind of robe. The twelve judges not only administer justice in the courts of the metropolis, but likewise hold assizes all over the kingdom, twice a-year, for the same purpose. England is divided into six cir∣cuits, for each two judges are allotted. Wales is comprehended in two circuits, for which the like number of judges is assigned. These sit at the principal town of every county, to hear and deter∣mine
<PB N="172" REF="1780"/>
causes, civil and criminal, by a jury of twelve men <HI>ex vicinitate.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the civil government of England in ge∣neral, it will be necessary to describe the particular government of counties, hundreds, cities, boroughs, and villages. In order to preserve the tranquillity of the country, the king, in every county, appoints by commission, under the great seal, certain justices of the peace, and one of the principal justices is created <HI>custos rotulorum,</HI> so denominated because he is keeper of the rolls or records of the sessions. Such of the justices as are deemed most worthy of the king's confidence, are called justices of the <HI>quorum,</HI> from their being expressly mentioned in the com∣mission, as persons, one of whom, <HI>quorum unum,</HI> must be present when any matter of importance is transacted. The office of the justices of the peace is to examine and commit to prison, all thieves, murderers, vagrants, rioters, and other delinquents, who occasion a breach of the peace, or disturb the quiet of the community. They imprison all such as cannot be bailed by sureties, and produce them in due time to trial. They are likewise impowered to act in a judicial capacity, and to put certain laws and statutes in execution, namely, those relating to the poor, the repairs of the highways, the punish∣ment of vagrants, and disorderly persons. The justices of the several counties meet every three months at certain places, appointed by the <HI>custos ro∣tulorum,</HI> to hold there quarter-sessions. There the grand inquest, or jury of the county, is summoned to appear, that they may upon oath make inquiry of all delinquents; and those that appear to be guilty are by the justices committed to prison, to be tried at the next assizes, before the judges of the circuit.</P>
<P>For the execution of the laws, the king annually nominates a sheriff for every county of England,
<PB N="173" REF="1790"/>
except Westmoreland and Durham. His office is to execute the king's mandates, and all writs di∣rected to him out of the king's courts; to impan∣nel juries; to bring causes and criminals to trial, and see the sentences executed; to attend and guard the itinerant judges; to collect all public customs of the county, all fines, distresses, and amerciaments to be brought into the Exchequer; to return knights for parliament, suppress riots, execute writs, secure prisoners, distrain for debts, superintend the execution of malefactors. The sheriff executes all processes and precepts of the courts of law, and makes the returns of all such. He holds the coun∣ty court, in which he hears and determines civil causes of the county under forty shillings. In a word, he is the chief conservator of the peace in the whole county; and, for the better performance of the different functions, is assisted by an under sheriff, divers clerks, stewards of courts, bailiffs of hun∣dreds, constables, goalers, serjeants or beadles. The sheriff is always a man of fortune, sufficient to sup∣port the dignity of his office, particularly to main∣tain a gallant train of servants in rich liveries, all mounted on horseback, for the reception of the judges. Every county is, moreover, provided with a certain number of high constables, <HI>custodes pacis,</HI> whose office is to assist in the conservation of the peace; to disperse warrants and orders of the justices to each petty constable. There are also two coro∣ners chosen by the freeholders of the county, by virtue of a writ from Chancery, to inquire, by a jury of neighbours, into the violent death of every subject, and to enter the cause and manner of such death upon record. Finally, there is in every coun∣ty a clerk of the market, whose office is to keep a standard of all weights and measures, exactly a∣greeing with the king's standard kept in the Ex∣chequer: to prevent any other from being used in
<PB N="174" REF="1800"/>
the county, to seal all weights and measures made exactly by this standard in his custody, and to burn such as are otherwise.</P>
<P>The civil government varies a little in the cities, boroughs, and villages of England, according to the nature of their charters granted by different princes. Every city, being an epitome of the mo∣narchical government, is ruled by a mayor, alder∣men, and common council, analogous to the king, lords, and commons. The first of these, who is the king's lieutenant, is annually chosen from a∣mong the aldermen; and the common council in∣cludes individuals of all professions or employments followed in the place. Every city enjoys a juris∣diction within itself, to judge in all matters civil and criminal: but all civil causes may be removed to the higher courts at Westminster; nor does the magistracy take any cognizance of capital offences: they are impowered, however, to make bye-laws for the government of the city; and the chief ma∣gistrate, whether mayor, alderman, or portreve, enjoys the power of a justice of the peace within his own liberty, during the year of his office. Boroughs are properly those towns that send burgesses to par∣liament, and are governed, some by a mayor, others by bailiffs, and a few by an alderman or portreve. In villages, the lord of the manour is generally vested with a power, to hold a court ba∣rony every three weeks, for the better government of the inhabitants: but they are more immediately under the check of justices of the peace, assisted by petty constables, who are subservient to their ju∣risdiction. In every parish there is a petty consta∣ble annually chosen, to keep the peace in case of broils or quarrels; to search any house for crimi∣nals; to raise the hue and cry after robbers or murderers; to seize all such, and detain them in the stocks, cage, or other prison, until they can con∣veniently
<PB N="175" REF="1810"/>
bring them before some justice of the peace.</P>
<P>The punishments inflicted on civil criminals in England, are different from those adjudged in other countries. High treason, petit treason, rape, bug∣gery, murder, and felony, are capital crimes by the laws of this country. A traitor is hanged up, cut down immediately, opened alive, and embowelled; then he is quartered, and his head and members are exposed in eminent places. This punishment, which is a disgrace to humanity, was executed lite∣rally, with every circumstance of barbarity, upon the convicted rebels in the year 1746. But in no∣blemen, this sentence is, by the indulgence of the crown, always changed into decapitation; and the criminal in that case is beheaded with an ax on a public scaffold. A traitor is not quit for his own life; but his conviction is attended with the ruin of his family. He forfeits all his lands and goods: his wife loses her dowry: his children are deprived of their nobility, and right of inheritance. Coiners, though adjudged guilty of high treason, are only hanged and drawn. Petit treason, comprehending the murder of a master or mistress by a servant, of a husband by his wife, of a bishop by a clergy∣man, who owes him obedience, is punished by drawing the criminal to the gallows on a hurdle, and hanging him by the neck until he be dead, ex∣cept in the case of a female, who for high treason as well as petit treason, is sentenced to be drawn and burned alive. All other capital crimes are punished by hanging; and in cases of murder, the body of the criminal is adjudged to the surgeons, to be by them dissected in public. If a person in∣dicted of a capital crime, refuses to answer, and put himself upon a legal trial, he is deemed liable to incur the punishment called <HI>peine forte et dure,</HI> inflicted in this manner. Being sent back to the
<PB N="176" REF="1820"/>
prison from whence he came, he is laid upon his back naked on the bare floor of a dark room, and his arms and legs racked with cords drawn through iron rings, fastened at the four corners of the apart∣ment; then an immense weight of iron and stone is laid upon his body. Next day, he receives three morsels of barley bread, without drink; and on the morning of the third day, he is presented with foul water, fetched from the nearest kennel, with∣out bread; the same diet is repeated so long as he lives. There are instances of criminals who have had resolution enough to endure these horrible tor∣tures, that their estates might not be forfeited to the king, but descend to their own children. This savage law continues still in force, but is now seldom executed: the criminal is now at once loaded with additional weight until he expires. In case of high treason, however, the criminal, even though he refuses to plead, may be convicted, and his estate confiscated. In atrocious cases of murder and rob∣bery, the criminal's body is, after execution, hung in chains upon a gibbet, by the road side, where it continues to rot, to the great annoyance of travel∣lers, and the prejudice of those who possess houses and lands in the neighbourhood, which no tenant will occupy on this account. In some kinds of fe∣lony, the criminal escapes with his life by being intitled to the benefit of his clergy; a privilege first granted to ecclesiastics, afterwards extended to those of the laity who could read and write; and, finally, indulged to all subjects, whatever, in all such cases of felony, as are not expressly excepted by acts of parliament: but even where the benefit of clergy is allowed, the criminal is marked in court with a red hot iron, on different parts of his body, according to the nature of his crime. A person convicted of perjury, by bearing false witness upon oath in a court of record, is set in the pillory, and branded
<PB N="177" REF="1830"/>
in the forehead: the trees growing upon his ground are rooted up, and his goods are confiscated. Forge∣ry is punished with death. By concealing treason, which is called misprision of treason, a man for∣feits the profits of his lands and goods during life, and is condemned to perpetual imprisonment. He that strikes another within the king's court, so as to draw blood, is doomed to lose his right-hand, which is cut off in a sad and solemn manner, ac∣cording to the direction of the law. The serjeant of the king's yard brings to the place of execu∣tion a square block, a beetle, a staple and cords to fasten the criminal's hand: the yeoman of the scul∣lery provides a great fire of coals to heat the sear∣ing irons, which are brought by the chief farrier: the groom of the sawcery finds vinegar and cold water: the yeoman of the cellar and pantry, must be present to administer a cup of red wine and a manchet to the criminal: the serjeant of the ewry brings linen for a bandage: the yeomen of the poultry comes with a cock to be applied to the stump: the yeoman of the chandlery provides cere∣cloths: the master-cook finds a sharp dresser-knife, which, at the place of execution, is held upright by the serjeant of the larder, until the operation is performed by an officer appointed for that pur∣pose. The criminal, after having undergone this execution, may be imprisoned during life, or fined and ransomed at the king's pleasure. No such pu∣nishment, however, has been for many years inflict∣ed. A man, by striking another in Westminster∣hall while the courts of justice are sitting, incurs imprisonment for life, and forfeiture of all his estate. Petty larceny, or small theft, under a cer∣tain value, is punished with scourging: a suicide, unless found lunatick by the coroner's inquest, is held <HI>felo de se,</HI> interred by the highway without christian burial, a stake is driven through his body,
<PB N="178" REF="1840"/>
and his goods are forfeited. Drunkards, vagabonds, profane swearers, loose and disorderly persons, are punished by being set in the stocks, as well as by pecuniary mulcts: scolding women are ducked in a chair called the <HI>ducking stool,</HI> contrived for that purpose: other misdemeanors are punished by fine or imprisonment, or both.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The established hierarchy of England is a pro∣testant episcopal church; but liberty of con∣science being allowed, a great variety of sects hath sprung up since the reformation, and all sorts of religion are either connived at or tolerated: indeed, the church of England is the most mild and moderate ecclesiastical institution, which hath ever appeared in any part of christendom. The king of England is acknowledged as supreme head of the Anglicane church, governed by two archbishops and twenty-four suffragans, each of these enjoying the title of lord, on account of the barony annexed to his lordship, and having precedence immedi∣ately after viscounts, in parliament as well as in other assemblies. The two archiepiscopal sees, are those of Canterbury and York, to which all the other dioceses of England and Wales are subject. The archbishop of Canterbury is stiled the pri∣mate of all England, is the first peer of the king∣dom; precedes all dukes and great officers of the crown, next the royal family; performs the cere∣mony of the coronation; is denominated in the king's writs, <HI>Dei gratia archiepiscopus Cantuariensis,</HI> and stiles himself <HI>divina providentia,</HI> whereas other prelates write <HI>divinu permissione.</HI> He is accosted both in speech and writing, with the title of <HI>your grace,</HI> or, <HI>most reverend father in God.</HI> Within his own province, he hath by common law, the power
<PB N="179" REF="1850"/>
of probate of all testaments, and that of granting letters of administration of the goods and chattels of all such as die intestate, either within or with∣out his province. He is impowered to grant li∣cences and dispensations in all cases heretofore sued for at the court of Rome, that are not repugnant to the law of God, or the king's prerogative. He can consecrate a bishop, with the assistance of two other prelates, call provincial synods according to the king's arret, and preside at those synods or con∣vocations, visit the whole province, appoint a guar∣dian of the spiritualities during the vacancy of any bishopric within his province, whereby all the epis∣copal rights of that diocese belong to him, as do all ecclesiastical jurisdictions. He is vested with the power of holding divers courts of judicature for deciding differences in ecclesiastical affairs; he may retain and qualify eight chaplains; and enjoys many other prerogatives and privileges as metropo∣litan of all England. The dioceses contained in the province of Canterbury, are those of London, Winchester, Ely, Lincoln, Rochester, Litchfield and Coventry, Hereford, Worcester, Bath and Wells, Salisbury, Exeter, Chichester, Norwich, Gloucester, Oxford, Peterborough, Bristol; and in Wales, the bishoprics of St. David's, Landaff, St. Asaph, and Bangor. The archbishop of York is stiled primate of England, and metropolitan; hath place and precedence of all dukes next to the royal family, and all great officers of state except to the lord chancellor; is addressed with the title of <HI>your grace,</HI> and <HI>most reverend father in God;</HI> hath the privilege to crown the queen consort, and is her perpetual chaplain: he also can qualify eight chaplains, and enjoys many prerogatives and privi∣leges within his own province, which comprehends the bishoprics of Durham, Carlisle, and Chester, besides that of Soder and Man, which is a kind of a
<PB N="180" REF="1860"/>
detached diocese. All the bishops of England are peers and barons. They are feudal barons in con∣sequence of the lands and baronies annexed to their bishoprics: they are barons by writ, as being sum∣moned by the king's writ to parliament; and they are created barons by patent, exhibited to the arch∣bishop at their consecration. They have the pre∣cedence of all temporal barons under viscounts, and enjoy many extraordinary privileges preferable to those of lay noblemen. A bishop, by his episco∣pal order, may ordain priests and deacons; dedi∣cate churches and burying-places; administer the rites and ceremonies of confirmation; and the power of ordination is inseparable from his office. The jurisdiction of a bishop is either ordinary or de∣legated: as a bishop, he has a power to licence physicians, surgeons, and school-masters; to unite and consolidate small parishes, yet this power is en∣joyed at present by no prelate in England, except the bishop of Norwich, and that only within a cer∣tain distance; to assist the civil magistrate in the execution of some statutes concerning ecclesiastical affairs, to compel the payment of tenths and sub∣sidies, which formerly belonged to the crown, but are now given for the augmentation of smaller be∣nefices. He is impowered to insist upon the pro∣bate of wills; to grant administration to the heirs of those who die intestate; to give orders for col∣lecting and preserving perishable goods, when no person is willing to administer; to exact an account of administrations; to collate benefices; to grant institutions to benefices upon presentations of other patrons; to command induction to be given; to order the profits of vacant benefices to be collected and preserved for the use of the successors; to de∣fend the franchises and liberties of the church; to visit their particular dioceses once in three years, and make inquiry into the morals and doc∣trines
<PB N="181" REF="1870"/>
of the clergy as well as laity. In every ca∣thedral church there is a dean and chapter, the first being an officer next in dignity to the bishop, in∣stalled by virtue of the king's letters patent; the other consisting of a certain number of prebenda∣ries as canons. The dean, and some of the pre∣bendaries, are occasionally summoned by the bishop, to assist him in ordinations, deprivations, condem∣nations of heretics, and in denouncing the sentence of excommunication. Next to the deans are the arch-deacons, of whom there are sixty in the king∣dom of England. Their office is, in obedience to the bishop's mandate, to induct clerks into their benefices, or, in other words, to give him posses∣sions; to visit the diocese two years in three, to know the condition of the churches with respect to necessary reparations and moveables; to reform ec∣clesiastical abuses, and make a representation of all matters of consequence to the bishop of the diocese. There were formerly rural deans, to superintend the conduct of parish priests; but now they are not used. Parish priests are called rectors, unless the great tythes are impropriated; and, in that case, they are denominated vicars. Their office is to take care of the souls of their parishioners, to instruct the ignorant, reform the wicked, recon∣cile differences, perform divine service, administer the sacraments, preach, teach, marry, baptize, re∣turn public thanks after child-bearing, visit the sick, bury the dead, and keep a register of all christen∣ings, marriages, and burials, that happen within the parish. Deacons are impowered to baptize, read prayers in the church, and assist the priest at the Lord's supper, by giving the cup only. Curates are persons in holy orders, employed for a certain stipend, to assist rectors and vicars in their different functions. In every parish there are church-war∣dens, elected annually by the priest and the parishi∣oners,
<PB N="182" REF="1880"/>
to keep the church in good repair, and pro∣perly adorned, and see that nothing be wanting to divine service; to take care that the church-yard be properly enclosed, to superintend the wants of the inhabitants, present scandalous livers to the ordi∣nary, collect the charity of the parishioners, and ex∣ecute the orders of the bishop. The lowest retainer to the church is the sacristan, commonly called the sexton or clerk, chosen by the parson and parish, qualified to read, write, and sing psalms, and sub∣servient to the priest, curate, and church-wardens.</P>
<P>The great assembly of the clergy is a na∣tional synod or convocation, summoned to meet at a place assigned by the king's writ, directed to the archbishop of each province. In consequence of this address, the archbishop of Canterbury directs his mandate to the bishop of London, as his pro∣vincial, willing him to cite all the bishops, deans, archdeacons, and all the clergy of his province, to assemble at a certain time and place, and directing that one proctor may be sent for each cathedral and collegiate church, and two for the body of the inferior clergy of each diocese. The convocation is divided into two houses: the higher house in the province of Canterbury consisting of two and twenty prelates, of which the archbishop is presi∣dent; and the lower house being composed of all the deans, archdeacons, and proctors, to the num∣ber of one hundred and sixty-six, including twenty-two deans, twenty-four prebendaries, fifty-four archdeacons, and forty-four clerks, representing the diocesan clergy. The convocation was assembled at the beginning of every parliament, and continu∣ed sitting during the session of the parliament. It was usually convoked in St. Paul's church, from whence the archbishop adjourned them to West∣minster; the bishops, under their metropolitan, as∣sembling in Henry VII's chapel, while the lower
<PB N="183" REF="1890"/>
house, under a prolocutor of their own choosing, met in the Jerusalem chamber. The business of this assembly was to deliberate and consult about the concerns of the church, and superintend her legislative power. In a word, it was deemed a part of the English constitution; but is now set aside, for the convocation has not been allowed to sit and do business, except at one time, since the reign of queen Anne. The archbishop of York may hold a convocation of his province in the same manner, and, by means of a regular correspondence with the other, debate and determine the same matters that are canvassed and concluded in this synod of Can∣terbury; not that the province of York is at all re∣stricted by the transactions and determinations of the southern convocation.</P>
<P>The church of England is likewise possessed of civil jurisdiction, exerted in different tribunals; and in these all trials are conducted according to the civil and canon law, the judges having neither as∣sessors nor jury, but pronouncing sentence by virtue of his own understanding and prerogative. The court of Delegates, though it takes cogni∣zance of ecclesiastical affairs, can hardly be num∣bered among the jurisdictions of the church, as it is the resource of those who appeal from the de∣crees or sentences given in ecclesiastical causes, by the archbishop, or any of his officials. The judges are here delegated, and sit by virtue of the king's commission, under the great seal, to hear such ap∣peals to his majesty as supreme head of the church. Each archbishop hath a vicar-general, and every bishop appoints a chancellor, by whom all episcopal power and jurisdiction are executed. These vicars-general and chancellors are created by letters-pa∣tent, under the seals of the respective metropolitans and bishops, and confirmed by the dean and chap∣ter of three several cathedrals. To every chapter,
<PB N="184" REF="1900"/>
a particular jurisdiction and ecclesiastical court be∣long. In these, the judge, who is usually a doctor of the civil law, tries before the vicars-general and chancellors, all ecclesiastical causes within their re∣spective dioceses, except the bishop, or ordinary, should grant letters of request to the party, that he may sue in the court of Arches, which is the highest court of the archbishop of Canterbury. The court of Arches derives its name from the arched church and tower of St. Mary le Bow, in London, where it was usually held. The judge, distinguished by the name of dean of the arches, sits without any as∣sessors, and determines causes without a jury. He takes cognizance of appeals, in ecclesiastical matters, within the province of Canterbury; and all process is returnable before him, in the common-hall of Doctors Commons. The pleaders and sollicitors of this court are known by the appellation of ad∣vocates and proctors; the first being doctors of the civil law, and, by the statutes of the court, the pleadings and petitions ought to be in the Latin tongue. The court of Audience is held, when the archbishop evocates a cause to his own hearing, in∣terfering in any difference between parties, con∣cerning elections and consecrations of bishops, ad∣mission and institution into benefices, and dispen∣sing with bans of matrimony. The court of Pre∣rogative, which likewise sits in the common-hall of Doctors Commons, is also held in the name of the archbishop, <HI>jure prerogativae suae,</HI> and takes cogni∣zance of estates fallen by will, or by intestates. The judge is attended by the register and his deputy, who record all the decrees of the court, and all ori∣ginal wills of persons having <HI>bona nota bilia.</HI> In the Prerogative-office, a man, for one shilling, may peruse every such will that has been registered since the insurrection of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, by whom many records were burned and destroyed
<PB N="185" REF="1910"/>
in the reign of king Richard II. Certain parishes, in several dioceses, are exempt from the jurisdiction of their respective bishops, and ruled by a court of Peculiars, belonging to the archbishop of Canter∣bury. Besides these tribunals, constituted for the use of the whole province, every bishop holds his court in the cathedral of his own diocese, where his chancellor sits as judge, and decides by the canon and civil law. The dean and chapter also hold a court, in which cognizance is taken of causes hap∣pening in places belonging to the cathedral; and the archdeacon hath a court and jurisdiction, in which small differences are determined. Finally, there are certain peculiar jurisdictions belonging to some parishes, the inhabitants of which are ex∣empt, sometimes from the bishop's, and some∣times from the archdeacon's jurisdiction; but sub∣jected to their respective prebendaries. The pun∣ishments inflicted by ecclesiastical courts are various, according to the nature of the offence, including seclusion from the sacrament, public penance, which is generally commuted for a sum of money, denial of christian burial, and the sentence of ex∣communication, by which a man is disabled from being plaintiff in a process, and in a great measure deprived of the protection of the law. The punish∣ments peculiar to the delinquents among the clergy are these, <HI>suspensio ab officio,</HI> when a minister is, for a certain time, declared unfit to perform the func∣tions of an ecclesiastic; <HI>suspensio a beneficio,</HI> when, for a certain time, he is deprived of the profits of his benefice; <HI>deprivatio a beneficio,</HI> when, for a greater crime, he is deprived of his benefice for ever; and, lastly, <HI>deprivatio ab officio,</HI> when, for some capital crime, he is solemnly degraded by the bishop, who, with his own hands, strips him of his ecclesiastical vestments, and the ensigns of his order, and delivers him to the civil magistrate, to be punished as a layman, according to the nature of his offence.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="1920"/>
The clergy of England enjoy certain privileges with which the laity are not indulged. An eccle∣siastic pays no toll for his goods in fair or market; he is exempted from personal functions or services of the commonwealth, such as those of sheriff, constable, overseer of the poor, and other parish offices; his goods are likewise discharged from tolls and customs, unless he deals in traffick: he is not to be disturbed or molested in the execution of his function; he is not to be fined or amerced according to his spiritual, but according to his tem∣poral means: he is not obliged to serve in war, nor in the leet, nor bound to follow the hue and cry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hue and cry, de∣rived from the French words <HI>huer</HI> and <HI>crier,</HI> is the pursuit of a murderer or felon, con∣ducted by the constable of the hundred, upon due infor∣mation made to this officer, who calls upon the parish for aid; and if the criminal is not found in his district, gives warning to the constable of the next parish: in this manner search is made from hundred to hundred, beginning at the place where the crime was committed, and continuing to the sea-side, in the line which the criminal followed, unless the felon be taken be∣fore they proceed so far.</NOTE>; nor be burned in the hand, though convicted of a crime, for which he is allowed benefit of his clergy: and the privilege of clergy, which no layman has above once, he enjoys from time to time <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> If a hundred be sued for a robbery, and is taxed to make good the damage, the minister pays no part of the contribution; nor is he assessed for watching, or warding, or mending the highways.</P>
<P>The revenues of the church are not near so con∣siderable as they were before the reformation; some of the bishopricks, however, are very wealthy, and all of them sufficient to maintain the dignity of the several incumbents. The annual revenues in several dioceses exceeds five thousand pounds sterling. The English bishops are remarkable for their learn∣ing, piety, and charity; but they do not affect the
<PB N="187" REF="1930"/>
splendour and hospitality by which their prede∣cessors, in the prelacy, were distinguished. The benefices of England are altogether insufficient for the maintenance of the clergy; nearly one third of the best livings in the kingdom, having been an∣tiently appropriated to monasteries by the pope's grant, were converted into lay fees, when those monasteries were dissolved by Henry VIII. Besides, there are many large estates, wholly exempted from the payment of tythes, either as lands which for∣merly belonged to monasteries, or through corrupt compositions, contracts, and customs. Moreover, one ecclesiastic is capable of holding two livings, besides a deanery or prebend; so that a few, who have interest, engross all the best benefices, and the rest of the clergy are but poorly accommodated. The ministers of England are generally sensible, moderate, and exemplary in their deportment. Their sermons are well composed, and distinctly de∣livered, yet without that emphatic manner, and those strokes of popular oratory, which interest the passions of the audience. They pique them∣selves upon the sound reasoning, the elegance of stile, and the correctness of composition, rather than the pathos of their discourses.</P>
<P>The clergy of the church of England have been very instrumental in forming divers religious so∣cieties for the reformation of manners, for propa∣gating the gospel in foreign parts, and for promot∣ing christian knowledge. The endeavours of these societies have been crowned with such success, by the voluntary contributions of well-disposed people, that many missions are established in different parts of the world, for making converts to the pro∣testant communion; many thousands of bibles, and other religious books, pamphlets, and sermons, have been distributed for the propagation of christi∣anity, and the reformation of manners: and a
<PB N="188" REF="1940"/>
great number of charity schools have been erected in different parts of the kingdom. The number of these at present must exceed fifteen hundred, in which above forty thousand children of both sexes are taught to read, write, and repeat the catechism. The first establishment of these schools at London was owing to the unwearied diligence of the society, in solliciting subscriptions, and voluntary contribu∣tions, to the plans which they formed, and the di∣rections which they published. The charitable people of the country followed the example of the metropolis; so that schools were soon opened in all parts of the island. The society for propagating the gospel in foreign parts, and that for promoting christian knowledge, were united in one corpora∣tion by a royal charter of king William III. It consists of above four hundred persons, distinguished by the names of the sitting and corresponding mem∣bers. The former meet every week at St. Paul's chapter-house in London, and contribute annually to the expence of the undertaking: the correspond∣ing members are not obliged to contribute; but when they come to the metropolis, they have a right to assist at the weekly meetings of this society.</P>
<P>Among these public associations, we may like∣wise number that of the sons of the clergy, incor∣porated by king Charles II. for the relief of poor widows and children of ecclesiastics; and the corpo∣ration for an augmentation to poor livings, esta∣blished by queen Anne, who, with unparralleled ge∣nerosity, granted the whole revenue of first fruits and tenths towards this charitable institution.</P>
<P>Against the Roman catholics, which are pretty numerous in England, divers penal laws have been enacted, in consequence of frequent attempts which individuals of that communion have made to sub∣vert the constitution: but these laws are seldom or never executed; and the papists of this kingdom
<PB N="189" REF="1950"/>
enjoy greater liberty of conscience than is allowed to protestants in any catholic state of Europe, where no such practices can be laid to their charge.</P>
<P>England, since the reformation, has been famous for religious sects, that enjoy their fanaticism with∣out molestation; of these the chief are the presby∣terians, independents, anabaptists, and quakers. The independents and anabaptists differ not much, in point of doctrine and discipline, from the presbyterians, whom we have already described in the account of Scotland; except in the article of infant baptism, which is rejected by the anabap∣tists, who baptise adults only, and thereby dipping the whole body; whence they derive the name of anabaptists. The quakers are, perhaps, the most extraordinary sect that ever any religion produced. They dissent from the established church in some of the fundamental doctrines of christianity; and, in their outward deportment, study to distinguish themselves from the rest of mankind. They re∣ject the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's sup∣per, the ordination of ministers, and, indeed, all the rites and ceremonies of the church. They do not acknowledge the mysteries of the trinity, incar∣nation, and hypostatical union: they doubt about the ascension of Christ in the body, with which he appeared to St. Thomas: they deny the resurrec∣tion of the flesh: and pretend to be conducted in all things by the spirit, a sort of inward light or illu∣mination. About the year 1624, when the king-dom was overspread with fanaticism in all its wild∣ness and extravagance, this sect was founded by one George Fox, a native of Lancashire, whom his fa∣ther had bound apprentice to a shoe-maker. This ignorant fellow feeling a greater propensity to spiritual contemplations, than to the employment in which he was engaged, deserted his master, and
<PB N="190" REF="1960"/>
strolled about the country in a leathern doublet, with his bible in his pocket. He broke off all communication with his friends and family, and passed whole days in hollow trees, indulging the wildest reveries of ignorant enthusiasm. Having settled within himself his plan of reformation, he began to make proselytes, and was very successful in his endeavours. He, and his disciples, not only rejected all rites of religion; but carefully avoided the common forms of civility, as the inventions of carnal vanity and self-conceit. They refused to be∣stow any titles of distinction, or to accost any per∣son by any other salutation than that of <HI>friend.</HI> They would neither bend their bodies, move their hats, nor express the least signs of reverence and respect. They reduced their language to the sim∣plicity of <HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee, yea</HI> and <HI>nay,</HI> terms which they used to all persons without distinction of rank or character. They laid aside every superfluity and ornament in dress, such as plaits to the coat, but∣tons to the sleeve or hat, lace, ruffles, and em∣broidery. Such violence of enthusiasm, founded on the opinion of a directing spirit within them, could not fail to produce strange effects upon the nerves of the body. Their bodies were agitated by convulsions, distortions, and tremblings of the limbs; and hence they derived the name of quakers. They considered these agitations as the motion of the holy spirit, and uttered extempora∣neous effusions, twanged through the nose, as the oracles of inspiration. They would admit no priest into their society, believing that each individual was already stamped with a much superior character, by means of divine illumination. At their meet∣ings, every person who felt the inward motion was qualified to preach and to teach: even women were considered as proper vehicles to convey the dictates of the holy spirit: sometimes many persons were
<PB N="191" REF="1970"/>
moved to speak at once: sometimes the whole congregation was silent. They refined likewise in their morals. They preached up universal peace and forbearance, and consequently inveighed against war and the arm of flesh. A quaker being asked for his cloak, gave his coat also; when smote upon the cheek, he held up the other: no consideration would induce him to swear, even to the truth, in any court of judicature: nor if he dealt in merchan∣dize, would he demand for his wares more than the precise sum which he was resolved to have. The zeal of the quakers was often too hard for their discretion, and they played a thousand extra∣vagant pranks that savoured more of lunacy than of religion. They broke into churches, and dis∣turbed the public worship, by railing at the mi∣nister, and reproaching the congregation. The spirit moved them to revile all persons that did not adopt their doctrines and principles. They held forth in churches, streets, and courts of judicature, undervaluing worship, business, and proceedings at law: they uttered blasphemies, and seduced zealots from the army. A female quaker went stark naked into a church where Oliver Cromwell assisted at divine service, and said she was moved by the spirit to appear as <HI>a sign</HI> to the people. A great number of them fancied the revolution of all things was begun, and threw away their cloaths, with the rest of their superfluities. Such irregula∣rities could not fail to attract the notice of the civil power. They were sometimes confined to mad∣houses; sometimes sent to prison; many were scourged in public, and a few set in the pillory. All these severities they bore with such patience, that they were believed to be supported by supernatural assistance. James Naylor fancied himself Christ, the Saviour of the world, and pretended to work miracles. He attempted to raise a person from
<PB N="192" REF="1980"/>
the dead: he entered Bristol mounted on a horse, while his disciples spread their garments before him, crying Hosanna to the highest! holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of sabaoth: when apprehended as a blasphemer and impostor, and brought before the civil magistrate, he would make no other answer to the questions that were put to him, but "thou hast said it." The behaviour of this frantic en∣thusiast attracted the attention of the parliament, which, after ten days spent in debates and enquiries about him, condemned him to be set in the pillory, to be scourged, burned in the face, and have his tongue bored through with a red hot iron. All these severities he bore with patience, and even a kind of triumph: but when he was committed to the house of correction, debarred all communica∣tion with his disciples, kept to hard labour, and fed with bread and water, his illusions dissipated: he found himself no more than an ordinary man, and, being set at liberty, retired quietly to his former occupation. The quakers of England have formed themselves into a body, governed by cer∣tain regulations, and are, perhaps, more united than any other society, whether civil or religious, in all christendom. They hold stated assemblies monthly and quarterly in London, and other great towns, where they likewise have meetings for their worship. All the different branches of this society in Great Britain, Ireland, and the plantations, cor∣respond together by regular communications: they encourage and support one another in refusing the payment of tythes, which they account an abomi∣nation: they even censure and excommunicate the back-sliding brethren, and keep exact registers of all their transactions. This sect has not been em∣braced by any persons of distinction, except Wil∣liam Penn, who settled the province of Pensylva∣nia, and founded the flourishing city of Phila∣delphia,

in North America, and Robert Barclay of Urie, a gentleman of North Britain, who not only espoused, but defended their principles, in a celebrated performance, called <HI>Barclay's Apology,</HI> which he dedicated to king Charles II. The quakers are generally employed in trade and manu∣facture, in which they have been found so quiet and inoffensive, and by their remarkable industry so beneficial to the commonwealth, that the go∣vernment hath thought proper not only to indulge them with a toleration in point of religion; but likewise to accept of their simple affirmation, in∣stead of oath, as sufficient evidence in any court of judicature.</P>

<HEAD>Of the KING.</HEAD>
<P>The monarch of England is distinguished by the titles of George, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, king, defender of the faith. He stiles himself king of France from an antient claim which his predecessors had to that kingdom, of which he possesses nothing at present but three or four inconsiderable islands on the coast of Normandy. The title, defender of the faith was an antient appellation given to the kings of England; but more particularly confirmed by Leo X. to Henry VIII. in consequence of a book written by this prince against Luther, in defence of the seven sacraments. The title was afterwards continued by act of parliament. The king of England is supreme head of the church, and chief magistrate of the kingdom. He has the supreme right of patronage, paramount over all the ecclesi∣astical benefices in England: he is the supreme civil judge, and the fountain from which all justice is derived. His person is accounted so sacred, that the laws of England have fixed the penalty of high
<PB N="194" REF="2010"/>
treason even upon those who imagine or intend only the death of their sovereign; though, in all other capital cases, an Englishman cannot be punished with death, unless an act follows the intention. Nay, an ideot or lunatic, whom as a person <HI>non compos mentis,</HI> the law holds incapable of commit∣ting felony, or any other species of treason, is punished with death as a traitor, if he either kills, or attempts to kill the king of England. The same penalty is inflicted upon those who kill certain offi∣cers of the crown, or any of the king's judges ex∣ecuting their office, as well as upon those who coun∣terfeit the king's seal or his monies, because by all these his person is represented. The king of Eng∣land promises on oath, at his coronation, to pre∣serve the rights and privileges of the church and clergy, the royal prerogatives belonging to the crown, the laws and customs of the realm; to do justice, love mercy, maintain peace and unity. The chief articles of prerogative enjoyed by the kings of England, we have enumerated in our ac∣count of the parliament: but, there are many others of less consequence, which the confined nature of our plan will not allow us to particularize. It may suffice to say, that in point of dignity, pomp, and revenue, he rivals the greatest monarchs in Christen∣dom; and though he is restricted by the laws of the kingdom, and the privileges of the subject, from exercising any open acts of oppression, he is supplied with all the power and means which a good prince could wish to enjoy, for making him∣self great, and his people happy. His civil list, or private revenue, amounts to 800000 <HI>l.</HI> sterling year∣ly: he possesses many castles, palaces, parks, and forests, for residence and diversion: he is personally treated with the utmost reverence and respect by his subjects, who kneel when they present their ad∣dresses to him: at all times he is served upon the
<PB N="195" REF="2020"/>
knee, and all persons, whatever, stand waiting with heads uncovered in his presence.</P>
<P>The royal state of his Britannic majesty is sup∣ported by a great number of extraordinary ceremo∣nies and appointments. Over and above the oeco∣nomy of his houshold, which is in all respects suit∣able to the grandeur of a great monarch, the pro∣vision made for the immediate defence of his per∣son is equally magnificent and effectual. The palace and its precincts are defended by detachments from a body of foot guards, consisting of seven battalions quartered in the neighbourhood, who take their turns in this honourable department of duty. They are fine shewy troops, always fresh in their cloathing, neat and clean in every article of dress, arms, and accoutrements; and every regiment is provided with an excellent band of musick, which plays every morning when the guard is relieved at the palace. The horse-guards, otherwise known by the name of the life-guards, consist of seven hundred and twenty-four horsemen, divided into two troops, and each of these subdivided into four squadrons. They are well mounted and accoutred, and cloathed in scarlet, adorned with gold lace. Two squadrons with trumpets mount guard one day in six, and are relieved in their turns. They attend the king in detachments wheresoever he goes, and parties are detached from the guard to give their attendance on the prince of Wales. When his majesty walks on foot, one of the cap∣tains attends next to his person, carrying in his hand an ebony staff or truncheon, headed with gold, and engraved with his majesty's cypher and crown. An∣other commissioned officer follows the captain, that he may relieve him occasionally, with an ebony staff, having a silver head; and two inferior bri∣gadiers likewise attend with ebony staves, at a greater distance. There are also two troops of gre∣nadier
<PB N="196" REF="2030"/>
horse-guards, who have their own distinct officers, and are cloathed in a different manner from the life-guards, with which, however, they mount guard by divisions. They perform duty on foot, in attending the king when he walks abroad, and always march with great detachments.</P>
<P>Over and above these external guards of horse and foot, there is a military government maintain∣ed within the king's house, above as well as below. There is a band of forty gentlemen pensioners, one half of whom are always upon duty in the presence chamber, where they receive the king when he comes forth from his privy-lodgings. They at∣tend his person to and from the chapel royal, as well as at all great solemnities, coronations, St. George's feast, when he goes to parliament, and when he gives public audience to ambassadors. They are richly cloathed in scarlet trimmed with broad gold lace, are commanded by a captain, who is generally a nobleman of the first rank, un∣der whom there is a lieutenant and standard-bearer. This pension was originally intended for a mainte∣nance to decayed gentlemen; but now it is sold like any other sine-cure to the best bidder. Their arms were gilt pole-axes, except in time of war, when they appeared on horseback, armed like cui∣rassiers, with swords and pistols. At present, they wear swords only.</P>
<P>Besides the pensioners, there is another guard of one hundred yeomen, who attend in the first room above stairs, called the guard-chamber. They are chosen for their large and portly stature, cloathed in long scarlet coats, richly guarded with black velvet, and adorned with badges of embroidery, both before and behind. Instead of hats, they wear broad crowned caps of black velvet, decked with ribbons of the king's colour. Their arms are long partisans and swords: they are commanded by
<PB N="197" REF="2040"/>
exempts. They have an allowance of wages and diet; and their duty is to attend the king's person at home and abroad, thirty-six waiting by day, and eighteen watching by night. These places can hardly be called military, as they are generally sold to persons who never carried arms in the service; so that they are kept, not so much for use, as for state and pageantry.</P>
<P>The royal atchievement, borne by the reigning family, is thus marshalled, quarterly, in the first grand quarter Mars, three lions passant-guardant in pale, Sol, the imperial ensigns of England: these are impaled with the royal arms of Scotland, consisting of Sol, a lion rampant within a double tressure flowered and counterflowered, with fleurs delis, Mars. The second quarter contains the arms of France, namely, Jupiter, three fleurs de lis, Sol. The third, for Ireland, exhibits Jupiter, an harp, Sol, stringed, Luna. In the fourth grand quarter is represented his present majesty's own coat of arms, being Mars, two lions passant-guar∣dant, Sol, for Brunswick, impaled with Lunen∣burgh, giving Sol, semeé of hearts, proper, a lion rampant, Jupiter, having for antient Saxony, Mars, an horse current, Luna, grafted in base; and in a shield surtout, Mars, the diadem, or, a crown of Charlemagne; the whole surrounded with a garter, as sovereign of that order. Above the helmet, as the emblem of sovereign jurisdiction, is an imperial crown; the crest, a lion passant-guardant crowned with the like: the supporters, a lion rampant-guardant, Sol, crowned as the former; and an unicorn, Luna, gorged with a crown, and chained. The royal motto is, <HI>Dieu et mon droit,</HI> implying that the king of England holds his crown of God only. The table of the compartment is adorned with the rose and thistle intermingled, as the emblem of the union of England and Scotland.</P>

The eldest son of the king of England is born duke of Cornwall, and afterwards created prince of Wales, with letters-patent, by which the said principality is granted to him and his heirs, kings of England. He bears the king's arms, with the addition of a label of three points, charged with nine torteaux; his device being a coronet beautified with three ostrich feathers, inscribed <HI>Ich dien,</HI> signi∣fying in the German language, I serve: this de∣vice was borne at the battle of Cresci by John, the blind king of Bohemia, who served as a volunteer in the French army, and was slain fighting hand to hand with Edward the Black Prince. The prince of Wales enjoys certain privileges that no other sub∣ject can claim. The person who imagines his death, or violates his wife, is deemed guilty of high treason. The prince is presumed to be of age as soon as born, and may, on the day of his birth, sue for the livery of the dukedom of Cornwall; and he may qualify any number of chaplains. What he receives annually from the dutchy of Cornwall, does not exceed fourteen thousand pounds: but the revenue of the late prince of Wales, as establish∣ed by act of parliament, amounted to one hundred thousand pounds, clear of all deductions. The younger sons of the king are not born, but created dukes or earls; yet they are by birth counsellors of state: and all the children of the king are ad∣dressed with the title of royal highness. The daughters are stiled princesses, and it is deemed high treason to violate the eldest unmarried.</P>

<HEAD>GREAT OFFICERS of the CROWN.</HEAD>
<P>Next to the king and princes of the blood, we shall describe the great officers of the crown, of whom there are nine ranks, the high-steward, lord high chancellor, lord treasurer, lord president, lord
<PB N="199" REF="2060"/>
privy-seal, lord chamberlain, constable, earl mar∣shal, and lord high admiral. Antiently the highest office in England, under the king, was that of lord high-steward, so called from the Saxon words <HI>stede</HI> and <HI>ward locum tenens,</HI> properly speaking, a viceroy. The law stiled him, <HI>Magnus Angliae Se∣neschallus,</HI> and his power was so exorbitant, that it is not now trusted in the hands of any subject. A steward, however, is created occasionally, <HI>pro hac vice,</HI> to officiate at a coronation, and preside at the trial of peers for treason or felony. During his stewardship, he bears in his hand a white staff, which, when the trial is determined, he breaks, and so his office ends. The office of the lord chancellor we have already described in our account of the courts of judicature; the name <HI>cancellarius</HI> is derived from one part of his office, that is the power he has to cancel what he thinks amiss, in any patent, commission, or warrant, sent from the king to be sealed with the great seal. The words to be cancelled, he expunges by drawing cross lines over them, like lattices, called in Latin, <HI>can∣celli;</HI> or else he acquired this appellation by sitting antiently <HI>intra cancellos,</HI> within such a partition as now separates the church from the chancel. The salary of this great post amounts to above seven thousand pounds a year; but of late, it has been customary for persons who accept the office, to re∣ceive a large sum from the crown when first appoint∣ed, together with the settlement of a yearly pen∣sion of four or five thousand pounds, to commence when they are dismissed from this high station. The lord chancellor and the lord keeper are the same in authority, power, and precedence: yet there is a difference between them in the creation. The keeper is created by the king's delivering the great seal into his hands, and his taking the oath; but the lord chancellor hath a patent besides. A
<PB N="200" REF="2070"/>
lord keeper is created only during the vacation of the chancellorship, to perform the functions of this office. The lord treasurer was vested with his of∣fice by receiving a white staff from the king, and held it <HI>durante bene placito regis;</HI> but since the ac∣cession of the present royal family, the office hath been put in commission, and the business of the revenue managed by commissioners, called lords of the treasury. The fourth great officer of state is the lord president of the king's privy council, created by letters-patent under the great seal, during his majesty's pleasure. He attends upon the king, to propose matters at the council table; and to re∣port the transactions of the council to his majesty. Next to the president is the lord privy-seal, a privy counsellor, <HI>ex officio,</HI> through whose hands all charters, grants, and pardons signed by the king, are passed before they are confirmed by the great seal of England; he likewise seals warrants for pen∣sions, and the payment of money in other matters, which do not require the confirmation of the great seal. His salary does not exceed fifteen hundred pounds a-year: but, in dignity, he is ranked among the chief personages of the realm. The lord chamber∣lain of England is an officer of great power, and enjoys a great number of perquisites. He takes care to provide all things in the house of lords in time of parliament; and to him belongs the go∣vernment of the whole palace. He issues warrants for preparing and furnishing Westminster-hall for coronations and trials of peers; and the gentleman usher of the black rod, with his deputies, are under the chamberlain's command. Upon all solemn oc∣casions, the keys of Westminster hall, the court of Wards, and court of Requests, are delivered to this officer. He is intitled to livery and lodging in the king's court, to certain fees from the pre∣lates, when they do homage or fealty to the king,
<PB N="201" REF="2080"/>
as well as from all the peers of the realm, at their creation. At the ceremony of a coronation he re∣ceives forty ells of crimson velvet for his own robes, and after he hath apparelled the king for this oc∣casion, he takes for his fees, the bed and furni∣ture of the bed chamber, together with all his majesty's night-apparel. He carries at the cere∣mony the coat, gloves, and linnen, the sword and scabbard, the gold to be offered by the king, with the robe royal and crown: he attires his majesty in the royal robes, and serves him that day, be∣fore and after dinner, with water, taking the bason and towel for his fees. The lord chamber∣lain superintends all the officers of the king's houshold, above stairs, except the precinct of the king's bed-chamber; as also all the officers of the wardrobe at all his majesty's houses, the serjeants at arms, physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, and chaplains: all, or most of these places, and many others, are in his gift, and he enjoys a salary of twelve hundred pounds. The office of lord high constable of England has been thought too powerful for any subject; and therefore dropped, except upon certain occasions, when a lord high constable is created <HI>pro illa vice.</HI> He assisted at the coronation, presided at all solemn trials by combat, which are now disused, shared the power and jurisdiction of the earl-marshal, of whom he took place. The post of earl-marshal is a military office, like that of the constable, and has been long hereditary in the house of Norfolk. He took cognizance of all matters of war and arms, assisted by the kings at arms and heralds, who sit in their proper habits, in the college of Heralds, which is called a court of chivalry. He marshals the cere∣mony at the proclamation and coronation of kings, their marriages, funerals, interviews, and festi∣vals, &amp;c. He held the court of the Marshalsea, to
<PB N="202" REF="2090"/>
take cognizance of all offences committed within the verge of his majesty's palace: but now it is kept in the name of the lord steward of the king's houshold; and his power, in other respects, is al∣most abrogated. The last great officer of the crown of England is the lord-high-admiral, com∣mander in chief of the British navy, to whom was committed the whole government of the marine, vested with a power to appoint sea-officers, as well as commissioners or judges for exercising justice in the court of admiralty: the office is now put into commission, and the commissioners are stiled lords of the admiralty. They take cognizance of every thing relating to the sea, and to them is subservient the navy-board, victualling-office, and all the commissioners of the dock-yards in England.</P>
<P>Exclusive of the great officers of state, are those appointed for the civil government of the king's court. The chief of these is lord steward of the king's houshold, who carries a white staff in the king's presence; attends his majesty's person; at the beginning of parliament administers the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to all the members of the house of commons; adjusts the parliamentary expences; and is vested with authority over all the officers and servants of the king's house, except those belonging to the chapel, bedchamber, and stable. The next is the lord chamberlain, whose office both in the state and in the houshold we have already explained. The third great officer of the king's court, is the master of the horse, antiently known by the name of <HI>comes stabuli,</HI> or constable. He superintends the king's stable and studs; takes charge of all the revenues and lands appropriated for the maintenance of the king's horses; exercises authority over all equerries and pages, footmen, grooms, farriers, and all servants and tradesmen belonging to the king's stables; at any solemn ca∣valcade,
<PB N="203" REF="2100"/>
he rides behind the king, leading a led horse of state, and generally accompanies his ma∣jesty in the coach of state, when he goes to the up∣per house of parliament. All the servants of his majesty's houshold are subordinate to these three principal officers.</P>
<P>The civil government of England is regulated, and every new measure of the administration, pro∣posed and planned in the privy-council, consisting of those noblemen and others, whom the king pleases to choose for their rank and fortune, wis∣dom, knowledge, and integrity, in order to con∣sult and deliberate with them, upon all affairs of consequence relating to the government: they like∣wise sit as a court of judicature, to determine ap∣peals from Ireland and the plantations. They con∣tinue in this honourable office during the king's pleasure: when summoned, they attend his ma∣jesty at council-board, and sit in their order bare-headed, when the king presides. At all debates, the lowest delivers his opinion first; and the sove∣reign at last, by declaring his judgment, determines the matter of debate. A privy-counsellor, though a gentleman only, takes precedence of all knights and younger sons of barons, and his person is held sa∣cred. He takes an oath to advise the king truly, justly, and evenly, to the best of his power and dis∣cretion, and to keep secret his majesty's counsel.</P>
<P>A council is seldom or never held, except when one of the secretaries of state is present. These two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a third secretary lately appointed for the affairs of the colonies.</NOTE> officers, stiled principal secretaries of state, are in effect the prime ministers of England. They present petitions and requests to the crown, and make dispatches according to his majesty's answers and directions. They manage a corres∣pondence with all parts of the British dominions,
<PB N="204" REF="2110"/>
in order to carry on the administration of the inte∣rior government. They dispatch instructions to ambassadors resident in foreign countries, as well as to generals employed in expeditions abroad; and all the returns of negociations and intelligence are made to the secretaries of state, one of whom is ge∣nerally the person chosen by the king to manage and direct the machine of government. With re∣spect to the business transacted, each has his own separate office and department: with respect to their appointments, each secretary enjoys a salary of two thousand pounds, together with board wages, and lodgings in the king's palace, for the accommodation of him and his attendants.</P>
<P>Every regulation, with respect to the army, is managed by the secretary at war, who is an officer of great trust, enjoys considerable appointments, and keeps his office at Whitehall. Independent of this, however, are the board of ordnance, and the office of paymaster-general, who receives and issues money for the payment of the sorces.</P>
<P>All commercial matters, together with matters relating to the improvement of the colonies, are examined and discussed at the board of trade, con∣sisting of lords commissioners for trade and planta∣tions, appointed by the king. There are, besides, a variety of inferior boards, established for the ma∣nagement of the revenue and other articles of na∣tional oeconomy, of which we cannot pretend to give a minute detail: such are the post-office, ex∣cise, customs, and stamp-offices.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>NOBILITY.</HEAD>
<P>The nobility of England are numerous and wealthy; and enjoy many honourable privileges: but they possess no power which could be incom∣patible with the rights and liberties of their fellow∣subjects. The majority of them live with great
<PB N="205" REF="2120"/>
magnificence, especially at their country-seats, which are indeed elegant palaces, adorned with fine gardens, ponds, parks, and plantations. No country in Christendom can produce such a number of noblemen living in all the pomp of affluence, and all the joy of independence, secured by the law from the arm of arbitrary power, and, in their turn, disabled by the law from exercising the rod of oppression. They are distinguished by the dif∣ferent titles of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron; and, according to these degrees, take prece∣dency of one another: but they are all equally peers of England, created by patent, and as barons sit in the house of lords, which is the supreme court of judicature in the kingdom. Some of the pri∣vileges of the peers it may not be amiss to specify. A peer is the king's hereditary counsellor; his per∣son is sacred from arrest, except in case of treason, felony, breach of the peace, condemnation in par∣liament, or contempt of the king. In these cases he cannot be tried but by a jury of peers: he cannot be impanneled on any jury of inquest: he cannot be bound to his good behaviour, nor obliged to swear in a court of justice; but only to declare up∣on his honour. In case of lawful absence, he can constitute a proxy to vote for him in parlia∣ment; a privilege which no commoner enjoys. He is exempted from all attendance at sheriff's turns and leets, where other subjects are obliged to take the oath of allegiance; as also from joining the <HI>posse comitatus,</HI> when it is raised by the sheriff to sup∣press routs and riots. He cannot be outlawed in any civil action, nor pressed to death as a commoner, when mute upon his trial; and when condemned to die, he is indulged with the honour of decapi∣tation. The house of a peer, in case of a search for prohibited books, cannot be entered by the of∣ficers of justice, without a warrant under the king's
<PB N="206" REF="2130"/>
own hand, signed by six members of the privy∣council, four of whom must be peers of the realm. A peer cannot be assessed towards a standing mi∣litia, but by six more of his own quality. He has the privilege of qualifying a certain number of chaplains, who, after a dispensation from the arch∣bishop, ratified under the great seal of England, may hold plurality of benefices within such a dis∣tance, with cure of souls: finally, his character is peculiarly guarded from slander and abuse, by a statute called <HI>scandalum magnatum.</HI> The sons of nobility enjoy certain titles by curtesy, according to the rank of their fathers; but the law ranks them among the commons of England. Thus the eldest son of a duke is denominated marquis or earl, and the younger sons are saluted by the ap∣pellation of my lord. The first son of a marquis or earl is denominated lord of some barony be∣longing to his father; and his brothers are like∣wise addressed by the title of lord <HI>John,</HI> or lord <HI>William:</HI> the sisters enjoy the honourable title of <HI>lady</HI> in the same manner. But this courtesy is not extended to the younger children of viscounts and baronets.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>KNIGHTS, ESQUIRES, and YEOMEN.</HEAD>
<P>The next class or order of persons, after the ba∣rons, are the baronets of England, so called as an inferior kind of barons, in Latin <HI>baronuli, barun∣culi,</HI> and <HI>baronetti,</HI> constituted in the room of the old vavasours, to hold a middle place between the parliamentary barons and the different orders of knights. They were created by James I. who be∣stowed this hereditary honour as an encouragement to those of his subjects who assisted in the reduction of the province of Ulster in Ireland. No person could be admitted into this order, unless he was a
<PB N="207" REF="2140"/>
gentleman by blood, of unblemished morals, and possessed a yearly revenue of one thousand pounds in lands, and the express condition of his admission was, that he should maintain thirty soldiers for three years, on the military establishment of Ire∣land. As an armorial badge of distinction, he wears in a canton of his escutcheon, a bloody hand, as the arms of Ulster. The number of baronets was at first restricted to two hundred; but now it is inlarged without limitation. The title of baronet is conferred by patent under the great seal, and de∣scends to heirs male: like other knights, he is dis∣tinguished by the appellative <HI>Sir</HI> prefixed to his christian name, in speaking and writing. He takes precedence of all other knights, except those of the Garter, and bannerets created in the field of battle. He is intitled to an honourable place in the king's army, near the royal standard; and his eldest son, by virtue of a peculiar privilege, when of age, has a right to the honour of knighthood whenever it shall be demanded. The wives of ba∣ronets are ladies, and take place before the wives of all knights whatsoever.</P>
<P>Exclusive of baronets, there are three orders of knighthood in Great Britain, namely, those of the <HI>Gar er,</HI> the <HI>Thistle,</HI> and the <HI>Bath.</HI> The order of St. George, or the Garter, is one of the most antient and honourable institutions of lay knights, now ex∣tant. It was founded by king Edward III. that warlike monarch, who held the kings of France and Scotland prisoners at one time in England. The order of the Garter is a college or corporation, consisting of the sovereign and twenty-five com∣panions, called knights of the Garter; of a dean, canons, petit canons, vergers, and other inferior officers, and of twenty-six poor knights, who re∣ceive their maintenance from the college as a re∣ward for military service, and in consideration of
<PB N="208" REF="2150"/>
the prayers they put up for the sovereign and the twenty-five companions. The intention of this charity, however, is now perverted; and this al∣lowance bestowed upon superannuated butlers and serving-men. There are other officers belonging to the order of the Garter, which is dedicated to St. George, the tutelar saint and patron of England; such as that of prelate of the Garter, annexed to the bishopric of Winchester; the chancellorship, vested in the bishop of Salisbury; and the registry, be∣longing to the dean of Windsor. There is a prin∣cipal king at arms called Garter, whose province it is to marshal the solemnities at feasts and installa∣tions: finally, the usher of the black rod, is like∣wise usher of the Garter. The seat of the order is in the castle of Windsor, consisting of the chapter∣house, the hall, and chapel of St. George. A knight of this order is distinguished by a blue gar∣ter with a gold buckle, worn on the left leg, and inscribed <HI>honi soil qui mal y pense;</HI> signifying, <HI>shame to him who puts a bad construction on this order;</HI> by an embroidered silver star on the left breast; and the picture of St. George, enamelled upon gold, and beset with diamonds, hanging at the end of a broad blue ribbon, that crosses the body from the left shoulder. The greatest monarchs of Christen∣dom have been members of this institution.</P>
<P>The order of the Bath was first instituted by king Henry IV. and took their denomination from bath∣ing on the eve of their admission. The order, which had grown obsolete, was revived by king George the First, in the year 1725, when eighteen noblemen and as many commoners were installed knights of the Bath with great ceremony at West∣minster. Their number is limited to forty-six; and they are distinguished by a star on the breast, and a broad red ribbon worn like a belt over the shoulder.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="2160"/>
The order of the Thistle we have already de∣scribed as a Scottish institution. Knights bannerets, or <HI>equites vexilliferi,</HI> never made but in the field of battle: there are none in England. Knights ba∣chelors, or <HI>equites aurati,</HI> so called from their gilt spurs, were antiently gentlemen who distinguished themselves by their valour, and the honour was in very high esteem; but the original institution be∣ing perverted, it is now conferred indiscriminately upon gownsmen, burghers, and physicians, by the king's lightly touching them on the right shoulder with a drawn sword: accordingly, the title has lost much of its former dignity.</P>
<P>All the gentlemen of England, not distinguished by nobility or knighthood, are comprehended un∣der the general denomination of esquires, or <HI>armi∣geri,</HI> the title formerly given to those among the gentry who acted as armour-bearers in war, to the prince and prime nobility. Though the right of this title is limited to persons of a certain rank, such as the sons of barons, and gentlemen whose ances∣tors have been always free and borne a coat of arms; mayors of towns, counsellors at law, bachelors of divinity, law, or physic; yet it is indiscriminately given to all those who maintain the appearance of gentlemen.</P>
<P>The highest order of plebeians are the freeholders, called yeomen, from the Saxon word <HI>gemani,</HI> which signifies <HI>common.</HI> These are the husbandmen and farmers, who hold lands and tenements inheritable by a perpetual right to them and their heirs for ever. They are numerous and wealthy, and when their substance increases to a certain proportion, they may whenever they please ascend into the rank of gentlemen. Besides these freeholders, there is a great number of copyholders, who possess lands within certain manours, by copy of court-roll be∣longing to these manours. They enjoy <HI>jus perpe∣tuum</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="2170"/>
and <HI>utile dominium,</HI> though not <HI>allodium</HI> and <HI>directum dominium;</HI> indeed, this last is vested in no person but the sovereign.</P>
<P>The next class of the people are merchants and traders, greatly and deservedly respected in Eng∣land, on account of their riches as well as their profession, which contributes so much to the wealth and power of the nation. The business of a mer∣chant is accounted so honourable in England, that the younger sons of the best families engage in commerce. Inferior to this degree is that of the tradesmen, including shopkeepers and handicrafts∣man; and the lowest members of the community, are the hired servants and day-labourers, who sub∣sist by the daily wages they receive from their em∣ployers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CUSTOMS respecting the WOMEN and CHILDREN in ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>A woman in England, as soon as married, is with all her moveables, at the will and disposition of her husband; nor can she alienate any thing without his consent: her necessary apparel is not her own property; and if she has any tenure, she holds it in <HI>capite,</HI> that is, of and by her husband, who is deemed the head or <HI>caput mulieris;</HI> nay, at the death of the husband, all the personal chattels she possesed at marriage, descend to his executor or administrator. She can make no contract without her husband's consent, nor reply without him, in matters of law. On the other hand, he must pay the debts which she has contracted; and if she should injure any person by her tongue or trespass, he will be obliged to make satisfaction. The wife enjoys many other privileges, which are not granted to them in other countries. She cannot be arrested for debt during the life of her husband. If she is
<PB N="211" REF="2180"/>
delivered of a child, though her husband has been absent from her several years; yet if he resided <HI>in∣ter quatuor maria,</HI> that is, within the island of Great Britain, he is obliged to father the child, which will succeed to his estate as if lawfully be∣gotten. If she brings forth a child begotten before marriage, by a former husband, or any other per∣son, this child being born after the last marriage, becomes the heir at law to the husband, though he is not the natural father. The wife, having no jointure settled upon her before marriage, may, at her husband's death, challenge the third part of his yearly rents in land, for her life. Women are en∣nobled by descent as well as by creation. They are, in the eye of the law, peers of the realm, tried as such by their peers, and though they do not sit in parliament, enjoy all the privileges attached to the male nobility. Noble women married to plebeians, retain their nobility; and all women married to peers, are ennobled by their marriage: but the wife's dignity cannot, like her goods and chattels, be conveyed to the husband.</P>
<P>The authority of fathers is so absolute in Eng∣land, that they may give away their unentailed es∣tates from their own children, or bequeath their fortunes to any one child, in preference to all the rest. A youth of fourteen may choose his guardian, and consent to marriage; at twenty-one he is at age to make any contract, deed, or will, and to sit in parliament. A girl at twelve is capable of giv∣ing her consent to matrimony, and that consent shall be binding: at the age of twenty-one, she may contract or alienate her lands by will or other∣wise. The eldest son commonly inherits the landed estate, and the younger children are portioned from the goods and chattels; but in Kent and some other places, the lands are by the custom of Gavel Kind, equally divided among all the sons. In
<PB N="212" REF="2190"/>
some manours, the youngest son inherits all the lands by a custom called Burrough English. If there are no sons, the estate is equally divided among the daughters; yet, in certain manours, such as that of Bray, in Berkshire, the eldest daughter succeeds, like the eldest son, to the whole inheritance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE, their PERSONS, ATTIRE, DISPOSITION, and MANNERS.</HEAD>
<P>The people of England are generally well sized, well shaped, with good features regularly disposed, fair, smooth skins, and florid complexions. Their eyes and hair commonly vary from a jet black, to a light chesnut colour; light eyes and hair seldom occur, except among the Irish and Scots who settle in England, and their descendants. The defect that most commonly appears in the persons of the English is the decayed state of their teeth, corrupted by the scurvy, which is endemial in this country. In other respects, the men are the most comely, and the women the most beautiful, that any kingdom of Europe can produce. The attire worn by fashionable people of both sexes is copied, like all other articles of luxury, from the French. The gentlemen appear in flowered and plain velvets, embroidery, and orrice: the ladies are arrayed in the most costly brocades, sattin, and silks, adorned with the finest laces, and glittering with a profusion of diamonds. The clergyman is distinguished by his gown and cassock, or a frock of dark grey cloth with plain linnen. The physician may be known by his formal air, his large tye-periwig, and sword crossing his posteriors almost at right angles. The sportsman affects the riding dress, consisting of a light frock with metal buttons, a laced hat and short bob wig, short jockey boots and buckskin
<PB N="213" REF="2200"/>
breeches. The man of business commonly wears a plain suit of superfine cloth with excellent linnen: the quaker is always overshadowed with a broad brimmed beaver uncocked, which he will not move upon any ceremony or occasion whatsoever. The tradesmen, farmers, and labourers, are decently apparrelled. In a word, the people of England, from the highest to the lowest, are remarkably neat in their attire, and even the beggars are better clad, than the mendicants of any other country; nay, it must be owned that in point of cleanliness, the English excel all the nations in Europe.</P>
<P>The manners of the English people vary in the different classes of which they are composed, ac∣cording to the difference of education and inter∣course. Persons of fashion, after having studied at the university, commonly travel for improve∣ment. They are magnificent in their dress, equi∣page, dwelling, and manner of living; generally polite, hospitable, good-natured, and charitable; but not very remarkable for their liberality to the professors of the polished arts, even to those who have exhibited proofs of excellence and ingenuity. On the reverse of their character, we likewise ob∣serve a disposition to gaming, riot, and excessive insolence of pride, and a strong propensity to con∣temptuous ridicule, diffused through the whole na∣tion, from the highest peer to the lowest chimney∣sweeper. Perhaps this is the genuine characteristic of the English people: for it strikes every fo∣reigner at his first arrival in England, and appears remarkably conspicuous in the writings of the Eng∣lish authors. This contempt seems to arise from a comparison of their own affluence with the poverty of their neighbours; and were we allowed to fix the natural criterion of the English character, we should call it <HI>bluntness:</HI> a disposition, which when inspired by sentiment and education, produces an
<PB N="214" REF="2210"/>
astonishing contempt of danger, and an admirable spirit of independence. Among the people of the middle rank, it makes its appearance in a disa∣greeable indifference, or more disagreeable free∣doms, and, with the vulgar, it often degenerates into meer brutality. An Englishman, unrefined by travel and communication, numbers among his privileges the right of speaking his sentiments on all occasions without reserve, even when incon∣sistent with the universal rules of good breeding and humanity: hence those shocking reflections and reproaches, national and personal, which have often been productive of quarrels and homicide. An Englishman, however, is not naturally cruel, but rather mild and compassionate, and though extremely irascible, easily appeased by submission. He is neither tenacious of resentment, nor ad∣dicted to revenge; but compromises differences, and forgets injuries, easier and sooner than the natives of some other countries could well ima∣gine. The rich open their purses freely to objects in distress, insomuch that no people in the world (the proportion of their numbers being considered) contribute half as much as is collected in Eng∣land for the relief of the poor; indeed, no other nation is so able to exert its charity; nor has any other people occasion to exert it so much: for the sums thus collected, are squandered away without oeconomy, or proper regulation: so that the in∣tention of the donors is defeated, and every corner of England swarms with vagabonds and beggars, although three millions sterling are said to be given annually for the maintenance of the poor. The English are naturally honest and unsuspecting, consequently liable to imposition. This general confidence in mankind, added to a redundancy of wealth, and a mercantile disposition, renders them very liberal of their purses and their credit, to
<PB N="215" REF="2220"/>
those who can amuse them with plausible schemes of turning their money to good account. The English merchants are, beyond all others, famous for their honourable dealings, as well as for their knowledge of trade and their extensive commerce. The people, in general, are masters of the diffe∣rent professions they exercise; their workmanship is neatly and elegantly finished, far above any thing of the same sort in other countries; and though they are not very remarkable for their dis∣coveries in the arts of handicraftsmen, they never fail to make improvements on the inventions of their neighbours. The English are clear of ap∣prehension, capable of intense application, and can pursue one point with perseverance, undisturbed by a variety or competition of ideas. Their con∣versation is extremely irregular, though usually sensible; sometimes dull and phlegmatic; some∣times solid, ingenious, and argumentative; some∣times sprightly, replete with wit and humour. Such variation will always be found in a people like the English, endued with sensibility, whose spirits are affected by the sudden changes of an ir∣regular climate: for the same reason, they will be as variable in their tempers, whimsical, capricious, and inconstant. The English have been always equally famed for courage and ingenuity. Their soldiers are fearless in the day of battle, and have obtained a great number of signal victories, over the most powerful and warlike nations on the con∣tinent; and their sailors are confessedly superior to all the mariners upon earth, in activity, skill, and intrepidity. The whimsical disposition of these islanders appears in very strange singulari∣ties; all of which, however, seem to countenance and encourage an universal levelling principle in favour of industry and commerce. A nobleman of the first quality and fortune may be seen in the
<PB N="216" REF="2230"/>
character and garb of a coachman, mounted upon the box, and driving his own carriage; nay, some of them have been known to drive the com∣mon stage vehicle, that conveys passengers from one place to another. The lord mayor of Lon∣don has been mistaken for one of his own porters; and nothing is more common than to see a man worth fifty thousand pounds, dining for a shilling in a common cook's shop. There is a great num∣ber of originals, whose singularities break out in every occurrence of life; in their dress and address, their way of living, their clubs, societies, courtships, marriages, wills, legacies, funerals, letters, writings, and advertisements. A nobleman thinks it no dis∣paragement to match with the lowest of the people, nor does the public revolt at the alliance, provided it be cemented with a large sum of money: persons of the first fashion have been known to marry Jews for wealth, and prostitutes for affection, without in∣curring the least censure or disgrace; and indeed every man is respected in proportion to the riches he possesseth, without the least respect or retrospect to birth or station. It is not at all unusual to see the husband, in his apron and sleeves, selling half a pound of dried figs below, while his wife keeps rout above, with all the state of a countess. An Englishman, in business, is less liable than any other to be affected by a change of fortune. The shopkeeper, even after he has accumulated an opulent fortune, proceeds in his calling, and con∣tinues to worship his poorest customer with the most obsequious address. On the other hand, the merchant, who had lived in affluence, when ruined by losses in trade, and stripped of his all by a statute of bankruptcy, humbles his mind to his circumstances, begins the world anew with re∣doubled ardour, and now bows, in his turn, to those of whom he exacted obeisance before.</P>

<HEAD>AMUSEMENTS and DIVERSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>The diversions and pastimes of the English peo∣ple may be divided into those of the town, and those of the country; and again subdivided into such as are peculiar to the higher ranks of life, such as are practised by the lower class of people, and such as are common to both. The diversions of the town are operas, ridottos, masquerades, concerts of music, and card assemblies, for persons of fashion. The pastimes of the country, peculiar to the same degree, are horse-races, stag, fox, and hare hunting. A modern horse-race is the rendez∣vous of common sharpers, who, in despite of in∣famy, have found means to mingle with the qua∣lity, and fleece them openly, by dint of conspira∣cies and fraudulent wagers. A spirit of gaming runs riot with such violence at a horse-race, that one would imagine all the spectators were actually possessed. Hunting is the sport of country gen∣tlemen; and those whom the world distinguish by the appellation of fox-hunters can attend to no other avocation. They seem to be infatuated with the diversion. Their whole lives are spent in fol∣lowing the hounds, riding, leaping, and hollow∣ing, as if they were mad, and after the chace, in carousing and riot; so that they are become as savage as the beasts they pursue. The common people have likewise their town and country pastimes, which they enjoy with great eagerness. Among these we number cock-fighting, cudgel∣ing, wrestling, duck-hunting, bowls, skittles, or nine-pins, archery, prison-bars, cricket, shovel∣board, quoits, divers games of chance, and spec∣tacles of various kinds, such as tumbling, bal∣lancing, vaulting, feats of legerdemain, bear and bull baiting, ass races, collections of wild
<PB N="218" REF="2250"/>
beasts, music, dancing, drolls, puppet-shews, and ringing bells, a Gothic diversion, which cannot be enjoyed without disturbing several parishes. But the most remarkable articles of vulgar entertain∣ment; which are now prohibited by the legislature, were boxing and prize fighting, two diversions which; among other nations, intailed the reproach of barbarity upon the English people. Nothing was more common than to see the prize-fighters wound each other with swords, until one was maimed, and the pleasure of the audience rose in proportion to the quantity of blood that flowed upon the stage. With respect to boxing, the spectators never expressed that satisfaction so warm∣ly, as when they saw one of the parties left speech∣less, insensible, covered with gore, and so disfi∣gured, that a human feature could not be distin∣guished in his countenance. This entertainment, though properly a vulgar pastime, was often honoured with the presence of persons in the first rank of life: but, as it was always the resort of thieves and pick-pockets, the parliament sup∣pressed it, together with some other places of re∣creation, which engrossed the time, and debauch∣ed the morals of the common people. There are other amusements both of town and country pur∣sued in common by people of all ranks, such as stage plays, musick meetings, tennis, fives, bil∣liards, cards, riding, sailing, rowing, swimming, angling, fowling, and coursing. But the most constant and solid enjoyment upon which the Eng∣lish value themselves in a peculiar manner, is good cheer in their clubs and festal meetings, where they eat great quantities of flesh-meat, drink large∣ly of fermented liquors, and smoak plentifully of tobacco.</P>

<PB N="219" REF="2260"/>
<HEAD>HABITATIONS, and Manner of LIVING.</HEAD>
<P>The houses, belonging to persons of fashion and fortune, are built of stone, large, magnificent, and well provided with offices. The apartments are spacious, adorned with carvings and paintings, and the furniture rich and splendid. The mid∣dling sort of people live in brick houses, roomy, convenient, well finished, and neatly furnished; every house-keeper occupying an entire tenement, detached from his neighbours, and having all ne∣cessary conveniencies within himself. The habi∣tations of the lower class are built of the same ma∣terials, though not so large and well finished; and, perhaps, several families are crowded into one house. The house-keeping of fashionable people is distinguished by a great number of servants, gay liveries, and equipages, a vast quantity of plate, a sumptuous table covered with a profusion of dishes and dainties, and a great variety of the best fla∣voured wines that France can afford. Those who maintain the middle rank, including many indi∣viduals of opulent fortunes, differ very little in their house-keeping from common tradesmen, ex∣cept perhaps in a greater shew of plate, and in a more genteel appearance of servants. A man whose yearly income may amount to five hundred pounds, and a merchant worth forty or fifty thou∣sand in effects, usually dines with his family on a joint of meat and a pudding, and drinks a few glasses of wine after his meal. All the people of England, except those that live by constant la∣bour, breakfast upon tea and bread and butter. Tea-drinking is generally repeated in the after∣noon; an article of luxury which hath descended even to cook-maids and washer-women: indeed, all domestic servants in England eat the very
<PB N="220" REF="2270"/>
same food, and drink the same liquor, that nou∣rishes their masters. In all cities, towns, and cor∣porations, the men commonly spend their even∣ing at the tavern or public house. The butcher's meat, throughout England, consisting of beef, veal, mutton, lamb, pork, and pig, is good in its kind, and generally more esteemed for its fat than its flavour. The ordinary cookery is con∣fined to simple roasting, boiling, broiling, and frying; and these culinary operations are half per∣formed: for an Englishman would rather eat his meat raw, than run any risk of losing the juices by evaporation. Though the rivers and seas abound with fish, it is seldom used by the com∣monalty, in comparison of flesh meat, which is the universal food of all ranks. Even the lowest labourer thinks he has dined ill, unless he hath eaten a slice of delicious beef or mutton. With their flesh-meat the English eat plenty of greens, steeped in melted butter, which is their general sauce to all the common eatables, whether vege∣table or animal. Their butter, it must be owned, is delicate, their cheese rich and palatable, their bread light, white, sweet, and easy of digestion, except in the metropolis, where the flour is adul∣terated by knavish bakers. Of liquors there is a great variety in England, imported from abroad, as well as manufactured in the country. The beer and ale home brewed, is generally pleasing to the eye, delightful to the palate, and, if not drank to excess, agreeable to the constitution. The duty on French wines is so high, that persons of fortune only can afford to drink them; nor are they much relished by the generality of the English people. To the product of France they prefer the wines of Spain and Portugal, which have the stronger body, though they are endued with less flavour. Even these are so sophisticated by the vintners and pub∣licans,
<PB N="221" REF="2280"/>
that there is little or no genuine wine sold by retail in the kingdom. The liquor generally drank by the middle class of people is called punch, a composition of water, lemon, or orange juice, sugar, and the spirit called rum, distilled from the refuse of the sugar canes in the British plantations: but this is also shamefully adulterated with a mix∣ture of English spirit drawn from corn. Punch is likewise made with brandy from France, and ar∣rack from the East Indies. Over and above the ale and beer made in England, the country pro∣duces great quantities of excellent cyder and perry, extracted from apples and pears; mum, mead, and wine, made from raisins. Hard-working people delight in a kind of strong beer called por∣ter, brown, clear, bitter, and wholesome; and the lowest and most profligate class of the vulgar, intoxicate themselves with the fiery spirit of ge∣nevre. There are besides a great many different cordials made with brandy or English spirit, distil∣led from a variety of ingredients. The practice of drinking is so universal in England, that an incre∣dible sum is yearly raised by the excise upon li∣quors consumed throughout the kingdom. If one may be allowed to judge from the number of clubs, fraternities, and associations, that exist in this kingdom, the English are the most sociable peo∣ple on the face of the earth. There is hardly a town, street, village, or neighbourhood, in South Britain, without a club or society, regulated by its own peculiar laws, and consisting of a president and members, who meet at stated times, either for the purposes of good fellowship, or else to con∣cert measures for their mutual security and ad∣vantage; at these conventions, they talk freely on all subjects, and not only acquire a smattering of politicks and philosophy, but also learn to speak in public without bashfulness or hesitation. A∣mong
<PB N="222" REF="2290"/>
these general societies, the principal are those of the free-masons, who have extended them∣selves into foreign countries, the Gregorians, and Antigallicans. The last of these is an association of patriots assembled to thwart and oppose the in∣terests and arms of France, the natural and inve∣terate enemy and rival of Great Britain. Other societies, of greater consequence, we shall men∣tion and describe in our account of the metro∣polis.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>Distempers arising from intemperance are rise in England, especially in the great towns; fevers of all kinds, continual, remitting, and intermitting, inflammation, malignant, and eruptive; pleuri∣sies, perepneumonies; coughs, catarrhs, diarrhoeas, dysenteries, and consumptions; gout, gravel, dropsy, jaundice, and the lues venerea. But the endemial diseases of this climate, are the scurvy, the hypochondriacy, madness; and among the fair sex, hysterics, and the fluor albus. All these seem to proceed either from a disordered perspira∣tion, occasioned by the mutability of the climate, and a relaxed habit, owing partly to the nature of the air, which is moist and frowzy, partly to a sedentary life, and partly to the immoderate prac∣tice of tea-drinking: not but that the scurvy, and the other distempers we have mentioned, as inci∣dent to the people of this country, may owe their origin, in some measure, to gross animal food and indigestion; and sometimes, they are transmitted by hereditary descent. The children of parents afflicted with the lax fibre, are subject to the king's evil, convulsions, rickets, and deformity; and grow up a race of miserable valetudinarians.</P>

<PB N="223" REF="2300"/>
<HEAD>STATE of LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>The English universities of Oxford and Cam∣bridge are seminaries renowned all over Europe, for the learning and piety of their constituents, and the great men they have produced in the world of genius and literature, insomuch, that a degree conferred by either is, in foreign countries, count∣ed more honourable than the same degree obtained in any university of Christendom. The liberal foundations of the respective colleges that compose these seminaries, have encouraged men of extraor∣dinary merit to embrace the academical life: the excellency of the institution, the wise regulations, the energy of the laws, and the vigour with which they are put in execution, within the precincts of these universities, have had such happy effects, that the utmost decorum is preserved in every college; and while the student's mind is improved with know∣ledge, his morals are, as far as human wisdom will admit, carefully and conscientiously guarded and preserved from snares and corruptions.</P>
<P>Learning of all kinds is more generally diffused in Great Britain, than in any other country we know. The clergy are famous for their profound knowledge in theological points and divinity; witness the labours of Clarke, Barrow, and Atter∣bury. The lawyers are remarkably skilled in all the branches of their profession, and plead with equal eloquence and precision. Elocution seems a natural talent among the English of all ranks, who, from the bishop to the cobler, accustom themselves to harrangue in public. At a meeting of journey∣men taylors, one may be entertained with tropes, figures, and all the flowers of rhetorick. With re∣spect to assemblies of a higher nature, some of them are distinguished by the most sublime strokes of
<PB N="224" REF="2310"/>
oratory; and many speeches are made in both houses of parliament, which would not have dis∣graced a Roman senate, at the zenith of their elo∣quence and patriotism. Medical knowledge flourishes in England, as much as in any other part of Europe. Sydenham, Friend, and Mead, will be always numbered among the best writers in physic. The physicians, exclusive of their own province, are well tinctured with other arts and sciences, in consequence of an extensive and liberal academical education. Many of this class have distinguished themselves in the world of taste and polite literature. They are generally well bred, though formal in appearance, compassionate, ge∣nerous, and humane. Being easy in circumstances, they live like men of fashion, are always considered as gentlemen, and every where respected on account of their profession. The other branches of medi∣cine are likewise cultivated in the most reputable manner. The professors of surgery and pharmacy acquire plentiful fortunes, maintain equipages and villas, keep a respectable place in the ranks of life, and are admitted into the best company. Meta∣physicks and natural philosophy are studied even by the vulgar in England. The names of Newton, Locke, and Hally, will always be remembered with admiration and esteem. Many sceptical per∣formances, equally bold and ingenious, have made their appearance in the English language; and much learning and argument have been exhausted in controversies, between deistical and orthodox writers. Foreigners have observed, that England was defective of historians: but the cause of that reproach is now removed. The task of collecting, collating, and arranging old papers and records, is but ill suited to the impatience of the English dis∣position: but, this labour being in a great measure surmounted by those who had no other merit than
<PB N="225" REF="2320"/>
industry, divers English authors have lately exhi∣bited elegant specimens of historical talents. Ma∣thematics have made a greater progress, and me∣chanical knowledge has been more usefully reduced to practice, in this, than in any other nation; wit∣ness the curious clocks, watches, carriages, mills, machines and engines of various kinds, with which the kingdom abounds. It would be need∣less to enumerate all the authors of eminence, who have done honour to this country by their writings and discoveries, in every branch of human literature. It may become necessary to observe, that this general dissemination of knowledge through all de∣grees of people, is owing to a variety of concur∣ring causes, namely, the freedom of the govern∣ment, that permits the people to speak their senti∣ments on all subjects without reserve; the liberty of the press, which allows every author to com∣municate his lucubrations to the public, without their being subjected to the inspection and castiga∣tion of a licencer; the sects and factions, that in the course of their mutual animosity and opposition, sti∣mulate them to inquire, unfold and discuss all the in∣tricacies and doubts of politics and religion; the public lectures delivered on a variety of subjects, and open to all comers for a moderate consideration, in the metropolis, as well as in other cities and towns of Great Britain; the incredible series of books, pam∣phlets, Reviews, Magazines, and news-papers, daily published; the circulating libraries, that furnish the reader with books at so much a quarter; the societies for the propagation of knowledge, and the encouragement of the arts, which have been erect∣ed in London, and different parts of the kingdom; the theatrical entertainments in the capital; the infinite number of coffee-houses, clubs, and meet∣ings in taverns and public houses, which engross great part of the time that the English people can
<PB N="226" REF="2330"/>
spare from their more important avocations, and in which they converse without restraint, freely can∣vass every topic, dispute on every argument, com∣pare thoughts and observations, and, from the colli∣sion of their debates, strike out hints that may be improved for the advantage of society; the emula∣tion that must be generated among such a number of artists and adepts, prompt them to redouble their endeavours, that they may excel one another: and finally, the wealth of individuals, that enables them to spare time and money for the enjoyment of these opportunities.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>LIBERAL ARTS. POETRY, MUSIC, PAINTING, SCULPTURE, and ARCHITECTURE.</HEAD>
<P>In such a soil, the liberal arts cannot fail to rise with some degree of beauty and vigour: for genius, though neglected by the great, is cherished by the people. In other countries, it finds encouragement and protection from the bounty of kings, and gene∣rosity of particular patrons. In England it enjoys no protection but from the laws, and no patronage but from the public. The English poets have met with uncommon applause from persons of taste in all countries, and their works have been trans∣lated into different languages. It must be owned, however, that they have generally more genius than taste, more spirit than art, more strength than beauty; and that some of their most admired pieces are replete with impurity, absurdity, and extra∣vagance. Spencer, who flourished in the sixteenth century, is still admired for his numbers, imagi∣nation, and description, manifested in his allegori∣cal poem, intituled, The Fairie Queen, written in the measure called stanza, which, together with the nature of the plan, he borrowed from the Orlando Purioso of the Italian poet Ariosto. The Paradise
<PB N="227" REF="2340"/>
Lost of Milton, though defective in its plan, tho' stiffened with foreign idioms, technical terms, and uncouth expressions, and in some places flattened with tame dialogue, exhibits such a stupendous force of genius, as amazes, confounds, and trans∣ports the reader; insomuch that it is universally ranked with the first epic poems of antiquity. Dryden takes the lead in lyric poetry: Butler stands almost alone in the province of humorous and witty doggrel: the satire and epistles of Pope as yet are unequalled: the Seasons of Thomson are replete with philosophy and poetical description; and we may be allowed to mention, The Art of preserving Health, as an excellent didactic poem. Scarce a month passes in London, without giving birth to some poetical performance, which would be justly applauded and admired in any other civilized coun∣try where these essays are not so common: but in England, at present, very little attention is paid to any sort of modern poetry but that which belongs to the drama. Divers new tragedies have met with uncommon success; and fresh pieces of this kind are every year produced; but very few comedies have lately appeared: a circumstance the more re∣markable, as the nation abounds with original characters, and the people are so disposed to ridi∣cule. The humour of modern writers seldom dis∣plays itself, except in ballads, satires, farce, or a kind of romance, which is peculiar to this country, re∣presenting the characters of common life as they are supposed to occur in the adventures of some particular person; a species of writing, which, if well executed, is equally instructive and entertain∣ing. With respect to dramatic pieces, the Eng∣lish people seem to be satisfied with the stock be∣queathed to them by the authors of the last century, whom they admire with a kind of infatuated vene∣ration. Their most approved performances are
<PB N="228" REF="2350"/>
unequal, irregular, and in many places absurd; yet even these absurdities are hallowed by the voice of the public; and a sensible foreigner, who has heard of the genius, taste, and erudition so conspicuous in the island, will, no doubt, be surprised when we affirm, that there is hardly one regular tragedy or comedy of any reputation exhibited on the Eng∣lish stage. Their favourite writers have made amends for the want of regularity, by the amazing force of their genius, their fire, character, passion, poetry, incident, wit, and humour; in which par∣ticulars they stand unrivalled by the dramatic au∣thors of any other country. Shakespear and Ot∣way maintain the first places in tragedy; while Johnson, Wycherly, Congreve, and Vanburgh, are esteemed the best of their comic writers. The English stage is as elegant and well conducted as any theatre in Europe, whether we consider the musick, the actors, or the decorations. There is a complete band at each theatre, consisting of able performers. The actors are in general decent, sen∣sible, and masters of the different parts they repre∣sent. Some of both sexes are excellent, both in tragedy and comedy: one or two are admired as prodigies in the art of acting. Many motives con∣cur to stimulate their endeavours. Their salaries are very large; and, far from being stigmatized with the mark of reprobation, as in other countries, they are esteemed by the public, and caressed by the best company, provided they preserve their morals un∣tainted. The income of a favourite player com∣monly exceeds one thousand pounds yearly. They keep their equipages and assemblies, appear in rich attire, and live in ease and affluence. The enter∣tainment of the English theatre consists of a pre∣lude of music, a play, whether tragedy or comedy, with music and dancing between the acts, and is concluded with a petite piece, either farce or pan∣tomime;
<PB N="229" REF="2360"/>
this last exhibited in a variety of sur∣prising scenes, supposed to be the effects of sorcery wrought in favour of Harlequin and his mistress Columbine. The dresses of the English stage are rich, splendid, elegant, and well contrived: the scenes are finely painted, and the machinery is astonishing.</P>
<P>The people of England are extremely fond of music: they are generally blessed with distinguish∣ing ears and agreeable voices; and delight in learning to play upon the German flute, the vio∣lin, and the harpsichord, which last instrument, together with the spinette, guitarre, and pandola, are peculiar to the ladies. There is not a club in the kingdom, without one member or more, capable of entertaining the company with a song; and every corner of the streets and allies, is occupied by a ragged syren, chanting ballads of Robin Hood and black-eyed Susan. Notwithstanding this ge∣neral turn for music there is no stile in this art which can be properly deemed English. True it is, the na∣tion has produced several men of genius, renowned for their musical compositions; but these were all formed upon the Italian taste. This is the case with many ingenious artists now living, who study and imitate the stile of Italian masters. The English qua∣lity subscribe for the maintenance of an Italian opera, and by extravagant appointments allure the best voices and musicians in Europe. This enter∣tainment, set apart for fashionable people, is very perfect in its kind; and here the most celebrated operas are performed with incredible excellence of execution, as well as with great magnificence of dress and decoration, interspersed with high dancing by the first performers in Europe. Be∣sides the opera, there is a surprising number of public and private concerts maintained in the me∣tropolis, as well as in other cities and towns of Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="2370"/>
England affords a great variety of geniuses in all the liberal arts, except in the sublime parts of painting. Portraits, it must be owned, are tole∣rably executed, and drawing is well understood: but the spirit of invention, the grand composition, the enthusiasm of the art, seem wanting in this climate: not but that it affords some instances of surprising genius in other branches. In the comic scenes of painting, Hogarth is an inimitable ori∣ginal with respect to invention, humour, and ex∣pression: there are several able artists who succeed in conversation-pieces, landscapes, flower-pieces, still-life designs for frontispieces, ornamental por∣celain; and many delicate morçeaus in miniature, are daily produced.</P>
<P>Sculpture of late seems to be encouraged and improved in England. French statuaries had im∣ported into the kingdom the false fire, forced at∣titudes, bombastic compositions, so peculiar to their countrymen; but some other artists, who repaired to Italy for improvement, have, from that native country of the arts, brought over a true taste for the elegant simplicity of the antients. In the article of sculpture, we include the art of engraving, which is here prosecuted with uncom∣mon success, by a considerable number of emi∣nent hands, some of which are not excelled by any artists on the continent.</P>
<P>The great number of palaces and public build∣ings, that appear in every part of England, pro∣claim a general taste for architecture; and the works of Inigo Jones, and Sir Christopher Wren, are undoubted proofs of extraordinary genius, which, however, does not seem to be inherited by the present generation of English architects, who are much more noted for the solidity than the elegance of their plans and productions: yet some few rising artists bid fair for vindicating
<PB N="231" REF="2380"/>
the public taste from the imputation of clumsiness and Gothic gloom. The mechanical arts and ma∣nufactures prosecuted in England, we shall have occasion to describe when we particularize the dif∣ferent cities and districts of the kingdom.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOCIETIES for PROPAGATING KNOWLEDGE.</HEAD>
<P>One of the first, and most honourable institutions of this kind, is the Royal Society, consisting of a president, council, and fellows, incorporated by letters-patent of king Charles II. and vested with divers privileges and immunities, for the purpose of cultivating and improving natural knowledge. The president, treasurer, and secretaries, are chosen, and the council is renewed every year: they are governed by a body of statutes; and they hold weekly meetings to make experiments, discourse on different subjects of natural philosophy, read papers, receive letters, and answer corres∣pondents. In a word, it is a most excellent insti∣tution, rendered famous by many illustrious mem∣bers, whose labours have reflected light upon the whole circle of natural philosophy, and great ho∣nour on the nations which gave them birth. Emi∣nent naturalists, mathematicians, astronomers, and mechanics, as well as the lovers of learning of all ranks, in many different countries, have been proud to see themselves enrolled as members of the Royal Society; and every country in Europe has been enriched with knowledge gleaned from their transactions, which are yearly published for the benefit of mankind. An institution of this kind, which comprehends the whole circle of li∣terature, and embraces the artists and learned of all countries, without distinction of religion or politicks, cannot fail to produce many discoveries
<PB N="232" REF="2390"/>
and improvements that must redound to the ad∣vantage of the community. Nevertheless, it must be owned, that of late years persons of very lit∣tle merit or erudition have insinuated themselves into this society. The members seem to have degenerated in their studies; and some of the modern transactions have intailed ridicule and con∣tempt upon the whole body. The design of the institution would certainly be prosecuted with bet∣ter success, were they endowed with a fund to be∣stow premiums on those who should distinguish themselves in the different branches of philosophy and mechanics.</P>
<P>This defect in the Royal Society is, in some measure, compensated, by a private society esta∣blished by public-spirited persons of all ranks, for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and commerce, in bestowing rewards, from time to time, on those who shall produce inventions and improvements that may tend to the increase of trade, the employment of the poor, and the pro∣pagation of industry, in this kingdom. Several improvements in arts and mechanics have already been offered to this society; and the authors of them have enjoyed the reward of their ingenuity, either in premiums of money, or honorary medals. As the society seems to be conducted with spirit and discretion, it will prosper in all probability, and, by the accession of new funds, be enabled to extend its plan, and multiply its bounties.</P>
<P>The study of antiquities has also associated a certain number of curious individuals, under the name of the Society of Antiquarians, who investi∣gate old manuscripts, coins, gems, busts, statues, and monuments; and have made considerable pro∣gress in this kind of inquiry; though many of their conjectures are ridiculously extravagant.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="2400"/>
The painters, statuaries, and engravers of Lon∣don, have formed a private academy, in which they practise drawing from naked living figures; and this opportunity has been productive of con∣siderable improvement in those several arts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A charter has been lately obtained for incorporating the professors of painting, sculpture, engraving, and architecture.</NOTE>. As for the college of physicians, Gresham college, and some other learned societies established in London, we shall have occasion to describe them in our ac∣count of that metropolis.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The trade of Great Britain is immense, extended over the face of the whole earth, and the profits of it are so great, as to enable the nation to make in∣credible efforts of power and influence. It must be owned that no other part of the world is so well adapted to trade, whether we consider its situation or constitution; and the inhabitants are better than any other people on earth, qualified to avail them∣selves of these advantages. The English merchants traffic largely with Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Hamburgh, Bremen, both sides of the Baltic, all the northern parts of Germany, Holland, Flanders, Portugal, Sicily, Italy, the Levant, the coast of Africa, the East and West Indies. The trade to Spain was formerly very considerable, though now impaired; and although an open com∣merce with France is discouraged by severe im∣posts, that kingdom receives considerable sums yearly, from the British dominions, in exchange for its wines, brandy, and the laces, silks, stuffs, and other commodities which are smuggled into Eng∣land, Scotland, and Ireland. The commodities exported from England are comprehended in the different articles of corn, cattle, ship provision, of
<PB N="234" REF="2410"/>
butter, cheese, beef, pork, and biscuit, iron, lead, tin, copper, manufactured and unmanufactured, leather, copperas, allum, pit-coal, saffron, hops, flax, hats, shoes, herrings, pilchards, cod, salmon, oysters, liquorice, watches, ribbons, toys; and all the different manufactures of wool, such as broad cloths, bays, kersies, rushes, serges, says, frizes, stuffs, flannels, rugs, caps, and stockings. The products of wool are the principal articles of the English traffic, the exports of them exceeding two millions yearly. The fishery is very considerable, and, if properly cultivated, would equal if not excel any other branch of commerce. It consists of pickled herrings, cod, ling, and tusk, from Shetland, and the Scottish coast; red herrings from Yarmouth; and pilchards from the western coast of England: besides, a considerable number of ships are annually employed in the whale fishery of Spitzbergen, thereto encouraged by a consider∣able bounty from the government. Prodigious quantities of hard-ware and houshold utensils from England are annually exported to other countries, such as cannons, mortars, bombs, guns, pistols, and swords, locks, spades, knives, scissars, razors, and other edge-tools, coppers, kettles, sauce-pans, pewter, and other houshold utensils of brass and iron: these are unequalled in workman∣ship by the handicraftsmen of other kingdoms; and the English clocks and watches are famous in every civilized part of the globe. The sea-coal, tin, lead, and allum, sold to foreign nations, produce above half a million annually at a medium. But the trade carried on with every nation, is not ad∣vantageous to England. A considerable sum of money is paid in ballance to Russia, Denmark, and Sweden, for naval stores, furs, timber, iron, and steel. The money, however, will we hope be
<PB N="235" REF="2420"/>
saved in a little time to the nation, as all these ar∣ticles may be furnished by the British colonies in America. The trade with Germany is of little consequence; and that of Holland, France, and Flanders, prejudicial to the English nation, if we except the tobacco, which is furnished by contract with the farmers of that commodity in France. The French merchants have, in a great measure, ruined the English commerce with Spain and the Levant, by underselling them in the mar∣kets of those countries. The trade to the East-Indies is monopolized by a company, who enrich themselves at the expence of the nation. The articles imported from India are chiefly superflui∣ties, and if they were not, the profits arising from the trade would not indemnify the kingdom for the expence of fleets and armies maintained by the public for the defence of the settlements be∣longing to this monopoly: but, if the truth must be owned, the company is an engine of state, supported for the purposes of government. How far it is practicable to render this commerce more advantageous to the nation, by sharing with the Dutch the spice-trade, and the traffic with Japan, is a question that may one day deserve the attention of the legislature. At present, the East-India company exports broad cloths, and other articles of the woollen manufacture, all sorts of hard ware, lead, and bullion. Their imports consists of gold, diamonds, raw silk, drugs, tea, pepper, arrack, porcelaine ware, salt-petre for home consumption; and of wrought silks, muslins, callicoes, cottons, and all the woven manufactures of India, for exportation to foreign countries. The trade with the Portugueze is very beneficial to England; for they use a much greater quantity of the produce of Great Britain than their wines and their fruit will refund; and all the overplus is payed in gold.
<PB N="236" REF="2430"/>
The French, however, begin to rival the English in the markets of Portugal, which they supply with cloths at much easier rates than those de∣manded by the merchants of Great Britain. They have plenty of materials, and their labour is cheap. The trade with Spain was formerly very extensive and advantageous, and still employs a considerable number of ships; but this branch of commerce is greatly decayed. The Spaniards have set up woollen manufactures at home; they are supplied with many necessaries by France; and, since the commencement of the late war, they have turned their neutrality to the best advantage, by carrying on an active trade in their own bottoms.</P>
<P>The commerce of the English to the coast of Guinea is of great importance to the nation. They supply the negroes with cloths, cottons, checques, printed linnens, spirits, all sorts of ne∣cessaries, arms, and ammunition, the manufacture of Great Britain; in return for which, they receive slaves for the plantations, elephants teeth, gums, and gold dust. The traffic for slaves, however, is barbarous, inhuman, and a reproach to a free country. It is not to be doubted that the trade to Africa might be extended and improved to much greater advantage, without this scandalous commerce in human flesh; and it might be easily proved, that the plantations in America could be sufficiently laboured by hired servants. For the protection and convenience of the trade to Guinea, the African company has erected several castles on different parts of the coast; the govern∣ment allows an annual sum for the maintenance of these sorts; and the commerce is open to every adventurer. The Levant trade, including that of the Turkey company, and the traffic carried on in the different ports of Italy and the Archipe∣lago, though not so considerable as heretofore, is
<PB N="237" REF="2440"/>
yet prosecuted with advantage to the nation. The English commodities sent to these countries, con∣sist of woollen cloths of all kinds, hard-ware, iron utensils, clocks, watches, block tin, iron tinned, lead, fish, verdigrease, spices, cochineal, and logwood. In return for these, England re∣ceives raw silk, goats and camels hair, mohair, yarn, drugs, wine, oil, Cypress-wood, fustic, ebony, raisins, currants, figs, pomegranates, ver∣micelli, honey, wax, soap, orange-flower water, sweet-meats, cheese, velvets, cottons, and paper. But the greatest object of English commerce, is the intercourse between it and its own colonies in America. These flourishing plantations consume an infinite quantity of the British manufactures, for which the colonists pay with the produce of their own lands and industry, in the different arti∣cles of sugar, rum, tobacco, fish, timber, naval stores, lumber, iron, furs, rice, drugs, indigo, and raw silk. The possession of Cape Breton has enabled the English to engross the whole fishing trade of North America, which, if duly prosecuted, will make a yearly return to Great Britain of two millions sterling; employ a vast number of fami∣lies; serve as a nursery for seamen; and greatly extend the navigation of Old England. The con∣quest of Canada not only secures the frontiers of the British colonies from the attempts of an am∣bitious lawless neighbour; but delivers them from all competition in commerce, and opens an im∣mense field for the fur-trade, among the remote Indians of that vast and hitherto unknown country.</P>
<P>The importance of these colonies may be guessed from the following specimens. Seventy-five thou∣sand hogsheads of sugar were annually imported from the islands belonging to England, before the acquisition of the Grenades and neutral islands, which in time will make a considerable addition. Ca∣rolina
<PB N="238" REF="2450"/>
exports yearly of its own produce, seventy thousand barrels of rice, each weighing four hun∣dred pounds, five thousand barrels of pitch and tar, two thousand barrels of indigo, besides a considerable quantity of raw silk. Virginia and Maryland afford annually seventy thousand hog∣sheads of tobacco, two thirds of which are re-ex∣ported from Great Britain, to Germany, France, and Holland.</P>
<P>The legislature, conscious of the amazing ad∣vantages accruing to the nation from a well-con∣certed commerce, vigorously executed, has from time to time cherished it with the utmost attention. It hath instituted wise laws and regulations for the conduct and improvement of different manufac∣tures, as well as of foreign trade: it hath granted particular protection and encouragement to infant arts and new branches of traffic, by conferring peculiar privileges and immunities, and bestowing bounties upon those by whom they have been dis∣covered and exercised. It was with this laudable view, that exclusive charters were granted to cer∣tain companies, who undertook, at a great expence, to open and maintain some important channels of trade. Thus the East-India company was first in∣corporated in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and in a particular manner countenanced and favoured by all the successive sovereigns of Great Britain, till the reign of king William, when the parlia∣ment finding that they did not trade to a sufficient extent, or answer the purposes of their first insti∣tution, listened to the petition of another body of merchants, who were incorporated under the name of the New East-India company, and vested with all the immunities enjoyed by the old company, which by the same act was indulged with leave to continue the trade for three years longer. The fund of the new company was so considerably
<PB N="239" REF="2460"/>
swelled by subscriptions, that in less than two years they equipped forty sail of large ships for this com∣merce, and sent a million sterling in specie annu∣ally to the East-Indies. In the year 1702, the two companies, at their mutual request, were united in a new charter granted by queen Anne. This being ex∣pired, another was granted, and finally prolonged by the late king, till the year 1780, when the company's exclusive right of trading to the East-Indies will cease and determine, provided they shall have three years notice, and receive payment of the capital stock borrowed by the government, and the annuities. There is very little reason, however, to suppose that either the government will be in a condition or inclined to repay these sums, which amount to above four millions sterling. Those who may be intrusted with the management of af∣fairs, will always know how much this company depends upon the government, and how far this dependence may be turned to advantage; and the company are too sensible of the vast profits arising from the trade, to forfeit them unnecessarily, when a renewal of their charter may be obtained for a consideration which they can so well afford to offer. This is the most flourishing of all the trading com∣panies in England; and, indeed, one of the most wealthy and powerful in Europe, as appears by the number of ships they constantly employ, and the considerable settlements, magazines, and store∣houses which they maintain at home and abroad. All persons without exception, whether foreigners or natives, men or women, are admitted as mem∣bers into this company. Every individual who pur∣chases five hundred pounds worth of the company's stock, is intitled to a vote in the general courts; and every person laying out two thousand pounds in this stock, is qualified to be chosen a director. The number of these does not exceed four and
<PB N="240" REF="2470"/>
twenty, including the chairman and deputy-chair∣man, each enjoying a yearly salary. The whole <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e elected annually. They sit at least once a-week, and are summoned occasionally. From the body of the directors divers committees are chosen to in∣spect the different branches of the company's busi∣ness; such as the committees of correspondence, of buying, of the treasury, of warehouses, of ship∣ping, of accounts, of the house, and of private trade.</P>
<P>The next monopoly that claims our attention, is the South-sea company, if that may be called a monopoly which carries on no sort of traffic but stock-jobbing. This company originally consist∣ed of the public creditors possessed of navy-bills, tickets, and debentures, undischarged. By an act of parliament in the reign of queen Anne, they were formed into a joint stock company, and cor∣poration, vested with an exclusive right to open and carry on a trade to South-America, from the river Oroonoko to Cape-Horn, on the Terra del Fuego, and through the South-sea, to the most northern part of America. The queen afterwards transferred to them the benefit of the Assiento con∣tract with Spain, by which they engaged to sup∣ply the Spaniards with slaves for their mines and plantations in America; and enjoyed the privilege of sending a large ship annually, laden with Euro∣pean commodities, to the Spanish West Indies. They were also bound by their charter to promote the British fishery, and actually sent a few ships to Greenland, without either oeconomy or success. They, for some time indeed, furnished the Spa∣niards with negroes, and sent the annual ship, which was productive of great mischief to the trade of England: but they never dreamed of putting in execution the principal part of the design, which was a commerce to South America;
<PB N="241" REF="2480"/>
a commerce which could not have been maintained without producing an open rupture between Eng∣land and Spain, and giving umbrage to all the trading powers of Europe. The debt due by the public to the navy and army, converted into the capital stock of this company, amounted to above nine millions sterling; and the parliament imposed certain duties for paying an interest of six per cent. for this capital, which by an act in the reign of George I. was increased to ten millions; and then they agreed to accept an interest of five per cent. from the government. In the sequel, such an ad∣ditional number of public debts were subscribed into their stocks, that their capital increased to three and thirty millions and upwards, for which they agreed to take of the government an interest of five per cent. until Midsummer of the year 1727, and from that date to be contented with four per cent. By this reduction of interest, the nation saved an overplus, which obtained the name of the Sinking-fund; a saving, which had it been properly managed, and honestly applied, would in little more than forty years have discharged the whole debt of the nation, without the necessity of laying new burthens upon the subject. In conse∣quence of this last contract with the government, the company was enabled by an act of parliament to take in money subscriptions, and vested with other privileges, which seemed to promise great advantages. It is not our province to explain the South-sea scheme, projected by Sir John Blunt, one of the directors; or to relate the artifices that were used to inflame the avarice of the public, the frantic eagerness of the people after subscrip∣tions, the protentous rise of the stock, the sudden bursting of the delusive bubble, the ferment of the nation, the interposition of parliament, the punish∣ment inflicted on the directors and accomplices
<PB N="242" REF="2490"/>
in that iniquitous transaction, and the restoration of public credit, whereby the South-sea company has been enabled to execute its contract with the government. Suffice it to say, that by a treaty signed at Madrid, in the year 1750, between their Britannie and Catholic majesties, the South-sea company gives up all claim to the Assiento contract, and annual ship, which had long been interrupted by wars and disputes between the two crowns; and in lieu of all claims on Spain, of this, or any other nature, accepts the sum of one hundred housand pounds sterling, to be paid either in Madrid or London, within the term of three months, to be reckoned from the day on which the treaty was signed. At present, the company seems to have forgot the original design of their institution. The proprietors content themselves with the revenues arising from the funds settled upon them by act of parliament; and some of the most wealthy among them find means to increase their fortunes considerably by the practice of stock∣jobbing.</P>
<P>The Turkey company was by letters-patent of king James I. erected into a body-corpo∣rate, by the name of the governor and company of merchants of England, trading to the Levant∣seas; but notwithstanding the privileges granted to this association, it never was intended as a mo∣nopoly: for all subjects of England, being mer∣chants, had a right, upon paying a slight fine, to be admitted into the company, and enjoy the be∣nefit of the trade. The company, however, hav∣ing the power of making bye-laws for the good rule and government of the members of this fel∣lowship, laid many restrictions, to the hindrance of commerce, and, in particular, a penalty of twenty per cent, upon all the merchandize sent to Turkey, at any other times, or in any other ships, than
<PB N="243" REF="2500"/>
those appointed by the company; so that in time it became a mere monopoly. It maintains the king's ambassador at Constantinople, as well as consuls and factors at all the trading towns in Turkey; and hath at different times obtained va∣luable privileges, by capitulations, with the Ot∣toman emperor: but the trade hath continued to decrease for many years. The company imputed this decay to the success of the woollen manufac∣ture in France, which produces cloths made of Spanish wool, though not so substantial as those of England, yet more soft, light, better dyed, and cheaper, consequently more saleable in the Turkish markets. On the other hand, the English manu∣facturers affirm, that they could produce cloths of the same texture, colours, and cheapness, pro∣vided they were allowed to export them in their own bottoms, at their own times, and from every port without distinction: but that they were so hampered by the regulations and bye-laws of the company, and subjected to such extraordinary ex∣pence in carriage to London, package, brokerage, and ware-house room, besides the charge of dying them in the capital, where labour and materials are so dear, that it could not be expected they should be able to sell them cheap at a foreign mar∣ket. The legislature taking these things into con∣sideration, by a law enacted in the year 1754, laid the Turkey and Levant trade open to every sepa∣rate adventurer, who should pay a small fine to the company for admission, and take an oath to be obedient and assistant to the company's governor, deputy-governor, and assistants, in all lawful mat∣ters. Whether this indulgence will have the de∣sired effect in retrieving this commerce to the na∣tion, time will soon discover. The ruin of the French shipping, by the naval power of England, will doubtless contribute to this event.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="2510"/>
The Russian company, first established by charter in the reign of Philip and Mary, was after∣wards confirmed by queen Elizabeth, with exclu∣sive privileges, which are now, in many respects, obsolete. It reserves, however, such authority, as excludes all foreigners, except Russians, from a participation in this commerce. But the trade is open to every natural-born protestant subject of Great Britain, upon his paying five pounds for ad∣mission as a freeman of the company. This being obtained, he may equip ships, and settle a house in Russia on his own private account, subject to a small tax, which the company levies on extraordi∣nary occasions, for the relief of poor seamen, and the widows of deceased mariners.</P>
<P>The British factory settled at Hamburgh, incor∣porated into a company, consisting of a governor, deputy-governor, and thirty members, once en∣joyed an exclusive privilege of importing cloth into that city; but now this privilege is extended to all the inhabitants. The factory, however, is greatly respected by the Hamburghers: all disputes among themselves are decided by a majority of voices: they likewise judge in differences between them and the inhabitants of the city; but in those cases they act in concert, with a deputation of two se∣nators.</P>
<P>The royal African company was likewise an in∣corporated monopoly, erected in the reign of Charles II. vested with an exclusive right to trade on the coast of Guinea, where they built and main∣tained a number of forts and settlements. In the year 1697, the parliament laid the trade to Africa open to all subjects of England, imposing a duty of ten per cent. ad valorem, on all merchandize exported to that coast, for the term of thirteen years, to be paid to the company, in consideration of their maintaining such a number of forts and
<PB N="245" REF="2520"/>
castles. At the expiration of this term, all the sub∣jects of England were at liberty to trade without opposition; and the company grew tired of the expence they yearly incurred by supporting the castles. Notwithstanding the sums of money which they received from parliament for a series of years, to enable them to maintain these forts, they allow∣ed them to fall into decay, and their officers, in∣stead of protecting, insulted and oppressed the se∣parate trader: at the same time it appeared, that the directors had enriched themselves, while the stock was bankrupt. On these, and other consi∣derations, the parliament in the year 1751, grant∣ed a sum of money for making compensation to the old company for their charter, lands, forts, castles, slaves, military stores, and all their other effects, and vested them in a new company of mer∣chants trading to Africa. All the government and regulations of this commerce are planned by a com∣mittee, which constantly sits at London under the inspection of the board of trade. All British sub∣jects may now traffic to the coast of Guinea, with∣out restriction; and the parliament allows ten thou∣sand pounds per annum for the support of the castles.</P>
<P>One of the most profitable branches of the Eng∣lish commerce, is that carried on by the Hudson's Bay company, erected in the reign of Charles II. with an exclusive privilege of trading in that part of North America bordering on Hudson's Bay, where they have erected divers forts and settlements on the sides of navigable rivers. There they trade with the wild Indians, exchanging gun powder, shot, cloth, hatchets, kettles, tobacco, and Eng∣lish spirits, for the furs of beavers, martens, moose∣deer, and foxes. This trade might be extended so as to employ a considerable number of ships yearly, consume a great quantity of English manufactures,
<PB N="246" REF="2530"/>
and make valuable returns: but the company do not equip above four ships annually for this traffic, con∣tenting themselves with the immense profits they draw from these cargoes, which are said to fetch above two thousand per cent. The legislature hath more than once expressed an inclination to extend this com∣merce; but the company have as often found means to stifle all parliamentary inquiry, which is now, indeed, the less necessary, as the conquest of Ca∣nada will diffuse the fur trade through a great many different channels.</P>
<P>Of late years, the legislature of England has been more than usually attentive to the commercial in∣terests of Great Britain. It permitted pig and bar iron to be imported from the British colonies in North-America, and encouraged the growth of silk in the British plantations; it granted a large bounty of forty shillings per ton on every ship that should be fitted out for the whale fishing; delivered the trade to the coast of Africa from all obstruc∣tions and oppressions; and gave rise to the society of the free British fishery, which, had it been pro∣perly conducted, would have proved an inexhausti∣ble source of wealth, and a perpetual nursery of seamen to the nation. In the mean time it is to be lamented, that an institution so well calculated for the emolument of the public, has not yet been at∣tended with the happy consequences that might be expected. The miscarriage is probably owing to a defect in the oeconomy of the directors, unskil∣fulness in those who take and cure the fish, which without all doubt are inferior to the very same species pickled by the Dutch adventurers; and lastly, to a want of a proper national spirit, to for∣ward and encourage the undertaking. To these concurring causes, we may add the necessities of the late war, in consequence of which, great numbers of fishermen and labourers have been pressed into
<PB N="247" REF="2540"/>
the service of the public. This branch of com∣merce, which has been stiled the British gold mine, and is now almost engrossed by the subjects of the United Provinces, we have more fully described in our account of Shetland.</P>
<P>The whole commerce of Great-Britain and her dominions employs above eight thousand sail of ships; and half the trade of Britain centers in the port of London. There are above eight hundred large ships equipped for the coal trade only; and those vessels employed in coasting, are computed at two thousand.</P>
<P>The spirit of trade and adventure appears in every shape among the English people, and many different expedients are contrived for the extension and security of commerce. Perhaps the most effec∣tual of these is the practice of insuring, by which every merchant can for a premium of so much per cent. secure his adventure, or any part of it, from the risque of seas and enemies. This of itself is be∣come a traffic among the traders, who, for a certain pecuniary consideration paid in hand, underwrite, or insure the merchandize of one another, on cer∣tain terms specified in a set form on stamped paper, which is called the policy of assurance. When a merchant is disposed to ensure the whole, or any part of a cargo, he employs a broker, who, in a printed policy of insurance, specifies the name of the ship in which the cargo is embarked, the voyage upon which she is bound, the value of the mer∣chandize, and the conditions of insurance. This he presents to different merchants who are willing to underwrite, and they subscribe their names for different sums, as they think proper, until the whole value is subscribed, receiving in the mean time the premium, each in proportion to the sum he has under-written: if the ship is cast away, or taken by the enemy, so that the cargo is lost, the
<PB N="248" REF="2550"/>
proprietor has recourse upon the insurers, who are obliged to indemnify him, by paying the different sums to which they subscribed. The policies of those private under-writers are duly entered and registered in private offices of insurance, as testimo∣nies of under vouchers for the transaction. Besides these private offices, there are in the city of Lon∣don two corporations for this purpose, established by act of parliament, one intituled, The Royal Ex∣change Assurance, and the other, The London Assurance. They obtained the sanction of the legislature in the year 1720, in consideration of their paying six hundred thousand pounds to the ministry, towards discharging the arrears of the civil list. They are impowered to choose governors, buy lands, borrow money, and have each an ex∣clusive privilege against all other insuring societies for shipping and merchandize; but this does not interfere with any private man's right of insuring. London is moreover provided with other offices, for assuring houses and effects from fire, and sums of money upon lives. In a word, there are per∣sons in England who will insure property from all accidents whatsoever: they will insure imaginary value upon any sort of contingency, and even ex∣tend their assurance to the ships of the enemy; a practice which has been defended as a national ad∣vantage, by very specious arguments.</P>
<P>Among other circumstances that facilitate com∣merce in England, we must not forget the national bank, and the traffick of private bankers, who abound in the metropolis of Great Britain. The bank of England, instituted by a parliamentary sanc∣tion in the reign of king William III. is founded on a transferable fund, and deals by paper circula∣tion on the credit of a large capital. The pretext for erecting a national bank, in imitation of other trading countries, was to extend and facilitate com∣merce
<PB N="249" REF="2560"/>
by augmenting the circulation. It was ex∣tolled as an expedient that would lower interest, raise the value of land, revive and establish public credit, facilitate the annual supplies, and strengthen the hands of the government. Certain it is, a na∣tional bank is attended with some advantages to trade, because by issuing notes or bills to the amount of their capital, that sum is doubled in circulation, and diffused through the kingdom for the conve∣nience of traders. Indeed, in trading countries, where there is a scarcity of gold and silver, such an institution becomes absolutely necessary; though, in England, it has not been altogether unattended with inconveniences. Whatever benefits may ac∣crue from it to trade in general, it must be owned, that its rise was owing to the wants of the govern∣ment, which borrowed its whole capital; that it will probably be always subservient to government views, even when they may be inconsistent with the constitution of the country; that it may tempt in∣dividuals to withdraw their money from trade, and employ it in stock-jobbing, consequently produce a swarm of brokers and jobbers, to prey upon their fellow-creatures, and encourage fraud and gaming, so as to corrupt the morals of the nation. Besides, in case of rebellion, to which this kingdom is in a peculiar manner exposed, and in times of public danger, paper circulation having no intrinsic value, must necessarily sink, if not supported by very ex∣traordinary means: then the public credit will fail, and the whole nation be involved in bankruptcy and confusion. At present, however, the bank of England is the most respectable money-corporation in Europe. It flourishes in wealth and credit, and its notes not only circulate through all parts of the British dominions, but are esteemed as good as bullion in Holland, Hamburgh, and many other states on the continent. The private bankers are
<PB N="250" REF="2570"/>
beneficial to trade, by keeping large quantities of cash for answering draughts upon sight, part of which they lend occasionally to merchants, upon proper security, thus enabling them to be punctual in their payments, even when they are disappointed in returns of money. Nothing evinces the wealth and commercial genius of this nation so much as the ease and dispatch with which payments of pro∣digious sums, and contracts of great importance, are made and transacted in the city of London.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DUTIES, TAXES, PUBLIC DEBTS, FUNDS, MONEY.</HEAD>
<P>Although the English legislature hath cherished the national trade with one hand, it hath likewise burthened it gradually with the other, to such a degree, that no other nation on the face of the earth was ever loaded with such taxes and impo∣sitions; and no people could possibly bear such impositions, unless they were enabled to bear them by a peculiar genius for prosecuting commerce, and such a torrent of trade as almost exceeds belief. The immensity of the traffic may be judged from the yearly revenues of Great Britain, exclusive of the civil list, amounting to eight hundred thousand pounds sterling per annum.</P>
<P>The constant, and we may say, the perpetual impositions established for the public revenue, are the land-tax, the customs or duties upon merchan∣dize, the excise, the stamp-duties, and the taxes upon windows, carriages, hawkers, and pedlars. The sum total, raised by these impositions, amounts to very near ten millions per annum: what the exigencies of state require over and above this exaction, is borrowed on the public credit, add∣ed to the public debts, and some new tax is laid
<PB N="251" REF="2580"/>
and mortgaged as a security for payment of the interest.</P>
<P>It will appear strange to foreigners, that a nation so opulent as Great Britain, so divided and de∣tached from other countries, so secured by its in∣sular situation, and so little subject to the expence of great armies and numerous fortifications, should, nevertheless, be obliged to contract debts yearly, in order to defray the public expence: this circum∣stance will appear still more strange, when they consider the heavy impositions with which the peo∣ple are incumbered, and the vast sums which these impositions annually produce: but their astonish∣ment will cease, when they reflect upon the diffe∣rent connexions by which this island has been these fifty years chained to the continent; the wretched policy of successive administrations, which have espoused and adopted almost every continental quar∣rel, and with enormous subsidies hired foreign princes to fight their own battles; and, finally, the system of corruption that certain ministers had established, in consequence of which they fleeced the people with one hand, that they might bribe their representatives with the other. These mea∣sures, prosecuted for a series of years, have multi∣plied the occasions of the government, and laid it under the necessity, from time to time, to con∣tract debts on the public credit, that is, to borrow sums on the faith of the parliament. These debts amount already to the incredible sum of one hun∣dred and thirty millions sterling.</P>
<P>Great part of this debt is owing to the three great companies of the East Indies, Bank, and South-sea, incorporated in their capitals, made transferable, by act of parliament; and the interest is regularly paid from the produce of the funds granted and appropriated for that purpose. These
<PB N="252" REF="2590"/>
debts are called the stocks, because converted into the stock of the respective companies; and the name of funds is given to the taxes mortgaged and assigned for the payment of this interest. Any in∣dividual, whether native or foreigner, possessed of money which he cannot employ to better advan∣tage, may lay it out in the purchase of stock, with the bank, or either of the other companies, so as to enjoy a certain interest; and when he has occa∣sion to use the money in another way, he may sell his stock at the market-price. The property of the stocks is divided into such an infinite number of hands, and the occasions for ready money are so frequent, that there is a constant circulation of stock, consequently a daily market for buying and selling. The transfer of stock is made with sur∣prising ease and expedition by sworn brokers, em∣ployed for that purpose; and the price is neces∣sarily fluctuating, according to the change and vi∣cissitude of those affairs in which the state is sup∣posed to have any, even the smallest concern. The rumour of an expedition intended against any part of the British dominions, or the report of an arma∣ment abroad, though the destination of it is not known, will immediately sink the price of stock in Exchange-alley, where this traffic is generally carried on; and, on the other hand, it is often raised by a petty advantage gained in the field by some distant ally of Great Britain. The stocks will, undoubtedly, always be influenced by every thing that affects the fears, hopes, and passions of the proprietors, so far as they respect the situation of public concerns. Public credit depends, in a great measure, on the supposed stability of the established government: every incident that proves unfavourable to the government will, therefore, have more or less effect upon public credit, which
<PB N="253" REF="2600"/>
is the foundation of the stocks, and the security of the proprietors: in that case, timorous people will endeavour to make sure of their own private for∣tunes, by selling their stock; and rather than run any risque of losing the whole, they will offer and sell it at an under price: when the demand is small, and the commodity abounds, the market must fall of course. After the price of stocks has been thus reduced, when the public is regaled with happy tidings of a battle gained, or a conquest made, or an advantageous alliance concluded by Great Bri∣tain, or her allies, the government seems again founded on a rock, the public credit flourishes: those who sold out their stock from apprehension, now hasten to the alley in order to make new pur∣chases: the demand is great, and the price of stock rises in proportion. Thus it must continue to shift incessantly with the humours and passions of man∣kind; and there is always a set of crafty knaves upon the watch, to turn these to their own advan∣tage. Some there are who hire emissaries to spread false reports, that may influence the public credit either way, according as they are disposed to buy or to sell. When they want to sell, the market is previously raised by good news, and an eager de∣mand in the alley: on the other hand, when their intention is to buy, they can before-hand depreciate the stock by means of evil tidings, and woful faces, offering to transfer; then they purchase at an un∣der price. Some who deal deeply in this traffic, are at a considerable expence in procuring intelligence, that they may have the start of their brethren. In the year 1715, when an army of rebels had taken possession of Preston, in Lancashire, and a body of forces was detached to dislodge them, a certain per∣son, well known in the world of adventure, pro∣vided relays of horses, and a trusty messenger to
<PB N="254" REF="2610"/>
bring him the most early notice of the battle; and he was accordingly the first person in London who knew of the victory which the king's forces had obtained. The price of stocks had continued to sink from the first breaking out of the rebellion, and was at this period very low. The gentleman having a great sum of ready money at his com∣mand, no sooner received the intelligence, than he laid it out in the purchase of stock, and the price rising immediately when the news of the victory ar∣rived in the usual way, he became a very consi∣derable gainer. The practice of transferring stock gave rise to the infamous traffic of stock-jobbing, which comprehended fictitious contracts, wagers, and the conveyance of imaginary property: but these iniquitous proceedings are now prohibited by law, under severe penalties.</P>
<P>The trade and manufactures of Great Britain are so various and extensive, that, exclusive of paper circulation, they cannot be carried on without a very great quantity of current coin, in gold, silver, and copper. What the total amount of the circulating cash in England may be, is not easily ascertained: some have computed it at sixteen millions sterling; but as great part of what has been coined is melted down, worn out, exported, lost, or hoarded up, and, as in the course of circulation, the cash changes hands with such rapidity, we know not the princi∣ples on which this calculation is founded.</P>
<P>The gold coin of England consists of guineas, half-guineas, and quarter-guineas, tho' the people reckon by pounds, which at present is an imaginary denomi∣nation; the pound is equal to twenty shillings, and the guinea amounts to one and twenty: but be∣sides the English pieces, the gold coin of Portugal, called Joannes and moidore, are taken in tale by all the dealers of England. Crowns, half-crowns,
<PB N="255" REF="2620"/>
shillings, and sixpences, compose the silver coin that circulates through Great Britain and Ireland: and for the convenience of retail, there is an im∣mense quantity of halfpence and farthings. It may be superfluous to observe, that one crown consists of five shillings; that one shilling is composed of twelve pence; and that four farthings constitute one penny: no person, however, is obliged to re∣ceive copper money in payment of any money that exceeds one shilling. The pound, or twelve ounces Troy weight of gold, is divided at the mint into four and forty guineas and an half: one ounce of gold is worth fourteen ounces and one third of an ounce, in silver; so that the proportion of gold to silver, in England, is as one to fourteen and one third. Over and above the coins we have men∣tioned, there are some five guinea and two guinea pieces of gold; as well as groats, three penny, two penny, and penny pieces in silver; but these are rather kept as medals, than used in circulation.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMPUTATION, WEIGHTS, and MEASURES.</HEAD>
<P>When the English nation shook off the pope's su∣premacy, they rejected the Gregorian kalendar, as a part of popery, and had recourse to the Julian ac∣count, called <HI>the old stile,</HI> which they observed from that period till the year 1751, when it was abro∣gated by act of parliament, in favour of the Gre∣gorian, which is now adopted in all their months, terms, and fixed festivals. The English traders in numbering cod fish, ling, and haberdine, reckon one hundred and twenty-four to the hundred; and of herrings one hundred and twenty; twelve hun∣dred are given to the thousand, which constitute a barrel; and twelve barrels make one last. In count∣ing furs, they reckon by the timber, which con∣sists
<PB N="256" REF="2630"/>
of forty skins: but of other skins five score only are allowed to the hundred. Twenty-four sheets of paper make a quire; twenty quire consti∣tute a ream; and ten ream compose a bale. Twelve skins of parchment make a dozen, and five dozen a roll. Ten hides are a dicker; and twenty dick∣ers make a last; but there are ten pair of gloves in one dicker.</P>
<P>Of weights there are two sorts used in England; namely Troy weight, and Averdupois: to reckon by the first, twenty-four grains of wheat make one penny-weight sterling; twenty penny-weights make one ounce; and twelve ounces constitute a pound. By this they weigh bread, corn, gold, silver, jewels, and liquors. But all other articles, such as mercery and grocery ware, metals, wood, and tallow, are computed by averdupois, in which sixteen drachms make an ounce; sixteen ounces a pound; twenty∣eight pounds a quarter; four quarters a hundred; and twenty hundred a ton.</P>
<P>The English measures consist of the inch, foot, yard, fathom, perch or pole, furlong, and mile. An inch is equal to three barley corns; twelve inches make one foot; three feet are equal to one yard; two yards make one fathom; sixteen feet and an half constitute one perch, pole, or rood; forty poles make a furlong; and eight furlongs make an English mile, amounting to seventeen hundred and sixty yards, according to act of par∣liament. An English acre consists of forty perches in length, and four in breadth; and an hundred acres are accounted a hide of land.</P>
<P>There are also receptive measures both for li∣quids and solids. The smallest measure for liquids, is called a pint; two pints make a quart; two quarts make a pottle; two pottles make a gallon; eight gallons a firkin; two firkins a kilderkin; two kilderkins a barrel; and twelve barrels a last
<PB N="257" REF="2640"/>
of ale: but in reckoning beer, nine gallons are al∣lowed to the firkin; two firkins to the kilderkin; two kilderkins to the barrel; one barrel and a half to a hogshead; two hogsheads to a pipe or butt, and two pipes to a tun. The wine measures are smaller than those of ale and beer, nearly in the proportion of four to five; four gallons of beer measure are almost equal to five gallons of wine. A runlet of wine holds eighteen gallons; and half a hogshead contains thirty-one gallons and an half: forty-two gallons go to the tierce; sixty-three to the hogshead; eighty-four to the puncheon; one hundred and twenty-six to the pipe; and two hun∣dred and fifty-two to the tun.</P>
<P>For measuring dry commodities, such as grain, the gallon is between the wine and ale measure, holding as much as will weigh nine pounds thir∣teen ounces twelve drachms and an half of averdu∣pois. Two of these gallons make a peck; four pecks a bushel; four bushels the comb or curnock; two curnocks a quarter, seam or ruff; and ten quarters a last: thirty-six bushels of coals constitute a chaldron.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DOMINIONS, NUMBER OF PEOPLE, ARMY, NAVY, MILITIA, and FORTIFICATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>The British dominions comprehend Great Bri∣tain and Ireland, with the islands of Shetland, Ork∣ney, Hebrides, Man, Scilly, and the lesser isles that appear around the coast; the islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney, on the coast of Normandy; the island of St. John's on Newfoundland, the whole tract of North America, from Casco bay, to the mouth of the Mississippi, with the late con∣quest of Cape Breton and Canada; the sugar islands of Jamaica, Barbadoes, Antigua, St. Christophers,
<PB N="258" REF="2650"/>
Nevis, Dominica, St. Vincent's, Tobago, and the Grenades. To these we may add the fort of Gibraltar, by which the English, in a great measure, command the Straights mouth, or passage into the Mediterranean; and the island of Minorca. But we do not reckon among the British dominions, those forts and factories which the merchants of Eng∣land have established on the coasts of Asia and Africa.</P>
<P>The number of people contained in Great Bri∣tain and Ireland, may amount to about eight mil∣lions, allowing six for England, one for Scotland, and one for Ireland: at that rate there ought to be considerably above a million of men able to carry arms; and to these, if we add the forces that may be raised occasionally in North America, the king of England will appear a very formidable po∣tentate.</P>
<P>The land-forces of Great Britain, maintained in time of peace, do not usually exceed forty thousand in number, computing eighteen thousand in Eng∣land and Scotland, twelve thousand on the Irish esta∣blishment, and the remainder in garrisons abroad, at Gibraltar, Nova-Scotia, New-York, Jamaica, and Antigua. In the late war, however, the na∣tion maintained above one hundred thousand sol∣diers, exclusive of marines, and an army of fifty thousand Germans on the continent. The British infantry have always distinguished themselves by a species of courage and intrepidity peculiar to themselves; and the cavalry is beyond all doubt the best in Europe, whether we respect the beauty, size, spirit, and docility of the horses, or the strength, appearance, and gallantry of the dragoons. In a word, the British troops, both horse and foot, are composed of tall, strong, muscular, handsome men, in red uniform with various facings, well
<PB N="259" REF="2660"/>
clothed, armed, and accoutred, inferior to none in exercise and discipline, and superior to all others in martial and military appearance.</P>
<P>The navy of England is at all times superior to any other maritime power, in number of ships, weight of metal, and expert mariners; of whom twelve or fourteen thousand are retained in the ser∣vice even in time of public tranquility. But the efforts of Great Britain by sea on extraordinary oc∣casions, are inconceivable. In the last war, there were near four hundred ships in the navy of Eng∣land; above one half of these were ships of the line, carrying each, from one hundred to fifty great guns, completely equipped with men, stores, and artillery; and admirably built and rigged for war or expedition. The number of seamen serv∣ing on board of the royal navy, could not be less than fourscore thousand. Finally, the nation is still farther secured by a militia raised in each county, in consequence of a late act of parliament. The whole number amounts to twenty-two thousand, well disciplined; and there is no doubt but they may be of eminent service in defending their coun∣try, should it ever be in danger from the attempts of foreign enemies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The militia of England, according to the old establish∣ment, might amount to two hundred thousand, horse and foot. The king chose lord lieutenants of counties, and vested them with power to arm, array, and command the militia within their different districts, to give commissions to inferior officers, and to charge the individuals of the county for this service, ac∣cording to their abilities, in furnishing horsemen and foot∣soldiers. In a word, the lieutenant and his deputy ap∣proved by the king, had power to exercise great op∣pression over their fellow-sub∣jects. They could levy every war, one fourth of each man's proportion in the general land-tax; and oblige every man so charged, to allow a month's pay to every soldier, in case of marching against the enemy; but this was re∣paid by his majesty. The power of commanding and directing the militia, vested in the king, was thought a dangerous branch of preroga∣tive: indeed, they were very seldom mustered, but grown obsolete and useless, until the legislature new-modelled them by a late act of parliament.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Great Britain, surrounded by the sea, and guarded by such a numerous and powerful navy, has little occasion for fortifications to defend its sea-ports and
<PB N="260" REF="2670"/>
frontiers. Nevertheless, the government hath thought proper to maintain some old castles both in South and North Britain, as places of arms, with small garrisons of invalids, who may help to pre∣serve the internal peace of the nation: it hath erected a chain of small forts across the isthmus of Inverness, in Scotland, to restrain and overawe the Highlanders that may be in the interest of the pretender: it maintains the works of Berwick, which is strongly fortified, and secured with a large garri∣son of regular troops: it hath built the forts of Tilbury and Sheerness, to defend the mouths of the river Thames and Medway, besides some block∣houses in different parts of the coast; and it hath fortified the important harbours of Portsmouth and Plymouth, so as to secure them from any at∣tempts of the enemy. After all, England must place its chief dependence upon its navy, not only for the protection of her commerce, but also for the security of her coast: for, if her squadrons are pro∣perly divided and stationed at different parts of the island, and provided with light sloops and frigates for intelligence and sudden excursions, they will al∣ways be able to baffie every projected invasion. Unassisted by a fleet, the army, though trebled, would be found insufficient to defend an open coast seven hundred miles in extent, from the designs of an artful and enterprizing enemy.</P>

<HEAD>DIVISION of ENGLAND and WALES.</HEAD>
<P>Having given a summary account of England in general, we shall now proceed to a detail of par∣ticular counties. England is divided into the six following circuits; namely, the home circuit, the Norfolk circuit, the Oxford circuit, the midland circuit, the western circuit, and the northern cir∣cuit. Each of these comprehends a certain num∣ber of counties. The home circuit includes Essex, Hertford, Kent, Surry, and Sussex. In the Nor∣folk circuit, we reckon Bucks, Bedfordshire, Hun∣tingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, and Nor∣folk. The Oxford circuit comprehends Oxon, Berks, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Mon∣mouthshire, Herefordshire, Salop, and Stafford∣shire. In the midland circuit, we find Warwick∣shire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Rutlandshire, and Northampton∣shire. The western circuit embraces Hants, Wilts, Dorsetshire, Somersetshire, Devonshire, and Corn∣wall. The northern circuit comprehends York∣shire, the bishopric of Durham, Northumberland, Lancashire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland. Nei∣ther Middlesex nor Cheshire is included in any circuit, the first being the seat of the supreme courts of justice, and the other, a county palatine.</P>
<P>The principality of Wales is divided into four circuits, called the north-east circuit, the north-west circuit, the south-east circuit, and the south-west circuit. In the north-east, are contained the coun∣ties of Flint, Denbigh, and Montgomery: in the north-west, those of Anglesea, Carnarvon, and Merioneth: in the south-east, are the counties of Radnor, Brecon, and Glamorgan: in the south∣west, are Pembrokeshire, Cardiganshire, and Caer∣marthen.
<PB N="262" REF="2690"/>
In England, we number forty counties, containing twenty-five cities, one hundred and se∣venty-two burroughs, and eight cinque-ports, which are Hastings, Dover, Sandwich, Hythe, Romney, Rye, Winchelsea, and Seaford.</P>
<P>We shall now proceed to give a distinct detail of all these counties and the principal towns, beginning at the most northern district.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>NORTHUMBERLAND; its BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and APPEARANCE.</HEAD>
<P>Northumberland, which was formerly the name of a whole kingdom, is now bestowed on the most northern county of England, bounded on the north and west by the river Tweed, which divides it from Scotland, the Cheviot hills, and part of Cumberland; washed on the east by the German ocean, and separated from Durham on the south by the rivers Tyne and Derwent. This county, which gives the title of duke to a nobleman who married the daughter of Algernoon, duke of So∣merset, whose mother was heiress of the Piercy fa∣mily, extends about fifty miles in length from north to south, and above forty from east to west; and is remarkably populous, containing eleven market-towns, two hundred and eighty villages, and forty-six parishes. The face of the country, es∣pecially towards the west, is roughened with huge mountains, the most remarkable of which, are the Cheviot hills, and the high ridge called Ridesdale; but the lands are level towards the sea-side, and the borders of Durham.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="263" REF="2700"/>
<HEAD>CLIMATE, AIR, SOIL, WATERS.</HEAD>
<P>The climate, like that of every other mountain∣bus country in the neighbourhood of the sea, is moist and disagreeable: the air, however, is pure and healthy, as being well ventilated by breezes and strong gales of wind; and in winter mitigated by the warm vapours from the two seas, the Irish and the German ocean, between which it is situated. The soil varies in different parts of the county. Among the hills it is barren, though it affords good pasture for sheep, which cover those moun∣tains. The low country, when properly cultivated, produces plenty of wheat and all sorts of grain; and great part of it is laid out in meadow-lands and rich inclosures. Northumberland is well wa∣tered with many rivers, rivulets, and fountains: its greatest rivers are the Tweed and the Tyne. The former we have described in our account of Scotland. The Tyne is composed of two streams, called south and north Tyne: the first rises on the verge of Cumberland, near Alston-moor, enters Northumberland, running north to Haltwesel, then bends easterly, and receiving the two small rivers east and west Alon, unites above Hexham with the other branch, taking its rise at a mountain called Fane-head in the western part of the county, thence called Tine dale; is swelled in its course by the little river Shele; joins the Read near Billing∣ham; and running in a direct line to the south-east, is united with the southern Tyne, forming a large river that washes Newcastle, and falls into the Ger∣man ocean near Tinmouth.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MINERALS, VEGETABLES, ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>In all probability, the mountains of Northum∣berland contain lead ore and other mineralized me∣tals
<PB N="264" REF="2710"/>
in their bowels, as they in all respects resemble those parts of Wales and Scotland, where lead mines have been found and prosecuted. Perhaps the inhabitants are diverted from inquiries of this nature, by the certain profits and constant employ∣ment they enjoy in working the coal pits with which this country abounds. The city of London, and the greatest part of England, are supplied with fuel from these stores of Northumberland, which are inexhaustible, enrich the proprietors, and em∣ploy an incredible number of hands and shipping.</P>
<P>With respect to vegetables, Northumberland produces the same species and genera of plants that are found in other countries of the same latitude, diversified with mountains and vallies washed by the sea. On the highest of the Cheviot hills, there is plenty of the <HI>chamaepericlymenon,</HI> or dwarf honey∣suckle; and on the shore, we find the <HI>estrium mari∣num</HI> or sea bugloss, and the <HI>eryngium vulgare,</HI> com∣monly called friers goose. There are no natural woods of any consequence in this county; but many plantations belonging to the seats of noble∣men and gentlemen, of which here is a great num∣ber. As for pot-herbs, roots, salladine, and every article of the kitchen-garden and orchard, they are here raised in great plenty by the usual means of cultivation; as are also the fruits of more delicate flavour, such as the apricot, peach, and nectarine. The spontaneous fruits it produces in common with other parts of Great Britain, are the crab-apple, the sloe or bullace, the hazle-nut, the acorn, hips, haws, with the berries of the bramble, the juniper, wood-strawberries, cranberries, and bilberries.</P>
<P>Northumberland raises a good number of excel∣lent horses and black cattle, and affords pasture for infinite flocks of sheep; both the cattle and sheep are of a large breed, but the wool is coarser than that which the more southern counties produce.
<PB N="265" REF="2720"/>
The hills and mountains abound with a variety of game, such as red deer, foxes, hares, rabbits, heathcock, growse, partridge, quail, plover, teal, and woodcock: indeed, this is counted one of the best sporting countries in Great Britain. The sea and rivers are well stocked with fish, especially the Tweed, in which an infinite number of salmon is caught and carried to Tinmouth, where being pickled, they are conveyed by sea to London, and sold under the name of Newcastle salmon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>The Northumbrians were antiently stigmatized as a savage, barbarous people, addicted to cruelty, and inured to rapine. The truth is, before the union of the two crowns of England and Scotland, the borderers on each side were extremely licentious and ungovernable, trained up to war from their infancy, and habituated to plunder by the mutual incursions made into each kingdom; incursions which neither truce nor treaty could totally prevent. People of a pacific disposition, who proposed to earn their livelihood by agriculture, would not on any terms remain in a country exposed to the first violence of a bold and desperate enemy: therefore the lands lay uncultivated, and in a great measure deserted by every body but lawless adventurers, who subsisted by theft and rapine. There was a tract fifty miles in length and six in breadth, be∣tween Berwick and Carlisle, known by the name of the Debateable Land, to which both nations laid claim, though it belonged to neither; and this was occupied by a set of banditti who plundered on each side, and what they stole in one kingdom, they sold openly in the other; nay, they were so dexterous in their occupation, that by means of hot bread applied to the horns of the cattle which they
<PB N="266" REF="2730"/>
stole, they twisted them in such a manner, that when the right owners saw them in the market, they did not know their own property. Wardens were appointed to guard the marches or borders in each kingdom; and these offices were always conferred on noblemen of the first character for influence, valour, and integrity. The English border was divided into three marches, called the east, west, and middle marches; the gentlemen of the coun∣try were constituted deputy-wardens, who held march courts, regulated the watches, disciplined the militia, and took measures for assembling them in arms at the first alarm: but in time of peace be∣tween the two nations, they were chiefly employed in suppressing the insolence and rapine of the bor∣derers. Since the union of the crowns, however, Northumberland is totally changed, both with res∣pect to the improvement of the lands, and the re∣formation of the inhabitants. The grounds, being now secure from incursion and insult, are settled by creditable farmers, and cultivated like other parts of the kingdom. As hostilities have long ceased, the people have forgot the use of arms, and exer∣cised themselves in the more eligible avocations of peace; in breeding sheep and cattle, manuring the grounds, working at the coal-pits, and in different branches of commerce and manufacture. In their persons they are generally tall, strong, bold, hardy, and fresh-coloured, and though less unpolished than their ancestors, not quite so civilized as their southern neighbours. The commonalty are well fed, lodged, and cloathed; and all of them remarkably distinguished, by a kind of Shibboleth or whurle, being a particular way of pronouncing the letter R, as if they hawked it up from the windpipe, like the cawing of rooks. In other respects, the language they speak, is an uncouth mixture of the English and Scottish dialects. There is
<PB N="267" REF="2740"/>
no material distinction between the fashionable peo∣ple of Northumberland, and those of the same rank in other parts of the kingdom: the same form of education will produce the same effects in all countries. The gentlemen of Northumberland, however, are remarkable for their courage, hospi∣tality, and hard drinking.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>A great number of Roman monuments have been found in this county; but the most remarka∣ble curiosity of that kind consists in the remains of Hadrian's vallum, and the wall of Severus, running parallel to each other from the Solway Frith beyond Burgh on the Sands near Carlisle, to the neighbourhood of Newcastle upon Tyne, an extent of sixty-eight English miles. Hadrian's val∣lum is a rampart of earth with a large ditch to the northward, and another agger or rampart to the southward, which seems to have served as a mili∣tary way. The wall of Severus was built of stone, twelve feet high and eight in thickness, of such ma∣terials and so disposed, as to render it as solid as a rock: it was strengthened by a deep ditch to the northward, by turrets and castella at certain dis∣tances, and was accommodated with a paved mili∣tary way on the south-side, though not always pa∣rallel to the range of the wall, being in breadth about seventeen feet. Hadrian first raised his val∣lum, and Severus afterwards built the wall with those castella, for the same purpose of defend∣ing the Roman province from the incursions of the Scots and Picts; and that the wall was built by the legionary soldiers appears from a great num∣ber of inscriptions upon stones, found through the whole length of the <HI>pretentura:</HI> Hadrian's vallum reached no farther than Newcastle; but the wall of
<PB N="268" REF="2750"/>
Severus is carried through that town, and ends at a stationary fort near Couzen's-house, about three miles to the eastward, where the ruins of a Roman station and town are still discernible. Large portions of the wall are still standing in different parts of Northumberland and Cumberland, as well as the foundations of several castella, which appear to have been sixty-six feet square, built on the south∣side, adjoining to the wall, at the distance of about a mile from each other.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>The most noted towns in Northumberland, are Newcastle, Morpeth, Alnwick, Berwick, Hexham, and North Shields.</P>
<P>Newcastle, the capital, is a large, populous, and flourishing town, situated on the north bank of the river Tyne, about three hundred miles to the northward of London. It is connected by means of a stately stone bridge of seven arches, with the suburbs of Gateshead, which, being on the southern side of the river, is part of the bishopric of Dur∣ham. Near the spot where the town now stands, there was of old a fort called Moncaster; and Ro∣bert, son of William the Conqueror, having built another to overawe the Scots, bestowed upon it the name of Newcastle, in contradistinction to the old fortress. Divers monasteries and hospitals being raised around it, the place, in a little time, swelled into a town; and the walls of it were begun in the reign of Edward I. by a rich burgher, who had been taken by the Scots, and paid a large ransom for his liberty. It is at present surrounded by a strong wall, in which there are seven gates and as many turrets, with some case-mates said to be bomb-proof. It was created a burrough by king Richard II. who granted permission to carry a sword
<PB REF="2760"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="269" REF="2770"/>
before the mayor; and king Henry VI. erected it into a town and county incorporate, independent of Northumberland. The magistracy consists of a mayor, nineteen aldermen, a sheriff, a recorder, a town-clerk, a clerk of the chambers, two coroners, eight chamberlains, a sword-bearer, with a cap of maintenance, a water-bailiff with a great mace, and seven serjeants at mace. Newcastle has been ex∣posed to frequent incursions and sieges of the Scots, before the union of the two crowns; and in the great rebellion, the army of that kingdom, under the command of Leslie, took it by storm: but it has long ago retrieved all its losses, and become the great emporium of the north of England for coal and other merchandize. The town is built upon the declivity of a hill, which renders the streets steep and incommodious. The houses are crowded together so as to exhibit but a disagreeable appearance: yet one or two of the streets are large, spacious, and well paved. The town is overlooked by the old ruinous castle: the exchange and custom-house are magni∣ficent buildings, but too close to the river; along the bank of which, there is a fine key or wharf faced with freestone, to which ships of ordinary burthen can lay their broadsides, to be loaded or unloaded. But the coal-ships are loaded at or near Shields, seven miles farther down the river; their lading being conveyed thither in lighters, which they call keels. The number of the keelmen who work in these lighters, exceeds six thousand, who live in a suburb called Sandgate. They have, by a contribution among themselves, built a noble hos∣pital for such of their poor brethren as are disabled by accident, or superannuated and past their labour. The principal church of Newcastle, called St. Ni∣cholas, is a stately old fabric, built by David, king of Scotland, with a fine steeple of rare archi∣tecture: here are, besides, six churches or chapels.
<PB N="270" REF="2780"/>
We may number among the public edifices, an ele∣gant mansion-house for the mayor, a noble hall for the surgeons, with a museum, a stately infirmary on the model of that at Edinburgh, a library belong∣ing to the corporation, a large prison called New∣gate, several meeting-houses and charity-schools well endowed. The number of inhabitants amounts to above forty thousand; and many of them are wealthy and live with splendour. They are gene∣rally bold, rough, and industrious, enriching them∣selves with the coal trade, and other branches of commerce and manufacture, such as ship-building, glass-making, salt-works, and hard-ware, or wrought iron. The place is particularly famous for grind∣stones, which are exported to all the countries in Europe. The fashionable people live in the upper part of the town, at a distance from the river, where they possess elegant houses and gardens, and enjoy themselves at comedies, assemblies, and other po∣lite diversions. The houses are chiefly built of stone, some are of brick, and a very few of timber. The revenue of the town, amounting to eight thousand pounds a year, is considerably larger than that of any other corporation burrough in England; and from this, the mayor is indulged with an annual allowance of six hundred pounds, besides the maintenance of a coach, barge, and mansion-house.</P>
<P>At the distance of seven miles below Newcastle stand the villages of north and south Shields, on different sides of the river, and may be termed its out-parts, from whence the ships take their depar∣ture. South Shields is in the bishopric of Durham, and shall be mentioned in that article. North Shields is the more populous and considerable, be∣ing chiefly inhabited by mariners and ship-masters: the streets which lie along the shore are dark, nasty, and narrow, and the houses make a very mean ap∣pearance; yet some of the inhabitants are wealthy,
<PB N="271" REF="2790"/>
and a good number of vessels belong to this vil∣lage. Here the river forms a small bay, which af∣fords a very safe anchorage; and in this place four hundred sail of laden ships are sometimes seen lying together in three rows, waiting for a fair wind. The harbour and mouth of the Tyne are defend∣ed by Tinmouth castle, a large fortress well sup∣plied with artillery, situated on a high rock, which, towards the sea on the east and north, is counted inaccessible. At the harbour's mouth there is a bar of sand, where the river is not more than se∣ven feet deep at low water; and on the outside are the dangerous rocks called the Black Middins: but these are easily avoided by means of light-houses set up and maintained by Trinity-house in New∣castle. Hard by these is another castle called Clif∣ford's fort, which intirely commands the mouth of the river.</P>
<P>Morpeth is a neat little market-town, standing on the small river Wentzbeck, about fifteen miles to the northward of Newcastle. It is a burrough by prescription, belonging to the earl of Carlisle, who derives from it the title of viscount: four persons, being annually chosen by the free bur∣gesses, are presented to his lordship's steward, who nominates two of them to be bailiffs, and these with seven aldermen, constitute the magistracy. Morpeth, lying on a much frequented post road, is well supplied with inns for the accommodation of travellers. There is a bridge over the river, and an old castle in ruins. Here is great plenty of provisions extremely cheap; and their market for live cattle on Wednesdays is, next to that of Smithfield in London, the greatest in all England. Great quantities of corn, provisions, and cattle, are likewise sold in the Saturdays markets. Va∣riety of fish is brought hither from the sea, of
<PB N="272" REF="2800"/>
which the town commands a good prospect: the burrough sends two members to parliament.</P>
<P>Nineteen miles to the northward of Morpeth, we enter Alnwick, a little walled town, seated near the river Alne, neat and cleanly, but chiefly remarkable for the castle, which formerly belonged to the family of Percy, and is still possessed by the duke of Northumberland, who has lately ordered it to be repaired and beautified. It was once the most noble castle in the North of England, and still retains evident marks of its former magnifi∣cence. At the siege of this place, Malcolm III. king of Scotland, and his son Edward, lost their lives by treachery; and in the neighbourhood of Alnwick, king William II. of Scotland was sur∣prized and taken in a meadow by some English ba∣rons, who had disguised themselves in the garb and ensigns of his people for that purpose.</P>
<P>To the north-west of Alnwick rises that fa∣mous ridge of mountains called the Cheviot hills, which separate Northumberland from Scotland; and are no less famous for their great height than for the battle celebrated by the ballad of Chevy∣chase. This engagement, more remarkable for the valour and quality than for the number of the combatants, was fought between Percy, known by the epithet of Hotspur, son to the earl of Nor∣thumberland, and the Scottish earl of Douglas, at a place called Otterburn, on the river Rede, near the town of Ellesdon, on the south side of the Cheviot hills. Here these two young warriors and rivals in glory encountered in the reign of Richard II. king of England. Douglas lost his life in the action; nevertheless, Percy was routed and carried prisoner into Scotland. One of the Che∣viot hills, having a level plain on the top, with a pond of water, is so high as to be seen at the dis∣tance of sixty miles in the east-riding of Yorkshire.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="2810"/>
About seven miles from Cheviot, is the village of Floddon or Flodden, seated on the river Till, memorable for a bloody battle fought between the English and Scots, in which James IV. of Scot∣land was slain with all his prime nobility. This victory, obtained by the earl of Surry, was the more remarkable as king Henry VII. was then abroad with the flower of the English soldiery, engaged in the siege of Tournay.</P>
<P>Berwick is a large fortified town, situated on the north side of the river Tweed, formerly be∣longing to Scotland, capital of the shire, which still retains its name, and one of the four principal towns in which the royal burroughs of Scotland held their conventions. Before the union of the two crowns, it was a perpetual bone of contention between the kingdoms of England and Scotland, and possessed alternately by both nations; though its strength and beauty are in a great measure ow∣ing to its English masters. Queen Elizabeth, who knew the importance of this frontier, con∣tracted it within due compass, built a noble bridge over the river, connecting it with the county of Northumberland, surrounded it with a stone wall of ashler work, a steep ditch, counterscarp, and bastions, and furnished it with a numerous artillery. It was strengthened by a castle or citadel, which is now in ruins; and the government of it was al∣ways conferred on some nobleman of known cou∣rage and integrity, who was at the same time war∣den of the eastern marches. It was incorporated as a burrough by king James I. and its charter confirmed by act of parliament. At present, it is a large, well-built, populous town, erected into a county, though comprehended in Northumber∣land; and in all proclamations expressly men∣tioned as a separate dominion. It is governed by a mayor, recorder, four bailiffs, and a common
<PB N="274" REF="2820"/>
council of burgesses, and sends two representatives to parliament. The streets and houses are spa∣cious and elegant: the place is beautified by a stately church, an exchange, town-house, and the noble bridge above-mentioned. At the north∣west end there are handsome suburbs called the castle-gate; and on the southern end of the bridge is a neat village called Tweedmouth, provided with a church and good inns for travellers. Ber∣wick is wholly inhabited by a mixture of English and Scots, who speak a dialect partaking of the languages of both nations, though the English are easily distinguished by the Northumberland whurle. Here is an excellent market for corn, fish, and all sorts of provision, which are sold at very reasonable rates. The people are remarkably in∣dustrious, employing themselves in the salmon fishery, which is a very advantageous article; and in a manufacture of fine stockings. The greatest defect in this place is the want of a good harbour: for though the tide flows four miles above the town, there is a dangerous bar at the mouth of the har∣bour; and the shore without, being bold, steep, and rocky, there is no safe riding in the offing. Berwick gave the title of duke to the natural son of James II. who was attainted by parliament af∣ter the revolution, and died a marechal of France, where he had acquired a great character by his mi∣litary capacity and success. This town, as a forti∣fied pass, is always garrisoned with a regiment of soldiers.</P>
<P>Along the shore as far south as Morpeth, there are several islands and rocks that deserve to be mentioned. Of these, the most remarkable is Holy Island, about eight miles from Berwick, so called from the reputed sanctity of the monks who here possessed a convent. This is the antient Lin∣disfarne, the see of a bishopric, which was
<PB N="275" REF="2830"/>
afterwards transferred to Durham. It is surrounded by the sea at high-water; but at the time of ebb, there is a passage over the sand from it to the con∣tinent. This island produces some corn and rab∣bits, and there is plenty of fish upon the coast. Here is a neat little town commanded by a small fort, built upon a rising ground to the south-east, with a commodious haven, which is the only safe port between the mouth of the Humber and the Frith of Edinburgh.</P>
<P>Seven miles to the south-east of this harbour, lie the Fearn islands, which are no other than a cluster of rocks in the sea, frequented by vast num∣bers of sea-fowl: yet here are still to be seen the ruins of an old monastery, a tower, and a light∣house, maintained for the direction of mariners.</P>
<P>Coquet island appears seventeen miles farther to the south-east, at the mouth of the river Coquet, from whence the isle derives its name. It was an∣tiently famous for a castle and a monastery, which are now in ruins: at present it boasts of no other buildings than the huts of fishermen and colliers, who resort to the island to dig sea-coal, and catch fish, of which here is great plenty, with infinite numbers of sea-fowl.</P>
<P>Hexham or Hagutstad, the capital of a district called Hexhamshire, standing on the south side of the Tyne, about fifteen miles from Newcastle, is a handsome town and corporation, governed by a bailiff annually elected into that office. It was an∣tiently large, wealthy, and magnificent, formed into an episcopal see in the time of the Saxon hep∣tarchy, by Etheldrida, wife to Egfrid, king of Northumberland, in favour of Wilfrid, who had been archbishop of York: but this diocese was soon united to that of Lindisfarne. The same la∣dy built at Hexham a stately monastery, which is said to have exceeded all the convents on this
<PB N="276" REF="2840"/>
side of the Alps in beauty and magnificence. Part of the church that still remains, exhibits evi∣dent marks of its antient splendour.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Northumberland abounds with curious monu∣ments of Roman, British, and Saxon antiquity, consisting of the fragments of the vallum and wall, camps and castella, altars, urns, coins, and castles. At Corbridge, near Hexham, some gigantic bones were dug up towards the close of the last century; and others of the same nature at Ailmouth, found so deep in the earth, that they are supposed to have lain there since the general deluge. In the neigh∣bourhood of Warkworth, on the bank of the ri∣ver Coquet, is an old hermitage cut out of the so∣lid rock, consisting of a chamber and kitchen, with a chapel and altar. At the village of Fenham near Newcastle, some coal-pits have been set on fire, and for several years continued to burn: the flames were visible at night, and in the day, the tract of the conflagration was marked by brimstone lying upon the surface of the earth. At Dunstabury castle, that stands on the shore between the Fearn and Coquet islands, the rocks produce a fine spar like that of St. Vincent's rock near Bristol. In Chillingham castle, on the river Till, there is a chimney-piece of marble, in the heart of which was found a live toad, when the stone was sawed asunder.</P>

<HEAD>SEATS.</HEAD>
<P>The most remarkable seats in Northumberland are these that follow: the castle of Alnwick, be∣longing to the duke of Northumberland; that of Morpeth, appertaining to the earl of Carlisle; Chillingham, where the earl of Tankerville resides;
<PB N="277" REF="2850"/>
Dilston, near Hexham, a beautiful seat of the earl of Derwentwater, who lost his life on a scaffold in the year 1715; Widdrington castle, formerly pos∣sessed by the antient barons of that name, attainted and forfeited in the same year for rebellion; the house of Beaufront, beautifully situated on the side of the Tyne, belonging to the family of Erring∣ton; Seaton-Delaval, a magnificent structure, on the sea-side, the seat of Sir Francis-Blake Delaval; Wallington, the residence of Sir Walter Blackett; Belsoe castle and Capheaton, belonging to Sir Wil∣liam Middleton and Sir Edward Swinburn.</P>

<HEAD>CUMBERLAND. Its BOUNDARIES and EXTENT, MOUNTAINS, FORESTS, RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>Cumberland, or <HI>Cumbria,</HI> so denominated from the Britons, or <HI>Cumri,</HI> who inhabited it, was former∣ly the name of a kingdom, which extended from the vallum of Adrian to the city of Dunbritton, now Dumbarton, on the Frith of Clyde, in that part of the island which was afterwards called Scot∣land. At present Cumberland is a county of Eng∣land, which gives the title of duke to his royal highness prince Henry-Frederic, third brother of the reigning king. It is bounded on the north and north-west by Scotland; on the south and south∣east by part of Lancashire and Westmoreland; it borders on the east with Northumberland and Durham; and on the west and south-west is washed by the Irish sea. The length from north to south may amount to five and fifty miles; but the breadth does not exceed forty. It is divided into five wards, comprehending one city, fourteen market towns, forty-eight parish churches, besides chapels, fourteen thousand eight hundred houses, and fourscore thousand inhabitants. The face of
<PB N="278" REF="2860"/>
the country is diversified with hill and dale, and, in some parts of Cumberland, there are very high mountains; such as Skiddaw, not far from Coker∣mouth, counted the highest hill in England; Wry∣nose, near Hawkshead, in the northern part of the county, on the top of which we find three shire∣stones, so called because, though within a foot of each other, they stand in the three counties of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire; Lan∣vellin and Castenand, which vie in height with the Skiddaw; Hardknot, on the borders of West∣moreland, from the foot of which the river Eske takes its origin; the mountains of Copland, in the southern part of the county; the large tract on the east side, known by the denomination of Cross-Fells, on account of the crosses erected upon them at the first planting of Christianity in these parts; the fells of Derwent, and many others, which we need not particularize.</P>
<P>Besides a great number of private plantations, there are divers old forests in the county of Cum∣berland; such as Ward forest near Wigton, Ingle∣wood forest on the banks of the river Peterrel, and the forest of Copland.</P>
<P>Cumberland is well watered with rivers, meres or lakes, and fountains; but none of its streams are navigable. The most remarkable of these are the Derwent, the Eden, the Elne, the Eske, the Leven, the Irthing, and the Peterrel. The Der∣went rises in the vale of Boradale, in the southern part of the county, among the Derwent fells, and forming a spacious lake, in which there are three small islands, pursues a northern course towards the middle of the county, then takes a western di∣rection, passes by Cockermouth, and falls into the Irish sea near Workington, being famous for its fishery of salmon. The Eden, or Ituna of Ptole∣mey, is the outlet of the lake called Telleswater,
<PB N="279" REF="2870"/>
on the borders of Westmoreland, famous for pro∣ducing the delicious little fish called char, of the trout species: after a northerly course of thirty miles, it deviates to the westward, and, passing by Carlisle, falls into the frith of Solway, a large in∣let of the sea, dividing this part of England from Scotland. The Elne rises near Jerby, and falls into the sea at Birkby, about four miles to the northward of Workington. The Eske rises in Eskdale, in Scotland, and entering Cumberland, disembogues itself into the bottom of the Solway frith, which near the same place likewise receives the Leven, that rises in the mountains of Bew, at the northern extremity of the county. The Irthing, following a parallel course, is joined by the Cam∣bek near Brumpton, and falls into the Eden, at a place called Warwick. The Eden is afterwards swelled by the river Peterrel, which runs in a northern direction from Penrith to Weathersall.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, MINERAL, VEGETA∣BLE, and ANIMAL.</HEAD>
<P>The air of Cumberland is keen and piercing up∣on the mountains towards the north, and the cli∣mate is moist as in all other hilly countries, which, at the same time, abound with wood and water. The soil varies with the face of the country, being barren on the moors and mountains, and fertile in the vallies and level ground bordering upon the sea: in general, the eastern parts of the shire are barren and desolate; yet even the least fertile parts are rich in metals and minerals. The mountains of Copland abound with copper: veins of the same metal, with a mixture of gold and silver, were found in the reign of queen Elizabeth among the fells of Derwent; and royal mines were formerly wrought at Keswick. This county produces great
<PB N="280" REF="2880"/>
quantities of coal, some lead, abundance of the mineral earth called black-lead, several mines of lapis calaminaris, and an inconsiderable pearl fishery on the coast near Ravenglass.</P>
<P>With respect to the vegetable productions of this province, here is plenty of grain, wheat, rye, oats, barley, pease, and beans, with all sorts of herbs and roots for the kitchen. The most re∣markable plants that grow spontaneously in Cum∣berland are these, the <HI>eruca monensis, laciniata lutea,</HI> the <HI>echium marinum,</HI> the <HI>gladiolus lacustris dortmanni,</HI> the <HI>orobus sylvaticus,</HI> the <HI>myrtillus grandis,</HI> the <HI>cannibis spuria, flore magno albo perelegante,</HI> the <HI>hesperis pannonica inodora,</HI> the <HI>orchis palmata pa∣lustris,</HI> the <HI>cynosorchis militaris purpurea ordorata,</HI> the <HI>thlaspi minus ceusij,</HI> the <HI>trogopogon purpureum,</HI> the <HI>virga aurea latifolia serrata,</HI> and the <HI>equisetum nudum variegatum minus.</HI></P>
<P>As for the animals, what has been said of North∣umberland may be here repeated. The mountains feed vast numbers of sheep; abundance of horses and black cattle are bred in the pastures. The farmer's yard is stocked with poultry of all sorts, and pidgeons; the hills and lakes afford a great variety of game, such as foxes, hares, rabbits, black, and moor game, partridge, quail, wood-cocks, snipes, plover, field-fares, teal, widgeon, and wild∣ducks. Among the birds of prey, we may reckon a few eagles, hawks, kites, and herons. The rivers, lakes, and streams, afford plenty of salmon, trout, char, eels, and flounders; and the sea pours forth a profusion of excellent fish: but this blessing and gift of Providence is in a great measure neglect∣ed by the inhabitants of Cumberland, who are so satisfied with the productions of the land, that they give very little attention to the fishery. Agricul∣ture is here very well understood, though the coun∣try
<PB N="281" REF="2890"/>
does not abound with inclosures. The gentle∣men are numerous, opulent, and hospitable; the yeomen wealthy, and used to good living; the common people are hardy, strong, and industrious, well cloathed, well fed, and lodged in warm com∣fortable houses. Their chief employments are those of agriculture, horse breeding, sheep feeding, mining, and the colliery; and there are some good mariners in the sea-ports of the county. Among a great number of elegant seats in Cumberland, we shall only take notice of Drumburgh-castle, on the Solway frith, belonging to the duke of Nor∣folk; the earl of Egremont's castle at Cokermouth; the earl of Carlisle's at Naworth, ten miles from Carlisle; that of the earl of Sussex, at Kirkoswald, thirteen miles from Carlisle; and Dacre's castle, belonging to the same nobleman, about four miles from Penrith. All these are venerable buildings, raised as places of strength, before the union of the English and Scottish crowns; at present little re∣garded for aught but their antiquity and romantic situation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>We have already mentioned in our account of Northumberland, the remains of the Roman wall that ran from sea to sea, beginning at Boulness, at the mouth of the river Eden, in this county, and ending at Cousin's house, about three miles to the eastward of Newcastle. Considering the castella and stationary camps, which the Romans were obliged to maintain in this neighbourhood for the defence of the barrier, there must be a great num∣ber of antient monuments in Cumberland; accord∣ingly, there is scarce a family of any note in the county, that does not possess some altar or stone with a Latin inscription.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="282" REF="2900"/>
<HEAD>CITIES and TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Besides the city of Carlisle, which is the capital of the province, we reckon in Cumberland, the towns of Cockermouth, Ravenglass, Egremont, Whitehaven, Keswick, Workington, Jerby, Pen∣rith, Kirk-oswald, Brumpton, Boulness.</P>
<P>Carlisle, in Latin Carleolum, is a small, but thriving city, in the north of England, situated about three hundred miles from London, in the forest of Ingleswood, at the distance of seven miles from the border of Scotland. It was secured with a citadel or castle, and fortified with walls and turrets as a barrier against the incursions of the Scots, who were always troublesome neigh∣bours to England. Carlisle is delightfully situated between the conflux of three fine rivers, namely the Eden, the Peterrel, and the Lunda; and was of old one of the Roman stations. Though it suffered greatly at different periods during the wars that raged almost incessantly between the two kingdoms, the monarchs of England, since the reign of William Rufus, paid particular atten∣tion to this frontier, and always kept the fortifi∣cations in repair, until such precautions were ren∣dered unnecessary by the union. The walls, how∣ever, are still standing, and the castle is garrisoned by invalids. The houses are commodious and well built, the inhabitants wealthy, and trade chiefly in fustians, of which there is a considerable manufacture in the place. The number of the people does not exceed two thousand: they are governed by a mayor, two sheriffs or bailiffs, twelve aldermen, twice that number of common-council-men, or capital burgesses, a recorder and chamberlain, with a sword-bearer and mace-bearer. Carlisle is the see of a bishop, and the seat of the assizes; sends burgesses to parliament, enjoys re∣venues

to the amount of five hundred pounds a∣year, with the right of fairs, markets, and divers other immunities by charter, and gives the title of earl to a branch of the antient and noble family of Howard. It comprehends two parishes, and has a very antient cathedral of very curious workman∣ship, built in the fourteenth century, repaired and beautified by king Henry VIII. The chapter consists of a dean, four canons, eight minor canons, a deacon, a subdeacon, four lay-clerks, six choiristers, and as many almsmen. To the use of this chapter, the tythes of the whole city are ap∣propriated, and both churches being curacies, are supplied by two of the minor canons, nominated by the dean and majority. People in digging within the city, as well as in ploughing up the adjacent fields, have found antient pavements, foundations of houses, arches, and doors, coins, urns, and other antiquities. At the village of Netherby, on the side of the Esk, not far from Carlisle, there is a great appearance of ruins, which appear to have been some considerable city, probably the old Oeseca of the Romans. A great many antient inscriptions have been found in this place, and the neighbourhood. During the rebellion in the year 1745, a party of During the rebellion in the year 1745, a party of the rebels were left in Carlisle, when the young pretender retreated to Scotland; and the town be∣ing invested by his late royal highness the duke of Cumberland, they surrendered at discretion, after having made some shew of defence. At Row∣cliff, near the sea-shore, is an old castle, formerly belonging to the lords Dacres. At Sollommoss, a little farther to the northward of the Oesturia or Frith, the Scots were routed by the English in the year 1542. At a little distance from hence, the Esk receives the small river Kirksop, which is the
<PB N="284" REF="2930"/>
boundary between England and Scotland. Near to Bew castle, which stands upon the Leven, there is in a church-yard a cross of one intire stone about five yards high, with a Danish inscription, by which it appears to be a sepulchral monument. In the tract of the Roman wall, on the south-side of the Oestuary, is the small town of Burgh on the Sands, famous for the death of king Edward I. who ex∣pired in this place, on his march at the head of a great army, with which he intended to extirpate the Scottish nation: finding his end approaching, he gave directions that his son should proceed with the expedition, and carry his corpse along with him in∣to Scotland as a sure pledge of victory. The spot on which this great prince fetched his last breath is distinguished by a large square pillar eight and twenty feet high, with Latin inscriptions on the dif∣ferent sides, specifying the death of Edward; and that this monument was erected to his memory in the year 1685, by Henry Howard, duke of Nor∣folk, earl marshal of England, and earl of Arun∣del.</P>
<P>Cockermouth is a populous market-town, at the distance of twenty miles to the southward of Car∣lisle, situated at the conflux of the rivers Derwent and Coker, between two hills, on one of which stands the church, and on the other, an old eastle of great strength belonging to the duke of Northum∣berland. The town is well built, the houses being of stone covered with slate; and through the middle of it runs the Coker, over which there are two hand∣some stone bridges. The chief magistrate of this burrough is a bailiff, annually chosen by sixteen burghers at the court held by the duke of Northum∣berland. It sends members to parliament, though it is not a corporation, and enjoys a considerable trade by means of a commodious harbour. In the neighbourhood of Cockermouth we see the ruins
<PB N="285" REF="2940"/>
of Pap-castle, which appears, by several monu∣ments, to be of Roman antiquity. Here was found a large open vessel of green stone, exhibiting seve∣ral little images carved upon the margins, and a Danish inscription, by which we learn that it was a font for baptism. It is still used for the same pur∣pose in the neighbouring church of Bridkirk.</P>
<P>Ravenglass is a small neat market-town, situated at the conflux of the rivers Eske and Mute, where they fall into the sea, near the southern extremity of the county: but this river Eske, which rises from the mountain called Hardknot-hill, must be distinguished in the reader's memory from the ri∣ver of the same name that disembogues itself into the Solway Frith, at the opposite end of the county. Two thirds of Ravenglass is surrounded by the Eske and the Mute, which form a tolerable harbour commodious for trade, and the fishery, which is here very considerable.</P>
<P>Egremont is a small town seated on the river Broadwater, over which there are two bridges. It stands at some distance from the sea, about nine miles to the eastward of Ravenglass, and enjoys the convenience of a small harbour for boats. It was formerly famous for a castle of the same name belonging to the family of Percy; and at present gives the title of earl to that of Wyndham, in con∣sequence of his lordship's being descended from the last heiress of that honourable house, who espoused Charles, duke of Somerset.</P>
<P>Whitehaven lying on the same coast, a little far∣ther to the northward, is a large, populous, flou∣rishing market-town, receiving its name from a white rock standing on the west-side, and the haven, which is safe and convenient. This harbour has been greatly improved, and the town beautified and enlarged by the family of Sir James Lowther, who, from this port exports annually to Ireland
<PB N="286" REF="2950"/>
and the Isle of Man, as much coal from his own estate, as brings him in a revenue of twenty thou∣sand pounds. Whitehaven is the most eminent port in England for the coal trade, next to Newcastle; and the increase of shipping is so great, that after a tract of contrary winds, it is not unusual to see two hundred ships set sail at once from the harbour. The inhabitants likewise deal in salt, sugars, to∣bacco, and other branches of commerce. It anci∣ently belonged to St. Bees, a little village on the sea side, at the distance of two miles to the southward, which is said to have derived its name from an Irish female saint called St. Bega, who per∣formed some miracles, and founded a nunnery on the spot. Certain it is, there was a Benedictine priory founded by William de Mischines, brother of Ranulph, first earl of Cumberland. At present, it is remarkable for nothing but a grammar-school with a library, founded by Edmund Grindal, arch∣bishop of Canterbury, who was a native of the place, and since improved by the munificence of di∣vers benefactors of the clergy as well as laity. Here is good anchoring ground and safe riding for vessels.</P>
<P>On the other side of Whitehaven, nearly at the same distance, there is a convenient harbour by the village of Moresby; and here, as well as in every other landing-place along this part of the shore, we find ruins of antient fortifications, raised by the Romans to defend the coast from the naval arma∣ments of the Scots and Irish. In and about this village, the inhabitants have discovered many an∣tient foundations, vaults, and caverns; and dug up several stones with Latin inscriptions.</P>
<P>Keswick is a small market-town, seated on the side of a lake in a fertile plain, about eight miles to the south-east of Cockermouth, near the mountain of Skiddaw. It was formerly famous for its royal
<PB N="287" REF="2960"/>
mines, and these produce store of black lead. The present inhabitants have built mills upon the river Derwent, for smelting lead and sawing timber.</P>
<P>Workington is a small town situated on the sea∣coast, where the Derwent, after having received the Coker, falls into the sea. Here the unfortunate Mary, queen of Scotland landed, when she fled from her own subjects, to the assistance of her kins∣woman queen Elizabeth. The inhabitants are chiefly employed in fishing salmon, which they send fresh to London by means of relays of horses which travel night and day.</P>
<P>Jerby, supposed to be the Arbeia of the antients, is a market-town on the river Elen, noted for little else than its antiquity.</P>
<P>Ellenborough, standing at the mouth of the same river, is now a paltry village; but in this neigh∣bourhood, seated upon a rising ground, stands the Roman town of Olenaen, where the first Herculean wing kept garrison in the reign of Theodosius the Younger. In this place, many curious antiquities have been discovered, such as altars, monuments, statues, and images. Curiosities of the same kind have been found in the highway at Wigton, a small market-town a little farther north, in the forest of Allerdale; a tract of country which formerly be∣longed to Henry, earl of Carlisle, son of David, king of Scotland, a pious and magnificent prince, who here founded the abbey of Ulm or Holm-Cul∣trame. This monastery stood at the bottom of a bay, and the famous mathematician Michael Scot was one of the monks who here resided. At the distance of a few miles to the eastward of Holm-Cultrame, we find the ruins of an antient city, vul∣garly called Old Carlisle; in all probability, the re∣mains of the Roman station which Antoninus dis∣tinguishes by the name of <HI>Castra Exploratorum;</HI> as it answers to the distance he assigns from thence
<PB N="288" REF="2970"/>
to <HI>Bulgium</HI> and <HI>Lugo vallum;</HI> and it appears from divers inscriptions found on the spot, that the <HI>ala Augusta</HI> were here quartered in the reign of the em∣peror Gordianus.</P>
<P>Penrith, which in the old British language signi∣fies a red head or red hill, the ground in this neigh∣bourhood, and the stone being of a reddish hue, is a large well built market-town, seated on a hill called Penrith-fell, on the east-side of the county, upon the banks of the river Eden, not far from its source. It was formerly defended by a castle, which is now in ruins. The place is adorned with a large commodious market-house, exhibiting the figures of bears climbing up ragged staffs, the device of the antient earls of Warwick; and here is a stately church, on the north-side of which appear two pyramidal pillars, about four yards high, and five yards asunder, believed by the vulgar to be the sepulchral monument of one Sir Owen Caesarius, a gigantic warrior of old, who is said to have killed a number of wild boars that infested the country, and harboured in the forest of Englewood. Pen∣rith is populous and wealthy, reckoned the second town of the county for trade and opulence, parti∣cularly noted for tanners. It has a good corn market every week, and another much more consi∣derable for cattle, held once a fortnight, from Whitsunday to the first of August. In the neigh∣bourhood of the town appear the ruins of an an∣cient city, which, though vulgarly denominated old Penrith, is supposed by the learned to be the Roman <HI>Petrianae,</HI> because it appears by an old in∣scription found in the place, that the <HI>ala petriana</HI> was here quartered on the banks of the Eden. Near Penrith there is a grotto consisting of two rooms hewn out of a rock, to which the access is very dif∣ficult. In all probability, this was a place of strength and security in former times: for it was
<PB N="289" REF="2980"/>
provided with iron gates, which remained standing not many years ago. On the same river Eden, a little farther to the northward, we see a Danish mo∣nument of seventy-seven stones, each ten feet high, standing in form of a circle, and one before the entrance, fifteen feet in height; within the circle are two heaps of stones, or tumuli, supposed by some authors to be places of burial, and by others, to be rude heaps, gathered off the ploughed lands, and thrown together in this place, as in a waste corner of the field. The common people distin∣guish the circle by the appellation of Long Meg and her daughters.</P>
<P>On the same river Eden, more northerly, stands the small town of Kirk Oswald, so called, because it was dedicated to St. Oswald, remarkable for no∣thing but an old castle, which is now in ruins. In the course of the same river, are the castles of Ar∣manthwaite, belonging to the Skeltons; Corby, to the Salkelds, who are likewise owners of War∣wick, supposed to be the Virosidum of the Romans, where there is a bridge thrown over the river; Lin∣stock, appertaining to the bishopric of Carlisle; and Wetheral, a little town, where was formerly a small monastery, in the neighbourhood of which we find several hermitages cut out of a rock. Be∣sides these, we may reckon the castle of Graystock, hard by Penrith, the property of the duke of Nor∣folk; and Rose-castle, a beautiful seat belonging to the bishops of Carlisle, upon the edge of Ward forest, washed by the small river Canda.</P>
<P>Brampton is a small market-town, hard by the wall of Severus, near the northern extremity of Cumberland, supposed to be the Brematuracum of the Romans, where the first cohort of the Tungri, from Germany, was quartered. It is now remark∣able for nothing but a variety of old inscriptions and altars found in its neighbourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="2990"/>
Bou'ness, the Blatum Bulgium of the Romans, is situated on the Solway Firth, at the extremity of the province, where Antoninus begins his Itine∣rary. It was formerly a town of note, fortified against the incursions of the Scots, who used to wade over the Fifth at low water: at present it is an inconsiderable village, yet remarkable for the monuments of antiquity which have been discovered in the adjacent fields, as well as for the wall of Severus, which begins at the distance of a mile from this place.</P>

<HEAD>WESTMORELAND. Its BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>Westmoreland is a small inland county, bound∣ed on the east by part of Yorkshire, and the bishop∣ric of Durham; on the south by Lancashire; and on the west and north by Cumberland. It extends thirty miles in length, and four and twenty in breadth, comprehending thirty-two parishes, eight market-towns, a considerable number of villages, about seven thousand houses, and about five and thirty thousand inhabitants. It is divided into the two great baronies of Westmoreland and Kendal; the former belonging to the diocese of Carlisle, and the latter to the bishopric of Chester. It was of old inhabited by the Brigantes; it afterwards con∣stituted part of the Northumbrian kingdom; and now gives title of earl to the noble family of Fane.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, FORESTS, LAKES, RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>Westmoreland is one of the most mountainous countries in England, particularly the barony of Kendal, which abounds in hills and fells, moors and rocks, besides the great ridge of mountains
<PB N="291" REF="3000"/>
that separate this province from Yorkshire. Among the mountains of this county, one of the most re∣markable is called Isanparles, extremely high and difficult of access, famous for being, as it were, scooped into divers caverns and labyrinths, which seem to have been formed as retreats in times of trouble and calamity. The county produces plenty of wood, both on the mountains and plains, espe∣cially on the ridges of the river Lone and the Winander-mere; and in the forests of Whinfield, on the peninsula between the rivers Eimot and Eden; in that of Martindale, extending the whole length of Ulles water; as well as in those of Thornth∣waite, Mallersland, Melborn, and Meldon, be∣sides a great number of parks and plantations.</P>
<P>The largest lake in England is the Winander∣mere of this county, lying among the mountains on the borders of Cumberland, stretching ten miles in length, of a very considerable depth, having a rocky bottom, studded with several ver∣dant isles or holmes, and abounding with the deli∣cate fish called char, which, being potted and pre∣served, is sent in presents from hence to all parts of England. It is swelled by the small rivers Ruthey and Brathey, which fall into it, and by its commu∣nication with a chain of small lakes called Gresmere. The most considerable rivers of this county are the Eden, the Can, the Lone, and the Loder. The Eden, or Ituna, we have already described in our account of Cumberland, between which and West∣moreland it runs, forming part of the boundary. The Can, Ken, or Kent, deriving its origin from the small lake called Kent-mere, in the neighbour∣hood of Ambleside, is, by the addition of two large brooks, swelled into a considerable stream before it arrives at Kendal; after a brawling and rugged course among rocks, it falls into the sea on the bor∣ders of Lancashire. It abounds with fish, and
<PB N="292" REF="3010"/>
is remarkable for two cataracts at Levens and Betham. The Lone, or Lune, rises near Mallers∣land forest, on the east side of the county, giving name to the tract called Lonsdale. Being swelled by several rivulets, and the two small rivers Birk∣beck and Burrow, it becomes a considerable stream near Howgill, runs in a southern direction parallel to the borders of Yorkshire, waters Kirkby Lons∣dale, enters Lancashire, and joining the river Kend∣born, falls into the sea at Overton. The Loder, or Lowther, is a pure transparent stream, taking its rise from the Broad-water, near I hornth waite∣hall, in the north-west part of the county, and falling into the river Eimot at Penrith. This river hath given the name to the antient family of Lowther.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, WATER, PRODUCTIONS, MINERALS, VEGETABLES, ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The air of Westmoreland is keen and salubrious; but the climate is moist, consequently not very agreeable. With respect to fertility, the barony of Kendal is mountainous, therefore not so fit for tillage as for pasture: but the other part, properly called Westmoreland, is an open champaign coun∣try, which, if well cultivated, would be fruitful in both. Besides the water of the common fountains and rivers, which is pure, agreeable, and fit for all the usual purposes, this county affords some springs of peculiar qualities. In Betham-park there is the Dropping-well, in which moss, wood, and leaves are petrified. On the north side of Jeffrey∣mount there is a small spring called Goudsike, which continually throws up small spangles that glitter like silver. In the neighbourhood of Burrow, up∣on Stanemore, the inhabitants have discovered a chalybeate fountain.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="3020"/>
In all probability, the mountains of Westmore∣land are well stored with minerals, though no mines are worked in this county: yet here is plenty of coal for fuel. The county produces considera∣ble crops of corn and hay, together with many plants not commonly found in the neighbouring provinces: among these we reckon <HI>Adianthum per∣pusillum foliis bifidis, allium montanum flore purpureo, bistoria minima, cerasus avium, cerasus minimus syl∣vestris fructu cordiformi, chamaecystus folio pelosellae, gentian lla verna seu precox, geranium flore varie∣gato, geranium montanum,</HI> different genera of the <HI>filex. Gladiolus lacustris, gramen spica graminea, kelleborine minor flore albo,</HI> divers kinds of the <HI>hieracium, rubia erecta quadrifolia, salix folio laureo, odorato, &amp; viola latea grandi flora montana.</HI> The animal productions of this county are in all respects the same as those we have described in Cum∣berland, particularly great plenty of game, and vast flocks of sheep that feed upon the moors or commons, from whence the province derives its name.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Westmoreland exhibits some monuments of Ro∣man, as well as of British antiquity. At Amble∣side, near Winander-mere, supposed by some to be the Amboglana of the Romans, we see the ruins of an old city, and here several medals of gold, silver, and copper, have been dug out of the ground. Brough under Stanemore, imagined to be the antient Verterae, is situated on a Roman highway. At Whelp-castle, near Kirkby Thore, appear the ruins of an old town, thought to be Gal∣latum, where we see considerable remains of anti∣quity. Hard by Kirkby Thore begins the old causeway, called the Maiden way, which runs
<PB N="294" REF="3030"/>
about twenty miles from hence to Caer-vorran, in the neighbourhood of the great wall. Near the conflux of the Lowther and Eimot, there is a cir∣cular mound, known by the appellation of <HI>Arthur's round table,</HI> secured on the inside by a trench, and supposed to have been a kind of lists, or amphithe∣atre, for tournament or wrestling. Hard by this monument, there is a heap of rude stones piled up in form of a horseshoe, called Mayburgh, where a peace is said to have been established in the tenth century, between Athelstan, king of Northum∣berland, Constantine, king of Scotland, and divers other princes. Near Whelp-castle we see the re∣mains of ditches, ramparts, and mounds of earth, among which several stones have been found with Roman inscriptions. There are besides divers re∣mains of Saxon and Danish monuments. In the northern part of the county we see a pillar erected, with an inscription by Anne, countess dowager of Pembroke, in memory of her parting at this place from her mother the countess dowager of Cumber∣land, in the year 1616.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>Westmoreland is too mountainous to be full of people: nevertheless, the level country is well in∣habited by a stout, rugged, hardy race, who are either employed in breeding and feeding sheep and cattle, in coal-digging, or in the woollen manufac∣ture of cloths and stockings. The farmers are either poorer, or less skilful in agriculture here, than in any other county of England: for there are very few inclosures, except those belonging to noblemen and gentlemen of fortune, and those we see are made with loose stones, without lime or mortar. This nakedness of the country, however, gives the better effect to the seats of the gentry, of which
<PB N="295" REF="3040"/>
there is a considerable number in this district, ele∣gant and delightful. Among these we reckon Pendragon-castle, about twelve miles from Apple∣by, belonging to the earl of Thanet, hereditary sheriff of the county: Beltham-castle, at the distance of seven miles from Kendal, a seat of the earl of Derby; and Lowther hall, near Ulles water, possessed by the lord viscount Lonsdale. There are besides several antient castles, from whence several families have taken their names, such as Musgrave, Wharton, Warcop, and Langdale.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TOWNS and PLACES.</HEAD>
<P>The most remarkable places in Westmoreland are Appleby, Shap, Kirkby Stephen, Orton, Am∣bleside, Kendal, Kirkby Lonsdale, Burton, and Milthorpe. Appleby, the Aballaba of the Ro∣mans, is now an inconsiderable market-town, built in a Roman military road still visible, situated in an agreeable plain, on the banks of the river Eden. It was even after the conquest a place of considerable note, favoured by the kings of Eng∣land with immunities equal to those of the city of York: at present, however, nothing of its antient splendour remains, nor is it important for any thing but the assizes, which are held in the town-hall, and a considerable weekly market for corn. The houses are generally mean, and the place is thinly inha∣bited; but it still boasts of one spacious street run∣ning from north to south, with an easy ascent, at the top of which stands the castle belonging to the earl of Thanet, almost surrounded by the river. At the lower end of the town appears the only re∣maining church, and hard by is a school house, built by Robert Langton, and since endowed by Dr. Thomas Smith, bishop of Carlisle, and other
<PB N="296" REF="3050"/>
benefactors. In the reign of Richard II. Appleby was taken and destroyed by the Scots, and ever since that period it hath remained almost desolate and dismembered one street from another. In the sixteenth century it likewise suffered by a pestilence, and in all probability will never recover any great degree of importance. The misfortunes to which it hath been exposed by the enemy and the plague, are recorded in a Latin inscription upon a stone set up in the garden of the school house.</P>
<P>Shap or Hep is now a small village to the south∣west of Appleby, once famous for a monastery founded by Thomas, the son of Gospatrick; at present remarkable for nothing but a monument of antiquity, consisting of pyramidal stones, nine feet high, and some of them fourteen feet in thick∣ness, placed almost in a direct line, at equal distances, for the length of a mile.</P>
<P>Kirk by-Stephen, situated on the river Eden, is a considerable market-town, noted for a free school founded by the family of Wharton, and a manu∣facture of yarn stockings.</P>
<P>Orton is another market-town, situated about the middle of the county, near the source of the Lone, remarkable for nothing but a beacon set up within the limits of the town on a hill in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Ambleside is also a market-town, on the west side of the county, near Winander-mere, supported by the cloth manufacture, and well supplied with provisions. It was antiently a large city, as ap∣pears by the ruins of old walls and buildings; and here was a large Roman fort, surrounded by a ditch and rampart, still visible. The supposition of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s having been a Roman work, is confirmed by a number of small urns, glass vials, Roman coins, parts of columns, and paved ways, which have been discovered in and about Ambleside, which an∣tiquarians
<PB N="297" REF="3060"/>
suppose to have been the head-quarters of the <HI>cohors prima Aelia dacorum;</HI> yet there are some strong objections to the opinion, that this was the Amboglana of the Romans, which the <HI>Notitia</HI> places <HI>ad Lineam Valli,</HI> whereas this is not near the wall. At the distance of a short mile to the north of Ambleside, stands the antient house of Ridal∣hall, belonging to the family of Fleming, who have possessed it since the reign of Henry IV.</P>
<P>Kendal, Candale, deriving its name from the river Can, on the banks of which it is situated, and over which the inhabitants have thrown three bridges, is a large trading town towards the south edge of the county, ruled by a mayor, twelve al∣dermen, and twenty-four burgesses, consisting of two large streets crossing each other. Here are several trading companies, namely, mercers, sheer∣men, cordwainers, tanners, glovers, taylors, and pewterers; and each of these has a hall, where they assemble. The church is large and spacious; but the inhabitants are so numerous, that it is found ne∣cessary to have twelve chapels besides. Near the church is a free school, well endowed. At a little distance from one of the bridges, which is of wood, we see the ruins of an old castle, the birth place of Katharine Par, the last wife of king Henry VIII. At Kendal a great weekly market is held on Saturdays. The people are wealthy and industrious, employing themselves in different branches of the woollen ma∣nufacture, which was here established by certain Flemings as far back as the reign of Edward III. who encouraged them to settle here, as well as at Colchester in Essex. Kendal is still famous for its cottons, drug∣gets, serges, hats, and stockings of worsted and yarn.</P>
<P>Kirk by Lonsdale is a market-town, situated on the banks of the river Lone, near the south-east extre∣mity of the county, remarkable for nothing but
<PB N="298" REF="3070"/>
giving the title of viscount to the Lowther family, and being the native place of John de Kirkby, bishop of Carlisle, who defeated an army of Scots that invaded England in the fourteenth century.</P>
<P>Burton is another market-town, standing on the southern border of Westmoreland, of which we can say nothing that deserves the reader's attention. The village of Clifton, in the northern part of this county, was rendered remarkable for a skirmish be∣tween a detachment of British dragoons, and a party of the rebel army, in the year 1745, in which the former were severely handled.</P>
<P>Milthorpe, situated on the river Can, is the only sea-port of this county, to which commodities of different kinds are imported in small vessels from Lancashire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANCASHIRE. Its SITUATION and EXTENT.</HEAD>
<P>The county palatine of Lancaster is a large ma∣ritime province, washed by the Irish sea on the west, bordering on the north with part of Cumber∣land and Westmoreland, bounded on the east by the West Riding of Yorkshire, and on the west by Cheshire, extending forty-five miles in length from north to south, and thirty-two miles in breadth from east to west; comprehending six hundreds, sixty parishes, twenty-seven market towns, and about two hundred and forty thousand inhabitants.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, FORESTS, RIVERS, LAKES, FOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>The eastern parts of the province are rocky, and in the northern districts we see many single moun∣tains remarkably high, such as Ingleborough-hill,
<PB N="299" REF="3080"/>
Cloughbo-hill, Pendle-hill, and Longridge-hill. Nor is there any want of wood in this county, either for timber or fuel; witness Wiersdale forest and Bowland forest, to the northward, and Simon's wood in the southern part of Lancashire.</P>
<P>This county is well watered with rivers and lakes. Among the former we number the Mersey, the Ribble, the Wire, the Lon, the Ken, and the Irke. The Mersey springs among the mountains of Derby∣shire, is swelled by several streams, winds along the borders of Lancashire, which it divides from Cheshire, and runs into the sea at Liverpool. The Ribble, rising in Yorkshire, enters this county at Clithero, washes the town of Preston, and having received the smaller streams of the Hadder, the Whalley, the Darwent, and the Lea, disembogues itself into the Irish sea at Lethum. The Wire is a continuation of the Calder, which derives its source from the forest of Wiersdale, in the northern part of the county, and being augmented by divers smaller streams, runs into the sea at Cokerham. The Lon, and the Ken or Can, we have already de∣scribed in our account of Westmoreland. The Irke is an inconsiderable rivulet, that forms the beginning of the Irwel and Mersey, which are its continuations; and is noted for producing the fattest eels in England.</P>
<P>Among the lakes or meres of Lancashire, we reckon the Winander-mere, already mentioned in the article of Westmoreland, the Keningston-mere, which though neither so large nor so well stored with fish, yet affords plenty of excellent char, supposed to be a kind of Alpine trout. There was on the south side of the Ribble another lake called Marton, several miles in circumference, which is now drain∣ed, and converted into pasture ground. In this operation, the workmen found a great quantity of fish, together with eight canoes, resembling those
<PB N="300" REF="3090"/>
of America, supposed to have been used by the antient British fishermen. Besides these meres or lakes, this county abounds with morasses and mosses, from which the inhabitants dig excellent peat or turf for fuel, as well as marle for manuring the ground, and trunks of old fir trees, supposed to have lain there since the general deluge. Some of these are so impregnated with turpentine, that when divided into splinters, they burn like candles, and are used for that purpose by the common people. There is a great variety of mineral waters in this county, some periodical springs, and one instance of a violent eruption of water at Kirk by in Fourness. The most remarkable chalybeate spaws are those of Latham Wigan, Stockport, Burnley, Bolton, Plumpton, Middleton, Strangeways, Lancaster, Larbrick, and Chorly. At Ancliff, in the neighbourhood of Wigan, is a fountain called the Burning Well, from whence a bituminous vapour exhales, which being set on fire by a candle burns like brandy, so as to produce a degree of heat that will boil eggs to a hard consistence, while the water itself retains its origi∣nal coldness. There is at Barton a fountain of salt∣water, so strongly impregnated with the mineral, as to yield six times as much as can be extracted from the same quantity of sea water. At Rogham, in Fourness, there is a purging saline fountain; and in the neighbourhood of Rassal, where the ground is frequently overflowed by the sea, a stream de∣scends from Hagbur-hills, which, in the space of seven years, is said to convert the marle into a hard freestone fit for building.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, MINERAL, VEGE∣TABLE, and ANIMAL.</HEAD>
<P>The air of Lancashire is pure, healthy, and agreeable, except among the fens and on the sea∣shore,
<PB N="301" REF="3100"/>
where the atmosphere is loaded with putrid exhalations producing malignant and intermitting fevers, scurvy, rheumatism, dropsy, and consump∣tion. The soil is various in different parts of the county, poor and rocky on the hills, fat and fer∣tile in the valleys, and champaign country. The colour of the peat is white, grey, or black, ac∣cording to the nature of the composition and the degree of putrefaction which the ingredients have undergone. There is a bituminous earth about Ormskirk, that smells like the oil of amber, and indeed yields an oil of the same nature, both in its scent and medicinal effects, which moreover re∣duces raw flesh to the consistence of mummy: this earth burns like a torch, and is used as such by the country people. The metals and minerals of this county consist of lead, iron, copper, antimony, black lead, lapis calaminaris, spar, green vitriol, allum, sulphur, pyrites, freestone, coal, and can∣nel, which is of the same species, but burns much clearer, is capable of receiving a fine polish, and often formed into snuff-boxes, cups, and candle∣sticks.</P>
<P>With respect to vegetables, Lancashire does not fall short of any English county which we have described. The level country produces plenty of wheat and barley; and the skirts of the hills yield good harvests of excellent oats: very good hemp is raised in divers parts of the province; and the pasture which grows in the vallies, is so peculiarly rich, that the cattle which feed upon it are much larger and fatter than in any other part of England.</P>
<P>Among the remarkable vegetables of this coun∣ty, we reckon the <HI>chamaemorus,</HI> a kind of dwarf mulberry that grows on the top of Pendle-hill; the <HI>asphodelus Lancastriae verus,</HI> with the flower of which the women used to colour their hair; the <HI>bi∣folium minimum</HI> found among the heath on different
<PB N="302" REF="3110"/>
hills; the <HI>cerasus sylvestris fructu minimo cordiformi,</HI> growing about Bury and Manchester; the <HI>cochlea∣ria marina folio anguloso parvo,</HI> abounding in the isle of Walney; <HI>conyza helenitis foläs lacinatis,</HI> filling the ditches about Pillinmoss; <HI>crithmum spinosum,</HI> a kind of prickly samphire, observed by Lawson at Roofbeck in Low Fourness; <HI>echium marinum,</HI> or sea bugloss, growing plentifully over against Big∣ger in the isle of Walney; <HI>eruca monensis laciniata lutea,</HI> found between marsh Grange and the isle of Walney; <HI>geranium haematodes Lancastrense,</HI> near the sea-shore in the same island; <HI>juncus alpinus cum cau∣da leporina,</HI> in different mosses; <HI>ros marinum pur∣pureum,</HI> on the banks of the river Chalder; and <HI>tormentilla quadrifolia radice rotunda,</HI> near Wigan.</P>
<P>There is not any part of the world better supplied than Lancashire with provisions of all kinds at a very reasonable rate; such as beef, veal, mutton, lamb, pork, poultry, and game of all sorts, caught upon the moors, heaths, and commons in the hilly part of the shire. Besides the sea-fowl common to the shires of England, such as ducks, easterlings, teal, and plover, many uncommon birds are ob∣served on the coast of Lancashire, the sea-crow variegated with blue and black, the puffin, the asper, the sparling fisher, the cormorant, the curlew, the razor-bill, the copped wren, the red-shanks, the perr, the swan, the tropic bird, the king's fisher, and heigho.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>Lancashire was erected into a county-palatine by Edward III. who conferred it as an appenage on his son John of Ghaunt, thence called duke of Lan∣caster: but the dutchy contained lands that are not in Lancashire, and among other demesnes, the pa∣lace of the Savoy, and all that district in London,
<PB N="303" REF="3120"/>
which indeed belong to it at this day. The reve∣nues of this dutchy are administered by a court which sits at Westminster, and a chancery court at Preston, which has a seal distinct from that of the county-palatine. The title of Lancaster distinguish∣ed the posterity of John of Ghaunt from those of his brother, who succeeded to the dutchy of York, in their long and bloody contest for the crown of England.</P>
<P>Lancashire sends two members to parliament for the county; and twelve for the six boroughs of Lancaster, Preston, Newton, Wigan, Clithero, and Liverpool.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BOROUGHS.</HEAD>
<P>Lancaster, the county-town, supposed to be the Longovicum of the antients, is situated on the south bank of the Lon, near its mouth, and is provided with a stately bridge over this river, consisting of five arches. It has likewise a castle, where the as∣sizes are held; and part of it is converted into a pri∣son. The town is governed by a mayor, recorder, seven aldermen, two bailiffs, four and twenty burgesses, and a town-clerk. The burgesses were favoured by king John with all the privileges he had before granted to those of Bristol; and Ed∣ward III. gave them the power to hold the sessions of the county. They have a market every Wed∣nesday and Saturday, and three annual fairs, April 20, June 24, and September 29. Every second Wednesday throughout the year, is a market for cattle. As the harbour admits of pretty large ves∣sels, there is a considerable commerce carried on from thence to our colonies in America: they ex∣port hardware and woollen manufactures; and make returns of sugar and rum. This traffic em∣ploys
<PB N="304" REF="3130"/>
a good number of hands, so that the corpo∣ration is populous and flourishing.</P>
<P>Preston is situated upon the Ribble, which plen∣tifully supplies it with fish, and over which there is an ample stone bridge. This town is governed by a mayor, recorder, eight aldermen, four under aldermen, seventeen common-council men, and a town-clerk. It is situated on an agreeable emi∣nence, large, airy, well-built, and extensive; has three markets in the week, and five annual fairs. The officers belonging to the chancery of the coun∣ty palatine of Lancaster reside in this town, and a good deal of other company, who give the place an air of gaiety. There are horse-races in the neighbourhood; and the town is remarkable for having every years a jubilee, to which great numbers of people resort from different parts of the kingdom. The town was incorporated by Henry II. and its privileges were confirmed by se∣veral successive monarchs. It has a charity-school well endowed. The place is famous for the defeat of duke Hamilton in the year 1648, when he marched hither with an army of Scots to deliver king Charles I. from his imprisonment. Here al∣so the rebels were attacked and surrendered to the king's troops in the year 1715, on the very day that the duke of Argyle fought the battle of Dum∣blaine in Scotland. On the whole, tho' Preston is not remarkable for commerce, it is an agreeable retreat, abounding with excellent provisions and all the necessaries of life, which may be had on very easy terms, every article of house-keeping being much cheaper here than in many other parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Newton is an ancient borough governed by a steward, bailiff, and burgesses. It has no market, but four annual fairs; and its two members of par∣liament are returned by the steward of the lord of
<PB REF="3140"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A View of Liverpool.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="305" REF="3150"/>
the manor. It is remarkable for nothing but a charity school endowed by one Hornby a yeoman, and for standing in the parish of Winwic, which is one of the best benefices in England, worth above eight hundred pounds per annum.</P>
<P>Wigan, or Wiggin, is a handsome town stand∣ing near the source of the rivulet Dugless: it was erected into a corporation by king Henry I. go∣verned by a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, and two bailiffs; has two markets in the week, and three annual fairs. The church is well en∣dowed, and the rector is always lord of the manor. The place is populous, and drives a considerable trade in the manufacture of coverlets, blankets, rugs, as well as pit-coal and iron-work.</P>
<P>Clithero is an ancient borough by prescription, governed by two bailiffs: it stands at the bottom of Penrith-hill, not far from the rise of the Rib∣ble; has a market every Saturday, and three an∣nual fairs. There are horse-races frequent on the adjacent moor; but, on the whole, the place is very inconsiderable.</P>
<P>Liverpool, Litherpool, or Lirpool, is a flou∣rishing sea-port, situated at the mouth of the river Mersee, which abounds with salmon, cod-fish, turbot, plaice, smelts, and flounders, and at high water is above two miles over. The town, which was incorporated by king John, is governed by a mayor, recorder, aldermen without limitation, forty common-council men, and burgesses, the number of whom exceeds fifteen hundred. The freemen of Liverpool have the same privileges at Bristol, in England, and at Waterford and Wex∣ford, in Ireland. Here are markets on Wednes∣day and Saturday, and every second Wednesday there is a market for all kinds of cattle. Their annual fairs are on the twenty-fifth of June, the twenty-second of July, and eleventh of Novem∣ber.
<PB N="306" REF="3160"/>
The town, within these fifty years, has been very considerably enlarged with a number of spa∣cious streets built of noble brick houses. Here are three large churches and several meeting-houses for dissenters; an elegant town-house and ex∣change under it; a noble wet dock or bason with iron flood-gates, made at a great expence, and ca∣pable of containing eighty or an hundred sail of ships: adjoining to it is a large commodious cus∣tom-house; and the entrance to the dock is se∣cured by two stone piers carried out into the open harbour. Liverpool is a city of merchants and manufacturers, who trade to all parts of the world except the East-Indies, particularly to America and the coast of Guinea. It has likewise a consi∣derable inland trade by means of the river Mersee, which is navigable almost up to Warrington. The Liverpool traders deal in all kinds of com∣modities, and their commerce already rivals if not exceeds that of Bristol; of consequence the town must be extremely populous. On the south side of the harbour, there is an old castle built by king John, and on the west a tower by the river Mer∣see: there are also some occasional batteries erected for the defence of the shipping; but the town is altogether open and unfortified. Here are several alms-houses for the widows of sailors and others, a well regulated work-house for employing the poor, and a noble charity school, where fifty boys and twelve girls are taught and maintained by vo∣luntary contributions. Liverpool lies in a central situation, between the coast of Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and the isle of Man, besides its stand∣ing remarkably commodious for an inland trade with Cheshire, Staffordshire, and other parts in the north of England. Besides the Mersee there is the South channel or river Weaver, which is navigable, and chiefly used for the inland con∣veyance

of Cheshire cheese, and rock salt, a mi∣neral which is dug in this county as well as in Cheshire, and sent all over England. This being dissolved in sea-water and boiled up, produces a very strong salt, which may be used in curing her∣rings.</P>
<P>Warrington situated on the Mersee, over which there is here a noble stone bridge, is an old town, large, rich, and populous, with a considerable market every Wednesday, in consequence of a grant from king Edward I. It gives the title of earl to the family of Booth; and has two annual fairs. The river abounds with lampreys, eels, soles, lobsters, oysters, shrimps, prawns, cockles, and muscles in such plenty, that they are used in manuring the ground. It likewise affords mullets, greenbacks, and sturgeon. The town is famous for its malt and beer; and has a particular market every week for linnen and huckaback, which is made in great quantity in this neighbourhood. Here is a charity school for twenty-four boys, who are taught and cloathed out of an estate given for this purpose, by Peter Leigh, of Lyme, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>
<P>Warrington, lying on the high road to Carlisle and Scotland, has been always deemed an impor∣tant post, and secured accordingly by the king's troops, during rebellions and incursions in the North.</P>
<P>Manchester, though no more than a village, go∣verned by a constable or head borough, is neverthe∣less one of the most flourishing places in Eng∣land, large, opulent, well built, and so populous, that the number of its inhabitants are said to ex∣ceed fifty thousand. It is situated near the con∣flux of the Irk and the Irwell, about three miles from the Mersee, one hundred and sixty-six miles north from London. It has a market every Sa∣turday, and three annual fairs, on Whit-Monday,
<PB N="308" REF="3180"/>
on September 20, and November 6. It bestows the title of duke on a branch of the house of Montague. It stands upon a hill, has noble quar∣ries in the neighbourhood, where is likewise Ker∣sal-moor, noted for horse-races.</P>
<P>Manchester is adorned with handsome streets, a venerable old collegiate church supported by three rows of pillars, remarkable for its choir, carved work, and curious clock; an handsome new church built by subscription; and a stone bridge over the Irwell, the arches of which are extreme∣ly high on account of the nature of the river, which, descending from the mountainous part of the country, sometimes rises four or five yards in one night. It has likewise a spacious market-place, and an elegant exchange. The three most re∣markable foundations at Manchester, are the col∣lege, hospital, and public school. The college was founded in the year 1422, by the lord Dela∣ware: it was dissolved by Edward VI. partly re∣stored by Mary, and founded anew by queen Elizabeth; it consists of one warden, four fel∣lows, two chaplains, four singing men, and four choiristers. Having suffered in its revenues by the mal practices of its warden, it was finally re-esta∣blished by Charles I. and by an act of parliament passed in the late reign, the king is impowered to be visitor of this collegiate church, as often as the warden or it happens to be bishop of Chester.</P>
<P>The hospital was founded by Humphry Chul∣ham, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and incorporated by king Charles II. for the maintenance of forty poor boys; but it is now greatly enlarged, and provided with a good library. The public school was founded in the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>10, by Dr. Oldham, bishop of Exeter; but the foundation has been considerably enlarged by the oeconomy of the feoffees of the school: the salaries of the masters have been augmented,
<PB N="309" REF="3190"/>
and a third has been added to the former two. Here are besides several charity schools, and an elegant infirmary maintained by voluntary sub∣scription.</P>
<P>Manchester, however, owes all its wealth to the manufactures of fustian, linnen, checques, tick∣ing, and inkle, which the inhabitants have car∣ried on above a century, with remarkable spirit, ingenuity, and success. The place of old enjoyed the privilege of a sanctuary, which by act of parlia∣ment in the reign of Henry VIII. was transferred to Chester.</P>
<P>Rochedale is a trading town standing on the ri∣ver Roch, with one weekly market and two an∣nual fairs. It gives the title of baron to lord Bi∣ron, and carries on a considerable share of the woollen manufacture.</P>
<P>Bury, situated on the Irwell, drives also a good trade in the manufacture of fustian and coarse goods called half-thicks and kerseys: it has one weekly market, and three annual fairs. Here the earl of Derby was beheaded in 1651, for having proclaimed king Charles II during the usurpation of Cromwell. There are medicinal waters in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Kirkham is a small town, having a weekly mar∣ket and an annual fair. It stands near the sea, between the Ribble and another small river some miles south of Lancaster. It has a free school well endowed by Mr. Colbain, a citizen of Lon∣don. On this coast the inhabitants have a method of extracting salt from sea-sand, by gathering it into heaps, which, after they have lain some time, they put into troughs with holes at bottom; then they pour water upon it to dissolve the particles of the mineral it contains: this solution draining thro' the holes in the bottoms of the troughs, is boiled
<PB N="310" REF="3200"/>
up, and affords a considerable quantity of pure salt.</P>
<P>Ormskirk is a neat town that enjoys a conside∣rable inland trade, with a weekly market, and two annual fairs. It is the burial place of the Stan∣leys, earls of Derby, whose seat at Latham, in this neighbourhood, was gallantly defended by the countess Charlotte, during a siege of two years by the parliament's forces in the great rebellion. They were obliged to raise the siege, but after∣wards returned, when it was taken and demolished. Near Ormskirk there is a mineral purging water called Maudlin-well, which, tho' at a considera∣ble distance from the sea, used to throw up great quantities of marine shells, until mill-stones were laid over the spring, in order to keep them down. In this neighbourhood, there is a bituminous earth, which yields a kind of coarse oil which the country people use in lamps instead of candles.</P>
<P>Hawkshead standing on the river Foss, not far from Wigmore-hill, in that part of the county called Fourness, is a considerable town that drives a good trade in the cloth manufacture, and has one market in the week.</P>
<P>Fourness is, properly speaking, the name of a promontory between Hawkshead and the river Dud∣den, separated by a small arm of the sea from the isle of Walney, the entrance to which is de∣fended by an old fort called the pile of Fouldery, built upon a rock in the water, by the abbot of Fourness, in the reign of Edward III. On this promontory we see the ruins of the ancient abbey which was built at the expence of king Stephen, and was the mother of many other monasteries in Ireland and the isle of Man.</P>
<P>Cartmel is a small town among the Cartmel-Fells, near the mouth of the river Ken, with an inconsi∣derable harbour for boats. Here are quicksands
<PB N="311" REF="3210"/>
so very dangerous for travellers, on account of the uncertainty of the tide, which depends in a great measure on the wind that blows, that there is a guide on horseback appointed for each sand by the government, to conduct all those who have occasion to pass over. Cartmel boasts an hand∣some spacious church, and a good market for fish, sheep, and corn. A medicinal spring has been discovered at Wraysholme-tower in this neighbourhood, and the waters of it are said to be efficacious in the gout, stone, worms, and cuta∣neous disorders.</P>
<P>Poulton is a small town situated near the mouth of the river Wire, having a weekly market, some trade, and an inconsiderable pearl fishery.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Manchester is supposed to be the antient <HI>Man∣cunium.</HI> In the neighbourhood are the remains of an old square fort; and some Roman inscriptions have been found in this district. Winwic is be∣lieved to be on the same spot where stood the an∣tient British city Cair Gruntguic. Near Sefton, at Crosby-parva, in a place called Haskerke, se∣veral Saxon coins have been dug up, and the fi∣gures of them published in copper-plate by William Blundel, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>. Roman coins have been found at Colne, and at Brunly not far from Wha∣ley. At the village of Ribble-Chester, a great number of antiquities have been discovered, such as mutilated statues, coins, pillars, pedestals, altars, marbles, and inscriptions; as also at Anchor-hill, in this neighbourhood: but none of these afford any information towards ascertaining the ancient name of the place, which some antiquarians sup∣pose to have been Rigodunum, mentioned by Ptolemy; of which city, however, nothing fur∣ther
<PB N="312" REF="3220"/>
is known. Coccium was the same with Ribble-Chester, from the ruins of which Preston is said to have been built. At a country village called Overburrow, there is a tradition that here stood, between the Lac and the Lon, a great city which was besieged, reduced by famine, and destroyed; but no-body knows by whom, or at what period. The tradition, however, seems to be confirmed by the finding of many Latin inscriptions, tesse∣lated pavements, and Roman coins in this neigh∣bourhood. Cambden imagines it was the <HI>Breme∣tonacum,</HI> mentioned by Antoninus, on account of its distance from Coccium or Ribble-Chester. At Lancaster, the antient Longovicum, Roman coins, disci, and sympuria, or sacrificing cups, have been discovered; and hard by is shewn the area of an antient city, said to have been pillaged and destroyed by the Scots.</P>

situated on a hill by a river. It lies between Northumberland and Yorkshire, being bounded on the west by part of Cumberland and West∣moreland, and on the east washed by the German ocean. It extends thirty-nine miles in length, and thirty-five in breadth, of a triangular shape, the basis being formed by the sea-coast, the area of the whole amounting to nine hundred and fifty∣eight square miles. It contains fifty-two parishes, four wakes, one city, eight market-towns, a con∣siderable number of villages and villas, and about one hundred thousand inhabitants.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and WATER.</HEAD>
<P>The climate of this bishopric varies in different parts. Towards the west, among the inland hills, it is keen, pure, and penetrating; on the sea-side more soft, tho' not so wholesome. It is watered by sixteen rivers, some of which are pretty consi∣derable. The Tyne we have already mentioned in our description of Northumberland. The Tees takes its rise at Stavemore in Cumberland, and being joined by the Laden, Hude, Lune, Bauder, and Skern, waters the south parts of the Bishopric, and falls into the sea below Stockton. The Were rises in the western side of the county, being form∣ed by three little streams called Kellop, Wellop, and Burdop. It receives the Gaunless at Bishop's Auckland, surrounds part of the city of Durham, and disembogues itself in the sea, near Sunderland. Most of these rivers abound with trout, pike, and salmon, and some of them are navigable by boats and lighters.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MINERAL WATERS.</HEAD>
<P>A little below Branspeth, there are some huge stones in the channel of the Were, and if you pour water upon them, it becomes brackish. At the village of Butterby, where the river is low, the
<PB N="314" REF="3250"/>
salt spring bursts from these stones, of a reddish colour, which is used for salt by the country people.</P>
<P>On the other side of the river, there is a medi∣cinal spring impregnated with sulphur; and higher up, near Durham, is a mineral water, on which Dr. Wilson wrote his <HI>Spadacrene Dunelmensis.</HI> Hun∣wick is noted for its sulphureous wells, to which there is a great resort of company.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>FACE of the COUNTRY, SOIL, PRODUCT.</HEAD>
<P>The face of this country is agreeably varied by hill and dale, wood and water; and except in the western part, where there is a great number of naked hills, it generally exhibits the appearance of extraordinary cultivation and fertility. Viewed from the top of Gateshead Fell, it looks like one vast, beautiful garden, interspersed with groves, lawns, meadows, and corn-fields. The soil in the hilly parts must of course be barren; but the plains are remarkably fruitful. It produces corn and cattle in great abundance and perfection. The mountains yield iron, vitriol, and a considerable quantity of lead; and almost every part of the bishopric affords plenty of coal, which employs a great number of hands and vessels, and constitutes a nursery of excellent seamen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS, VEGETABLES, and FRUIT.</HEAD>
<P>The Bishopric has all sorts of cattle in common with other parts of England; horses, cows, oxen, sheep, goats, and hogs; all of a very good breed, in great plenty, and in good condition: nor is it at all deficient in geese, ducks, turkies, pullets, and every kind of poultry; wild ducks, easterlings, teal, and plover, are found on the coast; nor is there any want of woodcocks, snipes, hares, par∣tridges,
<PB N="315" REF="3260"/>
and growse, in the woods and moun∣tains.</P>
<P>Besides the usual vegetables for culinary uses, this country produces some remarkable plants; such as the <HI>buthalmum,</HI> or <HI>chrysant hemum,</HI> near the banks of the Tees, in the neighbourhood of Sayburn; <HI>cerasus sylvestris septentrionalis, fructu parvo ferotino,</HI> on the same river, near Bernard's Castle; <HI>ribes vulgaris fructu rubro,</HI> in the woods here, as well as in Yorkshire and Westmoreland; <HI>pentaphylloides fruticosa,</HI> in different parts of the open country; <HI>muscus coralloides ramosus capitulis magnis,</HI> upon the rocks; <HI>equisetum nudum,</HI> in dry, sandy ground; <HI>camaefilix marina Anglica,</HI> on the rocks near Esington; <HI>vicia pratensis verna seu hexaaedronre ferente moris,</HI> on Blunt's key, near Newcastle; <HI>alsine nemorosa maxima montana,</HI> on the banks of the river Were; <HI>pseudo-asphodelus palustris Scoticus minimus ray,</HI> on the extremity of this county, near Birdale, in Westmoreland; <HI>be∣tula rotundifolia nana,</HI> in a moss near the same place.</P>
<P>The spontaneous fruits of this and the neigh∣bouring counties, are corinths, strawberries, bil∣berries, juniperberries, cranberries, brambleber∣ries, wild cherries, crab-apples, hazlenuts, acorns, sloes, hips, and haws; and the gardens produce plenty of every other kind of fruit, which is raised in the northern parts of Europe; nay, there are many gentlemen of fortune in this Bishopric, whose gardens afford not only peaches and grapes, but even the ananas or pine-apple, which, how∣ever, must be raised by artificial heat at a conside∣rable expence.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>Durham is a county palatine, governed by the bishop, who had formerly great prerogatives. He
<PB N="316" REF="3270"/>
had power to create barons, appoint judges, con∣voke parliaments, raise taxes, and coin money. The courts of justice were kept in his name; and he granted pardons for trespasses, alienations, rapes, murders, and felonies of every denomina∣tion. He erected corporations, granted markets and fairs, created officers by patent, was lord ad∣miral of the seas and waters within the county palatine: great part of the lands were held of the see <HI>in capite.</HI> In a word, he exercised all the power and jurisdiction of a sovereign prince. How, and at what period these prerogatives were obtained, it is not easy to determine. Malmesbury says the lands were granted by king Alfred, who likewise made the church a sanctuary for criminals; but his authority is not infallible. This see was an∣tiently called the patrimony of St. Cuthbert, who had been bishop of Landisfarne or Holy Island, near Berwick. His bones being transferred to Durham, were long esteemed as precious relicks; and the people of the county considered them∣selves as Halwerk men, exempted from all other but holy work, that is, the defence of St. Cuth∣bert's body. Certain it is, they pretended to hold their lands by this tenure, and refused to serve out of the county, either for the king or bishop. Be that as it may, king Edward I. broke through these privileges, and curtailed the prerogatives of the bishops, which were still further abridged by Henry VIII. Nevertheless, the bishop is still earl of Sadberg, a place in this county, which he holds by barony. He is sheriff paramount, and appoints his own deputy, who makes up his audit to him, instead of accounting to the exchequer. He has all the forfeitures upon outlawries; and he and his temporal chancellor act as justices of the peace for the county palatine, which compre∣hends Creke, in Yorkshire, Bedlington, Northam,
<PB N="317" REF="3280"/>
and Holy Island, in Northumberland, the inha∣bitants of these places having benefit of the courts at Durham. The judges of assize and all the of∣ficers of the court, have still their ancient salaries from the bishop; and he constitutes the standing officers by his letters patent. He has the power of presiding in person in any of the courts of judica∣ture. Even when judgment of blood is given, this prelate may sit in court in his purple robes, tho' the canons forbid any clergyman to be present in such cases: hence the old saying, <HI>solum, Dunelmense stola jus dicet et ense.</HI> It was not till the reign of Charles II. that the Bishopric sent representatives to parliament. At present it sends only four; two knights for the shire, and two burgesses for the city of Durham.</P>
<P>Durham, the capital, situated upon a hill al∣most surrounded by the river Were, is considera∣ble for its extent and the number of its inhabi∣tants, as well as for being the see and seat of the bishop, who is lord paramount. It stands about two hundred and eighty miles north from London, being remarkable for the salubrity of its air, and the abundance and cheapness of its provisions. These circumstances have induced a great deal of good company to take up their residence at Dur∣ham, which is still further animated by the pre∣sence and court of the bishop and his clergy. The town is said to have been built about seventy years before the Norman conquest, on occasion of bring∣ing hither the body of St. Cuthbert. It was first incorporated by Richard I. but queen Elizabeth extended its privileges. At length, in the year 1684, it obtained a charter, in consequence of which, it is now governed by a mayor, twelve al∣dermen, twelve common-council men, with a re∣corder, and inferior officers. These can hold a court-leet and court-baron within the city, but under the style of the bishop, who as count pala∣tine
<PB N="318" REF="3290"/>
appoints a judge, steward, sheriffs, and other inferior magistrates. The mayor and aldermen also keep a <HI>pie pouldres</HI> court at their fairs, and pay a yearly toll to the bishop. They have a weekly market on Saturday, and three annual fairs. Dur∣ham is about a mile in length and as much in breadth, resembling the figure of a crab, the mar∣ket-place exhibiting the body, and the claws be∣ing represented by the streets, which bend accord∣ing to the course of the river that almost surrounds one part of the city. They are, moreover, dark and narrow, and some of them lying on the accli∣vity of a steep hill, are very difficult and dange∣rous to wheel carriages. There are two considera∣ble suburbs; one by Elvet bridge, consisting of several small streets; and another called Framgate, leading to Newcastle. The houses are in general strong built, but neither light nor elegant. The most remarkable edifices are the cathedral with six other churches, three standing in the city, and as many in the suburbs; the college; the castle, or bishop's palace; the toll-booth near St. Nicholas's church; the cross and conduit in the market∣place; with two bridges over the Elvet. The cathedral was begun by bishop Carilepho in the eleventh century. It is a large, magnificent, Go∣thic structure, four hundred and eleven feet long, and fourscore in breadth, having a cross isle in the middle one hundred and seventy feet in length, and two smaller ailes at each end. On the south side is a fine cloyster; on the east, the old library, the chapter-house, and part of the deanery; on the west, the dormitory, under which is the trea∣sury and a chantry; and on the west side is the new library, an elegant building begun by dean Sudbury about seventy years ago, on the spot where stood the old refectory of the convent. The middle tower of the cathedral is two hundred and twelve feet high. The whole building is
<PB N="319" REF="3300"/>
arched and supported by huge pillars. Several of the windows are curiously painted; and there is a handsome screen at the entrance into the choir. Sixteen bishops are interred in the chapter-house, which is seventy-five feet long, and thirty-three broad, arched over-head, with a magnificent seat at the upper end for the instalment of the bishops. The consistory is kept in the chapel or west aile called Galilee, which was built by bishop Pudsey, and had formerly sixteen altars for women, as they were not allowed to advance farther than the line of marble by the side of the font; here like∣wise are deposited the bones of the venerable Bede, whose elogium is written on an old parch∣ment scroll that hangs over his tomb. The long cross aile, at the extremity of the church, was for∣merly distinguished by nine altars, four to the north, and four to the south, and the most magni∣ficent in the middle dedicated to the patron St. Cuthbert, whose rich shrine was in this quarter, formerly much frequented by pilgrims. The church is possessed of some old records relating to the affairs of Scotland, the kings of which were great benefactors to this cathedral. The orna∣ments here used for administering the divine offi∣ces, are said to be richer than those of any other cathedral in England. Before the reformation, it was distinguished by the name of <HI>ecclesia sanctae Mariae et sancti Cuthberti;</HI> but it obtained the ap∣pellation of <HI>ecclesia cathedralis christi et beatae Mariae,</HI> in the reign of Henry VIII. who endowed the deanery with twelve prebendaries, twelve minor canons, a deacon, sub-deacon, sixteen lay sing∣ing men, a school-master and usher, a master of the choir, a divinity reader, eight alms-men, eighteen scholars, ten choiristers, two vergers, two porters, two cooks, two butlers, and two sacristans. On the south-side of the cathedral, is the college, a spacious court formed by the houses of the pre∣bendaries,
<PB N="320" REF="3310"/>
who are richly endowed and extremely well lodged. Above the college-gate, at the east-end, is the exchequer; and at the west, a large hall for entertaining strangers, with the granary and other offices of the convent. The college-school, with the master's house, stands on the north side of the cathedral. Between the church-yard and castle, is an open area called the Palace-green, at the west-end of which stands the shire-hall, where the assizes and sessions are held for the county. Hard by is the library built by bishop Cosin, to∣gether with the exchequer raised by bishop Nevil, in which are kept the offices bolonging to the county-palatine-court. There is an hospital on the east, endowed by bishop Cosin, and at each end of it are two schools founded by bishop Langley. On the north, is the castle built by William the Conqueror, and afterwards converted into the bishop's palace, the outward gate of which is, at present, the county-gaol.</P>
<P>The city consists of three manors; the bishop's manor containing the city liberties and the bailey, held of him by the service of castle-guard; the manor of the dean and chapter, consisting of the Elvet's cross gate, South-gate street; and the manor of Gilligate, formerly belonging to the dis∣solved hospital of Kepyar in this neighbourhood, but granted by Edward VI. to John Cockburn, lord of Ormstoun, and late in the possession of John Tempest, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>. The bishopric of Durham is one of the best in England, not only on account of its ample revenues and prerogatives, but be∣cause living is remarkably cheap in this county, and the bishop has a great number of rich bene∣fices in his gift.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of this city is Nevil's cross, famous for the battle fought in the year 1346, against David Bruce, king of Scotland, who was defeated and taken.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="3320"/>
The other considerable towns in this bishopric are these:</P>
<P>Barnard's-castle, situated on the north-side of the river Tees, built by Barnard Baliol, ancestor of John Baliol, king of Scotland. The castle was in the reign of Richard III. erected into a college for a dean, twelve secular canons, ten clerks, and six choiristers. The town, though ancient, is well built, consisting of one large airy street, from which several lanes are detached on both sides. It has a weekly market, and an an∣nual fair; carries on a considerable manufacture of stockings, bridles, and belts; is remarkable for good bread, and gives the title of baron to the house of Vane.</P>
<P>Marwood is a small town on the same river, with a weekly market, and a good share of the stocking manufacture.</P>
<P>Darlington is an agreeable town, well peopled, situated on the small river Skern, over which there is a stone-bridge. It has a weekly market, and an annual fair; carries on a very considerable manu∣facture of huckaback, and linnen; and is a great thoroughfare between London and Newcastle. It has a handsome church, and a spacious market place; but as the streets are not paved, they are very dirty in the winter. At Oxenhall, a hamlet in this neighbourhood, are three pits, called Hell∣kettles, supposed to be the effect of an earth∣quake, to be very deep, and to communicate with the river Tees, which receives the Skern not far from this place: but, in all probability, they are no other than coal-pits filled with subterraneous wa∣ter. The Skern is famous for its pikes, as well as for the quality of its water, which is counted excellent for bleaching linnen.</P>
<P>Sadberg is a village between Darlington and Stockton, remarkable for nothing but giving the
<PB N="322" REF="3330"/>
title of earl to the bishop of Durham. When, or how, or wherefore, this title was conferred, it is not easy to explain.</P>
<P>Stockton is a corporation town governed by a mayor and aldermen. It stands upon the Tees, about two leagues from the mouth of that river, which abounds with salmon, and is navigable to this place. The town is well built and agreeable, with a good weekly market, and an annual fair that lasts four days. Provisions are in such plenty, and living so cheap in Stockton, that many fa∣milies of small fortunes have here fixed their ha∣bitation. The place is famous for its ale, and be∣gins to be both populous and rich; for the inha∣bitants drive a considerable trade with London for lead, butter, and bacon. It holds of the bishop as lord of the manor.</P>
<P>Hartlepool is a small town, but a very ancient corporation, governed by a mayor and his bre∣thren. It stands on a promontory almost sur∣rounded by the sea, about six miles above the mouth of the Tees, having a very commodious and safe harbour, to which the colliers, in their voyages between London and Newcastle, have often recourse in tempestuous weather. Hartle∣pool has a weekly market, which was formerly considerable, but it is now much diminished; and the inhabitants subsist chiefly by fishing, and the money spent by the vessels that use the harbour.</P>
<P>Sunderland is a populous borough and sea-port, situated on the south bank of the river Were, and almost surrounded at high water. The town is well built, and adorned by an elegant church. But the harbour being barred up, admits not vessels of any burthen. Nevertheless, a great quantity of coal is here shipped for London. The ships, however, are obliged to be in the open road, which is very dangerous riding: but this
<PB N="323" REF="3340"/>
danger contributes towards forming a very hardy and expert race of seamen, for which the place is famous. It gives the title of earl to the family of Spencer, who are likewise dukes of Marl∣borough.</P>
<P>South-Shields is a village situated on the south side of the river Tyne, at its mouth, opposite to North-Shields, which we have mentioned in our description of Northumberland. Here a good number of ship-masters, seamen, and others, belonging to the coal trade, reside with their fa∣milies. The place is also noted for its salt works, consisting of above two hundred pans for boiling the sea water, which are said to consume annually one hundred thousand chaldron of coals; a branch of manufacture which must employ a great num∣ber of hands. There are several glass-houses in this neighbourhood, the workmen of which are said to be of foreign extraction, and to speak a language peculiar to themselves. According to tradition, their ancestors were Normans, removed hither from Sturbridge, in the reign of Edward VI. This is a fact that might be easily ascertained by any one, who compares their language with that which was formerly spoken in Normandy.</P>
<P>Jarrow, formerly Gervey, the birth-place of the venerable Bede, is a very inconsiderable vil∣lage on the same river, a little above South-Shields. Here was a Benedictine monastery found∣ed in the reign of Egfrid, as appears by an in∣scription on the wall. Bede was a monk of this convent, and here died in the year 734; but his body was afterwards removed to Durham. In consequence of his great reputation, the monas∣tery flourished, being very rich and extensive, when it was destroyed by the Danes. In the se∣quel the monks were transferred to Durham; and this was also the fate of those belonging to
<PB N="324" REF="3350"/>
the friery of Monksweremouth, situated near Sun∣derland, from whence the monks were translated in the year 10<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3, in order to attend the body of St. Cuthbert, when bishop Carilepho removed it from Lindisfarne to Durham.</P>
<P>Gate-side, or rather Goat's-head, supposed to be the Gabrosentum of the Romans, is no other than a suburb to Newcastle, with which it is con∣nected by the bridge over the Tyne. It consists of one street, built on the declivity of a hill, which is so steep as to be very troublesome to wheel-carriages. Here was formerly a monastery dedicated to St. Edmund.</P>
<P>Auckland Bishops, commonly called Bishop's Auckland, is a market-town agreeably situated on an eminence, near the conflux of the Were, with the rivulet Gaunless. It is supposed to derive its name from a forest of oaks belonging to a palace, or castle, which the bishop has in this district. The air of this town is counted very salutary. The houses are generally well built. The church, which was formerly collegiate, is a venerable building; and there is a massy stone bridge over the Were, which was built at the expence of bishop Skerlaw. The castle was built, or im∣proved, in the reign of Edward I. by bishop Beck, who enlarged and beautified the great hall, and added a chapel for a dean and six prebendaries, who were lodged in the quadrangle, on the west side of the castle. The gate of the college, and other adjoining buildings, were added by bishop Booth, in the reign of Henry VI. so that it be∣came a magnificent palace. But in the civil war it was demolished by Sir Arthur Haslerig, one of the parliament's generals, who built a new house with the materials. This, however, was pulled down in its turn by bishop Cosins, who added a large apartment to what remained of the old
<PB N="325" REF="3360"/>
palace, and erected a new chapel, in which he lies interred.</P>
<P>Stanhope, in Weresdale, is a small market∣town, with a large park, famous for being the spot where the Scottish army encamped in the reign of Edward III. whose quarters were beat up in the night by lord Douglas, who penetrated even to the royal tent, and had well nigh made the king his prisoner.</P>
<P>Sedgefield is a very small market-town, situated near the river Skerne, between Durham and Stock∣ton. It has an annual fair, and an alms-house; but is a place of little consideration.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>ROMAN ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Fragments of a Roman highway are seen in different parts of this county; particularly in the neighbourhood of Bernard's castle, Stainton, Strith∣lam, Chester-le-street, and Benchester. Several Roman coins have been found at Chester-le-street. An altar, with an inscription, was dug up at Percebridge; and adjoining to the bridge is the area of an old Roman fortification. Hard by se∣veral coins and urns have been discovered, toge∣ther with a stone coffin, containing a human ske∣leton. At Binchester, a small village of two or three houses situated on the top of a hill, are the remains of the ancient city Binovium, or Vino∣vium, consisting of ruined walls, and heaps of rubbish, among which several urns and altars, with inscriptions, have been found, and many coins, which are distinguished by the name of Binchester pennies. Near the river Were, oppo∣site to the small town of Lumley, stands Chester-le-street, an inconsiderable town, supposed to be the Conderium of Antoninus: the bishops of Lindis∣farne fled hither from the cruelty of the Danes,
<PB N="326" REF="3370"/>
with the body of St. Cuthbert, and here they re∣mained one hundred and thirteen years, until it was translated to Durham. Many Roman coins have been found at this place, as well as at the village of Lanchester, thought by some to be the old Longovicum, where a great number of altars and sepulchre-stones, with inscriptions, have been discovered. The same kind of antiquities, such as medals, altars, and stones, have been dug up at Whitburn, near Sunderland; and at the small village of Ebchester, upon the Derwent, where are the ruins of a Roman station, with large suburbs. Finally, on the south bank of the river Tyne, there was found a curious altar, described by doctor Lister, with an imperfect inscription, by which, however, it appears to have been de∣dicated to Antoninus Caracalla.</P>
<P>Gateshead is supposed by Cambden to be the Gabrosentum of the ancients, a frontier garrison defended by the second cohort of the Thracians, in the times of the later emperors. It was here that Walther, bishop of Durham and governor of Northumberland under William the Conque∣ror, was assassinated by the populace, whom his tyranny had driven to despair.</P>

<HEAD>YORKSHIRE, its BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>This county, the largest in England, is bound∣ed on the south by Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and Lincolnshire; on the north by Durham and Westmoreland; on the east by the German ocean; and on the west by Lancashire, and a part of Cheshire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTENT and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>It is upwards of eighty miles in length from east to west, near as much in breadth, and about three hundred and sixty in circumference, con∣taining, in the whole, twenty-six hundreds or wapentakes, forty-nine market-towns, five hun∣dred and sixty-three parishes, two hundred and forty-two vicarages, with many chapels of ease, and two thousand three hundred and thirty villages. Its area is computed by some at four thousand six hundred and eighty-four square miles, by others at three millions seven hundred and seventy thou∣sand acres, and its inhabitants at five hundred and thirty thousand seven hundred and fifty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>It is divided into three parts, or ridings, viz. the West, East, and North; so denominated from their situation, in respect of the city of York. Each of these is as large, if not larger, than any ordinary county. There are other divisions, as Richmondshire, Allertonshire, Howdenshire, Hal∣lanshire, Craven, Cleveland, Marshland, Holder∣ness, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>As the soil and face of the country vary greatly, so does the air. In the hilly parts the air is good,
<PB N="328" REF="3390"/>
but the soil very indifferent; of the lower, some are marshy, others drier, and the soil of both rich; but the air of the former is more foggy and unhealthy than that of the latter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRODUCE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>The manufactures of this county are cutlery and hard-wares; particularly knives, bits, and spurs; but the principal are stockings and woollen cloth, with which it supplies in a great measure Germany, and the North. As to the produce, it abounds in corn, cattle, horses, lead and iron, coal, wood, lime, liquorice, alum, jet, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It lies wholly in the northern circuit, and much the greater part of it in the diocese of York, that only, which is called Richmondshire, belonging to the diocese of Chester. The members it sends to parliament are thirty, of which two are for the shire, and twenty-eight for the towns.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the WEST-RIDING.</HEAD>
<P>We now proceed to a more particular description of the several ridings, beginning with the West.</P>
<P>This, which is said to be the most populous and fruitful of the three, is bounded on the east by the east-riding, from which it is separated by the Ouse; on the west and south-west by part of Lancashire and Cheshire; on the south and south∣east by Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Der∣byshire; and on the north by the north-riding. It is well watered with brooks and rivers, the chief of which are the Ouse, the Don, the Cal∣der, the Are, the Ribble, and the Wherfe. All these abound with fish. The Ouse is the largest; for it receives all the rest, except the Ribble, and is navigable from York to the Humber. There
<PB REF="3400"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A View of the City of York</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="329" REF="3410"/>
are several hills in this riding, some of which are very high, as the Pendle, Pennegent, and Ingleborough. For fuel there is pit coal, wood, and turf; but the last is dug only in the boggy part of Marshland, and used chiefly in the neigh∣bouring villages. The air, in general, is good, especially in the dry, hilly parts; but the soil there is inferior to that of the lower parts, espe∣cially about the river Ouse, and the Marshland, where it is very rich, yielding wheat, barley, oats, and luxuriant pasturage. This riding abounds in firs, yews, and chesnuts; in quarries of lime, and other stone; in iron, jet, and liquorice; in black cattle, fine horses, sheep, and goats. A stone of a bluish colour is dug in it, which, after being calcined, is converted into alum, by various per∣colations and boilings.</P>
<P>We shall now give an account of the chief towns in this riding, beginning with the parlia∣mentary, after we have described the city of York, though it does not belong to this more than to the other ridings, being a county of itself.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the CITY of YORK.</HEAD>
<P>This city, in Latin <HI>Eboracum,</HI> is so ancient, that the origin of it is uncertain. In the time of the Romans a legion was stationed here, it being then the capital of the Brigantes, and here died the emperor Severus, and Flavius Valerius Con∣stantius Chlorus, father of Constantine the Great. There was then also a temple of Bellona here, and no less than three military ways went from hence. In the time of the Saxons it was erected into an archbishopric by pope Honorius, to which are now subject, the bishoprics of Chester, Durham, Car∣lisle, and the Isle of Man; though anciently twelve bishoprics in England, and all Scotland,
<PB N="330" REF="3420"/>
were. A horn is still kept in the minster, by which Ulphius, one of the Saxon princes, bestowed all his lands and revenues upon the church.</P>
<P>This city suffered very much during the ravages of the Danes; but, after the conquest, it began to flourish again. The cathedral, which cost a long time and a great deal of money in building, is a most stately Gothic pile. Its chapter-house is particularly admired for its painted glass, its fine marble stalls, its pillars of alabaster, and curious contrivance. In it is the following line in gold letters:</P>
<Q>Ut Rosa, flos florum, sic est Domus ista Domorum.</Q>
<P>The choir is remarkable for its fine carvings, par∣ticularly the statues of all the English monarchs; and the windows are exquisitely painted with the history of the Bible. The lanthorn steeple is seventy foot square, and one hundred and eighty-eight high, and the windows are forty-five. At the south end is a circular light, called the marigold window from the colour of its glass; and at the north end is a very large one, whose painting represents em∣broidery. Here, in the reign of Richard I. was a barbarous massacre of the Jews; and Henry III. had, in this place, an interview with Alexander, king of Scots. Several parliaments were held here in the reigns of Edward I. and II. A tribunal, not unlike the parliaments of France, was established at York, by Henry VIII. to de∣cide all causes in these northern parts, according to the rules of equity.</P>
<P>This city, as hath been already observed, is a county of itself; and its jurisdiction extends over thirty-six villages and hamlets in the neighbour∣hood. It is generally reckoned the second city in
<PB N="331" REF="3430"/>
England; but though it stands upon more ground, it is inferior in trade, wealth, and number of people, to Bristol. It is situate in a fine plain, in the middle of the shire, on both sides the Ouse, walled, and divided into four wards, containing twenty-eight parishes. It enjoys large privileges and immunities, conferred upon it by a succession of kings from Henry II and its chief magistrate has the title of lord-mayor, which is an honour peculiar to it and London. Richard II. made it a county of itself. The conservancy of most of the rivers of the county, within certain limits, be∣longs to the lord-mayor and aldermen. The middle arch of the bridge here over the Ouse, is thought to equal the Rialto at Venice, in archi∣tecture, height, and breadth, the diameter being eighty-one foot, and the height fifty-one. Though this city is sixty miles distant from the sea, yet ships of seventy tons burthen come up the river to it. The town house, or Guildhall, stands upon the bridge, and is superior in all respects to that of London. In the popish times there were nine abbeys here, and a vast number of churches; but of the latter there are only seventeen now. The steeple of that of Allhallows, is reckoned the finest in England. The archbishop has a fine pa∣lace; and the assembly-room, designed by the earl of Burlington, is very noble. Here are plays, assemblies, concerts, and the like enter∣tainments, at some house or other, almost every night in the week. In the old castle, built ori∣ginally by William the Conqueror, and repaired in 1701, the assizes are kept. It serves also for the county gaol, which is the neatest and plea∣santest in England, with an area larger than that of the King's-bench, and has a handsome chapel in it, with a good allowance for a preacher. This
<PB N="332" REF="3440"/>
city has long given the title of duke to some branch of the royal family, and lately to his royal highness Edward, next brother to his present majesty George III. who was carried off by a violent fever at Monaco in Italy, in the flower of his age, to the great grief of the nation, and the royal family.</P>
<P>The plenty and cheapness of provisions induces many persons of small fortune, or that would live frugally, to take up their abode here; and the venerable remains of Roman antiquities, and those of a later date, as abbeys, churches, and castles, procure this city a visit from every curious traveller. Many Roman altars, urns, coins, in∣scriptions, &amp;c. have been found; and Saxon coins are still extant, that have been struck here. The members for this city have precedence of all others, except those of London, in the house of commons. An infirmary, after the manner of those of Bath, Bristol, &amp;c hath been erected in it; and a cotton manufacture established, and brought to great perfection. Besides four weekly markets, it has a great many fairs; one, in particular, every other Thursday, for cattle and sheep.</P>
<P>The parliamentary boroughs in this riding, are Knaresborough, Rippon, Boroughbridge, and Pon∣tefract, of which in order.</P>
<P>Knaresborough. This town is almost encom∣passed by the river Nid, and is said to take its name from a castle which it had formerly upon a craggy rock. It is a pretty large town, and a borough by prescription, governed by a bailiff. It stands hard by the forest, that takes its name from the town; in which are several medicinal springs, very near one another, and yet of very different qualities. One is a chalybeate water, and
<PB N="333" REF="3450"/>
is called the Sweet-Spaw, or Vitrioline-Well; another has the name of the Stinking-Spaw, or Sul∣phur-Well, of Harrigate; because it is strongly im∣pregnated with that mineral, and has a foetid smell; the third is stiled St. Mungo's, from a Scottish saint of that name, much honoured in these parts. The two last are generally used for bathing in. From a spungy porous rock in the town drops a water, called from thence the Dropping-Well, of so petrifying a nature, that it has formed a solid rock all the way, till it runs into the Nid. The neighbouring fields are noted for liquorice, and for a soft yellow marle, that is a valuable ma∣nure. So much were the baths here frequented before the Scarborough-spaw came in vogue, that, it is said, a cold-bath was rented at two hundred pounds a year. The manor of this town belongs to the duchy of Lancaster.</P>
<P>Rippon, a large, well-built, pleasant town, by the river Ure, over which there are two stately stone-bridges. It is said to owe its rise to a monastery founded by Wilfrid, archbishop of York; but Bede tells us, that the Scots had one here before. This monastery, which was very famous, and had the privilege of sanctuary con∣ferred upon it by king Athelstan, became after∣wards a college for a dean and secular canons; and at this day retains its collegiate privileges, having a dean and chapter: but though the former has no seat in the convocation of the pro∣vince of York, the latter sends a proctor. This town had formerly a great woollen manufacture, which it hath now lost; but is still a staple for wool, for which there is a weekly market. In 1322, a synod was held here. On one side of the church is a college for singing men, and on the other a mount, called Hilshaw, cast up, as it
<PB N="334" REF="3460"/>
is said, by the Danes. King James I. granted the town a charter, to be governed by a mayor, twelve alderman, and twenty-four assistants. Here are several great horse fairs, and the best spurs in England made with rowels which will strike through a shilling, and break sooner than bend. At its fairs are also sold cattle of all kinds, and a great deal of tanned leather. In the popish times the church was famous for Wil∣fred's needle, a pious fraud, by which the canons got money. There was a narrow passage, that led to a vaulted room under ground. Through this passage the holy men gave out no woman could pass, though ever so slender, if unchaste; but, if otherwise, she might with the greatest ease, though ever so big. Yet, it is likely, no woman ever passed it, chaste or unchaste, that could not pay; and that those who did, always found the walls extremely polite and obliging. In 1695, a considerable number of Saxon coins were found here; and in the reign of Charles I. a treaty was concluded betwixt that king and the Scots, after the second rupture. The church, which is both parochial and colle∣giate, is a very venerable Gothic pile, and the market-place is reckoned the finest in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>Boroughbridge. This is a considerable town, It takes its name from a stone bridge over the Ure, whose arches are very lofty. The chief support of it is hardware, which it vends to a considerable amount. We are told, that a soldier, in the wars betwixt Edward II. and the barons, killed Humphrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford, as he passed over the bridge, by thrusting a spear or pike into his body, through a hole, below the bridge.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="3470"/>
Pontefract, or Pomfret, a neat town, on the banks of the Are. It is said to take its name from a broken bridge, which is supposed to have been laid anciently over that marshy spot called the Wash. Here are the ruins of a noble old castle, where Richard II. was barbarously murdered, and two of Edward V's uncles. The collegiate chapel of St. Clement, which had a dean, three prebendaries, &amp;c. is still distinguishable in it. This town has a good market, and fairs for horses, sheep, and other cattle. It is a corporation, governed by a mayor, recorder, aldermen, and burgesses, and gives title of earl to the family of Fermor. In the reign of queen Elizabeth two hundred pounds were left by George Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, to be lent for ever, at five pounds a time, on proper security, for three years, to the poor artificers of the town; and Thomas Wentworth, esquire, an∣cestor to the marquis of Rockingham, left two hundred pounds to the charity-school. A branch of the great Roman military way, called Ermin∣street, which passed from Lincoln to York, may be traced betwixt this town and Doncaster. The adjacent country yields plenty of limestone, toge∣ther with liquorice, and skirrets.</P>
<P>The other places of any note in this riding are:</P>
<P>Sheffield, which is a large thriving town on the borders of Derbyshire, and by the river Don, over which it it has a fine stone-bridge. It has been long noted for cutlers and smiths wares, especially files and knives; and the first mills for grindstones were set up here. It is advantage∣ously situated for the hardware business, in the neighbourhood of the iron mines. The master cutlers, who are incorporated by the name of the cutlers of Hallamshire, of which the town is the
<PB N="336" REF="3480"/>
capital, are said to be about six hundred, and to employ about forty thousand persons in the iron manufactures. Here is a great market for corn and other commodities. Besides the parish church, there are three chapels, to serve which there is a vicar, and three assistants, with liberal allowances. A grammar-school was founded here by king James I. A certain number of burgesses manage the revenue of it, and nominate the master and usher, as others do that allotted for the maintenance of the vicar's assistants, and no∣minate them. Mr. Evelin mentions a tree felled in the park here so large, that two men on horse∣back could not see the crown of one another's hats over it, as it lay on the ground. Mary, queen of Scots, who had taken refuge in England, after the battle of Langside, expecting pro∣tection and assistance, was, in violation of all the laws of hospitality, of the respect due to a crown∣ed head, of justice and humanity, kept prisoner here sixteen or seventeen years; and, to close the black scene, at last beheaded. An earl of Shrews∣bury, of the name of Talbot, erected and en∣dowed an hospital here; and another gave two hun∣dred pounds for ever to the poor. In the neigh∣bourhood are some mines of alum.</P>
<P>Rotheram. This town takes its name from the Rother, near the conflux of which with the Don it stands. Rotheram, archbishop of York, who was a native of the town, and took his name from it, founded a college on the bridge, that is over the Don here.</P>
<P>Doncaster, a large populous town, upon the Don or Dan, from which and a castle now in ruins, it takes its name. The Britons called it Caerdaun, and the Romans Danum. It is a cor∣poration, governed by a mayor, recorder, alder∣men, and common-council; has a good market
<PB N="337" REF="3490"/>
for corn, cattle, &amp;c. several fairs, and good inns, being a great thoroughfare, upon the high road, from London to Scotland, and the North of England. Here are two strong, lofty, stone∣bridges over the Don; and a manufacture of knit waistcoats, petticoats, gloves, and stockings. The revenues of the town are considerable, and it has a handsome church and hospital.</P>
<P>Wakefield is a large, well built, thriving town, standing in a fruitful soil, and cheap country, where there is no want of good cheer and good company. Here, in 1459, Richard duke of York was slain, in a battle betwixt him and Henry VI. in memory of which his son Edward IV. after∣wards founded a chapel, upon the stone-bridge over the Calder. In the market-place is a very curious cross, with a dome, and a room in which they transact their public business. The woollen manufacture is very considerable in this town, and its neighbourhood, and there is a weekly market for it here on Friday. Great quantities of coals are sent down the Calder, which was made navigable hither in 1698, and as far as Halifax in 1740, to the Ouse, and the towns upon its banks, and those of the Humber, particularly to York. Wakefield is so populous, that it is said even to vie with York itself, in that respect.</P>
<P>Tickhill, or Tickhall, is said to take its name from a mount or hill near it, on which was formerly a castle. It has a handsome church, and gives name to an extensive seigniory, on which many manors are dependent.</P>
<P>Barnesley, commonly called Black Barnesley, probably from its forges; for it is noted for its manufacture of wire and hardware. It is a well-built town.</P>
<P>Beautre is a considerable town upon the Idle, on the borders of Nottinghamshire. It is well
<PB N="338" REF="3500"/>
furnished with inns, being a great thoroughfare, upon the high road to Scotland; and from hence are exported lead, millstones, grindstones, iron∣wares, &amp;c. to Stockwith, Burton, Hull, and many other places; and from thence beyond sea.</P>
<P>Huthersfield stands on the Calder, and is one of the five towns in this county, that is most noted for the cloathing trade.</P>
<P>Snath, or Snaithe, a small town, which, how∣ever, has a pretty good trade, the Aire, on which it stands, being navigable to it by boats. It is one hundred and seventy-five miles from London.</P>
<P>Halifax stands upon the Calder, and is very eminent for the cloathing trade. The parish is said to be the most populous, if not the most extensive in England; for it is above thirty miles in circumference, and besides the mother-church at Halifax and sixteen meeting-houses, has twelve chapels, two of which are parochial. What is a little singular, all the meeting-houses here, except the quakers, have bells and burying grounds. The woollens principally manufactured here, are kerseys and shalloons. Of the former it is affirmed, that one dealer hath sent by commission sixty thousand pounds worth in a year to Hol∣land and Hamburgh; and of the latter, it is said, one hundred thousand pieces are made in this parish yearly. The inhabitants here, and in the neighbouring towns, are so entirely employed in these manufactures, that agriculture is but little minded. Most of their provisions of all sorts are brought from the North and East-Ridings, and from Lancashire, Cheshire, Nottinghamshire, and Warwickshire. The markets are very much crowded for the buying and selling provisions and manufactures. The cloths, at the first erecting of the woollen manufactures in these parts, hav∣ing been frequently stolen off the tenters in the
<PB N="339" REF="3510"/>
hight, a law was made, by which the magistrates of Halifax were empowered to pass sentence on, and execute all offenders, if they were taken in the fact, or owned it; or if the stolen cloth was found upon them, provided also the crime was committed and the criminal apprehended within the liberties of the forest of Hardwick. Those found guilty were executed in the following manner: an axe was drawn by a pulley to the top of a wooden engine, and fastened by a pin, which being pulled out, the axe fell down in an instant, and did its work. If they had stole an ox, horse, or any other beast, it was led with them to the scaffold, and there fastened by a cord to the pin, that held up the axe; and when the signal was given by the jurors, who were the first burghers within the several towns of the forests the beast was driven away, and the pin plucked out, upon which the axe fell and did its office. This severe and summary course of justice, as thought, gave occasion to a litany, which is still much more frequent in the mouths of the beg∣gars and vagrants of these parts, than is the com∣mon prayer, viz.</P>
<Q>“From Hell, Hull, and Halifax, good Lord deliver us:”</Q>
<P>though neither the engine, nor manner of pro∣ceeding against them, are now in use.</P>
<P>Leeds, which stands on the north-side of the fiver Aire, over which it has a stately stone bridge, hath long been famous for the woollen manufac∣ture, and is one of the largest and most flourish∣ing towns in the county. On a market-day one may see a long street full of standings, and these with cloth for sale. Of this cloth large quantities are shipped off, at Hull, for Holland, Hamburgh, and the North; whence they are dispersed through
<PB N="340" REF="3520"/>
the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, &amp;c. John Harrison, esquire, a native of this town, was a great benefactor to it, by building and endowing a church, hospital, and free-school. The corpo∣ration consists of a mayor, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four assistants. On the market-days, when the market-bell rings, which is at seven in the morning in winter, and six in summer, the clothiers bring out their cloth from the inns; and when the bell ceases, the chapmen come into the market, match their patterns, and in an hour's time, per∣haps, bargain for twenty-thousand pounds worth. The bell rings again at half an hour past eight, upon which the clothiers give place to the linnen∣drapers, hardware-men, shoemakers, fruiterers, &amp;c. There have been five hundred loads of apples be∣longing to the last of these here upon a market-day. At the same time there is an equal plenty and variety of fish and butchers meat exposed to sale. Great quantities also of white cloth are sold in a magnificent hall, where notice is given by a bell when the sale begins. Not only woollen goods, but coals and other commodities, are conveyed from hence by the Aire to Wakefield, York, and Hull. In a house here, call Red-hall, there is an apartment in which king Charles I. lodged, and which, on that account, still bears the name of the King's-chamber. There was a castle here anciently, and now there is a stately town-hall and parochial church, called St. Peter's. On the roof of it the delivering of the law by Moses is finely painted in fresco. Here are also two charity-schools, a work-house, several alms houses and meeting-houses, one of which, belonging to the Presbyterians, is a very handsome building. This town gives the title of duke to the family of Osborn, and has several me∣dicinal springs about it.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="3530"/>
Sherborn is a pretty large populous town. The bishops of York, who were lords of the town, had anciently a palace in this place; and here, in 1645, a battle was fought betwixt king Charles I. and the parliament. There is an hospital, or school, for poor orphans, the expence of which, and four poor scholars at St. John's-college, Cam∣bridge, amounts to two hundred and fifty pounds a year. The town stands near the conflux of the Wherfe, and Ouse, where it has a harbour. It is noted for cherries, for the remains of a Roman highway, and for a sort of stone, which is very sort in the quarry, but grows hard when exposed to the wind and weather.</P>
<P>Bradforth, or Bradford. This town is of note for its woollen manufacture, and for giving birth to doctor John Sharp, archbishop of York in the reign of William III.</P>
<P>Selby, though a small town, has a good trade, the river Ouse, on which it stands, being navigable to it by large vessels. Here is said to have been a mitted abbey, built by William the Conqueror, whose son Henry I. was born in the place.</P>
<P>At Aberforth, or Aberford, is still to be seen the foundation of an old castle, called by the inhabitants Castle-Cary, and part of a Ro∣man highway, as entire as when first made, though that was about sixteen hundred years ago. Here is also a manufacture of pins.</P>
<P>Tadcaster. Here was formerly a castle, out of the ruins of which a handsome bridge was built over the Wherfe, near which the town stands. Many coins of Roman emperors also have been found in the neighbourhood. Excellent limestones are dug up near the town, and conveyed to York, and all the country round, for building, and other
<PB N="342" REF="3540"/>
purposes. Here is a free-school founded by Dr. Ogle∣thorpe, bishop of Carlisle, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and endowed with forty pounds a year; and also an almshouse for twelve poor people, who have each a shilling a week.</P>
<P>Skipton. This towns stand near the Aire, in the middle of that part of the county called Craven. It is a pretty, well-built, healthy town, and had anciently a beautiful strong castle. In the church is the monument of George Clifford, earl of Cumberland, who made nine voyages, most of them to the West-Indies, in the reign of queen Elizabeth. Here is a plentiful market, a handsome church, a grammar-school, and a Psalm∣ody school, in which the town-boys are taught both to read and sing psalms by the parish clerk, who has a salary for it.</P>
<P>Wetherby is a pretty good trading town on the Wherfe, but is not otherwise remarkable.</P>
<P>Burnsal, which also stands on the Wherfe, had a great benefactor in Sir William Craven, ancestor to the lord Craven, who built a bridge over the river, erected and walled the church, at the ex∣pence of six hundred pounds, and founded a free-school hard by.</P>
<P>Ripley, a pretty large town on the Nyd, over which it has a bridge. It is noted for the great quantities of liquorice raised in its neighbourhood, and for being the birth-place of Sir George Rip∣ley, the famous chymist, and canon of Bridlington.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES, &amp;c. of this RIDING.</HEAD>
<P>The village of Almondbury, from the distances on each hand, and the remains of some Roman
<PB N="343" REF="3550"/>
works about it, is, with great probability, sup∣posed to be <HI>Cambodunum.</HI> Castleford, near the conflux of the Calder and Aire, where great num∣bers of coins are found, is supposed to be <HI>Legco∣lium;</HI> and Ilkeley, <HI>Olicana.</HI> Newton-kyme, near Tadcaster, has the best claim to the ancient <HI>Cas∣caria,</HI> though commonly placed at Tadcaster it∣self; because great store of Roman coins, and other antiquities, are found there, and the high∣way runs along by it, crossing the river at St. He∣lensford. Aldborough, near Boroughbridge, is held to be the ancient <HI>Isurium.</HI> Many Roman an∣tiquities have been found here. The remains of two Roman fortifications are yet to be seen, the one at Temple borough, near the Don and Rothe∣ram; and the other between Rotheram and Sheffield. On the north-side of the same river is a large bank, continued for several miles, which in different places is called Wine's-bank, Dane's-bank, Devil's-bank, Kemp-bank, and Temple-bank. At Connesborow, near the Don, on the declivity of a hill, are to be seen the remains of a very ancient castle, to which Hengist retired to secure himself against the Britons; and in the church-yard is a stone of blue marble, with se∣veral antique figures on it. In the year 1697, be∣tween Wakefield-Outwood, and Thorp on the hill, were found certain moulds, invented for counterfeiting the Roman coins. At Cookridge, between Ilkeley and Adle, Roman coins have been found; and in 1702, the footsteps of a Ro∣man town were discovered on the moor, not far from Adle-mill; near to which is also a Roman camp, pretty entire. At Adde, five miles from Otley, are the remains of a Roman town, and camp. In Clifton lordship near Halifax, gal∣lons of copper coins have been found. Near Bo∣roughbridge are three huge stones set on end, in
<PB N="344" REF="3560"/>
form of pyramids, which the common people sup∣pose to have been pitched by the devil, and there∣fore call them the devil's bolts, or arrows; but the learned look upon them as monuments of some victory, or British deities. At Gigleswick, near the Ribble, is a spring, which though thirty miles from the sea, ebbs and flows thrice in an hour. Near Sandbeck is a yew-tree of a shining colour, and of so singular a form, that it is esteem∣ed a great curiosity. The church at Laughton, near Rotheram, stands on so high a hill, and has a steeple so lofty, that it is seen fifty or sixty miles off by the naked eye. At Kirkley, near Hali∣fax, is the funeral monument of the famous Ro∣binhood, with an inscription. At Ferrybridge a battle was fought, in 1461, between the Yorkists and I ancastrians; and at the village of Brotherton near it, Margaret, wife to Edward I. was delivered of a son, called from thence Thomas of Brother∣ton, she having been taken in labour while she was hunting near it. The inhabitants of this village are chiefly employed in making lime of stones brought from Tadcaster.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The EAST RIDING, its BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>It is bounded on the south by the Humber; on the north and west by the Derwent, and the Ouse; and on the east, by the German ocean.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL, AIR, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The whole of this riding, which is the least of the three, is very fruitful, except that called the Would, towards the middle, which, indeed, is but thinly inhabited, and produces but little corn, yet feeds great numbers of black cattle, sheep, and horses. The wool of these sheep is
<PB N="345" REF="3570"/>
very fine. The hills and downs, of which the Woulds consist, yield also chalk, coal, freestone, flints, firestones, &amp;c. The astroites or star-stones also are found about them. As to the air, the reader need not be told, that it is much purer and clearer upon the dry downs, than in the lower grounds, especially along the Humber, and the sea coast. This riding is well watered with brooks and rivers, the chief of which are the above∣mentioned Humber, Derwent, Towlney, or Fowl∣ness, Shellfleet, and Hull. The Humber is the receptacle of many other rivers, and is rather an arm of the sea, than a river. Both the flood and ebb of this Aestuary is attended with a terrible roaring noise; and the navigation of it, especially during the ebb, is dangerous to those who are unacquainted with it.</P>
<P>The waters called Vipsies, and, in the Woulds, Gipses, are such as, after great gluts of rain, and lasting wet weather, break out in different places of the Downs, spouting up to a great height. The common people look upon them as the cer∣tain forerunners of famine; and it must be owned that wet springs and summers generally occasion a scarcity of corn and other provisions.</P>
<P>That called the Manwater, between Bridling∣ton and Hornsey, is about a mile and a half long, and half a mile broad, pretty deep and always fresh. It abounds with perch, pikes, and eels. Near Beverley is a spring said to be good against the king's evil, cutaneous erup∣tions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Though this riding is not destitute of turf and wood, its principal fuel is pit-coal, with which it abounds.</P>
<P>In describing the towns we shall begin with the parliamentary boroughs, which are Beverly, King∣ston upon Hull, and Headdon.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="3580"/>
The first is said to have been called antiently Beverlac, from the beavers, with which the Hull that runs by it then abounded. Here John de Beverly, archbishop of York, built a monastery, into which, turning monk, he retired about the year 721. Out of respect to him the kings of those times are said to have granted several pri∣veleges and immunities to the town, particularly that of a sanctuary, and exemption from tolls and custom all over England. By a charter from queen Elizabeth, the town is governed by a mayor, a recorder, aldermen, &amp;c. In 1664, upon opening a grave in this place, a plate of lead was found with an inscription, de∣noting that in 1197 the bones of St. John de Beverly were interred there. The minster, or church, so called, is very antient, large, and magnificent. In it are several monuments of the Perceys, earls of Northumberland; and in the windows of a little chapel, are the pictures of some of that family. The choir is paved with marble of different colours, and has a seat in it called the Freedstool, i. e. the Chair of Sanctuary. It is said to have been brought from Dunbar in Scotland, and was placed in the church for criminals. In this church are also the pictures of St. John, and king Athelstan, and the tomb of two virgin sisters, who gave the town a field, into which any freeman may put three milch cows from Lady Day to Michaelmas. As a perpetual fund for keeping this church in repair, Sir Michael Wharton left by will four thousand pounds. The liberties of the town are of great extant, and there is a court called the Provost-court for trying all civil causes arising therein. Besides the minster, here is another beautiful church, with a workhouse, several alms-houses, and a free-school endowed with two fellowships, six scholarships,
<PB REF="3590"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A View of Kingston upon Hull.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="347" REF="3600"/>
and three exhibitions, in St. John's College, Cam∣bridge. The town is situated in a fine sporting country, is above a mile in length, and has good company and assemblies. The sessions for the riding are held here in a fine Sessions-house; and here, which is an advantage that no county in England can boast of, besides Yorkshire and Mid∣dlesex, is an office for registering all deeds af∣fecting any lands, &amp;c. in the riding. Here are manufactures of oat-meal, malt, tanned leather, and bone-lace; and two weekly markets for corn, cattle, fish, fowl, and other provisions. The mar∣ket-place is very large, and adorned with a beau∣tiful cross. Its chief fair begins nine days before the ascension, in which the Londoners furnish the country tradesmen with wares by wholesale. There are four commons belonging to the town, con∣taining about a thousand acres, into which every burgess may put twelve cows, or other cattle. The Hull is about six furlongs from the town; but there is a cut or canal, called Beverly-Beck, by which ships of good burden may get up to it.</P>
<P>Kingston upon Hull, commonly called Hull, from the situation on that river, had the name of Kingston from its founder Edward I. who made a harbour for it, and granted it several privileges. It stands near the mouth of the Humber, where the Hull falls into it; was early fortified with walls on the land-side, and first grew rich by its trade in Iceland-fish dried, and called stock-fish, because it was carried on by a joint-stock. In the reign of Henry VI. it was made a county of itself, and in that of Henry VIII. erected into an honour. The mayor has two swords, one given by Richard II. and the other by Henry VIII. but only one of them is born be∣fore him at a time. He has also a cap of mainte∣nance, and an oar of lignum vitae, as a badge of
<PB N="348" REF="3610"/>
his admiralty-jurisdiction within the limits of the Humber. The town is said by some to have been incorporated by Edward III. Here was an∣tiently a strong citadel. At present there are two churches, several meeting-houses, an exchange, a custom-house, free-school, merchants-hall, seve∣ral hospitals, one of them is called Trinity-house, in which many distressed seamen and their widows are maintained. This house is governed by twelve elder brothers, six assistants, two wardens, and two stewards, who have a power to determine in sea∣affairs between the masters and sailors. There is also a large workhouse for employing the poor. The town is large, close built, populous, and one of the most considerable of the kingdom for trade, the customs amounting to about 40,000 l. a year. Hull carries on a prodigious inland trade by the Humber, and many rivers that fall into it, by which it supplies a great part of England with fo∣reign goods, and brings back their commodities and manufactures for its own use, or for exporta∣tion: in particular, vast quantities of cheese, lead, iron ware, corn, butter, and woollen manufactures are exported from hence; and the returns in iron, copper, hemp, flax, canvas, Russia linnen and yarn, wine, oil, and fruit, are very great. For the exportation of corn, no port in England comes up to it except that of London, with which and Holland the greatest branches of its trade are carried on. No merchants have a better charac∣ter or more credit than those of Hull, which gives the title of duke to the noble family of Pierpoint.</P>
<P>Headon, Heddon, or Heydon, the third par∣liamentary borough, is an antient but pleasant well-built town, standing near the Humber, and formerly more considerable than it is at pre∣sent. Its decline has been owing partly to the neighbourhood of Hull, and partly to the loss of
<PB N="349" REF="3620"/>
the best part of its harbour, by the incroachment of the sea: however, the town still continues in good condition, the effect chiefly of its fairs, which are held every fortnight.</P>
<P>The other places, of any account, in this rid∣ing are,</P>
<P>Howden, a pretty large town near the Ouse, with a harbour for boats. Here was antiently a collegiate church; and a house of the bishops of Durham, who have large possessions and a tem∣poral jurisdiction in these parts. There is a fair for nine days in September, to which the Lon∣doners repair, and furnish the country tradesmen with goods by wholesale.</P>
<P>Partington, an antient town corporate, stands within the Spurn-head, on which is a light∣house and day-mark, and has a pleasant prospect of the ocean and Humber.</P>
<P>Wighton, a small, but antient town near the river Foulness, has several fairs, and a weekly market on Wednesdays.</P>
<P>Bridlington, or Burlington, stands on the Bay, to which it gives name; but was antiently called Sinus Salutaris, as being a safe harbour, or re∣treat for ships, in hard gales at north, north-west, and north-east. It is pretty large, and its trade considerable, having a handsome quay about a mile land a half from the town, and a great corn market. A little to the north-east, at the extremity of the bay, is Flamborough∣head, which takes its name from a village near it, and has a light-house on it, for the direction of the sailors.</P>
<P>Hornsey stands on the German ocean, and has a harbour for ships; but is otherwise inconsider∣able.</P>

<PB N="350" REF="3630"/>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>At Auldby on the Derwent, supposed to be the antient <HI>Derventis,</HI> are some remains of an∣tiquity. At Wighton on the river Foulness, supposed to be the antient <HI>Delgovitia,</HI> are some Roman as well as British antiquities. In par∣ticular an idol-temple stood anciently not far from it. Kelnsey seems to be the antient <HI>Ocellum,</HI> from which the Spurn-head was antiently called <HI>ocellum promontorium.</HI> The Aestuary antiently called <HI>Abus,</HI> is said to be the modern Humber, and the antient <HI>Praetorium,</HI> Patrington. At Acklam, the body of Severus, who died at York, was burnt to ashes. At Bugthorp near the Woulds, the stones called astroites or star-stones are found. When calcined they make exceeding good lime.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>NORTH RIDING, its BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>It is bounded on the north by the river Tees, which separates it from Durham; on the south and West by the Derwent and Air, which part it from the east and west ridings; and the German ocean is its boundary on the east.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this riding is said to be purer, sharper, and more wholesome, than that of the other two; but, as is generally the case, the soil of the greater part of it is worse: for those tracts called Blackamoor and Richmondshire, are very mountainous, wild, and barren; they yield, however, in some parts store of wood, lead, pit∣coal, and other minerals, as marble, jet, cop∣peras, and allum, and feed abundance of goats, deer, stags, and sheep. The vallies, and the
<PB N="351" REF="3640"/>
bottoms of the hills, yield also grass and corn. The two vallies in this riding, called Swalsdale and Wenesdale, are very pleasant and fertile, especially the latter, which feeds vast herds of cattle.</P>
<P>The rivers of this riding, which, besides the Derwent, parts it from the east riding, are the Tees, Swale and Ure, abounding with salmon and fish; as the sea coast does with turbots and her∣rings in their season.</P>
<P>The farmers upon the coast manure their land with see weed, of which they also make a great deal of what is called kelp; and is used in the allum works, especially about Whitby.</P>
<P>Besides the famous Scarborough spa, there are several other mineral waters in this riding, par∣ticularly at Ounsberry Hill.</P>
<P>We shall now proceed to the towns, beginning with the parliamentary ones, which are those of Scarborough, Malton, Thirsk, and North-Al∣lerton.</P>
<P>Scarborough has its name from its situation on a steep rock, and is almost surrounded by the sea. It is a pretty handsome town, though antient, has a good harbour, and not a few ships, which are chiefly employed in carrying coals from Newcastle to London. On the north east is a high steep rock, with a plain on the top of nineteen acres of good meadow, and a spring, where antiently was a very strong castle, built by Henry II. The harbour here on account of its si∣tuation, and likelihood of being serviceable to ships in stormy weather, being a public concern, has been much enlarged and improved by virtue of an act of parliament, and a duty laid upon coals from Newcastle and Sunderland, for keeping it in repair. This town has a large share in the fishery on the coast, where not only herrings in
<PB N="352" REF="3650"/>
great numbers; but also cod, ling, haddocks, whitings, hake, mackarels, turbots, and se∣veral other kinds of fish, are caught. But what greatly contributes to the flourishing condition of this town, are the chalybeate waters in its neigh∣bourhood, which are much frequented in summer. They are purgative and diuretic, and much of the same nature as those of Pyrmont in Germany. There are very good accommodations for those that drink them, and no want of amusements. Besides, as there is an extensive prospect of the sea, and the situation of the town is very ro∣mantic, walking and riding are very delightful in fine weather. There is an hospital here for poor seamen, and their widows. It gives the title of earl to the family of Lumley, and is a corpora∣tion, governed by two bailiffs, a recorder, and common-council.</P>
<P>Malton, a populous borough, though no cor∣poration. It stands in a fruitful vale, called Rhy∣dale, on the Derwent, over which it has a good stone bridge. Here was antiently a castle, some remains of which are still visible, and also a mo∣nastery. As it stands on the road from Scar∣borough to York, it is a great thoroughfare, and has good inns. The river Derwent, which is navigable to it, divides it into two parts, called Old and New Malton. Besides two fairs, it has two weekly markets, of which, that on Sa∣turday is the best in the county, for horses, black cattle, tools for husbandry, and other commo∣dities. The right hon. the earl of Scarborough is lord of the manor. The town is governed by a bailiff.</P>
<P>Thruske, or Thirske, had antiently a very strong castle. It is a corporation, governed by a bailiff, and burgage-holders. The bailiff is chosen by the burgesses, and sworn in by the
<PB N="353" REF="3660"/>
steward of the lord of the manor, for whom he holds courts at Lady-day and Michaelmas.</P>
<P>North Allerton, or Alverton, an antient town situated in a champaign fruitful country, on the river Wiske. It stands on the great northern road, and has a good market, for horses, corn, and cattle. At its fairs, incredible numbers of oxen are bought up, and carried as far as the fens of Lincolnshire, and the Isle of Fly to be fat∣tened. In the fourth year of king Stephen, Da∣vid, king of Scots, was defeated here at the battle of the Standard. The bailiff appointed by the bishop of Durham, who is lord of the manor, presides at the election of its members of par∣liament.</P>
<P>Richmond: this town gives name to that part of the county called Richmondshire, and is its capital; including the suburbs without the walls, it is pretty large. It had antiently a strong castle built by Alan its first earl, from whom it also had its name, which signifies a rich mount. It stands on the Swale, over which it has a good stone bridge, and is a handsome town, well in∣habited, built, and paved. Its privileges and im∣munities are considerable, and so is its trade in stockings, and woollen caps. It is a corporation governed by a mayor, who is chosen by the ma∣jority of thirteen companies of trading freemen, a recorder, twelve aldermen, twenty-four com∣mon council-men, and their officers; and it gives the title of duke to a descendant of the noble lord Charles Lenox, a natural son of king Charles II. Its fairs are numerous, besides its weekly market.</P>
<P>Whitby, i. e. the White Town, stands on the river Esk, where it falls into the sea. It is a well built town, and has a commodious harbour, and a great number of ships, besides those that are
<PB N="354" REF="3670"/>
built for the coal trade. A good deal of corn and butter are sent from hence to London, and sometimes to Holland. A council is said to have been held here, Anno 663, for settling the festival of Easter, some contending for the Roman celebration, and others for that of the Britons. Here also some curious Roman coins have been dup up.</P>
<P>To the west of this town, lies that tract, called Cleveland, from the steep cliffs in it, which gives the title of duke to a descendant of a natural son of Charles II. by the duchess of Cleveland.</P>
<P>Gisborough, a handsome town, pleasantly si∣tuated about four miles from the mouth of the Tees, where it has a harbour. Here was formerly a noble abbey, founded about the year 1119, by Robert de Bruce, a Norman, who was lord of the town, and ancestor to the renowned Robert de Bruce, king of Scotland. The air is said to be very healthy, and the soil fruitful. The hills about this town and Whitby abound with veins of iron, allum-earth of several colours, ochre, and murrey. On the sea coasts are stones that look like brass, and droves of seals are often seen basking in the sun, and sleeping on the rocks, when one of them always stands centinel, and upon the approach of danger, gives the alarm, by plunging herself into the sea. On this coast also is a village, a bay, and three little hills, which take their names from the famous out-law, Robin Hood, whom John Major, a Scotchman, styles the most kind and obliging robber, and the prince of his profession. The little hills are called his butts, and are about a quarter of a mile asunder.</P>
<P>Pickering, a pretty large town belonging to the duchy of Lancaster. It has a plentiful market for corn and other provisions, and a court for
<PB N="355" REF="3680"/>
all actions under forty shillings arising within the honor or liberty of Pickering, which includes the adjacent territory, and a great many villages.</P>
<P>Yarum, a small, but corporate town, on the river Tees, over which it has a fine stone-bridge. It carries on a pretty good trade, and had an∣tiently a priory and a religious hospital.</P>
<P>Stokesley, a pretty good town and corporation. It consists of one street, about half a mile long, has a good market, and one of the best fairs for cattle in England.</P>
<P>Bedal, a small town in that part called Rich∣mondshire. Its living is said to be worth five hundred pounds a year. The Roman causey, called Leeming Lane, for twenty miles together, passes through it. As the neighbouring country is noted for breeding fine horses, it is full of dealers in them, commonly called jockeys.</P>
<P>Midlam, or Middleham, stands on the river Ure. It has a good manufacture of cloth, and formerly had a strong castle, in which Edward, prince of Wales, only son of king Richard the Third, was born.</P>
<P>Masham: this little town stands also on the river Ure, and has a considerable cloth manufacture, a weekly market, and several fairs.</P>
<P>Mulgrave, which formerly gave title to a noble family, and had a castle on a steep hill, near the sea, is an inconsiderable place, two miles from Whitby.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The antient <HI>Dunus Sinus</HI> lies near Whitby, and has at this day a village upon it, that bears the name of Dunsley. At the conflux of the Braint, and Ure, is a place called Burgh, or Brough, supposed to be the ancient <HI>Brachium.</HI> At Cata∣rick,
<PB N="356" REF="3690"/>
a small village on the Swale, are still visible some remains of the antient city <HI>Cataractonium,</HI> which was of great note in the time of the Ro∣mans, and had its name from a cataract or fall in the river. A Roman highway crosses the river here; and in the neighbourhood are ruins of houses, walls, and fortifications, where Roman coins, bases of old pillars, brick floors, urns, altars, and inscriptions, have been found.</P>
<P>Bowes, on the edge of Stanemore, by the inscrip∣tions found about it, the course of the Roman high∣way, and the distances in Antoninus, is supposed to be the antient <HI>Lavatrae.</HI> At Whitby is found jet or black amber, in the ciefts of a rock, and also ser∣pent stones, which the common people imaginewere once real serpents, turned to stones by St Hilda.</P>
<P>Many have attained to a great age in this rid∣ing, as well as the others, particularly Henry Jen∣kins, who lived till he was a hundred and seventy, had his sight and hearing to the last, and two years before his death bound sheaves after the reapers. He had long followed the employment of a fisher∣man. In the hundred and fifty seventh year of his age, he went to York, and gave evidence in re∣lation to some circumstance a hundred and forty years back.</P>
<P>One Mary Allison, of Thorlby in this riding, is said to lived to the age of a hundred and eight, and to have spun a web when she was turned of a hundred.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTENT and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>Its length is between thirty and forty miles, its breadth about thirty, and its circumference about one hundred and thirty-four. It is an inland county, of an almost circular form, and contains eight hundred and ninety thousand acres, one hundred and thirty-nine thousand inhabitants, and fifteen hundreds, in which are one hun∣dred and seventy parishes, and fifteen market∣towns. It makes a part of three bishoptics, viz. Herefordshire, Coventry and Litchfield, and St. Asaph. Some part of it lies on the north, and some on the south side of the Severn. Besides the Severn, it is also watered by the Tisidiane, or Fafidiane, as it is called in Welch, which flows from the mountains of Radnorshire, and by the Tern, which has its rise and name from one of those pools, called tearnes, in Staffordshire. All these abound with fish, especially trouts, pikes, lampreys, graylings, carp, and eels.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air, especially upon the hills, with which the county abounds, is very wholesome. There is as great a diversity of soil, as in most other counties. On the hills, where it is poor, is very good pasture for sheep; and in the low grounds, where it is very rich, along the Se∣vern in particular, there is plenty of grass for hay and black cattle, with all sorts of corn. No county is better provided with fuel than this, having in it many inexhaustible pits of coal; and also mines of lead and iron. Over most of the coal-pits in
<PB N="359" REF="3720"/>
this county lies a stratum, or layer of blackish, porous rock, of which, by grinding and boiling, they make pitch and tar, which are rather better than the common sort, for caulking ships, as they do not crack, but always continue close and smooth. Quarries of lime-stone, and iron-stone, are com∣mon enough in the county; and the soil in many places is a reddish clay.</P>
<P>As it lies upon the borders of Wales, it was anciently full of castles and walled towns. On the side next that country there was an almost continued line of castles, to guard the county against the inroads and depredations of the Welch. The borders here, as those between England and Scotland, were called Marches, and there were certain noblemen, entitled <HI>barones marchiae, mar∣chiones de marchia Walliae,</HI> lords marchers, or mar∣quisses of the marches of Wales, who were vested with a sort of palatine jurisdiction, held courts of justice to determine controversies, and enjoyed many privileges and immunities, the better to enable and encourage them to protect the county against the incursions of the Welch, and to main∣tain order amongst the borderers; but they often abused their power, and were the greatest of ty∣rants.</P>
<P>As to the ecclesiastical government of the county, the far greater part, namely, all that be∣longs to the bishoprics of Hereford, and of Litch∣field and Coventry, is under the jurisdiction and visitation of the archdeacon of Shrewsbury, or Salop, and is divided into several deaneries.</P>
<P>The Oxford circuit includes in it this county, which sends twelve members to parliament, viz. two for the shire, and two for each of the follow∣ing towns, Shrewsbury, Ludlow, Wenlock, and Bishop's-Castle.</P>

Shrewsbury. This town, the metropolis of the county, grew up out of the ruins of Uriconium, anciently a city, now a village, called Wroxeter, about four miles from it. The Saxons called it Scrobbes-Berig, from the shrubs that grew about it, and from thence the present name of Shrews∣bury is supposed to have been formed. It is pleasantly situated upon a hill near the Severn, over which there are two handsome bridges. It was a place of good note in the Saxon times; after which it was granted by William the Con∣queror, together with the title of earl and most of the county, to Roger de Montgomery, who built a castle upon the north-side of it, where the Severn, that encompasses it on all sides, leaves an opening. His son Robert built also a wall across this neck of land, when he revolted from Henry I. We learn from doomsday-book, that at that time when a widow of this town married, she paid twenty shillings to the king, and a virgin ten. The above-mentioned Roger founded also and endowed here a Benedictine monastery, and a col∣legiate church. When old age came upon him, he quirted the world, and spent the rest of his days as a monk in the abbey, and, when he died, was interred in its church. From the history of this church and monastery, it appears, that eccle∣siastical benefices about that time were hereditary. The abbey became so rich afterwards, that the abbot was mitred, and sat in parliament. Besides this abbey, in after-times there were three others, viz. a Franciscan, Dominican, and Augustin, and likewise two collegiate churches; one de∣dicated to Saint Chad, and the other to Saint Mary. In the contest between the empress Maud and Stephen, this town and its governor William Fitz-Allan, sided with the empress. In Henry the Third's time, a part of it was burnt down by
<PB N="361" REF="3740"/>
the Welch; and in Richard the Second's reign, a parliament was held in it. At a place called Battlefield, near this town, Henry Piercy the younger, surnamed Hotspur, was killed in an en∣gagement with Henry IV. against whom he had rebelled. The king afterwards built a chapel upon the spot, and settled two mass-priests, to pray for the souls of the slain. Two of Edward the Fourth's sons were born here, namely Richard, stiled duke of York, whom Perkin Warbeck af∣terwards personated, and who was murdered in the Tower; and George Plantagenet, who died before his brothers. Here first broke out the sweating sickness, which carried off great numbers so suddenly, that those, who were seized with it, either died or recovered in the space of twenty∣four hours. In the beginning of the civil wars, king Charles I. came hither, and formed an army, with which he marched towards London; but was met by the parliament's forces at Edgehill. He continued here from the twentieth of Septem∣ber, to the twelfth of October; during which time he was joined by prince Rupert, and many of the gentry and nobility of these parts. This town anciently gave title of earl to the Montgo∣merys, and afterwards to the Talbots, by whom it is still retained. Here is a free grammar-school, with three masters, and several ushers, well en∣dowed by Edward VI. and queen Elizabeth, and not inferior to many colleges in the universities. It has a good library and chapel, and there are several scholarships appropriated to it in the uni∣versity of Cambridge. Here are also several hos∣pitals, alms-houses, and charity-schools. This town is one of the most flourishing in England, having two great weekly markets for corn, cat∣tle, and provisions, and another for Welch cot∣tons and flannels; of which great quantities are
<PB N="362" REF="3750"/>
sold. A great trade is carried on with the Welch, who bring their commodities hither, as to the common mart of both nations. The town is large and well built, and the situation extreme∣ly pleasant. There is a very beautiful walk called the Quarry, between the town walls and the Se∣vern, delightfully shaded with rows of lime-trees, so that it is not inferior to the Mall in St. James's park. The town is also noted for its gallantry and politeness, being full of gentry, and for whom there are always balls and assemblies once a week all the year round. Here is a fine house and gardens, which belonged to the earl of Bradford; and in the neighbourhood at Wroxeter, the Roman highway, called Watling∣street, may be seen for several miles, where Ro∣man coins are frequently found. In Shrewsbury are twelve incorporated trading companies; and the corporation has a power to try even capital causes of itself, except high treason. Thigh∣bones of dead men have been found here a yard long, and teeth three inches round, and three long.</P>
<P>Bruges, Bridgenorth, or Brugmorfe, standing on the river Severn, with a fine stone-bridge of seven arches over it, upon the building of some other bridge to the south of it, took the name of Bridgenorth, having been called before only Bridge. It had anciently a castle and walls, which are now in ruins. It stands pleasantly as well as commodiously for trade, on both sides the Severn, and is divided into the upper and lower towns; the former standing on a hill, from whence there is a charming prospect. The town consists chiefly of three streets, and has a great trade carried on both by land and water. Here is a great manufacture of stockings; and fairs, resorted to from all parts of the kingdom, for horses, black cattle, sheep,
<PB N="363" REF="3760"/>
butter, cheese, bacon, linnen cloth, hops, and many other commodities. There were several reli∣gious houses formerly in this place; and now there are two churches, and a free-school for the sons of the burgesses, which has eighteen scholarships in the university of Oxford. The town is well sup∣plied with water by leaden pipes, and is a corpo∣ration, consisting of two bailiffs, and other infe∣rior officers.</P>
<P>Ludlow stands at the conflux of the Teme and Corve, and had formerly a strong castle, inclosed by a wall a mile in compass. The president of the council of the marches, established by Henry VIII. generally kept his courts in it, by which the town was much benefited, these courts not having been abolished 'till the first of William and Mary. Its neighbourhood to Wales makes it a great tho∣roughfare, and engages many of the Welch to send their children of both sexes to it for educa∣tion. It was incorporated by Edward IV. and among other privileges, has that of trying and executing criminals within itself. It is one of the neatest towns in England, with walls, and seven gates. From the castle on the top of the hill, on which the town stands, is a most delightful pros∣pect. In an apartment of the outer-gatehouse of the palace, Samuel Butler is said to have written the first part of Hudibras. Here Arthur, elder brother to Henry VIII. died, and was buried in the choir of the church. Without the town on the north-side stood anciently a rich priory; of which there are hardly any remains. The river Teme here has a good bridge over it, and dams or wears across it. In the church are some old monuments of the lords president, &amp;c. The neighbouring country is exceeding pleasant, espe∣cially that part called Corve's-Dale, or the valley along the Corve.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="3770"/>
Great Wenlock is a corporation town, consisting of a bailiff, recorder, and two other justices of the peace. Here was anciently a nunnery; but now it is noted only for tobacco-pipe clay, and limestone.</P>
<P>Bishop's-Castle. The corporation consists of a bailiff, recorder, and fifteen aldermen, out of whom the bailiff is annually chosen. It belonged formerly to the bishop of Hereford, whence it had its name; but queen Elizabeth gave it to Sir Christopher Hatton. It has many privileges, and its fairs are much frequented by the Welch, as well as its market, which is noted for black cattle and other commodities.</P>
<P>Other places that merit any notice besides the parliamentary boroughs, are these.</P>
<P>Witchurch, though large and populous, has lit∣tle trade, stands on the borders of Cheshire. When Charles I. came to Shrewsbury, it is said to have raised a complete regiment for his service. A∣mong other monuments of the Talbots, there was in Cambden's time one of Sir John Talbot, the first earl of Shrewsbury of that name, so renowned for his valour in France, that he got the name of the English Achilles.</P>
<P>Oswestry, or Oswaldestry, took its name from Oswald, king of the Northumbrians, who at this place was defeated and slain by Penda, king of the Mercians. Here is a great market for Welch flannels and friezes. The church is dedicated to St. Oswald, and the town governed by two bailiffs and burgesses. St. Andrew's fair lasts four days. The town is enclosed with a wall and ditch, and has a small castle. There is a grammar∣school, and a charity-school both for boys and girls. In the latter, to excite emulation, prizes are often proposed to such as acquit themselves best in the different branches of their education; as
<PB N="365" REF="3780"/>
for the girls, a smock to the best spinner, a pair of stockings to the best knitter, a head-dress to the best sempstress; and for both boys and girls, a bible to the best reader, a copy or cypher-book to the best writer or cypherer.</P>
<P>Wem is a considerable town at the head of the river Rodan. In the year 1676, great part of it was consumed by fire. It formerly gave the title of baron to the families of Butler and Ferrers, and afterwards to the never to be for∣gotten Jefferies, whom that weak bigotted prince James II. advanced to the dignities of lord chancellor, and baron of Wem. The detested memory of this inhuman judge can reflect no ho∣nour upon this town; but that of Mr. Wycher∣ley, who was a native of it, and so celebrated a dramatic poet, undoubtedly must. Another emi∣nent person, who was a native of it, was Sir Tho∣mas Adams, lord-mayor of London in 1645, and liberally endowed a free-school for the children of the town.</P>
<P>Newport. Here also a school was founded by a gentleman of the same name, and a native of the same town, who had made his fortune in Lon∣don. He laid out seven thousand pounds upon a school-house, a house for the master and usher, a garden of an acre to each house, two acres for the boys to play in, sixty pounds a year to the master, now said to be raised to an hundred pounds, and thirty pounds to the usher. The place of master of the school is in the gift of the haberdashers com∣pany of London. The same gentleman built also an alms-house, and gave five hundred pounds towards building the town-house. The town is pretty large, and stands on the borders of Staf∣fordshire.</P>
<P>Cherburg. This place stands near the Severn, and gives title of baron to the descendant of
<PB N="366" REF="3790"/>
Sir Edward Herbert, so created by Charles I. It had formerly a castle.</P>
<P>Rowton is supposed to be the Rutunium of Antoninus. It is situated upon the western bor∣ders of the shire, near the Severn.</P>
<P>Caer-Caradack. This is a steep hill at the conflux of the Teme and Clun, on which is a large camp, supposed to be that from whence the brave Caractacus, after an obstinate and gallant resistance, was driven by Ostorius and the Roman legions, and for the taking of which a triumph was decreed to Ostorius. In the neighbourhood are two camps, one of which appears to be Roman, and the other British.</P>
<P>Clee-hill, ten miles from Bridgenorth. On this hill are the remains of an ancient camp. It is noted also for producing the best pit-coal, and for some veins of iron.</P>
<P>Pitchford is near Wenlock, and had its name from a spring, on the surface of which is found a liquid bitumen, which is skimmed off, and used as pitch. Whether it be good against the falling-sickness, and for healing wounds, as some pre∣tend, is what we cannot take upon us to affirm.</P>
<P>Rushbury, near Bridgenorth, is thought to be the Bramonium, or Bravonium, of Antoni∣nus.</P>
<P>Acton-Burnel, near Wenlock. Here, in the reign of Edward I. was held a parliament, when the lords sat in the castle, and the commons in a barn, which is said to be still standing, and then belonged to the abbot of the monastery of St. Pe∣ter and St. Paul, in Shrewsbury, now to—Prince, esquire. The Burnels were anciently lords of this place, whence it was distinguished by the addition of their surname.</P>
<P>Wrekin-hill is remarkably high, and stands within a mile of Wroxeter, which is supposed to
<PB N="367" REF="3800"/>
be the ancient Uriconium. The remains of Roman buildings and fortifications, now called the Old Works of Wroxeter, are still to be seen. It stands on the Severn, near its junction with the Tern, and appears to have been about three miles in com∣pass, surrounded with a strong wall and ditch, some part of which is still very deep. Its present name is probably a contraction of Wrekinceaster.</P>
<P>Brosely, near Wenlock. Here is a well, the water of which being lighted burns like the spirit of wine, or brandy, and boils any thing that is set over it much sooner than an ordinary fire. If green boughs, or any thing else that is combus∣tible, are laid over it, they are presently con∣sumed to ashes. Yet it is surprizing that the wa∣ter, as soon as the fire is put out, feels extremely cold; and that a piece of flesh broiled in the flame, has not the least taste of sulphur.</P>
<P>White Ladies, in the parish of Tonge. Here was anciently a famous nunnery, and in the neighbourhood is the grove of Boscobel, and in that the royal oak, in which king Charles II. hid himself for several days after the battle of Worcester. It is now surrounded with a brick∣wall; but has been almost all cut away by those, whom curiosity brought to see it. It is said, that after the restoration the king paid it a visit, and gathered some of its acorns, which he carried to London, planted in the park, or gardens, and used to water himself. While he sat in the oak, some of the parliament soldiers passed through the grove, close under the tree, in quest of him.</P>
<P>In this county the fishermen use a kind of boat, called a coracle, made of sallow-twigs interwoven, and the bottom covered with a horse's hide; in which one man will row himself along very swiftly with one hand, and with the other manage his fishing-tackle. The boat in its form is nearly
<PB N="368" REF="3810"/>
oval, five feet long, and three broad; and so light, that the fishermen carry it home on their backs, when they have done fishing.</P>
<P>Thomas Parr, who lived to the age of one hun∣dred and fifty, was a native of this county.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTENT and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>The length is reckoned at forty miles, the breadth at twenty-six, and the circumference at one hundred and forty-one. It contains five hun∣dreds, one hundred and fifty parishes, eight hun∣dred and ten thousand acres, one city, and eighteen market-towns.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>The air, except in those parts that are called the Moorlands and Woodlands, and about the mines, is good, especially upon the hills, where it is accounted very fine: but the soil in the northern mountainous part is not so fertile. In the middle, where it is watered by the Trent, the third river in England, it is both fruitful and pleasant, being a mixture of arable and meadow grounds. In the south, it abounds not only with corn, but with mines of iron, and with pits of coal.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS and MERES.</HEAD>
<P>The other rivers of this county, besides the Trent, which runs almost through the middle of it, and abounds with salmon, are the Dove and Tame, both which are well stored with fish. In
<PB N="370" REF="3830"/>
this county are also a great many lakes, or meres and pools, as they are called; which having streams either running into them or from them, cannot be supposed to be of any great prejudice to the air, and yield plenty of fish.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MEDICINAL WATERS.</HEAD>
<P>In divers parts of the county are medicinal wa∣ters, impregnated with different sorts of minerals, and consequently of different qualities and vir∣tues; as those at Hynts and Bresford-house, which are mixed with bitumen; those at Ingestre, Cod∣sal-wood, and Willough-bridge park, which are sulphureous. Of the saline kind, are the Brine∣pits at Chertley, Epson, Pensnet close, of which very good salt is made. There is a well at New∣castle under Line, that is said to cure the king's∣evil; another called Elder-well near Blemhill, said to be good for sore eyes; and a third called the Spa, near Wolverhampton.</P>
<P>Great flocks of sheep are bred in this county, especially in the moor-lands, or mountains of the northern part of it; but the wool is said to be somewhat coarser than that of many other counties. Of this wool, however, they make a variety of manufactures, particularly felts. In the low∣grounds along the rivers are rich pastures for black cattle; and vast quantities of butter and cheese are made there. In the middle and southern parts not only grain of all kinds, but a great deal of hemp and flax are raised. This county produces also lead, copper, iron, marble, alabaster, mill∣stones, limestones, coal, salt, marles of several sorts and colours, brick-earth, fullers earth, pot∣ters-clay; particularly a sort used in the glass ma∣nufacture at Amblecot, and sold at seven-pence a bushel; tobacco-pipe clay; a sort of reddish earth
<PB N="371" REF="3840"/>
called slip, used in painting divers vessels; red and yellow okers; fire-stones for hearths of iron fur∣naces, ovens, &amp;c. iron stones of several sorts; blood-stones, or haematites, found in the brook Tent, which, when wet a little, will draw red lines like ruddle; quarry-stones, and grind-stones.</P>
<P>For fuel the county is well supplied with turf, peat, and coal of several sorts, as cannel-coal, peacock-coal, and pit-coal. The cannel-coal burns as bright as the driest wood, and is suscep∣tible of a fine polish. The peacock-coal is so called, because, when turned to the light, it dis∣plays all the colours of the peacock's tail, but it is fitter for the forge than the kitchen. Of the pit-coal there is an inexhaustible store: it burns into white ashes, and leaves no such cinder as that of the Newcastle coal. It is not used for malt∣ing, till it is charred, and in that state it makes admirable winter fuel for a chamber.</P>
<P>This county is in the diocese of Litchfield and Coventry, and the Oxford circuit. It sends eight members to parliament; namely, two for the county, two for the city of Litchfield, two for Stafford, and two for Newcastle under Line.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Litchfield stands low, about three miles from the Trent. Its ancient name is said to have been Licidfield, signifying a field of carcasses, from a great number of Christians having, as it is pre∣tended, suffered martyrdom here in the persecu∣tion under Dioclesian. Though the bishop has his see here, yet he is denominated of Litchfield and Coventry. It is divided into two parts by a rivulet and a kind of shallow lake, over which are two causeways, with sluices. It is a long strag∣gling place; but has some very handsome houses,
<PB N="372" REF="3850"/>
and well paved, clean streets. That part on the south side of the rivulet is called the city, and the other the close, because it is enclosed with a wall, and a deep dry ditch. The city is much the largest, and contains several public structures; among others, an hospital, a gaol for felons and debtors apprehended within its liberties, which are ten or twelve miles in compass, and, with the city, make a distinct county. Here is also a free-school; there are three churches, and formerly there was a castle, of which there is nothing now remaining. Within the close stands the cathedral, a very magnificent structure. Its front, or por∣tico, is hardly to be paralleled in England; and it has three spires, exceeding lofty. The choir is paved with alabaster, and cannel-coal. Here also stand the palaces of the dean and bishop, and the houses of the prebendaries, which are very handsome. The town is a great thorough∣fare to the north-west counties, and is governed by two bailiffs, twenty-four burgesses, a recor∣der, a sheriff, a steward, and other officers. Of the ancient bishops of this see, the most eminent was St. Chad, who was canonized for his sanctity, and, as Bede writeth, was wont to read and pray in private, as often as he had leisure from preach∣ing the word of God. The city gives title of earl to the family of Lee, so created by Charles II. in 1674.</P>
<P>Stafford stands on the river Sow, over which it has a stone-bridge. It is well built and paved, and had formerly a castle and walls. Here both the assizes and quarter-sessions are held, by virtue of a statute of queen Elizabeth. The town gives title of earl to a popish branch of the family of Howard, and still retains the custom, called Bo∣rough-English. Here are two handsome churches, a free-school, a spacious market-place, and a
<PB N="373" REF="3860"/>
flourishing cloth manufacture. The corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, ten aldermen, twenty common-council-men, a town-clerk, and two serjeants at mace. The barony of this town is thought to have been once the largest in England, containing eighty villages and sixty knights fees.</P>
<P>Newcastle under Lime, or Line. This town stands on a branch of the Trent, and the castle was called new, to distinguish it from another older, at Chesterton under Lime. It has a ma∣nufacture of hats and cloth, and several great fairs for all sorts of cattle, and wool. The cor∣poration consists of a mayor, two justices, two bailiffs, and twenty-four capital burgesses, and has the privilege to determine actions under forty pounds value. The town is well supplied with fuel; for there are pits of coal on all sides of it.</P>
<P>These are the parliamentary towns. The other places worth mentioning are these.</P>
<P>Wolverhampton. The name of this town was originally Wulfrune's Hampton, the first part of which it had from Wulfruna, sister to king Edgar, who founded a priory here at her request. This place, by its high situation, enjoys a pure air, though in the neighbourhood of coal-mines; but suffers some inconvenience from the want of a sufficient supply of water, having only four weak springs, of different qualities as it would seem from the different uses to which they are ap∣plied, as is evident from their names, which are Pudding-Well, Washing-Well, Meat-Well, and Horse-Well. The name of the first may need some explanation. By pudding here is meant tripe, a signification different enough from what it has in some other parts of the kingdom. From these wells the water is brought in leathern budgets on horse-back. The town is populous,
<PB N="374" REF="3870"/>
well-built, and well paved, has a collegiate church annexed to the dean and chapter of Windsor, se∣veral charity schools, a weekly market, and a fair. But the chief support of the place are the lock∣smiths, reckoned the most ingenious in Eng∣land. Some of their locks are so curious, that they will shew how oft they have been shut in a year, as far as a thousand times, and some have even had chimes in them, that would go at any time, at the pleasure of the owner. There were once seventeen large villages in the parish, which was near thirty miles in com∣pass.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Walsal, or Walshall, are several iron mines, whence the inhabitants have the materials for their manufactures, which are spurs, bridle-bits, stirrups, buckles, &amp;c. The best sort of iron ore, called mush, is found in these mines. The town has a pleasant situa∣tion on the top of a hill, and is governed by a mayor, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Penkridge, or Penkrich, Cambden supposes to have been the Penoeracium of Antoninus; but Dr. Plot is of opinion, that it was at Stret∣ton. Here about Michaelmas is a great horse fair, to which horses are brought, and jockies re∣pair from all parts of England.</P>
<P>Rugeley, five miles from Litchfield, stands upon the river Trent, and is a handsome town, on the road from London to Lancashire and Cheshire. It has Cankwood-Chase, and a paper∣mili in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Burton was formerly noted for an abbey, a castle, and alabaster works, but now for its fine ale, and a bridge over the Trent, which is rec∣koned one of the finest pieces of workmanship, in England. It has thirty-seven arches of free∣stone, and is above a quarter of a mile in length.
<PB N="375" REF="3880"/>
Here was antiently a very rich Benedictine abbey, founded Anno 1004, whose abbot was mitred, and sat in parliament. Barges come up the river to the town, which consists chiefly of one street, extending from the abbey to the bridge. Here is a manufacture of cloth and in the neighbourhood is Needwood, a large forest, with many parks in it.</P>
<P>Tutbury, or Stutesbury, was antiently a strong castle, which at present is a good old house walled in, upon a hill, whence there is a very extensive prospect. Many parks in the neighbouring country belong to the honor and castle of Tutbury, and many estates are held of them.</P>
<P>Bromley Pagets. This town before the disso∣lution of the monasteries was called Abbots-Bromley, because it belonged to the abbey; but having been then given to the lord Paget, it took the name of Bromley Pagets. It stands on the skirts of the county towards Derbyshire, and is a pretty little town.</P>
<P>Uttoxeter, Ulcester, or Tocester. Here is one of the greatest markets in England for cattle, sheep, swine, butter, cheese, corn, and all pro∣visions. It is said the London factors will some times lay out five hundred pounds in a day upon these commodities. The town stands upon the side of a hill near the Dove, and is pretty large; but the buildings are but indifferent, though it has a very convenient neat market-plate.</P>
<P>Stone is said to have had its name from a heap of stones thrown up here, according to the cus∣tom of the Saxons, to preserve the memory of the barbarous murder, committed by Ulfere, king of Mercia, on his two sons, for embracing Chris∣tianity. This Ulfere, however, is reported to have turned Christian himself afterwards, and to
<PB N="376" REF="3890"/>
have been so zealous, as to demolish all the Pagan temples in his dominions, or convert them into churches or monasteries. The town stands upon the Trent, and, being a considerable thoroughfare, has several good inns.</P>
<P>Eccleshal is a neat little town, noted for pedlars wares. Here was antiently a castle built by Wal∣ter de Longton, bishop of Litchfield, in the reign of Edward I.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Chesterfield wall near Litchfield, was, most probably, the <HI>Etocetum</HI> of Antoninus; for here the place exhibits the remains of some antient town, and the distances mentioned in the Iti∣nerary agree best with it. At Checkley, in the church-yard, are three stones, erected spire∣wise, on two of which are images. The tradition of the place is that there was an engagement in a neighbouring field, called Naked-field, in which three bishops were slain, whose monuments these stones are. At Wrottesley, near Wolverhampton, are the ruins of some old city; and at Kinfare, in the neighbourhood, are those of a fortifica∣tion. At Dudley Castle, near Wolverhampton, in the hall is a table, made of a single oak plank, which measures seventeen yards in length, and a yard in breadth. It was at first seven yards nine inches more; but these were cut off, to suit it to the hall. This tree was of an enormous size, and grew in the New Park of Dudley. The cas∣tle is said to be as old as the year 700. It is cut out of a rock upon the top of a hill, whence there is a very extensive prospect. At Abbot's or Apewood Castle, near Seasdon on the edge of Shropshire, is an antient fortification, sup∣posed to be British. Upon Aswood-heath, in the
<PB N="377" REF="3900"/>
parish of King's-Swinford is a large entrench∣ment, supposed to be Roman. At Darlaston on the top of a hill are the ruins, according to tra∣dition, of the castle of the abovementioned king of the Mercians, who murdered his sons. In Beaudesert Park, near the Trent, are to be seen the remains of a large fortification called Castle-Hill.</P>

<P>Its greatest length is forty-four miles, its breadth twenty-five miles, and it is about a hundred and twenty in circumference.

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>Both the air and soil of this county in general are good. In the low grounds especially, the soil is rich, and produces plenty of corn and grass. Towards Staffordshire and Derbyshire, it is somewhat hilly, but not unfruitful. All over the county are spots of ground called mosses, consisting of a black, fat, unctuous kind of earth, which they cut into oblong squares, called peats, and dry in the sun for fuel. In these mosses are often found trunks of firs, sometimes several feet under ground, which the country people use both for fuel and candles. In this county are also many meres or lakes, and pools, all well stored with fish, besides the rivers Mersee, Weaver, and Dee, which last falls into a creek of the Irish sea at Chester.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="3920"/>
This county is also well wooded, having, be∣sides what grows in other places, the forests of Delamere and Macclesfield, which are very large: but what it is principally noted for, is cheese; though much of what is sold under that name in London and other places comes from Wales. The true Cheshire cheese is generally much esteemed, though many prefer that of Glocester to it, and that of Cheddar in Somersetshire to both.</P>
<P>A great deal of salt is made in this county, con∣cerning which we shall be more particular, when we come to the places where it is made.</P>
<P>William the Conqueror erected this county into a Palatinate, or county palatine, in favour of Hugh Lupus, his nephew, to whom he granted the same sovereignty and jurisdiction in it, as he had himself in the rest of the kingdom; for he gave it him, as the charter expresses it, to hold to him and his heirs, as freely by the sword as the king held the crown of England. By virtue of this grant, Chester enjoyed all sovereign jurisdic∣tion within its own precincts; and that in so high a degree, that the earls held parliaments, consist∣ing of their barons and tenants, and were not bound by the English acts of parliament; but this exorbitant power of the palatinates was at last reduced by Henry VIII. however all cases and crimes, except those of error, foreign plea, foreign voucher and high treason, are still heard and determined within the shire.</P>
<P>The earls were antiently superiors of the whole county, and all the landholders were mediately or immediately their vassals, and under the like sovereign allegiance and fealty to them, as they were to the kings of England; but the earldom was united to the crown by Edward III. since which time, the eldest sons of the kings of
<PB N="380" REF="3930"/>
England have always been earls of Chester, as well as princes of Wales.</P>
<P>This county, which is in the diocese of Chester, and the northern circuit, sends only four mem∣bers to parliament, namely, two for the county, and two for the city of Chester.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Chester, commonly called West-Chester, to distinguish it from many other Chesters in the kingdom, is a very antient city, supposed to have been founded by the Romans. It plainly appears to have been a Roman station by the many inscriptions, altars, coins, pavements of chequer work, vaults, and the foundations of vast buildings, that have been and still are dis∣covered in and about the town. This was among the last places that the Romans quitted; and here the Britons maintained their liberty long after the Saxons had got possession of the rest of the island; for it did not become subject to the Saxons, till about a hundred and fifty years after their first landing in England; nor was it long held by them then, but was soon retaken by the Britons, who remained masters of it, till they were finally dis∣possessed of it by Egbert, the first Saxon monarch, in the year 826. Here Edgar, in the 13th year of his reign, is said to have received the homage of the petty princes of Wales, of Man, and Cumberland, and also of the king of Scotland for the dominions he held of him in England. We are told that he made these princes row him up and down the Dee, and it is not unlikely, as they were not then in a condition to dispute his com∣mands, being at a distance from home, and en∣tirely in his power. King Edward III. made the Black Prince earl of Chester by patent, and ever
<PB N="381" REF="3940"/>
since the kings sons have been created earls of Chester, at the same time that they are created princes of Wales. Richard the Second made it a principality, annexing to it large possessions, which had come to the crown by the attainder of the earl of Arundel; but hither he himself was afterwards brought prisoner from Flint Castle, where he had resigned his crown, and then con∣veyed to London. His successor Henry IV. caused the act by which it and the county were erected into a principality to be repealed; but they still continued an earldom and a county palatine. King Henry VIII. made this city the see of a bishop, and both it and the county was at the same time impowered, by act of parliament, to elect members to represent them in that assembly. In the civil wars the city took part with the king, and was besieged by the parliament's forces, and in 1695, a mint was established in it for coining money.</P>
<P>As to its present state, it is a large, well built, wealthy city, and carries on a considerable trade. The houses are mostly of timber, with galleries, piazzas, and covered walls before them, by which not only the shops, but those who are walking about the town, are so hid that one would ima∣gine, there were scarce any inhabitants in it, though it is full of people. But though by this contrivance, such as walk the streets, are screened from rain, &amp;c. yet the shops are there∣by rendered dark and inconvenient. Notwith∣standing this disadvantage, it is a very handsome city, for the streets are generally strait and large, and cross one another at right-angles. The castle is strong, and has a constant garrison, and on the walls that surround the city is a plea∣sant walk, commanding a prospect of Flintshire and the mountains of Wales. Here is a noble
<PB N="382" REF="3950"/>
bridge of a dozen of arches over the Dee, which is the largest river on the west side of Britain, except the Severn and Clyde; but as it rises in the mountains of Wales, is liable to sudden and danger∣ous inundations, by which the town has sometimes suffered greatly. The cathedral is a very venerable pile, said to have been founded by Edgar the Saxon king, and to have been finished and endowed by Hugh Lupus, nephew to the Conqueror. But though it continued for some time after that to be the see of a bishop, yet it afterwards lost that dignity, and did not recover it till the reign of Henry VIII. when it had again a bishop of its own, and a diocese containing this county, to∣gether with Lancashire, Richmond, &amp;c. It was now subjected to the archbishop of York, though at first it had been in the province of Canter∣bury. As the river here was so choaked up with a sand-bank, that only small vessels could come up to the town, and the larger were forced to unload six miles below, a canal ten miles in length, in pursuance of two acts of parliament, was cut at a vast expence, through which large ships now come up to the town. This city, by the great annual fairs held in it, and by its situation in the neighbourhood of the Severn, Wales, and Ireland, enjoys a very considerable trade. It is not a little benefited by the great resort of passengers going to Ireland, or coming from it. Of the immense quantities of cheese made in the county, and for which it is so famous, much the greater part is sold here, and exported from hence to Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Bristol, and London, which, together with that which goes by land, is computed at about thirty thou∣sand tons a year.</P>
<P>In the hall of the castle, where the antient earls held their parliaments, the assizes are now
<PB N="383" REF="3960"/>
held twice a year for criminal causes; but all civil causes relating to the county, are determined in the palatine courts, held by a chamberlain, a special judge, or chief justice of Chester, two barons of the exchequer, three serjeants at law, an attorney, escheator, &amp;c. In the castle are also the office for the records, the prothonotary's office, and a prison for the county. The city is of a square form, about two miles in compass, and has four gates. There are assemblies in it every week. Its most considerable manufacture is that of tobacco-pipes. The city is well supplied with water from the river by means of mills. The fee-farm rents here belong to the princes of Wales, as earls of Chester. The inhabitants of the county at the change of every earl pay, or at least used formerly to pay, three thousand marks, and those of Flint, which was a part of the palatinate, two thousand. The jurisdiction of the chamberlain is the same in Cheshire, as that of the lord chancellor in the rest of the king∣dom. The officers belonging to the garrison here are a governor of the city and castle, a lieutenant governor, a master-gunner, store-keeper, and furbisher of small arms, &amp;c. Here is a custom-house, with a collector and other subordinate officers.</P>
<P>Malpas was antienly a castle, which is now in ruins. The town stands on a high hill near the Dee, and has a stately church, in which are the monuments of the Cholmondeley family, a grammar-school, an hospital, and a good mar∣ket. Its Latin name having been <HI>Mala platea,</HI> i. e. Ill street, the Normans called it Malpas, which signifies the same thing.</P>
<P>Cholmondeley; from hence a noble family of this county takes both their name and title. By writings, in the possession of this family, it ap∣pears,
<PB N="384" REF="3970"/>
that their name has been spelt more than twenty different ways. The place stands on the Weaver, three miles from Malpas.</P>
<P>Torperley is a great thoroughfare on the Chester road, and the place where the sheriffs turns are usually kept.</P>
<P>Nantwich, or Namptwich, is a large well built flourishing town. Though it hath been twice destroyed by fire, it hath so well recovered itself, that not the least vestige of those calamities appears. Its flourishing state is owing to its being a great thoroughfare to Ireland, to its weekly market for corn and cattle its fair, but chiefly to its salt works, and extraordinary fine cheese, which greatly exceeds that of the rest of the county. The salt springs generally lie all along the river Weaver, and are from three to seven yards deep, and about thirty miles from the sea. The water is so cold at the bottom of the pits, that those who cleanse them, cannot stay above half an hour, nor even so long without drinking strong waters. The brine of the several pits is not equally rich in salt. Of that in the township of Nantwich, six pounds will make one pound of salt. But it is observed by the briners, that the same quantity of brine will make more salt in a dry year, than in a wet season. For fuel they use Staffordshire pit coal. In making the salt, a certain quantity of cows, calves, or sheeps blood is mixed with the brine in the pan, and after it hath been boiled down to half the quantity, and scummed, a certain quantity of whites of eggs is mixed with it, and after that a proportion of the strongest ale. The brine is afterwards boiled gently till it gathers into corns, and a kind of scum, like a thin ice comes on it. They never cover their pans at all during the whole time of boiling. The pans are in houses like barns, and the brine is conveyed
<PB N="385" REF="3980"/>
to them in wooden troughs or gutters. The finest salt is that which is made up into loaves. Grey salt is only used by the poorer sort of peo∣ple to salt their bacon, coarse cheese, &amp;c. Catts are lumps of the worst sort of salt mixed with ashes and cummin seeds, and baked in ovens for pigeon houses. These salt-springs are supposed to have been known to the Romans, and an im∣post to have been laid by them upon the salt.</P>
<P>Northwich stands near the middle of the county, and seems to be very antient. Here is not only a deep and plentiful brine-pit, with a great many mines of rock salt, in which a number of men are continually at work with pickaxes, and dig it away in huge lumps, which are sent to the sea-ports, and there dissolved, and purified for use. When one is let down a hundred and fifty feet into the mines, he is strangely struck with the appearance of them. They look something like a vast cathedral of chrystal, supported by huge pillars, and glitter∣ing all over with a variety of colours, from the light of the candles. There is a grammar-school in the town, and a fine church, with a semi∣circular choir.</P>
<P>Middlewich: here also are brine-pits, where a great deal of salt is made. The brine of one pit is so rich, that it yields a fourth part in salt. This salt is exceeding good, and the bacon and beef cured with it, especially the hung beef, is ex∣tremely palatable. The town consists of several streets and lanes, and has a stately church, in which the Venables have a burying-place. It stands near the junction of the Creke and Dan, and is a borough governed by burgesses.</P>
<P>Sandbach: this place is famous for its ale. It stands on the river Wheelock, and has a market, and several fairs. On two little crosses in the
<PB N="386" REF="3990"/>

<P>Congleton is a handsome town upon the Dan, and a corporation, consisting of a mayor and six aldermen. It has two churches, and a manu∣facture of leather, gloves, purses, and points.</P>
<P>Macclesfield is one of the best towns in the county, and stands on the river Bollen. It gives title of earl to the family of Parker, and enjoys several privileges, by its situation in the liberties of the forest, to which it gives name. It is go∣verned by a mayor, and has a beautiful church, in which are several monuments, particularly of the Savages, earls Rivers. In an oratory be∣longing to that family is a brass plate with an inscription on it, promising a pardon of twenty∣six thousand years and twenty-six days, to who∣soever should say five Pater Nosters, and five Aves.</P>
<P>Knottesford, or Canutesford. This town is pleasantly situated on both sides of a rivulet called Bicken. It has a market, a church, and town∣house, and the manor belongs, or did belong, to the duke of Bridgewater.</P>
<P>Frodisham: here is a stone bridge over the Weaver, a castle, and a harbour for ships. It consists chiefly of one long street.</P>
<P>Halton, or Hault, i. e. High-Town: here is a castle still in good repair, said to have been built by High Lupus, nephew to William the Con∣queror, who gave it with the adjacent county, called the fee or honour of Halton, to Niget, a Norman. This honor is now a part of the dutchy of Lancaster, and has a jurisdiction, a court of record, a prison, and many privileges annexed to it. Felony and thieves are tried at Chester; but the court of the honour, which is held every fortnight, and the officers of the dutchy of Lan∣caster, have the cognizance of other matters.</P>

<HEAD>DERBYSHIRE, its BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the east by Not∣tinghamshire, and a part of Leicestershire, which last bounds it also on the south; on the west by Staffordshire, and part of Cheshire; and on the north by Yorkshire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTENT and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>It is near forty miles in length from south to north, about thirty in breadth on the north-side, but on the south no more than six, and in cir∣cumference about a hundred and thirty, contain∣ing about six hundred and eighty thousand acres, one hundred and six parishes, fifty-three vicarages, six hundreds, five hundred villages, eleven mar∣ket towns, about twenty-one thousand two hun∣dred houses, and one hundred and twenty-seven thousand inhabitants.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The air, especially on the east side of it, is pleasant and healthful; but on the west side about the beak, it is sharper, and more subject to wind and rain.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>In different parts of the county the soil is very different. In the east and south parts it is very fruitful in all kinds of grain, especially barley, and is therefore well inhabited, especially by maltsters, who carry on a good trade both in malt and ale;
<PB N="389" REF="4020"/>
but in the west part beyond the Derwent, it is barren and mountainous, producing nothing but a little oats. However, as there is plenty of grass in the vales, and some on the hills, large flocks of sheep and other cattle are fed on them. This part of the county is called the Peak, from a Saxon word signifying an eminence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>The chief mountains are those of the Peak, very high, bleak, and barren, but profitable to the inhabitants, yielding great quantities of the best lead, antimony, mill-stones, scythe∣stones, and grind-stones, marble, alabaster, a coarse sort of chrystal, azure, spar, green, and white vitriol, allom, iron, and pit-coal. Such quantities of wood are consumed at the lead and iron mines, and coal delfs, that very little is left.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS and LAKES.</HEAD>
<P>The chief rivers are the Dove and Derwent. The Dove is so called from the colour of its waters, which bear a resemblance to the bird of that name. It rises in the Peak, and divides this county from Staffordshire, till it falls into the Trent five miles north of Burton. It pro∣duces excellent trouts and graylings, and fer∣tilizes the land so much, when it overflows its banks, that its waters are thought to be impreg∣nated with lime stone. It will sometimes swell so much in twelve hours, as to carry away sheep and other cattle, and return as suddenly to its old channel.</P>
<P>The Derwent rises also in the Peak, and takes its course across the county from north-west to south-east, till it falls into the Trent eight miles
<PB N="390" REF="4030"/>
below Derby. Its waters look black from the soil through which it runs.</P>
<P>Upon a naked moor or plain, thirteen miles in length, north of Chatsworth, is a large pond, which covers near thirty acres, receiving as in a cistern all the waters that descend from the sur∣rounding hills, and by pipes supplying all the ponds, canals, cascades, and water-works in the gardens of that palace.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES, NATURAL and ARTIFICIAL.</HEAD>
<P>Of these the chief are the wonders of the Peak, as they are called, which are commonly reckoned seven. The first is the noble palace of the duke of Devonshire, called Chatsworth. It was built by the first duke of Devon, and can hardly be matched for beauty and magnificence: but the chapel and hall are particularly remarkable, being adorned with the finest paintings by Signior Verrio. In the chapel is a representation of the resurrection, and in the hall a picture of Caesar stabbed in the senate. The duke's closet, at the upper end of a noble range of chambers finely inlaid, is curiously embellished with Indian paint and figures of birds drawn by native Indians. The gardens are very noble, and admirably adorned with statues and water works. Among the statues and fi∣gures are several Gladiators in very lively atti∣tudes; Neptune with his nymphs, sporting as it were in the waters, which fall from a cock, in several columns, upon sea-weeds; sea-horses rolling in a pond; a willow of copper, every leaf of which upon the turning of a cock drops water as if it rained; two sea nymphs at the top of a cascade, in a grove of cypress, with jars under their arms, from which water falls with a noise like that of a cataract; an artificial rose in a pond, through which, upon the turn of a cock,
<PB N="391" REF="4040"/>
the water ascends, and exhibits the figure of that flower in the air; in another pond Mercury point∣ing at the gods, and throwing up water. In short, they are adorned in the most exquisite man∣ner imaginable, both by nature and art. Here Mary, queen of Scots, passed seventeen years when a prisoner in England, and there is an apartment that still bears her name. Marshal Tallard too spent a few days here, and was so charmed with the place, and the politeness of its owner, that he said at his departure, "that when he returned to France, and reckoned up the days of his captivity in England, he would leave out those he passed at Chatsworth."</P>
<P>To render this place still more romantic, there is an exceeding high mountain on the east side covered with tall trees, rising above one another to the top, on which they dig mill-stones; and be∣fore the west front runs the Derwent, which, when not swelled with rains, or the melting of the snow on the neighbouring mountains, glides peaceably along; but when rouzed, it makes a roaring noise like that of the sea in stormy weather breaking upon the rocks. There is a stately bridge over the river, and in an island near it a building resembling a castle. In the front of the palace towards the gardens, and under the cornice of the frieze, is the family motto, <HI>Cavendo tutus,</HI> which, though consisting of but twelve letters, extends the whole length of the front. The windows of the Attic story are se∣venteen feet high, of polished looking-glass, and the wood-work double gilt. Beyond the gardens lies the park, taking in some hills, which are overlooked by other hills behind them. A stranger coming from the north is equally charmed and amazed to behold such a delightful valley and noble palace, amidst such wild rocks and moun∣tains,
<PB N="392" REF="4050"/>
and after passing through a moor naked and dreary, and of great extent.</P>
<P>The second wonder is the mountain called Mam-tor, or Mother-tower. It stands on the north side of the road from Buxton to Castleton. There are several lead-mines at the bottom of it.</P>
<P>Elden-hole makes the third wonder or curiosity of the Peak. It is a dreadful chasm in the side of a mountain, of an unfathomable depth; so that a line and plummet of near nine hundred yards, has been let down without reaching the bottom. In the reign of queen Elizabeth a poor man having been let down two hundred yards and drawn up again, was found to have lost his senses, and died soon after of a phrenzy. The water, which is continually trickling from its top, is pre∣sently congealed into icicles; and when a stone is thrown into it, it rebounds from side to side for a long time, making a noise like thunder, until the sound is at length entirely lost.</P>
<P>Buxton-Wells constitute the fourth curiosity. The country where they lie is healthy and plea∣sant: there are nine of them. They rise near the head of the river Wye, at the village of Buxton. The water is hot, sulphureous, and saline, yet very palatable when drank. They create a good appetite, and remove obstructions, but are not purgative. They are of a mode∣rate heat, and being recommended both inter∣nally and externally in rheumatic, scorbutic, and nervous complaints are much resorted to in the summer season. They are inclosed with a fair stone building, erected by George, earl of Shrews∣bury. There are convenient lodgings in the vil∣lage for persons of all ranks. The duke of De∣vonshire, who is lord of the place, has built a large house for the reception of strangers; and the bath-room, being arched over, is very con∣venient
<PB N="393" REF="4060"/>
and pleasant. It will admit twenty people at a time to walk and swim in it. The water is blood warm, and may be raised to any height at pleasure. It appears they were known to the Ro∣mans; for they have been mentioned by some Roman authors, and some remains of a Roman causeway and wall are still visible. It is worth ob∣serving, that there is a cold spring within five feet of one of the hot wells.</P>
<P>Weeding-Well, or Tides, make the fifth won∣der. It is a spring near the town of Tiddeswall, that ebbs and flows irregularly; which phaenome∣non is supposed to be owing to the different pres∣sure of the air upon the subterraneous waters.</P>
<P>The sixth wonder is Pool's-Hole, a cave at the foot of a high hill, called Coitmoss, so nar∣row at the entrance, that one is obliged to creep on all fours; but it soon opens to a consider∣able height, extending to above a quarter of a mile, with a roof somewhat resembling that of an ancient cathedral. By the petrifying water continually dropping in several parts of the cave, are formed a variety of curious figures and repre∣sentations of the works both of nature and art. There is a column here clear as alabaster, which is called the queen of Scots pillar; because she is said to have proceeded so far, when she visited this place. If a pistol is fired by this pillar, it will make a report as loud as that of a cannon Near the extremity there is a hollow in the roof, called the Needle's-Eye, in which if a candle is placed, it will represent a star in the firmament. At a little distance from this cave is a small clear stream made up of hot and cold water, so near each other, that the finger and thumb of the same hand may be put, the one into the hot, and the other into the cold.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="4070"/>
The seventh wonder is what they call the Devil's A—se, or Peak's A—se, which is a huge cavern at the bottom of a hill near Castleton, with seve∣ral streams of water in it. In several places the vault makes a fine appearance, being chequered with stones of various colours. There are poor people that have huts in a vault hard by, who are always ready to bring candles to shew strangers the place.</P>
<P>There are some other things about the Peak worth mentioning besides these.</P>
<P>Near a village called Byrchover, there are two tottering stones upon a rock, of which one is very large; and yet is so equally poised upon the point on which it rests, that it may be moved with a finger.</P>
<P>In sinking a lead groove near Bradwall, a mon∣strous tooth was found, which though not en∣tire, measured thirteen inches and a half in com∣pass, and weighed near four pounds; and a skull, that held seven pecks of corn. Some think these bones belonged to human bodies, others to those of brute animals; while a third set, among whom is Dr. Leigh, think they are only the sportings of nature, like those found in Pool's-hole, and the mines of this country.</P>
<P>At the bottom of several mountains are open∣ings, called by the country people swallows; be∣cause, though several streams enter into them, no vent appears; but both these, and those in the Devil's A—se, are supposed to form the water that issue from the mountains near Castleton.</P>
<P>Besides those of Buxton, there are medicinal waters at several other places in the county, as at Stanley and Quarendon, near Derby, which are chalybeate; at Kedlaston, which are said to be good for the leprosy, and old ulcers; at Matlock, a village upon the Derwent, which are milk-warm,
<PB N="395" REF="4080"/>
and very pleasant and wholesome to bathe in; but the road to it is very bad and dangerous, and the accommodation but indifferent. As there is plenty of stones hereabouts, the fields are all en∣closed, not with trees and hedges, but stone-walls. Here are smelting-mills for the lead-ore, which, by the help of moulds, is fashioned into pigs. Over against Matlock there is a dreadful pile of rocks, called the Torr.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>The county town is Derby, which gives name to the shire. It is supposed to be so called from having been a park or shelter for deer; and what makes this supposition probable, is, that the arms of the town consist of a buck couchant in a park. It is a neat town, full of people, and sends two members to parliament. It is watered by two rivers, or rather a river and a brook; and yet the latter hath nine bridges over it, and the former only one. It is ancient, having been a royal borough in the time of Edward the Confessor. It appears to have had a castle formerly, but of that no ves∣tiges now remain. In digging for foundations human bones of a monstrous size have been found. It is divided into five parishes, each having its church, of which the most remarkable is that of All-Saints, built about the reign of queen Mary. One half of the expence was de∣frayed by the batchelors and maidens of the town. There are several noble monuments in it, espe∣cially of the Cavendish family, of which the most remarkable is that for the countess, who built the first palace at Chatsworth, and founded an hospital here for four poor men, and as many women. One Richard Crashaw, who was a poor nailer's son, and died in 1631, has a monument here. He
<PB N="396" REF="4090"/>
went from hence in a leathern doublet to Lon∣don, where he became rich, and left four thousand pounds to charities.</P>
<P>The trade of the place consists in wool, buying and selling corn, making malt, and ale, of which considerable quantities are sent to London. By a charter from Charles I. the government of the town is vested in a mayor, high-steward, nine al∣dermen, a recorder, town-clerk, fourteen bre∣thren, and fourteen common-council men; and here the assizes and sessions are usually kept. It hath given title of earl to many noble families, but at present to that of Stanley. Among the privileges granted to the citizens by different kings, is that of paying no toll except in Win∣chester, and some few other places; of having a coroner; of not being liable to be impleaded out of their borough; of having a power to exclude all Jews from selling in the town. There were anciently three monasteries in it, besides several in the neighbourhood. The fee-farm rent of the town and manor, which before belonged to the dutchy of Lancaster, was granted by Henry VIII. to the dean and chapter of Burton on Trent. It has three weekly markets, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, besides several fairs.</P>
<P>Here is that curious machine for thrown silk, the model of which Sir Thomas Lombe, at the hazard of his life, brought from Italy. Before that period, the English merchants used to purchase thrown silks of the Italians for ready money. By the help of this wonderful ma∣chine, one hand-mill will twist as much silk, as fifty people could do without it. It works seventy-three thousand seven hundred and twenty six yards of silk thread every time the water wheel goes round, which is thrice in a minute. The house, in which it is contained, is five or six
<PB N="397" REF="4100"/>
stories high, and half a quarter of a mile in length. When Sir Thomas's patent expired in 1732, the parliament was so sensible of the value and importance of it, that they granted him a further recompence of fourteen thousand pounds, for the hazard and expence he had incurred in intro∣ducing and erecting it, upon condition he should allow an exact model of it to be taken; which model is deposited in the Tower of London, in order to prevent an art so curious and import∣ant from being lost.</P>
<P>Another considerable town is Worksworth, the greatest market for lead in England, the furnaces for smelting it being here, and at Creich, a vil∣lage on the other side the Derwent. The Miners, or Peak rills, as they are called, are a rude boorish sort of people, but very bold and dexterous in working under ground; so that they are often employed in sapping at sieges. Controversies among them are determined by a court, called Barmoot. The produce of the mines in this hun∣dred is very considerable. The king claims the thirteenth penny; but in lieu thereof, they give a thousand pounds a year. It has a handsome church, a free-schóol, and alms-house. The tythe of Worksworth yields sometimes a thousand pounds sterling. Its market is on Tuesday.</P>
<P>Askborn stands on the east side of the Dove, in a rich soil; but has little trade, except in cheese.</P>
<P>Chesterfield is the most considerable town in Scarsdale, a fruitful valley, so called from being surrounded with rugged rocks, which in the Saxon are styled Scarrs. It is a handsome populous town, governed by a mayor and aldermen, and gives the title of earl to a branch of the noble fa∣mily of Stanhope. It was made a free borough by king John, and near it the barons were de∣feated by Henry III. It had formerly a monastery,
<PB N="398" REF="4110"/>
and has now a handsome church, a free-school, and carries on a great trade in lead, leather, stock∣ings, bedding, blankets, &amp;c. with all the neigh∣bouring counties, and with London, Liverpool, Manchester, and other towns.</P>
<P>Bakewell is a good town standing on the north∣west side of the Peak, near where the Wye falls into the Derwent. It makes but one parish, but has seven chapels; and being a peculiar, is ex∣empt from episcopal jurisdiction. From some altars of rough stone found in the neighbour∣hood, it appears to have been a Roman station. Its market is on Monday.</P>
<P>Alfreton, a contraction, as is supposed, of Al∣fred's town, stands also on Scarsdale. The only thing it is noted for is its ale, which is strong, and has a fine flavour.</P>
<P>At no great distance from Alfreton stands Bal∣sover, a large town and castle, upon a rising ground. Its only manufacture is fine tobacco-pipes.</P>
<P>These are the principal towns in Derbyshire. The whole county sends but four members to parliament, two for Derby, and two for the shire; and is in the diocese of Litchfield and Coventry.</P>

<HEAD>NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, its BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the east by Lin∣colnshire, on the south-east and south by Leices∣tershire, on the west by Derbyshire, and on the north and north-west by Yorkshire. It extends in length forty-three miles, twenty-four in breadth, and one hundred and ten miles in compass; contain∣ing five hundred and sixty thousand acres, eight hundreds, nine market-towns, one hundred and sixty-eight parishes, four hundred and fifty vil∣lages, about seventeen thousand five hundred and ninety-four houses, and ninety five thousand inha∣bitants. No county in England enjoys a plea∣santer and healthier air. As for the soil it differs widely in different parts of the county. Towards the west, where lies the forest of Sherwood, it is sandy, and therefore that part of the county is called by the inhabitants, the Sand; but the south and east parts, watered by the Trent and the rivulets that fall into it, are clayey, and for that reason are called by the inhabitants, the Clay. The latter is fruitful both in corn and pasture; but the former produces little be∣sides wood, coal, and some lead. The county has a variety of commodities and manufac∣tures, as wool, leather, tallow, butter, cheese,
<PB N="401" REF="4140"/>
coal, marle, cattle, malt, liquorice, stockings, glass, earthen-wares, and strong ale. The prin∣cipal rivers are the Trent and Idle. The Trent, whose name is supposed to be derived either from the French or Latin word signifying thirty, either because it receives thirty smaller rivers, or has thirty different sorts of fish in it, is inferior to no rivers in England, but the Severn, Thames, and Humber. It enters the county on the south-west, and passes through it to the north-east, where it enters Lincolnshire, and after a long course falls at last into the Humber. The Idle rises in Sher∣wood-forest, and after traversing the northern part of the county, falls into the Trent upon the bor∣ders of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.</P>
<P>The spacious forest of Sherwood lies in the west part of the county, and indeed takes up the greatest part of it. It was formerly so thick, that it was hardly passable; but now it is much thinner. It feeds an infinite number of deer and stags; and has some towns in it, of which Mansfield is the chief. It abounds in coal, and a road lies through it for thirty miles together. Since the reign of king Edward I. the nobility and gentry have had grants of it. It is governed by a great number of officers under the earl of Chesterfield, chief forester, whose ancestor, Sir John Stanhope, had a grant of it, with liberty to destroy and kill at pleasure, reserving only an hundred deer in the whole walk.</P>
<P>The principal towns of the county are these:</P>
<P>Nottingham, which gives name to the county, is a handsome town, and a county of itself by charter. The name is derived from the Saxon word <HI>Snottengham,</HI> which signifies caves, from the caves and apartments anciently dug in the rocks on which the town stands. These, being soft, easily yield to the spade and pick-axe, whence the
<PB N="402" REF="4150"/>
townsmen have excellent cellars for the vast quan∣tities of malt liquors made here, and sent, as well as their malt, to most parts of England. The si∣tuation of the town is very pleasant, having mea∣dows on one hand, and hills of a gentle, easy ascent, on the other. It is well supplied with fuel, both wood and coal, from the forest, and with fish by the Trent, which runs about a mile to the south of it, and has been made navigable for barges: so that they receive by it not only great quantities of cheese from Warwickshire and Staffordshire; but all their heavy goods from the Humber, and even from Hull. It is of great antiquity, and had an∣ciently a very strong castle, where is now a fine seat belonging to the duke of Newcastle. It is noted for its horse-races on a fine course on the north side of the town. The corporation is go∣verned by a mayor, recorder, six aldermen, two coroners, two sheriffs, two chamberlains, and twenty-four common-council men, eighteen of the senior council, and six of the junior, a bell∣bearer, and two pindars, one for the fields, and the other for the meadows. The town being within the jurisdiction of the forest, the former of these pindars is town-woodward, and attends the forest courts. It has three neat churches, the chief of which is St. Mary's, and an alms-house endowed with one hundred pounds a year for twelve poor people; with a noble town-house, sur∣rounded with piazzas. A considerable trade is carried on in glass and earthen-wares, and frame∣stockings, besides the malt, and malt-liquors, mentioned above. Marshal Tallard, when a pri∣soner in England, was confined to this town and county. In the duke of Newcastle's park there is a ledge of rocks hewn into a church, houses, chambers, dove-houses, &amp;c. The altar of the
<PB N="403" REF="4160"/>
church is natural rock, and between that and the castle there is an hermitage of the like workman∣ship. Upon the side of a hill there is a very ex∣traordinary sort of a house, where you enter at the garret, and ascend to the cellar, which is at the top of the house. Here is a noted hospital founded by John Plumtree, esquire, in the reign of Richard II. for thirteen poor old widows; and four handsome bridges over the Trent and Lind. To keep these in repair, and other uses, the cor∣poration has good estates. This town and Win∣chelsea both give title of earl to the noble fa∣mily of Finch. Here David, king of Scots, when a prisoner in England, resided, and under∣ground is a vault, called Mortimer's hole, because Roger Mortimer, earl of March, is said to have absconded in it, when he was taken and hanged by order of Edward III. If any would know the ancient religious foundation here, let him consult Dr. Thoroton. It has a market on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, besides several fairs.</P>
<P>Another neat well-built town is Newark upon Trent, so called from a castle built here by the bishop of Lincoln, in the reign of king Stephen. It is a great thoroughfare on the north road, and stands on an island formed by the Trent, over which there are handsome bridges. Here king John died on his way to Lincoln; and the castle made an obstinate defence, first for king John, and afterwards for king Charles I. but was demo∣lished, after it had been surrendered to the Scots by the king's command, when he put himself into their hands. Some antiquities have been found about it, particularly four urns, and a houshold god of brass. The church has a lofty spire, and is reckoned one of the finest in England; and the market-place is so spacious, that ten thousand
<PB N="404" REF="4170"/>
men were drawn up in it by lord Bellasis, when he defended the town against the Scots in the civil wars. It is a corporation governed by a mayor and twelve aldermen, sends two members to parlia∣ment, gives the title of viscount to the duke of Kingston, and carries on a good trade in corn, cattle, and wool.</P>
<P>East Redford is an ancient borough surround∣ed with plantations of hops. It is a corporation governed by two bailiffs, a steward, who are to be justices of the peace, and of the quorum within the borough, twelve aldermen, two chamberlains, a town-clerk, and two serjeants at mace; and it enjoys many privileges granted by several kings, with power to alter their common seal at pleasure. It has a handsome church, visited every year by the archbishop of York, or the archdeacon of Nottingham, a free grammar-school, the best shambles in the county, and carries on a pretty good trade in hops, malt, and barley.</P>
<P>West Redford, so called because it stands on the west side of the Idle, opposite to the other, to which it is joined by a bridge, has nothing re∣markable in it, besides Trinity-hospital, founded in the year 1666, by John Dorrel. It is governed by a master, who is always to be the subdean of Lincoln, and ten brethren, who can let leases for twenty-one years. The master has fifteen pounds a year, and each of the brethren ten pounds, be∣sides ten pounds for a load of coals every year, and six yards of cloth for a gown every other year. There is also an allowance of ten pounds for the maintenance of a scholar in Exeter college in Ox∣ford, where the founder was a student, and others for under officers; in particular, for one of the brethren to read prayers.</P>
<P>Mansfield is a large town in Sherwood forest.
<PB N="405" REF="4180"/>
Its market is well supplied with corn and cattle, and it drives a considerable trade in malt. Our kings used formerly to visit this place often, on account of hunting, which might give rise to the song and story of the Miller of Mansfield; and it appears from an old inquisition, that the manor of Cukeney in this county was held by serjeanty for shoeing the king's horses when he came to Mansfield. Several odd customs are mentioned in an old parchment of the manor of Mansfield∣forest; as first, That the tenants be all free of blood, and may marry themselves according to their wills, whether men or women. Secondly, That the heirs be of full age as soon as they are born. Third∣ly, That lands be divisible among sons, and if there be no sons among daughters; and the like. An estate, called Wolf-hunt-land, was formerly held here by the service of winding an horn, and frightening away the wolves in the forest of Sher∣wood. The town either took its name from, or gave it to Mansfield in Germany, the first count of which it is said was born here. It gives the title of baron to the right honourable William Murray, lord chief-justice of England.</P>
<P>Tuxford, situated between Newark and Baw∣tree, in that part of the county called the South-Clay, to distinguish it from another called the North-Clay. It has a free-school, built by Charles Read, esquire, and endowed with fifty pou ds a year for a master and usher, twenty pounds for boarding and teaching four ministers sons, or those of decayed gentlemen, and twenty pounds for teaching the town boys. The mayor and al∣dermen of Newark and six neighbouring gentle∣men, are the trustees for it.</P>
<P>Worksop, a small town noted for plenty of li∣quorice and malt. The ruins of a monastery
<PB N="406" REF="4190"/>
founded here in the reign of Henry I. are still to be seen at the east end of the town.</P>
<P>Southwell. Here is a very ancient collegiate church, supposed to have been founded, anno 636, by Paulinus, archbishop of York. It was sur∣rendered at the dissolution of the monasteries to Henry VIII. but, as appears by an inscription in the church, refounded at the instance of the arch∣bishop of York. The chapter has a peculiar ju∣risdiction over twenty-eight parishes, to most of which it has the right of presentation, besides others in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. It has also a civil jurisdiction, to which about twenty towns are subject, for which the custos rotu∣lorum and justices are nominated by the arch∣bishop of York. The church is a plain Gothic building without any painted glass or other orna∣ment, and is reputed the mother-church of the town and county of Nottingham. The arch∣bishops of York had formerly a large palace here, with three parks adjoining well stored with deer; but it hath been long in ruins, and the estate de∣mised in lease. They are, however, still lords of the manor, and enjoy great privileges here. Ad∣joining to the church is a free-school, where the choiristers and town boys are taught gratis. The master is chose by the chapter, but must be ap∣proved by the archbishop of York. There are two fellowships and two scholarships in St. John's college in Cambridge, to be presented, by the will of the founder, to such as have been choiristers of the church at Southwell. From this town the family of the Southwells took their name, and were anciently seated here. On the south side of this county stands Go∣tham, that is Goats-home, from the goats, it is likely, that were anciently kept there, a place noted for the pretended stupidity of its inhabi∣tants;
<PB N="407" REF="4200"/>
so that, by a wise man of Gotham, is meant a fool: yet, in fact, the inhabitants are not greater blockheads than their neighbours, and some men eminent for their wisdom and learn∣ing have been born here; among others William de Gotham, who in Edward the Second's time was twice chancellor of the university of Cambridge.</P>
<P>Blithe is a noted market-town, and had formerly a castle and monastery, of which scarce any vestiges now remain.</P>
<P>Bingham is a small place; but the personage, which is in the gift of the earl of Chesterfield, is very valuable.</P>
<P>Granby is worth mentioning only for giving title of marquis to the duke of Rutland; and Aslakton for being the birth-place of Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury.</P>

<P>From several coins of Constantine found at Long-Collingham, it would appear to have been a Roman station. Roman coins also have been found at Willoughby on the Would, near the Roman fosse-way, at Steanford, at Welford, and at East Bridgeford, in a field called Burrowfield, where are the remains of a Roman station. At Barton are the remains of a camp, supposed to be British, where many coins have been found. Many cornelians with Roman engravings; and, not long since a Druid amulet of an aqueous trans∣parent colour, with streaks of yellow, have been found at Tyln in the parish of Hayton. Those

<HEAD>SOIL and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>It is a champaign country in general, and abun∣dantly fertile in corn and grass, being watered by several rivers, as the Soure, or Sare, which passes through the middle of it, and abounds in excel∣lent salmon and other fish, the Wreke, Trent, Eye, Sense, Auker, and Aven. These rivers be∣ing mostly navigable, greatly facilitate the trade of the county. In some parts there is a great scarcity of fuel, both wood and coal; but in the more hilly parts there is plenty of both, together with great flocks of sheep. Besides wheat, bar∣ley, oats, and pease, it produces the best beans in England. They grow so tall and luxuriant in some places, particularly about Barton in the Beans, that they look towards the harvest time like a forest; and the inhabitants eat them not only when they are green, as in other places, but all the year round, for which reason their neigh∣bours nickname them bean-bellies, and will tell you, that if you shake a Leicestershire man by the collar, the beans will rattle in his belly. They have plenty of very good wool, of which they
<PB N="410" REF="4230"/>
not only make great quantities of stockings, but send a great quantity unmanufactured into other parts of England. They make great profit of their corn and pulse, and likewise breed great num∣bers of coach and dray horses, most of the gen∣tlemen being grasiers; and it is not uncommon to rent grass farms from five hundred to two thou∣sand pounds a year. It is in the midland circuit and diocese of Lincoln, and sends four members to parliament, two for Leicester, and two for the county.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>The principal is Leicester, that is a city upon the Leire, now called Soare. From its situation on the Fosse-way, and the many coins and anti∣quities discovered here, it seems probable, that it was a place of some note in the time of the Romans. In the time of the Saxons, it was a bishop's see, and afterwards so repaired and for∣tified by Edelfleda, that it became, according to Matthew Paris, a most wealthy place, having thirty-two parish churches: but in Henry the Second's reign it was in a manner quite ruined, for joining in rebellion against him with Robert earl of Leicester. In the reign of Edward III. however, it began to recover, by the favour of his son Henry Plantagenet, duke and earl of Lan∣caster, who founded and endowed a collegiate church and hospital here. It is a borough and corporation, governed by a mayor, recorder, steward, bailiff, twenty-four aldermen, forty-eight common-council men, a solicitor, a town-clerk, and two chamberlains. It had its first charter from king John. The freemen are exempt from paying toll in all the fairs and markets of England. It has three hospitals, that mentioned above built by Henry Plantagenet, duke of Lancaster, and
<PB N="411" REF="4240"/>
capable of supporting an hundred aged people decently; another erected and endowed in the reign of Henry VIII. for twelve poor lazars, and another for six widows. The castle was a prodigious large building, where the duke of Lancaster kept his court. The hall and kitchen still remain entire, of which the former is very spacious and lofty, and in the tower over one of the gateways is kept the magazine for the county militia. There was a famous monas∣tery here antiently called, from its situation in the meadows, St. Mary de Pratis or Prez. In these meadows is now the course for the horse race. It is said that Richard III. who was killed at the battle of Bosworth, lies interred in St. Margaret's church. We cannot omit here a me∣morable epitaph in St. Martin's church, import∣ing that one Heyric, who died in 1489, aged seventy-six, lived in one house with Mary his wife fifty-two years; and in all that time never buried man, woman, or child, though some∣times twenty in family. Mary, at her death, in December 1711, could number a hundred and forty-three persons descended from her. The chief business of Leicester is the stocking trade, which hath produced, in general, to the amount of sixty thousand pounds a year. In a parlia∣ment held here in the reign of Henry V. the first law for the burning of heretics was made, levelled against the followers of Wickliff, who was rector of Lutterworth in this county, and where his pulpit is said still to remain. The town suffered greatly in the civil wars, by two sieges upon the back of one another. It has given the title of earl to several noble families, and last to Thomas Coke, lord Lovel, created earl of Leicester in 1744. It has a market every Sa∣turday.</P>

Bosworth is famous for the battle fought in a place called Red-more Plain, three miles from the town, which put an end to the contest between the houses of York and Lancaster. Pieces of armour of different kinds are frequently found there; and there is an artifical mount from which Henry VII. is said to have made a speech to his army before the battle. To distinguish it from another Bosworth in the county, it is called Market-Bos∣worth.</P>
<P>Harborough stands on the river Welland, on the high road from London to Derby. The town has no lands belonging to it; whence came the proverb that a goose will eat up all the grass growing in Harborough; and it is usual to threaten to throw children into Harborough field. It gives the title of earl to Philip lord Sherrard.</P>
<P>Ashby de la Zouch, so called from the Zouches, who were formerly lords of it, stands pleasantly between two parks on the skirts of Derby∣shire. Its fairs are noted for horses of a large breed. The town had once a castle, now de∣molished. In the civil wars it had a garrison for the king, called the maiden garrison, because it was never attacked by the parliament's forces. In the church, which is large and handsome, the Hastings, earls of Huntington, have several fine monuments, and in their gift is the free-school, which has a liberal stipend, besides other cha∣ritable funds. The place is noted for its good ale, and for the politeness of its inhabitants. James I. and his court passed several days with the then earl, in his castle here, when dinner was served up every day by thirty poor knights, with gold chains and velvet gowns.</P>
<P>Lutterworth: here the famous Wickliff, who paved the way for the reformation, was rector. The pulpit, out of respect to the memory of that
<PB N="413" REF="4260"/>
worthy divine, hath been left standing, though every thing else within the church is new. He died and was buried here in peace; but his bones were taken out of the grave forty years after, by order of the council of Constance, and burnt.</P>
<P>Melton Mowbray, so called from its antient lords of the name of Mowbray, is a handsome town, and has a market, the most considerable for cattle of any in that part of England. Here are two fine bridges over the Eye, by which the town is almost surrounded.</P>
<P>Burton-Lazers: in this town was the chief hos∣pital for lepers in England, to which all the rest were subject, as it was to that at Jerusalem. It is said to have been built by the Mowbrays, assisted by a general collection throughout England in the reign of Henry I. when the leprosy ran by infec∣tion over the whole kingdom.</P>
<P>Coal-Overton is so called from the coal, which is dug up here in such plenty, as to supply the neighbouring country all round with firing. Here is also a noted mineral water called Griffy-Dain.</P>
<P>Thurcaston is noted for the birth of that good prelate and devout martyr Hugh Latimer.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The chief antiquity is the Roman military highway, called Watling Street, which shews it∣self here very plainly, and runs northward, almost in a direct line, along the west side of the county. It is said to have begun at Dover, and to have passed through the midst of Kent by London; thence by St. Albans, Dunstable, Stratford, Tou∣cester, Littleborne, St. Gilbert's Hill, near Shrews∣bury; thence by Stratton, and so through the
<PB N="414" REF="4270"/>
middle of Wales to Cardigan. Near Lutterworth is a water so cold, that in a little time it converts straws and sticks into stone. The Bennones in the Itinerary of Antoninus are supposed to have been about Cleybrook, both because the two prin∣cipal antient ways crossed there, and because antient coins and foundations of buildings have been discovered on this spot. The name of Bens∣ford-bridge, not far off, is also thought to be derived from thence. Lindley lordship is remarkable for this, that therein was never seen adder, snake, or lizard; though in all the neighbouring places they have been commonly found. At Higham a great deal of silver coin of Henry the Third, some gold rings, some links of gold chains, and some silver coins of Trajan, have been found. Many antiquities have been discovered at Leicester; as first, an antient temple supposed to be dedicated to Janus, near which, in a place called Holy Bones, great store of bones have been dug up, which are thought to have been the bones of the victims. 2. A cellar near the elm trees, not far from All Saints church, with several curious figures on it in a sort of Mosaic. 3. Great medals and coins, both in silver and copper, of Vespasian, Domitian, Trajan, Antoninus, and others. 4. An apartment under ground, supposed to have been used as a hot-bath. At Segs-hill or Sex-hill, a small round hill, supposed to have been a Roman tumulus. Seven miles from Leicester six parishes meet, and set the marks of their parish bounds. At Ratcliff is an uncommon tumulus, supposed to be the sepulchral monument of some Danish king. Barrow-hill and Erdburrow, thought to be the antient Vernomitum.</P>

<HEAD>RUTLANDSHIRE. Its BOUNDARIES and EXTENT.</HEAD>
<P>It is almost of a circular form, and is encom∣passed on the east, and south in part, with Lin∣colnshire and Northamptonshire; on the west, and south in part, with Leicestershire; and on the north with part of Lincolnshire and Leicester∣shire. It is the least of all the counties in England, and was once a part of Northamptonshire. When it became a distinct county, does not seem very clear. It is almost fifteen miles long, ten broad, and forty in circumference, containing 110,000 acres, two market-towns, five hundreds, and forty-eight parishes. It sends only two members to parlia∣ment for the shire, is in the diocese of Peterbo∣rough, and gives the title of duke to the family of Manners.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>The air is healthy and pleasant, and the soil very fruitful both in corn and pasture; for though
<PB N="416" REF="4290"/>
there is but one stream, that may be called a river, viz. the Guash or Wash, which runs across it from east to west, yet there are many brooks that supply the county both with fish and water, be∣sides the Welland, which bounds it to the south. The soil, being of a reddish colour, is supposed to give name to the county. It produces plenty of wood, and feeds large herds of cattle and flocks of sheep.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>The most considerable town of the county is Okeham, in the middle of that delicious vale called Catmose, probably from <HI>coet maes,</HI> which in the British signifies, a woody field or ground. The town, no doubt, took its name from the oaks that grew there. Near the church are still to be seen the ruins of a castle, upon the gate of which are nailed a great many horseshoes; for every baron of the realm, the first time he comes through the town, is obliged to give a horse-shoe to be nailed upon the castle gate, and if he re∣fuses, the bailiff of the manor may stop his horses, and take one from them. But it is commonly redeemed with a little money, and in proportion to the gift, a shoe is made larger or smaller with the donor's name and titles on it, and nailed to the gate. Here is a free-school built and endowed in the reign of Charles II. by Mr. Robert John∣son, parson of North-Luffenham, in this county, and a hospital for the maintenance of two chap∣lains, and twelve poor men, in the reign of Richard II. by Mr. William Dalby, of Exton, which is still in being. Here in 1619 was born a dwarf, who when a year old was scarce eighteen inches. Being then in the duke of Bucking∣ham's family, on a progress the court made into those parts, he was served up in a cold pye, and
<PB N="417" REF="4300"/>
thence called the pygmy of the pasty. After∣wards he grew up to three feet nine inches, and in the civil wars was a captain of horse; but going with the queen to France, and killing in a duel on horseback the brother of lord Crofts, he was expelled the court. Upon this he went to sea, and was taken by a Turkish pyrate: after many years slavery, being redeemed, he re∣turned to England, and lived several years upon pensions from the duke of Buckingham and other noblemen, till in 1678, he was taken up for the popish plot, and confined in the Gatehouse; but was at last discharged, and died in 1682. The earl of Winchelsea is patron of the church, and lord of the castle and manor. Here is a market every Saturday, and its fairs are in April and September.</P>
<P>Uppingham is so called from its situation on a rising ground. It is a handsome town, and has a good market for corn and cattle, together with a free-school and hospital, founded by the parson of North Luffenham. The bishop of London is patron of the church, which is a rectory; and the standard of weights and measures for the county, by statute of Henry VII. is kept here.</P>
<P>Lydington: here, about 1602, Thomas lord Burleigh founded an hospital or alms-house for a warden, twelve poor men, and two poor women; and a little after a small one was founded at Morcot in the same hundred.</P>
<P>Market or Marged Overton is supposed to be the Margedunum of Antoninus, both from its situation on a hill, and from the Roman coins and <HI>marga,</HI> i. e. limestone, found there.</P>
<P>Cotsmore: this place is remarkable chiefly for a rent-charge purchased in 1616, by Anne lady Harrington, and issuing out of this manor, to be
<PB N="418" REF="4310"/>
divided quarterly for ever among the poor of seven neighbouring parishes.</P>
<P>Rihal: where, in the popish times, one Tibba was worshipped as a second Diana, and reputed the patroness of falconers.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>In the compass of a few years, says Cambden, upwards of two hundred Roman coins were ga∣thered at Market-Overton, where Margadunum is supposed to have stood; as Gausennae is thought to have been in the same situation as Brigge-Cas∣terton, on the east side of the shire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF SEATS.</HEAD>
<P>There are a great many fine seats in this small county, the chief of which are the earl of Gains∣borough's at Exton; and the earl of Winchel∣sea's at Burley on the Hill, near Okeham. The situation of the latter is admirable, commanding an extensive prospect over the Vale of Catmose. It belonged formerly to lord Harrington, and afterwards to Villiers, duke of Buckingham, who made a fine seat of it; but that was burnt down in the civil wars. The present house, which is a very noble edifice, was built by the late earl of Nottingham. It is adorned with a fine park, five or six miles in circumference, full of woods, game and deer, with delicious gardens, exquisite paintings, a splendid library, &amp;c. so that there are few seats in England superior to it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LINCOLNSHIRE, its BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>It is a maritime county, having the German ocean on the east, Northamptonshire on the south,
<PB N="419" REF="4320"/>
from which it is separated by the river Welland, as it is on the west from Yorkshire, by the Hum∣ber: it has also on the west, part of Nottingham∣shire, Leicestershire, and Rutlandshire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTENT and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>Its greatest length is above sixty miles, and its greatest breadth about forty, making upwards of a hundred and eighty miles in circumference, containing two thousand one hundred and sixty∣two square miles; or, according to others, one million seven hundred and forty thousand acres, thirty hundreds or wapentakes, six hundred and eighty-eight parishes, one city, five parliamentary boroughs, thirty-four other market-towns, and about two hundred and forty-five thousand five hundred and forty inhabitants. The names of the three grand divisions are Holland, Kestevan, and Lindsey; the last of which is by much the largest.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>The soil of Holland being marshy, the air is moist and foggy, and therefore unwholesome. Kes∣tevan has a drier and more fruitful soil, and con∣sequently a better air. Of the third division, Lind∣sey, the air is reckoned good and wholesome.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>There are many large rivers in the county, as the Nen, Welland, Gnash, Witham, Bane, Trent, Dun, and Ankam, all abounding with fish. In the Fens are very rich pastures, so that their cat∣tle are the largest in England, unless, perhaps, we should except those of Somersetshire; and at certain seasons the numbers of fowl are amaz∣ing,
<PB N="420" REF="4330"/>
especially of ducks; so that Cambden says, they could, in his time, about Crowl catch a thou∣sand at once in August with a single net; and they called the pools, where they catched them, their corn fields, no corn then growing within five miles of the place. That of these fowls there were some sorts not only very rare, but extremely delicate, as the puittes, knotts, and goodwitts; so that the nicest palates and richest purses greatly coveted them. The knotts are said to be so called, from their having been first brought from Denmark, for the use of king Canute. The dotterel is so called because it is a very simple bird, and mimicks all the motions of the fowler, till it is easily caught by candle-light. They have all the common fruits, and some of them in greater perfection, than in other parts of England. Their hares and their hounds are said to be exceeding swift. The Fens seem to have been overun with wood anciently, for trunks of trees are still found in them. The churches in Lincolnshire are said to be very fine, but the houses indifferent. There is a homely proverb, which says, that its hogs sh—t soap, and its cows fire, because the poor people wash their clothes with hogs dung, and, from the scarcity of other fuel, burn dried cow-dung. It is intirely in the diocese of Lincoln, and sends twelve members to parlia∣ment, viz. two knights for the shire, two citizens for Lincoln, two burgesses for Boston, two for Great Grimsby, two for Stamford, and two for Grantham.</P>
<P>We shall now proceed to a more particular de∣scription of the three divisions, beginning with Holland.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>HOLLAND.</HEAD>
<P>It so much resembles the province of that name upon the continent, in most respects, being low and marshy with the sea on one side, and canals
<PB N="421" REF="4340"/>
running through it, that it must either have had its name from thence, or at least on the same ac∣count. On the east it has what the ancient geo∣graphers called <HI>Aestuarium Metaris,</HI> now the Washes, which are overflowed at high-water, and part of Cambridgeshire on the south. It is di∣vided into higher and lower; the latter is full of bogs and marshes, and has huge banks to defend it against the sea and the land floods. The whole division seems to have been gained from the sea. The ground is so soft that horses are worked un∣shod, and it produces plenty of grass, but little corn. Though there are no stones to be found in or upon the ground, yet the churches are all of stone. They have no fresh water but from the clouds, which is preserved in pits; but if these are deep, it soon turns brackish, and, if they are shallow, they soon become dry.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Boston, i. e. Botolph's Town, from a Saxon saint of that name, who is said to have been the founder of a monastery here. It stands on the river Witham, which has artificial banks, a wooden bridge, and is navigable to Lincoln. Though in the reign of Ed∣ward the First it was plundered, and a great part of it burnt by a band of robbers, it afterwards re∣covered, became a staple for wool, and traded with the Hanse towns. It has a commodious harbour, and a large beautiful church, the tower of which, being two hundred and eighty two feet in height, serves as a land-mark to seamen, and is seen forty miles round. It has three hundred and sixty-five steps, fifty-two windows, and twelve pillars, answer∣able to the days, weeks, and months of the year, and is reckoned the largest in the universe without cross-ailes. It is governed by a mayor, who is clerk of the market, and admiral over all the
<PB N="422" REF="4350"/>
sea-coasts hereabouts, by grant from queen Eli∣zabeth, a recorder, deputy-recorder, twelve al∣dermen, a town clerk, eighteen common-coun∣cil men, a judge and marshal of the admiralty, a coroner, two serjeants at mace, &amp;c. Here, besides St. Botolph's monastery, were four friaries and three colleges, the revenues of which were given by Henry VIII. to the town. There is a pond in the great common called the West Fen, whence by pipes, and a water house and mill, erected in queen Ann's reign, by act of parlia∣ment, the town is supplied with water. The pas∣tures about the town are very rich, and feed vast numbers of large sheep and oxen. Here the famous Knox, author of the Acts and Monuments, was born. The town gives title of viscount to the earl of Grantham, its markets are on Wed∣nesdays and Saturdays, and has an annual fair called a mart, which lasts nine days.</P>
<P>Crowland, or Croyland, is a noted town among the fenners, and the name is said to signify raw or muddy land. It had antiently a famous mo∣nastery founded by Athelbald, king of Mercia, to the honour of God, and the memory of Guthlac, who had been an hermit in the neighbourhood, and a great exorcist. Here is a curious bridge, scarce to be equalled in Britain, if in Europe, built in a triangular form, at the conflux of the Nyne and Welland, to answer the three streets, of which the town consists, and which are built on piles driven into the ground. Each street is separated from the other by water-courses, planted with willows. Guthlac lies buried in a little stone cottage, called Anchor-Church-House, near the abbey. The inhabitants make great profit of their decoys, in which they catch an infinite num∣ber of ducks. Formerly there were a great many pools about the town, for liberty of fishing in
<PB N="423" REF="4360"/>
which, they paid three hundred pounds, first to the abbot, and afterwards to the crown; but most of these, by means of drains and sluices, are now turned into corn fields. The boggy soil about the town gave rise to this witty proverb, "That all the carts that came to Croyland were shod with silver." The people, at least antiently, went in little boats called sherries to milk their cows, which were kept at some distance from the town.</P>
<P>Spalding is a good town, considering its situa∣tion among lakes, canals, and rivers. It has a bridge over the Welland, and a harbour, to which vessels of fifty or sixty tons come up. It had formerly a monastery, the ruins of which are still visible; and has now a free grammar school for the inhabitants sons. From hence as far as Deep∣ing, which is ten miles off, Egelrick, abbot of Crowland, made a firm causey, through the midst of a vast forest and deep marshes of wood and gravel, which was called, from his name, Elrich road; but of this nothing now remains.</P>
<P>Kirkton, so called from its stately church, in form of a cathedral, gives name to a hundred.</P>
<P>Dunnington is remarkable only for the large quantities of hemp and hemp-seed bought here. It has a harbour for barges.</P>
<P>Tydd, a small village, but famous for having been once the rectory of Nicholas Breakspear, who planted Christianity in Norway, was after∣wards made a cardinal, and in 1154, pope, under the name of Adrian IV.</P>
<P>Sutton St. Mary's, remarkable only for having been the birth-place of the famous Dr. Busby, master of Westminster school.</P>
<P>The family of Rich long enjoyed the titles both of Warwick and Holland; the latter of which is at present possessed by the right honourable Henry Fox, brother to the earl of Ilchester.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="424" REF="4370"/>
<HEAD>KESTEVAN.</HEAD>
<P>The second division is called Kestevan; by Ethelward, an ancient author, Ceostefne-wood, because there was formerly a great forest where are now the large fens called Deeping-Fens, &amp;c. and at this day trunks of trees are often dug up; but it was disforested for ever by Henry III. This division is larger than Holland, and much more populous, as it is equally fruitful, and en∣joys a better air. It is bounded on the south-east by Holland, and on the north by Lindsey, from which it is separated by the river Witham and the Fosse-dyke.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Two of the towns that send members to par∣liament stand in this division, viz. Stamford and Grantham.</P>
<P>Stanford, or Stamford, is so called, because it is built of stone. It is the neatest and best-built town of the county, and finely situated for pleasure and convenience upon the river Welland, which is na∣vigable to it for barges. Here king Edward the El∣der built on the south-bank of the river, over against the town, a strong castle, called now Stanford-ba∣ron; but the castle, which Stephen fortified in the civil war against Henry of Anjou, stood in the town. Stowe tells us, there was a mint in Stanford-baron, in the time of king Athelstan, in 930. In the reign of Edward III. if not before, there was an university here; and there are still the remains of two colleges, the one called Black-Hall, and the other Brazen-Nose, from a great brazen nose with a ring through it upon the gate, like that at Ox∣ford. Here it was that the barons met to levy
<PB N="425" REF="4380"/>
war upon king John, in whose reign William, earl of Warren, lord of the town, having been much diverted with two bulls, who fighting for a cow in the castle meadow and bellowing, brought all the butchers dogs of the place about them, which pursued and baited one of them quite through the town, gave the whole meadow for a common to the butchers, on condition they should provide a bull to be baited in like manner every year, six weeks before Christmas; whence came the proverb, "As mad as the baited bull of Stanford." Within this manor the custom called Burrough-English takes place, which is, that the younger sons inherit what lands and tenements their fathers die possessed of. Here is a free school, and two hospitals, one of which was founded by William Cecil, baron of Burleigh, who lies buried in a splendid tomb in St. Martin's parish church; and in the church adjoining to the bridge is a noble monument of white marble of the late earl and countess of Exeter, done at Rome, when they were there at the last jubilee. The town suffered much in the civil wars betwixt the houses of Lancaster and York; but is now large, rich, and populous, governed by a mayor, recorder, aldermen, and common council. Here are two noted inns, the George and the Bull, of which the former is the largest, and the other one of the finest, in England. Of the eighty charity-children kept by this town, some are wholly maintained and cloathed, and others furnished with wheels, reels, fire, and candle: they are said to earn four hundred pounds a year by their labour. The trade of Stamford is chiefly in malt, sea-coal, and free∣stone. The inhabitants pretend to a great many privileges, as that they cannot be impannelled on juries out of town; that they are not subject to the sheriffs, or lord lieutenants, but that the militia of
<PB N="426" REF="4390"/>
the town is to be commanded by their own officers; that the mayor is the king's lieutenant, to whose command alone he is subject, being the second man in the kingdom within the liberties of the town; that they have the return of all writs, &amp;c. The barons Grey, of Groby, take the title of earls from this place.</P>
<P>Grantham is an ancient town and corporation, governed by an alderman and twelve justices of the peace, a recorder, a coroner, an escheator, twelve second-twelve men, who are of the com∣mon council, and twelve constables to attend the court. Lying on the north road, it is full of inns, populous, well built, and flourishing. It has a large church with a spire two hundred and eighty feet high, which, by a deception of the sight, seems to stand awry; and a good free-school built and endowed by Richard Fox, bishop of Winchester, a native of the town. It was here the great Sir Isaac Newton received his first edu∣cation. It seems to have had a castle anciently, and the ruins of many religious houses are still to be seen. Here is a course for horse-races. It gives the title of earl to the family of Robinson.</P>
<P>Sleaford is the only town of any note in this division besides those already mentioned. To dis∣tinguish it from Old Sleaford in its neighbour∣hood, it is called New Sleaford. The ruins of a castle built by Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, are still to be seen; and it has a free-school and an hospital, both founded and endowed in 1603, by Robert Car, esquire.</P>
<P>In this division is Simpringham, famous here∣tofore for the religious order of Gilbertines, in∣stituted by one Gilbert, lord of the place. He, by authority of pope Eugenius the Third, anno 1148, (contrary to the constitutions of Justinian, which forbad all double monasteries, that is, of
<PB N="427" REF="4400"/>
men and women promiscuously) did introduce an order of men and women; which increased to that degree, that he himself founded thirteen con∣vents of this order, and lived to see in them seven hundred Gilbertine friars, and eleven hundred sisters: but their chastity was not to be boasted of, if we may believe Nigellus, a satyrist of that age.</P>
<P>Blankeny belonged once to the barons of Dein∣courts, an ancient family, of which Edmund was so very earnest to preserve the memory of his name, that having no issue male, he petitioned king Edward II. for liberty to make over his ma∣nors and arms to whomsoever he pleased; for he imagined that both his name and arms would go to the grave with him, and he was very sollicitous to have them survive, and be remembered. Ac∣cordingly the king complied, and he had letters patent for that end: yet this surname, says Camb∣den, is, for aught I can find, quite extinct, and would have been forgotten for ever, if the me∣mory of it had not been preserved in books.</P>
<P>Belvoir-castle. This is a noble seat of the duke of Rutland, so called from its pleasant prospect; for it stands on the brow of a hill, and beneath it lies a delicious vale, called from it the Vale of Belvoir. About the castle are found the stones called astroites, which resemble little stars, mixed one with another, having five rays in every corner, and in the middle of every ray a hollow. It is said, that if this stone is put in vinegar, it will move out of its place, and whirl round.</P>
<P>At Bourne, Walcot by Folkingham, Pick∣worth, Newton, Aunsby, Aserby, and, as is said, in the grounds east of Dunsby-hall, three miles north of Sleaford, are mineral chalybeate waters.</P>
<P>In the church at Sedgbrook, under a marble tomb not much defaced, are the remains of the famous judge Markham, called the upright judge,
<PB N="428" REF="4410"/>
who having been displaced on a very honourable account, retired hither, and built a burying-place, and over it à chamber, where he spent the rest of his life in great piety and devotion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>At Stamford may be seen the Roman highway running northward; and here, as some imagine, stood Gausennae, from which, they suppose, this division of the county was called Kestevan, as Lindsey from Lindum; but others place it at Brigcasterton, a mile farther off. Caresdyke, or Caerdyke, which was a broad, deep, artificial na∣vigable canal, extending formerly from the river Nen, a little below Peterborough, to the river Witham, about three miles below Lincoln, being almost forty miles, is thought by some to have been a Roman work. At Paunton, the Roman <HI>ad Pontem,</HI> on account of the bridge that was over the river there, chequered Roman pavements are often dug up. About Ancaster, the ancient Croco∣calana, are to be seen the vestiges of several Ro∣man camps, and the military way, where coins are often found. This place and Kestevan give the title of duke to the family of Bertie. Near this spot, some imagine the Margidunum of An∣toninus stood, while others place it at Market-Overton in Rutlandshire. Near the little vil∣lage Herlaxton, near Grantham, in Edward the Sixth's time, a brazen vessel was ploughed up, wherein was found an old fashioned gold helmet, studded with jewels, which was presented to Ca∣tharine of Spain, queen to Henry VIII.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LINDSEY.</HEAD>
<P>This is the third and largest division of the county; on the east and north it is washed by
<PB N="429" REF="4420"/>
the sea, into which it runs out with a large front; on the west it has Yorkshire, and Nottingham∣shire, from which it is parted by the rivers Trent and Dun; on the south it has Kestevan, from which it is separated by the river Witham, and the Foss-Dyke, which is seven miles long, and was cut by Henry I. between the Witham and the Trent, for the convenience of carriage in those parts. It had its name from Lincoln, the capital of the county, which stands in it, and by the Romans called <HI>Lindum,</HI> by the Britons <HI>Lyndcoit,</HI> by the Saxons <HI>Lindo-collyne,</HI> probably from its situation on a hill, and the lakes or woods that were an∣ciently thereabouts; but the Normans called it <HI>Nichol.</HI> It gives title of earl and marquis to the duke of Ancaster.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>The city of Lincoln stands on the side of a hill, at the bottom of which runs the river Witham. The old <HI>Lindum</HI> of the Britons, which stood on the top of the hill, as appears from the vestiges of a rampart, and deep ditches still remaining, was taken and demolished by the Saxons, who built a town upon the south side of the hill down to the river side, which was several times taken by the Danes, and as often retaken by the Saxons. In Edward the Confessor's time, it appears, from Doomsday-book, to have been a very considerable place; and in the time of the Normans, Malms∣bury says, it was one of the most populous cities in England. William I. built a castle upon the summit of the hill above the town. The diocese, though the bishopric of Ely was taken out of it by Henry II. and those of Peterborough and Ox∣ford by Henry VIII. is still vastly large, contain∣ing the counties of Leicester, Huntingdon, Bedford, and part of Bucks, making one thousand
<PB N="430" REF="4430"/>
two hundred and fifty-five parishes. Though the other churches are mean, the cathedral, or min∣ster, is a most magnificent piece of Gothic archi∣tecture. Here is a prodigious large bell, called Tom of Lincoln, which is near five ton in weight, and twenty-three feet in compass. The hill on which the church stands is so high, and the church itself so lofty, that it may be seen fifty miles to the north, and thirty to the south. Besides other tombs, it contains one of brass, in which are the entrails of queen Eleanor, wife to Edward I. It is said there were anciently fifty-two churches which are now reduced to thirteen. Such is the magnificence and elevation of the cathedral, that the monks thought the sight of it must be very mortifying to the devil; whence it came to be said of one who was displeased, "that he looked like the devil over Lincoln." There have been several famous bishops of this place, besides Reme∣gius, who removed the see hither from Dorches∣ter in Oxfordshire, purchased the ground where the church stands, built and endowed it; as, for instance, Robert Bloet, on whom William Rufus laid a fine of fifty thousand pounds, alledging that his title to the city of Lincoln was not good; Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, who was distin∣guished for his generosity and magnificence, and to whom the minster is chiefly indebted for its grandeur; for, says William of Malmsbury, "be∣ing looked on as a prodigy for the smallness of his body, he strove to excel in mind, and make the greater figure;" Hugo Burgundus, who being canonized, had his corpse carried to the grave on the shoulders of king John and his nobles, out of respect, as Howden says, to God and the sainted prelate; and, to mention no more, Robert Grotest, i. e. Greathead, who is said to have been, "an awful reprover of the pope, a monitor to the king, a lover of truth, a corrector of pre∣lates,
<PB N="431" REF="4440"/>
a director of priests, an instructor of the clergy, a preacher to the people, a diligent searcher of scripture, and a mallet to the Ro∣manists, &amp;c." The declivity on which the city is built being so steep, the communication betwixt the upper and lower town is very troublesome, and coaches and horses are obliged to make a com∣pass. The little river Witham runs through the town, and on the west side forms a large pool, called from the number of swans upon it, Swan∣pool, which has a communication with the Trent by a canal, called the Foss-dyke. In the upper town many gentlemen, besides the prebendaries and others of the clergy, have handsome houses of modern architecture. There are four charity∣schools, in each of which thirty poor children are taught by clergymen's widows. It is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, who are justices of the peace, two sheriffs, a recorder, four chamberlains, a sword-bearer, four coroners, and above forty com∣mon-council, and has a viscontial jurisdiction twenty miles round, a privilege which no other city in England can boast of. The country round is very fertile and pleasant, and the tract called Lincoln-heath extends above fifty miles. On the down, towards Boston, are sometimes seen those rare birds called bustards. Here are frequent horse races, markets on Tuesday and Friday, fairs first Tuesday in April, June twenty-four, first Friday in September, and November seventeen. It has given the title of earl to the family of Clin∣ton, ever since the reign of queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Other towns and places any ways remarkable in this division are,</P>
<P>Great Grimsby, a parliamentary borough, and the second, if not the first, corporation in the king∣dom. It stands half a mile from the Humber, and was a place of great trade before its harbour was choaked up. What trade it has now is in
<PB N="432" REF="4450"/>
coals and salt brought by the Humber. In the road before it, ships in the Humber wait for a wind, as those from the Thames do in the Downs. It had formerly two monasteries, a nunnery, and castle; and is governed by a mayor, high-steward, recorder, twelve aldermen, of whom the mayor is one, twelve common council-men, two bailiffs, two coroners, a town-clerk, and three serjeants at mace.</P>
<P>Gainsborough, one of the best towns in the county, standing on the Trent, by which ships come up to the town with the tide, though it is forty miles from the Humber. On the north marsh, near the town, is the course for horse races. It has several meeting-houses in it for dissenters, and gives the title of earl to the family of Noel.</P>
<P>Burton, remarkable only for a dangerous ferry over the Humber to Hull in Yorkshire.</P>
<P>Wainfleet, a neat town, and noted for giving birth and surname to William Wainfleet, bishop of Winchester, who founded a free-school in the town, Magdalen-college in Oxford, and was a great patron of learning. His father hath a fair monument of alabaster still remaining in the church.</P>
<P>Louth, a corporation and market-town of good resort, which takes its name from Lud, a rivulet that runs by Cockerington. It has a free-school founded by Edward VI. and a stately church, the steeple of which is one of the highest in England.</P>
<P>Horn-Castle, a large town on the river Bane. This plainly appears to have been a Roman sta∣tion, both from the castle, which is Roman work, and was immensely large, taking up twenty acres, as appears from what remains of it, and also from the Roman coins found here.</P>
<P>Axholm, or Axelholm, is an island formed by the Trent, Dun, and Idle, in length ten miles, but not half so broad. The lower part near
<PB N="433" REF="4460"/>
the rivers is marshy, and produces an odorifer∣ous shrub called gall; the middle has a small ascent, and is rich and fuitful, yielding flax in great abundance, and alabaster; but the latter not being very solid, is fitter for lime and plaister∣work, than other uses. Its name is compound∣ed of Axel, which was formerly the name of the chief town of the island, now Axey, and Holme, which signifies a river island.</P>
<P>Torkesey, now a little mean town, but hereto∣fore more considerable; for the burghers, (as it is in Doomsday-book) enjoyed many privileges, on condition that they should carry the king's ambas∣sadors as often as they came that way, down the river Trent, in their own barges, and conduct them as far as York. Their ancient charter is still preserved, by which they enjoy the privi∣lege of a toll from strangers that bring cattle or goods this way, and a fair on Monday in Whitsun-week, much resorted to.</P>
<P>Skellingthorpe, two miles west of Lincoln. Henry Stone, lord of this place, in 1693, be∣queathed the lordship, worth about five hundred and twenty pounds per annum, to Christ's-hospital in London, and likewise his personal estate, amounting to four thousand pounds.</P>
<P>Trusbutt. Here, in the year 1697, Sir Ed∣mund Turner founded an hospital for clergymen's widows.</P>
<P>Bardney, where was formerly a famous monas∣tery; and here, as Bede writes, king Oswald was interred, and had a banner of gold and purple over his tomb. His hand is said to have remain∣ed uncorrupted for many hundred years, and a very ancient poet has told us:</P>

<P>At Ludford Roman coins are frequently dug up.</P>
<P>Winceby. Here a battle was fought between king Charles I. and the parliament, in which the former was defeated.</P>
<P>Scrivelby. This manor belongs at present to the Dimmocks, and is held by this tenor: "That whensoever any king of England is to be crown∣ed, the lord of the manor for the time being, or some in his name, if he be unable, shall come well armed, upon a good war-horse, into the pre∣sence of our lord the king, on the day of his co∣ronation, and shall cause to be proclaimed, That if any one shall say, that our said lord has not a right to his crown and kingdom, he is ready to defend, with his body, the right of the king and kingdom, and the dignity of his crown, against him and all others whatsoever."</P>
<P>Eresby. Peregrine, a name peculiar to the Bertie family, took its rise from hence: Catharine, baroness Willoughby of Eresby, and dutchess of Suffolk, having borne a son to her husband Richard Bertie, at Wesel in the dutchy of Cleve, when they fled into foreign parts in queen Mary's per∣secution, he was called Peregrine, <HI>eó quod in in terra peregrina pro consolatione exilii sui piis parentibus à Domino donatus sit,</HI> i. e. because in a strange land he was bestowed by God on his pious parents, for their comfort in an exiled state.</P>
<P>Bollingbroke-Castle, famous for the birth of Henry IV. who from it had the name of Henry

<P>Oumby. Here in the fields adjoining to the road between Hull and Stamford, brass and silver coins have been ploughed up, with the figure of Rome on one side, and this inscription, <HI>Urbs Roma;</HI> and on the reverse, <HI>Páx &amp; Tranquillitas.</HI></P>
<P>Stow, commonly supposed the ancient <HI>Sedna∣cester,</HI> where it is believed there was a Roman station, and where was afterwards the see of a bishop, which was removed from thence first to Dorchester in Oxfordshire, and then to Lincoln.</P>
<P>Marton, near Gainsborough. Through the end of this town passes a Roman way, which coming from <HI>Danum</HI> Doncaster to <HI>Agelolum</HI> Littlebo∣rough, goes from thence to <HI>Lindum</HI> Lincoln. About a quarter of a mile from Marton are the remains of a Roman pavement or causey.</P>
<P>Stretton, or Street-Town, in the parish of Stow, so called from the old causey running that way. In a field belonging to that place are a great many ophites, or stones rolled up like ser∣pents.</P>
<P>Thornton. Here was formerly an abbey, or college, the remains of which are still very mag∣nificent.</P>
<P>Yarborough, near Thornton. Near this town are the remains of a great Roman camp, where vast quantities of coins have been found.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="4490"/>
Hunnington, five miles from Grantham. Near this place is a Roman camp, called Julius Caesar's double trench, where many Roman coins have been found, particularly in the year 1691.</P>
<P>Knath, eleven miles from Lincoln. Here Mr. Sutton, the founder of the Charter-house, was born.</P>
<P>On the hills above Ley and Gainsborough, many pieces of Roman urns, and many coins of the emperors have been dug up. The castle∣hill, eastward from Gainsborough, is surrounded with entrenchments, taking up, as is said, more than an hundred acres. It is worth remarking here, that <HI>Bye</HI> in Saxon signifies an habitation; which is the reason that many places all over Eng∣land, and especially in this county, end in Bye.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>In Lincoln are the remains of many religious houses and monasteries, with which the city abound∣ed. The Roman gate, called Newport-gate, is still entire, and a very noble piece of antiquity it is. By this gate is another Roman work, called the Mint∣wall, consisting of alternate layers of brick and stone, sixteen feet high, and above forty long. Besides this, there are other fragments of the wall in many parts of the city. Over-against the castle, to the west, is an entrenchment made by king Stephen. John of Gaunt, duke of Lancas∣ter, lived here like a king, and had a mint; and here his arms are still to be seen carved in stone. Sepulchral monuments of the Normans are often found in this city.</P>
<P>The High-Dyke, called by the country peo∣ple, the High-Street, being cast up to a great height, and about seven yards broad, passes from Stamford to Lincoln; thence northward to a village called the Spittle in the Street; thence
<PB N="437" REF="4500"/>
to Hiberstow; then through Scawby-wood, by Broughton; then through Appleby-lane. At all these places are the remains of Roman buildings and coins; and at Broughton is a petrifying spring, with petrified shells, of which some have fish in them. The way then passes on to the Humber, at no great distance from Roxby and Winterton, Alkborough and Wintringham, where, and at Winterton-cliff, the remains of Roman build∣ings, pavements, and camps are to be seen.</P>

<HEAD>NORFOLK, or NORTH-FOLK. Its BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, CONTENTS, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>Norfolk, so called from its northern situation in respect of Suffolk, is bounded on the east and north by the German ocean; on the south by Suf∣folk, from which it is parted by the rivers Wave∣ney, and the Lesser Ouse; and on the west it is separated from Cambridgeshire, by the Greater Ouse, and from a small part of Lincolnshire by the washes. According to Templeman it extends in length fifty seven miles, in breadth thirty-five, and one hundred and forty in circumference. It contains an area of one thousand four hundred and twenty-six square miles, one city, thirty-two
<PB N="439" REF="4520"/>
market-towns, seven hundred and eleven villages, according to the book of rates; though some make them one thousand five hundred, and two hundred and thirty-six thousand inhabitants, as some have it, and two hundred and eighty-three thousand, according to others. It is divided into thirty-one hundreds, one hundred and sixty-four vicarages, and six hundred and sixty parishes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air differs in different parts of the county, according to the soil, which in some parts is marshy, especially on the sea-coast, and there the air is foggy and unwholesome: in others it is clayey and chalky, poor, lean, and sandy, and there the air is good. The county is almost all champaign, except in some places, where rise gentle hills. The marshlands yield rich pasture for cattle, the clay-grounds peas, rye, and bar∣ley, and the sandy-heaths feed vast flocks of large sheep, of which some villages are said to keep four or five thousand. These heaths abound also in rabbits of a silver grey colour. When a stranger on his coming into the low fenny country is seized with an ague, they say he is arrested by the bailiff of Marshland. Walsingham is noted for producing the best saffron. Great quantities of mackarel and herrings are caught upon the coasts of this county, the former in the spring, and the latter in September; especially at Yarmouth, where they are cured in a particular manner, and to great perfection. Wood and honey are also very plen∣tiful in this shire; and on the coasts jet and ambergrease are sometimes found. The inhabi∣tants are generally strong and active, sagacious and acute. That they are so robust, is the more to be wondered at, because the common people
<PB N="440" REF="4530"/>
live much on puddings, called Norfolk dump∣lings. They are for the most part in easy cir∣cumstances, and were formerly very quarrelsome and litigious. In consequence of this disposition, lawyers swarmed among them to such a degree, that a statute was made so early as the reign of Henry VI. to restrain their number. The manu∣factures of the county, which is exceeding popu∣lous, are chiefly woollen and worsted stuffs, and stockings, for which they are well supplied with wool from the vast flocks of sheep bred in it. It gives title of duke to the elder branch of the family of Howard, lies in the diocese of Nor∣wich, and sends twelve members to parliament, viz. two knights for the shire, two citizens for Norwich, and two burgesses for each of the bo∣roughs of Lynn Regis, Great Yarmouth, Thet∣ford, and Castle-rising; of which we shall speak in their proper place.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>The county is well watered, and supplied with fish by the rivers Yare, Thyrn, Waveney, the Greater and Lesser Ouse, and the Bure, besides rivulets. The Bure abounds in excellent perch, and the Yare has a fish peculiar to it, called the ruffe. The latter rises about the middle of the county, and after being joined by the Waveney and Bure, falls into the sea at Yarmouth. At the equinoxes, especially the autumnal, the Ouse is subject to great inundations, being forced back by the sea that enters it with great fury.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Norwich, a city, and the capital of the county, is supposed to have had its name, which signifies
<PB N="441" REF="4540"/>
a castle to the north, from its situation in re∣spect of Castor, the antient Venta Icenorum, three or four miles to the south of it, out of whose ruins it seems to have risen. In its in∣fancy, in the reign of Etheldred, it was plun∣dered and burnt by Sueno the Dane, when he in∣vaded England with a great army. Afterwards it recovered; and in the reign of Edward the Con∣fessor was a considerable place, having one thou∣sand three hundred and twenty burghers. But it suffered again much in the reign of William I. by being the seat of a civil war, which Ralph, earl of the East Angles, raised against that king. So much was it impaired by the siege it then un∣derwent, that there were scarce five hundred and sixty burghers left in it, as appears from Doomsday∣book. From that time forward it began by little and little to recover, especially after bishop Her∣bert translated the episcopal see hither from Thet∣ford in the reign of William Rufus, anno 1096, and built a beautiful cathedral, of which he himself laid the first stone, with this inscription, <HI>Dominus Herbertus posuit primum lapidem, in Nomine Patris, Filii, &amp; Spiritus Sancti,</HI> Amen. i. e. Lord (bishop) Herbert laid the first stone, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and by a licence from pope Paschal, declared it the mother-church of Norfolk and Suffolk. After this, as Malms∣bury has it, it became a town famous for merchan∣dize and the number of inhabitants. Yet it was miserably harrassed in the reign of Henry II. by Hugh Bigod, earl of Norfolk, who was an ad∣herent of Henry's son, called the junior king. In the time of Edward I. it was walled round by the citizens, who had presented a petition to par∣liament for liberty to do it. Henry IV. allowed them, instead of bailiffs, which they had before, to elect a mayor yearly, and made the city a
<PB N="442" REF="4550"/>
county of itself. In the year 1348, near fifty-eight persons were carried off by the plague, and in 1507 the city was almost consumed by fire. For the flourishing state to which the city is now ar∣rived, they are much indebted to the Flemings, who fled hither from the tyranny of the duke of Alva and the inquisition, and taught them the manufacture of those striped and flowered damasks, camblets, druggets, black and white crape, for which the place is now so noted, and which have been computed to yield sometimes a hundred and sixty thousand pounds a year. In the year 1583, the citizens, by the help of an engine, conveyed water through pipes to the highest parts of the city, which is pleasantly seated along the side of a hill, extending a mile and a half in length from south to north; but the breadth is much less, and it contracts itself by degrees towards the south. It is now one of the most considerable cities in Britain for wealth, populousness, neat buildings, beautiful churches, of which it had once fifty, but now about thirty, and the in∣dustry and civility of the inhabitants. The ca∣thedral is a very venerable structure, with a cu∣rious roof, adorned with the history of the Bible in little images, carved to the life, and a lofty steeple a hundred and five yards high. The wall of flint stone, beautified with forty towers, and twelve gates, finished in 1309, is now much decayed. The city, though there is a great deal of waste ground within the walls, was computed, upwards of thirty years ago, to contain eight thousand houses, and fifty thousand inhabitants. Besides the cathedral already mentioned, the most remarkable buildings are, the duke of Norfolk's house, one of the largest in England; the castle, which is now the county gaol, and stands in the heart of the city, with a deep moat round it,
<PB N="443" REF="4560"/>
over which is a bridge of one very large arch; the Town-hall; the Guild-hall, formerly the church belonging to the monastery of Black-Friars; the house of correction; the shire-house, where the assizes are held; a lofty market cross, built after the manner of a piazza; the bishop's palace; the king's school, founded by Edward VI. the boys to be nominated by the mayor for the time being, with the consent of the majority of aldermen. There having been formerly many thatched houses, an order was made, that all that should hereafter be built, should be covered with tiles. The city is interspersed with gardens, orch∣ards and trees, which make it both pleasant and healthful. It has four hospitals, in which a great number of old men and women, boys and girls, are maintained, and a dozen charity schools. Here are two churches for the Dutch and French Flem∣ings, who have particular privileges, and are very numerous. Some of the churches are thatched, and all of them crusted with flint stone curiously cut, which is the more wonderful, as Norwich stands in a clay country, and has no flint within twenty miles of it. It is now governed by a mayor, recorder, steward, two sheriffs, twenty∣four aldermen, sixty common-council, with a town-clerk, sword-bearer, and other inferior offi∣cers. The mayor is chosen on May-day by the freemen, and sworn in on the Tuesday before Midsummer-eve. The sheriffs are also chosen annually, on the first Tuesday in August, one by the freemen, the other by the aldermen, and sworn in on Michaelmas day. The freemen of the several wards chuse each their alderman. The common council is chosen in Midlent. The mayor is a justice of the peace and quorum, during his year (as are also the recorder and steward) within the city and liberties, and after his mayoralty, he
<PB N="444" REF="4570"/>
is a justice during life. The trade and manu∣factures of the city are very considerable. At Yarmouth they export large quantities of their manufactures, most of which are sent to London, and import a great deal of wine, coal, fish, oil, &amp;c. All the city and country round are employed in the worsted manufacture, brought hither, as already observed, by the Flemings, in which they not only consume the wool of their own county, in spinning, weaving, &amp;c. but use many thousand packs of yarn, which they receive from other parts of England, as far as Yorkshire and West∣morland. There are eight wardens of the weavers chosen annually, and sworn to take care that there be no frauds committed in spin∣ning, weaving, or dying the stuffs. It is com∣puted that there are not less than a hundred and twenty thousand people employed in and about the city in the silk and woollen manufactures. Their markets are thought to be the greatest in England, and furnished with a surprizing plenty and variety of goods and provisions. At a small village to the north of the city called St. Faith's, not less than forty thousand head of Scotch cattle are said to be yearly bought up by the Norfolk graziers, and fattened in their meadows and marshes. Its markets are on Wednesday, Friday, and Sa∣turday. It has a great number of fairs, and gives title of earl to the duke of Norfolk.</P>
<P>Great Yarmouth, so called from its standing at the mouth of the Yare, seems to have risen from the ruins of Gariononum. Here Cerdic the va∣liant Saxon landed, whence the place at this day is called Cerdic Sand, or Cerdic Shore. Not long after, the Saxons, instead of Gariononum, built a town in the moist watery field on the west-side of the river; but afterwards, that proving un∣wholsome, on the east-side, on Cerdic Sand, and called it Yarmouth, where, in the time of Ed∣ward
<PB N="445" REF="4580"/>
the Confessor, were seventy burghers. In the year 1340, the citizens walled it round, and soon grew so rich and powerful, that they had often sea-fights with their neighbours of Leostoff, and the Cinque Ports, on account of their being ex∣cluded the number, and deprived of their pri∣vileges; but afterwards they suffered much by a plague, which in one year carried off seven thou∣sand souls. The town applied itself afterwards to the herring fishery, and by degrees became so considerable, that now it is one of the wealthiest, largest, and most populous towns in England. The roads, as they are so called, to the east of the town, are almost constantly crowded with colliers, and other ships, bound either to the south or north. It is said that here and at the little town of Leostoff, not less than thirty or forty thousand lasts, containing betwixt thirty and forty millions of red herrings, are taken and cured in a year. The season for catching these herrings is about Michaelmas, when there is a fair, at which immense quantities of them are bought and sold, to be consumed at home, or exported to Italy, Spain, Portugal, &amp;c. Besides this trade, they export prodigious quantities of coal, and woollen goods, which employs a considerable number of hands. There is almost as great a fishing for mackarel in the spring, as for herrings in September. They import vast quantities of cod from the North Seas, and all manner of naval stores from Norway and the Baltic, which are mostly con∣sumed in their own port, where a great num∣ber of ships are built every year. Upwards of fifty years ago, more than eleven hundred sail belonged to this town. It can send goods to Nor∣wich, and almost all over the county, and even to Suffolk, by water. Some commissaries from the Cinque Ports, in consequence of an old custom,
<PB N="446" REF="4590"/>
during the herring fair, hold a court together with the magistrates of the town, to determine all controversies, and keep the peace. The mer∣chants and traders are accounted very fair dealers, and the seamen the ablest and most expert of any in England. It is the most regular built town in the kingdom, the streets running parallel with one another, from north to south. It is almost surrounded by the river, the harbour, and the sea, and has besides a wall. Its market-place is the finest, and perhaps best furnished of any in England, and there is not a nobler or more spacious key in Europe, if we except that of Seville in Spain. It has two parish churches: the steeple of St. Nicholas is so high that it serves for a sea-mark. Over the river is a draw∣bridge. It costs the inhabitants two or three thousand pounds a year to keep the harbour clear of mud and sand. The town-house and custom∣house are also fine buildings. There are two charity schools, in one of which the boys are taught, besides reading and writing, to make nets: there is also a fine hospital. The har∣bour is defended by a platform with guns upon a little slip of land at the entrance of it. In the neighbourhood of this town are banks of sand, which are shifted by the winds, and on which ships are often cast away. The coast is ex∣tremely dangerous and fatal to seamen; and so many ships have been wrecked upon it, notwith∣standing the many light-houses that are kept flaming all night, and the beacons and sea marks all along from hence to Cromer, that all the sheds, outhouses, pales, &amp;c. are made of wrecks, besides great piles of them laid up for the purposes of building. The danger is if a ship coming from the north is taken with a hard gale of wind at south-east, or any point between north-east and
<PB N="447" REF="4600"/>
south-east, and cannot weather Winterton Ness, they are then kept within the great bay of Cro∣mer, lying between Winterton and the Spurn∣head in Yorkshire, called by the seamen the devil's throat, and unless they can ride it out, or get to Lynn or Boston, at the bottom of the bay, which is a desperate push, they must certainly be cast away, either upon the rocks about Cromer, or the flat shore between Cromer and Wells. In like manner ships bound to the north, if they are caught by a north-east wind, and embayed, are in the utmost danger of perishing. In the year 1696, two hundred sail of colliers, and other ships, not being able to weather Winterton Ness, and running away for Lynn deeps, missed their way in the dark, and perished with all on board, to the number of about a thousand persons. By virtue of a charter from Henry III. the town is governed by two bailiffs and a recorder, who are justices of the peace, aldermen, and common-council. By a charter of Henry III. the town is obliged to send an hundred herrings, baked in twenty-four pasties, every year to the sheriff of Norwich, by whom they are to be de∣livered to the lord of the manor of East Carleton in this county, and by him conveyed to the king. It has a market on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and besides others has a fishing fair, that con∣tinues all the month of October.</P>
<P>Lynn, or Lynn Regis, is an ancient town at the mouth of the Ouse. It was formerly called Bishops Lynn; because, till Henry the Eighth's time, it belonged to the bishops of Norwich; but coming then into the king's hands, it took the name of Lynn Regis, to distinguish it from Old Lynn. The origin of the name Lynn is uncertain. It is a large well-built town, and was formerly very strong, as appears by the remains of the old for∣tifications.
<PB N="448" REF="4610"/>
It has a good harbour, though of difficult access, by reason of the flats and shoals that lie in the way: but the shoals have all buoys, and there are many good pilots. For the defence of the town and harbour, there is a platform at the north end, mounting twelve guns. The river here is very broad, and the tide rises twenty foot perpendicular. It has two churches, the spires of which were blown down in 1741; but they have been since rebuilt, towards which, and other damages, his late majesty gave a thousand and the earl of Orford five hundred pounds. It has also a chapel of ease, a presbyterian and quakers meeting-house, a workhouse, several hospitals and alms-houses, a free-school, a good custom-house, quay, and warehouses, besides a stately town-house, called Trinity-hall, and an handsome exchange, the latter of which was built at the expence of Sir John Turner. St. Nicho∣las-chapel is a very ancient and a very noble fa∣bric, and the Gray-friars steeple a noted sea∣mark. At St. Nicholas's-chapel is a library erected by subscription, and there is another at St. Margaret's. The market-place is very spaci∣ous, and the market-house is a handsome build∣ing, seventy feet high, and decorated with statues and other embellishments. The trade of the town is very considerable, especially in coals and wine, with which they supply several of the neigh∣bouring counties, by means of the river Ouse, and bring back vast quantities of corn for expor∣tation. Their correspondence and trade to Hol∣land, Norway, the Baltic, Spain, and Portugal, is said to be very great. As to the government of the town, it had a provost and great privileges granted it by king John, for taking part with him against the barons, from whom it had also a large silver cup with a cover, of about eighty
<PB N="449" REF="4620"/>
ounces doubly gilt and enamelled, together with four large silver maces, which are borne before the mayor. But the sword, which is also borne before the mayor, is said to have been received from Henry VIII. It has had no fewer than fif∣teen royal charters, and is at present governed by a mayor, high-steward, under-steward, re∣corder, twelve aldermen, and eighteen common∣council-men. It gives title of baron to lord vis∣count Townshend.</P>
<P>Opposite to Lynn lies Marshland, a low marshy tract, almost surrounded with rivers, and an arm of the sea, and full of drains and ditches. It contains about thirty thousand acres, in a part of which called Tilney Smeath, the soil being very rich, and fitter for grass than corn, are fed upwards of thirty thousand sheep, besides black cattle. It is now fenced by a strong wall against the inun∣dations to which it was formerly fequently ex∣posed, both from the sea and rivers, and yields plenty of corn as well as grass. In this neigh∣bourhood is Walpole, from which the ancestors of the Walpole family took their name. It sig∣nifies, according to Dr. Gibson, a pool near the wall or rampire.</P>
<P>Thetford, situated at the conflux of the Thet, and the lesser Ouse, in a low ground, was an∣tiently called Sitomagus, i. e. according to Camb∣den, a city upon the Sit, the old name of the Thet, and was formerly famous for being a seat of the kings of the East Angles. In 1004 it was burnt by Sueno the Dane, and six years after plundered by the Danes. But it recovered, upon the epis∣copal see being removed hither from Elmham, by Arfastus, whose successor William spared nei∣ther pains nor cost in beautifying it; so that, under Edward the Confessor, it had nine hundred
<PB N="450" REF="4630"/>
and forty-seven burgesses. It was very consider∣able in William the Conqueror's time, and its chief magistrate was stiled consul; but it fell to decay, after the see was translated to Norwich by Herbert, surnamed Losenga. It had antiently three monasteries, particularly one of the Cluniacks, and near the town is a huge mount, cast up to a great height, antiently fortified with walls and a double rampart. Near this town, as we are told, a bloody battle was fought by the holy king Ed∣mund with the Danes. In the reign of James I. an hospital, grammar-school, and maintenance of a preacher for ever, was founded here by Sir Ri∣chard Fulmarston, knight; and, in the time of Charles II. Sir Joseph Williamson, secretary of state, was a great benefactor to this place. It is a pretty large town, with three churches, though but thinly peopled. By a charter from queen Elizabeth, it is governed by a mayor, recorder, ten aldermen, twenty common-council, a town-clerk, sword∣bearer, and mace-bearer. Here the Lent assizes are usually held; and its chief manufacture is woollen cloth.</P>
<P>Castle Rising, so called from a castle and its situ∣ation on a hill. It was a considerable place, till its harbour was choaked up with sand, but now there are scarce ten families in it; yet it is governed by a mayor, chosen by the burgage-holders, and sworn at the court of the lord of the manor, al∣dermen, &amp;c. Here was formerly a castle, forti∣fied with a vast circular ditch; and at present there is a chace, with the privileges of a forest belong∣ing to it; an hospital, founded by Henry Howard, son of the earl of Surry, baron Howard of Castle Rising; and an alms-house by the duke of Norfolk, to whom it now gives the title of baron.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county is allowed to be as plea∣sant, sweet, and wholesome, as that of any other in England, there being nothing either in the soil or situation to render it otherwise. The soil throughout is excellent, and inferior to none, either for grain, fruit, or pasture, supplying the inhabitants plentifully with all the necessaries of life: but that by which it is distinguished from most others, is its fruit, especially apples, of which it produces such quantities, that the cyder made of them is not only sufficient for their own consumption, tho' it is their ordinary drink, but also in a great measure for that of London and other parts. That in particular which is made from the apple called redstreak, is much admired, and has a body almost equal to that of white wine. Lemster, in this county, is noted for the fineness both of its wool and bread. Neither is it ill sup∣plied with wood and water; for besides lesser streams there are the rivers Frome, Loden, Lug, Wye, Wadel, Arrow, Dare, and Monow; the last of which is large, and all of them are well stored with fish, particularly the Wye, which breeds salmon. It lies in the diocese of Hereford, and Oxford circuit.</P>

<P>Hereford, which in Saxon signifies the ford of the army, is supposed to have risen out of the ruins
<PB N="457" REF="4700"/>
of Kenchester, in its neighbourhood, which Camb∣den believes to have been the Ariconium of Anto∣ninus. It is very pleasantly situated among mea∣dows and corn-fields, and is almost encompassed with rivers. It seems to have owed its rise, or at least its increase, to the building and dedicating a church there to Ethelbert, king of the East An∣gles, who was murdered in the neighbourhood, and afterwards taken into the catalogue of martyrs: soon after it became a bishop's see, and in conse∣quence of that a considerable place. In 1055 it was sacked, the cathedral destroyed, and its bishop Leofgar carried away captive, by Gryffin, prince of South Wales, and Algar, an Englishman, who had rebelled against Edward the Confessor. Ha∣rold fortified it with a broad and high rampart; and it appears by Doomsday-book, that there were no more than three hundred men within and with∣out the wall. A very large and strong castle was built by the Normans along the Wye, and the city walled round. The present stately cathedral was founded in the reign of Henry I. by bishop Reinelm, but enlarged and beautified by his suc∣cessors. It suffered much in the barons wars; and was often taken and retaken in the war between king Charles I. and the parliament. This city is pretty large, and had once six churches; but two were destroyed in the civil wars. It is not very populous, nor well built, many of the houses be∣ing old. Its manufactures are gloves and other leathern goods; and its corporation consists of a mayor, six aldermen, a high steward, deputy steward, and town-clerk, who have a sword-bearer, and four serjeants at mace. Each of the compa∣nies enjoys distinct laws and privileges by their charter, and each has its hall. The clergy belong∣ing to the cathedral are, besides the bishop, a chan∣cellor,
<PB N="458" REF="4710"/>
sixteen canons, twenty-seven prebendaries, a chanter, a treasurer, twelve vicars choral, with deacons, and choiristers. The city gave long the title of earl to the noble family of the Bohuns; then of duke to Henry of Lancaster, afterwards Henry IV. king of England; after him, of earl to Stafford, earl of Buckingham; then of viscount to D'Evereux, earl of Essex, which a collateral branch of his family still enjoys, and is thereby the premier viscount of England.</P>
<P>Leominster, or Lemster, is so called, as it is thought by some, from the British <HI>Lhan-Lieni,</HI> signifying a church of nuns; for here Merewalch, a Mercian king, founded a church for nuns. Others derive it from linum, flax, which grows here re∣markably good. On a hill side, near the town, the aforesaid Merwald, or Merewalch, is said to have had a castle or palace: but, as we observed before, Leominster is now most noted for its wool and bread. It is a large populous borough, and a great thoroughfare. Its trade in hats, wool, leather, and wheat, is very considerable, and its fairs are noted for horses and black cattle. Lem∣ster ore was the name given to its wool once, so much wealth did it bring the town. It has now a stately church, and had formerly a priory. Over the Lug there are several bridges. It is go∣verned by a high steward, bailiff, recorder, twelve capital burgesses, and a town-clerk, and gives title of baron to the earl of Pomfret.</P>

<P>This being an inland county, well cultivated, and free from lakes, marshes, or stagnant waters, the air is very sweet and wholesome all over it. The soil in general is very rich, producing corn, fruit, especially pears, of which they make a great deal of perry, hops, and pasture. The hills are covered with sheep, and the meadows with cattle. Hence they have wool, cloth, stuffs, butter, and cheese in abundance. They are also well supplied with fuel, either wood or coal, and salt from their brine pits and salt springs. Of the last they have not only enough for themselves, but export large quantities by the Severn, which noble river, to the great convenience and emolument of the in∣habitants, runs from north to south thro' the very middle of the county, enriching the soil, and yielding it plenty of fish, and an easy expedi∣tious conveyance of goods to and from it. The other rivers by which it is watered are the Stour, Avon, Teme, &amp;c. It sends nine members to par∣liament, viz. two for the county, two for the city of Worcester, two for Droitwich, two for Eve∣sham, and one for Bewdley; and lies in the diocese of Worcester, and Oxford circuit.</P>

<P>Worcester, the etymology of which is un∣certain, called in Latin Wigornia, stands up∣on the Severn, but is situated so low, that it can hardly be seen, till one is close upon it. It is supposed to be the Branonium of Antoninus, the Branogenium of Ptolemy, and to have been built by the Romans to awe the Britons on the
<PB N="462" REF="4750"/>
other side of the Severn. It was made an episco∣pal see about the year 680 by Sexulphus, bishop of the Mercians; but the present cathedral was begun by Wulston, in the year 1084. The town hath been several times burnt down: first, in 1041, by Hardicanute, who also massacred the citizens; secondly, not long after William Rufus's time; and a third time, when king Stephen besieged and took it. Here, in later times, was fought that battle, in which Charles II. with his Scotch army, was defeated by Cromwell. In a garden; near the south gate of the city, where the action was hottest, the bones of the slain are often dug up. It had formerly strong walls, and a castle; but these have been demolished long ago. It is now a large city, the streets broad and well paved; and some of them very regular and well built, par∣ticularly Foregate-street; so that, in general, it is a very agreeable place. The cathedral is a stately edifice, and among other monuments in it, are those of king John, of Arthur, elder brother to Henry VIII. and of the countess of Salisbury, who gave occasion to the institution of the order of the Garter. There are seven or eight hospitals in and about the city, of which that built and en∣dowed by Robert Berkley, of Spetchley, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> is a very noble one. There is a school founded by Henry VIII. three other schools, and six charity schools. The Guildhall, and the workhouse, are stately structures. The churches, St. Nicholas and All-Saints, have been lately rebuilt, and are very handsome edifices. The city carries on a great trade, for which it is chiefly indebted to its situation up∣on the Severn. A prodigious number of people are employed in and about it, in the manufacture of broad cloth and gloves. The Welch inhabit a part of it, and speak their own language. Its
<PB N="463" REF="4760"/>
market is well supplied with provisions, corn, and cattle, and its key is much frequented by ships. By a charter from James I. it is governed by a mayor, six aldermen, who are justices of the peace, and chosen out of twenty-four capital citizens, a sheriff, the city being a county of itself, a com∣mon council, consisting of forty-eight other citi∣zens, out of which two chamberlains are yearly chosen, a recorder, town clerk, two coroners, a sword-bearer, thirteen constables, and four ser∣jeants at mace. Of the bishops of this see, there have been, it is said, one pope, four saints, seven lord high-chancellors, eleven archbishops, two lord treasurers, one chancellor to the queen, one lord president of Wales, and one vice-president. The city, at present, gives title of earl and mar∣quis to the duke of Beaufort.</P>
<P>Droitwich, upon the river Salwarp, is remarka∣ble for its salt springs and brine pits, though it is at a great distance from the sea, and has a river of fresh water running by it. Of the water of these springs is made the purest and whitest kind of salt in little houses built about them. The quan∣tity may be judged of by the taxes paid from thence to the crown, amounting to above fifty thou∣sand pounds a year, at the rate of three shillings and six pence a bushel. They formerly made use of wood in these salt-works; but that not being equal to so great and constant a consumption, they now burn coal, and not wood, in their boiling-houses. That they were known and used before the Con∣quest appears from Doomsday-book, in which is the following passage: "In which there be eight fats of salt belonging to the king and the earl, which, in every week of wealling, yield on the Friday sixteen bullings." The town, consisting of four hundred houses, and four churches, is a
<PB N="464" REF="4770"/>
corporate bailiwic, and much enriched by its salt-works. The salt that is boiled out of these pits is accounted the best inland salt of England, and perhaps as good as any in the world. The proprietors of the salt pits are a corporation, and none can be a burgess of Droitwich, or vote for members of parliament, unless he has some pro∣perty in the springs. The town has had charters from several kings; the first it had from king John, which is still extant, and the last from James the First. It is governed by a bailiff and burgesses.</P>

At the request of prince Henry, James the First granted them a new charter, by which the corpo∣ration consists of a mayor, seven aldermen, twelve ca∣pital burgesses, a recorder, and chamberlain, who are all of the common-council, besides twenty-four other burgesses, called assistants, with jurisdiction over the neighbouring parish of Bengworth, and other privileges, particularly a power to try and exe∣cute felons within the borough. Here was formerly a castle; and now there are two parish churches, a handsome stone bridge over the Avon, with a har∣bour for barges, a grammar school, and two charity-schools, for maintaining of which, Mr. Deacle, a woollen-draper in London, left three thousand pounds. From this town, that rich va∣ley which runs along the banks of the Avon, to Stratford, takes its name. In the reign of king William, it had the honour to give the title of ba∣ron to the great lord chancellor Somers. Here prince Edward, afterwards king Edward the First,
<PB N="465" REF="4780"/>
entirely defeated Simon Montfort, earl of Lei∣cester, set his father and uncle at liberty, and broke the power of the barons by the death of Montfort, who fell at the beginning of the en∣gagement.</P>
<P>Bewdley, Beawley, or Beaulieu, upon the bank of the Severn, is so named from its pleasant situ∣ation upon the declivity of a hill, overlooking the river, and commanding a fine prospect of the country, and formerly of the forest of Wyre, re∣markable for its tall stately oaks and other trees, which have been since either blown or cut down. It sent burgesses to parliament very early, and had charters and great privileges from Edward the Fourth and Henry the Seventh, which were confirmed with the addition of others, by Henry VIII. in whose reign it was annexed to the county of Worcester. King James the First granted it a charter, of which a surrender was procured in Charles the Second's reign, and the corporation was new modelled. King James the Second com∣pelled it to accept of a new charter; but the former surrender, upon a trial, was held void, and a new charter was obtained of queen Anne; in consequence of which it is governed by a bailiff and burgesses, recorder, steward, town-clerk, &amp;c. It carries on a considerable trade, by means of the Severn, in salt, glass, iron ware, and Man∣chester goods; but its chief manufacture is caps, commonly called Monmouth caps. It has a good market for corn, malt, leather, and hops.</P>
<P>Stourbridge, or Sturbridge, so named from the river Stour, on which it stands, is a well built market town, noted for its glass manufacture, and for the clay of which crucibles is made, and the stone pots in which glass-makers melt their metal.
<PB N="466" REF="4790"/>
King Edward VI. founded and liberally endowed a grammar school here; and a noble hospital hath since been founded and endowed by Thomas Foley, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> at Swinford, near this place, in which sixty poor children are to be maintained and instructed in grammar, writing, arithmetic, &amp;c. to fit them for trade. Here is also a manufacture of frieze∣cloth, that succeeds very well.</P>
<P>Kidderminster is a neat town, standing also up∣on the Stour, over against Stourbridge, of which the Bissets, great men in their time, were antient∣ly lords. It is governed by a bailiff, who is a justice of the peace, twelve capital burgesses, twenty-five common-council men, and other in∣ferior officers. Here is a considerable manufac∣ture of cloth, and linsey-woolseys; and Baxter, the famous divine, in Charles II. time, was minister of this town. It has a handsome church, free-school, and town-hall, and antiently sent members to par∣liament.</P>
<P>Pershore, so named from the pear-trees with which the neighbouring country abounds, is a large antient town, has a manufacture of stock∣ings, and is a considerable thoroughfare. A monastery was built here in the time of king Edgar.</P>

<HEAD>WARWICKSHIRE. BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>Warwickshire is bounded on the east by North∣amptonshire, Leicestershire, and the military way called Watling-street; on the south by Ox∣fordshire and Gloucestershire; on the west, for the greatest part, by Worcestershire; and on the north-west by Staffordshire. From north to south it is near forty miles in length, about thirty in breadth from east to west, and about one hundred and thirty in circumference; in which space it con∣tains six hundred and seventy thousand acres, five hundreds, one hundred and fifty-eight parishes, seventeen market towns, and one hundred and fifty-five thousand inhabitants. It is partly in the diocese of Worcester, and partly in that of Litch∣field and Coventry, and sends eight members to parliament, two for the county, and two for each of the following towns, Coventry, Warwick, and Tamworth. The last, tho' a part of it is in Staf∣fordshire, we shall describe in this.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR and SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>This county being divided into two parts, called the Felden and Woodland, the latter was former∣ly over-run with wood, and consequently un∣healthy; but the wood having been since almost all cut down for the iron works in the neighbour∣ing counties, both parts are now equally healthy. In former times the Felden was mostly corn land, with very little pasture; but now the case is much altered, for the greater part of the Woodland now
<PB N="469" REF="4820"/>
produces corn, and the Felden pasture. The air of both is exceeding good, and the soil rich; that of the Woodland having been greatly im∣proved by marle and other manure. As it is, more∣over, an inland county, and at a great distance from the sea, well cultivated, and well watered by a great many brooks and rivers, the air can∣not possibly be bad. The commodities and pro∣duce of the county are chiefly corn, malt, wood, wool, iron, coal, and excellent cheese.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>Its chief rivers are the Avon and the Tame, into both of which a great many lesser streams fal∣ling, serve at the same time to embellish the coun∣ty, and fertilize the soil. Into the Avon, on the south side, fall the Leam, the Jeken, and the Stour; and on the north, the Swift, the Sher∣burn, the Holbroke, the Arrow, and Aln. Se∣veral smaller currents also lose themselves in the Tame, of which the most considerable are the Anker and the Blythe. Besides rivers, this county has salt springs and mineral waters.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>In our description of the towns we shall begin with Coventry, as it is a city, and, together with Litchfield, the see of a bishop, denominated of Litchfield and Coventry.</P>
<P>Coventry is an antient place, and is supposed to derive its name from a convent, formerly situ∣ated here. Hither Robert de Limsey, bishop of Litchfield and Chester, removed his see, tempted, as it is said, by the wealth of the convent: how∣ever, the see returned, in a short time, to Litch∣field
<PB N="470" REF="4830"/>
again, with this condition however, that the bishop should be stiled of Litchfield and Coventry. Leofric, earl of Mercia, who rebuilt the religious house after it had been destroyed by the Danes, and was lord of the place about the year 1040, is said, upon some provocation from the citizens, to have loaded them with heavy taxes. Being impor∣tuned by his lady Godiva to remit them, he con∣sented, upon condition that she would ride naked thro' the town, which he little imagined she would ever consent to: but he found himself mistaken, for she accepted the offer, and rode thro' the town, with her long hair scattered all over her body, having first enjoined the citizens not to venture, upon pain of death, to look out while she passed. It is said, however, that a certain taylor could not help peeping, and to this day there is an effigy of him at the window whence he looked. To commemorate this extraordinary transaction, and out of respect to the memory of their patroness, the citizens make a procession every year with the figure of a naked woman on horseback. After Leofric's death, the earls of Chester became lords of the city, and granted it many privileges. At length it was annexed to the earldom of Cornwall, and growing considera∣ble, had divers immunities and privileges conferred upon it by several kings, particularly that of a mayor and two bailiffs by Edward III. and Henry VI. made it, in conjunction with some other towns and villages, a distinct county, independent of the county of Warwick; but afterwards Edward IV. for their disloyalty, deprived them of their liberties, which were not restored, until they had paid a fine of five hundred marks. By a charter from James I. an alderman is allotted to each ward, with the powers of justices of the peace
<PB N="471" REF="4840"/>
within the city and its liberties. The walls were ordered to be demolished at the restoration, and now nothing remains of them but the gates, which are very lofty. It is noted for two parlia∣ments held in it, the one called the parliament of Dunces, and the other of Devils; the former in the reign of Henry IV. and the other in that of Henry VI. It was on account of the exclusion of the lawyers that the former was denominated of the Dunces; and the attainders of the duke of York, and the earls of Salisbury, Warwick, and March, procured the other the epithet of Devils. By a legacy of Sir William Hollis, lord mayor of London, in the reign of Henry VIII. a stately cross was erected in the market-place, and adorn∣ed with the statues of most of the kings of Eng∣land. The churches of St. Michael and Trinity are magnificent antient structures: the former, in particular, has a very lofty spire, all of stone, and said to have been twenty years and more in build∣ing. The town-house is much admired for its painted windows, representing several kings, and others, that have been benefectors to the city. It has besides the magistrates already mentioned, a recorder, steward, coroner, two chamberlains, and two wardens. The chief manufactures of the city are tammies and ribbands. It reaped great benefit formerly from being the only market town of the county. It has a free school, with a library, and an hospital well endowed. The titles of vis∣count Deerhurst, and earl of Coventry, were con∣ferred by king William III. on Thomas, lord Co∣ventry, of Allesborough, in whose family they still continue.</P>
<P>Warwick. From this town the county derives its name; it is very antient, and supposed by
<PB N="472" REF="4850"/>
Cambden to be the place called by the Romans Praesidium, where the Dalmatian horse were posted It stands on a rock of free-stone, of which all the public edifices in the town are built. At the Norman invasion it was a considerable place; and had many burgesses, of whom twelve were obliged by their tenure to accompany the king in his wars. The castle was antiently very strong, both by nature and art, and is now a most noble and delightful dwelling; the rock on which it stands being forty feet above the river, but, on the north side, level with the town. In Septem∣ber 1694, the city suffered much by a fire, occa∣sioned by a spark blown from a stick, as it was carrying cross a lane; but by an act of parliament for rebuilding it, and the liberal contributions of the nation, it hath risen again out of its ashes more magnificent than it was before. It is supplied with water brought in pipes from springs half a mile from the town, besides what it derives from the wells within it made in the rock; and it is easily kept clean, by being situated upon a declivity. Four streets, from the four cardinal points of the compass, meet in the centre of the town. The country all around is very beautiful, of which, from a terrace in the castle, now the seat of earl Brook and Warwick, there is a very noble prospect. The principal public buildings are St. Mary's, a very stately edifice, an hospital, a town-house of free-stone, three charity schools, and a noble bridge over the Avon. It has had several charters; but is governed at present by a mayor, twelve brethren, twenty-four burgesses, &amp;c. It is a very handsome populous town, and gives title of earl to the family of the Grevilles.</P>
<P>Tamworth, as we observed before, is part in
<PB N="473" REF="4860"/>
this county, and part in Staffordshire, being di∣vided by the river Tame. It was antiently the seat of the Mercian kings, and was afterwards de∣stroyed by the Danes, but rebuilt by queen Ethel∣fleda. It had antiently a castle, now the seat of earl Ferrers. It is noted for its ale, and has a manufacture of narrow cloth, besides some others. There is a church on the Staffordshire side of the river, which is a large building, and a free school founded by queen Elizabeth. Mr. Guy, the fa∣mous bookseller, among his other charities, left one to this town. It is governed by a bailiff, a high-steward, an under-steward, recorder, and other officers.</P>
<P>Birmingham, noted for its hard wares, is a large populous town, and stands partly on the side of a hill, and partly at the bottom. The manufacture of hard wares is the only business of the place, and employs a great number of hands. These wares they have brought to such perfection, by their application and ingenuity, that they are in great request both at home and abroad. In consequence of these manufactures, the town is in a very flourishing condition, and both its public and private buildings increase very fast.</P>
<P>Aulcester is a very antient town. A great many Roman coins have been found here; particularly, not many years since, in digging the foundation of a cellar, an urn full of gold and silver Roman coins was discovered, which was claimed by earl Brook, as lord of the manor. On this account, and from the Roman way, called Ickenild-street, passing thro' it, it is supposed to have been a Ro∣man station. After the conquest, there was a royal mansion here, in which some of our kings have resided.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="4870"/>
Stratford is a handsome town and corporation, governed by a mayor, recorder, high-steward, and twelve aldermen, of whom two are justices, and twelve capital burgesses. Here is a fine bridge over the Avon, built by Hugh Clopton, some∣time lord mayor of London, and a grammar school and alms-house endowed by Edward VI. with lands formerly belonging to the fraternity of the holy cross. In the north isle of Trinity church, all that was mortal of that great dramatic poet, Shakespeare, was interred, in the year 1564. By the river Avon, the city of Bristol carries on a very lucrative trade with this town and county, bringing great quantities of goods of several sorts into it, and carrying back a vast deal of corn and cheese.</P>
<P>Kyneton has a noted market for black cattle; and here king John is said to have kept his court some time.</P>
<P>Edge Hill is famous for the battle fought there between king Charles I. and the parliament, Sep∣tember 9, 1642. Near it is a valley called the vale of Red-horse, from the colour of the soil, and the figure of a horse cut out of the side of the hill by the country people, which some freeholders in the neighbourhood are obliged, by their tenure, to keep up.</P>
<P>Nuneaton is a pretty good town. It was at first called Eaton, that is, a town upon a river, for it stands upon the river Anker, and afterwards Nuneaton, from a nunnery founded in it by Robert Bossu, earl of Leicester. There is a free school in it, and a manufacture of woollen cloth.</P>
<P>Atherton on the Stour is a considerable town, and had formerly a monastery, but now is best

<P>Leamington has it name from the little river Leame that runs by it. Here is a salt spring, which is used by the poor for seasoning their bread.</P>
<P>At Newenham Regis, near the river Swift, are three springs, which have the taste and colour of milk. They are reckoned good for the stone, be∣ing exceeding diuretic, and for closing and heal∣ing green wounds.</P>
<P>Guy's-cliff, near Warwick, is the place where, as fame tells us, Guy of Warwick, the celebrated hero, after he had finished his martial atchievements, lead a hermit's life, and was at last buried: but others, with more probability, think that it took its name from Guy de Beauchamp, who lived much later.</P>
<P>Barford, near Warwick. Here one Samuel Fairfax, born in 1647, is said to have lived in the same house with his father and mother, grand∣father and grandmother, great grandfather and great grandmother; and none of the three generations of either sex had been twice mar∣ried.</P>
<P>Kenelworth was antiently a very strong, large, and beautiful castle, in the centre of the county. Balls

Queen Elizabeth gave it to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, who laid out sixty thousand pounds in embellishing it, and entertained the queen, and her whole court, seventeen days in it.</P>
