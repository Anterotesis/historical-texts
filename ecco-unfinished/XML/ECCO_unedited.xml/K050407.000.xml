<HEAD>Some National Grievances re∣presented, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S Gentlemen in such high Stations as yours, cannot possibly be ac∣quainted with the Complaints and Grumblings of those of the lower Forms of Life, but by the Information of others; and least you should not be sensible of the present Com∣plaints
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
of the Nation, and that you may be left without Excuse, if all our reasonable Grievances are not redress'd, I have taken upon me, in this publick and plain Manner, to make them known to you. I shall pretend to no Rhetorical Flourishes, nor Sophistry, but shall set down, as near as possible, the very Words of the Complainants: It may be asked why these Mat∣ters should be directed to you, more than to any other great Man: I shall answer, that as you are the Person most rail'd at, and abused by the Grumbleto∣nians at the present Administra∣tion; so they and all others look upon you, as most capable to get them Redress: Now, as to my own Part, I have no End
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
in writing this, but that of all <HI>Authors,</HI> (viz.) the Good of my Country; therefore since what I do, is to so good an End only, and not at all with any evil De∣sign, either to reflect on the pre∣sent Ministry, or sow Sedition amongst His Majesties Subjects, nor any Personal Interest: I do lay down as a Preliminary Ar∣ticle, that you shall not let me suffer any Tribulation, nor be confin'd from wholsome Air, for any Thing I shall mention in this my plain Way: This being agreed upon, I shall begin with the first and greatest Grievance, and in which, most Men think themselves aggrieved, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the unequal Distribution of Court Places: You cannot imagine, Sir, how many Men of great Merit are grumbling up and down this
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
great City, to see so many pre∣ferr'd, and themselves neglected; some that have always voted for the Whigs, others that have al∣ways baul'd, and been noisy for them, and others that have si∣lently wished them Success: These all now make loud Pre∣tences, but above all, there are several Gentlemen of the Quill, that call themselves Authors, and with whose Case I am more particularly affected, that find themselves wholly neglected, and who you ought of all others to provide for, least they should turn the bitter Edge of their Tools against you, and the rest of the Ministry, and then alas for you! take what follows. There's Mr. <HI>John Dunton</HI> has be∣gun to thunder against you al∣ready, every Body knows, how
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
serviceable he was to the Nation, in blowing up and discovering the wicked and villainous Designs of the late Ministry, which he found out within six Months after every Body besides knew them: He had certainly been pu∣nished by that Ministry, had he not been allowed of all Hands to be mad, tho' it is really hard he is not provided for; but I will not blame you, because I am not sure <HI>Morefields</HI> Preferments are in your Gift. The next is, Mr. <HI>A. B</HI>—, a Gentleman of very quick Parts. I can tell you, Sir, of my own Knowledge, he is not pleased with you; he has large Pretences, having for five Years last past, with prodigious Industry, labour'd for the Good of his Country, and his own ve∣ry great Profit, in publishing
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
Monthly Political Observations on the State of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> give me leave to tell you, this Mercurial Gentleman, did not expect to be at the Trouble of asking for a Place under a Whig Ministry, and took it in so much Dudgeon to find Mr. <HI>S—B</HI>—so well provided for in the very Post he expected himself, that he made a rash Resolve, not to be oblig'd to any of you for a Place; and the better to pro∣vide for himself, did turn the best Room in his House into a Shop, and sold his own Books; but I believe he is sick of the Trade, and it's possible it may not be too late yet, to make him yours. The next I shall mention, is the Author of the Flying Post; it is much wondered he is not distinguish'd: It was
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
reported, he was made first Cook in his M—s Kitchin, but I never believed it, and am well informed it is not so. There are several others that writ in the Whig Cause in the Time of the Popish Ministry, and had their Expectations, but their Works were never much read; so I shall pass them over, and leave to your Judgment, whether the worthy Gentlemen mention∣ed, are worth retaining or not: There is one Complaint, which, if true, carries some Weight with it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that there are several Persons still in Places, under his Majesty, that are no great Friends to his Government; but the Blame of this is laid upon the Old Corporal; for my Part, I blame no Body, but pray for a thorough Reformation. I shall
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
dwell no longer upon this Head, but conclude it with this Observation, that every Body out of Place think they have more Merit, than those that are in; and very few are willing to serve their Country for nought.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>ADDENDA.</HEAD>
<P>The Gentlemen Authors a∣bovementioned, bid me tell you, they should not have re∣sented their not being preferr'd so much, if <HI>S. R—S—l,</HI> Mr. <HI>A—n,</HI> Mr. <HI>H. M—n,</HI> and some others, to whom they think themselves in nothing in∣ferior, had not been so suddenly advanced.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>Of a Standing Army.</HEAD>
<P>THE Keeping up the Ar∣my, is a Topick much talked of amongst the Tories. They say, a Standing Army in <HI>England,</HI> has been always ac∣counted dangerous, and what makes our Liberties very pre∣carious: They say it is keeping a Bridle in the Peoples Mouths, that the Prince may ride them at Pleasure, and that it is a great Charge to the Nation; and all that they can possibly get by it, is Slavery: That there is now less Occasion for it than ever, because we are at perfect Peace with all the World, and that there is no Prospect of a new War: Nay, they say the Whigs themselves have always
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
professed themselves Enemies to a Standing Army, and won∣der they should be so zealous for it now, when it is so allow∣edly against the Interest of the Nation; and it is most certain, that these Gentlemen have great Reason for what they say; for the Interest of the Nation, upon the Schemes they have settled it, is certainly in Danger, nay and ruined, unless the Army, which is a Terrour to his Majesties Enemies, be disbanded: for as Matters are now managed, a poor harmless Fellow cannot abuse the King, or any of the Royal Family, but presently some saucy Red Coat knocks him down, or hales him to Justice: nay, there has been Complaints from several Parts of the Kingdom, besides <HI>Oxford,</HI> against the Inso∣lence
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
of the Soldiers, for beat∣ing and abusing several well∣meaning People, only for talking and acting as much Treason, as would have hanged them in the pious Times of <HI>Jacobus Se∣cundus;</HI> and not only that, but the Tories without Doors are apt to believe, if these queer Fellows were disbanded, and dispersed, several worthy Patri∣ots of the CHURCH PAR∣TY, would very piously and courageously despise the Septen∣nial Act, and refuse to sit in the House, after the Expiration of the Triennial, unless new chosen; but they will not an∣swer for their Courage, if these tremendous Gentlemen are kept together; and is it not a great Pity, that such worthy Patriots, such zealous Friends to their
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Country should be awed, and forced to obey the Laws of the Land, and especially such as they had a Hand in the making of themselves; besides, tho' their Hopes of serving the Pre∣tender are sunk very low, yet they think they have Interest enough among the Mob, if the Army were disbanded, to cause Riots, and make Disturbances enough to occasion a Change in the Ministry, which they most earnestly desire, though a new Set of Men of the same Principles came in their Places; they would be glad to compound that Way, to be revenged of those Men, who have so effectually ruined their Cause, and some of them are sanguine enough to believe there will be a Change in two Years at most; Now I
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
do not doubt but your self, and most of the present Mini∣stry, are good Patriots enough to use your utmost Interest in Parliament, to get the Army disbanded, and that speedily, especially when you consider, if it should be kept up two Years more, in all Likelyhood, these good CHURCH Men would never be able to ruin the Nation: They depend upon your utmost Diligence in this Affair, because you are their chief Favourite.</P>

<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>Septennial Act.</HEAD>
<P>THE Septennial Act the Tories declaim against most bitterly, as contrary to all Justice; it was what they could never have suspected, it has made the religious Cause of Po∣pery and Jacobitism utterly ir∣retrievable: Was ever any thing so monstrous, as to make such Laws to oppress poor People that were almost undone be∣fore? What Chance had they after the Rebels were beaten, destroyed, imprisoned, and hang∣ed? I say, what Chance could the poor distressed Prostitutes of Arbitrary Power have, ever to make any Figure again, but the Hopes of continuing and increa∣sing the Poyson, they hadbefore
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
spread over the Nation, in Or∣der to make good their Inte∣rest against the next Election? What Pains did they not take to raise Compassion in the Breasts of the People, for the poor unfortunate Gentlemen, as they call the Re∣bels: and to be sure, would have spared no Cost to have attain'd their Ends; for consider∣ing how many ventured Life and Estate in the Service of the Cause, and how many more we are sure were ready to do it upon the least Encouragement, it is out of the Dispute, whether they would have spent half their Estates to have gained a Parliament to their Mind: Nay, they were so sure, that they be∣gan to adjourn their further En∣deavours to serve their Master the Pretender till that Time, as
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
not doubting but they should then have an Opportunity to do it effectually: Therefore since Things are thus, it is hoped they may be allowed to com∣plain, they have nothing else left for it, this was their great and potent Cordial; so if you are not resolved wholly to pre∣vent them from ruining or disturbing the Nation, and ut∣terly to crush that Party that has for so many Years been undermining the Liberties of the People, you must get this Act repealed; they will be very much obliged to you: If you will do them this small Piece of Service, it will ease them in all Circumstances of Life: They cannot hear it named with∣out grinning, it makes them bite their Nails, stamp, and
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
what not: So pray Sir, if you have any Christian Charity, con∣sider what Set of Men this Act is a Grievance too, and relieve them as they deserve.</P>

<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>Ʋnmercifulness to State Criminals.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING has made a greater, or more exten∣sive Bustle, than this Complaint of the Inclemency of the present Government towards State Of∣fenders: and in Truth, no Man can well say it is altoge∣ther groundless; for let us but consider a little, and we must allow, that if at the first, the Tories of all Sorrs, both Male and Female, had been used with severer Discipline, it had kept them in more Awe; and several presuming too much upon the great Clemency of the Govern∣ment, towards Persons convict∣ed of Riots, reviling of the best of Kings, and insulting and a∣busing
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
his Ministry: I say, ma∣ny presuming too much upon this, have fallen into the same villanous Practice, (which more Severity might have prevented) whereby they have ruined them∣selves and Families; and in this, and this Sense only, can I con∣ceive any Room to accuse his Majesty or his Ministry of Seve∣rity. I am sure they can have no Reason to complain on this Head, in Relation to the Re∣bels; if they will please to con∣sider in what manner they were taken, and that if they had eve∣ry Man been killed upon the Spot, it was what they ought to have expected in their Circum∣stances, and what no body could have justly found Fault with; but we will leave these Men to their present Circum∣stances,
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
and only ask our Tory Brethren, whether they can say, they have been hardly dealt with, when they recollect, the many scandalous, treasonable, and vil∣lanous Reflections they have daily cast on the King, and the Royal Family; there are few of them in their private Capacities, but would have resented the Usage they have given their So∣vereign in a more rigid Manner than he has done: And the Tory Ladies, (even from those of the best Fashion, to the <HI>Rose∣mary-Lane</HI> Bunters,) have been very notorious in this Particular, and many of them continue the same still: The whole Conversa∣tion of their Tea-Tables has been Lies, Raillings, and <HI>Billins∣gate,</HI> too filthy, silly, and scan∣dalous to repeat: They have giv∣en
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
up the common Modesty of their Sex, and by turning Poli∣ticians, have so sower'd their Brows, that they have divested themselves of that Softness that charms Mankind. It has been no uncommon Thing to see a fine Lady straddle, frown, and stare you in the Face, like a Grenadier: nay, most of them, with the Addition of a Pair of Whiskers, would make tolera∣ble Saracens: how many are daily guilty of Petty Treason, in drinking Healths to the at∣tainted Enemies of their Coun∣try, and Prosperity in too plain Terms to their Popish Idol; and how few are, or have been punished for it. Should a Man say, my Lady <HI>Betty</HI>—has a Pimple on her Bum, no∣thing less than a Stab would
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
attone for the Offence: but the Ladies may say what they please of <HI>Her Royal Highness,</HI> without Breach of their new fa∣shion'd Modesty, or good Man∣ners: great Unmercifulness, per∣secuting Ministry, that will not suffer these poor People, either Quality or Mob, to speak Trea∣son, nor revile the Royal Family, without Danger, nay, tho' they are true <HI>Church</HI> Folks; bad Times! bad Times!</P>

<HEAD>Of the Clergy.</HEAD>
<P>AS my Way in my Pleasures is to begin, and end the Day with those I like best; so in these my Complaints, I will take the same Method: The greatest Grievance in Life is, to be hurt in our worldly Interest, and next to that, we are for taking Care of our Souls, I only speak as the World acts; for I find the first Endeavours of Mankind is, to get Wealth and Preferment, (which they call Honour,) that they may in∣dulge themselves, and live mer∣rily in this Life, and they are also very willing, when they come to die, to get a sure Pass to Hea∣ven; and therefore I think we ought to have a great Regard
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
for the Clergy, especially if, as they tell us, our Pass won't do, unless they sign it: Now at this Time, it is said by those that call themselves good Churchmen, that a great many Orthodox Divines are neglected and ill used for very small Matters, only because their Consciences are not true Wash Leather: In∣deed they were pretty comply∣ing, they easily stretched to for∣mer Oaths, amongst the rest that of the Abjuration: but now Oaths to his present Majesty are tendred, they shrink from the Size of a Canonical Hat, to that of a Face patch, and are won∣derful stiff and unpliant: It is well known, that most of these Gentlemen are merry, honest, jovial Fellows, and drink the Church as heartily as any of the
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
Bishops can do, Ay and to the <HI>BEST in Christendom</HI> too, I know it to be true: And is it not a Shame, such Christians should be de∣prived of their Livings, because they are Enemies to the Govern∣ment? Nay, they are not such great Enemies as some imagine neither; for they would swear to King <HI>George,</HI> though they hate him, provided he would change the present Ministry, and take in Tories. The Whigs have been always looked upon by these Orthodox Saints as Enemies to the Church: and is it without Reason, when it is so well known, that they have always violently opposed the Church's being independent of the State, and have the Impudence to maintain, according to the Can∣nons, that the King is the
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
Head of it: I will be Judge by my Good <HI>L—B</HI>—of <HI>R</HI>—, and the Dean of <HI>St. Patrick,</HI> if this is not Atheism, Deism, Socinianism, Free-think∣ing, Presbyterianism, Whoring, Drinking, and every Thing that is bad: I am sure, I have known several honest Whigs, that go constantly to Church, graced with the abovementioned Epi∣thets; and I could never learn any other Reason for it, than that they were violently against Priestcraft, and the Dominion of these Saints here upon Earth: I must beg of you, Sir, to consider with your self, whether it is not more for the Interest of your Country, to get the present Ministry chang'd, than to let the Church lose such a Set of <HI>Lights:</HI> consider their Noble,
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
florid Looks, their double Chins, their Glorious Ruby Faces, which will certainly fade and grow languid, if they are not re-establish'd: If you do not take Care of them, their Iron Con∣sciences, which formerly could batter down any Thing, will be turn'd into Lead, and be melted by their Afflictions. I am afraid the <HI>Holbourn</HI> Doctor, &amp;c. will soon grow weary of sup∣porting them, and then, alas! what Remedy have they, but to repent, grow Religious, and take anew those Oaths, which they have in Effect taken several Years since: Consider, Sir, the separate Congregations they have got together can be but a small Subsistance, being made up of Butchers, Herb-Women, and Apprentice Boys, and Persons
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
of the meaner Sort of those Clans: I am certainly inform'd, that a Tavern Boy, and a Jour∣neyman Taylor, are Church∣wardens to two of them: Indeed they may fitly enough compare themselves to the Primitive Times by the Meanness of their Followers, but it would be better for them if they could as truly do it by the Simplicity of their Lives: O! did you but know, how the mock Daughters of <HI>Sion</HI> bewail, and lament the Downfal of these sham Mar∣tyrs: not a Dram of <HI>Geneva,</HI> but belches out a Curse against the Whig Ministry, for reducing so many sturdy, able bodied Men: it ought to be consider∣ed also, that the depriving the Church of so many Men, who no Body pretends to charge
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
with having either Morals, Re∣ligion, or Honesty, gives our Enemies a great Advantage in spreading their Clamours of the present Dangers of the Church: and with good Reason too, for if you turn out such wicked Men, who do you think will come to the Church: a great Pleasure indeed to any one to hear an Honest Pious Man always telling him of his Faults, and reminding him of his Duty to God and the King: Who can bear to be di∣sturbed in their <HI>CHRISTIAN LIBERTIES:</HI> It is well known, the Jovial Crew lately turn'd out for refusing Oaths, that did not please their Consciences, never did it: and if a Man was honest, that is, would drink and swear for the Church, he was al∣lowed to have the Root of the
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
Matter in him, and easily got a safe Pass: so that upon the whole, you are humbly desired, and that with good Reason, by all Papists, Jacobites, Whores, Bawds, &amp;c. to do your best to get these Men preferr'd: they desire, if possible, you would do it with∣out tendring them the Oaths.</P>
