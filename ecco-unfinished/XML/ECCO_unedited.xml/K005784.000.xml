<L><HI>OH</HI> such a sight! I've been upon the course,</L>
<L>And he may talk his nonsense tell he's hoarse:</L>
<L>What matters an old <HI>Canterbury</HI> story?</L>
<L>Upon my soul <HI>Newmarket's</HI> in its glory.</L>
<L>Such galloping, such gambling and such betting,</L>
<L>Such capering, such cutting and curvetting!</L>
<L>Oh, such a world of bothering and of noise,</L>
<L>So many Cambridge hacks and College boys:</L>
<L>Then there is such a riot and a rattle</L>
<L><HI>With lists of</HI> terrible, terrible high-bred cattle;</L>
<L>List of the sporting Ladies, Sir?—<HI>O Lord,</HI></L>
<L>This foolish poet's <HI>no where,</HI> take my word.</L>
<L>He's jaded at two <HI>heats,</HI> as I'm alive,</L>
<L>'Tis well it's out of rule to start for five.</L>
<L>What signifies his farce! 'tis all a jest;</L>
<L>Upon my soul <HI>Firetail's</HI> a lovely beast—</L>
<L>So sleak, so trim, so slender and so thin,</L>
<L>They lead him out and then they lead him in.</L>

<L>(What was his name?) that made his horse Lord May'r;</L>
<L>He might have choice and plenty, a whole stud</L>
<L>Of Senators and Consuls, thorough blood.</L>
<L>What neighing after one another's spouses,</L>
<L>What snorting and what kicking in both <HI>houses!</HI></L>
<L>Shake but the sieve, as sure as I am born,</L>
<L>There's none amongst 'em, but wou'd <HI>come to corn.</HI></L>

Why such a hair-brain'd spark might think it wit</L>
<L>To turn his stable loose into the pit:</L>

<L>And filthy duns and old flea-bitten greys,</L>

<HEAD>ACT I. SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>A Gaming-House. <HI>Rivers</HI> is discover'd asleep on a couch; dice boxes on the table, with candles nearly burnt out; the floor spread with cards, and his hat and sword lying upon it: the room in great disorder. <HI>Sunderland</HI> enters; and, after contemplating him sometime, speaks.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO, so! broad noon and your night just begun—what drudgery it is to be a gamester! a watch∣man's dog enjoys more quiet. Yes, you may turn and toss, young Sir, there's no composure in that sleep of your's: Oh! that your brother bubbles, some of the noble jockies, wou'd look in, and profit by the scene! will no earthquake swallow down Newmarket? Well, I shall not molest you, sleep while you can, and either wake to a repent∣ance of your follies, or never wake again.</P>
<STAGE>(Rivers starts out of his sleep.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who's there? What's that? Where am I? Sun∣derland! I've dropt asleep; why, what's o'clock? Oh, now I recollect it all. Fool, fool, what have I done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, Mr. Rivers, you've not been in bed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, you find me as you left me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's four hours ago; I left you before eight, and 'tis now turn'd of twelve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! You're a successful player, Mr. Sun∣derland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>As it happens;—I believe I won a trifle of you last night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>A trifle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are a few hundreds, or call 'em thousands? what are they? a feather to your fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not deceiv'd; the sum I stand indebted to you breaks up my whole estate; I shou'd not mention difficulties justly affecting myself, but as my lands lie principally in Ireland, 'twill ask some patience on your part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take your time, Mr. Rivers; my occasions do not press; take your own time; or if you like it better take your revenge. <STAGE>(pointing to the table.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, may this hand of mine, that shakes that
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
cursed box, drop from my wrist before it sets a sin∣gle guinea on a cast again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you be serious? what was fortune doing, when she gave me such success? I'm sorry it disturbs you—break up your estate! it must not be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must excuse me, Sir; if you are paid, I trust you'll leave the mode of it to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I mistake not, Mr. Rivers, you've an uncle daily expected from India.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear too he has made a considerable fortune: spare your estate and give me a <HI>post-obit</HI> upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not for the world;—you totally mistake me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you regard such scruples, give me leave to say you play but half the game: with the professors of the art the lives of uncles, sathers, dowagers and aunts, are handed over with as much indifference as the cattle in their stables. Either forswear your scruples or the dice. What! no doubt you are your uncle's heir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not. How can I, who have lost my fortune by my folly, expect that he will give me his, who gain'd it by his industry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>His principle I see is sound. <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Well, I
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
shall urge this point no further—there is yet an∣other hope, another reprieve for your estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>A wife, a fond generous woman, with a season∣able recruit of cash: such may be found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, let me tell you, such a one is found—peruse that note. <STAGE>(giving him a note.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Cheveley! is it possible? she at Newmarket!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>She: and what think you but an uncontroulable attachment brought her hither, to be the talk and may game of the place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who dares to talk about her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do;—every man who has a tongue;—all the grooms and lacqueys in Newmarket:—why the sun is not more clear than that she dotes upon you to distraction—by my soul, she's dying for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot be a rascal;—I am not fit for the society of virtue;—besides she has now such advantages in point of fortune—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>That there's positively no resisting the temptation.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, well! but why should Supervisor prove a rogue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>EPPING.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, an please your honour, there's bad blood in his pedigree: is not he full brother to Matthew Mite, out of Nabob's Dam Scullion? and did your honour ever know a colt of Scul∣lion's, but what train'd for all the world like a hackney?</P>

<SPEAKER>SECRETARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will your honour be pleased to give attention to this dispatch? the messenger is waiting, and 'tis a matter of the last consequence to the peace and interest of Great Britain.</P>

<P>Please your honour, he was within three pounds six ounces this very morning: the lad is here; come hither, Jack; he is in as promising a con∣sumption as heart can wish.</P>

<SPEAKER>ISSACHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>War, war; loss of credit; fall of stocks; heavy, heavy is the word with me: debt upon debt; tax upon tax; long arrears and short pay∣ments; other people's loss is my gain—so lies my account.</P>

<P>Good Sir, be more serious; the messenger must be dispatch'd; in my apprehension, this be∣fore you is the nicest question for political dis∣cussion I have met since I knew business.</P>

<P>I took him in the very crisis of his fate; flush'd with his morning's sport, and warm with company and wine: fortune conspir'd with the opportunity; our play ran deep; he with the impatience of a losing gamester press'd his evil luck, and when the morning arose, it found him wearied out with watching and stript of half his fortune.</P>

<P>I think you may;—h e has none of the vices of his trade about him; he is not covetous, he is not cruel; it is fashion which corrupted Mr. Rivers; nature never meant to waste so good a heart upon a gamester.</P>

<P>No, I respect your taste; where is the nation that can exhibit such a meeting?

<P>My name is Spavin, and I deal in horses: I am well known at Newmarket; I generally keep a good nag under me; when a man is on the win∣ning side, it is convenient for collecting betts—</P>

<P>Let me march out with the honours of love, and I'll evacuate the garrison. Thus let me give you joy. <HI>(Kisses her hand)</HI> And since I am not worthy to possess the prize myself, let me be∣stow it on a friend who is. <STAGE>(presents the note.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> CHEVELEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your gallantry becomes you.—What shall I say? O, Rivers! reformed as I perswade myself you truly are, you merit all that I can give. The worthless scrap is your's; you must conclude the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus on my knees I thank you; not in words, for love and gratitude stop those, but in the silent speakings of a heart, which is for ever and entirely your's.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAC CORMUCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Silent speakings! troth, if you spoke that aloud▪ you cou'd say no less.</P>

<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Joy, joy betide you both! may a long series of continued happiness spring from this auspicious moment!</P>

<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! you know not what you do. I am a ruin'd man.</P>

<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I must interpose. You have an uncle, of whom it seems you've lost all memory; he is return'd from India, rich as your wishes can desire;—I# am he.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merciful heaven! my creditor my uncle!—This is too much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>REVELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd to fortune, all my creditors were of that sort?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUNDERLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>At my return I found you plung'd in a dis∣graceful practise;—I follow'd you from place to place; associated myself with you in your prodi∣galities, in your play. Your principle and your attachment to this lady saved you in my esteem;—your reformation is now I trust confirmed, and I re∣ceive you to my arms with joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I blush at the recollection.</P>

<P>Oh! where is little Shallinghorag now?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear nothing; since you think our demands have been too heavy, take it rent-free for your life, and in return administer my interests with more humanity and better fortune than your predecessor:—tell my needy tenants, they shall no longer be rack'd to pamper the car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase of a race-horse,

and support the profligate excesses of a gaming table.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAC CORMUCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you are a noble genius! and were all absentees of your mind, we wou'd leave their estates untax'd for ever.</P>

<SPEAKER>REVELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Rivers, prate against Newmarket if you dare. Many a good match have I seen made upon this turf, but never one so equal, so judicious as the present.</P>
