<HEAD>THE NEW THEATRE of FUN.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Aristophanes first heard of the late Sir F. B. Delaval's death, the shock of lo∣sing so intimate a friend had such an effect up∣on him, that he burst into tears, retired to his room, and saw no company for the whole day. Next day at noon coming down to his dinner, he asked his treasurer, with swollen eyes, when they intended burying him? "Not till next week," replied the other, "as the surgeons are first to examine his breast and <HI>head▪"</HI> This last word recovered the wit's fancy, and repeating it with some surprise, asked, <Q>“And what the De∣vil will they get there? I'm sure, says he, I've known poor Frank these five and twenty years, and I never could find <HI>any thing</HI> in it.”</Q></P>
<P>The death of the late Mr. Holland of Drury∣lane (who was the son of a baker at Chiswick) had likewise a very great effect on Aristophanes's
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
spirits when first he heard of it. Being appoin∣ted by the will of the deceased as one of his bearers, he attended the corpse to the family vault at Chiswick, and there very sincerely paid a plentiful tribute of tears to his memory. On his return to town he called at the Bedford cof∣fee house, when an acquaintance coming up to him, asked him, if he had not been paying the last compliment to his friend Holland? "Yes, poor boy," replies Foote, (sniveling at the same time) <Q>“I've just been seeing him <HI>shoved</HI> into the <HI>family even.</HI>”</Q></P>
<P>Davies, one of Foote's familiars, was one day admiring his master's performance on the stage, and exclaiming in the highest terms of his abi∣lities: a plain, sober man hearing his extrava∣gant praises without emotion, turned to the person next to him, and asked him, what he thought of his acting, "for," says he, "I don't mind Da∣vies, for Foote and he play into one another's hands."</P>
<P>A gentleman calling on Foote, at North-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, found him drinking coffee by the side of a piece of water in his ground; as he approached, he observed a smart, dapper man walking hastily a∣way. Says Foote, "I have been at cards, and lost some cash with that youth; however, it is well for him, for he was in want of two things which I have supplied him with▪" "What are they?" says the gentleman. <HI>"Money and wit."</HI></P>
<P>Foote travelling to the north once, put up at a bye inn on the road, where he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather dis∣tressed
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
for want of accommodations. "What," says he, "have you no cold meat in the house, landlord?" "No, Sir," says the host, "we have not dressed any for some days, as my poor wise lays dead up stairs." "Zounds!" says Foote, "never complain again of your larder, for there is no cold meat equal to a dead wife."</P>
<P>When Foote brought out his puppet▪show at the Hay-market, it was reported, that he had procured in wood the likenesses of the principal performers at the theatres. A gentleman there∣fore took an opportunity of calling▪ at his play∣house, and seeing a figure hang up, he said with some emotion, "Bless me! that is very like Woodward." "Yes," says Foote, "so it is; and I expect Garrick's home from the turner's every minute." He afterwards compensated for this jest, in a conversation with Punch, by say∣ing, "We have got Garrick's head in the house, but we want his brains."</P>
<P>Mr. Colman used always to say of Foote's jokes, they were fuller's earth, and rubbed off when dry.</P>
<P>A certain comedian, who was formerly a cook, fought a duel with a gentleman of the theatre. This being mentioned to Foote, he answered, "Yes, damn him for an ungrateful fellow, 'twas I took the spit from the fire, put it by his side, and made him a gentleman"</P>
<P>Mr. Foote dining one day with Lord Town∣shend, after his duel with Lord Bell<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mont, the wine being bad, and the dinner ill-dressed, made
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Foote observe to his Lordship, that he could not discover what reason could compel his Lordship to take up arms, when he might have effected his purpose another way, and with much more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase to himself. "Why, how," replied his Lord∣ship, "could I have acted otherwise?" "How!" replied Foote, "you should have invited him to dine with your Lordship, as you have done me, and poisoned him."</P>
<P>Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g one day with Lord Mansfield, he mentioned that his patent was confined, and that be wished to have it extended for the perfor∣mance of plays in the winter; for which pur∣pose, continued Foote, I drew up a petition to his Majesty—"Well," says my Lord, "and what answer did he give you, Mr Foote?" "My Lord," replied the wag, "he paid no more attention to it, than if all the people of England had petitioned him."</P>
<P>Foote dining at the Castle at Richmond, when Lady Harrington had also a party at the same tavern, there was a dispute about a room, when Foote meeting her Ladyship, said, "I have set∣tled the dispute, my Lady; I assured them, that the room which my company had got, could not be your Ladyship's, <HI>for there was no bed in it."</HI></P>
<P>Tom Osborne, the Bookseller, who was a man of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rvy habit of body, and had issues in his back and arms, discharged his gardiner sud∣denly, whom Foote hired without a character. The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e opposite beings meeting at a venison feast in Hampstead, Mr. Osborne attacked him for
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
taking a man without enquiring his character. "Sir," says Foote, "the man told me, you put him to a wrong use, and not to the business of his profession, for you made him plant peas in your back, and not in your garden."</P>
<P>A lady being le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a great fortune by her hus∣band, she married immediately. On the day of the marriage, a gentleman meeting Lord Lyt∣tleton, said, "Has your Lordship heard the news to-day?—Lady *** is married to Captain ***?" "No," replied his Lordship, "this is news to me, indeed; <HI>for I laid with her last night, and she never mentioned a word about it."</HI></P>
<P>Mr. W—meeting with Mr. G—who had been reading his own works at court, W—asked him, if this was his idea of elegant retire∣ment; to read his own works to the dullest man in the nation, a German woman, who knew not a word of the language, and a parcel of untutor∣ed children out of the nursery—Oh, what a sal∣ling off is here!</P>
<P>A certain gentleman of the stage, celebrated for his conjugal sidelity, was often saying in com∣pany with Foote, that he had not laid from his wife once in twenty years. "May be not," says Foote, "nor with her."</P>
<P>Politicks being one day the topick of Foote's table, he humourously pun'd on the reigns of the three Georges, thus; King George the first had a turbulent, stormy <HI>rain</HI>—King George the second had a fertile and refreshing <HI>rain</HI>—but George the third has nothing more than a dull Scots mist.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Foote frequently used to describe the miser∣able petit state of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trelitz, by saying, that when a visitor came unexpectedly, they were obliged to lie three in a bed.</P>
<P>Foote <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ining on a turtle, at the castle at Rich∣mond; when he had got into his chario<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and was goingaway, a tall, lank, sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ek fellow of an hos∣tler came to the carriage, with a demure face, and says to Foote, "I hope, Sir, you will remem∣ber the hostler." "I believe I shall," says he, "when I see you again." The answer petrified the fellow, and he drove off, leaving him motion∣less.</P>
<P>Lord K—, who had a remarkable large, round, red face, took lodgings next to Foote's, and the back window of his room looked into the wit's garden. Foote walking one cold morning in the spring into his melon-ground, discover∣ed his Lordship in the window. "Good morning to your Lordship." Says my Lord, "It is a very chill morning, Mr. Foote." Yes," says the wag, "it is, and I wish your Lordship would do me the honour to turn your counte∣nance upon my cucumbers."</P>
<P>Foote coming down the Hay-market, a beg∣gar asked him for a half-penny; he gave him a sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, saying▪ "Whenever you see a gentle∣man like myself never offend him, by asking for a hal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-penny."</P>
<P>A gentleman asked Foote one day in a very formal manner, whether he had any issue? "Yes," replied the wag, "I have two running, Sir, and you are welcome to 'em both."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9"/>
When Wilkes was lord-mayor, Foote attend∣ed the Easter dinner, and leaning on a friend's arm, he was greatly crouded, where he observed a large woman very big with child—Zounds!" says the friend, "I wish we were out of this croud." "Ay," says Foote, turning to the wo∣man, "and if this lady was delivered too, there would be no harm in it"</P>
<P>Dr Goldsmith was, without exception, the vainest man of his person, and a man of the plainest person you could see; when he dined with Foote, he used to place himself at table op∣posite a large pier-glass, in which the Doctor would be always admiring himself, and neglect his victuals; however, vanity led the Doctor to the thoughts of matrimony, and he believed a beautiful young lady where he visited was much in love with him. These trifles got air, and some of the particulars were mentioned in a pa∣per published by Evans, in Paternoster-row. The Doctor, incensed, flew to the shop, and when he entered, the bookseller was stooping for something behind the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unter; Goldsmith, not regarding that, struck him with his cane, and knocked him down; the man astonished and con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded got up, and beat the Doctor so se∣verely, that he was confined for some time for the impetuosity of his temper.</P>
<P>Foote, whose talent lay in lampooning and mi∣micry, even in his early days, had once got the knack of imitating a late general officer, in the shrug of his shoulders, the lisping of his speech, and some other things for which the General
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
was remarkable, that it grew a common topic a∣mong his acquaintance, who used to say, "Come, Sam, let us have the General's company." A friend, at length, acquainted the officer of it, who sent for Foote: "Sir," says the General, "I hear you have an excellent talent at mimick∣ing characters, and among the rest, I find I have been the subject of your ridicule." "Oh, Lord, Sir," says Foote, with great pleasantry, "I take all my acquaintance off at times, and what is more particular. I often take m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>self off." "Gad so▪" says the other, "pray let us have a speci∣men." Foote on this, puts on his hat and gloves, takes hold of his cane, and making a short bow, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the room. The officer waited some minutes for his return; but at length, on enquiry, found he had really taken himself off, by leaving the house. The officer was Gen▪ Blakene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with whom he was afterwards in the strictest friend∣ship</P>
<P>When Sir Thomas Robinson's shares of Rane∣lagh were to be sold, a gentleman calling upon Foote, the wit asked him, if he had any money to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pare; "For if you have," say he, "you'll find a share of Ranelagh to be a good thing, for G.▪and all the Jews are after the pur∣chase"</P>
<P>Mrs. Foote, mother of Aristophanes, was of a very whimsical turn of mind, and experienced the caprice of fortune nearly as much as her son. The day she was sent prisoner to the King's-Bench, Foote was taken to a spunging-house, when the following laconic letters passed between the mother
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
and son: "Dear Sam, I am in prison." "Dear mother, so am I."</P>
<P>Foote attended the theatre one evening, when a new lady appeared with some gleam <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Churchill, in his Rosciad, thus speaks of this lady.</P>
<Q><L>"Happy in this, behold amidst the throng,</L>
<L>"With transient gleams of grace, Hart sweeps a∣long."</L></Q></NOTE>of grace. Foote asked a gentleman by him, what was the lady's name? "Reddish, Sir," says the stranger. "It is Horse-Reddish then, by G—d," says he.</P>
<P>Foote's tallow chandler came to him one mor∣ning, with a very long face, telling him a dole∣ful tale, as how his shop had been broken open, and a great quantity of candles stolen out of it; "Well," says Foote, "never mind it, my dear Greasy, they will all come to light again in time."</P>
<P>Mr. Foote, in his return from Bath, dined at the Castle at Salt-hill; the bill being very ex∣travagant, he sent for the landlady—"Pray, Madam," says he, "is not your name Partridge?" "Yes, Sir." "I think it should have been Wood∣cock, by the length of your bill."</P>
<P>Mr. Foote attending with Sir John St. Alban, Mr. Fielding's examination into the legality of the Harmonic Meeting, said, the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e were no want of amusements, there were the two play-houses, the opera▪house in the Hay market, and opposite, the facetious <HI>Aristophanes.</HI> "Who?" says Sir
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
John▪ <HI>"Harry Stephens, "replied Foote.</HI> "What," the man that reads lectures upon heads?" "The same." "I know him well," replied the knight.</P>
<P>Miss Sherry playing a part at Drury-lane, a person asked Foote, what he thought of the Sher∣ry? "Oh!" says the wag, "it is pricked."</P>
<P>A gentleman meeting Foote in his carriage, drawn by four duns, exclaimed, "I am glad to see, Sam, that you drive the duns." Foote an∣swered, "And so am I, for they have driven me a long time."</P>
<P>In the manors of East and West-Enborne, in the county of Berks, and elsewhere, the inhabi∣tants have the following antient custom. "If a cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tomary tenant die, the widow shall have what the law calls her Free-Bench in all his co∣py-hold lands, <HI>dum sola &amp; casta suerit,</HI> that is, while she lives single and chaste; but if she com∣mits incontinency, she forfeits her estate; yet if she will come into the court riding upon a black ram, with his tail in her hand, and say the words following, the steward is bound by the custom to re admit her to her Free-Bench.</P>
<LG>
<L>Here I am,</L>
<L>Riding upon a black ram,</L>
<L>Like a whore as I am;</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or my crin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um crancum,</L>
<L>Have lost my bincum bancum;</L>
<L>And, for my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l's game,</L>
<L>Have done this wordly shame,</L>
<L>Therefore, I pray you, Mr. Steward, let me have my land again."</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13"/>
"I have, according to my promise, been at great pains in searching out the records of the black ram; and have at last met with the pro∣ceedings of the court-baron, held in that behalf, for the space of a whole day. The record saith, that a strict inquisition having been made into the right of the tenants to their several estates, by a crafty old steward, he found that many of the lands of the manor were, by default of the several widows, forfeited to the lord, and accor∣dingly would have entered on the premises: up∣on which the good women demanded the bene∣fit of the ram. The steward, after having peru∣sed their several pleas, adjourned the court to Barnaby-bright, that they might have day enough before them.</P>
<P>The court being set, and filled with a great concourse of people, who came from all parts to see the solemnity, the first who entered was the widow Frontly, who had made her appearance in the last year's cavalcade. The register observes, that finding it an easy pad-ram, and foreseeing she might have further occasion for it, she purchased it of the steward.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sarah Dainty, relict of Mr. John Dain∣ty, (who was the greatest prude in the parish) came next in the procession. She at first made some difficulty of taking the tail in her hand; and was observed in p onouncing the form of penance, to soften the two most emphatical words into clincum clancum: But the steward took care to make her speak plain English, before he would let her have her land again.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14"/>
The third widow that was brought to this worldly shame, being mounted upon a vicious ram, had the misfortune to be thrown by him: upon which she hoped to be excused from going through the rest of the ceremony: but the ste∣ward being well versed in the law, observed ve∣ry wisely upon this occasion, that the breaking of the rope does not hinder the execution of the criminal.</P>
<P>The fourth lady upon record was the widow Ogle, a famous coquette, who had kept half a score young fellows off and on for the space of two years; but having been more kind to her carter John, she was introduced with the huzzas of all her lovers about her.</P>
<P>Mrs Sable appearing in her weeds, which were very new and fresh, and of the same colour with her whimsical Palfrey, made a very decent figure in the sole<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity</P>
<P>Another, who had been summoned to make her appearance, was xcused by the steward▪ as well knowing in his heart, that the good squire himself had qualified her for the ram.</P>
<P>Mrs Quick having nothing to object against the indictment, pleaded her belly. But it was remembred that she made the same excuse the year before. Upon which the steward observed that she might so contrive it, as never to do the service of the manor.</P>
<P>The widow Fidget being cited into court, in∣sisted that she had done no more since the death of her husband, than what she used to do in his life-time; and withal desired Mr. steward to con∣sider
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
his own wife's case if he should chance to die before her.</P>
<P>The next in order was a Dowager of a very corpulent make, who would have been excused, as not finding any ram that was able to carry her; upon which the steward commuted her punish∣ment, and ordered her to make her entry upon a black ox.</P>
<P>The widow Maskwell, a woman who had long lived with most unblemished character, having turned off her old chambermaid in a pet, was by that revengeful creature brought in upon the black ram nine times the same day.</P>
<P>Several widows of the neighbourhood, being brought upon their trial, shewed that they did not hold of the manor, and were discharged ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>A pretty young creature who closed the pro∣cession came ambling in, with so bewitching an air, that the steward was observed to cast a sheep's eye upon her, and married her within a month after the death of his wife"</P>
<P>A clergyman (who was remarkable for his dirty hands) conversing with Foote, was explain∣ing how much he had improved his living, "For," says he, "I have taken all the tythes in∣to my own <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands." "Yes," says Foote, "I see you have, Doctor, <HI>and the glebe too."</HI></P>
<P>Mr. P—v—s, the old page, had frequently invited Mr. Foote to dine at St. James's; at last, Foote accepted the invitation. Being seated at table, he was given to understand, that part of a German boar was ordered by his M—for their

"Non, non, non, Mr Foute; we do tell dem before dey do approach de presence, dat dey must not ask de faveur, nor talk of de affairs of de state, for de world." "Very true," says Foote; "upon my word, I did not think you were so prudent, or so well amused at court."</P>
<P>Foote going to Dublin, took a place in the Chester-fly, in which were many passengers un∣known to him, and one who wore a mask the whole journey. The coachman, not attentive to the road, overset the carriage, when the mask∣ed lady was turned topsy-turvy, and her <HI>latter end</HI> coming directly in Foote's face, he cried out, "God bless me, is it you, my dear Mrs. A—! I really did not know you before."</P>
<P>A certain lady was cook to Foote, and he took her from the kitchen to the parlour. After her marriage, he frequently enquired about her; by saying, "Well how is Nanny? I spoiled a good cook when I made her a gentlewoman; 'twas I that raised her from the dripping-pan to the drawing-room"</P>
<P>Foote being one day on the river Avon with a party of ladies and gentlemen, and the boat be∣ing ordered to a particular place, where the wit happened to owe a sum of money, he said, he had a particular aversion to that place; the com∣pany, however, were all bent upon going thither: Foote remonstrated; the company laughed at him▪
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>

Will heard his ma∣ster's voice, and answered as loudly, "Here, Sir! I am coming;" and marched off with the shroud upon his back, amidst the loudest applau∣ses that were ever heard in the theatre. Even Mrs. Oldfield, who was the Calista, was insensi∣bly drawn into a smile, and the play ended im∣mediately with repeated bursts of laughter.</P>

Captain Beard wore a full-powdered wig, and

when introduced to the King, his Majesty rose, shook his head, spluttered some strange jargon, and threw the greasy cap in his face; Mr. Beard, a little surprized at the oddity of this sa∣lute, after some recollection, spluttered again in a similar jargon, and dashed his great white wig in the black fellow's face.

<P>During the time of the attack on Sullivan's island, General Lee was one day reconnoitring the communication made by the bridge of boats between that place and the continent.

"'Sdeath, Sir," cried Lee, "what do you mean? Do you dodge? Do you know that the King of Prussia lost above a hundred aid∣de-camps in one campaign?" "So I understand, Sir," replied the young officer, "but I did not think you could spare so many."</P>

The King, after thanking him one day for his excel∣lent discourse, asked the reason why he made such a distinction between the court and his own parishioners, as to preach to the latter with∣out book, and to read his sermon to the for∣mer. "And may it please your Majesty," said the Doctor, "when I am in the royal chapel, I find myself in another world; I have the eyes of your Majesty, and of all the lords and ladies of the court upon me, and it becomes me to weigh every word I utter.

<P>Mr. Wilkes and Churchill were invited by the Earl of Temple to Stow; when they came there, some of the company insinuated, that the dairy maid was one of the greatest beauties of the country. Churchill hearing this, was so impatient to see her, that he left the table before the dinner was over, and returned with his wig pulled all to pieces, and his fat cheeks slapped in such a manner, that they were as red as bull beef. His Lordship knowing the humour of the wench, winked to Churchill not to say any thing, which he readily taking, whispered to Wilkes, that he had seen her, and she would easily com∣ply with his desires, being an amazing fine girl. Wilkes sat very uneasy; at last he rose and hastened to the dairy, and from Churchill's re∣commendation, he began to be very familiar with her at once; this exasperated the maiden, and she beat poor Wilkes in such a manner, that when he returned to the company, his disheveled locks confessed the engagement he had been in.

Immediately the city▪gates flew open, and a female procession appeared, multitudes of the sex following one another in a row, and staggering under their respective
<PB N="71" REF="71"/>
burdens. I took my stand upon an eminence in the enemy's camp, which was appointed for the general rendezvous of these female carriers, being very desirous to look into their several lad∣ings. The first of them had a huge sack upon her shoulders, which she set down with great care: upon the opening of it, when I ex∣pected to have seen her husband shot out of it, I found it was filled with china▪ware. The next appeared in a most decent figure, carrying a handsome young fellow upon her back: I could not sorbear commending the young woman for her conjugal affection, when, to my great sur∣prize, I found that she had left the good man at home, and brought away her gallant. I saw the third, at some distance, with a little withered face peeping over her shoulder, whom I could not suspect for any but her spouse, until upon her setting him down I heard her call him dear pug, and found him to be her favourite monkey. A fourth brought a huge bale of cards along with her; and the fifth a Bologna lap-dog; for her husband, it seems, being a very burly man, she thought it would be less trouble for her to bring away little Cupid. The next was the wife of a rich usurer, loaden with a bag of gold; she told us that her spouse was very old, and by the course of nature could not expect to live long; and that to shew her tender regard for him, she had saved that which the poor man loved better than his life. The next came towards us with her son upon her back, who, we were told, was the greatest rake in the place, but so much the
<PB N="72" REF="72"/>
mother's darling, that she left her husband be∣hind, with a large family of hopeful sons and daughters,</Q> for the sake of this grac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>less youth.</P>
<P><Q>“It would be endless to mention the several pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sons, with their several loads, that appeared to me in this strange vision. All the place a∣bout me was covered with packs of ribbons, brocades, embroidery, and ten thousand other materials, sufficient to have furnished a whole street of toy shops One of the women, hav∣ing a husband, who was none of the heaviest, was bringing him off upon her shoulders, at the same time that she carried a great bundle of Flanders lace under her arm; but finding her∣sen so over-loaden, that she could not save both of them, she dropped the good man, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght away the bundle. In short, I found <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut one husband among this great mountain of baggage, who was a lively cobler, that kicked and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>purred all the while his wife was carrying him on, and, as it was said, had scarce passed a day in his li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e without giving her the discipline of the strap”</Q>.</P>
