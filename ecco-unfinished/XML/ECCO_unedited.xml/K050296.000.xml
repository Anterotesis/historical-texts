<HEAD>To the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses in Par∣liament
Assembled.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HE that has Truth and Justice, and the Interest of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
in his Design, can have nothing to fear from an
<HI>English</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>This makes the Author of these Sheets, however Des∣picable
in himself, apply to this Honourable House, without any
Apology for the Presumption.</P>
<P>Truth, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> however meanly dress'd, and in whatsoever
bad Company she happens to come, was always entertain'd at
your Bar; and the Commons of <HI>England</HI> must cease to act like
themselves, or which is worse, like their Ancestors, when they
cease to entertain any Proposal, that offers it self at their Door, for
the general Good and Advantage of the People they Represent.</P>
<P>I willingly grant, That 'tis a Crime in good Manners to in∣terrupt
your more weighty Councils, and disturb your Debates;
with empty nauseous Trifles in Value, or mistaken Schemes,
and whoever ventures to Address You, ought to be well assur'd
he is in the right, and that the Matter suits the Intent of your
meeting, <HI>viz. To dispatch the weighty Affairs of the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>And as I have premis'd this, so I freely submit to any Censure
this Honourable Assembly shall think I deserve, if I have broke
in upon either of these Particulars.</P>
<P>I have but one Petition to make with respect to the Author,
and that is, That no freedom of Expression, which the Argu∣ments
may oblige him to, may be constru'd as a want of Respect,
and a breach of the due Deference every <HI>English</HI> Man owes to the
representing Power of the Nation.</P>
<P>It would be hard, that while I am honestly offering to your
Consideration something of Moment for the general Good, Pre∣judice
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
should lay Snares for the Author, and private Pique make
him an Offender for a Word.</P>
<P>Without entring upon other Parts of my Character, 'tis enough
to acquaint this Assembly, that I am an <HI>English</HI> Freeholder, and
have by that a Title to be concern'd in the good of that Commu∣munity
of which I am an unworthy Member.</P>
<P>This Honourable House is the Representative of all the Free∣holders
of <HI>England;</HI> you are Assembl'd for their Good, you study
their Interest, you possess Hearts, and you hold the Strings
of the general Purse.</P>
<P>To you they have Recourse for the Redress of all their Wrongs,
and if at any time one of their Body can offer to your Assistance,
any fair, legal, honest and rational Proposal for the publick Be∣nefit,
it was never known that such a Man was either rejected or
discourag'd.</P>
<P>And on this Account I crave the Liberty to assure you, That the
Author of this seeks no Reward; to him it shall always be Re∣ward
enough to have been capable of serving his native Country,
and Honour enough to have offer'd something for the publick
Good worthy of Consideration in your Honourable Assembly.</P>
<P><HI>Pauper Ʋhique jacet,</HI> said our famous Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when in
her Progress thro' the Kingdom she saw the vast Throngs of the
Poor, flocking to see and bless her; and the Thought put her
Majesty upon a continu'd study how to recover her People from
that Poverty, and make their Labour more prositable to them∣selves
in Particular, and the Nation in General.</P>
<P>This was easie then to propose, for that many useful Manu∣factures
were made in foreign Parts, which our People bought
with <HI>English</HI> Money, and Imported for their use.</P>
<P>The Queen, who knew the Wealth and vast Numbers of Peo∣ple
which the said Manufactures had brought to the neighbouring
Countries then under the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> being not yet
Revolted, never left off endeavouring what she happily brought
to pass, <HI>viz.</HI> the transplanting into <HI>England</HI> those Springs of Riches
and People.</P>
<P>She saw the <HI>Flemings</HI> prodigiously Numerous, their Cities stood
thicker than her Peoples Villages in some parts; all sorts of useful
Manufactures were found in their Towns, and all their People
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
were rich and busie, no Beggars, no Idleness, and consequently
no want was to be seen among them.</P>
<P>She saw the Fountain of all this Wealth and Workmanship, I
mean the Wool, was in her own Hands, and <HI>Flanders</HI> became the
Seat of all these Manufactures, not because it was naturally
Richer and more Populous than other Countries, but because it
lay near <HI>England,</HI> and the Staple of the <HI>English</HI> Wool which was
the Foundation of all their Wealth, was at <HI>Antwerp</HI> in the Heart of
that Country.</P>
<P>From hence, it may be said of <HI>Flanders,</HI> it was not the Riches
and the number of People brought the Manufactures into the
<HI>Low Countries,</HI> but it was the Manufactures brought the People
thither, and Multitudes of People make Trade, Trade makes
Wealth, Wealth builds Cities, Cities Enrich the Land round
them, Land Enrich'd rises in Value, and the Value of Lands En∣riches
the Government.</P>
<P>Many Projects were set on foot in <HI>England</HI> to Erect the Wool∣len
Manufacturer here, and in some Places it had found Encou∣ragement,
before the Days of this Queen, especially as to mak∣ing
of Cloath, but Stuffs, Bays, Says, Serges, and such like
Wares were yet wholly the Work of the <HI>Flemings.</HI></P>
<P>At last an Opportunity offer'd perfectly unlook'd for, <HI>viz.</HI> The
Persecution of the Protestants, and introducing the <HI>Spanish</HI> In∣quisition
into <HI>Flanders,</HI> with the Tyranny of the Duke <HI>D'Alva.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be an ungrateful Observation, here to take notice how
Tyranny and Persecution, the one an Oppression of Property,
the other of Conscience, always Ruine Trade, Impoverish Nati∣ons,
Depopulate Countries, Dethrone Princes, and Destroy
Peace.</P>
<P>When an <HI>English</HI> Man reflects on it, he cannot without infi∣nite
Satisfaction look up to Heaven, and to this Honourable
House, <HI>that</HI> as the spring, <HI>this</HI> as the Stream <HI>from</HI> and <HI>by</HI> which
the Felicity of this Nation has obtain'd a Pitch of Glory, Superior
to all the People in the World.</P>
<P>Your Councils especially, when blest from Heaven, <HI>as now we
trust they are,</HI> with Principles of Unanimity and Concord, can
never fail to make Trade Flourish, War Successful, Peace cer∣tain,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Wealth flowing, Blessings probable, the Queen Glorious,
and the People Happy.</P>
<P>Our unhappy Neighbours of the <HI>Low Countries</HI> were the very
Reverse of what we <HI>bless our selves for in You.</HI></P>
<P>Their Kings were Tyrants, their Governours Persecutors, their
Armies Thieves and Blood-hounds.</P>
<P>Their People Divided, their Councils Confus'd, and their Mi∣series
Innumerable.</P>
<P><HI>D'Alva</HI> the <HI>Spamish</HI> Governor, Besieg'd their Cities, Deeimated
the Inhabitants, Murther'd their Nobility, Proscrib'd their Princes
and Executed 18000 Men by the Hand of the Hang-man.</P>
<P>Conscience was trampl'd under foot, Religion and Reformati∣on
hunted like a Hare upon the Mountains, the Inquisition threat∣ned,
and Foreign Armies introduc'd.</P>
<P>Property fell a Sacrifice to Absolute Power, the Countrey was
Ravag'd, the Towns Plunder'd, the Rich Consiscated, the Poor
Starv'd, Trade Interrupted, and the <HI>10th.</HI> Penny demanded.</P>
<P>The Consequence of this was, <HI>as in all Tyrannies and Persecuti∣ons
it is,</HI> the People fled and scatter'd themselves in their Neigh∣bours
Countries, Trade languish'd, Manufactures went abroad,
and never returne'd, Confusion reign'd, and Pover<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y succeeded.</P>
<P>The Multitude that remain'd, push'd to all Extremities, were
forc'd to obey the Voice of Nature, and in their own just Defence
to take Arms against their Governours.</P>
<P><HI>Destruction it self has its uses in the World,</HI> the Ashes of one Ci∣ty
Rebuilds another, and God Almighty, who never acts in vain,
brought the Wealth of <HI>England,</HI> and the Power of <HI>Holland</HI> into
the World from the Ruine of the <HI>Flemish Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> in defence of their Liberty revolted, renounc'd
their Tyrant Prince, and prosper'd by Heaven and the Assistance
of <HI>England,</HI> erected the greatest Com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion-wealth in the World.</P>
<P>Innumerable Observations would flow from this part of the
present Subject, but Brevity is my study, I am not teaching, for
I know who I speak to, but relating and observing the Connex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣on
of Causes, and the wonderous Births which <HI>lay then</HI> in the
Womb of Providence, and are since come to life.</P>
<P>Particulary how Heaven directed the Oppression and Tyranny
of the Poor should be the Wheel to turn over the great Machine
of Trade from <HI>Flanders</HI> into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
And how the Persecution and Cruelty of the <HI>Spiniards</HI> against
Religion should be directed by the secret Over-ruling Hand, to be
the Foundation of a People, and a Body that should in Ages then
to come, be one of the chief Bulwarks of that very Liberty and
Religion they sought to destroy.</P>
<P>In this general Ruine of Trade and Liberty, <HI>England</HI> made
a Gain of what she never yet lost, and of what she has since en∣creas'd
to an inconceivible Magnitude.</P>
<P>As <HI>D'Alva</HI> worried the poor <HI>Flemings,</HI> the Queen of <HI>England</HI> en∣tertain'd
them, cherish'd them, invited them, encourag'd them.</P>
<P>Thousands of innocent People fled from all Parts from the Fu∣ry
of this Merciless Man, and as <HI>England, to her Honour</HI> has al∣ways
been the Sanctuary of her distress'd Neighbours, so now
she was so to her special and particular Profit.</P>
<P>The Queen who saw the Opportunity put into her hands which she
had so long wish'd for, not only receiv'd kindly the Exil'd <HI>Flemings,</HI>
but invited over all that would come, promising them all possible
Encouragement, Priviledges and Freedom of her Ports and the like.</P>
<P>This brought over a vast multitude of <HI>Flemings, Walloons,</HI>
and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who with their whole Families settled at <HI>Norwich,</HI> at
<HI>Ipswich, Colchester, Canterbury, Exeter,</HI> and the like. From these
came the <HI>Walloon</HI> Church at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Churches
<HI>Norwich, Colchester</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth;</HI> from hence came the True
born <HI>English</HI> Families at those Places with Foreign Names; as
the <HI>De Vinks</HI> at <HI>Norwich,</HI> the <HI>Rebows</HI> at <HI>Colchester,</HI> the Papilons,
&amp;c. at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Families to whom this Nation are much in
debt for the first planting those Manufactures, from which we
have since rais'd the greatest Trades in the World.</P>
<P>This wife Queen knew that number of Inhabitants are the
Wealth and Strength of a Nation, she was far from that Opinion,
we have of late shown too much of in complaining that Foreigners
came to take the Bread out of our Mouths, and ill treating on
that account the <HI>French</HI> Protestants who fled hither for Refuge in
the late Persecution.</P>
<P>Some have said that above 50000 of them settled here, and
would have made it a Grievance, tho' without doubt 'tis easie to
make it appear that 500000 more would be both useful and pro∣fitable
to this Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Upon the setling of these Forreigners, the Scale of Trade visi∣bly
turn'd both here and in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Flemings</HI> taught our Women and Children to Spin, the
Youth to Weave, the Men entred the Loom to labour instead of
going abroad to seek their Fortunes by the War, the several
Trades of <HI>Bayes</HI> at <HI>Colchester, Sayes</HI> and <HI>Perpets,</HI> at <HI>Sudbury,
Ipswich,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Stuffs</HI> at <HI>Norwich, Serges</HI> at <HI>Exeter, Silks</HI> at <HI>Canterbu∣ry,</HI>
and the like, began to flourish. All the Counties round felt
the Profit, the Poor were set to Work, the Traders gain'd Wealth,
and Multitudes of People flock'd to the several Parts where these
Manufactures were erected for Employment, and the Growth of
<HI>England,</HI> both in Trade, Wealth and People since that time, as it
is well known to this Honourable House; so the Causes of it ap∣pear
to be plainly the Introducing of these Manufactures, and no∣thing
else.</P>
<P>Nor was the Gain made here by it more visible than the loss to
the <HI>Flemings,</HI> from hence, and not as is vainly suggested from
the building the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fort of <HI>Lilto</HI> on the <HI>Scheld,</HI> came the De∣cay
of that flourishing City of <HI>Antwerp.</HI> From hence it is plain
the <HI>Flemings,</HI> an Industrious Nation, finding their Trade ruin'd
at once, turn'd their Hands to other things, as making of <HI>Lace,
Linnen,</HI> and the like, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> to the Sea Affairs and Fish∣ing.</P>
<P>From hence they become <HI>Poor,</HI> thin of People, and <HI>weak</HI> in
Trade, the Flux both of their Wealth and Trade, running
wholly into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I humbly crave leave to lay, this long Introduction shall not be
thought useless, when I shall bring it home by the Process of these
Papers to the Subject now in hand, <HI>viz. The Providing for and
Employing the Poor.</HI></P>
<P>Since the Times of <HI>Queen Elizabeth</HI> this Nation has gone on to
a Prodigy of Trade, of which the Encrease of our Customs
from 400000 Crowns to two Millions of Pounds Sterling, <HI>per Ann.</HI>
is a Demonstration beyond the Power of Argument; and that this
whole Encrease depends upon, and is principally occasion'd by the
encrease of our Manufactures is so plain, I shall not take up any
room here to make it out.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Having thus given an Account how we came to be a rich, flou∣rishing
and populous Nation, I crave leave as concisely as I can to
examine how we came to be Poor again, if it must be granted that
we are so.</P>
<P>By Poor here I humbly desire to be understood, not that we
are a poor Nation in general; I should undervalue the bounty of
Heaven to <HI>England,</HI> and act with less Understanding than most
Men are Masters of, if I should not own, that in general we are <HI>as
Rich a Nation</HI> as any in the World; but by Poor I mean burthen'd
with a crowd of clamouring, unimploy'd, unprovided for poor
People, who make the Nation uneasie, burthen the Rich, clog our
Parishes, and make themselves worthy of Laws, and peculiar
Management to dispose of and direct them how these came to be
thus is the Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stion.</P>
<P>And first I humbly crave leave to lay these Heads down as
fundamental Maxims, which I am ready at any time to Defend
and make out.</P>
<P>1. There is in <HI>England</HI> more Labour than Hands to perform it, and
consequently a want of People, not of Employment.</P>
<P>2. No Man in <HI>England,</HI> of sound Limbs and Senses, can be Poor meer∣ly
for want of Work.</P>
<P>3. All our Work-houses, Corporations and Charities for employing the
Poor, and setting them to Work, as now they are employ'd, or any
Acts of Parliament to empower Overseers of Parishes, or Parishes
themselves, to employ the Poor, except as shall be hereafter excepted,
are, and will be publick Nausances, Mischiefs to the Nation which
serve to the Ruin of Families, and the Encrease of the Poor.</P>
<P>4. That 'tis a Regulation of the Poor that is wanted in <HI>England,</HI> not
a setting them to Work.</P>
<P>If after these things are made out, I am enquir'd of what this
Regulation should be, I am no more at a loss to lay it down than I
am to affirm what is above; and shall always be ready, when call'd
to it, to make such a Proposal to this Honourable House, as with
their Concurrence shall for ever put a stop to Poverty and Beg∣gery,
Parish Charges, Assessments and the like, in this Nation.</P>
<P>If such offers as these shall be slighted and rejected, I have the
Satisfaction of having discharg'd my Duty, and the Consequence
must be, that complaining will be continued in our Streets.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
'Tis my misfortune, that while I study to make every Head so
concise, as becomes me in things to be brought before so Honoura∣ble
and August an Assembly, I am oblig'd to be short upon Heads
that in their own Nature would very well admit of particular Vo∣lumes
to explain them.</P>
<P>1. I affirm, <HI>That in</HI> England <HI>there is more Labour than Hands
to perform it.</HI> This I prove,</P>
<P><HI>Ist.</HI> From the dearness of Wages, which in <HI>England</HI> out goes
all Nations in the World; and <HI>I know no greater Demonstration in
Trade.</HI> Wages, like Exchanges, Rise and Fall as the Remitters
and Drawers, the Employers and the Work-men, Ballance one
another.</P>
<P>The Employers are the Remitters, the Work-men are the Draw∣ers,
if there are more Employers than Work-men, the price of
Wages must Rise, because the Employer wants that Work to be
done more than the Poor Man wants to do it, if there are more
Work-men than Employers the price of Labour falls, because the
Poor Man wants his Wages more than the Employer wants to
have his Business done.</P>
<P>Trade, like all Nature, most obsequiously obeys the great Law
of Cause and Consequence; and this is the occasion why even all
the greatest Articles of Trade follow, and as it were pay Homage
to this seemingly Minute and Inconsiderable Thing, <HI>The poor
Man's Labour.</HI></P>
<P>I omit, with some pain, the many very useful Thoughts that
occur on this Head, to preserve the Brevity I owe to the Dignity
of that Assembly I am writing to. But I cannot but Note how
from hence it appears, that the Glory, the Strength, the Riches,
the Trade, and all that's valuable in a Nation, as to its Figure in
the World, depends upon the Number of its People, be they ne∣ver
so mean or poor; the consumption of Manufacturers encreases
the Manufacturers; the number of Manufacturers encreases the
Consumption; Provisions are consum'd to feed them, Land Im∣prov'd,
and more Hands employ'd to furnish Provision: All the
Wealth of the Nation, and all the Trade is produc'd by Num∣bers
of People; but of this by the way.</P>
<P>The price of Wages not only determines the Difference between
the Employer and the Work-man, but it rules the Rates of every
Market. If Wages grows high, Provisions rise in Proportion, and
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
I humbly conceive it to be a mistake in those People, who say La∣bour
in such parts of <HI>England</HI> is cheap because Provisions are cheap,
but 'tis plain, Provisions are cheap there because Labour is cheap,
and Labour is cheaper in those Parts than in others; because being
remoter from <HI>London</HI> there is not that extraordinary Disproportion
between the Work and the Number of Hands; there are more
Hands, and consequently Labour cheaper.</P>
<P>'Tis plain to any observing Eye, that there is an equal plenty
of Provisions in several of our South and Western Counties, as in
<HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and rather a greater, and I believe I could make it out,
that a poor labouring Man may live as cheap in <HI>Kent</HI> or <HI>Sussex</HI> as in
the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham;</HI> and yet in <HI>Kent</HI> a poor Man shall earn
7 <HI>s. 10 s. 9 s.</HI> a Week, and in the North 4 <HI>s.</HI> or perhaps less; the
difference is plain in this, that in <HI>Kent</HI> there is a greater want of
People, in Proportion to the Work there, than in the North.</P>
<P>And this on the other hand makes the People of our northen
Countries spread themselves so much to the South, where Trade, War
and the Sea carrying off so many, there is a greater want of Hands.</P>
<P>And yet 'tis plain there is Labour for the Hands which remain
in the North, or else the Country would be depopulated, and the
People come all away to the South to seek Work; and even in <HI>York∣shire,</HI>
where Labour is cheapest, the People can gain more by their
Labour than in any of the Manufacturing Countries of <HI>Germany,
Italy</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> and live much better.</P>
<P>If there was one poor Man in <HI>England</HI> more than there was Work
to employ, either somebody else must stand still for him, or he
must be starv'd; if another Man stands still for him he wants a
days Work, and goes to seek it, and by consequence supplants a∣nother,
and this a third, and this Contention brings it to this;
no says the poor Man, <HI>That is like to be put out of his Work,</HI> rather
than that Man shall come in I'll do it cheaper; nay, says the other,
but I'll do it cheaper than you; and thus one poor Man wanting
but a Days work would bring down the price of Labour in a
whole Nation, for the Man cannot starve, and will work for any
thing rather than want it.</P>
<P>It may be Objected here, This is contradicted by our Number
of Beggars.</P>
<P>I am sorry to say I am oblig'd here to call begging an Employ∣ment,
since 'tis plain, if there is more Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than Hands to perform
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
it, no Man that has his <HI>Limbs</HI> and his <HI>Senses</HI> need to beg, and those
that <HI>have not</HI> ought to be put into a Condition not to want it.</P>
<P>So that begging is a meer scandal in the General, <HI>in the Able</HI> 'tis
a scandal upon their Industry, and <HI>in the Impotent</HI> 'tis a scandal
upon the Country.</P>
<P>Nay, the begging, as now practic'd, is a scandal upon our Cha∣rity,
and perhaps the foundation of all our present Grievance—How
can it be possible that any Man or Woman, who being
found in Body and Mind, may as 'tis apparent they may, have
Wages for their Work, should be so base, so meanly spirited, as
to beg an Alms for God-sake—Truly the scandal lies on our
Charity; and People have such a Notion in <HI>England</HI> of being pit∣tiful
and charitable, that they encourage Vagrants, and by a mi∣staken
Zeal do more harm than good.</P>
<P>This is a large Scene, and much might be said upon it; I shall
abridge it as much as possible—. The Poverty of <HI>England</HI> does
not lye among the craving Beggars but among poor Families,
where the Children are numerous, and where Death or Sickness
has depriv'd them of the Labour of the Father; these are the
Houses that the Sons and Daughters of Charity, if they would or∣der
it well, should seek out and relieve; an Alms ill directed may
be Charity to the particular Person, but becomes an Injury to the
Publick, and no Charity to the Nation. As for the craving Poor,
I am perswaded I do them no wrong when I say, that if they
were Incorporated they would be the richest Society in the Na∣tion;
and the reason why so many pretend to want Work is, that
they can live so well with the pretence of wanting Work, they
would be mad to leave it and Work in earnest; and I affim of my
own knowledge, when I have wanted a Man for labouring work,
and offer'd 95. <HI>per</HI> Week to strouling Fellows at my Door, they
have frequently told me to my Face, they could get more a beg∣ging,
and I once set a lusty Fellow in the Stocks for making the
Experiment.</P>
<P>I shall, in its proper place, bring this to a Method of Tryal,
since nothing but Demonstration will affect us, 'tis an easie matter
to prevent begging in <HI>England,</HI> and yet to maintain all our Impo∣tent
Poor at far less charge to the Parishes than they now are ob∣lig'd
to be at.</P>
<P>When Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had gain'd her Point as to Manufactories
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
in <HI>England,</HI> she had fairly laid the Foundation, she thereby found
out the way how every Family might live upon their own Labour,
like a wise Princess she knew 'twould be hard to force People to
Work when there was nothing for them to turn their Hands to;
but assoon as she had brought the matter to bear, and there was
Work for every body that had no mind to starve, then she apply'd
her self to make Laws to oblige the People to do this Work, and
to punish Vagrants, and make every one live by their own La∣bour;
all her Successors followed this laudable Example, and from
hence came all those Laws against sturdy Beggars, Vagabounds,
Stroulers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which had they been severely put in Execution by
our Magistrates, 'tis presum'd these Vagrant Poor had not so en∣creas'd
upon us as they have.</P>
<P>And it seems strange to me, from what just Ground we proceed
now upon other Methods, and fancy that 'tis now our Business to
find them Work, and to Employ them rather than to oblige them
to find themselves Work and go about it.</P>
<P>From this mistaken Notion come all our Work-houses and Cor∣porations,
and the same Error, with submission, I presume was
the birth of this Bill now depending, which enables every Parish
to erect the Woollen Manufacture within it self, for the employ∣ing
their own Poor.</P>
<P>'Tis the mistake of this part of the Bill only which I am en∣quiring
into, and which I endeavour to set in a true light.</P>
<P>In all the Parliaments since the Revolution, this Matter has
been before them, and I am justified in this attempt by the House
of Commons having frequently appointed Committees to receive
Proposals upon this Head.</P>
<P>As my Proposal is General, I presume to offer it to the Gene∣ral
Body of the House; if I am commanded to explain any part
of it, I am ready to do any thing that may be serviceable to this
great and noble Design.</P>
<P>As the former Houses of Commons gave all possible Encou∣ragement
to such as could offer, or but pretend to offer at
this needful thing, so the imperfect Essays of several, whether for
private or publick Benefit. I do not attempt to determine which
have since been made, and which have obtain'd the Powers and
Conditions they have desir'd, have by all their Effects demonstra∣ted
the weakness of their Design; and that they either understood
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
not the Disease, or know not the proper Cure for it.</P>
<P>The Imperfection of all these Attempts is acknowledg'd, not
only in the Preamble of this new Act of Parliament, but even in
the thing, in that there is yet occasion for any new Law.</P>
<P>And having survey'd, not the necessity of a new Act, but the
Contents of the Act which has been propos'd as a Remedy in this
Case; I cannot but offer my Objections against the Sufficiency of
the Proposal, and leave it to the Consideration of this Wise As∣sembly,
and of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>I humbly hope the Learned Gentlemen, under whose Dire∣ction
this Law is now to proceed, and by whose Order it has
been Printed, will not think himself personally concern'd in this
Case, his Endeavours to promote so good a Work, as the Re∣lief,
Employment, and Settlement of the Poor merit the Thanks
and Acknowledgment of the whole Nation, and no Man shall
be more ready to pay his share of that Debt to him than my self.
But if his Scheme happen to be something superficial, if he comes.
in among the number of those who have not search'd this Wound
to the bottom, if the Methods propos'd are not such as will either
answer his own Designs or the Nations, I cannot think my self ob∣lig'd
to dispense, with my Duty to the Publick Good, to pre∣serve
a Personal Value for his Judgment, tho' the Gentleman's
Merit be extraordinary.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as in all the Schemes I have seen laid for the Poor,
and in this Act now before your Honourable House; the general
Thought of the Proposers runs upon the Employing the Poor by
Work-houses, Corporations, Houses of Correction, and the
like, and that I think it plain to be seen, that those Proposals come
vastly short of the main Design. These Sheets are humbly laid
before you, as well to make good what is alledg'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That
all these Work-houses, &amp;c. Tend to the Encrease, and not the
Relief of the Poor, as to make an humble Tender of mean plain,
but I hope, rational Proposals for the more effectual Cure of this
grand Disease.</P>
<P>In order to proceed to this great Challenge, I humbly desire
the Bills already pass'd may be review'd, the Practice of our Cor∣poration
Work-houses, and the Contents of this proposed Act
examin'd.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
In all these it will appear that the Method chiefly proposed
for the Employment of our Poor, is by setting them to Work on
the several Manufactures before mention'd; as <HI>Spinning, Weaving,</HI>
and Manufacturing our <HI>English Wool.</HI></P>
<P>All our Work-houses, lately Erected in <HI>England;</HI> are in gene∣ral
thus Employ'd, for which without enumerating Particulars,
I humbly appeal to the Knowledge of the several Members of this
Honourable House in their respective Towns where such Corpo∣rations
have been erected.</P>
<P><HI>In the present Act now preparing, as Printed by Direction of
a Member of this Honourable House, it appears,</HI> that in order to
set the Poor to Work, it shall be Lawful for the Overseers of <HI>every
Town,</HI> or of one or more <HI>Towns joyn'd together to</HI> occupy any
Trade, Mystery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And raise Stocks for the carrying them on for
the setting the Poor at Work, and for the purchasing Wool, Iron,
Hemp, Flax, Thread, or other Materials for that Purpose. Vide
the Act Publish'd by Sir <HI>Humphry Mackworth.</HI></P>
<P>And that Charities given so and so, and not exceeding <HI>zool<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
per Annum</HI> for this Purpose, shall be Incorporated of Course for
these Ends.</P>
<P>In order now to come to the Case in hand, <HI>it is necessary to
premise,</HI> that the thing now in debate is not the Poor of this or that
particular Town. The House of Commons are acting like them∣selves,
as they are the Representatives of all the Commons of
<HI>England,</HI> 'tis the Care of all the Poor of <HI>England</HI> which lies be∣fore
them, not of this or that particular Body of the Poor.</P>
<P>In proportion to this great Work; I am to be understood that
these Work-houses, Houses of Correction, and Stocks to Em∣ploy
the Poor may be granted to lessen the Poor in this or that
particular part of <HI>England;</HI> and we are particularly told of that
at <HI>Bristol,</HI> that it has been such a Terror to the Beggars that none
of the stouling Crew will come near the City. But all this al∣low'd,
in general, 'twill be felt in the main, and the end will be
au Encrease of our Poor.</P>
<P>1. The Manufactures that these Gentlemen Employ the Poor
upon, are all such as are before exercis'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>2. They are all such as are manag'd to a full Extent, and the
present Accidents of War and Forreign Interruption of Trade
consider'd rather beyond the vent of them than under it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
Suppose now a Work-house for Employment of Poor Children,
sets them to spinning of Worsted.—For every Skein of Worsted
these Poor Children Spin, there must be a Skein the less Spun by
some poor Family or Person that spun it before; suppose the Ma∣nufacture
of making Bays to be erected in <HI>Bishopsgate-street,</HI> unless
the Makers of these Bays can at the same time find out a Trade or
Consumption for more Bays than were made before. For every
piece of Bays so made in <HI>London</HI> there must be a Piece the less made
at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P>I humbly appeal to the Honourable House of Commons what
this may be call'd, and with submission, I think it is nothing at all
to Employing the Poor, since 'tis only the transposing the Manu∣facture
from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>London,</HI> and taking the Bread out of
the Mouths of the Poor of <HI>Essex</HI> to put it into the Mouths of the
I'cor of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P>If these worthy Gentlemen, who show themselves so commen∣dably
forward to Relieve and Employ the Poor, will find out some
new Trade, some new Market, where the Goods they make shall
be sold, where none of the same Goods were sold before; if they
will send them to any place where they shall not interfere with the
rest of that Manufacture, or with some other made in <HI>England,</HI>
then indeed they will do something worthy of themselves, and
may employ the Poor to the same glorious Advantage as Queen
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> did, to whom this Nation, as a trading Country, owes
its peculiar Greatness.</P>
<P>If these Gentlemen could establish a Trade to <HI>Muscovy</HI> for <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Serges, or obtain an Order from the <HI>Czar,</HI> that all his Sub∣jects
should wear Stockings who wore none before, every poor
Child's Labour in Spining and Knitting those Stockings, and all the
Wool in them would be clear gain to the Nation and the general
Stock would be improved by it, because all the growth of our
Country, and all the Labour of a Person who was Idle before, is
so much clear Gain to the General Stock.</P>
<P>If they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Employ the Poor in some Manufacture which was
no. made in <HI>England</HI> before, or not bought with some. Manufacture
made here before, then they offer at something extraordinary.</P>
<P>But to set Poor People at Work, on the same thing which o∣ther
poor People were employ'd on before, and at the same time
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Consumption, is giving to one what you take
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
away from another; enriching one poor Man to starve another,
putting a Vagabond into an honest Man's Employment, and put∣ting
his Diligence on the Tenters to find out some other Work to
maintain his Family.</P>
<P>As this is not at all profitable, so <HI>with Sabmission for the Expres∣sion,</HI>
I cannot say 'tishonest, because 'tis transplanting and carry∣ing
the poor Peoples Lawful Employment from the Place where
was their Lawful Settlement, and the hardship of this <HI>our Law
consider'd</HI> is intolerable. For Example.</P>
<P>The Manufacture of making Bays is now Establish'd at <HI>Col∣chester</HI>
in <HI>Essex,</HI> suppose it should be attempted to be Etected in
<HI>Middlesex,</HI> as a certain Worthy and Wealthy Gentleman near
<HI>Hackney</HI> once propos'd, it may be suppos'd if you will grant the
Skill in Working the same, and the Wages the same, that they
must be made cheaper in <HI>Middlesex</HI> than in <HI>Essex,</HI> and cheapness
certainly will make the Merchant buy here rather than there, and
so in time all the Bay making at <HI>Colchester</HI> Dyes, and the Staple
for that Commodity is temov'd so <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>What must the Poor of <HI>Colchester</HI> do, there they buy a Paro∣chial
Settlement, those that have numerous Families cannot fol∣low
the Manufacture and come up to <HI>London,</HI> for our Parochial
Laws Impower the Church wardens to refuse them a Settlement,
so that they are consin'd to their own Countrey, and the Bread
taken out of their Mouths, and all this to feed Vegabonds, and
to set them to Work, who by their choice would be idle, and
who merit the Correction of the Law.</P>
<P>There is another Grievance which I shall endeavour to touch at,
which every Man that wishes well to the Poor does not foresee, and
which, with humble Submission to the Gentlemen that contriv'd
this Act, I see no notice taken of.</P>
<P>There are Arcanas in Trade, which though they are the Na∣tural
Consequences of Time and casual Circumstances, are yet
become now so Essential to the Publick Benefit, that to alter or
disorder, them would be an irreparable Damage to the Publick.</P>
<P>I shall explain my self as concisely as I can.</P>
<P>The Manufactures of <HI>England</HI> are happily settled in different
Corners of the Kingdom, from whence they are mutually con∣vey'd
by a Circulation of Trade to <HI>London</HI> by Wholesale, like the
Blood to the Heart, and from thence disperse in lesser quantities
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
to the other parts of the Kingdom by Retail. For Example.</P>
<P>Serges are made at <HI>Exeter, Taunton,</HI> &amp;c. Stuffs at <HI>Norwich; Bays,
Sayes, Shaloons,</HI> &amp;c. at <HI>Colchester, Bocking, Sudbury,</HI> and Parts adjacent,
Fine Cloath in <HI>Somerset, Wilts, Gloucester</HI> and <HI>Wer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e stershire,</HI> Course
Cloath is <HI>Torkshire, Kent, Surry,</HI> &amp;c. Druggets at <HI>Farnham, New∣bury,</HI>
&amp;c. All these send up the Gross of their Quantity to <HI>London,</HI>
and receive each others Sorts in Retail for their own use again.
<HI>Norwich</HI> Buys <HI>Exeter</HI> Serges, <HI>Exeter</HI> Buys <HI>Norwich</HI> Stuffs; all at
<HI>London, Yorkshire</HI> Buys Fine Cloths, and <HI>Gloucester</HI> Course, still at
<HI>London;</HI> and the like, of a vast Variety of our Manufactures.</P>
<P>By this Exchange of Manufactures abundance of Trading Fa∣milies
are maintain'd by the Carriage and Re-carriage of Goods,
vaft number of Men and Cattle are employed, and numbers of
Inholders, Victuallers, and their Dependencies subsisted.</P>
<P>And on this account I cannot but observe to your Honours, and
'tis well worth your Consideration, that the already Transposing
a vast Woollen Manufacture from several Parts of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
is a manifeft detriment to Trade in general, the several Wool.
len Goods now made in <HI>Spittlesields,</HI> where within this few Years
were none at all made, has already visibly affected the several Parts,
where they were before made, as <HI>Norwich, Sudbury, Farnham,</HI>
and other Towns, many of whose Principal Tradesmen are now
remov'd hither, employ their Stocks here, employ the Poor here,
and leave the Poor of those Countries to shift for Work.</P>
<P>This Breach of the Circulation of Trade must necessarily Di∣temper
the Body, and I crave leave to give an Example or two.</P>
<P>I'll presume to give an Example in Trade, which perhaps the
Gentlemen concern'd in this Bill may, without Reflection upon
their knowledge, be ignorant of.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and parts adjacent, were for some Ages
employ'd in the Manufactures of Stuffs and Stockings.</P>
<P>The Latter Trade, which was once considerable, is in a man∣ner
wholly transpos'd into <HI>London,</HI> by the vast quanties of worst∣ed
Hose Wove by the Frame, which is a Trade within this 10
Years almost wholly new.</P>
<P>Now as the knitting Frame perform that in a Day which would
otherwise employ a poor Woman eight or ten Days, by conse∣quence
a few Frames perform'd the Work of many Thousand poor
People: and the Consumption being not increased, the Effect im∣mediately
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
appear'd; so many Stockings as were made in <HI>London</HI> so
many the fewer were demanded from <HI>Norwich,</HI> till in a few Years
the Manufacture there wholly funk, the Masters there turn'd their
hands to other Business; and whereas the Hose Trade from <HI>Nor∣folk</HI>
once return'd at least 5000 <HI>s. per</HI> Week, and as some say twice
that Sum, 'tis not now worth naming.</P>
<P>'Tis in fewer Years, and near our Memory, that of <HI>Spittle-fields</HI>
Men have fallen into another branch of the <HI>Norwich</HI> Trade, <HI>viz.</HI>
making of Stuffs, Drugets, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If any Man say the People of <HI>Norfolk</HI> are yet full of Employ, and
do not Work; and some have been so weak as to make that Re∣ply,
avoiding the many other Demonstrations which could be gi∣ven,
this is past answering, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Combers of Wool in
<HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who formerly had all, or ten Parts in eleven
of their Yarn Manufactur'd in the Country, now comb their
Wool indeed, and spin the Yarn in the Country, but send vast
Quanties of it to <HI>London</HI> to be woven; will any Man question
whether this be not a Loss to <HI>Norwich;</HI> Can there be as many Wea∣vers
as before? And are there not abundance of Work-men and
Masters too remov'd to <HI>London?</HI></P>
<P>If it be so at <HI>Norwich, Canterbury</HI> is yet more a melancholy In∣stance
of it, where the Houses stand empty, and the People go
off, and the Trade dye, because the Weavers are follow'd the Ma∣nufacture
to <HI>London;</HI> and whereas there was within few Years 200
broad Looms at Work, I am well assur'd there are not 50 now
Employ'd in that City.</P>
<P>These are the Effects of transposing Manufactures, and inter∣rupting
the Circulation of Trade.</P>
<P>All Methods to bring our Trade to be manag'd by fewer hands
than it was before, are in themselves pernicious to <HI>England</HI> in gene∣ral,
as it lessens the Employment of the Poor, unhinges their
Hands from the Labour, and tends to bring our Hands to be su∣perior
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o our Employ, which as yet it is not.</P>
<P>In <HI>Dorsetshire</HI> and <HI>Somersetshire</HI> there always has been a very con∣siderable
Manufacture for Stockings, at <HI>Colchester</HI> and <HI>Sudbury</HI> for
Bayes, Sayes, &amp;c. most of the Wool these Countries use is bought
at <HI>London,</HI> and carried down into those Counties, and then the
Goods being Manufactur'd are brought back to <HI>London</HI> to Market;
upon transposing the Manufacture as before, all the poor People
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
and all the Cattel who hitherto were Employ'd in that <HI>Voiture,</HI> are
immediately disbanded by their Country, the Inkeepers on the
Roads must Decay, so much Land lye for other uses, as the Cattle
Employ'd, Houses and Tenement on the Roads, and all their De∣pendencies
sink in Value.</P>
<P>'Tis hard to calculate what a blow it would be to Trade in ge∣neral,
should every County but Manufacture all the several sorts
of Goods they use, it would throw our Inland Trade into strange
Convulsions, which at present is perhaps, or has been, in the great∣est
Regularity of any in the World.</P>
<P>What strange Work must it then make when every Town shall
have a Manufacture, and every Parish be a Ware-house; Trade
will be burthen'd with Corporations, which are generally equally
destructive as Monopolies, and by this Method will easily be made so</P>
<P>Parish Stocks, under the Direction of Justices of Peace, may soon
come to set up petty Manufactures, and here shall all useful things
be made, and all the poorer sort of People shall be aw'd or byass'd
to Trade there only. Thus the Shop-keepers, who pay Taxes.
and are the Support of our inland Circulation, will immediately
be ruin'd, and thus we shall beggar the Nation to provide for the
Poor.</P>
<P>As this will make every Parish a Market Town, and every Hos∣pital
a Store-house, so in <HI>London,</HI> and the adjacent Parts, to which
vast quantities of the Woollen Manufacture will be thus transplan∣ted
thither, will in time too great and disproportion'd Numbers
of the People assemble.</P>
<P>Tho' the settled Poor can't remove, yet single People will strou
about and follow the Manufacturer; and thus in time such vast
numbers will be drawn about <HI>London,</HI> as may be inconvenient to the
Government, and especially Depopulating to those Countries where
the numbers of People, by reason of these Manufactures are very
considerable.</P>
<P>An eminent Instance of this we have in the present, Trade to <HI>Mu
covy,</HI> which however design'd for an Improvement to the <HI>English</HI>
Nation, and boasted of as such, appears to be Converted into a Mo∣nopoly,
and proves Injurious and Destructive to the Nation. The
Persons concern'd removing and carrying out our People to teach
that unpolish'd Nation the Improvements they are capable of</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
If the bringing the <HI>Flemings</HI> to <HI>England</HI> brought with them their
Manufacture and Trade, carrying our People abroad, especially
to a Country where the People work for little or nothing, what
may it not do towards Instructing that populous Nation in such
Manufactures as may in time tend to the destruction of our
Trade, or the reducing our Manufacture to an Abatement in Va∣lue,
which will be felt at home by an abatement of Wages, and
that in Provisions, and that in Rent of Land; and so the general
Stock sinks of Course.</P>
<P>But as this is preparing, by eminent Hands, to be laid before
this House as a Grievance meriting your Care and Concern, I
omit insisting on it here.</P>
<P>And this removing of People is attended with many Inconveni∣encies
which are not easily perceived, as</P>
<P>1. The immediate fall of the Value of all Lands in those Coun∣tries
where the Manufactures were before; for as the numbers of
People, by the Consumption of Provisions, must where ever they
encrease make Rents rise, and Lands valuable; so those People
removing, tho' the Provisions would, if possible, follow them,
yet the Price of them must fall by all that Charge they are at for
Carriage, and consequently; Lands must fall in Proportion.</P>
<P>2. This Transplanting of Families, in time, would introduce
great and new Alterations in the Countries they removed to, which
as they would be to the Profit of some Places, would be to the De∣triment
of others, and can by no means be just any more than it
is convenient; for no wise Government studies to put any Branch
of their Country to any particular Disadvantages, tho' it may be
found in the general Account in another Place.</P>
<P>If it be fair where will be Manufactures in every Parish, and that
will keep the People at home,</P>
<P>I humbly represent what strange Confusion and particular De∣triment
to the general Circulation of Trade <HI>mention'd before</HI> it must
be, to have every Parish makes its own Manufactures.</P>
<P>1. It will make our Towns and Counties independent of one
another, and put a damp to Correspondence, which all will allow
to be a great Motive of Trade in general.</P>
<P>2. It will fill us with various sorts and kinds of Manufactures,
by which our stated sorts of Goods will in time dwindle away in
Reputation, and Foreigners not know them one from another
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Our several Manufactures are known by their respective Names;
and our Serges, Bayes and other Goods, are bought abroad by the
Character and Reputation of the Places where they are made;
when there shall come new and unheard of Kinds to Market,
some better, some worse, as to besure new Undertakers will vary
in kinds, the Dignity and Reputation of the <HI>English</HI> Goods abroad
will be lost, and so many Confusions in Trade must follow, as are
too many to repeat.</P>
<P>3. Either our Parish-stock must sell by Wholesale or by Retail,
or both; If the first 'tis doubted they will make sorry work of it,
and having other Business of their own make but poor Merchants;
it by Retail, then they turn Pedlars, will be a publick nusance
to Trade, and at last quite ruin it.</P>
<P>4. This will ruin all the Carriers in <HI>England,</HI> the Wool will be
all Manufactured where it is sheer'd, every body will make their
own Cloaths, and the Trade which now lives by running thro'
a multitude of Hands, will go then through so few, that thousands
of Families will want Employment, and this is the only way to
reduce us to the Condition spoken of, to have more Hands than
Work.</P>
<P>'Tis the excellence of our <HI>English</HI> Manufacture, that it is so plant∣ed
as to go thro' as many Hands as 'tis possible; he that contrives
to have it go thro' sever, ought at the same time to provide Work
for the rest—As it is it Employs a great multitude of People, and
can employ more; but if a considerable number of these People
be unhing'd from their Employment, it cannot but be detrimen∣tal
to the whole.</P>
<P>When I say we could employ more People in <HI>England,</HI> I do not
mean that we cannot do our Work with those we have, but I
mean thus:</P>
<P>First, It should be more People brought over from foreign Parts.
I do not mean that those we have should be taken from all com∣mon
Employments and put to our Manufacture; we may une∣qually
dispose of our Hands, and so have too many for some
Works, and too few for others; and 'tis plain that in some parts of
<HI>England</HI> it is so, what else can be the reason, why in our Southern
Parts of <HI>England, Kent</HI> in particular, borrows 20000 People of
other Counties to get in her Harvest.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
But if more Forreigners came among us, if it were 2 Millions
it could do us no harm, because they would consume our Provi∣sions,
and we have Land enough to produce much more than we
do, and they would consume our Manufactures, and we have
Wool enough for any Quantity.</P>
<P>I think therefore, with submission, to erect Manufactures in e∣very
Town to transpose the Manufactures from the settled places
into private Parishes and Corporations, to parcel out our Trade to
every Door, it must be ruinous to the Manufacturers themselves,
will turn thousands of Families out of their Employments, and
take the Bread out of the Mouths of diligent and industrious Fami∣lies
to feed Vagrants, Thieves and Beggars, who ought much ra∣ther
to be compell'd, by Legal Methods, to seek that Work which
it is plain is to be had; and thus this Act will instead of setting and
relieving the Poor, encrease their Number, and starve the best
of them.</P>
<P>It remains now, according to my first Proposal Page 9. to con∣sider
from whence proceeds the Poverty of our People, what Ac∣cident,
what Decay of Trade, what want of Employment, what
strange Revolution of Circumstances makes our People Poor, and
consequently Burthensom, and our Laws Deficient, so as to make
more and other Laws Requisite, and the Nation concerned to ap∣ply
a Remedy to this growing Disease. I Answer.</P>
<P>1. Not for want of Work; and besides what has been said on
that Head, I humbly desire these two things may be consider'd.</P>
<P>First, 'Tis apparent, That if one Man, Woman, or Child, can
by his, or her Labour, earn more Money than will subsist one
body, there must consequently be no want of Work, since any
Man would Work for just as much as would supply himself rather
than starve—What a vast difference then must there be between
the Work and the Work-men, when 'tis now known that in <HI>Spit∣tle-fields,</HI>
and other adjacent parts of the City, there is nothing
more frequent than for a journey-man Weaver, of many sorts, to
gain from 155. to 305. <HI>per</HI> Week Wages, and I appeal to the Silk
Throwsters, whether they do not give 85. 95. and 105. <HI>per</HI> Week
to blind Men and Cripples, to turn Wheels, and do the meanelt
and most ordinary Works.</P>

<P>Why are the Families of these Men starv'd, and their Children
in Work-houses, and brought up by Charity: I am ready to pro∣duce
to this Honourable House the Man who for several Years
has gain'd of me by his handy Labour at the mean scoundrel Em∣ployment

Malefactors, and the Mint and Prisons for Debiors, the War is an
Employment of Honour, and suffers some scandal in having Men
taken from the Gallows, and immediately from Villains and House∣breakers
made Gentlemen Soldiers. If Men wanted Employ∣ment,
and consequently Bread, this could never be, any Man
would carry a Musquet rather than starve, and wear the
Queens Cloth, or any Bodies Cloth, rather than go Naked,
and live in Rags and want; 'tis plain the Nation is full of
People, and 'tis as plain our People have no particular aversion
to the War, but they are not poor enough to go abroad; 'tis Po∣verty
makes Men Soldiers, and drives crowds into the Armies, and
the Difficulties to get <HI>English</HI>-men to List is, because they live in
Plenty and Ease, and he that can earn 205. <HI>per</HI> Week at an easie,
steady Employment, must be Drunk or Mad when he Lists for
a Soldier, to be knock'd o'th'Head for 35. <HI>6d. per</HI> Week; but if
there was no Work to be had, if the Poor wanted Employment,
if they had not Bread to eat, nor knew not how to earn it, thou∣sands
of young lusty Fellows would fly to the Pike and Musquet,
and choose to dye like Men in the Face of the Enemy, rather
than lye at home, starve, perish in Poverty and Distress.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
From all these Particulars, and innumerable unhappy Instances
which might be given, 'tis plain, the Poverty of our People
which is so burthensome, and increases upon us so much, does not
arise from want of proper Employments, and for want of Work,
or Employers, and consequently,</P>
<P>Work-houses, Corporations, Parish-stocks, and the like, to
set them to Work, as they are P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnicious to Trade, Imurions
and Impoverishing to those already employ'd, so they are need∣less,
and will come short of the End propos'd.</P>
<P>The Poverty and Exigence of the Poor in <HI>England,</HI> is plainly
deriv'd from one of these two particular Causes,</P>
<Q>Casualty <HI>or</HI> Crime.</Q>
<P>By Casualty, I mean Sickness of Families, loss of Limbs or
Sight, and any, either Natural or Accidental Importance as to
Labour.</P>
<P>These as Infirmities meerly Providential are not at all con∣cern'd
in this Debate; ever were, will, and ought to be the Charge
and Care of the Respective Parishes where such unhappy People
chance to live, nor is there any want of new Laws to make Pro∣vision
for them, our Ancestors having been always careful to
do it.</P>
<P>The Crimes of our People, and from whence their Poverty
derives, as the visible and direct Fountains are,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Luxury.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Sloath.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Pride.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Good Husbandry is no <HI>English</HI> Vertue, it may have been
brought over, and in some Places where it has been planted it has
thriven well enough, but 'tis a Forreign Species, it neither loves,
nor is belov'd by an <HI>English-man;</HI> and 'tis observ'd, nothing is
so 'universally hated, nothing treated with such a general Con∣tempt
as a Rich Covetous Man, tho' he does no Man any Wrong,
only saves his own, every Man will have an ill word for him, if a
Misfortune happens to him, hang him a coverous old Rogue,
'tis no Matter, he's Rich enough, nay when a certain great
Man's House was on Fire, I have heard the People say one to a∣nother,
let it burn and 'twill, he's a covetous old miserly Dog, I
wo'nt trouble my head to help him, he'd be hang'd before he'd
give us a bit of Bread if we wanted it.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Tho this be a Fault, yet I observe from it something of the
natural Temper and Genius of the Nation, generally speaking,
they cannot save their Money.</P>
<P>'Tis generally said the <HI>English</HI> get Estates, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> save
them; and this observation I have made between Forreigners
and <HI>English-men,</HI> that where an <HI>English-man</HI> earns 20 <HI>s. per</HI> Week,
and <HI>but just lives,</HI> as we call it, a <HI>Dutch-man</HI> grows Rich, and
leaves his Children in very good Condition; where an <HI>English</HI> la∣bouring
Man with his <HI>9s. per</HI> Week lives wretchedly and poor,
a <HI>Dutch-man</HI> with Wages will live very to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erably well, keep
the Wolf from the Door, and have every thing handsome about
him. In short, he will be Rich with the same Gain as makes
the <HI>English-man</HI> poor, he'll thrive when the other goes in Rags,
and he'll live when the other starves, or goes a begging.</P>
<P>The Reason is plain, a Man with good Husbandry, and
Thought in his Head, brings home his Earnings honestly to his
Family, commits it to the Management of his Wife, or otherwise
disposes it for proper Subsistance, and this Man with mean Gains
lives comfotably, and brings up a Family, when a single Man
getting the same Wages, Drinks it away at the Ale-house, thinks
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot of to morrow, layes up nothing for Sickenss, Age, or Disafter,
and when any of these happen he's starv'd, and a Beggar.</P>
<P>This is so apparent in every place, that I think it needs no Ex∣plication;
that <HI>Englsh</HI> Labouring Peoplo eat and drink, but especi∣ally
the latter three times as much in velue as any sort of Forreig∣ners
of the same Dimensions in the World.</P>
<P>I am not Writing this as a Satyr on our People, 'tis a sad Truth;
and Worthy the, Debate and Application of the Nations Phy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians
Assembled in Parliament, the prosuse Extravagant Humour of our
poor People in eating and drinking, keeps them low, causes their
Children to be left naked and starving, to the care of the Parishes,
whenever either Sickness or Disaster befalls the Parent.</P>
<P>The next Article is their <HI>Sloath.</HI></P>
<P>We are the most <HI>Lazy Diligent</HI> Nation in the World, vast
Trade, Rich Manufactures, mighty Wealth, universal Corre∣spondence
and happy Success has been constant Companions of
<HI>England,</HI> and given us the Title of an Industrious People, and so,
in general we are.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
But there is a general Taint of Slothfulness upon our Poor, there's
nothing more frequent, than for an <HI>English-man</HI> to Work till he
has got his Pocket full of Money, and then go and be idle, <HI>or
perhaps drunk,</HI> till 'tis all gone, and perhaps himself in Debt; and
ask him in his Cups what he intends, he'll tell you honestly, he'll
drink as long as it lasts, and then go to work for more.</P>
<P>I humbly suggest this Distemper's so General, so Epidemick,
and so deep Rooted in the Natured and Genius of the <HI>English,</HI> that
I much doubt it's being easily redress'd, and question whether it
be possible to reach it by an Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>This is the Ruine of our Poor, the <HI>Wife mourns,</HI> the Children
<HI>starves,</HI> the Husband <HI>has Work before him,</HI> but lies at the Ale∣house,
or otherwise <HI>idles away</HI> his time, and won't Work.</P>
<P>'Tis the Men that <HI>wont work,</HI> not the Men that <HI>can get no work,</HI>
which makes the numbers of our Poor; all the Work-houses in
<HI>England,</HI> all the Overseers setting up Stocks and Manufactures
won't reach this Case; and I humbly presume to say, if these two
Articles are remov'd, there will be no need of the other.</P>
<P>I make no Difficulty to promise on a short Summons, to pro∣duce
above a Thousand Families in <HI>England,</HI> within my particu∣lar
knowledge, who go in Rags, and their Children wanting
Bread, whose Fathers can earn their 15 to <HI>25s.</HI> per Week, but
will not work, who may have Work enough, but are too idle to
seek after it, and hardly vouchsase to earn any thing more than
bare Subsistance, and Spending Money for themselves.</P>
<P>I can give an incredible number of Examples in my own
Knowledge among our Labouring Poor. I once paid 6 or 7 Men
together on a <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, the least <HI>10s.</HI> and some <HI>30s.</HI> for
Work, and have seen them go with it directly to the Ale-house,
lie there till <HI>Monday,</HI> spend it every Penny, and run in Debt to
boot, and not give a Farthing of it to their Families, tho' all of
them had Wives and Children.</P>
<P>From hence comes Poverty, Parish Charges, and Beggary, if e∣ver
one of these Wretches falls sick, all they would ask was a
Passto the Parish they liv'd at, and the Wife and Children to the
Door a Begging.</P>
<P>If this Honourable House can find out a Remedy for this part of
the Mischief; if such Acts of Parliament may be made as may ef∣fectually
cure the Sloth and Luxury of our Poor, that shall make
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
Drunkards take care of Wife and Children, spendthrifts, lay up
for a <HI>met Day;</HI> Idle, Lazy Fellows Diligent; and Thoughtless
So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish Men, Careful and Provident.</P>
<P>If this can be done, I presume to say there will be no need of
transf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mag and confounding our Manufactures, and the Circulati∣on
of our Trade; they will soon find work enough, and there will
soon be less Poverty among us, and if this cannot be done, seeting
them to work upon Woolen Manufactures, and thereby encroach∣ing
upon those that now work at them, will but ruine our Trade,
and consequently increase the number of the Poor.</P>
<P>I do not presume to offer the Schemes I have now drawn of
Methods for the bringing much of this to pass, because I shall not
presume to lead a Body so August, so Wife, and so Capable as
this Honourable Assembly.</P>
<P>Phumbly submit what is here offered, as Reasons to prove the
Attempt now making msufficient; and doubt not but in your
Great Wisdom, you will find out Ways and Means to set this
Matter in a clearet Light, and on a right Foot.</P>
<P>And if this obtains on the House to examine farther into this
Matter, the Ambor humbly recommends it to their Considerate∣on
to accept, <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>half of all the Poor of this Nation,</HI> a Clause in the
room of this objected against, which shall answer the End without
this terrible Ruin to our Trade and People.</P>
