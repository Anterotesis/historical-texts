<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>WE apprehend it can be deemed no Injury to the Author of
the <HI>Three first Books</HI> of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> that we publish
this <HI>Fourth.</HI> It was found merely by Accident, in taking a Sur∣vey
of the <HI>Library</HI> of a late eminent Nobleman; but in so blot∣ted
a condition, and in so many detached pieces, as plainly
shewed it to be not only <HI>incorrect</HI> but <HI>unfinished:</HI> That the
Author of the three first Books had a design to extend and com∣plete
his Poem in this manner, appears from the Disssertation pre∣fixt
to it, where it is said, that the <HI>Design is more extensive,
and that we may expect other Episodes to complete it:</HI> And
from the Declaration in the Argument to the third Book, that
<HI>the Accomplishment of the Prophecies therein, would be the
Theme hereafter of a Greater Dunciad.</HI> But whether or no he
be the Author of this, we declare ourselves ignorant. If he be,
we are no more to be blamed for the Publication of it, than <HI>Tucca</HI>
and <HI>Varius</HI> for that of the last six books of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> tho' per∣haps
inferior to the former.</P>
<P>If any person be possessd of a more perfect Copy of this Work,
or of any other Fragments of it, and will communicate them to
the Publisher, we shall make the next Edition more complete: In
which, we also promise to insert any <HI>Criticisms</HI> that shall be pub∣lished,
if at all to the purpose, with the <HI>Names</HI> of the <HI>Authors;</HI> or
<PB REF="4"/>
any Letters sent us (tho' not to the purpose) shall yet be printed
under the Title of <HI>Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum;</HI> which, toge∣ther
with some others of the same kind (formerly laid by for that
purpose) may make no unpleasant Addition to the future Impressions
of this Poem.</P>

<PB REF="5"/>
<HEAD>THE
ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BOOK the FOURTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE Poet being, in this Book, to declare the <HI>Completion</HI> of the <HI>Prophecies</HI>
mention'd at the end of the former, makes a new <HI>Invocation,</HI> (as the
greater Poets are wont, when some high and worthy matter is to be
sung.) He shows the Goddess coming in her Majesty to destroy <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Sci∣ence,</HI>
and to substitute the <HI>Kingdom of the Dull</HI> upon earth. How she leads cap∣tive
the <HI>Sciences,</HI> and silenceth the <HI>Muses;</HI> and what they be who succeed in
their stead. All her children, by a wonderful attraction, are drawn about her;
and bear along with them also divers others, who promote her Empire by
connivance, weak resistance, or discouragement of Arts; such as Half wits,
tasteless Admirers, vain Pretenders, the Flatterers of dunces, or the Patrons of
them. All these crowd round her: one of them offering to approach her,
is driven back by a Rival, but she commends and encourages both. The first
who speak in form are the <HI>Genius's</HI> of the <HI>Schools,</HI> who assure her of their
care to advance her Cause, by confining Youth to <HI>words,</HI> and keeping them out
of the way of real Knowledge. Their Address, and her gracious Answer; with
her Charge to them and the Universities. The <HI>Universities</HI> appear by their pro∣per
Deputies, and assure her that the same method is observ'd in the pro∣gress
of Education: The speech of <HI>Aristarchus</HI> on this subject. They are
driven off by a band of young Gentlemen, return'd from <HI>Travel</HI> with their
<HI>Tutors;</HI> one of whom delivers to the Goddess, in a polite oration, an ac∣count
of the whole Conduct and Fruits of their <HI>Travels:</HI> presenting to
her at the same time a young Nobleman perfectly accomplished. She re∣ceives
him graciously and indues him with the happy quality of <HI>Want of
Shame.</HI> She sees loitering about her a number of <HI>Indolent Persons</HI> abandon∣ing
all business and duty, and dying with laziness; to whom approaches the
<PB REF="6"/>
Antiquary <HI>Annius,</HI> intreating her to make them <HI>Virtuosos</HI> and assign them over
to him: But <HI>Mummius,</HI> another Antiquary, complaining of his fraudulent
proceeding, she finds a method to reconcile their difference. Then enter a
troop of people-fantastically adorn'd, offfering her strange and exotic presents:
Amongst them, on stands forth and demands jusice on another, who had
deprived him of one of the greatest Curiosities in nature: but he justifies him∣self
so well, that the Goddess gives them both her approbation. She recom∣mends
to them to find proper employment for the <HI>Indolents</HI> before-mention'd,
in the study of Butterflies, Shells, Birds-nests, Moss, &amp;c. but with particular
caution, not to proceed beyond <HI>Trifles,</HI> to any useful or extensive views of Na∣ture,
or of the Author of Nature. Against the last of these apprehensions, she
is secur'd by a hearty Address from the <HI>Minute Philosophers</HI> and <HI>Free-thinkers,</HI>
one of whom speaks in the name of the rest. The Youth thus instructed
and principled, are delivered to her in a body by the hands of <HI>Silenus;</HI> and
then admitted to taste the Cup of the <HI>Magus</HI> her High Priest, which causes a
total oblivion of all Obligations, divine, civil, moral or rational. To these her
Adepts she sends <HI>Priests, Attendants,</HI> and <HI>Comforters,</HI> of various kinds; then
confers on them <HI>Orders</HI> and <HI>Degrees;</HI> and finally dìsmissing them with a speech,
confirms to each his <HI>Privileges,</HI> warns <HI>One</HI> in particular not to exceed them,
and concludes with a <HI>Yawn</HI> of extraordinary virtue, the effects of which are
not unfelt at this day.</P>

mistaken who imagine this Work in any wise in∣ferior
to the former, or of any other hand than
of our Poet; of which I am much more cer∣tain,
than that the <HI>Iliad</HI> itself was the Work
of <HI>Solomon,</HI> or the <HI>Batrachomuomachia</HI> of <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>

<HI>Antiquity</HI> and a <HI>Great Family,</HI> how dull, or dark

Some Critics have objected to the order here,
being of opinion that the Governor should have
the precedence before the Whore, if not before
the Pupil. But were he so placed, it might
be thought to insinuate that the Governor led
the Pupil to the Whore: And were the Pupil
placed first, he might be supposed to lead the
Governor to her. But our impartial Poet as
he is drawing their picture, represents them in
the order in which they are generally seen;
namely the Pupil between the Whore and the
Governor; but placeth the Whore first, as she
usually governs both the other. SCRIB.</P>

VER. 543. <HI>The heard with</HI> specious Miracles

place. <HI>Spe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issa Miracula</HI> (savs he) according
to Horace, were the monstrous Fables of the Cy∣clops,
Laestrygons, Scylla, &amp;c. What relation
have these to the transformation of Hares into
Larks, or of Pigeons into Toads? I sall tell
thee. The Laestryg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns spitted Men upon Spears,
as we do Larks upon Skewers: and the fair
Pigeon turned to a Toad is similar to the fair
Virgin Scylla ending in a filthy beast. But here
is the difficulty: why Pigeons in so shocking a
shape should be brought to a Table? Hares in∣deed
might be cut into Larks at a second dres∣sing,
out of frugality: Yet that seems no pro∣bable
motive, when we consider the extravagance
before-mertion'd of dissolving whole Oxen and
Boars into a small vial of Jelly; nay it is ex∣pressly
said, that <HI>all Flesh is nothing in his sight.</HI>
I have searched in Apicius, Pliny, and the Feast

<P>This good Scholiast, not being acquainted

<P>VER. 561. <HI>Some, deep Free-Masons, join the

particular concern for this silent Race: He has
here provided, that in case they will not waken

This speech of Dulness to her Sons at parting
may possibly fall short of the Readers expecta∣tion;
who may imagine the Goddness might give
them a Charge of more consequence, and from
such a Theory as is before delivered, incite them
to the practise of something more extraordina∣ry,
than to personate Running Footmen, Jockeys,
Stage Coachmen, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But if it be well consider'd, that whatever
inclination they might have to do mischief, her
sons are generally render'd harmless by their In∣ability;
and that it is the common effect of
Dulness (even in her greatest efforts) to defeat
her own design; the Poet I am persuaded will
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
be justified, and it will be allow'd that these
worthy persons, in their several ranks, do as
much as can be expected from them. And we
see he was aware of this, by singling out one
or two who aimed higher, but at the same time
tells us that their aims must be unsuccessful.</P>

<P>VER. 596. <HI>What Mortal can resist the Yawn

the conclusion of the Action, where the great
Mother composes all, in the same manner as
Minerva at the period of the Odyssey.—It
may indeed seem a very singular Epitasis of a
Poem, to end as this does, with a <HI>Great Yawn;</HI>
but we must consider it as the <HI>Yawn of a God,</HI>
and of powerful effects. Nor is it out of Na∣ture,

<P>VER. 597. <HI>Churches and Chappels,</HI> &amp;c.] The
Progress of this Yawn is judicious, natural, and
worthy to be noted. First it seizeth the
Churches and Chappels; then catcheth the
Schools, where tho' the boys be unwilling to
sleep, the Masters are not: Next Westminster-hall,
much more hard indeed to subdue, and
not totally put to silence even by the Goddess:
Then the Convocation, which tho' extreamly

the Yawn (far be it from our Author to sug∣gest
it could be lost any longer!) but it spread∣eth
at large over all the rest of the Kingdom,
to such a degree, that Palinurus himself (tho'
as incapable of sleeping as Jupiter) yet noddeth
for a moment: the effect of which, tho' ever
so momentary, could not but cause some Relax∣ation,
for the time, in all publick affairs.</P>

many years ago, and may be found in the State-Poems
of that time. So that Scriblerus is Mis∣taken,

of the Yawn are not unfelt at this day.”</P>
<P>VER. 610. <HI>Wits have short Memories.]</HI> This
seems to be the reason why the Poets, whenever
they give us a Catalogue, constantly call for

was but necessary for the Poet to say this ex∣pressly,
that Britain might not be suppos'd to be

other Nations of Europe. It had been a mon∣strous
impropriety, in such a case, to have made
any Nation keep awake, except <HI>France.</HI> But
our Poet, tho' a Satyrist, is an utter enemy to
all National Reflections. SCRIBL.</P>
<P>It is impossible to lament sufficiently the loss
of the rest of this Poem, just at the opening of
so fair a scene as the Invocation seems to promise.
It is to be hop'd however that the Poet com∣pleated
it, and that it will not be lost to poste∣rity,
if we may trust to a Hint given in one
of his Satires.</P>
