<P>THE curiosity entertained by all civilized nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I.</NOTE>
of enquiring into the exploits and adventures
of their ancestors, commonly excites a regret
that the history of remote ages should always be so much
involved in obscurity, uncertainty, and contradiction.
Ingenious men, possessed of leisure, are apt to push their
researches beyond the period in which literary monuments
are framed or preserved, without reflecting, that the hi∣story
of past events is immediately lost or disfigured when
intrusted to memory or oral tradition, and that the ad∣ventures
of barbarous nations, even if they were preserv∣ed,
could afford little or no entertainment to those born
in a more cultivated age. The convulsions of a civi∣lized

state usually compose the most instructive and most
interesting part of its history; but the sudden, violent,
and unprepared revolutions, incident to Barbarians, are
so much guided by caprice, and terminate so often in
cruelty, that they disgust us by the uniformity of their
appearance; and it is rather fortunate for letters that
they are buried in silence and oblivion. The only cer∣tain
means, by which nations can indulge their curiosity
in researches concerning their remote origin, is to consi∣der
the language, manners and customs of their ancestors,
and to compare them with those of the neighbouring na∣tions.
The fables, which are commonly employed to
supply the place of true history, ought entirely to be dis∣regarded;
and if any exception be admitted to this gene∣ral
rule, it can only be in favour of the antient Greek
fictions, which are so celebrated and so agreeable, that
they will ever be the objects of the attention of mankind.
Neglecting therefore, all traditions or rather tales con∣cerning
the more early history of Britain, we shall only
consider the state of the inhabitants, as it appeared to the
Romans on their invasion of this country: We shall
briefly run over the events, which attended the conquest
made by that empire, as belonging more to Roman than
British, story: We shall hasten thro' the obscure and un∣interesting
period of Saxon annals; And shall reserve a
more full narration for those times, when the truth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both
so well ascertained and so complete as to promise some
entertainment and instruction to the reader.</P>
<P>ALL antient writers agree in representing the first in∣habitants
of Britain as a tribe of the Gauls or Celtae,
who peopled that island from the neighbouring continent.
Their language was the same, their manners, their go∣vernment,
their superstition; varied only by those small
differences, which time or a communication with the
bordering nations must necessarily introduce. The inha∣bitants
of Gaul, especially in those parts which lye con∣tiguous
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
to Italy, had acquired, from a commerce with
their southern neighbours, some refinement in the arts,
which gradually diffused themselves northwards, and
spread but a very faint light over this island. The Greek
and Roman navigators or merchants (for there were
scarce any other travellers in those ages) brought back
the most shocking accounts of the ferocity of the people,
which they magnified, as usual, in order to excite the ad∣miration
of their countrymen. The south-east parts,
however, of Britain had already, before the age of Cae∣sar,
made the first and most requisite step towards a civil
settlement, and the Britains, by tillage and agriculture,
had there encreased to a great multitude<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Caesar, lib. 4.</NOTE>. The other
inhabitants of the island still maintained themselves by
pasturage; They were cloathed with skins of beasts:
They dwelt in huts, which they reared in the forests and
marshes, with which the country was covered: They
shifted easily their habitation, when actuated either by
the hopes of plunder or the fear of an enemy: The con∣venience
of feeding their cattle was even a sufficient mo∣tive
for removing their seats: And being ignorant of
all the refinements of life, their wants and their possessions
were equally scanty and limited.</P>
<P>THE Britains were divided into many small nations or
tribes: and being a military people, whose sole property
was their sword and their cattle, it was impossible, after
they had acquired a relish of liberty, for their princes or
chieftains to establish any despotic authority over them.
Their governments, tho' monarchical,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Diod. Sic. l. 4. Mela, lib. 3. cap. 6. Strabo, lib. 4</NOTE> were free, as
well as those of all the Celtic nations; and the common
people seem even to have enjoyed more liberty among
them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dion Cassius, lib. 75.</NOTE>, than among the nations of Gaul<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Caesar, lib. 6.</NOTE>, from whom
they were descended. Each state was divided into fac∣tions
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
within itself<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Agr.</NOTE>: It was agitated with emulation to∣wards
the neighbouring states: And while the arts of
peace were yet unknown, wars were the chief occupa∣tion,
and formed the chief object of ambition among
the people.</P>
<P>THE religion of the Britains was one of the most con∣siderable
parts of their government; and the Druids,
who were their priests, possessed great authority among
them. Besides ministring at the altar, and directing all
religious duties, they presided over the education of
youth; they were endowed with an immunity from wars
and taxes; they enjoyed both the civil and criminal juris∣diction;
they decided all controversies among states as
well as private persons, and whoever refused to submit to
their decree was exposed to the most severe penalties.
The sentence of excommunication was denounced against
him: He was forbid access to the sacrifices or public wor∣ship:
He was debarred all intercourse with his fellow-ci∣tizens,
even in the common affairs of life: His company
was universally shunned, as profane and dangerous: He
was refused the protection of law<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Caesar, lib. 6. Strabo, lib. 4.</NOTE>: And death itself be∣came
to him an acceptable relief from the misery and in∣famy
to which he was exposed. Thus, the bands of go∣vernment,
which were naturally loose among that rude
and turbulent people, were happily corroborated by the
terrors of their superstition.</P>
<P>No species of superstition was ever more terrible than
that of the Druids. Besides the severe penalties, which
it was in the power of the ecclesiastics to inflict in this
world, they inculcated the eternal transmigration of souls;
and thereby extended their authority as far as the fears of
their timorous votaries. They practised their rites in dark
groves or other secret recesses<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Plin. lib. 12. cap. 1.</NOTE>; and in order to throw a
greater mystery on their religion, they communicated
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
their doctrines only to the initiated, and strictly forbad
the committing them to writing; left they should at any
time be exposed to the examination of the profane vulgar.
Human sacrifices were practised among them: The spoils
of war were often devoted to their divinities; and they
punished with the severest tortures whoever dared to se∣crete
any part of the consecrated offering: These treasures
they preserved in woods and forests, secured by no other
guard than the terrors of their religion<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Caesar, lib. 6.</NOTE> and this conti∣nued
conquest over human avidity may be regarded as
more signal than their prompting men to the most extra∣ordinary
and most violent efforts. No idolatrous worship
ever attained such an ascendant over mankind as that of
the antient Gauls and Britains; and the Romans, after
their conquest, finding it impossible to reconcile these na∣tions
to the laws and institutions of their masters, while
it maintained its authority, were at last obliged to abolish
it by penal statutes; a violence, which had never in any
other instance been practised by these tolerating conque∣rors<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sueton. In vita Ciaudii.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The ROMANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Britains had long remained in this rude but inde∣pendant
state, when Caesar, having over-run all
Gaul by his victories, first cast his eye on their island.
He was not allured either by its riches or its renown; but
being ambitious of carrying the Roman arms into a new
world, then wholly unknown, he took advantage of a
short interval in his Gaulic wars, and made an invasion
on Britain. The natives, informed of his intention,
were sensible of the unequal contest, and endeavoured to
appease him by submissions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anno ant. C. 55.</NOTE> which, however, retarded
not the execution of his design. After some resistance,
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
he landed, as is supposed, at Deal, and having obtained
several advantages over the Britains, and obliged them to
promise hostages for their future dutiful behaviour, he
was constrained, by the necessity of his affairs, and
the approach of winter, to withdraw his forces into
Gaul. The Britains, relieved from the terror of his
arms, neglected the performance of their stipulations;
and that haughty conqueror resolved next summer to
chastise them for this breach of treaty. He landed with
a greater force; and tho' he found a more regular resist∣ance
from the Britains, who had united under Cassive∣launus,
one of their petty princes; he discomfited them
in every action. He advanced into the country; passed
the Thames in the face of the enemy; took and burned
the capital of Cassivelaunus; established his ally, Mandu∣bratius,
in the sovereignty of the Trinobantes; and ha∣ving
obliged the inhabitants to make him new submis∣sions,
he again returned with his army into Gaul, and
left the authority of the Romans more nominal than real
in this island.</P>
<P>THE civil wars, which ensued, and which prepared the
way for the establishment of monarchy in Rome, saved
the Britains from that yoke, which was ready to be im∣posed
upon them. Augustus, the successor of Caesar, con∣tent
with the victory obtained over the liberties of his
own country, was little ambitious of acquiring fame by
foreign wars; and being apprehensive left the fame un∣limited
extent of dominion, which had subverted the re∣public,
might also overwhelm, the empire, he recommended
to his successors never to enlarge the territories of
the Romans. Tiberius, jealous of the fame, which might
be acquired by his generals, made this advice of Augustus
a pretence for his inactivity<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Agr.</NOTE> The mad sallies of Ca∣ligula,
in which he menaced Britain with an invasion,
served only to expose himself and the empire to ridicule:
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
and the Britains had now, during almost a century, en∣joyed
their liberty unmolested; when the Romans, in
the reign of Claudius, began to think seriously of reducing
them under their dominion. Without seeking any more
justifiable reasons of hostility than were employed by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 43.</NOTE>
latter Europeans in subjecting the Africans and Ameri∣cans,
they sent over an army under the command of
Plautius, an able general, who gained some victories, and
made a considerable progress in subduing the inhabitants.
Claudius himself, finding affairs sufficiently prepared for
his reception, made a journey into Britain; and received
the submission of several British states, the Cantii, Atre∣bates,
Regni, and Trinobantes, who inhabited the south∣east
parts of the island, and whom their possessions and
cultivated manner of life rendered willing to purchase
peace at the expence of their liberty. The other Britains,
under the command of Caractacus, still maintained an
obstinate resistance, and the Romans made little progress
against them; till Ostorius Scapula was sent over to
command their armies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 50.</NOTE> This general advanced the Ro∣man
conquests over the Britains; pierced into the coun∣try
of the Silures, a warlike nation, who inhabited the
banks of the Severne; defeated Caractacus in a great bat∣tle;
took him prisoner, and sent him to Rome, where
his magnanimous behaviour procured him better treat∣ment
than those conquerors usually bestowed on captive
princes<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. Lib. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>NOT WITHSTANDING these misfortunes, the Britains
were not subdued; and this island was regarded by the
ambitious Romans as a field, in which military honour
might still be acquired.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 59.</NOTE> Under the reign of Nero, Sue∣tonius
Paulinus was invested with the command, and
prepared to signalize his name by victories over these bar∣barians.
Finding that the island of Mona, now Angle∣sey,
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
was the chief seat of the Druids, he resolved to at∣tack
it, and to subject a place, which was the center of
their superstition, and which afforded protection, to all
their baffled forces. The Britains endeavoured to ob∣struct
his landing on this sacred island, both by the force
of their arms and the terrors of their religion., The wo∣men
and priests were intermingled with the soldiers upon
the shore; and running about with flaming torches in
their hands, and tossing their dishevelled hair, they struck
greater terror into the astonished Romans by their howl∣ings,
cries, and execrations, than the real danger from,
the armed forces was able to inspire. But Suetonius, ex∣horting
his troops to despise the menaces of a superstition,
which they despised, impelled them to the attack, drove
the Britains off the field, burned the Druids in the fame
fires which they had prepared for their captive enemies,
destroyed all the consecrated groves and altars; and hav∣ing
thus triumphed over the religion of the Britains, he
thought his future progress would be easy in reducing the
people to subjection. But he was disappointed in his expec∣tations.
The Britains, taking advantage of his absence,
were all in arms; and being headed by Boadicea, Queen
of the Iceni, who had been treated in the most ignominy∣ous
manner by the Roman tribunes, had already attacked
with success several settlements of their insulting conquer∣ors.
Suetonius hastened to the protection of London,
which was already a flourishing Romar colony; but
found on his arrival, that it would be requisite for the ge∣neral
safety to abandon that place to the merciless fury of
the enemy. London was reduced to ashes; such of the
inhabitants, as remained in it, cruelly massacred; the
Romans and all strangers, to the number of 70,000, put
to the sword without diftinction; and the Britains, by
rendering the war thus bloody, seemed determined to cut
off all hopes of peace or compostion with the enemy. But
this cruelty was revenged by Suetonius in a great and de∣cisive
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
battle, where 80,000 of the Britains are said to have
perished; and Boadicea herself, rather than fall into the
hands of the enraged victor, put an end to her own life
by poison<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</NOTE>. Nero soon after recalled Suetonius from a
government, where by suffering and inflicting so many
severities, he was judged improper for composing the
angry and alarmed minds of the inhabitants. After some
interval, Cerealis received the command from Vespasian,
and by his bravery propagated the terror of the Roman
arms. Julius Frontinus succeeded Cerealis both in au∣thority
and reputation: But the general, who finally esta∣blished
the dominion of the Romans in this island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 78.</NOTE> was
Julius Agricola, who governed it in the reigns of Vespa∣sian,
Titus, and Domitian, and distinguished himself
in that scene of action.</P>
<P>THIS great commander formed a regular plan for sub∣duing
Britain, and rendering the acquisition useful to the
conquerors. He carried his victorious arms northwards,
defeated the Britains in every encounter, pierced into the
inaccessible forests and mountains of Caledonia, reduced
every thing to subjection in the southern parts of the
island, and chaced before him all the men of fiercer and
more intractable spirits, who deemed war and death itself
less intolerable than servitude under the victors. He even
defeated them in a decisive action, which they fought un∣der
Galcacus, their leader; and having drawn a rampart,
and fixed a train of garrisons between the friths of Clyde
and Forth, he thereby cut off the ruder and more barren
parts of the island, and secured the Roman province from
the invasion of the barbarous inhabitants<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Agr.</NOTE></P>
<P>DURING these military enterprizes, he neglected not
the arts of peace. He introduced laws and civility among
the Britains, taught them to desire and raise all the con∣veniencies
of life, reconciled them to the Roman lan∣guage
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
and manners, instructed them in letters and sci∣ence,
and employed every expedient to render those
chains, which he had forged, both easy and agreeable to
them<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Agr.</NOTE>. The inhabitants having experienced how une∣qual
their own force was to resist that of the Romans, ac∣quiesced
in the dominion of their masters, and were gra∣dually
incorporated as a part of that mighty empire.</P>
<P>THIS was the last durable conquest made by the Ro∣mans;
and Britain, once subdued, gave no farther in∣quietude
to the victor. Caledonia alone, defended by its
barren mountains, and by the contempt which the Ro∣mans
entertained of it, sometimes infested the more culti∣vated
parts of the island by the incursions of its inhabi∣tants.
The better to secure the frontiers of the empire,
Adrian, who visited this island, built a strong rampart be∣tween
Tyne and the frith of Solway: Lollius Urbicus,
under Antoninus Pius, repaired that of Agricola: Severus,
who made an expedition into Britain, and carried his
arms into the most northern extremity of it, added new
fortifications to the wall of Adrian; and during all the
reigns of the Roman emperors, such a profound tranquil∣lity
prevailed in Britain, that little mention is made of the
affairs of that island by any historian. The only inci∣dents
which occur, are some seditions or rebellions of the
Roman legions quartered there, and some usurpations of
the imperial dignity by the Roman governors. The na∣tives,
disarmed, dispirited, and submissive, had lofs all
desire and even idea of their former liberty and indepen∣dance.</P>
<P>BUT the period was now come, when that enormous
fabric of the Roman empire, which had diffused slavery
and oppression, together with peace and civility, over so,
considerable a part of the globe, was approaching towards
its final dissolution. Italy, and the center of the empire,
removed, during so many ages, from all concern in the
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
wars, had entirely lost the military spirit, and were peo∣pled
by an enervated race, equally disposed to submit to a
foreign yoke, or to the tyranny of their own rulers. The
emperors found themselves obliged to recruit their legions
from the frontier provinces, where the genius of war,
though languishing, was not totally extinct; and these
mercenary forces, careless of laws and civil institutions,
established a military government, no less dangerous to
the sovereign than to the people. The farther pro∣gress
of the same disorders introduced the bordering
barbarians into the service of the Romans; and those
fierce nations, having now added discipline and skill to
their native bravery, could no longer be restrained by the
impotent policy of the emperors, who were accustomed
to employ the one in the destruction of the other. Sen∣sible
of their own force, and allured by the prospect of so
rich a prize, the northern barbarians, in the reign of Ar∣cadius
and Honorius, assailed at once all the frontiers of
the Roman empire; and having first satiated their avidity
by plunder, began to think of fixing a settlement in the
wasted provinces. The more distant barbarians, who oc∣cupied
the deserted habitations of the former, advanced
in their acquisitions, and pressed with their incumbent
weight the Roman state, already unequal to the load
which it sustained. Instead of arming the people in their
own defence, the emperors recalled all the distant legions,
in whom alone they could repose confidence; and collect∣ed
the whole military force for the defence of the capital
and center of the empire. The necessity of self-preserva∣tion
had superceded the ambition of power; and the an∣cient
point of honour, of never contracting the limits of
the empire, could no longer be attended to in this despe∣rate
extremity.</P>
<P>BRITAIN by its situation was removed from the fury of
these barbarous incursions; and being also a remote pro∣vince,
not much valued by the Romans, the legions,
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
which defended it, were carried over to the protection of
Italy and Gaul. But that province, though secured by
the sea against the inroads of the greater tribes of barbari∣ans,
found enemies on its frontiers, who took advantage
of its present defenceless situation. The Picts and Scots,
who dwelt in the northern parts, beyond the wall of An∣toninus,
made incursions upon their peaceable and effemi∣nate
neighbours; and besides the temporary depredations
which they committed, threatened the whole province
with subjection, or, what the inhabitants more dreaded,
with plunder and devastation. The former nation seem
to have been a tribe of the native British race, who, hav∣ing
been chaced into the northern parts by the conquests
of Agricola, had there intermingled with the ancient in∣habitants:
The other were derived from the same Celtic
origin, had first been established in Ireland, had sent over
a colony to the north-west coasts of this island, and had
long been accustomed, as well from their old as their new
seats, to infest the Roman province by their pyracy and
rapine. These two tribes, finding their more opulent
neighbours exposed to invasion, soon broke over the Ro∣man
wall, no longer defended by the Roman arms; and
though a contemptible enemy in themselves, met with no
resistance from the unwarlike inhabitants. The Britains,
accustomed to have recourse to the emperors for defence
as well as government, made supplications to Rome; and
one legion was sent over for their protection. This force
was an over-match for the barbarians, repelled their inva∣sion,
routed them in every engagement, and having chaced
them into their ancient limits, returned in triumph to the
defence of the southern provinces of the empire<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Gildas, Bede, lib. 1. cap. 12. Paull. Diacon. Alured. Beverl. P. 43. ex edit. Hearne.</NOTE>. Their
retreat brought on a new invasion of the enemy. The
Britains made again an application to Rome, and ob∣tained

<HEAD>The BRITAINS.</HEAD>
<P>THE abject Britains regarded this present of liberty as
fatal to them; and were in no condition to put in
practice the prudent advice given them by the Romans,
of arming in their own defence. Unaccustomed both to
the perils of war, and to the cares of civil government,
they found themselves incapable of forming or executing
any measures for resisting the incursions of the barbarians.
Gratian also and Constantine, two Romans who had a
little before assumed the purple in Britain, had carried
over into the continent the flower of the British youth;
and having perished in their unsuccessful attempts on the
imperial throne, had despoiled the island of those, who,
in this desperate extremity, were best able to defend it.
The Picts and Scots, finding that the Romans had final∣ly
relinquished Britain, now regarded the whole as their
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
prize, and attacked the northern wall with redoubled for∣ces.
The Britains, already subdued by their own fears,
found the ramparts but a weak defence for them; and de∣serting
their station, left the country entirely open to the
inroads of the barbarous enemy. The invaders carried
devastation and ruin along with them; and exerted to the
utmost their native ferocity, which was not mitigated by
the helpless condition and submissive behaviour of the in∣habitants<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Gildas, Bede, lib. 1. Ann. Beverl. p. 45.</NOTE>
The unhappy Britains had a third time re∣course
to Rome, which had declared its resolution for ever
to abandon them. Aetius, the patrician, sustained, at
that time, by his valour and magnanimity, the tottering
ruins of the empire, and revived for a moment among the
degenerate Romans the spirit, as well as discipline of
their ancestors. The British ambassadors carried to him
the letter of their countrymen, which was inscribed, <HI>The
Groans of the Britains.</HI> The tenor of the epistle was suit∣able
to its superscription.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 448.</NOTE> <HI>The barbarians,</HI> say they, <HI>on
the one hand, chace us into the sea; the sea, on the other,
throws us back upon the barbarians; and we have only the hard
choice left us, of perishing by the sword or by the waves</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Gildas, Bede, lib. 1. cap. 13. Malmesbury, lib. 1. cap. 1. Ann. Beverl. P. 45.</NOTE>. But
Aetius, pressed by the arms of Attila, the most terrible
enemy that ever assailed the empire, had no leisure to at∣tend
to the complaints of allies, whom generosity alone
could induce him to assist<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. II. Edit. 1692.</NOTE>. The Britains, thus rejected,
were reduced to despair, deserted their habitations, aban∣doned
tillage, and flying for protection to the forests and
mountains, suffered equally from hunger and from the
enemy. The barbarians themselves began to feel the
pressures of famine in a country which they had ravaged;
and being harrassed by the dispersed Britains, who had not
dared to resist them in a body, they retreated with their
spoils into their own country<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ann. Beverl. P. 45.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23"/>
THE Britains, taking advantage of this interval, re∣turned
to their usual occupations; and the favourable sea∣sons,
which succeeded, seconding their industry, made
them soon forget all their past miseries, and restored to
them great plenty of all the necessaries of life. No more
can be imagined to have been possessed by a people so rude,
who had not, without the assistance of the Romans, art
of masonry sufficient to raise a stone rampart for their own
defence: Yet the Monkish historians<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Gildas, Bede, lib. 1. cap. 14,</NOTE> who treat of
those events, complain of the luxury of the Britains dur∣ing
this period, and ascribe to this vice, not to their
cowardice or improvident councils, all their subsequent
calamities.</P>
<P>THE Britains, entirely occupied in the enjoyment of
the present interval of peace, made no provisions for re∣sisting
the enemy, who, invited by their former timid be∣haviour,
soon threatened them with a new invasion. We
are not exactly informed what species of civil government
the Romans on their departure had left among them; but
it appears probable, that the great men in the different
districts assumed a kind of regal, though precarious au∣thority;
and lived in a great measure independant of each
other<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Gildas, Usher Ant. Brit. P. 248. 347.</NOTE> To this disunion of councils were also added the

<HEAD>The SAXONS.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the barbarous nations, known either in ancient
or modern times, the Germans seem to have been
the most distinguished both by their manners and political
institutions, and to have carried to the highest pitch the
virtues of valour and love of liberty; the only virtues
which can have place among an uncivilized people, where
justice and humanity are commonly neglected. Kingly
government, even when established among the Germans,
(for it was not universal) possessed a very limited autho∣rity;
and though the sovereign was usually chosen from
amongst the royal family, he was obliged to be directed in
every measure by the common consent of the nation,
over whom he presided. When any important affairs
were transacted, all the warriors of the nation met in
arms; the men of greatest authority employed persuasion
to engage their contsent; the people expressed their appro∣bation
by rattling their armour, or their dissent by mur∣murs;
there was no necessity for a nice scrutiny of votes
among a multitude, who were usually carried with a
strong current to one fide or the other; and the measure
thus suddenly chosen by general agreement, was execut∣ed
with alacrity, and prosecuted with vigour. Even i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
war, their princes governed more by example than by
authority: But in peace, the civil union was in a great
measure dissolved, and the inferior leaders administere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
justice, after an independant manner, each in his parti∣cular
district. These were elected by the votes of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
people in their great councils; and though regard wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
paid to nobility in the choice, their personal qualities
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
chiefly their valour, procured them from the suffrages <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
their fellow-citizens that honourable but dangerous di∣stinction.
The warriors of each tribe attached them∣selves
to their leader, with the most devoted affection and
most unshaken constancy. They attended him as his or∣nament
in peace, as his defence in war, as his council in
the administration of justice. Their constant emulation
in military renown dissolved not that inviolable friendship
which they professed to their chieftain and to each other.
To die for the honour of their band was their chief ambi∣tion:
To survive its disgrace, or the death of their lead∣er,
was infamous. They even carried into the field their
women and children, who adopted all the martial senti∣ments
of the men: And being thus impelled by every hu∣man
motive, they were invincible; where they were not
opposed, either by the similar manners and institutions of
the neighbouring Germans, or by the superior discipline,
arms, and numbers of the Romans<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Caesar. lib. Tacit. de Mor. Germ.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE leaders and their military companions “were main∣tained
by the labour of their slaves, or by that of the
weaker and less warlike part of the society, whom they
defended. The contributions, which they levied, went
not beyond a bare sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istance; and the honours, acquired
by a superior rank, were the only reward of their supe∣rior
dangers and fatigues. All the refined arts of life
were unknown among the Germans: Tillage itself was
almost wholly neglected: They seem to have been even
anxious to prevent any improvements of that nature; and
the leaders, by annually distributing anew all the land
among the inhabitants of each village, prevented them
from attaching themselves to particular possessions, or
making any such progress in agriculture as might divert
their attention from military expeditions, the chief occu∣pation
of the community<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Caesar. lib. 6. Tacit. ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="26"/>
THE Saxons had been for some time regarded as one of
the most warlike tribes of this fierce people, and had be∣come
the terror of all the neighbouring nations<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Amm. Marcell. lib. 28. Orosius.</NOTE> They
had spread themselves from the northern parts of Germa∣ny
and the Cimbrian Chersonesus, and had taken posses∣sion
of all the sea-coast from the mouth of the Rhine to
Jutland; whence they had long infested by their pyracies
all the eastern parts of Britain, and northern of Gaul<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Amm. Marcell. lib. 27. cap. 7. lib. 28. cap. 7.</NOTE>.
In order to oppose their inroads, the Romans had esta∣blished
an officer, whom they called <HI>Count of the Saxon
shore;</HI> and as the naval arts can only flourish among a
civilized people, they seem to have been more successful
in repelling the Saxons than any of the other barbarians,
by whom they were invaded. The dissolution of the Ro∣man
power invited them to renew their inroads; and it
was an acceptable circumstance, that the deputies of the
Britains appeared among them, and prompted them to un∣dertake
an enterprize, to which they were of themselves
sufficiently inclined<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Will. Malm. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENGIST and Horsa were two brothers, who possessed
great credit among the Saxons, and were much celebrat∣ed
both for their valour and nobility. They were believ∣ed,
as most of the Saxon princes, to be sprung from
Woden, who was worshipped as a god among those na∣tions,
and they are said to be his great grandsons<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 15. Saxon Chron. p. 13. Nennius, cap. 28.</NOTE> a cir∣cumstance
which added much to their authority. We
shall not attempt to trace any higher the origin of those
princes and nations. It is evident what fruitless labour it
must be to search in those barbarous and illiterate ages for
the annals of a people, when their first leaders, known in
any true history, were believed by them to be the fourth in
descent from a. fabulous deity, or from a man, exalted by
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
ignorance into that character. The dark industry of an∣tiquarians,
led by remote analogies of names, or by un∣certain
traditions, would in vain attempt to pierce into
that deep obscurity, which covers the remote history of
those nations.</P>
<P>THESE two brothers, observing the other provinces of
Germany to be occupied by a warlike and necessitous peo∣ple,
and the rich provinces of Gaul already conquered or
over-run by other German tribes, found it easy to per∣suade
their countrymen to embrace the sole enterprize,
which promised a favourable opportunity of displaying
their valour and gratifying their avidity. They embark∣ed
their troops in three vessels, and about the years 449
or 450<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Saxon Chronicle, p. 12. Gul. Malm. p. 11. Huntington, lib. 2. 309. Ethelw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd. Brompton, p. 728,</NOTE> carried over 1600 men, who landed in the isle
of Thanet, and immediately marched to the defence of
the Britains against the northern invaders. The Scots
and Picts were unable to resist the valour of these auxilia∣ries;
and the Britains, applauding their own wisdom in
calling over the Saxons, hoped thenceforth to enjoy
peace and security under the powerful protection of that
warlike people.</P>
<P>BUT Hengist and Horsa, perceiving, from their easy
victory over the Scots and Picts, with what facility they
might subdue the Britains themselves, who had not been
able to resist these feeble invaders, were determined to
conquer and fight for their own grandeur, not for the de∣fence
of their degenerate allies. They sent intelligence
to Saxony of the fertility and riches of Britain; and re∣presented
the certain conquest, which might be made over
a people, so long disused to arms, who, being now cut
off from the Roman empire, of which they were a pro∣vince
during so many ages, had not yet acquired any
union among themselves, and were devoid of all affection
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
to their new liberties, and of all national attachments and
regards<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 12. Ann. Beverl. p. 49.</NOTE>. The vices and pusillanimity of Vortigern, the
British leader, were a new ground of hopes; and the Sax∣ons
in Germany, following such agreeable prospects,
soon re-inforced Hengist and Horsa with 5000 men, who
came over in seventeen vessels. The Britains began now
to entertain apprehensions of their allies, whose numbers
they found continually augmenting; but thought of no
remedy, except in a passive submission and connivance.
This weak, expedient soon failed them. The Saxons
sought a quarrel by complaining that their subsidies were
ill paid, and their provisions withdrawn<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 15. Nennius, cap. 35. Gildas, § 23:</NOTE> And immedi∣ately
taking off the mask, they formed an alliance with
the Picts and Scots, and proceeded to open hostility
against the Britains<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 15. Gildas Saxon Chron. p. 12, 13. Ann. Beverl. p. 50.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Britains, impelled by these violent extremities, and
full of indignation against their treacherous auxiliaries,
were necessitated to take arms; and having deposed Vor∣tigern,
who had become odious from, his vices, and from
the bad event of his rash councils, they put themselves
under the command of his son, Vortimer<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Math. West. A. D. 454. Gul. Malm. p. 9.</NOTE>. They fought
many battles with their enemies; and tho' the victories in
these actions be disputed between the British and Saxon
annalists, the progress still made by the Saxons prove that
the advantage was commonly on their fide. In one bat∣tle,
however, fought at Eglesford, now Ailsford, Horsa,
the Saxon general, was flain; and left the sole command
over his countrymen in the hands of Hengist<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Math. West. A. D. 455. Saxon Chron. p. 13. Nennius, cap. 46.</NOTE>. This ac∣tive
general, continually re-inforced by fresh numbers
from Germany, carried devastation into the most remote
corners of Britain; and being chiefly anxious to spread
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
the terror of his arms, he spared neither age, nor sex, nor
condition, wherever he marched with his victorious for∣ces.
The private and public edifices of the Britains were
reduced to ashes: The priests were slaughtered on the al∣tars
by these idolatrous ravagers: The bishops and nobi∣lity
shared the fate of the vulgar: The people flying into
the mountains and deserts, were intercepted and butcher∣ed
in heaps: Some were glad to accept of life and servi∣tude
under their victors: Others, deserting their native
country, took shelter in the province of Armorica; where
being charitably received by a people of the same language
and manners, they settled in great numbers, and gave
the country the name of Brittany<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 15. U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, p. 226. Gildas, §. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE British writers assign one cause, which facilitated
the entrance of the Saxons into this island; the love,
with which Vortigern was at first seized for Rovena, the
daughter of Hengist, and which that artful warrior made
use of to blind the eyes of the imprudent monarch<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Nennius. Galfr. Lib. 6. cap. 12.</NOTE> The
same historians add, that Vortimer died; and Vortigern,
being restored to the throne, accepted of a festival from
Hengist, at Stonehenge; where 300 of his nobility were
treacherously slaughtered, and himself detained captive<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Nennius, cap. 47. Galfr.</NOTE>.
But these stories seem to have been invented by the Welsh
authors, in order to palliate the weak resistance made at
first by their countrymen, and to account for the rapid
progress and licentious devastations of the Saxons<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet's Orig. Britt. p. 324, 325.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of Vortimer, Ambrosius, a Britain,
tho' of Roman descent, was invested with the command
over his countrymen, and endeavoured, not without suc∣cess,
to unite them in their resistance against the Saxons.
These contests increased the animosity between the two
nations, and rouzed the military spirit of the ancient in∣habitants
which had before been sunk into such a fatal
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
lethargy. Hengist, however, notwithstanding their op∣position,
still kept his ground in Britain; and in order to
divide the forces and attention of the Britains, he called
over a new t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibe of Saxons under the command of his
brother Octa, and of Ebissa, the son of Octa; and he
settled them in Northumberland. He himself remained
in the southern parts of the island, and laid the founda∣tion
of the kingdom of Kent, comprehending the county
of that name, Middlesex, Essex, and part of Surrey. He
fixed his royal seat at Canterbury; where he governed
about forty years, and he died in or near the year 488;
leaving his new acquired dominions to his posterity.</P>
<P>THE success of Hengist excited the avidity of the other
inhabitants of the northern regions of Germany; and at
different times, and under different leaders, they flocked
over in multitudes to the invasion of this island. These
conquerors were chiefly composed of three tribes, the Sax∣ons,
Angles, arid Jutes<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 15. Ethelwerd, p. 833. Edit. Camdeni. Chron. Sax. p. 12. Ann. Beverl. p. 78. The inhabitants of Kent and the Is<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Wight were Jutes. Essex, Middlesex, Surrey, Sussex, and all the southern counties to Cornwal, were peopled by Saxons: Mercia and other parts of the kingdom were inhabited by Angles,</NOTE> who passed, all of them, un∣der
the common appellation, sometimes of Saxons, some∣times
of Angles; and speaking the same language, and
being governed by the same institutions, they were natu∣rally
led, from these causes, as well as from their com∣mon
interest, to unite themselves against the antient inha∣bitants.
The resistance, however unequal, was still
maintained by the Britains; but became every day more
feeble: And their misfortunes admitted of few intervals,
till they were driven into Cornwal and Wales, and re∣ceived
protection from the remote situation or inaccessible
mountains of those countries.</P>
<P>THE first Saxon state, after that of Kent, which was
established in Britain, was the kingdom of South-Saxo∣ny.
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
In the year 477<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 14. Ann. Beverl. p. 81.</NOTE>. Aella, a Saxon chieftain, brought
over an army from Germany; and landing in the south∣ern
coast, proceeded to take possession of the neighbour∣ing
territory. The Britains, now armed, abandoned not
tamely their possessions; nor were they expelled, till de∣feated
in many battles by their warlike invaders. The
most memorable action, mentioned by historians, is that
of Mearcredes-Burn<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Saxon. Chron. A. D. 485. Flor. Wigorn</NOTE>. where, tho' the Saxons seem to
have obtained the victory, they suffered so considerable a
loss, as somewhat retarded the progress of their conquests.
But Aella, re-inforced by fresh numbers of his country∣men,
again took the field against the Britains; and laid
siege to Andred-Ceaster, which was defended by the gar∣rison
and inhabitants with desperate valour<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Hen. Huntin. lib. 2.</NOTE>. The Sax∣ons,
enraged by this resistance, and by the fatigues and
dangers which they had sustained, redoubled their efforts
against the place, and when masters of it, put all their
enemies to the sword without distinction. This decisive
advantage secured the conquests of Aella, who assumed
the name of King, and extended his dominion over Sus∣sex
and a great part of Surrey. He was stopped in his
progress to the east by the kingdom of Kent: In that to
the west, by another tribe of Saxons, who had taken
possession of that territory.</P>
<P>THESE Saxons, from the situation of the country, in
which they settled, were called the West-Saxons, and
landed in the year 495, under the command of Cerdic,
and of his son Kenric<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Will. Malm. lib. 1. cap. 1. p. 12. Chron. Sax. p. 15.</NOTE>. The Britains were, by past ex∣perience,
so much on their guard, and so well prepared to
receive the enemy, that they gave battle to Cerdic the
very day of his landing; and tho' vanquished, still de∣fended,
for some time, their liberties against the invaders.
None of the other tribes of Saxons met with such vigor∣ous
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
resistance, or exerted such valour and perseverance in
pushing their conquests. Cerdic was even obliged to call
for the assistance of his countrymen from the kingdoms of
Kent and Sussex, as -well as from Germany, and he was
thence joined by a fresh army under the command of
Porte, and of his sons Bleda and Megla<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 17.</NOTE>. Strengthened
by these succours, he fought in the year 508 a desperate
battle with the Britains, commanded by Nazan-Leod,
their leader, who was victorious in the beginning of the
action, and routed the wing in which Cerdic himself
commanded. But Kenric, who had prevailed in the
other wing, brought timely assistance to his father, and
restored the battle, which ended in a complete victory on
the fide of the Saxons<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 2. Ethelwerd, lib. 1. Chron. Sax. p. 17.</NOTE>. Nazan-Leod perished, with
5000 of his army: But left the Britains more weakened
than discouraged by his death. The war still continued,
tho' the success was commonly on the side of the Saxons,
whose short swords and close manner of fighting, gave
them great advantage over the missile weapons of the
Britains. Cerdic was not wanting to his good fortune;
and in order to extend his conquests, he laid siege to
Mount Badon or Banesdowne near Bath, whither the
Most obstinate of the discomfited Britains had retired. The
southern Britains in this extremity applied for assistance
to Arthur, prince of the Silures, whose heroic valour now
sustained the declining fate of his country<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hunting. lib. 2.</NOTE>. This is that
Arthur so much celebrated by the songs of Thaliessin,
and the other British bards, and whose military atchieve∣ments
have been blended with so many fables as to give
occasion for entertaining a doubt of his real existence.
But poets, tho' they disfigure the most certain history by
their fictions, and use strange liberties with truth where
they are the sole historians, as among the Britains, have
commonly some foundation for their wildest exaggera∣tions.
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
Certain it is, that the siege of Badon was raised
by the Britains in the year 520, and the Saxons there
discomfited in a great battle<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gildas, Saxon Chron. H. Hunting, lib. 2.</NOTE>. This misfortune stop∣ed
the progress of Cerdic; but was not sufficient to wrest
from him the conquests, which he had already made.
He and his son, Kenric, who succeeded him, established
the kingdom of the West-Saxons or of Wessex over the
counties of Hants, Dorset, Wilts, Berks, and the Isle
of Wight, and left their new acquired dominions to their
posterity. Cerdic died in 534<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Will. Malm, Ethelwerd. H. Huntingdon, lib. 2.</NOTE>; Kenric in 560<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting, lib. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHILE the Saxons made this progress in the south,
their countrymen were not less active in other quarters.
In the year 527<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting, lib. 2,</NOTE> a great tribe of adventurers, under se∣veral
leaders, landed on the east-coast of Britain; and
after fighting many battles, of which history has preserv∣ed
no particular account, they established three new king∣doms
in this island. Uffa assumed the title of king of the
East-Angles in 575; Crida that of Mercia in 585<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Math. West. Huntingdon, lib. 2;</NOTE>
and Erkenwin that of East-Saxony or Essex nearly about
the same time; but the year is uncertain. This latter
kingdom was dismembered from that of Kent, and com∣prehended
Essex, Middlesex, and part of Hertfordshire.
That of the East-Angles, the counties of Cambridge,
Suffolk and Norfolk: Mercia was extended over all the
middle counties, from the banks of the Severn, to the
frontiers of these two kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE Saxons, soon after the landing of Hengist, had
been planted in Northumberland; but meeting with an
obstinate resistance, and making but small progress in
subduing the inhabitants, their affairs were in so un∣settled
a condition, that none of their princes for a long
time assumed the appellation of king. At last in
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
547<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 19.</NOTE>, Ida, a Saxon prince of great merit<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Will. Malms. p. 19.</NOTE>, who claim∣ed
a descent, as did all the other princes of that nation,
from Woden, brought over a reinforcement from Ger∣many,
and enabled the Northumbrians to carry on their
conquests against the Britains. He entirely subdued the
county, now called Northumberland, the bishopric of
Durham, as well as some of the south-east counties of
Scotland; and he assumed the crown under the title of
King of Bernicia. Nearly about the same time, Aella,
another Saxon prince, having conquered Lancashire, and
the greatest part of Yorkshire, received the appellation of
King of Deïri<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ann. Beverl. p. 78.</NOTE> These two kingdoms were united in
the person of Ethelfrid, grandson of Ida, who married
Acca, the daughter of Aella; and expelling her brother,
Edwin, established one of the most powerful of the Saxon
kingdoms, under the title of Northumberland. How far
his dominions extended into the country now called Scot∣land
is uncertain; but it cannot be doubted, that all the
lowlands, especially the east-coast of that country, were
peopled in a great measure from Germany; tho' the expe∣ditions,
made by the several Saxon adventurers, have
escaped the records of history. The language, spoke in
these countries, which is purely Saxon, is a stronger
proof of this event, than can be opposed by the imper∣fect,
or rather fabulous annals, which are obtruded on us
by the Scots historians.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The HEPTARCHY.</HEAD>
<P>THUS was established, after a violent struggle of
near an hundred and fifty years, the Heptarchy, or
seven Saxon kingdoms, in Britain; and the whole
southern part of the island, except Wales and Cornwal,
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
had totally changed its inhabitants, language, customs,
and political institutions. The Britains, under the Ro∣man
dominion, had made such advances towards arts and
civil manners, that they had built twenty-eight consider∣able
cities within their province, besides a great number
of villages and country-feats<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Gildas. Bede, lib. I.</NOTE>; but the fierce conquerors,
by whom they were now subdued, threw every thing
back into antient barbarity; and those few natives, who
were not either massacred or expelled their habitations,
were reduced to the most abject flavery. None of the
other northern conquerors, the Franks, Goths, Vandals,
or Burgundians, tho' they over-ran the southern provin∣ces,
like a mighty torrent, made such devastations in the
conquered territories, or were inflamed into such a vio∣lent
animosity against the antient inhabitants. As the
Saxons came over at intervals in separate bodies,
the Britains, however at first unwarlike, were tempt∣ed
to make resistance; and hostilities, being there∣by
prolonged, proved more destructive to both par∣ties,
especially to the vanquished. The first invad∣ers
from Germany, instead of excluding other adven∣turers,
who must share with them the spoils and proper∣ty
of the antient inhabitants, were obliged to invite over
fresh supplies from their own country; and a total exter∣mination
of the Britains became the sole expedient for
providing a settlement and subsistance to the new plant∣ers.
Hence there have been found in history few con∣quests
more ruinous than that of the Saxons; and few
revolutions more violent than that which they introduced.</P>
<P>So long as the contest was maintained with the natives,
the several Saxon princes preserved an union of councils
and interests; but after the Britains were shut up in the
barren countries of Cornwal and Wales, and gave no far∣ther
inquietude to the conquerors, the band of alliance
was in a great measure dissolved among the princes of the
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
Heptarchy; and tho' one prince seems still to have been
allowed or to have assumed an ascendant over the whole,
his authority, if it ought ever to be deemed regular or
legal, was extremely limited; and each state acted as if it
had been totally separate and independant of the rest.
Wars, therefore, and revolutions and dissentions were
unavoidable among a turbulent and military people; and
these events, however intricate or confused, should now
become the objects of our attention. But, added to the
difficulty of carrying on at once the history of seven inde∣pendant
kingdoms, there is a great discouragement to a
writer, arising from the uncertainty, at least barrenness,
of the accounts transmitted to us. The Monks, who
were the only annalists during those ages, lived remote
from public affairs, considered the civil transactions as en∣tirely
subordinate to the ecclesiastical, and besides parta∣king
of the ignorance and barbarity, which were then
universal, were strongly infected with credulity, with the
love of wonder, and with a propensity to imposture;
vices almost inseparable from their profession, and man∣ner
of life. The history of that period abounds in names,
but is extremely barren of events; or the events are re∣lated
so much without circumstances and causes, that the
most profound or most eloquent writer must despair of
rendering them either instructive or entertaining to the
reader. Even the great learning and vigorous imagina∣tion
of Milton sunk under the weight; and this author
scruples not to declare, that he esteems the skirmishes of
kites or crows equally deserving of a particular narrative,
as the consused transactions and battles of the Saxon
Heptarchy<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Milton in Kennet, p. 50.</NOTE>. In order, however, to connect the events
in some tolerable measure, we shall give a succinct ac∣count
of the successions of kings, and of the revolutions
in each particular kingdom; beginning with that of
which was the first established.</P>

<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
<HEAD>The Kingdom of KENT.</HEAD>
<P>ESCUS succeeded his father, Hengist, in the kingdom
of Kent; but seems not to have possessed the military
reputation enjoyed by that conqueror, who first made way
for the entrance of the Saxon arms into Britain. All the
Saxons, who sought the same of valour, or new establish∣ments
by arms, flocked to the standard of Aella, King
of Sussex, who was carrying on successful war against
the Britains, and laying the foundations of a new king∣dom.
Escus was contented to possess in tranquillity the
kingdom of Kent, which he left in 512 to his son Octa,
in whose time the East-Saxons established their monarchy,
and dismembered the provinces of Essex and Middlesex
from that of Kent. His death, after twenty-two years
reign, made room for his son Hermenric in 534, who
performed nothing memorable during a reign of thirty∣two
years; except associating with him his son, Ethel∣bert,
in the government, in order the better to secure
the succession in his family, and prevent such revolutions
as are incident to a turbulent and barbarous monarchy.</P>
<P>ETHELBERT revived the reputation of his family,
which had languished for fome generations. The inacti∣vity
of his predecessors, and the situation of his country,
secured from all hostility with the Britains, seems to
have much weakened the warlike genius of the Kentish
Saxons; and Ethelbert, in his first attempt to aggrandize
his country, and distinguish his own name, met with
very bad success<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 21.</NOTE>. He was twice discomfited in battle
by Ceaulin, King of Wessex; and obliged to yield the
superiority in the Heptarchy to that ambitious monarch,
who preserved no moderation in his victory, and by sub∣jecting
the kingdom of Sussex, excited jealousy in all the
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
other princes. An association was formed against him;
and Ethelbert, entrusted with the command of the allies,
fought him in a great battle, and obtained a decisive vic∣tory<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 2.</NOTE>.
Ceaulin died soon after; and Ethelbert succeed∣ed
as well to his ascendant among the Saxon states, as to
his other ambitious and exorbitant projects. He reduced
all the princes, except the king of Northumberland, to a
strict dependance upon him; and even established himself
by force on the throne of Mercia, the most extensive of
the Saxon kingdoms. Apprehensive, however, of a dan∣gerous
league against him, like that by which he himself
had been enabled to overthrow Ceaulin, he had the pru∣dence
to resign the throne of Mercia to Webba, the
rightful heir, the son of Crida, who had first founded
that monarchy. But governed still by ambition more
than by justice, he gave Webba possession of the crown
on such conditions, as rendered him little better than a
tributary prince under his artful benefactor.</P>
<P>BUT the most memorable and most fortunate event,
which distinguished the reign of this great prince, was
the introduction of the Christian religion among the Eng∣lish
Saxons. The superstition of the Germans, particu∣larly
that of the Saxons, was of the grossest and most bar∣barous
kind; and being founded on certain traditional
tales, received from their ancestors, not reduced to any
system, not supported by political institutions, like that
of the Druids, it seems to have made little impression on
its votaries, and to have easily resigned its place to the
new doctrine, promulgated to them. Woden, whom
they believed the ancestor of all their princes, was regard∣ed
as the god of war, and, by a natural consequence, be∣came
their supreme deity, and the chief object of their re∣ligious
worship. They believed, that, if they obtained
the favour of this divinity by their valour, (for they made
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
less account of the other virtues) they would be ad∣mitted
after their death into his hall, and reposing on
couches, would satiate themselves with ale from the skulls
of their enemies, whom they had slain in battle. In∣cited
by this idea of paradise, which gratified at once
the passion of revenge and that of intemperance, the
ruling inclinations of barbarians, they despised the dan∣gers
of war, and encreased their native ferocity against
the vanquished by their religious prejudices. We know
little of the other theological tenets of the Saxons: We
only learn that they were idolaters; that they worship∣ped
the sun and moon; that they adored the god of
thunder, under the name of Thor; that they had ima∣ges
in their temples; that they practised sacrifices; be∣lieved
firmly in spells and inchantments; and admitted in
general a system of doctrines, which they held as sacred,
but which, like all other superstitions, must bear the air
of the wildest extravagance, if propounded to those who
are not familiarized to it from their earliest infancy.</P>
<P>THE constant hostilities which the Saxons maintained
against the Britains, would naturally indispose them from
receiving the Christian faith, when preached to them by
such inveterate enemies; and perhaps the Britains, as is
objected to them by Gildas and Bede, were not over∣fond
of communicating to their cruel invaders the doc∣trine
of eternal life and salvation. But as a civilized
people, however subdued by arms, still maintain a sen∣sible
superiority over barbarous and ignorant nations, all
the other northern conquerors of Europe had been al∣ready
induced to embrace the Christian faith, which they
found established in the empire; and it was impossible
but the Saxons, informed of this event, must have re∣garded
with some degree of veneration a doctrine which
had acquired the ascendant over all their brethren. How∣ever
limited in their views, they could not but have per∣ceived
a degree of cultivation in the southern counties
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
beyond what they themselves possessed; and it was na∣tural
for them to yield to that superior knowlege, as well
as zeal, by which the inhabitants of the Christian king∣doms
were even at this time distinguished.</P>
<P>BUT these causes might long have failed of operating
their effect, had not a favourable incident prepared the
means of introducing Christianity into Kent. Ethelbert,
in his father's lifetime, had married Bertha, the only
daughter of Caribert, king of Paris<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Greg. of Tours, lib. 9. cap. 26. H. Hunting. lib. 2.</NOTE>, one of the descend∣ants
of Clovis, the conqueror of Gaul; but before he
was admitted to this alliance, he was obliged to stipulate,
that the princess should enjoy the free exercise of her re∣ligion;
a concession not difficult to be obtained from
the idolatrous Saxons<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 25. Brompton, p. 729.</NOTE>. Bertha brought over a French
bishop to the court of Canterbury; and being zealous for
the propagation of her religion, she had been very assi∣duous
in her devotional exercises, had supported the
credit of her faith by an irreproachable conduct, and had
employed every art of insinuation and address to recon∣cile
her husband to her religious principles. Her popu∣larity
in the court, and her influence over Ethelbert,
had so well paved the way for the reception of the Chris∣tian
doctrine, that Gregory, sirnamed the Great, the
present Roman pontiff, began to entertain hopes of ef∣fectuating
a project, which he himself, before he mounted
the papal throne, had once embraced for converting the
British Saxons.</P>
<P>IT happened, that this prelate, being then in a pri∣vate
station, had observed in the market-place of Rome
some Saxon youths exposed to sale, whom the Roman
merchants, in their trading voyages to Britain, had
bought of their mercenary parents. Struck with the
beauty of their fair complexions and blooming counte∣nances,
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
Gregory asked to what country they belonged;
and being told they were <HI>Angles,</HI> he replied, that they
ought more properly to be denominated <HI>angels;</HI> and it
was a pity that the Prince of Darkness should enjoy so
fair a prey, and that so beautiful a frontispiece should
cover a mind devoid of internal grace and righteousness.
Enquiring farther concerning the name of their province,
he was informed, that it was Deïri, a division of Nor∣thumberland:
<HI>Deïri!</HI> replied he, <HI>that is good! They are
called to the mercy of God from his anger,</HI> De ira. <HI>But
what is the name of the King of that province?</HI> He was
told it was <HI>Aella</HI> or <HI>Alla; Alleluiah,</HI> cried he <HI>We must
endeavour that the praises of God be sung in their country.</HI>
Moved by these allusions, which appeared to him so
happy, he determined to undertake himself a mission into
Britain; and having obtained the Pope's permission, he
prepared for that dangerous journey: But his popularity
at home was so great, that the Romans, unwilling to
expose him to such hazards, opposed his design; and he
was obliged for the present to lay aside farther thoughts
of executing that pious purpose<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 1. Spell. Conc. p. 91.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE controversy between the Pagans and the Christi∣ans
was not entirely cooled in that age; and no pontiff
before Gregory had ever carried to greater excesses his
intemperate zeal against the former religion. He had de∣clared
war against all the precious monuments of the an∣tients,
and even against their writings; which, as ap∣pears
from the strain of his own wit, as well as the style
of his compositions, he had not taste nor genius suffi∣cient
to comprehend. Ambitious to distinguish his pon∣tificate
by the conversion of the British Saxons, he pitch∣ed
on Augustine, a Roman monk, and sent him with
forty associates to preach the gospel in this island. These
missionaries, terrified with the dangers, which might
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
attend their proposing a new doctrine to so fierce a
people, of whose language they were entirely ignorant,
stopped some time in France, and sent back Augustine
to lay the hazards and difficulties before the Pope, and
crave his permission to desist from the undertaking. But
Gregory exhorted them to persevere in their purpose,
advised them to chuse some interpreters from among the
Franks, who still spoke the same language with the
Saxons<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 23,</NOTE>, and recommended them to the good offices of
Queen Brunehaut, who had at this time usurped the so∣vereign
power in their, country. This princess, tho'
stained with every vice of treachery and cruelty, either
possessed or pretended great zeal for the cause; and Gre∣gory
acknowledged, that to her friendly assistance was
in a great measure owing the success of that undertak∣ing<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Greg. Epist. lib. 9. epist. 56. Spell. Conc. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AUGUSTINE, on his arrival in Kent in the year 597<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Higden, Polychron. lib. 5. Chron. Sax. p. 23.</NOTE>,
found the danger much less than he had apprehended.
Ethelbert, already well-disposed towards the Christian
faith, assigned him a habitation in the isle of Thanet;
and soon after admitted him to a conference. Appre∣hensive,
however, that spells or enchantments might be
employed against him by priests, who brought an un∣known
worship from a distant country, he took the pre∣caution
of receiving them in the open air, where he be∣lieved
the force of their magic would be more easily dis∣sipated<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. cap. 25. H. Hunting. lib. 3. Brompton, p. 729. Parker Antiq. Brit. Eccl. p. 61.</NOTE>. Here Augustine, by means of his interpre∣ters,
delivered to him the tenets of the Christian, faith,
and promised him eternal joys above, and a kingdom in
heaven without end, if he would be persuaded to receive
that salutary doctrine.“<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 25. Chron. W. Thorn. p. 1759.</NOTE> Your words and promises,”
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
replied Ethelbert, “are fair; but because, they are new
and uncertain, I cannot entirely yield to them, and
relinquish the principles, which I and my ancestors
have so long maintained. You are welcome, how∣ever,
to remain here in peace; and as you. have un∣dertaken
so long a journey, solely, as appears, for
what you believe to be for our advantage, I will sup∣ply
you with all necessaries, and permit you to deliver
your doctrine to my subjects<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 25. H. Hunting. lib. 3. Brompton, p. 729.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>AUGUSTINE, encouraged by this favourable recep∣tion,
and seeing now a prospect of success, proceeded
with redoubled zeal to preach the gospel to the Kentish
Saxons. He attracted their attention by the austerity of
his manners, by the severe penances to which he sub∣jected
himself, by the abstinence and self-denial which
he practised: And having excited their wonder by a
course of life, which appeared so contrary to nature, he
procured more easily their belief for miracles, which, it
was pretended, he wrought for their conversion<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 26.</NOTE>. In∣fluenced
by these motives, and by the declared favour of
the court, numbers of the Kentish men were baptized;
and the King himself was persuaded to submit to that
rite of Christianity. His example wrought powerfully
on his subjects; but he employed no force to bring them
over to the new doctrine. Augustine thought proper, in
the commencement of his mission, to assume the ap∣pearance
of the greatest lenity; and he told Ethelbert,
that the service of Christ must be entirely Voluntary, and
that no violence ought ever to be used in propagating so
salutary a doctrine<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 26. H. Hunting. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE intelligence received of these spiritual conquests
conveyed great joy to the Romans; who now exulted
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
as much in those peaceful trophies, as their ancestors
had ever done in their most sanguinary triumphs, and
most splendid victories. Gregory wrote a letter to Ethel∣bert,
in which, after informing him, that the end of
the world was approaching, he exhorted him to display
his zeal in the conversion of his subjcts, to exert rigour
against the worship of idols, and to build up the good
work of holiness by every expedient of exhortation, ter∣ror,
blandishment or correction<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 32. Brompton, p. 732. Spell Conc. p. 86.</NOTE>: A doctrine more suit∣able
to that age, and to the usual papal maxims, than
the tolerating principles which Augustine had thought it
prudent to inculcate. The pontiff also answered some
questions, which the missionary had put concerning the
government of the new church of England. Besides
other queries, which it is not necessary here to relate,
Augustine asked, <HI>Whether cousin-germans might be allowed
to marry?</HI> Gregory answered, that that liberty had in∣deed
been formerly granted by the Roman law; but
that experience had shown, that no posterity could ever
come from such marriages; and he therefore prohibited
them. Augustine asks, <HI>Whether a woman pregnant might
be baptized?</HI> Gregory answers, that he sees no objection.
<HI>How soon after the birth the child might receive baptism?</HI>
It was answered, Immediately, if requisite. <HI>How soon
a husband might have commerce with his wife after her deli∣very?</HI>
Not till she had given suck to her child; a prac∣tice
to which Gregory exhorts all women. <HI>How soon a
man might enter the church, or receive the sacrament, after
having had commerce with his wife?</HI> It was replied, that
unless he had approached her without desire, merely for
the sake of propagating his species, he was not free from
sin; but in all cases it was requisite for him, before he
entered the church, or communicated, to purge himself
by prayer and ablution; and ought not, even after using
these precautions, to participate immediately of the sa∣cred
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
cred duties<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 27. Spell: Conc. p. 97, 98, 99, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> There are some other questions and re∣plies
still more indecent and more ridiculous<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Augustine asks, <HI>Si mulier menstrua consuetudine tenetur, an ecclesiam intrare ei licet, aut sacrae communionis sacramenta percipere?</HI> Gregory answers, <HI>Sanitoe communionis mysterium in eisdem diebus percipere non dcbet probiberi. Si autem cx veneratione magna percipere non pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sumitur, laudanda est.</HI> Augustine asks, <HI>Si post illusionem, quae per somnum solet accid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, vel corpus domini quilibet accipere valeat; vel, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i sacerdos sit, sacra mysteria ce-lebrare?</HI> Gregory answers this learned question by many learned dis∣tinctions.</NOTE> And on
the whole, it appears, that Gregory and his missionary,
if sympathy of manners have any influence, were better
calculated than men of more refined understandings, for
making a progress with the ignorant and barbarous
Saxons.</P>
<P>THE more to facilitate the reception of Christianity,
Gregory injoined Augustine to remove the idols from the
Heathen altars, but not to destroy the altars themselves;
because the people, he said, would be allured to fre∣quent
the Christian worship, when they found it cele∣brated
in a place, which they were accustomed to revere
as sacred. And as the Pagans practised sacrifices, and
feasted with the priests on their offerings, he also ex∣horted
the missionary to persuade them, on Christian fes∣tivals,
to kill their cattle in the neighbourhood of the
church, and to indulge themselves in those cheerful en∣tertainments
to which they had been habituated<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 30. Spell. Conc. p. 89, Greg. Epist. lib. 9. epist. 71.</NOTE>. These
political compliances show, that, notwithstanding his ig∣norance
and prejudices, he was not unacquainted with
the arts of governing mankind. Augustine was conse∣crated
archbishop of Canterbury, was endowed by Gre∣gory
with authority over all the British churches, and
received the pall, a badge of ecclesiastical honour, from
Rome<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 23, 24.</NOTE> Gregory also advised him not to be too much
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
elated with his gift of working miracles<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 3. Spell. Conc. p. 83. Bede, lib. 1. Greg. Epist. lib. 9. epist. 60.</NOTE> and as Au∣gustine,
proud, of the success of his mission, seemed to
think, himself intitled to extend his authority over the
bishops of Gaul, the Pope informed him, that they lay
entirely without the bounds of his jurisdiction<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE marriage of Ethelbert with Bertha, and much
more his embracing Christianity, begot a connexion of
his subjects with the French, Italians, and other nations
on the continent, and tended to reclaim them from that
gross ignorance and barbarity, in which all the Saxon
tribes had been hitherto involved<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Will. Malm. p. 10.</NOTE>. He also enacted<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Wilkins Leges Sax. p. 13.</NOTE>.
with the consent of the states of his kingdom, a body of
laws, the first written laws promulgated by any of the
northern, conquerors; and his reign was in every respect
glorious to himself, and useful to his people. He go∣verned
the kingdom of Kent fifty years; and dying in
616<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. P. 25.</NOTE>, left the succession to his son, Eadbald. This
prince, seduced by a passion for his mother-in-law<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Higden, lib. 5. H. Hunting. Lib. 3. Chron. Sax. P. 26.</NOTE>, de∣serted
for some time the Christian faith, -which permitted
not these incestuous marriages; and his whole people
immediately returned with him to idolatry. Lauren∣tius,
the successor of Augustine, found the Christian
worship wholly abandoned, and was preparing to return
into France, in order to save himself the mortification of
preaching the gospel without fruit to the infidels. Mel∣litus
and Justus, who had been consecrated bishops of
London and Rochester, had already departed the king∣dom<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 5.</NOTE>
when Laurentius, before he should entirely
abandon his dignity, made one effort to reclaim the King.
He appeared before that prince; and throwing off his
vestment, showed his body all torn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with bruises and
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
stripes, which he had received. Eadbald, wondering
that any man should have dared to treat in that manner
a person of his rank, was told by Laurentius, that he
had received this chastisement fromt <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Peter, the prince
of the apostles, who had appeared to him in a vision, and
severely reproving him for his intention to desert his
charge, had inflicted on him these visible marks of his
displeasure<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 6. Chron. Sax. P. 26. Higden, lib. 5.</NOTE>. Whether Eadbald was struck with the
miracle, or influenced by some other motive, he di∣vorced
himself from his mother-in-law, and returned to
the profession of Christianity<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 739.</NOTE>: His whole people re∣turned
with him. Eadbald reached not the same nor
authority of his father, and died in 640, after a reign of
twenty-five years<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 30.</NOTE>; leaving two sons, Erminfrid and
Ercombert.</P>
<P>ERCOMBERT, tho' the youngest son, by Emma, a
French princess, found means to mount the throne. He
is celebrated by Bede for two exploits, for establishing
the fast of Lent in his kingdom, and for utterly extir∣pating
idolatry<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 3. cap. 8. H. Hunting. lib. 3. Chron. Sax. p. 31. Ann. Beverl. p. 80.</NOTE>; which, notwithstanding the prevalence
of that papal Christianity preached to the Saxons, had
hitherto been allowed a toleration by the two preceding
monarchs. He reigned twenty-four years; and left the
crown to Egbert, his son, who reigned nine years.
This prince is renowned for his encouragement of lear∣ning;
but infamous for putting to death his two cousin∣germans,
sons to Erminfrid, his uncle<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Will. Malm. p. 11.</NOTE>. The ecclesias∣tical
writers praise him for his bestowing on his sister
Domnona, some lands in the isle of Thanet, where she
founded a monastery.</P>
<P>THE bloody precaution of Egbert could not fix the
crown on the head of his son, Edric. Lothaire, bro∣ther
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
ther to the deceased prince, took possession of the king∣dom;
and in order to secure the power in his family, he
associated with him Richard, his son, in the administra∣tion
of the government. Edric, the dispossessed prince,
had recourse to Edilwach, King of Sussex, for assistance
in maintaining his right; and being supported by that

<P>LOTHAIRE reigned eleven years; Edric his successor
only two. Upon the death of the latter, which hap∣pened

of the crown. But as the succession had been of late so
much disjointed by revolutions and usurpations, faction
began to prevail among the nobility; which invited
Cedwalla, King of Wessex, with his brother Mollo, to
attack the kingdom. These invaders committed great
devastations in Kent; but the death of Mollo, who was
slain in a skirmish<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Higden, lib. 5.</NOTE>, gave a short breathing-time to that
kingdom. Widred restored the affairs of Kent; and af∣ter
a reign of thirty-two years<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. P. 52.</NOTE>, left the crown to his
posterity. Eadbert, Ethelbert, and Alric, his descend∣ants,
successively mounted the throne. After the death

Kent was extinguished; and every factious leader, who
could entertain hopes of ascending the throne, threw the

<HEAD>The Kingdom of NORTHUMBERLAND.</HEAD>
<P>ADELFRID, King of Bernicia, having married Acca,
the daughter of Aella, Kling of Deïri, and expelled
her infant brother, Edwin, had united all the counties
north of Humber, into one monarchy, and acquired a
great ascendant in the heptarchy. He also spread the
terror of the Saxon arms to the neighbouring people;
and by his victories over the Scots and Picts, as well as
Welsh, extended on all sides the bounds of his domi∣nions.
Having laid siege to Chester, the Britains marched
out with all their forces to engage him; and they were
attended with a body of 1250 monks from the monastery
of Bangor, who stood at a small distance from the field
of battle, in order to encourage the combatants by their
presence and exhortations. Adelfrid enquiring about
the purpose of this unusual appearance, was told, that
these priests had come to pray against him: <HI>Then they are
as much our enemies,</HI> said he, <HI>as those who intend to fight
against us</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 779.</NOTE>: And he immediately sent a detachment, who
fell upon them, and committed such slaughter, that only
fifty escaped with their lives<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Trivet. apud Spell. Conc. P. 111.</NOTE>. The Britains, astonished
with this event, received a total defeat: Chester was
obliged to surrender: And Adelfrid, pursuing his victory,
made himself master of Bangor, and entirely demolished
the monastery. It was so vast a building, that there was
a mile's distance from one gate of it to another; and it
contained two thousand one hundred monks, who are
<PB N="42" REF="50"/>
said to have been there maintained by the fruits of their
own labour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 2. W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING Adelfrid's success in war, he
lived in inquietude on account of young Edwin, whom
he had unjustly dispossessed of the crown of Deïri. This
prince, now grown to man's estate, wandered from place
to place, in continual danger from the attempts of Adel∣frid;
and received at last protection in the court of Red∣wald,
King of the East-Angles; where his engaging and
gallant deportment procured him the affections of every
one. Redwald, however, was strongly solicited by the
King of Northumberland to kill or deliver up his guest:
Rich presents were promised him, if he would comply;
and war denounced against him, in case of his refusal.
After rejecting several messages of this kind, his gene∣rosity
began to yield to the motives of interest; and he
retained the last ambassador, till he should come to a re∣solution
in a case of such importance. Edwin, informed
of his friend's hesitation, was yet determined at all haz∣ards
to remain in East-Anglia; and thought, that if the
protection of that court failed him, it were better to die
than prolong a life so much exposed to the persecutions
of his powerful rival. This confidence in Redwald's
honour and friendship, with his other accomplishments,
engaged the Queen on his side; and she effectually re∣presented
to her husband the infamy of delivering up to
certain destruction tbeir royal guest, who had fled to them
for protection against his cruel and jealous enemies<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 3. H. Hunting lib. 3. Bede.</NOTE>.
Redwald, therefore, embracing more generous resolu∣tions,
thought it safest to prevent Adelfrid, before he was
aware of his intention, and to attack him while he was
yet unprepared for defence. He marched suddenly with
an army into the kingdom of Northumberland, and
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
fought a battle with Adelfrid; where that monarch was
defeated and killed, after revenging himself by the death
of Regner, son to Redwald<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 12. Brompton, p. 781.</NOTE>. His own sons, Eanfrid,
Oswald, and Oswy, yet infants, fled into Scotland; and
Edwin obtained possession of the crown of Northumber∣land.</P>
<P>EDWIN was the greatest prince of the heptarchy dur∣ing
his time, and distinguished himself, both by his in∣fluence
over the other kingdoms<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 27.</NOTE>, and by the strict exe∣cution
of justice in his own dominions. He reclaimed
his subjects from the licentious life to which they had
been habituated; and it was a common saying, that in
his reign a woman or child might openly carry every
where a purse of gold, without any danger of violence
of robbery<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 2. Bede, W. Malmes.</NOTE>. There is a remarkable instance, transmit∣ted
to us, of the affection borne him by his servants.
Cuichelme, King of Wessex, was his enemy; and find∣ing
himself unable to maintain open war against so gal∣lant
and powerful a prince, he determined to make use
of treachery against him, and he employed one Eumer
for that criminal purpose. The assassin, having obtained
admittance, by pretending to deliver a message from Cui∣chelme,
drew his dagger, and rushed upon the King.
Lilla, an officer of his army, seeing his master's danger,
and having no other means of defence, interposed with
his own body between the King and Eumer's dagger,
which was pushed with such violence, that, after pierc∣ing
Lilla, it even wounded Edwin: And before the as∣sassin
could renew his blow, he was dispatched by the
guards<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 9. Chron. Sax. p. 27. Higden, lib. 5. H. Hunting. lib. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE East-Angles conspired against Redwald, their
King; and having put him to death, they offered their
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
crown to Edwin, of whose valour and capacity they had had
experience, while he resided among them. But
Edwin, sensible of gratitude towards his benefactor,
obliged them to submit to Earpwold, the son of Red∣wald;
and that prince preserved his authority, tho' on
a precarious footing, under the protection of the Nor∣thumbrian
monarch<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gul. Malmef. lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWIN, after his accession to the crown, married
Ethelburga, the daughter of Ethelbert, King of Kent;
and this princess, emulating the glory of her mother
Bertha, who had been the instrument of converting her
husband and his people to Christianity, carried Paulli∣nus,
a learned bishop, along with her<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 3.</NOTE>; and besides sti∣pulating
a toleration for the exercise of her own reli∣gion,
which was readily granted her, she used every
reason to persuade the King to embrace it. Edwin, like
a prudent prince, hesitated on the proposal; but pro∣mised
to examine the foundations of that doctrine; and
if he found them satisfactrory, he declared himself willing
to be converted<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 9.</NOTE>. Accordingly he held several confer∣ences
with Paullinus, canvassed the arguments propound∣ed
with the wisest of his counsellors, retired frequently
from company, in order to revolve alone that import∣ant
question; and after a serious and long enquiry, de∣clared
in favour of the Christian religion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 9. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE>. The people
soon after imitated his example. Besides the authority
and influence of the King, they were moved by another
striking example. Coifi, the high priest, being con∣verted
after a public conference with Paullinus, led the
way in destroying the images, which he had so long
worshipped, and was forward in making this atonement
for his past idolatry<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 13. Brompton, Higden, lib. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="53"/>
THIS able prince perished with his son, Osfrid, in a
great battle which he fought against Penda, King of
Mercia, and Cadwalla, King of the Britains<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Matth. West, p. 114. Chron. Sax. p. 29.</NOTE>, That
event, which happened in the forty-eighth year of Ed∣win's
age and seventeenth of his reign<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. Lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE>, divided the
monarchy of Northumberland, which he had united in
his person. Eanfrid, the son of Adelfrid, returned with
his brothers, Oswald and Oswy, from Scotland, and
took possession of Bernicia, his paternal kingdom: Osric,
Edwin's cousin-german, established himself in Deïri, the
inheritance of his family; but to which the sons of Ed∣win
had a preferable title. Eadfrid, the eldest surviv∣ing
son, fled to Penda, by whom he was treacherously
slain. The younger son, Vuscrfaea, with Yffi, the grand∣son
of Edwin, by Osfrid, sought protection in Kent,
and not finding themselves in safety there, retired into
France to King Dagobert, where they died<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OSRIC, King of Deïri, and Eanfrid of Bernicia re∣turned
to Paganism; and the whole people seem to have
returned with them; since Paullinus, who was conse∣crated
first archbishop of York, and who had converted
them, thought proper to retire with Ethelburga, the
Queen Dowager, into Kent. Both these Northumbrian
kings perished soon after, the first in battle against Caed∣walla,
the Britain; the second by the treachery of that
prince. Oswald, the brother of Eanfrid, of the race of
Bernicia, united again the kingdom of Northumberland
in the year 634, and restored the christian religion in
his dominions. He gained a great and well-disputed bat∣tle
against Caedwalla; the last vigorous effort which the
Britains made against the Saxons. Oswald is much
celebrated for his sanctity and charity by the Monkish

natural brother, acquired possession of the kingdom, which
he happily governed for nineteen years; and he left it
to Osred, his son; a boy of eight years of age. This
prince, after a reign of eleven years, was murdered by
Kenred his kinsman<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes, lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE>, who, after enjoying the crown
only a year, perished by a like fate. Osric, and after
him Celwulph the son of Kenred, next mounted the
throne, which the latter relinquished in the year 738, in
favour of Eadbert his cousin-german, who imitating his
predecessor, abdicated the crown, and retired into a mo∣nastery<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Simeon Dunelm. lib. 2. cap. 1, 3. Chron. Sax. cap. 59.</NOTE>.
Oswolf, son of Eadbert, was slain in a sedi∣tion,
a year after his accession to the crown<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Simeon Dunelm. lib. 2. cap. 4.</NOTE>; and Mol∣lo,
who was not of the royal family, seized the crown.

the throne, was soon after expelled by his subjects<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 61.</NOTE>.
Ethelred, his successor, the son of Mollo, shared a like
fate. Celwold, the next king, the brother of Ailfred,
was deposed and slain by the people, and his place was
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
filled by Osred, his nephew, who after the short reign
of a year, made way for Ethelbert, another son of Mol∣lo,
whose death was equally tragical with that of almost
all his predecessors. After Ethelbert's death an univer∣sal
anarchy prevailed in Northumberland<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE> and the
people, having, by so many fatal revolutions, lost all at∣tachment

prepared for subjection to a foreign yoke; which Egbert,
King of Wessex, finally imposed upon them.</P>

<HEAD>The Kingdom of EAST-ANGLIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE history of this kingdom contains nothing me∣morable,
except the converting to christianity Earp∣wold,
the fourth king and great-grandson of Uffa, the
founder of the monarchy. The authority of Edwin,
King of Northumberland, on whom that prince entirely
depended, engaged him to take this step: But soon af∣ter,
his wife, who was an idolatress, brought him back
to her religion<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bede; lib. 2. cap. 15. Bromp. W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 5. H. of Huntingdon says it was Redwald who apostatized, lib. 3.</NOTE>; and he was found unable to resist
those allurements, which have seduced the wisest of man∣kind.
After his death, which was violent, like that of
most of the Saxon princes,, who did not early retire in∣to
monasteries, Sigebert, his successor, and half-brother,
who had been educated in France, restored christianity,
and introduced learning among the Angles<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 15. lib. 3. cap. 22.</NOTE>. Some pre∣tend
that he founded the university of Cambridge, or
rather some schools in that place. It is almost impossi∣ble,
and quite needless to be more particular in relating
the transactions of the East-Angles. What advantage
or entertainment can it give the reader to hear a long
bede-roll of barbarous names, Egric, Annas, Ethelbert,
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
Ethelwald, Aldulf, Elfwald, Beorne, Ethelred, Ethel∣bert,
who successively murdered, expelled, or inherited
from each other, and obscurely filled the throne of that
kingdom. Ethelbert, the last of these princes, was
treacherously murdered by Offa, King of Mercia, in the
year 792, and his state was thenceforth united with that
of Offa, as we shall relate presently.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The kingdom of MERCIA.</HEAD>
<P>MERCIA, the largest, if not the most powerful
kingdom of the Heptarchy, comprehended all the
middle counties of England; and as its frontiers extended
to those of all the other fix kingdoms, as well as to
Wales, it received its name from that circumstance.
Wibba, the son of Crida, founder of the monarchy,
being placed on the throne by Ethelbert, King of Kent,
governed his paternal dominions by a very precarious au∣thority;
and after his death, Ceorl, his kinsman, was,
by the influence of the Kentish monarch, preferred to his
son, Penda, whose turbulent disposition appeared dan∣gerous
to that prince. Penda was thus fifty years of
age before he mounted the throne; and his temerity and
martial disposition were found nowise unabated by time,
experience, or reflection. He engaged in continual hos∣tilities
against all the neighbouring states; and by his
injustice and violence rendered himself equally odious to
his own subjects and to strangers. Sigebert, Egric, and
Annas, three kings of East-Anglia, perished in battle
against him; as did also Edwin and Oswald, the two
greatest princes, who bad filled the throne of Northum∣berland<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Higd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. lib. 5. Brompton. p. 771. Ann. Beverl. p. 85.</NOTE>. At last, Oswy, brother to Oswald, having
defeated him in a great battle, freed the world from this
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
sanguinary tyrant<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Higden, lib. 5. W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 3. Flor. Wigo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 560.</NOTE>. Peada, his son, obtained the crown
of Mercia in 655, and lived under the protection of Os∣wy,
whose daughter he had espoused. This princess was
educated in the christian faith, and she employed her
influence with, success, in converting her husband and
his subjects to that religion<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 3. cap. 21. Brompton, p. 771. Higden, lib. 5. H. Hunting. lib. 3. Simeon Dunelm. lib. 1. cap. 4. Ann. Beverl. p. 86.</NOTE>. Thus the fair sex have
had the merit of introducing the christian doctrine into
all the most considerable kingdoms of the Saxon Heptar∣chy.
Peada died a violent death<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hugo Candidus, p. 4. says, that he was treacherously murdered by his queen, from whose persuasion he had embraced christianity; but this account of the matter is found in that historian alone.</NOTE>. His son, Wolfhere,
succeeded to the government; and after having reduced
to dependance the kingdoms of Essex, and East-Anglia,
he left the crown to his brother, Ethelred, who, tho' a
lover of peace, showed himself not unfit for military en∣terprizes.
Besides making a successful expedition into
Kent, he repulsed Egfrid, King of Northumberland,
who had invaded his dominions; and he slew in battle
Elfwin, the brother of that prince. Desirous, however,
of composing all animosities with Egfrid, he payed him
a sum of money, as a compensation for the loss of his
brother. After a prosperous reign of thirty years, he re∣signed
the crown to Kendred, son of Wolfhere, and re∣tired
into the monastery of Bardney<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 24.</NOTE>. Kendred return∣ed
the present of the crown to Ceolred, the son of Ethel∣red;
and making a pilgrimage to Rome, passed his life
there in pennance and devotion<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 4. Bede, lib. 5. cap. 24.</NOTE>. The place of Ceol∣red
was supplied by Ethelbald<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ingulph. P. 2.</NOTE>, great-grand nephew to
Penda by Alwy, his brother; and this prince, being
slain in a mutiny, was succeeded by Offa, who was a
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
degree more remote from Penda, by Eawa, another bro∣ther.</P>
<P>THIS prince, who mounted the throne in 755<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 59.</NOTE> had
some great qualities, and was successful in his warlike
enterprizes against Lothaire, King of Kent, and Ken∣wulph,
King of Wessex. He defeated the former in a
bloody battle at Otford upon the Darent, and reduced
his kingdom to a state of dependance: He gained a vic∣tory
over the latter at Bensington in Oxfordshire; and
conquering that county, together with that of Glocester,
annexed it to his other dominions. But all these succes∣ses
were stained by his treacherous murder of Ethelbert,
King of the East-Angles, and his violent seizure of that
kingdom. This young prince, who is said to have pos∣sessed
great merit, had made suit to Elfrida, the daugh∣ter
of Offa, and was invited with all his retinue to He∣reford,
in order to solemnize the nuptials. Amidst the
joy and festivity of these entertainments, he was seized
by Offa, and secretly beheaded: And tho' Elfrida, who
abhorred her father's treachery, had time to give warn∣ing
to the East-Anglia nobility, who escaped into their
own country, Offa, having extinguished the royal fa∣mily,
succeeded in his project of subduing that country<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 750, 751, 752.</NOTE>.
The treacherous prince, desirous of re-establishing his
character in the world, and perhaps of appeasing the re∣morses
of his own conscience, payed great court to the
clergy, and practised all the monkish devotions, which
were so much esteemed in that ignorant and superstitious
age. He gave the tenth of all his goods to the church<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Spell. Conc. P. 308. Brompton, p. 776.</NOTE>;
bestowed rich donations on the cathedral of Hereford;
and even made a pilgrimage to Rome, where his great
power and riches could not fail of procuring him the pa∣pal
absolution. The better to ingratiate himself with the
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
sovereign pontiff, he engaged to pay him from his king∣dom
a yearly donation for the support of an English col∣lege
at Rome<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spell. Conc. p. 230. 310. 312.</NOTE>, and in order to raise the sum, he im∣posed
a tax of a penny on each house possessed of thirty
pence a year. This imposition, being afterwards levied
from all England, was commonly denominated Peter's
pence<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Higden, lib. 5;</NOTE> and tho' conferred at first as a gift, was after∣wards
pretended to be a tribute by the Roman pontiff.
Carrying his hypocrisy still farther, Offa, feigning to be
directed by visions from heaven, found out at Verulam,
the relicts of St. Alban, the martyr, and endowed a mag∣nificent
monastery in that place<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ingulph. p. 5. W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 4.</NOTE> Moved by all these acts
of piety, Malmesbury, one of the best of the old English
historians, declares himself at a loss to determine<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Lib. I. cap. 4.</NOTE> whether
the merits or crimes of this prince preponderated. Offa
died, after a reign of thirty-nine years, in 794.<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 65.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS prince was become so considerable in the Hep∣tarchy,
that the Emperor Charlemagne entered into an
alliance and friendship with him; a circumstance, which
did him honour; as distant princes then had very little
communication with each other. That emperor being
a great lover of learning and learned men, in an age
which was very barren of that ornament, Offa, at his
desire, sent him over Alcuin, a clergyman, much cele∣brated
for his knowledge, who received great honours
from Charlemagne, and even became his preceptor in
the sciences. The chief reason, why he had at first de∣sired the company of Alcuin, was that he might oppose
his learning to the heresy of Felix, bishop of Urgel in
Catalonia; who maintained, that Jesus Christ, consi∣dered in his human nature, could more properly be de∣nominated the adoptive than the natural son of God<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Dupin, cent. 8. chap. 4.</NOTE>.
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
This heresy was condemned in the council of Francfort,
held in 794, and consisting of 300 bishops. Such were
the questions which were agitated in that age, and which
employed the attention, not only of cloystered scholars, but
of the wisest and greatest princes<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Offa, in order to protect his country from Wales, drew a rampart or ditch of a hundred miles in length from Basingwerke in Flintshir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the South-sea near Bristol.

the bishop, at the communion<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 3. Brampton, p. 738. 743. Bede.</NOTE>. But on his re∣fusing
them, unless they would submit to be baptized,
they expelled him their dominions. The other princes
names, who reigned successively in Essex, are Sigebert the
little, Sigebert the good, who restored christianity,
Swithelm, Sigheri, Offa. This last prince, having made
a vow of chastity, notwithstanding his marriage with
Keneswitha, a Mercian princess, daughter to Penda,
went in pilgrimage to Rome, and shut himself up during
the rest of his life in a cloyster. Selred, his successor,
reigned thirty-eight years; and was the last of the royal
line: The failure of which threw the kingdom into great confusion, and reduced it to dependance under Mercia<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 6.</NOTE>.
Switherd first acquired the crown, and his death made
way for Sigeric, who ended his life in a pilgrimage to
Rome. His successor, Sigered, unable to defend his
kingdom, submitted to the victorious arms of Egbert.</P>

<HEAD>The Kingdom of SUSSEX.</HEAD>
<P>THE history of this kingdom, the smallest in the
Heptarchy, is still more imperfect than that of Es∣sex.
Aella, the foúnder of the monarchy, left the crown
to his son, Cissa, who is remarkable chiefly for his long
reign of seventy-six years. During his time, the South-Saxons
fell almost into a total dependance on the king∣dom
of Wessex; and we scarce know the names of the
kings, who were possessed of this titular sovereignty.
Adelwalch, the last of them, was subdued in battle by
Ceadwalla, King of Wessex, and was slain in the action;
leaving two infant sons, who, falling into the hand of
the conqueror, were murdered by him. The abbot of
Redford opposed the order for this barbarous execution;
but could prevail on Ceadwalla only to suspend it, till
they should be baptized. Bercthun and Audhun, two
noblemen of character, resisted some time the dominion
of the West-Saxons; but their opposition served only to
prolong the miseries of their country; and the subduing
this kingdom, was the first step, which the West-Sax∣ons
made towards acquiring the sole monarchy of Eng∣land<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 800<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>The Kingdom of WESSEX.</HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom of Wessex, which finally swallowed
up all the other Saxon states, met with great resist∣ance
on its first establishment; and the Britains, who
were now enured to arms, yielded not tamely their pos∣sessions
to these invaders. Cerdic, the founder of the mo∣narchy,
and his son, Kenric, fought many successful,
and some unsuccessful battles, against the natives; and
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
the martial spirit, common to all the Saxons, was, by
means of these hostilities, carried to the greatest height
among this tribe. Ceaulin, the son and successor of Ken∣ric,
who began his reign in 560, was even more ambi∣tious
and enterprizing than his predecessors; and by
waging continual war against the Britains, he added a
great part of the counties of Devon and Somerset to his
other dominions. Carried away by the tide of success, he
invaded the other Saxon states in his neighbourhood,
and becoming terrible to all, he provoked a general con∣federacy
against him. This alliance proved successful un∣der
the conduct of Ethelbert, King of Kent; and Ceau∣lin,
who had lost the affections of his own subjects by his
violent disposition, and had now fallen into contempt from
his misfortunes, was expelled the throne<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 22.</NOTE>, and died in
exile and misery. Cuichelme and Cuthwin, his sons,
governed jointly the kingdom, till the expulsion of the
latter in 591, and the death of the former in 593, made
way for Cealric, to whom succeeded Ceobald in 593, by
whose death, which happened in 611, Kynegils inherit∣ed
the crown. This prince embraced christianity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Higden, lib. 5. Chron. Sax. p. 15. Ann. Beverl. p. 94.</NOTE>,
thro' the persuasion of Oswald, King of Northumber∣land,
who had married his daughter, and who had attain∣ed
a great ascendant in the heptarchy. Kenwalch next
succession so the monarchy, and dying in 672, left the
succession so much disputed, that Sexburga, his widow, a
woman of great merit<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 4. cap 12. Chron. Sax. p. 41.</NOTE>, kept possession of the govern∣ment
till her death, which happened two years after.
Escwin then peaceably acquired the crown; and after a
short reign of two years, made way for Kentwin, who
governed nine years. Ceodwalla, his successor, mount∣ed
not the throne without opposition; but proved a great

<PB N="56" REF="66"/>
prince, according to the ideas of those times; that is,
he was enterprizing, warlike, and successful. He sub∣dued
entirely the kingdom of Sussex, and annexed it to
his own dominions. He made deep impressions upon
Kent; but met with resistance from Widred, the King,
who proved successful against Mollo, brother to Ceod∣walla,
and slew him in a skirmish<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 4. Brompton, p. 757.</NOTE>. Ceodwalla at last,
tired with wars and bloodshed, was seized with a fit of
devotion; bestowed several endowments on the church,
and made a pilgrimage to Rome, where he received bap∣tism,
and died in 689<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 7. W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 2. Ethelwerd, lib. 2. cap. 10. M. West. p. 128. Chron. Sax. p. 46.</NOTE>. Ina, his successor, inherited
the military virtues of Ceodwalla, and added to them the
more valuable ones of justice, policy, and prudence<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE>
He made war upon the Britains in Somerset; and having
finally subdued that province, he treated the vanquished
with an humanity, hitherto unknown to the Saxon con∣querors.
He allowed the proprietors to retain possession
of their lands<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Vita Adelhelm, p. 32. See also LL Inae § 24. Wilkins, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, encouraged marriages and alliances be∣tween
them and his antient subjects<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Concil. Mag. Brit. tom. 1. p. 74.</NOTE>, and gave them the
privilege of being governed by the same laws. These
laws he augmented and ascertained<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 14.</NOTE>; and though he was
disturbed by some insurrections at home, his long reign
of thirty-seven years may be regarded as one of the most
glorious and most prosperous of the heptarchy. In the
decline of his age, he made a pilgrimage to Rome; and
on his return home, he shut himself up in a cloyster,
where he died?.<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 7. Chron. Sax. p. 52. Higden, lib. 5. W. Malm, lib, 1. cap. 2. H. Hunting. lib. 4. M. West. p. 135.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the Kings of Wessex had always been princes of the blood, descended from Cerdic, the founder of the
<PB N="57" REF="67"/>
monarchy, the order of succession had been far from ex∣act;
and a more remote prince had often found means to
mount the throne, in preference to one descended from a
nearer branch of, the royal family. Ina, therefore, hav∣ing
no children of his own, and lying much under the in∣fluence
of Ethelburga, his Queen, left by will the suc∣cession
to Adelard, her brother, who was his remote
kinsman<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE>: But this destination took not place without
some difficulty. Oswald, a prince more nearly allied to
the crown, took arms against Adelard<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 768.</NOTE>; but he being
suppressed, and dying soon after, the title of Adelard was
not any farther disputed; and in the year 741, he was
succeeded by his cousin, Cudred<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 55.</NOTE>. The reign of this
prince was distinguished by a great victory, which he ob∣tained,
by the means of Edelhun, his general, over
Ethelbald, King of Mercia<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 769. Chron. Sax. p. 56.</NOTE>. His death made way for
Sigebert, his kinsman, who governed so ill, that his peo∣ple
rose in an insurrection, and dethroned him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 2. Brompton, p 770. Chron. Sax. p. 56.</NOTE>, crown∣ing
Cenulph in his stead. The exiled prince found a re∣fuge
with duke Cumbran, governor of Hampshire; who,
that he might add to his other kindness towards Sigebert,
gave him many salutary counsels for his future conduct,
accompanied with some reprehensions for the past. But
these were so much resented by the ungrateful prince,
that he conspired against the life of his protector, and
treacherously murdered him. After this infamous action, he was forsaken by every body; and skulking about in
the wilds and forests, was at last discovered by a servant
of Cumbran, who instantly took revenge upon him for
the death of his master<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Higden, lib. 5. W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CENULPH, who had obtained the crown on the expul∣sion of Sigebert, was fortunate in many expeditions
<PB N="58" REF="68"/>
against the Britains of Cornwal; but afterwards lost some
reputation by his ill successes against Offa, king of Mer∣cia<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">W. Mlemes. lib. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE>. Kynehard also, brother to the deposed Sigebert,
gave him disturbance; and tho' expelled the kingdom, he
hovered on the frontiers, and waited an opportunity of at∣tacking
his rival. The King had an intrigue with a
young woman, who lived at Merton in Surrey<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wigorn. p. 576. Chron. Sax. p. 57, 63.</NOTE>; whi∣ther
having secretly retired, he was on a sudden inviron∣ed,
in the night-time, by Kynehard and his followers,
and after making a vigorous resistance, was murdered,
with all his attendants. The people and nobility of the
neighbourhood, rising next day in arms, took revenge on
Kynehard for the slaughter of their King, and put every
one to the sword, who had been engaged in that criminal enterprize<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wigorn. p. 576. Hoveden, p. 409.</NOTE>. This event happened in 784.</P>
<P>BRITHRIC next obtained possession of the government,
tho' very remotely descended from the royal family; but
enjoyed not that dignity without inquietude. Eoppa,
nephew to King Ina, by his brother Ingild, who died
before that prince begot Eata, father to Alchmond, from
whom sprung Egbert<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 16.</NOTE>, a young prince of the most pro∣mising
hopes, who gave great jealousy to Brithric, the
present King, both because he seemed by his birth better
intitled to the crown, and because he had acquired, to
an eminent degree, the affections of the people. Egbert,
sensible of his danger from the suspicions of Brithric, with∣drew
secretly into France<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 4.</NOTE>; where he was well received
by Charlemagne, the present monarch. By living in the
court, and serving in the armies of that prince, the most
able and most generous who had appeared in Europe
during several ages, he acquired those accomplishments
which afterwards enabled him to make such a shining fi∣gure
<PB N="59" REF="69"/>
on the throne; and familiarizing himself to the
manners of the French, who, as Malmesbury observes<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 11.</NOTE>,
were eminent both for valour and civility, above all the
western nations, he learned to polish the rudeness and
barbarity of the Saxon character: And his early misfor∣tunes
proved thus of infinite advantage to him.</P>
<P>IT was not long before Egbert had opportunities of
displaying his natural and acquired talents. Brithric,
King of Wessex, had married Eadburga, natural daugh∣ter<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 749, 750. W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 2. H. Hunting. lib. 4.</NOTE>
of Offa, King of Mercia, a profligate woman,
equally infamous for cruelty and for incontinence. Ha∣ving
great influence over her husband, she often incited
him to destroy such of the nobility as were obnoxious to
her; and where this expedient failed her, she scrupled
not being herself active in traiterous attempts upon their
life. She had mixed a cup of poison for a young noble∣man,
who had acquired her husband's friendship, and
had on that account become the object of her jealousy:
But unfortunately, the King drank of the fatal cup along
with his favourite, and soon after expired<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Higden, lib. 5. M. West. p. 152. Asser. in vita Alfredi, p. 3. ex edit. Camdeni.</NOTE>. This event,
joined to her other crimes, rendered Eadburga so odious,
that she was obliged to fly into France; whence Egbert
was at the same time recalled by the nobility, in order to
ascend the throne of his ancestors<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. A. D. 800. Brompton, p. 801.</NOTE>. He attained that
dignity in the last year of the eighth century.</P>
<P>IN all the kingdoms of the heptarchy, an exact rule
of succession was either unknown or not strictly observed;
and thence the reigning prince was continually agitated
with jealousy against all the princes of the blood, whom
he still considered as rivals, and whose death alone could
give him entire security in his possession of the throne.
<PB N="60" REF="70"/>
From this fatal cause, together with the admiration of
the monastic life, and the opinion of merit, attending the
preservation of chastity even in a married state, the royal
families had been entirely extinguished in all the king∣doms
except that of Wessex; and the emulations, suspi∣cions,
and conspiracies, which had formerly been con∣fined
to the princes of the blood alone, were now diffused
among all the nobility in the several Saxon states. Eg∣bert
was the sole descendant of those first conquerors who
subdued Britain, and who enhanced their authority by
claiming a pedigree from Woden, the supreme divinity of
their ancestors. But that prince, tho' invited by this fa∣vourable
circumstance to make attempts on the neighbour∣ing
Saxons, gave them for some time no disturbance,
and rather chose to turn his arms against the Britains in
Cornwal, whom he defeated in several battles<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 69.</NOTE>. He was
recalled from the conquest of that country by an inroad
made into his dominions by Bernulf, King of Mercia.</P>
<P>THE Mercians, before the accession of Egbert, had
very nearly attained the absolute sovereignty over the
heptarchy: They had reduced the East-Angles under-sub∣jection,
and established tributary princes in the king∣doms
of Kent and Essex. Northumberland was involved
in anarchy; and no state of any consequence remained
but that of Wessex, which, much inferior in extent to
Mercia, was supported by the great qualities of its sove∣reign
alone. Egbert led his army against the invaders;
and encountering them at Ellandun in Wiltshire, obtain∣ed
a complete victory, and by the slaughter executed on
them in their flight, gave a mortal blow to the power of
the Mercians. Whilst he himself, in prosecution of his
victory, entered their country on the side of Oxfordshire,
and threatened the heart of their dominions; he sent an
army into Kent, commanded by Ethelwolph, his eldest
<PB N="61" REF="71"/>
son<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ethelwerd, lib. 3. cap. 2.</NOTE>; and expelling Baldred, the tributary King, soon
made himself master of that country. The kingdom of
Essex was conquered with equal facility; and the East-Angles,
from their hatred to the Mercian government,
which had been established over them by treachery and
violence, and probably exercised with tyranny, imme∣diately
rose in arms, and craved the protection of Eg∣bert<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ethelwerd, lib. 3. cap. 3.</NOTE>.
Bernulf, the Mercian King, who marched
against them, was defeated and slain; and two years af∣ter,
Ludecan, his successor, met with the same fate.
These insurrections and calamities facilitated the enterpri∣zes
of Egbert, who advanced into the heart of the Mer∣cian
territories, and made easy conquests over a disheart∣ened
and divided people. In order to engage them more
easily to submission, he allowed Wiglef, their country∣man,
to retain the title of King, whilst he himself exer∣cised
the real powers of sovereignty<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ingulph. p. 7, 8, 10.</NOTE>. The anarchy,
which prevailed in Northumberland, tempted him to car∣ry
still farther his victorious arms; and the inhabitants,
unable to resist his power, and desirous of possessing some
established form of government, were forward, on his
first appearance, to send deputies, who submitted to his
authority, and expressed their allegiance to him as their
sovereign. Egbert, however, still allowed to Northum∣berland,
as he had done to Mercia and East-Anglia, the
power of electing a King, who paid him tribute, and was
dependant on him.</P>
<P>THUS were united all the kingdoms of the heptarchy
in one great state, near four hundred years after the first
arrival of the Saxons in Britain; and the fortunate arms
and prudent policy of Egbert at last effectuated what had
been so often attempted in vain by so many princes<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 71.</NOTE>
Kent, Northumberland, and Mercia, which had succes∣sively
<PB N="62" REF="72"/>
aspired to general dominion, were now incorpo∣rated
in his empire; and the other subordinate kingdoms
seemed wiliingly to share the same fate. His territories
were nearly of the same extent with what is now proper∣ly
denominated England; and a favourable prospect was
afforded the Anglo-Saxons, of establishing a civilized
monarchy, possessed of tranquillity within itself, and se∣cure
against foreign invasion. This great event happen∣ed
in the year 827<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 71.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Saxons, tho' they had been so long settled in the
island, seem not as yet to have been much improved be∣yond
their German ancestors, either in arts, civility,
knowledge, humanity, justice, or obedience to the laws.
Even Christianity, tho', among other advantages, it open∣ed
the way to connexions between them and the more
polished states of Europe, had not hitherto been very ef∣fectual,
in banishing their ignorance, or softening their
barbarous manners. As they received that doctrine thro'
the corrupted channels of Rome, which had strongly
tinctured the original purity of the Christian faith, it car∣ried
along with it a great mixture of credulity and super∣stition,
equally destructive to the understanding and to
morals. The reverence towards saints and reliques seems
to have almost supplanted the adoration of the supreme
Being: Monastic observances were esteemed more meri∣torious
than the active virtues: The knowledge of
natural causes was neglected from the universal belief
of miraculous interpositions and judgments: Bounty to
the church atoned for all violences against society: And
the remorses for cruelty, murder, treachery, assassination,
and the more robust vices, were appeased, not by amend∣ment
of life, but by penances, servility to the monks,
and an abject and illiberal devotion<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">These abuses were common to all the European churches; but th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> priests in Italy, Spain, and Gaul, made some atonement for them by other advantages, which they rendered society. For several ages, they were almost all Romans, or, in other words, the antient natives; and they preserved the Roman language and laws, with some remains of the former civility. But the priests in the heptarchy, after the first mission∣aries, were wholly Saxon, and almost as ignorant and barbarous as the laity. They contributed, therefore, little to the improvement of the so∣ciety in knowledge or the arts.</NOTE>. The reverence for
<PB N="63" REF="73"/>
the clergy had mounted so high, that wherever a person
appeared in a sacerdotal habit, tho' on the high way, the
people flocked around him; and showing him all marks
of profound respect, received every word he uttered as the
most sacred oracles<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 3. cap. 26.</NOTE>. Even the military virtues, so inhe∣rent
in all the Saxon tribes, began to be neglected; and
the nobility, preferring the security and sloth of the cloy∣ster
to the tumults and glory of war, valued themselves
chiefly on the endowment of monasteries, of which they
assumed the government<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 23. Episto∣la Bedae ad Egbert.</NOTE>. The crown too, being ex∣tremely
impoverished by continual benefactions to the
church, to which the states of the kingdom weakly con∣sented,
could bestow no rewards on valour or military
services, and retained not even sufficient influence to sup∣port
the government<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Bedae. Epist. ad Egbort.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER inconvenience, which attended this corrupt
species of Christianity, was the superstitious attachment
to Rome, and the gradual subjection of the kingdom to a
foreign jurisdiction. The Britains had never acknow∣ledged
any subordination to the Roman pontiff, and had
conducted all ecclesiastical government by their domestic
synods and councils<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Append, to Bede, numb. 10. ex edit. 1722. Spelm. Conc. p. 108, 109.</NOTE>: But the Saxons, receiving their
religion from Roman monks, were taught at the same
time a prosound reverence to that see, and were naturally
led to regard it as the capital of their religion. Pil∣grimages
<PB N="64" REF="74"/>
to Rome were represented as the most meritori∣ous
acts of devotion. Not only noblemen and ladies of
rank undertook this tedious journey<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap 7.</NOTE>; but Kings them∣selves,
abdicating their crowns, sought for a secure pass∣port
to heaven at the feet of the Roman pontiff. New
reliques, continually sent from that endless mint of super∣stition,
and magnified by lying miracles, invented in
convents, operated on the astonished minds of the multi∣tude:
And every prince attained the eulogies of the
monks, the only historians of those ages, not in p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opor∣tion
to his civil and military virtues, but to his devoted
attachment towards their order, and his superstitious re∣verence
for Rome.</P>
<P>THE sovereign pontiff, encouraged by this blindness
and submissive disposition of the people, advanced every
day in his enterprizes on the independance of the Eng∣lish
churches. Wilfrid, bishop of Lindisferne, the sole
prelate of the Northumbrian kingdom, gave the finish∣ing
stroke to this subjection in the eighth century, by his
making an appeal to Rome against the decisions of an
English synod, which had abridged his diocese by the
erection of some new bishoprics<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See Appendix to Bede, numb. 19. Higden, lib. 5. Matth. West. p. 124. Brompton, p. 793, 794.</NOTE>. Agatho, the pope,
readily embraced this precedent of an appeal to his court;
and Wilfrid, though the haughtiest and most luxurious
prelate of his age<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Eddius vita Vilfr, § 24, 60.</NOTE>, having obtained with the people the
character of sanctity, finally prevailed in the contest.</P>
<P>THE great topic, by which he confounded the imag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i∣nations
of men, was, that St. Peter, to whose custody
the keys of heaven were entrusted, would certainly re∣fuse
admittance to every one who had been wanting in
respect to his successor. This conceit, well calculated
for vulgar conceptions, had a powerful operation on the
<PB N="64" REF="75"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="65" REF="76"/>
people during several ages; and has not even at present
lost all influence in the catholic countries.</P>
<P>HAD this abject superstition produced general peace
and tranquillity, it had made some atonement for the ills
attending it; but, added to the usual avidity of men for
power and riches, it engendered frivolous controversies
in theology, which were so much the more fatal, as they
admitted not, like the others, of any final determination
from established possession. The disputes, excited in Bri∣tain,
were of the most ridiculous kind, and entirely wor∣thy
of those ignorant and barbarous ages. There were
some intricacies, observed by all the Christian churches,
in adjusting the day of keeping Easter; which depended
on a complicated consideration of the course of the sun
and moon: And it happened that the missionaries, who
had converted the Scots and Britains, had followed a dif∣ferent
calendar from what was observed at Rome in the
age when Augustine converted the Saxons. The priests
also of all the Christian churches were accustomed to shave
part of their head; but the form given to this stonsure,
was different in the former from what was practised in
the latter. The Scots and Britains pleaded the antiquity
of <HI>their</HI> usages: The Romans, and their disciples, the
Saxons, insisted on the universality of <HI>theirs.</HI> That Eas∣ter
must necessarily be kept by a rule, which compre∣hended
both the day of the year and age of the moon,
was agreed by all; that the shaving of a priest could not
be omitted without the utmost impiety, was a point un∣disputed:
But the Romans and Saxons called their anta∣gonists
schismatics; because they celebrated Easter on the
very day of the full moon in March, if that day fell on
a Sunday, instead of waiting till the Sunday following;
and because they shaved their whole forehead from ear to
ear, instead of making that tonsure on the crown of the
head, and in a circular form. In order to render their
<PB N="65" REF="77"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="66" REF="78"/>
antagonists odious, they affirmed, that once in seven
years they concurred with the Jews in the time of cele∣brating
that festival<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 19.</NOTE>: And that they might recommend
their own form of tonsure, they maintained, that it imi∣tated
symbolically the crown of thorns worn by our Savi∣our
in his passion; whereas the latter was invented by
Simon Magus, without any regard to that consideration<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 21. Eddius, § 24.</NOTE>.
These controversies had from the beginning excited such
animosity between the British and Romish priests, that,
instead of concurring in their endeavours to convert the
idolatrous Saxons, they refused all communion together,
and each regarded his opponent as no better than a Pa∣gan<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 2, 4, 20. Eddius, § 12.</NOTE>. The dispute lasted more than a century; and was
at last finished, not by mens perceiving the folly of it,
which would have been too great an effort for human rea∣son
to accomplish, but by the entire victory of the Ro∣mish
ritual over the Scots and British<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 16, 22.</NOTE>. Wilfrid, bishop
of Lindisferne, acquired great merit, both with the

<P>THEODORE, archbishop of Canterbury, called, in

decree of the Lateran council, summoned by Martin the
first, against the heresy of the Monothelites. The coun∣cil
and synod maintained, in opposition to these heretics,
that tho' the divine and human nature in Christ made but
one person; yet had they still different inclinations,
wills, acts, and sentiments, and that the unity of the
<PB N="67" REF="79"/>
person implied not any unity in the consciousness<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Spell. Conc. vol. 1. p. 171.</NOTE>
This opinion it seems somewhat difficult to comprehend;
and no one, unacquainted with the ecclesiastical history
of those ages, could imagine the height of zeal and vio∣lence
with which it was then inculcated. The decree of
the Lateran council calls the Monothelites impious, ex∣ecrable,
wicked, abominable, and even diabolical; and
curses and anathematizes them to all eternity<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Spell. Conc. vol. 1. p. 172, 173, 174.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Saxons, from the first introduction of Christiani∣ty
among them, had admitted the use of images; and
perhaps, Christianity, without some of those exterior or∣naments,
had not made so quick a progress with these
idolaters: But they had not paid any species of worship
or address to images; and this abuse never prevailed
among Christians, till it received the sanction of the se∣cond
council of Nice.</P>

<HEAD>EGBERT.</HEAD>
<P>THE kingdoms of the Heptarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II.</NOTE> tho' united by so
recent a conquest, seemed to be strongly cement∣ed
into one state under Egbert;<NOTE PLACE="marg">827.</NOTE> and the inhabitants of
the several provinces had lost all desire of revolting from
that conqueror, or of restoring their independant govern∣ments.
Their language was every where nearly the
same; their customs, laws, institutions civil and reli∣gious;
and as the race of their antient kings was totally
extinct in all their subjected states, the people readily
transferred their allegiance to a prince, who seemed to
merit it, by the splendor of his victories, the vigour of his
administration, and the superior nobility of his birth.
An union also in government opened to them the agree∣able
prospect of future tranquillity; and it appeared more
probable, that they would thenceforth become terrible to
their neighbours, than be exposed to their inroads and
<PB N="69" REF="81"/>
devastations. But these flattering views were soon over∣cast
by the appearance of the Danes, who, during some
centuries, kept the Anglo-Saxons in perpetual inquie∣tude,
committed the most barbarous ravages upon them,
and at last reduced them to the most grievous servi∣tude.</P>
<P>THE emperor Charlemagne, tho' naturally generous
and humane, had been induced by bigotry to exercise
great severities against the pagan Saxons in Germany,
whom he subdued; and besides often ravaging their coun∣try
by fire and sword, he had in cold blood decimated all
the inhabitants for their revolts, and had obliged them,
by the most rigorous edicts, to make a seeming compli∣ance
with the christian doctrine. That religion, which
had easily made its way among the British-Saxons by in∣sinuation
and address, appeared shocking to their Ger∣man
brethren, when imposed on them by the violence of
Charlemagne; and the most generous and warlike of
these pagans had fled northward into Jutland, in order to
escape the fury of his persecutions. Meeting there with
a people of similar manners, they were readily received
among them; and they soon stimulated the natives to
concur in enterprizes, which both promised revenge on
the haughty conquerors, and afforded subsistence to those
numerous inhabitants, with which the northern coun∣tries
were now overburthened<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neustria, p. 414.</NOTE>. They invaded the pro∣vinces
of France, which were exposed by the degeneracy
and dissentions of Charlemagne's posterity; and being
known there under the general name of Normans, which
they received from their northern situation, they became
the terror of all the maritime and even of the inland
countries. They were also tempted to visit England in
their frequent excursions; and being able by sudden in∣roads
<PB N="70" REF="82"/>
to make great progress over a people, who were
not defended by any naval force, who had relaxed their
military institutions, and who were sunk into a supersti∣tion,
which had become odious to the Danes and antient
Saxons, they made no distinction in their hostilities be∣tween
the French and English kingdoms. Their first
appearance in this island was in the year 787<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 6.</NOTE>, when
Brithric reigned in Wessex. A small body of them land∣ed
in that kingdom, with a view of learning the state of
the country; and when the magistrate of the place ques∣tioned
them concerning the reason of their enterprize,
and cited them to appear before the king, and account
for their intentions, they killed him, and flying to their
ships, escaped into their own country. The next alarm
was given no Northumberland in the year 794<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 66. Alur. Beverl. p. 108.</NOTE>; when a
body of these pirates pillaged a monastery; but their
ships being much damaged by a storm, and their leader
slain in a skirmish, they were at last defeated by the inha∣bitants,
and the remainder of them put to the sword.
Five years after Egbert had established his monarchy over
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">832</NOTE> the Danes landed in the Isle of Shepey, and
having pillaged it, escaped with impunity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 72. Mat. West. p. 155.</NOTE>. They were
not so fortunate in their next year's enterprize, when
they disembarked from thirty-five ships, and were en∣countered
by Egbert, at Charmouth in Dorsetshire.
The battle was bloody; but tho' the Danes lost great
numbers, they maintained the post, which they had ta∣ken,
and made good their retreat to their ships<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 72. Ethelward, lib. 3. cap. 2. Math. West. p. 155.</NOTE>. Hav∣ing
learned by experience, that they must expect a vigo∣rous
resistance from this warlike prince, they entered in∣to
an alliance with the Britains of Cornwal; and landing
two years after in that country, made an inroad with their
<PB N="71" REF="83"/>
confederates into the county of Devon; but were met at
Hengesdown by Egbert▪ and totally defeated<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 72.</NOTE>. While
England remained in this state of inquietude, and de∣fended
itself more by temporary expedients than by any
regular plan of administration, Egbert, who alone was
capable of providing effectually against this new evil, un∣fortunately
died; and left the government to his son
Ethelwolf.<NOTE PLACE="marg">838.</NOTE></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ETHELWOLF.</HEAD>
<P>THIS prince had neither the abilities nor vigour of his
father; and was better qualified for governing a con∣vent
than a kingdom<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 2.</NOTE>. He began his reign with dividing
his dominions, and delivering over to his eldest son,
Athelstan, the new conquered provinces of Essex, Kent,
and Sussex<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 2. Ethelward, lib. 3. cap. 3.</NOTE>. But no inconveniencies seem to have ari∣sen
from this partition; as the continual terror of the
Danish invasions prevented all domestic dissention. A
fleet of these ravagers, consisting of thirty-three sail, ap∣peared
at Southampton; but were repulsed with great
loss by Wol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here, governor of the neighbouring county<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 73. Ethelward, lib. 3. cap. 3. Math. West. p. 155.</NOTE>.
The same year, Aethelhelm, assisted by the inhabitants
of Dorsetshire, routed another band which had disem∣barked
at Portsmouth; but he obtained the victory after
a furious engagement, and he bought it with the loss of
his life<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 73. H. Hunt. lib. 5.</NOTE>. Next year, the Danes made several inroads
into England; and fought battles, or rather skirmishes,
in East-Anglia and Lindesey and Kent<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Math. West. 156.</NOTE>; where, tho'
they were sometimes repulsed and defeated, they always
<PB N="72" REF="84"/>
obtained their end of committing spoil upon the country,
and carrying off their booty. They avoided coming to a
general engagement, which was not suited to their plan
of operations. Their vessels were small, and ran easily
up the creeks and rivers; where they drew them ashore,
and having formed an entrenchment around them, which
they guarded with part of their number, they scattered
themselves every where, and carrying off the inhabitants,
and cattle, and goods, they hastened to their ships, and
suddenly disappeared. If the military force of the county
was assembled (for there was no time for troops to march
from a distance) the Danes either were able to repulse
them and to continue their ravages with impunity, or
they betook themselves to their vessels; and setting sail,
invaded suddenly some distant quarter, which was not
prepared for their reception. Every part of England was
held in continual alarm; and the inhabitants of one coun∣ty
dared not to give assistance to those of another, lest
their own family and property should in the mean time be
exposed by their absence to the fury of these barbarous ra∣vagers<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Alured Beverl. p. 108.</NOTE>. All orders of men were involved in this ruin;
and the priests and monks, who had been commonly
spared in the domestic quarrels of the heptarchy, were
the chief objects on which the Danish idolaters exercised
their rage and animosity. Every season of the year was
dangerous; and no man could esteem himself a moment
in safety, because of the absence of the enemy.</P>
<P>THESE incursions had now become almost annual;
when the Danes, encouraged by their successes against
France as well as England (for both kingdoms were
alike exposed to this dreadful calamity) invaded the last
in so numerous a body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">851.</NOTE> as seemed to threaten it with
<PB N="73" REF="85"/>
universal subjection. But the English, more military
than the Britains, whom, a few centuries before, they
had treated with like violence, rouzed themselves with a
vigour proportioned to the exigency. Ceorle, governor
of Devonshire, fought a battle with one body of the
Danes at Wiganburgh<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. lib. 5. Ethelwerd, lib. 3. cap. 3. Simeon. Dunelm. p. 120.</NOTE>, and put them to rout with
great slaughter. King Athelstan attacked another at sea
near Sandwich, sunk nine of their ships, and put the rest
to slight<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 74. Asserius, p. 2.</NOTE>. A body of them, however, ventured, for the
first time, to take up winter quarters in England; and
receiving in the spring a strong reinforcement of their
countrymen in 350 vessels, they advanced from the Isle
of Thanet, where they had stationed themselves; burnt
the cities of London<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 2.</NOTE> and Canterbury; and having put
to flight Brichtric, who now governed Mercia, under
the title of King, they marched into the heart of Surrey,
and laid every place waste around them<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Math. West. p. 157.</NOTE>. Ethelwolf,
excited by the urgency of the danger, marched against
them, at the head of the West-Saxons; and carrying
with him his second son, Ethelbald, gave them battle at
Okely, and gained a very bloody victory over them<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. 75. Asserius, p. 2.</NOTE>.
This advantage procured but a short respite to the English.
The Danes still maintained their settlement in the Isle of
Thanet; and being attacked by Ealher and Huda, go∣vernors
of Kent and Surrey, tho' defeated in the begin∣ning
of the action, they finally repulsed the assailants,
and killed both the governors<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 76. Asserius, p. 2. Simeon. Dun. p. 120.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">853.</NOTE> They removed thence
to the Isle of Shepey; where they took up their winter
quarters, that they might extend farther their devastation
and ravages.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="86"/>
THIS unsettled state of England hindered not Ethel∣wolf
from making a pilgrimage to Rome; whither he
carried his fourth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">854.</NOTE> and favourite son, Alfred, then only
six years of age<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Asserius, p. 2. Chron. Sax. 76. Hunt. lib. 5.</NOTE>. He passed there a twelvemonth in ex∣ercises
of devotion; and failed not in that most essential
part of devotion, liberality to the church of Rome. Be∣sides
giving presents to the most distinguished ecclesias∣tics;
he made a perpetual grant of three hundred mancu∣ses<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">A mancus was about the weight of our present half drown: See Spellman's Glossary, in verbo, Mancus.</NOTE> a year to that see; one third to support the lamps
of St. Peter's, another those of St. Paul's, and a third to
the pope himself<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 2.</NOTE>. In his return home, he married Ju∣dith,
daughter to the emperor, Charles the Bald<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Asserius, p. 2. Chron. Sax. p. 76. H. Hunt. lib. 5. Ethelwerd, lib. 3. cap. 3. Simeon. Dunelm. p. 140.</NOTE>;
but on his landing in England, he met with an opposi∣tion,
which he little looked for.</P>
<P>HIS eldest son, Athelstan, being dead; Ethelbald, the
second, who had assumed the government, formed, in
conjunction with many of the nobles, the project of ex∣cluding
his father from a throne, which his weakness and
superstition seem to have rendered him so ill qualified to
fill<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 2.</NOTE>. The people were divided between the two prin∣ces;
and a bloody civil war, joined to all the other cala∣mities,
under which the English laboured, appeared un∣avoidable;
when Ethelwolf had the facility to yield to
the greatest part of his son's pretensions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wigorn. p. 583.</NOTE>. He made with
him a partition of the kingdom; and taking to himself
the eastern part, which was always at that time esteemed
the least considerable, as well as the most exposed<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Asserius, p. 3. W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 2. Math. West. p. 158.</NOTE>, he
<PB N="75" REF="87"/>
delivered over to Ethelbald the sovereignty of the west∣ern.
And immediately after, he summoned the states of
the whole kingdom, and with the same facility, confer∣red
a perpetual and very important donation on the
church.</P>
<P>THE ecclesiastics, in those days of ignorance, made
very rapid advances in the acquisition of power and gran∣deur;
and inculcating the most absurd and most interest∣ed
doctrines, tho' they met sometimes, from the contrary
interests of the laity, with an opposition, which it re∣quired
time and address to overcome, they found no ob∣stacle
in their reason or understanding. Not content with
the donations of land made them by the Saxon princes
and nobles, and with the temporary oblations from, the
devotion of the people, they had cast a wishful eye on a
vast revenue, which they claimed as belonging to them
by a divine, indefeizable and inherent title. However
little versed in the scriptures, they had been able to disco∣ver,
that the priests, under the Jewish law, possessed a
tenth of all the produce of land; and forgetting what they
themselves taught, that the moral part only of that law
was obligatory on christians, they insisted, that this do∣nation
was a perpetual property, conferred by heaven on
those who officiated at the altar. During some centuries,
the whole scope of sermons and homilies was directed to
this purpose; and one would have imagined, from the
general tenor of these discourses, that all the practical
parts of christianity were comprehended in the exact and
faithful payment of tythes to the clergy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo, sopra beneficii ecclesiastici, p. 51, 52. Edit Colon. 1675.</NOTE>. Encouraged
by their success in inculcating these doctrines; they ven∣tured
farther than they were warranted even by the Le∣vitical
law, and pretended to draw the tenth of all indus∣try,
merchandize, wages of labourers, and pay of sol∣diers
<PB N="76" REF="88"/>
<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Spell. Conc. vol. i. p. 268.</NOTE>; nay, some canonists went so far as to affirm,
that the clergy were entitled to the tythe of the profits,
made by courtezans in the exercise of their profession<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo, p. 132.</NOTE>.
Tho' parishes had been instituted in England by Hono∣rius,
archbishop of Canterbury, near two centuries be∣fore<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Parker, p. 77.</NOTE>, the ecclesiastics had never yet been able to get pos∣session
of the tythes; and they therefore seized the present
favourable opportunity of making that acquisition; when
a weak, superstitious prince was on the throne, and
when the people, discouraged by their losses from the
Danes, and terrified with the fear of future invasions,
were susceptible of any impression, which bore the ap∣pearance
of religion. So meritorious was this concession
deemed by the English, that, trusting entirely to super∣natural
assistances, they neglected the ordinary means of
safety; and agreed, even in the present desperate extre∣mity,
that the revenue of the church should be exempted
from all burthens, tho' imposed for national defence and
security<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Asserius, p. 2. Chron. Sax. p. 76. W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 2. Ethelwerd, lib. 3. cap. 3. M. Weft. p. 158. Ingulf. p. 17. Ann. Beverl. p. 95.</NOTE>.</P>

seconded him in all his enterprizes; and generously sa∣crificed
to the public good all resentment, which he
might entertain, on account of his being excluded by
Ethered from a large patrimony, which had been left
him by his father.</P>
<P>THE first landing of the Danes in the reign of Ethe∣red
was among the East-Angles, who, more anxious for
their present interest than for the common safety, entered
into a separate treaty with the enemy; and furnished
them with horses, which enabled them to make an ir∣ruption
by land into the kingdom of Northumberland<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 5. Chron. Sax. p. 78. Ethelwerd. lib. 4. cap, 1. Simeon Dunelm. p. 141.</NOTE>.
They there seized the city of York; and defended it
against Osbricht, and Aella, two Northumbrian princes,
<PB N="78" REF="90"/>
who perished in the assault<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 6. Chron. Sax. p. 79. H. Hunt. lib. 5.</NOTE>. Encouraged by these suc∣cesses,
and by the superiority, which they had acquired in arms, they now ventured, under the command of Hinguar and Hubba, their chieftains, to leave the sea-coast,
and penetrating into Mercia, they took up their
winter-quarters at Nottingham, where they threatened
the kingdom with a final subjection. The Mercians ap∣plied
to Ethered for succour in this extremity; and that
prince with his brother, Alfred, conducting a great army
to Nottingham, obliged the enemy to dislodge from this
post,<NOTE PLACE="marg">870.</NOTE> and to retreat into Northumberland<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Their rest∣less
disposition and their avidity for plunder allowed them
not to remain long in these quarters: They broke into
East-Anglia, defeated and took prisoner, Edmund, the
King of that country, whom they afterwards cruelly
murdered in cold blood<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 4. W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 3. H. Hunt. lib. 5. Math. West. p. 164. Alur. Beverl. p. 102.</NOTE>; and committing
the most barbarous ravages on the people, particularly on the mo∣nasteries<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 80. Ingulf. p. 22, 23.</NOTE>, they gave the East-Angles great cause to re∣pent
of the temporary relief, which they had obtained, by assisting the common enemy.</P>
<P>THE next station of the Danes was at Reading;<NOTE PLACE="marg">871.</NOTE>
whence they infested the neighbouring country by their incursions<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 165.</NOTE> The Mercians, desirous of shaking off
their dependence on Ethered<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 3.</NOTE>, refused to join him with
their forces; and that prince, attended by Alfred, was
obliged to march against the enemy, with the West-Saxons

defeated in an action, shut themselves up in their garri∣son;
but quickly making thence an irruption, they

routed the West-Saxons, and raised the siege. An ac∣tion
soon after ensued at Aston<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hearne's notes to Spelman's life of Alfred, p. 41. Chron. Sax. p. 81. Ethelwerd, lib. 4. cap. 4.</NOTE>. in Berkshire, where
the English, in the beginning of the day, were in great
danger of a total defeat. Alfred, advancing with one
division of the army, was surrounded by the enemy in
disadvantageous ground; and Ethered, who was at that
time hearing mass, refused to march to his assistance, till
the prayers should be finished<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 7. W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 3. Flor. Wigorn. p. 586, 587. Simeon Dunelm. p. 125. Brompton, p. 808. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 205. Alur. Beverl. p. 102.</NOTE> But as he afterwards

where the Danes were more successful<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 7. Chron. Sax. p. 81.</NOTE> and being rein∣forced
by a new army from their own country, they be∣came
every day more terrible to the English. Amidst
these confusions, Ethered died of a wound, which he had

of literature. His genius was first rouzed by the recital
of Saxon poems, in which the Queen took delight; and
this species of erudition, which is able to make a con∣siderable

of the whole nation and the urgency of public affairs<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Simeon Dunelm. p. 127.</NOTE>,
he shook off his literary indolence, and exerted himself
in the defence of his people. He had scarce buried his
brother, when he was obliged to take the field, in order
<PB N="81" REF="93"/>
to oppose the Danes, who had seized Wilton, and were
exercising their usual ravages on the countries around.
He marched against them with the few troops, which he
could assemble on a sudden; and giving them battle,
gained at first an advantage, but by his pursuing the
victory too far, the superiority of the enemy's numbers
prevailed, and recovered them the day<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 8. Chron. Sax. p. 82. H. Hunt. lib. 5. Ethelwerd, lib. 4. cap. 3.</NOTE>. Their loss,
however, in the action was so considerable, that, fearing
Alfred would receive daily reinforcements from his fub∣jects,
they were contented to stipulate for a safe retreat,
and promised to depart the kingdom. For that purpose,
they were conducted to London, and allowed to take up
their winter-quarters there; but careless of their engage∣ments,
they immediately set themselves to the commit∣ting
spoil on the neighbouring country. Burrhed, King
of Mercia, in whose territories London was situated,
made a new stipulation with them<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 8. H. Hunt. lib. 5.</NOTE>, and engaged them,
by presents of money, to remove to Lindesey in Lin∣colnshire<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 168.</NOTE>; a country which they had already reduced
to ruin and desolation. Finding therefore no object in
that place, either for their rapine or violence, they sud∣denly
turned back upon Mercia, in a quarter where they
expected to find it without defence; and fixing their
station at Repton in Derbyshire<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 8.</NOTE>, they laid the whole
country desolate, with fire and sword. Burrhed, unable
to withstand an enemy, whom no force could resist, and
no treaties bind, abandoned his kingdom, and flying to
Rome, took shelter in a cloyster<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 8. Chron. Sax. p. 82. Ethelwerd, lib. 4. cap. 4. Flor. Wigorn. p. 589. Si∣meon Dunelm p. 127. Ann. Beverl. p. 96.</NOTE> He was brother-in-law to Alfred, and the last who bore the title of king in Mercia.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="94"/>
THE West-Saxons were now the only remaining
power in England; and tho' supported by the vigour and
abilities of Alfred, they were unable to sustain the efforts
of those ravagers, who from all quarters invaded them.
A new swarm of Danes came over this year under three
princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">875.</NOTE> Guthrum, Oscitel, and Amund<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 5.</NOTE>; and having
first joined their countrymen at Repton, they soon found
the necessity of separating, in order to provide for their
fubsistance. Part of them, under the command of Hal∣dene,
their chieftain<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 83.</NOTE>, marched into Northumberland,
where they fixed their residence<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 8. Chron. Sax. p. 83.</NOTE>; part of them took quarters at Cambridge<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 8. Chron. Sax. p. 83.</NOTE>, from whence they dislodged in
the ensuing summer, and seized Wereham, in the coun∣ty
of Dorset, the very center of Alfred's dominions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. lib. 5. M. West. p. 168.</NOTE>.
That prince so straitened them in these quarters, that
they were content to come to a treaty with him, and
stipulated to depart his country<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 83.</NOTE>. Alfred, well acquainted
with their usual perfidy, obliged them to swear upon the
holy reliques to the observance of the treaty<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 8.</NOTE>; not that
he expected they would pay any veneration to the re∣liques;
but he hoped, that, if they now violated this
oath, their impiety would infallibly draw down upon
them the vengeance of heaven. But the Danes, little
apprehensive of this danger, suddenly, without seeking
for any pretext, fell upon Alfred's army; and having
put it to rout, marched westward, and took, possession of
Exeter<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 8. Chron. Sax. p. 83. H. Hunt. lib. 5. Flor. Wigorn. p. 590.</NOTE>. The prince again collected new forces; and
exerted such vigour, that he fought in one year eight
battles against the enemy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 8. The Saxon Chronicle, p. 82. says nine battles.</NOTE>, and reduced them to the ut∣most
extremity. He hearkened however to new pro∣posals
<PB N="83" REF="95"/>
of peace; and was satisfied to stipulate with them,
that they would settle somewhere in England<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 9. Alur. Beverl. p. 104.</NOTE>, and
would not permit the entrance of more ravagers into the
kingdom. But while he was expecting the execution of
this treaty, which it seemed the interest of the Danes
themselves to fulfil, he heard that another body had
landed, and having collected all the scattered troops of
their countrymen, had surprised Chippenham, then a
considerable town, and were exercising their usual ra∣vages
all around them<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Asser, p. 9. H. Hunt. lib. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS last incident quite broke the spirit of the Saxons,
and reduced them to despair. Finding that, after all
the miserable havock, which they had undergone in their
persons and in their property; after all the vigorous ac∣tions,
which they had exerted in their own defence; a
new band, equally greedy of spoil and slaughter, had dis∣embarked
among them; they believed themselves aban∣doned
by heaven to destruction, and delivered over to
those swarms of robbers, which the fertile north thus in∣cessantly
poured forth against them. Some left their
country, and retired into Wales or fled beyond sea:
Others submitted to the conquerors, in hopes of ap∣peasing
their fury by a servile obedience<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 84. Alured Beverl. p. 105.</NOTE>: And every
man's attention being now engrossed in concern for his
own preservation, no one would hearken to the exhor∣tations
of the King, who summoned them to make, un∣der
his conduct, one effort more in defence of their
prince, their country, and their liberties. Alfred him∣self
was obliged to relinquish the ensigns of his dignity, to
dismiss his servants, and to seek shelter, in the meanest
disguises, from the pursuit and fury of his enemies. He
concealed himself under a peasant's habit, and lived some
time in the house of a neat-herd, who had been entrust∣ed
<PB N="84" REF="96"/>
with the care of some of his cows<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 9.</NOTE>. There passed
here an incident, which has been recorded by all the
historians, and was long preserved by popular tradition;
tho' it contains nothing memorable in itself, except so
far as every circumstance is interesting, which attends so
great virtue and dignity, reduced to such distress. The
wife of the neat-herd was ignorant of the condition of her royal guest; and observing him one day busy by the
sire-fide in trimming his bow and arrows, she desired him to take care of some cakes, which were toasting,
while she was employed elsewhere in other domestic af∣fairs.
But Alfred, whose thoughts were otherwise en∣gaged,
neglected this injunction; and the good woman,
on her return, finding her cakes all burnt, rated the
King very severely; and upbraided him, that he always
seemed very well pleased to eat her warm cakes, tho' he
was thus negligent in toasting them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 9. M. West. p. 170.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY degrees, Alfred, as he found the search of the ene∣my
become more remiss, collected some of his retainers,
and retired into the center of a bog, formed by the stag∣nating
waters of the Thone and Parret, in Somerset∣shire.
He here found two acres of firm ground; and
building a habitation on them, rendered himself secure
by its fortifications, and still more by the unknown and
inaccessible roads which led to it, and by the forests and
morasses, with which it was every way environed. This
place he called. Aethelingey, or the Isle of Nobles<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 85. W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4. Ethelwerd, lib. 4. cap. 4. Ingulf, p. 26.</NOTE>; and
it now bears the name of Athelney. He thence made
frequent and unexpected fallies upon the Danes, who
often felt the vigour of his arm, but knew not from what
quarter the blow came. He subsisted himself and his
followers by the plunder which he acquired; he procur∣ed
<PB N="85" REF="97"/>
them consolation by revenge; and from small succes∣ses,
he opened their minds to hope, that, notwithstand∣ing
his present misfortunes, more important victories
might at length attend his valour<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 170. Simeon Dunelm. p. 128.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALFRED lay here concealed, but not unactive, during
a twelvemonth; when the news of a prosperous event
reached his ears, and called him into the field. Hubba,
the Dane, having spread devastation, sire, and slaugh∣ter,
over all Wales, had landed in Devonshire from
twenty-three vessels, and laid siege to the castle of Kin∣with,
a place situated near the mouth of the small river
Tau<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 10.</NOTE>. Oddune, earl of Devonshire, with his follow∣ers,
had taken shelter there; and being ill supplied with
provisions, and even with water, he determined, by some
vigorous blow, to prevent the necessity of submitting to
the barbarous enemy<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Flor, Wigorn. 590.</NOTE>. He made a sudden sally on the
Danes before sun-rising; and taking them unprepared,
he put them to rout, pursued them with great slaughter,
killed Hubba himself, and got possession of the famous
<HI>Reaf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> or enchanted standard, in which the Danes put
great confidence<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 84. Abbas Rieval. p. 355. Alured Beverl. P. 105.</NOTE>. It contained the figure of a raven,
which had been inwove by the three sisters of Hinguar
and Hubba, with many magical incantations, and which,
by its different movements, prognosticated, as the Danes
believed, the good or bad success of any enterprise<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN Alfred observed this symptom of successful re∣sistance
in his subjects, he left his retreat; but before he
would assemble them in arms, or urge them to any at∣tempt,
which, if unfortunate, might, in their present
despondency, prove fatal, he resolved, himself, to in∣spect
the situation of the enemy, and to judge of the
probability of success. For this purpose, he entered their
<PB N="86" REF="98"/>
camp under the disguise of a harper, and passed unsus∣pected
thro' every quarter. He so entertained them with
his music and facetious humours, that he met with a
welcome reception; and was even introduced to Guth∣rum,
their prince's tent, where he remained some days<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4.</NOTE>.
He remarked the supine security of the Danes, their con∣tempt
of the English, their negligence in foraging and
plundering, and their dissolute wasting of what they
gained by rapine and violence. Encouraged by these
favourable appearances, he secretly sent out his emissa∣ries
to the most considerable of his subjects, and sum∣moned
them to a rendezvous, along with their warlike
followers, at Brixton, on the borders of Selwood forest<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 85.</NOTE>.
The English, who had hoped to put an end to their ca∣lamities
by servile submission, now found the insolence
and rapine of the conqueror more intolerable than all
their past fatigues and dangers; and at the appointed
day, they joyfully resorted to their prince. On his ap∣pearance
before them, they received him with shouts of
applause<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Asser, p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 85. Simeon Dunelm. p. 128. Alured Beverl. p. 105. Abbas Rieval. p. 354.</NOTE>; and could not satiate their eyes with the sight
of this beloved monarch, whom they had long regarded
as dead, and who now, with voice and looks expres∣sing
his confidence of success, called them to liberty and
vengeance. He instantly conducted them to Edding∣ton,
where the Danes were encamped; and taking ad∣vantage
of his previous knowledge of the place, he di∣rected
his attack against the most unguarded quarter of the enemy.
The Danes, surprised to see an army of Eng∣lish,
whom they considered as totally subdued, and still
more astonished to hear Alfred was at their head, made
but a faint resistance, notwithstanding their superiority
of number▪ and were soon put to flight with great slaugh∣ter
<PB N="87" REF="99"/>
<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 85. Ethelwerd, lib. 4. cap. 4.</NOTE>. The remainder of the routed army, with their
prince, was besieged by Alfred in a fortified place, to
which they fled; but being reduced to extremity by want
and hunger. they had recourse to the clemency of the
victor, and offered to submit on any conditions<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Asser, p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 85. Alured Beverl. p. 105.</NOTE> The
King, no less generous than brave, gave them their
lives; and even formed a scheme for converting them,
from mortal enemies, into faithful subjects and confe∣derates.
He knew, that the kingdoms of East-Anglia
and Northumberland were left totally desolate by the
frequent inroads of the Danes; and he now purposed to
re-people them by settling there Guthrum and his fol∣lowers.
He hoped that the new planters would at last
betake themselves to industry, when, by reason of his
resistance, and the exhausted condition of the country,
they could no longer subsist by plunder; and that they
might serve him as a rampart against any future incur∣sions
of their countrymen. But before he ratified these
mild conditions with the Danes, he required, that they
should give him one pledge of their submission, and of
their inclination to coalesce with the English, by de∣claring
their conversion to Christianity<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 85.</NOTE>. Guthrum and
his army had no aversion to this proposal; and, without
much instruction, or argument, or conference, they were
all admitted to baptism. The King answered for Guth∣rum
at the font, gave him the name of Athelstan, and
received him as his adoptive fon<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 90.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE success of this expedient seemed to correspond
to Alfred's hopes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">880.</NOTE> The greater part of the Danes settled
peaceably in their new quarters<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 11. Chron. Sax. p. 86. Simeon Dunelm. p. 129. Alu∣red Beverl. p. 106.</NOTE>: Some smaller bodies
<PB N="88" REF="100"/>
of the same nation, which were dispersed in Mercia,
were distributed into the five cities of Darby, Leicester,
Stamford, Lincoln, and Nottingham, and were thence
called the Fis or Five-Burgers. The more turbulent and
unquiet made an expedition into France under the com∣mand
of Hastings<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4. Ingulf, p. 26.</NOTE> and except a short incursion of
Danes, who sailed up the Thames and landed at Ful∣ham,
but suddenly retreated to their ships, on finding
the country in a posture of defence<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 86. Alured Beverl. p. 106.</NOTE>, Alfred was not for some years infested with the ravages of these barbari∣ans<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King employed this interval of tranquillity in
restoring order to the state, which had been shaken by so
many violent convulsions, in establishing civil and mili∣tary
institutions, in composing the minds of men to in
dustry and justice, and in providing against the return of
like calamities. He was, more properly than his grand∣father
Egbert, the sole monarch of the English, (for so
the Saxons were now universally called) because the
kingdom of Mercia was at last incorporated in his state,
and was governed by Ethelbert, his brother-in-law, who
bore the title of earl: And tho' the Danes, who peo∣pled
East-Anglia and Northumberland, were, for some
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, ruled immediately by their own princes, they all
acknowledged a subordination to Alfred, and submitted
to his superior authority. As equality among subjects is
the great source of concord, Alfred gave the same laws
to the Danes and English, and put them entirely on the
same footing in the administration both of civil and cri∣minal
justice. The fine for the murder of a Dane was
the same with that for the murder of an Englishman; the great symbol of equality in those ages.</P>

THE King, after rebuilding the ruined cities, parti∣cularly
London<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 15. Chron. Sax. p. 88. M. West. p 171. Simeon Dunelm. p. 131. Brompton, p. 812. Alured Beverl. ex edit. Hearne, p. 106.</NOTE>, which had been destroyed by the Danes
in the reign of Ethelwolf, established a regular militia for
the defence of the kingdom. He took care that all his
people should be armed and registered; he assigned them
a regular rotation of duty; he distributed part into the
castles and fortresses, which he erected at proper places<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 18. Ingulf, p. 27.</NOTE>;
he required another part to take the field on any alarm,
and to assemble at stated places of rendezvous; and he
left a sufficient number at home, who were employed in
the cultivation of the land, and who afterwards took their turn in military service<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 92, 93.</NOTE>. The whole kingdom was
like one great garrison; and the Danes could no sooner
appear in one place, than a sufficient number was assem∣bled
to oppose them, without leaving the other quarters defenceless or difarmed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Spelman's life of Alfred, p. 147. edit. 1709.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT Alfred, sensible that the proper method of op∣posing
an enemy, who made incursions by sea, was to
meet them on their own element, took care to provide
himself with a naval power<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 9. M. West. p. 179.</NOTE>, which, tho' the most na∣tural
defence of an island, had hitherto been totally ne∣glected
by the English. He encreased the shipping of his
kingdom both in number and force, and trained his sub∣jects
in the practice, as well of sailing, as of naval ac∣tion.
He distributed his armed vessels in proper stations
around the island, and was sure to meet the Danish
ships either before or after they had landed their troops,
and to pursue them in all their incursions. Tho' the
Danes might suddenly, by surprize, disembark on the
coast, which was generally become desolate by their fre∣quent
ravages, they were encountered by the English
<PB N="90" REF="102"/>
fleet in their retreat; and escaped not, as formerly, by
abandoning their booty, but paid, by their total destruc∣tion,
the penalty of the disorders which they had com∣mitted.</P>
<P>IN this manner, Alfred repelled several inroads of these
pyratical Danes, and maintained his kingdom, during
some years, in safety and tranquillity. A fleet of a hun∣dred
and twenty ships of war were stationed upon the
coast; and being provided of warlike engines, as well as of
expert seamen, both Frisians and English, (for Alfred
supplied the defects of his own subjects by engaging able
foreigners in his service) maintained a superiority above
those smaller bands, with which England had been so
often infested<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. II. Chron. Sax. p. 86, 87. M. West. p. 176.</NOTE>. But at last Hastings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">893.</NOTE> the famous Danish
chieftain, having ravaged all the provinces of France,
along the sea-coast or the rivers of the Loire and Seine,
and being obliged to quit that country, more by the de∣solation
which he himself had occasioned, than by the
resistance of the inhabitants, appeared off the coast of
Kent with a fleet of 330 sail. The greater part of the
enemy disembarked in the Rother, and seized the fort of
Apuldore. Hastings himself, commanding a fleet of
eighty sail, entered the Thames<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 91, 92. H. Hunt. lib. 5.</NOTE>, and fortifying Milton
in Kent, began to spread his forces over the country,
and to commit the most destructive ravages. But Al∣fred,
on the first alarm of this descent, flew to the de∣fence
of his people, at the head of a select band of sol∣diers,
whom he always kept about his own person<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 19.</NOTE>;
and gathering to him the armed militia from all quarters,
appeared in the field with a force superior to the ene∣my
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 92.</NOTE>. All straggling parties, whom necessity or love of
plunder had drawn to a distance from their chief encamp∣ment,
<PB N="91" REF="103"/>
were cut off by the English<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 92.</NOTE>; and these pyrates,
instead of encreasing their spoil, found themselves cooped
up in their fortifications<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wigorn. p. 595.</NOTE>, and obliged to subsist by the
plunder which they had brought from France. Tired
of this situation, which must in the end prove ruinous
to them, the Danes at Apuldore rose suddenly from their
encampment, with an intention of marching towards
the Thames, and passing over into Essex: But they
escaped not the vigilance of Alfred, who encountered
them at Farnham, put them to rout<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 93. Flor. Wigorn. p. 595.</NOTE>, seized all their
horses and baggage, and chaced the runaways on board
their ships, which carried them up the Colne to Mersey
in Essex, where they entrenched themselves. Hastings,
at the same time, and probably by concert, made a like
move<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt; and deserting Milton, took possession of
Bamflete, near the isle of Canvey in the same county<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 93.</NOTE>;
where he hastily threw up fortifications for his defence
against the power of Alfred.</P>
<P>UNFORTUNATELY for the English, Gothrun, prince
of the East-Anglian Danes, had died; as had also Guth∣red,
whom the King had appointed governor of the Nor∣thumbrians;
and these restless tribes being no longer re∣strained
by the authority of their princes, and being en∣couraged
by the appearance of so great a body of their
countrymen, broke into rebellion, shook off the autho∣rity
of Alfred, and yielding to their inveterate habits of
war and depredation<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 92.</NOTE>, embarked on board two hundred
and forty vessels<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wigorn. p. 596.</NOTE>, and appeared before Exeter in the
west of England. Alfred lost not a moment in opposing
this new enemy. Having left some forces at London to
make head against Hastings and the other Danes, he
marched suddenly to the west<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 93. H. Hunt. lib. 5.</NOTE>; and falling on the rebels
<PB N="92" REF="104"/>
before they were aware, pursued them to their ships with
great slaughter. The enemy, sailing next to Sussex, be∣gan
to plunder the country near Chichester; but the
order, which Alfred had every where established, suf∣ficed
here, without his presence, for the defence of the
place; and the rebels, meeting with a new repulse,
where many of them were killed, and some of their ships
taken<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 96. Flor. Wigorn. p. 596.</NOTE>, were obliged to put again to sea, and were dis∣couraged
from attempting any other enterprize.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Danish invaders in Essex, having
united their force under the command of Hastings, ad∣vanced
into the inland country, and made spoil of all
around them; but had soon reason to repent of their te∣merity.
The English army, left in London, assisted by
a body of the citizens, attacked the enemy's entrench∣ments
at Bamflete, overpowered the garrison, and hav∣ing
executed great slaughter upon them, carried off the
wife and two sons of Hastings<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 94. M. West. p. 178.</NOTE>. Alfred generously
spared these captives; and even restored them to Hast∣ings
<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 179.</NOTE>, on condition that he should depart the king∣dom.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the King had thus honourably rid himself
of this dangerous enemy, he had not entirely subdued or
expelled the invaders. The pyratical Danes willingly
followed in an excursion any prosperous leader, who
gave them hopes of booty, but were not so easily en∣gaged
to relinquish their enterprize, or submit to return
baffled, and without plunder, into their native country.
Great numbers of them, after Hastings's departure, seiz∣ed
and fortified Shobury at the mouth of the Thames;
and having left a garrison there, they coasted along the
river, till they came to Boddington in the county of Glo∣cester;
where, being reinforced by some Welsh, they
<PB N="93" REF="105"/>
threw up entrenchments, and prepared for their defence.
The King here surrounded them with the whole force of
his dominions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 94.</NOTE>; and as he had now a certain prospect of
victory, he resolved to trust nothing to chance, but ra∣ther
to master his enemies by famine than assault. They
were reduced to such extremities, that, having eat their
own horses, and having many of them perished with
hunger<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 94. M. West. p. 179. Flor. Wigorn. p. 596.</NOTE>, they made a desperate sally upon the English;
and tho' the greater number fell in the action, a con∣siderable
body made their escape<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 95.</NOTE>. These roved about
for some time in England, still pursued by the vigilance
of Alfred; they attacked Leicester with success, defend∣ed
themselves in Hartford, and then fled to Quatford;
where they were finally broken and subdued. The small
remains of them either dispersed themselves among their
countrymen in Northumberland and East-Anglia<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 97.</NOTE>, or
had recourse again to the sea, where they exercised py∣racy,
under the command of Sigefert, a Northumbrian.
This free-booter, well acquainted with Alfred's naval pre∣parations,
had framed vessels of a new construction,
higher, and longer, and swifter, than those of the Eng∣lish:
But the King soon showed him his superior skill,
by building vessels still higher, and longer, and swifter,
than those of the Northumbrians<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 98. H. Hunt. lib. 5. Alur. Beverl. p. 107.</NOTE>; and falling upon
them, while they were exercising their ravages in the
west, he took twenty of their ships; and having tried all
the prisoners at Winchester, he hanged them as pyrates,

with the excellent posture of defence, established every
where, restored full tranquillity in England, and pro∣vided
<PB N="94" REF="106"/>
for the future security of the government. The
East-Anglian and Northumbrian Danes, on the first ap∣pearance
of Alfred upon their frontiers, made anew the
most humble submissions to him; and he thought it pru∣dent
to take them under his immediate government,
without establishing over them a viceroy of their own
nation<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wigorn. p. 598.</NOTE>. The Welsh also acknowledged his authority;
and this great prince had now, by prudence and justice
and valour, established his sovereignty over all the sou∣thern
parts of the island, from the English channel to
the frontiers of Scotland: When he died, in the vigour
of his age and the full strength of his faculties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">901.</NOTE> after a
glorious reign of twenty-nine years and a half<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 21. Chron. Sax. p. 99.</NOTE>; in
which he deservedly attained the appellation of Alfred
the Great, and the title of Founder of the English mo∣narchy.</P>
<P>THE merit of this prince, both in private and public
life, may with advantage be set in opposition to that
of any monarch or citizen, which the annals of any age
or any nation, can present to us. He seems indeed to
be the complete model of that perfect character, which,
under the denomination of a sage or wise man, the phi∣losophers
have been fond of delineating, rather as a fic∣tion
of their imagination, than in hopes of ever seeing
it reduced to practice: So happily were all his virtues
tempered together; so justly were they blended; and so
powerfully did each prevent the other from exceeding its
proper bounds! He knew how to conciliate the most
enterprizing spirit with the coolest moderation; the most
obstinate perseverance with the easiest flexibility; the
most severe justice with the greatest lenity; the greatest
vigour in command with the greatest affability of
de∣portment<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 13.</NOTE>; the highest capacity and inclination for sci∣ence
<PB N="95" REF="107"/>
with the most shining talents for action. His civil
and his military virtues are almost equally the objects of
our admiration; excepting only, that the former, being
more rare among princes, as well as more useful, seem
chiefly to challenge our applause. Nature also, as if de∣sirous,
that so bright a production of her skill should be
set in the fairest light, had bestowed on him all bodily
accomplishments, vigour of limbs, dignity of shape and
air, and a pleasant, engaging and open countenance<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 5.</NOTE>.
Fortune alone, by throwing him into that barbarous
age, deprived him of historians worthy to transmit his
fame to posterity; and we wish to see him delineated
in more lively colours, and with more particular strokes,
that we may at least perceive some of those small specks
and blemishes, from which, as a man, it is impossible
he could be entirely exempted.</P>
<P>BUT we should give but an imperfect idea of Alfred's
merit, were we to confine our narration to his military
exploits, and were not more particular in our account of
his institutions for the execution of justice, and of his
zeal for the encouragement of arts and sciences.</P>
<P>AFTER Alfred had subdued and settled or expelled
the Danes, he found the kingdom in the most wretched
condition; lying in desolation from the ravages of those
barbarians, and thrown into disorders, which were cal∣culated
to perpetuate its misery. Tho' the great armies
of the Danes were broke, the country was full of strag∣gling
troops of that nation, who, being accustomed to
live by plunder, were become incapable of industry, and
who, from the natural ferocity of their manners, indulg∣ed
themselves in the commission of violence, even be∣yond
what was requisite to supply their necessities. The
English themselves, reduced to the most extreme indi∣gence
by these continued depredations, had shaken off
<PB N="96" REF="108"/>
all bands of government; and those who had been plun∣dered
to-day, betook themselves to a like disorderly life,
and from despair joined next day the robbers in pillaging
and ruining their fellow-citizens<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4. M. West. p. 177.</NOTE> These were the
evils, for which it was necessary that the vigilance and
activity of Alfred should provide a remedy.</P>
<P>THAT he might render the execution of justice strict
and regular, he divided all England into counties; these
counties he subdivided into hundreds; and the hundreds
into tythings<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4. Ingulf. p. 28. Brompton, p. 818. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 22.</NOTE>. Every householder was answerable for
the behaviour of his family, and his slaves, and even of
his guests, if they lived above three days in his house<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Leg. St. Edw. cap. 27.</NOTE>.
Ten neighbouring householders were formed into one
corporation, who, under the name of a tything, decen∣nary,
or fribourg, were answerable for each other's con∣duct,
and over whom one person, called a tything-man,
headbourg, or borsholder, was appointed to preside.
Every man was punished as an outlaw, who did not re∣gister
himself in some tything<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 28.</NOTE>: and no man could
change his habitation, without a warrant and certificate
from the borsholder of the tything, to which he formerly
belonged.</P>
<P>WHEN any person in any tything or decennary was
guilty of a crime, the borsholder was summoned to an∣swer
for him; and if he was not willing to be surety for
his appearance and his clearing himself, the criminal
was committed to prison, and there detained till his trial.
If he fled, either before or after finding sureties, the
borsholder and decennary became liable to enquiry, and
were exposed to the penalties of law<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4.</NOTE>. Thirty-one days
were allowed them for producing the criminal; and if
that time elapsed without their being able to find him,
<PB N="97" REF="109"/>
the borsholder, with two other members of the decenna∣ry,
was obliged to appear, and together with three chief
members of the three neighbouring decennaries (making
twelve in all) to swear that his decennary was free from
all privity both of the crime committed, and of the escape
of the criminal. If the borsholder could not find such a
number to answer for their innocence, the decennary
was compelled by fine to make satisfaction to the King,
according to the degree of the crime<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Leges St. Edw. cap. 20. apud Wilkins, p. 202.</NOTE>. By this institu∣tion
every man was obliged from his own interest to keep
a watchful eye over the conduct of his neighbours; and
was in a manner surety for the behaviour of those who
were placed under the division, to which he belonged:
Whence these decennaries received the name of frank∣pledges.</P>
<P>SUCH a regular distribution of the people, and such a
strict consinement in their habitation, may not be neces∣sary
in times, when men are more enured to obedience
and justice, and might perhaps be regarded as destructive
of liberty and commerce in a polished state; but were
well calculated to reduce these fierce and licentious peo∣ple
under the salutary restraint of law and government.
But Alfred took care to temper these rigours by other in∣stitutions favourable to the freedom and security of the
citizens; and nothing could be more popular and liberal
than his plan for the administration of justice. The bors∣holder
summoned together his whole decennary to assist
him in deciding any lesser differences, which occurred
among the members of this small community. In affairs
of greater moment, in appeals from the decennary, or in
controversies arising between members of different decen∣naries,
the cause was brought before the hundred, which
consisted of ten decennaries, or a hundred families of free-men,
and which was regularly assembled once in four
<PB N="98" REF="110"/>
weeks, for the deciding of causes<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Leg Edw. cap. 2.</NOTE>. Their method of
decision deserves to be noted; as being the origin of ju∣ries;
an institution, admirable in itself, and the best cal∣culated
for the preservation of liberty and the administra∣tion
of justice, that ever was devised by the wit of man.
Twelve freeholders were chosen; who having sworn,
together with the hundreder or presiding magistrate of
that division, to administer impartial justice<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Faedus Alfred, and Gothurn, apud Wilkins. cap. 3. p. 47. Leg. Ethelstani, cap. 2. apud Wilkins, p. 58. LL. Ethelr. § 4. Wilkins, p. 117.</NOTE>, proceeded
to the examination of that cause, which was submitted to
their jurisdiction. And beside these monthly meetings of
the hundred, there was an annual meeting, appointed
for a more general inspection of the police of the district;
the enquiry into crimes, the correction of abuses in ma∣gistrates,
and the obliging every person to shew the de∣cennary
in which he was registered. The people, in
imitation of their ancestors, the antient Germans, assem∣bled
there in arms; whence a hundred was sometimes
called a wapentake, and its court served both for the
support of military discipline, and for the administration
of civil justice<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Spellman in voce Wapentake.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE next superior court to that of the hundred was
the county-court, which met twice a year after Michael∣mas
and Easter, and consisted of all the freeholders of the
county, who possessed an equal vote in the decision of
causes. The bishop presided in this court, together with
the alderman; and the proper object of the court was the
receiving appeals from the hundreds and decennaries, and
the deciding such controversies as arose between men of
different hundreds. Formerly, the alderman possessed
both the civil and military authority; but Alfred, sen∣sible
that this coalition of powers rendered the nobility
<PB N="99" REF="111"/>
dangerous and independant, appointed also a sheriff in
each county; who enjoyed a co-ordinate authority with
the former in the judicial function<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ingulf. p. 870.</NOTE>. His office also em∣powered
him to guard the rights of the crown in the
county; and to levy the fines imposed; which in that
age formed no contemptible part of the public revenue.</P>
<P>THERE lay an appeal, in default of justice, from all
these courts to the King himself in council; and as the
people, sensible of the equity and great talents of Alfred,
placed their chief confidence in him, he was soon over∣whelmed
with appeals from all parts of England. He
was indefatigable in the dispatch of these causes<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 20.</NOTE>; but
finding that his time must be entirely engrossed by this
branch of duty, he resolved to obviate the inconvenience,
by correcting the ignorance or corruption of the inferior
magistrates, from which it arose<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 18. 21. Flor. Wigorn. p. 594. Abbas Rieval, p. 355.</NOTE>. He took care to
have his nobility instructed in letters and the laws<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wigorn. p. 594. Brompton, p. 814.</NOTE>: He
chose the earls and sheriffs from among the men most ce∣lebrated
for probity and knowledge: He punished severe∣ly
all malversation in office<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Le Miroir de Justice, chap. 2.</NOTE>: And he removed all the
earls, whom he found unequal to the trust<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 20.</NOTE>; allowing
only some of the most elderly to serve by a depute, till
their death should make room for more worthy successors.</P>
<P>THE better to guide the magistrates in the administra∣tion
of justice, Alfred framed a body of laws; which,
tho' now lost, served long as the basis of English juris∣prudence,
and is generally esteemed the origin of what is
denominated the COMMON LAW. He appointed regular
meetings of the states of England twice a year in Lon∣don<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Le Miroir de Justice.</NOTE>; a city which he himself had repaired and beauti∣fied
<PB N="100" REF="112"/>
and which he thus rendered the capital of the king∣dom.
The similarity of many of these institutions to the
customs of the antient Germans, to the practice of the
other northern conquerors, and to the Saxon laws during
the Heptarchy, prevents us from regarding Alfred as the
sole author of this plan of government; and leads us ra∣ther
to think, that, like a wise man, he contented him∣self
with reforming, extending, and executing the insti∣tutions,
which he found previously established. But on
the whole, such success attended his legislation, that eve∣ry
thing bore suddenly a new face in England: Rob∣beries
and iniquities of all kinds were repressed by the pu∣nishment
or reformation of the criminals<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 27.</NOTE>: And so exact
was the general police, that Alfred, it is said, hung up,
by way of bravado, golden bracelets near the high∣ways;
and no man dared to touch them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 4. M. West. p. 177. Brompton, p. 818.</NOTE>. Yet amidst
these rigours of justice, this great prince preserved the
most sacred regard to the liberty of his people; and it is a
memorable sentiment preserved in his will, that it was
just the English should for ever remain as free as their
own thoughts<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As good morals and knowledge are almost inseparable,
in every age, tho' not in every individual; the care of
Alfred for the encouragement of learning among his sub∣jects
was another useful branch of his legislation, and
tended to reform the English from their former dissolute
and barbarous manners: But the King was guided in this
pursuit less by political views, than by his natural bent
and propensity towards letters. When he came to the
throne, he found the English sunk into the grossest igno∣rance
and barbarism, proceeding from the continued dis∣orders
in the government, and from the ravages of the Danes: The monasteries were destroyed, the monks
<PB N="101" REF="113"/>
butchered or dispersed, their libraries burnt; and thus
the only seats of erudition in those ages were totally sub∣verted<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 18.</NOTE>. Alfred himself complains, that on his acces∣sion
he knew not one person, south of the Thames, who
could so much as interpret the Latin service; and very
few in the northern parts, who had reached even that
pitch of erudition<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 25.</NOTE>. But this prince invited over the
most celebrated scholars from all parts of Europe<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 167. Chron. Abb. de St. Petri de Burgo, p. 21.</NOTE>;
he established schools every where for the instruction of
his people; he founded, or at least repaired<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 16. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 207.</NOTE> the univer∣sity
of Oxford, and endowed it with many privileges, re∣venues
and immunities; he enjoined by law all freehold∣ers
possessed of two hydes<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">A hyde contained land sufficient to employ one plough. See H. Hunting. lib. 6. in A. D. 1008. Annal Waverl. in A. D. 1083. Gervase of Tilbury says it commonly contained about 100 acres.</NOTE> of land or more to send their
children to school for their instruction<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Abbas Rieval∣lensis, apud Spel.</NOTE>; he gave prefer∣ment
both in church and state to such only as had made
some proficiency in knowledge<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE>: And by all these expe∣dients
he had the pleasure, before his death, to see a great
change on the face of affairs, and in a work of his,
which is still extant, he congratulates himself on the
progress, which learning, under his patronage, had al∣ready
made in England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 26, 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the most effectual expedient, employed by Al∣fred,
for the encouragement of learning, was his own
example, and the constant assiduity, with which, not∣withstanding
the multitude and urgency of his affairs, he
employed himself in the pursuits of knowledge. He usually
divided his time into three equal portions; one was employed in sleep, and the refection of his body by
<PB N="102" REF="114"/>
diet and exercise; another in the dispatch of business; a
third in study and devotion: And that he might more
exactly measure the hours, he made use of burning ta∣pers
of equal lengths, which he fixed in lanthorns<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 20. W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4. Ingulf. p. 870. Flor. Wigorn. p. 594. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 22. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 208.</NOTE>; an
expedient suited to that rude age, when the geometry of
dialling and the mechanism of clocks and watches were
totally unknown. And by such a regular distribution of
his time, tho' he often laboured under great bodily infir∣mities
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 4. 12, 13. 17. M. West. p. 167. Flor. Wigorn. p. 588.</NOTE>, this martial hero, who fought in person fifty-six
battles by sea and land<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 4. cap. 4.</NOTE>, was able, during a life of no ex∣traordinary
length, to acquire more knowledge, and even
to compose more books, than most studious men, tho'
blest with the greatest leisure and application, have, in
more fortunate ages, made the object of their uninter∣rupted
industry.</P>
<P>SENSIBLE, that the people, at all times, especially
when their understandings are obstructed by ignorance
and bad education, are not much susceptible of speculative
instruction, Alfred endeavoured to convey his morality
by apologues, parables, stories, apophthegms, couched
in poetry; and besides propagating among his subjects,
former compositions of that kind, which he found in the
Saxon tongue<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 13. Flor. Wigorn. 598.</NOTE>, he exercised his vein in inventing works
of a like nature<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Spelman, p. 124. Abbas. Rieval. p. 355. Ann. Beverl. p. 96.</NOTE>, as well as in translating from the
Greek the elegant fables of Aesop. He also gave Saxon
translations of Orosius's and Bede's histories; and of Bo∣ethius
concerning the consolation of philosophy<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4. Brompton, p. 814.</NOTE>. And
he deemed it nowise derogatory from his other great
characters of sovereign, legislator, warrior, and poli∣tician,
<PB N="103" REF="115"/>
thus to lead the way to his people in the pursuits
of literature.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, this prince was not negligent in en∣couraging
the vulgar and mechanical arts, which have a
more sensible, tho' not a closer connexion with the inte∣rests
of society. He invited, from all quarters, industri∣ous
foreigners to re-people his country, which had been
laid desolate by the ravages of the Danes<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 13. Flor. Wigorn. p. 588.</NOTE>. He introdu∣ced
and encouraged manufactures of all kinds; and no
inventor or improver of any ingenious art did he suffer to
go unrewarded<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 20.</NOTE>. He prompted men of activity to be∣take
themselves to navigation, to push commerce into
the most disstant countries, and to acquire riches by pro∣pagating
industry among their fellow-citizens. He set
apart a seventh part of his own revenue for the maintain∣ing
a number of workmen, whom he constantly employ∣ed
in rebuilding his ruined cities, castles, palaces, and
monasteries<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Asser. p. 20. W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4. Flor. Wigorn. p. 594.</NOTE>. Even the elegancies of life were brought
to him from the Mediterranean and the Indies<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4.</NOTE>; and his
subjects, by seeing these productions of the peaceful arts,
were taught to respect the virtues of justice and industry,
from which alone they could arise. Both living and
dead, Alfred was regarded, by foreigners no less than
his own subjects, as the greatest prince after Charle∣magne
who had appeared in Europe during several ages,
and as one of the wisest and best who had ever adorned
the annals of any nation.</P>
<P>ALFRED had, by his wife, Ethelswitha, the daughter
of a Mercian earl, three sons and three daughters. The
eldest son, Edmund, died without issue, in his father's
lifetime. The third, Ethelward, inherited his father's
<PB N="104" REF="116"/>
passion for letters, and lived a private life. The second,
Edward, succeeded to his power; and passes by the ap∣peliation
of Edward the Elder, being the first of that
name who sat on the English throne.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EDWARD the Elder.</HEAD>
<P>THIS prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">901.</NOTE> who equalled his father in military ta∣lents,
tho' inferior to him in knowledge and erudi∣tion<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 5. Hoveden, p. 421.</NOTE>, found immediately, on his accession, a specimen
of that turbulent life, which attended all princes, and
even all individuals, in an age when men, less restrained
by justice or law, and less occupied by industry, had no
other aliment for their inquietude, but wars, insur∣rections,
convulsions, rapine, and depredation. Ethel∣wald,
his cousin-german, son to King Ethelbert, the
elder brother of Alfred, insisted on his preferable right to
the throne<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 99, 100.</NOTE>; and arming his partizans, took possession
of Winburne, where he seemed determined to defend
himself to the last extremity, and to await the issue of his
pretensions<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 100. H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 352.</NOTE>. But when the King approached the town
with a great army, Ethelwald, having the prospect of
certain destruction, made his escape, and fled first into
Normandy, and thence into Northumberland<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 832.</NOTE>; where
he hoped, that the people, who had been recently
subdued by Alfred, and who were impatient of peace,
would, on the intelligence of that great prince's death,
seize the first pretence or opportunity of rebellion. The
event did not disappoint his expectations: The North∣umbrians
declared for him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 100. H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 352.</NOTE>; and Ethelwald, having thus
connected his interest with the Danish. tribes, made an
<PB N="105" REF="117"/>
excursion beyond sea, and collecting a body of these free∣booters,
he excited the hopes of all those who had been
accustomed to subsist by rapine and violence<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 100. Chron. Abb. St. Petry de Burgo, p. 24.</NOTE>. The East-Anglian
Danes joined his party: The Five-burgers, who
were seated in the heart of Mercia, began to put them∣selves
in motion; and the English found that they were
again menaced with those convulsions, from which the
valour and policy of Alfred had so lately redeemed them.
The rebels, headed by Ethelwald, made an incursion in∣to
the counties of Glocester, Oxford, and Wilts; and
having exercised their ravages in these places, they re∣tired
with their booty, before the King, who had assem∣bled
his army, was able to approach them. Edward,
however, who was determined that his preparations
should not be fruitless, conducted his forces into East-Anglia,
and retaliated the injuries which the inhabitants
had committed, by spreading the like devastation among
them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 352. Brompton, p. 832.</NOTE>. Being satiated with revenge, and loaded with
booty, he gave orders to retire: But the authority of
these antient Kings, which was feeble in peace, was not
much better obeyed in the field; and the Kentish men,
greedy of more spoil, ventured, contrary to repeated or∣ders,
to stay behind him, and to take up their quarters
in Bury<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 101. H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 352.</NOTE>. This disobedience proved in the issue fortu∣nate
to Edward. The Danes assaulted the Kentish
men; but met with so stout a resistance, that, tho'
they gained the field of battle, they bought that advan∣tage
by the loss of their bravest leaders, and among the
rest, by that of Ethelwald, who perished in the action<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 101. Brompton, p. 832.</NOTE>.
The King, freed from the fear of so dangerous a compe∣titor,
<PB N="106" REF="118"/>
made peace on advantageous terms with the East-Angles<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 102. Brompton, p. 832. Math. West. p. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to restore England to such a state of tranquilli∣ty
as it was then capable of attaining,<NOTE PLACE="marg">911.</NOTE> nought was want∣ing
but the subjection of the Northumbrians, who, assist∣ed
by the scattered Danes in Mercia, continually infested
the bowels of the kingdom. Edward, in order to divert
the force of these enemies, prepared a fleet to attack
them by sea; hoping, that when his forces appeared
off their coast, they must at least remain at home, and
provide for their own defence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 352.</NOTE>. But the Northumbri∣ans
were less anxious to secure their own property than
greedy to commit spoil on their enemy; and concluding,
that the chief force of the English was embarked in the
fleet, they thought the opportunity favourable, and enter∣ed
Edward's territories with all their forces<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 102. Flor. Wigorn. p. 599.</NOTE>. The
King, who was prepared against this event, attacked
them on their return at Tetenhall in the county of Staf∣ford,
put them to rout, recovered all the booty, and
pursued them with great slaughter into their own coun∣try<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 421. H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the rest of Edward's reign was a scene of conti∣nued
and successsul action against the Northumbrians, the
East-Angles, the Five-burgers, and the foreign Danes,
who invaded him from Normandy and Britanny<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 105. Brompton, p. 833.</NOTE>. He
was as provident in putting his kingdom in a posture of
defence, as vigorous in assaulting the enemy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 5. Hoveden, p 421.</NOTE>. He for∣tified
the towns of Chester, Eddesbury, Warwic, Cher∣bury,
Buckingham, Towcester, Maldon, Huntingdon,
and Colchester. He fought two great battles at Tems∣ford
<PB N="107" REF="119"/>
and Maldon<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 108. Flor. Wigorn. p. 601.</NOTE>. He reduced Thurketill, a great Dan∣ish
chieftain, and obliged him to retire with his follow∣ers
into France, in quest of spoil and adventures<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 106.</NOTE> He
subdued the East-Angles, and forced them to swear alle∣giance
to him: He expelled the two rival princes of
Northumberland, Reginald and Sidroc, and acquired,

tribes of the Britains were subjected by him; and even
the Scots, who, during the reign of Egbert, had, under
the conduct of Kenneth, their king, encreased their
power, by the final subjection of the Picts, were how∣ever
obliged to give him marks of submission<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 110. Hoveden, p. 421.</NOTE>. In all
these fortunate atchievements, he was assisted by the acti∣vity

<HEAD>ATHELSTAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE stain in this prince's birth was not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">925.</NOTE> in those
times, deemed so considerable as to exclude him
from the throne; and Athelstan, being of an age, as well
as of a capacity, sitted for government, obtained the pre∣ference
to Edward's younger children, who, tho' legiti∣mate,
were of too tender years to rule a nation so much
exposed both to foreign invasion and to domestic convulsions.
Some discontents, however, prevailed on his ac∣cession;
and Alfred, a nobleman of considerable power,
was thence encouraged to enter into a conspiracy against
him. This event is related by historians with circum∣stances,
which the reader, according to the degree of
credit he is disposed to give them, may impute either to
the invention of monks, who forged them, or to their ar∣tifice,
who found means to make them real. Alfred, it
is said, being seized upon strong suspicions, but without
any certain proof, firmly denied the conspiracy imputed
to him; and in order to justify himself, he offered to
swear to his innocence before the Pope, whose person, it
was supposed, contained such superior sanctity, that no
one could presume to give a false oath in his pre∣sence,
and yet hope to escape the immediate vengeance
of heaven. The King accepted of the condition, and
Alfred was conducted to Rome; where, either conscious
of his innocence, or neglecting the superstition, to which
he appealed, he ventured to make the oath required of
him, before John, who then filled the papal chair. But
no sooner had he pronounced the fatal words, than he
fell into convulsions, of which in three days after he ex∣pired.
The King, as if the guilt of the conspirator were
now fully ascertained, confiscated his estate, and made a
<PB N="109" REF="121"/>
present of it to the monastery of Malmesbury<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 6. Spell. Conc. p. 407.</NOTE>; se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure
now that no doubts would ever thenceforth be entertain∣ed
concerning the justice of his proceedings.</P>
<P>THE dominion of Athelstan was no sooner established
over his English subjects, than he endeavoured to give se∣curity
to the government, by providing against the insur∣rections
of the Danes, which had created so much di∣sturbance
to his predecessors. He marched into Nor∣thumberland;
and finding, that the inhabitants bore
with impatience the English yoke, he thought it prudent
to give Sithric, a Danish nobleman, the title of King,
and to attach him to his interests, by marrying him to his
sister, Editha<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Alured Beverl. p. 109. W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 6. Hoveden, p. 422.</NOTE>. But this policy proved by accident the
source of very dangerous consequences. Sithric died in a
twelvemonth after; and his two sons by a former mar∣riage,
Anlaf and Godfrid, founding pretensions on their
father's elevation, assumed the sovereignty, without wait∣ing
for Athelstan's consent. They were soon expelled
by the power of that monarch; and the former took shel∣ter
in Ireland, as the latter did in Scotland<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 6.</NOTE>; where he
received, during some time, protection from Constantine,
who then enjoyed the crown of that kingdom. The
Scottish prince, however, continually solicited, and even
menaced, by Athelstan, at last promised to deliver up his
guest; but secretly detesting this treachery, he gave God∣frid
warning to make his escape<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and that fugitive, af∣ter
subsisting by pyracy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or some years, freed the King,
by his death, from any farther anxiety. Athelstan, re∣senting
Constantine's behaviour, entered Scotland with a
great army; and ravaging the country with impunity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 111. Hoveden, p. 42. H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 354.</NOTE>,
he reduced the Scots to such distress, that their King was
<PB N="110" REF="122"/>
content to preserve his crown, by making the most hum∣ble
submissions to the enemy. The English historians
assert<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 422,</NOTE> that Constantine did homage to Athelstan for
his whole kingdom; and they add, that the latter
prince, being urged by his courtiers to push the present
favourable opportunity, and entirely subdue Scotland, re∣plied,
that it was more glorious to confer than conquer
kingdoms<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 6. Brompton, p. 838. Higden, p. 262. Anglia Sacra, vol. 1. p. 212.</NOTE>. But those annals, so uncertain and imper∣fect
in themselves, lose all credit, when national prepos∣sessions
and animosities have place: And on that account,
the Scots historians, who, without having any more
knowledge of the matter, strenuously deny the fact, seem
more worthy of belief.</P>
<P>CONSTANTINE, whether he owed the retaining his
crown to the moderation of Athelstan, who was unwil∣ling
to employ all his advantages against him, or to the
policy of that monarch, who esteemed the humiliation of
an enemy a greater acquisition than the subjection of a
discontented and mutinous people, thought the behaviour
of the English more an object of resentment than of gra∣titude.
He entered into a confederacy with Anlaf, who
had collected a great body of Danish pyrates, whom he
found hovering in the Irish seas; and with some Welsh
princes, who were terrified with the growing power of
Athelstan: And all these allies made by concert an irrup∣tion
with a great army into England. Athelstan, collect∣ing
his forces, met the enemy near Brunsbury in Nor∣thumberland,
and defeated them in a general engage∣ment<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 113. W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 6. Ethel∣werd, cap. 5. H.

Turketul, the English, chancellor: For in those turbu∣lent
<PB N="111" REF="123"/>
ages, no one was so much occupied in civil em∣ployments,
as wholly to lay aside the military character<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">The office of chancellor among the Anglo Saxons resembled more that of a secretary of state, than that of our present chancellor. See Spellman in voce <HI>Cancellarius.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is a circumstance, not unworthy of notice,
which historians relate with regard to the transactions of
this war. Anlaf, on the approach of the English army,
thought, that he could not venture too much to ensure a
fortunate event; and employing the artifice formerly
practised by Alfred against the Danes, he entered the ene∣my's
camp in the habit of a minstrel. The stratagem was
for the present attended with a like success. He gave
such satisfaction to the soldiers, who flocked about him,
that they introduced him to the King's tent; and Anlaf,
having played before that prince and his nobles during
their repast, was dismissed with a handsome reward. His
prudence kept him from refusing the present; but his
pride determined him, on his departure, to bury it, while
he fancied that he was unespied by all the world. But a
soldier in Athelstan's camp, who had formerly served un∣der
Anlaf, had been struck with some suspicion on the
first appearance of the minstrel; and was engaged by curi∣osity
to observe all his motions. He regarded this last action
as a full proof of Anlaf's disguise; and he immediately
carried the intelligence to Athelstan, who blamed him for
not sooner giving him information, that he might have
seized his enemy. But the soldier told him, that as he
had formerly sworn fealty to Anlaf, he could never have
pardoned himself the treachery of betraying and ruining
his ancient master; and that Athelstan himself, after such
an instance of his criminal conduct, would have had
equal reason to doubt of his allegiance. Athelstan, hav∣ing
praised the generosity of the soldier's principles, re∣flected
on the incident, which he foresaw might be at∣tended
<PB N="112" REF="124"/>
with important consequences. He removed his
station in the camp; and as a bishop arrived that even∣ing
with a reinforcement of troops, (for the ecclesiastics
were then no less warlike than the civil magistrates) he
occupied with his train that very place which had been
left vacant by the King's removal. The precaution of
Athelstan was found prudent: For no sooner had dark∣ness
fallen, than Anlaf broke into the camp, and hasten∣ing
directly to the place where he had left the King's
tent, put the bishop to death, before he had time to pre∣pare
for his defence<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 6. Higden, p. 263.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE fell several Danish and Welsh princes in the
action of Brunsbury<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 839. Ingulf, p. 29.</NOTE>▪ and Constantine and Anlaf made
their escape with difficulty, leaving the greatest part of
their army on the field of battle. After this success,
Athelstan enjoyed his crown in tranquillity; and he is
regarded as one of the ablest and most active of those an∣tient
princes. He passed a remarkable law, which was
calculated for the encouragement of commerce, and
which it required some largeness of mind, in that age,
to have devised. That a merchant, who had made two
long sea-voyages on his own account, should be admitted
to the rank of a thane or gentleman. This prince died
at Glocester in the year 941<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 114.</NOTE>, after a reign of sixteen
years; and was succeeded by his brother Edmund.</P>

<HEAD>EDMUND.</HEAD>
<P>EDMUND, on his accession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">941.</NOTE> met with disturbance
from the restless Northumbrians, who lay in wait
for every opportunity of breaking into rebellion. But the
King, marching suddenly with his sorces into their coun∣try,
so overawed the rebels, that they endeavoured to ap∣pease
<PB N="113" REF="125"/>
him by the most humble submissions<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 7. Brompton, p. 857.</NOTE>. In order
to give him the surer pledge of their obedience, they of∣fered
to embrace Chrisanity; a religion which the Eng∣lisn
Danes had frequently professed, when reduced to dif∣ficulties,
but which, for that very reason, they regarded
as a badge of servitude, and shook off as soon as a fa∣vourable
opportunity offered. Edmund, trusting little to
their sincerity in this forced submission, used the precau∣tion
of removing the Five-burgers from the towns of
Mercia, in which they had been allowed to settle; be∣cause
it was always found, that they took advantage of
every commotion, and introduced the rebellious or fo∣reign
Danes into the heart of the kingdom<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 114. H. Hunting. Lib. 5. p. 355. Brompton, p. 857. Chron. de Muilrose, p. 148. Higden, p. 263. Alur. Beverl. p. 110.</NOTE>. He also
subdued Cumberland from the Britains; and conferred
that principality on Malcolm, King of Scotland, on
condition that he should do him homage for it, and pro∣tect
the north from all future incursions of the Danes<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron Sax. p. 115. W. Malmes. lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2. cap. 7. Hoveden, p. 423. Brompton, p. 857. Flor. Wigorn. p. 604.</NOTE></P>
<P>EDMUND was very young when he came to the crown;
yet his reign was short, as his death was violent. One
day, as he was solemnizing a festival in the county of
Glocester, he remarked, that Leolf, a notorious robber,
whom he had sentenced to banishment, had yet the bold∣ness
to enter the hall where he himself dined, and to sit at
table with his attendants. Enraged at this insolence, he
ordered him to leave the room; but on his refusing to
obey, the King, whose temper, naturally choleric, was
inflamed by this additional insult; leaped on him himself,
and seized him by the hair: But the ruffian, pushed to
extremity, drew his dagger, and gave Edmund an wound,
<PB N="114" REF="126"/>
of which he immediately expired<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 7. Hoveden, p. 423. Chron, de Mui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rose, p. 148.</NOTE> This event happen∣ed

were incapable of governing the kingdom; and his bro∣ther,
Edred, was promoted to the crown.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>EDRED.</HEAD>
<P>THE reign of this prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">946.</NOTE> as that of his predecessors,
was disturbed by the rebellions and incursions of the
Northumbrian Danes, who, tho' frequently quelled,
were never entirely subdued, nor had ever paid a sin∣cere
allegiance to the crown of England. The succession
of a new King seemed to them a favourable opportu∣nity
for shaking off the yoke; but on Edred's appearance
with an army, they made him their wonted submissions;
and the King having wasted the country with fire and
sword, as a punishment of their rebellion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 423. Wallingford, p. 541.</NOTE>, obliged them
to renew their oaths of allegiance; and he strait returned
with his forces. The obedience of the Danes lasted no
longer than the present terror. Provoked at the devasta∣tions
of Edred, and even reduced by necessity to subsist
on plunder, they broke into a new rebellion, and were
again subdued<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ethelwerd, cap. 7. Hoveden, p. 423.</NOTE>: But the King, now instructed by expe∣rience,
took better precautions against their future revolt.
He fixed English garrisons in their most considerable
towns; and placed over them an English governor, who
might watch all their motions, and suppress their insur∣rections
on the first appearance. He obliged also Mal∣colm,
<PB N="115" REF="127"/>
King of Scotland, to renew his homage for the
lands which he held in England<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Matth. West. p. 186. Higden, p. 263.</NOTE></P>
<P>EDRED, tho' not unwarlike, nor unfit for active life,
lay under the influence of the lowest superstition, and
had blindly delivered over his conscience to the guidance
of Dunstan, commonly called St. Dunstan, abbot of
Glastenbury<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 7. Brompton, p. 862.</NOTE>, whom he advanced to the highest offices,
and who covered, under the appearance of sanctity, the
most violent and most Insolent ambition. Taking ad∣vantage
of the implicit faith reposed in him by the King,
this churchman imported into England a new prder of
monks, who much changed the state of ecclesiastical af∣fairs,
and excited, on their, first establishment, the most
violent commotions.</P>
<P>FROM the time of the first introduction of Christiani∣ty
among the Saxons, there had been monasteries in
England; and these establishments had extremely multi∣plied,
by the donations of the princes and nobles; whose
superstition, derived from their ignorance and precari∣ous
life, and encreased by remorses for the crimes into
which they were so frequently betrayed, knew no other
expedient <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or appeasing the Deity than a profuse libera∣lity
towards the ecclesiastics. But the monks had hi∣therto
been a species of secular priests, who lived in the
convents after the manner of the present canons or pre∣bendaries,
and were both intermingled, in some degree,
with the world, and endeavoured to render themselves
useful to it. They were employed in the education of
youth<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Osberne in Anglia Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra, tom. 2. p. 92.</NOTE>: They had the disposal of their own time and
industry: They were not subjeected to the rigid rules of
an order: They had made no vows of implicit obedience
to their superiors<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Osberne, p. 91.</NOTE>: And they still retained the choice,
<PB N="116" REF="128"/>
without quitting the convent, either of a married or a
single life<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">See Wharton's notes to Anglia Scara, tom. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2. p. 91. Gervase, p. 1645. Chron. Wint, MS. Apud Spell, Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 434.</NOTE>. But a mistaken piety had produced in Italy
a nevv species of monks, called Benedictines; who, car∣rying
farther the plausible principles of mortification, se∣cluded
themselves entirely from the world, renounced
all claim to liberty, and made a merit of the most invio∣lable
chastity. These practices and principles, which
superstition at first engendered, were greedily embraced
and promoted by the policy of the court of Rome. The
Roman pontiff, who was making every day great ad∣vances
towards an universal sovereignty over the eccle∣siastics,
perceived, that the celibacy alone of the clergy
could break off entirely their connexion with the civil
power, and depriving them of every other object of am∣bition,
engage them to promote, with unceasing indus∣try,
the grandeur of their own order. He was sensible,
that so long as the monks were indulged in marriage,
and were allowed families, they never could be subjected
to a strict rule, or reduced to that slavery under their
superiors, which was requisite to procure to the orders,
issued from Rome, a ready and zealous obedience. Ce∣libacy,
therefore, began to be extolled, as the indispensible
duty of priests; and the Pope undertook to make
all the clergy throughout the western world renounce at
once the privilege of marriage: A fortunate policy, but
at the same time an undertaking the most difficult of
any, since he had the strongest propensities of human na∣ture
to encounter, and found, that the same connexions
with the female sex, which generally encourages devo∣tion,
was here unfavourable to the success of his pro∣ject.
It is no wonder, therefore, that this master-stroke
of art should have met with violent contradiction, and
that the interests of the hierarchy, and the inclinations
<PB N="117" REF="129"/>
of the priests, being now placed in this singular opposi∣tion,
should, notwithstanding the continued efforts of
Rome, have retarded the execution of that bold scheme,
during the course of near three centuries.</P>
<P>As the bishops and parochial clergy lived apart with
their families, and were more connected with the world,
the hopes of success with them were fainter, and the
pretence for making them renounce marriage was much
less plausible. But the pope, having cast his eye on the
monks as the basis of his authority, was determined to
reduce them under strict rules of obedience, to procure
them the credit of sanctity by an appearance of the most
rigid mortifications, and to break off all their other
connections which might interfere with his spiritual po∣licy.
Under pretence, therefore, of reforming abuses,
which were, in some degree, unavoidable in the antient
establishments, he had already spread over the southern
countries of Europe the strict rules of the monastic life,
and began to form attempts towards a like innovation in England.
The favourable opportunity offered itself (and
it was greedily seized) arising from the weak superstition of Edred, and the violent impetuous character of Dun∣stan.</P>
<P>DUNSTAN was born of noble parents in the west of
England; and being educated under his uncle, Aldhelm,
then Archbishop of Canterbury, had betaken himself to
the ecclesiastical life, and had acquired some character in
the court of Edmund. He was, however, defamed to
that prince as a man of licentious manners<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Osberne, p. 95. Math. West. p. 187.</NOTE>; and find∣ing
his fortune blasted by these suspicions, his ardent am∣bition
prompted him to repair his indiscretions by run∣ning
into an opposite extreme. He secluded himself en∣tirely
from the world; he framed a cell so small that he
could neither stand erect in it, nor stretch out his limbs
<PB N="118" REF="130"/>
during his repose; and he here employed himself perpe∣tually
either in devotion or in manual labour<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Osberne, p. 96.</NOTE>. It is
probable, that his brain became gradually crazed by these
solitary occupations, and that he framed chimeras, which,
being believed by himself and his stupid votaries, pro∣cured
him the general character of sanctity among the
people. He fancied, that the devil, among the frequent
visits, which he paid him, was one day more earnest
than usual in his temptations; till Dunstan, provoked at
his importunity, seized him by the nose with a pair of
red hot pincers, as he put his head into the cell; and he
held him there, till that malignant spirit made the whole neighbourhood refound with his bellowings. This not∣able
exploit was seriously credited and extolled by the
public; it is transmitted to posterity by one who, con∣sidering
his age, may pass for a writer of some elegance<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Osberne, p. 97.</NOTE>;
and it insured to Dunstan, a reputation, which no real
piety, much less virtue, could, even in the most en∣lightened
period, have ever been able to procure him
with the people.</P>
<P>SUPPORTED by the character, obtained in his retreat,
Dunstan appeared again at court; and gained such an
ascendant over Edred, who had succeeded to the crown,
as made him, not only the director of his conscience,
but his counsellor in the most momentous affairs of go∣vernment.
He was placed at the head of the treasury<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Osberne, p. 102. Wallingford, p. 541.</NOTE>,
and being thus possessed both of power at court, and of
credit with the populace, he was enabled to attempt
with success the most arduous undertakings. Finding,
that his advancement had been owing to the opinion of
his austerity, he professed himself a partizan of the rigid
monastic rules; and after introducing that reformation
<PB N="119" REF="131"/>
into the convents of Glastenbury and Abingdon, he en∣deavoured
to render it universal in the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE minds of men were already well prepared for
this innovation. The praises of an inviolable chastity
had been carried to the highest extravagance by some
of the first preachers of christianity among the Saxons:
The pleasures of love had been represented as incompa∣tible
with christian perfection: And a total abstinence
from all commerce with the sex was deemed such a me∣ritorious
pennance, as was sufficient to atone for the greatest enormities. The consequence seemed natural,
that those at least who officiated at the altar should be
clear of this pollution; and when the doctrine of tran∣substantiation,
which was now creeping in, was once
fully established, the reverence to the real body of Christ
in the eucharist, bestowed on this argument an addi∣tional
force and influence. The monks knew how to
avail themselves of all these popular topics, and to set
off their own character to the best advantage. They
affected the greatest austerity of life and manners: They
indulged themselves in the highest strains of devotion:
They inveighed bitterly against the vices and pretended
luxury of the age: They were particularly vehement
against the dissolute lives of the secular clergy, their ri∣vals:
Every particular instance of libertinism in that or∣der
was represented as a general corruption: And where
other topics of defamation were wanting, their marriage
became a sure object of invective, and their wives re∣ceived
the name of <HI>concubines,</HI> or other more opprobrious
appellation. The secular clergy, on the other hand,
who were numerous and rich, and possessed of one eccle∣siastical
dignities, defended themselves with vigour, and
endeavoured to retaliate upon their adversaries. The
people were thrown into agitation; and few instances
<PB N="120" REF="132"/>
occur of more violent diffentions, excited by the most
material differences in religion; or rather by the most
frivolous: Since it is a general remark, that the more
affinity there is between theological parties, the greater
commonly is their animosity.</P>
<P>THE progress of the monks, which was become con∣siderable,
was somewhat retarded by the death of Ed∣red,
their partizan, who expired after a reign of nine
years<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chorn. Sax. p. 115.</NOTE>. He left children; but as they were infants, his
nephew, Edwy, son to Edmund, was placed on the
throne.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EDWY.</HEAD>
<P>EDWY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">955.</NOTE> at the time of his accession, was not above six∣teen
or seventeen years of age, was possessed of the
most amiable figure, and even endowed, according to
authentic accounts, with the most promising virtues<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 356.</NOTE>. He would have been the favourite of his people, had he
not unhappily, on the commencement of his reign, been
engaged in a controversy with the monks, whose rage
neither the graces of the body nor virtues of the mind
could mitigate, and who have pursued his memory with
the same unrelenting vengeance, which they exercised
against his person and dignity during his short and un∣fortunate
reign. There was a beautiful princess of the
royal blood, called Elgiva, who had made impression on
the tender heart of Edwy; and as he was of an age,
when the force of the passions begins first to be felt, he
had ventured, contrary to the advice of his gravest coun∣sellors,
and the remonstrances of the more dignified ec∣clesiastics
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 7.</NOTE>, to espouse her; tho' she was within the de∣grees
of affinity, prohibited by the canon-law<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. As the

austerity, affected by the monks, made them particularly
violent on this occasion, Edwy entertained a strong pre∣possession
against them; and seemed on that account de∣termined
not to second their project, of expelling the se∣culars
from all the convents, and of acquiring to them∣selves
possession of those rich establishments. The war
was therefore declared between the King and the monks;
and the former soon found reason to repent him of his
provoking such dangerous enemies. On the day of his
coronation, his nobility were assembled in a great hall,
and were indulging themselves in that riot and disorder,
which, from the example of their German ancestors,
had become habitual to the English<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Wallingford, p. 542.</NOTE>; when Edwy, at∣tracted
by softer pleasures, retired into the Queen's
apartments, and in that privacy, gave reins to his fond∣ness
towards his wife, which was only moderately check∣ed
by the presence of her mother. Dunstan conjectured
the reason of the King's retreat; and carrying along
with him, Odo, archbishop of Canterbury, over whom
he had gained an entire ascendant, he burst into the apartment, upbraided Edwy with his lasciviousness, pro∣bably
bestowed on the Queen the most opprobrious
epithet which can be applied to her sex, and tearing him
from her arms, pushed him back, in a disgraceful man∣ner,
into the festival of the nobles<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 7. Osberne, p. 83. 105. M. West. p. 195, 196.</NOTE>. Edwy, tho' young
and opposed by the prejudices of the people, found an
opportunity of taking revenge for this public insult. He
questioned Dunstan concerning the administration of the
treasury during the reign of his predecessor<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Wallingford, p. 542. A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lur. Beverl. p. 112.</NOTE>; and when
that minister refused to give any account of money,

accused him of malversation in his office, and banished

during his absence: They filled the people's ears
with high <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anegyrics on his sanctity: They exclaimed
against the impiety of the King and Queen: And hav∣ing
poisoned the minds of men by these declamations,
they proceeded to still more outrageous violences against
the royal authority. Archbishop Odo sent into the pa∣lace
a party of soldiers, who seized the Queen, and hav∣ing
burned her face with a red hot iron, in order to de∣stroy
that fatal beauty, which had seduced Edwy, they
carried her by force into Ireland, there to remain in perpetual exile<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Osberne, p. 84. Gervase, p. 1644.</NOTE>. Edwy, finding it in vain to resist, was
obliged to consent to his divorce, which was pronounced
by Odo<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 425.</NOTE>; and a catastrophe, still more dismal, awaited
the unhappy Elgiva. That amiable princess being cured
of her wounds, and having even obliterated the scars,
with which Odo had hoped to deface her beauty, re∣turned
into England, and was flying to the embraces of
the King, whom she still regarded as her husband; when
she fell into the hands of a party, whom the primate had
ordered to intercept her. Nothing but her death could
now give security to Odo and the monks; and her most
cruel death was requisite to satiate their vengeance. She
was hamstringed; and expired a few days after at Glo∣cester
in the most acute torments<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Osberne, p. 84. Gervase, p. 1645, 1646.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English, blinded with superstition, instead of
being shocked with this inhumanity, exclaimed that the
misfortunes of Edwy and his spouse were a just judgment
on them for their dissolute contempt of the ecclesi∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tical
statutes. They even proceeded to rebellion against
their sovereign; and having placed Edgar at their head,
the younger brother of Edwy, a boy of thirteen years of
<PB N="123" REF="135"/>
age, they soon put him in possession of Mercia, Nor∣thumberland,
East-Anglia; and chaced Edwy into the
southern countries<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Osberne, p. 106. Flor. Wigorn. p. 605. Math. West. p. 196.</NOTE>. That it might not be doubtful at
whose instigation this revolt was undertaken; Dunstan
returned into England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 425. Osberne, p. 107. Brompton, p. 863.</NOTE> and took upon him the govern∣ment
of Edgar and his party. He was first installed in

kept possession of. Odo is transmitted to us by the monks under the character of a man of piety: Dunstan
was even canonized; and is one of those numerous saints of the same stamp, who disgrace the Romish calendar.
Meanwhile, the unhappy Edwy was excommunicated<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Brompton p. 863.</NOTE>,
and pursued with unrelenting vengeance; but his death,
which happened soon after, freed his enemies from all
farther inquietude; and gave Edgar peaceable possession
of the government<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">There is a seeming contradicttion in antient historians with regard to some circumstances of the story of Edwy and Elgiva. It is agreed, that this prince had a violent passion for his second or third cousin, El∣giva, whom he married, tho' within the degrees prohibited by the ca∣nons. It is also agreed, that he was dragged from a lady on the day of his coronation, and that the lady was afterwards treated with the sin∣gular barbarity abovementioned. The only difference is, that Osberne and some others call her his strumpet, not his wife, as she is said to be by Malmesbury. But this difference is easily reconciled: For if Edwy married her contrary to the canons, the monks would be sure to deny her to be his wife, and would insist that she could be nothing but his strumpet: So that, on the whole, we may esteem this representation of the matter as certain; at least, as by far the most probable. If Edwy had only kept a mistress, it is well known, that there were methods of accommodation with the church, which would have prevented the clergy from proceeding to such extremities against him: But his marriage, contrary to the canons, was an insult on their authority, and called for tneir highest resemment.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THIS prince, who mounted the throne in such early
youth, soon discovered an excellent capacity in the

most fortunate, which we meet with in the antient Eng∣lish

the wisest preparations against invaders: And by this vi∣gour

peace, and to employ himself in supporting and improv∣ing
the internal government of his kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 116. Knighton, p. 2313. Brompton, p. 864. 869. Flor. Wigorn. p. 605. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 29.</NOTE> He main∣tained

that he might retain the seamen in the practice of their
duty, and show perpetually a formidable armament to
his enemies, he stationed three squadrons off the coast,
and ordered them to make, from time to time, the cir∣cuit
of his dominions<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Many of the English historians make Edgar's ships amount to an extravagant number, to 3000, or 3600: See Hoveden, p. 426. Flor. Wigorn. p. 607.

Thorne makes the whole number amount only to 300, which is more probable. The fleet of Ethelred, Edgar's son, must have been short of 1000 ships; yet the Saxon Chronicle, p. 137, says it was greatest navy that ever had been seen in England.</NOTE>.

a prince. He carried his superiority to a great height,
and might have excited an universal combination against
him, had not his power been so well established, as to
deprive his enemies of all hopes of shaking it: It is said,
that residing once at Chester, and having proposed to go

<P>BUT the chief means, by which Edgar maintained his
authority, and preserved public peace, was the paying
court to Dunstan and the Monks, who had at first placed
him on the throne, and who, by their pretensions to su∣perior
sanctity and purity of manners, had acquired an
ascendant over the people. He favoured their scheme for

<PB N="126" REF="138"/>
he bestowed preferment on none but their partizans; he
allowed Dunstan to resign the see of Worcester into the
hands of Oswald, one of his creatures<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 8. Hoveden, p. 425.</NOTE>, and to place
Ethelwold, another of them, in that of Winchester<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gervase, p. 1646. Brompton, p. 864. Flor. Wigorn. p. 606. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 27, 28.</NOTE>;
he consulted these prelates in the administration of all ecclesiastical affairs, and even in that of many civil; and
tho' the vigour of his own genius prevented him from
being implicitly guided by them, the King and the
bishops found such advantages in their mutual harmony,
that they acted always in concert, and united their influ∣ence
in preserving the peace and tranquillity of the
public.</P>
<P>IN order to compleat the great work of placing the
new order of monks in all the convents, Edgar sum∣moned
a general council of the prelates and the heads of the
religious orders. He here inveighed against the dis∣solute
lives of the secular clergy; the smallness of their
tonsure, which, it is probable, maintained no longer any
resemblance to the crown of thorns; their negligence in
attending the exercise of their function; their mixing
with the laity in the pleasures of gaming, hunting,
dancing and singing; and their openly living with con∣cubines,
by which it is commonly supposed he meant
their wives. He then turned himself to Dunstan the
primate; and in the name of the late King, Edred, his
father, whom he supposed to look, down from Heaven
with indignation against all those enormities, he thus
addressed him. “'Tis you, Dunstan, by whose advice
I founded monasteries, built churches, and expended
my treasure in the support of religion and religious
houses. You was my counsellor and assistant in all
my schemes: You was the director of my conscience:
<PB N="127" REF="139"/>
To you I was obedient in all things. When did you
call for supplies, which I refused you? Was my assist∣ance
ever wanting to the poor? Did I deny support
and establishments to the clergy and, the convents?
Did I not hearken to your instructions, who told me,
that these charities were, of all others, the most grate∣ful
to my Maker, and fixed a perpetual fund for the
support of religion? And are all our pious endeavours
now frustrated by the dissolute lives of the priests?
Not that I throw any blame on you: You have rea∣soned,
besought, inculcated, inveighed; But it be∣hoves
you now to use sharper and more vigorous re∣medies;
and conjoining your spiritual authority with
the civil power, to purge effectually the temple of
God from thieves and intruders<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Abbas Rieval. p. 360, 361. Spel. Conc. p. 476, 477, 478.</NOTE>.” It is easy to ima∣gine
that this harangue had the desired effect; and that,
when the King and prelates thus concurred with the
popular prejudices, it was not long before the monks
prevailed, and established their new rules in almost all
the convents.</P>
<P>WE may remark, that the declamations against the
secular clergy are both here and in all the historians,
conveyed in general terms; and as that order of men are
commonly restrained by the decency of their character,
not to mention superior motives, it is difficult to believe
that the complaints against their dissolute manners could
be so universally just as is pretended. It is more pro∣bable,
that the monks paid court to the populace by an
affected austerity of life; and, representing the most in∣nocent
liberties, taken by the other clergy, as great and
unpardonable enormities, thereby prepared the way for
the increase of their own power and influence. Edgar,
however, like a true politician, concurred with the pre∣vailing
<PB N="128" REF="140"/>
party; and he even indulged them in pretensions,
which, tho' they might, when complied with, engage
the monks to support royal authority during his own
reign, proved afterwards very dangerous to his succes∣sors, and gave disturbance to the whole civil power. He
seconded the policy of the court of Rome, in granting to
some monasteries an exemption from episcopal jurisdic∣tion:
He allowed the convents, even those of royal
foundation, to usurp the election of their own abbot:
And he admitted their forgeries of antient charters, by
which, from the pretended grant of former kings, they
assumed like privileges and exemptions<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 118. W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 8. Seldeni Spi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ileg. ad Eadm. p. 149. 157.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE merits of Edgar have procured him the highest
panegyrics from the monks; and he is transmitted to us
not only under the character of a great politician and an
active prince, praises to which he seems to have been in∣titled,
but under that of a great saint and a man of vir∣tue.
But nothing could more betray both his own hy∣pocrisy
in inveighing against the licentiousness of the se∣cular
clergy, and the interested spirit of his partizans, in
bestowing such eulogies on his piety, than the usual te∣nor
of his conduct, which was licentious to the highest
degree, and violated every law, human and divine. Yet
those very monks, who, as we are told by Ingulf, a
very antient historian, had no idea of any moral or re∣ligious
merit, except chasity and obedience, not only
connived at his enormities, but loaded him with the
highest praises. History, however, has preserved some
instances of his amours, from which, as from a specimen,
we may form a conjecture of the reft.</P>
<P>EDGAR broke into a convent, carried off Editha, a
nun, by force, and even committed violence on her per∣son<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 8. Osberne, p. 3. Diceto, p. 457. Higden, p. 265. 267, 268. Spell. Conc. p. 481.</NOTE>.
<PB N="129" REF="141"/>
For this act of sacrilege and brutality he was re∣primanded
by Dunstan; and that he might reconcile him∣self
with the church, he was obliged, not to separate
from his mistress, but to abstain from wearing his crown
during seven years, and to deprive himself so long of that
useless ornament<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Osberne, p. 111.</NOTE>: A punishment very unequal to that
inflicted on the unfortunate Edwy, who, for a marriage,
which, in the strictest sense, could only deserve the name
of irregular, was expelled his kingdom, saw his Queen
treated with the most singular barbarity, was loaded with
calumnies, and has been transmitted to posterity under
the most odious colours. Such is the ascendant which
may be attained, by hypocrisy and cabal, over man∣kind!</P>
<P>THERE was another mistress of Edgar, called Elfleda,
with whom he first formed a connexion by a kind of ac∣cident.
Passing one day by Andover, he lodged in the
house of a nobleman, whose daughter, being endowed
with all the graces of person and behaviour, enflamed
him at first fight with the highest desire, and made him
resolve by any expedient to gratify it. As he had not
leisure to employ courtship or address for attaining his
purpose, he went directly to her mother, declared the
violence of his passion, and desired that the young lady might be allowed to pass that very night with him. The
mother was a woman of virtue, and determined not to
dishonour her daughter and her family by compliance;
but being well acquainted with the impetuosity of the
King's temper, she thought it would be easier, as well
as safer, to deceive than refuse him. She feigned there∣fore
a submission to his will; but secretly ordered a
waiting maid, of no disagreeable figure, to steal into the
<PB N="130" REF="142"/>
King's bed, after all the company should be retired to
rest. In the morning, before day-break, the damsel,
agreeable to the injunctions of her mistress, offered to re∣tire;
but Edgar, who had no reserve in his pleasures,
and whose love to his bedfellow was rather enflamed by
enjoyment, refused his consent, and employed force and
entreaties to detain her. Elfleda, trusting to her own
charms, and to the love with which, she hoped, she had
now inspired the King, made probably but a faint resist∣ance;
and the return of light discovered the deceit to
Edgar. He had passed a night so much to his satisfac∣tion,
that he expressed no displeasure with the old lady
on account of her fraud; his love was transferred to El∣fleda;
she became his favourite mistress, and maintained
her ascendant over him, till his marriage with Elfrida<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 8. Higden, p. 268.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE circumstances of his marriage with this lady
were more singular, and more criminal. Elfrida was
daughter and heir of Olgar, earl of Devonshire; and
tho' she had been educated in the country, and had ne∣ver
appeared at court, she had filled all England with
the reputation of her beauty. Edgar himself, who was
indifferent to no accounts of this nature, found his cu∣riosity
excited by the frequent panegyrics which he heard
of Elfrida; and reflecting on her noble birth, he resolv∣ed,
if he found her charms answerable to their fame, to
obtain possession of her on honourable terms. He com∣municated
his intention to earl Athelwold, his favour∣ite;
but used the precaution, before he made any ad∣vances
to her parents, to order that nobleman, on some
pretence, to pay them a visit, and to bring him a certain
account of the beauty of their daughter. Athelwold,
when introduced to the young lady, found general re∣port
to have fallen much short of the truth; and being
inflamed with the highest love, he determined to sacri∣fice
<PB N="131" REF="143"/>
to this new passion all his fidelity to his master, and
to the trust reposed in him. He returned to Edgar, and
told him, that the riches alone, and high quality of El∣frida,
had been the ground of the admiration paid her,
and that her charms, far from being any wise extraordi∣nary,
would have been overlooked in a woman of infe∣rior
station. When he had, by this deceit, turned the
King from his purpose, he took an opportunity, after
some interval, of turning again the conversation on El∣frida;
and he remarked, that, tho' the parentage and
fortune of the lady had not produced on him, as on
others, any illusion with regard to her beauty, he could
not forbear reflecting, that she would on the whole be
an advantageous match for him, and might, by her
birth and riches, make him a sufficient compensation for
the homeliness of her person. If the King, therefore,
gave his approbation to the design, he was determined to
make proposals in his own behalf to the earl of Devon∣shire,
and doubted riot to obtain his, as well as the
young lady's consent to the marriage. Edgar, pleased
with an expedient for establishing his favourite's fortune,
not only exhorted him to execute his purpose, but for∣warded
its success by his recommendations to the parents
of Elfrida; and Athelwold was soon made happy in the
possession of his mistress. Dreading, however, the de∣tection
of the artifice, he employed every pretence for
detaining Elfrida in the country, and for keeping her
at a distance from Edgar.</P>
<P>THE violent passion of Athelwold had concealed from
him the necessary consequences which must attend his
conduct, and the advantages which the numerous ene∣mies
that always pursue a royal favourite, would, by its
means, be able to make against him. Edgar was soon
informed of the truth; but before he would execute ven∣geance
on Athelwold's treachery, he resolved to satisfy
<PB N="132" REF="144"/>
himself with his own eyes of the certainty and full ex∣tent
of his guilt. He told him, that he intended to pay
him a visit in his castle, and be introduced to the ac∣quaintance
of his new married wife; and Athelwold, as
he could not refuse this honour, begged only leave to go
before him a few hours, that he might the better prepare
every thing for his reception. He then discovered the
whole matter to Elfrida; and begged her, if she had any
regard, either to her own honour or to his life, to con∣ceal
from Edgar, by every circumstance of dress and
behaviour, that fatal beauty, which had seduced him
from fidelity to his friend, and had betrayed him into so
many falsehoods. Elfrida promised compliance, tho'
nothing was farther from her intentions. She deemed
herself little beholden to Athelwold for a passion, which
had deprived her of a crown; and knowing the force of
her own charms, she did not despair even yet of reach∣ing
that station, of which her husband's artifice had be∣reaved
her. She appeared before the King with all the
advantages which the richest attire, and the most en∣gaging
airs, could bestow upon her, and excited at once
in his bosom the highest love towards herself, and the
most furious desre of revenge against her husband. He
knew, however, how to dissemble these passions; and
seducing Athelwold into a wood, on pretence of hunt∣ing,
he stabbed him with his own hand, and soon after
publicly espoused Elfrida<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes lib. 2 cap. 8. Hoveden, p. 426. Brompton, p. 865, 866. Flor. Wigorn. p. 606. Higden, p. 268.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BEFORE we conclude our account of this reign, we
must mention two circumstances, which are remarked
by historians. The reputation of Edgar allured a great
number of foreigners to visit his court; and he gave
them encouragement to reside in England<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 116. H. Hunting. lib. 5. 356. Brompton, p. 865.</NOTE>. We are
told, that they imported all the vices of their respective
<PB N="133" REF="145"/>
countries, and contributed to corrupt the simple manners
of the natives<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 8.</NOTE>: But as this simplicity of manners, so
highly and often so injudiciously extolled, preserved them
not from barbarity and treachery, the greatest of all
vices, and the most incident to a rude uncultivated pe∣ople,
we ought perhaps to deem their acquaintance with
foreigners rather an advantage; as it tended to enlarge
their views, and to cure them of those illiberal prejudices
and rustic manners to which islanders are often subject.</P>
<P>ANOTHER remarkable incident of this reign was the
extirpation of wolves from England. This advantage
was attained by the industrious policy of Edgar. He
took great pains in hunting and pursuing those ravenous
animals; and when he found, that they had all taken
shelter in the mountains and forests of Wales, he chan∣ged
the tribute of money imposed on the Welsh princes
by Athelstan, his predecessor<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 6. Brompton, p. 838.</NOTE>. into an annual tribute of
three hundred heads of wolves; which produced such di∣ligence
in hunting them, that the creature has been no
more seen in this island.</P>
<P>EDGAR died, after a reign of sixteen years, and in the
thirty-third of his age. He was succeeded by Edward,
whom he had by his first marriage with the daughter of
Earl Ordmer<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 8. Hoveden, p. 426. Knighton, p. 2313.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD the Martyr.</HEAD>
<P>THE succession of this prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">957.</NOTE> who was only fifteen
years of age at his father's death, did not take place
without much difficulty and opposition. Elfrida, his
step-mother, had a son, Ethelred, seven years old,
whom she attempted to raise to the throne: She affirmed,
<PB N="134" REF="146"/>
that Edgar's marriage with the mother of Edward, was
exposed to insuperable objections; and as she had possess∣ed
great credit with her husband, she had sound means to
acquire partisans, who seconded all her pretensions.
But the title of Edward was supported by many advantages.
He was appointed successor by the will of his fa∣ther<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 427. Eadmer, p. 3:</NOTE> He was approaching to man's estate, and might
soon be able to take into his own hands the reins of go∣vernment:
The principal nobility, dreading the imperi∣ous
temper of Elfrida, were averse to her son's govern∣ment,
which must enlarge her authority, is not put her in
possession of the regency: And above all, Dunstan,
whose character of fanctity had given him the highest credit with the people, had espoused the cause of Edward,

and was determined to execute the will of Edgar in his
favour. To cut off all pretensions, Dunstan resolutely
anointed and crowned the young prince at Kingston;
and the whole kingdom, without farther opposition, sub∣mitted
to him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 9. Hoveden, p. 427. Osberne, p. 113. Gervasi, p. 1647. Knighton, p. 2313. Brompton, p. 872. Flor Wigorn. p. 607. Chron, Abb. St. Petri di Burgo, p 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT was of great importance to Dunstan and the monks,
to place on the throne a King favourable to their cause:
The secular clergy had still partizans in England, who
desired to keep them in possession of the convents, and of
the ecclesiastical authority. On the first intelligence of
Edgar's death, Alfere, duke of Mercia, expelled the new
orders of monks from all the monasteries which lay with∣in
his jurisdiction<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 123. W. Malmef. lib. 2. cap. 9. Hoveden, p. 427. Brompton, p. 870. Flor. Wigorn. p. 607.</NOTE>; but Elfwin, duke of East-Anglia,
and Brithnot, duke of the East-Saxons, protected them
<PB N="135" REF="147"/>
within their territories, and insisted upon the execution of
the late laws enacted in their favour<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 427. Brompton, p. 870. Higden, 269.</NOTE> In order to settle
this controversy, there were summoned several synods,
which, according to the practice of those times, consist∣ed
partly of ecclesiastical members, partly of the lay no∣bility.
The monks were able to prevail in all these as∣semblies;
Tho', as it appears, contrary to the secret
wishes, if not the declared opposition, of the leading
men in the nation<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Melmes. lib. 2. cap. 9.</NOTE>. They had more invention in
forging miracles to support their cause; or having been
so fortunate as to obtain, by their pretended austerities,
the character of piety, their miracles were better believed
by the populace.</P>
<P>IN one synod, Dunstan, finding the majority of votes
against him, rose up, and informed the audience, that he
had, in that instant, received an immediate revelation in
behalf of the monks; and the assembly were so astonished
at this intelligence, or probably so overawed by the popu∣lace,
that they proceeded no farther in their delibera∣tions.
In another synod, a voice issued from the cruci∣fix,
and informed the members, that the establishment of
the monks was founded on the will of heaven, and could
not be opposed without impiety<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 9. Osberne, p. 112. Gervase, p. 1647. Brompton, p. 870. Higden, p. 269.</NOTE>. But the miracle per∣formed
in the third synod was still more alarming: The
floor of the hall, in which the assembly met, sunk of a
sudden, and a great number of the members were either
bruised or killed by the fall. It was remarked, that
Dunstan had prevented that day the King from attending
the synod, and that the beam on which his own chair
stood, was the only one which did not sink under the
<PB N="136" REF="148"/>
weight of the assembly<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 124. W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 9. Hoveden, p. 427. H. Hunt. lib. 5. p. 357. Gervase, p. 16 + 7. Brompton. p. 870. Flor. Wigorn. p. 607. Higden, p. 269. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 29</NOTE>: But these circumstances, in∣stead
of begetting any suspicion of contrivance, were re∣garded
as the surest proof of the immediate interposition
of providence, in behalf of these favourites of heaven<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">I have already made a remark, (and it would be too tedious to re∣peat it as often as there is occasion) that, where we meet with such sto∣ries in the antient authors, we may justly entertain a doubt whether they be owing to the fiction of the succeeding monks, who invented them, or to the subtlety and contrivance of those monks who lived in the time, and who really imposed upon the populace.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWARD lived four years after his accession, and
there passed nothing remarkable during his reign. His
death was memorable and tragical<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 124.</NOTE>. This young prince
was endowed with the most amiable innocence of man∣ners;
and as his own intentions were always pure, he
was incapable of entertaining any suspicion against others.
Tho' his step-mother had opposed his succession, and had
raised a party in favour of her own son, he always show∣ed
her marks of the greatest regard, and even expressed,
on all occasions, the most tender affection towards his
brother<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 9. Brompton, p. 873. Matth. West. p. 193. Wallingford, p. 545.</NOTE>. He was hunting one day in a forest in Dorset∣shire;
and being led by the chace near Corfe-castle,
where Elfrida resided, he took the opportunity of paying
her a visit, unattended by any of his retinue, and he
thereby presented her with the occasion, which she had
long wished for. After he had mounted his horse, he
desired some liquor to be brought him; and while he
was holding the cup to his head, a servant of Elfrida ap∣proached
him, and gave him a stab behind. The prince,
finding himself wounded, put spurs to his horse; but be∣coming
faint by loss of blood, he fell from the saddle, his
<PB N="137" REF="149"/>
foot stuck in the stirrup, and he was dragged along by
his unruly horse, till he expired<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 9. Hoveden, p. 427. p. 1647. Gervase, p. 1647. Knighton, p. 2313. Brompton, p. 873.</NOTE>. Being tracked by the
blood, his body was found, and was privately interred at
Wereham by his servants.</P>
<P>THE youth and innocence of this prince, with his
tragical death, begot such compassion among the people,
that they believed miracles to be wrought at his tomb<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 9. Kinghton, p. 2313. Brompton, p. 874, 875, 876. Matth. West. p. 194. Higden, p. 269.</NOTE>;
and they gave him the appellation of martyr, tho' his
murder had no reference to any religious principle or
opinion, Elfrida built monasteries, and performed many
penances, in order to atone for her guilt<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Knighton, p. 2313, 2314. Brompton, p. 876.</NOTE>, but could ne∣ver,

<P>THE freedom which England had so long enjoyed
from Danish depredations<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III.</NOTE>, seems to have proceeded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">978.</NOTE>
partly from the establishments which that nation had
obtained in the north of France, and which employed all
their superfluous hands to people and maintain them;
partly from the vigour and warlike spirit of a long race of
English princes, who preserved the country in a posture
of defence by sea and land, and either prevented or repel∣led
every attempt of the invaders. But a new generation
of men being now sprung up in the northern regions,
who could no longer disburthen themselves on Norman∣dy;
the English had reason to dread, that they would
again visit an island, to which they were invited, both by
the memory of their past successes, and by the expecta∣tion
of assistance from their countrymen, who, tho' long established in the kingdom, were not yet thoroughly
united with the natives, nor had entirely forgot their in∣veterate
habits of war and depredation: And as the pre∣sent
King was a minor, and even when he attained to
man's estate, never discovered either courage or capacity
<PB N="139" REF="153"/>
sufficient to govern his own subjects, much less to repel a
formidable enemy, the people might justly expect to
suffer the worst calamities from so dangerous a crisis.</P>
<P>THE Danes, before they durst attempt any important
enterprize against England, made a small incursion, by
way of trial;<NOTE PLACE="marg">981.</NOTE> and having landed from seven vessels near
Southampton, they ravaged the country, enriched them∣selves
by spoil, and departed with impunity<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 125. H. Hunt. P. 357. Hoveden, p. 447. Chron. St. Petri di Burgo, p. 30. Sim. Dun. p. 161. Brompton, p. 875.</NOTE>. Six years
after, they made a like attempt in the west, and met
with like success<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 126. Hoveden, p. 427. Sim Dun. p. 161</NOTE>; and the invaders, having now found
affairs in a very different situation from that in which they
formerly appeared, encouraged their countrymen to as∣semble
a greater force, and to hope for more considerable
advantages.<NOTE PLACE="marg">991.</NOTE> They landed in Essex under the command
of two chieftains; and having defeated and slain at Mal∣don,
Brithnot, duke of that county<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 357. Hoveden, p. 428.</NOTE>, who ventured with
a small force to attack, them, they spread their devastations
over all the neighbouring provinces. In this extre∣mity,
Ethelred, to whom historians give the epithet of
the <HI>Unready</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, vol. 1. p. 225.</NOTE>, instead of rousing his people to defend
with courage their honour and their property, hearkened
to the advice of Siricius, archbishop of Canterbury,
which was seconded by many of the degenerate nobility;
and paying the enemy the sum of ten thousand pounds,
he bribed them to depart the kingdom<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 126. W. Malm. p. 62. H. Hunt. p. 357. Hoveden, p. 428.</NOTE>. This shameful
expedient was attended with the success which might be ex∣pected.
The Danes appeared next year off the eastern
coast, in hopes of subduing a people, who defended them∣selves
by their money, which invited assailants, instead of

<PB N="140" REF="156"/>
their arms, which repelled them. But the English, sen∣sible
of their folly, had, in the interval, met in a great
council, and had determined to assemble at London a
fleet capable of repulsi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the enemy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 126.</NOTE>; tho' that judicious
measure failed of success, from the treachery of Alfric,
duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>micia, whose name is infamous in the annals of
that age, by the calamities which his repeated perfidy
brought upon his country. This nobleman had, in 983,
succeeded to his father, Alfere, in that extensive com∣mand;
but being deprived of it two years after, and ba∣nished the kingdom<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 125. Chron, St. Petri di Burgo, p. 31. Brompton, p. 879.</NOTE>, he was obliged to employ all his
intrigue, and all his power, which was too great for a
subject, to be restored to his country, and re-instated in
his authority. Having had experience of the credit and
malevolence of his enemies, he thenceforth trusted for se∣curity,
not to his services or to the affections of his fel∣low
citizens, but to the influence which he had obtained
over his vassals, and to the public calamities, which he
thought must, in every revolution, render his assistance
necessary. Having fixed this resolution, he determined
to prevent all such successes as might establish the royal
authority, or render his own situation dependant and pre∣carious.
As the English had formed the plan of sur∣rounding
and destroying the Danish fleet in harbour, he
privately informed the enemy of their danger; and when
they put to sea, in consequence of this intelligence, he
deserted, with the squadron under his command, the
night before the engagement, and thereby disappointed
all the efforts of his countrymen<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 127. W. Malm. p. 62. Higden, p. 270.</NOTE>. Ethelred, enraged
at this perfidy, seized his son, Alfgar, and ordered his
eyes to be put out<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 128. W. Malm. p. 62. H. Hunt. p. 358. Higden, p. 270.</NOTE>; But such was the power of Alfric,
<PB N="141" REF="157"/>
that he again forced himself into authority<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 357. Higden, p. 270;</NOTE> and tho'
he had given this specimen of his character, and received
this grievous provocation, it was found necessary to en∣trust
him anew with the government of Mercia. This
conduct of the court, which, in all its circumstances, is
so barbarous, imprudent, and weak, both merited and
prognosticated the most grievous calamities.</P>
<P>THE northern invaders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">993.</NOTE> now well acquainted with
the defenceless condition of England, made a powerful
descent, under the command of Swein, King of Den∣mark,
and Olave, King of Norway; and sailing up the
Humber, spread on all sides their destructive ravages.
Lindesey was laid waste; Banbury was destroyed<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Chron. Mailr. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2. Sim. Dun. p. 162.</NOTE>; and
all the Northumbrians, tho' mostly of Danish descent,
were obliged either to join the victors, or to suffer under
their depredations. A powerful army was assembled to
oppose the invaders, and a general action ensued; but
the English were abandoned in the battle, by the cow∣ardice
or treachery of their three leaders, all of them
men of Danish race, Frena, Frithegist, and Godwin,
who gave the example of a shameful flight to the troops
under their command<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 128. H. Hunt. p. 357. Hoveden, p. 428. Brompton, p. 880.</NOTE></P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by this success, and still more by the
contempt which it inspired of their enemy, the pirates
ventured to attack the center of the kingdom; and en∣tering
the Thames in ninety-four vessels, laid siege to
London, and threatened it with total destruction. But
the citizens, alarmed with the danger, and firmly united
among themselves, made a bolder defence than the cow∣ardice
of the nobility and gentry gave the invaders reason
<PB N="142" REF="158"/>
to apprehend<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 63. H. Hunt. p. 358. Hoveden, p. 428.</NOTE>; and the besiegers, after suaffering the
greatest hardships, were finally frustrated, in their at∣tempt.
In order to revenge themselves, they laid waste
Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire; and having there
procured horses, they were thereby enabled to spread, in∣to
the more inland counties, the fury of their depreda∣tions<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 128. W. Malm. p. 63. H. Hunt. p. 358. Hoveden, p. 428. Sim. Dun. p. 162, 163.</NOTE>. In this extremity, Ethelred and his nobles had
recourse to the former expedient; and sending ambassa∣dors
to the two northern kings, they promised them sub∣sistence
and tribute, on condition they would, for the
present, put an end to their ravages, and soon after de∣part
the kingdom. Sweyn and Olave agreed to the
terms, and peaceably took up their quarters at Southamp∣ton,
where the sum of sixteen thousand pounds was paid
them<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 129. Hoveden, p. 428. Chron. Mailr. p. 152.</NOTE>. Olave even made a journey to Andover, where
Ethelred resided; and he received the rite of confirmation
from the English bishops, as well as many rich presents
from the King. He here promised, that he would never
more infest the English territories, and he faithfully per∣formed
that engagement<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. 129. H. Hunt. p. 358. Hoveden, p. 428. Chron. Mailr. p. 152. Sim. Dun, p. 163. Brompton, p. 880.</NOTE>. This prince receives the ap∣pellation
of St. Olave from the church of Rome; and
notwithstanding the general presumption, which lies, ei∣ther
against the understanding or morals of every one,
who in those ignorant ages was dignified with that title,
he seems to have been a man of merit and of virtue.
Sweyn, tho' less scrupulous than Olave, was obliged,
upon the departure of the Norwegian prince, to evacu∣ate
also the kingdom with all his followers.</P>
<P>THIS composition brought but a short interval to the
miseries of the English.<NOTE PLACE="marg">997.</NOTE> The Danish pirates appeared
<PB N="143" REF="159"/>
soon after in the Severne; and having committed spoil in
Wales, as well as in Cornwall and Devon, they sailed
round to the south-coast, and entering the Tamar, com∣pleated
the devastation of these two counties. They then
returned to the Bristol-channel; and penetrating into
the country by the Avon, spread themselves over all that
neighbourhood, and carried fire and sword even into
Dorsetshire<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 129. Hoveden, p. 428. Sim. Dun. 163.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">998.</NOTE> They next changed the seat of war; and
after ravaging the Ifle of Wight, they entered the
Thames, and Medway, and laid siege to Rochester,
where they defeated the Kentish-men in a great battle<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">H. Humph. 358. Hoveden, p. 429. Chron. Mailr. p. 153. Brompton, p. 882.</NOTE>.
After this victory, the whole province of Kent was made
a scene of slaughter, fire and devastation. The extremi∣ty
of these miseries forced the English into councils for
common defence both by sea and land; but the weak∣ness
of the King, the divisions of the nobility, the trea∣chery
of some, the cowardice of others, the want of con∣cert
in all, frustrated every endeavour; and their Heets
and armies either came too late to attack the enemy, or
were repulsed with dishonour; and the people were thus
equally ruined by resistance or by submission<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 129, 130. W. Malm. p. 63. Hoveden, p. 429. Higden, p. 271. Sim. Dun. p. 164.</NOTE>. The
English, therefore, devoid both of prudence and unani∣mity
in council, of courage and conduct in the field, had
recourse to the same weak expedient, which by experi∣ence
they might have already found so ineffectual; and
they offered the Danes to buy peace by paying them a
large sum of money. These ravagers rose continually
in their demands; and now required the payment of
24,000 l. which the English were so mean and impru∣dent
as to submit to<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 429. Chron. Mailr. p. 153. Sim. Dun. p. 164.</NOTE>. The departure of the Danes Pro∣cuted
<PB N="144" REF="160"/>
them a short interval of repose, which they enjoy∣ed
as if it were to be perpetual, without making any ef∣fectual
preparations for giving them a more vigorous re∣ception
upon their next return.</P>
<P>BESIDES receiving this sum, the Danes were engaged
by another circumstance to depart a kingdom, which ap∣peared
so little in a situation to resist their efforts: They
were invited over by their countrymen in Normandy,
who at this time were hard pressed by the arms of Robert,
King of France, and who found it difficult to defend the
settlement, which with so much advantage to themselves
and glory to their nation, they had made in that country.
It is probable, also, that Ethelred, observing the close
connexions, thus maintained among all the Danes,
however divided in government or situation, was desirous
of procuring an alliance with that formidable people;
and for this purpose, being now a widower, he made his
addresses to Emma, sister to Richard II. duke of Nor∣mandy,
and he soon succeeded in his negotiations. The
princess came over this year to England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1001.</NOTE> and was mar∣ried
to Ethelred<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 359. Higden, p. 271</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the end of the ninth and beginning of the tenth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the Nor∣mans.</NOTE>
century; when the north, not yet exhausted by that
multitude of people or rather nations, whom she had suc∣cessively emitted, sent forth a new race, not of conquer∣ors,
as before, but of pirates and ravagers, who infested
the country, possessed by her once warlike sons; there lived
Rollo, a petty prince or chieftain in Denmark, whose
valour and abilities soon drew the attention of his coun∣trymen.
He was exposed in his youth to the jealousy of
the King of Denmark, who attacked his small, but inde∣pendant
principality; and who being foiled in every
assault, had recourse at last to perfidy for effectuating his
purpose, which he had so often attempted in vain by
<PB N="145" REF="161"/>
force of arms<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dudo ex edit. Duchesne, p. 70, 71. Gul. Gemeticenis, lib. 2. cap. 2, 3:</NOTE>: He lulled Rollo into security by an insi∣dious
peace; and falling suddenly upon him, he murder∣ed
his brother and his bravest officers, and forced him to
fly for safety into Scandinavia. Here many of his antient
subjects, induced partly by affection to their prince, part∣ly
by the oppressions of the Danish Monarch, ranged
themselves under his standard, and offered to follow him
in every enterprize. Rollo, instead of attempting to re∣cover
his paternal dominions, where he must expect a
vigorous resistance from the Danes, determined to pursue
an easier, but more important undertaking, and to make
his fortune, in imitation of his countrymen, by pillaging
the richer and more southern coasts of Europe. He col∣lected
a body of troops, which like that of all these ra∣vagers,
was composed of Norwegians, Swedes, Frisians,
Danes, and adventurers of all nations, who, being ac∣customed
to a roving, unsettled life, took delight in no∣thing
but war and plunder. His reputation drew him
associates from, all quarters; and a vision, which he pre∣tended
to have appeared to him in his sleep, and which,
according to his interpretation of it, prognosticated to
him the greatest successes, proved also a powerful incen∣tive
with those ignorant and superstitious people<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dudo, p. 71. Gul. Gem. in epist. ad Gul. Conq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE first attempt of Rollo was on England, near
the end of Alfred's reign; when that great monarch, having
settled Guthrun and his followers in East-Anglia, and
others of these free-booters in Northumberland, and ha∣ving
restored peace to his harrassed country, had establish∣ed
the most excellent military, as well as civil institutions
among the English. The prudent Dane, finding that
no advantages could be gained, over such a people, go∣verned
by fuch a prince, soon turned his enterprizes
against France, which he found more exposed to his in∣roads<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 2. cap. 6.</NOTE>;
<PB N="146" REF="162"/>
and during the reigns of Eudes, an usurper, and
of Charles the Simple, a weak prince, he committed the
most destructive ravages on the inland, as well as mari∣time
provinces of that kingdom. The French, having
no means of defence againft a chiestain, who united all
the valour of his countrymen with the policy of more ci∣vilized
nations, were obliged to submit to the expedient
practised by Alfred, and to offer the invaders a settlement
in some of those provinces, which they had depopulated
by their arms<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Dudo, p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE reason why the Danes for many years pursued
measures so different from those embraced by the Goths,
Vandals, Franks, Burgundians, Lombards, and other
northern conquerors, was the great difference, in the
method of attack which was practised by these several na∣tions,
and to which the nature of their particular situa∣tions
necessarily confined them. The latter tribes, living
in an inland country, made incursions by land upon the
Roman empire; and when they entered far into the
frontiers, they were obliged to carry along with them
their wives and families, whom they had no hopes of
soon re-vlsiting, and who could not otherwise participate
of their plunder. This circumstance quickly made them
think of forcing a settlement in the provinces, which they
had over-run; and these barbarians, spreading them∣selves
over the country, found an interest in protecting
the property and industry of the people, whom they sub∣dued.
But the Danes and Norwegians, invited by their
maritime situation, and obliged to subsist themselves in
their uncultivated country by fishing, had acquired some
experience of navigation; and in their military excursions pursued the method practised against the Roman empire
by the more early Saxons: They made descents in small
bodies from their ships or rather boats, and ravaging the
<PB N="147" REF="163"/>
coasts, returned with the booty to their families, whom
they could not conveniently carry along with them in
these hazardous enterprizes. But when they increased
their armaments, made incursions into the inland coun∣tries,
and found it safe to remain longer in the midst
of the enemy, they had been accustomed to crowd their
vessels with their wives and children, and having no
longer any temptation to return into their own country,
they willingly embraced an opportunity of settling in the
warm climates and cultivated fields of the south.</P>
<P>AFFAIRS were in this situation with Rollo and his fol∣lowers,
when Charles proposed to relinquish to them the
province formerly called Neustria, and to purchase peace
of them on these hard conditions. After all the terms
were fully agreed, there appeared only once circumstance
shocking to the haughty Dane: He was required to do
homage to Charles for his province, and to put himself in
that humiliating posture, imposed on vassals by the rites
of the feudal law. He long refused to submit to this in∣dignity;
but being unwilling to lose such important ad∣vantages
for a mere ceremony, he made a sacrifice of his
pride to his interest, and acknowledged himself in form
the vassal of the French monarch<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 417.</NOTE>. Charles gave him
his daughter, Gisla, in marriage; and that he might
bind him faster to his interests, made him a donation of
a considerable territory, besides what he was obliged to
surrender to him by his stipulations. When some of the
French nobles informed him, that, in return for so gene∣rous
a present, it was expeted, that he should throw
himself at the King's feet, and make suitable acknow∣ledgments

rather break off the whole treaty; and it was with some
difficulty they could persuade him to make that compli∣ment
by one of his captains. The Dane, commissioned
<PB N="148" REF="164"/>
for this purpose, full of indignation at the order, and
despising so unwarlike a prince, caught Charles by the
foot, and pretending to carry it to his mouth, that he
might kiss it, overthrew him before all his courtiers.
The French nation, sensible of their present weakness,
found it prudent to overlook this insult<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 2. cap. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ROLLO, who was now in the decline of life, and was
tired of wars and depredations, applied himself with ma∣ture
councils, to the settlement of his new acquired
territory, which was thenceforth called Normandy; and
he parcelled it out among his captains and followers.
He followed in this partition the customs of the feudal
law, which was then universally established in the southern
countries of Europe, and which suited the peculiar cir∣cumstances
of that age. He treated the French
subjects who submitted to him, with mildness and
justice; he reclaimed his ancient followers from their
ferocity and violence; he established law and order
throughout his state; and after a life, spent in tumults
and ravages, he died peaceably in a good old age, and left
his dominions to his posterity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 2. cap. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>WILLIAM I. who succeeded him, governed the
dutchy for twenty-five years; and during this time, the
Normans were thoroughly intermingled with the French,
had acquired their language, had imitated their manners,
and had made such progress towards cultivation, that,
on the death of William, his son, Richard, tho' a
minor<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Order. Vitalis, p. 459. Gul. Gemet. lib. 4. cap. I.</NOTE>, inherited his dominions: A certain proof, that
the Normans were already well advanced in civility, and
that their government could now rest secure on its laws
and civil institutions, and was not wholly sustained by
the abilities of the sovereign. Richard, after a long
<PB N="149" REF="165"/>
reign of fifty-four years, was succeeded by his son of the
same name in the year 996<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Order. Vitalis, p. 459.</NOTE>; which was eighty-five
years after the first establishment of the Normans in
France. This was the duke, who gave his sister, Em∣ma,
in marriage to Ethelred, King of England, and
who thereby formed connexions, with a country, which
his posterity were so soon after destined to subdue.</P>
<P>THE Danes had been established during a longer pe∣riod
in England than in France; and tho' the similarity
of their original language to that of the Saxons invited
them to a more early coalition with the natives, they
had found, as yet, so little example of civilized manners
among the English, that they retained all their ancient
ferocity, and valued themselves only on their national
character of military bravery. The recent, as well as
more antient atchievements of their countrymen, tended
to sustain this idea; and the English princes, particularly
Athelstan and Edgar, sensible of that superiority, had
been accustomed to keep-in pay bodies of Danish troops,
who were quartered about the country, and committed
many violences upon the inhabitants. These mercena∣ries
had attained to such a height of luxury, according
to the old English writers<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wallingford, p. 547.</NOTE>, that they combed their hair
once a day, bathed themselves once a week, changed
their cloaths frequently; and by all these arts of effe∣minacy,
as well as by their military character, had ren∣dered
themselves so agreeable to the fair sex, that they
debauched the wives and daughters of the English, and
had dishonoured many families. But what most provoked
the inhabitants, was, that, instead of defending them
against invaders, they were ever ready to betray them to
the foreign Danes, and to associate themselves with all
the straggling parties of that nation. The animosity be∣tween
<PB N="150" REF="166"/>
the inhabitants of English and Danish race, had,
from these repeated injuries, risen to a great height;
when Ethelred, from a policy incident to weak princes,
embraced the cruel resolution of massacring the latter
throughout all his dominions<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Almost all the antient historians speak of this massacre of the Danes as if it had been universal, and as if every individual of that nation throughout England had been put to death. But the Danes were almost the sole inhabitants in the kingdoms of Northumberland and East Anglia, and were very numerous in Mercia. This represenstation therefore of the matter is absolutely impossible. Great resistance must have been made, and violent wars insued; which was not the case. This account given by Wallingford, tho' he stands single, must be admitted as the only true one. We are told, that the name <HI>Lurdane, lord Dane,</HI> for an idle lazy fellow, who lives at other people's expence, came from the conduct of the Danes, who were put to death. But the English princes had been entirely masters for several generations; and only supported a military corps of that nation. It seems probable, therefore, that it was these Danes only that were put to death.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1002.</NOTE> Secret orders were dis∣patched
to commence the execution every where on the
same day;<NOTE PLACE="marg">13. Nov.</NOTE> and the festival of St. Brice, which fell on a
Sunday, the day on which the Danes usually bathed
themselves, was chosen for that purpose. It is needless
to repeat the accounts transmitted of the barbarity of this
massacre: The rage of the populace, excited by so many
injuries, sanctified by authority, and stimulated by ex∣ample,
distinguished not between innocence and guilt,
spared neither sex nor age, and was not satiated without
the tortures, as well as death, of the unhappy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 64. H. Hunt. p. 360. Hoveden, p. 429. Higden, p. 271. Abbas Rieval. p. 362. Brompton, p. 885. Matth. West. p. 200. Ypod. Neust. p. 427.</NOTE>
Even Gunilda, sister to the King of Denmark, who had
married earl Paling, and had embraced Christianity, was,
from the advice of Edric, earl of Wilts, seized and con∣demned
to death by Ethelred, after seeing her husband
and children butchered before her face. The unhappy
princefs
<PB N="151" REF="167"/>
princess foretold, in the agonies of despair, that her
murder would soon be avenged by the total ruin of the
English nation<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEVER was prophecy better fulfilled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1003.</NOTE> and never did
barbarous policy prove more fatal to the actors. Sweyn
and his Danes, who wanted but a pretence to invade the
English, appeared off the western coast, and threatened
to take full revenge for the slaughter of their country∣men.
Exeter fell first into their hands, from the negli∣gence
or treachery of earl Hugh, a Norman, who had
been made governor by the interest of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Queen
Emma<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 133. H. Hunt. p. 360. Hoveden, p. 429. Sim. Dun. p. 165.</NOTE>. They began to spread their devastations over
the country; when the English, sensible of what outrages
they must now expect from their barbarous and offended
enemy, assembled more early and in greater numbers,
than usual, and made an appearance of vigorous resistance.
But all these preparations were frustrated by the treachery
of duke Alfric, who was intrusted with the command,
and who, feigning sickness, refused to lead the army
against the Danes till it was dispirited, and at last dissi∣pated,
by his fatal misconduct<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 133. H. Hunt. p. 360. Hoveden, p. 429. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 33. Sim. Dun. p. 165. Brompton, p. 885.</NOTE>. Alfric soon after died;
and Edric, a greater traitor than he, who had married
the King's daughter, and had acquired a total ascendant

and in the command of the English armies<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 63. Hoveden, p. 430. Chron. Mail. p. 154.</NOTE>. A great

of the inhabitants<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 133. W. Malm. p. 63. H. Hunt. p. 360.</NOTE>. The country, wasted by the
<PB N="152" REF="168"/>
Danes, harassed by the sruitless expeditions of its own
forces, was reduced to the utmost desolation; and at last
submitted to the infamy of purchasing a precarious peace

<P>THE English endeavoured to employ this interval in
making preparations against the return of the Danes,
which they had reason soon to expect. A law was made,
ordering the proprietors of eight hydes of land to provide
themselves of a horseman and a compleat suit of armour;
and thofe of 310 hydes to equip a ship for the defence of the coast<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 136. H. Hunt. p. 360. Hoveden, p. 430. Sim. Dun. p. 166. Brompton, p. 887. Matth West. p. 198. Flor. Wigorn. p. 612.</NOTE>. When this navy was assembled, which
must have consisted of near eight hundred vessels<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">There were 243,600 hydes in England. Consequently the ships equiped must be 785. The cavalry was 30,450 men.</NOTE>, all
hopes of its success were disappointed by the factions,
animosities, and dissensions of the nobility. Edric had
impelled his brother Brightric to advance an accusation
of treason against Wolfnoth, governor of Sussex, the fa∣ther
of the famous earl Godwin; and that nobleman,
well acquainted with the malevolence as well as power
of his enemy, found no other means of safety but in
deserting with twenty ships to the Danes. Brightric
pursued him with a fleet of eighty sail; but his ships
being shattered in a tempest, and stranded on the coast,
he was suddenly attacked by Wolfnoth, and all his
vessels burnt and destroyed<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 137. W. Malm. p. 63. Hoveden, p. 430. Sim. Dun. p. 166.</NOTE>. The imbecility of the
King was little capable of repairing this miscarriage:
The treachery of Edric frustrated every plan of future
defence<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 431. Sim. Dun. p. 167. Brompton, p. 887:</NOTE>: And the English navy, disconcerted, dis∣couraged,

<P>IT is impossible, and would be tedious, to relate par∣ticularly
all the miseries to which the English were
thenceforth exposed. We hear of nothing but the sack∣ing
and burning of towns; the devastations of the open
country; the appearance of the enemy in every quarter
of the kingdom; their cruel diligence in discovering any
corner which had not been ransacked by their former
violence. The broken and disjointed narration of the
antient historians is here well adapted to the nature of the
war, which was conducted by such sudden inroads, as
would have been dangerous even to an united and well
governed kingdom, but proved fatal, where nothing but
a general consternation, and mutual diffidence and dis∣sension
prevailed. The governors of one province re∣fused
to march to the assistance of another, and were at
last terrified from assembling their forces for the defence
of their own province<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 140.</NOTE>. General councils were assem∣bled;
but either no resolution was taken, or none was
executed. And the only expedient in which the English
agreed, was the base and imprudent one, of buying
anew a peace of the Danes by the payment of 48,000
pounds<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 432. Chron. Mail, p. 154. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 35. Sim. Dun. p. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS measure did not bring them even that short in∣terval
of repsse which they had expected from it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1011.</NOTE> The
Danes, nelecting all engagements, continued their de∣vastations and hostilities; levied a new contribution of
8000 pounds from the county of Kent alone; murdered
the archbishop of Canterbury, who had refused to coun∣tenance
this exaction<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 142. Eadmer, p. 4.</NOTE>. and the English nobility found
<PB N="154" REF="170"/>
no other resource than that of submitting every where to
the Danish monarch, swearing allegiance to him, and
delivering him hostages for their good behaviour<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dun. p. 169, 170.</NOTE>. Ethel∣red,
equally afraid of the violence of the enemy, and
the treachery of his own subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1013.</NOTE> fled into Normandy,
whither he had sent before him Queen Emma, and her
two sons, Alfred and Edward<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 144. W. Malm. p. 70.</NOTE>. Richard received his
unhappy guests with a generosity which does honour to his memory.</P>
<P>THE King had not been above six weeks in Nor∣mandy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1014.</NOTE>
when he heard of the death of Sweyn, who ex∣pired
at Gainsborough, before he had time to establish
himself in his new acquired dominions<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dun. p. 170.</NOTE> The English
prelates and nobility, taking advantage of this event,
sent over a deputation to Normandy, inviting Ethelred
to return to them, expressing their desire of being go∣verned
again by their native prince, and intimating their hopes, that, being now better taught by experience,
he would avoid all those errors, which had been attended
with such misfortunes to himself and to his people<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 145. W. Malm. p. 71, Hoveden, p. 43<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Higden, p. 273. Sim. Dun. p. 171. Diceto, p. 466. Alured Beverl. p. 115.</NOTE>. But
the misconduct of Ethelred was incurable; and on his
resuming the government, he discovered the same inca∣pacity,
indolence, cowardice, and credulity, which had
so often exposed him to the insults of his enemies. His
son-in-law, Edric, notwithstanding his repeated treasons,
retained such influence at court, as to instil into the King
jealousies of Sigefert and Morcar, two of the chief no∣bles
of Mercia: He allured them into his houfe, where
he murdered them<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 71 H. Hunt. p. 362. Hoveden, p. 433. Sim. Dun. p. 171. Brompton, p. 892, 893.</NOTE>; while Ethelred participated in the
<PB N="155" REF="171"/>
infamy of this action, by confiscating their estates, and
thrusting into a convent the widow of Sigefert. She was
a woman of singular beauty and merit; and in a visit
which was paid her, during her confinement, by prince
Edmond, the King's eldest son, she inspired him with so
violent an affection, that he released her from the con∣vent,
and soon after married her, without his father's
consent<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 71.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN while the English found in Canute, the son
and successor of Sweyn, an enemy no less terrible than
the prince, from whom death had so lately delivered them.
He ravaged the eastern coast with merciless fury, and put
ashore all the English hostages at Sandwich, after having
cut off their hands and noses<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 145. W. Malm. p. 71. Hoveden, p. 433. Higden, p. 273.</NOTE>. He was obliged, by
the necessity of his affairs, to make a voyage to Den∣mark;
but returning soon after, he continued his depre∣dations
along the southern coast; and even broke into
the counties of Dorset, Wilts, and Somerset; where an
army was assembled against him, under the command of
prince Edmond and duke Edric. The latter still conti∣nued
his perfidious machinations; and after endeavour∣ing
in vain to get the prince into his power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1015.</NOTE> found
means to dissipate the army, and he then openly deserted
to Canute with forty vessels<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 146. W. Malm. p. 71. H. Hunt. p. 362. Hoveden, p. 433.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this misfortune, Edmond was
hot disconcerted; but assembling together all the force of
England, was in a condition to give the enemy battle.
The King had had such frequent experience of perfidy
among his subjects, that he had lost all confidence in
them; and he remained at London, pretending sick∣nefs,
but really from apprehensions, that they intended

his enemies.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dun. p. 172. Brompton, p. 893.</NOTE> The army called aloud for their sovereign

and after making some fruitless expeditions into the north,
which had submitted entirely to Canute's power, he re∣tired

here found every thing in confusion by the death of
the King, who expired after an unhappy and inglorious

<HEAD>EDMOND Ironside.</HEAD>
<P>THIS prince, who received the name of Ironside from
his hardy valour, possessed courage and abilities suffi∣cient
to have saved his country from sinking into these
calamities, but not to raise it from that abyss of misery
into which it had already fallen. Among the other mis∣fortunes
of the English, treachery and difaffection had
crept in among the nobility and prelates; and Edmond
found no better expedient to prevent the farther progress
of these fatal evils, than to lead his army instantly into the
<PB N="157" REF="173"/>
field, and to employ them against the common enemy.
After meeting with some success at Gillingham<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72. H. Hunt. p. 363. Hoveden, p. 434. Higden, p. 273.</NOTE>. he pre∣pared
himself in one general engagement to decide the
fate of his crown, and at Scoerston, in the county of
Glocester, he offered battle to the enemy, who were
commanded by Canute and Edric. Fortune in the begin∣ning
of the day declared for him; but Edric, having cut
off the head of one Osmer, whose countenance resembled
that of Edmond, he fixed it on a spear, carried it thro' the
ranks in triumph, and called aloud to the English, that
it was time for them to fly; for behold! the head of
their sovereign<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72. Hoveden, p. 435. Higden, p. 273.</NOTE> And tho' Edmond, observing the con∣sternation
of the troops, took off his helmet<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72.</NOTE>, and
showed himself to them, the utmost he could gain by
his activity and valour was to leave the victory undecid∣ed.
Edirc took now a surer method to ruin him, by
pretending to desert to him; and as Edmond was well
acquainted with his power, and probably knew no other
of the chief nobility in whom he could repose more con∣fidence,
he was obliged, notwithstanding his repeated
perfidy, to give him a considerable command in his army<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72. Hoveden, p. 435.</NOTE>.
A battle soon after ensued at Assington in Essex; where
Edric, flying in the beginning of the day, occasioned the
total defeat of the English, followed by a great slaughter
of the nobility<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72. Hoveden, p. 435. Higden, p. 274. Wallingford, p. 549.</NOTE>. The indefatigable Edmond, however,
had still resources; and assembling a new army at Glo∣cester,
was again in a condition to dispute the field;
when the Danish and English nobility, equally harrassed
with these convulsions, obliged their kings to come to a
compromise, and to divide the kingdom between them
by treaty. Canute reserved to himself the northern di∣vision
<PB N="158" REF="174"/>
of Mercia, East-Anglia, and Northumberland,
which he had entirely subdued: The southern parts were
left to Edmond<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72.</NOTE>. This prince survived the treaty about
a month; and was murdered at Oxford by two of his
chamberlains, accomplices of Edric<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 363. Higden, p. 274. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 36. Diceto, p. 466. Brompton, p. 906.</NOTE>, who thereby made
way for the succession of Canute the Dane to the crown of England.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CANUTE the Great.</HEAD>
<P>THE English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1017.</NOTE> who had been unable to defend their
country, and maintain their independancy, under so
active and brave a prince as Edmond, could, after his
death, expect nothing but total subjection from Canute,
who, active and brave himself, was at the head of a
great force, and was ready to take advantage of the mi∣nority
of Edwin and Edward, the two sons of Edmond.
Yet this conqueror, who was commonly so little scrupu∣lous,
showed himself anxious to cover his injustice under
plausible pretences; and before he seized the dominions
of the English princes, he summoned a general assembly
of the states of England, in order to fix the succession
of the kingdom. He here suborned some nobles to de∣pose,
that, in the treaty of Glocester, it was agreed,
that, in case of Edmond's death, Canute should either
be his successor in his dominions, or be tutor to his chil∣dren
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 436. Higden, p. 274. Sim. Dun. p. 175. Abbas Rieval. p. 565. Brompton, p. 907.</NOTE> (for historians vary in this particular): And this
evidence, supported by the great power of Canute, de∣termined
the states immediately to put the Danish mo∣narch
in pssession of the government. Canute, jealous
of the two young princes, but sensible that he should
<PB N="159" REF="175"/>
render himself extremely odious, if he ordered them to
be dispatched in England, sent them abroad to his ally,
the king of Sweden, whom he desired, so soon as they
arrived at his court, to rid him, by their death, of all
farther anxiety. The Swedish monarch was too gene∣rous
to comply with this request; but being afraid to
draw on himself a quarrel with Canute, by protecting
the English princes, he sent them to Solomon, King of
Hungary, to be educated in his court<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 73. Hoveden, p. 436. Chron. Mailr. p. 155. Higden, p. 275. Sim. Dun. p. 176. Diceto, p. 466.</NOTE>. The elder,
Edwin, was afterwards married to Solomon's sister;
but dying without issue, that prince gave his sister-in-law,
Agatha, daughter of the Emperor Henry II. in mar∣riage
to Edward, the younger brother; and she bore him
Edgar Atheling, Margaret, afterwards Queen of Scot∣land,
and Christina, who retired into a convent.</P>
<P>CANUTE, tho' he had reached his great point of am∣bition,
in obtaining possession of the English crown, was
obliged at first to make great sacrifices to it; and to gra∣tify
the chief of the nobility, by bestowing on them the
most extensive governments and jurisdictions. He created
Thurkill earl or duke of East-Anglia, (for these titles
were then nearly of the same import) Yric of Northum∣berland,
and Edric of Mercia; reserving only to himself
the administration of Wessex<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 151. W. Malm. p. 73. Hoveden, p. 436, Higden, p. 274. Brompton, p. 906.</NOTE>. But seizing afterwards
a favourable opportunity, he expelled Thurkill and Yric
from their governments, and banished them the king∣dom<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 437.</NOTE>: He put to death <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>many of the English nobility, on
whose fidelity he could no▪ rely, and whom he hated
<PB N="160" REF="176"/>
on account of their infidelity to their native prince<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 363. Abbas Rieval. p. 365.</NOTE>:
And even the traitor, Edric, having had the assurance
to reproach him with his services, was condemned to be
executed, and his body to be thrown into the Thames;
a suitable reward for his multiplied acts of perfidy and
rebellion<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 73. Hoveden, p. 436.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CANUTE also found himself obliged, in the begin∣ning
of his reign, to load the people with heavy taxes,
in order to reward his Danish followers; and he exacted
from them at one time the sum of 72,000 pounds; be∣sides
11,000 pounds, which he levied from London
alone<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 151. H. Hunt. p. 363. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 37</NOTE>. He was probably willing, from political mo∣tives,
to mulct severely that city, on account of its af∣fectionate
adhering to Edmond, and its resisting, dur∣ing
the late reign, the Danish power in two obstinate
sieges<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W Malm. p. 72. In one of these sieges, Canute diverted the course of the Thames, and by that means brought hi ships above Lon∣don bridge.</NOTE> But these rigors were imputed to necessity;
and Canute, like a wise prince, was determined, that
the English people, now deprived of all their dangerous
leaders, should be reconciled to the Danish yoke, by the
justice and equality of his administration<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 58.</NOTE>. He sent back
to Denmark as many of his followers as he could safely

law, to protect the lives and properties of all his people.
The Danes were gradually incorporated with his new
subjects; and both were glad to breathe a little from
those multiplied calamities, from which the one, no less
<PB N="161" REF="177"/>
than the other, had, in their fierce contest for power,
experienced such fatal consequences.</P>
<P>THE removal of Edmond's children into so distant a
country as Hungary, was, next to their death, regarded by Canute as the greatest security of his government;
and he had no farther anxiety, except with regard to
Alfred and Edward, who were protected and supported
by their uncle, Richard, duke of Normandy. Richard
even fitted out a great armament, in order to restore the
English princes to the throne of their ancestors, and
tho' the navy was dispersed by a storm, Canute saw the
danger to which he was exposed, from the animosity of
so warlike a people as the Normans. In order to ac∣quire
the friendship of the duke, he paid his address to
Queen Emma, the sister of that prince; and promised,
that he would leave the children whom he should have
by that marriage, in possession of the crown of England.
Richard complied with his demand, and sent over Em∣ma
to England, where she was soon after married to
Canute<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 151. W. Malmes. p. 73.</NOTE>. The English, tho' they disapproved of her
espousing the mortal enemy of her former husband and
his family, were pleased to find at court a sovereign to
whom they were accustomed, and who had already form∣ed
connections with them: And thus Canute, besides
securing, by his marriage, the alliance of Normandy,
gradually acquired, by the same means, the confidence
of his own people<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 73. Higden, p. 275.</NOTE>. The Norman prince survived not
long the marriage of Emma; and he left the inheritance
of the dutchy to his eldest son of the same name; who,
dying a year after him without children, was succeeded
by his brother Robert, a man of valour and ability.</P>
<P>CANUTE, having settled his power in England be∣yond
all danger of a revolution, made a voyage to Den∣mark,
<PB N="162" REF="178"/>
where he was attacked by the King of Sweden;
and he carried along with him a great body of the Eng∣lish, under the command of earl-Godwin. This noble∣man
had here an opportunity of performing a service,
by which he both reconciled the King's mind to the
English nation, and gaining to himself the friendship of
that prince, laid the foundation of that immense fortune
which he acquired to his family. He was stationed next
the Swedish camp; and observing a favourable opportu∣nity,
which he was obliged suddenly to seize, he at∣tacked
the enemy in the night, drove them from their
trenches, threw them into disorder, pursued his ad∣vantage,
and obtained a decisive victory over them.
Next morning, Canute, seeing the English camp en∣tirely
abandoned, imagined that these disaffected troops
had deserted to the enemy; and he was agreeably sur∣prised
to find that they were at that time engaged in
pusuit of the discomfited Swedes<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 73. H. Hunt. p. 364. Higden, p. 275. Bromp∣ton, p. 908. Matth. West. p. 207.</NOTE>. He was so pleased
with this success, and the manner of obtaining it, that
he bestowed his daughter in marriage upon Godwin,
and treated him ever after with the most entire confi∣dence
and regard.</P>
<P>IN another voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1028.</NOTE> which he made afterwards to Den∣mark,
Canute attacked Norway, and expelled the just,
but unwarlike Olaus, from his kingdom, of which he
retained possession till the death of that prince<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 153. H. Hunt. p. 364. Hoveden, p. 437. Chron. Mailr. p. 155. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 38.</NOTE>. He
had now by his conquests and valour attained the utmost
height of his ambition; and having leisure from wars
and intrigues, he felt the unsatisfactory nature of all
human enjoyments; and equally weary of the glories
and turmoils of this life, he began to cast his view to∣wards
<PB N="163" REF="179"/>
that future existence, which it is so natural for
the human mind, whether satiated by prosperity or dis∣gusted with adversity, to make the object of its atten∣tion.
Unfortunately, the spirit which prevailed in that
age gave a wrong direction to his devotion; and instead
of making atonement to those whom he had injured by
his former acts of violence, he employed himself entirely
in those exercises of piety, which the monks represented
as the most meritorious. He built churches, he endow∣ed
monasteries<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 61.</NOTE>, he enriched the ecclesiastics, and he
bestowed revenues for the support of chantries at Assing∣ton
and other places, where he appointed prayers to be said for the souls of those who had there fallen in battle
against him<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 73. Diceto, p. 467.</NOTE>. He even undertook a pilgrimage to
Rome<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 153. H. Hunt. p. 364. Hoveden, p. 437. In∣gulf, p. 59. Chron. Mailr. p. 155.</NOTE>, where he sojourned a considerable time; and
besides obtaining from the Pope some privileges for the
English school erected there, he engaged all the princes
through whose dominions he was obliged to pass, to de∣sist
from those heavy impositions and tolls, which they
were accustomed to exact from the English pilgrims<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 74, 75. Hoveden, p. 437. Ingulf, p. 59, 60. Higden, p. 275. Sim. Dun. p. 178.</NOTE>.
By this spirit of devotion, no less than by his equitable
and politic administration, he gained, in a good mea∣sure, the affections of his subjects.</P>
<P>CANUTE, who was the greatest and most powerful
prince of his time, sovereign of Denmark and Norway,
as well as of England, could not fail to meet with adu∣lation
from his courtiers; a tribute which is liberally
paid even to the meanest and weakest princes. Some of
his flatterers breaking out, one day, in admiration of
his grandeur, exclaimed that every thing was possible for
<PB N="164" REF="180"/>
him: Upon which the monarch, it is said, ordered his
chair to be set on the sea-shore, while the tide was mak∣ing;
and as the waters approached, he commanded them
to retire, and to obey the voice of him who was lord of the ocean. He feigned to sit some time in expectation
of their submission; but when the sea still advanced to∣wards
him, and began to wash him with its billows, he
turned to his courtiers, and remarked to them, that
every creature in the universe was feeble and impotent,
and that power resided with one Being alone, in whose
hands were all the elements of nature, who could say to
the ocean, <HI>Thus far fbalt thou go, and no farther,</HI> and who
could level with his nod the most towering piles of hu∣man
pride and ambition<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 276. Brompton, p. 912. Matth. West. p. 209. Angfia Sacra, vol. I. p. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE only memorable action which Canute performed
after his return from Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1031.</NOTE> was an expedition against
Malcolm, King of Scotland<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 153, 154.</NOTE>. During the reign of
Ethelred, there had been imposed a tax of a shilling a
hide on all the lands of England, which was commonly
called <HI>Danegelt;</HI> because the revenue had been employed,
either in buying peace with the Danes, or in making preparations against the inroads of that hostile nation.</P>
<P>That prince had required, that the same tax should be
paid by the lands of Cumberland, which were held by
the Scots; but Malcolm, a warlike prince, told him,
that, as he was always able to repulse the Danes by his
own power, he would neither submit to buy peace of
his enemies, nor pay others for resisting them. Ethel∣red,
offended at this reply, which contained a secret re∣proach
of his own conduct, undertook an expedition
against Cumberland; and tho' he committed ravages
upon the country<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 33. Sim. Dun. p. 164. Flor, Wigom. p. 610.</NOTE>, he could never bring Malcolm to a
<PB N="165" REF="181"/>
temper more submissive or compliant. Canute, after
his accession, summoned the Scottish King to acknow∣ledge
himself a vassal for Cumberland to the crown of
England; but Malcolm refused compliance, on pretence
that he owed this submission only to those princes, who
by right of blood inherited that kingdom. Canute was
not of a temper to bear this insult; and the King of
Scotland soon found, that the sceptre was in very dif∣ferent
hands from those of the feeble and irresolute
Ethelred. Upon Canute's appearing on his frontiers
with a formidable army, Malcolm agreed, that his grand∣son
and heir, Duncan, whom he put in possession of
Cumberland, should make the submissions required, and
that the heirs of Scotland should always acknowledge
themselves vassals to England for that province<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W, Malm. p. 74.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CANUTE passed four years in peace after this enter∣prize,
and he died at Shaftsbury<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 154. W. Malm. p. 76.</NOTE>; leaving three sons
behind him, Sweyn, Harold, and Hardicanute. Sweyn,
whom he had by his first marriage with Alfwen, daugh∣ter
of the earl of Hampshire, was crowned in Norway:
Hardicanute, whom Emma had born him, was in pos∣session
of Denmark: Harold, who was of the same mar∣riage
with Sweyn, was at that time in England.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>HAROLD Harefoot.</HEAD>
<P>THO' Canute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1035.</NOTE> in his treaty with Richard, duke
of Normandy, had stipulated, that his children by
Emma should succeed to the crown of England, he had
either thought himself freed from that engagement by
the death of Richard, or esteemed it dangerous to leave
an unsettled and newly conquered kingdom in the hands
of so young a prince as Hardicanute; and he therefore
<PB N="166" REF="182"/>
appointed, by his will, Harold successor to the crown<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 437. Chron. Mailr. p. 156. Sim. Dun. p. 179.</NOTE>.
This prince was besides upon the spot; he was favoured
by all the Danes<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 154. W. Malm. p. 76. H. Hunt. p. 364. In∣gulf, p. 61. Higden, p. 276.</NOTE>; and he got immediately possession of
his father's treasures, which might be equally useful,
whether he found it necessary to proceed by force or in∣trigue,
in insuring his succession<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 438. Sim. Dun. p. 179.</NOTE>. On the other hand,
Hardicanute had the suffrages of the English, who, on
account of his being born among them of Queen Em∣ma,
regarded him as their countryman; he was favour∣ed
by the articles of treaty with the duke of Normandy;
and above all, his party was espoused by earl Godwin,
the most powerful nobleman in the kingdom, especially
in the provinces of Wessex, the chief seat of the antient
English<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 154. W. Malm. p. 76. Higden, p. 276. Matth. West. p. 209.</NOTE>. Affairs were likely to come to a civil war;
when, by the interposition of the nobility of both par∣ties,
a compromise was made; and it was agreed, that
Harold should enjoy, together with London, all the pro∣vinces
north of the Thames, while the possession of the
south should remain to Hardicanutc: And till that
prince should appear and take possession of his dominions,
Emma fixed her residence at Winchester, and established
her authority over her son's share of the partition<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 154. H. Hunt. p. 364. Ingulph, p. 61. Chron. Mailr. p. 156.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, Robert, duke of Normandy, died in a
pilgrimage to the holy land, and being succeeded by a
son, yet a minor, the two English princes, Alfred and
Edward, who found no longer any countenance or pro∣tection
in that country, gladly embraced the opportunity
of paying a visit, with a numerous retinue, to their mo∣ther
Emma, who seemed to be placed in a state of so
<PB N="167" REF="183"/>
much power and splendor at Winchester. But the face
of affairs soon wore a more melancholy aspect. Earl
Godwin had been gained by the arts of Harold, who
gave him hopes, that he would espouse his daughter;
and while the treaty was yet a secret, these two tyrants
laid a plan for the destruction of the English princes.
Alfred was invited to London by Harold with many pro∣fessions
of friendship; but when he had reached Guil∣ford,
he was set upon by Godwin's vassals, about six
hundred of his train were murdered in the most cruel
manner, he himself was taken prisoner, his eyes were
put out, and he was conducted to the monastery of Ely,
where he died soon after<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 365. Ypod. Neustr. p. 434. Hoveden, p. 438. Chron. Mailr. p. 156. Higden, p. 277. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 39. Sim. Dun. p. 179.

of <HI>Harefoot,</HI> which he acquired from his agility in
running and walking. He died the 14th of April,

<HEAD>HARDICANUTE.</HEAD>
<P>HARDICANUTE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1059.</NOTE> or Canute the Hardy, that
is, the robust (for he too is chiefly known by his
bodily accomplishments) tho', by remaining so long in
Denmark, he had been deprived of his share in the par∣tition
of the kingdom, had not abandoned his preten∣sions,
and had determined, before Harold's death, to re∣cover
by arms, what he had lost, either by his own ne∣gligence,
or by the necessity of his affairs. On pretence
of paying a visit to the Queen Dowager in Flanders, he
had assembled a fleet of sixty sail, and was preparing to
make a descent on England<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 438. Sim. Dun. p. 180.</NOTE>, when intelligence of his
brother's death, induced him to sail immediately to Lon∣don,
where he was received in triumph, and acknow∣ledged
King without opposition.</P>
<P>THE first act of Hardicanute's government afforded
the English a very bad prognostic of his future conduct.
He was so enraged at Harold, for depriving him of his
share of the kingdom, and for murdering his brother,
Alfred, that, in an impotent desire of revenge against
the dead, he ordered his body to be dug up, and to be
thrown into the Thames: And when it was found by
some fishermen, and buried in London, he ordered it
again to be dug up, and to be thrown again into the
Thames: But it was fished up a second time, and then
interred with great secrecy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 76. Hoveden, p. 438. Ingulph, p. 62. Chron. Mailr. p. 156. Higden, p. 276. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 39. Sim. Dun. p. 180. Brompton, p. 933. Flor. Wigorn. p. 623.</NOTE> Godwin, equally servile
and insolent, submitted to be his instrument, in this un∣natural
and brutal action.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="185"/>
THAT nobleman knew, that he was universally be∣lieved
to have been an accomplice in Alfred's death,
and that he was on that account very obnoxious to the
King; and perhaps he thought, by displaying this rage
against Harold's memory, to justify himself from having
had any participation in his counsels. But prince Ed∣ward,
being invited over by the King his half brother<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. 156. W. Malm. p. 76. H. Hunt. p. 365.</NOTE>,
immediately on his appearance, entered an accusation against Godwin for the murder of Alfred, and demand∣ed
justice upon him for that act of barbarity. Godwin,
in order to appease the King, made him a magnificent
present of a galley with a gilt stern, rowed by fourscore
men, who wore each of them a gold bracelet on his arm,
weighing sixteen ounces, and was armed and
cloathed in the most sumptuous manner. Hardicanute,
pleased with the splendor of this spectacle, quickly for∣got
his brother's murder; and on Godwin's swearing
that he was innocent of that crime, he allowed him to
be acquitted<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 77. Hoveden, p. 439. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, P. 39. Sim. Dun, p. 180.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' Hardicanute, before his accession, had been cal∣led
over by the vows of the English, he soon lost the
affections of the nation by his misconduct; but nothing
appeared more grievous to them, than his renewing the
imposition of Danegelt, and obliging the nation to pay
a great sum of money to the fleet, which brought him over
from Denmark. The discontents went high in many
places; and in Worcester the populace rose, and put
to death two of the collectors<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 76.</NOTE>. The King, enraged at
this opposition, swore vengeance against the city, and
ordered three noblemen, Godwin, duke of Wessex, Si∣ward,
duke of Northumberland, and Leofric, duke of
Mercia, to execute his menaces with the utmost rigor.
They were obliged to set fire to the city, and deliver it
<PB N="170" REF="186"/>
up to be plundered by their soldiers; but they saved the
lives of the inhabitants; whom they confined in a small
island of the Severn, called Beverey, till, by their inter∣cession,
they were able to appease the King, and obtain
the pardon of the supplicants<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 439. Higden, p. 276. Sim. Don. p. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS violent government was of very short duration.
Hardicanute died in two years after his accession, at the
marriage of a Danish lord, which he had honoured with
his presence<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 439. Sim. Dun. p. 181. Flor. Wigorn. p. 623.</NOTE>. His usual habits of intemperance and
gluttony were so well known, that, notwithstanding his
robust constitution, his sudden death gave as little sur∣prize,
as it did sorrow, to his subjects.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD the Confessor.</HEAD>
<P>THE English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1041.</NOTE> on the death of Hardicanute, saw a
favourable opportunity offered for recovering their
liberty, and for shaking off the Danish yoke, under
which they had so long laboured. Sweyn, King of
Norway, the eldest son of Canute, was absent; and
as the two last Kings had died without issue, there ap∣peared
none of that race, whom the Danes could sup∣port
as successor to the throne. Prince Edward was for∣tunately
at court on his brother's demise; and tho' th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
descendants of Edmond Ironside were the true heirs of
the Saxon family, yet their absence in so remote a coun∣try
as Hungary, appeared a sufficient reason for their
exclusion to a people like the English, so little accus∣tomed
to observe a regular order in the succession of
their monarchs. All delays might be dangerous; and
the present occasion must hastily be embraced; while the
Danes, without concert, without a leader, astonished at
the present incident, and anxious only for their personal
<PB N="171" REF="187"/>
safety, dared not to oppose the united voice of the whole
nation.</P>
<P>BUT this concurrence of circumstances in Edward's
favour might have failed of its effect, had his succes∣sion
been opposed by Godwin, whose power, alliances,
and abilities gave him a great influence at all times,
much more in those sudden emergencies, which always
attend a revolution of government, and which, either
seized or neglected, commonly prove so decisive. There
were circumstances, which divided men's hope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and fears
with regard to their expectations of Godwin's conduct.
On the one hand, the credit of that nobleman lay chief∣ly
in Wessex, which was almost entirely peopled with
English; and it was therefore presumed, that he would
second the wishes of his people, in restoring the Saxon
line, and in humbling the Danes, from whom he, as
well as they, had reason to dread, as they had already
felt, the most grievous oppressions. On the other hand,
there subsisted a declared animosity between Edward
and Godwin, on account of Alfred's murder; of which
the latter had publicly been accused by the prince, and
which he might believe so deep an offence, as could ne∣ver,
on account of any subsequent merits, be sincerely
pardoned. But their common friends here interposed;
and representing the necessity of their good correspon∣dence,
obliged them to lay aside all jealousy and ran∣cour,
and concur in restoring liberty to their native
country. Godwin only stipulated, that Edward, as a
pledge of his sincere reconcilement, should promise to
marry his daughter, Editha<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malm, p. 80. H. Hunt. p. 365. Ingulph, p. 62.</NOTE>; and having fortified him∣self
by this alliance, he summoned at Gillingham a ge∣neral
council of the nation, and prepared every measure
for securing the succession to Edward. The English
were unanimous and zealous in their resolutions; the
<PB N="172" REF="188"/>
Danes were divided and dispirited: Any small opposi∣tion,
which appeared in this assembly, was brow-beaten
and suppressed; and Edward was crowned King, with the highest demonstrations of duty and affection<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 80.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE triumph of the English, upon this signal and de∣cisive
advantage, was at first attended with some insult
and violence against the Danes; but the new King, by
the mildness of his character, soon reconciled the latter
to his administration, and the distinction between the
two nations gradually disappeared. They were inter∣spersed
with the English in most of the provinces; they
spoke nearly the same tongue; they differed little in their
manners and laws; the prevalence of domestic dissen∣sions
in Denmark, prevented, for a long time, any
powerful invasion from thence<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">In the year 1046, the Danes made an invasion from twenty-five ships, the only one we read of during this reign. Chron. Sax. p. 158.

their animosities; and as the Norman conquest, which
ensued soon after, reduced both nations to equal sub∣jection,
there is no farther mention in our histories of
any difference between them. The joy, however, of
their present deliverance made such impression on the
minds of the English, that they instituted an annual fes∣tival
for celebrating that great event; and it was ob∣served
in some counties, even to the age of Spellman<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Spellm. Glossary in verbo <HI>Hocday.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE popularity, which Edward enjoyed on his ac∣cession,
was not destroyed by the first act of his admini∣stration,
the resuming all the grants of his immediate
predecessors; an attempt, which is commonly attended
with the most dangerous consequences. The poverty of
the crown convinced the nation, that this act of vio∣lence
was become absolutely necessary; and as the loss
<PB N="173" REF="189"/>
fell chiefly on the Danes, who had obtained large
grants from the late Kings, their countrymen, on ac∣count
of their services in subduing the kingdom, the
English were rather pleased to see them reduced to their
primitive poverty. The King's severity also towards his
mother the Queen-dowager, tho' exposed to some more
censure, met not with very general disapprobation. He
had hitherto lived on very indifferent terms with that
princess: He accused her of neglecting him and his bro∣ther
during their adverse fortune<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 237.</NOTE>: He remarked, that
as the superior qualities of Canute, and his better treat∣ment
of her<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 64. 80. Brompton, p. 906.</NOTE>, had made her entirely indifferent to the
memory of Ethelred, she also gave the preference to her
children of the second bed, and always regarded Hardi∣canute
as her favourite. The same reasons had pro∣bably
made her unpopular in England; and tho' her be∣nefactions
to the monks obtained her the favour of that
order, the nation was not, in general, displeased to see
her stripped by Edward of immense treasures which she
had amassed<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 157. W. Malm. p. 80. Hoveden, p. 439. Higden, p. 277.</NOTE>. He confined her, during the remainder
of her life, to a monastery in Winchester; but carried
no farther his rigour against her. The stories of his ac∣cusing
her of a participation in her son, Alfred's mur∣der,
and of a criminal correspondence with the bishop
of Winchester, and also of her justifying herself by tread∣ing
unhurt with her bare feet over nine burning plow∣shares,
were the inventions of the monkish historians,
and were propagated and believed from the silly wonder
of posterity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 277.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English flattered themselves, that, by the ac∣cession
of Edward, they were delivered for ever from
the dominion of foreigners; but they soon found, that
that evil was not yet entirely removed. The King had
<PB N="174" REF="190"/>
been educated in Normandy; and had contracted many
intimacies with the natives of that country, as well as
an affection to their manners<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ingulph, p. 62.</NOTE>. The court of England
was soon filled with Normans, who being distinguished,
both by the favour of Edward, and by a degree of culti∣vation
somewhat superior to that of the English in those
ages, soon rendered their language, customs and laws
fashionable in the kingdom. The study of the French
tongue became general among the people. The courti∣ers
affected to imitate that nation in their dress, equi∣page,
and entertainments: Even the lawyers employed a foreign language in their deeds and papers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ingulph, p. 62.</NOTE>: But above
all, the church felt the influence and dominion of these
strangers: Ulf and William, two Normans, who had
formerly been the King's chaplains, were created bi∣shops
of Dorchester and London. Robert was promoted
to the see of Canterbury<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 161.</NOTE> and always enjoyed the high∣est
favour of his master, of which his abilities rendered
him not unworthy. And tho' the King's prudence or
his want of authority, made him confer almost all the
civil and military employments on the natives, the eccle∣siastical
preferments fell often to the share of the Nor∣mans;
and as the latter possessed Edward's confidence,
they had secretly a great influence on public affairs, and
excited the jealousy of the English, particularly of earl
Godwin<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 80.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS powerful nobleman, besides being duke or earl
of Wessex, had, annexed to his government, the coun∣ties
of Kent and Sussex. His eldest son, Swayn, pos∣sessed
the same authority in the counties of Oxford, Berks,
Glocester and Hereford: And Harold, his second son,
was duke of East-Anglia, augmented by the government
<PB N="175" REF="191"/>
of Essex<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 441. Higden, p. 279. Sim. Dun. p. 184.</NOTE>. The exorbitant authority of his family was
supported by immense possessions and powerful allian∣ces;
and the abilitirs, as well as ambition, of Godwin
himself contributed to render it still more dangerous. A
prince of greater capacity and vigour than Edward would
have found it difficult to support the dignity of the crown
under such circumstances; and as the haughty temper of
Godwin made him often forget the respect, due to his
prince, Edward's animosity against him was grounded
on personal as well as political considerations, on recent
as well as more antient injuries. The King, in pur∣suance
of his engagements, had indeed married Editha,
the daughter of Godwin<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 157.</NOTE>; but this alliance became ra∣ther
the source of enmity between them. Edward's
hatred of the father was transferred to that princess;
and Editha, tho' possessed of many amiable accomplish∣ments,
never could acquire the confidence and affection
of her husband. It is even pretended, that, during the
whole course of her life, he abstained from all commerce
of love with her; and such was the absurd admiration,
paid to an inviolable chastity, during those ages, that
his conduct in this particular is highly celebrated by the
monkish historians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1048.</NOTE> and contributed to his acquiring the
title of saint and confessor<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 80. Higden, p. 277. Abbas Rieval. p. 366. 377. Matth. West. p. 221. Chron. Thom. Wykes, p. 21. Anglia Sacra, vol. I. p. 241.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE most popular pretence, on which Godwin could
ground his discontents against the King and his admini∣stration,
was to complain of the influence of the Nor∣mans
in the government; and a declared opposition had
thence arisen between him and these favourites. It was
not long before this animosity broke out into action.
Eustace, count of Bologne, having paid a visit to the
King, passed by Dover on his return; and one of his
<PB N="176" REF="192"/>
train, being refused access to a lodging, which had been
assigned him, attempted to make his way by force, and
he wounded the master of the house in the contest. The
townsmen revenged this insult by the death of the stran∣ger;
the count and his train took arms, and murdered
the townsman within his own house; a tumult ensued;
near twenty persons were killed on each side; and Eus∣tace,
being overpowered with numbers, was obliged by
flight to save his life from the fury of the populace<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 162. W. Malm. p. 81. Hoveden, p. 441. Higden, p. 279. Sim. Dun. p. 184.</NOTE>.
He hurried immediately to court; complained of the
usage he had met with; the King entered zealously into
the quarrel, and resented that a stranger of such dis∣tinction,
whom he had invited over to his court, should, without any just cause, as he believed, have felt so sen∣sibly
the insolence and animosity of his people. He gave
orders to Godwin, in whose government Dover lay, to
go immediately to the place, and to punish the inhabi∣tants
for the crime: But Godwin, who desired rather
to encourage, than repress, the popular discontent against
foreigners, refused obedience, and endeavoured to throw
the whole blame on the count of Boulogne, and his re∣tinue<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 163. W. Malm. p. 81. Higden, p. 179.</NOTE>.
Edward, touched in so sensible a point, saw
the necessity of exerting the royal authority; and he
threatened Godwin, if he persisted in his disobedience,
to make him feel the utmost effects of his resentment.</P>
<P>THE earl, perceiving a rupture to be unavoidable,
and pleased to embark in a cause, where he was likely
to be supported by his countrymen, prepared for his
own defence, or rather for an attack on Edward; and
under pretence of repressing some disorders on the Welsh
frontier, he secretly assembled a great army, and was ap∣proaching
the King, who resided, without any military
<PB N="177" REF="193"/>
force, and without suspicion, at Glocester<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 163. W. Malm. p. 81.</NOTE>. Edward
then applied for protection to Siward, duke of Nor∣thumberland,
and Leofric, duke of Mercia, two power∣ful
noblemen, whose jealousy of Godwin's greatness, as
well as their duty to the crown, engaged them to de∣fend
the King in this extremity. They hastened to him
with such of their followers as they could assemble on
the sudden; and finding the danger still greater than
they had apprehended, they issued orders for mustering all
the forces within their government, and for marching
them without delay to the defence of the King's person
and authority<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 441. Sim. Dun. p. 184.</NOTE>. Edward, meanwhile, endeavoured to
protract time by negotiation; while Godwin, who
thought the King entirely in his power, and who was
willing to save appearances, fell into the snare; and not
sensible, that he ought to have no farther reserve after
he had proceeded so far, he lost the favourable oppor∣tunity
of rendering himself master of the government.</P>
<P>THE English, tho' they had not a very high idea of
Edward's vigour and capacity, bore him great affection
on account of his humanity, justice, and piety, as well
as of the long race of their native kings, from whom he
was descended; and they hastened from all quarters to
defend him from the present danger. His army was
now so considerable, that he ventured to take the field;
and marching to London, he summoned a great council
of the kingdom, to judge of the rebellion of Godwin
and his sons. These noblemen pretended at first that
they were willing to stand their trial; but having in vain
endeavoured to make their adherents persist in rebellion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 441. Sim. Dun. p. 185.</NOTE>,
they offered to come to London, provided they might
receive hostages for their safety<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 279.</NOTE>; and this proposal being
<PB N="178" REF="194"/>
rejected, they were obliged to disband the remains of
their forces, and to have recourse to flight<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 164. W. Malm. p. 81, 82.</NOTE>. Baldwin,
earl of Flanders, gave protection to Godwin and his
three sons, Gurth, Sweyn, and Tosti; the latter of
whom had married the daughter of that prince: Harold
and Leofwin, two others of his sons, took shelter in
Ireland<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 441. Higden, p. 279. Alur. Beverl. p. 120.</NOTE>. The estates of the father and sons were con∣fiscated:
Their governments were given to others:
Queen Editha was confined to a monastery at Warewel:
And the greatness of this family, once so formidable,
seemed now to be totally supplanted and overthrown<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 165. W. Malm. p. 82. Hoveden, p. 441. Chron. Mailr. p. 157.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT Godwin had fixed his authority on too firm a
basis, and he was too strongly supported by alliances
both abroad and at home, not to occasion farther disturb∣ances,
and make new efforts for his re-establishment.
The earl of Flanders allowed him to purchase and hire
ships within his harbours;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1052.</NOTE> and Godwin, having manned
them with his followers, and with free-booters of all
nations, put to sea, and attempted to make a descent at
Sandwich. The King, informed of his preparations,
had equipped a considerable fleet, much superior to that
of the enemy; and the earl hastily, before their ap∣pearance,
made his retreat into the Flemish harbours<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dun. p. 186.</NOTE>.
The English court, allured by the present security, and
devoid of all vigorous councils, allowed the seamen to
disband, and the fleet to go to decay<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 166.</NOTE>; while Godwin, expecting this event, kept his men in a readiness for ac∣tion.
He put to sea immediately, and sailed to the Isle
of Wight, where he was joined by Harold with a squa∣dron,
which that nobleman had collected in Ireland.
He was now master of the sea; and entering every har∣bour
<PB N="179" REF="195"/>
in the southern coast, he seized all the ships<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 166.</NOTE>, and
summoned his followers in those counties, which had so
long been subjected to his government, to assist him in
procuring justice to himself, his family, and his country,
against the tyranny of foreigners<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 442. Sim. Dun. p. 186. Flor. Wigorn. p. 628.</NOTE>. Reinforced by great
numbers from all quarters, he entered the Thames; and
appearing at London, threw every thing into confusion.
The King alone seemed resolute to defend himself to the
last extremity; but the interposition of the English no∣bility,
many of whom favoured Godwin's pretensions,
made Edward hearken to terms of accommodation;
and the feigned<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> humility of the earl, who disclaimed all in∣tentions
of offering violence to his sovereign, and desired
only to justify himself by a fair and open trial, paved the
way for his more easy admission<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 167. W. Malm. p. 82.</NOTE>. It was stipulated,
that he should give hostages for his good behaviour, and
that the primate and all the foreigners should be banish∣ed<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 167, 168. W. Malm. p. 82. Chron. Mailr. p. 157. Higden, p. 279.</NOTE>:
And by this treaty, the present danger of a civil
war was obviated, but the authority of the crown was
considerably impaired, or rather entirely annihilated.
Edward, sensible that he had not power sufficient to se∣cure
Godwin's hostages in England, sent them over to his kinsman, the young duke of Normandy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 82. Hoveden, p. 449.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GODWIN's death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1053.</NOTE> which happened soon after, while
he was sitting at table with the King<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 81. H. Hunt. p. 366.</NOTE>, prevented him
from establishing fully the exorbitant authority which he
had acquired, and from reducing Edward to still greater
<PB N="180" REF="196"/>
subjection<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">The ingenious author of the article GODWIN, in the Biographia Bri∣tannica, has endeavoured to clear the memory of that nobleman, upon the supposition, that all the English annals had been falsified by the Nor∣man historians after the conquest. But that this supposition has not much foundation, appears hence, that almost all these historians have given a very good character of his son Harold, whom it was much more the in∣terest of the Norman cause to blacken.</NOTE>. He was succeeded in the government of
Wessex, Sussex, Kent, and Essex, and in the office of
steward of the household, a place of great power, by his
son, Harold, who was actuated by an ambition equal to
that of his father, and was superior to him in address,
in insinuation, and in virtue. By a modest and gentle
demeanour, he acquired the good-will of Edward; at
least, softened that hatred which the prince had so long
borne his family<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 948.</NOTE>; and gaining every day new parti∣zans
by his bounty and affability, he proceeded, in a
more silent, and therefore a more dangerous manner, to
the increase of his authority. The King, who had not
sufficient vigour directly to oppose his progress, knew
of no other expedient than that hazardous one, of rais∣ing
him a rival in the family of Leofric, duke of Mer∣cia,
whose son, Algar, was invested in the government
of East-Anglia, which, before the banishment of Ha∣rold,
had belonged to this latter nobleman. But this
policy, of balancing opposite parties, required a more
steady hand to manage it than that of Edward, and na∣turally
produced faction, and even civil broils, among
nobles of such mighty and independant authority. Al∣gar
was soon after expelled his government by the in∣trigues
and power of Harold<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 169. H. Hunt. p. 366. Hoveden, p. 443. Ingulf, p. 66. Chron. Mailr. p. 158. Higden, p. 281.</NOTE>; but being protected by
Griffith, prince of Wales, who had married his daugh∣ter,
as well as by the power of his father, Leofric, he
obliged Harold to submit to an accommodation, and was
re-instated in the government of East-Anglia. This
<PB N="181" REF="197"/>
peace was not of long continuance: Harold, taking ad∣vantage
of Leofric's death, which happened soon after,
expelled Algar anew, and banished him the kingdom<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 444.</NOTE>
And tho' that nobleman made a fresh irruption into East-Anglia
with an army of Norwegians, and over-run the
country<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 66. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 44.</NOTE>, his death, a short time after, freed Harold
from the pretensions of so dangerous a rival. Edward,
his eldest son, was indeed advanced to the government of
Mercia; but the balance, which the King desired to
establish between these powerful families, was entirely
lost, and the influence of Harold entirely preponderated.</P>
<P>THE death of Siward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1055.</NOTE> duke of Northumberland, made
the way still more open to the ambition of that noble∣man.
Siward, besides his other merits, had acquired honour to England, by his successful conduct of the on∣ly
foreign enterprize which was undertaken during the
reign of Edward. Duncan, King of Scotland, was a
prince of a very gentle disposition, but possessed not vi∣gour
sufficient to govern a country so turbulent, and so
much infested by the intrigues and animosities of the
great. Macbeth, a powerful nobleman, and nearly al∣lied
to the crown, not contented with curbing the King's
authority, carried farther his pestilent ambition: He put
his sovereign to death; chaced Malcolm Kenmure, his
son and heir, into England; and usurped the crown.
Siward, whose daughter was married to Duncan, em∣braced,
by Edward's orders, the protection of this di∣stressed
family: He marched an army into Scotland; and
having defeated and killed Macbeth in battle, he re∣stored Malcolm to the thronc of his ancestors<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 79. Hoveden, p. 443. Chron. Mailr. p. 158. Buchanan. p. 115. edit. 1715.</NOTE>. This
service, added to his former connexions with the royal
family of Scotland, brought great accession to the autho∣rity
<PB N="182" REF="198"/>
of Siward in the north; but as he had lost his eldest
son, Osbern, in the action with Macbeth, it proved in
the issue fatal to his family. His second son, Walthoef,
appeared, on his father's death, too young to be entrust∣ed
with the government of Northumberland; and Ha∣rold's
influence obtained that dukedom to his brother,
Tosti<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt p. 366.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE are two circumstances related of Siward, which
discover his high sense of honour and his martial disposi∣tion.
When intelligence was brought him of his son
Osbern's death, he was inconsolable; till he heard,
that the wound was received in the breast, and that he
had behaved with great gallantry in the action<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 366. Higden, p. 280. Brompton, p. 946.</NOTE> When
he found his own death approaching, he ordered his ser∣vants
to cloathe him in a complete suit of armour; and
sitting erect on the couch, with a spear in his hand, de∣clared,
that, in that posture, the only one worthy of a
warrior, he would patiently await the fatal moment<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 281. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. Diceto, p. 477.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, now worn with cares and infirmities, felt
himself far advanced in the decline of life; and having
no issue himself, began to think of fixing a successor to
the kingdom. He sent a deputation into Hungary, to
invite over his nephew, Edward, son to his elder bro∣ther,
and the only remaining heir of the Saxon line<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt, p. 366. Hoveden, p. 444. Ingulf, p. 66. Chron. Mailr. p. 158.</NOTE>.
That prince, whose succession to the crown would have
been easy and undisputed, came over to England with his
children, Edgar, surnamed Atheling, Margaret, and
Christina; but his death, which happened a few days af∣ter
his arrival, threw the King into new difficulties.
He saw, that the great power and ambition of Harold
had tempted him to think of obtaining possession of the
<PB N="183" REF="199"/>
throne on the first vacancy, and that Edgar, on account
of his youth and inexperience, was very unfit to oppose
the pretensions of so popular and enterprising a rival.
The animosity which he had long borne earl Godwin,
made him averse to the succession of his son; and he
could not, without extreme reluctance, think of an in∣crease
of grandeur to a family, which had risen on the
ruins of royal authority, and which, by the murder of
Alfred, his brother, had contributed so much to the
weakening the Saxon line. In this uncertainty, he se∣cretly
cast his eye towards his kinsman, William duke
of Normandy, as the only person whose power, and cha∣racter,
and capacity, could support any destination which
he might make to the exclusion of Harold, and his fa∣mily<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 68.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS famous prince was natural son of Robert, duke
of Normandy, by Hariotta, daughter of a tanner in Fa∣laise<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 910.</NOTE>,
and was very early established in that grandeur,
from which his birth seemed to have set him at so great a
distance. While he was but nine years of age, his fa∣ther
had resolved to undertake a pilgrimage to Jerusa∣lem;
a fashionable act of devotion, which had taken
place of the pilgrimages to Rome, and which, as it was
attended with more difficulty and danger, and carried
these religious adventurers to the first sources of Christia∣nity,
appeared to them much more pious and meritori∣ous.
Before his departure, he assembled the states of the
dutchy; and informing them of his purpose, he en∣gaged
them to swear allegiance to his natural son, Wil∣liam,
whom, as he had no legitimate issue, he intended,
in case he should die in the pilgrimage, to leave succes∣sor
to his dominions<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 95.</NOTE> As he was a prudent prince, he
could not but foresee the great inconveniencies which
<PB N="184" REF="200"/>
must attend his journey, and this settlement of his suc∣cession;
arising from the natural turbulency of the great,
the claims from other branches of the ducal family, and
the power of the French monarch: But all these views
were superseded by the prevailing zeal for pilgrimages<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neustr. p. 452.</NOTE>;
and probably, the more important they were, the more
would Robert exult in sacrificing them to what he ima∣gined
to be his religious duty.</P>
<P>THIS prince, as he had apprehended, died in his pil∣grimage;
and the minority of his son was attended with
all those inconveniencies, which were unavoidable in his
situation. The licentious nobles, freed from the awe of
sovereign authority, broke out into personal animosities
against each other, and made the whole country a scene
of war and devastation<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 95. Gul. Ge∣met. lib. 7. cap. 1.</NOTE>. Roger, count of Toni, and
Alain, count of Britanny, advanced pretensions to the
dominion of the state; and Henry I. King of France,
thought the opportunity favourable for reducing the
power of a vassal, who had at first acquired his settlement
in such a violent and invidious manner, and who had
long appeared formidable to his sovereign<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 97.</NOTE>. The re∣gency
established by Robert found great difficulties in
supporting the government against this complication of
dangers; and the young prince, when he came to age,
found himself reduced to a very low condition. But the
great qualities, which he soon displayed in the field and
in the cabinet, gave encouragement to his friends, and
struck a terror into his enemies. He opposed himself on
all sides against his rebellious subjects, and against foreign
invaders; and by his valour and conduct prevailed in
every action. He obliged the French King to grant
him peace on reasonable terms; he expelled all pretend∣ers
to the sovereignty; and he reduced his turbulent ba
<PB N="185" REF="201"/>
to pay submission to his authority, and to suspend
their mutual animosities. The natural severity of his
temper appeared in a rigorous administration of justice;
and having found the happy effects of this plan of govern∣ment,
without which the laws in those ages became to∣tally
impotent, he established it as a fixed maxim, that
an inflexible conduct was the first duty of a sovereign.</P>
<P>THE tranquillity which he had established in his do∣minions
had given William leisure to pay a visit to the
King of England during the time of Godwin's banish∣ment;
and he was received in a manner suitable to the
great reputation which he had acquired, to the relation
by which he was connected with Edward, and to the
obligations which that prince had owed to his family<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 442. Ingulf, p. 65. Chron. Mailr. p. 157. Hig∣den, p. 279.</NOTE>.
On the return of Godwin, and the expulsion of the
Norman favourites, Robert, archbishop of Canterbury,
had, before his departure, persuaded Edward to think of
adopting William as his successor; a council, which was
favoured by the King's aversion to Godwin, his prepos∣sessions
towards the Normans, and his esteem of the
duke. That prelate, therefore, received a commission
to inform William of the King's intentions in his fa∣vour;
and he was the first person who opened the mind
of the prince to entertain these ambitious hopes<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 68. Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 31. Order. Vitalis, p. 492.</NOTE>. But
Edward, irresolute and feeble in his purpose, finding that
the English would more easily acquiesce in the restora∣tion
of the Saxon line, had, in the mean while, invited
his brother's descendants from Hungary, with a view of
having them recognized heirs to the throne<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 93. H. Hunt. p. 366.</NOTE>. The death
of his nephew, and the inexperience and unpromising
qualities of young Edgar, made him resume his former
<PB N="186" REF="202"/>
intentions in favour of the duke of Normandy; though
his aversion to hazardous enterprizes engaged him to
postpone the execution, and even to keep his purpose se∣cret
from all his ministers.</P>
<P>HAROLD, mean while, proceeded, after a more open
manner, in increasing his popularity, in establishing his
power, and in preparing the way for his advancement on
the first vacancy of the throne; an event which, from the
age and infirmities of the King, appeared not very distant.
But there was still an obstacle, which it was requisite for
him p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eviously to overcome. Earl Godwin, when re∣stored
to his power and fortune, had given hostages for
his good behaviour; and among the rest one son and one
grandson, whom Edward, for greater security, had sent
over to be kept in Normandy. Harold, tho' he was not
aware of the duke's being his competitor, was uneasy,
that such near relations should be detained prisoners in a
foreign country; and he was afraid, that William would,
in favour of Edgar, retain these pledges as a check on
the ambition of any other pretender<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 947.</NOTE>. He represented,
therefore, to the King his unfeigned submission to royal
authority, his steady duty to his prince, and the little
necessity there was, after such an uniform trial of his
obedience, to detain any longer those hostages, who had
been required on the first composing of civil discords. By
these topics, enforced by his great power, he extorted
the King's consent to release them; and to effectuate his
purpose, he immediately proceeded, with a numerous re∣tinue,
on his journey to Normandy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 449. Brompton, p. 947 Eadmer, lib. I. p. 4. Alur. Beverl. p. 125.</NOTE>. A tempest drove
him on the territory of Guy, count of Ponthieu, who,
being informed of his quality, immediately detained him
prisoner<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 449.</NOTE>, and demanded an exorbitant sum for his ran∣som.
<PB N="187" REF="203"/>
Harold found means to convey intelligence of his
condition to the duke of Normandy; and represented,
that, while he was proceeding to <HI>his</HI> court, in execution
of a commission from the King of England, he had met
with this harsh treatment from the mercenary disposition
of the count of Ponthieu.</P>
<P>WILLIAM was immediately sensible of the importance
of the incident. He foresaw, that, if he could once gain
Harold, either by favours or menaces, his way to the
throne of England would be open, and Edward would
meet with no farther obstacle in executing the favourable
intentions which he had entertained in his behalf. He
sent, therefore, an ambassador to Guy, in order to de∣mand
the liberty of his prisoner; and that nobleman, not
daring to refuse so great a prince, put Harold into the
hands of the Norman ambassador, who conducted him
to Roüen<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 93. Hoveden, p. 449. Brompton, p. 947. Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 31.</NOTE>. William received him with every demon∣stration
of respect and friendship; and after showing him∣self
disposed to comply with his desire, in delivering up
the hostages, he took an opportunity of disclosing to him
the great secret, of his pretensions to the crown of Eng∣land,
and of the will which Edward intended to make in
his favour. He desired the assistance of Harold in per∣fecting
that design; he made professions of the utmost
gratitude in return for so great an obligation; he pro∣mised
that the present grandeur of Harold's family, which
supported itself with difficulty under the jealousy and ha∣tred
of Edward, should receive new increase from a suc∣cessor,
who would be so sensibly beholden to him for his
advancement. Harold was surprized with this declara∣tion
of the duke; but being sensible, that he could ne∣ver
recover his own liberty, much less that of his brother
and nephew, if he refused the demand, he feigned a
<PB N="188" REF="204"/>
compliance with William, renounced all hopes of the
crown for himself, and professed his sincere intention of
supporting the will of Edward, and seconding the preten∣sions
of the duke of Normandy. William, to tie him
faster to his service, besides offering him his daughter in
marriage<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 93. H. Hunt. p. 366. Hoveden, p. 449. In∣gulf,
p. 68.</NOTE> required him to take an oath, that he would
fulfil his promises; and in order to render that oath more
binding, he employed an artifice, well suited to the ig∣norance
and superstition of the age. He secretly convey∣ed
under the altar, on which Harold agreed to swear, the
reliques of some of the most respected martyrs; and
when Harold had taken the oath, he showed him the re∣liques,
and admonished him to observe religiously an en∣gagement,
which had been ratified by so tremendous a
sanction<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Wace, p. 459,460. MS. penes Carte, p. 354. W. Malm. p. 93. H. Hunt. p. 366. Hoveden, p. 449. Bromp∣ton, p. 947.</NOTE>. The English nobleman was astonished; but
dissembling his concern, he renewed the same profes∣sions,
and was dismissed with all the marks of mutual
confidence by the duke of Normandy.</P>
<P>WHEN Harold found himself at liberty, his ambition
suggested casuistry sufficient to justify to him the violation
of an oath, which had been extorted from him by fear,
and which, if fulfilled, might be attended with the sub∣jection
of his native country to a foreign power. He
continued still to practise every art of popularity; to in∣crease
the number of his partizans; to reconcile the
minds of the English to the idea of his succession; to re∣vive
their hatred of the Normans; and by an ostentation
of his power and influence, to deter the timorous Ed∣ward
from executing his intended destination in favour of
William. Fortune, about this time, threw two inci∣dents
in his way, by which he was enabled to acquire
<PB N="189" REF="205"/>
general favour, and to increase the character, which he
had already obtained, of virtue and capacity.</P>
<P>THE Welsh, tho' a less formidable enemy than the
Danes, had been long accustomed to infest the western
borders; and after committing spoil on the low coun∣tries,
they usually made a hasty retreat into their moun∣tains,
where they were sheltered from the pursuit of their
enemies, and were ready to seize the first favourable op∣portunity
of renewing their depredations. Griffith, their
present prince, had much distinguished himself in thse
incursions; and his name had become so terrible to the
English, that Harold found he could do nothing more
acceptable to the public, and more honourable to him∣self,
than the suppressing so dangerous an enemy. He
formed the plan of an expedition against Wales; and
having prepared some light-armed foot to pursue the na∣tives
into their fastnesses, some cavalry to scour the open
country, and a squadron of ships to attack the sea∣coast,
he employed at once all these forces against the Welsh,
prosecuted his advantages with vigour, made no inter∣mission
in his assaults, and at last reduced the enemy to
such distress, that, in order to prevent their total de∣struction,
they made a sacrifice of their prince, whose
head they cut off, and sent to Harold; and they were
contented to receive as their sovereigns two Welsh
noblemen appointed by Edward to rule over them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 170. W. Malm. p. 79. H. Hunt. p. 367. Hoveden, p. 446. Ingulf, p. 68. Chron. Mailr. p. 159. Higden, p. 283. Sim. Dun. 192.</NOTE>. The
other incident was no less honourable to Harold.</P>
<P>TOSTI, the elder brother of this nobleman, had been
created duke of Northumberland; but being of a violent,
tyrannical temper, had practised such cruelty and injus∣tice
over the inhabitants, that they rose in rebellion
against him, and chaced him from his government.
<PB N="190" REF="206"/>
Morcar and Edwin, two brothers, who possessed great
power in those quarters, and who were grandsons of the
great duke, Leofric, concurred in the insurrection; and
the former, being elected duke, advanced with an army,
to oppose Harold, who was commissioned by the King to
reduce and punish the Northumbrians. Before the
armies came to action, Morcar, well acquainted with
the generous disposition of the English commander, en∣deavoured
to justify his conduct; and represented to him,
that Tosti had behaved in a manner unworthy of the sta∣tion
to which he was advanced, and no one, not even a
brother, could support such tyranny, without participat∣ing,
in some degree, of the infamy attending it; that the
Northumbrians, accustomed to a legal administration,
and regarding it as their birth-right, were willing to sub∣mit
to the King, but required a governor who would pay
regard to their rights and privileges; that they had been
taught by their ancestors, that death was preferable to
servitude, and had come to the field determined to perish
rather than bear a renewal of those indignities, to which
they had been so long exposed; and they trusted, that
Harold, on reflection, would not defend in another that
violent conduct, from which, in his own government,
he had always kept at so great a distance<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 283.</NOTE>. This vigor∣ous
remonstrance was accompanied with such a detail of
facts, so well supported, that Harold found it prudent to
abandon his brother's cause; and returning to Edward,
he persuaded him to pardon the Northumbrians, and to
confirm Morcar in the government<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 171. W. Malm. p. 83. H. Hunt. p. 367. Higden p. 283. Sim. Dun. p. 193.</NOTE>. He even married
the sister of that nobleman<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Order. Vitalis, p. 492.</NOTE>; and by his interest procured
Edwin, the younger brother, to be elected into the go∣vernment
of Mercia. Tosti in a rage departed the
<PB N="191" REF="207"/>
kingdom, and took shelter in Flanders with carl Bald∣win,
his father-in-law<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 367. Higden, p. 283. Sim. Dun. p. 193. Alur. Beverl. p. 122.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this marriage, Harold broke all measures with the
duke of Normandy; and William clearly perceived, that
he could no longer rely on the oaths and premises,
which he had extorted from him. But the English
nobleman thought himself now in such a situation, that
it was no longer necessary for him to dissemble. He had
in his conduct against the Northumbrians, given such a
specimen of his moderation as had gained him the affec∣tions
of his countrymen. He saw, that almost all Eng∣land
was under the command of himself or his friends;
while he possessed the government of Wessex, Morcar
that of Northumberland, and Edwin that of Mercia.
He now openly aspired to the succession; and insisted,
that, since it was necessary, by the confession of all, to
set aside the royal family, on account of the imbecility of
Edgar, the sole surviving heir, there was no one so ca∣pable
of filling the throne, as a nobleman, of great
power, of mature age, of long experience, of approved
courage and ability, who being a native of the kingdom,
would effectually secure it against the dominion and ty∣ranny
of foreigners. Edward, broken with age and in∣firmities,
saw the difficulties too great for him to encoun∣ter
and tho' his inveterate prepossessions kept him from
seconding the pretensions of Harold, he took but feeble
and irresolute steps for securing the succession to the duke
of Normandy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><P>The whole story of the transactions between Edward, Harold, and the duke of Normandy is told so differently by the antient writers, that there are few important passages of the English history liable to so great uncertainty. I have followed the account, which appeared to me the moil most consistent and probable. It does not seem likely, that Edward ever executed a will in the duke's favour, much less that he got it ra∣tified by the states of the kingdom, as is affirmed by some. The will would have been known to all, and would have been produced by the Conqueror, to whom it gave so plausible, and really so just a title; but the doubtful and ambiguous manner in which he seems always to have mentioned it, proves, that he could only plead the known intentions of that monarch in his favour, which he was desirous to call a will. There is indeed a charter of the Conqueror, preserved by Dr. Hickes, vol. 1. where he calls himself <HI>rex hereditarius,</HI> meaning heir by will; but a prince, possessed of so much power, and attended with so much success, may employ what pretences he pleases: It is sufficient to resute his pretences to observe, that there is a great diffidence and variation among the historians with regard to a point, which, had it been real, must have been agreed upon by all of them.</P>
<P>Again, some historians, particularly Malmesbury and Matthew Westminster, affirm that Harold had no intention of going over to Nor∣mandy, but that taking the air in a pleasure-boat on the coast, he was driven over by stress of weather to the territories of Guy count of Pon∣thieu: But besides that this story is not probable in itself, and is contra∣dicted by most of the ancient historians, it is refuted by a very curious and authentic monument lately discovered. It is a tapestry, preserved in the ducal palace of Roüen, and supposed to have been wrought by orders of Matilda, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to the Emperor: At least it is of very great anti∣quity. Harold is there represented as taking his departure from K. Ed∣ward in execution of some commission, and mounting his vessel with a great train. The design of redeeming his brother and nephew, who were hostages, is the most likely caufe that can be assigned; and is accordingly mentioned by Eadmer, Hoveden, Brompton, and Simeon of Durham. For a farther account of this piece of tapestry, see Histoire de I'Academie de Literature, tom. ix. page 535.</P></NOTE>. While he continued in this uncertain∣ty,
he was surprized by sickness, which brought him to
<PB N="192" REF="208"/>
his grave, on the fifth of January 1066, in the sixty-fifth
year of his age, and twenty-fifth of his reign.</P>
<P>THIS prince, to whom the monks gave the title of
saint and confessor, was the last of the Saxon line, who
ruled in England; and tho' his reign was peaceable and
fortunate, he owed this prosperity less to his own ability
than to the conjunctures of the times. The Danes, em∣ployed
in other enterprizes, attempted not those incur∣sions,
<PB N="193" REF="209"/>
which had been so troublesome to all his predeces∣sors,
and fatal to some of them. The facility of his
disposition made him acquiesce under the government of
Godwin and his son Harold; and the capacity, as well
as the power of these noblemen, enabled them, while
they were intrusted with authority, to preserve domestic
peace and tranquillity. The most commendable circum∣stance
of Edward's government was his attention to the
administration of justice, and his compiling for that pur∣pose
a body of laws, which he collected from the laws
of Ethelbert, Ina, and Alfred. This compilation, tho'
now lost (for the laws that pass under Edward's name
were composed afterwards<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spelm. in verbo <HI>Balliva.</HI></NOTE>) were long the objects of
affection to the English nation.</P>
<P>EDWARD the Confessor was the first who touched for
the King's evil: The opinion of his fanctity procured
belief to this cure among the people; and his successors,
regarded it as a part of their power and grandeur to up∣hold
the same opinion. It has been continued down to
our time; and the practice was first dropped by the pre∣sent
royal family, who observed, that it could no longer
give amazement even to the populace, and was attended with ridicule in the eyes of all men of understanding.</P>

<P>HAROLD had so well prepared matters before the

succeeded by the most undoubted hereditary title. The

or friendship, willingly seconded his pretensions. The
title of Edgar Atheling was searce ever mentioned;
Much less, the claim of the duke of Normandy: And
Harold, assembling the council, received the crown from
their hands, without waiting for any regular meeting of
the states, or submitting the question to their free choice
or determination<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">G. Pict. p. 196. Ypod. Neust. p. 436. Order. Vitalis, p. 492. M. West. p. 221. W. Malm. p. 93. Ingulf, p. 68. Brompton, p. 957. Knyghton, p. 2339. H. Hunting, p. 210. Many of the historians say, that Harold was regularly elected by the states: Some, that Edward left him his successor by will.</NOTE>. If there were any malcontents at this resolution, they were obliged to conceal their senti∣ments;
and the new prince, taking a general silence for
consent, and founding his title on the supposed suffrages
of the people, which appeared unanimous, was, on the
day immediately succeeding Edward's death, crowned
and anointed King, by Aldred, archbishop of York.
The whole nation seemed joyfully to swear allegiance to him.</P>
<P>THE first symptoms of danger, which the King dis∣covered,
came from abroad, and from his own brother,
Tosti, who had submitted to a voluntary banishment in
Flanders. Enraged at the successful ambition of Ha∣rold,
to which he himself had fallen a sacrifice, he fil∣led
the court of Baldwin with complaints of the injus∣tice,
which he had suffered: He engaged the interest of
that family against his brother: He endeavoured to form
intrigues with some malcontent nobility of England:
He sent his emissaries to Norway, in order to rouze to
arms the freebooters of that kingdom, and excite their
hopes of reaping advantage from the unsettled state of
affairs on the usurpation of the new King: And that he
might render the combination more formidable, he made
a journey to Normandy; in expectation, that the duke,
<PB N="195" REF="213"/>
who had married Matilda, another daughter of Baldwin,
would, in revenge of his own injuries, as well as those
of Tosti, second, by his councils and forces, the pro∣jected
invasion of England<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Order. Vitalis, p. 492.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Normandy, when he first received in∣telligence
of Harold's intrigues and accession, had been
moved to the highest pitch of indignation; but that he
might give the better colour to his pretensions, he sent
over an ambassy to England, upbraiding that prince with
his breach of faith, and summoning him to resign im∣mediately
possession of the kingdom. Harold replied to
the Norman ambassdors, that the oath with which he
was reproached, had been extorted by the well grounded
fear of violence, and could never, for that reason, be
regarded as obligatory: That he had had no commis∣sion,
either from the late King or the states of England,
who alone could dispose of the crown, to make any ten∣der
of the succession to the duke of Normandy; and if
he, a private person, had assumed so much authority,
and had even voluntarily sworn to support the duke's pre∣tensions,
the oath was unlawful, and it was his duty to
seize the first opportunity of breaking it: That he had
obtained the crown by the unanimous suffrages of the
people; and should show himself totally unworthy of
their favour, did he not strenuously maintain those na∣tional
liberties, with which they had entrusted him:
And that the duke, if he made any attempt by force of
arms, should experience the power of an united nation,
conducted by a prince, who, sensible of the obligations,
imposed on him by his royal dignity, was determined,
that the same moment should put a period to his life and
to his government<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 99. Higden, p. 285, M. West, p. 222. De Gest. Angl. incerto auctore, p. 331.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="214"/>
THIS answer was no other than William expected;
and he had previously fixed his resolution of making an
attempt upon England. Consulting only his courage,
his resentment, and his ambition, he overlooked all the
difficulties, which must attend an attack of a great
kingdom by such inferior force, and he saw only the
circumstances, which would facilitate his enterprize.
He considered, that England, ever since the accession of
Canute, had enjoyed a most profound tranquillity, dur∣ing
a period of near fifty years; and it would require
time for its soldiers, enervated by long peace, to learn
discipline, and its generals experience. He knew, that
it was entirely unprovided of fortified towns, by which
it could prolong the war; but must venture its whole
fortune in one decisive action against a veteran enemy,
who, being once master of the field, would be in a con∣dition
to over-run the kingdom. He saw that Harold,
tho' he had given proofs of vigour and bravery, had
newly mounted a throne, which he had acquired by fa∣ction,
from which he had excluded a very antient royal
family, and which was likely to totter under him by its
own instability, much more if shaken by any violent ex∣ternal
impulse. And he hoped, that the very circum∣stance
of his crossing the seas, quitting his own country,
and leaving himself no hopes of retreat; as it would
astonish the enemy by the boldness of the enterprize,
would inspirit his soldiers from despair, and rouze them
to sustain the reputation of the Norman arms.</P>
<P>THE Nornams, as they had long been distinguished
by valour among all the European nations, had at this
time attained to the highest pitch of military renown and
glory. Besides acquiring by arms such a noble territory
in France, besides defending it against continual at∣tempts
of the French monarch and all its neighbours,
besides exerting many actions of vigor under their pre∣sent
<PB N="197" REF="215"/>
sovereign; they had, about this very time, revived
their antient fame, by the most hazardous exploits, and
the most wonderful successes, in the other extremity of
Europe. A few Norman adventurers in Italy had ac∣quired
such an ascendant, not only over the Italians and
Greeks, but the Germans, and Saracens, that they ex∣pelled
these foreigners, procured to themselves ample
establishments, and laid the foundation of the opulent
kingdom of Naples and Sicily<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 30.</NOTE>. These enterprizes of
men, who were all of them vassals in Normandy, many
of them banished for faction and rebellion, excited the
ambition of the haughty William; who disdained, after
such examples of fortune and valour, to be deterred from
making an attack on a neighbouring country, where he
could be supported by the whole force of his principa∣lity.</P>
<P>THE situation also of Europe inspired William with
hopes, that, besides his brave Normans, he might em∣ploy
against England the flower of the military force,
which was dispersed in all the other states. France,
Germany, and the low countries, by the progress of the
feudal institutions, were divided and subdivided into many
small principalities and baronies; and the possessors, en∣joying
the civil jurisdiction within themselves, as well as
the right of arms, acted, in many respects, as indepen∣dent
sovereigns, and maintained their properties and pri∣vileges,
less by the authority of laws, than by their own
force and valour. A military spirit had universally dif∣fused
itself throughout Europe; and the several leaders,
whose minds were elevated by their princely situation,
greedily embraced the most adventurous enterprizes, and
being accustomed to nothing from their infancy but re∣citals
of the success attending wars and battles, they
were prompted by a natural ambition to imitate those
<PB N="198" REF="216"/>
adventures which they heard so much celebrated, and which
were so much exaggerated by the credulity of the age.
United, however loosely, by their duty to one superior
lord, and by their connexions with the great body of
the community, to which they belonged, they desired to
spread their fame each beyond his own district; and in
all assemblies, whether instituted for civil deliberations,
for military expeditions, or merely for show and enter∣tainment,
to outshine each other by the reputation of
strength and prowess. Hence their genius for chivalry;
hence their impatience for peace and tranquillity; and
hence their readiness to embark in any hazardous
enterprize, however little interested in its failure or suc∣cess.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, by his power, his courage, and his abi∣lities,
had long maintained a pre-eminence among those
haughty chieftains; and every one who desired to distin∣guish
himself by his address in military exercises, or his
valour in action, had been ambitious of acquiring a re∣putation
in the court and in the armies of Normandy,
Entertained with that hospitality and courtesy, which
distinguished the age, they had formed attachments with
the prince, and greedily attended to the prospects of glory
and advantage, which he promised them in return for
their concurrence in an expedition against England. The
more grandeur appeared in the attempt, the more it suited
their romantic spirit: The fame of the intended invasion
was already diffused every where: Multitudes crowded
to tender the duke their service, with that of their
vassals and retainers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictavensis, p. 198.</NOTE>: And William found less difficulty
in compleating his levies, than in choosing the most ve∣teran
and experienced forces, and in rejecting the of∣fers
of those, who were impatient to acquire fame un∣der
so renowned a leader.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="217"/>
BESIDES these advantages, which William owed to
his personal valour and good conduct; he was beholden
to fortune for procuring him some assistances, and for
removing many obstacles, which it was natural for him to
expect in an undertaking, where all his neighbours were
so deeply interested. Conan, duke of Britanny, was his
mortal enemy; and in order to throw a damp upon his
enterprize, he chose this conjuncture for reviving his
claim to Normandy itself, and he required, that, in
case of William's success against England, the possession
of that dutchy might devolve to him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 33.</NOTE>. But Conan
died suddenly after making this demand; and Howel,
his successor, instead of adopting the malignity, or rather
the prudence of his predecessor, zealously seconded the
duke's views, and sent his eldest son, Alian Fergant, to
serve under him with a force of five thousand Britons.
The counts of Anjou, and of Flanders, encouraged
their subjects to engage in the expedition; and even the
court of France, tho' it might justly fear the aggrandize∣ment
of so dangerous a vassal, pursued not its interests
on this occasion with sufficient vigour and resolution.
Philip I. the reigning French monarch, was a minor;
and William, having communicated his project to the
council, having desired assistance, and offered to do
homage, in case of his success, for the crown of Eng∣land,
was indeed ordered to lay aside all thoughts of the
enterprize; but the earl of Flanders, his father-in-law,
being at the head of the regency, favoured under-hand
his levies, and encouraged the enterprizing nobility to
inlist under the standard of the duke of Normandy.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, Henry IV. besides giving openly all
his vassals permission to embark in this expedition, which
so much engaged the attention of Europe, promised his
protection to the dutchy of Normandy during the absence
<PB N="200" REF="218"/>
of the prince, and thereby enabled him to draw <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his
whole force to the attack of England<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 198.</NOTE>. But the most
important ally, whom William gained by his negoti∣ations,
was the pope, who had a mighty influence over
the antient barons, no less devout in their religious prin∣ciples
than valorous in their military enterprizes. The
Roman pontiff, after an insensible progress during several
ages of darkness and ignorance, began now to lift his
head openly above all the princes of Europe; to assume
the office of a mediator, or even an arbiter, in the quar∣rels
of the greatest monarchs; to interpose himself in all
secular affairs; and to obtrude his dictates as sovereign
laws on his obsequious disciples. It was a sufficient mo∣tive
to Alexander II. the reigning pope, for embracing
William's quarrel, that he alone had made an appeal to
his tribunal, and rendered him umpire of the dispute be∣tween
him and Harold; but there were other advanta∣ges,
which, that pontiff foresaw, must result from the
conquest of England by the Norman arms. That king∣dom,
tho' at first converted by Romish missionaries, tho'
it had afterwards advanced some farther steps towards
subjection under Rome, maintained still a great inde∣pendance
in its ecclesiastical administration; and form∣ing
a world within itself, entirely separated from the rest
of Europe, it had hitherto proved inaccessible to those
exorbitant claims, which supported the grandeur of the
papacy.
Alexander, therefore, hoped, that the French
and Norman barons, if successful in their enterprize,
might import into that country a more devoted reve∣rence
to the holy see, and bring the English churches to
a nearer conformity with those of the rest of Europe.
He declared immediately in favour of William's claim<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100. Ingulf, p. 69. Higden, p. 285. Erompton, p. 958.</NOTE>;
pronounced Harold a perjured usurper; denounced ex∣communication
<PB N="201" REF="219"/>
against him and his adherents; and the
more to encourage the duke of Normandy in his enter∣prize,
he sent him a consecrated banner, and a ring
with one of St. Peter's hairs in it<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Baker, p. 22. edit. 1684.</NOTE> Thus were all the ambition and violence of that invasion covered over safely
with the broad mantle of religion.</P>
<P>BUT the greatest difficulty, which William had to en∣counter
in his preparations, arose from his own subjects
in Normandy. The states of the dutchy were assem∣bled
at Lislebonne; and supplies being demanded for the
intended enterprize, which promised so much glory and
advantage to their country, there appeared a reluctance
in many members, both to grant sums so much beyond
the common measure of taxes in that age, and to set a
precedent of performing their military service out of
their own country. The duke finding it dangerous to
solicit them in a body, conferred separately with the
richest persons in the province; and beginning with
those whose affections he most relied on, he gradually
engaged all of them to advance the sums demanded.
The count of Longueville seconded him in this negoti∣ation,
the count of Mortaigne, Odo bishop of Baieux,
and especially William Fitz-Osborne, count of Breteüil,
and constable of the dutchy. Every person, when he
himself was once engaged, endeavoured to bring over
others; and at last the states themselves, after stipulating
that this concession should be no precedent for the fu∣ture,
voted, that they would assist their prince to the
utmost in his intended enterprize<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden Introd. ad Britann. p. 212. 2d edit. Gibs. Verstegan, p. 173.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WILLIAM had now assembled a fleet of 3000 vessels,
great and small<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 34.</NOTE>, and had selected an army of 60,000
men from among those numerous supplies, which from
<PB N="202" REF="220"/>
every quarter solicited to be received into his service.
The camp bore a splendid, yet a martial appearance,
from the discipline of the men, the vigor of the horses,
the lustre of the arms and accountrements of both; but
above all from the high names of nobility who engaged
under the banners of the duke of Normandy. The most
celebrated were Eustace, count of Boulogne, Aimeri de
Thouars, Hugh d'Estaples, William d'Evreux, Geof∣frey
de Rotrou, Roger de Beaumont, William de Wa∣renne,
Roger de Montgomeri, Hugh de Grantmesnil,

chieftains William held up the spoils of England as the
prize of their valor; and pointing to the opposite shore,
called to them, that <HI>there</HI> was the field, on which they
must erect trophies to their name, and fix their estab∣lishments.</P>
<P>WHILE he was making these mighty preparations, the
duke, that he might increase the number of Harold's
enemies, excited the inveterate rancour of Tosti, and
encouraged him, in concert with Harold Halfager, King
of Norway, to infest the coast of England. Tosti,
having collected about sixty vessels in the ports of Flan∣ders,
put to sea; and after committing some depreda∣tions
on the south and east coasts, he sailed to Nor∣thumberland,
and he was their joined by Halfager, who
came over with a great armament of three hundred sais<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 172. W. Malm. p. 94. H. Hunt, p. 367. Higden, p. 284.</NOTE>.
The combined fleets entered the Humber, and disem∣barked
the troops, who began to extend their depreda∣tions
on all sides; when Morcar earl of Northumber∣land,
and Edwin earl of Mercia, the King's brothers-in-law,
having hastily collected some troops, ventured to

give them battle. The action ended with the total de∣feat
and flight of these two noblemen<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 172. W. Malm. p. 94. Hoveden, p. 448. In∣gulf, p 69. Higden, p. 284. Alur. Beverl. p. 123.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAROLD, informed of this misfortune, hastened with
an army to the protection of his people; and expressed
the utmost ardour to show himself worthy of the crown,
which had been conferred upon him. This prince, tho'
he was not sensible of the full extent of his danger, from
the great combination against him, had employed every
art of popularity to acquire the affections of the public;
and he gave so many proofs of an equitable and prudent
administration, that the English found no reason to re∣pent
of the choice which they had made of a sovereign<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W Malm. p. 93. Hoveden, p. 447. Hist Eliensis, cap. 44. Sim. Dun. p. 193. Flor. Wigorn. p. 623.</NOTE>.
They flocked from all quarters to join his standard; and
as soon as he reached the enemy at Standford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Sep∣tember.</NOTE> he found
himself in a condition of giving them battle. The ac∣tion
was very bloody; but the victory was decisive on
the side of Harold, and ended with the total rout of the
Danes, together with the death of Tosti and Halfager<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 172. W. Malm. p. 94. H. Hunt. p. 368. Ingulf, p. 69. Hist. Rames. p. 461.</NOTE>.
Even the Danish fleet fell into the hands of Harold;
who had the generosity to give prince Olave, the son of
Halfager, his liberty, and allow him to depart with
twenty vessels<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 448. Ingulf, p. 69. Higden, p. 285. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 46.</NOTE>. But he had scarce time to rejoice for
this victory, when he received intelligence, that the
duke of Normandy was landed with a great army in the
south of England.</P>
<P>THE Norman fleet and army had been assembled,
early in the summer, at the mouth of the small river
Dive, and all the troops had been instantly embarked;
but the winds proved long contrary, and detained them
<PB N="204" REF="222"/>
in that harbour<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Order. Vitalis, p. 500.</NOTE>. The authority, however, of the duke,
the good discipline maintained among the seamen and
soldiers, and the great care of supplying them with pro∣visions,
had prevented any disorder; when at last the
wind became favourable, and enabled them to sail along
the coast, till they reached St. Valori. There were,
however, several vessels lost in this short passage; and
as the winds again proved contrary, the army began to
imagine, that heaven had declared against them, and
that, notwithstanding the Pope's benediction, they were
destined to certain ruin<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100.</NOTE>. These bold warriors, who
despised real dangers, were very subject to the dread
of imaginary ones; and many of them began to muti∣ny,
and some of them even to desert their colours; when
the duke, in order to support their drooping hopes, or∣dered
a procession to be made with the reliques of St.
Valori<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 285. Order. Vitalis, p. 500. Matth. Paris, edit. parisis anno 1644. p. 2.</NOTE>, and prayers to be said for more favourable
weather. The winds instantly changed; and as this in∣cident
happened on the eve of the feast of St. Michael,
the tutelar fain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormandy, the soldiers, fancying
they saw the han<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaven in all these concurring cir∣cumstances,
set <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the greatest alacrity<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100.</NOTE>: They
met with no opposition on their voyage: A great fleet,
which Harold had assembled, and which had cruized all
summer off the Isle of Wight, had been dismissed, on
his receiving false intelligence, that William, discourag∣ed
by the contrary winds and other accidents, had laid
aside his preparations<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 448. Sim. Dun. p. 194. Diceto, p. 479.</NOTE>. The Norman armament, pro∣ceeding
in great order, arrived, without any material
loss, at Pevensey in Sussex; and the army quietly dis∣embarked.
The duke himself, as he leaped on shore,
<PB N="205" REF="223"/>
happened to stumble and fall; but had the presence of
mind to turn the omen to his advantage, by calling
aloud, that he had taken possession of the country<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Baker, p. 22.</NOTE>.
And a soldier, running to a neighbouring cottage, pluck∣ed
some thatch, which, as if giving him seizine of the
kingdom, he presented to his general. The joy and
alacrity of William and his whole army was so great,
that they were no wise discouraged, even when they
heard of Harold's great victory over the Danes; and
they seemed rather to wait with impatience for the ar∣rival
of the enemy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 199.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE victory of Harold, tho' great and honourable,
had proved in the main prejudicial to his interests, and
may be regarded as the immediate cause of his ruin. He
lost many of his bravest officers and soldiers in the ac∣tion;
and he disgusted the rest, by refusing to distribute
the Danish spoils among them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 94. Higden, p. 285.</NOTE>: A conduct which was
little agreeable to his usual generosity of temper; but
which his desire of sparing the people, in the war which
impended over him from the duke of Normandy, had
probably occasioned. He hastened by quick marches to
reach this new invader; but tho' he was reinforced at
London and other places with fresh troops, he found
himself also weakened by the desertion of his old soldi∣ers,
who from fatigue and discontent secretly withdrew
from their colours. His brother Gurth, a man of bra∣very
and conduct, began to entertain apprehensions of
the event; and remonstrated with the King, that it
would be better policy to prolong the war, or, at least,
to spare his own person in the action. He urged to him,
that the desperate situation of the duke of Normandy
made it requisite for that prince to bring matters to a
speedy decision, and put his whole fortune on the issue
<PB N="206" REF="224"/>
of a battle; but that the King of England, in his own
country, beloved by his subjects, provided of every sup∣ply,
had more infallible and less dangerous methods of
ensuring to himself, the victory: That the Norman
troops, elevated on the one hand with the highest hopes,
and seeing, on the other, no resource in case of a dis∣comfiture,
would fight to the last extremity; and being
the flower of all the warriors of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>continent, must be
regarded as formidable to the English: That if their first
fire and spirit, which is always most dangerous, were
allowed to languish for want of action; if they were
harassed with small skirmishes, straitened in provisions,
and fatigued with the bad weather and deep roads dur∣ing
the winter-season, which was approaching, they must
fall an easy and a bloodless prey to their enemy: That
if a general action was delayed, the English, sensible of
the imminent danger, to which their properties, as well
as liberties, were exposed from these rapacious invaders,
would hasten from all quarters to his assistance, and
would render his army invincible: That at least, if he
thought it necessary to hazard a battle, he ought not to
expose his own person; but reserve, in case of disastrous
accidents, some resource to the liberty and independence
of the kingdom: And that having once been so unfor∣tunate,
as to be constrained to swear, and that upon the
holy reliques, to support the pretensions of the duke of
Normandy, it were better that another person should
command the army, who, not being bound by these sa∣cred
ties, might give the soldiers more certain hopes of
a prosperous issue to the quarrel<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100. Higden, p. 286. Order. Vitalis, p. 500. Matth. West. p. 222.</NOTE></P>
<P>HAROLD was deaf to all these remonstrances; and
being elated with his past prosperity, as well as stimu∣lated
by his native courage, he resolved to give battle in
person; and for that purpose, he drew near to the Nor∣mans,
<PB N="207" REF="225"/>
who had removed their camp and fleet to Hast∣ings,
where they fixed their quarters. He was so con∣fident
of success, that he sent a message to the duke,
promising him a sum of money, if he would depart the
kingdom without effusion of blood: But his offer was
rejected with disdain; and William, not to be behind
with his enemy in vaunting, sent him a message by some
monks, requiring him either to resign the kingdom, or
to hold it of him in fealty, or to submit their cause to
the arbitration of the Pope, or to fight him in single
combat<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100. Higden, p. 286.</NOTE>. Harold replied, that the God of battles would
soon be the arbiter of all their differences<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 286.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English and Normans now prepared themselves
for this important decision; but the aspect of things, on
the night before the battle, was very different in the two
camps. The English spent the time in riot, and jollity,
and disorder; the Normans in silence and in prayer, and
in the functions of their religion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 101. De Gest. Angl. p. 332.</NOTE>. On the morning,
the duke called together the most considerable of his
chieftains,
and made them a speech suitable to the occa∣sion.
He represented to them, that the event which
they and he had long wished for, was approaching; and
the whole fortune of the war now depended on their
sword, and would be decided in a single action: That
never army had greater motives for exerting a vigorous
courage, whether they considered the prize which would
attend their victory, or the inevitable destruction which
must ensue upon their discomfitune: That if their mar∣tial
and veteran bands could once break those raw sol∣diers,
who had rashly dared to approach them, they con∣quered
a kingdom at one blow, and were justly intitled
to all its possessions as the reward of their prosperous va∣lour:
That, on the contrary, if they remitted in the
<PB N="208" REF="226"/>
least their wonted prowess, an enraged enemy hung upon
their rear, the sea met them in their retreat, and an
ignominious death was the certain punishment of their
imprudent cowardice: That by collecting so numerous
and brave a host, he had ensured every human means of
conquest;
and the commander of the enemy, by his cri∣minal
conduct, had given him just cause to hope for the
favour of heaven, in whose hands alone lay the event of
wars and battles: And that a perjured usurper, anathe∣matized
by the sovereign pontiff, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd conseious of his
own breach of faith, would be struck with terror on
their appearance, and would prognosticate to himself
that fate which his multiplied crimes had so justly me∣rited<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 368. Brompton, p. 959. Gul. Pict. p. 201.</NOTE>. The duke next divided his army into three lines▪
The first, headed by Montgomery, consisted of archers
and light-armed infantry: The second, commanded by
Martel, was composed of his bravest battalions, heavy
armed, and ranged in close order: His cavalry, at whose
head he placed-himself, formed the third line; and were
so disposed, that they stretched beyond the infantry, and
flanked each wing of the army<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 201. Order. Vital. p. 501.</NOTE>. He ordered the signal
of battle to sound; and the whole army, moving at
once, and singing the hymn or song of Roland, the fa∣mous
peer of Charlemagne<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 101. Higden, p. 286. Mattli. West. p. 223. Du Cange's Glos∣sary in verbo <HI>Cantilona Rolandi.</HI></NOTE>, advanced, in order and
with alacrity, towards the enemy.</P>
<P>HAROLD had seized the advantage of a rising ground,
and having besides drawn some trenches to secure his
flanks, he resolved to stand upon the defensive, and to
avoid all action with the cavalry, in which he was infe∣rior<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 201. Order. Vitalis, p. 501.</NOTE>. The Kentish men were placed in the van; a post
<PB N="209" REF="227"/>
which they had always claimed as their due: The Lon∣doners
guarded the standard: And the King himself, ac∣companied
by his two valiant brothers, Gurth and Leof∣win,
dismounting from horseback, placed himself at the
head of his infantry, and expressed his resolution to con∣quer
or to perish in the action<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 101.</NOTE> The first attack of
the Normans was desperate, but was received with equal
valour by the English; and after a furious combat,
which remained long undecided, the former, overcome
by the difficulty of the ground, and hard pressed by the
enemy, began first to relax their vigour, then to give
ground; and confusion was spreading among the ranks;
when William, who found himself on the brink of de∣struction,
hastened, with a select band, to the relief of
his dismayed forces<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 202. Order. Vitalis, p. 501.</NOTE>. His presence restored the action;
the English were obliged to retreat with loss; and the
duke, ordering his second line to advance, renewed the
attack with fresh forces and with redoubled courage.
Finding, that the enemy, aided by the advantage of
ground, and animated by the example of their prince,
still made a vigorous resistance, he tried a stratagem,
which was very delicate in its management, but which
seemed adviseable in his desperate situation, when, if
he gained not a decisive victory, he was totally undone:
He ordered his troops to make a hasty retreat, and to
allure the enemy from their ground by the appearance of
flight. The artifice succeeded against these unexperi∣enced
troops, who, heated by the action, and sanguine
in their hopes, precipitantly followed the Normans into
the plain<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 101. H. Hunt. p. 368. Higden, p. 286. Brompton, p. 960. Gul. Pict. p. 202. M. Paris, p. 3.</NOTE>. William gave orders, that at once the in∣fantry
should face about upon their pursuers, and the
<PB N="210" REF="228"/>
cavalry make an assault upon their wings, and both of
them pursue the advantage, which the surprize and ter∣ror
of the enemy must give them in that critical and de∣cisive
moment. The English were repulsed with great
slaughter, and drove back to the hill; where being ral∣lied
again by the bravery of Harold, they were able, not∣withstanding
their loss, to maintain the post and conti∣nue
the combat. The duke tried the same stratagem a
second time with the same success; but even after this
double advantage, he still found a great body of the Eng∣lish,
who maintaining themselves in firm array, seemed
determined to dispute the victory to the last extremity.
He ordered his heavy armed infantry to make the assault
upon them; while his archers, placed behind, should
gall the enemy, who were exposed by the situation of the
ground, and who were intent in defending themselves
against the swords and spears of the assailants<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 480.</NOTE>. By this
disposition he at last prevailed: Harold was slain by an
arrow, while he was combating with great bravery at
the head of his men<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 101. H. Hunt. p. 369. Ingulf, p. 69. Sim. Dun. p. 195.</NOTE>: His two brothers shared the same
fate: And the English, discouraged by the fall of these
princes, gave ground on all sides, and were pursued with
great slaughter by the victorious Normans. A few
troops however of the vanquished dared still to turn up∣on
their pursuers; and taking them in deep and miry
ground, obtained some revenge for the slaughter and dis∣honour
of the day<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 203. Order. Vitalis, p. 501.</NOTE>. But the appearance of the duke
obliged them to seek their safety by flight, and darkness
saved them from any farther pursuit by the enemy.</P>
<P>THUS was gained by William, duke of Normandy,
the great and decisive victory of Hastings, after a battle
which was fought from morning till sunset<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Alur, Beverl. p. 124. Ypod. Neust. p. 436.</NOTE>, and which
<PB N="215" REF="229"/>
years and abilities, would have been thought entitled to
the authority. Thus, these monarchies are not, strictly
speaking, either elective or hereditary; and tho' the de∣stination
of a prince may often be followed in appoint∣ing
his successor, they can as little be regarded as wholly
testamentary. The suffrages of the states may sometimes
establish a sovereign; but they more frequently recog∣nize
him whom they find established: A few great men
take the lead; the people, overawed and influenced, ac∣quiesce
in the government; and the reigning prince,
provided he be of the royal family, passes undisputably
for the legal sovereign.</P>
<P>IT is confessed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wit∣tenagemot.</NOTE> that our knowledge of the Anglo-Saxon
history and antiquities is too imperfect to afford
us means of determining with certainty all the preroga∣tives
of the crown and privileges of the people, or of
giving an exact delineation of that government. It is
probable also, that the constitution might be somewhat
different in the different nations of the Heptarchy, and
that it changed considerably during the course of six cen∣turies,
which elapsed from the first, invasion of the Sax∣ons
till the Norman conquest<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">We know of one change, not inconsiderable in the Saxon consti∣tution. The Saxon annals, p. 49 inform us, that it is the prerogative of the King to name the dukes, earls, aldermen and sheriffs of the counties. Asser, a contemporary writer, informs us, that Alfred de∣posed all the ignorant aldermen, and appointed men of more capacity in their place: Yet the laws of Edward the Confessor, § 355 say expresly, that the heretoghs or dukes, and the sheriffs, were chosen by the freeholders in the folkmote, a county court, which was assembled once a∣year, and where all the freeholders swore allegiance to the King.</NOTE>. But most of these dif∣ferences
and changes, with their causes and effects, are
unknown to us: It only appears, that, at all times, and
in all the kingdoms, there was a national council, cal∣led
a Wittenagemot or assembly of the wise men, (for
that is the import of the term) whose consent was requi∣site

for the enacting laws, and for ratifying the chief
acts of public administration. The preambles to all the
laws of Ethelbert, Ina, Alfred, Edward the Elder, Athel∣stan,
Edmond, Edgar, Ethelred, and Edward the Con∣fessor;
even those to the laws of. Canute, tho' a kind of
conqueror, put this matter beyond controversy, and car∣ry
proofs every where of a limited and legal government.
But who were the constituent members of this Wittena∣gemot
has not been determined with certainty by anti∣quarians.
It is agreed, that the bishops and abbots<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Sometimes abbesses were admitted; at least, they often sign the King's charters of grants. Spellm, Gloss. in verbo <HI>parliamentum</HI></NOTE>
were an essential part; and it is also evident, from the
tenor of these antient laws, that the Wittenagemot en∣acted
statutes which regulated the ecclesiastical as well as
civil government, and that those dangerous principles,
by which the church is totally severed from the state,
were hitherto unknown to the Anglo-Saxons<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Wilkins passim.</NOTE>. It also
appears, that the aldermen or governors of counties, who,
after the Danish times, were often called earls<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It appears from the antient translations of the Saxon annals and laws, and from King Alfred's translation of Bede, as well as from all the antient historians, that <HI>comes</HI> in Latin, <HI>alderman</HI> in Saxron, and <HI>carl</HI> in Dano-Saxon were quite synonimous. There is only a clause of a law of King Athelstan's, (see Spelm. Conc. p. 406) which has stumbled some antiquarians, and has made them imagine that an earl was supe∣rior to an alderman. The weregild or the price of an earl's blood is there fixed at 15,000 thrimsas, equal to that of an archbishop; whereas that of a bishop and alderman is only 8000 thrimsas. To solve this difficulty we must have recourse to Selden's conjecture, (see his Titles of Honour, chap. 5. p. 603, 604.) that the term of earl was in the age of Athelstan just beginning to be of use in England, and stood at that time for the atheling or prince of the blood, heir to the crown. This he confirms by a law of Canute, § 55. where an atheling and an archbishop are put upon the same footing. In another law of the same Athelstan the weregild of the prince or atheling is said to be 15,000 thrimsas. See Wilkins, p. 71. He is therefore the same who is called earl in the for∣mer law.</NOTE>, were
<PB N="213" REF="233"/>
of mankind, it owes these advantages chiefly to the seeds
implanted by those generous barbarians.</P>
<P>THE Saxons, who subdued Britain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First Saxon govern∣ment.</NOTE> as they enjoyed
great liberty in their own country, obstinately retained
that invaluable possession in their new settlement; and
they imported into this island the same principles of in∣dependance,
which they had inherited from their ances∣tors.
The chieftains (for such they were more properly
than kings or princes) who commanded them in those
military expeditions, still possessed a very limited autho∣rity;
and as the Saxons exterminated, rather than sub∣dued,
the antient inhabitants, they were indeed trans∣planted
into a new territory, but preserved unaltered all
their civil and military institutions. The language was
pure Saxon; even the names of places, which often re∣main
while the tongue entirely changes, were almost all
affixed by the new conquerors; the manners and cus∣toms
were wholly German; and the same picture of a
fierce and bold liberty, which is drawn by the masterly
pencil of Tacitus, will apply to these founders of the
English government. The King, so far from being en∣titled
to an arbitrary power, was only considered as the
first among the citizens; his authority depended more on
his personal qualities than on his station; he was even
so far on a level with the other inhabitants, that a stated
price was affixed to his head, and a legal fine was levied
from his murderer, which, tho' proportioned to his sta∣tion,
and superior to that paid for the life of a subject,
was a sensible mark of his subordination to the commu∣nity.</P>
<P>IT is easy to imagine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Succession of the Kings.</NOTE> that an independant people, so
little restrained by laws, and cultivated by science, would
not be very strict in maintaining a regular succession of
their princes. Tho' they paid a great respect to the
royal family, and ascribed to them an undisputed superi∣ority,
<PB N="214" REF="234"/>
they either had no rule, or none that was steadily
observed, in filling the vacant throne; and present con∣venience
in that emergency was more attended to than
general principles. We are not however to suppose,
that the crown was considered as altogether elective;
and that a regular plan was traced by the constitution
for supplying, by the suffrages of the people, every va∣cancy
made by the decease of the first magistrate. If
any King on his death left a son of an age and capacity
fit for government, the young prince naturally stepped
into the throne: If he was a minor, his uncle, or the
next prince of the blood, was promoted to the govern∣ment,
and left the sceptre to his posterity: Any sove∣reign,
by taking previous measures with the leading men,
had it greatly in his power to appoint his successor: All
these changes, and indeed the ordinary administration of
government, required the express concurrence, or at
least the tacit consent of the people; but present posses∣sion,
however obtained, went far towards procuring
their obedience, and the idea of any right which was
once excluded, was but feeble and imperfect. This is
so much the case in all barbarous monarchies, and oc∣curs
so often in the history of the Anglo-Saxons, that
we cannot consisently entertain any other notion of
their government. The idea of an hereditary succession
in authority is so natural to men, and is so much forti∣fied
by the usual rule in transmitting private possessions,
that it must retain a great influence on every society,
who do rot exclude it by the refinements of a republi∣can
constitution. But as there is a sensible difference
between government and private possessions, and every
one is not equally qualified for exercising the one as for
enjoying the ohter, a people, who are not sensible of the
general advantages attending a fixed rule, are apt to
make great leaps in the succession, and frequently to
pass over the person, who, had he possessed the requisite
<PB N="211" REF="235"/>
seemed worthy, by the heroic feats of valour displayed
by both armies, and by both commanders, to decide the
fate of a mighty kingdom. William had three horses
killed under him; and there fell near fifteen thousand
men on the side of the Normans<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 36.</NOTE>: The loss was still
more considerable on that of the vanquished; besides the
death of the King and his two brothers. The dead body

restored without ransom to his mother<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 102. Higden, p. 286. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 46.</NOTE>. The Norman

heaven, in the most solemn manner, for their victory:

push to the utmost his advantage against the divided,

<P>THE government of the Germans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appendix I.</NOTE> and that of all
the northern nations who established themselves
on the ruins of Rome, was always extremely free; and
those fierce people, accustomed to independance and
enured to arms, were more guided by persuasion than
authority, in the submission which they paid their prin∣ces.
The military despotism, which had taken place in
the Roman empire, and which, previously to the irrup∣tion
of these conquerors, had sunk the genius of men,
and destroyed every noble principle of science and vir∣tue,
was unable to resist the vigorous efforts of a free
people; and Europe, as from a new epoch, rekindled
her antient spirit, and shook off the base servitude to ar∣bitrary
will and authority, under which it had so long,
laboured. The free constitutions then established, how∣ever
impaired by the encroachments of succeeding prin∣ces,
still preserve an air of independance and legal ad∣ministration,
which distinguish the European nations;
and if that part of the globe maintain sentiments of li∣berty,
honour, equity, and valour, superior to the rest</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="237"/>
AMONG that military and turbulent people, so averse
to commerce and the arts, so little enured to industry,
justice was commonly very ill executed, and great oppres∣sion
and violence seem to have prevailed. These disor∣ders
would be increased by the exorbitant power of the
aristocracy; and would, in their turn, contribute to in∣crease
it. Men, not daring to rely on the guardianship
of the laws, were obliged to devote themselves to the ser∣vice
of some chieftain, whose orders they followed even
to the disturbance of the government or the injury of
their fellow-citizens, and who afforded them in return
protection from any insult or injustice by strangers.
Hence we find, by the extracts which Dr. Brady has gi∣ven
us from Domesday, that almost all the inhabitants even
of boroughs, had placed themselves in the clientship of some
particular nobleman, whose patronage they purchased by
annual payments, and whom they were obliged to consider
as their sovereign, more than the King himself, or even
the legislature<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Brady's Treatise of Boroughs, 3,4, 5, &amp;c. The case was the same with the freemen in the country. See pref. to his hist. p. 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.</NOTE>. A client, tho' a freeman, was supposed
so much to belong to his patron, that his murderer was
obliged by law to pay a fine to the latter, as a compen∣sation
for his loss; in like manner as he paid a fine to the
master for the murder of his slave<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">LL. Edw. Conf. § 8. apud Ingulf.</NOTE>. Men, who were of
a more considerable rank, but not powerful enough, each
to support himself by his own independent authority, en∣tered
into formal confederacies together, and composed a
kind of separate republic, which rendered itself formi∣dable
to all aggressors. Dr. Hickes has preserved a very
curious Saxon bond of this kind, which he calls a <HI>Sodali∣tium,</HI>
and which contains many particulars, characteristi∣cal
of the manners and customs of the times<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dissert. Epist. p. 21.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="222" REF="238"/>
associates are there said to be all of them gentlemen of
Cambridgeshire; and they swear before the holy reliques
to observe their confederacy, and to be faithful to each
other: They promise to bury any of the associates who
dies, in whatever place he had appointed; to contribute
to his funeral charges, and to attend at his interment;
and whoever is wanting to this last duty, binds himself to
pay a measure of honey. When any of the associates is
in danger, and calls for the assistance of his fellows, they
promise, besides flying to his succour, to give informa∣tion
to the sheriff; and if he be negligent in protecting
the person exposed to hazard, they engage to levy a fine
of one pound upon him: If the president of the society
himself be wanting in this particular, he binds himself
to pay one pound; unless he has the reasonable excuse of
sickness, or of duty to his superior. When any of the
associates is murdered, they are to exact eight pounds
from the murderer; and if he refuses to pay it, they are
to prosecute him for the sum at their joint expence. If
any of the associates, who happens to be poor, kills a man,
the society are to contribute by a certain proportion to
pay his fine: A mark a-piece, if the fine be 700 shillings;
less if the person killed be a clown or ceorle; the half of
that sum, again, if he be a Welshman. But where any
of the associates kills a man, wilfully and without provo∣cation,
he must himself pay the fine. If any of the as∣sociates
kills a fellow, in a like criminal manner, besides
paying the usual fine to the relations of the deceased, he
must pay eight pounds to the society, or renounce the be∣nefit
of it: In which case they bind themselves, under
the penalty of one pound, never to eat or drink with him,
except in the presence of the King, bishop, or alderman.
There are other regulations to protect themselves and their
servants from all injuries, to revenge such as are commit∣ted,
and to prevent their giving abusive language to each
<PB N="219" REF="239"/>
the northern nations. We may, therefore, conclude,
that the more considerable proprietors of land were, with∣out
any election, constituent members of the national as∣sembly;
and there is reason to think, that forty hydes,
or about four or five thousand acres, was the estate re∣quisite
for intitling the possessor to this honourable privi∣lege.
There is a passage of an antient author<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hist. Eliensis, cap. 36. 40. This passage is remarked by Dugdale, (pref. to his Baron. vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) and he draws the same inference from it.</NOTE> from
which it appears, that a person of very noble birth, even
one allied to the crown, was not esteemed a <HI>princeps</HI> (the
term usually employed by antient historians when the
Wittenagemot is mentioned) till he had acquired a for∣tune
of that extent. Nor need we imagine, that the
public council would become disorderly or confused by
admitting so great a multitude. The landed property of
England was probably in few hands during the Saxon
times; at least, during the latter part of that period:
And as men had small ambition of attending these public
councils, there was no danger of the assembly's becoming
too numerous for the dispatch of the little business, which
was brought before them.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aristo∣cracy.</NOTE> whatever we may determine con∣cerning
the constituent members of the Wittenagemot,
in whom the legislature resided, the Anglo-Saxon govern∣ment,
in the period preceding the Norman conquest,
was become extremely aristocratical: The royal authori∣ty
was very limited; the people, even if admitted to that
assembly, were of little or no weight or consideration. We
have hints given us in the historians of the great power and
riches of particular noblemen: And it could not but hap∣pen,
after the abolition of the Heptarchy, when the King
lived at a distance from the provinces, that these great
proprietors, who resided on their estates, would much
augment their authority over their vassals and retainers,
<PB N="220" REF="240"/>
and over all the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Hence
the immeasurable power assumed by Harold, Godwin
Leofric, Siward, Morcar, Edwin, Edric and Alfric, who
controlled the authority of the Kings, and rendered them∣selves
quite necessary in the government. The two lat∣ter,
tho' detested by the people, on account of their
joining a foreign enemy, still preserved their power and
influence; and we may therefore conclude, that their
authority was founded, not on popularity, but on family
rights and possessions. There is one Athelstan, men∣tioned
in the reign of the king of that name, who is cal∣led
alderman of all England, and is said to be half-king;
tho' the monarch himself was a prince of great valour
and ability<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hist. Rames. § 3. p. 387.</NOTE>. And we find, that in the latter Saxon
times, and in these alone, the great offices went from
father to son, and became, in a manner, hereditary in
the families<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Roger Hoveden, giving the reason why William the Conqueror made Cospatric earl of Northumberland, says, <HI>Nam ex materno sanguine attinebat ad eum honor illius comitatus. Erat enim ex matro Algitha, filia Uthre∣di comitis.</HI> See also Sim. Dun. P. 205. We see in those instances, the same tendency towards rendering offices hereditary, which took place, during a more early period, on the continent; and which had already operated its full effect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE circumstances attending the invasions of the
Danes, would also serve much to increase the power of
the principal nobility. These free-booters made unex∣pected
inroads on all quarters; and there was a necessity,
that each county should resist them by its own force, and
under the conduct of its own magistrates, and nobility.
For the same reason, that a general war, managed by the
united efforts of the whole state, commonly increases
the power of the crown; these private wars and inroads
turned to the advantage of the aldermen and nobles.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="241"/>
admitted into this council, and gave their consent to the
public statutes. But besides the prelates and aldermen,
there is also mention of the wites or wise-men, as a dis∣tinct
branch of the Wittenagemot; but who <HI>these</HI> were
is not so clearly ascertained by the laws or the history of
that period. The matter would probably be of difficult
discussion, even were it examined impartially; but as
our parties have chosen to divide on this head, the ques∣tion
has been disputed with the greater acrimony, and
the arguments on both sides have become, on that ac∣count,
the more captious and deceitful. Our monar∣chical
faction maintain, that these <HI>wites</HI> or <HI>sapientes</HI> were
the judges or men learned in the law: The popular party
assert them to be representatives of the boroughs, or what
we now call the commons.</P>
<P>THE expressions, employed by all the antient histori∣ans
in mentioning the Wittenagemot, seem to contra∣dict
the latter supposition. The members are almost al∣ways
called the <HI>principes, satrapae, optimates, magnates,
proceres;</HI> terms which seem to suppose an aristocracy, and
to exclude the commons. The boroughs also, from the
low state of commerce, were so small and poor, and the
inhabitants lived in such dependance on the great men<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Brady's treatise of English boroughs,, p. 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</NOTE>,
that it seems nowise probable they would be admitted as
a part of the national councils. The commons are well
known to have had no share in the governments estab∣lished
by the Franks, Burgundians, and other northern
nations; and we may conclude, that the Saxons, who
remained longer barbarous and uncivilized than these
tribes, would never think of conferring such an extraor∣dinary
privilege on trade and industry. The military
profession alone was honourable among all those con∣querors:
The warriors subsisted by their possessions in
<PB N="218" REF="242"/>
land: They became considerable by their influence over
their vassals, retainers, tenants, and slaves: And it had
need of strong proofs to convince as that they would ad∣mit
any of a rank so much inferior as the burgesses, to
share with them in the legislative authority. Tacitus in∣deed
affirms, that, among the antient Germans, the con∣sent
of all the members of the community was required
in every important deliberation; but he speaks not of re∣presentatives;
and this antient practice, mentioned by the
Roman historians, could only have place in small tribes,
where every citizen might without inconvenience be
assembled upon any extraordinary emergency. After
principalities became more extensive; after the differences
of property bad formed distinctions more important than
those arising from personal strength and valour; we may
conclude, that the national assemblies must have been
more limited in their number, and composed only of the
more considerable citizens.</P>
<P>BUT tho' we must exclude the burgesses or commons
from the Saxon Wittenagemot; there is some necessity
for supposing, that this assembly consisted of other mem∣bers
besides the prelates, abbots, aldermen, and the jud∣ges
or privy council. For as all these, excepting some of
the ecclesiastics<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">There is some reason to think, that the bishops were sometimes chosen by the Wittenagemot, and confirmed by the King. Eddius cap. 2. The abbots in the monasteries of the royal foundation were antiently named by the king; tho' Edgar gave the monks the election, and only reserved to himself the ratification. This destination was af∣terwards frequently violated; and the abbots as well as bishops were af∣terwards all appointed by the court; as we learn from Ingulf, a writer contemporary to the conquest.</NOTE>, were antiently appointed by the King,
had there been no other legislative authority, the royal
power had been in a great measure despotic, contrary to
the tenor of all the historians, and to the practice of all
<PB N="223" REF="243"/>
other, and the fine, which they engage to pay for that of∣fence,
is a measure of honey.</P>
<P>IT is not to be doubted, but a confederacy of this
kind must have been a great source of friendship and at∣tachment,
when men lived in perpetual danger from ene∣mies,
robbers and oppressors, and received protection
chiefly from their personal valour, and from the assistance
of their friends or patrons. As animosities were then
more violent, connexions were also more intimate, whe∣ther
voluntary or derived from blood: The most remote
degree of propinquity was regarded: An indelible memo∣ry
of benefits was preserved: Severe vengeance was ta∣ken
of injuries, both from a point of honour, and as the
best means of future security: And the civil union being
weak, many private confederacies were entered into to
supply its place, and to procure men that safety, which
the laws and their own innocence were not alone able to
insure them.</P>
<P>ON the whole, notwithstanding the seeming liberty or
rather licentiousness of the Anglo-Saxons, the great bo∣dy
of the people, in these ages, really enjoyed much less
true liberty, than where the execution of the laws is the
most severe, and where subjects are reduced to the strict∣est
subordination and dependance on the civil magistrate.
The reason is derived from the excess itself of that liber∣ty.
Men must guard themselves at any price against in∣sults
and injuries; and where they receive not protection
from the laws and magistrate, they will seek it by sub∣mission
to superiors, and by herding in some inferior con∣federacy,
which acts under the direction of a powerful
chieftain. And thus all anarchy is the immediate cause
of tyranny, if not over the state, at least over many of
the individuals.</P>
<P>THE German Saxons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seve∣ral orders of men.</NOTE> as the other nations of that
continent, were divided into three ranks of men, the
<PB N="224" REF="244"/>
noble, the free, and the slaves<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Nithard. hist. lib. 4.</NOTE>. This distinction they
brought over with them into Britain.</P>
<P>THE nobles were called thanes; and were of two
kinds, the King's thanes and lesser thanes. The latter
seem to have been dependant on the former; and to have
received lands, for which they paid rent, services, or at∣tendance
in peace, and war<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Feuds and Tenures, p. 40.</NOTE>. We know of no other title,
which raised any one to the rank of thane, except noble
birth and the possession of land. The former was always
much regarded by all the German nations even in their
most barbarous state; and as the Saxon nobility had few
expensive pleasures to dissipate their fortune, and the com∣mons
little trade or industry by which they could accumu∣late
riches, these two ranks of men, even tho' they were
not separated by positive laws, might remain long distinct,
and the noble families continue many ages in opulence
and splendor. There were no middle rank of men, who
could mix gradually with their superiors, and procure to
themselves insensibly honour and distinction. If by any
extraordinary accident, a mean person acquired riches,
a circumstance so singular made him be known and re∣marked;
he became the object of envy, as well as indig∣nation,
to all the nobles; he would have great difficulty
to defend what he had acquired; and he would find it
impossible to protect himself from oppression, except by
courting the patronage of some great chieftain, and pay∣ing
a large price for his safety.</P>
<P>THERE are two statutes among the Saxon laws, which
seem calculated to confound these different ranks of men;
that of Athelstan, by which a merchant, who had made
three long sea voyages on his own account, was intitled
to the quality of thane<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 71.</NOTE>; and that of the same prince, by
<PB N="225" REF="245"/>
which a ceorle or, husbandman, who had been able to
purchase five hydes of land, and had a chapel, a kitchen,
a hall and bell, was raised to the same distinction<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Selden Titles of honour, p. 515. Wilkins, p. 70.</NOTE>. But
the opportunities were so few, by which a merchant or
ceorle could thus exalt himself above his rank, that the
law could never overcome the reigning prejudices; the
distinction between noble and base blood would still be
indelible; and the well-born thanes would entertain the
highest contempt for those legal and factitious ones. Tho'
we are not informed of any of these circumstances by an∣tient
historians, they are so much founded on the nature
of things, that we may admit them as a necessary and in∣fallible
consequence of the situation of the kingdom du∣ring
those ages.</P>
<P>THE cities appear by Domesday-book to have been at
the conquest little better than villages<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Winchester, being the capital of the West-Saxon monarchy, was antiently a considerable city. Gul. Pict. p. 210.</NOTE>. York itself, tho'
it was always the second, at least the third<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Norwich contained 738 houses, Exeter, 315, Ipswich, 538, North∣ampton, 60, Hertford, 146, Canterbury, 262, Bath, 64, Southamp∣ton, 84, Warwick, 113. See Brady of Boroughs, p. 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. These are the most considerable he mentions. The account of them is extracted from Domesday-book.</NOTE> city in Eng∣land,
and was the capital of a great province, which ne∣ver
was thoroughly united with the rest, contained then
but 1418 families<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Brady's treatise of boroughs, p. 10. There were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix wards, besides the archbishop's palace; and five of these wards contained the number of families here mentioned, which at the rate of five persons to a fa∣mily makes about 7000 souls. The sixth ward was laid waste.</NOTE>. Malmesbury tells us<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">P. 102. See also de Gest. Angl. p. 333.</NOTE>, that the
great distinction between the Anglo-Saxon nobility and
the French or Norman, was that the latter built magnifi∣cent
and stately castles; whereas the former consumed their
immense fortunes on riot and hospitality in mean houses.
<PB N="226" REF="246"/>
We may thence infer, that the arts in general were much
less advanced in England than in France; a greater num∣ber
of idle servants and retainers lived about the great fa∣milies;
and as these, even in France, were powerful
enough to disturb the execution of the laws, we may
judge of the authority, acquired by the aristocracy in
England. When earl Godwin besieged the Confessor in
London, he summoned together from all parts his hus∣carles,
or houseceorles and retainers, and obliged his so∣vereign
to accept of the conditions, which he was pleased
to impose upon him.</P>
<P>THE lower rank of freemen were denominated ceorles
among the Anglo-Saxons; and where they were industri∣ous,
they were chiefly employed in husbandry: Whence
a ceorle, and a husbandman, became in a manner syno∣nimous
terms. They cultivated the farms of the nobili∣ty
or thanes, for which they paid rent; and they seem
to have been removeable at pleasure. For there is little
mention of leases among the Anglo-Saxons: The pride
of the nobility, together with the general ignorance of
writing, must have rendered these contracts very rare,
and must have kept the husbandmen in a very dependant
condition. The rents of farms were then chiefly paid in
kind<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, § 70. These laws fixed the rents for a hyde; but it is difficult to convert it into modern measures.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the most numerous rank by far in the community
seems to have been the slaves or villains, who were the
property of their lords, and were consequently incapable,
themselves, of all property. Dr. Brady assures us, from
a survey of Domesday-book<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">General preface to his hist, p. 7, 8, 9, &amp;c.</NOTE>, that, in all the counties
of England, the far greater part of the land was occu∣pied
by them, and that the husbandmen, and still more
the socmen, who were tenants, that could not be removed
<PB N="227" REF="247"/>
at pleasure, were very few in, comparison. This was
not the case with the German nations, as far as we can
collect from the account given, us by Tacitus. The
perpetual wars in the heptarchy, and the depredations of
the Danes, seem to have been the cause of this, great al∣teration
with the Anglo-Saxons. The prisoners taken in
battle, or carried off in the frequent inroads, were redu∣ced
to slavery; and became, by right of war<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">LL. Edg. § 14. apud Spellm. Conc. vol. i. p. 471.</NOTE>, entirely
at the disposal of their lords. Great property in the nobles,
especially if joined to an irregular, administration of jus∣tice,
naturally favours the power of the aristocracy; but
still more so, if the practice of slavery be admitted, and
has become very common. The nobility not only pos∣sess
the influence which always attend riches, but also the
power which the laws give them over their slaves and
villains. It becomes then difficult, and almost impossible,
for a private man to remain altogether free and indepen∣dant.</P>
<P>THERE were two kinds of slaves among the Anglo-Saxons;
houshold slaves, after the manner of the anti∣ents,
and praedial or rustic, after the manner of the Ger∣mans<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Spellm. Gloff. in verb. Servus.</NOTE>. These latter resembled the serfs, which are at
present met with in Poland, Denmark, and some places
in Germany. The power of a master over his slaves was
not unlimited among the Anglo-Saxons, as it was among
their ancestors. If a man beat out his slave's eye or
teeth, the slave recovered his liberty<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelf. § 20.</NOTE>. If he killed him,
he paid a fine to the King; provided the slave died within
a day after the wound or blow: Otherwise it passed un∣punished<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. § 17.</NOTE>.

was always the practice with the German nations<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Tacit. de mor. Germ.</NOTE>
and was continued by the Anglo-Saxons<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, § 11. LL. Aelf. § 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE great lords and abbots among the Anglo-Saxons
possessed a criminal jurisdiction within their territories,
and could punish without appeal any thieves or robbers
whom they caught there<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Higden, lib 1. cap. 50. LL. Edw. Conf. § 26. Spell. Conc. vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p. 415. Gloss. in verb. Haligemot &amp; Infangenthefe.</NOTE>. This institution must have
had a very contrary effect to that intended, and must have
procured robbers a sure protection in the lands of such
noblemen as did not sincerely mean to discourage these
irregularities.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the general strain of the Anglo-Saxon go∣vernment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Courts of justice.</NOTE>
seems to have become aristocratical, there were
still considerable remains of the antient democracy, which
were not indeed sufficient to protect the lowest of the
people, without the patronage of some great lord, but
might give security, and even some degree of dignity, to
the gentry or inferior nobility. The administration of
justice, in particular, by the courts of Decennary, the
Hundred and the County, were well calculated to defend
general liberty, and to restrain the exorbitant power of
the nobles. In the county courts or shiremotes, all the
freeholders were assembled twice a-year, and received ap∣peals
from the other inferior courts. They there decided
all causes, ecclesiastical as well as civil; and the bishop,
together with the alderman or earl, presided over them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">LL. Edg. § 5. Wilkins, p. 78. LL. Canut. § 17. Wilkins, p. 136.</NOTE>
The affair was determined in a summary manner, with∣out
much pleading, formality, or delay, by a majority
of voices; and the bishop and alderman had no further
authority than to keep order among the freeholders, and
<PB N="229" REF="251"/>
interpose with their opinion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hickes Dissert. Epist. p. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</NOTE> Where justice was de∣nied
during three sessions by the Hundred, and then by
the County court, there lay an appeal to the King's
court<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">LL. Edg. § 2. Wilkins, p. 77. LL. Canut. § 18. apud Wilkins, p. 136.</NOTE>; but this was not practised on slight occasions.
The alderman had a third of the fines levied in these
courts<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">LL. Edw. Conf. § 31.</NOTE>; and as most of the punishments were then pe∣cuniary,
this perquisite formed a consilderable part of the
profits belonging to his office. The two thirds also,
which went to the King, made no contemptible, share of
the public revenue. Any freeholder was fined who ab∣sented
himself thrice from these courts<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">LL. Ethelst. § 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>AS the extreme ignorance of the age made deeds and
writings very rare, the County or Hundred court was
the place where the most remarkable civil transactions
were finished, in order to preserve a memorial of them,
and prevent all future disputes. Here testaments were
promulgated, slaves manumitted, bargains of sale con∣cluded;
and sometimes, for greater security, the most
considerable of these deeds were inserted in the blank
leaves of the parish Bible, which thus became a kind of
register, too sacred to be falsified. It was not unusual to
add to the deed an imprecation on all such as should be
guilty of that crime<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hickes Dissert. Epist.</NOTE></P>
<P>AMONG a people, who lived in so simple a manner as
the Anglo-Saxons, the judicial power is always of great∣er
importance than the legislative. There were few or
no taxes imposed by the states: There were few statutes
enacted; and the nation was less governed by laws, than
by customs, which admitted a great latitude of interpre∣tation.
Tho' it should, therefore, be allowed, that the
Wittenagemot was altogether composed of the principal
<PB N="230" REF="252"/>
nobility, the county-courts, where all the freeholders
were admitted, and which regulated all the daily occur∣rences
of life, formed a very wide basis for the govern∣ment,
and were no contemptible check on the aristocracy.
But there is another power still more important than ei∣ther
the judicial or legislative; and that is the power of
injuring or serving by immediate force and violence, for
which it is difficult to obtain redress in courts of justice.
In all extensive governments, where the execution of the
laws is feeble, this power naturally falls into the hands of
the principal nobility; and the degree of it which pre∣vails,
cannot be determined so much by the public sta∣tutes,
as by small strokes of history, by particular cus∣toms,
and sometimes by the reason and nature of things.
The highlands of Scotland, have been long entitled by
law to every privilege of British subjects; but it was not
till very lately that the common people could in fact en∣joy
these privileges.</P>
<P>THE powers of all the members of the Anglo-Saxon
government are disputed among historians and antiquari∣ans;
and the extreme obscurity of the subject, even tho'
faction had never entered into the question, would natu∣rally
have begot those controversies. But the great in∣fluence
of the lords over their slaves and tenants, the
clientship of the burghers, the total want of a middling
rank of men, the total want also of lawyers who did not
then form a separate profession, the extent of the monar∣chy,
the loose execution of the laws, the continued dis∣orders
and convulsions of the state; all these circumstan∣ces
evince, that the Anglo-Saxon government became at
last extremely aristocratical; and the events, during the
period immediately preceding the conquest, confirm this
inference or conjecture.</P>
<P>BOTH the punishments inflicted on crimes by the An∣glo-Saxon
courts of judicature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Criminal law.</NOTE> and the methods of proof
<PB N="231" REF="253"/>
employed in all causes, appear somewhat singular, and
are very different from those which prevail at present
among all civilized nations.</P>
<P>WE must conceive, that the antient Germans were very
little removed from the original state of nature: The so∣cial
confederacy among them was more martial than ci∣vil:
They had chiefly in view the means of attack or de∣fence
against public enemies, not those of protection
against their fellow-citizens: Their possessions were so
slender and so equal, that they were not exposed to great
danger; and the natural bravery of the people made every
man trust to himself and to his particular friends for
his defence or vengeance. This defect in the political
union drew much closer the knot of particular confede∣racies:
An insult upon any man was regarded by all his
relations and associates as a common injury: They were
bound by honour, as well as by a sense of general inte∣rest,
to revenge his death, or any violence which he had
suffered: They retaliated on the aggressor by like vio∣lences;
and if he was protected, as was natural and usu∣al,
by his own clan, the quarrel was spread still wider,
and bred endless disorders in the nation.</P>
<P>THE Frisians, a tribe of the Germans, had never ad∣vanced
beyond this wild and imperfect state of society;
and the right of private revenge still remained among
them unlimited and uncontrouled<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LL. Fris. tit. 2. apud Lindenbrog. p. 491.</NOTE>. But the other Ger∣man
nations, in the age of Tacitus, had made one step
farther towards completing the political or civil union.
Tho' it still continued to be an indispensible point of ho∣nour
for every clan to revenge the death or injury of their
fellow, the magistrate had acquired a right of interposing
in the quarrel, and of accommodating the difference.
He obliged the person maimed or injured, and the rela∣tions
<PB N="232" REF="254"/>
of one killed, to accept of a present from the aggres∣sor
and his relations<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">LL. Aethelb. § 23. LL. Aelf. § 27.</NOTE>, as a compensation for the inju∣ry<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Called by the Saxons <HI>moegbota.</HI></NOTE>, and to drop all farther prosecution of revenge.
That the accommodation of one quarrel might not be
the source of more, this present was fixed and certain,
according to the rank of the person killed or injured, and
was commonly paid in cattle, the chief property of those
rude and uncultivated nations. A present of this kind
gratified the revenge of the injured clan by the loss which
the aggressor suffered: It satisfied their pride by the sub∣mission
which it expressed: It diminished their regret for
the loss or injury of a kinsman by their acquisition of
new property: And thus general peace was for a moment
restored to the society<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Tacit. de mor. Germ. The author says, that the price of the composition was fixed; which must have been by the laws and the interposition of the magistrate.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT when the German nations had been settled some
time in the provinces of the Roman empire, they made
still a new step towards a more cultivated life, and their
criminal justice gradually improved and refined itself.
The magistrate, whose office it was to guard public
peace and to suppress private animosities, conceived him∣self
to be injured by every injury done to any of his peo∣ple;
and besides the compensation to the person who suf∣fered,
or to his clan, he thought himself entitled to exact
a fine, called the Fridwit, as an atonement for the breach
of peace, and as a reward for the pains which he had ta∣ken
in accommodating the quarrel. When this idea,
which is so natural, was once suggested, it was readily
received both by magistrate and people. The numerous
fines which were levied, augmented the profits of the
King: And the people were sensible, that he would be
<PB N="233" REF="255"/>
more vigilant in interposing with his good offices, when
he reaped such immediate advantage by them; and that
injuries would be less frequent, when, besides compensa∣tion
to the person injured, they were exposed to this ad∣ditional
penalty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Besides paying money to the relations of the deceased and to the King, the murderer was also obliged to pay the master of a slave or vassal a sum as a compensation for his loss. This was called the man∣bote. See Spell. Gloss. in verb. Fredam, Manbot.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS short abstract contains the history of the criminal
jurisprudence of the northern nations for several centuries.
The state of England in this particular, during the pe∣riod
of the Anglo-Saxons, may be judged of by the col∣lection
of antient laws, published by Lambard and Wil∣kins.
The chief purport of these laws is not to prevent
or suppress entirely private quarrels, which the legislators
knew to be impossible, but only to regulate and moderate
them. The laws of Alfred enjoin, that if any one
knows, that his enemy or aggressor, after doing him an
injury, resolves to keep within his own house <HI>and his own
lands</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The addition of these last words in Italics appears necessary from what follows in the same law.</NOTE>,
he shall not fight him, till he require compensa∣tion
for the injury. If he be strong enough to besiege
him in his house, he may do it for seven days without at∣tacking
him; and if the aggressor is willing, during that
time, to surrender himself and his arms, his adversary
may detain him thirty days, but is afterwards obliged to
restore him safe to his kindred, <HI>and be contented with the
compensation.</HI> If the criminal fly to the temple, that san∣ctuary
must not be violated. Where the assailant has not
force sufficient to besiege the criminal in his house, he
must apply to the alderman for assistance; and if the al∣derman
refuses aid, the assailant must have recourse to the
King: And he is not allowed to assault the house, till
after a refusal of assistance from this supreme magistrate.
<PB N="234" REF="256"/>
If any one meets with his enemy, and is ignorant that he
was resolved to keep within his own lands, he must, be∣fore
he attacks him, require him to surrender himself a
prisoner, and deliver up his arms; in which case he may
detain him thirty days: But if he refuses to deliver up
his arms, it is then lawful to fight him. A slave may
fight in his master's quarrel: A father may fight in his
son's with any one, except with his master<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelfr. § 28. Wilkins, p. 43.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT was enacted by King Ina, that no man should take
revenge of an injury till he had first demanded compensa∣tion,
and had been refused it<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, § 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>KING Edmond, in the preamble to his laws, mentions
the general dissatisfaction, occasioned by the multiplicity
of private feuds and battles; and he establishes several
expedients to remedy this grievance. He ordains, that
if any one murders another, he may, with the assistance of
his kindred, pay within a twelvemonth the fine of his
crime; and if they abandon him, he shall alone sustain
the deadly feud or quarrel with the kindred of the mur∣dered
person: His own kindred are free from the feud,
but on condition that they neither converse with the cri∣minal,
nor supply him with meat <HI>or other necessaries:</HI> If
any of them, after renouncing him, receive him into
their house, <HI>or give him assistance,</HI> they are finable to the
King, and are involved in the feud. If the kindred of
the murdered person take revenge of any but the criminal
himself, <HI>after he is abandoned by his kindred,</HI> all their pro∣perty
is forfeited, and they are declared to be enemies to the
King and all his friends<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">LL. Edm. § 1. Wilkins, p. 73.</NOTE>. It is also ordained, that the
fine for murder shall never be remitted by the King<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">LL. Edm. § 3.</NOTE>, and
that no criminal shall be killed who flies to the church,
or any of the King's towns<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">LL. Edm. § 2.</NOTE>; and the King himself de∣clares,
<PB N="235" REF="257"/>
that his house shall give no protection to mur∣derers,
till they have satisfied the church by their pe∣nance,
and the kindred of the deceased by making com∣pensation<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">LL. Edm. § 4.</NOTE>.
There follows the method appointed for
transacting this composition<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">LL. Edm. § 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE attempts of Edmond to contract and diminish
the feuds, were contrary to the antient spirit of the nor∣thern
barbarians, and were an advance towards a more
regular administration of justice. By the Salic law, any
man might, by a public declaration, exempt himself
from his family quarrels: But then he was considered by
the law as no longer belonging to the family; and he
was deprived of all right of succession, as a punishment of
his cowardice<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Tit. 63.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE price of the King's head, or his weregild, as it
was then called, was by law 30,000 thrimsas, a species
of coin whose value is uncertain. The price of the
prince's head was 15,000 thrimsas; that of a bishop's or
alderman's 8000; a sheriff's 4000; a thane's or clergy∣man's
2000; a ceorle's 266. These prices were fixed
by the laws of the Angles. By the Mercian law, the
price of a ceorle's head was 200 shillings; that of a
thane's fix times as much; that of a King's six times
more<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 71, 72.</NOTE>. By the laws of Kent, the price of the arch∣bishop's
head was higher than that of the King's<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">LL. Elthredi, apud Wilkins, p. 110.</NOTE>. Such
respect was then paid to the ecclesiastics! It must be un∣derstood,
that where a person was unable to pay the fine,
he was put out of the protection of law, and the kindred
of the deceased had liberty to punish him as they thought
proper.</P>
<P>SOME antiquarians<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel introduct. vol. i. p. 126. Carte, vol. i. p. 366.</NOTE> have thought, that these compensa∣tions
were only given for man-slaughter, not for wilful
<PB N="236" REF="258"/>
murder: But no such distinction appears in the laws;
and it is contradicted by the practice of all the other
barbarous nations<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lindenbrogius, passim.</NOTE>, by that of the antient Germans<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Tac. de mor. Germ.</NOTE>,
and by that curious monument above mentioned of Sax∣on
antiquity, preserved by Hickes. There is indeed a
law of Alfred's, making wilful murder capital<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelf. § 12. Wilkins, p. 29. It is probable, that by wilful murder Alfred means a treacherous murder, committed by one who has no declared feud with another.</NOTE>; but
this seems only to have been an attempt of that great
legislator for establishing a better police in the king∣dom,
and to have remained without execution. By the
laws of the same prince, a conspiracy against the life
of the King might be redeemed by a fine<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelf. § 4. Wilkins, p. 35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE price of all kinds of wounds was likewise fixed
by the Saxon laws: A wound of an inch long under the
hair was paid with one shilling: One of a like size on
the face, two shillings: Thirty shillings for the loss of
an ear; and so forth<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelfr. § 40. See also LL. Ethelb. § 34, &amp;c.</NOTE>. There seems not to have been
any difference made, according to the dignity of the
person. By Ethelbert's laws, any one who committed
adultery with his neighbour's wife was obliged to pay
him a fine, and buy him another wife<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">LL. Ethelb. § 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE institutions are not peculiar to the antient
Germans. They seem to be the necessary progress of
criminal jurisprudence among every free people, where
the will of the sovereign is not implicitly obeyed. We
find them among the antient Greeks during the time of
the Trojan war. Compositions for murder are men∣tioned
in Nestor's speech to Achilles in the ninth Iliad,
and are called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The Irish, who never had any
connections with the German nations, adopted the same
practice till very lately; and the price of a man's head
<PB N="237" REF="259"/>
was called among them his <HI>eric;</HI> as we learn from Sir
John Davis. The same custom seems also to have pre∣vailed
among the Jews<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Exod. cap. 21. 29, 30.</NOTE></P>
<P>THEFT and robbery were very frequent among the
Anglo-Saxons. To impose some check upon these
crimes, it was ordained that no man should fell or buy
any thing above twenty pence value, except in open
market<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">LL. Aethel. § 12.</NOTE>; and every bargain of sale must be executed
before witnesses<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">LL. Aethelst. § 10. 12. LL. Edg. apud Wilkins, p. 80. LL. Ethelredi, § 4. apud Wilkins, p. 103. Hloth. &amp; Eadm. § 16. LL. Canut. § 22.</NOTE>. Gangs of robbers much disturbed the
peace of the country; and the law determined, that a
tribe of banditti, consisting of between seven and thirty∣five
persons, was to be called a <HI>turma,</HI> or troop. Any
greater company was denominated an army<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, § 12.</NOTE>. The pu∣nishments
for this crime were various, but none of them
capital<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, § 37.</NOTE>. If any man could track his stolen cattle into
another's ground, the latter was obliged to show the
tracks out of it, or pay their value<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">LL. Aethelst. § 2. Wilkins, p. 63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TREASON and rebellion, to whatever excess they
were carried, were not then capital, but might be re∣deemed
by a sum of money<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">LL. Ethelredi, apud Wilkins, p. 110. LL. Aelf. § 4. Wilkins, p. 35.</NOTE>. The legislators, knowing
it impossible to prevent all disorders, only imposed a
higher fine on breaches of the peace committed in the
King's court, or before an alderman or bishop. An
alehouse too seems to have been considered as a privi∣leged
place; and any quarrels that arose there were more
severely punished than elsewhere<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">LL. Hloth &amp; Eadm. § 12, 13. LL. Ethelr. apud Wilkins, p. 117.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF the punishments of crimes among the Anglo-Sax∣ons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rules of proof.</NOTE>
appear singular, the proofs were no less so; and were
also the natural result of the situation of these people.

Whatever we may imagine concerning the usual truth
and sincerity of men, who live in a rude and barbarous
state, there is much more falsehood, and even perjury,
among them than among civilized nations; and virtue,
which is nothing but a more enlarged and more cul∣tivated
reason, never flourishes to any degree, nor is
founded on steady principles of honour, except where a
good education becomes general; and men are taught
the pernicious consequences of vice, treachery, and im∣morality.
Even superstition, tho' more prevalent among
ignorant nations, is but a poor supply for the defects of
knowledge and education; and our European ancestors,
who employed every moment the expedient of swearing
on extraordinary crosses and reliques, were less honour∣able
in all engagements than their posterity, who from
experience have omitted those ineffectual securities. This
general proneness to perjury was much increased by the
usual want of discernment in judges, who could not dis∣cuss
an intricate evidence, and were obliged to number,
not weigh, the testimony of the witnesses<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Sometimes the laws fixed easy general rules for weighing the credibility of witnesses. A man whose life was estimated at 120 shillings counterbalanced six ceorles, each of whose lives was only valued at 20 shillings, and his oath was esteemed equivalent to that of all the six. See Wilkins, p. 72.</NOTE>. Hence the
ridiculous practice of obliging men to bring compurga∣tors,
who, as they did not pretend to know any thing
of the fact, expressed upon oath that they believed the
person spoke true; and these compurgators were in some
cases multiplied to the number of three hundred<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Praef. Nicol ad Wilkins, p. 11.</NOTE>. The
practice also of single combat was employed by most na∣tions
on the continent as a remedy against false evi∣dence<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">LL. Burgund. cap. 45. LL. Lomb. lib. 2. tit. 55. cap. 34.</NOTE>;
and tho' it was frequently dropt, from the op∣position
of the clergy, it was continually revived, from
<PB N="239" REF="263"/>
the experience of the falsehood attending the testimony
of witnesses<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">LL. Longob. lib. 2. tit. 55. cap. 23. apud Lindenb. p. 661.</NOTE>. It became at last a species of jurispru∣dence;
and the cases were determined by law, in which
the party might challenge his adversary, or the witnes∣ses,
or the judge himself<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See Desfontaines and Beaumanoir.</NOTE>: And tho' these customs were
absurd, they were rather an improvement on the me∣thods
of trial, which had formerly been practised among
these barbarous nations, and which still prevailed among
the Anglo-Saxons.</P>
<P>WHEN any controversy about a fact became too in∣tricate
for these ignorant judges to unravel, they had re∣course
to what they called the judgment of God, that
is, to fortune; and their methods for consulting this
oracle were various. One of them was the decision by
the <HI>cross;</HI> and it was practised in this manner. When a
person was accused of any crime, he first cleared himself
by oath, attended by eleven compurgators: He next
took two pieces of wood, one of which was marked with
the sign of the cross; and wrapping both up in wool,
he placed them on the altar, or on some celebrated re∣lique.
After solemn prayers for the success of the expe∣riment,
a priest, or in his stead some unexperienced
youth, took up one of the pieces of wood, and if he
happened upon that marked with the figure of the cross,
the person was pronounced innocent; if otherwise,
guilty<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">LL. Frison. tit. 14. apud Lindenbrogium, p. 496.</NOTE>. This practice, as it arose from superstition, was
abolished by it in France. The Emperor, Lewis the
Debonnaire, prohibited that method of trial, not because
it was uncertain, but left that sacred figure, says he, of
the cross should be prostituted in common disputes and
controversies<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Du Cange in verb. Crux.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="264"/>
THE ordeal was another established method of trial
among the Anglo-Saxons. It was practised either by
boiling water or red-hot iron. The water or iron was
consecrated by many prayers, masses, fastings, and ex∣orcisms<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Spellm. in verb. Ordeal. Parker, p. 155. Lindenbrog. p. 1299.</NOTE>;
after which, the person accused either took
up a stone sunk into the water<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, § 77.</NOTE> to a certain depth, or
carried the iron a certain distance; and his hand being
wrapped up, and the covering sealed for three days, if
there appeared on examining it no marks of burning, he
was pronounced innocent; if otherwise, guilty<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Sometimes the person accused walked barefoot over red-hot iron.</NOTE>. The
trial by cold water was different: The person was thrown
into consecrated water; if he swam, he was guilty; if
he sunk, innocent<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Spellman in verb. Ordealium.</NOTE>. It is difficult for us to conceive,
how any innocent person could ever escape by the one
trial, or any criminal be, convicted by the other. But
there was another usage admirably calculated for allow∣ing
every criminal to escape, who had confidence enough
to try it. A consecrated cake, called a corsned, was
produced; which if the person could swallow and digest,
he was pronounced innocent<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Spellm. in verb. Corsned. Parker, p. 156. Text. Roffens. p. 33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE feudal law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Military force.</NOTE> if it had place at all among the An∣glo-Saxons,
which is doubtful, certainly was not ex∣tended
over all the landed property, and was not at∣tended
with those consequences of homage, reliefs<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">On the death of an alderman, a greater or lesser thane, there was a payment made to the King of his best arms; and this was called his he∣riot: But this was not of the nature of a relief. See Spellm. of tenures, p. 32. The value of this heriot was fixed by Canute's laws, § 69.</NOTE>,
wardship, marriage, and other burthens, which were
inseparable from it in the kingdoms of the continent.
As the Saxons expelled or destroyed entirely the antient
<PB N="241" REF="265"/>
Britains, they planted themselves in this island on the
same footing with their ancestors in Germany, and found
no occasion for the feudal institutions<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bracton de Acqu. rer. domin. lib. 2. cap. 16. See more fully Spellman of feuds and tenures, and Cragius de jure feud. lib. 1. dieg. 7.</NOTE>, which were cal∣culated
to maintain a kind of standing army, always in
readiness to suppress any insurrection of the conquered
people. The trouble and expence of defending the state
in England lay equally upon all the land; and it was
usual for every five hides to equip a man for the service.
The <HI>trinoda necessitas,</HI> as it was called, or the burthen of
expeditions, of repairing high-ways, and of building and
supporting bridges, was inseparable from landed pro∣perty,
even tho' it belonged to the church or monaste∣ries,
unless exempted by a particular charter<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Spellm. Conc. vol. 1. p. 256.</NOTE>. The
ceorles or husbandmen were provided with arms, and
were obliged to take their turn in military duty<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Inae, § 51.</NOTE>. There
were computed to be 243,600 hides in England<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spellm. of seuds and tenures, p. 17.</NOTE>; and
consequently the ordinary military force of the kingdom
consisted of 48,720 men; tho', no doubt, on extraordi∣nary
occasions, a greater power might be assembled.
The King and nobility seem to have had some military
tenants, who were called Sithcun-men<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Spellm. Conc. vol. 1. p. 195.</NOTE>. And there
were probably some lands annexed to the office of al∣derman,
and to some other offices; but these seem not
to have been of a great extent, and were possest only
during pleasure, as in the commencement of the feudal
law in other countries of Europe.</P>
<P>THE revenue of the King seems to have consisted<NOTE PLACE="marg">Public re∣venue.</NOTE> chiefly in his demesnes, which were large; and in the
tolls and imposts which he probably levied at discretion
on the boroughs and sea-ports, that lay within his de∣mesnes.
He could not alienate any part of his land,
<PB N="242" REF="266"/>
even to religious uses, without the consent of the states<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Conc. vol. 1. p. 340.</NOTE>.
Danegelt was a land-tax of a shilling a hide, imposed by
the states<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 128.</NOTE>, either for payment of the sums exacted by
the Danes▪ or for putting the kingdom in a posture of
defence against these invaders<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">LL. Edw. Con. § 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Saxon pound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Value of money.</NOTE> as likewise those coined for some
centuries after the conquest, were three times the weight
of our present money: There were forty-eight shillings
in their pound, and five-pence in a shilling<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelf. § 40.</NOTE>; and con∣sequently
a Saxon shilling was a fifth larger than ours,
and a Saxon penny three times as large<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fleetwood's Chron. Pretiosum, p. 27, 28, &amp;c.</NOTE>. As to the
value of money in those times, compared to the necessa∣ries
of life, there are some, tho' not very certain means
of computation. A sheep by the laws of Athelstan was
estimated at a shilling; that is, fifteen-pence of our
money. The fleece was two-fifths of the value of the
whole sheep<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, § 69.</NOTE>; much above its present estimation; of
which the reason probably was, that the Saxons, like
the antients, were little acquainted with any other
cloathing but that made of wool. Silk and cotton, were
quite unknown: Linen was not much used. An ox
was computed at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix times the value of a sheep; a cow
at four<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 66.</NOTE>. If we suppose, that the cattle in that age,
from the defects of husbandry, were not so large as they
are at present in England, we may compute that money
was then near ten times of greater value. A horse was
valued at about thirty-six shillings of our money, or
thirty Saxon shillings<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 126.</NOTE>; a mare a third less. A man at
three pounds<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The board-wages of a child the first
year was eight shillings, a cow's pasture in summer, and
<PB N="243" REF="267"/>
an ox in winter<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, § 38.</NOTE>. William of Malmesbury mentions it
as a high price that William Rufus gave fifteen marks
for a horse, or about thirty pounds of our present money<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P. 121.</NOTE>.
Between the years 900 and 1000, Ednoth bought a hide
of land for about 118 shillings<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hist. Rames. p. 415.</NOTE>. This was a little more
than a shilling an acre, which indeed appears to have been
the usual price, as we may learn from other ac∣counts<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hist. Eliens. p. 473.</NOTE>. A palfrey was sold for twelve shillings about
the year 966<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hist. Eliens. p. 471.</NOTE>. The value of an ox in King Ethelred's
time was between seven and eight shillings; a cow about
six shillings<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 126.</NOTE>. Gervas of Tilbury says, that in Henry
the first's time, bread during a day for a hundred men
was rated at three shillings, or a shilling of that age; for
it is thought that soon after the conquest a pound sterling
was divided into twenty shillings: A sheep was rated at
a shilling, and so of other things in proportion. In
Athelstan's time a ram was valued at a shilling, or four∣pence
Saxon<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 56.</NOTE>. The tenants of Shireburn were obliged,
at their choice, to pay either six-pence or four hens<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Monast Anglic. vol. 2. p. 528.</NOTE>.
About 1232, the abbot of St. Albans, going on a jour∣ney,
hired seven handsome stout horses; and agreed, if
any of them died on the road, to pay the owner 30
shillings a-piece of our present money<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mat. Paris.</NOTE>. It is to be re∣marked,
that in all antient times, corn, being a species
of manufactory, bore always a higher price, compared
to cattle, than it does in our times<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fleetwood, p. 83. 94. 96. 98.</NOTE>. The Saxon Chro∣nicle
tells us<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P. 157.</NOTE>, that in the reign of Edward the Con∣fessor
there was the most terrible famine ever known;
insomuch that a quarter of wheat rose to sixty-pennies,
or about fifteen shillings of our present money. Con∣sequently
it was as dear as if it now cost seven pounds
<PB N="244" REF="268"/>
ten shillings sterling. This much exceeds the great fa∣mine
in the end of Queen Elizabeth; when a quarter of
wheat was sold for four pounds. Money in this last
period was nearly of the same value as in our time.
These enormous famines are a certain proof of bad hus∣bandry.</P>
<P>ON the whole, there are three things to be consider∣ed,
wherever a sum of money is mentioned in antient
times. First, the change of denomination, by which a
pound has been reduced to the third part of its antient
weight in silver. Secondly, the change in value by the
greater plenty of money, which has reduced the same
weight of silver to ten times less value, compared to
commodities; and consequently a pound sterling to the
thirtieth part of the antient value. Thirdly, the fewer
people and less industry, which were then to be found
in every European kingdom. This circumstance made
even the thirtieth part of the sum more difficult to levy,
and caused any sum to have more than thirty times more
weight and influence both abroad and at home, than in
our times; in the same manner that a sum, an hundred
thousand pounds for instance, is at present more difficult
to levy in a small state, such as Bavaria, and can oper∣ate
greater effects on such a small community, than on
England. This last difference is not easy to be calcu∣lated:
But allowing, that England has now above five
times more industry, and three times more people than
it had at the conquest and for some reigns after it, we
are, upon that supposition, to conceive, taking all cir∣cumstances
together, every sum of money mentioned by
historians, as if it were multiplied more than an hundred∣fold
above a sum of the same denomination at present.</P>
<P>IN the Saxon times, land was divided equally among
all the male-children of the deceased, according to the
custom of Gavelkind. Entails were sometimes prac∣tised
<PB N="245" REF="269"/>
in those times<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelf. § 37. apud Wilkins, p. 43.</NOTE>. Lands were chiefly of two kinds,
bockland, or land held by book or charter, which were
regarded as full property, and descended to the heirs of
the possessor; and folkland, or the land held by the ceor∣les
and common people, who were removeable at plea∣sure,
and were indeed only tenants during the will of
their lords.</P>
<P>THE first attempt, which we find in England to se∣parate
the ecclesiastical from the civil jurisdiction, was
that law of Edgar, by which all disputes among the cler∣gy
were ordered to be carried before the bishop<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 83.</NOTE>. The
pennances were then very severe; but as a man could
buy them off by money, or might substitute others to per∣form
them, they lay very easy upon the rich<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 96, 97. Spell. Conc. p. 473.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the manners of the Anglo-Saxons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners.</NOTE>
we can say little, but that they were in general a rude,
uncultivated people, ignorant of letters, unskilful in the
mechanical arts, untamed to submission under law and go∣vernment,
addicted to intemperance, riot, and disorder.
Their best quality was their military courage, which yet
was not supported by discipline of conduct. Their
want of fidelity to the prince, or to any trust reposed
in them, appears strongly in the history of their latter
period; and their want of humanity in all their history.
Even the Norman historians, notwithstanding the low
state of the arts in their own country, speak of them as
barbarians, when they mention the invasion made upon
them by the duke of Normandy. The conquest put the
people in a situation of receiving slowly from abroad the
rudiments of science and cultivation, and of correcting
their rough and licentious manners.</P>

<P>NOTHING could exceed the consternation which<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV.</NOTE>
seized the English, when they received intelli∣gence
of the unfortunate battle of Hastings, the death
of their King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consequen∣ces of the battle of Hastings.</NOTE> the slaughter of their principal nobility,
and of their bravest warriors, and the rout and disper∣sion
of the remainder. But tho' the loss, which they had
sustained in that fatal action, was considerable, it might
easily have been repaired by a great nation; where the
people were generally armed, and where there resided so
many powerful noblemen in every province, who could
have assembled their retainers, and have obliged the duke
of Normandy to divide his army, and probably to waste
it in a multitude of actions and rencounters. It was
thus, that the kingdom had formerly resisted, for many
years, its invaders, and had been gradually subdued,
<PB N="247" REF="271"/>
by the continued efforts of the Romans, Saxons, and
Danes; and equal difficulties might have been appre∣hended
by William in this bold and hazardous enter∣prize.
But there were several vices in the Anglo-Saxon
constitution which rendered it difficult for the English
to defend their liberties in so critical an emergency. The
people had in a great measure lost all national pride and
spirit, by their recent and long subjection to the Danes;
and as Canute had, in the course of his administration,
much abated the rigors of conquest, and had governed
them equitably by their own laws, they regarded with
the less terror the ignominy of a foreign yoke, and deem∣ed
the inconveniences of submission less formidable than
those of bloodshed, war, and resistance. Their attach∣ment
also to the antient royal family had been much
weakened by their habitude of submission to the Danish
princes, and by their late election of Harold, or their
acquiescence in his usurpation. And as they had long
been accustomed to regard Edgar Atheling, the only
heir of the Saxon line, as unfit to govern them even in
times of order and tranquillity; they could entertain
small hopes of his being able to repair such great losses
as they had sustained, or to resist the victorious arms of
the duke of Normandy.</P>
<P>THAT they might not, however, be altogether want∣ing
to themselves in this extreme necessity, the English
took some steps towards adjusting their disjointed govern∣ment,
and uniting themselves against the common ene∣my.
The two potent earls, Edwin and Morcar, who
had fled to London with the remains of the broken ar∣my,
took the lead on this occasion; and in concert with
Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, a man possessed of
great authority, and of ample revenues, proclaimed
Edgar King, and endeavoured to put the people in a
posture of defence, and encourage them to resist the
<PB N="248" REF="272"/>
Norman<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictav. p. 205. Order. Vitalis, p. 502. Hoveden, p. 449. Knyghton, p. 2343.</NOTE>. But the terror of the late defeat, and the
near neighbourhood of the invaders, increased the con∣fusion,
inseparable from great revolutions; and every re∣solution
proposed was hasty, fluctuating, variable; dis∣concerted
by fear or faction; ill planned, and worse ex∣ecuted.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, that his enemies might not have leisure
to recover their consternation or unite their councils,
immediately put himself in motion after his victory, and
resolved to prosecute an enterprize, which nothing but
celerity and vigor could render finally successful. His
first attempt was against Romney, whose inhabitants he
severely punished on account of their cruel treatment of
some Norman seamen and soldiers, who had been car∣ried
thither by stress of weather or by a mistake in their
course<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictav. p. 204.</NOTE>: And foreseeing that his conquest of England
might still be attended with many difficulties and with
much opposition, he thought it necessary, before he
should advance farther into the country, to make himself
master of Dover, which would both secure him a retreat
in case of adverse fortune, and afford him a safe land∣ing-place
for such supplies as might be requisite for as∣sisting
him to push his advantages. The terror, diffused
by his victory at Hastings, was so great, that the garri∣son
of Dover, tho' numerous and well provided of every
thing, immediately capitulated; and as the Normans,
rushing in to take possession of the town, hastily set fire
to some of the houses, William, who was desirous to
conciliate the minds of the English by an appearance of
lenity and justice, made reparation to the inhabitants for
their losses<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Norman army, being much distressed with a dy∣sentery,
was obliged to remain here for eight days; and
<PB N="249" REF="273"/>
the duke, on their recovery, advanced with quick marches
towards London, and by his approach increased the con∣fusions,
which were already so prevalent in the English
councils. The ecclesiastics in particular, whose influence
was great over the people, began to declare in his fa∣vour;
and as most of the bishops and dignified clergy∣men
were even then Frenchmen or Normans, the pope's
bull, by which his enterprize was avowed and conse∣crated,
was now openly insisted on as a reason for ge∣neral
submissiion. The superior learning of these pre∣lates,
by which, during the Confessor's reign, they had
raised themselves above the ignorant Saxons, made their
opinions be received with implicit faith; and a young
prince, like Edgar, whose personal qualities were so
mean, was but ill qualified to resist the impression, which
they made on the minds of the people. A repulse,
which a body of Londoners received from five hundred
Norman horse, renewed the terror of the great defeat at
Hastings<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictav. p. 205. Order. Vital. p. 503.</NOTE>; the easy submission of all the inhabitants of
Kent was an additional discouragement to them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictav. p. 205. It is pretended, that the Kentishmen capitulated for the preservation of their privileges. See Thom. Spott, apud Wilkins Gloss. in verbo Bocland.</NOTE>;
the burning of Southwark before their eyes made them
dread a like fate to their own city; and no man any
longer entertained thoughts but of immediate safety and
of self-preservation. Even the earls, Edwin and Mor∣car,
in despair of making effectual resistance, retired
northwards with their troops to their own provinces<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 449.</NOTE>;
and the people thence disposed themselves unanimously
to yield to the victor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Submission of the English.</NOTE> As soon as William passed the
Thames at Wallingford, and reached Berkhamstead,
Stigand, the primate, made submissons to him; and be∣fore
the prince came within sight of the city, all the
<PB N="250" REF="274"/>
chief nobility, and Edgar Atheling himself, the new
elected King, camp into his camp, and declared their
intention of yielding to his authority<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 450. Flor. Wigorn. p. 634.</NOTE>. They requested
him to accept of their crown, which they now consider∣ed
as vacant; and declared to him, that, as they had
always been ruled by regal power, they desired to fol∣low,
in this particular, the example of their ancestors,
and knew of no one more worthy than himself to hold
the reins of government<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 205. Ord. Vital. p. 503.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' this was the great object, to which the duke's
enterprize tended, he seemed to deliberate on the offer;
and being desirous, at first, of preserving the appearance
of a legal administration, he wished to obtain a more
express and formal consent both of his own army and
of the English nation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictav. p. 205.</NOTE>: But Aimar of Aquitain, a man
equally respected for his valour in the field, and for his
prudence in council, remonstrating with him on the
danger of delay in so critical a conjuncture, he laid aside
all farther scruples, and accepted of the crown which
was proffered to him. Orders were immediately issued
to prepare every thing for the ceremony of his corona∣tion;
but as he was yet afraid to place entire confidence
in the Londoners, who were numerous and warlike, he
meanwhile commanded fortresses to be erected in order
to curb the inhabitants, and to secure his person and
government<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>STIGAND was not much in the duke's favour, both
because he had intruded into the see on the expul∣sion
of Robert, the Norman, and because he possessed
such influence and authority over the English<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 6.</NOTE> as might
be dangerous to a new established monarch. William,
<PB N="251" REF="275"/>
therefore, pretending that the primate had obtained his
pall in an irregular manner from pope Benedict IX. who
was himself an usurper, refused to be consecrated by
him<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pticav. p. 206. Ingulf, p. 69. Malmef. p. 102. Hoveden, p. 450. M. West p. 245. Flor. Wig. 635. M. Paris, p. 4. An∣glia Sacra, vol. 1. p. 248. Alur. Bever. p. 127.</NOTE>, and conferred that honour on Aldred, archbishop
of York. Westminster abbey was the place appointed
for that magnificent ceremony; the most considerable of
the nobility, both English and Norman, attended the
duke on this occasion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th Dec.</NOTE> Aldred in a short speech asked
the former, whether they agreed to accept of William
as their King; the bishop of Constance put the same
question to the latter; and both being answered with
acclamations<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 503.</NOTE>, Aldred administered to the duke the
usual coronation oath, by which he bound himself to
protect the church, to administer justice, and to repress
violence; and he then anointed him and put the crown
upon his head<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Malmesbury, p. 271, says, that he also promised to govern the Normans and English by equal laws; and this addition to the usual oath seems not improbable, considering the circumstances of the times.</NOTE>. There appeared nothing but joy in
the countenance of the spectators: But in that very
moment, there burst forth the strongest symptoms of
the jealousy and animosity which prevailed between the
nations, and which continually encreased during the
reign of this prince. The Norman soldiers, who were
placed without in order to guard the church, hearing
the shouts within, fancied that the English were com∣mitting
violence on their duke; and they immediately
assaulted the populace, and set fire to the neighbouring
houses. The alarm was conveyed to the nobility who
surrounded the prince; both English and Normans, full
of apprehensions, rushed out to secure themselves from
<PB N="252" REF="276"/>
the present danger; and it was with difficulty, that
William himself was able to appease the tumult<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 206. Order. Vitalis, p. 503.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE King, thus possessed of the throne by a pretend∣ed
destination of King Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1067. Settlement of the go∣vernment.</NOTE> and by an irregular
election of the people, but still more by force of arms,
retired from London to Berking in Essex; and there re∣ceived
the submissions of all the nobility, who had not
attended his coronation. Edric, sirnamed the Forester,
grand-nephew to that Edric, so noted for his repeated
acts of perfidy during the reigns of Ethelred and Ed∣mond;
earl Coxo, a man famous for bravery; even Ed∣win
and Morcar, earls of Mercia and Northumberland;
with the other principal noblemen of England, came and
swore fealty to him; were received into favour; and
were confirmed in the possession of their estates and dig∣nities<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictav. p. 208. Order. Vital. p. 506.</NOTE>.
Every thing bore the appearance of peace and
tranquillity; and William had no other occupation than
to give contentment to the foreigners who had helped
him to the throne, and to his new subjects, who had so
readily submitted to him.</P>
<P>HE had got possession of the treasure of Harold, which
was considerable; and being also supplied with rich pre∣sents
from the opulent men in all parts of England, who
were solicitous to gain the favour of their new sovereign,
he distributed great sums among his troops, and by this
liberality gave them hopes of obtaining at length those
more durable establishments, which they had expected
from his enterprize<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 206.</NOTE>. The ecclesiastics, both at home
and abroad, had much forwarded his success; and he
failed not, in return, to express his gratitude and de∣votion
in the manner which was most acceptable to
them: He sent Harold's standard to the Pope, accompa∣nied
with many valuable presents: All the considerable
<PB N="253" REF="277"/>
monasteries and churches in France, where prayers had
been put up for his success, now tasted of his bounty<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 206.</NOTE>:
The English monks found him well disposed to favour
their order; and he built a new convent near Hastings,
which he called <HI>Battle-Abbey,</HI> and which, on pretence of
supporting monks to pray for his own soul, and that of
Harold, served as a perpetual memorial of his victory<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. p. 288. Chron. Sax. p. 189. M. West. p. 226. M. Paris, p. 9. Diceto, p. 482. This convent was freed by him from all episcopal jurisdiction. Monast. Ang. tom. 1. p. 311, 312.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE introduced into England that strict execution of
justice, for which his administration had been so cele∣brated
in Normandy; and even during this violent re∣volution,
every disorder or oppression met with the most
rigorous punishment<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 208. Order. Vital. p. 506.</NOTE>. His own army in particular was
governed with severe discipline; and notwithstanding the
insolence of victory, care was taken to give as little of∣fence
as possible to the jealousy of the vanquished<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 207. Order. Vital. p. 505. 506.</NOTE>. The
King appeared solicitous to unite in an amicable man∣ner
the Normans and the English, by intermarriages and
alliances; and all his new subjects who approached his
person were received with affability and regard. No
signs of suspicion appeared, not even towards Edgar
Atheling, the heir of the antient royal family, whom he
confirmed in the honours of earl of Oxford, conferred
on him by Harold, and whom he affected to treat with
the highest kindness, as nephew to the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essor, his
great friend and benefactor<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 208.</NOTE>. Tho' he forfeited the
estates of Harold, and of those who had fought in the
battle of Hastings on the side of that prince, whom he
represented as an usurper, he seemed willing to admit of
every plausible excuse for past opposition to his preten∣sions<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 207. Order. Vital. p. 506.</NOTE>,
<PB N="254" REF="278"/>
and received many into favour, who had carried
arms against him. He confirmed the liberties and immu∣nities
of London and the other cities of England; and ap∣peared
desirous of replacing every thing on antient esta∣blishments.
In his whole administration, he bore the
semblance of the lawful prince, not of the conqueror<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 962.</NOTE>;
and the English began to flatter themselves, that they had
changed, not the form of their government, but only the
succession of their sovereigns, a matter which gave them
small concern. And the better to reconcile his new sub∣jects
to his authority, he made a progress thro' some parts
of England; and besides a splendid court and majestic
presence, which overawed the people, already struck with
his military fame, the appearance of his clemency and
justice gained the approbation of the wise, who were at∣tentive
to the first steps of their new sovereign<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT amidst this confidence and friendship, which he
expressed for the English, the King took care to place all
real power in the hands of his Normans, and still to keep
possession of the sword, to which, he was sensible, he had
owed his advancement to sovereign authority. He dis∣armed
the city of London and other places, which ap∣peared
most warlike and populous<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Baker, p. 24.</NOTE>; and building for∣tresses
and citadels in that capital, as well as in Winche∣ster,
Hereford, and the cities best situated for command∣ing
the kingdom, he quartered Norman soldiers in all
of them, and left no where any power able to resist or
oppose him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. P. 208. Order. Vital. p. 506. M. West. p. 225. M. Paris, p. 4.</NOTE>. He bestowed the forfeited estates on the
most powerful of his captains, and established funds for
the payment of his soldiers<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 208.</NOTE>. And thus, while his civil
administration carried the face of a legal magistrate, his
<PB N="255" REF="279"/>
military institutions were those of a master and tyrant;
at least of one, who reserved to himself, whenever he
pleased, the power of assuming that character.</P>
<P>By this mixture, however, of vigour and lenity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's re∣turn to Normady.</NOTE> he
had so pacified the minds of the English, that he thought
he might safely revisit his native country, and enjoy the
triumph and congratulation of his antient subjects. He
left the administration in the hands of his uterine brother,
Odo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> bishop of Baieux, and of William Fitz Osbern<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wigorn. p. 635. Sim. Dunelm. p. 197. Alur. Beverl. p. 125.</NOTE>;
and that their authority might be exposed to less danger,
he carried over with him all the most considerable nobi∣lity
of England, who both served to grace his court by
their presence and magnificent retinues, and were detain∣ed
as hostages for the fidelity of the nation<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 506.</NOTE>. Among
these, were Edgar Atheling, Stigand the primate, the
earls Edwin and Morcar, Waltheof, the son of the fa∣mous
and brave earl Siward, with others, eminent for
the greatness of their fortunes and families, or for their
ecclesiastical and civil dignities<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 209. Order. Vital. p. 506. Hoveden, p. 450. Flor. Wigorn. p. 635. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 46. Knyghton, p. 2343.</NOTE>. He was visited at the
abbey of Fescamp, where he resided during some time,
by Rodulph, uncle to the French King<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 211. Order. Vital. p. 506.</NOTE>, and by many
powerful princes and nobles, who, having contributed
to his enterprize, were desirous of participating in the
joy and advantages of its success. His English courti∣ers,
willing to ingratiate themselves with their new so∣vereign,
endeavoured to outshine each other in equipages
and entertainments; and made a display of riches, which
struck the foreigners with astonishment. William of
Poictiers, a Norman historian<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">P. 211, 212.</NOTE>, who was present, speaks
with admiration of the beauty of their persons, the size
<PB N="256" REF="280"/>
and workmanship of their silver plate, the costiliness of
their embroideries, an art in which the English then ex∣celled;
and he expresses himself in such terms, as would
much exalt our idea of the opulence and cultivation of
the people<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">As the historian chiefly insists on the silver plate, his panegyrics on the English magnificence shows only how incompetent a judge he was of the matter. Silver was then of ten times the value, and was more than twenty times more rare than at present; and consequently, of all species of luxury, plate must have been the rarest.</NOTE>. But tho' every thing bore the face of joy
and festivity, and William himself treated his new cour∣tiers
with great appearance of kindness, it was impos∣sible
to prevent altogether the insolence of the Normans;
and the English nobles received small pleasure from those
entertainments, where they considered themselves as led
in triumph by their ostentatious conqueror.</P>
<P>AFFAIRS in England took still a worse turn during the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents of the Eng∣lish.</NOTE>
absence of the sovereign. Discontents and complaints
multiplied every where; secret conspiracies were entered
into against the government; hostilities were already be∣gun
in many places; and every thing seemed to menace
a revolution as rapid as that which had placed William
on the throne. The historian above-mentioned, who is
a panegyrist of his master, throws the blame entirely on
the fickle and mutinous disposition of the English, and
highly celebrates the justice and lenity of Odo's and
Fitz Osbern's administration<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">P. 212.</NOTE>. But other historians,
with more probability, impute the cause chiefly to the
Normans, who, despising a people that had so easily sub∣mitted
to the yoke, envying their riches, and grudging
the restraints imposed upon their own rapine, were de∣sirous
of provoking them to a rebellion, by which they
hoped to acquire new confiscations and forfeitures, and
to satisfy those unbounded hopes, which they had formed
in entering on this enterprize<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 507.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="281"/>
IT is evident, that the chief reason of this alteration
in the sentiments of the English, must be ascribed to the
departure of William, who was alone capable of curbing
the violence of his captains, and of overawing the muti∣nies
of the people. Nothing indeed appears more strange,
than that this prince, in less than three months after the
conquest of a great, warlike, and turbulent nation, should
absent himself, in order to revisit his own country, which
remained in profound tranquillity, and was not menaced
by any of its neighbours; and should leave so long his
jealous subjects at the mercy of an insolent and licentious
army. Were we not assured of the solidity of his genius,
and the good sense displayed in all other circumstances of
his conduct, we might ascribe this measure to a vain os∣tentation,
which rendered him impatient to display his
pomp and magnificence among his antient courtiers. It
is therefore more natural to believe, that in so extraor∣dinary
a step, he was guided by a concealed policy; and
that tho' he had thought proper at first to allure the peo∣ple
to submission by the semblance of a legal administra∣tion,
he found, that he could neither satisfy his rapacious
captains, nor secure his unstable government, without
exerting farther the rights of conquest, and seizing
the possessions of the English. In order to give a pre∣tence
for this violence, he endeavoured, without disco∣vering
his intention, to provoke and allure them into
insurrections, which, he thought, could never prove dan∣gerous,
while he detained all the principal nobility in
Normandy, while a great and victorious army was quar∣tered
in England, and while he himself was so near to
suppress any tumult or rebellion. But as no antient wri∣ter
has ascribed this tyrannical purpose to William, it
scarce seems allowable, from conjecture alone, to throw
such an imputation upon him.</P>
<P>BUT whether we are to account for that measure from<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their in∣surrections.</NOTE>
the King's vanity or from his policy, it was the immedi∣ate
<PB N="258" REF="282"/>
cause of all the calamities which the English endured
during this and the subsequent reigns, and gave rise to
those mutual jealousies and animosities between them
and the Normans, which were never appeased, till a long
tract of time had gradually united the two nations, and
had made them one people. The inhabitants of Kent,
who had first submitted to the conqueror, were the first
who attempted to throw off the yoke; and in confede∣racy
with Eustace, count of Bologne, who had also been
disgusted by the Normans, made an attempt, tho' with∣out
success, on the garrison of Dover<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. p. 289. Order. Vital. p. 508. Anglia Sacra, vol. i, p. 245.</NOTE>. Edric, the
Forester, whose possessions lay on the banks of the Se∣verne,
being provoked at the depredations of some Nor∣man
captains in his neighbourhood, formed an alliance
with Blethyn and Rowallan, two Welsh princes; and
endeavoured, with their assistance, to repel force by force<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 450. M. West. p. 226. Sim. Dunelm. p. 197.</NOTE>.
But tho' these open hostilities were not very considerable,
the disaffection was general among the English, who had
become sensible, tho' too late, of their defenceless con∣dition,
and began already to experience those insults and
injuries, which a nation must always expect, that allows
itself to be reduced to that despicable situation. A secret
conspiracy was entered into to perpetrate in one day a ge∣neral
assassination of the Normans, like that which had
been formerly executed against the Danes<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. p. 289.</NOTE>; and the
quarrel was become so universal and national, that the
vassals of earl Coxo, having desired him to head them in
an insurrection, and finding him resolute in maintaining
his fidelity to William, put him to death as a traitor to
his country<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 212. Order. Vital. p. 509.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="283"/>
THE King, informed of these dangerous discontents,
hastened over to England; and by his presence, and the
vigorous measures which he pursued, disconcerted all the
schemes of the conspirators.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Decemb.</NOTE> Such of them as had been
more open in their mutiny betrayed their guilt, by flying
or concealing themselves; and the confiscation of their
estates, while it increased the number of malecontents,
both enabled William to gratify farther the rapacity of his
Norman captains, and gave them the prospect of new
forfeitures and attainders<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 369. M. West. p. 225.</NOTE>. The King began to regard
all his English subjects as inveterate and irreclaimable
enemies; and thenceforth either embraced, or was more
fully confirmed in his resolution, of seizing their pos∣sessions,
and of reducing them to the most abject slavery.
Tho' the natural violence and severity of his temper made
him incapable of feeling any scruples in the execution of
this tyrannical purpose, he had art enough to conceal his
intention, and to preserve still some appearance of justice
in his oppressions. He ordered all the English, who had
been arbitrarily expelled by the Normans, during his ab∣sence,
to be restored to their estates<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax▪ p. 173▪ This fact is a full proof, that the Normans had committed great injustice, and were the real cause of the insur∣rections of the English.</NOTE>: But at the same
time, he imposed a general tax on the people, that of
Danegelt, which had been abolished by the Confessor,
and which had always been extremely odious to the na∣tion<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 450. Sim. Dunelm. p. 197. Alur. Beverl. p. 127.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the vigilance of William overawed the malecon∣tents,<NOTE PLACE="foot">1068.</NOTE>
their insurrections were more the result of an im∣patient
humour in the people, than of any regular con∣spiracy,
which could give them a rational hope of success
against the established power of the Normans. The in∣habitants
<PB N="260" REF="284"/>
of Exeter, instigated by Githa, mother to King
Harold, refused to admit a Norman garrison, and betak∣ing
themselves to arms, were strengthened by the acces∣sion
of the neighbouring inhabitants of Devonshire and
Cornwal<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 510.</NOTE>. The King hastened with his forces to chas∣tize
this revolt; and on his approach, the wiser and more
considerable citizens, sensible of the unequal contest, per∣suaded
the people to submit, and to deliver hostages for
their obedience. A sudden mutiny of the populace broke
this agreement; and William, appearing before the walls,
ordered the eyes of one of the hostages to be put out, as
an earnest of that severity, which the rebels must expect,
if they persevered in their revolt<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The inhabitants
were anew seized with terror, and surrendering at dis∣cretion,
threw themselves at the King's feet, and entreat∣ed
for clemency and forgiveness. William was not de∣void
of generosity, when his temper was not hardened
either by policy or passion: He was prevailed on to pardon
the rebels, and he set guards on all the gates, in order to
prevent the rapacity and insolence of his soldiery<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Gi∣tha
escaped with her treasures to Flanders<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 450. Flor. Wigorn. p. 635.</NOTE>. The insur∣gents
of Cornwal imitated the example of Exeter, and
met with like treatment: And the King, having built
a citadel in that city, which he put under the command
of Baldwin, son of earl Gilbert<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 510.</NOTE>, returned to Winche∣ster,
and dispersed his army into their quarters. He was
here joined by his wife, Matilda, who had not yet visit∣ed
England, and whom he now ordered to be crowned
by archbishop Aldred<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Hoveden, p. 450. M. West. p. 226. Flor. Wigorn. p. 635.</NOTE>. Soon after, she brought him an ac∣cession
to his family, by the birth of a fourth son, whom he
<PB N="261" REF="285"/>
named Henry<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 226.</NOTE>. His three elder sons, Robert, Richard,
and William, still resided in Normandy.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the King appeared thus fortunate both in
public and domestic life, the discontents of his English
subjects augmented daily; and the injuries, committed
and suffered on both sides, rendered the quarrel between
them and the Normans absolutely incurable. The inso∣lence
of victorious masters, dispersed throughout the king∣dom,
seemed intolerable to the natives; and wherever they
found the Normans, separate or assembled in small bodies,
they secretly set upon them, and gratified their vengeance
by the slaughter of their enemies<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 225.</NOTE>. But an insurrection
in the north drew thither the general attention, and seemed
to promise more important consequences. Edwin and
Morcar appeared at the head of this rebellion; and these
potent noblemen, before they took arms, stipulated for
foreign succours, from their nephew Blethin, prince of
North-Wales, from Malcolm, King of Scotland, and
from Sweyn, King of Denmark. Besides the general
discontent, which had seized all the English; the two
earls were instigated to this revolt by private injuries.
William, in order to insure them to his interests, had, on
his accession, promised his daughter in marriage to Ed∣win;
but either he had never seriously intended to per∣form
this engagement, or having changed his plan of ad∣ministration
in England from clemency to rigour, he
thought it was to little purpose, if he gained one family,
while he enraged the whole nation. When Edwin,
therefore, renewed his application, he gave him an abso∣lute
refusal<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 511.</NOTE>; and this disappointment, added to so ma∣ny
other reasons of disgust, induced that nobleman and
his brother to concur with their enraged countrymen,
and to make one effort for the recovery of their antient
<PB N="262" REF="286"/>
liberties. William knew the importance of celerity in
quelling an insurrection, supported by such powerful
leaders, and so agreeable to the wishes of the people;
and having his troops always in readiness, he advanced
by great journies to the north. On his march, he gave
orders to fortify the castle of Warwick, of which he left
Henary de Beaumont governor, and that of Nottingham,
which he committed to the custody of William Peverell,
another Norman captain<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 511.</NOTE>. He reached York before the
rebels were in any condition for resistance, or were join∣ed
by any of the foreign succours, which they expected,
except a small reinforcement from Wales<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and the two
earls found no other means of safety, but having recourse
to the clemency of the victor. Archil, a potent noble∣man
in those parts, imitated their example, and delivered
his son as a hostage of his fidelity<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; nor were the people,
thus deserted by their leaders, able to make any farther
resistance. But the treatment, which William gave the
chieftains and their followers, was very different. He ob∣served
religiously the terms, which he had granted the
former; and allowed them, for the present, to keep pos∣session
of their estates; but he extended the rigors of his
confiscations over the latter, and gave away their lands
to his foreign adventurers, who, being planted thro' the
whole country, and being possessed of the military power,
left Edwin and Morcar, whom he pretended to spare,
destitute of all support, and ready to fall, whenever he
should think proper to command their ruin. A peace,
which he made with Malcolm, who did him homage for
Cumberland, seemed, at the same time, to deprive them
of all prospect of foreign assistance<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English were now sensible, that their final de∣struction
was intended; and that instead of a sovereign,
whom they had at first hoped to gain by their submissions,
<PB N="263" REF="287"/>
they had tamely surrendered themselves, without resist∣ance,
to a tyrant and a conqueror. Tho' the early con∣fiscation
of Harold's followers might seem iniquitous;
being extended towards men who had never sworn fidelity
to the duke of Normandy, who were ignorant of his
pretensions, and who only fought in defence of the go∣vernment,
which they themselves had established in their
own country: Yet were these rigors, however contrary
to the antient Saxon laws, excused on account of the ur∣gent
necessities of the prince; and those who were not
involved in the present ruin, hoped, that they would
thenceforth enjoy without molestation their possessions
and their dignities. But the successive destruction of so
many other families convinced them, that the King in∣tended
to rely entirely on the support and affections of
foreigners; and they foresaw new forfeitures, attainders,
and violences as the necessary result of this destructive
plan of administration. They observed, that no English∣man
possessed his confidence, or was intrusted with any
command or authority; and that the strangers, whom a
rigorous discipline could have but ill contained, were en∣couraged
in every act of insolence and tyranny against
them. The easy submission of the kingdom on its first
invasion had exposed the natives to contempt; the subse∣quent
proofs of their animosity and resentment had made
them the object of hatred; and they were now deprived
of every expedient, by which they could hope to make
themselves either regarded or beloved by their sovereign.
Impressed with the sense of this dismal situation, many
Englishmen fled into foreign countries, with an intention
of passing their lives abroad free from oppression, or of
returning on a favourable opportunity to assist their friends
in the recovery of their native liberties<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 508. M. West. p. 225. M. Paris, p. 4. Sim. Dun. p. 197.</NOTE>.
<PB N="264" REF="288"/>
himself, dreading the insidious caresses of William,
was persuaded by Cospatric, a powerful Northumbrian,
to escape with him into Scotland; and he carried thither
his two sisters, Margaret and Christina. They were well
received by Malcolm, who soon after espoused Margaret,
the elder sister<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 16<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. H. Hunt. p. 369. Hoveden, p. 450. 452.</NOTE>; and partly with a view of strengthen∣ing
his kingdom by the accession of so many strangers,
partly in hopes of employing them against the growing
power of William, he gave great countenance to all the
English exiles<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 103. M. West. p. 225. M. Paris. p. 4.</NOTE>. Many of them settled there; and laid
the foundations of families which afterwards made a
figure in that kingdom.</P>
<P>WHILE the English suffered under these oppressions,
even the foreigners were not much at their ease; but find∣ing
themselves surrounded on all hands by enraged ene∣mies,
who took every advantage against them, and me∣naced
them with still more bloody effects of the public
resentment, they began to wish again for the tranquillity
and security of their native country. Hugh de Grent∣mesnil,
and Humphrey de Teliol, tho' entrusted with
great commands, desired to be dismissed the service; and
some others imitated their example: A desertion which
was highly resented by the King, and which he punished
by the confiscation of all their possessions<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 512.</NOTE>. But Wil∣liam's
bounty to his followers could not fail of alluring
many new adventurers into his service; and the rage of
the vanquished English served only to excite the atten∣tion
of the King and these warlike chiestains, and keep
them in readiness to suppress every commencement of
domestic rebellion or foreign invasion.</P>
<P>IT was not long before they found occupation for their
prowess and military conduct.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1069.</NOTE> Godwin, Edmond, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">New insur∣rections.</NOTE>
<PB N="265" REF="289"/>
Magnus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1069.</NOTE> three sons of Harold, had immediately after the
defeat at Hastings, sought a retreat in Ireland; and ha∣ving
met with a kind reception from Dermot and other
princes of that country, they projected an invasion of
England<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. p. 290. Order. Vital. p. 513. Ypod. Neustr. p. 437.</NOTE>, and hoped that all the exiles from Denmark,
Scotland, and Wales, assisted with forces from these several
countries, would at once commence hostilities, and rouze
the indignation of the English against their haughty con∣querors.
They landed in Devonshire; but found Brian,
son of the count of Brittany, ready to oppose them at
the head of some foreign troops; and being defeated in
several actions, they were obliged to retreat to their ships,
and to return with great loss into Ireland<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. p. 290. Order. Vital. p. 513. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 246.</NOTE>. The efforts
of the Normans were now directed to the north, where
affairs had fallen into the utmost confusion. The impa∣tient
Northumbrians had attacked Robert de Comyn,
who was appointed governor of Durham; and gaining
the advantage over him from his negligence, they put him
to death in that city with seven hundred of his followers<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 512. Chron. de Mailr. p. 160. Hoveden, p. 450. M. Paris, p. 5. Sim. Dun. p. 198.</NOTE>.
This example animated the inhabitants of York, who,
rising in arms, slew Robert Fitz-Richard, their govern∣or<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 512.</NOTE>;
and besieged in the castle William Mallet, on
whom the command now devolved. A little after, the
Danish troops landed from 300 vessels, under the com∣mand
of Osberner, brother to King Sweyn, and accom∣panied
by Harold and Canute, the two sons of that mo∣narch<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 174. Order. Vital. p. 513. Hoveden, p. 451. M. West. p. 226.</NOTE>.
Edgar Atheling appeared from Scotland, and
brought along with him Cospatric, Waltheof, Siward,
<PB N="266" REF="290"/>
Bearne, Merleswain, Adelin, and other chieftains<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 513. Hoveden, p. 451. Flor. Wigorn. p. 635. M. Paris, p. 5. Sim. Dun. p. 198.</NOTE>, who
partly from the hopes which they gave of Scottish suc∣cours,
partly from their authority in those parts, easily
persuaded the warlike and discontented Northumbrians
to join the insurrection. Mallet, that he might better
provide for the defence of the citadel of York, set fire to
some houses, which lay contiguous<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Brompton. p. 966.</NOTE>; but this expedient
proved the immediate cause of his destruction. The
flames spreading into the neighbouring streets, reduced
the whole city to ashes; and the enraged inhabitants,
aided by the Danes, took advantage of the confusion to
attack the castle, which they carried by assault; and they
put the garrison, amounting to the number of 3000, to
the sword without mercy<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 513. Hoveden, p. 451. Flor. Wigorn. p. 636. Brompton. 966.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS success proved a signal to many other parts of
England, and gave the people an opportunity of showing
their malevolence to the Normans. Hereward, a noble∣man
in East-Anglia, celebrated for valour, assembled his
followers, and taking shelter in the Isle of Ely, made
inroads on all the neighbouring country<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ingul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 71. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 47.</NOTE>; The English
in the counties of Somerset and Dorset rose in arms, and
assaulted Montacute, the Norman governor; while the
inhabitants of Cornwal and Devon invested Exeter,
which, from the memory of William's clemency, still re∣mained
faithful to him<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 514.</NOTE>. Edric, the Forester, calling in
the assistance of the Welsh, laid siege to Shrewsbury,
and made head against earl Brient and Fitz-Osberne, who
commanded in those quarters<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The English, every
where, repenting of their former easy submission, seemed
<PB N="267" REF="291"/>
determined to make by concert one great effort for the re∣covery
of their liberty, and for the expulsion of their
oppressors.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, undismayed amidst this scene of confusion,
assembled his forces, and animating them with the pros∣pect
of new confiscations and forfeitures, he marched
against the insurgents in the north, whom he regarded as
the most formidable, and whose defeat, he knew, would
strike a terror into all the other rebels. Joining policy
to force, he tried, before his approach, to weaken the
enemy, by detaching the Danes from them; and he en∣gaged
Osberne, by large presents, and by offering him
the liberty of plundering the sea-coast, to retire without
committing farther hostilities into Denmark<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 451. Flor. Wig. p. 636. Chron. Abb. St. P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tri de Burgo, p. 47. Sim. Dun. p. 199.</NOTE>. Cospa∣tric,
in despair of success, imitated the example; and
making his submissions to the King, and paying a sum of
money as an atonement for his insurrection, was received
into favour, and even invested with the earldom of Nor∣thumberland.
Waltheof, who long defended York with
great courage, was allured with this appearance of cle∣mency;
and as William knew how to esteem valour even
in an enemy, that nobleman had no reason to repent of
this confidence<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 104. H. Hunt. p. 369.</NOTE>. Even Edric, compelled by necessity,
made his submissions to the Conqueror, and received for∣giveness, which was soon after followed by some degree
of trust and favour<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 453. 454. Flor. Wig. p. 636, 637. Sim. Dun. p. 203.</NOTE>. Malcolm, coming too late to sup∣port
his confederates, was constrained to retire; and all
the English insurgents in other parts, except Hereward,
who still kept in his fastnesses, dispersed themselves,
and left the Normans undisputed masters of the kingdom.

all compassion towards the people; and he scrupled no
measure, however violent or severe, which seemed re∣quisite
to support his plan of tyrannical administration.
Sensible of the restless disposition of the Northumbrians,
he determined to incapacitate them ever after from giv∣ing
him disturbance, and he issued orders for laying en∣tirely
waste that fertile country, which, for the extent
of sixty miles, lies between the Humber and the Tees<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 174. Ingulf, p. 79. Malmes. p. 103. Hove∣den, p. 451. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 47. M.

The houses were reduced to ashes by the merciless Nor∣mans, the cattle seized and driven away, the instruments
of husbandry destroyed; and the inhabitants compelled
either to seek for a subsistance in the southern parts of
Scotland, or if they lingered in England, from a reluc∣tance to abandon their antient habitations, they perished
miserably in the woods from cold and hunger. The
lives of an hundred thousand persons are computed to
have been sacrificed to this stroke of barbarous policy<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 515.</NOTE>,
which, by seeking a remedy for a temporary evil, thus
inflicted a lasting wound on the power and populousness
of the nation.</P>
<P>BUT William, finding himself entirely master of a
people, who had given him such sensible proofs of their
impotent rage and animosity, now resolved to proceed
to extremities against all the natives of England; and
to reduce them to a condition, in which they should no
<PB N="269" REF="295"/>
longer be formidable to his government. The insurrec∣tions
and conspiracies in so many parts of the kingdom
had involved the bulk of the landed proprietors, more or
kess in the guilt of treason; and the King took advan∣tage
of executing against them, with the utmost rigor,
the laws of forfeiture and attainder. Their lives were
indeed commonly spared; but their estates were con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is∣cated,
and either annexed to the royal demesnes, or con∣ferred
with the most profuse bounty on the Normans
and other foreigners<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 104.</NOTE>. While the King's declared in∣tention
was to depress or rather entirely extirpate the
English gentry<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 370.</NOTE>, it is easy to believe, that scarce a form
of justice would be attended to in these violent proceed∣ings<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">There is a paper or record of the family of Sharneborne, which pretends, that that family, which was Saxon, was restored upon prov∣ing their innocence, as well as other Saxon families, which were in the same situation.

destruction. It was crime sufficient in an Englishman
to be opulent or noble or powerful; and the policy of
the King, concurring with the rapacity of foreign ad∣venturers,
produced almost a total revolution in the land∣ed
property of the kingdom. Antient and honourable
families were reduced to beggary; the nobles themselves
<PB N="270" REF="296"/>
were every where treated with ignominy and contempt;
they had the mortification of seeing their castles and

He introduced into England the feudal law, which he
found established in France and Normandy, and which,
during that age, was the foundation both of the stability
and of the disorders in most of the monarchical govern∣ments
of Europe. He divided all the lands of England,
with very few exceptions, except the royal demesnes,
into baronies; and he conferred these, with the reserva∣tion
of stated services and payments, on the most consi∣derable
of his adventurers. These great barons, who held
immediately of the crown, shared out a great part of their
lands to other foreigners, who were denominated knights
or vassals, and who paid their lord the same duty and
submission in peace and war, which he himself owed to
his sovereign. The whole kingdom contained about
700 chief tenants, and 60,215 knights-fees<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 523. Secretum Abbatis, apud Selden, Titles of Honour, p. 573. Spellm. Gloss. in verbo <HI>Feodum.</HI> Sir Robert Cotton.</NOTE>; and as
none of the native English were admitted into the first
<PB N="271" REF="297"/>
rank, the few, who retained their landed property, were
glad to be received into the second, and under the pro∣tection
of some powerful Norman, to load themselves
and their posterity with this grievous burthen, for estates
which they had received free from their ancestors<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 225. M. Paris, p. 4. Bracton, lib. 1. cap. II. num. I. Fleta, lib. I. cap. 8. n. 2.</NOTE>. The
small mixture of English, which entered into this civil
or military fabric, (for it partook of both species) was
so restrained by subordination under the foreigners, that
the Norman dominion seemed now to be fixed on the
most durable basis, and to defy all the efforts of its ene∣mies.</P>
<P>THE better to unite the parts of the government, and
to bind them into one system, which might serve both
for defence against foreigners, and for the support of do∣mestic
tranquillity, William reduced the ecclesiastical
revenues under the same feudal law; and tho' he had
courted the church on his first invasion and accession, he
now subjected it to burthens, which the clergy regarded
as a grievous slavery, and as totally unbefitting their
profession. The bishops and abbots were obliged, when
required, to furnish to the King during war a number
of knights or military tenants, proportioned to the ex∣tent of property possessed by each see or abbey; and they
were liable, in case of failure, to the same penalties
which were exacted from the laity<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 5. Anglia Sacra, vol. I. p. 248.</NOTE>. The Pope and the
ecclesiastics exclaimed against this tyranny, as they call∣ed
it; but the King's authority was so well established
over the army, who held every thing from his bounty,
that superstition itself, even in that age, when it was
most prevalent, was conftrained to bend under his supe∣rior influence.

BUT as the great body of the clergy were still natives,
the King had much reason to dread the effects of their
resentment; and he therefore used the precaution of ex∣pelling
the English from all the considerable dignities,
and of advancing foreigners in their place. The par∣tiality
of the Consessor towards the Normans had been
so great, that aided by their superior learning, it had
promoted them to many of the sees of England; and
even before the period of the conquest, scarce more than
six or seven of the prelates were natives of the country.
But among these was Stigand, archbishop of Canter∣bury;
a man, who, by his address and vigour, by the
greatness of his family and alliances, by the extent of his
possessions, as well as by the dignity of his office, and
his authority over the English, gave great jealousy to the
King<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Parker, p. 161.</NOTE>. Tho' William had, on his accession, affronted
this prelate, by employing the archbishop of York to
officiate at his consecration, he was careful, on other
occasions, to load him with honours and caresses, and to
avoid the giving him farther offence, till the opportunity
should offer of effectuating his final destruction<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Parker, p. 164. Knyghton, p. 2344.</NOTE>. The
suppression of the late rebellions, and the total subjection
of the English, made him hope, that an attempt against
Stigand, however violent, would be covered by his great
successes, and be overlooked amidst the other important
revolutions, which affected so deeply the property and
liberty of the kingdom. Yet, notwithstanding these
mighty advantages, he did not think it safe to violate the
reverence usually paid the primate, but under cover of a
new superstition, which he was the great instrument of
introducing into England.</P>
<P>THE doctrine which exalted the papacy above all hu∣man power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Innovation in ecc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esias∣tical go∣vernment.</NOTE> had gradually diffused itself from the city
<PB N="273" REF="301"/>
and court of Rome; and was, during this age, much
more prevalent in the southern than in the northern
kingdoms of Europe. Pope Alexander, who had assisted
William in his conquest of England, reasonably ex∣pected,
that the French and Normans would import in∣to
England, the same reverence for his sacred character,
with which they were imbued in their own country;
and would break the spiritual, as well as civil indepen∣dancy
of the Saxons, who had hitherto conducted their
ecclesiastical government, with an acknowledgment in∣deed
of primacy in the see of Rome, but without much
idea of its title to dominion or authority. As soon,
therefore, as the Norman prince seemed fully established
on the throne, the Pope dispatched Ermenfroy, bishop
of Sion, as his legate into England; and this prelate
was the first, who had ever appeared with that charac∣ter
in any part of the British islands. The King, tho'
he was probably led by principle to pay this submis∣sion
to Rome, determined, as is usual, to employ the
incident as a means of serving his political purposes, and
of degrading those English prelates, who were become
obnoxious to him. The legate submitted to become the
instrument of his tyranny; and naturally thought, that
the more violent the exertion of power, the more cer∣tainly
did it confirm the authority of that court from
which he derived his commission. He summoned, there∣fore,
a council of the prelates and abbots at Winche∣ster;
and being assisted by two cardinals, Peter and
John, he cited before him Stigand, archbishop of Can∣terbury,
to answer for his conduct<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wi∣gorn. p. 636.</NOTE>.
The primate was accused of three crimes; the holding the see of Win∣chester
together with that of Canterbury; the officiating
in the pall of Robert, his predecessor; and the having
received his own pall from Benedict IX. who was af∣terwards
<PB N="274" REF="302"/>
deposed for simony, and for intrusion into the
papacy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 453. Diceto, p. 482. Knyghton, p. 2345. An∣glia Sacra, vol. i. p. 5, 6. Ypod. Neust. p. 438.</NOTE>. These crimes of Stigand were mere preten∣ces;
since the first had been a practice not unusual in
England, and was never any where subjected to a higher
penalty than a resignation of one of the sees; the se∣cond
was a pure ceremonial; and as Benedict was the
only Pope who then officiated, and his acts were never
rescinded, all the prelates of the church, especially those
who lay at a distance, were very excusable for making
their applications to him, Stigand's ruin, however, was
resolved on, and was prosecuted with great severity▪
The legate degraded him from his dignity, and the King
confiscated his estate, and cast him into prison, where
he continued, in great poverty and want, during the re∣mainder
of his life. Like rigour was exercised against
the other English prelates: Agelric, bishop of Selesey,
and Agelmare, of Elmham, were deposed by the legate,
and imprisoned by the King<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 453. M. West. p. 226. Flor. Wig. p. 636.</NOTE>. Many considerable ab∣bots
shared the same fate<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 482.</NOTE>: Egelwin, bishop of Dur∣ham,
fled the kingdom<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 452, M. West. p. 226. M. Paris, p. 5. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 249.</NOTE>: Wulstan, of Worcester, a
man of an inoffensive character, was the only English
prelate who escaped this general proscription<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Brompton relates, that Wulstan was also deprived by the synod; but refusing to deliver his pastoral staff and ring to any but the person from whom he first received it, he went immediately to King Edward's tomb, and stuck the staff so deeply into the stone, that none but him∣self was able to pull it out: Upon which he was allowed to keep his bishopric. This instance may serve, instead of many, as a specimen of the monkish miracles. See also the Annals of Burton, p. 284.</NOTE>, and re∣mained
in possession of his dignity. Aldred, archbishop
of York, who had set the crown on William's head, had
<PB N="275" REF="303"/>
died a little before of sorrow and vexation, and had left
his malediction to that prince, on account of the breach
of his coronation-oath, and of the extreme tyranny,
with which he saw he was determined to treat his Eng∣lish
subjects<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Malmes. de gest. Pont. p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was a fixed maxim in this reign, as well as in
some of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bsequent, that no native of the island
should ever be advanced to any dignity, ecclesiastical,
civil, or military<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 70, 71.</NOTE>; and the King therefore, upon Sti∣gand's
deposition, promoted Lanfranc, a Milanese monk,
celebrated for his learning and piety, to the vacant see<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 519. Hoveden, p. 453. Flor. Wig. p. 636. Sim. Dun. p. 202. Diceto, p. 483.</NOTE>.
This prelate was very rigid in defending the prerogatives
of his station; and after a long process before the Pope,
he obliged Thomas, a Norman monk, who had been
appointed to the see of York, to acknowledge the pri∣macy
of the archbishop of Canterbury<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 175, 176. Ingulf, p. 92. M. Paris, p. 6. Diceto, p. 484. Brompton, p. 970, 971, 972. Spelm. Conc. vol. ii. p. 5.</NOTE>. Where am∣bition
can be so happy as to cover its attempts, even to
the person himself, under the appearance of principle, it
is the most incurable and inflexible of all human pas∣sions.
Hence Lanfranc's zeal to promote the interests of
the papacy, by which he himself augmented his own au∣thority, was indefatigable<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Selden in Fleta, cap. 6.</NOTE>; and met with proportion∣able
success. The devoted attachment to Rome conti∣nually
increased in England; and being favoured by the
sentiments of the conquerors, as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>well as by the monas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic
establishments formerly introduced by Edred, and
settled by Edgar, it soon reached the same height, at
which, during some time, it had stood in France and
<PB N="276" REF="304"/>
Italy<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 228. Lanfranc wrote in defence of the real presence against Berengarius; and in those ages of stupidity and ignorance, he was greatly applauded for that performance.</NOTE>. It afterwards went much farther; being fa∣voured
by that very remote situation, which had at first
obstructed its progress; and being less checked by know∣ledge
and a liberal education, which were still some∣what
more common in the southern countries.</P>
<P>THE prevalence of this superstitious spirit became very
dangerous to some of William's successors, and very in∣commodious
to most of them; but the arbitrary power
of this King over the English, and his extensive au∣thority
over the foreigners, kept him from feeling any
present inconveniencies from it. He retained the church
in great subjection, as well as his lay subjects; and would
allow none, of whatever character, to dispute his sove∣reign
will and pleasure. He prohibited his subjects to
acknowledge any one for Pope whom he himself had not
previously received: He required, that all the ecclesias∣tical
canons, voted in any synod, should first be laid be∣fore
him, and he ratified by his authority: Even bulls or
letters from Rome, before they were produced, must re∣ceive
the same sanction: And none of his ministers or
barons, whatever offences they were guilty of, must be
subjected to spiritual censures, till he himself had given
his consent to their excommunication<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 6.</NOTE>. These regula∣tions
were worthy of a sovereign, and kept united the
civil and ecclesiastical powers, which the principles in∣troduced
by this prince had an immediate tendency to separate.</P>
<P>BUT the English had the cruel mortification to find,
that their King's authority, however acquired or how∣ever
extended, was all employed to their oppression; and
that the scheme of their subjection, attended with every
<PB N="277" REF="305"/>
circumstance of insult and indignity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 523. H. Hunt. p. 370.</NOTE>, was deliberately
formed by the prince, and wantonly prosecutcd by his
followers<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ingulf. p. 71.</NOTE>. William had even entertained the difficult
project of totally abolishing the English language; and,
for that purpose, he ordered, that in all the schools
throughout the kingdom, the youth should be instructed
in the French tongue, a practice which was continued
from custom till after the reign of Edward III. and was
never indeed totally discontinued in England. The
pleadings in the supreme courts of judicature were in
French<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">36 Edw. III. cap. 15. Selden Spicileg. ad Eadmer, p. 189. For∣tescue de laud. leg. Angl. cap. 48.</NOTE>: The deeds were often drawn in the same lan∣guage:
The laws were composed in that idiom<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 71, 88. Chron. Rothom. A. D. 1066.</NOTE>: No
other tongue was used at court: It became the language
of all fashionable societies; and the English themselves,
ashamed of their own country, affected to excel in that
foreign dialect. From this attention of William, and
from the great foreign dominions, long annexed to the
crown of England, proceeded that great mixture of
French, which is at present to be found in the English
tongue, and which composes the greatest and best part
of our language. But amidst these endeavours to depress
the English nation, the King, moved by the remon∣strances
of some of his prelates, and by the earnest de∣sires
of the people, restored a few of the laws of King
Edward<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 88. Brompton, p. 982. Knyghton, p. 2355. Hove∣den, p. 600.</NOTE>; which, tho' seemingly of no great conse∣quence
towards the protection of general liberty, gave
them extreme satisfaction, as a memorial of their antient
<PB N="278" REF="306"/>
government, and an unusual mark of complaisance in
their imperious conquerors<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">What these laws were of Edward the Confessor, which the English, every reign during a century and a half, desire so passionately to have re∣stored, is much disputed by antiquarians, and our ignorance of them seems one of the greatest defects in the antient English history. The collection of laws in Wilkins, which pass under the name of Edward, are plainly a posterior and an ignorant compilation. Those to be found in Ingulf are genuine; but so imperfect, and contain so few clauses sa∣vourable to the subject, that we see no great reason for contending for them so vehemently. It is probable, that the English meant the <HI>com∣mon law,</HI> as it prevailed during the reign of Edward; which we may conjecture to have been more indulgent to liberty than the Norman in∣stitutions. The most material articles of it were comprehended in Magna Charta.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE situation of the two great earls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1971.</NOTE> Morcar and
Edwin, became now very disagreeable. Tho' they had
retained their allegiance, during the general insurrec∣tion
of their countrymen, they had not gained the King's
confidence, and they found themselves exposed to the
malignity of the courtiers, who envied them on account
of their opulence and greatness, and at the same time
involved them in that general contempt which they
bore the English. Sensible that they had entirely lost
their dignity, and could not even hope to remain long in
safety; they determined, tho' too late, to run the same
hazard with their countrymen<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dun. p. 203. Brompton, p. 969. Knyghton, p. 2347.</NOTE>; and while Edwin re∣tired
to his estate in the north, with a view of com∣mencing
an insurrection, Morcar took shelter in the Isle
of Ely with the brave Hereward, who, secured by the
inaccessible situation of that place, still defended himself
against the Normans<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 454. Alur. Beverl. p. 131.</NOTE>. But this attempt served only to
accelerate the ruin of the few English, who had hitherto
been able to preserve their rank or fortune during the
past convulsions, William employed all his endeavours
<PB N="279" REF="307"/>
to subdue the Isle of Ely; and having surrounded it with
flat-bottomed boats, and made a causeway thro' the mo∣rasses
for the extent of two miles, he obliged the rebels
to surrender at discretion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 181. Hoveden, p. 454. M. West. p. 227. Flor. Wig. p. 637. M. Paris, p. 5. Sim. Dun. p. 203. Alur. Beverl. p. 131.</NOTE>. Hereward alone forced
his way, sword in hand, thro' the enemy; and still conti∣nued
his hostilities by sea against the Normans, till at
last William, charmed with his bravery, received him
into favour, and restored him to his estate. Earl Mor∣car,
and Egelwin, bishop of Durham, who had joined
the malecontents, were thrown into prison, and the lat∣ter
soon after died in confinement<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wig. p. 637. Sim. Dun. p. 203.</NOTE>. Edwin, attempt∣ing
to make his escape into Scotland, was betrayed by
some of his followers; and was killed by a party of Nor∣mans,
to the great affliction of the English, and even to
that of William, who paid a tribute of generous tears to
the memory of this gallant and beautiful youth<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 521. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 48.</NOTE>. The
King of Scotland, in hopes of profiting by these con∣vulsions,
had fallen upon the northern counties; but on
the approach of William, he retired; and when the
King entered his country, he was glad to make peace,
and to pay the usual homage to the English crown<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 160. Hoveden, p. 454. M. West. p. 227. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 48. M. Paris, p. 5.</NOTE>.
To compleat the King's prosperity, Edgar Atheling
himself, despairing of success, and weary of a fugitive
life, submitted to his enemy; and receiving a handsome
allowance, was permitted to live in England unmolested<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 160. Maimes. p. 103. Hoveden, p. 452. Flor. Wig. p. 638. M. Paris, p. 5.</NOTE>.
But these acts of generosity towards the leaders were dis∣graced,
as usual, by William's rigour against the infe∣rior
malecontents. He ordered the hands to be lopt off,
<PB N="280" REF="308"/>
and the eyes to be put out, of many of the prisoners,
whom he had taken in the Isle of Ely; and he sent
them in that miserable condition thro' the country, as
monuments of his severity<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 454. Sim. Dun. p. 203.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE province of Maine in France had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1073.</NOTE> by the will of
Hobert, the last count, fallen under the dominion of
William some years before his conquest of England;
but the inhabitants, dissatisfied with the Norman govern∣ment,
and instigated by Fulk, count of Anjou, who
had some pretensions to the succession, had risen in re∣bellion,
and expelled the magistrates, whom the King
had placed over them. The full settlement of England
now afforded him leisure to punish this insult on his au∣thority;
but being unwilling to remove his Norman
forces from this island, he carried over a considerable
army, composed almost entirely of English<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 182.</NOTE>, and after
joining them to some troops levied in Normandy, he en∣tered
the revolted province. The English appeared am∣bitious
of distinguishing themselves on this occasion, and
of recovering that character of valour, which had long
been national among them; but which their late easy
subjection under the Normans had somewhat degraded
and obscured. Perhaps too they hoped, by their zeal
and activity, to recover the confidence of their sove∣reign,
as their ancestors had formerly, by like means,
gained the affections of Canute; and to conquer his in∣veterate
prejudices in favour of his own countrymen.
The King's military conduct, seconded by such brave
troops, soon overcame all opposition in Maine: The in∣habitants
were obliged to submit, and the count of An∣jou
relinquished his pretensions.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="309"/>
But during these transactions<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣tion of the Norman barons.</NOTE> the government of
England was greatly disturbed; and that too by those
very foreigners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1074.</NOTE> who owed every thing to the King's
bounty, and who were the sole object of his friendship
and regard. The chieftains, who had engaged with the
duke of Normandy in the conquest of England, were en∣dowed
with the most independant spirit; and tho' they
obeyed their leader in the field, they would have regard∣ed
with disdain the richest acquisitions, had they been
required, in return, to submit, in their civil government,
to the arbitrary will of one man. But the imperious
character of William, encouraged by his absolute domi∣nion
over the English, and often impelled by the ne∣cessity
of his affairs, had prompted him to stretch his
authority over the Normans themselves, beyond what
the free genius of that victorious people could easily bear.
The discontents were become very general among those
haughty nobles; and even Roger, earl of Hereford, son
and heir of Fitz-Osberne, the King's chief favourite,
was strongly infected by them. This nobleman, in∣tending
to marry his sister to Ralph de Guader, earl of
Norfolk, had thought it his duty to inform the King of
his purpose, and to desire the royal consent; but meet∣ing
with a refusal, he proceeded nevertheless to finish
the nuptials, and assembled all his friends, and those of
Guader, to attend the solemnity<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 1. 04. Flor. Wig. p. 638. Diceto, p. 486. Bromp∣ton, p. 974.</NOTE> The two earls, dis∣gusted
with the denial of their request, and dreading
William's resentment for their disobedience, here pre∣pared
matters for a revolt; and during the gaiety of the
festival, while the company was heated with wine, they
opened the design to their guests. They inveighed against
the arbitrary conduct of the King; his tyranny towards
the English, whom they affected on this occasion to

commiserate; his imperious behaviour to his barons of
the noblest birth; and his apparent intention of reduc∣ing
the victors and the vanquished to a like ignominious
servitude<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 534. M. Paris, p. 7.</NOTE>. Amidst their complaints, the indignity of
submitting to a bastard<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">William was so little ashamed of his birth, that he assumed the ap∣pellation of bastard in some of his letters and charters. Spellm. Gloss. in verb. <HI>Bastardus.</HI> Camden in <HI>Richmondshire.</HI></NOTE> was not forgot; the certain
prospect of success in a revolt, by the assistance of the
Danes and the discontented English, was insisted on;
and the whole company, inflamed with the same senti∣ments,
and warmed by the jollity of the entertainment,
entered, by a solemn engagement, into the design of
shaking off the royal authority<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 104. H. Hunt. p. 369. Hoveden, p. 456.</NOTE> Even earl Waltheof,
who was present, inconsiderately expressed his approba∣tion
of the conspiracy, and promised his concurrence
towards its success<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo. p. 49. Diceto, p. 486.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS nobleman, the last of the English, who, for
some generations, possessed any power or authority, had,
after his capitulation at York, being received into fa∣vour
by the Conqueror, had even married Judith, niece
to that prince, and had been promoted to the earldoms
of Huntington and Northampton<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 522. Hovedon, p. 454.</NOTE> Cospatric, earl of
Northum∣berland, having, on some new disgust from
William, retired into Scotland, where he received the
earldom of Dunbar from the bounty of Malcolm;
Waltheof was appointed his successor in that important com∣mand,
and seemed still to possess the confidence and
friendship of his sovereign<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dun. p. 205.</NOTE> But as he was a man of
generous principles, and loved his country, it is probable,
that the tyranny exercised over the English lay heavy
<PB N="283" REF="313"/>
upon his mind, and destroyed all the satisfaction which
he could reap from his own grandeur and advancement.
When a prospect, therefore, was opened of retrieving
their liberty, he hastily embraced it; while the fumes of
the liquor, and the ardour of the company, prevented
him from reflecting on the consequences of that rash at∣tempt.
But after his cool judgment returned, he fore∣saw,
that the conspiracy of these discontented barons
was not likely to prove successful against the established
power of William; or if it did, that the slavery of the
English, instead of being alleviated by that event, would
become more grievous, under a multitude of foreign
leaders, factious and ambitious, whose union or discord
would be equally oppressive to the people. Tormented
with these reflections, he opened his mind to his wife,
Judith, of whose fidelity he entertained no suspicion,
but who, having secretly fixed her affections on an∣other,
took this opportunity of ruining her easy and cre∣dulous
husband. She conveyed intelligence of the con∣spiracy
to the King, and aggravated every circumstance,
which, the believed, would tend to enrage him against
Waltheof, and render him absolutely implacable<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital, p. 536.</NOTE>
Meanwhile, the Earl, still unsatisfied with regard to

that he owed no fidelity to those rebellious barons,

his first duty was to his sovereign and benefactor, his
next to himself and his family; and that if he seized
not the opportunity of making atonement for his guilt,
by revealing it, the temerity of the conspirators was so
great, that they would give some other person the means

by these arguments, went over to Normandy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 105. Hoveden, p. 456. Flor Wig. p. 638.</NOTE>;

all the merit of her husband's repentance.</P>
<P>THE conspirators, hearing of Waltheof's departure,
immediately concluded their designs to be betrayed; and
they flew to arms, before their schemes were ripe for
execution, and before the arrival of the Danes, in whose
aid they placed their chief confidence. The earl of He∣reford
was checked by Walter de Lacy, a great baron
in those parts, who, supported by the bishop of Worce∣ster

THE King, who hastened over to England, in order
to suppress the insurrection, found, that nothing remain∣ed
but the punishment of the criminals, which he exe∣cuted
with great severity. Many of the rebels were
hanged; some had their eyes put out; others their hands

But William, agreeable to his usual maxims,
showed more lenity to the leader, the earl of Hereford,
who was only condemned to a forfeiture of his estate,
and to imprisonment during the King's pleasure. The King
seemed even disposed to remit this last part of the punish∣ment;
had not Roger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1075.</NOTE> by a fresh insolence, provoked

being an Englishman, was not treated with so

instigated by his niece, as well as by his rapacious

<P>NOTHING remained to complete William's satisfaction

Ralph was so well defended, both by the earl of

the enterprise, and make with those powerful prin∣ces
a peace, in which Ralph himself was included<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 183. Chron. de Mailr. p. 160. H. Hunt. p. 369. Hoveden, p. 457. M. Paris, p. 7.</NOTE>
England, during his absence, remained in tranquility;
and nothing remarkable occurred, except two ecclesias∣tical
synods, which were summoned, one at London,
another at Winchester. In the former, the precedency
among the episcopal sees was settled, and the seat of
some of them was removed from small villages to the
most considerable town within the diocese<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 93. Brompton, p. 575.</NOTE>. In the se∣cond
was transacted a business of some more impor∣tance.</P>
<P>THE industry and perseverance are surprising,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1076.</NOTE> with
which the Popes had been treasuring up powers and pre∣tensions
during so many ages of ignorance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dispute about in∣vestitures.</NOTE> while each
pontiff employed every fraud for advancing purposes of
imaginary piety, and cherished all claims which might
turn to the advantage of his successors, tho' he himself
could not expect ever to reap any benefit from them.
All this immense store of spiritual and civil authority was
now devolved on Gregory VII. of the name of Hilde∣brand,
the most enterprizing pontiff who had ever filled
that chair, and the least restrained by fear, decency, or
moderation. Not contented with shaking off the yoke
of the Emperors, who had hitherto exercised the power
of appointing the Pope on every vacancy, or at least of
ratifying his election; he undertook the arduous task of
disjoining entirely the ecclesiastical from the civil power,
and of excluding profane laymen from the right which
they had assumed, of filling the vacancies of bishoprics,
<PB N="287" REF="317"/>
abbies, and other spiritual dignities<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">L'Abbe Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, tom, 10. p. 371, 372. con. 2.</NOTE>. The sovereigns,
who had long exercised this power, and who had attained
it, not by encroachments on the church, but on the
people, to whom it originally belonged<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo sopra benef. eccles. p. 30.</NOTE>, made great op∣position
to this claim of the court of Rome; and Hen∣ry
IV. the present Emperor, defended the prerogative
of his crown with a vigour and resolution suitable to its
importance. The few offices, either civil or military,
which the feudal institutions left the sovereign the power
of bestowing, made the prerogative of conferring the
pastoral ring and staff the most invaluable jewel of the
royal diadem; especially as the general ignorance of the age
bellowed a weight on the ecclesiastical offices, even
beyond the great extent of power and property which be∣longed to them. Superstition, the child of ignorance,
invested the clergy with an authority almost sacred; and
as they possessed the little learning of the age, their inter∣position
became requisite in all civil business, and a real
usefulness in common life was thus superadded to the spi∣ritual
sanctity of their character.</P>
<P>WHEN the usurpations, therefore, of the church had
come to such a maturity as to embolden her to attempt
extorting the right of investitures from the temporal
power, Europe, especially Italy and Germany, was thrown
into the most violent convulsions, and the Pope and Em∣peror
waged implacable war against each other. Grego∣ry
even dared to fulminate the sentence of excommuni∣cation
against Henry and his adherents, to pronounce
him rightfully deposed, to free his subjects from their
oaths of allegiance; and, instead of shocking mankind
with this gross incroachment on the civil authority, he
found the stupid people ready to second his most exorbi∣tant
pretensions. Every minister, servant, or vassal of
<PB N="288" REF="318"/>
the Emperor, who received any disgust, covered his re∣bellion
under the pretence of principle; and even the
mother of this monarch, forgetting all the ties of na∣ture,
was seduced to countenance the insolence of his
enemies. Princes themselves, unattentive to the perni∣cious
consequences of these papal claims, employed them
for their present purposes; and the controversy, spread∣ing
into every city of Italy, engendered the parties of
Guelf and Ghibbelin; the most durable and inveterate
factions that ever arose from the mixture of ambition and
superstition. Besides numberless assassinations, tumults,
and convulsions, to which they gave rise, it is computed
that the quarrel occasioned no less than sixty battles in
the reign of Henry IV. and eighteen in that of his suc∣cessor,
Henry V. when the claims of the sovereign pon∣tiff
finally prevailed<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo sopra benef. eccles. p. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the bold spirit of Gregory, not dismayed with
the vigorous opposition, which he met with from the Em∣peror,
extended his usurpations all over Europe; and well
knowing the nature of mankind, whose astonishment
ever inclines them to yield to the most impudent preten∣sions,
he seemed determined to set no bounds to the spi∣ritual,
or rather temporal monarchy, which he had
undertaken to erect. He pronounced the sentence of ex∣communication
against Nicephorus, Emperor of the East:
Robert Guiscard, the adventurous Norman, who had
acquired the dominion of Naples, was attacked by the
same dangerous weapon: He degraded Boleslas, King
of Poland, from the rank of King; and even deprived
Poland of the title of a kingdom: He attempted to treat
Philip, King of France, with the same rigour, which
he had employed against the Emperor<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Epist. Greg. XII. epist. 32. 35. lib, 2. epist. 5.</NOTE>: He pretended to
the entire property and dominion of Spain; and he shar∣ed

it from the Saracens, and to hold it in vassalage of
the see of Rome<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Epist, Greg. VII. lib. 1. epist. 7.</NOTE>: Even the Christian bishops, on whose
aid he relied in subduing the temporal princes, saw that
he was determined to reduce them to servitude; and by
assuming the whole legislative and judicial power of the
church, to concenter all authority in the sovereign
pontiff<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Greg. Epist. lib. 2. epist. 55.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WILLIAM the Conqueror, the most potent, the most
haughty, and the most vigorous prince In Europe, was
not, amidst all his splendid successes, secured from the
attacks of this enterprizing prelate. Gregory wrote him
a letter, requiring him to fulfil his promise in doing ho∣mage
for the kingdom of England to the see of Rome,
and to send him over that tribute, which all his predeces∣sors
had been accustomed to pay to the vicar of Christ.
By the tribute, he meant Peter's pence; which, tho' at
first a charitable donation of the Saxon princes, was in∣terpreted,
according to the usual practice of the Romish
court, to be a badge of subjection acknowledged by the
kingdom. William replied, that the money should be
remitted as usual; but that he neither had promised to do
homage to Rome, nor was it in the least his purpose to
impose that servitude on his state<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Spileg. Seldeni ad <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>admer, p. 164.</NOTE> And the better to
show Gregory his independance, he refused, notwith∣standing
the frequent complaints of the Pope, the Eng∣lish
bishops liberty to attend a general council, which
that pontiff had summoned against his enemies.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the King showed this vigour in supporting
the royal dignity, he was infected with the general super∣stition
of the age, and he did not discover the ambitious
scope of those institution, which, under the cover of
strictness in religion, were introduced or promoted by
<PB N="290" REF="320"/>
the Roman pontiff. Gregory, while he was throwing all
Europe into combustion by his violence and impostures,
affected an anxious care for the purity of manners;
and even the chaste pleasures of the marriage-bed were
inconsistent, in his opinion, with the sanctity of the sacer∣dotal
character. He had issued a decree prohibiting the mar∣riage
of priests, excommunicating all clergymen who re∣tained
their wives, declaring all such unlawful commerce to
be fornication, and rendering it criminal in the laity to at∣tend
divine worship when such profane priests officiated at
the altar<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 455. 457 Flor. Wigorn. p. 638. Spell. Concil. fol. 13. A. D. 1076.</NOTE>. This point was a great object in the politics of
the Romish court; and it cost them infinitely more pains to
establish it than the propagation of any speculative absurdi∣ty,
which they had ever attempted to introduce. Many sy∣nods
were summoned in different parts of Europe, before
it was finally fettled; and it was there constantly remark∣ed,
that the younger clergymen complied chearfully with
the Pope's decrees in this particular, and that the chief
reluctance appeared in those who were more advanced in
years: An event so little conformable to men's first ex∣pectations,
that it could not fail to be glossed on, even
in that blind and superstitious age. William allowed the
Pope's legate to assemble, in his absence, a synod at
Winchester, in order to settle the celibacy of the clergy;
but the church of England could not yet be carried the
whole length expected; and the synod was content with
decreeing, that the bishops should not thenceforth ordain
any priests or deacons without exacting from them a
promise of celibacy; but that none, except those who
belonged to collegiate or cathedral churches, should be
obliged to separate from their wives.</P>
<P>THE King passed some years in Normandy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of prince Ro∣bert.</NOTE> but his
long residence there was not entirely owing to his declar∣ed.
<PB N="291" REF="321"/>
preference of that dutchy: His presence was also
necessary for composing those disturbances, which had
arisen in that favourite territory, and which had even
originally proceeded from his own family. Robert, his
eldest son, sirnamed Gambaron or Courthose, from his
short legs, was a prince, who inherited all the bravery
of his family and nation; but without that policy and
dissimulation, by which his father was so much distin∣guished;
and which, no less than his military valour,
had contributed to his great successes. Greedy of fame,
impatient of contradiction, without reserve in his friend∣ships,
declared in his enmities, this prince could endure
no controul even from his imperious father, and openly
aspired to that independance, to which his temper, as
well as some circumstances in his situation, strongly in∣vited
him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 545. Hoveden, p. 457. Flor. Wigorn. p. 639.</NOTE>. When William first received the submissions
of the province of Maine, he had promised the inhabi∣tants
that Robert should be their prince; and before he
undertook the expedition against England, he had, on
the application of the French court, declared him his
successor in Normandy, and had obliged the barons of that
dutchy to do him homage as their future sovereign. By
this artifice, he had endeavoured to appease the jealousy
of his neighbours, as affording them a prospect of sepa∣rating
England from his dominions on the continent; but
when Robert demanded of him the execution of these en∣gagements,
he gave him an absolute refusal, and told
him, according to the homely saying, that he never in∣tended
to throw off his cloaths, till he went to bed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 160.</NOTE>.
Robert openly declared his discontent; and was sus∣pected
of secretly instigating the King of France and the
earl of Brittanny to the opposition which they made to
William, and which had formerly frustrated his attempts
<PB N="292" REF="322"/>
upon the town of Dol. And as the quarrel still aug∣mented,
Robert proceeded to entertain a strong jealousy
of his two surviving brothers, William and Henry, (for
Richard was killed in hunting by a stag) who, by greater
submission and complaisance, had acquired the affections
of their father. In this disposition, the greatest trifle suf∣ficed
to produce a rupture between them.</P>
<P>THE three princes, residing with their father in the
castle of l'Aigle in Normandy, were one day engaged in
sport together; and after much frolic, the two younger
took it in their head to throw over some water on Robert
as he passed thro' the court on leaving their apartment<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 545.</NOTE>;
a pastime, which he would naturally have regarded as in∣nocent,
had it not been for the suggestions of Alberic de
Grentmesnil, son of that Hugh de Grentmesnil, whom
William had formerly deprived of his fortunes, when
that baron deserted him during his greatest difficult∣ties
in England. This young nobleman, mindful of
the injury, persuaded the prince, that this action was
meant as a public affront, which it behoved him in ho∣nour
to refent; and the choleric Robert, drawing his
sword, ran up stairs, with an intention of taking revenge
on his brothers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The whole castle was full of tumult,
which the King himself, who hastened from his apart∣ment,
found some difficulty to appease. But he could by
no means appease the resentment of his eldest son, who,
complaining of his partiality, and fancying that no pro∣per
atonement had been made him for the insult, left the
court that very evening, and hastened to Roüen, with an
intention of seizing the citadel of that place<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But being
disappointed in this view by the precaution and vigilance
of Roger de Ivery, the governor, he fled to Hugh de
Neufchatel, a powerful Norman baron, who gave him
protection in his castles; and he openly levied war against
<PB N="293" REF="323"/>
his father<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 545. Hoveden, p. 457. Sim. Dun. p. 210. Diceto, p. 487.</NOTE>. The popular character of the prince, and
a sympathy of manners, engaged all the young nobility
of Normandy and Maine, as well as of Anjou and Brit∣tanny,
to take part with him; and it was suspectced, that
Matilda, his mother, whose favourite he was, supported
him in his rebellion by secret remittances of money, and
by the encouragement, which she gave his partizans.</P>
<P>ALL the hereditary provinces of William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1079.</NOTE> as well as
his family, were during several years thrown into convul∣sion
by this war; and he was at last obliged to have re∣course
to England, where that species of military go∣vernment,
which he had established, gave him greater
authority than the antient feudal institutions permitted
him to exercise in Normandy. He called over an army
of English under his antient captains, who soon expelled
Robert and his adherents from their retreats, and restored
the sovereign's authority in all his dominions. The young
prince was obliged to take shelter in the castle of Ger∣beroy
in the Beauvoisis, which the King of France, who
secretly fomented all these discords, had provided for
him. In this fortress he was closely besieged by his fa∣ther,
against whom, having a strong garrison, he made
a gallant defence. There past under the walls of this
place many rencounters, which resembled more the single
combats of chivalry, than the military actions of armies;
but one of them was remarkable for its circumstances
and its event. Robert happened to encounter with the
King, who was concealed by his helmet; and both being
valiant, a fierce combat ensued, till at last the young
prince wounded his father in the arm, and threw him
from his horse. Calling for assistance, his voice disco∣vered
him to his son, who, struck with remorse for his
<PB N="294" REF="324"/>
past crime, and astonished with the apprehensions of one
much greater, which he had so nearly incurred, instant∣ly
threw himself at his father's feet, craved pardon for
his offences, and offered to purchase forgiveness by any
atonement<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 106. H. Hunt. p. 369. Hoveden, p. 457. Flor. Wig. p. 639. Sim. Dun. p. 210. Diceto, p. 487. Knyghton, p. 2351. Alur Beverl. p. 135.</NOTE>. The resentment, harboured by William,
was so inveterate, that he did not immediately correspond
to this dutiful submission of his son with like tenderness;
but giving him his malediction, departed for his own camp,
on Robert's horse, which that prince had assisted him to
mount<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 369. Hoveden, p. 457. M. Paris, p. 7. Ypod. Neu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. p. 439.</NOTE>. He soon after raised the siege, and marched
with his army to Normandy; where the interposition of
the Queen and other common friends brought about a
reconcilement, which was probably not a little forwarded
by the generosity of the son's behaviour in this action,
and by the returning sense of his past miscondutct. The
King seemed so fully appeased, that he even carried over
Robert with him into England; where he intrusted him
to repel an inroad of Malcolm King of Scots, and to
retaliate by a like inroad into that country. The Eng∣lish
prince was successful, and obliged the enemy to
make submissions. The Welsh, unable to resist William's
power, were, about the same time, necessitated to make
satisfaction for their incursions<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 184. M. West. p. 228.</NOTE>; and every thing was
reduced to a full tranquillity in this island.</P>
<P>THIS state of affairs gave William Ieisure to begin and
finish an undertaking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1081.</NOTE> which proves his great and exten∣sive
genius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Domesday-book.</NOTE> and does honour to his memory: It was a
general survey of all the lands in the kingdom, their
extent in each district, their proprietors, tenures, value;
<PB N="295" REF="325"/>
the quantity of meadow, pasture, wood, and arable
land, which they contained; and in some counties the
number of tenants, cottagers, and slaves of all denomi∣nations,
who lived upon them. He appointed commis∣sioners
for this purpose, who entered every particular in
their register by the verdict of juries; and after a labour
of fix years (for the work was so long in finishing) brought
him an exact account of all the landed property of his
kingdom<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 190. Ingulf, p. 79. Chron. T. Tykes, p. 23. H. Hunt. p. 370. Hoveden, p. 460. M. West. p. 229. Flor. Wigorn. p. 641. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 51. M. Paris, p. 8. The three northern counties, Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Northumberland, were not comprehended in this survey; I suppose because of their wild, uncultivated situation.</NOTE>. This monument, called Domesday-book,
the most valuable piece of antiquity possessed by any
nation, is still preserved in the Exchequer; and tho' only
some extracts of it have hitherto been published, it serves
to illustrate to us in many particulars the antient state
of England. The great Alfred had finished a like sur∣vey
of the kingdom in his time, which was long kept at
Winchester, and which probably served as a model to
William in this undertaking<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King was naturally a great oeconomist; and
tho' no prince had ever been so bountiful to his officers
and servants, it was merely because he had rendered him∣self
universal proprietor of England, and had a whole
kingdom to bestow. He reserved a very ample revenue
for the crown; and in the general distribution of land
among his followers, he kept possession of no less than
1422 manors in different parts of England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">West's enquiry into the manner of creating peers, p. 24.</NOTE>, which paid
him rent either in money, or in corn, cattle, and the
usual produce of the land. An antient historian com∣putes,
that his annual fixed income, besides escheats,
<PB N="296" REF="326"/>
fines, reliefs, and other casual profits to a great value,
amounted to near 400,000 pounds a year<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital, p. 523. He says 1060 pounds and some odd shil∣lings and pence a day.</NOTE>; a sum,
which, if all circumstances he attended to, will appear
wholly incredible. A pound in that age, as we have
before observed, contained three times the weight of sil∣ver
that it does at present; and the same weight of silver,
by the most probable computation, would purchase ten
times more of the necessaries of life, tho' not in the same
proportion of the finer manufactures. This revenue,
therefore, of William would be equivalent to at least
nine or ten millions at present; and as that prince had
neither fleet nor army to support, the former being only
a casual expence, and the latter maintained, without any
charge to him, by his military vassals, we must thence
conclude, that no emperor or prince, in any age or na∣tion,
was ever to be compared to the Conqueror in opu∣lence
and riches. This leads us to suspect a great mistake
in the computation of the historian; tho', if we consider
that avarice is always imputed to William as one of his
vices<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 188. 191. Malmes. p. 112. H. Hunt. p. 370. M. West. p. 229. Brompton, p. 979.</NOTE>, and that having by the sword rendered himself
master of all the lands in the kingdom, he would cer∣tainly
in the partition retain a great proportion for his own
share; we can scarce be guilty of any error in asserting,
that no King of England was ever so opulent, was so
able to support by his revenue the splendor and magnifi∣cence
of a court, or could bestow so much on his plea∣sures
or in liberalities to his servants and favourites<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fortescue, de Dom. reg. &amp; politic. cap. 111.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was one pleasure, to which William, as well as
all the Normans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new forest.</NOTE> and antient Saxons, was extremely addict∣ed;
and that was hunting: But this pleasure he indulged
more at the expence of his unhappy subjects, whose interests
<PB N="297" REF="327"/>
he always disregarded, than to the loss or diminution of
his own revenue. Not contented with those large forests,
which the former Kings possessed in all parts of England;
he resolved to make a new forest near Winchester, the
usuual place of his residence: And for that purpose, he
laid waste the country in Hampshire for an extent of
thirty miles, expelled the inhabitants from their houses,
seized their property, even demolished churches and con∣vents,
and made the sufferers no compensation for the
injury<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 3. H. Hunt. p. 731. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 258.</NOTE>. At the same time, he enacted new laws, by
which he prohibited all his subjects from hunting in any
of his forests, and rendered the penalties much more se∣vere
than ever had been inflicted for such offences. The
killing of a deer or boar, or even of a hare, was punish∣ed
with the loss of the delinquent's eyes<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 191. H. Hunt. p. 371. M. West. p. 229. Diceto, p. 488. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 258.</NOTE>; and that at a
time, when the killing of a man could be atoned for by
paying a moderate fine or composition.</P>
<P>THE transactions, recorded during the remainder of
this reign, may be considered more as domestic occurren∣ces,
which concern the prince, than as national events,
which regard England. Odo, bishop of Baieux, the
King's uterine brother, whom he had created earl of
Kent, and whom he had entrusted with a great share of
power during his whole reign<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Order, Vital. p. 522. Frag. de Gul. Conq. p. 29.</NOTE>, had amassed immense
riches; and agreeable to the usual progress of human
wishes, he began to regard his present acquisitions but as
a step to farther grandeur. He had formed the chimerical
project of buying the papacy; and tho' Gregory, the
present Pope, was not of very advanced years, the prelate
had confided so much in the predictions of an astrologer,
that he made certain account of the pontiff's death, and
<PB N="298" REF="328"/>
of attaining, by his intrigues and money, that envied state
of greatness<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 646. Frag. de Gul. Conq. p. 29.</NOTE>. He resolved, therefore, to transmit all
his riches to Italy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1082.</NOTE> and had persuaded many confiderable
barons, and, among the rest, Hugh earl of Chester, to
take the same course; in hopes, that when he should
mount the papal throne, he would bestow on them more
considerable establishments in that country<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The King,
from whom all these projects had been carefully concealed,
at last got intelligence of the design, and ordered Odo
to be arrested. His officers, respecting the immunities,
to which the ecclesiastics now pretended, scrupled to exe∣cute
the command, till the King himself was obliged in
person to seize him; and when Odo insisted that he was
a prelate, and exempt from all temporal jurisdiction,
William replied, that he arrested him, not as bishop of
Baieux, but as earl of Kent<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Abb. Sr. Petri de Burgo, p. 51. W. Malmes. p. 120.</NOTE>. He was sent prisoner
into Normandy; and notwithstanding all the remon∣strances
and menaces of Gregory, was detained in custo∣dy
during the remainder of this reign<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 647. H. Hunt. p. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER domestic event gave the King much more
concern:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1083.</NOTE> It was the death of Matilda, his consort, whom
he tenderly loved, and for whom he had ever preserved
the most sincere friendship. Three years afterwards, he
passed into Normandy, and carried with him Edgar
Atheling, to whom he very willingly granted per∣mission
to make a pilgrimage into the holy land<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 103.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1087.</NOTE>
He was detained on the continent by a misunderstand∣ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1087</NOTE>
which broke out between him and the King of
France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> and which was occasioned by inroads made
<PB N="299" REF="329"/>
into Normandy by some French barons on the frontiers<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 654, 655.</NOTE>.
It was little in the power of princes at that time to
restrain their licentious nobility; but William suspected,
that these barons dared not to have provoked his indigna∣tion,
had they not been assured of the countenance and
protection of Philip. His displeasure was increased by
the account he received of some railleries which that mo∣narch
had thrown out against him. William, who was
become corpulent, had been detained in bed some time
by sickness; upon which Philip expressed his surprise
that his brother of England should be so long in being
delivered of his great belly. The King sent him word, that,
as soon as he was up, he would present so many lights at
Notre-dame, as would perhaps give l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le pleasure to the
King of France; alluding to the usual practice at that
time of women after child-birth<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 112. M. West. p. 230. M. Paris, p. 9. Brompton, p. 980. Knyghton, p. 2353. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 262.</NOTE>. Immediately on his
recovery, he led an army into the L'Isle de France, and
laid every thing waste with fire and sword: He took the
town of Mante, which he reduced to ashes<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 655, Chron. de Mailr. p. 161.</NOTE>. But the
progress of these hostilities was stopt by an accident,
which soon after put an end to William's life. His horse
starting aside of a sudden, he bruised his belly on the
pommel of his saddle<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 112. M. Paris, p. 10. Knyghton, p. 2353.</NOTE>; and being in a bad habit of
body, as well as somewhat advanced in years, he began
to apprehend the consequences, and ordered himself to
be carried in a litter to the monastery of St. Gervais.
Finding his illness increase, and being sensible of the ap∣proach
of death, he discovered at last the vanity of all
human grandeur, and was struck with remorse for those
horrible cruelties and violences, which, for the attain∣ment
<PB N="300" REF="330"/>
and defence of it, he had committed during the
course of his reign over England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Frag. de Gul. Conq. p. 29, 30, 31.</NOTE>. He endeavoured to
make compensation by presents to churches and monaste∣ries;
and he issued orders for the liberty of earl Morcar,
Siward Bearne, and other English prisoners<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 161. Hoveden, p. 460. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 52. Diceto, p. 488.</NOTE>. He was
even prevailed on, tho' not without reluctance, to con∣sent,
with his dying breath, to the deliverance of his
brother, Odo, against whom he was extremely incensed.
He left Normandy and Maine to his eldest son, Robert:
He wrote to Lanfranc, defiring him to crown William
King of England<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. p. 292. Order. Vital. p. 659. Chron. de Mai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. p. 161. Malmes. p. 112. H. Hunt. p. 371. Hoveden, p. 460. M. West. p. 230.</NOTE>: He bequeathed to Henry nothing
but the possessions of his mother, Matilda; but foretold,
that he would one day surpass both his brothers in power
and opulence<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital, p. 659. Gul. Neubr. p. 357. Fragm. de Gul. Conq. p. 32.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Sept.</NOTE>. He expired in the sixty-third year of
his age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death and character of William the conqueror.</NOTE> in the twenty-first of his reign over England,
and in the fifty-fourth of that over Normandy.</P>
<P>FEW princes have been more fortunate than this great
monarch, or were better entitled to grandeur and prospe∣rity
from the abilities and the vigour of mind which he
displayed in all his conduct. His spirit was bold and en∣terprising,
yet guided by prudence: His ambition, which
was exorbitant, and lay little under the restraints of jus∣tice,
and still less under those of humanity, ever submit∣ted
to the dictates of reason and sound policy. Born in
an age when the minds of men were intractable and un∣acquainted
with submission, he was yet able to direct
them to his purposes; and partly from the ascendant of
his vehement character, partly from art and dissimulation,
<PB N="301" REF="331"/>
to establish an unlimited authority. Tho' not insensible
to generosity, he was hardened against compassion; and
be seemed equally ostentatious and ambitious of eclat in
his clemency and in his severity. The maxims of his
administration were austere; but might have been useful,
had they been solely employed in preserving order in an
established government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. West. p. 230. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 258.</NOTE>: They were ill calculated for
softening the rigours, which, under the most gentle ma∣nagement,
are inseparable from conquest. His attempt
against England was the last great enterprize of the
kind, which, during the course of seven hundred years,
has fully succeeded in Europe; and the greatness of his
genius broke thro' those limits, which first the feudal in∣stitutions,
then the refined policy of princes, have fixed
to the several states of Christendom. Tho' he rendered
himself infinitely odious to his English subjects, he trans∣mitted
his power to his posterity, and the throne is still
filled by his descendants: A proof, that the foundations
which he laid were firm and solid, and that, amidst all
his violences, while he seemed only to gratify the present
passion, he had still an eye towards futurity.</P>
<P>SOME writers have been desirous of refusing to this
prince the title of Conqueror, in the sense in which it
is commonly understood; and on pretence, that the word
is sometimes in old books applied to such as make an ac∣quisition
of territory by any means, they are willing to
reject William's title, by right of war, to the crown of
England. It is needless to enter into a controversy,
which, by the terms of it, must necessarily degenerate
into a dispute of words. It suffices to say, that the duke
of Normandy's first invasion of the island was hostile;
that his subsequent administration was entirely supported
by arms; that in the very frame of his laws he made a
distinction between the Normans and English, to the ad∣vantage
<PB N="302" REF="332"/>
of the former<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 600.</NOTE>; that he acted in every thing as
absolute master over the natives, whose interests▪ and af∣fections
he totally disregarded; and that if there was an
internal when he assumed the appearance of a legal ma∣gistrate,
the period was very short, and was nothing but
a temporary sacrifice, which he, as has been the case
with most conquerors, was obliged to make of his incli∣nation
to his present policy. Scarce any of those revo∣lutions,
which, both in history and in common language,
have always been denominated conquests, appear equally
violent, or have been attended with so sudden an altera∣tion
both of power and property. The Roman state,
which spread its dominion over Europe, left the rights of
individuals, in a great measure, untouched; and those
civilized conquerors, while they made their own coun∣try
the seat of empire, found, that they could draw most
advantage from the subject provinces, by bestowing on
the natives the free enjoyment of their own laws and of
their private possessions. The barbarians, who subdued
the Roman empire, tho' they settled in the conquered
countries, yet being accustomed to a rude uncultivated
life, found a small part of the land sufficient to supply all
their wants; and they were not tempted to seize exten∣sive
possessions, which they neither knew how to culti∣vate
nor employ. But the Normans and other foreigners,
who followed the standard of William, while they made
the vanquished kingdom the seat of empire, were yet so
far advanced in arts as to be acquainted with the advan∣tages
of a large property; and having totally subdued
the natives, they pushed the rights of conquest (very
extensive in the eyes of avarice and ambition, however
narrow in those of reason) to the utmost extremity against
them. Except the former conquest of England by the
Saxons themselves, who were induced, by peculiar cir∣cumstances,
<PB N="303" REF="333"/>
to proceed even to the extermination of the
natives, it would be difficult to find in all history a revo∣lution
more destructive, or attended with a more com∣plete
subjection of the antient inhabitants. Contumely
seems even to have been wantonly added to oppression<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 370. Brompton, p. 980.</NOTE>;
and the natives were universally reduced to such a state of
meanness and poverty, that the English name became a
term of reproach, and several generations elapsed before
one family of Saxon pedigree was raised to any consider∣able
honours, or could so much as attain the rank of
barons of the realm<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">So late as the reign of King Stephen, the earl of Albemarle, be∣fore the battle of the Standard, addressed the officers of his army in these terms: <HI>Procers Angliae clarissimi, &amp; genere Normanni, &amp;c.</HI> Brompton, p. 10<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. See farther Abbas Rieval. p. 339, &amp;c. All the barons and military men of England still called themselves Normans.</NOTE>. These facts are so apparent from the
whole tenor of the English history, that none would have
been tempted to deny or elude them, were they not heated
by the controversies of faction; while one party were
<HI>absurdly</HI> afraid of those <HI>absurd</HI> consequences, which they
saw the other party inclined to draw from this event.
But it is evident, that the present rights and privileges of

<P>WILLIAM,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1086.</NOTE> sirnamed <HI>Rufus</HI> or the <HI>Red,</HI> from
the colour of his hair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accession of William Rufus.</NOTE> had no sooner pro∣cured
his father's recommendatory letter to Lanfranc, the
primate, than he hastened to take measures for securing
to himself the government of England. Sensible, that a
deed so unformal, and so little prepared, which violated
Robert's right of primogeniture, might meet with great
opposition, he trusted entirely for success to his own cele∣rity
and dispatch; and having left St. Gervais, while
William was breathing his last, he arrived in England,
before intelligence of his father's death had reached that
kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 120. M. Paris, p. 10.</NOTE>. Pretending orders from the King, he secu∣red
the fortresses of Dover, Pevensey, and Hastings,
whose situation rendered them of the greatest importance;
and he got possession of his father's treasure at Win∣chester,
amounting to the sum of sixty thousand pounds,
by which he hoped to encrease and encourage his par∣tizans<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 192. Brompton, p. 983.</NOTE>. The primate, whose rank and reputation in
the kingdom gave him great authority, had been entrusted
<PB N="306" REF="336"/>
with the care of his education,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V.</NOTE> and had conferred on
him the honour of knighthood<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 120. M. Paris, p. 10. Thom. Rudborne, p. 263.</NOTE>; and being connected
with him by these ties, and probably deeming his preten∣sions
just, declared that he would pay a willing obedience
to the last will of the Conqueror, his friend and bene∣factor.
Having assembled some bishops and some of the
principal nobility, he instantly proceeded to the ceremony
of crowning the new King<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 461.</NOTE>; and by this dispatch pre∣vented
all danger of faction and resistance. At the same
time, Robert, who had been already acknowledged suc∣cessor
to Normandy, took peaceable possession of that dutchy.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this partition appeared to have been made<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspiracy against the King.</NOTE>
without any violence or opposition, there remained in
England many causes of discontent, which seemed to
menace that kingdom with a sudden revolution. The
Norman barons, who generally possessd large estates
both in England and in their own country, were uneasy
at the separation of these territories; and foresaw, that
as it would be impossible for them to preserve long their
allegiance to two masters, they must necessarily resign either
their antient property or their new acquisitions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Order. Vitalis, p. 666.</NOTE>. Robert's
title to the dutchy they esteemed incontestible; his claim
to the kingdom plausible; and they all desired that this
prince, who alone had any pretensions to unite these ter∣ritories,
should be put in possession of both. A compa∣rison
also of the personal qualities of these two princes,
led them to give the preference to the elder. The duke
was brave, open, sincere, generous; and even his pre∣dominant
faults, his extreme indolence and facility, were
not disagreeable to those haughty barons, who affected
independance, and submitted with reluctance to a rigorous
<PB N="307" REF="337"/>
administration in their sovereign. The King, tho' equal∣ly
brave as his brother, was violent, haughty, tyranni∣cal;
and seemed disposed to govern more by the fear
than by the love of his people<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 120. Order. Vitalis, 666.</NOTE>. Odo, bishop of Baieux,
and Robert earl of Mortaigne, maternal brothers of the
Conqueror, envying the great credit of Lanfranc, which
was encreased by his late services, enforced all these mo∣tives
with their partizans, and engaged them in a formal
conspiracy to dethrone the King<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 461. Sim. Dunelm. p. 214. Diceto, p. 489.</NOTE>. They communi∣cated
their design to Eustace, count of Bologne, Roger
earl of Shrewsbury and Arundel, Robert de Belesme, his
eldest son, William bishop of Durham, Robert de Mou∣bray,
Roger Bigod, Hugh de Grentmesnil; and they
easily procured the assent of these potent noblemen.
The conspirators, retiring to their castles, hastened to
put themselves in a military posture; and expecting to
be soon supported by a powerful army from Normandy,
they had already begun hostilities in many places<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 193. Hoveden, p. 461. M. Paris, p. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, sensible of his perilous situation, endea∣voured
to engage the affections of the native English;
and as that people were now so thoroughly subdued that
they no longer aspired to the recovery of their antient li∣berties,
and were contented with the prospect of some
mitigation in the tyranny of the Norman princes, they
zealously embraced William's cause, upon receiving some
general promises of good treatment, and of enjoying the
licence of hunting in the royal forests<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 194. W. Malmes. p. 120. H. Hunt p. 372. Hoveden, p. 461. Chron. W. Hemingforda p. 462. Sim. Dunelm. p. 414. Alur. Beverl. p. 137.</NOTE>. The King was

where his uncles had already taken possession of the fort∣resses
of Pevensey and Rochester. Both these places, he
successively reduced by famine; and tho' he was pre∣vailed
on by the earl of Chester, William de Warrenne,
and Robert Fitz Hamon, who had embraced his cause,
to spare the lives of the rebels, he confiscated all their
estates, and banished them the kingdom<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p 195. Order. Vital. p. 668.</NOTE>. This ad∣vantage
rendered his negociations more successful with
Roger earl of Shrewsbury, whom he detached from the
confederates<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 120. M. Paris, p. 10.</NOTE>; and as his powerful fleet, joined to the
indolent temper of Robert, prevented the arrival of the
Norman succours<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 194. W. Malm. p. 121. Annal. Waverl. p. 136.</NOTE>, all the other rebels found no resource
but in flight or submission. Some of them received a
pardon; but the greater part were confiscated; and the
King bestowed their estates on the Norman barons, who
had remained faithful to him<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 372.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WILLIAM,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1089.</NOTE> freed from the danger of this insurrection,
took little care of fulfilling his promises to the English,
who still found themselves exposed to the same oppres∣sions,
which they had undergone during the reign of the
Conqueror, and which were rather augmented by the
violent, impetuous temper of the present monarch. The
death of Lanfranc, who had retained great influence over
him, gave soon after a full career to his tyranny; and
all orders of men found reason to complain of an arbi∣trary
and illegal administration<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 122, 123.</NOTE>. Even the privileges
of the church, which were held very sacred in those
days, were a feeble rampart against his usurpations<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 14. M. Paris, p. 11.</NOTE>. He
seized the temporalities of all the vacant bishoprics and
abbies; he delayed the appointing successors to those dig∣nities,
<PB N="309" REF="341"/>
that he might the longer enjoy the profits of their
revenue; he bestowed some of the church lands in pro∣perty
on his captains and favourites; and he openly put
to sale such sees and abbies as he thought proper to dis∣pose
of. Tho' the murmurs of the ecclesiastics, which
were quickly propagated to the nation, rose high against
this grievance, the terror of William's authority, con∣firmed
by the suppression of the late insurrections, re∣tained
every one in subjection, and preserved a general
tranquillity in England.</P>
<P>THE King even thought himself enabled to disturb
his brother in the Possession of Normandy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1090</NOTE> The loose
and negligent administration of that prince had enbold∣ened
the Norman barons to affect an independancy in
their government;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of Normandy.</NOTE> and their mutual quarrels and devas∣tations
had rendered that whole territory a scene of vio∣lence
and outrage<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 672.</NOTE>. Two of them, Walter and Odo,
were bribed by William to deliver the fortresses of St.
Valori and Albemarle into his hands<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 196. W. Malm. P. 121. Hoveden, p. 462.</NOTE>: Others soon af∣ter
imitated the example; while Philip, King of France,
who ought to have protected his vassal in the possession
of his fief, was, after making some efforts in his favour,
engaged by large presents to remain neuter<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 196. W. Malm. p. 121. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 53.</NOTE>. The duke
had also reason to apprehend danger from the intrigues
of his brother Henry. This young prince, who had in∣herited
nothing of his father's great possessions but some
of his money, had furnished Robert, while he was mak∣ing
his preparations against England, with the sum of
three thousand marks; and in return for so slender a
supply, had been put in possession of the Cotentin,
which comprehended near a third of the dutchy of Nor∣mandy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">T. Rudb. p. 263. W. Gemet. P. 293. Order. Vitalis, p. 665.</NOTE>.
<PB N="310" REF="342"/>
Robert afterwards upon some suspicion threw
him into prison; but finding himself exposed to invasion
from the King of England, and dreading the conjunc∣tion
of the two brothers against him, he now gave Hen∣ry
his liberty, and even made use of his assistance in
suppressing the insurrections of his rebellious subjects.
Conan, a rich burgess of Roüen, had entered into a
conspiracy to deliver that city to William; but Henry,

<P>THE King appeared in Normandy at the head of an
army; and affairs seemed to have come to extremity be∣tween
the brothers; when the nobility on both sides,
strongly connected by interest and alliances, interposed
and procured an accommodation. The immediate ad∣vantage
of this treaty accrued to William, who obtain∣ed
possession of the territory of Eu, the towns of Au∣male,
Fescamp, and other places: But in return he pro∣mised,
that he would assist his brother in subduing Maine,
which had rebelled; and that the Norman barons, for∣feited
in Robert's cause, should be restored to their estates
in England. The two brothers also stipulated, that on
the demise of either without issue, the survivor should
inherit all his dominions; and twelve of the most power∣ful
barons on each side swore, that they would employ
their power to insure the effectual execution of the whole
treaty<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax▪ p. 197. W. Malm p. 121. Hoveden, p. 462. M. Paris, p. 11. Annal. Waverl. p. 137. W. Heming. p. 463. Sim. Dunelm. p. 216. Brompton, p. 986.</NOTE>: A strong proof of the great independance and

<P>PRINCE Henry, disgusted, that so little care had been

<PB N="311" REF="343"/>
St. Michael's Mount, a strong fortress on the coast of
Normandy, and infested the neighbourhood with his in∣cursions<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 161.</NOTE>. Robert and William with their joint forces
besieged him in this place, and had nearly reduced him
by the scarcity of water; when the elder, hearing of his
distress, granted him permission to supply himself, and
also sent him some pipes of wine for his own table.
Being reproved by William for this ill-timed generosity,
he replied, <HI>What! shall I suffer my brother to die with
thirst? Where shall we find another, when he is gone</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. P. 121. T. Rudborne, p. 264. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 53.</NOTE>?
The King also, during this siege, performed an act of
generosity, which was less suitable to his character.
Riding out one day alone, to take a survey of the fort∣ress,
he was attacked by two soldiers, and dismounted.
One of them drew his sword in order to dispatch him;
when the King exclaimed, <HI>Hold knave! I am the King
of England.</HI> The soldier suspended his blow; and rais∣ing
the King from the ground, with, expressions of re∣spect,
received a handsome reward, and was taken into
his service<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 121. T. Rudborne, p. 263. Knyghton, p. 2359.</NOTE>. Prince Henry was soon after obliged to

wandered about for some time with very few attend∣ants,

<P>THE continued intestine discord among the barons

commonly short and feeble, produced little bloodshed,
and were attended with no memorable event. To this

more durable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1093.</NOTE> Malcolm, two years after, levying an

action ensued, in which Malcolm. was slain<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 199. Hoveden, p. 463. W. Heming. P. 464.</NOTE>. This in∣cident
disjointed for some years the succession to the
Scottish crown. Tho' Malcolm left legitimate sons,
his brother, Donald, on account of the youth of these
princes, was advanced to the throne; but kept not long
possession of the royal dignity. Duncan, natural son of
Malcolm, formed a conspiracy against him; and being
assisted by William with a small force, made himself
master of the kingdom<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 199. Hoveden, p. 463.</NOTE>. New broils ensued with Nor∣mandy.
The frank, open, remiss temper of Robert was
ill fitted to withstand the interested, rapacious character
of William, who, being supported by greater power, was
still encroaching on his brother's possessions, and ex∣citing
his turbulent barons to rebellion against him<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 12. Annal. Waverl. p. 138.</NOTE>.
The King having gone over to Normandy to support his
partizans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1094.</NOTE> ordered an army of twenty thousand men to
be levied in England, and to be conducted to the sea∣coast,
as if they were instantly to be embarked. Here
Ralph Flambard, the King's minister, and the chief in∣strument
of his extortions, exacted ten shillings a-piece
from them, in lieu of their service, and then dismissed
them into their several counties<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 201. H. Hunt. p. 373. M. Paris, p. 12. W. Heming. P. 465. Sim. Dunelm. p. 220.</NOTE>. This money was so
skilfully employed by William, that it rendered him bet∣ter
service than he could have expected from the army.
<PB N="313" REF="345"/>
He engaged the French King by new presents<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. P. 201. Annal. Waverl. p. 139.</NOTE> to de∣part
from the protection of Robert; and he daily bribed
the Norman barons to desert his service<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 464.</NOTE>: But was pre∣vented
from pushing his advantages against the duke,
by an incursion of the Welsh, which obliged him to
return into England<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 201. W. Heming. p. 465.</NOTE>. He found no difficulty to repel
the enemy; but was not able to make any considerable
impression on a country, guarded by its mountainous si∣tuation.
A conspiracy of his own barons, which was
detected at this time, appeared a more serious concern,
and engrossed all his attention. Robert Mowbray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1095.</NOTE> earl
of Northumberland, was at the head of this combina∣tion;
and he engaged in it the count d'Eu, Richard de
Tunbrige, Roger de Lacey, and many others. The
purpose of the conspirators was to dethrone the King,
and to advance in his stead, Stephen, count of Aumale,
nephew to the Conqueror<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 465. Sim. Dun. p. 221.</NOTE>. William's expedition pre∣vented
the design from taking effect, and disconcerted
the conspirators. Mowbray made some resistance; but
being made prisoner, was forfeited, and thrown into
confinement, where he died about thirty years after<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 202, 203. W. Malmes. p. 124. H. Hunt. p. 373. Annal. Waverl. p. 139.</NOTE>.
The count d'Eu denied his concurrence in the plot;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1096.</NOTE> and
to justify himself, fought in the presence of the court at
Windfor, a d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el with Geoffrey Bainard, who accused

to be castrated, and to have his eyes put out<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 124. Hoveden, p. 466.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="314" REF="346"/>
BUT the noise of these petty wars and commotions
was quite sunk in the tumult of the Crusades, which now
engrossed the attention of all Europe, and have ever since
employed the curiosity of mankind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Crusades.</NOTE> as the most signal
and most durable monument of human folly, that has yet
appeared in any age or nation. After Mahomet had, by
means of his pretended revelations, united the dispersed
Arabians under one heady they issued forth from their
desarts in great multitudes; and being animated with
zeal for their new religion, and supported by the vigor
of their new government, they made deep impressions on
the eastern empire, which was far in the decline, with
regard both to military discipline and to civil policy.
Jerusalem, by its situation, became one of their most
early conquests; and the Christians had the mortification
to fee the holy sepulchre, and the other places, made
famous by the presence of their religious founder, fallen
into the possession of infidels. But the Arabians or Sa∣racens
were so employed in military enterprizes, by
which they spread their empire, in a few years, from
tre banks of the Ganges to the straits of Gibraltar, that
they had no leisure for theological controversy; and tho'
the Alcoran, the original monument of their faith, seems
to contain some violent precepts, they were much less
infected with the spirit of bigotry and prosecution than
the speculative Greeks, who were continually refining
on the several articles of their religious system. They
gave little disturbance to those zealous pilgrims, who
daily flocked to Jerusalem; and they allowed every man,
after paying; a moderate tribute, to visit the holy se∣pulchre,
to perform, his religious duties, and to return
in peace. But the Turcomans or Turks, a tribe of
Tartars, who bad embraced Mahometism, having wrested
Syria from the Saracens, and having in the year 1065,
made themselves masters of Jerusalem, rendered the pil∣grimage
much more difficult and dangerous to the Chri∣stians.
<PB N="315" REF="347"/>
The barbarity of their manners, and the con∣fufions
attending their unsettled government, exposed the
pilgrims to many insults, robberies, and extortions; and
these zealots, returning from their meritorious fatigues
and sufferings, filled all Christendom with indignation
against the infidels, who profaned the holy city by their
presence, and derided the sacred mysteries in the very
place of their completion. Gregory VII. among the
other vast ideas, which he entertained, had formed the
design of uniting all the western Christians against the
Mahometans; but his exorbitant enterprizes against the
civil power of princes, had created him so many enemies,
and had rendered his schemes so suspicious, that he was
not able to make great progress in this undertaking.
The work was reserved for a meaner instrument, whose
low condition exposed him to no jealousy, and whose
folly was well calculated to coincide with the prevailing
principles of the times.</P>
<P>PETER, commonly called the Hermit, a native of
Amiens in Picardy, had made the pilgrimage to Jerusa∣lem;
and being deeply affected with the dangers, to
which that act of piety now exposed the pilgrims, as
well as with the instances of oppression, under which the
eastern Christians laboured, he entertained the bold, and,
in all appearance, impracticable project of leading into
Asia, from the farthest extremities of the west, armies
sufficient to subdue those potent and warlike nations,
which now held the holy land in slavery and subjection<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gu'. Tyrius, lib. 1. cap. 11. M. Paris, p. 17.</NOTE>.
He proposed his views to Martin II. who filled the pa∣pal
chair, and who, tho' he was sensible of the advan∣tages,
which the head, of the Christian religion must
reap from a religious war, and tho' he esteemed the blind
zeal of Peter a proper means for effecting the purpose<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gul. Tyrius, lib. 1. cap. 13.</NOTE>,
<PB N="316" REF="348"/>
resolved not to interpose his authority, till he saw a
greater probability of success. He summoned a council
at Placentia, which consisted of four thousand ecclesi∣astics
and thirty thousand seculars; and which was so
numerous, that no hall could contain the multitude, and
it was necessary to hold the assembly in a plain. The
harangues of the pope, and of Peter himself, represent∣ing
the dismal situation of their brethren in the east, and
the indignity, suffered by the Christian name, in allow∣ing
the holy city to remain in the hands of the infidels,
here found the minds of men so well prepared, that the
whole multitude, as if actuated by a supernatural in∣stinct,
declared for the war, and solemnly devoted them∣selves to perform this service, so meritorious, as they be∣lieved
it, towards God and religion.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Italy seemed thus to have embraced zea∣lously
the design, Martin justly thought, that, in order
to insure success, it was necessary to inlist the greater
and more warlike nations in the same engagement; and
having exhorted Peter previously to visit the chief cities
and sovereigns of Christendom, he summoned another
council at Clermont in Auvergne<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Concil. tom. 10. Concil. Clarom. Matth. Paris, p. 16. M. West. p. 233.</NOTE>. The same of this
great and pious design, being now universally diffused,
procured the attendance of the greatest prelates, nobles,
and princes; and when the Pope and the hermit renew∣ed
their pathetic exhortations, the whole assembly, as if
impelled by an immediate inspiration, not moved by
their preceding impressions, exclaimed with one voice,
<HI>It is the will of God, It is the will of God:</HI> Words deemed
so memorable, and so much the result of a divine influ∣ence,
that they were employed as the signal of rendez∣vous
and battle in all the future exploits of these adven∣turers<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Historia Bell, Sacri, tom. 1. Mus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ei Ital.</NOTE>. Men of all ranks flew to arms with the utmost
<PB N="317" REF="349"/>
ardour; and an exterior symbol too, a circumstance
of chief moment, was here chosen by the devoted com∣batants.
The sign of the cross, which had been hitherto
so much revered among Christians, and which, the more
it was an object of reproach among infidels, was the
more passionately cherished by them, became the badge
of union, and was affixed to their right shoulder, by all
who inlisted themselves in this sacred warfare<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hist. Bell. Sacri, tom. 1, Mus Ital, Order. Vital. p. 721.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EUROPE was at this time sunk into a profound ignor∣ance
and superstition: The ecclesiastics had acquired the
greatest ascendant over the human mind: The people,
who, being little restrained by honour and less by law,
abandoned themselves to the greatest crimes and disor∣ders,
knew of no other expiation than the observances
imposed on them by their spiritual pastors: And it was
easy to represent the holy war as an equivalent for all
penances<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 720.</NOTE>, and an atonement for every violation of
justice or humanity. But amidst the abject superstition,
which now prevailed, the military spirit also had uni∣versally
diffused itself; and tho' not supported by art or
discipline, was become the general passion of the nations,
governed by the feudal law. All the great lords pos∣sessed
the right of peace and war: They were engaged
in continual hostilities with each other: The open coun∣try
was become a scene of outrage and disorder: The
cities, which were still mean and poor, were neither
guarded by walls, nor protected by privileges, and were
exposed to each insult: Every man was obliged to de∣pend
for safety on his own force, or his private allian∣ces:
And valour was the only excellence, which was
held in esteem, or gave one man the pre-eminence above
another. When all the particular superstitions, therefore,
Were here united in one great object, the ardour for pri∣vate
<PB N="318" REF="350"/>
hostilities took the same direction; and Europe,
impelled by its two ruling passions, was loosened, as it
were, from its foundations, and seemed to precipitate it∣self
in one united body upon the east.</P>
<P>ALL orders of men, deeming the crusades the only
road to heaven, inlisted themselves under these sacred
banners, and were impatient to open the way with their
sword to the holy city. Nobles, artizans, peasants,
even priests<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 720.</NOTE> inrolled their names; and to decline this
meritorious service was branded with the reproach of
impiety, or what perhaps was esteemed still more dis∣graceful,
of cowardice and pusillanimity<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 133.</NOTE>. The infirm
and aged contributed to the expedition by presents and
money; and many of them, not satisfied with the merit
of this atonement, attended it in person, and were deter∣mined,
if possible, to breathe their last, in sight of that
city where their Saviour had died for them. Women
themselves, concealing their sex under the disguise of
armour, attended the camp; and commonly forgot still
more the duty of their sex, by prostituting themselves,
without reserve, to the army<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Vertot Hist. de Chev. De Malte, vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. p. 46.</NOTE>. The greatest criminals
were forward in a service, which they regarded as a pro∣pitiation
for all crimes; and the most enormous disor∣ders
were, during the course of these expeditions, com∣mitted
by men enured to wickedness, encouraged by
example, and impelled by necessity. The multitude of
the adventurers soon became so great, that their more
sagacious leaders, Hugh count de Vermandois, brother
to the French King, Raymond count of Tholouse, God∣frey
of Boulogne, prince of Brabant, and Stephen count
of Blois<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dunelm. p. 222.</NOTE>, became apprehensive lest the greatness of the
armament itself would disappoint its purpose; and they
<PB N="319" REF="351"/>
permitted an undisciplined multitude, computed at
300,000 men, to go before them under the command of
Peter the Hermit, and. Walter the Moneyless<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Matth Paris, p. 17.</NOTE>. These
men took the road towards Constantinople thro' Hun∣gary
and Bulgaria; and trusting, that heaven, by supper∣natural
assistance, would supply all their necessities, they
made no provision for subsistance on their march. They
soon found themselves obliged to obtain by plunder what
they had vainly expected from miracles; and the en∣raged
inhabitants of the countries thro' which they pas∣sed,
gathering together in arms, attacked the disorderly
multitude, and put them to slaughter without resistance.
The more disciplined armies followed after; and passing
over the straits at Constantinople, they were mustered in
the plains of Asia, and amounted in the whole to the
number of 700,000 combatants<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 20, 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMIDST this universal madness, which spread itself
by contagion throughout all Europe, especially in France
and Germany, men were not entirely forgetful of their
present interests; and both those who went on this ex∣pedition,
and those who staid behind, entertained schemes
of gratifying, by its means, their avarice or their ambition.
The nobles who inlisted themselves were moved,
by the romantic spirit of the age, to hope for opule<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
establishments in the east, the chief seat of arts and com∣merce
during those ages; and in pursuit of these chime∣rical
projects, they sold at the lowest price their ancient
castles and inheritances, which had now lost all value in
their eyes. The greater princes, who remained at home,
besides establishing peace in their dominions by giving
occupation abroad to the inquietude and martial disposi∣tion
of their subjects, took the opportunity of annexing
to their crown many considerable fiefs, either by pur∣chase
<PB N="320" REF="352"/>
or by the extinction of the heirs. The Pope fre∣quently
turned the zeal of the crusades from the infidels
against his own enemies, whom he represented as equally criminal with the enemies of Christ. The convents
and other religious societies bought the possessions of the
adventurers; and as the contributions of the faithful were
commonly entrusted to their management, they often
diverted to this purpose what was intended to be em∣ployed
against the infidels<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo Hist, delle benef. ecclesiast. p. 128.</NOTE>. But no one was a more
immediate gainer by this epidemic fury than the King of
England, who kept aloof from all connexions with those
fanatical and romantic warriors.</P>
<P>ROBERT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acquisition Nor∣mandy.</NOTE> duke of Normandy, impelled by the brav∣ery
and mistaken generosity of his spirit, had early in∣listed
himself in the crusade; but being always unpro∣vided
of money, he found, that it would be impracti∣cable
for him to appear, in a manner suitable to his rank
and station, at the head of his numerous vassals and sub∣jects,
who, transported with the general rage, were de∣termined
to follow him into Asia. He resolved, there∣fore,
to mortgage or rather to sell his dominions, which
he had not talents to govern; and he offered them to
his brother William, for no greater sum than ten thou∣sand
marks<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 123. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 24. Annal. Waverl. p. 139. W. Heming. p. 467. Flor. Wig. p. 648. Sim. Dunelm. p. 222. Knyghton, p. 2364.</NOTE>. The bargain was soon concluded: The
King raised the money by violent extortions on his sub∣jects
of all ranks, even on the convents, who were
obliged to melt their plate in order to furnish the quota
demanded of them<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, P. 35. W. Malm. p. 123. W. Heming. p. 467.</NOTE>: He was put in possession of Nor∣mandy
and Maine: And Robert, providing himself of
a magnificent train, set out for the holy land, in pursuit
<PB N="321" REF="353"/>
of glory, and, as he believed, in full assurance of secur∣ing
his eternal salvation.</P>
<P>THE smallness of this sum, with the difficulties which
William found in raising it, suffices alone to refute the
account, which is heedlessly adopted by historians, of the
enormous revenue of the Conqueror. Is it credible,
that Robert would consign into the rapacious hands of
his brother such considerable dominions, for a sum,
which, according to that account, made not a week's
income of his father's treasury? Or that the King of
England could not on demand, without oppressing his
subjects, have been able to pay him the money? The
Conqueror, it is agreed, was frugal as well as rapacious;
and yet his treasure, at his death, exceeded not 60,000
pounds, which would have been no more than his in∣come
for two months: Another certain refutation of that
exaggerated account.</P>
<P>THE fury of the crusades, during this age, less in∣fected
England than the neighbouring kingdoms; prob∣ably
because the Norman conquerors, finding their set∣tlement
in that kingdom still somewhat precarious, dared
not to abandon their own houses, in quest of distant ad∣ventures.
The selfish interested humour also of the
King, which kept him from kindling in the general
flame, checked its progress among his subjects; and as
he is accused of open profaneness<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">G. Neubr. p. 358. W. Gemet. p. 292.</NOTE>, and was endowed
with a sharp wit<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Malm. p. 122.</NOTE>, it is likely that he made the roman∣tic
chivalry of the crusades the object of his perpetual ri∣dicule.
As an instance of his irreligion, we are told,
that he once accepted of sixty marks from a Jew, whose
eldest son had been converted to Christianity, and who
engaged him by that present to assist him in bringing
back the youth to Judaism. William employed both
<PB N="322" REF="354"/>
menaces and persuasion to that purpose; but finding the
new convert obstinate in his faith, he sent for the father,
and told him, that as he had not succeeded, it was not
just that he should keep the present; but as he had done
his utmost, it was but equitable that he should be paid for
his pains; and he would therefore only retain thirty
marks of the money<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 47.</NOTE>. At another time, it is said he
sent for some learned Christian theologians and some
rabbies, and bade them fairly dispute the question of
their religion in his presence: He was perfectly indif∣ferent
between them, had his ears open to reason and
conviction, and would embrace that doctrine, which
upon comparison should be found supported by the most
solid arguments<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 123.</NOTE>. If this story be true, it is probable
that he meant only to amuse himself by turning both in∣to
ridicule: But we must be cautious of admitting every
thing related by the monkish historians to the disadvant∣age
of this prince: He had the misfortune to be engaged
in quarrels with the ecclesiastics, particularly with An∣selm,
commonly called St. Anselm, archbishop of Can∣terbury;
and it is no wonder his memory should be
blackened by the historians of that order.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of Lanfranc,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarrel with An∣selm, the primate.</NOTE> the King, for several
years, retained in his own hands the revenues of Can∣terbury,
as well as those of many other vacant bishop∣rics;
but falling into a dangerous illness, he was seized
with remorse, and the clergy represented to him, that he
was in danger of eternal perdition, if before his death he
did not make atonement for those multiplied impieties
and sacrileges, of which he had been guilty<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 16. Chron. Sax. p. 198. H. Hunt. p. 373. Hove∣den, p. 463. M. Paris, p. 12. Annul. Waverl▪ p. 138. T. Rudb. p. 264. Flor. Wigorn. p. 645. Sim. Dunelm, p. 217. Diceto, p. 490.</NOTE>. He re∣solved
therefore to supply instantly the vacancy of Can∣terbury;
and for that purpose he sent for Anselm, a Pied∣montese
<PB N="323" REF="355"/>
by birth, abbot of Bec in Normandy, who was
much celebrated for his learning and devotion. The
abbot refused earnestly the dignity, fell on his knees,
wept, and entreated the King to change his purpose<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 17. Diceto, p. 494.</NOTE>;
and when he found the prince obstinate in forcing the
pastoral staff upon him, he kept his fist so fast clenched,
that it required the utmost violence of the bystanders to
open it, and force him to receive that ensign of spiritual
dignity<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 18.</NOTE>. William soon after recovered his health; and
his passions regaining their usual force and vigour, he
returned to his former violence and rapine<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. P. 373. M. Paris, p. 12. Diceto, p. 494.</NOTE> He re∣tained
in prison several persons whom he had ordered to
be freed during the time of his penitence; he still preyed
upon the ecclesiastical benefices; the sale of spiritual dig∣nities
continued as open as ever; and he retained pos∣session
of a considerable part of the revenues belonging
to the see of Canterbury<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 19. 43. Chron. Sax. p. 199.</NOTE>. But he found in Anselm
that persevering opposition, which he had reason to ex∣pect
from the oftentatious humility, which that prelate
had employed in refusing his promotion.</P>
<P>THE opposition of Anselm was the more dangerous on
account of the character of piety, which be soon acquir∣ed
in England, by his great zeal against all abuses, par∣ticularly
those in dress and ornament. There was a
mode, which, in that age, prevailed throughout Europe,
both among men and women, to give an enormous
length to their shoes, to draw the toe to a sharp point,
and to affix to it the figure of a bird's bill, or some such
ornament, which was turned upwards, and which was
often sustained by gold or silver chains tied to the knee<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 682. W. Malmes p. 123. Knyghton, p. 2369.</NOTE>.
The ecclesiastics took exception at this ornament, which,
they said, was an attempt to bely the Scripture, where it
<PB N="324" REF="356"/>
is affirmed, that no man can add a cubit to his stature;
and they declaimed against it with great vehemence, nay
assembled same synods, who absolutely condemned it.
But such are the strange contradictions in human na∣ture!
Tho' the clergy, at that time, could overturn
thrones, and had authority sufficient to send above a
million of men on <HI>their</HI> errand to the desarts of Asia,
they never could prevail against these long-pointed shoes:
On the contrary, that caprice, contrary to all other modes, maintained its ground during several centuries;
and if the clergy had not at last desisted from their per∣secutions
of it, it might still have been the prevailing
fashion in Europe.</P>
<P>BUT Anselm was more fortunate in decrying the par∣ticular
mode, which was the object of his aversion, and
which probably had not taken such fast hold of the af∣fections
of the people. He preached zealously against
the long hair and curled locks, which were then fashion∣able
among the courtiers; he refused the ashes on Ash-Wednesday
to those who were so accoutered; and his
authority and eloquence had such influence, that the
young men universally abandoned that ornament, and
appeared in the cropt hair, which was recommended to
them by the sermons of the primate. The noted histo∣rian
of Anselm, who was also his companion and secre∣tary,
celebrates highly this effort of his zeal and piety<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN William's profaneness therefore returned to
him with his health, he was soon engaged in controver∣sies
with this austere prelate. There was at that time
a schism in the church, between Urban and Clement,
who both pretended to the papacy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 463.</NOTE>; and Anselm, who,
as abbot of Bec, had already acknowledged the former,
was determined, without the King's consent, to intro∣duce
<PB N="325" REF="357"/>
his authority into England<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 25. M. Paris, p. 13. Diceto, p. 494. Spelm. Conc. vol. ii. p. 16.</NOTE>. William, who, imi∣tating
his father's example, had prohibited his subjects,
from recognizing any Pope, whom he had not previ∣ously
received, was enraged at this pretension; and sum∣moned
a synod at Rockingham, with an intention of de∣posing
Anselm; but that prelate's suffragans declared,
that, without the papal authority, they knew of no ex∣pedient
for inflicting that censure on their primate<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 30.</NOTE>.
The King was at last engaged by other motives to give
the preference to Urban's title; Anselm received the
pall from that pontiff; and matters seemed to be tolera∣bly
composed between the King and the primate<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 495.</NOTE>, when
the quarrel broke out afresh from a new cause. William
had undertaken an expedition against Wales, and re∣quired
the archbishop to furnish his quota of soldiers for
that service; but Anselm, who regarded the demand as
an oppression on the church, and yet durst not refuse
compliance, sent them so miserably equipped, that the
King was extremely displeased, and threatened him with
a prosecution<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 37, 43.</NOTE>. Anselm, on the other hand, demanded
positively, that all the revenues of his see should be re∣stored
to him; appealed to Rome against the King's in∣justice<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 40.</NOTE>; and affairs came to such extremities, that the
primate, finding it dangerous to remain in the kingdom,
desired the King's permission to retire beyond sea. All
his temporalities were confiscated<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 13. Parker, p. 178.</NOTE>; but he was received
with great respect by Urban, who considered him as a
martyr in the cause of religion, and even menaced the
King, on account of his proceedings against the primate
and the church, with the sentence of excommunication.
Anselm assisted at the council of Bari, where, besides
fixing the controversy between the Greek and Latin
<PB N="326" REF="358"/>
churches, about the procession of the Holy Ghost<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 49. M. Paris, p. 13. Sim. Dunelm. p. 224.</NOTE>, the
right of election to church preferments was declared to
belong to the clergy alone, and spiritual censures were
denounced against all ecclesiastics, who did homage to
laymen for their sees or benefices, and on all laymen who
exacted it<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 14.</NOTE>. The rite of homage, by the feudal customs,
was, that the vassal should throw himself on his knees,
should put his joined bands between those of his superior,
and should in that posture swear fealty to him<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Spellman, Du Cange, in verb. <HI>Hominium.</HI></NOTE> But
the council declared it execrable, that pure hands, which
could create God, and could offer him up as a sacrifice
for the salvatlon of mankind, should be put, after this
humiliating manner, between profane hands, which, be∣sides
being inured to rapine and bloodshed, were employ∣ed
day and night in impure purposes and obscene con∣tacts<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 467. Flor. Wigorn. p. 649. Sim. Dunelm. p. 224. Brompton, p. 994.</NOTE>. Such were the reasonings prevalent in that age;
reasonings, which, tho' they cannot be passed over in
silence, without omitting the most curious and, perhaps,
not the least instructive part of history, can scarce be de∣livered
with the requisite decency and gravity.</P>
<P>THE cession of Wormandy and Maine by duke Ro∣bert
increased mightily the King's territories; but brought
him no great increase of power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1097</NOTE> because of the unsettled
state of these countries, the mutinous disposition of the
barons, and the near neighbourhood of the French King,
who supported them in all their insurrections. Even
Helie, lord of la Fleche, a small town in Anjou, was
able to give him inquietude; and this great monarch was
obliged to make several expeditions abroad, without being
able to prevail over so petty a baron, who had acquired
<PB N="327" REF="359"/>
the confidence and affections of the inhabitants of Maine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1098.</NOTE>
He was, however, so fortunate, as at last to take him
prisoner in a rencounter; but having released him, at
the intercession of the French King and the count d'An∣jou,
he found the province of Maine still exposed to his
intrigues and incursions. Helie, being introduced by the
citizens into the town of Mans, besieged the garrison
in the citadel; and William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1099.</NOTE> who was hunting in the
new forest, when he received this intelligence, was so
provoked, that he immediately turned about his horse's
head, and galloped to the sea-shore at Dartmouth; de∣claring,
that he would not stop a moment till he had ta∣ken
vengeance for this offence. He found the weather
so cloudy and tempestuous, that the mariners declared it
dangerous to put to sea; but the King hurried on board,
and ordered them to set sail; telling them, that they ne∣ver
yet heard of a King that was drowned<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 124. H. Hunt. p. 378. M. Paris, p. 36. Ypod. Neust. p. 442.</NOTE>. By this
vigour and celerity, he delivered the citadel of Mans
from its present danger; and pursuing Helie into his
own territories, he laid siege to Majol, a small castle in
those parts: But a wound, which he received in the
assault, obliged him to raise the siege; and he returned
to England.</P>
<P>The weakness of the greatest monarchs, during this
age, in their military expeditions against their nearest
neighbours, appears the more surprising, when we con∣sider
the prodigious numbers, which even petty princes,
seconding the enthusiastic rage of the people, were able
to assemble, and to conduct in dangerous enterprizes to
the remote provinces of Asia. William, earl of Poitiers
and duke of Guyenne, enflamed with the glory, and not
discouraged by the misfortunes, which had attended the
former adventurers in the crusades, had put himself at
<PB N="328" REF="360"/>
the head of an immense multitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1100.</NOTE> computed by some
historians to amount to 60,000 horse, and a much greater
number of foot<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 149. The whole is said by Order. Vital. p. 789, to amount to 300,000 men.</NOTE>, and proposed to lead them into the
holy land against the infidels. He wanted money to
forward the preparations requisite for this expedition,
and he offered to mortgage all his dominions to William,
without entertaining any scruple on account of that ra∣pacious
and iniquitous hand, into which he resolved to
consign them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes p. 127.</NOTE>. The King accepted his offer; and had
prepared a fleet, and an army, in order to escort the mo∣ney,
and take possession of the rich provinces of Guienne
and Poictou;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xd August.</NOTE> when an accident put an end to his life,
and to all his ambitious projects. He was engaged in
hunting, the sole amusement, and indeed the chief oc∣cupation
of princes in those rude times, when society was
little cultivated, and the arts afforded few objects worthy
of attention. Walter Tyrrel, a French gentleman, re∣markable
for his address in archery, attended him in this
recreation, of which the new forest was the scene; and
as William had dismounted after a chace, Tyrrel, impa∣tient
to show his dexterity, let fly an arrow at a stag,
which suddenly started before him, The arrow, glancing
from a tree, struck the King in the breast, and instantly
flew him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 126. H. Hunt. p. 378. M. Paris, p. 37. Petr. Bels. p. 110.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE> while Tyrrel, without informing any one
of the accident, put spurs to his horse, hastened to the
sea-shore, embarked for France, and joined the crusade
in an expedition to Jerusalem; a penance which he im∣posed
on himself for this involuntary crime. The body
of William was found in the forest by the country-people,
and was buried without any pomp or ceremony
at Winchester. His courtiers were negligent in perform∣ing
<PB N="329" REF="361"/>
their last duty to a master who was so little beloved;
and every one was too much occupied in the interesting
object of fixing his successor, to attend the funerals of a
dead sovereign.</P>
<P>THE memory of this monarch is transmitted to us
with little advantage by the churchmen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and character of William Rufus.</NOTE> whom he had
offended; and tho' we may suspect in general, that their
account of his vices is somewhat exaggerated, his con∣duct
affords little reason for contradicting the character
which they have assigned him, or for attributing to him
any very estimable qualities. He seems to have been a
violent and tyrannical prince; a perfidious, encroaching,
and dangerous neighbour; an unkind and ungenerous
relation. He was equally prodigal and rapacious in the
management of his treasury; and if he possessed abilities,
he lay so much under the government of impetuous pas∣sions,
that he made little use of them in his administration;
and he indulged entirely that domineering policy,
which suited his temper, and which, if supported, as it
was in him, with courage and vigour, proves often more
successful, in disorderly times, than the deepest foresight
and most refined artifice.</P>
<P>THE monuments which remain of this prince in Eng∣land
are the Tower, Westminster-hall, and London-bridge,
which he built. The most laudable foreign en∣terprize
which he undertook, was the sending Edgar
Atheling, three years before his death, into Scotland
with a small army, to restore prince Edgar the true heir
of that kingdom, son of Malcolm, and of Margaret,
sister of Edgar Atheling; and the enterprize proved suc∣cessful<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 206. W. Malm. p. 122. Hoveden, p. 466. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 56.</NOTE>.
It was remarked in that age, that his elder
brother, Richard, perished by an accident in the new fo∣rest;
Richard, his nephew, natural son of duke Robert,
<PB N="330" REF="362"/>
lost his life in the same place after the same manner: And
all men, upon the King's fate, exclaimed, that, as the
Conqueror had been guilty of extreme violence, by ex∣pelling
all the inhabitants of that large district, to make
room for his game, the just vengeance of heaven was
signalized, in the same place, by the slaughter of his
posterity<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 468. Flor. Wig. p. 649. W. Gemet. p. 296. Sim. Dunelm. p. 225. Brompton, p. 996.</NOTE> William was slain in the thirteenth year of
his reign, and about the fortieth of his age<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 127.</NOTE>. As he
was never married, he left no legitimate issue behind
him.</P>
<P>IN the eleventh year of this reign, Magnus King of
Norway, made a descent on the Isle of Anglesea; but
was repulsed by Hugh, earl of Shrewsbury<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dunelm. p. 223.</NOTE>. This is

<P>AFTER the adventurers in the holy war were as∣sembled
on the banks of the Bosphorus, opposite
to Constantinople, they proceeded on their enterprize;
but immediately experienced those difficulties, which
their zeal had hitherto concealed from them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cru∣sades.</NOTE> and for
which, even if they had foreseen them, it would have
been almost impossible to provide a proper remedy. The
Greek Emperor, Alexis Comnenus, who had applied to
the western christians for succour against the Turks, en∣tertained
hope, and that but a feeble one, of only obtaining
such a moderate supply, as, acting under his
command, might enable him to repulse the enemy: But
he was extremely astonished to see his dominions over∣whelmed,
on a sudden, with such an inundation of licen∣tious
barbarians, who, tho' they pretended friendship,
despised his subjects as unwarlike, and detested them as
heretical. By all the arts of policy, in which he excel∣led,
he endeavoured to divert the torrent; but while he
<PB N="332" REF="364"/>
employed professions, caresses, civilities, and seeming ser∣vices
towards the leaders of the crusade, he secretly re∣garded
those imperious allies as more dangerous than
the open enemies, by whom his empire had been for∣merly
invaded. Having effectuated that difficult point
of disembarking them safely in Asia, he entered into a
private correspondence with Soliman, Emperor of the
Turks; and practised every insidious art, which his ge∣nius,
his power, or his situation enabled him to employ,
for disappointing the enterprize, and discouraging the
Latins from making thenceforward any such prodigious
migrations. His dangerous policy was seconded by the
disorders, inseparable from so vast a multitude, who were
not united under one head, and were conducted by leaders
of the most independant, intractable spirits, unacquainted
with military discipline, and still more enemies to civil
authority and submission. The scarcity of provisions, the
excesses of fatigue, the influence of unknown climates,
joined to the want of concert in their operations, and the
sword of a warlike enemy, destroyed the adventurers by
thousands, and would have abated the ardor of men, im∣pelled
to war by less powerful motives. Their zeal,
however, their bravery, and their irresistible force still
carried them forward, and continually advanced them to
the great end of their enterprizes. After an obstinate
siege, they took Nice, the seat of the Turkish empire;
they defeated Soliman in two great battles; they made
themselves masters of Antioch; and entirely broke the
force of the Turks, who had so long retained these
countries in subjection. The soldan of Egypt, whose
alliance they had hitherto courted, recovered, on the fall
of the Turkish power, his former authority in Jerusalem;
and informed them by his ambassadors, that, if they came
disarmed to that city, they might now perform their reli∣gious
vows, and that all Christian pilgrims, who should
<PB N="333" REF="365"/>
thenceforth visit the holy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epulchre, might expect the same
treatment, which they had ever received from his
predecessors. This offer was rejected; the soldan was
required to yield up the city to the Christians; and on
his refusal, the champions of the cross advanced to the
siege of Jerusalem, which they regarded as the consum∣mation
of their labours. By the detachments, which
they had made, and the disasters, which they had under∣gone,
they were diminished, to the number of twenty
thousand foot and fifteen hundred horse; but these were
still formidable from their valour, their experience, and
the obedience, which, at the price of past calamities,
they had learned to pay to their leaders. After a siege
of five weeks, they took Jerusalem by assault; and, im∣pelled
by a mixture of military and religious rage, they
put the numerous garrison and inhabitants to the sword
without distinction. Neither arms defended the valiant,
nor submission the timorous: No age nor sex was spared:
Infants on the breast were pierced by the same blow with
their mothers, who implored for mercy: Even a multi∣tude,
to the number of ten thousand persons, who had
surrendered themselves prisoners, and were promised
quarter, were butchered in cold blood by these ferocious
conquerors<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Vertot, vol. i, p. 57.</NOTE>. The streets of Jerusalem were covered
with dead bodies<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 34. Order. Vitat. p. 756. Diceto, p. 498.</NOTE>; and the triumphant warriors, after
every enemy was subdued and slaughtered, immediately
turned themselves, with the sentiments of humiliation
and contrition, towards the holy sepulchre. They threw
aside their arms, still streaming with blood: They ad∣vanced
with reclined bodies, and naked feet and head to
that facred monument: They sung anthems to their
Saviour who had purchased their salvation by his death
and agony; And their devotion, enlivened by the pre∣sence
<PB N="334" REF="366"/>
of the place where he had suffered, so overcame
their fury, that they dissolved in tears, and bore the ap∣pearance
of every soft and tender sentiment<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 34. Order. Vital. p. 756.</NOTE>. So incon∣sistent
is human nature with itself! And so easily does
the most effeminate superstition ally both with the most
heroic courage, and with the fiercest barbarity!</P>
<P>THIS great event happened on the fifth of July in the
last year of the eleventh century. The Christian pri∣nces
and nobles, after choosing Godfrey of Boulogne King
of Jerusalem, began to settle themselves in their new
conquests; while some of them returned to Europe, in
order to enjoy at home that glory which their valour had
acquired them in this popular and meritorious enterprize.
Among these, was Robert, duke of Normandy, who,
as he had abandoned the greatest dominions of any prince,
that attended the crusade, had all along distinguished
himself by the most intrepid courage<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 35. W. Heming. p. 467. G. Newbrig. p. 358.</NOTE>, as well as by that
affable disposition and unbounded generosity, which gain
the hearts of soldiers, and qualify a prince to shine in a
military life. In passing thro' Italy, he became acquainted
with Sibylla, daughter of the count of Conversana, a
young lady of great beauty and merit, whom he espou∣sed<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 153. Gul. Gemet. p. 299.</NOTE>; and indulging himself in this new passion, as well
as fond of enjoying ease and pleasure, after the fatigues
of so many rough campaigns, he lingered a twelvemonth
in that delicious climate; and tho' his friends in the
north looked every moment for his arrival, none of them
knew when they could with certainty expect it. By this
delay, he lost the kingdom of England, which the great
fame he had acquired during the crusades, as well as his
undoubted title, both by birth, and by the preceding
agreement with his deceased brother, would, had he been
present, have infallibly secured to him.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="367"/>
PRINCE Henry was hunting with Rufus in the new
forest, when intelligence of that prince's death was
brought him; and being sensible of the advantage, at∣tending
the conjuncture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accession of Henry.</NOTE> he immediately galloped to
Winchester, in order to secure the royal treasure, which
he knew to be a necessary implement for facilitating his
designs on the crown. He had scarcely reached the place
when William de Breteuil, keeper of the treasure, arri∣ved,
and opposed himself to Henry's pretensions. This
nobleman, who had been engaged in the same party of
hunting, had no sooner heard of his master's death,
than he hastened to take care of his charge; and he told
the prince, that this treasure, as well as the crown, be∣longed
to his elder brother, who was now his sovereign;
and that he himself, for his part, was determined, in
spite of all other pretensions, to maintain his allegiance
to him. But Henry, drawing his sword, threatened him
with instant death, if he dared to disobey him; and as
others of the late King's retinue, who came every mo∣ment
to Winchester, joined the prince's party, Breteuil
was obliged to withdraw his opposition, and to acqui∣esce in this violence<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 782.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY, without losing a moment, hastened with his
money to London; and having assembled some noblemen
and prelates, whom his address, or abilities, or presents,
gained to his side, he was suddenly elected, or rather sa∣luted
King; and immediately proceeded to the exercise
of the royal dignity. In less than three days after his
brother's death, the ceremonial of his coronation was
performed by Maurice, bishop of London, who was
persuaded to officiate on that occasion<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 208. Order. Vital. p. 783.</NOTE>; and thus, by
his courage and celerity, he intruded himself into the va∣cant
throne. No one had sufficient spirit or sense of
<PB N="336" REF="368"/>
duty to appear in defence of the absent prince: All men
were seduced or intimidated: Present possession supplied
the apparent deficiencies of Henry's title, which was in∣deed
founded on plain usurpation: And the barons, as
well as the people, acquiesced in a claim, which, tho' it
could neither be justified nor comprehended, could now,
they found, be opposed only thro' the perils of civil war
and rebellion.</P>
<P>BUT as Henry easily foresaw, that a crown, usurped
against all rules of justice, would sit very unsteady on
his head, he resolved, by fair professions at least, to gain
the affections of all his subjects. Besides taking the usual
coronation-oath to maintain the laws and execute justice,
he passed a charter, which was calculated to remedy
many of the grievous oppressions, which had been com∣plained
of during the reign of his father and brother<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 208. Sim. Dunelm. p. 225. Brompton, p. 997.</NOTE>.
He there promised, that, upon the death of any bishop
or abbot, he never would seize the revenues of the see
or abbey during the vacancy, but would leave the whole
to be reaped by the successor; and that he would never
let to farm any ecclesiastical benefice, nor dispose of it
for money. After this concession to the church, whose
favour was of so great consequence, he proceeded to
enumerate the civil grievances, which he purposed to re∣dress.
He promised, that upon the death of any earl,
baron, or military tenant, his heir should be admitted to
the possesion of his estate, on paying a just and lawful
relief; without being exposed to such exorbitant exac∣tions
as had been required during the late reigns: He
remitted the wardship of minors, and allowed guardians
to be appointed, who should be answerable for the trust:
He promised not to dispose of any heiress in marriage,
but by the advice of all the barons; and if any baron in∣tended
to give his daughter, sister, niece, or kinswoman,
<PB N="337" REF="369"/>
in marriage, it should only be necessary for him to con∣sult the King, who promised to take no money for his
consent, nor ever to refuse permission, unless the person
to whom it was proposed to marry her should happen to
be his enemy: He granted his barons and military tenants
the power of bequeathing by will their money or personal
estates; and if they neglected to make a will, he pro∣mised,
that their heirs should succeed to them: He remit∣ted
the right of imposing moneyage, and of levying
taxes at pleasure on the farms, which the barons retained
in their own hands<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">See Appendix II.</NOTE>: He made some general professions
of moderating fines; he offered a pardon for all offen∣ces;
and he remitted all debts due to the crown: He re∣quired,
that the vassals of the barons should enjoy the
same privileges, which he granted to his own barons;
and he promised a general confirmation and observance
of the laws of King Edward. This is the substance of
the chief articles contained in that famous charter<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, p. 38. Hoveden, p. 468. Brompton, p. 1021. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gulstad, p. 310.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To give greater authenticity to these concessions, Henry
lodged a copy of his charter in some abbey of each
county; as if desirous, that it should be exposed to the
eyes of all his subjects, and remain as a perpetual rule
for the limitation and direction of his government: Yet
is it certain, that, after the present turn was served, he
never once thought, during his reign, of observing one
single article of it; and the whole fell so much into ne∣glect
and oblivion, that, in the following century, when
the barons, who had heard an obscure tradition of it,
desired to make it the model of the great charter, which
they exacted from King John, they could only find one
copy of it in the whole kingdom. Bat as to the grievan∣ces
here proposed to be redressed, they were still con∣tinued
<PB N="338" REF="370"/>
in their full extent; and the royal authority, in
all these heads, lay under no manner of restriction. Re∣liefs
of heirs, so capital an article, were never effectually
fixed till the time of Magna Charta<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Glanv. lib. 2. cap. 36. What is called a relief in the Conqueror's laws, preserved by Ingulf, seems to have been the herriot; since reliefs, as well as the other burdens of the feudal law, were unknown in the age of the Confessor, whose laws these originally were.</NOTE>; and it is evident,
that the general promise here given, of accepting a just
and lawful relief, ought to have been reduced to more
precision, in order to give security to the subject. The
oppression of wardship and marriage was perpetuated
even till the age of Charles II.: And it appears from

his time, where any man died intestate, an accident
which must be very frequent, when the art of writing

pretended to seize all the moveables, and to exclude
every heir, even the children of the deceased: A sure
mark of a tyrannical and arbitrary government.</P>
<P>THE Normans indeed, settled in England, were,
during this age, so violent and licentious a people, that
they may be pronounced incapable of any true or regular
liberty; which requires such a refinement of laws and
institutions, such a comprehension of views, such a senti∣ment
of honour, such a spirit of obedience, and such a
sacrifice of private interest and connexions to public or∣der,
as can only be the result of great reflection and ex∣perience,
and must grow to perfection during several ages
of a settled and established government. A people, so
insensible to the rights of their sovereign, as to disjoint,
<PB N="339" REF="371"/>
without necessity, the hereditary succession, and permit a
younger brother to intrude himself into the place of the
elder, whom they esteemed, and who was guilty of no
crime but being absent, could not expect, that that
prince would pay any greater regard to their privileges,
or allow his engagements to fetter his power, and debar
him from any considerable interest or convenience. They
had indeed arms in their hands, which prevented the
establishment of a total despotism, and left their posterity
sufficient power, whenever they should attain a sufficient
degree of reason, to acquire true liberty: But their tur∣bulent
disposition prompted them frequently to make such
use of their arms, that they were more fitted to obstruct
the execution of justice, than to stop the career of violence
and oppression. The prince, finding, that greater oppo∣sition
was often made to him when he enforced the laws,
than when he violated them, was apt to render his own
will and pleasure the sole rule of government, and on
every emergence to consider more the power of the per∣sons
whom he might offend, than the rights of those
whom he might injure. The very form of this charter
of Henry proves, that the Norman barons (for they,
rather than the people of England, are chiefly concerned
in it) were totally ignorant of the nature of limited mo∣narchy,
and were ill qualified to conduct, in conjunction
with their sovereign, the machine of government. It
is an act of his sole power, is the result of his free grace,
implies several articles which bind others as well as
himself, and is therefore unfit to be the deed of any one
who possesses not the whole legislative power, and who
may not at pleasure revoke all his concessions.</P>
<P>KING Henry, farther to increase his popularity, de∣graded
and committed to prison Ralph Flambard, bishop
of Durham, who had been the chief instrument of op∣pression
<PB N="340" REF="372"/>
employed by his brother<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 208. W. Malm. p 156. Matth. Paris, p. 39. Alur. Beverl. p. 144.</NOTE>: But this act was
followed by another, which was a direct violation of his
own charter, and was a bad prognostic of his sincere intentions to observe it: He kept the see of Durham
vacant for five years, and during that time retained pos∣session of all its revenues. Sensible of the great autho∣rity,
which Anselm had acquired by his character of
piety, and by the persecutions which he had undergone
from William, he sent repeated messages to him at Lyons,
where he resided, and invited him to return and take pos∣session of his dignities<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 208. Order. Vital. p. 783. Matth. Paris, p. 39. T. Rudborne, p. 273.</NOTE>. On the arrival of the prelate,
he proposed to him the renewal of that homage which
he had done his brother, and which had never been refu∣sed
by any English bishop: But Anselm had acquired
other sentiments by his journey to Rome, and gave the
King an absolute refusal. He objected the decrees of
the council of Bari, at which he himself had assisted;
and he declared, that so far from doing homage for his
spiritual dignity, he would not so much as communicate
with any ecclesiastic who paid that submission, or who
accepted of investitures from laymen. Henry, who pro∣posed
in his present delicate situation, to reap great ad∣vantages
from the authority and popularity of Anselm,
dared not to quarrel with him by insisting on his demand<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 225.</NOTE>:
He only desired that the controversy might be suspended;
and that messengers might be sent to Rome, to accom∣modate
matters with the Pope, and to obtain his confirmation
of the laws and customs of England.</P>
<P>THERE immediately occurred an important affair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the King</NOTE> in
which the King was obliged to have recourse to the
<PB N="341" REF="373"/>
authority of Anselm. Matilda, daughter of Malcolm III.
King of Scotland, and niece to Edgar Atheling, had,
on her father's death, and the subsequent revolutions of
the Scottish government, been, brought up to England,
and educated under her aunt, Christina, in the nunnery
of Rumsey. This princess Henry proposed to marry;
but as she had worn, the veil, tho' never taken the vows,
doubts might arise concerning the lawfulness of the act;
and it behoved him to be very careful not to shock, in any
particular, the religious prejudices of his subjects. The
affair was examined by Anselm in a council of the pre∣lates
and nobles, which was summoned at Lambeth;
and Matilda there proved, that she had put on the veil,
not with a view of entering into a religious life, but
merely in imitation of a custom, familiar to the English
ladies, who protected their chastity from the brutal vio∣lence
of the Normans, by taking shelter under that
habit<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 57.</NOTE>, which, amidst the horrible licentiousness of
the times, was generally revered. The council, sensible
that even a princess bad otherwise no security for her ho∣nour,
admitted this reason as valid: They pronounced,
that Matilda was still free to marry<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and her espousals
with Henry were celebrated by Anselm with great pomp
and solemnity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 468.</NOTE>. No act of the King's reign rendered
him equally popular with his English subjects, and tended
more to establish him on the throne. Tho' Matilda,
during the life of her uncle and brothers, was not the
heir of the Saxon line, she was become very dear to the
English, on account of her connexions with it: And
that people, who, before the conquest, had fallen into
a kind of indifference towards their antient royal family,
had felt so severely the tyranny of the Normans, that
they reflected with infinite regret on their former liberty,
and hoped for a more equal and mild administration,
<PB N="342" REF="374"/>
when the blood of their native princes should be united
with that of their new sovereigns<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the policy and prudence of Henry, which, if
time had been allowed for these virtues to operate their
full effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion by duke Ro∣bert.</NOTE> would have secured him possession of the crown,
ran great hazard of being frustrated by the sudden ap∣pearance
of Robert, who returned to Normandy about a
month after the death of his brother William. He took
possession, without resistance, of that dutchy; and imme∣diately
made preparations for recovering England, of
which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1101.</NOTE> during his absence, he had, by Henry's intrigues,
been so unjustly defrauded. The great fame which he
had acquired in the East forwarded his pretensions; and
the Norman barons, sensible of the consequences, expres∣sed
the same discontent at the separation of the dutchy
and kingdom, which had appeared on the accession of
William. Robert de Belesme, earl of Shrewsbury and
Arundel, William de la Warenne, earl of Surrey,
Arnulf de Montgomery, Walter Giffard, Robert de
Pontefract, Robert de Mallet, Yvo de Grentmesnil, and
many others of the principal nobility<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 785.</NOTE>, invited him to
make an attempt on England, and promised, on his
landing, to join him with all their forces. Even the
seamen were affected with the general popularity of his
name, and they carried over to him the greatest part of
a fleet, which had been equipped to oppose his passage<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 209. Hoveden, p. 469. M. Paris, p. 40. Ann. Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rl▪ p. 143. Erompton, p. 998. Flor. Wigorn, p. 650.</NOTE>.
Henry, in this extremity, began to be apprehensive for
his life, as well as for his crown; and had recourse to
the superstition of the people, in order to oppose their
sentiment of justice. He paid diligent court to Anselm,
whose sanctity and wisdom he pretended to revere. He
consulted him in all difficult emergencies; seemed to be
<PB N="343" REF="375"/>
governed by him in every measure; promised a strict re∣gard
to ecclesiastical privileges; professed a great attach∣ment
to Rome, and a resolution of persevering in an im∣plicit
obedience to the decrees of councils, and to the
will of the sovereign pontiff. By these caresses and de∣clarations,
he gained entirely the confidence of the pri∣mate,
whose influence over the people, and authority
with the barons, was of the highest service to him; in his
present situation. Anselm scrupled not to assure the
nobles of the King's sincerity in those professions which
he made, of avoiding the tyrannical and oppressive go∣vernment
of his father and brother<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 225.</NOTE>: He even rode
thro' the ranks of the army, recommended to the soldi∣ers
the defence of their prince, represented the duty of
keeping their oaths of allegiance, and prognosticated to
them all happiness from the government of so wise and
just a sovereign<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 59. W. Malm. p. 156.</NOTE>. By this expedient, joined to the in∣fluence
of the earls of Warwic and Mellent, of Roger
Bigod, Richard de Redvers, and Robert Fitz-Hamon,
powerful barons, who still adhered to the present govern∣ment<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 783.</NOTE>, the army were retained in the King's interests,
and marched, with an appearance of union and firmness,
to oppose Robert, who had landed with his forces at Portsmouth.</P>
<P>THE two armies were in sight of each other for some
days without coming to action; and both princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accommo∣dation with Robert.</NOTE> being
apprehensive of the event, which would probably be de∣cisive,
hearkened the more willingly to the mediation of
Anselm and other great men, who proposed an accom∣modation
between them. After employing some nego∣tiation,
it was agreed, that Robert should resign his pre∣tensions
to England, and receive in lieu of it an an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al
pension of 3000 marks; that if either of the princes
<PB N="344" REF="376"/>
died without issue, the other should succeed to his domi∣nions;
that the adherents of each should be pardoned,
and restored to all their possessions either in Normandy or
England; and that neither Robert nor Henry should
thenceforth encourage, receive, or protect the enemies of
the other<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 209. W. Malm. p. 156. H. Hunt. p. 278. Hoveden, p. 469. Order. Vital. p. 788.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1102.</NOTE> tho' calculated so much for Henry's ad∣vantage,
he was the first who violated. He restored in∣deed
the estates of all Robert's adherents; but was se∣cretly
determined, that noblemen so powerful and so ill
affected, who had both inclination and ability to disturb
his government, should not long remain unmolested in
their present grandeur and opulence. He began with the
earl of Shrewsbury, who was watched for some time by
spies, and then indicted on a charge, consisting of forty-five
articles. This turbulent nobleman, knowing his
own guilt, as well as the prejudices of his judges
and the power of his accuser, had recourse to arms for
defence; but being soon suppressed by the activity
and address of Henry, he was banished the kingdom, and
his great estate was confiscated<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 210. W. Malm. p. 156, 157. Hoveden, p. 469. Order. Vital. p. 806, 807, 808.</NOTE>. His ruin involved that
of his two brothers, Arnulf de Montgomery, and Roger
earl of Lancaster. Soon after followed the prosecution
and condemnation of Robert de Pontefract and Robert
de Mallet, who had distinguished themselves among
Robert's adherents<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 805.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1103.</NOTE> William de Warenne was the
next victim: Even William earl of Cornwal, son to the
earl of Mortaigne, the King's uncle, having afforded
matter of suspicion against him, lost all the vast acquisi∣tions
<PB N="345" REF="377"/>
of his family in England<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 212. W. Malm. p. 157. Hoveden, p. 470.</NOTE>. Tho' the usual vio∣lence
and tyranny of the Norman barons afforded a plau∣sible
pretence for those prosecutions, and it is probable
that none of the sentences, pronounced against these
noblemen, was wholly iniquitous; men easily saw or
conjectured, that the chief part of their guilt was not
the injustice or illegality of their conduct. Robert, en∣raged
at the fate of his friends, imprudently ventured to
come into England, and remonstrated with his brother,
in severe terms, against the breach of treaty: But met
with such a bad reception, that he began to apprehend
danger, to his own liberty, and was glad to purchase an
escape, by resigning his pension<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 211. W. Malm. p. 156. Gul. Gem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. p. 298. Order. Vital. p. 804. M. Paris, p. 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE indiscretion of Robert soon exposed him to more
fatal injuries. This prince, whose bravery and candor
procured him respect, while at a distance, had no sooner
attained the possession of power, and enjoyment of peace,
than all the vigour of his mind relaxed, and he fell into
contempt among those who approached his person, or
were subjected to his authority.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attack of Normandy.</NOTE> Abandoned alternately
so dissolute pleasures and to womanish superstition, he
was so remiss, both in the care of his treasure and the

money with impunity, even stole from him his very
cloaths, and proceeded thence to practice every species
of extortion on his defenceless subjects<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 814, 815.</NOTE>. The barons,
whom a severe administration alone could have restrain∣ed,
gave reins to their unbounded rapine upon their vas∣sals,
and inveterate animosities against each other; and
all Normandy, during the reign of this benign prince,
was become a scene of violence and depredation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 154. 157. Gul. Gemet. p. 298. Order. Vital. p. 814.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="346" REF="378"/>
Normans at last, remarking the regular government,
which Henry, notwithstanding his usurped title, had
been, able to establish in England, applied to him, that
he might use his authority for the suppression of these
disorders; and they thereby afforded him a pretence for
interpo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in the affairs of Normandy<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 154. 157. Gul. Neubr. lib. 1. cap. 3. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 60.</NOTE>. Instead of em∣ploying
his mediation, to render his brother's govern∣ment
respectable, or redressing the grievances of the Nor∣mans;
he was only attentive to support his own parti∣zans,
and to encrease their number by every art of bri∣bery,
intrigue, and insinuation. Having found, in a
visit, which he made to that dutchy, that the nobility
were more disposed to pay submission to him than to their
legal sovereign; he collected, by very arbitrary extor∣tions
on England, a great army and treasure<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 83.</NOTE>, and re∣turned
next year to Normandy, in a situation to obtain,
eithier by violence or corruption, the dominion of that
province.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1105.</NOTE> He took Bayeux by storm after an obstinate
frege: He made himself master of Caen by the voluntary
submission of the inhabitants: But being repulsed at Fa∣laise,
and obliged, by the winter season, to raise the
siege, he returned into England; after giving assurances
to his adherents, that he would persevere in supporting
and protecting them.</P>
<P>NEXT year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1106.</NOTE> he opened the campaign with the siege of
Tenchebray;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conquest of Normandy.</NOTE> and it became evident, from his prepa∣rations
and progress, that he intended to usurp the entire
possession of Normandy. Robert was at last rouzed from
his lethargy; and, being supported by the earl of Mor∣taigne
and Robert de Bellesme, the King's inveterate
enemies, he raised a considerable army, and approached
his brother's camp, with a view of finishing, in one de∣cisive
<PB N="347" REF="379"/>
battle, the quarrel between them. He was now
entered on that scene of action, in which alone he was
qualified to excel; and he so animated the Norman
troops by his example, that they made a great impression
on the English, and had nearly obtained the victory<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 379. M. Paris, p. 43. Brompton, p. 1002.</NOTE>;
when the flight of Bellesme threw them into dismay,
and occasioned their tocal defeat. Henry, besides exe∣cuting
great slaughter on the enemy, made near ten
thousand prisoners; among whom was duke Robert
himself, and all the most considerable barons, who ad∣hered
to his interests<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 90. Chron. Sax. p. 214. Order. Vital. P. 821.</NOTE>. This victory was followed by
the final reduction of Normandy: Roüen immediately
submitted to the cbnqueror: Falaise, after some nego∣tiation,
opened its gates; and by this acquisition, besides
rendering himself master of an important fortress, he got
into his hands prince William, the only son and heir of
Robert: He assembled the states of Normandy; and
having received the homage of all the vassals of the
dutchy, settled the government, revoked his brother's
donations, and dismantled the castles, lately built, he re∣turned
into England, and carried along with him the
duke as a prisoner. That unfortunate prince was detained
in custody during the remainder of his life, which was
no less than twenty-eight years, and he died in the castle
of Cardiff in Glamorganshire; happy, if, without losing
his liberty, he could have relinquished that power,
which he was not qualified either to hold or exercise.
Prince William was committed to the care of Helie de
St. Saen, who had married Robert's natural daughter,
and who, being a man of probity and honour, more
than was usual in those ages, executed the trust with
great affection and fidelity. Edgar Atheling, who had
followed Robert in the expedition to Jerusalem, and
<PB N="348" REF="380"/>
who had lived with him ever since in Normandy, was
another illustrious prisoner, taken in the battle of Ten∣chebray<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 214. Ann. Waverl. p. 144.</NOTE>. Henry gave him his liberty, and settled a
small pension on him, with which he retired; and he
lived to a good old age in England, totally neglected and
forgotten. This prince was distinguished by personal
bravery; but nothing can be a stronger proof of his
mean talents in every other respect, than that, notwith∣standing
he possessed the affections of the English, and
enjoyed the only legal title to the throne, he was allow∣ed,
during the reigns of so many violent and jealous
usurpers, to live unmolested, and go to his grave in
peace.</P>
<P>A LITTLE after Henry had compleated the conquest of
Normandy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1107.</NOTE> and settled the government of that province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continua∣tion of the quarrel with An∣selm the primate.</NOTE>
he finished a controversy, which had been long depend∣ing
between him and the Pope, with regard to the in∣vestitures in ecclesiastical benefices; and tho' he was
here obliged to relinquish some of the antient rights of
the crown, he extricated himself from the difficulty on
easier terms than most princes, who in that age were so
unhappy as to be engaged in disputes with the apostolic
see. The King's situation, in the beginning of his reign,
obliged him to pay great court to Anselm; and the ad∣vantages,
which he had reaped from the zealous friend∣ship
of that prelate, had made him sensible how prone
the minds of his people were to superstition, and what
an ascendant the ecclesiastics had been able to assume
over them. He had seen, on the accession of his brother
Rufus, that, tho' the rights of primogeniture were then
violated, and the inclinations of almost all the barons
opposed, yet the authority of Lanfranc had prevailed
over all other considerations; and his own case, which
<PB N="349" REF="381"/>
was still more unfavourable, afforded an instance, in
which the clergy could show more evidently their in∣fluence
and authority. These recent examples, while
they made him cautious not to offend that powerful body,
convinced him, at the same, time, that it was extremely
his interest, to retain the former prerogative of the
crown in filling offices of such vast importance, and to
check the ecclesiastics in that independance, to which
they evidently aspired. The choice, which his brother,
in a fit of penitence, had made of Anselm, was so far
unfortunate to the King's pretensions, that that prelate
was celebrated for his piety and zeal and austerity of
manners; and tho' his monkish devotion and narrow
principles prognosticated no great knowledge of the
world nor depth of policy, he was, on that very ac∣count,
a more dangerous instrument in the hands of po∣liticians,
and retained a greater ascendant over the bi∣gotted
populace. The prudence and temper of the King
appear in nothing more conspicuous than in the manage∣ment
of this delicate affair; where he was always sen∣sible
that it had become necessary for him to risque his
whole crown, in order to preserve the most invaluable
jewel of it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 56.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANSELM had no sooner returned from banishment,
than his rcfusal to do homage to the King excited a dif∣pute,
which Henry evaded at that critical juncture, by
promising to send a messenger, in order to compound
the matter with Pascal the second, who then filled the
papal chair. The messenger, as was probably foreseen,
returned with an absolute refusal of the King's de∣mands<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 225.</NOTE>; and that fortified by many reasons, which were
well qualified to operate on the understandings of men
in those ages. Pascal quoted the scriptures to prove that
Christ was the door; and he thence inferred, that all

<PB N="349" REF="383"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="350" REF="384" MS="y"/>
ecclesiastics must enter into the church thro' Christ alone,
not thro' the civil magistrate, or any profane laymen<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 60. This topic is farther enforced in p. 73, 74. W. Malm. p. 163.</NOTE>.
“It is monstrous,” added the pontiff, “<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>that a son
should pretend to beget his father, or a man to create
his God: Priests are called gods in scripture, as
being the vicars of God: And will you, by your abo∣minable
pretensions to grant them their investiture,
assume the right of creating them?”<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 61. I much suspect, that this text of seripture is a forgery of his holiness: For I have not been able to find it. Yet it passed current in those ages, and was often quoted by the clergy as the foundation of their power. See Epist. St. Thom. p. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT however convincing these arguments, they could
not persuade Henry to resign so important a prerogative;
and perhaps, as he was possessed of great reflection and
learning, he thought, that the absurdity of a man's cre∣ating
his God, even allowing priests to be gods, was
not urged with the best grace by the Roman pontiff.
But as he desired still to avoid, or at least to delay, the
coming to any dangerous extremity with the church, he
persuaded Anselm, that he would be able, by farther ne∣gociation,
to attain some composition with Pascal; and
for that purpose, he dispatched three bishops to Rome,
while Anselm sent two messengers of his own, to be
more fully assured of the Pope's intentions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 62. W. Malm. p. 225.</NOTE>. Pascal
wrote back letters equally positive and arrogant both to
the King and primate; urging to the former, that, by
assuming the right of investitures, he committed a kind
of spiritual adultery with the church, who was the spouse
of Christ, and who must not admit of such a commerce
with any other person<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eadm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, p. 63.</NOTE>; and insisting with the latter,
that the pretensions of Kings to confer benefices was the
<PB N="351" REF="385"/>
source of all simony; a topic which had but too much
foundation in those ages<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 64. 66.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY had now no other expedient than to suppress
the letter addressed to himself, and to persuade the three
bishops to prevaricate, and assert, upon their episcopal
faith, that Pascal had assured them in private of his good
intentions towards Henry, and of his resolution not to
resent any future exertion of his prerogative in granting
investitures; tho' he himself scrupled to give this assur∣ance
under his hand, left other princes should copy the
example and assume a like privilege<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 65. W. Malm. p. 225.</NOTE>. Anselm's two
messengers, who were monks, affirmed to him, that it
was imposible this story could have any foundation;
but their word was not esteemed equivalent to that of
three bishops; and the King, as if he had finally gained
his cause, proceeded to fill the sees of Hereford and Sa∣lisbury,
and to invest the new bishops in the usual man∣ner<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 66. W. Malm. p. 225. Hoveden, p. 469. Sim. Dunelm. p. 228.</NOTE>.
But Anselm, who, as he had good reason, gave
no credit to the asseveration of the King's messengers,
refused not only to consecrate them, but even to com∣municate
with them; and the bishops themselves, find∣ing
how odious they had become, returned back to Henry
the ensigns of their dignity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 470. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 59. Flor. Wigorn. p. 651.</NOTE>. The quarrel every day
encreased between the King and the primate: The for∣mer,
notwithstanding the great prudence and modera∣tion
of his temper, threw out menaces against all such
as should pretend to oppse him in exerting the antient
prerogatives of his crown: And Anselm, sensible of his
disagreeable and dangerous situation, desired leave to

the sovereign pontiff<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 70. W. Malm. p. 226.</NOTE>. Henry, well pleased to rid him∣self
<PB N="352" REF="386"/>
without violence of so inflexible an antagonist, readily
granted him permission; and Anselm set out on his
journey. He was attended to the sea-coast by infinite
multitudes, not only monks and clergymen, but people of
all ranks, who scrupled not in this manner to declare
for their primate against their sovereign, and who re∣garded
his departure as the final abolition of religion
and true piety in the kingdom<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 71.</NOTE>. The King, however,
confiscated all the revenues of his see; and sent William
de Warelwast to negociate with Pascal, and to find some
means of accommodation in this delicate affair<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 226.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English minister told Pascal, that his master
would rather lose his crown than part with the right of
granting investitures. “And I,” replied Pascal, “would
rather lose my head than allow him to retain it<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 73. W. Malm. p. 226. M. Paris, p. 40.</NOTE>.”
Henry secretly prohibited Anselm to return, unless he re∣solved
to conform himself to the laws and usages of the
kingdom; and the primate took up his residence at
Lyons<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 75. W. Malm. p. 226. M. Paris, p. 41. Chron. Dunstaple, p. 18.</NOTE>, in expectation, that the King would at last be
obliged to yield the point, which was the present object
of controversy between them. Soon after, he was al∣lowed
to return to his monastery at Bec in Normandy;
and Henry, besides restoring to him the revenues of his
see, treated him with the greatest respect, and held se∣veral
conferences with him, in order to soften his oppo∣sition,
and bend him to submission<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 471.</NOTE>. The people of
England, who thought all differences now accommodat∣ed,
were inclined to blame their primate for absenting
himself so long from his charge; and he daily received
letters from his partizans, representing the necessity of
his speedy return. The total extinction, they told him,
of religion and Christianity was likely to ensue from the
<PB N="353" REF="387" MS="y"/>
want of his fatherly care: The most shocking customs
prevail in England: And the dread of his severity being
now removed, sodomy and the practice of wearing long
hair gain ground among all ranks of men, and these
enormities openly appear every where, without sense of
shame or fear of punishment<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 81.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE policy of the court of Rome has been commonly
much admired; and men, judging by success, have be∣stowed
the highest eulogies on that prudence, by which
a power, from such slender beginnings, could advance,
without force of arms, to establish an universal and al∣most
absolute monarchy in Europe. But the wisdom of
such a long succession of men, who filled the papal
throne, and who were of such different ages, tempers,
and interests, is not intelligible, and could never have
place in nature. The instrument, indeed, with which
they wrought, the ignorance and superstition of the
people, is so gross an engine, of such universal preva∣lence,
and so little liable to accident or disorder, that it
may be successful even in the most unskilful hands; and
scarce any indiscretion can frustrate its operations.
While the court of Rome was openly abandoned to the
most flagrant disorders, even while it was torn with
schisms and factions, the power of the church made daily
a sensible progress in Europe; and the temerity of Gregory
and the caution of Pascal were equally fortunate in
promoting it. The clergy, feeling the necessity of pro∣tection
against the violence of princes, or vigour of the
laws, were well pleased to adhere to a foreign head,
who, being removed from the fear of the civil authority,
could freely employ the power of the whole church in
defending their antient or usurped properties and privi∣leges,
when invaded in any particular country: The
monks, desirous of an independance on their diocesans,
<PB N="354" REF="388"/>
professed still a more devoted attachment to the triple
crown; and the stupid people possessed no science nor
reason, which they could oppose to the most exorbitant
pretensions. Nonsense passed for demonstration: The
most criminal means were sanctified by the piety of the
end: Treaties were not supposed to be binding where
the interests of God were concerned: The antient laws
and customs of states had no authority against a divine
right: Impudent forgeries were received as authentic
monuments of antiquity: And the champions of holy
church, if successful, were celebrated as heroes; if un∣fortunate,
were worshiped as martyrs; and all events
thus turned out equally to the advantage of clerical usur∣pations.
Pascal himself, the present Pope, was, in the
course of this very controversy concerning investitures,
involved in circumstances, and necessitated to follow a
conduct, which would have drawn disgrace and ruin on
any temporal prince, that had been so unfortunate as to
fall into a like situation. His person was seized by the
Emperor Henry V. and he was obliged, by a formal
treaty, to resign to that monarch the right of granting
investitures, for which they had so long contended<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 167.</NOTE>. In
order to add greater solemnity to this agreement, the
Emperor and Pope communicated together on the same
hoste; one half of which was given to the prince, the
other taken by the pontiff: The most tremendous im∣precations
were publicly denounced on either of them
who should violate the treaty: Yet no sooner did Pascal
recover his liberty, than he recalled all his concessions,
and pronounced the sentence of excommunication against
the Emperor, who, in the end, was obliged to submit
to the terms required of him, and to yield up all his pre∣tensions,
which he could never recall<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo sopra benef. eccles. p. 112. W. Malmes. p. 170. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 63. Sim. Dunelm. p. 233.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="389"/>
THE King of England had very nearly fallen into the
same dangerous situation: Pascal had already excommu∣nicated
the earl of Meulent, and the other ministers of
Henry, who were instrumental in supporting his preten∣sions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 79.</NOTE>:
He daily menaced the King himself with a like
sentence; and he suspended the blow only to give him
leisure to escape it by a timely submission. The male∣contents
waited impatiently for the opportunity of dis∣turbing
his government by conspiracies and insurrec∣tions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 80.</NOTE>:
The King's greatest friends were anxious at the
prospect of an incident, which would set their religious
and civil duties at variance with each other: And the
countess of Blois, his sister, a princess of piety, who had
great influence over him, was affrighted with the danger
of her brother's eternal damnation<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 79.</NOTE>. Henry, on the
other hand, seemed determined to run all hazards, rather
than resign a prerogative of such importance, which had
been enjoyed by all his predecessors; and it seemed pro∣bable,
from his great prudence and ability, that he
might be able to sustain his rights, and finally prevail in
the contest. While Pascal and Henry thus stood mu∣tually
in awe of each other, it was the more easy to
bring about an accommodation between them, and to
find a medium, in which they might both agree.</P>
<P>BEFORE bishops took possession of their dignities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compromise with Anselm.</NOTE> they
had formerly been accustomed to pass thro' two ceremo∣nials:
They received from the hands of the sovereign a
ring and crosier, as symbols of their office; and this was
called their <HI>investiture:</HI> They also made those submissions
to the prince, required of vassals by the rites of the
feudal law, which received the name of <HI>homage.</HI> And
as the King might refuse both to grant the <HI>investiture</HI>
and to receive the <HI>homage,</HI> tho' the chapter had, by some
<PB N="356" REF="390"/>
canons of the middle age, been endowed with the right
of election, the sovereign had in reality the sole power
of appointing prelates. Urban II. had equally deprived
laymen of the rights of granting investiture and of re∣ceiving homage<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 91. W. Malm. p. 163. Sim. Dunelm. p. 230.</NOTE>: The Emperors never were able, by
all their wars and negotiations, to make any distinction
be admitted between them: The interposition of pro∣fane
laymen, in any particular, was still represented as
impious and abominable: And the church openly aspired
to a total independance on the state. But Henry had
put England, as well as Normandy, in such a situation
as gave greater weight to his negotiations; and Pascal
was for the present contented with his resigning the right
of granting investitures, by which the spiritual dignity
was supposed to be conferred; and he allowed the bishops
to do homage for their temporal properties and privi∣leges<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 91. W. Malm. p. 164. 227. Hoveden, p. 471. M. Paris, p. 43. T. Rudh. p. 274. Brompton, p. 1000. Wilkins, p. 303. Chron. Dunst. p. 21.</NOTE>.
The pontiff was well pleased to have made this
acquisition, which, he hoped, would in time involve the
whole: And the King, anxious to procure an escape
from a very dangerous situation, was contented to re∣tain
some, tho' a more precarious authority, in the elec∣tion
of prelates.</P>
<P>AFTER the principal controversy was accommodated,
it was not difficult to adjust the other differences. The
Pope allowed Anselm to communicate with the prelates,
who had already received investitures from the crown;
and he only required of them some submissions for their
past, misconduct<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 87.</NOTE>. He also granted Anselm a plenary
power of remedying every other disorder, which, he said,
might arise from the barbarousness of the country<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 91.</NOTE>.
Such was the idea which the Popes then entertained of
<PB N="357" REF="391"/>
the English; and nothing can be a stronger proof of the
miserable ignorance in which that people were then
plunged, than that a man, who sat on the papal throne,
and who subsisted by absurdities and nonsense, should
think himself intitled to treat them as barbarians.</P>
<P>DURING the course of these controversies, a synod was
held at Westminster, where the King, intent only on
the main dispute, allowed some canons of less conse∣quence
to be enacted, which tended to promote the usur∣pations
of the clergy. The marriage of priests was pro∣hibited;
a point which it was still found very difficult to
carry into execution: And even laymen were not al∣lowed
to marry within the seventh degree of affinity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 67, 68. Spelm. Conc. vol. ii. p. 22.</NOTE>.
By this contrivance, the Pope augmented the profits,
which he reaped from granting dispensations; and like∣wise
those from divorces. For as the art of writing was
then rare, and parish registers were not then regularly
kept, it was not easy to ascertain the degrees of affinity
even among people of rank; and any man, who had
money sufficient to pay for it, might obtain a divorce,
on pretence that his wife was more nearly related to
him than was permitted by the canons. The synod also
passed a vote, prohibiting the laity to wear long hair<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 68.</NOTE>.
The aversion of the clergy to this mode was not con∣fined
to England. When the King went over to Nor∣mandy,
before he had conquered that province, the
bishop of Seez, in a formal harangue, earnestly applied
to him to redress the manifold disorders under which the
government laboured, and to oblige the people to poll
their hair in a decent form. Henry, tho' he would not
resign his prerogatives to the church, was very willing
to part with his hair: He cut it in the form which they
<PB N="358" REF="392"/>
required of him, and obliged all the courtiers to imitate
his example<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 816.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE acquisition of Normandy was a great point of
Henry's ambition; being the antient patrimony of his
family, and the only territory, which, while in his pos∣session,
gave him any weight or consideration on the con∣tinent:
But the injustice of his usurpation was the
source of great inquietude, involved him in frequent
wars, and obliged him to impose on his English subjects
those many heavy and arbitrary taxes, of which all the
historians of that age unanimously complain<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 83. Chron. Sax. p. 211, 212, 213. 219, 220, 228. H. Hunt. p. 380. Hoveden, p. 470. Ann. Waverl. p. 143.</NOTE>. His ne∣phew,
William, was but six years of age, when he
committed him to the care of Helie de St. Saen; and it
is probable, that his reason for intrusting that important
charge to a man of such an unblemished character, was
to prevent all malignant suspicions, in case any accident
should be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al the life of the young prince.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1110.</NOTE> He soon re∣pented him of this choice; but when he desired to re∣cover
possession of William's person, Helie withdrew
his pupil, and carried him to the court of Fulk, count
of Anjou, who gave him protection<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 837.</NOTE>. In proportion
as the young prince grew up to man's estate, he dis∣covered
virtues suitable to his birth; and wandering
thro' different courts of Europe, excited the friendly
compassion of many princes, and raised a general indig∣nation
against his uncle, who had so unjustly bereaved
him of his inheritance. Lewis the Gross, son of Philip,
was at this time King of France, a brave and generous
prince, who having been obliged, during the lifetime of
his father, to fly into England, in order to escape the
persecutions of his stepmother, Bertrude, had been pro∣tected
<PB N="359" REF="393"/>
by Henry, and had thence conceived a personal
friendship for him. But these ties were soon dissolved
after the accession of Lewis, who found his interests to
be in so many particulars opposite to those of the Eng∣lish
monarch, and who became sensible of the danger
attending the annexation of Normandy to England. He
joined, therefore, the counts of Anjou and Flanders
in giving disquiet to Henry's government; and this mo∣narch,
in order to defend his foreign dominions, found
himself obliged to go over to Normandy, where he re∣sided
two years. The war which ensued among these
princes was attended with no memorable transaction,
and produced only slight skirmishes on the frontiers,
agreeable to the weak condition of the sovereigns in that
age, whenever their subjects were not rouzed by some
great and urgent occasion. Henry, by contracting his
eldest son, William, to the daughter of Fulk<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 221. W. Malm. p. 160. Knyghton, p. 2380.</NOTE>, detached
that prince from the alliance, and obliged the others to
come to an accommodation with him. This peace was
not of long duration. His nephew, William, retired to
the court of Baldwin, earl of Flanders, who espoused
his cause; and the King of France, having soon after,
for other reasons, joined the party, a new war was
kindled in Normandy, which produced no event more
memorable than had attended the former.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1118.</NOTE> At last the
death of Baldwin, who was slain in an action near Eu,
gave some respite to Henry, and enabled him to carry
on war with more advantage against his enemies<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 222. H. Hunt. p. 380. Order. Vital. p. 843. M. Paris, p. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEWIS, finding himself unable to wrest Normandy
from the King by force of arms, had recourse to the
dangerous expedient, of applying to the spiritual power,
and of affording the ecclesiastics a pretence to interpose
<PB N="360" REF="394"/>
in the temporal interests of princes. He carried young
William to a general council, which was assembled at
Rheims by Pope Calixtus II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1119.</NOTE> presented the Norman
prince to them, complained of the manifest usurpation
and injustice of Henry, craved the assistance of the
church for reinstating the true heir in his dominions,
and represented the enormity of detaining in prison so
brave a prince as Robert, one of the most eminent cham∣pions
of the cross, and who by that very quality was
placed under the immediate protection of the holy see<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 858.</NOTE>.
Henry knew how to defend the rights of his crown with
vigour, and yet with dexterity. He had sent over the
English bishops to this synod; but at the same time had
warned them, that, if any farther claims were started
by the Pope or the ecclesiastics, he was determined to
adhere to the laws and customs of England, and main∣tain
the prerogatives transmitted to him by his ancestors.
“Go,” said he to them, “salute the Pope in my name,
hear his apostolical precepts; but take care to bring
none of his new inventions into my kingdom.” Find∣ing,
however, that it would be easier for him to elude
than oppose the efforts of Calixtus, he gave his am∣bassadors
orders to gain the Pope and his favourites by
liberal presents and promises. The complaints of the
Norman prince were thenceforth heard with great cold∣ness
by the council; and Calixtus confessed, after a
conference, which he had the same summer with Henry,
that, of all men, whom he had ever yet been acquaint∣ed
with, he was beyond comparison the most eloquent
and persuasive.</P>
<P>THE warlike measures of Lewis proved as meffectual
as his intrigues. He had laid a scheme for surprizing
Noyon; but Henry, having received intelligence of the
design, marched to the relief of the place, and suddenly
<PB N="361" REF="395"/>
attacked the French at Andeley, as they were advanc∣ing
to Noyon. A sharp action ensued; where William,
the son of Robert, behaved with great bravery, and the
King himself was in the most imminent danger. He
was wounded in the head by Crispin, a gallant Norman
officer, who had followed the fortunes of William<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 381. M. Paris, p. 47. Diceto, p. 503. Bromp∣ton, p. 1007. M. West, p. 239.</NOTE>;
but being rather animated than terrified by the blow,
he immediately beat his antagonist to the ground, and so
encouraged his troops by the example, that they put the
French to total rout, and had very nearly taken their
King prisoner. The dignity of the persons, engaged in
this skirmish, rendered it the most memorable action of
the war: For in other respects, it was not of great im∣portance.
There were nine hundred horsemen, who
fought on both sides; yet were there only three persons
slain. The rest were defended by that heavy armour,
worn by the cavalry in those times<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 854.</NOTE>. An accommoda∣tion
soon after ensued between the Kings of France
and England; and the interests of young William were
entirely neglected in it.</P>
<P>BUT this public prosperity of Henry was much over∣balanced
by a domestic calamity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1120.</NOTE> which befel him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of prince Wil∣liam.</NOTE> His
only son, William, had now reached his eighteenth
year; and the King, from the facility, with which he
himself had usurped the crown, dreading, that a like
revolution might subvert his family, had taken care to
have him recognized his successor by the states of the
kingdom<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 165.</NOTE>, and had carried him over to Normandy, to
receive the homage of the barons of that dutchy. On
his return, he set sail from Barfleur, and was soon car∣ried
by a fair wind out of sight of land. The prince
was detained by some accident; and his sailors, as well
<PB N="362" REF="396"/>
as their captain, Thomas Fitz-Stephens, having spent
the interval in drinking, were so flustered, that, being
in a hurry to follow the King, they heedlessly carried
the ship on a rock, where she immediately foundered<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 868.</NOTE>.
The prince was put into the long boat, and had got
clear of the ship; when hearing the cries of his natural
sister, the countess of Perche, he ordered the seamen to
row back in hopes of saving her: But the numbers, who
crowded in, soon sunk the boat; and the prince with
all his retinue perished<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 165. H. Hunt. p. 381. Hoveden, p. 476. Brompton, p. 1012.</NOTE>. Above an hundred and forty
young noblemen, of the principal families of England
and Normandy, were lost on this occasion. A butcher
of Roüen was the only person on board who escaped<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dunelm. p. 242. Alured Beverl. p. 148.</NOTE>:
He clung to the mast, and was taken up next morning
by fishermen. Fitz-Stephens, the captain, took hold
also of the mast; but being informed by the butcher,
that prince William had perished, he said, that he
would not survive the disaster; and he threw himself
headlong into the sea<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 868.</NOTE>. Henry entertained hopes for
three days, that his son had put into some distant port
of England: But when certain intelligence of the cala∣mity
was brought him, he fainted away; and it was re∣marked,
that he never after was seen to smile, nor ever
recovered his wonted chearfulness<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 476. Order. Vital. p. 869. Sim. Dunelm. p. 242. Alur. Beverl. p. 148.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE death of William may be regarded, in one re∣spect,
as a misfortune to the English; because it was
the immediate source of those civil wars, which, after
the demise of the King, caused such confusion in the na∣tion:
But it is remarkable, that the young prince had en∣tertained
a violent aversion to the natives; and had been
heard to threaten, that, when he should be King, he
<PB N="363" REF="397"/>
would make them draw the plough, and would turn
them into beasts of burthen. These prepossessions he in∣herited
from his father, who, tho' he was wont, when it
might serve his purposes, to value himself on his birth,
as a native of England<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neub. lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cap. 3.</NOTE>, showed, in the course of his
government, an extreme prejudice against that people.
All hopes of preferment, to ecclesiastical as well as civil
dignities, were denied them during this whole reign;
and any foreigner, however ignorant or worthless, was
sure to have the preference in every competition<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Eadmer. p. 110.</NOTE>. As
the English had given no disturbance to the government
during the course of fifty years, this inveterate antipa∣thy,
in a prince of so much temper as well as penetra∣tion,
forms a presumption that the English of that age
were still a rude and barbarous people even compared
to the Normans, and impresses us with no very favour∣able
idea of the Anglo-Saxon manners.</P>
<P>PRINCE William left no children; and the King had
not now any legitimate issue; except one daughter, Ma∣tilda,
whom, in 1110, he had betrothed, tho' only eight
years of age<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 215. W. Malm. p. 166. Order. Vital. p. 838.</NOTE>, to the Emperor Henry V. and whom he
had then sent over to be educated in Germany<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Henry, by the feudal customs, was intitled to levy a tax for the marrying his eldest daughter, and he exacted three shillings a hyde on all England. H. Hunt. p. 379. Some historians (as Brady, p. 270. and Tyrrel, vol. ii. p. 182.) heedlessly make this sum amount to above 800,000 pounds of our present money: But it could not exceed 135,000. Five hydes, sometimes less, made a knight's see, of which there were about 60,000 in England, consequently near 300,000 hydes; and at the rate of three shillings a hyde, the sum would amount to 45,000 pounds, or 135,000 of our present money. See Rudborne, p. 257. In the Saxon times, there were only computed 243,600 hydes in Eng∣land.</NOTE>. But
as her absence from the kingdom, and her marriage into
a foreign family, might endanger the succession, Henry,
<PB N="364" REF="398"/>
who was now a widower, was induced to marry in hopes
of having sons; and he made his addresses to Adelais,
daughter of Godfrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's second marriage.</NOTE> duke of Lovaine, and niece to
Pope Calixtus, a young princess of an amiable person<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 223. W. Malm. p. 165.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1121.</NOTE>
But Adelais brought him no children; and the prince,
who was most likely to dispute the succession, and even
the immediate possession of the crown, recovered hopes
of subverting his rival, who had successively seized all
his patrimonial dominions. William, the son of duke
Robert, was still protected in the court of Lewis, King
of France; and as Henry's connections with Fulk, count
of Anjou, were broke off by the death of his son, that
count joined the party of the unfortunate prince, gave
him his daughter in marriage, and assisted him in raising
disturbances in Normandy. But Henry found the means
of drawing off the count of Anjou, by forming anew
with him a nearer connexion than the former, and one
more material to the interests of his family.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1127.</NOTE> The Em∣peror,
his son-in-law, dying without issue, he bestowed
his daughter on Geoffrey, the eldest son of Fulk, and
endeavoured to ensure her succession, by having her re∣cognized

barons both of Normandy and England to swear fealty
to her<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 230. W. Malm. p. 175. Gul. Gemet. p. 304. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 68.</NOTE>. He hoped, that the choice of this husband
would be more agreeable to all his subjects than that
of the Emperor; as securing them from the fears of fall∣ing
under the dominion of a great and distant potentate,
who might bring them into subjection, and reduce their
country to the rank of a province: But the barons were
displeased, that a step so material to national interests
had been taken without consulting them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 175. The annals of Waverly, p. 150. say, that the King asked and obtained the consent of all the barons.</NOTE>; and Henry
<PB N="365" REF="399"/>
had experienced too sensibly the turbulency of their dis∣position, not to dread the effects of their resentment. It
seemed probable, that his nephew's party might gain
force from the increase of the malecontents; and an acces∣sion
of power, which that prince inherited a little after,
tended to render his pretensions still more dangerous.
Charles earl of Flanders being assassinated during the
celebration of divine service, King Lewis immediately
put the young prince in possession of that county, to
which he had pretensions, in the right of his grandmother
Matilda, wife to the Conqueror<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 231: Gul. Gem. p. 299. Alur. Beverl. p. 151.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1128.</NOTE> But William surviv∣ed
a very little time this piece of good fortune, which
seemed to open the door to still farther prosperity. He
was killed in a skirmish with the landgrave of Alsace,
his competitor for Flanders; and his death put an end,
for the present, to the jealousy and inquietude of Henry<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE chief merit of this prince's government consists
in the profound tranquillity which he established and
maintained throughout all his dominions during the great∣est
part of his reign<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. p. 302.</NOTE>. The mutinous barons were re∣tained
in subjection; and his neighbours, in every attempt
which they made upon him, found him so well prepared,
that they were discouraged from continuing or renewing
their enterprizes. In order to repress the incursions of
the Welsh, he brought over some Flemings in the year
1111, and settled them in Pembrokeshire, where they
long maintained a different language, and customs and
manners, from their neighbours<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 158. Brompton, p. 1003.</NOTE>. Tho' his government
seems to have been arbitrary in England, it was judicious
and prudent; and was as little oppressive as the necessity
of his affairs would permit. He wanted not attention to
the redress of grievances; and historians mention in par∣ticular
<PB N="366" REF="400"/>
the levying purveyance, which he endeavoured to
moderate and restrain. The tenants in the King's de∣mesne
lands were at that time obliged to supply <HI>gratis</HI>
the court with provisions, and to furnish carriages on the
same hard terms, when the King made a progress into
any of the counties. These exactions were so grievous,
and levied in so licentious a manner, that the farmers,
when they heard of the court's approach, often deserted
their homes, as if an enemy had invaded them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 94. Chron. Sax. p▪ 212.</NOTE>; and
sheltered their persons and families in the woods from the
insults of the King's retinue. Henry prohibited these
enormities, and punished the persons guilty of them by
cutting off their hands, legs, or other members<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 94.</NOTE>. But
the prerogative was perpetual; the remedy applied by
Henry was but temporary; and the violence of this remedy,
so far from being a security to the people, was only a
proof of the ferocity of the government in that age,
and threatened a quick return of like abuses.</P>
<P>ONE great and difficult object of the King's prudence
was the guarding against the incroachments of the court
of Rome, and protecting the liberties of the church of
England. The Pope, in the year 1101, had sent Guy,
archbishop of Vienne, as legate into Britain; and tho'
he was the first that for many years had appeared there in
that character, and his commission gave general surprize<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 58.</NOTE>,
the King, who was then in the commencement of his
reign, and was attended with many difficulties, was
obliged to submit to this incroachment on his authority.
But in the year 1116, Anselm, abbot of St. Sabas, who
was coming over with a like legatine commission, was
prohibited to enter the kingdom<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 474.</NOTE>; and Pope Calixtus,
<PB N="367" REF="401"/>
who in his turn was then labouring under many diffi∣culties,
by reason of the pretensions of Gregory, an
anti-pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1128.</NOTE> was obliged to promise, that he never would
for the future, except when solicited by the King him∣self,
send any legate into England<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 125. 137, 138.</NOTE>. Notwithstanding
this engagement, the Pope, so soon as he had suppressed
his antagonist, granted the Cardinal de Crema a lega∣tine
commission for that kingdom; and the King, who,
by &amp; reason of his nephew's intrigues and invasions, found
himself at that time in a dangerous situation, was obliged
to submit to the exercise of this commission<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 229.</NOTE>. A synod
was called by the legate at London; where, among other
canons, a vote passed, enacting severe penalties on the
marriage of the clergy<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Conc. vol. ii. p. 34.</NOTE>; and the Cardinal, in a public
harangue, declared it to be an unpardonable enormity,
that a priest should dare to consecrate and touch the body
of Christ immediately after he had risen from the side of
a strumpet: For that was the decent appellation which
he gave to the wives of the clergy. But it happened,
that, the very next night, the officers of justice, break∣ing
into a disorderly house, found the Cardinal in bed
with a courtezan<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 478. M. Paris, p. 48. Matth. West. ad ann. 1125. H. Huntingdon, p. 382. It is remarkable, that this last wri∣ter, who was a clergyman as well as the others, makes an apology for using such freedom with the fathers of the church; but says, that the fact was notorious, and ought not to be concealed.</NOTE>; an incident which threw such a ridi∣cule
on him, that he immediately stole out of the king∣dom:
The synod broke up; and the canons against the
marriage of clergymen were worse executed than ever<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 234.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY, in order to prevent this alternate revolution
of concessions and encroachments, sent William, then
archbishop of Canterbury, to remonstrate with the court
<PB N="368" REF="402"/>
of Rome against these abuses, and to assert the liberties
of the English churches. It was an usual maxim with
every Pope, when he found that he could not prevail in
any pretension, to grant princes or states a power which
they had always exercised, to resume at a proper season
the claim which seemed to be resigned, and to pretend,
that the civil magistrate had possessed the authority only
from a special indulgence of the Roman pontiff. After
this manner, the Pope, finding that the French nation
would not admit his claim of granting investitures, had
passed a bull, giving the King that authority; and he
now practised a like invention to elude the complaints of the King of England. He made the archbishop of Can∣terbury
his legate, renewed his commission from time to
time, and still pretended, that the rights, which that
prelate had ever exercised as metropolitan, were entirely
derived from the indulgence of the apostolic see. The
English princes, and Henry in particular, who were glad
to avoid any present contest of so dangerous a nature,
commonly acquiesced by their silence in these pretensions
of the court of Rome<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">The legates <HI>a latere,</HI> as they were called, were a kind of dele∣gates, who possessed the full power of the Pope in all the provinces committed to their charge, and were very busy in extending, as well as exercising it. They nominated to all vacant benefices, assembled synods, and were anxious to maintain ecclesiastical privileges, which never could be fully protected without incroachments on the civil power. If there was the least concurrence or opposition, it was always supposed that the civil power was to give way: Every deed, which had the least pre∣tence of holding of any thing spiritual, as marriages, testaments, pro∣missory oaths, were brought into the spiritual court, and could not be canvassed before a civil magistrate. These were the established laws of the church; and where a legate was sent immediately from Rome, he was sure to maintain the papal claims with the utmost rigour: But it was an advantage to the King to have the archbishop of Canterbury ap∣pointed legate, because the connexions of that prelate with the kingdom tended to moderate his measures.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="403"/>
As every thing in England remained in the utmost
tranquillity, Henry took the opportunity of paying a
visit to Normandy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1131.</NOTE> to which he was invited, as well by
his affection for that country, as by his tenderness for
his daughter the Empress, Matilda, who was always his
favourite.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1133.</NOTE> Some time after, that princess was delivered
of a son, who received the name of Henry; and the
King, farther to ensure her succession, made all the nobi∣lity
of England and Normandy renew the oath of fealty,
which they had already sworn to her<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 177.</NOTE>. The joy of this
event, and the satisfaction which he reaped from his
daughter's company, who bore successively two other
sons, made his residence in Normandy very agreeable to
him<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 315.</NOTE>; and he seemed determined to pass the rest of his
days in that country; when an incursion of the Welsh
obliged him to think of returning into England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1135.</NOTE> He
was preparing for the journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of Dec.</NOTE> when he was seized with
a sudden illness at St. Denis le Forment, from eating too
plentifully of lampreys, a food which always agreed
better with his palate than his constitution<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 385. M. Paris, p. 50.</NOTE>. He died
in the sixty-seventh year of his age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE> and the thirty-fifth
of his reign; leaving by will his daughter, Matilda,
heiress of all his dominions, without making any men∣tion
of her husband, Geoffrey, who had given him several
causes of displeasure<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 178.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS prince was one of the most accomplished that
has filled the English throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and cha∣racter of Henry.</NOTE> and prossessed all the quali∣ties
both of body and mind, natural and acquired, which
could fit him for the high station, to which he attained.
His person was manly, his countenance engaging, his
eyes clear, serene, and penetrating. The affability
of his address encouraged those who might be overawed
by the sense of his dignity or of his wisdom; and tho' he
<PB N="370" REF="404"/>
often indulged his facetious humour, he knew how to
temper it with discretion, and ever kept at a distance
from all indecent familiarities with his courtiers. His
superior eloquence and judgment would have given him
an ascendant even had he been born in a private station;
and his personal bravery would have procured him respect,
even tho' it had been less supported by art and policy.
By his great progress in literature, he acquired the name
of <HI>Beau-clerc</HI> or the scholar; but his application to these
sedentary pursuits abated nothing of the activity and vigi∣lance
of his government; and tho' the learning of that
age was better fitted to corrupt than improve the under∣standing,
his natural good sense preserved itself untainted
both from the pedantry and superstition, which were
then so prevalent among men of letters. His temper
was very susceptible of the sentiments as well of friend∣ship
as of resentment<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 805.</NOTE>; and his ambition, tho' high,
might be esteemed moderate and reasonable; had not
his conduct towards his brother and nephew showed
that he was too much disposed to sacrifice to it all the
maxims of justice and equity. But the total incapacity
of Robert for government afforded his younger brother
a reason or pretence for seizing the scepter both of Nor∣mandy
and England; and when violence and usurpation
are once begun, necessity obliges a prince to continue in
the same criminal course, and engages him in measures,
which his better judgment and sounder principles would
otherwise have induced him to reject with warmth and
indignation.</P>
<P>KING Henry was much addicted to women; and histo∣rians
mention no less than seven illegitimate sons and six
daughters, who were born to him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 8. cap. 29.</NOTE>. Hunting was also
one of his favourite amusements; and he exercised great
<PB N="371" REF="405"/>
rigour on those who encroached on the royal forests,
which were augmented during this reign<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 179.</NOTE>, tho' their
number and extent were already enormous. To kill a
stag was as criminal as to murder a man: He made all
the dogs be mutilated, which were kept on the borders
of his forests: And he sometimes deprived his subjects of
the liberty of hunting on their own lands, or even cut∣ting
their own woods. In other respects, he executed
justice, and that with rigour; the best maxim which a
prince in that age could follow. Stealing was first made
capital in this reign<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dunelm. p. 231. Brompton, p. 1000. Flor. Wigorn. p. 653. Hoveden, p. 471.</NOTE>: False coining, which was then
a very common crime, and which had extremely debased
the money, was punished severely by Henry<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dunelm. p. 231. Brompton, p. 1000. Hoveden, p. 471. Annal. Waverl. p. 149.</NOTE>. Near
fifty criminals of this kind were at one time hanged or
mutilated; and tho' these punishments seem to have
been exercised in somewhat an arbitrary manner, they
were grateful to the people, more attentive to present
advantages, than jealous of general laws. There is a
code, which passes under the name of Henry I. but the
best antiquarians have agreed not to think it genuine.
It is however a very antient compilation, and may be use∣ful
to instruct us in the manners and customs of the times.
It appears from it, that a great distinction was then made
between the English and Normans, much to the advan∣tage
of the latter<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">LL. Hen. 1. § 18. 75.</NOTE>. The deadly feuds and the liberty of
private revenge, which had been avowed by the Saxon
laws, were still continued, and were not yet wholly ille∣gal<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">LL. Hen. § 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY, on his accession, granted a charter to London,
which seems to have been the first step towards rendering
<PB N="372" REF="406"/>
that city a corporation. By this charter, they were em∣powered
to hold the farm of Middlesex at three hundred
pounds a year, to elect their own sheriff and justiciary,
and to hold pleas of the crown; they were exempted from
Scot, Danegelt, trials by combat, and lodging the King's
retinue. These, with a confirmation of the privileges
of their court of Hustings, wardmotes, and common
halls, and their liberty of hunting in Middlesex and
Surrey, are the chief articles of this charter<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lambardi Archaionomia ex edit. Twisden Wilkins, p. 235.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>IN the progress and settlement of the feudal law, the
male succession to fiefs had taken place some time
before the female was admitted;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII.</NOTE> and estates, being con∣sidered
as military benefices, not as property, were trans∣mitted
to such only as could serve in the armies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1135.</NOTE> and
perform in person the conditions upon which they were
originally granted. But after that the continuance of
rights, during some generations, in the same family, had,
in some measure, obliterated the primitive idea, the fe∣males
were gradually admitted to the possession of feu∣dal
property;
and the same revolution of principles,
which procured them the inheritance of private estates,
naturally introduced their succession to government and
authority. The failure, therefore, of male-heirs to the
kingdom of England and dutchy of Normandy, seemed
to leave the succession open, without a rival, to the em∣press,
Matilda; and as Henry had made all his vassals in
both states swear fealty to her, he presumed, that they
would not easily be induced to depart at once from her
hereditary right, and from their own reiterated oaths and
<PB N="374" REF="408"/>
engagements. But the irregular manner, in which he
himself had acquired the crown, might instruct him, that
neither his Norman nor English subjects were as yet
capable of adhering to a strict rule of government; and
as every precedent of this kind seems to give authority
to new usurpations, he had reason to dread, even from
his own family, some invasion of his daughter's title,
which he had taken such pains to establish.</P>
<P>ADELA, daughter of William the Conqueror, had
been married to Stephen, count of Blois, and had brought
him several sons; among whom, Stephen, and Henry,
the two youngst, had been invited over to England by
the late King, and had received great honours, riches,
and preferment from the zealous friendship, which that
prince bore to every one, that had been so fortunate as to
acquire his favour and good opinion. Henry, who had
betaken himself to the ecclesiastical profession, was created
abbot of Glastenbury and bishop of Winchester; and
tho' these dignities were considerable, Stephen, his bro∣ther,
had, from his uncle's liberality, attained establish∣ments
still more solid and durable<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gul. Newbr. p. 360. Brompton, p. 1023.</NOTE>. The King had
married him to Matilda, who was daughter and heir of
Eustace count of Boulogne, and who brought him, be∣sides
that feudal sovereignty in France, an immense pro∣perty
in England, which, in the distribution of lands,
had been conferred by the Conqueror on the family of
Boulogne. Stephen also by this marriage acquired a
new connexion with the royal family of England; as
Mary, his wife's mother, was sister to David, the present
King of Scotland, and to Matilda, the first wife of
Henry, and mother of the empress. The King, still
imagining, that he strengthened the interests of his fa∣mily
by the aggrandizement of Stephen, took a pleasure
in enriching him by the grant of new possessions; and
<PB N="375" REF="409"/>
he conferred on him the great estate forfeited by Robert
Mallet in England, and that forfeited by the earl of
Mortaigne m Normandy. Stephen, in return, profes∣fed
a great attachment to his uncle; and appeared so zeal∣ous
for the succession of Matilda, that when the barons
swore fealty to that princess, he contended with Robert,
earl of Glocester, the King's natural son, who should
first be admitted to give her this testimony of devoted
zeal and fidelity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 192.</NOTE>. Meanwhile, he continued to cul∣tivate,
by every art of popularity, the friendship and
affection of the English nation; and many virtues, with
which he seemed to be endowed, favoured the success
of his intentions. By his bravery, activity arid vigor, he
acquired the esteem of the barons: By his generosity, and
by an affable and familiar address, unusual in that age
among men of his high quality, he obtained the affections
of the people, particularly the Londoners<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 179. Gest. Steph. p 928.</NOTE>. And tho'
he dared not to take any steps towards his farther gran∣deur,
lest he might expose himself to the jealousy of so
penetrating a prince as Henry; he still hoped, that, by
accumulating riches and power, and by acquiring popu∣larity,
he might some time be able to open his way to the
throne.</P>
<P>No sooner had Henry expired, than Stephen, insen∣sible
to all the ties of g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atitude and fidelity, and blind to
danger, gave full reins to his criminal ambition, and
trusted, that, even without any previous intrigue, the ce∣lerity
of his enterprize and the boldness of his attempt
might overcome the weak attachment, which the Eng∣lish
and Normans in that age bore to the laws, and to
the rights of their sovereign. He hastened over to Eng∣land;
and tho' the citizens of Dover, and those of Can∣terbury,
apprized of his purpose, shut their gates against
him, he stopped not till he arrived at London, where
<PB N="376" REF="410"/>
some of the lower rank, instigated by his emissaries, as
well as moved by his general popularity, immediately
saluted him King. His next point was to acquire the
good will of the clergy; and by performing the ceremony
of his coronation, put himself in possession of the throne,
from which, he was confident, it would not be easy af∣terwards
to expel him. His brother, the bishop of Win∣chester,
was useful to him in these capital articles; and
having gained Roger, bishop of Salisbury<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 386. Gul. Neubr. p. 360. 362. Ann. Waverl. p. 152.</NOTE>, who, tho'
he owed a great fortune and advancement to the favour
of the late king, preserved no sense of gratitude to that
prince's family, he applied, in conjunction with that
prelate, to William, archbishop of Canterbury, and re∣quired
him, in virtue of his office, to put the crown upon
the head of Stephen. The primate, who, as well as all
the others, had sworn fealty to Matilda, refused to per∣form
this ceremony<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gest. Steph. p. 929.</NOTE>; but his opposition was overcome
by an expedient equally dishonourable with the other
steps, by which this great revolution was effected. Hugh
Bigod, steward of the houshold, made oath before the
primate, that the late King, on his death-bed, had dis∣covered
a dissatisfaction with his daughter Matilda, and
had expressed his intention of leaving the count of Bou∣logne
heir to all his dominions<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, p. 51. Diceto, p. 505. Chron. Dunst. p. 23.</NOTE>. William, either be∣lieving
or feigning to believe Big<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d's testimony, anointed
Stephen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Dec.</NOTE> and put the crown upon his head; and by this
religious ceremony, that prince, without any shadow
either of hereditary title or consent of the nobility
or people, was allowed to proceed to the exercise of sovereign
authority. Very few barons attended his corona∣tion<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1023.</NOTE>;
but none opposed his usurpation, however unjust
<PB N="377" REF="411"/>
or flagrant. The sentiment of religion, which, if cor∣rupted
into superstition, has often little efficacy in forti∣fying
the duties of civil society, overlooked the multiplied
oaths, taken in favour of Matilda, and only rendered
the people obedient to a prince, who was countenanced
by the clergy, and who had received from the primate
the rite of royal unction and consecration<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Such stress was formerly laid on the rite of coronation, that the monkish writers never give any prince the title of King, till he is crowned; tho' he had for some time been in possession of the crown, and exercised all the powers of Sovereignty.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>STEPHEN, that he might farther secure his tottering
throne, passed a charter, in which he made liberal pro∣mises
to all orders of men; to the clergy, that he would
speedily fill all vacant benefices, and would never levy
the rents of any of them during the interval; to the no∣bility,
that they should not be prosecuted for hunting in
their own forests; and to the people, that he would remit
the tax of Danegelt and restore the laws of King Ed∣ward<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 179. Hoveden, p. 482. M. Paris, p. 51. Hagul. p. 314. Brompton, p. 1024.</NOTE>.
The late King had a great treasure at Win∣chester,
amounting to an hundred thousand pounds<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 179. Chron. Sax, P. 238. Gest. Stephen, p. 929 M. Paris, p. 51.</NOTE>:
And Stephen, by seizing this money, immediately turned
against Henry's family, the precaution which that prince
had employed for their grandeur and security: An event,
which naturally attends the policy of amassing treasures.
By means of this money, the usurper insured the com∣pliance,
tho' not the attachment, of the principal clergy
and nobility; and not trusting to this frail security, he
invited over from the continent, particularly from Brit∣tanny
and Flanders, great numbers of those bravos or
disorderly soldiers, with whom every country in Europe,
by reason of the general ill police and turbulent govern∣ments,
<PB N="378" REF="412"/>
extremely abounded<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 179.</NOTE>. These mercenary troops
guarded his throne, by the terrors of the sword; and
Stephen, that he might also overawe all malecontents
by new and additional terrors of religion, procured a bull
from Rome,, which ratified his title, and which the Pope,
seeing this prince in actual possession of the throne, and
pleased with an appeal to his authority in secular contro∣versies,
very readily granted him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hagulstad, p. 259. 313.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MATILDA and her husband,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1136.</NOTE> Geoffrey, were as un∣fortunate
in Normandy as they had been in England.
The Norman nobility, moved by an hereditary animosity
against the Angevins, first applied to Theobald, count
of Blois, Stephen's elder brother, for protection and
assistance<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Order. Vitalis, p. 902. M. Paris, p 51.</NOTE>; but hearing afterwards, that Stephen had
got possession of the English crown, and having many of
them the same reasons as formerly for desiring a conti∣nuance
of their union with that kingdom, they trans∣ferred
their allegiance to Stephen, and put him in possession
of their government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 903.</NOTE>. Lewis the younger, the
present King of France, accepted of the homage of Eu∣stace,
Stephen's eldest son, for the dutchy; and the far∣ther
to corroborate his connexions with that family, he
betrothed his sister, Constantia, to the young prince<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 482. Gervase, p. 1350.</NOTE>. The count of Blois resigned all his pretensions, and re∣ceived
in lieu of them a pension of two thousand marks;
and Geoffrey himself was obliged to conclude a truce for
two years with Stephen, on condition of the King's
paying him, during that time, a pension of five thou∣sand<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 52.</NOTE>.
Stephen, who had taken a journey to Norman∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,
finished all these transactions in person, and soon
after returned to England.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="413"/>
ROBERT, earl of Glocester, natural son of the late
King, was a man of honour and ability; and as he was
much attached to the interests of his sister, Matilda, and
zealous for the lineal succession to the crown, it was
chiefly from his intrigues and resistance, that the King
had reason to dread a new revolution of government.
This nobleman, when he received intelligence of Ste∣phen's
accession, was much embarrassed concerning the
measures, which he should pursue in that difficult emer∣gency.
To swear allegiance to the usurper appeared to
him very dishonourable, and a breach of his oath to Ma∣tilda:
To refuse giving this pledge of his fidelity was
to banish himself from England, and be totally incapa∣citated
from serving the royal family, or contributing to
their restoration<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 179.</NOTE>. He offered Stephen to do him ho∣mage
and to take the oath of fealty; but with an express
condition, that the King should maintain all his stipu∣lations,
and should never invade any of Robert's rights
or dignities: And Stephen, tho' fensible, that this re∣serve,
so unusual in itself, and so unbefitting the duty of
a subject was meant only to afford Robert a pretence
for a revolt on the first favourable opportunity, was
obliged, by the numerous friends and retainers of that
nobleman, to receive him on these terms<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. M. Paris, p. 51.</NOTE>. The clergy,
who could scarce, at this time, be deemed subjects to the
crown, imitated that dangerous example; and annexed
to their oath of allegiance this condition, that they were
only bound so long as the King defended the ecclesiasti∣cal
liberties, and supported the discipline of the church<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 179.</NOTE>.
The barons, in return for their submission, exacted
terms still more destructive of public peace, as well as
of royal authority: Many of them required the right of
fortifying their castles, and of putting themselves in a

posture of defence, and the King found himself totally
unable to refuse his consent to this exorbitant demand<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Malmes. p. 180.</NOTE>.
All England was immediately filled with these fortresses,
which the noblemen garrisoned, either with their vassals,
or with licentious soldiers, who flocked to them from all
quarters. Unbounded rapine was exercised upon the
people for the maintenance of these troops; and private
animosities, which had with difficulty been restrained
by law, now breaking out without controul, rendered
England a scene of uninterrupted violence and devasta∣tion.
Wars between the nobles were carried on with
the utmost fury in every quarter; the barons even assu∣med
the right of coining money, and of exercising,
without appeal, every act of jurisdiction<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 19. Gul. Neubr. p. 372. Chron. Heming. p. 487. Brompton, p. 1035.</NOTE>, and the in∣ferior
gentry, as well as the people, finding no defence
from the laws, during this total dissolution of sovereign
authority, were obliged, for their immediate safety, to
pay court to some neighbouring chieftain, and to pur∣chase
his protection, both by submitting to his exactions,
and by assisting him in his rapine upon others. The
erection of one castle proved the immediate cause of
building many more; and even those, who obtained not
the King's permission, thought themselves intitled, by
the great principle of self-preservation, to put them∣selves
on an equal footing with their neighbours, who
commonly were also their enemies and rivals. The
aristocratical power, which is so tyrannical and oppres∣sive
in the feudal governments, had now risen to its
utmost height, during the reign of a prince, who, tho'
endowed with vigour and ability, had usurped the throne
without the pretence of a title, and who was necessitated
to tolerate in others the same violence, to which he him∣self
had been beholden for his sovereignty.
<PB N="381" REF="415"/>
BUT Stephen was not of a disposition to submit long
to these usurpations, without making some efforts for
the recovery of royal authority. Finding that the legal
prerogatives of the crown were resisted and abridged,
he was also tempted to make his power the sole measure
of his conduct; and to violate all those concessions,
which he himself had made on his accession<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 180. M. Paris, p. 51.</NOTE>, as well
as the antient and established privileges of his subjects.
The mercenary soldiers, who chiefly supported his autho∣rity,
having exhausted the royal treasure, subsisted by
depredations; and every place was filled with the best
grounded complaints against the government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1137.</NOTE> The earl
of Glocester, having now settled with his friends the pro∣ject

had been annexed to the oath of fealty, sworn by that
nobleman<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 180.</NOTE>. David,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1138</NOTE> King of Scotland, appeared at the

and ravages enraged the northern nobility, who might
otherwise have been inclined to join him; and William
earl of Albemarle, William Piercy, Robert de Brus,
Roger Moubray, Ilbert Lacy, Walter d'Espee, powerful
barons in those parts, assembled an army, with which
they encamped at North-Allerton, and awaited the arri∣val

Scots was routed with great slaughter, and he himself,
as wel1 as his son, Henry, very narrowly escaped falling
into the hands of the English. This success overawed
the malcontents in England, and might have given some
stability to Stephen's throne, had he not been so elated
with prosperity as to engage in a controversy with the
clergy, who were at that time an overmatch for any monarch.</P>
<P>THO' the exorbitant power of the church, in antient
times, weakened the authority of the crown, and inter∣rupted
the course of the laws, it may be doubted, whe∣ther,
in ages of such violence and outrage, it was not
rather advantageous that some limits were set to the power
of the sword, both in the hands of the prince and nobles,
and that men were taught to pay regard to some prin∣ciples
and privileges. The chief misfortune was, that
the prelates, on some occasions, acted entirely as barons,
employed military power against their sovereign or their
neighbours, and thereby often increased those disorders,
which it was their duty to repress. The bishop of Salis∣bury,
in imitation of the nobility, had built two strong
castles, one at Sherborne, another at the Devizes, and
had laid the foundations of a third at Malmesbury: His
nephew, Alexander bishop of Lincoln, had erected a
fortress at Newark: And Stephen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1139.</NOTE> who was now sensi∣ble
from experience of the mischiefs attending these mul∣tiplied
citadels, resolved to begin with destroying those
of the clergy, who by their function seemed less intitled
than the barons to such military securities<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neubr. p. 362.</NOTE>. Taking
pretence of a fray, which had arisen In court between
the retinue of the bishop of Salisbury and that of the earl
of Britanny, he seized both that prelate and the bishop
<PB N="383" REF="417"/>
of Lincoln, threw them into prison, and obliged them
by menaces to deliver up those places of strength which
they had lately erected<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 238. W. Malmes. p. 181. Order. Vital, p. 919, 920. Gest. Steph. p. 944. Chron. Norm p. 978. Trivet, p. 7. Gervase, p. 1345.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY, bishop of Winchester, the King's brother,
being armed with a legatine commission, now conceived
himself to be an ecclesiastical sovereign no less powerful
than the civil; and forgetting the ties of blood which
connected him with the King, he resolved to vindicate
the privileges of the church, which, he pretended, were
here openly violated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Aug.</NOTE> He assembled a synod at West∣minster,
and there complained of the impiety of Stephen's
measures, who had employed violence against the dig∣nitaries
of the church, and had not awaited the sentence
of a spiritual court, by whom alone, he affirmed, they
could lawfully be tried and condemned, if their conduct
had any wise merited censure or punishment<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 182.</NOTE>: The
synod ventured to send a summons to the King, charg∣ing
him to appear before them, and to justify his mea∣sures<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 182. M. Paris, p. 53.</NOTE>; and Stephen, instead of resenting this indignity,
sent Aubrey de Vere to plead his cause before that as∣sembly.
De Vere accused the two prelates of treason
and sedition; but the synod refused to try the cause,
or examine their conduit, till those castles, of which
they had been dispossessed, were previously restored to
them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 183.</NOTE>. The bishop of Salisbury appealed to the Pope;
and had not Stephen and his partizans employed menaces,
and even shown a disposition of executing violence by
the hands of the soldiery, affairs had instantly come to
extremity between the crown and the mitre<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE this quarrel, joined to so many other griev∣ances,
encreased the discontents among the people, the
<PB N="384" REF="418"/>
Empress, invited by the opportunity, and secretly en∣couraged
by the legate himself, landed in England, with
Robert earl of Glocester, and a retinue of an hundred

who had expected that her daughter-in-law would
have invaded the kingdom with a much greater force,
became apprehensive of danger<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 184. Ger∣vase, p. 1346.</NOTE>; and Matilda, to ease her

under the protection of Miles, a gallant nobleman in

Geoffrey Talbot, William Mohun, Ralph Lovel, Wil∣liam
Fitz-John, William Fitz-Alan, Paganell, and
many other barons, declared for her<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Order. Vitalis, p. 917. M. Paris, p. 52.</NOTE>; and her party,
which was generally favoured in the kingdom, seemed
every day to gain ground upon that of her antagonist.</P>
<P>WERE we to relate all the military events transmitted
to us by contemporary and authentic historians, it would
be easy to swell our accounts of this reign into a large
volume; but these incidents, so little memorable in
themselves, and so confused both in time and place,
could afford neither instruction nor entertainment to the
reader. It suffices to say, that the war was spread into
every quarter; and that those turbulent barons, who had
already shaken off, in a great measure, the restraint of
government, having now obtained the pretence of a pub∣lic
cause, carried on their devastations with redoubled
fury, exercised implacable vengeance on each other, and
set no bounds to their oppression over the people. The
<PB N="385" REF="419"/>
castles of the nobility were become receptacles of li∣censed
robbers, who, sallying forth day and night, com∣mitted
spoil on the open country, on the villages, and
even on the cities; put the captives to torture, in order
to make them discover their treasures; sold their persons
to slavery; and set fire to the houses, after they had
pillaged them of every thing valuable. The fierceness
of their disposition, leading them to commit wanton de∣struction,
frustrated their rapacity of its purpose; and
the property and persons even of the ecclesiastics, gener∣ally
so much revered, were at last, from necessity, ex∣posed
to the same outrage, which had laid waste the rest
of the kingdom. The land was left untilled; the in∣struments
of husbandry destroyed or abandoned; and a
grievous famine, the natural result of these disorders,
affected equally both parties, and reduced the spoilers,
as well as the defenceless peoples to the most extreme
want and indigence<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron, Sax. p. 238. W. Malmes, p. 185. Gest. Steph. p. 961. M. Paris, p. 53. Gul. Neubr. p. 372. Contin. Flor. Wig. p. 665. Gervase, p. 1346.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1140</NOTE> several fruitless negotiations and treaties of
peace, which never interrupted those destructive hostili∣ties,
there happened at last an event, which seemed to
promise some end of the public calamities. Ralph, earl
of Chester, and his half brother, William de Roumara,
partizans of Matilda, had surprized the castle of Lin∣coln<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital, p. 921.</NOTE>; but the citizens, who were better affected to
Stephen, having invited him to their aid, that prince
laid close siege to the castle, in hopes of rendering him∣self
soon master of the place, either by assault or famine.
The earl of Glocester hastened with, an army to the re∣life
of his friends;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1141.</NOTE> and Stephen, informed of his ap∣proach,
marched into the field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d Feb.</NOTE> with an intention of
<PB N="386" REF="420"/>
giving him battle. After a violent shock, the two wings
of the royalists were put to flight; and Stephen himself,
surrounded by the enemy, was at last, after exerting
great efforts of valour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stephen taken pri∣soner.</NOTE> borne down by numbers, and
taken prisoner<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neubr. p. 363. Ann. Waverl. p. 154. Chron. Heming. p. 482. Hagul. p. 269. Gervase, p. 1352, 1354.</NOTE>. He was conducted to Glocester; and
tho' at first treated with humanity, was soon after, on
some suspicions, thrown into prison, and loaded with irons<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 241. W. Malm. p. 187. H. Hunt. p. 392. Hoveden, p. 487. Chron. Norm. p. 979. M. Paris, p. 53, 54. Brompton, p. 1031.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>STEPHEN's party were entirely broke by the captivity of
their leader, and the barons came in daily from all
quarters, and did homage to Matilda. That princess,
however, amidst all her prosperity, knew, that me was
not secure of success, unless she could gain the confi∣dence
of the clergy; and as the conduct of the legate
had been of late very ambiguous, and showed his inten∣tions
to have rather aimed at humbling his brother,
than totally ruining him, she employed every endeavour
to fix him in her interests.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d March.</NOTE> She held a conference with
him in an open plain near Winchester; where she pro∣mised
upon oath, that if he would acknowledge her for
sovereign, would recognize her title as the sole descend∣ant
of the late King, and would return to the allegiance,
which he, as well as the rest of the kingdom, had sworn
to her, he should in return be entire master of the ad∣ministration,
and in particular should, at his pleasure,
dispose of all vacant bishoprics and abbies. Earl Robert,
her brother, Brian Fitz-Count, Miles of Glocester,
and other great men, became guarantees for her observ∣ance
of these engagements<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 187.</NOTE>; and the prelate was at last
induced to promise her his allegiance, but that still bur∣dened
with the express condition, that she should on her
<PB N="387" REF="421"/>
part fulfil her promises. He then conducted her into
Winchester, led her in procession to the cathedral, and
with great solemnity, in the presence of many bishops
and abbots, denounced curses against all those who curs∣ed
her, poured out blessings on those who blessed her,
granted absolution to such as were obedient to her, and
excommunicated such as were rebellious<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 242. Contin. Flor. Wig. p. 676.</NOTE>. Theobald,
archbishop of Canterbury, soon after came also to court,
and swore allegiance to the empress<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 187.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MATILDA,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matilda crowned.</NOTE> that she might farther ensure the attach∣ment
of the clergy, was willing to receive the crown
from their hands; and instead of assembling the states of
the kingdom, the measure which the constitution, had it
been either fixed or regarded, seemed necessarily to re∣quire,
she was contented, that the legate should summon
an ecclesiastical council, and that her title to the throne
should there be recognized and acknowledged. The le∣gate,
addressing himself to the assembly, told them, that,
in the absence of the Empress, Stephen, his brother, had
been permitted to reign, and, previously to his ascending
the throne, had seduced them by many fair promises, of
honouring and exalting the church, of maintaining the
laws, and of reforming all abuses: That it grieved him
to observe how much that prince had been in every par∣ticular
wanting to his engagements; public peace was
interrupted, crimes were daily committed with impunity,
bishops were thrown into prison, and forced to surren∣der
their possessions, abbies were put to sale, churches
were pillaged, and the most enormous disorders prevailed
in the administration: That he himself, in order to pro∣cure
a redress of these grievances, had formerly sum∣moned
the King before a council of bishops; but instead
of inducing him to amend his conduct, had rather of∣fended
<PB N="388" REF="422"/>
him by that expedient: That that prince, however
misguided, was still his brother, and the object of his af∣fections;;
but he must however regard his interests as
much subordinate to those of his heavenly father, who
had now rejected him, and thrown him into the hands
of his enemies: That it principally belonged to the cler∣gy
to elect and ordain Kings; he had summoned them
together for that purpose; and having invoked the divine
assistance, he now pronounced Matilda, the only de∣scendant
of Henry, their late sovereign, Queen of Eng∣land.
The whole assembly, by their acclamations or
silence, gave, or seemed to give, their assent to this de∣claration<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes, p. 188. This author, a judicious man, was present, and says, that he was very attentive to what passed. This speech, therefore, may be regarded as entirely authentic.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE only laymen summoned to this council, which
decided the fate of the crown, were the Londoners;
and even these were required, not to give their opinion,
but to submit to the decrees of the synod. The depu∣ties
of London, however, were not so passive: They
insisted, that their King should be delivered from prison;
but were told by the legate, that it became not the Lon∣doners,
who were regarded as noblemen in England, to
take party with those barons, who had basely forsaken
their lord in battle, and who had treated holy church
with contumely<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 188.</NOTE>. It is with reason that the citizens of
London assumed so much authority, if it be true, what
is related by Fitz-Stephen, a contemporary author, that
that city could at that time bring into the field no less
than 80,000 combatants<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">P. 4. Were this account to be depended on, London must at that time have contained near 400,000 inhabitants, which is above double the number it contained at the death of Queen Elizabeth. But these loose calculations, or rather guesses, deserve very little credit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="423"/>
LONDON, notwithstanding its great power, and its
attachment to Stephen, was at last obliged to submit to
Matilda; and her authority, by the prudent conduct of
earl Robert, seemed to be established over the whole
kingdom: But affairs remained not long in this situa∣tion.
That princess, besides the disadvantages of her
fex, which weakened her influence over a turbulent and
martial people, was of a passionate, imperious spirit<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neubr. 363. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 74. Hagul. p. 270.</NOTE>,
and knew not how to temper with affability the harsh∣ness
of a refusal. Stephen's Queen, seconded by many
of the nobility, petitioned for the liberty of her hus∣band;
and offered, that, on that condition, he should
renounce the crown, and retire into a convent<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Contin. Flor. Wig. p. 677. Brompton, p. 1031.</NOTE>. The
legate desired, that prince Eustace, his nephew, might
inherit Boulogne and the other patrimonial estates of his
father<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>: The Londoners applied for the establishment of
King Edward's laws, instead of those of king Henry, which,
they said, were grievous and oppressive<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Contin. Flor. Wig. p. 677. Gervase, p. 1355.</NOTE>. All these pe∣titions
were denied in the most haughty and peremptory
manner.</P>
<P>THE legate, who had probably never been sincere in
his compliance with Matilda's government, availed him∣self
of the ill humours excited by this imperious con∣duct,
and secretly instigated the Londoners to a revolt.
A conspiracy was entered into to seize the Empress's
person; and she saved herself from the danger by a pre∣cipitate
retreat<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 242. W. Malm. p. 189.</NOTE>. She fled to Winchester; whither the
legate, desirous to save appearances, and watching the
proper opportunity to ruin her cause, soon after followed
her. But having assembled all his retainers, he openly
joined his force to that of the Londoners, and to Ste∣phen's
<PB N="390" REF="424"/>
mercenary troops, who had not yet evacuated
the kingdom; and he besieged Matilda in Winchester<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 10. Gul. Neubr. p. 363.</NOTE>.
That princess, being hard pressed by famine, made her
escape; but in the flight, earl Robert, her brother, fell
into the hands of the enemy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 242. Hoveden, p. 488. Gest. Steph. p. 957. Chron. Norm. p. 979.</NOTE>. This nobleman, tho' a
subject, was as much the life and soul of his own party,
as Stephen was of the other; and the Empress, sensible
of his merit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stephen re∣leased.</NOTE> consented to exchange the prisoners on
equal terms<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 242. M. Paris, p. 54.</NOTE>. The civil war was again kindled with
greater fury than ever.</P>
<P>EARL Robert,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1142.</NOTE> finding the successes on both sides nearly
balanced, went over to Normandy, which, during Ste∣phen's
captivity, had submitted to the earl of Anjou;
and he persuaded Geoffrey to allow his eldest son,
Henry, a young prince of great hopes, to take a journey
into England, and appear at the head of his partizans<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. Norm. p. 979. M. Paris, p. 54.</NOTE>.
This expedient, however, produced nothing decisive.
Stephen took Oxford after a long siege:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1143.</NOTE> He was routed
by earl Robert at Wilton<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gest. Steph. p. 960. Trivet, p. 11. M. Paris, p. 54.</NOTE>: And the Empress, tho' of
a masculine spirit, yet being harassed with a variety of
good and bad fortune, and alarmed with continual dangers to her person and family, at last retired with her
son into Normandy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1146.</NOTE> leaving the management of her af∣fairs
to her brother.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continua∣tion of the civil wars.</NOTE> The death of this valiant and faith∣ful
nobleman, which followed soon after, would have
proved fatal to her interests, had not some events hap∣pened,
which checked the course of Stephen's prospe∣rity.
This prince, finding, that the castles built by the noblemen of his own party encouraged the spirit of in∣dependance,
and were little less dangerous than those
<PB N="391" REF="425"/>
which remained in the hands of the enemy, endeavour∣ed
to extort from them a surrender of these fortresses;
and he alienated the affections of many of them by this
equitable demand<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 242. W. Malmes. p. 181. Trivet, p. 16. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 75. Hagulst. p. 278.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1147.</NOTE> The artillery also of the church,
which his brother had brought over to his side, had, af∣ter
some interval, joined the other party. Eugenius III.
had mounted the papal throne, and had deprived the
bishop of Winchester of the legatine commission, which
he conferred on Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury,
the enemy and rival of the former legate. That pontiff,
having summoned a general council at Rheims in Cham∣pagne,
instead of allowing the church of England, as
had been usual, to elect its own deputies, nominated five
English bishops to represent that church, and required
their presence in the council. Stephen, who, notwith∣standing
his present difficulties, was jealous of the rights
of his crown, refused them permission to attend<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 225.</NOTE>; and
the Pope, sensible of his advantage in contending with a
prince who reigned by a disputed title, took revenge by
laying all Stephen's party under an interdict<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. W. Thorn. p. 1807.</NOTE>. By this
sentence, which was now first known in England, di∣vine
service was prohibited, and all the functions of re∣ligion
ceased, except the baptism of infants and the ab∣solution
of dying persons. The discontents of the royal∣ists
at this situation were augmented by a comparison
with Matilda's party, who enjoyed all the benefits of the
sacred ordinances; and Stephen was at last obliged, by
making proper submissions to the see of Rome, to re∣move
this reproach from his party<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 226.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE weakness of both sides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1148.</NOTE> rather than any decrease
of mutual animosity, having produced a tacit cessation of
<PB N="392" REF="426"/>
arms in England, many of the nobility, Roger de Mow∣bray,
William de Warrenne, and others, finding no op∣portunity
to exert their military ordor at home, inlisted
themselves in a new <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rusade, which, with surprising suc∣cess,
after all former disappointments and misfortunes,
was now preached by St. Barnard<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hagulst. p. 275, 276.</NOTE>. But an event soon
after happened, which threatened a revival of hostilities
in England. Prince Henry, who had reached his six∣teenth
year, was desirous of receiving the honour of
knighthood; a ceremony which every gentleman in that
age passed thro' before he was admitted to the use of
arms, and which was even deemed requisite for the
greatest princes. He proposed to receive his admission
from his great-uncle, David King of Scotland; and for
that purpose, he passed thro' England with a great re∣tinue,
and was attended by the most considerable of his
partizans<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 490. Gul. Neubr. p. 378. Gervase, p. 1366.</NOTE>. He staid some time with the King of Scot∣land;
made some incursions into England; and by his
dexterity and vigour in all manly exercifes, by his va∣lour
in war, and his prudent conduct in every occur∣rence,
he rouzed the hopes of his party, and gave symp∣toms
of those great qualities, which he afterwards dis∣played
when he mounted the throne of England. Soon
after his return to Normandy, he was, by Matilda's
consent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1150.</NOTE> invested in that dutchy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. West, p. 245.</NOTE>; and upon the death
of his father, Geoffrey, which happened in the subse∣quent
year, he took, possession both of Anjou and Maine,
and concluded a marriage, which brought him a great
accession of power, and rendered him extremely formi∣dable
to his rival. Eleanor, the daughter and heiress of
William, duke of Guienne, and earl of Poictou, had
been married sixteen years to Lewis VII. King of
and had attended him in a crusade, which that
<PB N="393" REF="427"/>
monarch commanded against the infidels: But having
there lost the affections of her husband, and even fallen
under some suspicions of gallantry with a handsome Sa∣racen,
Lewis, more delicate than politic, procured a di∣vorce
from her, and restored her those rich provinces,
which by her marriage she had annexed to the crown of
France<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 21.</NOTE>. Young Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1152.</NOTE> neither discouraged by the
inequality of years, nor by the reports of Eleanor's gal∣lantry,
made successful courtship to that princess, and,
espousing her six weeks after her divorce, got possession
of all her dominions as her dowry<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 59. Chron. Heming. p. 489. Brompton, p. 1040.</NOTE>. The lustre which
he received from this acquisition, and the prospect of his
rising fortune, had such an effect in England, that when Stephen, desirous to ensure the crown to his son Eus∣tace,
required the archbishop of Canterbury to anoint
that prince as his successor, the primate refused com∣pliance,
and made his escape beyond sea, to avoid the
violence and revenge of Stephen<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 395. Epist. St. Thom. p. 225.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1153.</NOTE> informed of these dispositions in the people,
made an invasion on England; and having gained some
advantage over Stephen at Malmesbury, and having
taken that place, he proceeded thence to throw succours
into Wallingford, which the King had advanced with a
superior army to besiege<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Gervase, p. 1367<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE>. A decisive action was every
day expected; when the great men on both sides, terri∣fied
with the prospect of farther bloodshed and confusion,
interposed with their good offices, and set on foot a
negotiation between these rival princes. The death of
Eustace, which happened during the course of the treaty,
<PB N="394" REF="428"/>
facilitated its conclusion<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 22. Gul. Neubr. p. 379. Chron. Heming. p. 488. Brompton, p. 1037.</NOTE>; and an accommodation was
at last concluded, by which it was agreed, that Stephen
should possess the crown during his lifetime, that justice
should be administered in his name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compro∣mise be∣tween the King and prince Henry</NOTE>, even in the provin∣ces

to the observance of this treaty, and done homage to
Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the King.</NOTE> as to the heir of the crown, that prince evacu∣ated
the kingdom; and the death of Stephen, which
happened next year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1154.</NOTE> after a short illness, prevented all
those quarrels and jealousies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Oct.</NOTE> which were likely to have
ensued in so delicate a situation.</P>
<P>ENGLAND suffered great miseries during the reign
of this prince; but his personal character, allowing for
the temerity and injustice of his usurpation, appears
not liable to any great exception; and he seems to
have been well qualified, had he succeeded by a just
title, to have promoted the happiness and prosperity of
his subjects<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">W. Malmes. p. 180.</NOTE>. He was possessed of industry, activity,
and courage, to a great degree; was not deficient in
ability; had the talents of gaining mens affections; and
notwithstanding his precarious situation, never indulged
himself in the exercise of any cruelty or revenge<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 51. Hagul. p. 312.</NOTE>.
His advancement to the throne procured him neither
tranquillity nor happiness; and tho' the situation of
England prevented the neighbouring states from taking

any durable advantage of her confusions, her intestine
wars and disorders were to the last degree ruinous and
destructive.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1154.</NOTE> The court of Rome also was permitted,

with this advantage, that they prevent any vio∣lent
revolutions or conquests in particular states, were
totally unknown in antient ages; and the theory of fo∣reign
politics, in each kingdom, formed a speculation
much less complicate and involved than at present. Com∣merce
had not yet bound the most distant nations toge∣ther
in so close a chain: Wars, finished in one campaign
and often in one battle, were little affected by the move∣ments
of remote states: The imperfect communication
among the kingdoms, and their ignorance of each other's
situation, made it impracticable for a great number of
them to combine in any one project or effort: And above
all, the turbulent spirit and independant situation of the
barons or great vassals in each state gave so much occupa∣tion
<PB N="396" REF="431"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="397" REF="432"/>
to the sovereign, that he was obliged to confine his
attention chiefly to his own system of government, and
was more indifferent about what passed among his neigh∣bours.
Religion only, not politics, carried abroad the
views of princes; and either fixed their thoughts on the
Holy Land, whose conquest and defence was deemed a
point of common honour and interest, or engaged them
in intrigues with the court of Rome, to whom they had
yielded the direction of ecclesiastical affairs, and who
was every day assuming more authority than they were
willing to allow her.</P>
<P>BEFORE the conquest of England by the duke of
Normandy, this island was as much separated from the
rest of the world in politics as in situation; and except
from the inroads of the Danish pirates, the English, hap∣pily
confined at home, had neither enemies nor allies on
the continent. The foreign dominions of William
connected them with the Kings and great vassals of
France; and while the opposite pretensions of the Pope
and Emperor in Italy produced a continual intercourse
between Germany and that country, the two great mo∣narchs
of France and England formed, in another part
of Europe, a separate system, and carried on their wars
and negotiations, without meeting either with opposition
or support from the others.</P>
<P>ON the decline of the Carlovingian race,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> the nobles,
in every province of France, taking advantage of the so∣vereign's
weakness, and obliged to provide, each for his
own defence, against the ravages of the Norman, free∣booters,
had assumed, both in civil and military affairs,
an authority almost independant, and had reduced, within
very narrow limits, the prerogative of their princes. The
accession of Hugh Capet, by annexing a great fief to the
crown, had brought some addition of power to the royal
dignity; but this fief, tho' considerable for a subject,
<PB N="397" REF="433"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="398" REF="434"/>
appeared a narrow basis of force in a prince who was
placed at the head of so great a community. The royal
demesnes consisted only of Paris, Orleans, Estampes,
Compiegne, and a few places, scattered over the nor∣thern
provinces: In all the rest of the kingdom, the
prince's authority was more nominal than real: The
vassals were accustomed, nay intitled, to make war, with∣out
his permission, on each other: They were even en∣titled,
if they conceived themselves to be injured, to turn
their arms against their sovereign: They exercised all
civil jurisdiction, without appeal, over their tenants and
inferior vassals: Their common jealousy of the crown
easily united them against any attempt on their exorbitant
privileges; and as some of them had attained the power
and authority of great princes, even the smallest baron
was sure of immediate and effectual protection. Besides
six ecclesiastical peerages, which, with the other immu∣nities
of the church, cramped extremely the general exe∣cution
of justice; there were six lay-peerages, Burgundy,
Normandy, Guienne, Flanders, Tholouse, and Cham∣pagne,
which, formed very extensive and puissant so∣vereignties.
And tho' the combination of all these prin∣ces
and barons could, on occasion, muster a mighty
power: Yet was it very difficult to set that great machine
in movement; it was almost impossible to preserve har∣mony
in its parts; a sense of common interest alone
could, for a time, unite them under their sovereign
against a common enemy; but if the King attempted to
turn the force of the community against any mutinous
vassal, the same sense of common interest made the others
oppose themselves to the success of his pretensions. Lewis
the Gross, the last sovereign, marched, at one time, to
his frontiers against the Germans at the head of an army
of two hundred thousand men; but a petty lord of Cor∣beil,
of Puiset, of Couci, was able, at another time, to
<PB N="399" REF="435"/>
set that prince at defiance, and to maintain open war
against him.</P>
<P>THE authority of the English monarch was much
more extensive within his kingdom, and the disproportion
much greater between him and the most powerful of his
vassals. His demesnes and revenue were very large, com∣pared
to the greatness of his state: He was accustomed
to levy arbitrary exactions from his subjects: His courts
of judicature exercised jurisdiction in every part of the
kingdom: He could crush by his power, or by a judicial
sentence, well or ill founded, any obnoxious baron:
And tho' the feudal institutions, which prevailed in his
kingdom, had the same tendency, as in other states, to
exalt the aristocracy, and depress the monarchy, it requi∣red,
in England, according to its present constitution, a
great combination of the vassals to oppose their sovereign
lord, and there had not hitherto arisen any baron so
powerful, as of himself to make war against the prince,
and afford protection to the inferior barons.</P>
<P>WHILE such were the different situations of France
and England, and the latter enjoyed so great advanta∣ges
over the former; the accession of Henry II. a prince
of great abilities, possessed of so many rich provinces on
the continent, might appear an event dangerous, if not
fatal, to the French monarchy, and sufficient to break
entirely the balance between the states. He was master,
in the right of his father, of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine;
in that of his mother, of Normandy; in that of his
wife, Guienne, Poictou, Xaintonge, Auvergne, Peri∣gord,
Angoumois, the Limousin. He soon after annexed
Brittany to his other states, and was already possessed
of the superiority over that province, which, on the first
cession of Normandy to Rollo the Dane, had, by Charles
the Simple, been granted in vassalage to that formidable
ravager. These provinces composed above a third of the
<PB N="400" REF="436"/>
whole French monarchy, and were much superior, in
extent and opulence, to those territories, which were
subjected to the immediate jurisdiction and government
of the King. The vassal was here more powerful than
his liege lord: The situation, which had enabled Hugh
Capet to depose the Carlovingian princes, seemed here to
be renewed, and that with much greater advantages on
the side of the vassal: And when England was added to
so many provinces, the French King had reason to appre∣hend,
from this conjuncture, some great disaster to him∣self
and to his family. But in reality, it was this cir∣cumstance,
which appeared so formidable, that saved the
Capetian race, and, by its consequences, exalted them to
that pitch of grandeur, which they at present enjoy.</P>
<P>THE limited authority of the prince in the feudal
constitutions prevented the King of England from em∣ploying
with advantage the force of so many states,
which were subjected to his government; and these dif∣ferent
members, disjoined in situation, and disagreeing in
laws, language and manners, were never thoroughly ce∣mented
into one monarchy. He soon became, both from
his distant place of residence and from the incompatability
of interests, a kind of foreigner to his French dominions;
and his subjects on the continent considered their allegi∣ance
as more naturally due to their superior lord, who
lived in their neighbourhood, and who was acknowledged
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be the supreme head of their nation. He was always
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to invade them; their immediate lord was often
at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great a distance to protect them; and any disorder
in any part of his dispersed dominions gave advantages
against him. The other powerful vassals of the French
crown were rather pleased to see the expulsion of the
English, and were not affected with that jealousy, which
would have arisen from the oppression of a co-vassal, who
was of the same rank with themselves. By this means,
<PB N="401" REF="437"/>
the King of France found it more easy to conquer these
numerous provinces from England, than to subdue a duke
of Normandy or Guienne, a count of Anjou, Maine or
Poictou. And after reducing such extensive territories,
which immediately incorporated with the body of the
monarchy, he found greater facility of uniting to the
crown the other great fiefs, which still remained separate
and independant.</P>
<P>BUT as these important consequences could not be
foreseen by human wisdom, the French King remarked
with terror the rising grandeur of the house of Anjou or
Plantagenet; and in order to retard its progress, he had
ever maintained a strict union with Stephen, and had en∣deavoured
to support the tottering fortunes of that bold
usurper. But after this prince's death, it was too late
to think of opposing the succession of Henry, or pre∣venting
the performance of those stipulations, which,
with the unanimous consent of the nation, he had made
with his predecessor. The English, tired with civil wars,
and disgusted with the bloodshed and depredations, which,
during the course of so many years, had attended them,
were little disposed to violate their oaths, by excluding
the lawful heir from the succession of their monarchy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p. 65.</NOTE>.
Many of the most considerable fortresses were in the
hands of his partizans; the whole nation had had occa∣sion
to see the noble qualities with which he was en∣dowed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neubr. p. 381.</NOTE>,
and to compare them with the mean talents of
William, the son of Stephen; and as they were ac∣quainted
with his great power, and were rather pleased to
see the accession of so many foreign dominions to the
crown of England, they never entertained the least
thoughts of resisting him. Henry himself, sensible of
the advantages attending his present situation, was in
no hurry to arrive in England; and being engaged in
<PB N="402" REF="438"/>
the siege of a castle on the frontiers of Normandy, when
he received intelligence of Stephen's death, he made a
point of honour in not departing from his enterprize,
till he had brought it to an issue. He then set out on
his journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th Decem.</NOTE> and was received in England with the ac∣clamations of all orders of men, who swore with plea∣sure
the oath of fealty and allegiance to him.</P>
<P>THE first act of Henry's government corresponded to
the high ideas entertained of his vigour and abilities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1155.</NOTE> and
prognosticated the re-establishment of justice and tran∣quillity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First acts of Henry's government.</NOTE>
of which the kingdom had been so long bereav∣ed.
He immediately dismissed all those mercenary sol∣diers,
who had committed infinite disorders in the na∣tion;
and he sent them abroad, together with William
d'Ypres, their leader, the great friend and confident of
Stephen<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 13. M. Paris, p. 65. Neubr. p. 381. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 30.</NOTE>. He revoked all the grants made by his pre∣decessor<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 382.</NOTE>,
and even those which necessity had extorted
from the Empress, Matilda; and that princess, who
had resigned her rights in favour of Henry, made no op∣position
to a measure so necessary for supporting the dig∣nity
of the crown. He repaired the coin, which had
been extremely debased during his predecessor's reign;
and he took proper measures against the return of like abuses<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 491.</NOTE>. He was rigorous in the execution of justice,
and in the suppression of robbery and violence; and
that he might restore authority to the laws, he caused
all the new erected castles to be demolished, which had
proved so many sanctuaries to freebooters and rebels<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 491. Fitz-Steph. p. 13. M. Paris, p. 65. Neubr p. 381. Brompton, p. 1043.</NOTE>.
The earl of Albemarle, Hugh Mortimer, and Roger,
the son of Miles of Glocester, were inclined to make
<PB N="403" REF="439"/>
some resistance to this salutary measure; but the ap∣proach
of the King with his forces, soon obliged them
to submit<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 382. Chron. W. Heming. p. 491. Gervase, p. 1377.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EVERY thing being restored to full tranquillity in
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1156.</NOTE> Henry went abroad in order to oppose the at∣tempts
of his brother, Geoffrey, who, during his absence,
had made an incursion into Anjou and Maine, had advan∣ced
some pretensions to these provinces, and had got pos∣session
of a considerable part of them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">William of Newbridge, p. 383. (who is copied by latter historians) asserts, that Geoffrey had some title to the counties of Maine and Anjou. He pretends, that count Geoffrey, his father, had left him these domi∣nions by a secret will, and had ordered that his body should not be bu∣ried, till Henry should swear to the observance of it, which he, igno∣rant of the contents, was induced to do. But besides, that this story is not very likely of itself, and savours of monkish fiction, it is found in no other antient writer, and is contradicted by some of them, par∣ticularly the monk of Marimoutier, who had better opportunities than Newbridge of knowing the truth. See Vita Gaufr. Duc. Norman. p. 103<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. On the King's
appearance, the people returned to their allegiance; and
Geoffrey, resigning his claim, for an annual pension of
a thousand pounds, departed and took possession of the
county of Nantz, which the inhabitants, who had ex∣pelled
count Hoel, their prince, had put into his hands<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1049.</NOTE>.
Henry returned to England in the following year; and
the incursions of the Welsh then provoked him to make
an invasion upon them; where the natural fastnesses of
the country bred him great difficulties, and even brought
him into danger. His vanguard, being engaged in a narrow
pass, was put to rout; and Henry de Essex, the heredi∣tary
standard-bearer, seized with a panic, threw down
the standard, took to flight, and exclaimed that the
King was slain: And had not that prince immediately
appeared in person, and led on his troops with great
<PB N="404" REF="440"/>
bravery, the consequences might have proved fatal to the
whole army<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Newbr. p. 383. Chron. W. Heming. p. 492.</NOTE>. For this misbehaviour, Essex was after∣wards
accused of felony by Robert de Montfort;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1157.</NOTE> his
estate was confiscated; and he himself was thrust into a
convent<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 70. Newbr. p. 383.</NOTE>. The submissions of the Welsh procured them
an accommodation with England.</P>
<P>THE martial disposition of the princes in that age en∣gaged
them to head their own armies in every enterprize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1158.</NOTE>
even the most frivolous; and their feeble authority made
it commonly impracticable for them to delegate, on oc∣casion,
the command to their generals. Geoffrey, the
King's brother, died soon after he had acquired possession
of Nantz; and tho' he had no other title to that coun∣ty,
than the voluntary submission or election of the in∣habitants
two years before, Henry laid claim to the ter∣ritory
as devolved to him by hereditary right, and he
went over to support his pretensions by force of arms.
Conan, duke or earl of Britanny (for these titles are gi∣ven
indifferently by historians to these princes) pretended
that Nantz had been lately separated by rebellion from
his principality, to which of right it belonged; and im∣mediately
on Geoffrey's death, he took possession of the
disputed territory. Lest Lewis, the French King, should
interpose in the controversy, Henry paid him a visit;
and so allured him by caresses and civilities, that an al∣liance
was contracted between the monarchs, and they
agreed, that young Henry, heir of the English monar∣chy,
should be affianced to Margaret of France<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 68. M. West. p. 248. Trivet, p. 35.</NOTE>, tho'
the former was only five years of age, and the latter
was still in her cradle. Henry, now secure of meeting
with no interruption on this side, advanced with his army
<PB N="405" REF="441"/>
into Britanny; and Conan, in despair of being able
to make resistance, delivered up the county of Nantz to
the King: The ability of that monarch procured him
farther and more important advantages from this incident.
Conan, harassed with the turbulent disposition of his
subjects, was desirous of procuring to himself the sup∣port
of so great a monarch; and he betrothed his daugh∣ter
and only child, yet an infant, to Geoffrey, the King's
third son, who was of the same tender years. The
duke of Britanny died about seven years after; and
Henry, on pretence of being guardian to his son and
daughter-in-law, put himself in possession of that prin∣cipality,
and annexed it to his other great dominions<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 517. Newbr. p. 396. Chron. W. Heming. p. 496.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King had a prospect of making still farther ac∣quisitions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1159.</NOTE>
and the activity of his temper allowed no
opportunity of that kind to escape him. Philippa, dutch∣ess
of Guienne, mother of Queen Eleanor, was the
only issue of William IV. count of Thoulouse; and
should have inherited his dominions, had not that prince,
desirous of preserving the succession in the male-line,
conveyed the principality to his brother, Raymond de
St. Gilles, by a contract of sale which was in that age
regarded as fictitious and illusory. By this means, the
title to the county of Thoulouse came to be disputed be∣tween
the male and female heirs; and the one or the
other, as opportunities favoured them, had obtained pos∣session.
Alfonso, the son of Raymond, was the reigning
sovereign; and on Henry's reviving his wife's claim,
this prince had recourse for protection to the King of
France, who was so much concerned in policy to prevent
the farther aggrandizement of the English monarch.
Lewis himself, when married to Eleanor, had asserted
<PB N="406" REF="442"/>
the justice of her claim, and had demanded possession of
Thoulouse<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Newbr. p. 387. Chron. W. Heming. p. 494.</NOTE>; but his sentiments changing with his
interest, he now determined to defend, by his power and
authority, the title of Alfonso. Henry found, that it
would be requisite to support his pretensions against po∣tent
antagonists; and that nothing but a great army
could maintain a claim, which he had in vain asserted by
arguments and manifestos.</P>
<P>AN army, composed of feudal vassals, was commonly
very intractable and undisciplined, both because of the
independant spirit of the persons who served in it, and
because the commands were not given either by the choice
of the sovereign or from the military capacity and expe∣rience
of the officers. Each baron conducted his own
vassals: His rank was greater or less, proportioned to
the extent of his property: Even the supreme command
under the prince was often attached to birth: And as the
military vassals were obliged to serve only forty days at
their own charge; tho', if the expedition was distant,
they were put to great expence; the prince reaped very
little benefit from their attendance. Henry, sensible of
these inconveniencies, levied upon his vassals in Nor∣mandy
and other provinces, which were remote from
Thoulouse, a sum of money in lieu of their service; and
this commutation, by reason of the great distance, was
still more advantageous for his English vassals, He im∣posed,
therefore, a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utage of three pounds on each
knight's fee, a condition, to which, tho' it was unusual,
and the first perhaps to be met with in history<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, vol. i. p. 1216. Gervase, p. 1381.</NOTE>, the mi∣litary
tenants willingly submitted; and with this money,
he levied an army which was more under his command,
and whose service was more durable and constant.
Assisted by Berenger, count of Barcelona, and Trincaval,
<PB N="407" REF="443"/>
count of Nismes, whom he had gained over to his party,
he invaded the county of Thoulouse; and after taking
Verdun, Chastelnau, and other places, he besieged the
capital of the province, and was likely to prevail in the
enterprize; when Lewis, advancing before the arrival
of his main body, threw himself into the place with a
small reinforcement. Henry was urged by some of his
ministers to prosecute the siege, to take Lewis prisoner,
and to impose his own terms in the pacification; but he
either thought it so much his interest to maintain the
feudal principles, by which his foreign dominions were
secured, or bore so much respect to his superior lord,
that he declared he would not attack a place defended by
him in person; and he immediately raised the siege<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 22. Diceto, p. 531.</NOTE>.
He marched into Normandy to protect that province
against an incursion, which the count of Dreux, insti∣gated
by King Lewis, his brother, had made upon it.
War was now openly carried on between the two mo∣narchs,
but produced no memorable event, and was
stopped by a cessation of arms, and afterwards by a peace,
which was not, however, attended with any confidence
or good correspondence between these rival princes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1160.</NOTE> The
fortress of Gisors, being part of the dowry stipulated to
Margaret of France, had been consigned by agreement
to the knights templars, on condition that it should be
delivered into Henry's hands, after the celebration of
the nuptials. The King, that he might have a pretence
for immediately demanding the place, ordered the mar∣riage
to be solemnized between the prince and princess,
tho' both infants<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 492. Newbr. 400. Diceto, p. 532. Brompton, p. 1450.</NOTE>; and he engaged the grand-master of
the Temple, by large presents, as was generally suspected,
to put him in possession of Gisors. Lewis resenting this
<PB N="408" REF="444"/>
fraudulent conduct, banished the templars from France,
and would have made war upon the King of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1161.</NOTE>
had it not been for the mediation and authority of Pope
Alexander III. who had been chaced from Rome by
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntipope, Victor IV. and resided at that time in
France. That we may form a notion of the authority
possessed by the Roman Pontiff during those ages, it may
be proper to remark, that the two Kings had, the year
before, met the Pope at the castle of Torci on the Loir;
and they gave him such marks of respect, that both dis∣mounted
from their horses to receive him, and holding
each of them one of the reins of his bridle, walked on
foot by his side, and conducted him in that submissive
manner into the castle<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1162.</NOTE> soon after he had accommodated his differ∣ences
with Lewis by the Pope's mediation, returned to
England; where he commenced an enterprize, which,
tho' required by sound policy, and even conducted in
the main with prudence, bred him infinite disquietude,
involved him in great danger, and was not concluded
without some loss and dishonour.</P>
<P>THE usurpations of the clergy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputes between the civil and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cclesiasti∣cal powers.</NOTE> which had at first
been gradual, were now become so rapid, and had
mounted to such a height, that the contest between the
regale and pontificale was really arrived at a crisis in
England; and it became necessary to determine whether
the King or the priests, particularly the archbishop of
Canterbury, should be sovereign of the kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 27.</NOTE>. The
aspiring spirit of Henry, which gave inquietude to all his
neighbours, was not likely to pay long a tame sub∣mission
to the encroachments of subjects; and as nothing
opens men's eyes so readily as their interest, he was in
no danger of falling, in this respect, into that abject su∣perstion,
<PB N="408" REF="445"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="409" REF="446"/>
which retained his people in subjection.
From the commencement of his reign, in the govern∣ment
of his foreign dominions, as well as of England,
he had showed a fixed purpose to repress clerical usur∣pations,
and to maintain those prerogatives, which had
been transmitted to him by his predecessors. During
the schism of the papacy between Alexander and Victor,
he had determined, for some time, to remain neuter;
and when he was informed, that the archbishop of Roüen
and the bishop of Mans had, from their own authority,
acknowledged Alexander as legitimate Pope, he was so
enraged, that, tho' he spared the archbishop on account
of his age, he immediately issued orders for overthrow∣ing
the houses of the bishop of Mans and archdeacon of
Roüen<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Stephen, p. 18. This conduct appears violent and arbitra∣ry; but was suitable to the strain of administration in those days. His father, Geoffrey, tho' represented as a mild prince, set him an example of much greater violence. When Geoffrey was master of Normandy, the chapter of Seez presumed, without his consent, to proceed to the election of a bishop; upon which he ordered all of them with the bi∣shop-elect to be castrated, and made all their testicles be brought him in a platter. Fitz Steph. p. 44. In the war of Thoulouse Henry laid a heavy and an arbitrary tax on all the churches within his dominions. See Epist, St. Thom, p. 232.</NOTE>; and it was not till he had deliberately examin∣ed
the matter, by those views, which usually enter into
the councils of princes, that he allowed that pontiff to
exercise authority over any of his dominions. In Eng∣land,
the mild character and advanced years of Theo∣bald,
archbishop of Canterbury, together with his merits
in refusing to put the crown on the head of Eustace, son
of Stephen, prevented Henry, during the lifetime of that
primate, from taking any measures against the multi∣plied
encroachments of the clergy: But after his death,
the King resolved to exert himself with more activity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 28.</NOTE>;
and that he might be secure against any opposition, he
<PB N="409" REF="447"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="410" REF="448"/>
advanced to that dignity Becket, his chancellor, on
whose compliance, he thought, he could entirely de∣pend.</P>
<P>THOMAS a Becket,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 3. Thomas a Becket, archbishop of Canterbury.</NOTE> the first man of English pedi∣gree,
who, since the Norman conquest, had, during the
course of a whole century, risen to any considerable sta∣tion,
was born of reputable parents in the city of Lon∣don;
and being endowed both with industry and capa∣city,
he early insinuated himself into the favour of arch∣bishop Theobald<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quadripartita, p. 6. M. Paris, p. 69. Newbr. p. 393.</NOTE>, and obtained from that prelate some
preferments and offices. By their means, he was en∣abled
to travel for farther improvement to Italy, where
he studied the civil and canon law at Bologna<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 12. Brompton, p. 1057.</NOTE>; and on
his return, he appeared to have made such proficiency in
knowledge, that he was promoted by his patron to the
archdeaconry of Canterbury, an office of considerable
trust and profit<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quadr. p. 6. M. Paris, p. 69.</NOTE>. He was afterwards employed with
success by Theobald in transacting business at Rome;
and on Henry's accession, he was recommended to that
monarch as worthy of farther preferment<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1057. Gervase, p. 1377.</NOTE>. Henry,
who knew that Becket had been instrumental in support∣ing
that resolution of the archbishop, which had tended
so much to facilitate his own advancement to the throne,
was already prepossessed in his favour; and finding, on
farther acquaintance, that his spirit and abilities entitled
him to any trust, he soon promoted him to the dig∣nity
of chancellor, one of the first civil offices in the
kingdom. The chancellor, in that age, besides the
custody of the great seal, had possession of all vacant
prelacies and abbies; he was the guardian of all such
minors and pupils as were the King's tenants; all baro∣nies
which escheated to the crown were under his
<PB N="411" REF="449"/>
administration; he was entitled to a place in council,
even tho' he was not particularly summoned; and as he
exercised also the office of secretary of state, and it be∣longed
to him to countersign all commissions, writs,
and letters-patent, he was a kind of prime minister, and
was concerned in the dispatch of every business of im∣portance<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 13.</NOTE>.
After obtaining this high office, Becket, as
he advanced in favour, was made provost of Beverley,
dean of Hastings, and constable of the Tower: He was
put in possession of the honours of Eye and Berkham,
large baronies that had escheated to the crown; and to
compleat his grandeur, he was entrusted with the educa∣tion
of prince Henry, the King's eldest son, and heir
of the monarchy<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 15. Hist. Quad. p. 9, 14.</NOTE>. The pomp of his retinue, the sump∣tuousness
of his furniture, the luxury of his table,
the munificence of his presents, corresponded to these great
preferments; or rather exceeded any thing, which
England had ever before seen in any subject. His histo∣rian
and secretary, Fitz-Stephens<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">P. 15.</NOTE>, mentions, among
other particulars, that his apartments were every day in
winter covered with clean straw or hay, and in sum∣mer
with green rushes or boughs; left the gentlemen
who paid their court to him, and who could not, by
reason of their great number, find a place at table,
should soil their fine cloaths by sitting on a dirty floor<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">John Baldwin held the manor of Oterarsfee in Aylesbury of the King in soccage, by the service of finding litter for the King's bed, viz. in summer, grass or herbs, and two grey geese, and in winter straw and three eels, thrice in a year, if the King should come thrice in a year to Aylesbury. Madox, Bar. Anglica, p. 247.</NOTE>. A great number of knights were retained in his service;
the greatest barons were proud of being received at his
table; his house was a place of education for the sons
of the chief nobility; and the King himself frequently
<PB N="412" REF="450"/>
vouchsafed to partake of his entertainments. As his
way of life was splendid and opulent, his amusements
and occupations were gay, and partook of the cavalier
spirit, which, as he had only taken deacon's orders, he
did not think unbefitting his character. He employed
himself at leisure hours in hunting, hawking, gaming,
and horsemanship; he exposed his person in several mili∣tary
actions<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 23. Hist. Quad. p. 9.</NOTE>; he carried over, at his own charge,
seven hundred knights to attend the King in his wars
at Tholouse; in the subsequent wars on the frontiers of
Normandy, he maintained, during forty days, twelve
hundred knights, and four thousand of their train<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 19, 20, 22, 23.</NOTE>;
and in an embassy to France, with which he was en∣trusted,
he astonished that court with the number and
magnificence of his retinue.</P>
<P>HENRY, besides committing all his more important
business to Becket's management, honoured him with
his friendship and intimacy; and whenever he was dis∣posed
to relax himself by sports of any kind, he admit∣ted
his chancellor to the party<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 16. Hist. Quad. p. 8.</NOTE>. An instance of their
familiarity is mentioned by Fitz-Stephens, which, as it
shows the manners of the age, it may not be improper
to relate. One day, as the King and chancellor were
riding together in the streets of London, they observed
a beggar, who was shivering with cold. Would it not
be very praise-worthy, said the King, to give that poor
man a warm coat in this severe season? It would, surely,
replied the chancellor; and you do well, Sir, in think∣ing
of such good actions. Then he shall have one pre∣sently,
cried the King: And seizing the skirt of the
chancellor's coat, began to pull it violently. The chan∣cellor
defended himself for some time; and they had
<PB N="413" REF="451"/>
both of them like to have tumbled off their horses in
the street, when Becket, after a vehement struggle, let
go his coat; which the King bestowed on the beggar,
who, being ignorant of the quality of the persons, was
not a little surprised with the present<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BECKET, who, by his complaisance and good hu∣mour,
had rendered himself agreeable, and by his indus∣try
and abilities useful, to his master, appeared to him
the fittest person for supplying the vacancy made by the
death of Theobald; and as he was well acquainted
with the King's intention<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 17.</NOTE> of retrenching, or rather con∣fining
within the antient bounds, all ecclesiastical privi∣leges,
and showed always a ready disposition to comply
with them<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Fitz Steph. p. 23. Epist. St. Thom. p. 232.</NOTE>, Henry, who never expected any resistance
from that quarter, immediately issued orders for electing
him archbishop of Canterbury. But this resolution,
which was taken contrary to the opinion of Matilda,
and many of the ministers<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 167.</NOTE>, turned out very unfortu∣nate
in the event; and never prince of so great penetra∣tion,
appeared, in the issue, to have so little understood
the genius and character of his minister.</P>
<P>NO sooner was Becket installed in this high dignity,
which rendered him for life the second person in the
kingdom, with some pretensions of aspiring to be the
first, than he totally altered his demeanour and con∣duct<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 69. Neubr. p. 393. Diceto, p. 534. Ger∣vase, p. 1383.</NOTE>,
and endeavoured to retrieve the character of sanc∣tity,
of which his former busy and ostentatious course of
life might, in the eyes of the people, have naturally be∣reaved
him. Without consulting the King, he imme∣diately
returned into his hands the commission of chan∣cellor<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 32. M. Paris, p. 69. Diceto, p. 534.</NOTE>;
<PB N="414" REF="452"/>
pretending, that he must henceforth detach
himself from secular affairs, and be solely employed in
the exercise of his sacred function; but in reality, that
he might break off all connexions with Henry, and ap∣prise
him, that Becket, as primate of England, was
now become entirely a new personage. He maintained
only, in his retinue and attendants, his antient pomp and
lustre, which was useful to strike the vulgar: In his own
person he affected the greatest austerity, and most rigid
mortification, which, he was sensible, would have an
equal or a greater tendency to the same end. He wore
sack-cloth next his skin, which, by his affected care to
conceal it, was necessarily the more remarked by all the
world<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 24. Hist. Quad. p. 17, 18. Hoveden, p. 520. Trivet, p. 42.</NOTE>: He changed it so seldom, that it was filled
with dirt and vermin<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 24.</NOTE>: His usual diet was bread; his
drink water<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 520.</NOTE>, which he even rendered farther unpa∣latable
by the mixture of unsavoury herbs: He tore his
back with the frequent discipline which he inflicted on
it: He daily on his knees washed, in imitation of our
Saviour, the feet of thirteen beggars, whom he after∣wards
dismissed with presents<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fitz. Steph. p. 25. Hist. Quad. p. 19.</NOTE>: He gained the affections
of the monks by his frequent charities to the convents
and hospitals: Every one who made profession of sanc∣tity
was admitted to his conversation, and returned full
of panegyrics on the humility, as well as the piety and
mortification, of the holy primate: He seemed to be per∣petually
employed in reciting prayers and pious lectures,
or in perusing religious discourses: His aspect wore the
appearance of seriousness, and mental recollection, and
secret devotion: And all men of penetration plainly saw,
that he was meditating some great design, and that the
<PB N="415" REF="453"/>
ambition and ostentation of his character had turned it∣self
towards a new and more dangerous object.</P>
<P>BECKET waited not till Henry should commence those
projects against the ecclesiastical power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1163.</NOTE> which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarrel be∣tween the King and Becket.</NOTE> he knew,
had been formed by that prince: He was himself the
aggressor; and endeavoured to overawe the King by
the intrepidity and boldness of his enterprizes. He sum∣moned
the earl of Clare to surrender the barony of Tun∣bridge,
which, ever since the conquest, had remained
in the family of that nobleman, but which, as it had
formerly belonged to the see of Canterbury, the primate
pretended his predecessors were prohibited by the canons
to alienate. The earl of Clare, besides the lustre which
he derived from the greatness of his own birth, and the
extent of his possessions, was allied to all the chief fami∣lies
in the kingdom; his sister, who was a celebrated
beauty, had farther extended his credit among the nobi∣lity,
and was even supposed to have gained the King's
affections; and Becket could not better discover, than
by attacking so powerful an interest, his resolution to
maintain with vigour the rights, real or pretended, of
his see<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 28. Gervase, p. 1384.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WILLIAM de Eynsford, a military tenant of the
crown, was patron of a living, which belonged to a
manor that held of the archbishop of Canterbury; and
Becket, without regard to William's right, presented,
on a new and illegal pretext, one Laurence to that living,
who was violently expelled by Eynsford. The primate,
making himself, as was usual in spiritual courts, both
judge and party, issued out, in a summary manner, the
sentence of excommunication against Eynsford, who
complained to the King, that he, who held <HI>in capite</HI> of
the crown, should, contrary to the practice established
<PB N="416" REF="454"/>
by the Conqueror, and maintained ever since by his suc∣cessors,
be subjected to that terrible sentence, without
the previous consent of the sovereign<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 70. Diceto, p. 536.</NOTE>. Henry, who had
now broke off all personal intercourse with Becket, sent
him, by a messenger, his orders to absolve Eynsford;
but received for answer, that it belonged not to the King
to inform him whom he should absolve and whom ex∣communicate<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 28.</NOTE>: And it was not till after many remon∣strances
and menaces, that Becket, tho' with the worst
grace imaginable, was induced to comply with the royal
mandate.</P>
<P>HENRY, tho' he found himself thus grievously mis∣taken
in the character of the person whom he had pro∣moted
to the primacy, determined not to desist from his
former intention of retrenching clerical usurpations. He
was entirely master of his extensive dominions: The
prudence and vigour of his government, attended with
perpetual success, had raised his character above that of
any of his predecessors<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 130.</NOTE>: The papacy was weakened by
a schism, which divided all Europe: And he rightly
judged, that, if the present favourable opportunity were
neglected, the crown must, from the prevalent super∣stition
of the people, be in danger of falling into an en∣tire
subordination under the mitre.</P>
<P>THE union of the civil and ecclesiastical powers serves
extremely, in every civilized government, to the main∣tenance
of peace and order; and prevents those mutual
incroachments, which, as there can be no ultimate judge
between them, are often attended with the most dan∣gerous
consequences. Whether the supreme magistrate,
who unites these powers, receives the appellation of prince
or prelate, it is not material: The superior weight,
which temporal interests commonly bear in the appre∣hensions
<PB N="417" REF="455"/>
of men above spiritual, renders the civil part
of his character most prevalent; and in time prevents
those gross impostures and bigotted persecutions, which,
in all false religions, are the chief foundation of cleri∣cal
authority. But during the progress of ecclesiastical
usurpations, the state, by the resistance of the civil ma∣gistrate,
is naturally thrown into convulsions; and it be∣hoves
the prince, both for his own interest, and for that
of the public, to provide in time sufficient barriers against
so dangerous and insidious a rival. This precaution had
been hitherto much neglected in England, as well as in
other catholic countries; and affairs at last seemed to
have come to a dangerous crisis: A sovereign of the
greatest abilities was now on the throne: A prelate of
the most inflexible and intrepid character was possessed
of the primacy: The contending powers appeared to be
armed with their full force, and it was natural to ex∣pect
some extraordinary event to result from their ren∣counter.</P>
<P>AMONG their other inventions to obtain money, the
clergy had inculcated the necessity of penance as an
atonement for sin; and having again introduced the prac∣tice
of paying them large sums as a commutation, or
species of atonement, for the remission of these penan∣ces,
the sins of the people, by these means, had become
a revenue to the priests; and the King computed, that,
by this invention alone, they levied more money from
his subjects, than flowed, by all the funds and taxes,
into the royal exchequer<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 32.</NOTE>. That he might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ease his
subjects of so heavy and arbitrary an imposition, Henry
required, that a civil officer of his appointment should
be present in all ecclesiastical courts, and should, for
the future, give his consent to every composition which
was made with sinners for their spiritual offences.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="456"/>
THE ecclesiastics, in that age, had renounced all im∣mediate
subordination to the magistrate: They openly
pretended to an exemption, in criminal accusations,
from a trial before courts of justice; and were gradually
introducing a like exemption in civil causes: Spiritual
penalties alone could be inflicted on their offences: And
as the clergy had extremely multiplied in England, and
many of them were consequently of very low charac∣ters,
crimes of the deepest dye, murders, robberies,
adulteries, rapes, were daily committed with impunity
by the ecclesiastics. It had been found, for instance,
by enquiry, that no less than an hundred murders had,
since the King's accession, been perpetrated by men of
that profession, who had never been called to account
for these offences<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 394.</NOTE>; and holy orders were become a full
protection for all enormities. A clerk in Worcestershire,
having debauched a gentleman's daughter, had, at this
time, proceeded to murder the father; and the general
indignation against this crime moved the King to attempt
the remedy of an abuse which was become so palpable,
and to require that the clerk should be delivered up,
and receive condign punishment from the magistrate<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 33. Hist. Quad. p. 32.</NOTE>.
Becket insisted on the privileges of the church; confined
the criminal to the bishop's prison, lest he should be
seized by the King's officers; maintained that no greater
punishment could be inflicted on him than degradation:
And when the King demanded, that, immediately after
he was degraded, he should be tried by the civil power,
the primate asserted, that it was iniquitous to try a
man twice upon the same accusation, and for the same
crime<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 29. Hist. Quad. p. 33. 45. Hoveden, p. 492. M. Paris, p. 72. Diceto, p. 536, 537. Brompton, p. 1058. Ger∣vase, p. 1384. Epist. St. Thom. p. 208, 209.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="457"/>
HENRY, laying hold of so favourable a cause, resolv∣ed
to push the clergy with regard to all their privileges,
which they had raised to an enormous height, and to
determine at once those controversies, which daily mul∣tiplied,
between the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions.
He summoned an assembly of all the prelates of England;
and he put to them this concise and decisive question,
Whether or not they were willing to submit to the an∣tient
laws and customs of the kingdom? The bishops
unanimously replied, that they were willing, <HI>saving their
own order</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 31. Hist. Quad. p. 34. Hoveden, p. 492. Gervase, p. 1385.</NOTE>: A device by which they thought to elude
the present urgency of the King's demand, and yet re∣serve
to themselves, on a favourable opportunity, the
power of resuming all their past pretensions. The King
was sensible of the artifice, and was provoked to the
highest indignation. He left the assembly, with visible
marks of his displeasure: He required the primate in∣stantly
to surrender the honours and castles of Eye and
Berkham<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 35. Gervase, p. 1385.</NOTE>: The bishops were terrified, and expected
still farther effects of his resentment. Becket alone was
inflexible; and nothing but the interposition of the Pope's
legate, Philip, abbot of Eleemosina, who dreaded a
breach with so powerful a prince at so unseasonable a
juncture, could have prevailed on him to retract the sav∣ing
clause, and give a general and absolute promise of
observing the antient customs<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quadr. p. 37. Hoveden, p. 493. Gervase, p. 1385.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT Henry was not content with a declaration in
these general terms: He resolved, ere it was too late,
to define expressly those customs, with which he required
compliance, and to put a stop to clerical usurpations,
before they were fully consolidated, and could plead an∣tiquity,
as they already did a sacred authority, in their
<PB N="420" REF="458"/>
favour. The claims of the church were open and visi∣ble.
After a gradual and insensible progress thro' many
centuries, the mask had at last been taken off, and se∣veral
ecclesiastical councils, by their canons, which were
pretended to be irrevocable and infallible, had positively
defined those privileges and immunities, which gave such
general offence, and appeared so dangerous, to the civil
magistrate. Henry therefore deemed it necessary to de∣fine
with the same precision the limits of the civil power;
to oppose his legal customs to their divine ordinances;
to determine the exact boundaries of the rival jurisdic∣tions;
and for this purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1164.</NOTE> he summoned a general
council of the nobility and prelates at Clarendon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Jan.</NOTE> to
whom he submitted this great and important question.</P>
<P>THE barons were all gained to the King's party,
either by the reasons which he urged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Constitutions of Clarendon.</NOTE> or by his superior
authority: The bishops were overawed by the general
combination against them: And the following laws,
commonly called the <HI>Constitu∣tions
of Clarendon,</HI> were voted
without opposition by this assembly<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p 33.</NOTE>. It was enacted,
that all suits concerning the advowson and presentation
of churches should be determined in the civil courts:
That the churches, belonging to the King's fee, should
not be granted in perpetuity without his consent: That
clerks, accused of any crime, should be tried in the civil
courts: That no person, particularly no clergyman of
any rank, should depart the kingdom without the King's
licence: That excommunicated persons should not be
bound to give security for continuing in their present
place of abode: That laics should not be accused in spi∣ritual
courts, except by legal and reputable promoters
and witnesses: That no chief tenant of the crown should
be excommunicated, nor his lands be put under an in∣terdict,
except with the King's consent: That all ap∣peals
<PB N="420" REF="459"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="421" REF="460"/>
in spiritual causes should be carried from the arch∣deacon
to the bishop, from the bishop to the primate,
from him to the King; and should be carried no far∣ther
without the King's consent: That if any law-suit
arise between a layman and a clergyman concerning a te∣nement,
and it be disputed whether the land be a lay
or an ecclesiastical see, it should first be determined by
the verdict of twelve lawful men to what class it be∣longed,
and if it be found to be a lay-fee, the cause
should finally be determined in the civil courts: That
no inhabitant in demesne, should be excommunicated
for non-appearance in a spiritual court, till the chief of∣ficer
of the place, where he resides, be consulted, that
he may compel him by the civil authority to give satis∣faction
to the church: That the archbishops, bishops,
and other spiritual dignitaries should be regarded as ba∣rons
of the realm; should possess the privileges and be
subjected to the burthens belonging to that rank; and
should be bound to attend the King in his great coun∣cils,
and assist at all trials, till the sentence, either of
death or loss of members, be given against the criminal:
That the revenue of the vacant sees should belong to the
King; the chapter, or such of them as he shall sum∣mon,
should sit in the King's chapel till they make the
new election with his consent, and that the bishop-elect
should do homage to the crown: That if any baron or
tenant <HI>in capite</HI> shall refuse to submit to the spiritual
courts, the King should employ his authority in oblig∣ing
him to make such submissions; if any of them throw
off his allegiance to the King, the prelates should with

of the civil courts: And that the sons of villains should
not be ordained clerks, without the consent of their
lord<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quadr. p. 163. M. Paris, p. 70, 71. Spelm. Conc. vol. ii. p. 63. Gervase, p. 1386, 1387. Wilkins, p. 321.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE articles, to the number of sixteen, were cal∣culated
to prevent the principal abuses, which had pre∣vailed
in ecclesiastical affairs, and to put an effectual
stop to the usurpations of the church, which, gradually
stealing on, had threatened the total destruction of the
civil power. Henry, therefore, by reducing these cus∣toms
to writing and collecting them in a body, endea∣voured
to prevent all future dispute with regard to
them; and by passing so many ecclesiastical ordinances
in a national and civil assembly, he fully established the
superiority of the legislature above all papal decrees or
spiritual canons, and gained a signal victory over the ec∣clesiastics.
But as he knew, that the bishops, tho'
overawed by the present combination of the crown and
the barons, would take the first favourable opportunity
of denying the authority, which had enacted these con∣stitutions;
he resolved, that they should all set their seal
to them, and give a promise to observe them. None of
the prelates dared to oppose his will; except Becket,
who, tho' urged by the earls of Cornwal and Leicester,
the barons of principal authority in the kingdom, ob∣stinately
with-held his consent. At last, Richard de
Hastings, grand prior of the templars in England, threw
himself on his knees before him; and with many tears,
entreated him, if he paid any regard, either to his own
safety or that of the church, not to provoke, by a fruit∣less
opposition, the indignation of a great monarch,
who was resolutely bent on his purpose, and who was
determined to take full revenge on every one, who
<PB N="423" REF="463"/>
should dare to oppose him<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 38. Hoveden, p. 493.</NOTE>; Becket, finding himself
deserted by all the world, and even by his own brethren,
in this cause, was at last obliged to comply; and he set
his seal to the constitutions; promised, <HI>legally, with good
faith, and without fraud or reserve</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 35. Epist. St. Thom. p. 23.</NOTE>, to observe them;
and even took an oath to that purpose<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 45. Hist. Quad. p. 39. Gervase, p. 1386.</NOTE>. The King,
thinking that he had now finally prevailed in this great
enterprize, sent the constitutions to Pope Alexander,
who then resided in France; and he required that Pon∣tiff's
ratification of them: But Alexander, who plainly
saw, that these laws were calculated to establish the in∣dependancy
of England on the papacy, and of the royal
power on the clergy, condemned them in the strongest
terms; abrogated, annulled, and rejected them<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 35.</NOTE>. There
were only six articles, the least important, which, for
the sake of peace, he was willing to ratify.</P>
<P>BECKET, when he observed, that he might hope for
support in an opposition, expressed the deepest sorrow for
his concessions; and endeavoured to engage all the other
bishops in a confederacy to adhere to their common
rights, and to the ecclesiastical privileges, in which he
represented the interest and honour of God to be so deeply
concerned. He redoubled his austerities in order to pu∣nish
himself for his criminal compliance<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quadr. p. 40, 41. Hoveden, p. 493. M. Paris, p. 71.</NOTE>: He propor∣tioned
his discipline to the enormity of his supposed of∣fence:
And he refused to exercise any part of his archi∣episcopal
function, till he should receive absolution from
the Pope, which was readily granted him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Gervase, p. 1388. Parker, p. 203. Epist. St. Thom. p. 40, 41.</NOTE>. Henry,
informed of his present dispositions, resolved to take ven∣geance
<PB N="424" REF="464"/>
for this refractory behaviour; and he attempted
to crush him, by means of that very power which Becket
made such merit in supporting. He applied to the Pope
for the commission of legate in his dominions; but Alex∣ander,
as politic as he, tho' he granted him the commis∣sion,
annexed a clause, that it should not empower him
to execute any act in prejudice of the archbishop of Can∣terbury<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 13, 14.</NOTE>: And the King, finding how fruitless such an
authority would prove, sent back the commission by the
same messengers who brought it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 493. Gervase, p. 1388.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE primate, however, who found himself still ex∣posed
to the King's indignation, endeavoured twice to
escape secretly from the kingdom; but was as often de∣tained
by contrary winds<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fitz Steph. p. 35. Hist. Quad. p. 42. M. Paris, p. 72.</NOTE>: And Henry hastened to make
him feel the effects of an obstinacy, which he deemed so
criminal. He instigated John, mareschal of the exche∣quer,
to sue Becket, in the archiepiscopal-court for
some lands, part of the manor of Pageham; and to ap∣peal
from thence to the King's court for justice<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 494. M. Paris, p. 72. Diceto, p. 537.</NOTE>. On
the day appointed for trying the cause, the primate sent
four knights, to represent certain irregularities in John's
appeal; and at the same time to excuse himself, on ac∣count
of sickness, for not appearing personally that day
in the court. This slight offence (if it even deserves
that name) was represented as a grievous contempt; the
four knights were menaced, and with difficulty escaped
being sent to prison, as offering falshoods to the court<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 36.</NOTE>;
and Henry, being determined to persecute Becket to the
utmost, summoned at Northampton a great council,
<PB N="425" REF="465"/>
whom he proposed to make the instruments of his ven∣geance
against this inflexible prelate.</P>
<P>THE King had raised Becket from a low station to the
highest offices, had honoured him with his counte∣nance
and friendship, had trusted to his assistance in for∣warding
his favourite project against the clergy; and
when he found him become of a sudden his most rigid op∣ponent,
while every one beside complied with his will,
rage at the disappointment, and indignation against such
signal ingratitude, transported him beyond all bounds of
moderation; and there seems to have entered more of
passion than of justice or even of policy, in this violent
prosecution<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 394.</NOTE>. The barons, however, in the great coun∣cil
voted whatever sentence he was pleased to dictate to
them; and the bishops themselves, who undoubtedly
bore a secret favour to Becket, and regarded him as the
martyr of their privileges, concurred with the rest, in
the design of oppressing their primate. In vain did
Becket urge, that his court was proceeding with the
utmost regularity and justice in trying the mareschal's
cause, which, however, he said, would appear, from the
sheriff's testimony, to be entirely unjust and iniquitous:
That he himself had discovered no contempt of the King's
court; but on the contrary, by sending four knights to
excuse his absence, had virtually acknowledged its
authority: That he also, in consequence of the King's
summons, personally appeared at present in the great
council, ready to justify his cause against the mareschal,
and to submit his conduct to their enquiry and juris∣diction:
And that even should he be found to have been
guilty of non-appearance, the laws had affixed a very
slight penalty to that offence; and that, as he was an
inhabitant of Kent, where his archiepiscopal palace was
seated, he was by law entitled to some greater indul∣gence
<PB N="426" REF="466"/>
than usual in the rate of his fine<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 37. 42.</NOTE>. He was con∣demned,
notwithstanding these pleas, as guilty of a con∣tempt
of the King's court, and as wanting in the fealty
which he had sworn to his sovereign; all his goods and
chattels were confiscated<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 47. Hoveden, p. 494. Gervase, p. 1389.</NOTE>; and that this triumph over
the church might be carried to the utmost, Henry, bishop
of Winchester, the prelate who had been so powerful
in the former reign, was, notwithstanding his remon∣strances,
obliged, by order of the court, to pronounce
the sentence against him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 37.</NOTE>. The primate submitted to
the decree; and all the prelates, except Gilbert, bishop
of London, who paid court to the King by this singu∣larity,
became sureties for him<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 37.</NOTE>. It is remarkable, that
several Norman barons voted in this council; and we
may conclude, with some probability, that a like practice
had prevailed in many of the great councils summoned
since the conquest. For the contemporary historian, who
has given us a full account of these transactions, does not
mention this circumstance as any wise singular<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 36.</NOTE>; and
Becket, in all his subsequent remonstrances with regard
to the severe treatment, which he had met with, never
founds any objection on an irregularity, which to us ap∣pears
very palpable and flagrant. So little precision was
there at that time in the government and constitution!</P>
<P>THE King was not content with this sentence, how∣ever
violent and oppressive. Next day, he demanded of
Becket the sum of three hundred pounds, which the pri∣mate
had levied from the honours of Eye and Berkham,
while in his possession. Becket, after premising that he
was not obliged to answer this suit, because it was not
contained in his summons; after remarking, that he had
expended more than that sum in the repairs of these
<PB N="427" REF="467"/>
castles and of the royal palace at London; expressed
however his resolution not to allow money to be any
ground of quarrel between him and his sovereign: He
agreed to pay the sum; and immediately gave sureties for
it<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 38.</NOTE>. In the subsequent meeting, the King demanded
five hundred marks, which, he affirmed, he had lent
Becket during the war at Thoulouse<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 47.</NOTE>; and another sum
to the same amount, for which that prince had been surety
for him to a Jew. Immediately after these two claims,
he started a third of still greater importance: He required
him to give in the account of his administration while
chancellor, and to pay the balance due from the revenues
of all the prelacies, abbies, and baronies, which had,
during that time, been subjected to his management<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 494. Diceto, p. 537.</NOTE>.
Becket observed, that as this demand was totally unex∣pected,
he had not come prepared to answer it; but he
required a delay, and promised in that case to give satis∣faction.
The King insisted upon sureties; and Becket
desired leave to consult with his suffragans in a case of
such importance<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is apparent, from the known character of Henry,
and from the usual vigilance of his government, that
when he promoted Becket to the see of Canterbury, he
was, on good grounds, well pleased with his administra∣tion
in the former high office, with which he had en∣trusted
him; and that, even if that prelate had dissipated
money beyond the income of his place, the King was
satisfied that his expences were not blameable, and had
in the main been calculated for his service<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 495.</NOTE>. Two years
had since elapsed; no demands had during that time been
made upon him; it was not till the quarrel arose con∣cerning
ecclesiastical privileges, that the claim was started,
<PB N="428" REF="468"/>
and the primate was, of a sudden, required to produce
accounts of such intricacy and extent before a tribunal,
which had shown a determined resolution to ruin and
oppress him. To find sureties, that he should answer so
boundless and uncertain a claim, which, in the King's estimation, amounted to 44,000 marks<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 315.</NOTE>, was impracti∣cable;
and Becket's suffragans were extremely at a loss
what council to give him, in such a critical emergency.
By the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dvice of the bishop of Winchester he offered two
thousand marks as a general satisfaction for all demands: But this offer was rejected by the King<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. P. 38.</NOTE>. Some prelates
counselled him to resign his see, on condition of recei∣ving
an acquittal: Others were of opinion, that he ought
to submit himself entirely to the King's mercy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 39. Gervase, p. 1390.</NOTE>: But
the primate, thus pushed to the utmost, had too much
courage to sink under oppression: He determined to brave
all his enemies, to trust to the sacredness of his character
for protection, to involve his cause with that of God
and religion, and to stand the utmost efforts of royal in∣dignation.</P>
<P>AFTER a few days, spent in deliberation, Becket
went to church, and said mass, where he had previously
ordered, that the introit to the communion service should
begin with these words, <HI>Princes sat and spake against me;</HI>
the passage appointed for the martyrdom of St. Stephen,
whom the primate thereby tacitly pretended to resemble
in his sufferings for the sake of righteousness<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 53. Hoveden, p. 494. Neubr. p. 394. Ger∣vase, p. 1391.</NOTE>. He went
thence to court arrayed in his sacred vestments; and as
soon as he arrived within the palace gates, he took the
cross into his own hands, bore it aloft as his protection,
<PB N="429" REF="469"/>
and marched in that posture into the royal apartments<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 40. Hist. Quad. p. 53. Hoveden, p. 494. Neubr. p. 394. Epist. St. Thom. p. 43.</NOTE>.
The King, who was in an inner room, was astonished
at this parade, by which the primate seemed to menace
him and his court with the sentence of excommunica∣tion;
and he sent some of the prelates to remonstrate
with him on account of such audacious behaviour.
These prelates complained to him, that, by subscribing,
himself, to the constitutions of Clarendon, he had sedu∣ced
them to imitate his example; and that now, when
it was too late, he pretended to shake off all subordina∣tion
to the civil power, and appeared desirous of invol∣ving
them in the guilt, which must attend any violation
of those laws, established by their consent and ratified
by their subscriptions<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 35.</NOTE>. Becket replied, that he had in∣deed subscribed the constitutions of Clarendon, <HI>legally,
with good faith and without fraud or reserve,</HI> but in these
words was virtually implied a salvo for the rights of their
order, which, being connected with the cause of God
and his church, could never be relinquished by their
oaths and engagements: That if he and they had erred,
in resigning the ecclesiastical privileges, the best atone∣ment
they could now make was to retract their consent,
which in such a case could never be obligatory, and to
follow the Pope's authority, who had solemnly abrogated
the constitutions of Clarendon, and had absolved them
from all oaths, which they had taken to observe them:
That a determined resolution was evidently embraced to
oppress the church; the storm had first broke upon him;
for a slight offence, and which too was even falsly imput∣ed
to him, he had been tyrannically condemned to a
grievous penalty; a new and unheard of claim was since
started, in which he could expect no justice; and he
<PB N="430" REF="470"/>
plainly saw that he was the destined victim, who, by his
ruin, must prepare the way for the abrogation of all
spiritual immunities: That he strictly inhibited them,
who were his suffragans, to assist at any such trial, or
give their sanction to any sentence against him; he put
himself and his see under the protection of the supreme
pontiff; and appealed to him against any penalty, which
his iniquitous judges might think proper to inflict upon
him: And that, however terrible the indignation of so
great a monarch as Henry, his sword could only kill the
body, while that of the church, entrusted into the hands
of the primate, could kill the soul, and throw the dis∣obedient
into infinite and eternal perdition<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 42. 44, 45, 46. Hist. Quad. p. 57. Hoveden, p. 495. M. Paris, p. 72. Epist. St. Thom. p. 45. 195.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>APPEALS to the Pope, even in ecclesiastical causes,
had been abolished by the constitutions of Clarendon,
and were become criminal by law; but an appeal in a civil
cause, such as that of the King's demand upon Becket,
was a practice altogether new and unprecedented; tended
directly to the subversion of the government; and could
receive no colour of excuse, except from the determined
resolution, which was but too apparent, in the King and
the great council, to effectuate, without justice, but un∣der
colour of law, the total ruin of the inflexible pri∣mate.
The King, having now obtained so much a bet∣ter
pretext for his violence, would probably have pushed
this affair to the utmost extremity against him; but
Becket gave him no leisure to conduct that prosecution.
He refused so much as to hear the sentence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Banish∣ment of Becket.</NOTE> which the
barons, sitting apart from the bishops, and joined to some
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heriffs and barons of the second rank<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 46. This historian is supposed to mean the more considerable vassals of the chief barons: These had no title to sit in the great council, and the giving them a place there was a palpable irregu∣larity: Which however is not insisted on in any of Becket's remon∣strances. A new proof how little fixed the constitution was at that time!</NOTE>, had given upon
<PB N="431" REF="471"/>
the King's claim: He departed from the palace; asked
Henry's immediate permission to leave Northampton;
and upon meeting with a refusal, he withdrew secretly;
wandered about in disguise for some time; and at last
took shipping and arrived safely at Gravelines<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 60. 63, 64, &amp;c. Hoveden, p. 495. M. Paris, p. 72. Gervase, p. 1393.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE violent and unjust prosecution of Becket had a
natural tendency to turn the public favour on his side,
and to make men forget his former ingratitude towards
the King, and his departure from all oaths and engage∣ments,
as well as the enormity of those ecclesiastical
privileges, of which he affected to be the champion.
There were many other reasons, which procured him
countenance and protection in foreign countries. Philip,
earl of Flanders<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 35.</NOTE>, and Lewis, King of France<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 36, 37.</NOTE>, jealous
of the rising greatness of Henry, were well pleased to
give him disturbance in his government; and forgetting
that this was the common cause of princes, they affected
to pity extremely the condition of the exiled primate;
and the latter even honoured him with a visit at Soissons,
in which city he had invited him to fix his retreat<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 76.</NOTE>. The
pope, whose interests were more immediately concerned
in supporting him, gave a bad reception to a magnificent
embassy, which Henry sent to accuse him; while he
put the greatest marks of distinction on Becket himself,
who had come to Sens, in order to justify his cause before
the sovereign pontiff<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 51. Hist. Quad. p. 72, 73. 77. Hoveden, p. 496. Gervase, p. 1393. Trivet, p. 46.</NOTE>. The King, in revenge, se∣questered
<PB N="432" REF="472"/>
the revenues of Canterbury; and by a conduct,
which might be esteemed arbitrary, had there been at that
time any regular check on royal authority, he banished
all the primate's relations and domestics, to the number
of four hundred<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 766.</NOTE>, whom he obliged to swear, before their
departure, that they would instantly join their patron<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 51, 52. Hist. Quad. p. 82.</NOTE>.
But this policy, by which Henry endeavoured to reduce
Becket sooner to necessities, lost its effect: The Pope,
as soon as they arrived beyond sea, absolved them from
their oath, and distributed them among the convents in
France and Flanders: A residence was assigned to Becket
himself in the convent of Pontigny<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 72.</NOTE>, where he lived for
some years in great magnificence, partly from a pension
granted him on the revenues of that abbey, partly from
remittances made him by the French monarch.</P>
<P>THE more to ingratiate himself with Pope Alexander,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1165.</NOTE>
Becket resigned into his hands the see of Canterbury, to
which, he affirmed, he had been uncanonically elected,
by the authority of the royal mandate<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 52. Hist. Quad. p. 79.</NOTE>; and Alexander
in his turn, besides investing him anew with that digni∣ty,
pretended to abrogate by a bull the sentence which
the great council of England had passed against him.
Henry, after attempting in vain to procure a conference
with the Pope, who departed soon after for Rome, whi∣ther
the prosperous condition of his affairs now invited
him; made provisions against the consequences of that
breach, which impended between his kingdom and the
apostolic see. He issued orders to his justiciaries, inhi∣biting,
under severe penalties, all appeals to the Pope
or archbishop; forbidding any one to receive any man∣dates
<PB N="433" REF="473"/>
from them, or apply in any case to their autho∣rity;
declaring it treasonable to bring from either of
them an interdict upon the kingdom, and punishable, in
secular clergymen, by the loss of their eyes and by castra∣tion,
in regulars by amputation of their feet, and in
laics with death; and menacing with sequestration and
banishment the persons themselves, as well as their
kindred, who should pay obedience to any such inter∣dict:
And he farther obliged all his subjects to swear to
the observance of these orders<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 88. 167. Hoveden, p. 496. M. Paris, p. 73.</NOTE>. These were edicts of
the utmost importance, affected the lives and properties
of all the subjects, and even changed, for the time, the
national religion, by breaking off all communication
with Rome: Yet were they enacted by the sole autho∣rity
of the King, and were derived entirely from his
will and pleasure.</P>
<P>THE spiritual powers, which, in the primitive church,
were, in a great measure, dependant on the civil, had
by a gradual progress reached an equality and inde∣pendance;
and tho' the limits of the two jurisdictions
were difficult to ascertain or define, it was not impossible,
but, by moderation on both sides, government might
still have been conducted, in that imperfect and irregular
manner which attends all human institutions. But as the
ignorance of the age encouraged the ecclesiastics daily
to extend their privileges, and even to advance maxims
totally incompatible with civil government<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Quis dubitet,</HI> says Becket to the King, <HI>sacerdotes Christi regum et prin∣cipum omniumque fidelium patres et magistros censeri.</HI> Epist. St. Thom. p. 97. 148.</NOTE>; Henry had
thought it high time to put an end to their pretensions,
and formally, in a public council, to fix those powers,
which belonged to the magistrate, and which he was
for the future determined to maintain. In this attempt,
<PB N="434" REF="474"/>
he was led to recall customs, which, tho' antient<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 34. Hoveden, p. 518. Epist. St. Thom. p. 265.</NOTE>, were
beginning to be abolished by a contrary practice, and
which were still more strongly opposed by the prevailing
opinions and sentiments of the age. Principle, therefore,
stood on the one side; power on the other; and if the
English had been actuated by conscience, more than by
present interest, the controversy must soon, by the gene∣ral
defection of Henry's subjects, have been decided
against him. Becket, in order to forward this event,
filled all places with exclamations against the violence
which he had suffered<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 53. Epist. St. Thom. p. 63, 64. 226.</NOTE>. He compared himself to Christ,
who had been condemned by a lay tribunal<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 63. 105. 194.</NOTE>, and who
was crucified anew in the present oppressions under
which his church laboured: He took it for granted, as
a point incontestible, that his cause was the cause of
God<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 29, 30, 31. 226.</NOTE>: He assumed the character of champion for the
patrimony of the Divinity: He pretended to be the spi∣ritual
father of the King and all the people of England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 46. Epist. St. Thom. p. 52. 148.</NOTE>:.
He even told Henry, that kings reign solely by the autho∣rity
of the church<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Brady's Append. No 56. Epist. St. Thom. p. 94, 95. 97. 99. 197. Hoveden, p. 497.</NOTE>; and tho' he had thus torne off the
veil more openly on the one side, than that prince had
on the other, he seemed still, from the general favour
borne him by the ecclesiastics, to have all the advantages
in the argument<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 268. 611.</NOTE>. The King, that he might employ
the weapons of temporal power remaining in his hands,
suspended the payment of Peter's-pence<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 219.</NOTE>; he made ad∣vances
towards an alliance with the Emperor, Frederic
<PB N="435" REF="475"/>
Barbarossa, who was at that time engaged in violent
wars with Pope Alexander<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 88. Epist. St. Thom. p. 116. 139.</NOTE>; he discovered some inten∣tions
of acknowledging Pascal III. the present anti-pope,
who was protected by that Emperor<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 106. 111, 112. M. Paris, p. 75. M. West. p. 249.</NOTE>; and by these ex∣pedients
he endeavoured to terrify the enterprising, tho'
prudent pontiff, from proceeding to extremities against
him.</P>
<P>BUT the violence of Becket,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1166.</NOTE> still more than the nature
of the controversy, kept affairs from remaining long in
suspense between the parties. That prelate, instigated
by revenge, and animated by the present glory attending
his situation, pushed matters to a decision, and issued out
a censure, excommunicating the King's chief ministers
by name, and comprehending in general all those who
favoured or obeyed the constitutions of Clarendon<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. M. West. p. 249. Epist. St. Thom. p. 148, 149. 235. 240.</NOTE>:
These constitutions he abrogated and annulled; he ab∣solved
every one from the oaths which they had taken
to observe them; and he suspended the spiritual thunder
over Henry himself, only that the prince might avoid the
blow by a timely repentance<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 56. Hist. Quad. p. 93. M. Paris, p. 74. Beau∣lieu Vie de St. Thom. p. 213. Epist. St. Thom. p. 149. 229. Hove∣den, p. 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE situation of Henry was so unhappy, that he could
employ no expedient for saving his ministers from this
terrible censure, but by appealing to the Pope himself,
and having recourse to a tribunal, whose authority he had
himself attempted to abridge in this very article of ap∣peals,
and which, he knew, was so deeply engaged on
<PB N="436" REF="476"/>
the side of his adversary<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 166. 202, 203. 234.</NOTE>. But even this expedient was
not likely to be long effectual. Becket had obtained
from the Pope a legatine commission over England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 55. Epist. St. Thom. p. 179.</NOTE>;
and in virtue of that authority, which admitted of no
appeal<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 218.</NOTE>, he summoned the bishops of London, Salisbury,
and others, to attend him, and ordered, under pain of
excommunication, the ecclesiastics, sequestered on his
account, to be restored in two months to all their bene∣fices<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 182, 183. 218, 219. 239.</NOTE>. But John de Oxford, the King's agent at
Rome, had the address to procure orders for suspending
this sentence<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 403, 404. 428.</NOTE>; and he gave the pontiff such hopes of a
speedy reconcilement between the King and Becket, that
two legates, William de Pavie and Otho, were sent to
Normandy, where the King then resided, and endea∣voured
to find expedients for that purpose<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 309.</NOTE> But the
pretensions of the parties were, as yet, too opposite to
admit of an accommodation: The King required, that
all the constitutions of Clarendon should be ratified<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 517. Epist. St. Thom. p. 345.</NOTE>:
Becket, that, previously to any agreement, he and his
adherents should be restored to their possessions<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 74. Epist. St. Thom. p. 346. 349. 355.</NOTE>: And as
the legates had no power to pronounce a definitive sen∣tence
on either side, the negotiation soon after came to
nothing<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Gervase, p. 1403.</NOTE>. The cardinal de Pavie also, being much at∣tached
to Henry's interests, took care to protract the ne∣gotiation;
to mitigate the Pope, by the accounts which
he sent of that prince's conduct; and to procure him
every possible indulgence from the see of Rome. It was
<PB N="437" REF="477"/>
by his credit, that the King obtained about this time a
dispensation for the marriage of his third son, Geoffrey,
with the heiress of Britanny; a concession, which, con∣sidering
Henry's demerits towards the church, gave great
scandal both to Becket, and to his patron, the King of
France.</P>
<P>THE intricacies of the feudal law had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1167.</NOTE> in that age,
rendered the boundaries of power between the prince
and his vassals, and between one prince and another, as
precarious as those between the crown and the mitre;
and all wars took their origin from disputes, which, had
there been any tribunal possessed of power to enforce
their decrees, ought only to have been decided before a
court of judicature. Henry, in prosecution of some con∣troversies,
in which he was involved with the count of
Auvergne, a vassal of the dutchy of Guienne, had in∣vaded
the territories of that count; who had recourse to
the King of France, his superior lord, for protection,
and thereby kindled a war between the two monarchs.
But this war was, as usual, no less feeble in its opera∣tions,
than it was frivolous in its cause and object; and
after occasioning some depredations on each others terri∣tories<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 517. M. Paris, p. 75. Diceto, p. 547. Gervase, p. 1402, 1403. Robert de Monte.</NOTE>, and some insurrections among the barons of
Poictou and Guienne, was terminated by a peace; the
terms of which were rather disadvantageous to Henry,
and prove, that that prince had, by reason of his contests
with the church, lost the superiority, which he had
hitherto maintained over the crown of France: An addi∣tional
motive to him for accommodating those differ∣ences.</P>
<P>THE Pope and the King began to perceive, that, in
the present situation of affairs, neither of them could
<PB N="438" REF="478"/>
expect a final and decisive victory over the other, and
that they had more to fear than hope from the duration
of the controversy. Tho' the vigour of Henry's govern∣ment
had confirmed his authority in all his dominions,
his throne might be shaken by a sentence of excommuni∣cation;
and if England itself could, by its situation, be
more easily guarded against the contagion of superstitious
prejudices, his French provinces at least, whose commu∣nication
was open with the neighbouring states, would
be much exposed, on that account, to some great revo∣lution
or convulsion<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 230.</NOTE>. He could not, therefore, rea∣sonably
imagine, that the Pope, while he retained such
a check upon him, would formally recognize the consti∣tutions
of Clarendon, which both put an end to papal
pretensions in England, and would give an example to
other states of asserting a like independancy<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 276.</NOTE>. Pope
Alexander, on the other hand, being still engaged in
dangerous wars with the Emperor Frederic, might justly
apprehend, that Henry, rather than relinquish claims of
such importance, would join the party of his enemy<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 53. Hist. Quad. p. 75.</NOTE>;
and as the trials hitherto made of the spiritual weapons
by Becket had not succeeded to his expectation<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 241. 254.</NOTE>, and
every thing had remained quiet in all the King's domi∣nions,
nothing seemed impossible to the capacity and vi∣gilance
of so great a monarch. The disposition of minds
on both sides, resulting from these circumstances, pro∣duced
frequent attempts towards an accommodation; but
as both parties knew, that the essential articles of the
dispute could not then be terminated, they entertained
a perpetual jealousy of each other, and were anxious not
to lose the least advantage in the negotiation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 85.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="439" REF="479"/>
nuncios, Gratian and Vivian, having received a commis∣sion
to endeavour a reconcilement, met with the King
at Damfront in Normandy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 78.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1168</NOTE> and after all differences
seemed to be adjusted, the King offered to sign the treaty,
with a salvo to his royal dignity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 29. Gervase, p. 1407.</NOTE>; which gave such um∣brage
to Becket, that the negotiation, in the end, be∣came
fruitless, and the excommunications were renewed
against the King's ministers. Another negotiation was
conducted at Montmirail, in the presence of the King
of France and the French prelates; where Becket, imi∣tating
Henry's example, offered to make his submissions,
with a salvo of the honour of God, and the liberties of
the church<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 58. Hist. Quad. p. 95. Diceto, p. 552. Ger∣vase, p. 1405.</NOTE>; which, for a like reason, was extremely
offensive to the King, and rendered the treaty abortive.
A third conference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1169</NOTE> under the same mediation, was
broke off, by Becket's insisting on the like reserve in his
submissions; and even in a fourth treaty, when all the
terms were adjusted, and when the primate expected to
be introduced to the King, and to receive the kiss of
peace, which it was usual for princes to grant in those
times, and which was regarded as a sure pledge of for∣giveness,
Henry refused him that honour<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 102. M. Paris, p. 82. Gervase, p. 1408.</NOTE>; upon pre∣tence,
that, during his anger, he had made a rash vow
never to give the prelate such a testimony of friendship.
This formality served, among such jealous spirits, to
prevent the conclusion of the treaty; and tho' the dif∣ficulty
was attempted to be overcome, by a dispensation
which the Pope granted Henry from his rash vow<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 68.</NOTE>,
that prince could not be prevailed on to depart from the
resolution which he had taken.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="480"/>
IN one of these conferences, at which the French
King was present, Henry said to that monarch, “There
have been many Kings of England, some of greater,
some of less authority than myself: There have also
been many archbishops of Canterbury, holy and good
men, and entitled to every kind of respect: Let
Becket but act towards me with the same submission,
which the greatest of his predecessors have paid to the
least of mine, and there shall be no controversy be∣tween
us<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 95. Gervase, p. 1405.</NOTE>.” Lewis was so struck with this state of
the case, and with an offer which Henry made to submit
his cause to the French clergy, that he could not forbear
condemning the primate, and withdrawing his friendship
from him during some time: But their common animo∣sity
against Henry soon produced a renewal of their for∣mer
good correspondence<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 99, 100. Gervase, p. 1406. Parker, p. 206.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL difficulties were at last adjusted between the par∣ties;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1170.</NOTE>
and the King allowed Becket to return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22nd July.</NOTE> on condi∣tions
which may be esteemed both honourable and advan∣tageous
to that prelate. He was not required to give up
any of the rights of the church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compro∣mise with Becket.</NOTE> or resign any of those
pretensions, which had been the original ground of the
controversy. It was agreed, that all these questions
should be buried in oblivion; but that Becket and his
adherents should, without making further submissions, be
restored to all their livings<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Gervase, p. 1413.</NOTE>, and that even the posses∣sors
of such benefices as depended on the see of Canter∣bury,
and had been filled during the primate's absence,
should be expelled, and Becket have liberty to supply the
vacancies<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 68, 69. Hoveden, p. 520.</NOTE>. In return for concessions, which entrenched
<PB N="441" REF="481"/>
so deeply on the honour and dignity of the crown,
Henry reaped only the advantage of seeing his ministers
absolved from the sentence of excommunication de∣nounced
against them, and so preventing the interdict,
which, if these hard conditions had not been complied
with, was ready to be laid on all his dominions<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 104. Brompton, p. 1062. Gervase, p. 1408. Epist. St. Thom. p. 704, 705, 706, 707. 792, 793, 794. Benedict. Abbas, p. 70.</NOTE>. It
was easy to see how much he dreaded that event, when a
prince of so high a spirit could submit to terms so disho∣nourable,
in order to prevent it.</P>
<P>BUT the King attained not even that temporary tran∣quillity,
which he had hoped to reap from this expedient.
During the heat of his quarrel with Becket, while he
was every day expecting an interdict to be laid on his
kingdom, and even a sentence of excommunication to
be denounced against his person, he had thought it pru∣dent
to have his son, prince Henry, associated with him
in the royalty, and to make him be crowned King, by
the hands of Roger archbishop of York<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 102, 103. Gervase, p. 1408.</NOTE>. By this
precaution, he both ensured the succession of that prince,
which, considering the many past irregularities in that
point, could not but be esteemed somewhat precarious;
and he preserved at least his family on the throne, if the
sentence of excommunication should have the effect
which he dreaded, and should make his subjects renounce
their allegiance to him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 65. Pere Daniel, vol. i. p. 1247.</NOTE>. Tho' this design was con∣ducted
with the utmost expedition and secrecy, Becket,
before it was carried into execution, had got intelligence
of it; and being desirous to obstruct all Henry's mea∣sures,
as well as anxious to prevent this affront to him∣self,
who pretended a sole right, as archbishop of Can∣terbury,
<PB N="442" REF="482"/>
to officiate in the coronation, he had inhibited
all the prelates of England from assisting at this cere∣mony<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 684. 686.</NOTE>, had procured a mandate to the same purpose
from the Pope<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 103. Epist. St. Thomp. p. 682. Gervase, p. 1412.</NOTE>, and had incited the King of France to
protest against the coronation of young Henry, unless
the princess, daughter of that monarch, should at the same
time receive the royal unction. There prevailed in that
age an opinion, which was akin to its other superstitions,
that the royal unction was essential to the exercise of royal
power<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 708.</NOTE>; and it was therefore natural both for the King
of France, careful of his daughter the princess Mar∣garet's
establishment<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1061.</NOTE>, and for Becket, jealous of his
own dignity, to demand, in the treaty with Henry, some
satisfaction in this essential point<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Gervase, p. 1408.</NOTE>. Henry, after apolo∣gizing
to Lewis for the omission with regard to Marga∣ret,
and excusing it on account of the secrecy requisite
for conducting that measure, promised that the ceremony
should be again renewed in the persons both of the prince
and princess<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 518.</NOTE>: And he assured Becket, that, besides re∣ceiving
the acknowledgments of Roger and the other
bishops for the seeming affront put on the see of Canter∣bury,
he should, as a farther satisfaction, recover his
rights by officiating in this coronation<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 803, 810.</NOTE>. But the violent
spirit of Becket, elated by the power of the church, and
by the victory which he had already obtained over his so∣vereign,
was not content with this voluntary compensa∣tion,
but resolved to make the injury, which he pretended
to have suffered, a handle for taking revenge of all his
enemies. On his arrival in England, he met the arch∣bishop
of York and the bishops of London and Salisbury,
<PB N="443" REF="483"/>
who were on their journey to the King in Normandy;
and he notified to the archbishop the sentence of suspen∣sion,
and to the two bishops that of excommunication,
which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Becket's return from banish∣ment.</NOTE> at his solicitation, the Pope had pronounced
against them<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 86. Chron. W. Heming. p. 497. Diceto, p. 553. Brompton, p. 1062. Gervase, p. 1413. M. West. p. 250. Epist. St. Thom. p. 816. 849.</NOTE>. Reginald de Warenne, and Gervase de Cornhill, two itinerant justiciaries, who were making
their circuit in Kent, asked him, on hearing, of this bold
attempt, whether he meant to bring fire and sword into
the kingdom<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 73. Hist. Quad. p. 112. Beaulieu Vie de St. Thom. p. 395.</NOTE>? But the primate, heedless of the reproof,
proceeded, in the most ostentatious manner, to take pos∣session
of his diocese. In Rochester, and all the towns
thro' which he passed, he was received with the shouts
and acclamations of the people<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 113. Beaulieu Vie de St. Thom. p. 397 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Epist. St. Thom. p. 132.</NOTE>. As he approached
Southwark, the clergy, the laity, men of all ranks and
ages, came forth to meet him, and celebrated with
hymns of joy his triumphant entrance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 75. Hist. Quad. p. 117.</NOTE>. And tho' he
was obliged, by orders of the young prince, who resided
at Woodstoke, to return to his diocese, he found that
he was not mistaken, when he laid his account with the
highest veneration of the public towards his person and
his dignity. He proceeded, therefore, with the more
courage to launch his spiritual thunders; and he issued
the sentence of excommunication against Robert de
Broc<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 520. Diceto, p. 555.</NOTE>, and Nigel de Sackville, with many of the most
considerable prelates and ministers, who had assisted at
the coronation of the young prince, and had been active
in the late persecution of the exiled clergy. This vio∣lent
<PB N="444" REF="484"/>
measure, by which he, in effect, denounced war
against the King himself, is commonly ascribed to the
vindictive disposition and imperious character of Becket;
but as this prelate was also a man of acknowledge
abilities, we are not, in his passions alone, to look for
the cause of his conduct, when he proceeded to these ex∣tremities
against his enemies. His sagacity had led him
to discover all Henry's intentions; and he purposed, by
this bold and unexpected assault, to prevent the execu∣tion
of them.</P>
<P>THE King, from his experience of the dispositions of
his people, was become sensible, that his enterprize had
been too bold, in establishing the constitutions of Claren∣don,
in defining all the branches of royal power, and in
endeavouring to extort from the church of England, as
well as from the Pope, an express avowal of these dis∣puted
prerogatives. Conscious also of his own vio∣lence,
in attempting to break or subdue the inflexible
primate, he was not displeased to undo that measure,
which had given his enemies such advantage against him;
and he was contented, that the controversy should ter∣minate
in that ambiguous manner, which was the utmost
that princes, in those ages, could hope to attain in their
disputes with the see of Rome. Tho' he dropt, for the
present, the prosecution of Becket, he still reserved to
himself the right of maintaining, that the constitutions
of Clarendon, the original ground of the quarrel, were
both the antient customs and the present law of the
realm: And tho' he knew, that the papal clergy as∣serted
them to be impious in themselves, as well as abro∣gated
by the sentence of the sovereign pontiff, he propos∣ed,
in spite of their clamours, steadily to put these laws
in execution<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 837. 839.</NOTE>, and to trust to his own ability, and to
the course of events, for success in that perilous enter∣prize.
<PB N="445" REF="485"/>
He hoped, that Becket's experience of a six
years exile would, after his pride was fully gratified by
his restoration, be sufficient to teach him more reserve in
his opposition; or if any controversy arose, he expected
thenceforth to engage in a more favourable cause, and
to maintain with advantage, while the primate was now
in his power<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 65.</NOTE>, the antient and undoubted customs of
the kingdom against the usurpations of the clergy. But
Becket, determined not to betray the ecclesiastical privi∣leges
by his connivance<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 345.</NOTE>, and apprehensive lest a prince
of such profound policy, if allowed to proceed in his
own way, would probably in the end prevail, resolved to
take all the advantage which his present victory gave
him, and to disconcert the cautious measures of the
King, by the vehemence and rigour of his own con∣duct<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 74.</NOTE>. Assured of support from Rome, he was little
apprehensive of dangers, which his courage taught him
to despise, and which, even if attended with the most
fatal consequences, would serve only to gratify his am∣bition
and thirst of glory<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 818. 848.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the suspended and excommunicated prelates
arrived at Baieux, where the King then resided, and
complained to him of the violent proceedings of Becket<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 115. Brompton, p. 1062. Gervase, p. 1414.</NOTE>, he instantly perceived the consequences; was sensible,
that his whole plan of operations was overthrown; fore∣saw,
that the dangerous contest between the civil and
spiritual powers, a contest which he himself had first
rouzed, but which he had endeavoured, by all his late
negotiations and concessions, to appease, must come to
an immediate and decisive issue; and he was thence
thrown into the most violent commotion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 119. Neubr. p. 401. Trivet, p. 52.</NOTE>. The arch∣bishop
of York remarked to him, that, so long as Becket
<PB N="446" REF="486"/>
lived, he could never expect to enjoy peace or tranquil∣lity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 78.</NOTE>;
and the King himself, being vehemently agitated,
burst forth into an exclamation against his servants,
whose want of zeal, he said, had so long left him ex∣posed
to the enterprizes of that ungrateful and imperi∣ous
prelate<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gervase, p. 1414. Parker, p. 207.</NOTE>. Four gentlemen of his household, Re∣ginald
Fitz-Urse, William de Traci, Hugh de More∣ville,
and Richard Brito, taking these passionate expres∣sions
to be a hint for Becket's death, immediately com∣municated
their thoughts to each other; and swearing
to avenge their prince's quarrel, secretly withdrew from
court<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 86. Brompton, p. 1063. Benedict. Abbas, p. 10.</NOTE>. Some menacing expressions, which they had
dropt, gave a suspicion of their design; and the King
dispatched a messenger after them, charging them to at∣tempt
nothing against the person of the primate<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 144. Trivet, p. 55.</NOTE>: But
these orders arrived too late to prevent their fatal pur∣pose.
The four assassins, tho' they took different roads
to England, arrived nearly about the same time at Salt∣woode
near Canterbury<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 78, 79. Hist. Quad. p. 120.</NOTE>; and being there joined by
some assistants, they proceeded in great haste to the ar∣chi-episcopal
palace<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gervase, p. 1414.</NOTE>. They found the primate, who
trusted entirely to the sacredness of his character, very
slenderly attended; and tho' they threw out many me∣naces
and reproaches against him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 401. Diceto, p. 555.</NOTE>, he was so incapable of
fear, that, without using any precautions against their
violence, he immediately went to St. Benedict's church,
to hear vespers. They followed him thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th Decr. Murder of Thomas a Becket.</NOTE> attacked
him before the altar, and having cloven his head with
many blows, retired without meeting any opposition<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 520.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="487"/>
This was the tragical end of Thomas a Becket, a pre∣late
of the most lofty, intrepid, and inflexible spirit,
who was able to cover, to the world and probably to
himself, the enterprizes of pride and ambition, under
the disguise of sanctity and of zeal for the interests of
piety and religion: An extraordinary personage, surely,
had he been allowed to remain in his first station, and
had directed the vehemence of his character to the sup∣port
of law and justice; instead of being engaged, by
the prejudices of the times, to sacrifice all private duties
and public connexions to tyes, which he imagined, or
represented, as superior to every civil and political con∣sideration.
But no man, who enters into the genius of
that age, can reasonably doubt of this prelate's sincerity.
The spirit of superstition was so prevalent, that it in∣fallibly
caught every careless reasoner, much more every
one whose interest, and honour, and ambition, were en∣gaged
to support it. All the wretched literature of the
times was inlisted on that side: Some faint glimmerings
of common sense might sometimes pierce thro' the thick
cloud of ignorance, or what was worse, the illusions of
perverted science, which had blotted out the sun, and
envelloped the face of nature: But those who preserved
themselves untainted from the general contagion, pro∣ceeded
on no principles which they could pretend to
justify: They were beholden more to their total want
of instruction, than to their knowledge, if they still re∣tained
some share of understanding: Folly was possessed
of all the schools as well as all the churches; and her
votaries assumed the garb of philosophers together with
the ensigns of spiritual dignities. Throughout that large
collection of letters, which bears the name of St. Tho∣mas,
we find, in all the retainers of that aspiring pre∣late,
no less than in himself, a most entire and absolute
conviction of the reason and piety of their own party,
<PB N="448" REF="488"/>
and a disdain of their antagonists; nor is there less cant
and grimace in their stile, when they address each other,
than when they compose manifestos for the perusal of the
public. The spirit of revenge, violence, and ambition,
which accompanied their conduct, instead of forming a
presumption of hypocrisy, are the surest pledges of their
sincere attachment to a cause, which so much ftattered
these domineering passions.</P>
<P>HENRY, on the first report of Becket's violent mea∣sures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grief</NOTE>
had proposed to have him arrested, and had al∣ready
taken some steps towards the execution of that
design: But the intelligence of his murder threw that
prince into the utmost consternation, and he was imme∣diately
sensible of the dangerous con∣equences,
which he had reason to apprehend from so unexpected an event.
An archbishop of reputed sanctity, assassinated before the
altar, in the exercise of his function, and on account of
his zeal in maintaining ecclesiastical privileges, must at∣tain
the highest honours of martyrdom; while his mur∣derer
would be ranked among the most bloody tyrants,
that ever were exposed to the hatred and detestation of
mankind. Interdicts and excommunications, weapons
in themselves so terrible, would, he foresaw, be armed
with double force; when employed in a cause so much
calculated to work on the human passions, and so pecu∣liarly
adapted to the eloquence of popular preachers and
declaimers. In vain would he plead his own innocence,
and even his total ignorance of the fact: He was suffi∣ciently
guilty, if the church thought proper to esteem
him so: And his concurrence in Becket's martyrdom,
becoming a religious opinion, would be received with all
the implicit credit, which belonged to the most esta∣blished
articles of faith. These considerations gave the
King the most unaffected concern; and as it was ex∣tremely
his interest to clear himself of all suspicion, he
<PB N="449" REF="489"/>
took no care to conceal the depth of his affliction<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 447. M. Paris, p. 87. Diceto, p. 556. Ger∣vase, p. 1419.</NOTE>.
He shut himself up from the light of day and from all
commerce with his servants: He even refused during
three days all food and sustenance<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hist. Quad. p. 143.</NOTE>: The courtiers, ap∣prehending
dangerous effects from his despair, were at
last obliged to break in upon his solitude; and they em∣ployed
every topic of consolation, induced him to ac∣cept
of nourishment, and occupied his leisure in taking
precautions against the consequences, which he so justly
apprehended from the murder of the primate.</P>
<P>THE point of chief importance to Henry was to con∣vince
the Pope of his innocence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1171.</NOTE> or rather to persuade
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and submis∣sion of the King.</NOTE> that he would reap greater advantages from the
submissions of England than from proceeding to extre∣mities
against that kingdom. The archbishop of Roüen,
the bishops of Worcester and Evreux, with five others
of less quality, were immediately dispatched to Rome<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 526. M, Paris, p. 87.</NOTE>,
and orders were given them to perform their journey
with the utmost expedition. Tho' the name and au∣thority
of the court of Rome were so terrible in the re∣mote
countries of Europe, which were sunk in profound
ignorance, and were entirely unacquainted with its cha∣racter
and conduct; the Pope was so little revered at
home, that his inveterate enemies surrounded the gates
of Rome itself, and even controuled his government in
that city; and the ambassadors, who, from a distant
extremity of Europe, carried to him the humble, or ra∣ther
abject submissions of the greatest potentate of the
age, found the utmost difficulty to make their way to
him, and to throw themselves at his feet. It was at last
agreed, that Richard Barre, one of their number, should
leave the rest behind, and run all the hazards of the
<PB N="450" REF="490"/>
passaged<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 526. Epist. St. Thom. p. 863.</NOTE>, in order to prevent the fatal consequences
which might ensue from any delay in giving satisfaction
to his Holiness. He found on his arrival, that Alex∣ander
was already wrought up to the greatest rage against
the King, that Becket's partizans were daily stimulat∣ing
him to revenge, that the King of France had ex∣horted
him to fulminate the most dreadful sentence against
England<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 52<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Spel. Concil. vol. ii p. 89. Brompton, p. 1065. Epist. St. Thom. p. 855. Benedictus Abbas. p. 13.</NOTE>, and that the very mention of Henry's name
before the sacred college was received with every ex∣pression
of horror and execration<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 526. Neubr. p. 402. Epist. St. Thom. p. 864.</NOTE>. The Thursday be∣fore
Easter was now approaching, when it is customary
for the Pope to denounce annual curses against all his
enemies; and it was expected, that Henry should, with
all the preparations peculiar to the discharge of that sa∣cred
artillery, be solemnly comprehended in the number<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 527. Diceto, p. 556. Epist. St. Thom. p. 864.</NOTE>.
But Barre found means to appease the pontiff, and to
deter him from a measure, which, if it failed of success,
could not afterwards be easily recalled: The anathemas
were only levelled in general against all the actors, ac∣complices,
and abettors of Becket's murder<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gervase, p. 1419.</NOTE>; and the
abbot of Valasse, and the archdeacons of Salisbury and Lisieux,
with others of Henry's ministers, who soon af∣ter
arrived, besides maintaining their prince's inno∣cence,
made oath before the whole consistory, that he
would stand to the Pope's judgment in the affair, and
make every submission, that should be required of him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 557. Gervase, p. 1419. Epist. St. Thom. p. 865. 867.</NOTE>.
The terrible blow was thus artfully eluded; the cardi∣nals
Albert and Theodin were appointed legates to ex∣amine
the cause, and were ordered to proceed to Nor∣mandy
<PB N="451" REF="491"/>
for that purpose<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 526. Neubr. p. 402. Gervase, p. 1419. Hist. Quad. p. 147.</NOTE>; and tho' Henry's foreign do∣minions
were already laid under an interdict by the arch∣bishop
of Sens, Becket's great partizan<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 523. Spelm. Concil. vol. ii. p. 90.</NOTE>, and the
Pope's legate in France, the expectation, that the mo∣narch
would easily exculpate himself from any concur∣rence
in the guilt, kept every one in suspence, and pre∣vented
all the bad consequences, which might be dread∣ed
from that sentence.</P>
<P>THE clergy, mean while, tho' their rage was hap∣pily
diverted from falling on the King, were not idle in
magnifying the sanctity of Becket; in extolling the me∣rits
of his martyrdom; and in magnifying him above all
that devoted tribe, who, in several ages, had, by their
blood, cemented the fabric of the temple. Other saints
had only borne testimony in their sufferings to the ge∣neral
doctrines of Christianity; but Becket had sacri∣ficed
his life to the power and privileges of the clergy;
and this peculiar merit challenged, and not in vain, a
suitable acknowledgment to his memory. Endless were
the panegyrics on his virtues; and the miracles, ope∣rated
by his relicts, were more numerous, more nonsen∣sical,
and more impudently attested, than those which
ever filled the legend of any confessor or martyr. Two
years after his death he was canonized by Pope Alex∣ander<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Epist. St. Thom. p. 880. Diceto, p. 569.</NOTE>; a solemn jubilee was established for celebrating
his merits; his body was removed to a magnificent
shrine, enriched with presents from all parts of Chris∣tendom;
pilgrimages were performed to obtain his in∣tercession
with heaven; and it was computed, that, in
one year, above an hundred thousand pilgrims arrived in
Canterbury, and paid their devotions at his tomb. It
<PB N="452" REF="492"/>
is indeed a mortifying reflection to those who are actu∣ated
by the love of fame, so justly denominated the last
infirmity of noble minds, that the wisest legislator and
most exalted genius, that ever reformed or enlightened
the world, can never expect such tributes of praise, as
are lavished on the memory of a pretended saint, whose
whole conduct was probably, to the last degree, odious
or contemptible, and whose industry was entirely direct∣ed
to the pursuits of objects pernicious to mankind. It
is only a conqueror, a personage no less intitled to our
hatred, who can pretend to the attainment of equal re∣nown
and glory.</P>
<P>IT may not be amiss to remark, before we conclude
this subject of Thomas a Becket, that the King, during
his controversy with that prelate, was on every occasion
more anxious than usual to express his zeal for religion,
and to avoid all appearance of a profane negligence on
that head. He gave his consent to the imposing a tax
on all his dominions for the delivery of the holy land,
now threatened by the famous Saladine; and this tax
amounted to two-pence a pound for one year, and a
penny a pound for the four subsequent<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Gervase, p. 1399. M. Paris, p. 74.</NOTE>. Almost all
the princes of Europe laid a like imposition on their sub∣jects,
which received the name of Saladine's tax. Dur∣ing
this period, there came over from Germany about
thirty heretics of both sexes, under the direction of
one Gerard; simple ignorant people, who could give no
account of their faith, but declared themselves ready to
suffer for the tenets of their master. They made only
one convert in England, a woman as ignorant as them∣selves;
yet they gave such umbrage to the clergy, that
they were delivered over to the secular arm, and were
punished by being burned on the forehead, and then
whipped thro' the streets. They seemed to exult in
<PB N="453" REF="493"/>
their sufferings, and as they went along, sung the bea∣titude,
<HI>Blessed are ye, when men hate you and persecute you</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 391. M. Paris, p. 74. Heming. p. 494.</NOTE>.
After they were whipped, they were thrust out almost
naked in the midst of winter, and perished thro' cold
and hunger; no one daring, or being willing, to give
them the least relief. We are ignorant of the particu∣lar
principles of these people: For it would be imprudent
to rely on the representations left of them by the clergy,
who affirm, that they denied the efficacy of the sacra∣ments,
and the unity of the church. It is probable,
that their departure from the standard of orthodoxy was
still more subtile and minute. They seem to have been
the first that ever suffered for heresy in England.</P>
<P>AS soon as Henry found, that he was in no immedi∣ate
danger from the thunders of the vatican, he under∣took
an expedition against Ireland; a design, which he
had long projected, and by which he hoped to recover
his credit, somewhat impaired in his late transactions
with the hierarchy.</P>

<P>AS Britain was first peopled from Gaul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX.</NOTE> so was Ire∣land
probably from Britain; and the inhabitants
of all these countries seem to have been so many tribes
of the Celtae,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1172.</NOTE> who derive their origin from an antiquity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Ireland.</NOTE>
that lies far beyond the records of any history or tradi∣tion.
The Irish, from the beginning of time, had been
buried in the most profound barbarism and ignorance;
and as they were never conquered or even invaded by
the Romans, from whom all the western world derived
its civility, they continued still in the most rude state of
society, and were distinguished only by those vices, to
which human nature, not tamed by education nor re∣strained
by laws, is for ever subject. The small princi∣palities,
<PB N="455" REF="495"/>
into which they were divided, exercised perpe∣tual
rapine and violence against each other; the uncer∣tain
succession of their princes was a continued source
of domestic convulsions; the usual title of each petty
sovereign was the murder of his predecessor; courage
and force, tho' exercised in the commission of crimes,
were more honoured than any pacific virtues; and the
most simple arts of life, even tillage and agriculture,
were almost wholly unknown among them. They had
felt the invasions of the Danes and the other northern
people; but these inroads, which had spread barbarism
in the other parts of Europe, tended rather to improve
the Irish; and the only towns, which were to be found
in the island, had been planted along the coast by the
freebooters of Norway and Denmark. The other in∣habitants
exercised pasturage in the open country; sought
protection from any danger in their forests and moras∣ses;
and being divided by the fiercest animosities against
each other, were still more intent on the means of mu∣tual
injury, than on the expedients for common or even
for private interest.</P>
<P>BESIDES many small tribes, there were in the age of
Henry II. five principal sovereignties in the island, Mun∣ster,
Leinster, Meath, Ulster, and Connaught; and as
it had been usual for one or the other of these to take
the lead in their wars, there was commonly some prince,
who seemed, for the time, to act as monarch of Ire∣land.
Roderic O Connor, King of Connaught, was
then advanced to this dignity<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 527.</NOTE>; but his government, ill
obeyed even within his own territory, was not capable
of uniting the people in any measures, either for the
establishment of order, or for defence against foreigners.
The ambition of Henry had, very early in his reign,
been moved, by the prospect of these advantages, to at∣tempt
<PB N="456" REF="496"/>
the subjection of Ireland; and a pretence was only
wanting to invade a people, who, being always confined
to their own island, had never given any reason of com∣plaint
to any of their neighbours. For this purpose, he
had recourse to Rome, which assumed a right to dispose
of kingdoms and empires; and not foreseeing the dan∣gerous
disputes, which he was one day to maintain
with that see, he helped, for present, or rather for an
imaginary convenience, to give sanction to claims which
were now become dangerous to all sovereigns. Adrian
III. who was then pontiff, was by birth an English∣man;
and being, on that account, disposed to oblige
Henry, he was easily persuaded to act as master of the
world, and to make, without any hazard or expence,
the acquisition of a great island to his spiritual jurisdic∣tion.
The Irish had, by precedent missions from the
Britains, been imperfectly converted to Christianity;
and what the Pope regarded as the surest mark of their
imperfect conversion, they followed the doctrines of their
first teachers, and had never acknowledged any subjec∣tion
to the see of Rome. Adrian, therefore, in the year
1156, issued a bull in favour of Henry; in which, after
premising, that that prince had ever shown an anxious
care to enlarge the church of God on earth, and to en∣crease
the number of his saints and elect in heaven; he
represents his design of subduing Ireland as derived from
the same pious motives: He considers his care of ap∣plying
previously for the apostolic sanction as a sure ear∣nest
of success and victory; and having established it as
a point incontestible, that all Christian kingdoms be∣long
to the patrimony of St. Peter, he acknowledges it
to be his own duty to sow among them the seeds of the
gospel, which might in the last day fructify to their
eternal salvation: He exhorts the King to invade Ire∣land,
in order to extirpate the vice and wickedness of
the natives, and oblige them to pay yearly, from every
<PB N="457" REF="497"/>
house, a penny to the see of Rome: He gives him entire
right and authority over the island, commands all the
inhabitants to obey him as their sovereign, and invests
with full power all such godly instruments as he should
think proper to employ in an enterprize, thus calcu∣lated
for the glory of God and the salvation of the souls
of men<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 67. Girald Cambr. Spelm. Concil. vol. ii. p. 51. Rymer, vol. i. p. 15.</NOTE>. Henry, tho' armed with this authority, did
not immediately put his design in execution; but being
detained by more interesting business on the continent,
waited for a favourable opportunity of invading Ireland.</P>
<P>DERMOT Macmorrogh, King of Leinster, had, by
his licentious tyranny, rendered himself extremely odi∣ous
to his subjects, who seized with alacrity, the first
occasion that offered, of throwing off the yoke, which
was become grievous and oppressive to them. This
prince had formed a design on Omach, wife of Ororic,
King of Meath; and taking advantage of her husband's
absence, who, being obliged to visit a distant part of
his dominions, had left his Queen secure, as he thought,
in an island, surrounded by a bog, he suddenly invaded
the place, and carried off the princess<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 760.</NOTE>. This exploit,
tho' usual among the Irish, and rather esteemed a proof
of gallantry and spirit<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Spencer, vol. vi.</NOTE>, provoked the resentment of the
husband; who, having collected forces, and being
strengthened by the alliance of Roderic, King of Con∣naught,
invaded the dominions of Dermot, and expel∣led
him from his kingdom. The exiled prince had re∣course
to Henry, who was at that time in Guienne,
craved his assistance to restore him to his sovereignty,
and offered, in that case, to hold his kingdom in vas∣salage
of the crown of England. Henry, whose views
were already turned towards making acquisitions in Ire∣land,
<PB N="458" REF="498"/>
readily accepted the offer; but being at that time
embarassed by the rebellions of his French subjects, as
well as by his disputes with the see of Rome, he declin∣ed
for the present embarking in the enterprize, and gave
Dermot no farther assistance than letters patent, by
which he empowered all his subjects to aid the Irish
prince in the recovery of his dominions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Girlad Cambr. p. 760.</NOTE>. Dermot, sup∣ported
by this authority, came to Bristol; and after en∣deavouring,
tho' for some time in vain, to engage ad∣venturers
in the enterprize, he at last formed a treaty
with Richard, sirnamed Strongbow, earl of Strigul. This
nobleman, who was of the illustrious house of Clare,
had impaired his estate by expensive pleasures; and being
ready for any desperate undertaking, he promised assist∣ance
to Dermot, on condition of his espousing Eva, the
daughter of that prince, and being declared heir of all
his dominions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 761.</NOTE>. While Richard was assembling his suc∣cours,
Dermot went into Wales; and meeting with
Robert Fitz-Stephens, constable of Abertivi, and Mau∣rice
Fitz-Gerald, he also engaged them in his service,
and obtained their promise of invading Ireland. Being
now assured of assistance, he returned privately to his
own state; and lurking in the monastery of Fernes,
which he had founded, (for this ruffian was also a foun∣der
of monasteries) he prepared every thing for the re∣ception
of his English allies<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 761.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE troops of Fitz-Stephens were first ready. That
gentleman landed in Ireland with an hundred and thirty
knights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conquest of that island.</NOTE> sixty esquires, and three hundred archers; but
this small body, being brave men, not unacquainted
with discipline, and compleatly armed, a thing almost
unknown in Ireland, they struck a great terror into the
barbarous inhabitants, and seemed to menace them with
<PB N="459" REF="499"/>
some great revolution. The conjunction of Maurice de
Prendergast, who, about the same time, brought over
ten knights and sixty archers, enabled Kitz-Stephens to
attempt the siege of Wexford, a town inhabited by the
Danes; and after gaining a battle, he made himself
master of the place<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 761, 762.</NOTE>. Soon after, Fitz-Gerald arrived
with ten knights, thirty esquires, and a hundred archers<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 766.</NOTE>; and being joined by the former adventurers, composed a
force which nothing in Ireland was able to withstand.
Roderic, the chief monarch of the island, was defeated
in battle; the prince of Offory was obliged to submit,
and give hostages for his peaceable behaviour; and Der∣mot,
not content with being restored to his kingdom of
Leinster, projected the dethronement of Roderic, and
aspired to the sole dominion of the island.</P>
<P>IN prosecution of these views, he sent over a messen∣ger
to the earl of Strigul, challenging the performance
of his promise, and displaying the mighty advantages
which might now be reaped by a small reinforcement
of warlike troops from England. Richard, not satisfied
with the general allowance given by Henry to all his
subjects, went to that prince, then in Normandy; and
having obtained a cold or ambiguous permission, pre∣pared
himself for the execution of his designs. He first
sent over Raymond, one of his retinue, with ten knights
and seventy archers, who landing near Waterford, de∣feated
a body of three thousand Irish, that had ventured
to attack him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 767.</NOTE>; and as Richard himself, who brought
over two hundred horse, and an hundred archers, joined
in a few days after, the victorious English, they made
themselves masters of Waterford, and proceeded to
Dublin, which was taken by assault. Roderic, in re∣venge,
cut off the head of Dermot's son, who had been
<PB N="460" REF="500"/>
left as a hostage in his hands; and Richard, marrying
Eva, became soon after, by the death of Dermot, master
of the kingdom of Leinster, and prepared to extend his
dominion over all Ireland. Roderic, and the other Irish
princes, were alarmed with the danger; and combining
together, besieged Dublin with an army of thirty thou∣sand
men: But earl Richard, making a sudden sally at
the head of ninety knights, with their followers, put
this numerous army to rout, chaced them from the field
of battle, and pursued them with great slaughter. No∣thing
in Ireland now dared to oppose themselves to the English<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 773.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY, jealous of the progress of his own subjects,
sent orders to recall all the English, and he made prepa∣rations
to attack Ireland in person<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 770.</NOTE>: But Richard, and
the other adventurers, found means to appease him, by
making him the most humble submissions, and offering
to hold all their acquisitions in vassalage to his crown<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 775.</NOTE>.
That monarch landed in Ireland at the head of five hun∣dred
knights, besides other soldiers; and found the Irish
so dispirited by their late misfortunes, that, in a progress
which he made thro' the island, he had no other occu∣pation
than to receive the homages of his new subjects<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 27, 28. Hoveden, p. 527. Diceto, p. 559.</NOTE>.
He left most of the Irish chieftains or princes in posses∣sion
of their antient territories; bestowed some lands on
the English adventurers; gave earl Richard the commis∣sion
of seneschal of Ireland; and after a stay of a few
months, returned in triumph into England. By these
trivial exploits, scarce worth relating, except for the
importance of the consequences, was Ireland subdued,
and annexed for ever to the English crown.</P>
<P>THE low state of commerce and industry, during those
ages, made it impracticable for princes to support regular
<PB N="461" REF="501"/>
armies, which might retain the conquered countries in
subjection; and the extreme barbarism and poverty of
Ireland could still less afford means of bearing this ex∣pence.
The only expedient by which a durable con∣quest
could then be made or maintained, was by pour∣ing
in a multitude of new inhabitants, dividing among
them the lands of the vanquished, establishing them in all
offices of trust and authority, and thereby transforming
the antient inhabitants into a new people. By this po∣licy,
the northern invaders of old, and of late the duke
of Normandy, had been able to fix their dominion, and
to erect kingdoms, which remained stable on their foun∣dations,
and were transmitted to the posterity of the first
conquerors. But the present state of Ireland rendered
that island so little inviting to the English, that only a
few of desperate fortunes could be persuaded, from time
to time, to transport themselves into it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1069. Neubrig. p. 403.</NOTE>; and instead of
reclaiming the natives from their uncultivated manners,
they were gradually assimilated to the antient inhabitants,
and degenerated from the customs of their own nation.
It was also found requisite to bestow great military and
arbitrary powers on the leaders, who commanded a
handful of men amidst such hostile multitudes; and law
and equity, in a little time, became as much unknown
in the English settlements as they had ever been among
the Irish tribes. Palatinates were erected in favour of
the new adventurers; independant authority conferred;
the natives, never fully subdued, still retained their
animosities against the conquerors: Their hatred was
retaliated by like injuries; and from these causes, the
Irish, during the course of four centuries, remained still
savage and untractable; and it was not till the latter end
of Elizabeth's reign, that the island was fully subdued;
<PB N="462" REF="502"/>
nor till that of her successor, that it gave hopes of be∣coming
an useful conquest to the English nation.</P>
<P>BESIDES that the easy and peaceable submission of the
Irish left Henry no farther occupation in that island, he
was recalled from it by another incident, which was of
the last importance to his interests and safety. The two
legates, Albert and Theodin, to whom was committed
the trial of his conduct in the death of archbishop
Becket, were arrived in Normandy; and being impa∣tient
of delay, sent him frequent letters, full of mena∣ces,
if he protracted any longer the making his appear∣ance
before them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Girald. Cambr. p. 778.</NOTE>. He hastened therefore to Normandy,
and had a conference with them a Savigny, where their
first demands were so exorbitant, that he broke off the
negotiation, threatened to return to Ireland, and bade
them do their worst against him. They perceived, that
the season was now past for taking advantage of that
tragical incident; which, had it been hotly pursued by
interdicts and excommunications, was capable of throw∣ing
the whole kingdom into combustion. But the time,
which Henry had happily gained, had contributed to ap∣pease
the minds of men: The event could not now have
the same influence, as when it was recent; and as the
clergy had every day looked for an accommodation with
the King, they had not opposed the pretensions of his
partizans, who had been very industrious in representing
to the people his entire innocence in the murder of the
primate, and his ignorance of the designs formed by the
assassins. The legates, therefore, found themselves obli∣ged
to lower their terms; and Henry was so fortunate
as to conclude an accommodation with them. He decla∣red
upon oath, before the reliques of the saints, that so
far from commanding or desiring the death of the arch∣bishop,
<PB N="463" REF="503"/>
he was extremely grieved when he received in∣telligence
of it: But as the passion which he had ex∣pressed
on account of that prelate's conduct, had pro∣bably
given occasion to his murder, he stipulated the fol∣lowing
conditions, as an atonement for the offence. He
promised,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's accommo∣dation
with the court of Rome</NOTE> that he should pardon all such as had been ba∣nished
for their adherence to Becket, and should restore
them to their livings; that the see of Canterbury should
be reinstated in all its antient possessions; that he should
pay the templars a sum of money sufficient for the sub∣sistance
of two hundred knights during a year in the
holy land; that he should himself take the cross at the
Christmas following, and, if the Pope insisted on it,
serve three years against the infidels, either in Spain or
in Palestine; that he should not insist on the observance
of such customs, derogatory to ecclesiastical privileges, as
had been introduced in his own time; and that he should
not stop appeals to the Pope in ecclesiastical causes, but
should content himself with exacting sufficient security
of the clergy, who left his dominions to prosecute an
appeal, that they should attempt nothing against the
rights of his crown<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 88. Benedict. Abb. p. 34. Hoveden, p. 529. Diceto, p. 560. Chron. Gerv. p. 1422.</NOTE>. Upon signing these concessions,
Henry received absolution from the legates; was con∣firmed
in the grant made by Pope Adrian of Ireland<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1071. Liber. Nig. Scac. p. 47.</NOTE>;
and nothing proves more strongly the great abilities of
this monarch, than his extricating himself, on such easy
terms, from so difficult a situation. He had always in∣sisted,
that the laws, established at Clarendon, contained
not any new claims, but the antient customs of the king∣dom;
and he was still at liberty, notwithstanding the
articles of this agreement, to maintain his pretensions.
Appeals to the Pope were indeed permitted by this treaty;
<PB N="464" REF="504"/>
but as the King was also permitted to exact reasonable
securities from the parties, and might stretch his de∣mands
on this head as far as he pleased, he had it vir∣tually
in his power to prevent the Pope from reaping
any advantage by this seeming concession. And on the
whole, the constitutions of Clarendon remained still the
law of the realm; tho' the Pope and his legates seem so
little to have conceived the King's power to lie under
any legal limitations, that they were satisfied with his
departing, by treaty, from one of the most momen∣tous
articles of these constitutions, without requiring
any repeal by the states of the kingdom.</P>
<P>HENRY, freed from this dangerous controversy with
the ecclesiastics and with the see of Rome, seemed now
to have reached the pinnacle of human grandeur and feli∣city,
and to be equally happy in his domestic situation
and in his political government. A numerous progeny
of sons and daughters gave both lustre and authority to
his crown, prevented the dangers of a disputed succes∣sion,
and repressed all pretensions of the ambitious barons.
The King's precaution also, in establishing the several
branches of his family, seemed well calculated to pre∣vent
all jealousies among the brothers, and to perpetuate
the greatness of his family. He had ordered Henry, his
eldest son, to be anointed King, and had destined him
to be his successor in the kingdom of England, the dutchy
of Normandy, and the counties of Anjou, Maine, and
Touraine; territories which lay contiguous, and which,
by that means, might easily lend to each other mutual
assistance, both against intestine commotions and foreign
invasions. Richard, his second son, was invested in the
dutchy of Guienne and county of Poictou; Geoffrey,
his third son, inherited, in right of his wife, the
dutchy of Brittany; and his new conquest of Ireland
was destined for the appanage of John, his fourth son.
<PB N="465" REF="505"/>
He had also negotiated, in favour of this last prince, a
marriage with Adelais, the only daughter of Humbert,
count of Savoy and Maurienne; and was to receive as
her dowry very considerable demesnes in Piedmont, Sa∣voy,
Bresse, and Dauphiny<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 448. Bened. Abb. p. 38 Hoveden, p. 532. Diceto, p. 561. Brompton, p. 1082. Rymer, vol i. p. 33.</NOTE>. But this exaltation of his
family excited the jealousy and envy of all his neighbours,
who made those very ions, whose fortunes he had so
anxiously etablished, the means of imbittering his future
life and disturbing his government.</P>
<P>YOUNG Henry, who was rising to man's estate, began
to display his character, and aspire to independance:
Brave, ambitious, liberal, magnificent, affable; he dis∣covered
qualities, which give great lustre to youth;
prognosticate a shining fortune; but, unless tempered in
mature age with discretion, are the forerunners of the
greatest calamities<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron Gerv. p. 1463.</NOTE>. It is said, that at the time when
this prince was anointed King, his father, in order to
give greater dignity to the ceremony, officiated at table
as one of the retinue; and observed to his son, that ne∣ver
King was more royally served. <HI>It is nothing extraor∣dinary,</HI>
said young Henry to one of his courtiers, <HI>if the
son of a count should serve the son of a King.</HI> This say∣ing,
which might pass only for an innocent pleasantry,
or even for an oblique compliment to his father, was
however regarded as a symptom of his aspiring temper;
and his conduit soon after justified the conjecture.</P>
<P>HENRY, agreeable to the promise which he had given
both to the Pope and the French King, permitted his
son to be crowned anew by the hands of the archbishop
of Roüen, and associated the princess Margaret, spouse
to young Henry, in this ceremony<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 529. Diceto, p. 560. Brompton, p. 1080. Chron. Gerv. p. 1421. Trivet, p. 58.</NOTE>. He afterwards
<PB N="466" REF="506"/>
allowed him to pay a visit to his father-in-law at Paris,
who took the opportunity of inspiring into the young
prince those ambitious sentiments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1173.</NOTE> to which he was na∣turally
but too much inclined<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Girald. Cambr. p. 782.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of young Henry and his bro∣thers.</NOTE> Tho' it had been the
<HI>young</HI> constant practice of France, ever since the accession of
the Capetian line, to crown the son during the lifetime
of the father, without conferring on him any present
participation of royalty; Lewis persuaded his son-in-law,
that by this ceremony, which in those ages was deemed
so momentous, he had acquired a title to sovereignty,
and that the King could not, without injustice, exclude
him from immediate possession of the whole, or at least
a part of his dominions. In consequence of these ex∣travagant
ideas, young Henry, on his return, desired the
King to resign to him either the crown of England or
the dutchy of Normandy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 37. Hoveden, p. 531. Brompton, p. 1083. Chron. Gervase, p. 1424.</NOTE>; discovered great discontent
on the refusal; spoke in the most undutiful terms of his
father; and soon after, according to concert, made his
escape to Paris, where he was protected and supported by
the French monarch<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 533. Diceto, p. 561. Brompton, p. 1083. He∣ming. p. 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry was alarmed with this event, and had
the prospect of dangerous intrigues, or even of a war,
which, whether successful or not, must be extremely ca∣lamitous
and disagreeable to him, he received intelligence
of new misfortunes, which must have affected him in
the most sensible part. Queen Eleanor, who had dis∣gusted
her first husband by her gallantries, was no less
offensive to her second, by her jealousy; and after this
manner, carried to extremity, in the different parts of
her life, every circumstance of female weakness. She
<PB N="467" REF="507"/>
communicated her discontents against Henry to her two
younger sons, Geoffrey and Richard; persuaded them
that they were also entitled to present possession of the
territories assigned to them; engaged them to fly secretly
to the court of France<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 48. Brompton, p. 1083. Neubrig. p. 404</NOTE>; and was meditating, herself, an
escape to the same court, and had even put on man's ap∣parel
for that purpose; when she was seized by orders
from her husband, and was thrown into confinement<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Gerv. p. 1424.</NOTE>.
Thus, Europe saw with astonishment the best and most
indulgent of parents at war with his whole family;
three boys, scarce arrived at the age of puberty, require
a great monarch, in the full vigour of his age and height
of his reputation, to dethrone himself in their favour;
and several princes not ashamed to support them in these
unnatural and absurd pretensions.</P>
<P>HENRY, reduced to this perilous and disagreeable situa∣tion,
had recourse to the court of Rome; and tho' sen∣sible
of the danger attending the interposition of eccle∣siastical
authority in temporal disputes, applied to the
Pope, as his superior lord, to excommunicate his ene∣mies,
and by these censures to reduce to obedience his
undutiful children, whom he found such a reluctance to
punish by the sword of the magistrate<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Epist. Petri Bles. epist. 136. in Biblioth. Patr. tom. xxiv. p. 1048. His words are, <HI>Vestrae jurisdictionis est regnum Angliae, et quantum ad feu∣datarii juris obligationem, vobis duntaxat obnoxius teneor.</HI> The same paper is in Rymer, vol. i. p. 35. and Trivet, vol. i. p. 62.</NOTE>. Alexander, well
pleased to exert his power in so plausible a cause, issued
the bulls required of him: But it was soon found, that
these spiritual weapons had not equal force as when
employed in a spiritual controversy; and that the clergy
were very negligent in supporting a sentence, which was
nowise calculated to promote the immediate interests of
<PB N="468" REF="508"/>
their order. The King, after taking this humiliating
step, was obliged to have recourse to arms, and to inlist
such auxiliaries, as are the usual resource of tyrants,
and have seldom been employed by so wise and just a
monarch.</P>
<P>THE loose government, which prevailed in all the
states of Europe, the many private wars carried on
among the neighbouring nobles, and the impossibility to
enforce any general execution of the laws, had encou∣raged
a tribe of banditti to disturb every where the public
peace, to infest the high roads, to pillage the open
country, and to brave all the efforts of the civil magi∣strate,
and even the excommunications of the church,
which were thundered out against them<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Neubrig. p. 413.</NOTE>. Troops of
them were sometimes inlisted in the service of one prince
or baron, sometimes in that of another: They often
acted in an independant manner, under leaders of their
own: The peaceful and industrious inhabitants, reduced
to poverty by their ravages, were frequently obliged for
subsistance to betake themselves to a like disorderly course
of life: And a continual intestine war, pernicious to
industry, as well as to the execution of justice, was thus
carried on in the bowels of every kingdom<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Gerv. p. 1461.</NOTE>. These
desperate ruffians received the name sometimes of Bra∣bançons,
sometimes of Routiers or Cottereaux; but for
what reason, is not agreed by historians: And they formed
a kind of society or government among themselves,
which set at defiance all the rest of mankind. The
greatest monarchs were not ashamed, on occasion, to
have recourse to their assistance; and as their habits of
war and devastation had given them experience, hardi∣ness,
and courage, they generally composed the most
formidable part of those armies, which decided the poli∣tical
<PB N="469" REF="509"/>
quarrels of princes. Several of them were enlisted
among the forces levied by Henry's enemies<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Petr. Bles. epist. 47.</NOTE>; but the
great treasures amassed by that prince enabled him to
engage more numerous troops of them in his service;
and the situation of his affairs rendered even such banditti
the only forces on whose fidelity he could repose any
confidence. His licentious barons, disgusted with a vigi∣lant
government, were more desirous of being ruled by
young princes, ignorant of public affairs, remiss in their
conduct, and profuse in their grants<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 570.</NOTE>; and as the King
had ensured to his sons the succession to every particular
province of his dominions, the nobles dreaded no danger
in adhering to those who, they knew, must some time
become their sovereigns. Prompted by these motives,
many of the Norman nobility had deserted to his son
Henry; the Breton and Gascon barons seemed equally
disposed to embrace the quarrel of Geoffrey and Richard<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 534. Trivet, p. 59.</NOTE>.
Disaffection had crept in among the English; and the
earls of Leicester and Chester in particular had openly
declared against the King<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 448. Brompton, p. 1085. Neubrig. p. 405. Heming. p. 499.</NOTE>: Twenty thousand Bra∣bançons,
therefore, joined to some troops, which he
brought over from Ireland, and a few barons of approv∣ed
fidelity, formed the sole force, with which he pro∣posed
to resist his enemies<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 534. Chron. Gerv. p. 1427. Neubrig. p. 405. Heming. p. 499. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 32. Trivet, p. 60.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEWIS, in order to bind the confederates in a closer
union, summoned at Paris an assembly of the chief
vassals of the crown, received their approbation of his
measures, and engaged them by oath to adhere to the
cause of young Henry<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 49. Hoveden, p. 533. Chron. Gerv. p. 1424.</NOTE>. That prince, in return, bound
<PB N="470" REF="510"/>
himself by a like tie never to desert his French allies;
and having made a new great seal<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1084.</NOTE>, he lavishly distri∣buted
among them many considerable parts of those ter∣ritories
which he proposed to conquer from his father<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 49. Hoveden, p. 533.</NOTE>.
Philip, count of Flanders, Matthew, count of Boulogne,
his brother, Theobald, count of Blois, Henry, count of
Eu, partly moved by the general jealousy which had
been excited by Henry's power and ambition, partly al∣lured
by the prospect of reaping advantage from the in∣considerate
temper and the necessities of the young prince,
declared openly in favour of the latter. William, King
of Scotland, had also entered into this great confederacy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Mailr. p. 172. Brompton, p. 1084.</NOTE>;
and a plan was concerted for a general invasion on dif∣ferent
places of the King's extensive and factious domi∣nions.</P>
<P>HOSTILITIES were first commenced by the counts of
Flanders and Boulogne on the frontiers of Normandy.
These princes formed the siege of Aumale, which, by
the treachery of the count of that name, was delivered
into their hands<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neust. p. 449. Diceto, p. 571.</NOTE>: That nobleman surrendered himself
prisoner; and, on pretence of thereby paying his ran∣som,
opened the gates of all his other fortresses. The
two counts next besieged and made themselves masters
of Drincourt: But the count of Boulogne was here
mortally wounded in the assault; and this event put
some stop to the progress of the Flemish arms<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 534. Brompton, p. 1085. Neubrig. p. 405. Heming. p. 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN another quarter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wars and insurrecti∣ons.</NOTE> the King of France, being strongly
assisted by his vassals, assembled a great army of seven
thousand knights and their followers on horseback, and
<PB N="471" REF="511"/>
a proportionable number of infantry; and carrying young
Henry along with him, laid siege to Verneüil, which
was vigorously defended by Hugh de Lacy and Hugh de
Beauchamp, the governors<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 534.</NOTE>. After he had lain a month
before the place, the garrison, being straitened for pro∣visions,
were obliged to capitulate; and they engaged,
if not relieved within three days, to surrender the town,
and to retire into the citadel. On the last of these days,
Henry appeared with his army upon the heights above Ver∣neüil;
and Lewis, dreading an assault, sent the archbishop
of Sens and the count of Blois to the English camp, and
desired that next day should be appointed for a conference,
in order to establish a general peace, and terminate the
differences between Henry and his sons. The King, who
passionately desired this agreement, and suspected no
fraud, gave his consent; but Lewis, that morning,
obliging the garrison to surrender, according to the capi∣tulation,
set fire to the place, and began to retire with
his army<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bened. p. 57, 58, &amp;c. Hoveden, p. 535. Diceto, p. 570, 57l, 572. Brompton, p. 1085, 1086, 1087.</NOTE>. Henry, provoked at this artifice, attacked
the rear with vigour, put them to rout, committed some
slaughter, and took several prisoners. The French army,
as their time of service was now expired, immediately
dispersed themselves into their several provinces; and left
Henry free to prosecute his advantages against his other
enemies.</P>
<P>THE nobles of Brittany, excited by the earl of
Chester and Ralph de Fougeres, were all in arms; but
their progress was checked by a body of Brabançons,
which the King, after Lewis's retreat, had sent against
them. The two armies came to an action near Dol;
where the rebels were defeated, fifteen hundred killed on
the spot, and the leaders, the earl of Chester and Fou∣geres,
<PB N="472" REF="512"/>
obliged to take shelter in the town of Dol<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 63. Hoveden, p. 535.</NOTE>.
Henry hastened to form the siege of that place, and car∣ried
on the attack with such ardour, that he obliged the
governor and garrison to surrender themselves prisoners
of war<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Benedict. Abb. p. 64, 65. Hoveden, p. 535. Diceto, p. 574. Neubrig. p. 406. Heming. p. 500. Trivet, p. 61.</NOTE>.
By these vigorous measures and happy suc∣cesses,
the insurrections were entirely quelled in Brit∣tany;
and the King, being thus fortunate in all quar∣ters,
willingly agreed to a conference with Lewis, in
hopes, that his enemies, finding all their mighty efforts
entirely frustrated, would agree to terminate hostilities
on some moderate and reasonable conditions.</P>
<P>THE two monarchs met between Trie and Gisors;
and Henry had here the mortification to see his three
sons in the retinue of his mortal enemy. As Lewis
had no other pretence for war than supporting the claims
of these young princes, the King made them such of∣fers
as children ought to be ashamed to insist on, and
could be extorted from him by nothing but his parental
affection or by the present necessity of his affairs<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 539.</NOTE>. He
insisted only on retaining the sovereign authority in all
his dominions; but offered young Henry the half of the
revenues of England, with some places of surety in that
kingdom; or if he rather chose to reside in Normandy,
the half of the revenues of that dutchy, with all those
of Anjou. He made a like offer to Richard in Guienne;
he promised to resign all Brittany to Geoffrey; and if
these concessions were not deemed suffcient, he agreed
to add to them whatever the Pope's legates, who were
present, should require of him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 536. Brompton, p. 1088.</NOTE>. The earl of Leices∣ter
was admitted to this negotiation; and either from
the impetuosity of his temper, or from a view of break∣ing
<PB N="473" REF="513"/>
off abruptly a conference, which must cover the al∣lies
with confusion, he gave vent to the most violent re∣proaches
against Henry, and even put his hand to his
sword, as if he meant to attempt some violence upon
him. This furious action threw the whole company
into confusion, and put an end to the treaty<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 536.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE chief hopes of Henry's enemies seemed now to
depend on the state of affairs in England, where his au∣thority
was exposed to the most imminent danger. One
article of young Henry's agreement with his foreign
confederates, was, that he should resign Kent, with
Dover and all its other fortresses, into the hands of the
count of Flanders<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 533. Brompton, p. 1084. Neubr. p. 508.</NOTE>; yet so little national or public spi∣rit
prevailed among the independant English nobility, so
wholly bent were they on the aggrandizement each of
himself and his own family, that, notwithstanding this
pernicious concession, which must have produced the
total ruin of the kingdom, the majority of them had
conspired to make an insurrection and to support the
prince's pretensions. The King's chief resource lay in
the church and the bishops, with whom he was now in
perfect agreement; whether that the decency of their
character made them ashamed of supporting so unnatural
a rebellion, or that they were entirely satisfied with
Henry's atonement for the murder of Becket and for his
former invasion of ecclesiastical immunities. That prince,
however, had resigned none of the essential rights of
his crown in the accommodation; he maintained still the
same prudent jealousy of the court of Rome; admitted
no legate into England, without his swearing to attempt
nothing against his royal prerogatives; and he had even
obliged the monks of Canterbury, who pretended to a
free election on the vacancy, made by the death of
<PB N="474" REF="514"/>
Becket, to choose Roger, prior of Dover, in the place
of that turbulent prelate<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 537.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of Scotland now made an irruption into
Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> and committed great devastations; and
being opposed by Richard de Lucy, whom Henry had
left guardian of the realm, he retreated into his own
kingdom, and agreed to a cessation of arms<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 89. Hoveden, p. 536. Diceto, p. 573. Bromp∣ton, p. 1089. Neubrig. p. 407.</NOTE>. This
truce enabled the guardian to march southwards with his
army, in order to oppose an invasion, which the earl
of Leicester, at the head of a great body of Flemings,
had made upon Suffolk. The Flemings had been joined
by Hugh Bigod, who made them masters of his castle
of Framingham; and marching into the heart of the
kingdom, where they hoped to be supported by Leices∣ter's
vassals, they were met by Lucy, who, assisted by
Humphrey Bohun, the constable, and the earls of Arun∣del,
Glocester, and Cornwal, had advanced to Farn∣ham
with a less numerous, but braver army, to oppose them.
The Flemings, who were mostly weavers and
other tradesmen (for manufactures were now beginning
to be established in Flanders) were broke in an instant,
ten thousand of them were put to the sword, the earl
of Leicester was taken prisoner, and the remains of the
invaders were glad to compound for a safe retreat into
their own country<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 89. Bened. Abb. p. 70. Hoveden, p. 536. Di∣ceto, p. 574. Brompton, p. 1089. Neub. p. 407. Heming. p. 500.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS great defeat did not dishearten the malcontents;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1174.</NOTE>
who, being supported by the alliance of so many, foreign
princes, and encouraged by the King's own sons, deter∣mined
to persevere in their enterprize. The earl of
Ferrars, Roger de Mowbray, Archetil de Mallory,
<PB N="475" REF="515"/>
Richard de Moreville, Hamo de Mascie, together with
many friends of the earls of Leicester and Chester, rose
in arms<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 54. Hoveden, p. 537. Neubrig. p. 407.</NOTE>: The fidelity of the earls of Clare and Glo∣cester
was suspected; and the guardian, tho' vigorously
supported by Geoffrey, bishop of Lincoln, the King's
natural son by the fair Rosamond, found it difficult to
defend himself on all quarters, from so many open and
concealed enemies. The more to augment the con∣fusion,
the King of Scotland, on the expiration of the
truce, broke into the northern provinces with a vast ar∣my<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 501.</NOTE> of 80,000 men; which, tho' undisciplined and dis∣orderly,
and better adapted for committing devastation,
than for executing any military enterprise, was become
dangerous from the present factious and turbulent spirit
of the kingdom. Henry, who had baffled all his ene∣mies
in France, and had put his frontiers in a posture of
defence, now found England the seat of danger; and he
determined by his presence to overawe the malcontents,
or by his conduct and courage to subdue them. He
landed at Southampton;<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th July.</NOTE> and knowing the influence of
superstition over the minds of the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penance of Henry for Becket's murder.</NOTE> he immediately
hastened to Canterbury, in order to make atonement
to the ashes of Thomas a Becket, and tender his sub∣missions
to a dead enemy. So soon as he came within
sight of the church of Canterbury, he descended from
horseback, walked barefoot towards it, prostrated himself
before the shrine of the saint, remained in fasting and
prayer during a whole day, watched all night the holy
reliques; and not satisfied with this hypocritical devo∣tion
towards a man, whose violence and ingratitude had
so long disquieted his government, and had been the ob∣ject
of his most inveterate animosity, he submitted to a
penance, still more singular and humiliating. He as∣sembled
<PB N="476" REF="516"/>
a chapter of the monks, disrobed himself before
them, put a scourge of discipline into each of their
hands, and presented his bare shoulders to the lashes
which these ecclesiastics successively inflicted upon him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ypod Neust. p. 450. M. Paris, p. 90. Hoveden, p. 539. Di∣ceto, p. 577. Brompton, p. 1095. Chron. Gerv. p. 1427. Neubrig. p. 410. Chron. Dunstaple, p. 35.</NOTE>.
Next day, he received absolution, and departing for
London, got soon after the agreeable intelligence of a
great victory which, his generals had obtained over the
Scots, and which being gained on the very day of his
absolution, was regarded as the earnest of his final re∣conciliation
with Heaven and with Thomas a Becket<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ypod Neust. p. 450. M. Paris, p. 90. Bened. Abb. P. 83. Hoveden, p. 539. M. West. p. 251.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, King of Scots, tho' repulsed before the
castle of Prudhow, and other fortified places, had been
able to commit the most horrible depredations upon the
northern, provinces<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 73. Hoveden, p. 537. Brompton, p. 1090. Chron. Gerv. p. 1427. Neubrig. p. 408.</NOTE>; but on the approach of Ralph de
Glanville, the famous lawyer and justiciary, seconded
by Bernard de Baliol, Robert de Stuteville, Odonel de
Umfreville, William de Vesci, and other northern ba∣rons,
together with the gallant bishop of Lincoln, he
thought proper to retreat nearer his own country, and
fixed his station at Alnwic. He had here weakened his
army extremely, by sending out numerous detachments
in order to extend his ravages; and he lay absolutely
safe, as he imagined, from any attack, of the enemy.
But Glanville, informed of his situation, made a hasty
and fatiguing march to Newcastle; and allowing his
soldiers only a small interval for refreshment, he im∣mediately
set out towards evening for Alnwic. He
marched that night above thirty miles;<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th July.</NOTE> arrived in the
morning, under cover of a mist, near the Scots camp; and
<PB N="477" REF="517"/>
regardless of the great multitude of the enemy, he be∣gan
the attack with his small, but determined, body of
cavalry. William was living in such supine security,
that he took the English at first for a body of his own
ravagers, who were returning to the camp: But the
sight of their banners convincing him of his mistake, he
entered on the action with no more than a body of a
hundred horse, in confidence, that the numerous army,
which surrounded him, would soon hasten to his relief.
He was dismounted on the first shock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">William, King of Scotland, defeated and taken prisoner.</NOTE> and taken pri∣soner,
while his troops, hearing of this disaster, fled on
all sides with the utmost precipitation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 76. Brompton, p. 1091, 1092. Neubrig. p. 408, 409. Heming. p. 502.</NOTE>. The disperst

<P>THIS great and important victory proved at last de∣cisive
in favour of Henry, and broke entirely the spirit
of the English rebels. The bishop of Durham, who
was preparing to revolt, made his submissions<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 76.</NOTE>; Hugh
Bigod, tho' he had received a strong reinforcement of
Flemings, was obliged to surrender all his castles, and
throw himself on the King's mercy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 570.</NOTE>; no other resource
was left to the earl of Ferrars and Roger de Mou∣bray<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 91. Heming. p. 504.</NOTE>;
the inferior rebels imitating the example, all
England was restored to tranquillity in a few weeks;
and as the King, appeared to lie under the immediate
protection of heaven, it was deemed impious any longer
to resist him. The clergy exalted anew the merits and
powerful intercession of Becket; and Henry, instead of
opposing this superstition, plumed himself on the new
<PB N="478" REF="518"/>
friendship of that saint, and propagated an opinion which
was so favourable to his interests<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 539.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>YOUNG Henry, who was ready to embark at Grave∣lines
with the earl of Flanders and a great army, hear∣ing
of the suppression of his partizans in England,
abandoned all thoughts of the enterprize, and joined
the camp of the French King, who, during the ab∣sence
of old Henry, had made an irruption into Nor∣mandy,
and had laid siege to Roüen<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1096.</NOTE>. The place was
defended with great vigour by the inhabitants<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 578.</NOTE>; and
Lewis, despairing of success by open force, tried to gain
the town by a stratagem, which, in that superstitious
age, was deemed very little honourable. He proclaimed
in his own camp a cessation of arms on pretence of cele∣brating
the festival of St. Laurence; and when the ci∣tizens,
supposing themselves in safety, were so impru∣dent
as to remit their guard, he proposed to take ad∣vantage
of their security. Happily, some priests had,
from mere curiosity, mounted a steeple, where the alarm
bell hung; and observing the French camp in motion,
they immediately rang the bell, and gave warning to
the inhabitants, who ran to their several stations. The
French, who, on hearing the bell, hurried to the assault,
had already mounted the walls in several places; but
being repulsed by the enraged citizens, were obliged to
retreat with considerable loss<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1096. Neubrig. p. 411. Heming. p. 503.</NOTE>. Next day, Henry, who
had hastened to the defence of his Norman dominions,
passed over the bridge in triumph; and entered Roüen
in sight of the French army. The city was now in ab∣solute
safety; and the King, in order to brave the French
monarch, commanded the gates, which had been wall∣ed
up, to be opened<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 540.</NOTE>; and he prepared to push his ad∣vantages
<PB N="479" REF="519"/>
against the enemy. Lewis saved himself from
this perilous situation by a new piece of deceit, not so
justifiable. He proposed a conference for adjusting the
terms of a general peace, which, he knew, would be greedily embraced by Henry; and while the King of
England trusted to the execution of his promise, he made
a retreat with his army into France<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 86. Brompton, p. 1098.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was, however, a necessity on both sides for an
accommodation. Henry could no longer bear to see his
three sons in the hands of his enemy; and Lewis dread∣ed,
left this great monarch, victorious in all quarters,
crowned with glory, and absolute master of his domi∣nions,
might take revenge for the many dangers and
disquietudes, which the arms, and still more the intrigues
of France, had, in his disputes both with Becket and
his sons, been able to raise him. After making a cessa∣tion
of arms, a conference was agreed on near Tours;
where Henry granted his sons much less advantageous
terms than he had formerly proffered; and he received
their submissions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's accommo∣dation with his sons.</NOTE> The most material of his concessions
were some pensions which he stipulated to pay them,
and some castles which he granted them for the place of

<P>OF all those who had embraced the cause of the young
princes, William, King of Scotland, was the only con∣siderable
sufferer, by that invidious and unjust enter∣prize.
Henry delivered from confinement, without ex∣acting
any ransom, about nine hundred knights whom
he had taken prisoners<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Neubrig. p. 413.</NOTE>; but it cost William the antient
<PB N="480" REF="520"/>
independancy of his crown as the price of his liberty.
He stipulated to do homage to Henry, as his liege lord,
for Scotland and all his other dominions; he engaged
that all the barons and nobility of his kingdom should
also do homage; that the bishops should swear fealty;
that both should swear to adhere to the King of Eng∣land
against their native prince, if the latter should break
his engagements; and that the fortresses of Edinburgh,
Stirling, Berwic, Roxborough, and Jedborough should
be delivered into Henry's hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1175.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Aug.</NOTE> till the performance of
articles<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 91. Chron. Dunst. p. 36. Hoveden, p. 545. M. Westm p. 251. Diceto, p. 584. Brompton, p. 1103. Rymer, vol. i. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9 Liber Niger Scaccarii, p. 36.</NOTE>. This severe and humiliating treaty was exe∣cuted
in its full rigour. That prince, being released,
brought up all his barons, prelates, and abbots; and
they did homage to Henry in the cathedral of York, and
acknowledged him and his successors for their superior lord<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">. Bened. Abb. p. 113.</NOTE>.
The English monarch stretched still farther the
rigour of the conditions which he exacted. He engaged
the Kling and states of Scotland to make a perpetual
cession of the fortresses of Berwic and Roxborough, and
to allow the castle of Edinburgh to remain in his hands
for a limited time. This was the first great ascendant
which England obtained over Scotland; and indeed the
first important event, which had passed between these
kingdoms. Few princes have been so fortunate as to
gain considerable advantages over their weaker neigh∣bours
with less violence and injustice, than was practised
by Henry against the King of Scotland, whom he had
taken prisoner in battle, and who had wantonly engaged
in a war, in which all the neighbours of that prince,
and even all his own family, were, without provoca∣tion,
combined against him.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="521"/>
HENRY, having thus, contrary to expectation, ex∣tricated
himself with honour from a situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's equitable adminis∣tration.</NOTE> in which
his throne was exposed to the most imminent danger,
occupied himself for several years in the administration
of justice, in the execution of the laws, and in guarding
against those inconveniencies, which either the past con∣vulsions
of his state, or the political institutions of that
age, unavoidably occasioned. The provisions, which
he made, show such a largeness of thought as qualified
him to become a legislator; and they were commonly
calculated for the future as well as present happiness of
his kingdom.</P>
<P>He enacted severe penalties against robbery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1176.</NOTE> murder,
false coining, burning houses; and ordained that these
crimes should be punished by the amputation of the right
hand and right foot<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 132. Hoveden, p. 549.</NOTE>. These punishments were pro∣bably
esteemed more severe than death: The pecuniary
commutation for crimes, which has a false appearance
of lenity, had been gradually disused; and seems to
have been entirely abolished by the rigour of these
statutes. The superstitious trial by water ordeal, tho'
condemned by the church<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Seld. Spicileg. ad Eadm. p. 204.</NOTE>, still subsisted; but Henry
ordained, that any man, accused of murder or any hei∣nous
felony by the oath of the legal knights of the
county, should, even tho' acquitted by the ordeal, be
obliged to abjure the realm<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 132.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL advances towards reason and good sense are slow
and gradual. Henry, tho' sensible of the great absur∣dity,
attending the trial by duel or battle, did not ven∣ture
to abolish it: He only admitted either of the par∣ties
to challenge a trial by an assize or jury of twelve
freeholders<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Glanv. lib. 2. cap. 7.</NOTE>. This method of trial seems to have been
<PB N="482" REF="522"/>
very antient in England, and was fixed by the laws of
King Alfred: But the barbarous and violent genius of
the age had of late given more credit to the trial by bat∣tle,
which had become the general method of deciding
all important controversies. It was never abolished by
law in England; and there is an instance of it so late
as the reign of Elizabeth: But the institution revived
by this King, being found more reasonable and more
suitable to a civilized people, gradually prevailed over
it.</P>
<P>THE partition of England into four divisions, and
the appointment of itinerant justices to go the circuit in
each division, and decide the causes in the counties, was
another important ordinance of this prince, had a direct
tendency to restrain the oppressions of the barons, and
to protect the inferior gentry and common people in
their property<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 590.</NOTE>. These justices were either prelates or
considerable nobility; and besides carrying the authority
of the King's commission, were able, by the dignity of
their own character, to give weight and credit to the
laws.</P>
<P>THAT there might be fewer obstacles to the execu∣tion
of justice, the King was vigilant in demolishing all
the new erected castles of the nobility, in England as
well as in his foreign dominions; and he permitted no
fortress to remain in hands, whom he found reason to suspect<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Benedict. Abbas, p. 202. Diceto, p. 585.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT lest the kingdom should be exposed by this de∣molition
of the strong places, the King fixed an assize
of arms, by which all his subjects were obliged to put
themselves in a situation proper for defending themselves
and the realm. Every man, possessed of a knight's fee,
was ordained to have for each fee a coat of mail, a hel∣met,
<PB N="483" REF="523"/>
a shield, and a lance; every free layman possessed
of goods to the value of sixteen marks, was to be arm∣ed
in like manner; every one possessed of ten marks was
obliged to have an iron gorget, a cap of iron, and a
lance; all burgesses were to have a cap of iron, a lance,
and a wambais, that is, a coat twilted with wools, tow,
or such other materials<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 305. Chron. Gerv. p. 1459. Annal. Waverl. p. 161.</NOTE>. It appears, that archery, for
which the English were afterwards so renowned, had
not, at this time, become very common among them.
The spear was the chief weapon employed in battle.</P>
<P>THE clergy and the laity were during that age in a
strange situation with regard to each other, and such as
may seem totally incompatible with a civilized, and in∣deed
with any government. If a clergyman was guilty
of murder he could only be punished by degradation:
If he was murdered, the murderer, was only exposed to
excommunication and ecclesiastical censures; and the
crime was atoned for by penances and submission<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Petri Blessen. epist. 73. apud Bibl. Patr. tom. 24. p. 9<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.</NOTE>.
Hence the assassins of Thomas a Becket himself, tho'
guilty of the most atrocious wickedness, and the most
repugnant to the sentiments of that age, lived securely
in their own houses, without being called to account by
Henry himself, who was so much concerned, both in
honour and interest, to punish that crime, and who pro∣fessed
or affected on all occasions the most extreme ab∣horrence
of it. It was not till they found their presence
shunned by every one as excommunicated persons, that
they were induced to take a journey to Rome, to throw
themselves at the Pope's feet, and to submit to the pe∣nances
imposed upon them: After which, they continued
to possess, without molestation, their honours and for∣tunes,
and seem even to have recovered the countenance
<PB N="484" REF="524"/>
and good opinion of the public. But as the King, by
the constitutions of Clarendon, which he endeavoured
still to maintain in force<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Gervase, p. 1433.</NOTE>, had subjected the clergy to a
trial by the civil magistrate, it seemed but just to give
them the protection of that power, to which they were
subjeced; and it was enacted, that the murderers of
clergymen should be tried before the justiciary in the pre∣sence
of the bishop or his official; and besides the usual
punishment for murder, should be subjected to a forfei∣ture
of their estates, and a confiscation of their goods
and chattles<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 592. Chron. Gervase, p. 1433.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King passed a very equitable law, that the goods
of a vassal shall not be seized for the debt of his lord,
unless the vassal be surety for the debt; and that the rents
of vassals shall be paid to the creditors of the lord, not
to the lord himself. It is remarkable, that this law was
enacted by the King in a council which he held at Ver∣neüil,
and which consisted of some prelates and barons
of England, as well as some of Normandy, Poictou,
Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Brittany; and the sta∣tute
took place in all these different territories<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bened, Abb. p. 248. It was usual for the Kings of England, af∣ter the conquest of Ireland, to summon barons and members of that country to the English parliament. Molineux's Case of Ireland, p. 64, 65, 66.</NOTE>: A cer∣tain
proof how irregular the antient feudal government
was, and how near the Kings, in some instances, ap∣proached
to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>potism, tho' in others they seemed scarce
to possess any authority. If a prince, much dreaded
and revered like Henry, obtained but the appearance of
general consent to an ordinance, which was equitable
and just, it became immediately an established law, and
all the world acquiesced in it. If the prince was hated
or despised; if the nobles, who supported him, had small
<PB N="485" REF="525"/>
influence; if the humours of the times disposed the peo∣ple
to question the justice of his ordinances; the fullest
and most authentic council had no authority. Thus all
was confusion and disorder; no regular ideas of a con∣stitution
prevailed; force and violence decided every thing.</P>
<P>THE success which had attended Henry in his wars
did not encourage his neighbours to attempt any thing
against him; and his transactions with them, during the
remainder of his reign, contain little memorable. Scot∣land
remained in that state of feudal subjection, to which
he had reduced it; and gave him no farther inquietude.
He sent over his fourth son, John, into Ireland, with
a view of making a more compleat conquest of that
island; but the petulance and incapacity of this prince,
by which he enraged the Irish chieftains, obliged him
soon after to recall him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 437, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The King of France had
fallen into a very abject superstition; and was induced
by a devotion, more sincere than that of Henry, to
make a pilgrimage to the tomb of Becket<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 95. Bened. Abb. p. 318. Hoveden, p. 592. M. Westm. p. 252. Diceto, p. 604.</NOTE>, in order to
obtain his intercession for the recovery of Philip, his eld∣est son. He probably thought himself well intitled to
the favour of that saint, on account of their antient in∣timacy;
and hoped, that kecket, whom he had pro∣tected
while on earth, would not now, that he was so
highly advanced in heaven, forget his old friend and be∣nefactor.
The monks, sensible that their saint's honour
was concerned in the case, failed not to publish, that
Lewis's prayers were answered, and that the young prince
was, by Becket's intercession, restored to health<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 320. Hoveden, p. 592. Brompton, p. 1140.</NOTE>. That
King himself was soon after struck with an apoplexy.
<PB N="486" REF="526"/>
which deprived him of his judgment: Philip, tho' a
youth of fifteen, took on him the administration, till
his father's death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1180.</NOTE> which happened soon after, opened
his way to the throne; and he proved the ablest and
greatest monarch that had governed that kingdom, since
the age of Charlemagne. The superior years, how∣ever,
and experience of Henry, while they moderated
his ambition, gave him such an ascendant over this
prince, that no dangerous rivalship, for a long time,
arose between them. The English monarch, instead of
taking advantage of his situation, rather employed his
good offices to compose the quarrels which arose in the
royal family of France; and he was successful in medi∣ating
a reconcilement between Philip and his mother and
uncles<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 325. Hoveden, p. 593. Brompton, p. 1142. Chron. Gervase, p. 1459.</NOTE>. These services were but ill requited by Phi∣lip,
who, when he came to man's estate, fomented all
the domestic discords in the royal family of England,
and encouraged Henry's sons in their ungrateful and un∣dutiful
behaviour towards him.</P>
<P>YOUNG Henry, equally impatient of obtaining power,
and incapable of using it, renewed his demand to the
King, of resigning Normandy; and on meeting with
a refusal, he fled with his spouse to the court of France:
But not finding Philip disposed to enter into war for his
sake, he accepted of his father's offers of reconcilement,
and made his submissions. It was a cruel circumstance
in the King's fortune, that he could hope for no tran∣quillity
from the criminal enterprises of his sons but by
their mutual discord and animosities, which disturbed his
family, and threw his state into convulsions. Richard,
whom he had made master of Guienne, and who had
displayed his valour and military genius, by suppressing
the revolts of his mutinous barons, refused to obey Hen∣ry's
<PB N="487" REF="527"/>
orders, in doing homage to his elder brother for
that dutchy; and he defended himself against young
Henry and Geoffrey, who, uniting their arms, carried
war into his territories<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ypod Neust. p. 451. Bened Abb. p. 383. Diceto, p. 617.</NOTE>. The King with some diffi∣culty
composed this difference; but immediately found
his eldest son engaged in conspiracies, and ready to take
arms against him. While the young prince was con∣ducting
these criminal designs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1183.</NOTE> he was seized with a fe∣ver
at Martel, a castle near Turenne, to which he had
retired in discontent; and seeing the approach of death,
he was at last struck with remorse for his undutiful be∣haviour
towards his father. He sent a messenger to the
King, who was not far distant; expressed his contrition
for his faults; and entreated the favour of a visit, that
he might at least die with the satisfaction of having re∣ceived
his forgiveness. Henry, who had so often expe∣rienced
the prince's ingratitude and violence, appre∣hended
that his sickness was entirely a feint, and he
dared not to entrust himself into his son's hands<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Bened Abb. p. 392. Hoveden, p. 620. Brompton, p. 1143. Chron. Gervase, p. 1463. Neubrig. p. 422. Heming. p. 507.</NOTE>: But
when he soon after received intelligence of young Hen∣ry's
death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th June. Death of young Henry.</NOTE> and the proofs of his sincere repentance, this
good prince was affected with the deepest sorrow;
he thrice fainted away; he accused his own hard-heart∣edness
in refusing the dying request of his son; and he
lamented, that he had deprived that prince of the last
opportunity of making atonement for his offences, and
of pouring out his soul in the bosom of his reconciled
father<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 393. Hoveden, p. 621. Trivet, vol. i. p. 84.</NOTE>. Young Henry died in the twenty-eighth year
of his age.</P>
<P>THE behaviour of his surviving children was ill
calculated to give the King any consolation for this loss.
<PB N="488" REF="528"/>
As prince Henry had left no posterity, Richard was be∣come
the heir of all his dominions; and the King in∣tended,
that John, his third surviving son and favour∣ite,
should inherit Guienne as his appanage: But Rich∣ard
refused his consent, fled into that dutchy, and even
made preparations for carrying on war, as well against
his father as against his brother Geoffrey, who was now
put in possession of Brittany. Henry sent for Eleanor,
his Queen, the heiress of Guienne, and required Rich∣ard
to deliver up to her the dominion of these territo∣ries;
which that prince, either dreading an insurrection
of the Gascons in her favour, or retaining some sense of
duty towards her, readily performed; and he returned
peaceably to his father's court. No sooner was this
quarrel accommodated, than Geoffrey, the most vicious
perhaps of all Henry's unhappy family, broke out into
violence; demanded Anjou to be annexed to his domi∣nions
of Brittany; and on meeting with a refusal, fled
to the court of France, and levied armies against his
father<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Neubrig. p. 422.</NOTE>. Henry was freed from this danger by receiving
the affliction of his son's death, who was slain in a
tournament at Paris<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 451. Chron. Gervase, p. 1480.</NOTE>. The widow of Geoffrey, soon
after his decease, was delivered of a son, who received
the name of Arthur, and was invested in the dutchy of
Brittany, under the guardianship of his grandfather,
who, as duke of Normandy, was also superior lord of that
territory. Philip, as lord paramount, disputed some
time his title to this wardship; but was obliged to yield
to the inclinations of the Bretons, who preferred the go∣vernment
of Henry.</P>
<P>BUT the rivalship among these potent princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crusades.</NOTE> and
all their inferior interests, seemed now to have given
place to the general passion for the relief of the holy
<PB N="489" REF="529"/>
land, and the expulsion of the Saracens. These infi∣dels,
tho' obliged to yield to the immense inundation of
Christians in the first crusade, had recovered courage
after the torrent was past; and attacking on all quar∣ters
the settlements of the Europeans, had reduced them
to great difficulties, and obliged them to apply again for
succours from the west. A second crusade, under the
Emperor Conrade, and Lewis VII. King of France, in
which there perished above 200,000 men, brought them
but a temporary relief; and these princes, after losing
such immense armies, and seeing the flower of their no∣bility
fall by their side, returned with little honour into
Europe. But these repeated misfortunes, which drained
the western world of its people and treasure; were not
yet sufficient to cure men of their passion for those spi∣ritual
adventures; and a new incident rekindled with
fresh fury the zeal of the ecclesiastics and military adven∣turers
of the Latin Christians. Saladin, a prince of
great generosity, bravery, and conduct, having fixed
himself on the throne of Egypt, began to extend his
conquests over all the East; and finding the settlements
of the Christians in Palestine an invincible obstacle to
the progress of his arms, he bent the whole force of his
policy and valour to subdue that small and barren, but
important territory. Taking advantage of dissentions,
which prevailed among the champions of the Cross,
and having secretly gained the count of Tripoli, who
commanded their armies, he invaded the frontiers with
a mighty power; and, aided by the treachery of that
count gained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1187.</NOTE> at Tiberiade a compleat victory over
them, which utterly annihilated the force of the already
languishing kingdom of Jerusalem. The holy city itself
fell into his hands after a feeble resistance; the kingdom
of Antioch was almost entirely subdued; and except
some maritime towns, nothing of importance remained
<PB N="490" REF="530"/>
of those boasted conquests, which, near a century be∣fore,
had cost the efforts of all Europe to acquire<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 100.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE western Christians were astonished on receiving
this dismal intelligence. Pope Urban III. it is pretend∣ed,
died of grief; and his successor, Gregory VIII. em∣ployed
the whole time of his short pontificate in rouz∣ing
to arms all the Christians who acknowledged his
authority. The general cry was, that they were un∣worthy
of enjoying any inheritance in heaven, who did
not vindicate from the dominion of the infidels the in∣heritance
of God on earth, and deliver from slavery that
country which had been consecrated by the footsteps of
their Saviour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1188.</NOTE> William, archbishop of Tyre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21th Jan.</NOTE> having
procured a conference between Henry and Philip near
Gisors, enforced all these topics; gave a pathetic de∣scription
of the miserable state of the eastern Christians;
and employed every topic to excite the ruling passions
of the age, superstition and jealousy of military honour<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 531.</NOTE>.
The two monarchs immediately took the cross; many
of their most considerable vassals imitated the example<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Neubrig. p. 435. Heming. p. 512.</NOTE>;
and as the Emperor Frederic I. entered into the same
confederacy, some well grounded hopes of success were
entertained; and men flattered themselves, that an en∣terprize,
which had failed under the conduct of many
independant chieftains, or of weak princes, might at
last, by the efforts of such potent and able monarchs, be
brought to a happy issue.</P>
<P>THE Kings of France and England imposed a tax,
amounting to the tenth of all moveable goods, on such
as remained at home<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 498.</NOTE>; but as they exempted from this
burden most of the regular clergy, the secular aspired to
the same privilege; pretended that it was only their

duty to assist the crusade with their prayers; and it was
with some difficulty they were obliged to desist from an
opposition, which in them, who had been the chief in∣stigators
to these pious enterprizes, appeared with the
worst grace imaginable<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Petri Blessen. epist. 112.</NOTE>. This backwardness of the
clergy is perhaps a symptom, that the enthusiastic ardour,
which had at first seized the people for crusades, was
now considerably abated by time and ill success; and that
the frenzy was chiefly supported by the military genius
and love of glory in the great monarchs.</P>
<P>BUT before this great machine could be put in motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1189.</NOTE>
there were still many obstacles to surmount. Philip,
jealous of Henry's greatness, entered into a private con∣federacy
with young Richard, and working on his am∣bitious
and impatient temper, persuaded him, instead of
supporting and aggrandizing that monarchy, which he was
one day to inherit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of prince Richard.</NOTE> to seek present power and indepen∣dance,
by disturbing and dismembering it. In order to
give a pretence for hostilities between the two Kings,
Richard broke into the territories of Raymond, count of
Tholouse, who immediately carried his complaints of
this violence before the King of France as his superior
lord. Philip remonstrated with Henry; but received for
answer, that Richard had confessed to the archbishop of
Dublin, that his enterprize against Raymond had been
undertaken by the approbation of Philip himself, and
was conducted by his authority. The King of France,
who might have been covered with shame and confusion
by this detection, still prosecuted his design, and broke
into the provinces of Berri and Auvergne, under colour
of revenging the quarrel of the count of Tholouse<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 508.</NOTE>.
Henry retaliated by making inroads upon the frontiers of
France, and burning Dreux. As this war, which
<PB N="492" REF="532"/>
destroyed all hopes of success in the projected crusade,
gave great scandal, the two Kings held a conference at
the accustomed place between Gisors and Trie, in order
to find means of accommodating their differences: They
separated on worse terms than before; and Philip, to
show his disgust, ordered a great elm, under which the
conferences had been usually held, to be cut down<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 517. 532.</NOTE>;
as if he had renounced all desire of accommodation, and
was determined to carry the war to extremity against
the King of England. But his own vassals refused to
serve under him in so invidious a cause<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 519.</NOTE>; and he was
obliged to come anew to a conference with Henry, and
to offer terms of peace. These terms were such as en∣tirely
opened the eyes of the King of England, and fully
proved to him the perfidy of his son, and his secret al∣liance
with Philip, of which he had before only enter∣tained
some suspicions. The King of France required,
that Richard should be crowned King of England in the
lifetime of his father, should be invested in all his trans∣marine
dominions, and should be immediately married to
Alice, Philip's sister, to whom he had formerly been con∣tracted,
and who had been already conducted into England<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 521. Hoveden, p. 652.</NOTE>.
Henry had experienced such fatal effects, both from the
crowning his eldest son, and from that prince's alliance
with the royal family of France, that he rejected these
terms; and Richard, in consequence of his secret agree∣ment
with Philip, immediately revolted from him<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1149. Neubrig. p. 437.</NOTE>, did
homage to the King of France for all the dominions
which Henry held of that crown, and received the in∣vestitures,
as if he had already been the lawful pro∣prietor.
Some historians assert, that Henry himself had
become enamoured of young Alice, and assign this as an
<PB N="493" REF="533"/>
additional reason for his refusing these conditions: But
he had so many other just and equitable motives for his
conduct, that it is needless to seek for a cause, which
the great prudence and advanced age of that monarch
render somewhat improbable.</P>
<P>CARDINAL Albano, the Pope's legate, displeased with
these increasing obstacles to the crusade, excommuni∣cated
Richard, as the chief spring of discord: But the
sentence of excommunication, which, when it was pro∣perly
prepared, and was zealously supported by the clergy,
had often great influence in that age, proved entirely
ineffectual in the present case. The chief barons of
Poictou, Guienne, Normandy, and Anjou, being at∣tached
to the young prince, and seeing that he had now
received the investiture from their superior lord, declared
for him, and made inroads into the territories of such
as still adhered to the old King. Henry, disquieted by
the daily revolts of his mutinous subjects, and dreading
still worse effects from their turbulent disposition, had
again recourse to papal authority; and engaged the car∣dinal
Anagni, who had succeeded Albano in the legate∣ship,
to threaten Philip with laying an interdict on all his
dominions. But Philip, who was a prince of great
vigour and capacity, despised the menace; and told
Anagni, that it belonged not to the Pope to interpose in
the temporal disputes of princes, much less in those be∣tween
him and his rebellious vassals. He even proceeded
so far as to reproach the cardinal with partiality, and with
receiving bribes from the King of England<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 104. Bened. Abb. p. 542. Hoveden, p. 652.</NOTE>; while
Richard, still more outrageous, offered to draw his sword
upon the legate, and was only hindered by the interposi∣tion
of the company, from committing violence upon
him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 104.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="534"/>
THE King of England was now obliged to defend
his dominions by arms, and to enter on a war with
France and with his eldest son, a prince of great valour,
on such disadvantageous terms. Ferté-Barnard fell first
into the hands of the enemy: Mans was next taken by
assault; and Henry, who had thrown himself into that
place, escaped with some difficulty<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 105. Bened. Abb. p. 543. Hoveden, p. 653.</NOTE>: Amboise, Chau∣mont,
and Chateau de Loire, opened their gates on the
appearance of Philip and Richard: Tours was invested;
and the King, who had retired to Saumur, and had daily
instances of the cowardice or infidelity of his governors,
expected the most dismal issue to all his enterprizes.
While he was in this state of despondency, the duke of
Burgundy, the count of Flanders, and the archbishop
of Rheims interposed with their good offices; and the
intelligence, which he received of the taking Tours, and
which made him fully sensible of the desperate situation
of his affairs, so subdued his spirit, that he submitted to
all the rigorous terms, which were imposed upon him.
He agreed, that Richard should marry the princess
Alice; that that prince should receive the homage and
oath of fealty of all his subjects both in England and
his transmarine dominions; that he himself should pay
twenty thousand marks to the King of France as a com∣pensation
for the charges of the war; that his own ba∣rons
should engage to make him observe this treaty by
force, and in case of his violating it, should promise
to join Philip and Richard against him; and that all
his vassals, who had entered into confederacy with
Richard, should receive an indemnity for this offence<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 106. Bened. Abb. p. 545. Hoveden, p. 653.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the mortification, which Henry, who had been
accustomed to give the law in most treaties, received
<PB N="495" REF="535"/>
from these disadvantageous and humiliating terms, was
the least which he met with on this occasion. When he
demanded a list of those barons, to whom he was to grant
a pardon for their connexions with Richard; he was
astonished to find, at the head of them, the name of his
second son, John<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 654.</NOTE>; who had always been his favourite,
whose interests he had ever anxiously at heart, and who
had even, on account of his ascendant over him, often
excited the jealousy of Richard<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 541.</NOTE>. This unhappy father,
already overloaded with cares and sorrows, finding this
last disappointment in his domestic tenderness, broke out
into expressions of the utmost despair, cursed the day in,
which he received his miserable being, and bestowed, on
his ungrateful and undutiful children, a malediction,
which he never could be prevailed on to retract<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 654.</NOTE>. The
more his heart was disposed to friendship and affection,
the more he resented the barbarous return, which his
four sons had successively made to his parental care; and
this finishing blow, by depriving him of every comfort
in life, quite broke his spirits, and threw him into a lin∣gering
fever, of which he soon after expired, at the
castle of Chinon near Saumur.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th July.</NOTE> His natural son, Geof∣frey,
who alone had behaved dutifully towards him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE> at∣tended
his corpse to the nunnery of Fontevrault; where
it lay in state in the abbey-church. Next day, Richard,
who came to visit the dead body of his father, and who,
notwithstanding his criminal conduct, was not altoge∣ther
devoid of generosity, was struck with horror and
remorse at the sight; and as the assistants observed, that,
at that very instant, blood gushed out of the mouth and
nostrils of the corpse<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 547. Brompton. p, 115.</NOTE>, he exclaimed, according to a
vulgar superstition, that he was his father's murderer;
<PB N="496" REF="536"/>
and he expressed a deep sense, tho' too late, of that undu∣tiful
behaviour, which had brought his parent to an
untimely grave<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS died,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac∣ter of Henry.</NOTE> in the fifty-eighth year of his age and
thirty-fifth of his reign, the greatest prince of his time
for wisdom, virtue and ability, and the most powerful in extent of dominion of all those that had ever filled the
throne of England. His character, both in public and
private life, is almost without a blemish; and he seems
to have possessed every accomplishment both of body
and mind, which makes a man either estimable or amiable.
He was of a middle stature, strong and well propor∣tioned;
his countenance was lively and engaging; his
conversation affable and entertaining; his elocution easy,
persuasive, and ever at command. He loved peace, but
possessed both bravery and conduct in war; was provident
without timidity; severe in the execution of justice,
without rigour; and temperate without austerity. He
preserved health, and kept himself from corpulency, to
which he was somewhat inclined, by an abstemious diet,
and by frequent exercise, particularly hunting. When
he could enjoy leisure, he recreated himself either
in learned conversation or in reading; and he cultivated his
natural talents by study, above any prince of his time.
His affections, as well as his enmities, were warm and
durable; and his long experience of the ingratitude and
infidelity of men never destroyed the natural sensibility of
his temper, which disposed him to friendship and society.
His character has been transmitted to us by many writers,
who were his contemporaries<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Petri Bles. epist. 46, 47. in Bibliothieca▪ Patrum, vol. xxiv. p. 985, 986, &amp;c. Girald. Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ p. 783, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and it resembles ex∣tremely,
in its most remarkable strokes, that of his ma∣ternal
grandfather Henry I▪: Excepting only that ambi∣tion,
<PB N="497" REF="537"/>
which was a ruling passion in both, found not in
the first Henry such unexceptionable means of exerting
itself, and pushed that prince into measures, which were
both criminal in themselves, and were the cause of far∣ther
crimes, from which his grandson's conduct was
happily exempted.</P>
<P>THIS prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscellane∣ous trans∣actions of this reign.</NOTE> like most of his predecessors of the
Norman line, except Stephen, passed more of his time
on the continent than in this island: He was surrounded
with the English gentry and nobility, when abroad: The
French gentry and nobility followed him when he resided
in England: Both nations acted in the government, as
if they were the same people; and on many occasions,
the legislatures seem not to have been distinguished. As
the King and English barons were all of them of French
extraction, the manners of that people acquired the as∣cendant,
and were regarded as the great models of imita∣tion.
Ali foreign improvements, therefore, such as they
were, in literature and politeness, in laws and arts,
seem now to have been, in a good measure, transplanted
into England; and that nation was become nowise infe∣rior,
in all the fashionable accomplishments, to any of its
neighbours on the continent. The more homely, but
more sensible manners and principles of the Saxons, were
exchanged for the affectations of chivalry, and the sub∣tilties
of school philosophy: The feudal ideas of civil
government, the Romish sentiments of religion, had
taken entire possession of the people: By the former, the
sense of submission towards princes was somewhat dimi∣nished
in the barons; by the latter, the devoted attach∣ment
to papal authority was much augmented among the
clergy. The Norman and other foreign families, esta∣blished
in England, had now struck deep root; and being
entirely coalited with the people, whom at first they
oppressed and despised, they no longer thought that they
<PB N="498" REF="538"/>
needed the protection of the crown for the enjoyment of
their fortunes, or considered their tenure as precarious
and dependant. They aspired to the same liberty and
independance, which they saw enjoyed by their brethren
on the continent, and desired to restrain those exorbitant
prerogatives and arbitrary practices, which the necessi∣ties
of war and the violence of conquest had at first
obliged them to indulge in their monarch. That memory
also of a more equal government under the Saxon prin∣ces,
which still remained with the English, diffused still
farther the spirit of liberty, and made the barons both
desirous of more independance to themselves, and willing
to indulge it to the people. And it was not long before
this secret revolution in the sentiments of men produced
first violent convulsions in the state, and then an evident
alteration in the maxims of government.</P>
<P>THE history of all the preceding Kings of England
since the conquest, give evident proofs of the disorders
attending <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he feudal government; the licentiousness of
the barons, their spirit of rebellion against the prince
and laws, and of animosity against each other: The
conduct of the barons in the transmarine dominions of
those monarchs afforded perhaps still more flagrant in∣stances of these convulsions; and the history of France,
during several ages, consists almost entirely of narrations
of this nature. The cities, during the continuance of
this violent government, could neither be very populous
nor numerous; and there occur instances, which seem
to prove, that, tho' these are always the first seat of law
and liberty, their police was in general very loose and
irregular, and exposed to the same disorders, with those
by which the country was generally infested. It was a
custom in London for great numbers, to the amount of
a hundred or more, of the sons and relations of eminent
citizens, to form themselves into a licentious, confederacy,
<PB N="499" REF="539"/>
to break into rich houses and plunder them, to rob and
murder the passengers, and to commit with impunity all
sorts of disorder. By these crimes, it had become so
dangerous to walk the streets a-nights, that the citizens
dared no more to venture abroad after sun-set, than if
they were exposed to the incursions of a public enemy.
The brother of the earl of Ferrars had been murdered
by some of these nocturnal rioters; and the death of a
person of that noble birth, which was much more re∣garded
than that of many thousands of an inferior sta∣tion,
so provoked the King, that he swore vengeance
against the criminals, and became thenceforth much
more rigorous in the execution of the laws<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 196.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is another instance given by historians, which
proves to what a height such riots had proceeded, and
how open these criminals were in committing their rob∣beries.
A band of them had attacked the house of a
rich citizen, with an intention of plundering it; had
broke thro' a stone wall with hammers and wedges;
and had already entered the house sword in hand; when
the citizen, armed cap-a-pee and supported by his faith∣ful
servants, appeare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the passage to oppose them: He
cut off the right-hand of the first robber that entered;
and made such stout resistance, that his neighbours had
leisure to assemble, and come to his relief. The man,
who lost his hand, was caught; and was tempted by the
promise of pardon to reveal his confederates; among
whom was one John Senex, esteemed among the richest
and best born citizens of London. He was convicted
by the ordeal trial; and tho' he offered five hundred
marks for his life, the King refused the money, and
ordered him to be hanged<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 197, 198.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY's exactness in administring justice had gained
him so great reputation, that even foreign and distant
<PB N="500" REF="540"/>
princes made him an arbiter, and submitted their differen∣ces
to his judgment. Sanchez, King of Navarre, hav∣ing
some controversies with Alfonso, King of Castile,
was contented, tho' Alfonso had married the daughter
of Henry, to choose that prince for a referee; and they
agreed, each of them, to consign three castles into neu∣tral
hands, as a pledge of their not departing from his
award. Henry made the cause be examined before his
great council, and gave a sentence, which was willingly
submitted to by both parties. These two Spanish Kings
sent each a stout champion to the court of England, in
order to defend his cause by arms, in case the way of
duel had been chosen by Henry<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 43. Bened. Abb. p. 172. Diceto, p. 597. Brompton, p. 1120.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY so far abolished the barbarous and absurd
practice of forfeiting ships, which had been wrecked
on the coast, that if one man or animal was alive in the
ship, the vessel and goods were restored to the owners<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE reign of Henry was remarkable for an innova∣tion,
which was afterwards carried farther by his succes∣sors,
and was attended with the most important conse∣quences
to the government. This prince was disgusted
with the species of military force, which was established
by the feudal institutions, and which, tho' it was ex∣tremely
burdensome to the subject, yet rendered very
little service to the sovereign. The barons, or military tenants,
came late into the field; they were obliged
to serve only for forty days; they were unskilful and
disorderly in all their operations; and they were apt to
carry into the camp the same refractory and independent
spirit, to which they were accustomed in their civil go∣vernment.
Henry, therefore, introduced the practice of
<PB N="501" REF="542"/>
making a commutation of their military service for mo∣ney;
and he levied scutages from his baronies and knights
fees, instead of requiring the personal attendance of his
vassals. There is mention made, in the history of the ex∣chequer,
of these scutages in his second, fifth, and eighteenth
year<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Madox, p. 435, 436, 437, 438.</NOTE>; and other writers give us an account of three more
of them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. ii. p. 466. from the records.</NOTE>. When the prince had thus obtained money,
he made a contract with some of those adventurers, in
which Europe at that time abounded: They found him
soldiers of the same character with themselves, who were
bound to serve for a stipulated time: The armies were
much less numerous, but more useful, than when com∣posed
of all the military vassals of the crown: The feu∣dal
institutions began to relax: The Kings became rapa∣cious
for money, on which all their power depended:
The barons, seeing no end of exactions, sought to defend
their property: And as the same causes had nearly the
same effect, in the different countries of Europe, the se∣veral
crowns either lost or acquired authority, according
to their different success in this struggle.</P>
<P>THIS prince was also the first who levied a tax on
the moveables or personal estates of his subjects, nobles
as well as people. Their zeal for the holy wars made
them submit to this innovation; and a precedent being
once obtained, this taxation became, in following reigns,
the usual method of supplying the necessities of the crown.
The tax of Danegelt, so generally odious to the nation,
was remitted in this reign.</P>
<P>IT was an usual practice of the Kings of England,
to repeat the ceremony of their coronation thrice a-year,
on assembling the states at the three great festivals▪
Henry, after the first years of his reign, never renewed
this ceremony, which was found to be very expensive

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="501" REF="543"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="502" REF="544"/>
and very useless. None of his successors ever revived it.
It is deemed a great act of grace in this prince, that he
mitigated the rigour of the forest laws, and punished any
transgressions of them, not capitally, but by fines, im∣prisonments,
and other more moderate penalties.</P>
<P>SINCE we are here collecting some detached instances,
which show the genius of the age, and which could
not so well enter into the body of the history, it may not
be amiss to mention the quarrel between Roger archbishop
of York, and Richard archbishop of Canterbury. We
may judge of the violence of military men and laymen,
when ecclesiastics could proceed to such extremities.
Cardinal Haguezun being sent, in 1176, as legate into
Britain, summoned an assembly of the clergy at London;
and as both the archbishops pretended to sit on his right
hand, this question of precedency begot a controversy
between them. The monks and retainers of archbishop
Richard fell upon Roger, in the presence of the cardinal
and of the synod, threw him on the ground, trampled
him under foot, and so bruised him with blows, that he
was taken up half dead, and his life was, with difficulty,
saved from their violence. The archbishop of Canter∣bury
was obliged to give a large sum of money to the
legate, in order to suppress all complaints of this enor∣mity<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 138, 139. Brompton, p. 1109. Chron. Gerv. p. 1433. Neub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ig. p. 413.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS King left only two legitimate sons, Richard,
who succeeded him, and John, who inherited no terri∣tory,
tho' his father had often intended to leave him a
part of his extensive dominions. He was thence com∣monly
denominated <HI>Lackland.</HI> Henry left three legitimate
daughters; Maud, born in 1156, and married to Henry,
duke of Saxony; Eleanor, born in 1162, and married
<PB N="503" REF="545"/>
to Alphonso, King of Castile; Joan, born in 1165,
and married to William, King of Sicily<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 616.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY is said by antient historians to have been of a
very amorous disposition; and they mention two of his
natural sons by Rosamond, daughter of lord Clifford,
viz. Richard Longespée, or Longsword, (so called from
the sword he usually wore) who was afterwards married
to Ela, the daughter and heiress of the earl of Salisbury;
and Geoffrey, first bishop of Lincoln, and then archbishop
of York. All the other circumstances of the story com∣monly
told of that lady seem to be fabulous.</P>
