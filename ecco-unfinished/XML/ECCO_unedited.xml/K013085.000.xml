<P>IT has been the Wonder of all, who
entertain a particular Esteem for
the Ingenious Pieces of the Coun∣tess
<HI>D'Anois,</HI> That, after her Various
Rambles and Memoirs of the most cele∣brated
Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> she should be
so backward in obliging the World with
the Amorous Intrigues of the <HI>French
Court,</HI> where <HI>Gallantry</HI> seems to ride
Triumphant, and spread her Conquests
without controul. She has at last thought
fit to ease the Curious of part of their
Pain by the following Tract, which, as
it may, in all probability, be look'd up∣on
<PB REF="4"/>
as an Introduction to others of the
same kind (relating to that Court) so
I don't question, but the <HI>Reader,</HI> up∣on
the first perusal of it, will be con∣vinced,
that, in representing the Irre∣sistible
Power as well, as the Extrava∣gancies
of Love, in its natural Shape
and Dress without any additional Or∣naments,
she has in this Piece sur∣pass'd
every thing she has Publish'd be∣fore
of that nature.</P>

<HEAD>Secret Memoirs
OF
The Duke and Dutchess
OF
O—S.
WITH
The Amorous Intrigues and Ad∣ventures
of divers of the most
eminent Princes of the Court
of France.</HEAD>
<P>THE Marriage of his Royal
Highness the Duke of
<HI>O—s</HI> with the Princess of
<HI>England,</HI> Sister to King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. afforded a thousand fresh
Opportunities of Diversion to the
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
<HI>French</HI> Court; nothing was to be
seen there, but Entertainments, Hun∣ting
Matches, Balls, Opera's and Plays
to divert the Lords and Ladies of
that Court, at so agreeable a Con∣juncture;
but the God of Love, the
Great Conqueror of the Universe,
who makes every thing submit to
his Empire, casting his Eyes upon so
fair an Assembly, immediately laid a
design of making the Hearts of these
Gallant Persons sensible of the force
of his Darts. The Dutchess of—
as her ill Stars would have it, who
was not very fond of her Husband,
happened to be among the number of
those that were conquered by his
Arms, and soon knew her Conqueror.
This was the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> a Man
ambitious to the highest degree, the
Son of the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shal <HI>de Grammont,</HI> and
<HI>Maistre de Camp</HI> of the Regiment of
<HI>French</HI> Guards, who being one of the
King's Favourites, wanted not Vanity
to raise his Amorous Thoughts to
the highest Pitch, being so far entan∣gled
by her Charms, and extraordi∣nary
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
Merits, that he resolved to pur∣chase
her Favour at the Expence of
all his Fortune. The Count in the
very first beginning of his Passions
appearing one day at a Feast, the King
gave to the Ladies at <HI>Versailles,</HI> in a
very melancholy Air, the Dutchess,
with a very engaging Look; <HI>Ala<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Count</HI> (said she) <HI>pray tell me without
disguise, what grand Projects you are
framing at this time, which takes up all
your Thoughts, and makes you so penfive?</HI>
The Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> quite amazed at
his unexpected good Fortune, was so
far from being able to return an im∣mediate
Answer, that he was ready
to drop down at her Feet; however,
having recovered himself a little, he
made the Dutchess sensible, in a lan∣guishing
Tone, that he was touch'd
to the Heart beyond expression. The
Dutchess, who was of a tender Dispo∣sition,
and knew very well, that the
King's Addresses to her had afforded
no small Subject of Jealousie to the
Count, told him with a Smile; <HI>You
are very agreeable in Point of Love,
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
there are not many who can compare with
you, your Addresses will not fail to meet
with a grateful return.</HI> The Count was
going to return his humble Thanks to
the Princess, in the most submissive
and passionate Terms that could be,
when our Great Monarch drawing
near, follow'd her close into a Closet,
where she was seeking for a litle Re∣tirement.
Seating himself by her,
the Count, who was got behind the
Tapestry, had the Mortification to be
an Ear-witness of the Addresses the
King made to her. The Dutchess,
who knew that the Count was in a
Corner behind the Tapestry, vex'd at
the King's Presence with Eyes spark∣ling
with Anger, entertain'd his Pas∣sion
with Raillery; which made his
Majesty tell her with a Serious Air, he
could not imagine what could move
her to turn his Sufferings into Ridi∣cule.
<HI>Sir,</HI> (reply'd she with a low
Voice, but not without Laughing
more heartily than before) <HI>I have per∣haps
some Reasons to my self not to re∣ceive
your Addresses without Ʋnquiet∣ness.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
That Prince who hitherto had
thought he had nothing to fear, ari∣sing
from his Seat, drew his Sword,
and began to search every Corner of
the room, while the Princess trembling
with fear, made a sign to the Count,
to get away as fast as he could, to a∣void
falling into the King's Hands: He
was no sooner gone, but bursting out
a Laughing, <HI>Sir,</HI> cry'd she, <HI>I believe
you are drawing your Sword against
Shades and Spectres; What makes your
Majesty to be in such a Rage? You see
we are alone, nothing in the World di∣sturbs
us. Madam,</HI> (reply'd the King,
with a loud Voice;) <HI>Ʋnless I am
strangely mistaken, I saw somebody be∣hind
these Tapestries, who, I fear, might
partake of the Secrets of my Heart. O!
what is it you fear,</HI> said the Dutchess
Blushing; <HI>when nothing can disturb you
here. I am sensible of that, Madam,</HI> said
that Prince, casting a tender Look at
her, <HI>yet should I be ready to run distra∣cted,
if any body had overheard me; for
Love being a nice Passion, I should lose
one half of my Pleasure; Secresy en∣creases
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
the Charms of Love, and 'tis in
her we must search for our true Satisfa∣ction.
I can't deny it to be so,</HI> said the
Dutchess somewhat Discomposed,
<HI>without the aid of Secresy, Tenderness
is not very agreeable nor durable.</HI> One
of her Ladies coming in at the same
time to tell her, that the Duke of
<HI>O—s</HI> was a coming, they rejoyn'd
the rest of the Company, and the King
appearing somewhat disturbed, pass'd
part of his time in reading a Book.
The next day following the King gave
a Ball, where all the Ladies appear'd
in their utmost Lustre, and the Dutch∣ess
of—in particular surpass'd all
the rest in her engaging Deportment.
The Duke of <HI>O—s,</HI> who had for some
time past look'd upon the Countess of
<HI>Olone</HI> as the most Aimable Person of
the Court, entertain'd her that Even∣ing
with his Sighs and a thousand o∣bliging
Expressions, to the no small
Mortification of Madam <HI>Montespan,</HI>
who had flatter'd her self with the
hopes of making that Prince her
Conquest; but now seeing him to
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
make his Addresses to her, she was rea∣dy
to burst with spite and envy a∣gainst
her Rival. That Prince un∣willing
to act the Arbitrator betwixt
them, withdrew for some time, and
being a great Admirer of strange Ad∣ventures
and Stories, he soon after
gave them a long Relation of the <HI>Em∣peror
of the Sun,</HI> a Title assumed by a
certain pretended famous Astrologer,
reported to be come lately from the
<HI>East</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> to exercise his admira∣ble
Art in <HI>France.</HI> The Prince of
<HI>Conde,▪</HI> whom the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> had
made his Confident in this Matter,
told them such surprizing Things of
this Great Astrologer, that the whole
Company began to shew an Inclinati∣on
of visiting him, each in particular,
to learn from him their good or ill
Fortune, except Madam <HI>de Olone,</HI>
who hated all sorts of Conjurers, be∣cause
she dreaded the Discovery of
her Amorous Intrigues told the
Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> with a scornful Air,
<HI>Alas! what is such an unhappy Wretch∣able
to tell of those that submit themselves
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
to Providence? If he can say any thing
to the purpose he must deal with the De∣vil!
O! Madam,</HI> return'd the Prince,
<HI>this stupendious Mortal erects the Horo∣scope
of the whole World, nothing can
be conceal'd from him, as well of what
is past as what is to come. Then I will
take care,</HI> said she to the Duke of
<HI>Candalle,</HI> who stood hard by, <HI>how I
come near this</HI> Emperor of the Sun,
<HI>who dives thus far into the Secrets of all
the World. No, Madam,</HI> reply'd the
Duke with a pleasant Air, <HI>you must
go and see him, as well as the other La∣dies,
this surprizing Astrologer will per∣haps
tell you such things as will highly
please you. Sir,</HI> return'd the Countess
with a grave Air, <HI>People are seldom
fond of being told of their Follies and
Misfortunes, such as these Wretches com∣monly
speak off. Who has made you be∣lieve,
Madam,</HI> reply'd the Duke of
<HI>Candalle</HI> briskly, <HI>that you shall be Ʋn∣fortunate?
Ladies so handsom as you,
have, most commonly, Fortune at their
own Disposal, and sail with a fair Gale
upon the Ocean of Felicity. Well, we will
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
put it to the Tryal,</HI> said she, interrupt∣ing
the Duke, and so went out of the
Room. The Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> hap∣pening
to meet her alone in a very
pensive posture, in one of the Galle∣ries,
whisper'd her in the Ear, <HI>Fair
Hermit, afford me a share in your soli∣tary
Thoughts, and give me a place in
your Heart, for as long a time as you
have taken up in mine; What is it that
could engage you, to leave so agreeable
an Assembly to abandon your self to your
Melancholy Thoughts? I can't well tell
you,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>de Olone</HI> careless,
<HI>I am sometimes disturbed at any
Company,</HI> added she sighing; <HI>All their
Discou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se this Evening at Court runs
upon a certain Conjurer, who coming
from the</HI> Country of the Sun, <HI>can by
one's Physiognomy disclose all our most
hidden Thoughts, and determine our
Destinies, as if he were beyond a Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al
Man.</HI> A certain Astrologer, said the
Count by way of Criticism, <HI>don't you
know that the first of these Words is sure
and infallible, but the second is very un∣certain.
I little trouble my head,</HI> reply'd
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
the Countess with much indifferency,
<HI>about the signification of Words, I will
only tell you, Sir,</HI> continu'd this Fair
Lady h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf angry, <HI>that I mortally hate all
these Animals call'd</HI> Astrologers, <HI>who
build Castles in the Air, and pull them
down again at pleasure. And I,</HI> reply'd
the Count coldly, <HI>love them dearly,
because they sometimes disclose to us our
Happiness: As for instance, if this God∣like
Man should tell me that I was be∣lov'd
by you, what a Satisfaction, what
a Joy would not that be to me? How,
Sir,</HI> reply'd the Countess, <HI>can't you
rest contented with the Favours of the
most Lovely Lady in the World, with∣out
envying another Man's Happiness,
and betraying your Infidelity?</HI> The
Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> finding himself alone
with Madam <HI>de Olone,</HI> whom at that
very instant he thought as handsom
as an Angel by the Light of the Moon,
instead of answering was going to
embrace her, but she disengaging her
self out of his Arms, told him, <HI>Pray
answer me immediately, Do you always
improve the first Opportunity? What
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
would you have me tell you, O Incom∣parable
Lady,</HI> cry'd he with a most Pas∣sionate
Air, <HI>Love tyrannises over me
on all sides. But tell me, Inconstant Man,</HI>
continued the Countess with a Smile,
<HI>have not you, on your Knees, made a thou∣sand
Vows to the Dutchess of—to
Love her as long as you live, and to let
no body else have a share in your Tender∣ness?
No, Madam,</HI> said the Count
with a Blush, <HI>I am not so far advanced
as you imagine. Ah! simple Man,</HI> cry'd
the Countess bursting out a Laughing,
<HI>he be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rays himself, are not those Perfi∣dious
Oaths, whereby you treacherous
Men triumph over our Liberty, the first
step made by Lovers? Let us leave that
Cause, Madam,</HI> reply'd the Count, <HI>the
very Walls have Ears here; besides that,
this Lady is soon tired with an old Lo∣ver,
and it is above a Year since I have
made my Addresses to her, which me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with no favourable Reception. Sir, you
are a Man of Honour,</HI> said the Coun∣tess
with a malicious Smile, <HI>your Dis∣cretion
deserves to be rewarded by the
Ladies, who can't bestow their Favours
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
upon a more deserving Person than you.
Then let me have some share in yours,</HI> re∣ply'd
the Count transported with
Passion, and kissing her Hands, <HI>Per∣mit
me, Madam,</HI> said he, <HI>to Love you,
and to tell you, that I do so, if you
intend to make me happy. Alas! Dear</HI>
Count, return'd Madam <HI>de Olone,</HI> with
a languishing Air, <HI>let us not talk of
Loving, I tremble at the very Name of
Love, being sensible how dearly I have
paid for it, and what—And so
do I,</HI> said the Duke <HI>de Candalles,</HI> in∣terrupting
them (having left the Room
where they Danced, on purpose to see
what was become of her) <HI>I thought it
could be no less than a Nocturnal Assig∣nation,
that robb'd us of your Company;
a very fine piece indeed, for a Vertuous
Lady,</HI> continued he, <HI>to be catch'd sin∣gled
from the Company with so discreet
a Person that never brags of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adies
Favours. But after all, unless you have
a mind to be seen also by others, your
best way is, to chuse a more solitary
place, such a one as may be more suita∣ble
to your present Intentions. Ʋnfor∣tunate
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
Woman as I am,</HI> cry'd the Coun∣tess
in a Surprize, <HI>I know not what se∣cret
Sentiments foreboded to me your
unjust Jealousie, 'twas no more than an
accidental Meeting, you make such a
noise about: Great God, how unfortu∣nate
am I, to meet with nothing but what
are my Enemies, where ever I come!</HI>
And so leaving the Duke and Count
together in the Gallery, went into
the Queen's Apartment, who ask'd
her where she had been. <HI>I have been,</HI>
said she to her Majesty, with a most
respectful Air, <HI>in one of the Galleries,
to take a little fresh Air;</HI> and the Queen,
who was one of the best natur'd Prin∣cesses
in the World, made no fa: ther
enquiry into the Matter. The two
Gentlemen, having given one another
an account of their Adventures, laugh∣ed
at the oddness of the thing, and so
parted.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> soon re-assu∣ming
his wonted serious Air and Sighs,
placed himself behind the Dutchess
of—Chair, and she who had not
seen him since he was forced to get
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
away out of the Closet for fear of the
King, soon perceiving him, and turn∣ing
her self towards him with an En∣gaging
Air, <HI>Where have you been Count,</HI>
said she, <HI>'tis some Years since I have not
seen you. Madam,</HI> reply'd the Count
<HI>de Guiche</HI> with a profound respect, <HI>I
was afraid of being too troublesome. A
weak reason indeed,</HI> return'd the Dutch∣ess
of—<HI>Come, tell me without
dissembling the Matter, What is it that
has fix'd these doleful melancholy Sym∣ptoms
in your Eyes and Countenance?</HI>
The King happening to enter the
Room at the same time, their Dis∣course
and the whole Company broke
off at the same time, and their Royal
Highnesses return'd to the <HI>Palace
Royal.</HI></P>
<P>However, the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> per∣sisting
in his Resolutions of acting the
Astrologer at Court, told the Prince
of <HI>Conde,</HI> who was to introduce him,
that his Feminine Voice and Air would
serve him in good stead, to pursue
his design of erecting the Horoscope
of some Ladies, but that he was at a
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
stand how to disguise his Face. <HI>Don't
trouble your self upon that Score, Dear
Cousin,</HI> said the Prince Laughing, <HI>do
you your best, and leave the rest to
Chance.</HI> The Duke approved of the
Prince's Advice with a Smile, and so
they went the same Day to St. <HI>Clou,</HI>
where his Highness had prepared a
magnificent Feast, with all manner of
Diversions for the Entertainment of
the Court. Night being come, and
our pretended Astrologer having e∣very
thing in readiness for his Dis∣guise,
told the Company, That being
troubled with the Head-ach, he would
take an Hour or two's rest; and he
being then in an ill Humour, every
Body was glad to see him gone. He
was no sooner gone into an adjacent
room, but he put on his Disguising
Apparel, being a large Robe of Blue
Cloath embroidered with Suns, Moons
and Stars, and a Turbant of various
Colours upon his Head, with a long
reddish curl'd Beard and a Glass Eye
that cover'd all the remaining part
of his Face, attended by the Duke of
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
<HI>Longueville,</HI> who was no less disguised
than himself: He wore a Gown and
Vest of a Violet Colour, with great
hanging Sleeves, after the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fa∣shion;
a large Pearl fastned to the tip
of his Nose, and he had false Ears as
long as those of King <HI>Midas,</HI> and in
his Hands a small Box containing Re∣medies
against all Distempers. In this
Equipage the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> entred the
Appartment where the Lords and La∣dies
were, and no sooner did the
Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> get sight of the <HI>Em∣peror
of the Sun,</HI> but he cry'd, the <HI>God
of Light</HI> is appearing, and rising to
meet him, conducted him to an El∣bow-Chair,
brought in for that pur∣pose.
Never was any Surprize like
this, the whole Court gazing upon
one another, without saying one
word, and the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> casting
his most furious and daring Looks on
all sides, muttered several unintelligi∣ble
Words, sometimes lifting up a lit∣tle
his Glass Eye, and making many
fantastical Signs with his Fingers The
Dutchess of—not a little fright∣ed
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
at this sight, ask'd the Prince of
<HI>Conde,</HI> whether this Astrologer could
speak <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French? Yes, yes,
Madam,</HI> answer'd the Necromancer,
making many wry Faces, <HI>I am suffi∣ciently
acquainted with your Destiny,
to let you know what you are desirous to
be satisfy'd in. I should be very glad
to hear that, Sir,</HI> said the Princess, <HI>is
it possible you should be able to dive into
the secret Destinies of Men? Very Well,
Madam,</HI> reply'd the Dukeof <HI>O—s</HI> in a
mild Tone, <HI>I foretold</HI> Charles I. <HI>King
of</HI> England, <HI>all his Misfortunes. Then
you have been at</HI> London, reply'd the
Dutchess of—much surpriz'd,
<HI>How Old pray were you when you fore∣told
this Prince his Misfortune? Alas!
why would not you put him in the way
to avoid them? You ask me, Madam,
if I have been at</HI> London, reply'd the
Astrologer in a feign'd Surprize, <HI>me,
who am able to run the whole Circuit of
the Earth in a Minute, and what Age
I am off? A fine Question indeed to an</HI>
Emperor of the Sun, <HI>whose Subjects
continue for ever in the same state of
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
Youth; I was then of the same Age,</HI>
continu'd he, turning his Glass Eye
on both sides, <HI>I am now in. How,
Sir,</HI> said the Dutchess of—
Laughing, <HI>are you not subject to Age
and its Infirmities, which puts an end
to even the most accomplish'd things in
this World. Madam,</HI> said the Duke of
<HI>O—s</HI> with an Austere Voice, <HI>I am
forbidden by the Stars, to enlarge my
self upon this Point, as well as to go
about to prevent those Evils mortal Men
are threatned with by the Planets.</HI>
Charles I. <HI>has fulfill'd the Scheme of
his Destiny, as other Mortals do, its
Decrees being irrevocable, and directed
by Providence. And Sir,</HI> reply'd the
Dutchess of—sighing, <HI>can you
cast my Nativity, by the permission of the
Stars? I promise you, I will, Madam,</HI>
answer'd the disguised Duke with his
Eyes fix'd on the Ground, <HI>but it must
be done without Witnesses, and you must
put an entire Confidence in my Predicti∣ons.
Supposing they should be fatal, Sir,</HI>
reply'd the Dutchess of—with
a melancholy Air, <HI>must I give absolute
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
Credit to them? But be it as it will,</HI>
continued she, <HI>I will take Courage and
lead the way.</HI> The Astrologer then be∣ing
conducted into a Closet, where
several Lights were burning, the
Dutchess of—follow'd him
thither alone, not doubting but that
she might trust her Person without
the least hazard, with a Person of so
advanced an Age. The first thing the
Necromancer did, was to examine her
Physiognomy; which done, he told
her with a mild Air, <HI>Charming Lady,
'tis not surprizing to see you dispute with
the Angels themselves for the Beauties
both of Mind and Body; when I consi∣der
with what a benign Influence the
Planets have blest your Nativity;</HI> Ve∣nus
<HI>being in Conjunction with</HI> Sol, <HI>who
is the Source of Light, has infused into
you his most precious and rarest Gifts;
and the</HI> Moon, <HI>which is predominant
over the Passions of Women, is check'd
by</HI> Jupiter <HI>and</HI> Mars, <HI>who—Alas!
Sir,</HI> said the Dutchess of—in∣terrupting
him, <HI>pray speak to me in a
more intelligible Language, that I may
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
be able to understand you, let us not
trouble our selves with the Stars, but
with the good and ill Accidents of my
Life; with those Passions that exercise
their Dominion over the Hearts of
Mankind. I must rightly examine your
Constitution, which to all appearance is
endued with all the Qualities requisite to
render your Health compleat, and your
Inclination very good. The Eyes, as a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertain Great Author observes, are the
Lookinglass of the Soul, for which rea∣son,
Nature has thought fit to place them
in the uppermost part of Creatures, to
serve as faithful Interpreters of what
is in our Hearts. Most common∣ly
Women that have Blue and Lan∣guishing
Eyes, such as yours, have a∣bundance
of Wit and Good Nature, and
also much Tenderness, and are scarce
proof against the great Qualifications
and Merits of a Lover. Fair and
curl'd Hairs, are a sign that their In∣clinations
are Vertuous and for good
Actions: A Fair and Vermillion Com∣plexion,
is the Herald who proclaims all
the Indications of a perfect good Tem∣perature,
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
and who animates our Vital
Spirits by a sufficient share of Natural
Heat. The Prince of Philosophers, as
well as all the Physiognomists agree in
this, That a round Nose discovers a
certain Inclination to Pleasures and hu∣man
Tenderness. O! my most Admi∣rable
and and almost Divine Man,</HI> cry'd
the Dutchess of—interrupting
him, <HI>is it in your Power to tell me
something concerning the true state of
my Heart? Yes, Madam,</HI> reply'd he,
drawing his Glass-Eye a little on
one side, <HI>you are prepossess'd with a
strong Passion for a certain Gentleman,
which makes you not to be very fond of
that Spouse Heaven has bestow'd upon
you; but if you continue so to do, I fore∣see
by the Stars, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fatality that will
attend both you and him who adores
you. 'Tis enough, Sir,</HI> said the Dutchess
of—, and so went out of the
Closet, fearing least he should tell her
more than she was willing to hear,
and returning to the Apartment
where the Company was told them,
not without some disturbance, <HI>O!
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
what a skilful Necromancer! This stu∣pendious
Man very well deserves the In∣censes
offer'd him by all the World; he
no sooner saw me, but knew part of my
Inclinations; but what is more surpri∣zing,
and even beyond what is well to
be imagined, he knows the very Secrets
of our Hearts, and dives into our most
hidden Recesses, without the least diffi∣culty.</HI></P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who had
been always very eager to have his
Fortune told him, but more especi∣ally
since his Passion for the Dutch∣ess
of—little thinking that the
Duke acted that Part, would needs
be the next who should make tryal
of this Astrologer's Skill. At the
very first sight of him, he, with a
fierce Countenance, <HI>What is thy Busi∣ness
here, poor Mortal,</HI> said he, <HI>thy
Air discovers thy Vanity, and thy large,
black and lascivious Eyes, that thou art
a very passionate Lover of handsom Wo∣men,
but thou art inconstant, fickle, and
without any real Passion for thy Friends.</HI>
Venus <HI>and</HI> Mars <HI>stood in Conjunction
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
at the time of thy Nativity, which af∣fords
thee some small share of Bravery,
but I observe in thy Physiognomy, I know
not what—What you dare not
name, Sir,</HI> said the Count full of im∣patience,
<HI>but go on to erect my Horo∣scope
by the permission of the Stars
…. Thou wilt perhaps not
be pleased with it,</HI> said the Astrologer,
with a grave Look stamping on the
Ground, and making a Circle on the
Floor; <HI>Yes, yes, I shall,</HI> reply'd the
Count abruptly, <HI>your Sentences are no
Oracles, a Man is bound to receive
without reserve; there is a Superior
Power that governs our Fortunes; Know
then, ambitious Man,</HI> added the A∣strologer
with a scornful Air, <HI>that I
am</HI> Emperor <HI>of that Deity, which de∣termines
the Fate of Men, and the
Stars tell me, thou art threaten'd with
a great Danger, unless thou abandonest
that Beauty thou addresses. And who is
that Charming Lady,</HI> reply'd the Count
<HI>de Guiche</HI> much disturb'd, <HI>whom I a∣dore
without knowing it? 'Tis the
Dutchess of—</HI> said the Astro∣loger
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
smiling, <HI>reflect well upon thy past
Conduct in that regard, and thou wilt
be sensible of the Certainty of my Art.
But dread my Son, dread the direful
Consequences of so dangerous an Engage∣ment,
which will prove the Ruine of
thy Fortune.</HI> The Duke of <HI>O—s</HI>
was ready to burst with Laughing un∣der
his long red Beard, to have put
the Count in such a Fright, for he
had no kindness for him, because he
would always be at the Dutchesses
Elbow, so he turn'd his Back to him,
as if he had no more to say to him,
but in effect, for fear of being dis∣covered
sooner than he designed.
The Count went out of the Closet
very much dissatisfy'd, and as pale
as if he had been at the last Gasp,
and returning to the Ladies, told
them, That <HI>if all the Astrologers were
as impudent as this Fellow, they would
have but few Customers. This famous
Necromancer has told me abundance of
Stories, which I look upon no otherwise
than Phantasms; the old Fool, as far
as I can see, hates Men like Monsters,
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
but Women are his Angels. Thou craf∣ty
Magician,</HI> continued the Count,
biting his Lips, <HI>thou shouldest have
some Female Minions to play withal.
Pray what has he told you, Sir,</HI> cry'd
Madam <HI>d' Olone, what is it that vexes
you, you are like one in a Trance, and
as much dejected as the</HI> Hugenot. <HI>He
has told me, Madam,</HI> reply'd the
Count very much disturb'd, <HI>a thou∣sand
things, which he put what Inter∣pretation
he thought fit upon, on pur∣pose
to vex me, being inform'd of them
beforehand. I am heartily glad of it,</HI>
reply'd the Countess Laughing, <HI>I will
for once set aside my aversion to Conju∣rers,
and hear what marvelous things
this incomparable Man will tell me.
Madam,</HI> return'd the Count merrily,
<HI>have a care he does not rob you of some
Favour, this</HI> Fiery Favourite of the
Sun, <HI>has Eyes as Lascivious as a Satyr.
What is it he can rob me of,</HI> reply'd the
Countess coldly, <HI>I have no Jewels a∣bout
me, and he has besides this but one
Ey<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not so much of sigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in those Amorous Robber<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that are

committed upon such fair Ladies as you,
because you know Love is blind. NO,
Count, I fear it not,</HI> answered Madam
<HI>d' Olone</HI> briskly, <HI>you have only a mind
to frighten me, I dare follow the Dutch∣ess
of—Footsteps. Do, do,
my Dear,</HI> said the Dutchess, <HI>with a
malicious Smile</HI> (being willing the
other Ladies, as well as her self,
should take their share in the Predi∣ctions
of the <HI>Emperor of the Sun) he
is the most knowing and honestest Man
I ever heard speak, and he will tell what
will surprize you.</HI> The Countess thus
encouraged, went strait into the Con∣jurers
Closet, by whom she was re∣ceived
in a most obliging manner▪
<HI>Draw near my Angel,</HI> said he, taking
her by the hand, <HI>hear what the Star<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
Astrologer, <HI>if you love Pleasure to
an excess, and if you are not very con∣stant
in Love, and impose upon your
Lovers one after another, as well as up∣on
your Husband, for when you provide
a Crest of Horns perhaps s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rely against
his Will. Those that have round Faces,
says</HI> Plato, <HI>in his Book of</HI> Physiogno∣my,
<HI>are ingenious: Whence it is—
What makes you amuse me with such like
Discourses? Sir,</HI> said the Countess
interrupting him, <HI>they are Riddles to
me. How, Madam,</HI> reply'd the Astro∣loger,
arising from his Seat, <HI>are you
not sensible of what I tell you? Good
Heavens, is it not very true, that you
have a great number of Persons whom
you Love for different Reasons, without
any regard to their Condition or Quali∣ty,
provided—you know what I
mean. But after all, a very handsome
Prince is in Love with you, beyond
what you can imagine, and</HI> Jupiter <HI>in
Conjunction with</HI> Venus <HI>takes care of
your Fortune by his favourable Aspects,
if you can make good use of these be∣nign
Influences the Stars pour out upon

you. I find, Sir,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>d'
Olone,</HI> looking stedfastly on him, <HI>you
are all Life and Spirit; but pray tell
me, if the Stars will give you leave,
who is that Prince that loves me, whose
Passion I am ignorant of hitherto. You
to be ignorant of it, Madam,</HI> return'd
the Astrologer with a Smile, <HI>Ha!
ha! Come, come, don't act the Dissem∣bler,
why so much of Dissimulation?
Most Charming Dear Man,</HI> said the
Countess, <HI>let me not languish any longer
in suspence. Well then,</HI> reply'd th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Astrologer in a Serious Tone, <HI>'tis th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Duke of</HI> O—s, <HI>that aimable</HI> Adoni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear me, he is no Lover of Women
Alas! he,</HI> said the Countess Laugh∣ing
aloud, <HI>would take care not to ent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
too far into an Intrigue with a Mistress▪
And what then is it, my Dear,</HI> reply'd
he interrupting her, <HI>this Prince loves
since he is not fond of Women, who ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Goddesses of the Earth, and the D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣light
of Men, for whom they were mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by Nature. His Inclinations,</HI> answer'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>
the Lady Smiling, <HI>are for his own kind,
and are for gay Colours and Ribbons▪
Hah! who has prepossess'd you with such
Notions, Madam,</HI> reply'd the Duke
of <HI>O—s</HI> interrupting her, and en∣deavouring
to kiss her, pull'd of his
Mask, telling her at the same time, he
would improve this Critical Minute.
The Countess astonish'd to meet with
him under the Disguise of an Astro∣loger,
unto whom she had reveal'd
her most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thoughts, set up
such a dreadful Cry, that some of the
Court scaring no less than that the
Necromancer was going to Ravish
her, ran to her Assistance; But gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss
at their Surprize when they saw the
Duke of <HI>O—s,</HI> and the Duke of
<HI>Longueville,</HI> who had served him for
a Companion, throwing aside their
long Robes, and Laughing at the
Folly of those they had so well im∣posed
upon. As for the Dutchess of
—whom he had entertain'd
very obligingly, she had no great
reason of Complaint; but the Count
<HI>de Guiche</HI> and Madam <HI>d' Olone,</HI> being
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
exposed to the daily Jests of their
Acquaintance, unto whom this Astro∣loger
unfolded all that was pass'd,
were vex'd to the Heart at this un∣lucky
Adventure. Some Days were
spent in Indifference betwixt the
Duke and the Countess, till he, who
could not hate her, notwithstanding
all the Hardships she had told him,
gave her a Visit, and she appearing
at that time more Beautiful than ever
in his Eyes, in a certain green loose
Gown, asked her Pardon for what he
had made her suffer during their A∣strological
Conversation: But Ma∣dam
<HI>d' Olone,</HI> who had a natural A∣version
to Lovers of the Duke's Kid∣ney,
would not come to an Accom∣modation,
tho he was not sparing o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his Oaths, to Love her as long as he
liv'd. <HI>How can a Woman,</HI> said she i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
an angry Tone, <HI>rely upon your Promi∣ses,
Sir, after having been treated by
you in such a manner as I have been<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
No, no,</HI> added the Lady, <HI>all Men are
Perfidious and Deceitful. If you knew,
Madam,</HI> reply'd the Duke Laughing
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>
<HI>how much Pleasure I had in thus put∣ting
upon you, you would not be so an∣gry
as you are; because by this means I
have made my self Master of some of
your Secrets; but with all the Art I
had, could not learn, whether your In∣clinations
were for me. Who I,</HI> cry'd
the Countess seemingly angry, <HI>I, my
Heart is unworthy your Conquest, and
you once more put me to the Tryal for
your Diversion. And do you believe
in good earnest,</HI> reply'd the Duke,
<HI>that my Passion for you is a Deceit, and
that I am not for entring into a sincere
Engagement with a Fair Lady? No, no,
I can't believe it,</HI> said the Countess
Laughing aloud, <HI>I have it from very
good hands, that your Inclinations are
more for what I dare not name, and
for Dressing, than for an Assignation.
Is it possible, you worst of Women,</HI> re∣turn'd
the Duke with a disdainful
Air, <HI>you should entertain such odious
Thoughts of me? You lay to my Charge
a thing unknown to me, and after all,
refused me the same Favours you bestow
every Day upon the meanest of your Gal∣lants.
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
I am no longer able to endure
such provoking Words,</HI> reply'd Madam
<HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Olone,</HI> making towards the Door,
<HI>I am surpriz'd, that a Person who pre∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds
to Gal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntry, should thus affront
a Woman; Adi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, I am gone. Whi∣ther
will you go, Cruel Woman?</HI> cry'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Duke taking hold of her Gown
and shutting the Door, <HI>I am resolved
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my self of all the Indignities
you have offered me, and to make you
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Interest for the whole.</HI> The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who observed the Duke
to be in a great ferment, either with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Anger, was afraid she should
be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to grant him something,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> her self rid of her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for he went away without say∣ing
one word more, to the no small
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urprize of the Lady, who used not
to part with a Lover at so easie a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The want of respect and ten∣derness
she had observed in that Duke
for her Person, put her into a very
ill Humour, and made her conceive
a real hatred to him. In this Dispo∣sition
was the Countess, when the
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
Duke <HI>de Candalle,</HI> who retain'd still
in fresh remembrance the Nocturnal
Assignation he supposed she had gi∣ven
to the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> at <HI>Versail∣les,</HI>
came to reproach her with Infi∣delity;
but she resolving to prevent
him, cry'd whilst yet at a distance,
<HI>How dare you come here, Sir, after ha∣ving
entertain'd such Thoughts of me?
Away, away, I am resolved never to see
you again for my own repose. What
signifies it, Madam,</HI> said the Duke
sighing, <HI>to fall out with the Person one
Loves? Were you guilty of the highest
Crime in the World, you would always
meet with a favourable Construction i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
my Heart; nothing being able to effa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
the Impression you have made there,
You still continue in the same mistake,
Sir,</HI> reply'd the Countess, <HI>and I find
you can't free your self from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> O∣pinion
you have conceived of me, let me
say what I will to shew you my Innocence
and Constancy ….</HI> These
Words being immediately succeeded
by a Torrent of Tears, stop'd her
Speech; and the Duke who was ve∣ry
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
tender hearted, being unable to
resist the Charms of a Person he so
passionately loved, threw himself at
her Feet, embraced them, and told
her with much Passion, That Love
and Jealousie are inseparable Compa∣nions,
and that true Love can ad∣mit
of no Partnership. <HI>Alas, Sir,</HI>
reply'd she, <HI>don't crack my Brains
with such like premeditated Discourses,
wherewith you think to ensnare me; no,
I am resolved to throw off your Fet∣ters,
and will never pardon that signal
Affront you put upon me before the Count</HI>
de Guiche, <HI>who must certainly take me
for a strange Creature. Madam, be not
disturbed,</HI> said the Duke, endeavour∣ing
to embrace her, <HI>I took care to ex∣plain
the matter to him, and my Anger
was of no long continuance. How im∣portunate
you are,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>d'
Olone,</HI> with much Indifferency, <HI>let me
alone, withdraw from hence, and bid
me farewel for ever. How, Cruel Ʋn∣grateful
Woman,</HI> said our dissatisfy'd
Lover interrupting her, and pretend∣ing
to be much more concern'd than
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
actually he was, <HI>will you reduce me to
Despair, and not afford me your Par∣don!
I am ready to expiate my Fault
before your Eyes, in spite of all you can
do.</HI> He had no sooner said those
Words, but drawing his Sword with
much eagerness, he was going to
thrust the Point into his Bosom;
but alas! Who is able to express the
real Sentiments of the Countess at
the sight of so violent and so fatal a
Resolution, she cast her self betwixt
her Lover's Sword and Body, she
Kiss'd, she Caress'd him; and at last,
getting the Sword out of his Hands,
remonstrated to him the heinousness
of the Sin he intended to commit, in
making attempt upon his own Life.
The Duke, who was well acquainted
with the Accomplishments of Gallan∣try,
and knew all the Roads leading
to the Empire of Love, was much
pleased with himself, for having so
well succeeded in his design of find∣ing
out the Endearments of his Mi∣stress,
and to act his Part to the ut∣most
perfection, pretended not to
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
hearken to her Councils, but to per∣sist
in his former Resolution. Ma∣dam
<HI>d' Olone</HI> opposed him with all
her might, crying to him, <HI>My Dear,
I pardon you a thousand times, whate∣ver
you have committed against me;
Preserve a Life that is so precious to
me, let us enjoy the Fruits rather of
a delightful Peace, than see the dread
of a terrible Death, which would rob us
for ever of the Charms and Delights
that attend Lovers: Alas!</HI> continu∣ed
the Countess casting a tender
glance at him, and squeezing his
Hands, <HI>the very Idea of what you was
going about, has something very dread∣ful
and melancholy in it. Then, Ma∣dam,</HI>
reply'd the Duke, like one ama∣zed
and recovered out of a Swoon,
<HI>you would have me live, to love you the
longer, and to be yours more than ever?
Yes, my Dear Duke,</HI> reply'd she, ha∣ving
her Arms about his Neck, <HI>let
us Love for ever, let no Quarrels di∣sturb
our Love for the future, Dissenti∣ons
betwixt Lovers do not relish with
me, a pleasing Ʋnion has much more
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
Charms and Delights. I can't deny it,
my Incomparable Lady,</HI> said the Duke
<HI>de Candalle</HI> with a more contented
Air, <HI>nevertheless it seems almost im∣possible,
but that a certain mixture of
Jealousie and Fear of losing the only
Object of our desires will intervene,
when we least think of it. It seems as
if Love were attended by certain Vexa∣tions
and Mischiefs which are unavoid∣able,
like all things in this World have
their allays of bitterness, which almost
reduce us to Despair, and bring us to
the brink of Ruine.</HI> The Countess by
this time seeing her Gallant recover∣ed
from his Tragical Resolution,
told him with a Smile, <HI>Pray Sir, tell
me sincerely, were you actually resolved
to die, or was it only a feign'd design
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o frighten and to draw a sincere Con∣fession
from me? My Resolution was
for the first, my Dear,</HI> said the Duke,
acting the sincere part to the Life,
<HI>since you refused either to see or to hear
me: What pleasure do you think, Ma∣dam,
can a Man possess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with a strong
Passion find in the World, after being
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
banish'd his Mistresses Thoughts and
Presence? For my part I think there is
no pain comparable to this, and there∣fore
nothing but Sword or Dagger can
deliver us from such insupportable Tor∣ments.
As far as I can see, Duke,</HI> re∣ply'd
the Countess Laughing aloud,
<HI>you love like the Heroes in the Roman∣ces,
that is to say, you would share the
same fate with the Ʋnfortunate</HI> Pyra∣mus,
<HI>who kill'd himself, unless some
charitable</HI> Thysbe, <HI>stops your Hand;
and who could see a Lover in such a
furious Resolution, without opposing his
Violence? But without jesting, I am
apt to believe, you acted the dead, ra∣ther
the dying Man only in your ima∣gination,
as a certain Lover did, re∣presented
in a Picture on the top of a
Mountain, with a pale Countenance in
a languishing Condition, with the point
of his Dagger towards his Breast, be∣cause
his Mistress would see him no more
than twice a Day, and had refused him
certain Flowers she had wore in her
Bosom.</HI> The Duke, whose Pain and
Trouble was only in outward ap∣pearance,
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
could not forbear Laugh∣ing
outright, to see how naturally he
had acted his part, whereat the
Countess was so displeased, that she
told him with an Air full of Anger
and Indifferency, <HI>Sir, you think per∣haps
I don't discern your Deportment,
for a Person who pretends to make me
sensible, that he owes me ….</HI>
The Duke perceiving his charming
Mistress discontented, thought fit to
give her no further cause of Vexati∣on,
but on a sudden turning his
Mirth into Sighs and Complaints,
threw himself at her Feet, conjuring
her by all the most tender Expressi∣ons
that could be, to Love him for
ever, and not to be disquieted at
these insignificant Trifles, which
Love, (who is a Child for ever) puts
upon even the most reserved of his
Subjects. The Countess overcome
by the Arguments of her Lover made
him sensible by an engaging Smile,
that a Woman has but little strength
to resist the Tenderness of him she
Loves, and that her natural Inclina∣tions
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
prompt her to pardon in him
the worst of Faults, in spite of a thou∣sand
Reasons and all her Vertues,
which oppose them and stand up in
her defence. At last, these two illu∣strious
Lovers, after so agreeable a
Reconciliation, entertain'd one ano∣ther
with the most tender and most
charming Words that can be suppo∣sed
to proceed from two Hearts
newly re-united, and the Countess
touch'd to the quick by the Duke's
Caresses, had a mind to push on the
Conversation to a much higher and
more agreeable Point, had her Lo∣ver
improved his Opportunity on the
spot, and had they not been disap∣pointed
by an unforeseen Accident.
For while they were entertaining one

Body at the Door, but the Coun∣tess,
tho almost half dead with fear,
ran that way, and <HI>My dear Honey, my
sweet Child,</HI> said she to him, <HI>pray
make no noise, my little Bitch is Pup∣ping
and full of pain, she has not rested
a Minute all this Night, and wants a
little Sleep.</HI> The Count fell a Laugh∣ing
at the affectionate Air of his La∣dy
for her <HI>Jolley,</HI> and to please her,
went into another Room with the
Marquiss, whither the Picture was
brought to be viewed by them,
whilst <HI>Jolley</HI> was in Labour; she had
soon after three very fine Puppies,
and the Duke took the first Opportu∣nity
of securing them. The Countess
took care to have the Bitch with her
Puppies carry'd into the Closet;
which done, she left the Door open
and going into the Room where her
Husband and the Marquiss were walk∣ing
together. <HI>Well, Madam,</HI> said
the Count, perceiving his Lady to
be in a good Humour▪ <HI>how does</HI> Jolley
<HI>do? Have you sent for a Midwife?
My Lord,</HI> reply'd she smiling, <HI>there
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
is no need for one, she has brought forth
three charming Puppies. Poor little
Creature,</HI> cry'd the Count <HI>d' Olone,
Nature has taken care to deliver her of
her Pain.</HI> The Count and his Friend
spent some Hours at play, and in the
mean while the Countess returning
into her Closet, writ the following
Letter to the Duke of <HI>Candalle.</HI></P>
<P>“'TIS impossible for me, dear
Duke, to forbear Laughing
at every turn, when I reflect upon
the Method I made use of to im∣pose
upon my Good, Lovely and
Credulous Spouse, who is the best
qualify'd Husband for our Times,
when handsome Women make it
their Business to try their Husbands
Goodness by their Conversation
with others: Alass! 'tis impossible
to express my fear for you, when
I saw the Count at the Closet-door,
but thanks to Heaven, who so un∣expectedly
has delivered me from
this danger, and upon the so ha∣zardous
an occasion, I am convin∣ed,
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
that Love protects and crowns
my sincere Intentions in respect to
you. Come then, my Dear, let us
enjoy the Fruits of our good For∣tune
this Evening; whilst my lit∣tle
Spouse is abroad, we will make
our selves an amends for the delay
he has given us; and endeavour to
encrease what we have grafted on
his Head: Adieu, I expect your
coming by the Light of the Moon,
in my little Bed-Chamber, pray
come without making the least
noise; My Woman <HI>Ayme</HI> will let
you in, and take care to perswade
the good Man, my Spouse, that I
lie with the Marchioness of ….
You may be sure I always am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Candalle,</HI> who was
not a little uneasie to know how
things had been carry'd on at the
Countesses since his Absence, was o∣verjoy'd
at the sight, and reading of
this Letter, the Contents whereof be∣ing
very advantageous to him, he
returned the following Answer.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="48"/>
Madam,</P>
<P>“IF you were well pleased with
the Game you play'd your Love∣ly
Spouse, I have no less reason to
be satisfy'd, to see my self thus
happily delivered of his unseasona∣ble
Presence. Certainly nothing
can be more troublesome, than a
Husband who interrupts the En∣joyments;
and by his presence di∣sturbs
the Assignations of Lovers.
My Dear, I am a thousand times
more taken with your Merits now,
than ever I was before, and there∣fore
should almost run distracted, if
this Night, whilst we are together,
the good Man should come in, and
break the edge of my Sword, which
is not at all times ready for action;
improve the Opportunity to the
utmost, I will not fail to be at the
appointed place; and in the mean
while am a doing what you know,
that is, I am preparing to receive
your Commands, and to do my best
to …. and to give you
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
full satisfaction, for what I stand
indebted to you, that I may have
no Reproaches from you on that
account: Adieu, Madam, you are
too much concern'd in the Matter,
to give me any Abatement.”</P>
<P>'Twas not long after the Delivery
of the Letter, the Duke came and
stay'd all Night with Madam <HI>d' Olone,</HI>
who about six a Clock the next
Morning, disguised in a Gentleman's
Habit, came to the Marchioness of
…. where having stay'd for
some small time, she came home a∣gain,
and entertain'd the good Man,
with a thousand little Stories, such
as she thought most suitable to divert
him from taking any insight into her
Conduct.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O—s,</HI> who had left
her without taking his leave of her,
came to give her another Visit the
same Afternoon, their Conversation
was full of Tenderness, but without
coming to the Point, and her Hus∣band
being at home that Evening,
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
the Duke as he was returning to his
Palace, met upon the Stair-case which
leads to the Dutchess of—Lodg∣ings
the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who in all
probability descending from the Hill
of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> was wrapt up in a
Scarlet Cloak, and pass'd by close to
the Duke without speaking one
word, perhaps the Lovely God,
who presided in that place, had en∣joyn'd
him to Secrefie. The Duke
who knew him, was so far exaspe∣rated
at this bold and unaccountable
Deportment of the Count, that the
next day he made his Complaints
thereof to the King, in such pressing
and lively terms, that his Majesty
could not forbear to compassionate
his Case, and looking stedfast upon
the young Duke, whom he knew to
love the Dutchess his Spouse in a
most passionate Manner, this Mo∣narch
told him with a free Air: <HI>Sir,
had you no Attendance along with you,
when you met him, why did you not
cause him to be thrown out of the Win∣dow;
Be at rest some time longer, if
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
he continues in his Impudence, I know
how to rid my Hands of him, and how
to teach him, what respect is due to a
Person of your Rank.</HI> The Duke of
<HI>O—s,</HI> who always abounds in fri∣volous
Arguments, teez'd the King
for several Hours after, dwelling con∣tinually
upon the same Subject, till
at last he told him with a Smile:
<HI>Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>be satisfied with what I
have promised you, I am sensible you
most passionately Love your Spouse, you
have given some proofs of it even to
my self, before you Marry'd her, but
you may be assured I will find a way to
give you satisfaction, and remove your
Enemies at a greater distance. 'Tis
true, Sir,</HI> reply'd the Duke with a
more assured Countenance, <HI>I have a
thousand Observations to your Goodness,
but you know there is no Love without
some Intermixture of Jealousie. I know
it very well,</HI> reply'd the King with a
Smile, <HI>but be at rest, I will talk to the
Dutchess if you think fit, and to the
Mareschal</HI> de Grammont, <HI>to keep his
Son at home, and provide him an A∣musment
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
suitable to his Inclinations, or
else I will send him in the Quality of
my Envoy into</HI> Poland, <HI>to Compliment
that King upon his Accession to the
Throne. This last Expedient, Sir,</HI> said
the Duke smiling, <HI>is the best of all,
but knowing you to bare a great Respect
to the Marshal his Father, you will be
very unwilling to persist in that Resolu∣tion.
Not so much as you think for,</HI>
with an engaging Air, <HI>when it is to
do you service, to stop at nothing; and
were it not that I am unwilling to have
so nice a matter to make a noise in the
World, and what I am apt to believe,
the Dutchesses Complaisance for this bold
Fellow not to have exceeded the limits
of Indifferency, I would soon give you
very convincing Proofs of it.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> appear'd well
satisfy'd with what the King had told
him, who conducted him into the
Queen's Apartment, where the Dut∣chess
was then playing at Cards with
several other Ladies. Madam <HI>de
Montespan</HI> no sooner saw the Duke
of <HI>O—s</HI> come into the Room, but she
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
told him with a very pleasant Air,
<HI>Sir, You must come in with us, because
whenever you are not on my side, I am
sure to lose, one would almost believe
you playd booty to let me win. I am
ready to joyn with the Company,</HI> re∣ply'd
the Duke, with a very Compli∣sant
Air, <HI>there is a great deal of Plea∣sure
and Satisfaction in playing with
such Fair Ladies as you are.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst they were taken up a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Cards, the King went out of the
Room to Visit Madam <HI>La Valiere,</HI>
who was then very Ill. This Mo∣narch
would sit a whole Day toge∣ther
at her Bedside, to give her rei∣terated
assurances of the Force of his
Love, and Ardour of his Passion;
never was there a more strict Union,
or so well cemented a Passion seen
betwixt Lovers.</P>
<P><HI>The Count</HI> de Guiche, <HI>who durst
not appear at Court ever since his
meeting the Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>upon the
Stair-case, was almost reduced to De∣spair,
the only thing that afforded
him some Consolations, was, when
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
he found the Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>to make
his Addresses to the Marchioness of</HI>
Montespan; <HI>this made him tell one
of his Friends, who brought him the
first News of it:</HI> If I could but once
see him enter into an Intrigue with a
Lady, I am a happy Man; when he is
once engaged in an Amorous Amusement,
he will have no leisure to think of inter∣rupting
my Satisfaction by his Presence.
Alas, Sir, <HI>reply'd his Friend,</HI> you are
not so secure of this Good Fortune, as
you imagine. I am too well acquainted
with his Temper, he never is in earnest
with Ladies, he loves only to act the
Lover in outward shew, and to be re∣puted
a Man of Gallantry, and what
are the Ladies much the better for that?
You are altogether in the right of it,
Sir, <HI>reply'd the Count with a serious
Air,</HI> 'tis a hard matter to find out his
Temper and Inclinations. Not so hard
neither us you thing for, <HI>said the Che∣valier
with a Smile,</HI> first of all, he is
Jealous without Love, can keep a Secret,
and says little, full of Suspicion and a
great Dissembler, and you know what
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
else. Yes, I understand your meaning,
Sir, <HI>answered the Count,</HI> and besides
this, he never pardons a Fault. I am
quite lost in his Favour, since our meet∣ing
upon the Stair-case. You used to
be very intimate together, <HI>return'd the
Chevalier,</HI> this was a sudden Rupture,
and perhaps he has forgot it by this time.
O, Sir, I find you are but little ac∣quainted
with his Humour, <HI>said the
angry Count interrupting him,</HI> he
has the best Memory of any Man li∣ving,
especially if he bear a Grudge to
any Body, he takes a particular Plea∣sure
in not forgetting the least thing in
the World. The Dutchess of—unto
swhom I am not altogether indiffe∣rent,
has told me so a thousand times.
A <HI>Propos</HI> to the Dutchess, my dear
Friend, <HI>reply'd the Chevalier with
much eagerness,</HI> I think you are the
happiest Man in the World, to stand so
well in the Heart and Opinion of so
Charming a Lady, so Adorable so Ami∣able
a Person, I can never look at her
without sighing; she has a certain enga∣ging
Air, which challenges and van∣quishes
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>
the Hearts of all such as see her;
but alas! This is a dangerous and slip∣pery
Path to venture upon. I am too
sensible of it, my dear Friend, <HI>answer∣ed
the Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>with a deep
Sigh,</HI> but if it should cost me my Life,
I will not retreat, my Flame is too pure
ever to suffer me to repent of it; let
worst come to the worst, I can but spoil
my Fortune, <HI>continued he rubbing his
Forehead,</HI> and, after all, some certain
Charming Eyes flatter me at every turn,
that I shall continue for ever in the same
happy State. Don't put too much Con∣fidence,
Sir, in such Chimerical and
deceitful Notions, <HI>added the Cheva∣lier,</HI>
Fortune and Love are very fickle
and inconstant, the best way to secure
your Repose, will be to leave off an In∣trigue,
the Consequences whereof will be
fatal to your Fortune. Hah! Sir, what
would the Dutchess say, <HI>reply'd the
Count much surpriz'd,</HI> in case I should
take your advice; hah! dear Friend?
And what will the Duke and the whole
Court say, <HI>reply'd the Chevalier,</HI> when∣ever
these Gallantries are discovered?
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
Avoid, as I told you before, an En∣gagement
attended with so much dan∣ger.
I know not what I had best to do,
<HI>reply'd the Count in a melancholy
Tone,</HI> 'tis too late to retreat, but I will
endeavour to carry on matters with as
much Circumspection as possibly I can:
Adieu, I must leave you. Oh! Count,
<HI>cry'd the Chevalier shaking him by
the Hand,</HI> Lewis <HI>the Great has too
many</HI> Argos'<HI>s in his Palace, 'tis im∣possible
to deceive him.</HI> Let us not
dwell any longer upon that Subject, <HI>said
the Count,</HI> let us go to the Opera, I
hear <HI>Mariamne</HI> is to sing divers very
tender Airs to day. Yes, yes, Sir, <HI>an∣swered
the Chevalier laughing aloud,</HI>
that hits you exactly, you want nothing
to fortifie your Amorous Inquietudes,
and so they parted.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>after Play was
done at Court, went to Madam</HI> d'
Olone'<HI>s House disguised like a Pedlar
or ambulatory Shopkeeper, lately
come from</HI> England, <HI>who had some
very fine Ribons and Laces to sell.
The Countess, who little dream'd of
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
such a disguise, accosted him like
what he appear'd to be, and among
other things, bought a great many
Yards of Yellow Ribbons, which</HI>
Henry, <HI>the pretended Pedlar said,
were the finest and best he had, and
that the Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>had bought
some of the same Piece.</HI> How, <HI>said
the Countess interrupting him,</HI> were
you admitted into his Pallace? Yes,
Madam, <HI>reply'd the Pedlar very con∣fidently,</HI>
I was ordered to come thi∣ther.
That is very much, <HI>reply'd the
Lady,</HI> but let me see some of your finest
La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es for a Head-dress. I envy the
future happiness of my Laces, Ma∣dam,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Henry <HI>sighing,</HI> here,
are the very best. Truly, <HI>return'd Ma∣dam</HI>
d' Olone, <HI>without taking notice
of his words,</HI> they are very fine, how
do you sell them Friend? I shall put
no Price upon them to you, Madam,
<HI>said the Pedlar with a most passionate
and obliging Air,</HI> provided you …
What dost thou mean by this Friend?
<HI>added the Fair Lady laughing,</HI> I
mean, my Adorable Countess, that if
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>
you will Love me, you shall have them
for nothing. Certainly, <HI>said the Coun∣tess
with a scornful Air,</HI> this Fellow
is Mad, and fit for <HI>Bedlam.</HI> Alas!
Madam, <HI>cry'd poor</HI> Henry, <HI>kissing
her Hand most passionately,</HI> don't
treat me ill, were you sensible what I
suffer for you, you would pity me. <HI>Ma∣dam</HI>
d' Olone <HI>then casting her Eyes
fully upon him, knew him to be the
Duke of</HI> O—s, What is your meaning,
Sir, <HI>said she much surpr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zed,</HI> thus to
impose upon me? You may well be call'd
<HI>Protheus,</HI> who appears in all manner
of Shapes; I think this Disguise be∣comes
you as well as the former. What
would you have me do, <HI>reply'd the
Duke, discovering himself, and act∣ing
the disturbed and imaginary Lo∣ver.</HI>
When one is ready to die for
Love, you seem to try every thing to
please you, and to find the way to your
…. Do you think, Sir, <HI>re∣ply'd
she with a Gallant Air,</HI> to find
the way you look'd for, by disguising
your self like a Pedlar? No, no, you
are mistaken; this Dress does not very
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>
well become you, the Path to my Heart
is not so easie to be traced, it must be
something that comes in a much greater
Lustre to shew the way to it. But after
all, <HI>said the Duke,</HI> could not you ac∣cept
of such a Man's Heart as I am,
and of his portable Shop together?
<HI>The Countess, who had a great
mind to the Ribbons and Laces the
Duke had shew'd her, cry'd out</HI> Yes,
<HI>two or three times. So the Duke
presented her with his whole Shop,
which she freely accepted of, and
pay'd for it with the Coin of the
Court, that is, without disbursting
one Farthing; and the Duke being
much prepossess'd with her Beauty,
thought after all, he had a good
Market of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The next Day the Count</HI> de Guiche
<HI>having been taken up for some time
with the Thoughts upon what his
Friend had advised him, came to
pay his Respects to the Dutchess of
—whom he found by good
chance attended by one other Lady,
who withdrew as soon as the Count
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
came in. The Dutchess no sooner
cast her Eyes upon her Favourite,
but finding a considerable alteration
in his Countenance, she ask'd him the
reason of it, with a great deal of
Compassion and Tenderness: Where∣upon
the Count, without the least dis∣guising
the matter, confess'd his Fears
and the Apprehension he was under.</HI>
What a frait Man are you Count, <HI>said
she looking stedfastly on him,</HI> what
occasion have you to fear, as long as you
are belov'd by me? 'Tis true, Madam,
<HI>reply'd the Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>quite
transported,</HI> that being under the Pro∣tection
of so Illustrious a Lady as you
are. I ought to expect all the Favours
that Fortune can bestow upon me, and a
pleasing Repose; but most Divine and
Admirable Lady, pardon the fearful
Sentiments, which seem so contrary
to your Generosity and the Grandure of
Soul; a poor Mortal who is so fortu∣nate
to be belov'd by you, conceives so
high an Opinion of his good Fortune,
that it surpasses even his own knowledge,
and makes him always dread the loss of
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
it; and being continually tormenied
with these Thoughts, he is always Ʋn∣fortunate.
And pray Count, <HI>reply'd
the Dutchess in a very obliging
manner,</HI> what is to be done to settle
your good Fortune, and render you less
Ʋnfortunate? I am not able to tell,
my Incomparable Lady, <HI>reply'd the
Count kissing her Hand,</HI> my Destiny
is at your Disposal, and 'tis in your
Power to …. Say no more,
Count, <HI>interrupting him with a smile,</HI>
you are a Fool with all your Rhetorick,
Figures and Hyperbolical Expressions.
I am very willing to own it, Madam,
<HI>said the Count in a most respectful
manner,</HI> I am almost reduced to despair,
that I should discover you my Passion
in such rough and vulgar Language, but
was not able to pitch upon any other,
tho I have studied the Language of the
<HI>God of Love,</HI> and perused the most po∣lite
and tender parts of it for a consi∣derable
time. O Count, <HI>added the
Dutchess with a Charming Voice,</HI>
I am not ignorant, that true Love is not
the most Eloquent, nor versed in the
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>
Rules of Oratory, it commonly disco∣covers
its strength and sincerity in dis∣orderly
Words, and a Man who is truly
in Love, makes the oddest Figure that
can be, before the Person who has en∣gaged
his Heart; it seems, as if his
Passion renders him fearful, bashful,
and if I may say so, were not very a∣greeable
at certain intervals. <HI>The
Count</HI> de Guiche, <HI>who had taken
particular notice, how nicely the
Dutchess had drawn his Picture, an∣swered
her only by a very deep
Sigh, which set her a Laughing for
some time. At last, she told him in
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>most obliging manner;</HI> Count, con∣sider
what is to be done, that I may
have the Satisfaction to see you every
Day; I expect a certain Young Lady
ont of <HI>England,</HI> who is to be one of
any Ladies, and who, as I am told, is
very like you; no Body knows her at
this Court, so I will privately send her
word she must not come as yet, because
I am provided already at this time: In
the mean while you shall disguise your
self in the same Apparel intended for
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
her, and so pass for my Maid, and act
her Part. <HI>The Count, tho he took
no small satisfaction in what he
heard the Dutchess propose to him,
yet could not forbear, with all the
Symptoms of Melancholy in his Face,
to represent the dangers and hazards
that were likely to attend such a
Disguise; however he accepted the
Offer, cost what it would, and so
took his Leave of her for that
time.</HI></P>
<P>Some Days after the Count ha∣ving
taken his Leave of the Court,
under pretence of an intended Voy∣age,
put on his Womans Apparel,
which suited him to a Miracle, espe∣cially
when he was in a loose Dress,
wherein his Mistress much delighted
to see him, and it was taken notice
of at Court, that the <HI>English</HI> Lady
was in extraordinary Esteem with
the Dutchess. The Count, who un∣derstood
<HI>English</HI> very well, tasted a
thousand Pleasures not to be express'd
by those who were never in Love
and beloved; having the satisfacti∣on
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
to entertain, at all Hours, the
handsomest and most amiable of all
Women living. His Happiness con∣tinued
thus for about a Month, but
as even the most perfect of all his
near Affairs draw to a Period, so his
Felicity was overturn'd by an unfore∣seen
Accident. Mrs. <HI>Degine,</HI> this was
the Name the Count had taken, be∣ing
to attend at her Levy, and the
Duke happening to be there, took
particular notice of a Head-dress,
which became her very well, at last
fixing his Eyes on her, whilst she cast
hers down to the Ground, out of a
pretended Modesty, the Duke, who
is naturally mistrustful, told his
Spouse, That this young Lady was
so like the Count <HI>d' Guiche,</HI> that he
believed her to be his Sister: He had
no sooner said these words, but he
began to play with her, and under
that pretence put his Hand into her
Bosom. The Count counterfeiting
the Maid, according to his Mistres∣ses
Command, Blush'd, not so much
out of Modesty, as out of fear of
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>
being discovered; and the Duke,
who was ignorant of the true cause
of it, pursued his Game, and told
her merrily; <HI>Don't Blush, Fair Maid,
'tis only Curiosity that makes me desirous
to be satisfy'd in a thing I have heard
them tell me for a certain Truth,</HI> viz.
<HI>That the</HI> English <HI>Ladies are well pro∣vided
with Bubbies, and I find no
such thing by you.</HI> The Dutchess,
who was not well pleased with his
Courtship, gave him to understand,
that she could not see such like Acti∣ons
in her Presence, which made him
leave the Room. He was no sooner
gone, but the Count seeing himself
at liberty to talk to the Dutchess,
told her with a very pensive and me∣lancholy
Air; <HI>Madam, I am lost for
ever should the Duke discover me under
this Disguise. I am almost distracted
with the Thoughts of it, my dear Count,</HI>
reply'd she with a Sigh, <HI>I find Envy
will not suffer me to enjoy the Satisfa∣ction
I take in your Company, and that
even the most innocent Pleasures in the
World, must serve to disturb my Re∣pose;
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
who could have imagined, that
the Duke's Mistrust and Curiosity would
have reach'd so far, as to think in the
least of it? Alas! Madam,</HI> cry'd
the Count with a very passionate Air,
<HI>my Happiness was too great, and too
much subject to Envy, to continue for
any long time; such Charming Plea∣sures
as these are seldom attended with
Tranquillity. I must confess it, Count,</HI>
reply'd the Dutchess, with a Lan∣guishing
Air, <HI>the highest Felicities are
never without an allay of Troubles and
Vexation: But,</HI> continued she with a
Tender Air, <HI>I don't repent of what I
have done; let us carry on this Ad∣venture
as far as it will bear, and leave
the rest to the Favour and Conduct of
Love. Ah! most Divine Lady,</HI> re∣ply'd
the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> trembling
and throwing himself at her Feet,
<HI>is there any Felicity like mine? No,</HI>
cry'd he, embracing them, <HI>all the pre∣tended
Enjoyments of the World, are
nothing but Chimerical Notions in com∣parison
to mine …..</HI> The
Count was in such a Rapture, that
he could say no more, which being
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>
very well observed by the Dutchess,
she was moved with Compassion, and
would doubtless have lent him a
helping hand, had not the Countess
<HI>de Soisons</HI> happened to come in,
which made Mrs. <HI>Degine</HI> reassume
her serious Countenance and to re∣tire
into the Dutchesses Closet, un∣der
pretence of looking for some∣thing
she had left there, whilst the
Dutchess advanced towards the
Countess with a merry Air, singing
these Words: <HI>Oh! how sweet are
these hidden Pleasures, to two Hearts
entirely united. Are you sensible, as
well as my self, Madam,</HI> said the
Countess smiling, <HI>that Love managed
in private, is a thousand times more
charming, than when it makes a noise
in the World. I can't tell that, my
Dear,</HI> reply'd the Dutchess dissem∣bling
her real Sentiments, <HI>they are
Words I once heard in an Opera, which
run in my Head, because I think them
very pleasant.</HI> Their Discourse run
soon after upon divers other Points,
and the Visit being not very long,
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>
the Dutchess went into the Closet,
where she entertain'd her Favourite
with abundance of Freedom and Ca∣resses,
treating him no otherwise
than if she had been of her own Sex,
and telling him in a most engaging
manner: <HI>I wonder what this Woman
wanted, to come here to disturb our Di∣versions,
she is one of those that must be
every where, where her Company is not
much desired.</HI> The Count who saw
himself caress'd with such an Excess
of Tenderness, return'd no Answer,
dreading the Consequence, and that
his Satisfaction would be of no lon∣ger
Continuance; and the Dutchess
guessing at the cause of his Silence,
told him with a Smile; <HI>How, fair</HI>
Minerva, <HI>are you so busie as not to
speak one word? Would it please Hea∣vens,
Madam,</HI> cry'd the Count quite
transported, <HI>I was Master of the Ta∣lent
belonging to that Goddess, I would
transform my self in what shape I
thought most favourable to my Love, and
consequently would make my self the
most happy Mortal on Earth. Could
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>
you, Count,</HI> reply'd the Dutchess,
<HI>borrow that Cloud wherein this Daugh∣ter
of</HI> Jupiter <HI>saved</HI> Ulysses <HI>from the
Persecutions of a Nymph who kept him
shut up in her Grotto for fear of losing
him, you would have opportunity enough
to deceive abundance of mistrustful Per∣sons,
and especially the Duke. Madam,</HI>
said the Count not without some
heat, <HI>when he might search at Plea∣sure,
he would grasp at a Shadow only.
But after all, my Dear,</HI> reply'd the
Dutchess Laughing aloud, <HI>I would
not have you dwell always in a Cloud,
Love is for more substantial things.
That is true, adorable Lady,</HI> reply'd
the Count with a passionate Air, <HI>but
had I the Power of taking what shape I
please, I would often transform my self
into a</HI> Golden Rain, <HI>or some such
like thing. Alas!</HI> added the Dutchess
with a Sigh, <HI>why don't we live in that
happy Age, when ….</HI> The
Duke coming in, but overhearing
only these last words, without being
able to guess at the rest of what had
been talk'd betwixt them, continued
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>
their Discourse with a malicious Air;
<HI>when People liv'd in Tranquility and
without Inquietudes. You are in the
right of it, Sir,</HI> reply'd the Dutchess,
arising from her Seat, and ordering
Mrs, <HI>Degine,</HI> with a very serious Air,
to take care to have something alter∣ed
in her <HI>Toilet.</HI></P>
<P>Dinner being over, the Duke was
very uneasie to know what was be∣come
of the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> went
to <HI>Versailles,</HI> where he consulted with
the King and some great Lords of the
Court about it, but could learn no∣thing
that was satisfactory among
them. For, tho this Prince was o∣verjoy'd
at his Absence, nevertheless
he could not forbear making his
Enquiry after him, moved by a cer∣tain
Curiosity, which is natural to
him. But not being able to hear any
certain Account of him, and meeting
with the Marshal <HI>de Grammont,</HI> just as
he was coming out of his Majesties
Closet, he ask'd him concerning his
Son, who answer'd him in a melan∣choly
Tone, That his Son had con∣ceal'd
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
his Voyage from him, so that
he did not know what Course he
had taken. <HI>'Tis likely,</HI> reply'd the
Duke smiling, <HI>this Gallant Cavalier
thought it bist to be beforehand with the
Court, who designed to send him to
….</HI> The Marshal, who very
well understood the Duke's meaning,
thought fit to dissemble the matter,
<HI>and therefore you are,</HI> said he, <HI>doubtless
better acquainted with the Mystery than
my self: I am ignorant in most of my
Sons Affairs, and willing, as far as in
me lies, not to be troubled with them.
You are in the right of it,</HI> reply'd the
Duke with a smile, <HI>a Person of the
Count</HI> de Guiche'<HI>s Character, often
carries Matters beyond what he thinks
of, nay, even beyond what he ought to
do. What can I do in such a case,</HI>
says the Marshal much vex'd, <HI>I hope
you will have so much Goodness, Sir,
as to excuse his Faults, and that want
of Respect he has been guilty of towards
your Person. Yes, Marshal,</HI> reply'd
the Duke as he was going away, <HI>I
will excuse and pardon every thing for
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>
your sake; but if he is forgetful of
what he owes me, he must not expect
either to make his Fortune through my
Means, or hope for any other Favours
from me.</HI> The Marshal <HI>de Grammont</HI>
had no sooner parted from the Duke
but he went to one whom he knew
to be his Sons Confident, and rela∣ted
to him what had pass'd betwixt
the Duke and him, and entreating
him to let him know where he was,
because he intended to write to him
concerning some Matters of the last
Consequence: But the Marquess of
…. who was acquainted with
every step the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> made
in all his Affairs, would notwith∣standing
all the Earnest Intreaties of
the Marshal, not tell him one word of
his Concerns, but so soon as he was
gone, took care to write the follow∣ing
Lines to the Count his Friend.</P>
<LETTER>
<P><PB N="70" REF="74"/>
“'TIS not till now, Sir, I am
told, to my Grief, by your
Father, that the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI>
is very uneasie to know what is
become of you. 'Tis time, believe
me, to put an end to the Part you
are now acting: The Scene has
been too long to hold out any lon∣ger;
on the other hand the Danger
is too great, if your Disguise should
be known, you know it is so as
well as my self. But what shall I
say, dear Friend, you are (as it is
easie to guess it can be no other∣wise)
so far intoxicated with those
Pleasures you meet with in the
Company of the most adorable
Lady of the whole World, that
you little think of those Misfor∣tunes
which must inevitably befal
you, unless you take immediate
care of, and reflect seriously on your
present Condition; having Sworn
an inviolable and constant Friend∣ship
to you, 'tis that that has obli∣ged
me to put Pen to Paper, to
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>
to forewarn you of the danger,
and to tell you, that I pity any
Body that is thus by the Snares of
Love drawn to the very Brink of
so high a Precipice: But, perhaps
you will tell me, this Advice is di∣rectly
opposite to your Satisfaction,
and that I being Blind my self,
pretend to Lead another Blind Man,
and that unless Fortune thinks fit
to favour us, we shall be, both in
the same degree: I am very sensible
what you are able to tell me on
that Head, but I beseech you, be∣fore
you do it to consider what a
vast difference there is betwixt the
Dutchess of …. and the

my Letter, I remain,”</P>

Your much Affectionate Servant.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="70" REF="76"/>
<HI>The Count, who happened to be
alone when this Letter was delivered
to him, was ready to die for Vexati∣on,
when he perceived his sinister
Destiny to croud upon him on all
sides:</HI> Alas! <HI>said he to himself in
a most doleful Posture;</HI> must I for
ever abandon the Charms and Enjoy∣ments
of my Life? No, 'tis impossible,
<HI>continued he,</HI> unless it be with the
Loss of my Life, which would be very
indifferent to me without the enjoyment
of the same Felicity: But alas! I talk
at random, and was not born for the
possession of such precious Things; I
must take leave of my Charming Mi∣stress,
who has at all times given me
such signal Proofs of her Goodness, that
I find my self too weak by far to put in
execution so weak a Resolution, and so
opposite to my Repose. O! Love, who
hast kindled so bright a Flame, which
has almost consumed me, pray afford
me strength to support. But I lose all
my Senses in the very Idea of this fatal
Parting; nothing is able to afford me
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>
any Consolation for so great a Loss;
But what is to be done? I had better
part with this Incomparable Lady for
some time, than be for ever debarr'd
from seeing her. <HI>The Count was still
busied in talking thus, when the
Dutchess of—who had
been abroad a visiting with the
Countess of</HI> Soisons, <HI>and some La∣dies,
entered the Room alone, and
finding the Count quite buried in his
Complaints, she drew nearer, and
told him with a Smile,</HI> What is the
matter, dear Mrs <HI>Degine?</HI> You seem
to be quite dejected, and do nothing
but sigh. O Heavens! Madam, can
you ask what is the matter, after that
fatal Order I am forced to obey, to be
separated from you, most Divine Lady,
is not that enough to make me die a
thousand Deaths? Nay, 'tis certain,
this fatal stroak will cost me my Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.
<HI>The Count could not pronounce
these words without shedding some
Tears, which being very precious to
the Dutchess, she ask'd him in a most
tender manner, Whether he had
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>
heard any other ill Tidings, and what
made him give way thus to his Pas∣sion.
The Count was not in a con∣dition
to say one word, his Sobs and
Sighs had stop'd the free Course of
his Voice; which the Dutchess per∣ceiving,
told him with a very passi∣onate
Air;</HI> What means this Silence,
my dear Count? Alas! I am as much
afflicted as your self when I think of
our cruel separation; but take Comfort,
this shall not be, till there is no further
Remedy against it. Madam, <HI>reply'd
he with a melancholy Air,</HI> you know
that great Afflictions are speechless,
whereas indifferent ones make a great
noise; the Duke leaves no Stone un∣turn'd
to know what is become of me:
A certain Friend of mine has given me
notice of it, and if I should be found
out, I am undone for ever: And so
am I Count, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess full
of Sadness,</HI> but can the Duke carry his
Mistrust so far, as to imagine that you
are here under the Disguise of a Young
Lady? Notbing more certain, Madam,
<HI>said the Count</HI> de Guiche, <HI>shewing
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>
her the Letter that was sent him:</HI>
This is what the most faithful of all
my Friends writes to me. And who
is this Friend, Count? <HI>reply'd the
Dutchess looking on him stedfastly,
and having perused the Letter,</HI> Don't
dissemble with me, <HI>said she,</HI> I dare en∣gage
it is your sincere Confident <HI>De∣ward?</HI>
No, Madam, 'tis the Mar∣quiss
of …. who loves me as
dear as his own Brother, and who would
run distracted, should any misfortune
befal me. Oh! I know him, my Dear,
<HI>answered she,</HI> he is a Man of Honour,
and is Master of a vast share of Sense;
we must then be forced to follow his
Advice, to part, which can't be done
without an infinite deal of trouble and
pain on either side; but we must give
way to necessity, without any further
Consideration; that so we may hope to
enjoy the Satisfaction of seeing one ano∣ther
again. <HI>At last it was agreed,
that Mrs.</HI> Degine <HI>should go back into</HI>
England, <HI>under pretence of want of
Health, and that the Air of</HI> France
<HI>was not agreeable to her Constituti∣on;
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
and that afterwards the Count
should appear again at Court, pre∣tending
he had taken a Tour to some
of the most remote Provinces. This
was done accordingly some Weeks
after, scarce any Body suspecting the
matter, except very few who got
scent of all the chief Circumstances
relating to this Affair.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> being now
somewhat eased of his Jealousie,
thought of nothing else but how to
divert himself, went two or three
Days successively to the Play: The
fourth Day, when the whole Court
was there present, he got upon the
Stage, and told the Comedians, that
he would be one of the Actors that
Day, which they easily consented to;
they happened in this Play to di∣vert
the Company with an Entry
composed of disguised Lovers;
wherein the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> repre∣sented
the Part of a disguised Shep∣herdess,
courted by a good number
of Rural Cupids, whilst her Shepherd
was in search after her in a solitary
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
Wood: The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who was
at the Play-house, Blush'd several times
whilst they were a dancing, fearing
lest some Body or other had found
out, what a Part he had acted of late
at Court. The Play being done,
the Duke of <HI>O—s,</HI> who was very
desirous to hear the Approbation of
the Court concerning the Rural De∣portment
of the Sphepherdess, began
the Discourse, and ask'd every one
his Opinion. <HI>Truly,</HI> said the King
Laughing, <HI>the Shepherdess seem'd to
me agreeable enough, tho all Ornaments
they had were nothing but Flowers; but
after all, I liked best of all her Coun∣try
like ways when her Lover came to
her, and she frankly and sincerely told
him, she had loved him before she had
known him, relying upon the account
she had received from one of her Compa∣nions,
of his singular Merits, before all
the other Shepherds of the Village. And
for my part,</HI> said the Dutchess of—coldly,
<HI>I was much pleased
with the Shepherds most tender Decla∣ration
to his Mistress, and with his
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
Country like Expressions; he call'd the
Meadows and Woods a thousand times
to be Witnesses of his Oaths, and with
these Savage Lovers, who writ their
Names on the Barks of Trees, and best
of all with that ugly Satyr, who lay
conceal'd in a hollow Tree to observe
their Courtship; I had not easily laugh'd
so much as I did, when I saw this Sa∣tyr
burst out into most dreadful Cries,
so soon as he observed</HI> Damon <HI>to take
his Mistress by the Hand, and to kiss
it most tenderly. That old jealous
horned Beast,</HI> reply'd the Duke smi∣ling,
<HI>could not be an Eye Witness of
these innocent Pleasures, without being
envious at them There are many others,</HI>
continued the Dutchess Laughing, <HI>of
the same Opinion, tho they are no Sa∣tyrs,
unless it be by their Heads: To
put a mark upon them, they ought to
bear the Weapons of that Creature.
Alas!</HI> reply'd the King with a mali∣cious
Smile, <HI>there are enough of those
that wear them without knowing it.</HI>
The Conversation had not ended
here, but that Supper was served up,
<PB N="79" REF="83"/>
after which they went to Play till
pretty late in the Night.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of—who
was fal'n into a very deep Melancho∣ly
ever since the Count de <HI>Guiche</HI>
had left off his Female Apparel, went
home pretty early, being scarce able
to dispense with any Merry Compa∣ny.
The Count, on his side, was
not in a better condition; for after
having tasted the Charms and Ra∣vishments
of Love, he call'd to his
Remembrance, without intermission,
the Pleasures he had lost by his Ab∣sence,
and that nothing in the World
was comparable to the Presence of
his incomparable Dutchess: These
languishing and doleful Reflections
reduced him to so low a state, that
he wax'd Ill, and was almost insup∣portable
in Company: His ordinary
place of Retirement was in the Wood
of <HI>Vincennes,</HI> where he spent the
greatest part of his time in rumina∣ting
upon his Misfortune. One Day
when the Dutchess of—was
taking the Air, in the Company of
<PB N="80" REF="84"/>
the Countess of <HI>Soisons</HI> near the said
Wood, they espy'd at a distance a
certain Person well attired, lying up∣on
the Grass near a small Brook, ut∣tering
most dreadful Complaints,
Women being naturally inclin'd to
Curiosity, they ordered the Coach∣man
to drive that way, and the
Countess soon knowing him to be
the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> cry'd out aloud
so as to frighten the Dutchess of
—<HI>Oh! What is the matter with
you, Countess,</HI> said the Dutchess, <HI>are
you frightned at a Gentleman. O!
Madam,</HI> reply'd my Lady <HI>Soissons,</HI>
somewhat surpriz'd, <HI>'tis the Count</HI> de
Guiche, <HI>whom we heard to utter those
Sighs and Complaints. Alas! my dear,</HI>
answered the Dutchess with some
Emotion, <HI>what fatal Accident has be∣faln
him? Come let us go near, I be∣seech
you.</HI> The Ladies alighting out
of the Coach, went to the place
where they saw this afflicted Lover,
who being amazed at the sight of
the Object of his Vows, heard her
say to him smiling; <HI>What do you
<PB N="81" REF="85"/>
Count, your Thoughts carry you to very
remote places.</HI> The Gentleman, who
very well understood the Dutchesses
meaning, arose and paid his Re∣spects
to her, in the most languish∣ing
manner in the World: <HI>My In∣quietudes,</HI>
said he, <HI>Madam, draw me
hither in spite of my self, and triumph
over my weakness. I find Count,</HI> re∣ply'd
the Dutchess Laughing, <HI>you
are fal'n in Love with some Nymph or
other of this Wood, who doubtless has
given you a tender Assignation in this
delightful place. Alas! Madam,</HI> said
the Count, casting a tender Look at
her, and fetching several deep Sighs,
<HI>Did you but know how indifferent all
Assignations are to me, ever since…
I understand your meaning, Sir,</HI> said
the Dutchess interrupting him, for
fear least he should say more than
he ought to do before the Countess,
who was very well versed in the
Game of Love, <HI>come into our Coach to
divert your Splenatick Thoughts; the
Air of this Wood is accounted very
wholsome for Languishing Lovers, such
<PB N="82" REF="86"/>
as you are at this time.</HI> The Count
being ready to obey, took several
Turns with them in the Coach, and
the next day paid a Visit to the
Dutchess at her Palace; she being
then engaged in Company, the Count
retired into one of the most remote
Corners of the Room, to amuse him∣self
in composing some Verses, till
the Company were gone. Every mo∣ment
seem'd no less than a Year to
him, but at last seeing his admired
Lady alone, he hastned to meet her,
and she conducted him into her Clo∣set,
where they were together for
two hours, and as 'tis supposed, did
not spend all their time in trifling
Discourses. The Duke then hap∣pening
to come to the Closet Door,
and his Spouse not knowing what to
do at so unexpected an Exigency of
Affairs, put her Lover into a Ward∣robe,
and putting the Key into her
Pocket, went to open the Door to
the Duke, who with a merry Coun∣tenance
told her, <HI>Madam, you are in∣vited
to a most magnificent Feas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the
<PB N="83" REF="87"/>
King is to give this Evening, and are
to be the Queen of the Ball, but you
must come along with me immediately,
because the whole Company stays for your
coming. Sir, why would not you let
me know of it, for now,</HI> reply'd the
Dutchess with much indifferency, <HI>I
did not expect no such thing. Nor I
neither, Madam,</HI> continued the Duke,
<HI>but this Surprize is so agreeable in it
self, that you can't well be displeased
with it, considering you love Dancing,
and good Dancers so dearly; and you
will be sure to meet there with all the
Gallants of the Court, especially the
Duke of …. who, in your
Opinion, is capable of charming the
most insensible Heart in the World. You
have an excellent Memory, Sir,</HI> reply'd
the Dutchess with some scorn, <HI>to re∣member
still what I said the other Day,
certainly you have thought more of him
since, than I. Come, let us not dissem∣ble
with one another,</HI> return'd the
Duke, <HI>you have at least as much kind∣ness
for him, as for the Count</HI> de ….
<HI>who is your Bosom Favourite: But
<PB N="84" REF="88"/>
pray what is become of him, methinks I
see him not so often as I used to do.
You know more of him, Sir,</HI> said she
Blushing, <HI>than any body else, and I
wonder your Curiosity should not lead
you to learn every thing concerning him,
you want to know. Well, let us call
another Cause, since this vexes you,</HI> re∣ply'd
the Duke, <HI>and make haste to
the Ball. Pray go you before,</HI> said the
Dutchess coldly, <HI>I have some Business
to do that admits of no delay, before I
go.</HI> There needed no more to raise
the Duke's Curiosity, who is always
ready to lay hold even of the most
insignificant occasions; so that the
poor Lady seeing not the least Pro∣bability
of ridding her hands of him,
was fixed to go forward sorely a∣gainst
her Will, and leave the Count
shut up in the Wardrobe. The
Dutchess, who was a most passionate
Lover of Dancing, and all the other
Delights of our Senses, seeing her
self adored by all the Princes and
great Lords there present, thought
no more on her poor Count, who
<PB N="85" REF="89"/>
found his Quarters so uneasie, that
he had several times a mind to call
out for help; had not his fear of be∣ing
discovered and losing his adored
Beauty, withheld, and, as it were, sti∣fled
his Voice. <HI>Ʋnto what innume∣rable
Troubles does not my Love expose
me,</HI> said he to himself, whilst shut up
in the Cage, <HI>every Day furnishes me
fresh Matter of Vexation; but,</HI> added
he, <HI>I sometimes also reap the Fruits of
my Pains and Trouble; and since my
adorable Mistress is not come to me, I
ought to conquer my Impatience, and
expect with constancy my Delivery;
this will be look'd upon as a Sacrifice
of Sufferings I am again to offer to her
Charms.</HI> Thus the Count pass'd a∣way
his tiresome Hours, each of
which seem'd an Age to him: About
Day Break, the Dutchess, who had
been very Merry all that while, re∣membring
her Prisoner. <HI>Alas!</HI> cry'd
she in a Fright, <HI>what have I done?</HI>
The King and Prince <HI>de Conde,</HI> who
sate next to her, surprized to see her
thus change on a sudden, our Mo∣narch
<PB N="86" REF="90"/>
whispering her, ask'd, What
could be the cause of so unexpected
an Emotion; <HI>I will tell you, Sir,</HI> re∣ply'd
she with a melancholy Air;
<HI>this is the remaining Idea of a Fright,
which happened to me some time ago,
the remembrance whereof always troubles
me. And Madam,</HI> answered the King
passionately, <HI>may not one know what
it is; perhaps there may be a way found
to cure you of it? No, Sir,</HI> reply'd
the Dutchess, <HI>pray don't urge me any
further, it will be over as soon as I re∣turn
to the</HI> Palace Royal. His Ma∣jesty,
who at all times is highly
Complaisant to the Fair Sex, said no
more; and she no sooner saw the
King gone another way, but went a∣way
<HI>incognito,</HI> in order to deliver
the Count from his Imprisonment.
After having made a thousand Excu∣ses
for her forgetfulness, she desired
him, with a most charming and ten∣der
Air, to depart for fear of such
another sinister Accident, which he
saw himself obliged to do, tho his
Love pleaded never so strong against
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
it. The Duke happening to come
within a quarter of an hour into
the Dutchesses Apartment, did feel
something under his Feet, just at the
very Door, which being taken up,
he found it to be the Count's Pocket
Book he had let drop for haste, as he
was going away, and contain'd, a∣mong
other things, the before men∣tioned
Verses, and some of his passi∣nate
Letters he had shewn to the
Dutchess. The Duke, who had been
too much acquainted with the Count
not to know his Hand Writing, was
going to the Candle to peruse them,
but the Dutchess who observed his
Motions, in a seeming composed
Air, came and snatch'd them from
behind out of his Hands. <HI>Let me
alone, Madam,</HI> said the Duke some∣what
angry, <HI>I have here the Secrets of
the Count</HI> de Guiche, <HI>I suppose 'tis not
very long ago since he was here. 'Tis
above a Month ago,</HI> said the Dutch∣ess
much disturbed, <HI>since I spoke a
word to him; and it was I who took
the Table Book from him, because he
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>
told me that contain'd the exact Por∣traiture
of his Mistress. Let us see it
then,</HI> said the Duke Laughing <HI>perhaps
it is the Princess of …..
who inspiries into him these Amorous
Fits, and who has turn'd his Brains.
Not long ago I saw him in</HI> Tuillery,
<HI>talk to himself in a solitary place, re∣mote
from the Company, like a</HI> Man∣hater.
<HI>You know much more of him
than I do, Sir,</HI> reply'd the Dutchess
with a seeming Indifference, <HI>he ne∣ver
communicated his Secrets to me;
you know that Men in general make
such Mysteries of their Amorous In∣trigues,
that one can't intermeddle in
those Affairs, without offending them.
And, Madam,</HI> said the Duke, <HI>are not
the Ladies guilty of the same fault?
If dissembling in this kind be a Crime,
certainly it belongs a thousand times
more to your Sex than ours; you make
Mysteries of every thing, witness your
present Deportment, for you will nei∣ther
let me see the Count's Pocket Book,
nor make me a Confident of his Incli∣nations.
I beg your pardon, Sir,</HI> re∣ply'd
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>
the Dutchess with a flattering
Air, <HI>I have promised him a thousand
times upon my Honour, not to reveal his
Secrets, and since you have so little
respect for him, what good will it do
you? I should be very glad to divert
my self at his Book,</HI> reply'd the Duke,
<HI>with my Friends, who would be very
well pleased with such a Passion.</HI>
The Dutchess, who was very unea∣sie
at the Pocket Book, wherein she
was not a little concern'd, lock'd
them up very secure, and the Duke
before she could get into Bed, came
again to teaze her about it for a con∣siderable
time, but in vain, so he left
her Chamber in Discontent, and
continued in so ill a Humour for ma∣ny
Days after, that scarce any Body
durst speak to him.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> in the mean
while, went to search for his Pocket
Book in every Place, and was ready to
run distracted when he considered
that he might perhaps have dropt it
in the <HI>Palace Royal,</HI> and that some
Body or other of the Duke's Family
<PB N="90" REF="94"/>
might have taken it up. To be sa∣tisfy'd
in the matter, he went the
next Day in a very serious Posture
to visit the Dutchess of—,
who told him with a malicious Air,
<HI>Alas! Count, we are undone, you have
dropt your Table Book, and the Duke
of—has found it, consider into
what Troubles you have plunged me.</HI>
The Count, at this dreadful News,
was ready to drop down at her Feet,
for fear the whole Intrigue should be
unravell'd; <HI>Take Courage, my Dear,</HI>
said the Dutchess seeing him thus
dejected; <HI>such Timorous Lovers as you
stand frequently in need of a Comforter.
'Tis certain, Madam,</HI> reply'd he kis∣sing
her Hand, <HI>those charming Words
coming from your fair Mouth, are e∣nough
to revive me from the Dead,
without which my Misfortunes has long
ago carry'd your Ʋnfortunate Slave to
the Grave. How, Count,</HI> return'd the
Lady, <HI>and you think your self Vnfor∣tunate,
after what I have done for you.
Alas! I am afraid you are ƲƲngrateful
and little deserving of my Favours and
<PB N="91" REF="95"/>
Care. Madam,</HI> answered the Count
<HI>de Guiche</HI> in a most submissive Po∣sture,
<HI>you did not very well apprehend
my meaning; I think my self Ʋnfor∣tunate
in respect of my Birth, being
so much inferiour to yours, but in re∣spect
of your Goodness toward me, all
the World is not able to furnish me
with words suitable to the Acknowledg∣ment
I owe you, and the Satisfaction I
seek within me. This is a very fair
Confession, Count,</HI> said the Dutchess of—with
a smile, <HI>let us talk no
more of our Vexations and Troubles.</HI>
The Count spent the whole Day and
half the Night with her, in such
Diversions as best suited her present
Inclinations; but great was their
Surprize, when about two a Clock
in the Morning, the Gentleman who
had made the best of his time in the
absence of the Duke of—heard
him coming towards the
Room where they were, and the
Lady who heard his Tongue, said
to the Count, who was in Bed with
her; <HI>Good Heavens, my dear Count,
<PB N="92" REF="96"/>
we are undone, I hear the Duke's Voice,
what must we do to hide our selves from
his Jealous Eyes?</HI> The Count trem∣bling
from Head to Foot without
being able to return one word in
Answer to his Goddess, got out of
her Arms under the Bed in his Shirt
only; and the Duke of—be∣ing
resolved not to go into his own
Bedchamber, before he had seen his
Lady in hers, went thither accord∣ingly
without a Candle, and very
softly, for fear of making a noise and
disturbing her, it being a bright
Moon light Night; finding her awake,
he seated himself upon her Bedside,
where he entertain'd her with divers
trifling Matters, whilst the poor La∣dy
was under the greatest uneasiness
in the World for her Lover, who
lay all this while upon the Boards to
save himself. She did all she could
to get rid of him, but finding all her
Endeavours in vain, she pretended
to be asleep, desiring him, at the
same time to let her rest a little, be∣cause
she had not slept all that Night,
<PB N="93" REF="97"/>
being very much troubled at his long
stay; <HI>but now,</HI> added she, <HI>I have
seen you here, pray let me take a little
rest, Not so, Madam,</HI> reply'd the
Duke of—<HI>I don't intend to lie
alone this Night, and to convince you
of it, I am just now coming into Bed
to you. Oh! I did believe as much,
Sir.</HI> reply'd the Dutchess of—vex'd
to the Heart; <HI>We Marry'd Wo∣men
now adays have but a slender In∣fluence
upon our Husbands. And tru∣ly,
Madam,</HI> return'd he smiling, <HI>we
Husbands, have much less upon our
Wives. How! for a Woman to refuse
to her Husband the Lawful Priviledges
of Marriage. To tell you the Truth,
nothing can be more Vexatious and
Afflicting to a Husband, than to see
himself treated in such a manner.</HI>
The Dutchess seeing it was but in
vain to make more words; and that
he was resolved to come into Bed
to her, submitted with Patience,
and the poor Count was forced to
creep close in his Quarters, under∣neath
till Day light. You may
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>
guess at his Vexation, especially
when he perceived his Mistress to
receive the Caresses of a Man in the
World he hated most. As good For∣tune
would have it, the Duke of
… having a mind to rise ear∣ly
in the Morning, and his Gentle∣man
happening to light upon the
Count <HI>de Guiche</HI>'s Coat he had left
near the Bedside, was going to pre∣sent
it to him, had not one of the
Dutchess of … Lady's who was
acquainted with the whole Intrigue,
snatch'd it out of his Hands, and
with much dexterity, he put the
Duke's Cloaths into his Hands, tel∣ling
him, <HI>the Duke would wear a
Blue Coat that Day;</HI> and the Young
Gentleman being innocent in the
Matter, took the Cloaths and dress'd
his Master.</P>
<P><HI>He was no sooner gone, but the
poor Count came creeping out from
under the Bed, trembling with cold
from Head to Foot, as if he had an
Ague; but care was taken to put
some fresh heat into him, which
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
done, they laugh'd heartily at the
dexterity of</HI> Tinote, <HI>and the Game
she had play'd with the Duke of
… Gentleman.</HI> I must confess,
Madam, said the Count as he sat, <HI>af∣ter
being somewhat recovered,</HI> that
the name of a Hearse, which I had
given to this Young Lady, suits exact∣ly
with her Genius, Wit, and Activity,
without which we had been all undone,
without any Reprieve. You see, Count,
<HI>reply'd the Lady smiling,</HI> That Love
has always some hidden Reserve or
other, to save us Lovers; and that we
must hope the same God will be our
Protector for the future: But I can ne∣ver
be at Ease, till I put a Trick up∣on
this Jealous Pated Duke. What
Trick do you intend to play him, Ma∣dam,
<HI>said the Count, looking stead∣fast
upon her,</HI> It will not be long be∣fore
you shall see it, be at rest, your Cu∣riosity
shall be satisfy'd at our next
Meeting.</P>
<P><HI>'Twas not long after, that the
Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>took his leave of
the Dutchess of … with a
<PB N="96" REF="100"/>
very melancholy Countenance, which
being soon taken notice of by her,
she told him with a Charming and
Engaging Air,</HI> whence proceeds this
languishing, dear Count, in your Eyes;
Take care you don't fall Sick, and pray
never dye any other Death but that of
Love, if you Love me. I will do all
that in me lies, Madam, <HI>reply'd the
Count very passionately,</HI> to preserve
my Life, since it is so happy as to be
Dear and Precious to you. Go, go,
that's enough, Count, <HI>said the Dut∣chess,</HI>
Remember, and prepare your
self for another Adventure, where Love
shall have its full Lustre of Pleasures,
and where you may … without any
Intermission. Very well, Madam, <HI>said
the Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>smiling,</HI> I will
endeavour to improve the next Time
and Opportunity to the utmost, and
to give you the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st convincing proofs
in the World, of my readiness to serve
you.</P>
<P><HI>No sooner had the Count left
his Fair Mistress, but he went to pay
a Visit to the Marquis of … his
<PB N="97" REF="101"/>
faithful Confident, unto whom he
gave a sincere Relation of all that
had happened. His Friend quite
surpriz'd at the oddness of the Ad∣venture,</HI>
I can't but tell you, Dear
Friend, <HI>said he,</HI> that you run incre∣dible
hazards, and that perhaps you
will pay at a very dear Rate for these
secret Pleasures and Enjoyments. How
to venture in such a manner your self
in a Royal Palace, to Hornifie a Prince
of the Blood, who, to be even with you,
ought to repay you in your own Coin, so
soon as ever you are Married, and to
take no less care of your Wife, than you
have done of his. I should not trouble
my Head much about these Fooleries,
<HI>reply'd the Count Laughing out a∣loud;</HI>
a Man may be a very honest
Gentleman, tho he wears a small pair
of Horns on his Front; because Horns
are the Emblem of Strength and Ho∣nour;
and never do any harm unless
you set them on fire. You say right,
Sir, <HI>answered the Marquis with a
pleasant Air,</HI> if all the Cul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l'd,
Horns should take fire <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> once, it
<PB N="98" REF="102"/>
would set the whole World in a Flame;
and for fear you should have the Mis∣fortune
of being comprehended in this
Ʋniversal Conflagration, I would ad∣vise
you never to think of Marrying,
because Marriage is a very dangerous
thing for Gentlemen of your Kidney.
Don't divert your self, Sir, any longer,
<HI>answer'd the Count coldly,</HI> at the
expence of your Friend, who keeps no∣thing
from you, rather congratulate my
Felicity and Happiness. I wish I could,
dear Friend, <HI>reply'd the Marquis,
rubbing his Forehead,</HI> I am so very
nice in that point, which you call
<HI>Fooleries,</HI> that I fancy already I feel
them tickling and coming out on my
Forehead. O! dear Marquis, whate∣ver
you do, never take a Wife, <HI>cry'd
the Count,</HI> for it will certainly be
your fate, 'tis an Inheritance belonging
to all Men. Plague on these Women,
<HI>answer'd the Marquis,</HI> they are tick∣lish
things. These Cocquets know too
well how to ensnare us whilst they are
Maidens, by their pretended good Hu∣mour
and Vertue, and some secret
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>
Charms Nature has bestow'd upon them.
To convince you of this Truth, dear
Friend, <HI>continu'd the Marquis with
much eagerness,</HI> I must tell you, that
just now I come from <HI>Mademoiselle
de la Bisque,</HI> who in my Eyes appears
to be as fair as an Angel, and this per∣fection
of her Body joyn'd to so charm∣ing
a Modesty, has put my Liberty in
danger, and rob'd my Heart of a great
part of its usual Tranquility. O! were
you but sensible what various Agitations
I feel within my Heart, in the presence
of so redoubtable an Object; Then pray
be sincere, Sir, <HI>said the Count,</HI> and
at last be free to own, that I am not
so much to blame, as you imagine, but
rather to be pity'd. Truly, Sir, <HI>reply'd
the Marquis,</HI> I scarce know whether
you are to blame or to be pity'd; for it
is your own fault not to make your
utmost resistance against a Passion,
which is likely to draw you into an A∣byss
of Miseries; I won't deny, but that
my Heart is not altogether proof against
the powerful Charms of a handsom Wo∣man;
but so soon as I find my Heart
<PB N="100" REF="104"/>
wounded by <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Dart, I retreat in
spight of all the Charms Love can lay
in my way to oppose it. I fight him
like a bold Soldier, and oftentimes lay
him at my Feet. Alas, Sir, <HI>reply'd
the Count with a deep Sigh,</HI> you
never were as yet wounded to the quick,
by his Darts, if this Deity should once
give you a home stroak, you would talk
at a quite different rate from what you
now do. The greatest Philosophers in the
World, are frequently put to a nonplus,
and use all their Strength upon such like
an occasion in vain. I find then that all
the Precepts of Vertue and Wisdom, I
have given you, are lost upon you, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Marquis arising from his
Seat, and taking his Hat and put∣ting
it close to his Head,</HI> Then
push on your Passion as far as it will
go, and as for me I will take care to
enjoy my happy Indifferency and Tran∣quility
as long as possibly I can. <HI>So
these two Gentlemen embracing one
another, parted for that time. The
Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>took his Road to∣wards
the Wood of</HI> Vincenne, <HI>his
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>
sual Solitude, where he spent his
time in ruminating upon the Advice
his Friend had given him, but 'tis in
vain to talk to a Lover of Danger;
wherefore we will leave him to his
own Thoughts, and see what the
Dutchess of—writ to him.</HI></P>
<P>“ALas! Dear Count, to Love
such a Person as you, what
Inconveniencies is one not obliged
to undergo! My whole Mind is
taken up with the Impressions you
have made there, and which pur∣sue
me wherever I go, and will
not leave me; let me do what I
can to keep them at a distance.
These Impressions, tho never so a∣greeable
to my Inclinations, never∣theless
are Enemies to my Repose
and Tranquility; Remember, my
Lovely Count, at what a rate I
purchase the Pleasure of seeing
you, and don't forget the Obliga∣tion
you owe me, because it stands
me in more than you. Make haste
to see me so soon as possibly you
<PB N="102" REF="106"/>
can; I will tell you of a very
pleasant Dream I had of you. A∣dieu

after his return from his Walk, kis∣sed
it a thousand times in the Pre∣sence
of the Gentleman, who could
not forbear Laughing at the passio∣nate
Transports of the Count, and
ask'd him, Whether he would send
an Answer to the Billet? <HI>Who gave
you this Billet, Sir,</HI> said the Count
much discomposed; <HI>It was given me
by one of the Dutchess of—La∣dies,
Sir,</HI> reply'd the Page, <HI>and I was
ordered to deliver it to you. Very well,</HI>
answered the Count going into his
Closet, <HI>I will write an Answer, which
I desire you to deliver to the same

Young Lady that gave you this.</HI> Whilst
the Page was waiting in the next
Room for an Answer, our Lover
quite confounded in his Thoughts,
was not able to find out any Expres∣sions
he thought suitable to shew his
Respect to his Goddess, and to dis∣close
to her, unto what a miserable
Condition he was reduc'd; a
thousand times he took Pen in hand,
and as often dropt it, wanting
strength to write his Thoughts;
but after all, addressing his Vows to
the God of Love, he took Courage,
and writ the following Lines.</P>

a peculiar Esteem for him; and that I
take as much care of every thing that
has any relation to him, as if he were my
near Kinsman; but I don't repent of
it, because he actually deserves it, you

The Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> was

Montespan <HI>wanted a Chamber maid,

being ask'd by the Lady what she
wanted with her;</HI> Good Morrow,
Madam, <HI>said Mrs.</HI> Pierette, I was told
you wanted one to wait on you in your
Chamber, and am come to offer you my
Service. Where did you live before,
<HI>said Madam</HI> Montespan <HI>looking her
in the Face,</HI> I lived, Madam, <HI>said
she, making a low Reverence,</HI> at the
Countess of …. a Lady the
hardest to be pleased of any Woman
living, and who will have every thing
done to the greatest nicety; For all
this, I had not left her Service, had it
not been for a great lusty Page of hers,
who would be always playing the Fool
with me, and dirty my Linnen, let me
do what I would: You know, Madam,
nothing ought to be so precious to a
Young Woman as her Reputation, and
how careful we must be in not hearken∣ing
to the Impertinent Discourses of
Men. You are in the right of it, <HI>said
<PB N="110" REF="114"/>
the Marchioness Laughing,</HI> but after
all, do you imagine, that the Females
in my Family are not as gamesome as
the Males? Don't deceive your self,
they love a little Play as well as the
great lusty Page you say loved you.
Alas, Madam, <HI>reply'd Mrs.</HI> Pierret,
<HI>with much reservedness,</HI> call you that
Love, when a Fellow tells his Foole∣ries
to a Young Woman like my self. I

And a thousand other such like Foole∣ries.
How, Mrs. Pierette, <HI>reply'd
Madam</HI> de Montespan, call you these

you know not the difference, it must be
<PB N="111" REF="115"/>
either for want of Judgment or good
Sense. That may be, Madam, <HI>an∣swered</HI>
Pierette, but be that as it will,
I can't dispense with the Addresses of
Men. You are a Rarity indeed, my

Young Woman as you are, not to be A∣morous!
I am nothing like it, Madam,
<HI>reply'd the disguised Duke with a
feign'd Modesty,</HI> I never found any
Inclination in my self that way, and I
can safely swear, that my Flesh and
Senses were never in Rebellion on that
account. At that rate you are a Saint,
<HI>said Madam</HI> de Montespan <HI>jestingly,</HI>
or else Nature must have spoil'd in you,
what it has bestow'd as a Gift upon other
People: For, the greatest Saints
tell us, that every Body of this World
is subject to Temptations and Human
Frailties. I can't tell, Madam, <HI>re∣ply'd</HI>
Pierette <HI>with a Blush,</HI> I have
felt my self all over, and can't find but
that I am like other People, except my
Heart, whose only Inclinations are for
such Lovely Ladies as you are. Oh!
how I love them, <HI>said the disguised
<PB N="112" REF="116"/>
Duke, with a Passionate Air, and
kissing her Hand,</HI> no Pleasure like
that of seeing and loving them. You
are methinks very familiar, considering
this is the first time you see me, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Marchioness with a scorn∣ful
Look,</HI> as far as I can see, you know
not how to behave your self. I hope,
Madam, <HI>return'd she,</HI> your Goodness
will pardon this Extravagancy, 'tis ac∣cording
to our Country way, when we
are eager to discover our Passion for a
Friend, and convince you how desirous
I am to serve you, pray, let me help to
Dress you. <HI>The Marchioness seeing
none of her Maids at hand, com∣ply'd
with her Request, and the dis∣guised
Duke acted the Modest Cham∣ber
maid to a Miracle, till the Lady
pulling off her Night-gown, and
shewing her naked Neck and Bosom,
(which was Beautiful to a Miracle)
he forgot the Part he was to act,
and</HI> Alas! <HI>cry'd he,</HI> Madam, no Man,
thanks be to Heaven, was ever able to
tempt me hitherto, but your Charms
have done it to the highest degree. Hah!
<PB N="113" REF="117"/>
good Woman, <HI>answered Madam</HI> de
Montespan, <HI>fixing her Eyes on her,</HI>
I verily believe you are something more
than a Young Woman. Don't be afraid,
Madam, <HI>reply'd the pretended Young
Woman kissing her Shoulders, which
happened to be naked,</HI> it is not in my
power to hurt your lovely Sex. Alas!
my Dear, <HI>return'd the Marchioness
much surpriz'd,</HI> I dare lay odds you
are an Hermaphrodite, and that is the
reason why you are not fond of Man∣kind,
or at least you share your Incli∣nations
betwixt both Sexes; you are not
fit for me, I must have one that I am sure
is a Woman. Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Pier∣rette
<HI>smiling,</HI> if you have a Matron in
the House, I am willing to stand the
search, she will convince you, if she un∣derstands
the Business, that I am a
Maid: For I can assure you, Madam,
I never lost my Maidenhead, as yet.
Would you take your Oath upon it,
Foolish, <HI>reply'd Madam</HI> Montespan
<HI>Laughing,</HI> Women of your Age sel∣dom
used to keep it so long, for fear
it should grow mouldy, and so they
<PB N="114" REF="118"/>
part with it for fear of the worst: Do
you say for fear of the worst, Madam?
<HI>reply'd</HI> Pierrette, <HI>fixing her Eyes on
the Ground with a pretended Mo∣desty,</HI>
for a Woman to part with so
precious a Jewel; I beg you, Madam,
to have a better Opinion of our Sex,
for my part mine shall be mouldy before
ever I will have a Thought of losing it;
I wish I may die on the Spot, if ever the
least Conceit or Motion of so hainous
a nature did enter my Heart. Well,
well, I will take your Word for it, my
Dear, <HI>answered the Marchioness with
much Indifferency,</HI> don't be uneasie
upon that score, there needs no Prote∣stations
nor Security for things of this
nature; and as for my part, I am very
willing to leave them to every ones Con∣science,
especially if they are ready to
confirm what they say by Oath. Yes,
Madam, <HI>said the Duke with a very
serious Air,</HI> thanks to St. <HI>Lucerne,</HI>
that pure and Chaste Virgin, who has
been always my Patroness, I am very
Innocent on that account: But, Ma∣dam,
<HI>continued he,</HI> now you are
<PB N="115" REF="119"/>
Dress'd, shall we make an end of our
Business? No, Mistress, <HI>said the
Lady coldly, observing something
that was odd in her Behaviour,</HI> I
will stay a little longer before I take a
full Resolution. Then farewel, Charm∣ing
Lady, <HI>reply'd the Duke of</HI> O—s
<HI>sighing,</HI> you will render me Ʋnfortu∣nate
as long as I live, unless I can
enjoy your …. Company, which
will be dear to me, beyond all the
Riches of the Ʋniverse. I know not
what to say to you, <HI>reply'd the Mar∣chioness
as she was going to leave
the Room; But, the Duke thinking
it now high time to discover himself,
threw himself at her Feet, and em∣bracing
them with a thousand Ca∣resses,</HI>
Don't you discover, Madam, <HI>said
he,</HI> him who Adores you, and who dis∣guised
himself for no other reason, un∣der
this Dress, but to have an Oppor∣tunity
of entertaining you with the
greater Familiarity; I have tasted a
thousand Pleasures in this Disguise.
You are very Ingenious, Sir, <HI>reply'd
Madam</HI> de Montespan <HI>seemingly sur∣prized,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="120"/>
in putting upon our Sex, you
are a Master in the Arts of taking what
Figure you please; the Goddess <HI>Miner∣va</HI>
her self, could scarce out do you in
that Part, which <HI>Jupiter</HI> had allotted
to her; for your Disguises are so well
contrived, as to be pass'd the Discovery
of the most quick-sighted. Then you
think, Madam, these Comical Adven∣tures
to become me very well? <HI>said the
Prince Laughing.</HI> Yes, Sir, <HI>reply'd
she with an engaging Air,</HI> nothing
in the World could be better contrived,
you acted your Part as nice now, as you
did t'other day that of the Shepherdess
on the Stage; for you can Blush and
look Pale when you please, which is of
no small moment in matters of this na∣ture.
I congratulate my self, <HI>added
he with a Tender Air,</HI> to have the
good Fortune to please you. 'Tis a con∣siderable
time ago, since I have made it
my Business to prove so fortunate, with∣out
having been able to attain to my wish,
till this Day; a day I look upon as the
happiest of my Life, and which I shall
remember for ever. Come let us act
<PB N="117" REF="121"/>
sincerely, Sir, <HI>cry'd the Marchioness,
with a Languishing Air, being very
desirous to have the Duke among
the number of her Lovers;</HI> now tell
me without dissembling the matter, do
you Love me a little? Whether I Love
you a little, Madam, <HI>continued the
Duke with a Passionate Air,</HI> what in∣duces
you to undervalue your own Me∣rits
at that rate? O! Incomparable La∣dy,
I Love you to a degree of Folly,
<HI>cry'd he,</HI> and unless you remove by
your Pity these Evils, whereof you are the
Cause, I am afraid it will cost me my
Life. You will die the same Death as
other Lovers do, Sir, <HI>said the Lady
Laughing,</HI> I mean in their Letters,
when they die and are revived again
when they please, or at least according
as the humour takes them. I read t'o∣ther
day in some Novel a Story of a cer∣tain
most Passionate Lover, who during
the absence of his adored Beauty, coming
frequently to a small Rivulet, to bewail
his Misfortunes, his Tears swell'd the
Brook to such a depth, that it is since
become a large River, and goes now by
<PB N="118" REF="122"/>
the Name of the <HI>Canal of Tears and
Sighs</HI> in the <HI>Isle of Love.</HI> Were you
ever in that Country, Madam, <HI>reply'd
the Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>with a Smile,</HI>
perhaps this is the same Isle where Lo∣vers
lose themselves. It may be so, for
that I know, Sir, <HI>reply'd she with a
seeming sincerity,</HI> but for my part, I
never saw that Isle, perhaps 'tis an un∣accessible
Place, or but lately discovered
by <HI>the God of Love.</HI> Let us take
Shipping, <HI>reply'd the Duke embracing
her,</HI> for that Place, let us embark up∣on
this Ocean of Love, and pursue your
…. Voyage as far as <HI>the God
of Love</HI> will conduct us, let us make
use of his point instead of a Rudder,
which governs the World, and will
guide us to <HI>the Vale of Love. Ma∣dam</HI>
de Montespan, <HI>who is none of
the quickest, did not much trouble
her Head to dive into the meaning
of this Riddle; she thought it suffi∣cient
to understand that she had en∣gaged
the Duke's Heart, (a thing
that pleased her to the highest de∣gree)
and that she was now upon the
<PB N="119" REF="123"/>
Point of entring into a Treaty that
was to be seal'd and sign'd by Love.
These pleasing Ideas as they aug∣mented
her Charms and engaging
Air, so these stood her in no small
stead to increase and fix the Duke of</HI>
O—s <HI>Passion, who generally loved
the Fair Sex only by Fits. These
two Lovers, after having spent some
time longer in Tender Expressions, and
given one to the other certain proofs
of their new Engagement took leave
of one another for that time.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas not long before it was
known at Court, that the Duke of
<HI>O—s</HI> was fal'n in Love with this
Lady; whereat some were pleased,
others displeased. Among the first
was the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who flat∣ter'd
himself, that this Amorous A∣musement
would divert the Duke
from his Jealousie, and in the mean
while took care to improve the
Duke's Absence to his Advantage.
The Dutchess of—who had
promised the Count to play the Duke
a Trick at their next Meeting, to be
<PB N="120" REF="124"/>
even with him for his Mistrustful
Temper, caused two Wooden Heads
to be made, one whereof resembling
a Man, the other that of a Woman.
These were laid in her Bed, their
Heads neatly dress'd. The Duke
happening to come home pretty late
that Night from Playing at Cards,
went softly into the Dutchesses
Chamber, drew near to the Bed, and
seeing two Heads there lying close
together Asleep, as he supposed, did
not in the least doubt, but that it
was his Spouse whom he had thus
catch'd. <HI>Now I have you,</HI> said the
Duke, <HI>you have play'd this Game, I
suppose often before, but now I am re∣solved
to revenge my self: I am resol∣ved,
Traytor,</HI> added he, casting a
most furious Look at one of the
Heads (which he thought resembled
the Count <HI>de Guiche) to run my
Sword in a thousand Places through
thy Body, to make thee expiate thy Crime.
And as for you, faithless Spouse, who
thus Sacrifice me to a Man so little de∣serving
your Favours, what must I do,
<PB N="121" REF="125"/>
to punish you according to your De∣serts,
for so enormous a Sin. Yes, yes,</HI>
continued the Duke almost distra∣cted
with Fury, <HI>you deserve both to
be Sacrific'd together, and nothing shall
hinder me from shedding your Blood.</HI>
At these words stopping a little, and
advancing to touch their Bodies, he
had only seen thro' the opening of
the Curtains hitherto, he found them
to be hard and without motion:
<HI>Alas!</HI> cry'd he, <HI>they have play'd me a
Trick,</HI> and so went to his own Bed-chamber
as soft as he could, without
any Attendance, in hopes that in so
doing his folly might remain undis∣covered.</P>
<P><HI>The Dutchess of—and the
Count</HI> de Guiche, <HI>who were lock'd
up together in a Closet adjacent to
the Bed-chamber where the Heads
were laid, were ready to burst with
Laughing, and said one to another
with a low Voice,</HI> The Fox is catch'd,
the Fox is catch'd, we have at last de∣ceived
thee in spite of all thy <HI>Argus</HI>
Eyes. I could never have imagined,
<PB N="122" REF="126"/>
Madam, <HI>said the Count Laughing,</HI>
the Duke to have been of so jealous and
mistrustful a Temper, and that he should
be addicted to it to such an Excess; I
should be very glad to know what were
his real Thoughts, when he said, <HI>Tray∣tor,
I will run my Sword thro' thy
Body.</HI> Are you so very dull, dear
Count, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess Smiling,</HI>
without all doubt he supposed it was
you that was in the Bed with me; did
not you hear him reproach me with In∣fidelity,
and on account of my Tender∣ness
for you? No▪ Madam, <HI>answer∣ed
the Count,</HI> I heard no more than
what I told you before, I was not near
enough to understand the remaining
part. I am very sorry for it Count,
<HI>answered she with a Sigh.</HI> And what
is it, most Divine Lady, <HI>reply'd he
with a most Passionate Air,</HI> that makes
you imagine that these Reproaches,
which doubtless would have touch'd me
to the Quick, and made me expire up∣on
the Spot, should in the least have
lessen'd the Value of those Favours you
are pleased to bestow upon me. Alas!
<PB N="123" REF="127"/>
Madam, <HI>continued he, throwing
himself at her Feet,</HI> I am too sensible
of those precious Pledges I received
from your Heart, knowing my self al∣together
undeserving of the least of your
Favours. You have exactly hit my
Thoughts, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess with
a Charming Air,</HI> and Mademoiselle
<HI>de Montaleto</HI> did give you no more
than your due, when she told me t'other
day that you were the most gallant and
the most engaging Person at Court.
How much am I indebted to you, my
Incomparable Lady, <HI>cry'd the Count</HI>
de Guiche, <HI>quire transported with
Joy,</HI> to raise the Value of what this
Young Woman was pleased to say of
me, to so high a rate; her Incense is
very inconsiderable in comparison to
yours, Madam; the least grain of
yours, sends forth a most odoriferous
Scent, which revives and rejoyces our
Hearts. And what Sweets, what In∣censes
are these, my dear Count, <HI>said
the Lady Laughing,</HI> I am obliged to
you for? I know not how I shall be a∣ble
to discharge so heavy a Debt. One
<PB N="124" REF="128"/>
favourable Look, Madam, <HI>reply'd this
happy Lover kissing her Hand,</HI> is
more than enough to pay a Debt not
worth your care; and how happy should
I think my self, were it in my power to
make a return for your Charming Good∣ness
and Infinite Favours: But alas, I
fear …. What is it you fear,
Count? <HI>reply'd the Dutchess looking
at him, and guessing at his meaning,</HI>
When one has truly engaged ones Heart
'tis no easie Task to have it again at
ones own disposal. Madam, <HI>reply'd
the Count full of Passion,</HI> your Me∣rits
ought to challenge an infinite Ac∣knowledgment;
such a one as a mortal
Man is incapable of giving you, since
the Homage and Incense of the World
can't reach your Deserts; but all I am
able to say, is far below what I feel,
and below all I would do, to convince
you of the sincerity of my Heart.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> O—s, <HI>who had
rested pretty well the remaining part
of the Night, believing that his
Spouse had been in Bed in some other
Room, because she would not be
<PB N="125" REF="129"/>
disturbed in the Morning, had ne∣vertheless
the Curiosity to rise earlier
than he used to do, in order to visit
his Lady, who had taken care to
send away the Count, and kept
Mrs.</HI> Montalet <HI>near her Bedside, un∣der
pretence of some slight Indispo∣sition.
The Duke being very impa∣tient
to know who it was that had
put the Wooden Heads into the Bed,
after having ask'd the Dutchess how
she did, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k'd her in a very rough
manner, What People she had about
her, that durst be so bold as to play
him such a Trick the last Night;
such a one as ought not to be put
upon a Person of my Rank.</HI> Alas!
what have they done to you, Sir, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Dutchess, dissembling the
Matter,</HI> who is it that has offended
or vex'd you? What they have done
to me, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Duke,
with a Serious Air,</HI> I suppose you are
not unacquainted with the Matter; but
if once I find out the Contrivers of
this malicious Trick, they shall have
sufficient reason to repent of it. But,
<PB N="126" REF="130"/>
Sir, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess of—
Laughing aloud,</HI> suppose I should tell
you it was I who contrived it, what
would you do to me in that furious hu∣mour
you are now in? I am afraid you
would pardon me no more than you
would the …. You contrive
it, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Duke look∣ing
stedfast at her,</HI> certainly you would
have more Generosity, than thus to put
upon a Spouse whose only delight is to
please. So that after all, Sir, <HI>said the
Dutchess in a Majestick manner,</HI> you
had but a very ill Opinion of this Ge∣nerous
Spouse, so that if she should
have put upon you, it was doubtless to
be even with you, for all those ill
grounded and unjust Notions you had
conceived of her: To be short, it was
conceived, that the Count <HI>de—</HI>
kept Company with the Dutchess of
—and that he being a very
Gallant Person, has a …. for
ingratiating himself with the Ladies
…. I know it very well, Ma∣dam,
<HI>reply'd the Duke coldly,</HI> and
that you say nothing but what is actu∣ally
<PB N="127" REF="131"/>
the Truth, tho it be spoken in jest;
'tis for this reason this so charming
Cavalier has got a place among the Ab∣bots
and Bishops of Fortune, who are
stiled the <HI>Black Dragoons of Gallan∣try,</HI>
because abundance of Ladies pass
thro' their hands; and it was under
this Sanctify'd Habit, the Count <HI>de</HI>
—Dragoon'd the other Night,
the Countess <HI>of the Green;</HI> whom he
run almost thro' the Body, tho without
doing her any considerable harm; and
I can tell you why he did not, it was
because this Gallant Dragoon found the
Hole made to his Hand by his Collo∣nel,
who had mounted the Breach be∣fore
him.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of—who had
related this enigmatical Story; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ief∣ly
to discompose the Dutchess on
account of the Count</HI> de Guiche,
<HI>thought himself in some measure
reveng'd for the Trick they had play'd
him; and tho the Dutchess wanted
not Sense to guess at his Intentions,
yet could she not forbear to enter∣tain
a strong Suspicion, that the
<PB N="128" REF="132"/>
Count was Unfaithful, and that he
often visited the Countess</HI> de Olone,
<HI>unto whom they had given the Ti∣tle
of the Countess</HI> of the Green <HI>at
Court, because she always hoped
for some fresh Favours from her Gal∣lants,
tho they treated her never so
indifferently, and that the Collonel
of the</HI> Black Dragoons, <HI>was the Duke
of</HI> O—<HI>who shared her Fa∣vours
with him without his Know∣ledge.
These Suspicions having put
the Dutchess of—into a very
ill Humour, (tho she dissembled it
as much as possibly she could) she
took this Opportunity of continuing
her Raillery in regard to the Game
she had play'd her Spouse, by way
of retaliation for his mistrusting her
Fidelity, which she said, was proof
against the most powerful Charms in
the World.</HI> 'Tis a difficult Task,
<HI>said the Duke with a Smile,</HI> to in∣dulge
ones Senses, without feeling the
Effects of their Enchantments; especi∣ally
such a Lady as you, who being all
Charms, whenever she attempts to resist
<PB N="129" REF="133"/>
those Temptations, she never fails to
meet with something or other which
deceives and draws her away into
the sumptuousness and Pleasures of so
engaging a Court as ours is; Remem∣ber
what a vast number of Sighs and
Addresses are made to; what Homage
are paid you, and how often they meet
with an agreeable Reception from you.
From me, Sir, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess
with a deal of Modesty,</HI> I never
minded any others but yours, tho' you
are very sparing with them. I am too
well versed in the Art of Love, Madam,
<HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI> not to understand
that it is no more than a charitable
Piece of Morality to give a favourable
acceptance to some Sighs that fall acci∣dentally
in ones way. Then, Sir, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Dutchess with much Indif∣ferency,</HI>
you may make use of this Gal∣lant
Morality, be sure to catch up all
the Sighs the Ladies send to you, both
from the right and left side. Yes, so I
will, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Duke mer∣rily,</HI>
when I think them worth my
while, and that they deserve it, because
<PB N="130" REF="134"/>
I intend to lay up good store of them.
But, <HI>continued he sighing,</HI> I should
be extreamly pleased, if the Dutchess
and Countess of …. would
afford me some of their Sighs, I would
be ready to return them, without suffer∣ing
them to remain in a languishing
Condition, and all this purely out of a
Motive of Charity, a Man can't well
refuse to these Fair Ladies, who aim at
every Heart that comes in sight of them,
I promise you, Sir, <HI>said the Dutchess
of—with a pretended In∣gaging
Air,</HI> I will, out of another
Motive of Charity acquaint them with
it, if you think fit, perhaps they are not
sensible as yet of those advantageous
Sentiments you have for them. That
may be, <HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI> I return
you many thanks for your most extra∣ordinary
and obliging care; but I have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to let them know it my self, I
will be the Messenger that carries this
News; I don't care for a third Person,
nor for any Confidents in Love. You
take it to a nicety, Sir, <HI>added she smi∣ling,</HI>
for at that rate you need not fear
<PB N="131" REF="135"/>
to be brtray'd, provided you can but
keep your Mistresses Favours to your
self. Mistresses, <HI>said the Duke with
a seeming Surprize,</HI> for a Person of
my Temper, Mistresses, I say once more!
The Countess <HI>d' Olone</HI> has not been
sparing to say, I am no Lover of Wo∣men,
and that my Inclinations are for
a worse Game▪ Nay, she has told it to
Father <HI>Anet</HI> and Father <HI>Bovanne,</HI> who
have spoke to me about it. And will
you pardon her such a piece of Impu∣dence,
<HI>said the Dutchess Laughing,</HI>
certainly she has found out a way of en∣dearing
you to her, because you treat
her so tenderly, whereas, if any Body
else had done so, there would have been
not the least prospect of a Reconciliation.
What would you have me do with her,
Madam, <HI>said the Duke,</HI> she is a Wo∣man
that will talk of every thing, whe∣ther
she knows any thing of the Matter,
or not; and for that reason, I never
mind her. Sir, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess
smiling,</HI> I would have you give a more
agreeable Turn to the Matter, say with
a Tender Air, I forgive her every
<PB N="132" REF="136"/>
thing, because I Love and Adore her,
and none but the Countess of <HI>the Green</HI>
is able to reach your Heart. I now no
more doubt, but that you was the Collo∣nel
of the <HI>Black Dragoons,</HI> who has
Dragoon'd her so often, which I never
knew before; but, <HI>continued she,</HI> the
Mouth will speak what the Heart is full
of; you have been so good as to tell it
me, before I enquired after it, imagin∣ing,
perhaps, I had not wit enough to
unfold so intricate a Riddle; the Fair
Lady has wounded you with her affect∣ed
Inticements, and you have given her
a Wound another way. Come, come,
Sir, another time keep your Love My∣steries
closer, and don't divulge them
in Figures to such a one as my self,
who has so near a Concern in it.
<HI>She had no sooner said these words,
but she went out of the Room, lea∣ving
the Duke alone in a very deep
Study, and not a little vex'd at him∣self,
for having said more than he
should have done; for whilst he
thought to put upon the Dutchess,
in relating to her on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Count's
<PB N="133" REF="137"/>
Gallantries, and reproaching her for
hers, he was catch'd in the Snare
himself; so that he was scarce in a
good Humour for a Month after.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Dutchess of—who
had conceal'd hither what had been
told her concerning the Count, could
not forbear one Night, when they
were indulging their Passion, by the
light of the Moon, to reveal it to

at what he heard her say,</HI> Madam,
<HI>answer'd he with a most Sincere Air,</HI>
you charge me with the blackest Infide∣lity
in the World; is it possible to ima∣gine
I should betray the Goodness and
Favours of the most Adorable Lady li∣ving?
No, no, entertain more advan∣tageous
Sentiments of my Heart, most
Divine Lady, and don't wrong me so
far, as to believe me Ʋnfaithful. I
know not what to say to the Matter,
Count, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess of—
with a Languishing Air,</HI> you are of
the same Stamp as all other Men are;
they love Change, tho' they were belo∣ved
by an Angel, 'tis Variety that

Charms them, and seasons all their
Pleasures: We must have something
that is new, say they, to move and
rouse our Spirits, a thing not to be ex∣pected,
from a worn out Passion and
Sighs. I can't deny, Madam, <HI>reply'd
the Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>Smiling,</HI> that
the first beginning of a Passion, has some∣thing
that is very Charming in it, but
when a Man once is in the Possession of
the Heart of so incomparable a Lady as
you are, all Novelties lose their force
and Charms; there is no Engagement
on Earth so strong, but what would
break its Chains to change them with
Joy for yours; and put the highest
pitch of his Felicity in wearing them:
The Greatest Kings of the World, <HI>ad∣ded
he with a very Passionate Air,</HI>
would envy my Happiness, were they
sensible of it. Without Dissimulation
or Flattery, Count, <HI>said the Dutchess
with a most ingaging Air,</HI> tell me
sincerely, does not this Lady do you a
Favour now and then? How many A∣morous
Robberies have you committed
upon her? If you will make an inge∣nuous
<PB N="135" REF="139"/>
Confession, you will much oblige
and please me. Would you have me
tell you, Madam, without dissembling
the Matter, <HI>reply'd the Count Laugh∣ing,</HI>
her Favours are too common to co∣vet
or to be fond of them; she is one
of those who are not very nice in a Gal∣lant,
provided he …. I un∣derstand
what you would say, Sir, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Dutchess of—Laugh∣ing,</HI>
but pray be good humour'd, and
give me a relation of one of your Noctur∣nal
Assignations, because I am inform∣ed,
that whenever you go there, it is
in the Night time, under the Disguise
of one of the <HI>Black Dragoons,</HI> or of
an <HI>Hermit.</HI> What is the meaning,
Madam, <HI>reply'd the Count interrup∣ting
her,</HI> of these <HI>Black Dragoons?</HI>
I never knew Gallantry to be Marshal'd
into a Regiment. I am apt to believe
it must be so, Count, <HI>answered the
Dutchess coldly,</HI> because they put, as
it seems you <HI>Cavalier Adventurers</HI> in∣to
the same Rank with the <HI>Black Coats
with little Bands,</HI> this is the Character
the Wits of the Town bestow upon you.
<PB N="136" REF="140"/>
A pretty Comparison! Madam, <HI>reply'd
the Count laughing aloud;</HI> but not
to forget your Ladiships Commands of
relating to you one of my Assignations
with <HI>the Countess of the Green.</HI> I
will tell you, I had the Curiosity one
Night to disguise my self like an Abbot,
knowing this Lady to be exceeding
fond of these Favourites of <HI>Venus;</HI> she
did not in the least suspect it to be me,
notwithstanding which, I never came
so much.. to the <HI>Critical Minute,</HI>
in all my Life time before, as I did at
time, had I been in a humour to im∣prove
it to the utmost of her Wish; be∣cause
she actually mistook me for one of
those <HI>Black Divinities,</HI> who used to
bring along with them the same Golden
Rain, which <HI>Jupiter</HI> pour'd upon <HI>Dia∣na;</HI>
but such was her forwardness, such
was her Confident Depertment, that
it quite check'd my Inclinations, could
I have had any for such a Woman as
she is. She lay in a loose Garb upon a
Couch, in so indecent a posture as was
enough to check a Man of my Kidney;
she had nothing but a Gawse Yellow
<PB N="137" REF="141"/>
Night-Gown wrapt about her, through
which you might see her Body almost
half naked, and her curl'd Hair spread
about her Neck and Bosom, which in∣deed
is none of the worst. She embra∣ced
me most tenderly, believing me to
be the Abbot <HI>de Bois,</HI> whom she is ex∣ceeding
fond of, tho he has not seen
him above twice or thrice in all her
Life. But 'tis impossible to tell you
how she loaded me with Reproaches and
Injurious Words, when she found me
not ready for her turn; so that I had
no other way left me than to decamp in
good time, and get out of her sight,
which I did, and swore heartily I
would never come near her again.</P>
<P>And have you kept this Oath, Count,
<HI>reply'd the Dutchess looking in his
Face,</HI> Lovers you know, will be Per∣jur'd
and Ʋnfaithful: Dont Blush,
<HI>continn'd she,</HI> for tho' it be not Day∣light,
I see your Heart betrays you in
spite of your self, and that now and
then you improve the <HI>Critical Minute,</HI>
under your Sanctify'd Habit.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="142"/>
Not in the least, Madam,, <HI>said the
Count Laughing aloud;</HI> but I will
tell you another Adventure, the most
delightful I ever met with since I was
born: I had disguis'd my self like an
<HI>Hermit,</HI> and in that Habit was surpri∣sed
in her Company by the Count <HI>de
Olone,</HI> her Husband, whilst I was en∣deavouring
to make a Convert of her,
and to infuse into her such Sentiments
as might lead her to a Holy Life; but
Alas! If you had but seen what a fright
my Penitent Lady was in, when she saw
him come in! However she had imme∣diate
recourse to her usual Inventions,
to amuse the poor Man, whom she told,
with a great deal of fawning Ingenui∣ty:
Sir, this is the so much celebrated
Father of the Order of St. <HI>Augustin,</HI>
for his singular Vertues and Morality,
who having left his Convent, is retired
into a solitary Grotto, to lead a more
Austere and Holy Life: He is, <HI>added
she,</HI> a true Saint in all respects; he
comes from time to time <HI>incognito</HI> to
<HI>Paris,</HI> to preach Penitence to Sinners,
and especially to such Sinners, as being
<PB N="139" REF="143"/>
addicted altogether to the Pleasures of
this World, are like lost Sheep, who
being gone astray, are upon the Brink of
tumbling into the Precipice of Hell.
<HI>The good Man being very ready to
believe every word she told him,
gave me a favourable Reception, and
you may imagine, I took care to act
the Hypocrite and Father of Peni∣tence
to the Life, and that when he
ask'd my Blessing, I was sure to give
it him very plentifully, wishing him
a thousand Temporal and Spiritual
Prosperities, and an Encrease of
Riches and Honours in his Family.
He was so well pleased with my ten∣der
Expressions, that kissing my
Hand, he pray'd me most earnestly
to stay at his House for some days,
which I liked extreamly well, being
at that time in Love with the Coun∣tess,
as she said she was with me.</HI>
Madam, I give you leave to guess, <HI>con∣tinued
he Laughing,</HI> what blessed Re∣formation
of Life I preach'd, and what
glorious Precepts of Morality I infused
into her; for I pretended to address
<PB N="140" REF="144"/>
my Prayers every Day to the Saints,
and all the happy Intelligences of the
Paradice after the Sanctification of all
such good Souls as the Count and Coun∣tess's
were.</P>
<P>One Night, Madam, as we were at
Supper, after having imparted them my
Benediction, <HI>the Count</HI> d' Olone <HI>ask'd
me with a Pious Look,</HI> unto what
Saint belonged that Holy Relick I wore
fastned to a thick Cord, wherewith I
ty'd my upper Garment instead of a
Girdle; and whether I found not a
great Inconveniency in my long Beard?
No, Sir, <HI>said I, lifting up my Eyes
towards Heaven,</HI> the hopes of attain∣ing
to Celestial Beatitude, makes us
poor <HI>Hermits</HI> insensible of every thing
on Earth, our whole time being taken
up with nothing but Pious and Sancti∣fy'd
Thoughts. Father, <HI>cry'd the
Count</HI> d' Olone <HI>touch'd to the Heart,</HI>
'tis true, we poor Mortals can't suffici∣ently
admire those Blessings Heaven
pours out upon such Persons as you are,
who are not in the least discomposed at
seeing your self debar'd from the Plea∣sures
<PB N="141" REF="145"/>
of this World, and of your Senses.
You are plump, have a fresh Colour, and
live with Content, tho' you feed in your
Hermitage upon nothing but Roots and
Milk Meats; these are strange Won∣ders,
past the Apprehension of so mise∣rable
a Sinner as I am. Sir, <HI>answered
I,</HI> I don't live at all times upon such
spare Dyet, it happens pretty often that
I feed upon all sorts of Meats, without
distinction, such as the Creator of Na∣ture
has bestow'd upon Mankind for
their Benifit; we are not forbidden by
the Rules of our Order, to eat Flesh and
other things upon an occasion, provided
we abstain from Women, a Woman be∣ing
the forbidden Fruit to us. But pray
Father, <HI>reply'd the Count with a
Compassionate Air,</HI> what can you do
when you feel the Temptations of the
Flesh within you? You, who are in the
Bloom of your Youth, aud in perfect
Health, certainly you undergo a kind
of Martyrdom in that respect, and
therefore this your Chaste and Glorious
way of living, deserves a high Reward.
<HI>The Countess, who was ready to
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>
burst out a Laughing, and look'd in
my Face, had almost spoil'd the
whole Sport, but soon recollecting
my self, and acting the Serious part
to a nicety, I told the Count with a
very Modest Air;</HI> Sir, I am sensible,
we are Men, and as such, like others,
are subject to the Temptations of the
Rebellious Flesh, but thanks be to my
good Angel, it never disturbs me; for
by incessant Prayers to that good Saint,
whose Relicks I wear about me, I have
overcome the World, and the Entice∣ments
of our Senses, I mean of those
Senses which operate by the Touch,
but not by those that act by the
Taste; for were I deprived of the
Taste, I could not, as for instance tell
you, that your Wine is admirably good,
as well as your Meats, wherewith you
and your Lady having pleased to enter∣tain
me, and for which I owe you a
thousand Obligations, not questioning
but that it will be doubly retaliated to
you by the Holy <HI>Fecunda,</HI> whose Re∣licks
I have by me. And good Father,
<HI>said the Countess taking them in her
<PB N="143" REF="147"/>
Hand,</HI> whose are the rest? I will tell
you, Madam, <HI>reply'd I fixing my
Eyes on the Ground,</HI> these are some
Hairs of the Honourable Parts of
St. <HI>Francis de Sale,</HI> and a small piece
of the Heel of St. <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s Slipper,
some of the Virgin <HI>Cletildi</HI>'s Toe-Nails,
which she used to let grow to a prodigi∣ous
length, and a small piece of St. <HI>An∣tonia</HI>'s
Maidenhead, which was found
after her Death enclosed in a certain
Rose in her Garden, which never fa∣ded,
but every Summer encreased in
Beauty. <HI>The Dutchess of—
who was extreamly pleased with
the Count</HI> de Guiche'<HI>s Relation, told
him, striking him gently on the
Shoulder and Laughing most hearti∣ly,</HI>
you are an arch Wag, Count, at in∣venting
so many Drolleries, pray, let
me desire you to go on. I will with all
my Heart, <HI>answered he in an oblig∣ing
manner,</HI> if I am not troublesome to
you, and you will be pleased to hear me.
No, no, <HI>said she,</HI> go on, you act your
part too well, to be soon tired with it.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="148"/>
The Count <HI>d' Olone,</HI> Madam, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Count</HI> de Guiche, who was
by when his Wife touching the Relicks,
would needs also touch them, and told
me with a great deal of Devotion; Oh!
good Father, whose is this little Skin?
Sir, <HI>reply'd I coldly,</HI> this is the Mai∣denhead
of St. <HI>Hypolita,</HI> who has gi∣ven
it into the Custody of the Founder
of the <HI>Hermits,</HI> who keep it each in
turn by succession, and who are bound
to preserve it entire as a most Holy and
Precious Relick. Oh! Father, <HI>cry'd
the Count,</HI> a most Sacred and Valua∣ble
Piece, you are entrusted with; sure∣ly
no Body must touch it except your
self, for fear of defiling it. Neither
do I suffer every Body to touch it, <HI>said
I,</HI> unless I know them to be Holy, and
not subject to the Temptations of the
Flesh. You are very much in the right
on't, Father, <HI>reply'd the Countess
acting the Zealot,</HI> to preserve these
precious Relicks undefiled, for every
Body is desirous to have some Relicks
of Saints, because they have a great
Vertue of curing People of many other∣wise
<PB N="145" REF="149"/>
incurable Distempers. I am very
sensible of that by my self, Madam,
<HI>cry'd I with a Pious Transport,</HI> alas!
had it not been for that very Relick
you now have in your Hand, how often
would my human Frailties have been
forced to succumb under the Burthen of
my Carnal Temptations; and how of∣ten
has this little Skin when I look at
it and considered of its Vertues, raised
and supported my Strength and Reason,
which was ready to drop and almost at
the last gasp. I believe it, Father,
<HI>said the Count</HI> d' Olone, pray let me
stand so far indebted to you, as to have
from your Hands one of your Relicks,
which I will promise to keep for your
sake, and to make use of upon occasion.
<HI>I unty'd immediately a small Box
hanging on my Cord, wherein were
some of St.</HI> Francis de Salle'<HI>s Hairs,
which I presented him with, where∣at
the good Man was so rejoyced,
(as imagining no otherwise than
that he had a great Booty) that he
return'd me a thousand Thanks and
Civilities.</HI> Where had you these Re∣licks,
<PB N="146" REF="150"/>
Sir, <HI>said the Dutchess of—
Smiling,</HI> you made so much noise of,
on purpose to put upon such poor simple
Wretches as the Count <HI>d' Olone</HI> is.
They were of my own making, Madam,
return'd <HI>the Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>coldly,</HI>
I spent, <HI>continued he,</HI> some Days lon∣ger
very merrily with the Countess, be∣ing
very kindly entertain'd by her <HI>good
Spouse,</HI> who often would give me an
Opportunity of being with her in pri∣vate,
in hopes I might make her a Con∣vert;
and to speak the truth, I gave
her most excellent Precepts of Morality
over the Left Shoulder, and put such
pleasing Instructions into her Mind,
that she soon became a very learned Scho∣lar,
and outdid me in little time in
the Practical part, having been under
the Tuition of several able Masters be∣fore:
At last, being obliged to take my
leave of my dear Scholar, her Husband
gave me a thousand Thanks for those
Pious Lessons I had bestow'd upon his
Lad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; in retaliation of which, I gave
him my Blessing, and of many other
Saints, and so ended the Story.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="151"/>
And can you believe otherwise, Count,
<HI>reply'd the Dutchess with a Serious
Air,</HI> that Heaven will not punish you
for thus acting your Fooleries under the
Cloak of Religion, and thus imposing
upon the Credulity of others, who mean
no harm? Truly I would not be in your
place for all the World. Lord, Ma∣dam,
<HI>reply'd the Count Laughing,</HI>
what would you have Young People do,
when they are in Love? Love and
Devotion seldom agree, long together,
and Young Lovers seldom trouble their
Heads much with Religion. I find it
is so, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess,</HI> by what
you have told me. But does the Coun∣tess
still receive so many Visits as she
used to do, from the Marquis <HI>de
Beuveron,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>de Castille,</HI>
that Young Rampant Bully. I believe,
Madam, <HI>reply'd the Countess Smi∣ling,</HI>
for I was told not long ago, that
at this time she is in Love with Abbots
to a high degree of Folly; and that the
two Abbots <HI>Villerceau</HI> and <HI>Fouqnet</HI>
attend her Day and Night; these
Gentlemen with little Bands are better
<PB N="148" REF="152"/>
Masters in the Art of Love, than poor
<HI>Jack de Castille</HI> is; with whom she
was forced to act her part to a Tutor,
and to instruct him what he was to do.
To speak the truth, <HI>continued he mer∣rily,</HI>
I pity a Woman of her Temper
when she is so hard put to it, as to be
forced to teach her Gallant his Lesson,
and guide him with her own Hand to
his Business. You are very unlucky,
Count, <HI>said the Dutchess with a plea∣sing
Air,</HI> thus to run upon the poor
Novices of Love; you would not have
every Body be as expert in that Art as
you? Tho, if I may freely tell you my
Sentiments upon that Point, I should
not much fancy such a raw and rough∣hew'd
Lover, it requires some Know∣ledge
and Experience, to venture upon
a Woman who has a tender Heart. You
say nothing but what is very true, Ma∣dam,
<HI>saith the Count</HI> de Guiche, a
Man that pretends to Gallantry, ought
to make himself Master of that Art, if
he intends to act with good success:
But, Madam, <HI>added he,</HI> what is your
Opinion, concerning Madam <HI>de Cha∣tillon,</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="153"/>
and her Love Intrigues? who
not satisfied with the tender Addresses
of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> makes not the
least Conscience of entertaining several
other Rivals, that are far below him in
every respect. And who do you think,
my dear Count, <HI>said the Dutchess,</HI>
are these Rivals; are they the Duke of
<HI>Nemours,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Coadjutor,</HI>
who rivals the Prince of <HI>Conde?</HI> O!
Madam, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI> these are
taken in only to make up the number of
her other Gallants; I know her Favou∣rite
Lover, 'tis Father <HI>Jambiac;</HI> she
Loves him as dearly as her own Life,
and shews all the Duke of <HI>Nemours,</HI>
and the <HI>Coadjutor's</HI> Letters to him. I
am strangely surprized at what you
say, <HI>Count, reply'd the Dutchess,</HI>
and were it not so very late, I would
desire you to relate me the whole Story
of it, with all its Circumstances.
<HI>Soon after Day-break beginning to
appear, made the Dutchess of—
sensible that the Presence of a belo∣ved
Lover, is seldom troublesome to
a Woman, and at the same time that
<PB N="150" REF="154"/>
it was time to part, for fear of being
surprized by the Duke of—
who was abroad at Play, and ex∣pected
home every Minute.</HI></P>
<P>The Count being withdrawn, and
the Dutchess got into Bed, enter∣tain'd
her self with the pleasing I∣dea's
of the great and rare Qualifi∣cations
of her Lover, his plesant and
diverting Humour, his engaging
Air, his Submission, his Respect;
and to be short, with every thing
that had engaged her Heart to love
him to that degree as she did. The
greatest part of her time, whilst she
was in Bed, being taken up with
these delightful Thoughts, she did
not rise the next Day till pretty
late.</P>
<P>On the other hand the Duke of
<HI>O—s,</HI> seemingly reflecting on
what the Dutchess had told him in
their late Quarrel, meaning the Coun∣tess
<HI>d' Olone,</HI> resolved to break off
that Intrigue, which was no hard
matter for him to do, considering his
Temper, which was not strongly in∣clined
<PB N="151" REF="155"/>
to Women: But to make his
Appearance at Court, in the station
of a Man of Gallantry, he would
needs act the Lover <HI>en passant,</HI> and
make his Addresses to the Countess
<HI>de Mora,</HI> who was so much admired
by the King himself, that he would
often say, in presence of many other
Fair Ladies, that were he not pre∣ingaged,
he would make his Love
Addresses to none but her self; for
which he was sometimes censured a∣mong
the Ladies, who would look up∣on
his Expressions, as somewhat diso∣bliging
in a Monarch, who always
profess'd a great deal of Gallantry
and Passion for the Fair Sex.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O—s,</HI> encourag'd
by the King, offer'd all his Addresses
and Sighs to the Countess, and made
her several most magnificent Presents.
One Day when the Ladies were a∣broad
a Hunting along with the
King, the Duke, disguised in a Gyp∣sies
Habit, placed himself in a Wood,
pretending to tell them their good
Fortunes. The Prince <HI>de Conti,</HI> and
<PB N="152" REF="156"/>
the Count <HI>de Lude,</HI> happen'd to come
by that way with some of the La∣dies,
call'd the Fortune-teller to
them, who told abundance of plea∣sing
Curiosities to several Ladies and
Lords, but more especially to the
Dutchess of—and the Coun∣tess
<HI>de Mora,</HI> who were both very
desirous to know of her what was
to besal them, to their Satisfaction,
in the future course of their Lives.
She was seated under an old crooked
Tree all covered with Moss, (where
she said she used often to take her
rest) and rising at last from her Seat,
took hold of the Dutchess of—
Hand; <HI>Thou art born,</HI> said she, <HI>un∣der
a happy Constellation; the</HI> Sun of
France <HI>was in its highest Exaltation
at the time of your Nativity; both the
great Luminaries, one whereof governs
the Day and the other the Night, were
in a favourable Aspect.</HI> The Dutch∣esses
Colour came into her Face, fear∣ing
lest this Sorceress should tell her
before all the Company, concerning
her Assignations with the Count <HI>de
<PB N="153" REF="157"/>
Guiche,</HI> took the first opportunity of
going from her, and putting the
Countess of <HI>Mora</HI> in her place; <HI>You
have told me enough, good Woman,</HI> said
she somewhat discomposed, <HI>here look
into this Ladies Hand, No, no,</HI> cry'd
the pretended Sorceress, <HI>draw nearer,
I have something more to say to you,
and which I can't forbear to tell you;
I read in your Physiognomy, that you
have a Heart full of Tenderness. How
canst thou tell that, good Woman?</HI>
return'd the Dutchess Laughing.
<HI>Madam,</HI> said she looking stedfastly
at her, <HI>I can tell it by your Hairs and
Eyes, which discover the true Inclina∣tions
of most People; Our Authors have
written abundance of things concerning
the difference of Hairs and Eyes; which
are, as</HI> Aristotle <HI>tells us, the Looking∣glasses
of the Soul, and the faithful
Interpreters of the Motions of our
Hearts. As far as I can see, good Wo∣man,
thou art a Learned Gypsie,</HI> said
the Dutchess interrupting her with
a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mile, <HI>where was it thou didst go
thro' thy Course of Philosophy? Every
<PB N="154" REF="158"/>
where, Madam,,</HI> said the feign'd Sor∣ceress,
<HI>I have learn'd a great deal by
Experience, having told to a Million
of People their Fortunes, whom I knew
to the very most hidden Secrets of their
Hearts, whereby and by the Conversati∣on
I have had with the most Famous
Magicians in the World, who obliged
me with their Instructions, I have at∣tained
to the full and perfect knowledge
of this Art. At that rate,</HI> said the
Dutchess of—retreating backwards,
<HI>Thou'rt a very dangerous Woman. Not
so much as you think for, Madam,</HI>
cry'd the Fortune-teller, <HI>I am very
Complaisant to Persons of Merit, and
shall be so in particular, to a Lady so
Charming as you are: Knowledge,</HI>
continued she, <HI>indues us with Mild∣ness
and an easie Temper, and makes
us never to do evil but but to such as
are so unfortunate as to deserve it;
then give me leave to tell you, what I
was going to say concerning your Hairs,
which are Fair, and your Eyes Blue;
such Persons are most commonly full of
Languishment and Love, sometimes be∣yond
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>
what is agreeable to their Hus∣bands;
following the Inclinations of
their Stars who guide them; and as
for you, handsome brown Lady,</HI> added
she, turning herself to the Countess
of <HI>Mora, you are of a brisk and spright∣ly
Temper, and subject to the same Ac∣cidents,
which are now so current, and
so much in Fashion in the World.</HI> The
Duke, who had forbore laughing
hitherto, could not contain himself
any longer from bursting out into a
laughter at the foolish Curiosity of
these Women, which made some of
the Company say, <HI>this Sorceress plays
the Fool with us:</HI> The King, who is
always very generous, ordered some
Pistoles to be given her, after which
every body gets on Horseback and
into their Coaches again.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> who had
caused his Hunting Apparel to be
brought to a place at a great di∣stance
from the Wood, soon threw
off his <HI>Gypsies</HI> Habit and put on his
own, which done he got on Horse∣back,
and overtaking the Company
<PB N="156" REF="160"/>
in a full Gallop, told them, <HI>he was
heartily sorry, some very important
Business had detained him, much a∣gainst
his will, at home, and robb'd
him for some time of the Enjoyment of
so charming a Company. O! Sir,</HI> cry'd
the Countess <HI>de Mora, what pity 'tis
you did not come a few moments soon∣er,
you wou'd have burst your self with
laughing, to hear what Tricks we were
told by a certain Gypsie, whom we met
with in the midst of the next Wood;
and what good News did she tell you,
Madam,</HI> answer'd the Duke with
much indifferency, <HI>who was it, that
diverted you so well.</HI> The Dutchess
of … who began to mistrust it
might be the Duke who had play'd
the Sorceress, tipp'd the wink upon
the Countess, to say no more of the
matter, and so no more was heard
of the Gypsie.</P>
<P>They went strait to <HI>St Clere,</HI> where
the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> had prepared
a most magnificent Repast, and a
Ball, whereat appeared abundance
of Masters. The Duke, whose In∣clinations
<PB N="157" REF="161"/>
were at that time altoge∣ther
bent upon the Countess, was
always at her Elbow, which was
no small addition to her Vanity, the
rest of the Lady's, who soon percei∣ved
it, from that time conceived a
most mortal spite against her, a
thing frequently to be observed a∣mong
Women, who can't without
a great heartburning see a gallant
Man offer his Incences and Homage
to their Companions. The Duke
delighted no less in his growing
Passion, than the Countess glory'd
in her Vanity; and 'twas this which
made the most refined at Court soon
make their Observations, that she
acted a Votive of Vain Glory, and
he out of a desire of being look'd
upon as a Man of Gallantry, and to
regain his Reputation in the Court,
some of whom entertain'd but very
indifferent Sentiments of him on that
account. 'Tis no wonder then, if
this Love Intrigue which had no∣thing
that was solid, or suitable to
its nature, to support it, was of no
<PB N="158" REF="162"/>
long continuance: Madam <HI>de Mon∣tespan</HI>
and the Countess <HI>de Mora,</HI>
unto whom the Duke had given
some account of this Passion, seeing
their Quarrel revenged in some mea∣sure,
by finding their Rival in the
same Rank with themselves, were
not sparing to enlarge upon the
Matter in their Discourses, which
coming to the King's Ear, he gene∣rously
took the Countesses part so
far, as to order them not to speak
of it any more, unless they intend∣ed
to disoblige him.</P>
<P>Mademoiselle de la Valiere, <HI>hap∣pening
to be one day in Company,
where they talk'd with much heat
of this Adventure, told them with a
loud Voice but a very engaging Air,
in the King's Presence;</HI> Sir, Our Sex
may now call themselves truly happy
and fortunate, because it enjoys the
Protection of the Most Potent King of
the Ʋniverse. O! <HI>Mademoiselle, re∣ply'd
this Monarch with a Tender
and Gallant Air,</HI> were all Ladies like
you, there would be no great occasion
<PB N="159" REF="163"/>
for taking their Part, and giving them
Protection: Their Merits alone would
be sufficient to support them against all
the attempts of the worst of their Ene∣mies
and to plead in their behalf.
Alas, Sir, <HI>reply'd she with a Lan∣guishing
Tone,</HI> it were to be wish'd,
that all Men had the same Heroick
Sentiments as your Majesty has; we
should not make such a despisable and
unhappy Figure in the World; but
good Heavens! How few are there who
can pretend to the same Character, and
treat us in an honourable manner!
This ought nevertheless, <HI>Mademoiselle,
reply'd the King looking stedfast on
her,</HI> to be the Character of a Man of
Honour, to act with Probity and Sin∣cerity
in reference to the Fair Sex;
what Advantage does a Man get in de∣ceiving
a Woman, and afterwards to
divert himself at her Cost? Certainly
nothing in the World can be more dis∣ingenuous
than such a manner of pro∣ceeding,
directly contrary to all the
Rules of Generosity, which ought to be
the inseperable Companion of Persons
<PB N="160" REF="164"/>
of a high Extraction; and therefore
we see, that these ill designing Methods
are most commonly practised by Persons
of a mean Spirit and Birth. <HI>The Duke
of</HI> O—s <HI>happening to come in,
no more was said upon that Head,
because he made the Conversation
run (according to his wonted Cu∣stom)
upon several trifling Matters;
soon after they went to Cards, till
the Company parted.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke who was very sensible
what a noise his Passion for the
Countess <HI>de Mora</HI> had made at Court,
thought it his best way to pass it off
by giving it merry turn; besides
that he told some entertaining Pas∣sages
relating to this Affair to Ma∣dam
<HI>de Longueville,</HI> where happen∣ing
to meet with Madam <HI>de Precy,</HI>
he made his Addresses to her, but
met with a cold Reception, that La∣dy
disdaining so much as to return
an Answer to his dissembling Sighs,
to his so much dissatisfaction, being
not used to see his Passion check'd at
such a rate. To divert his Mind
<PB N="161" REF="165"/>
from his Amorous Inquietudes, and
to put himself into a better Hu∣mour,
he thought fit to entertain
some of the Court Ladies with a
Divertisement upon the River, unto
which they gave the Name of <HI>Nep∣tune</HI>'s
Feast. The Duke of <HI>O—s</HI>
here represented the God of the Seas
with a Trident in his Hand, seated
on a great Shell drawn by Dolphins,
and follow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by a great number of
<HI>Tritons,</HI> who play'd upon a Seahorn
with Fish Bones. The Deserts were
served upon the River <HI>Seine</HI> by the
Nymphs and <HI>Najades</HI> adorned with
Green, and certain <HI>Syrens</HI> seem'd to
catch with Nets what was to be ser∣ved
up. They brought to the Ta∣ble
variety of Dishes of fry'd Fish
deliciously dress'd, the Dishes being
garnish'd with Flowers, which the
Goddess <HI>Flora</HI> had presented them
with for that grand Feast. No sooner
were the Tables clear'd, but Angling
Rods were brought to each of the
Ladies in small Enamell'd Baskets of
different Colours; some of them cast
<PB N="162" REF="166"/>
the Angling Hook and Line, in hopes
of catching something, but instead
of Fishes, they saw several Hearts
link'd to one another fasten'd to
their Hooks, as likewise certain A∣morous
Billets, two of which we
have thought fit to insert here.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Letter from the God of the Seas,
to the Dutchess of—</HEAD>
<OPENER>Beauty,</OPENER>
<P>“YOU who have fill'd our Wa∣tery
Pallace with so agreea∣ble
a murmuring Sound, which
without intermission puts me in
mind of your powerful Charms
and Enchantments, give me leave
to let you know what Charming
Impression this pleasing Murmuring
noise has made in my Heart;
which in the midst of the cool
Element, is all on Fire, and such a
Fire, as you your self have raised
into so fierce a Flame, that unless
you take care to extinguish it, I
<PB N="163" REF="167"/>
shall soon be reduc'd to Ashes.
Goddess of Hearts, Perhaps you
will tell me, 'tis in my Power to
extinguish it: No, the whole O∣cean
is not enough so much as to
cool, or to diminish its Ardour.
One of our Rivers, one of the
most Gallant ones that belongs to
our Empire told me t'other day,
of your bright shining Perfections,
and dwel't upon that Subject much
longer than I could have wish'd.
Alas! how do I read this redoubt∣able
Rival? Should he but for
once get out of this Watry Road
to entertain you, I am undone, I
have lost all my Hopes at once;
you will give ear sooner to his
Murmuring Addresses, than to
mine: But remember, my Adora∣ble
Dutchess, there is a vast diffe∣rence
betwixt Hearts; and, that
tho we were both made of the
same Mould, we differ very much
in our Qualifications, the one is
a constant, the other a fickle Lo∣ver.
The first is a Mind of rari∣ty
<PB N="164" REF="168"/>
in this Age, when the Gods, as
well as Men, take delight in chang∣ing
their Mistresses. I leave the
Choice to your Discretion. Fare∣wel,
Charming Lady: Remember
that the Tender Passion of a Deity,
such a one as I am, ought not to
be rejected.”</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Second Letter to the same.</HEAD>
<P>“SO long as I have carry'd my
Current thro' the World, In∣comparable
Dutchess, I never saw
so much Beauty, as that which is
natural to you. <HI>Venus</HI> who was
Born from the Ocean, can't chal∣lenge
the Precedency to you, and
I am apt to imagine, that the Gra∣ces
themselves, her Favourites,
have left her, to enjoy your Com∣pany:
Her own Son told me so
this very Morning when he saw
you, and at the same time struck a
most dangerous Dart into my very
Heart, one of those this Malicious
<PB N="165" REF="169"/>
Child had pitch'd upon a very
great number of others he always
carries about him to disperse them
over the Universe, and to make it
submit to his Empire. Alas!
Lovely Goddess, this stroak has
touch'd me so to the Quick, as to
find it almost insupportable. How∣ever,
since I have observed a cer∣tain
Charming Sweetness in your
Eyes, which seem to promise Tran∣quility
to such Unfortunate Men,
as you have been pleased to make
so, I have not lost my hopes:
Don't therefore turn away those
Languishing Stars which afford us
such great and pleasing Influences,
and which speak so much in my
behalf; I can't forbear to tell you,
to my Grief, that all our Rivers
are fallen in Love with you; and
that in the vast extent of our Em∣pire,
we hear scarce any thing Day
and Night, but their tender Mur∣murings,
every one of them shew∣ing
a great Eagerness of knowing
and serving you. But, amidst all
<PB N="166" REF="170"/>
these Applications so full of Ar∣dour
and Tenderness, believe me
Fair Dutchess, there is none who
either in his Passion or Submission
exceeds him of the River—
who will be yours for ever, with∣out
Reserve or Change, if you
will but Love him.”</P>
</LETTER>
<P>How! I, <HI>said the Dutchess after
having read the Billet,</HI> I Love Ri∣vers;
no, no, they are not for my pur∣pose;
I don't like such Phlegmatick
and Fickle Gallants; I don't Love so
much Coldness: And besides this, how
can these Deities who are always in
motion, talk of Constancy? They, I
say, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nange without intermission,
and who run through the whole Earth
with their rapid, and always moving
Currents; they were made for Sea and
River Nymphs, and not for such real
Terrestial Numphs, such as I am.
How Madam, <HI>reply'd a certain Gen∣tleman
who stood near her,</HI> do you
imagine, that the Deities of the Seas
and Rivers Love only in Imagination?
<PB N="167" REF="171"/>
Pray be not thus mistaken, but take my
word for it, they used not to grasp the
Shadow instead of the Substance; we
will leave the Matter to the Decision of
the Duke of <HI>O—s,</HI> he shall be our
Arbitrator. <HI>The Duke who had cau∣sed
these Billers to be fastned to the
Hooks, with no other intention than
to cast them among the Ladies, like
the Apples of Discord, to sow Di∣visions
betwixt them, every one of
which flatter'd her self to meet with
a</HI> Paris, <HI>who would decide in her
behalf, could not forbear Laughing,
to see what Jealousie this Piece of
Gallantry had kindled among the
Ladies, who look'd upon the Dutch∣ess
as their Common Enemy. This
made the Duke, who had kept at
a distance from her hitherto, draw
nearer, and tell Madam</HI> de Lile <HI>and</HI>
de Lude <HI>with a Smile:</HI> Well, Fair
Ladies, what is your Opinion of the
Charms of the Dutchess of—
which make so much noise on the <HI>Oce∣an,</HI>
and have engaged the Hearts of all
the <HI>Rivers?</HI> My Opinion, Sir, is,
<PB N="168" REF="172"/>
<HI>return'd the first with a great deal of
Modesty,</HI> that she is no less powerful
on Earth, as on the Water, and that
wherever she comes, she proves dange∣rous
to Mens Hearts, and they are sure
to lose their Liberty. Perhaps, Sir,
<HI>added she Smiling,</HI> yon have made
a trial of it, notwithstanding your usu∣al
Indifferency for our Sex. Who can
question it, Madam, <HI>reply'd Madam</HI>
de Lude <HI>with an Envious Air,</HI> be∣cause
you disguise your self for no other
reason, than to have a fair opportunity
of declaring to her the tender Senti∣ments
she has inspired you with, which,
as it seems, are of a fiery nature. Alas!
it belongs only to the Dutchess of
—<HI>continued this Lady merri∣ly,</HI>
to set Men's Hearts on Fire to
such a degree, and to lay the whole
World in Ashes, before all the Waters
of the Ocean are capable to extinguish
it. Who has told you, Madam, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Duke,</HI> that it was on her
Account I took this Disguise? I know
it, Sir, <HI>said the Countess with a pre∣tended
Gravity,</HI> by a certain Fore∣sight,
<PB N="169" REF="173"/>
and by the trouble you give your
self, knowing you to be very backward
in entring the List of the Champions of
Love. So, so, Madam, <HI>reply'd the
Duke laughing aloud,</HI> then you think
I am at this time advanced a great
way in the Road of <HI>Venus;</HI> you think
I am come already to that fine small
Path where we often lose our selves as
well by Day as by Night, let a Man be
never so expert a Traveller in the Em∣pire
of this Goddess. <HI>The Dutchess
who was retired into a private
Room, to write an Answer to the
Letters address'd to her, by the Wa∣tery
Diety's, returned to the Com∣pany,
and told them with a merry
Air, she had found out a lovely</HI>
Triton, <HI>who being the prittyest Lad
in the World, would serve her in
the quality of a Page. Soon after,
the same</HI> Triton) <HI>who was one of her
Cosins) appeared disguised under
the Habit of one of</HI> Neptunes <HI>Sub∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts,
and presented to the</HI> God of
Jupiter <HI>a Letter neatly folded toge∣ther;
<PB N="170" REF="174"/>

corner of the Room, read the fol∣lowing
Lines,</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Letter to the most Potent God
of the Seas and Rivers.</HEAD>
<P>“I Am much surprized, great Prince,
how those Diety's that are so
redoubtable upon the Waters,
should Sigh for a Mortal, beyond
who's Power it is to make them a
suitable Return. Doubtless you
don't call to your Remembrance,
that in the vast extent of your
Kingdoms and in your Palaces,
you are not destitute of Beauties,
a thousand times more engaging
than I am, and consequently much
more capable of inflaming your
Hearts, that do cry continually
among the Caves. What you
mention concerning your Con∣stancy,
I can scarce imagine it a
Virtue belonging to you, unless
you appear under the Disguise of
<PB N="171" REF="175"/>
some Watery God or River. You
your self told me, that the Wa∣tery
Deities as well as those of
the Heavens, are addicted to
Change, and that <HI>Jupiter,</HI> the God
of Thunder, and the Head of all
the rest, has not been exempted
from this frailty. Farewell, I take
my leave of you, with this Pro∣testation,
that I shall never be in
Love with them, because such
liquid and cold Lovers, are not
very suitable to my relish.”</P>
</LETTER>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Dutchess of ….</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>could not
forbear laughing for some time, after
the reading of this Letter, not que∣stioning
but that the Dutchess, who
was Mistress of a great share of it,
had very well apprehended the
whole Mystery of his Design, which
was to make her believe, if he could,
that he was in Love with her; for
this Lady who had been overcross'd
<PB N="172" REF="176"/>
with Lovers, some sincere, others
inconstant, knew by experience how
to discern a true Lover from a pre∣tended
one; so that it was no easie
matter to impose upon her in point
of Love, no more than in any other
Business of Moment. The Duke
being sensible that his Goddess had
very handsomely upbraided him with
his Boldness and Inconstancy, by
disguising the Stile in the same man∣ner
as he had done before, rejoyn'd
the Company with a merry Coun∣tenance,
singing the First words of a
certain</HI> Opera, <HI>which begins thus:</HI>
We are frequently deceived in our
Hopes and Fancies. That is very true
Sir, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess of—
with much indifferency, and most
especially in Love Affairs, where
our hopes being built upon</HI> un∣steady
Foundations are frequently
subject to Change. I can't deny that
<HI>said the Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>laughing,</HI>
when one thinks one has …:
Heart in ones own Hand, it often gives
you the slip in spight of all your Care
<PB N="173" REF="177"/>
and Caresses to keep it. What a dread∣ful,
what a capricious thing this Love
is, which very rarely suits itself to our
Inclinations, but suffers us to languish,
the better to obtain its own ends. I
can't imagine, Sir, <HI>reply'd she with
a smile,</HI> that ever you received any
dangerous Wounds in the Field of <HI>Ve∣nus,</HI>
because I suppose you never laid
so near Siege to any Place of strength,
How do you know that, Madam, <HI>said
the Duke with a forced Complai∣sant
Air,</HI> I much doubt it, <HI>reply'd the
Dutchess turning at him, and laugh∣ing
as loud as she could,</HI> you are ve∣ry
unlucky and malicious, Madam,
<HI>return'd the Duke, throwing him∣self
at her Feet with a most passio∣nate
Air,</HI> will you treat me thus in∣human
for ever? will you have no
Compassion upon a God, whom you have
compelled to make his Appearance here
on Earth, to declare to you, that he
Loves you beyond all the Goddesses of
his Empire; and that none of his
Beauties of the Watry Element, could
ever touch his Heart as you have done.
<PB N="174" REF="178"/>
I can't imagine it to be Love, Sir, <HI>said
the Dutchess, coldly laughing, and
fixing her Eyes on him;</HI> what wou'd
you have me do, cruel I ady, <HI>said the
Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>interrupting her,
and setching some very deep Sighs,
whilst he kiss'd her Hands with
much Transport,</HI> your present De∣portment
seems to be without Disguise,
and to proceed from a sincere Heart,
<HI>added she with an engaging Air,</HI> but
you would doubtless pass for the <HI>Phe∣nix</HI>
of our Age, could you oblige the
Fair Sex with what they have search'd
for so long in vain. I mean the <HI>Philo∣sophers
Stone.</HI> You meant, <HI>said the
Duke, turning the Sense another
way,</HI> such as have never seen or known
it: But take my word for it, Madam,
I will give it you to touch, and make
you sensible of all its Vertues, when it
is apply'd as it ought to be. Sir, <HI>said
Madam</HI> de Lude, <HI>with a seeming In∣nocence,</HI>
is this Stone good for Disea∣ses?
O! most admirable, good Ma∣dam,
<HI>answered the Duke Laughing,</HI>
but especially for Women in a Languish∣ing
<PB N="175" REF="179"/>
Condition, it has a particular Ver∣tue
to open the Obstructions of the
Spleen, and rejoyce the Heart; nay, it
cures all external and internal Distem∣pers.
What the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> is
pleased to tell you, Madam, is nothing
but the Truth, <HI>said the Count</HI> de Vi∣ronne;
there is not a more Sovereign
Remedy in the World against Pale Fa∣ces
and … At that rate Count,
<HI>said the Dutchess of … jest∣ingly,</HI>
this Medicine would be very
proper for one of my Young Ladies,
who is always Languishing and out of
Order. Put her into my Hands, Ma∣dam,
<HI>reply'd the Count Laughing,</HI>
provided she be but Handsome, I will
promise to Cure her, and it shall not
cost you a Farthing: I am a Physitian,
who at first sight can dive into the Di∣seases
of a Young Woman, and never
fail in my Cure. Very well, Good
Doctor, <HI>said this Lady,</HI> provided she
is Handsome, then she pleases you; but
what if she should prove not so by
chance, then the poor Creature must die
a Martyr without Relief: You are an
<PB N="176" REF="180"/>
odd sort of a Physitian, who have no
Remedies but for Young and Hand∣some
Women. I don't know what to
say to that, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Count
arising from his Seat,</HI> but this I know,
that my Art will not go beyond its
Bounds. Push on your Knowledge to
the utmost Point, Count, <HI>said the
Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>laughing and clap∣ping
him upon the Shoulder,</HI> let us
see what fine Cures you are like to per∣form.
This is my daily Business, Sir,
this is all my Cure, <HI>reply'd he smiling,</HI>
and if I meet with good success, I will
not fail to let you know it, in hopes
you will congratulate my good Fortune.
I judge you will have a care of that,
<HI>reply'd the Duke merrily,</HI> such Phy∣sitians
as you, are seldom fond of a
Confident, or of a third Person when
they perform their Operations, or are
making some pleasing Composition for
the Ladies. <HI>Monsieur</HI> de Turenne,
<HI>and the Prince</HI> de Conde, <HI>who had
been talking very seriously in one of
the Green Walks, concerning Mat∣ters
of State, then coming into the
<PB N="177" REF="181"/>
Apartment where the Company was,
made the Conversation soon run up∣on
the Affairs of War, and some o∣ther
Concerns of Moment, whilst
the Duke of</HI> O—s <HI>and those that
had attended him laid by the Dis∣guise,
after which they diverted
themselves with walking in a Mea∣dow
covered with Flowers, in the
midst whereof was a very curious
Spring, unto which Madam</HI> de Lude
<HI>gave the Name of</HI> N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcissus, <HI>because
she observed the Count</HI> de Vironne
<HI>busie in looking into and admiring
his Beauty in an adjacent Brook,
which had its rise from thence. The
Dutchess of</HI> Nemours, <HI>who was not
unacquainted with the Count's Amo∣rous
Inquietudes, who was indulg∣ing
his Splenetick Thoughts, joyn'd
her agreeable Voice with the melo∣diousness
of the Birds, under some
Trees, and Sung the following
Words:</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="178" REF="182"/>
<L>Whence proceeds this Extremity of
my Misfortunes?</L>
<L>My Heart is not satisfy'd with
whatever I do:</L>
<L>Oh! Little <HI>Cupid,</HI> who once was the
Object of my Scorn,</L>
<L>Are not these Misfortunes the Ef∣fects
of thy Revenge?</L></Q>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>said the Count</HI> de
Vironne <HI>accosting her,</HI> my Complaints
are founded upon another Motive, Love
has not as yet triumph'd over my Heart
nor subdued my Strength. Then you
are very happy, Sir, <HI>cry'd the Dutchess
with a Sigh,</HI> among all the Passions
unto which Mankind are subject to,
none is so dreadful and powerful as
Love; even its Pleasures have an in∣termixture
of Cruelty; not withstanding
which, they are the chief Objects of all
our Wishes, and all other Pleasures,
without these, make but a slender Im∣pression.
Don't dissemble the Matter,
<HI>continued she Laughing,</HI> were not
these Sighs I heard you send forth near
<PB N="179" REF="183"/>
the Banks of this Brook, the effects of
a tender Passion? And I know very
well, that Charming Person to whom
they were directed: But perhaps, you
are afraid, as indeed it is natural to all
Tender Hearts to be, that even the
strongest Tyes and Knots may be worn
out in time, and that even the most A∣morous
Heart that can be, may recover
its Tranquility or change for a new
Passion. <HI>The Count was just going
to make a suitable return to the
Dutchess, when the Company com∣ing
up with them, they saw them∣selves
obliged to break off this Con∣versation,
and Night beginning to
draw near, every one prepared for
their return home.</HI></P>
<P>The Dutchess of—who
had no inclination to be present at
this Feast upon the Water, because
she intended to bestow these precious
Hours in the Duke's Absence, in en∣tertaining
the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who
did not leave her for one moment
all that while; in retaliation of
which, she told him all the most
<PB N="180" REF="184"/>
Tender and most Passionate Things
in the World, as that she loved him,
if it were possible, even beyond her
own self, that she had never loved
any thing like him in all her Life:
The Count returning these Demon∣strations
of Tenderness with the most
Gallant Expressions that can be con∣ceived,
these two Lovers, full of
Content, enjoy'd all the Happiness
so uncommon a Love as theirs, is
of, when they heard the Duke of
<HI>O—s</HI> was come. You may guess
at their Disquiet, when they found
themselves thus disturbed in the
midst of their Pleasures, the Count
being then at the Feet of his Ado∣rable
Dutchess. This made him fetch
a very deep Sigh, and then arising
from the Ground, he made all the
haste he could to get away (accord∣ing
to the Dutchesses Directions) by
a pair of private Back Stairs, belie∣ving
that the Door had been open;
but as ill Fortune would have it, the
Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> having taken the
Key along with him, was just then
<PB N="181" REF="185"/>
coming up the Stairs, with an Inten∣tion
to come unawares upon the
Dutchess, whom he supposed to be
alone. The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who
knew his Steps, had no other way
left him, than to go back to the
Dutchess of—Apartment,
which she had Lock'd, being gone
into another Room, as not doubt∣ing,
but that he was got away safe
enough; so that the poor Count,
seeing not the least Opportunity to
conceal himself, leap'd out of the
Window into a Gallery, and so run
away as fast as Lightning, wrapt up
in his Cloak: In this Posture, he
pass'd several Centinels, who know∣ing
him by sight, and guessing, tho'
at a distance, at the matter, let him
escape undisturbed. The Duke
of—who had heard some
noise on the top of the Stair-case,
and in the Dutchess of—
Room, took a great deal of Pains to
search every corner thereabouts, and
calling for Candles, as they were
brought up, and looking upon the
<PB N="182" REF="186"/>
Stairs, whether some Troublesome
Spirit had not taken up his Residence
there, the Dutchess of—Pi∣cture
was found there enclosed in an
Enamell'd Case with the Count's
Name in Cyphers above it, besides
a most Passionate <HI>Billet deux,</HI> the
Dutchess had sent him that Morn∣ing;
and which the Count, dread∣ing
the Duke's Presence no less than
a Burnt Child does the Fire, had
dropt, together with the Picture, as
he was running away. As good
Fortune would have it, this Precious
Jewel happened to fall into the
Hands of one of the Dutchess of
—Ladies, who had the Wit
to hide it, as soon as she found it.
One of the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> Gentle∣men
seeing her put it up in her
Pocket, urged her much to let him
see what good thing she had met
with, but she remembring that it
must belong to the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI>
who had been all that Day with the
Dutchess, would not grant his Re∣quest.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="187"/>
<HI>The Duke of—was no soon∣er
a little appeased, and the noise
over, but this Young Woman, who
was very trusty to the Dutchess, ha∣ving
look'd upon the Picture, and
finding whose it was, went to the
Lady's Apartment, and told her with
a Smile;</HI> Madam, you can't imagine
how ill an Humour the Duke is in
to Night; I believe he fancies he is
haunted with Visions, he has search'd
every corner in this part of the Palace;
and had it not been for me, he had
found upon the little Back Stairs, a
Picture-case, belonging to the Count <HI>de
Guiche,</HI> which he lost as he was going
away. Alas! what do you tell me, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Dutchess blushing;</HI> poor
Count, has he dropt the Case wherein he
put my Picture with so much care?
Pray who has found it? Madam, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Young Lady Smiling,</HI> I
guess 'tis in the Hands of a Person,
where Fortune thought fit to put it.
Perhaps in yours, my Dear, <HI>reply'd
the Dutchess looking in her Face.</HI>
Yes, Madam, thanks to Heaven, Chance
<PB N="184" REF="188"/>
would order it so, <HI>return'd she pre∣senting
it to her.</HI> 'Tis certain, Ma∣demoiselle,
<HI>said the Dutchess,</HI> the
Duke is of a very odd Temper, his Jea∣lousie
and Mistrust will never leave
him, till he goes to the Grave; what
could come in his Head to make him
come up by this pair of Stairs to my
Apartment, and to raise such a distur∣bance
there; but after all I can't for∣bear
Laughing, when I consider what
a Fright he put the poor Count in, who
no more than my self expected his com∣ing
home so early; O how heartily he
vexes by this time, when he misses his
Picture-case out of his Pocket. No
doubt on't, Madam, <HI>reply'd the young
Lady,</HI> we are often much concerned for
things of less Value, and this is of the
greatest consequence to him; for since
you had so much Goodness as to bestow
your Picture upon him, it must needs
be very dear and precious to him. I
could wish my self at this time, my
Dear, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess of</HI>—
to be the same Picture the Duke fancied
was upon the Stairs, that so I might be
<PB N="185" REF="189"/>
a Witness of his Inquietude and Vexa∣tion;
what pretty Names, I warrant
you, he gives to himself, how he calls
his Destiny Ʋnfortunate, how often he
accuses his Ill Fortune with being dull,
blind, without discretion, and I know
not what all, because, forsooth, she would
treat him at that rate? I durst say,
never was a Man as he thinks at this
time, born under so malignant a Pla∣net,
which makes every thing he under∣takes
to turn to his Destruction. These
extravagant and hyperbolical Expressi∣ons,
Madam, <HI>said Mrs.</HI> Mantales
<HI>Laughing,</HI> are frequent among Courti∣ers,
and Passionate Lovers, who are sure
to magnify every thing at least by one
half. They never feel any indifferent
Pains, nor slight Punishments; in the
Empire of Hearts, the Men seldom
shed any Tears in any lesser Quantity
than what would make us a good hand∣some
River, sufficient to bare Vessels of
Burthen; sometimes they die a thou∣sand
times in a Year, without so
much as having the least Thought of
Death. Such Figures and Embellish∣ments
<PB N="186" REF="190"/>
Love furnishes its Admirers with
to appear the more Gallant, and talk in
the true Language of Lovers, nothing is
more common and in the Mode, than
for a Man when he lies at the Feet of
his Mistress, to tell her, <HI>That un∣less
she has Compassion upon him
and his Miseries, his infallible Fate is
at hand, that he must die a Martyr
of Love, that she must needs be of a
very cruel and inhuman Nature, to
be insensible and without Pity for a
Lover in Despair.</HI> These are the dai∣ly
Offerings these Gentlemen regale us
withal, were we but Fools enough to
believe what they say, their Sighs would
soon be at an end: But Madam, I can
frankly tell you, <HI>continued she,</HI> that
nothing vexes me more, than when I see
some of your Sex thus cajoled away by
these Grimaces of a Gallant: I wish to
Heavens, <HI>cry'd she,</HI> I was endued with
such Qualifications, as to make them
fall in Love with me, I assure you, I
would pretty well secure my Conquest,
before I would suffer them to enjoy the
least rest; Opposition adds to the Plea∣snre,
<PB N="187" REF="191"/>
whereas if the Conquest prove ea∣sie,
it soon loses its Value, and true
Relish. <HI>The Dutchess of—
who delighted extreamly in the
Company of this young Woman,
who had a great deal of Wit, and
was highly beloved by her Mistress,
could not forbear Laughing, and
told her,</HI> At that rate, my Dear, you
would be very cruel to your Lovers;
they would be very Ʋnfortunate, and
not very long liv'd under so Rigorous
a Government as yours. Madam, <HI>re∣ply'd
she with a pleasing Air,</HI> I ne∣ver
had many Adorers, but such as
Destiny sent in my way, I took care to
make them sensible, that nothing is
actually Charming, unless it be dearly
bought; a Rigorous and fierce Deport∣ment
are infinitely becoming a Woman,
especially if they are Aimable and
Charming: 'Tis one of the most com∣mendable
and most peculiar Ingredients
to keep their Gallants; I think nothing
more easier in the World, than for a
Woman to get a whole Tribe of Sigh∣ing
Admirers, but 'tis a difficult Task,
<PB N="188" REF="192"/>
'tis a Rarity to keep them for any time.
These are the chief Qualities of Gal∣lants,
in like Trifles they bestow their
Talent, <HI>said the Dutchess Smiling,</HI>
but after all, don't you believe, that
one Sex as well as the other, are tired
out with those old worn out Sighs, they
have been pester'd with for many Years
together, and which being nothing but
Repetitions of the same thing, make no
further Impression upon us. You know
there is but one God of Love in the
World, who infuses his Sentiments,
which are unalterable and not to be re∣new'd;
whence it is, that old Lovers
have always the same Notions, and
make use of the same Language; where∣as,
on the other hand, a new Passion
furnishes us every Moment with an in∣finite
number of engaging Words and
Actions, which are exceeding delight∣ful.</P>
<P><HI>The Dutchess of—had
scarce spoke these last words, when
a Page came to tell her, that the
Duke of—staid for her com∣ing
to Supper; so soon as he saw
<PB N="189" REF="193"/>
her, he went to meet her, and con∣ducting
her to the Table,</HI> Where was
you, Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> about an Hour
ago, I look'd for you in your own
Lodging Room, in hopes to surprize
you, and to give you an account of my
Disguisement, and what pleasure I took
in putting upon the Ladies. Sir, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Dutchess of—cold¦ly,</HI>
I was then in my little Closet at
Prayers, reflecting upon the Vanity of
the World, and was not a little sur∣prised,
when I heard a dreadful noise
in my Chamber, you are so often trou∣bled
with these Fancies, that I can't
for my Life guess at the reason of it;
I suppose you think I have a certain
Spectre there, I keep in my own Pay.
'Tis most certain, Madam, <HI>reply'd the
Duke not without some Passion,</HI> that
I heard a noise in your Room, and upon
the Stairs as I was coming up, but could
not find out who it was that made it;
but one of your Young Women, who was
one of those that search'd every corner
among the rest, can witness it: For
my part, Madam, <HI>added the Duke
<PB N="191" REF="194"/>
Laughing,</HI> I am apt to believe, that
the Spectre you just now spoke of, has
his Residence there in your Ab∣sence.
Perhaps it may be so, Sir,
<HI>reply'd the Dutchess with a fierce
Countenance,</HI> you had best put some
Centinels thereabouts to catch it if you
can; but it is no easie matter to find
out a Spirit that appears no where, ex∣cept
in our Imagination. You take me
for a Fantastical Man, Madam, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Duke laughing;</HI> you are
addicted that way I am afraid, Sir,
<HI>said the Dutchess with a smile,</HI> be∣cause
when ever you have been abroad
upon your Diversions, you always fancy
upon your return home, to see some∣thing
in your way. These, Madam,
are the Remnants, <HI>reply'd the Duke
very obligingly,</HI> of the pleasant Ideas
I conceive in the Company of my Friends,
which don't leave me so soon, but fol∣lowing
me where ever I go, cause these
Chimerical Visions in my Brain. Be
that as it will, <HI>reply'd she with much
indifferency,</HI> these Fancies are not ve∣ry
becoming a Person of your Rank in
<PB N="190" REF="195"/>
the World; if you will take my word
for it, I would banish these Notions
out of my Thoughts; I will do it Ma∣dam,
because you desire it, <HI>reply'd the
Duke laughing,</HI> in hopes to oblige you
for ever. That is well, Sir, <HI>said the
Dutchess interrupting him, sitting
down at Table, and eating her Sup∣per,
without scarce speaking one
word. Supper being over, each of
them went to their Apartments,
where they spent part of the Night
in recollecting the Adventures of the
Day. The Duke thought of no∣thing
else but his Disguise, and the
Dutchess of what Inquietudes the
Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>in all probability
labour'd under, for having lost his
Picture and Case she had presented
him with. The next Day in the
Morning, this Lover full of Impa∣tience,
pay'd her a Visit</HI> incognito,
<HI>whilst she was yet in Bed; where he
kneel'd upon the Ground with all
the Marks of a most passionate Sub∣mission.
The Dutchess of—
who always bore a share in his Af∣fections,
<PB N="192" REF="196"/>
when she saw him in that
Posture, offer'd him her Snow white
Hand, and told him with a charm∣ing
Air,</HI> arise Count, I can't see you
thus, come seat your self in that Elbow
Chair just by the Bed. Most Incom∣parable
Lady, <HI>reply'd he, fastning his
Mouth to her fair Hands with an
excess of Passion,</HI> permit me to enjoy
for some Minutes longer, the pleasure
I feel in this Posture, which is beyond
my Power to express at this time. What
then is it you have to? tell me, dear
Count, <HI>reply'd she with a tender and
engaging Air?</HI> What I would say,
Madam, <HI>reply'd he sighing;</HI> alas!
I lost yesterday as I went from you,
that precious Pledge of your Love you
were pleased to bestow upon me; but I
know not what lucky thought fore∣tells
me, I shall once more see this
charming Piece again. Your Stars
Count, <HI>answered the Dutchess of
—with assurance,</HI> has deceiv'd
you, for I have not seen the things you
look for; and what is it you have lost,
that so nearly afflicts and vexes you:
<PB N="193" REF="197"/>
O! Madam, you know it well, <HI>cry'd
he looking steadfast on her,</HI> 'tis
what I value beyond any thing else in
the World, pray restore it to me, if you
would have me live for a few Hours
longer. If your Life depends on a
Picture-case, poor Languishing Man,
<HI>said the Dutchess merrily,</HI> come take
it, but be more careful of it another
time. Mrs. <HI>Montalet</HI> found it upon
the Back Stairs, and had it not been
for her, the Duke, who you know is of∣ten
a hunting of Spirits, because you
are like them, had certainly found it:
Consider what Troubles and Vexations
you would have occasioned me, if such
a Misfortune had befal'n us? 'Tis
very true, Madam, <HI>said the Count
with an engaging Air,</HI> but if you did
but know, how I dread the Duke of
—Presence, nay, even when I
do but hear him coming, I actually
forget my self. I know not who or where
I am, and therefore have the greater
Obligations to the Lovely <HI>Finote,</HI> who
has already more than once delivered me
from such like Dangers. I have given
<PB N="194" REF="198"/>
her the right Name; and am glad I
hit it so well.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Montalet,</HI> who had heard e∣very
word the Count said of her,
came running on a sudden into the
Dutchess of—Chamber; <HI>I
have another Opportunity of serving
you, Count,</HI> cry'd she, <HI>hide your self
in this By-place, else you will certainly
be catch'd by his Highness.</HI> So the
Count went into the Place the young
Lady shew'd him, where they used
to keep some of their Glasses and
Bottles. The Duke no sooner came
into the Room, but seeing a <HI>China</HI>
Orange lying upon her Table, he
cut it, and was going to throw the
Peel into that place where the Count
was, it being near the Chimney;
but the young Lady perceiving his
Intention, drawing near him with a
singular Dexterity; <HI>Pray, Sir,</HI> said
she Laughing, <HI>give it me, I love it
extreamly, it is most excellent for the
Stomach.</HI> The Duke, who little
dream'd of the Count's being in
that place so early in the Morning,
<PB N="195" REF="199"/>
willingly gave it her. <HI>I thank you,
Sir,</HI> said <HI>Montalet,</HI> making a pro∣found
Reverence, and ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing it with
all the pretended Eagerness in the
World; <HI>O! how fine and delicious it
is,</HI> added she. <HI>Especially,</HI> said the
Dutchess Loughing, <HI>when it comes
from the Duke. Very true, Madam,</HI>
reply'd she very obligingly, <HI>I am apt
to believe, that its delicious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is
owing to him, because he has eat of it.
You have a mind to make your self
merry, you charming pretty Eyes, I
shall take Revenge of your Complaisance.
O! Sir, I hope,</HI> reply'd the young
Woman modestly, <HI>your Revenge will
keep within the bounds of Moderation,
and do me no hurt, I can't promise
you that, my Dear,</HI> said the Dutchess
interrupting and looking at her, <HI>the
Duke is more dangerous than you think
for; sometimes a small matter troubles
and vexes him, and if he should meet
you in the Night time he would certain∣ly
take you for a Spectre or for a
….</HI></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="200"/>
The Duke of—finding that
the Dutchess retained still in fresh
Memory the last Nights Adventure,
took his leave of her, intending to
go to the <HI>Italian</HI> Comedians, who
were to present a Play, wherein the
said Duke was to act a Part in the
<HI>Judgment of Paris;</HI> he being seated
at the Foot of a very old Tree near
a Rock, in the midst of his Sheep,
where the Three Goddesses came to
offer their Caresses and vast Promi∣ses
to him, each in hopes of obtain∣ing
his Judgment in behalf of their
Beauty: But at last <HI>Venus</HI> with her
Natural Graces touches and wounds
his Heart, promises him infinite
Charms and Pleasures, if he will be∣stow
the Apple he held in his Hand,
upon her; which he does accord∣ingly,
and with a most Passionate
tender Air, <HI>It belongs to you as your
due,</HI> says he, <HI>Queen of Hearts, and
the Fair Lady you so much boast of to
me. Yes, dear</HI> Paris, <HI>I will keep my
Promise,</HI> cry'd the Goddess squeezing
his Hand, with a tender Look, <HI>if
<PB N="197" REF="201"/>
thou durst but Love, thy Business is
done; thou shalt Enjoy her without re∣serve,
for I will touch her Heart so to
the Quick, that she shall not be able to
resist thee. Farewel, I leave you full
of this delightful</HI> Idea, <HI>do thou thy part,
and I will perform mine.</HI> The Duke
acted his Part to Admiration, and
after he came out of the Playhouse,
paid a Visit to Madam <HI>Montespan,</HI>
unto whom he gave an account of
his Comical Disguises.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of—who was
not a little pleased to see her self so
soon freed from the Duke's Impor∣tunities,
by reason of the Count's
Imprisonment, laugh'd heartily, as
well as Mrs. <HI>Montalet,</HI> when they
saw the poor Count come out of
his Prison, with a pal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Coun∣tenance,
like a frighted <HI>Hugenot:
'Twas high time, Madam,</HI> said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, <HI>to
release me, I never suffered so much in
all my Life time before. I am very
sensible of it, Count,</HI> reply'd the
Dutchess Laughing, <HI>but come recover
your self and go home, for fear of a∣nother
<PB N="198" REF="202"/>
Surprize.</HI> The Count <HI>de
Guiche</HI> obey'd the Dutchesses Orders,
tho' not without much Reluctancy;
but as he was just going out, he de∣sired
they might take a Walk toge∣ther,
unto which she return'd him
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Answer, because she happened
at that time to be out of order, ac∣cording
to the ordinary Course of
Women, which made the Count
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ok much discontented and pens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when the Dutchess told him, he
m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st come in the Afternoon to play
at Cards, he went his way very well
satisfy'd, and sail'd not to return at
the appointed time, when these two
Lovers entertain'd one another with
all the Satisfaction that could be,
because the Duke was absent, and
divers other Ladies of Quality were
there, attended by their Gallants.
After they had done playing, they
were regaled by the Dutchess, with
a magnificent Collation and a Con∣sort
of Musick, till very late at Night.
The Company being gone, and the
Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> among the rest, the
<PB N="199" REF="203"/>
Dutchess went into her Closet, where
she diverted her self with reading
a Novel, representing a certain Ca∣valier,
passionately in Love with a
very handsome Nun; a kind of a
Rarity in this present changeable
Age, where even the most Gallan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and most Constant Men, are not ea∣sily
induced to enter into a faithful
and durable Engagement with a
Woman: That volatile God, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
influences their Hearts with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Pleasures, and who inspires int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
them such Sentiments as are con∣formable
to his Inclinations; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
says this Child of <HI>Venus,</HI> run from
one handsome Woman to another,
gather all the Flowers and Fruits
that light in your way, never miss a
good Opportunity; this is the way
to make you happy, without trou∣bling
your self with a long and te∣dious
Intrigue, which does more
harm than good; this is the Lesson
Love most commonly gives to the
Gallants of our Age. But let us
look back towards the Dutchess of
<PB N="200" REF="204"/>
—who could not but be highly
pleased with the Character of the
Hero, whose Story she was reading
in the Novel. <HI>How,</HI> cry'd she by
intervals, <HI>is it possible People should
Love one another for so long a time?</HI>
The Bonds of so long a Friendship,
must needs wear out, and certainly
'tis tiresome to say and hear the same
thing over and over again; I don't
in the least wonder, that Men leave
their Mistresses, no more than I do
at their abandoning their Gallants:
A new Passion contains the true Re∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh
of Love: How many engaging
and tender Diversions does it not
carry along with it? Whereas Old
and Languishing Sighs, and thread∣bare
Addresses, are only tiresome
and Vexatious. These were the
Dutchesses Thoughts upon this Sto∣ry,
which perhaps you may see her
put in practice in good time.</P>
<P>Now let us Enquire what is be∣come
of the Duke of—who,
we told you, had been relating his
Comical Adventures to the Marchio∣ness
<PB N="201" REF="205"/>
of <HI>Montespan.</HI> This Lady see∣ing
the Duke to persist in his Addres∣ses
to her, frankly own'd that she
Lov'd him, and to keep her Heart
only for him, had rejected the Of∣fers
made her by several Eminent
Lords. <HI>I believe it, Madam,</HI> an∣swered
the Duke Laughing▪ <HI>even not
excepting my little Cousin the Count</HI> de
Lausun, <HI>who is quite spoil'd, because
the King allows him so much freedom;
I am sensible he does not want Wit nor
Gallantry, and may compare in that
point with any of the King's Favou∣rites;
but after all, the King loving
him to such a degree, makes him too
bold. O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sir,</HI> said the Marchioness
with a Serious Air, <HI>did you but know
with what de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>erity he can ma∣nage
our Monarch, you would stand
amazed at it: First, he is his Con∣fident,
who knows how to represent to
him all the great Heroick Qualifica∣tions
of</HI> De la Valiere, <HI>and that in
the finest Colours in the World, and
thus insinuates himse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f into his Confi∣dence;
these are the Artifices the Fa∣vourites
<PB N="102" REF="206"/>
make use of, to bring the King
absolutely over to his Interest. I will
tell you sincerely, Madam,</HI> reply'd
the Duke, <HI>that my Cousin</HI> de Mon∣pensier
<HI>is very fond of him, and this
is another Reason, why he stands so
fair in the King's Book, because she
takes all Opportunities of extolling
sometimes his Wit, sometimes his Per∣son
before him, so that these continual
Praises coming from the Mouth of such
a Person as she, 'tis impossible for his
Majesty to forbear having a great E∣steem
for him; and what you mentio∣ned
just now, stand him in no small
stead to preserve the King's good Opi∣nion
for him, because he honours with
his Esteem and Good Will, all those
that have either a sincere or pretended
Inclination for Mademoiselle</HI> de Va∣lieres,
<HI>and he is so far prepossess'd
with the powerful Charms of this young
Lady, that he can discern Falshoods
from Truth in that point. That is true
enough, Sir,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>Monte∣span</HI>
Laughing, <HI>but it is not her hand∣some
Body that Enchants the King;
<PB N="103" REF="207"/>
the Count</HI> de Lausune <HI>is a better Judge,
and has a much nicer Relish, than to
know better; but to speak the Truth,
when he speaks in her praise he is obliged
to make use of all his Dexterity and
feign'd Complaisance,</HI> continued she
with a jealous and m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licious Smile,
<HI>his Aim reaches a great way be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond of∣fering
his Incenses to our Gallant Mo∣narch's
Beauty. However, this very
Beauty, Madam,</HI> say you what you
please of her, continued the Duke
with a merry A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, <HI>has a certain</HI> je ne
scay quoy, <HI>which Charms and Enga∣ges
this Prince to so high a degree;
and whether it be in her Body or Mind,
he discovers in her something beyond
what he meets with in other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adies.
It must be in her Body then, Sir,</HI> re∣ply'd
the Marchioness Laughing,
<HI>that Nature has plac'd this extraordi∣nary</HI>
Je ne scay quoy; <HI>for were it in
her Mind, this would not satisfie the
Amorous King, for in Love, the Bo∣dy
bears a greater share than the Mind,
unless we have only an Imagination.
What you say, Madam, is agreeable to
<PB N="204" REF="208"/>
Reason, your Thoughts are very agree∣able
to Truth,</HI> said the Duke inter∣rupting
her with a Smile, <HI>but I am
very ready to leave his Majesty in the
quiet possession of his unknown God∣dess,
and his</HI> Je ne scay quoy, <HI>which
Nature perhaps has fram'd on purpose
for his Pleasure: For my part, all my
Thoughts are taken up with yours, which
strikes with so high a Lustre into my
Heart and Eyes: Pray then tell me,
whether I have no Rival, and whether
your Heart is not divided? No, no,
dear Sir,</HI> cry'd she with a Tender
Air, <HI>don't fear any thing of that kind,
I Love no Body but your self; and I
don't bestow my</HI> Je ne scay quoy <HI>upon
any Body living unless ….
and tho', Sir, you are pleased to say,</HI>
It shines in your Eyes, <HI>it lies hid∣den,
and is hard to come at. Incompa∣rable
Lady,</HI> reply'd the Duke coldly,
<HI>did the Count</HI> de Lausun <HI>never find,
nor come at it, who searches into the
most dark and difficult places, and en∣ters
the straitest and smallest Passages,
without much opposition, as he himself
<PB N="205" REF="209"/>
will often tell us when he has a Glass
or two of Wine in his Head.</HI> The
Marchioness Blush'd at these words
believing no otherwise than that the
Count had made his Brags of her
Favours to the Duke, which he,
who observ'd every Motion, soon
taking notice of, told her with a
Smile; <HI>Madam, I find your Heart be∣trays
you, and that the Count</HI> de Lau∣sun,
<HI>with his piercing Eyes has found
out the way to that</HI> Je ne scay quoy,
<HI>so many Philosophers have search'd af∣ter
in vain: How, could you bestow
your Favours upon so inconstant a
Person as he is? Certainly this is
to be to prodigal of those Charms Na∣ture
has bestow'd upon you with so
much Liberality. And why do you be∣lieve,
Sir,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>de Montespan</HI>
with a fierce Air, <HI>I have bestow'd my
Favours upon the Count</HI> de Lausun? <HI>I
must have little else to do, to spend my
time with the most fickle and most in∣constant
of all Men living: For tho'
he is in the absolute possession of</HI> Made∣moiselle'<HI>s
Favour, he has an almost
<PB N="106" REF="210"/>
infinite Number of Mistress<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s besides,
whom he cajoles into his Snare, by his
deceitful Language: At this time when
he has an Intrigue with a</HI> Counsellor's
Wife, <HI>for a few Days perhaps, and the
next Week, doubtless he will be for a
fresh one; so that one must be half mad
and bereaved of Common Sense, to have
a Man of so odd a Character. To tell
you the Truth,</HI> said the Duke, <HI>I think
him the happiest Man on Earth; he is
not sensible of those Pains in his Love
Intrigues, which are the constant At∣tendants
of a well settled and constant
Love, nor those Inquietudes which
torment a true Lover. Do you call
that Love, Sir,</HI> said the Marchio∣ness
with a seeming Surprize? I
<HI>should not much care to be beloved at
that rate; and I would rather chuse to
be without a Gallant as long as I Live,
than have one of that Kidney. What
Qualities then must a Man be Master
of, Madam,</HI> reply'd the Duke draw∣ing
nearer to her, <HI>to be beloved by you,
and to please you constantly. Sir,</HI> cry'd
she, <HI>Felicity, Tenderness, Sincerity, a
<PB N="107" REF="211"/>
nice Passion without self Interest, and
in short, every thing that makes up a
perfect and accomplish'd Gallant. Where
my Dear,</HI> reply'd the Duke with a
passionate Air, <HI>where did ever you see
the Original of this beautiful Picture?
Don't you know that the defects you
see in us, are like the shades which set
off and embellish our Merits, and that
if there were no Charms at all in Love,
its Pleasures would soon fade and lose
their relish. Is this your real Opinion
then of your chargeable Sex,</HI> added the
Marchioness with much Gravity, <HI>is
Inconstancy your Talent, go and try
whether you can meet with some body
else that is fond of your frailties, which
you extol for a Virtue: For my part,
my Heart shall rather be without a Pas∣sion,
as long as it endures, than to shew
you the least Countenance; so that we
have forfeited all your good Opinion,
Madam,</HI> cry'd the Duke with a court∣ly
Air, <HI>'tis high time to reconcile you
to our Sex, least you should conceive
a hatred against us: What an unfor∣tunate
Accident would that prove to
<PB N="208" REF="212"/>
me,</HI> continued he, <HI>if you should hate
me, to me, who loves you beyond my
own Life, and who have often told you
so, if you will own the Truth. I am
very doubtful, Sir,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>de
Montespan</HI> with much indifferency,
<HI>what to think of it, Great Men are no
less Politick and Inconstant in Love
than other People; you have said the
same thing to the Countess</HI> d' Olone,
<HI>who at this very time exclaims against
your Inconstancy and sudden Change,
and so do several other handsome La∣dies.
I don't think fit to name for Mo∣desty's
sake, and for fear of doing them
a Prejudice. Your Frankness and Re∣servedness,
Madam,</HI> reply'd the Duke
with much Gravity, <HI>are highly Com∣mendable,
but you should set bounds to
them, and not take me for so sickle
and inconstant a Person. I am sen∣sible
what you have told Madam</HI> d' O∣lone
<HI>upon that head, who is a foolish
indiscreet Person, whom I scarce should
have as much as named to you, had not
you begun the Discourse; I desire you
to believe, I make a vast Difference
<PB N="209" REF="213"/>
betwixt you and her.</HI> He had no
sooner said these words, but (being
a Person who is very captious) he
took his Leave very coldly, which
not a little surprised the Marchio∣ness,
who intended not to have
parted with him at so easie a rate,
nor to be satisfy'd with words,
which are not the only thing Ladies
of her Temper expect from their
Gallants. However, the Count <HI>de
Lausun,</HI> against who's inconstant and
Fickle Humour she had exclaimed so
much but a few Moments before,
took care to repair the loss she had
suffered by the Duke of—
Absence, and freely presented her
with what it perhaps was not in the
others power to give. The Count
pass'd the Evening with her in all man∣ner
of Diversions the time and place
could afford him and this Lady, who
is as fickle and changeable as any
Man well can be, could not forbear
railing at the Count against the
Duke, telling him, he would be a
Child as long as he lived, and never
<PB N="110" REF="214"/>
come to an Age capable of striking
up a good Bargain with a fair Lady,
when she offered him the best thing
that belonged to Her. <HI>Madam,</HI> ad∣ded
the Count laughing, <HI>there is as
much difference betwixt the King's
Galantry, and that of the Duke of
O—s, as there is betwixt the Sun
and an ordinary Star; Every Action
of this Great Monarch, in Relation to
the fair Sex is charming, and raises
an Emulation in others; whereas on the
contrary, the Duke of O—s has no∣thing
in his way of Courtship (which
ought to have something of Vivacity and
Briskness in it) but what favours Dul∣ness
and Languishment. 'Tis very true
what you say, Sir,</HI> reply'd the Mar∣chioness
with a smile, <HI>he has spent
above two whole hours in asking me
whether I loved him, and whether he
had any Rivals, besides a thousand
quibbles concerning a certain</HI> Jenescay
quoy, <HI>which I believe he was afraid
he should not find out, unless one was
to shew him the way to it. What sig∣nifies
trifling away ones time at that
<PB N="111" REF="215"/>
rate when a Man proposes to make sure
of a Womans Heart; all th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se del<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys
serve only to co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l our Passions▪ and to
check the designs of a Lover. Accord∣ing
to the rules I should give to a
Soldier in the Wars of</HI> Venus, con∣tinued
she laughing, <HI>be ought to At∣tack
the Place he intends to t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke with
the utmost fury, and not to raise the
Siege till it has surrendred upon good
Terms. I believe, Madam, no Ge∣neral
in</HI> Europe, said the Count
<HI>de Lausun</HI> with a most gallant Air,
<HI>could have given a better … to
his Soldiers than you have done,</HI> viz.
<HI>to Attack a Place with the utmost Vi∣gour,
and not to stir from before it till
it surrenders upon very good Conditi∣ons:
This is as much as the best Ge∣neral
could do, for we know that the
greatest Captains have sometimes been
lost during the heat of an Engagement.
The Wounds we receive in the
Battles of Love,</HI> reply'd she merrily,
<HI>are seldom so dangerous as to prove in∣curable;
that God who protects them
always, takes care of his Subjects, and
<PB N="212" REF="216"/>
furthers the taking of the Place; some∣times
we get the Victory, and remain
Masters of the Field of Battel before
we are aware of it, and obtain the Gar∣land
Love has prepared for us. Ma∣dam,</HI>
reply'd the Count laughing a∣loud,
<HI>you have a very pretty way of
convincing and reviving the Courage of
such Volunteers, as are inclined to list
themselves under the Standard of the
God of Love; such pleasing hopes and
promises, are sufficient to rouse the
Courage even of a Coward, and to make
him out brave danger with Sword in
hand, even with the utmost hazard of
his Life. O! Count, you will easily
lose your self there,</HI> said she with a
malicious smile, <HI>you will take care of
it I'll warrant you for some time longer.
I desire it should be so,</HI> continued he,
<HI>that I may love you the longer and
…. Madam</HI> de Montespan.
Then arising from her Seat, after
having obliged the Count with a
kiss, began to Sing certain Words
out of a certain Opera she had been
<PB N="213" REF="217"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, along with the Count a small time
before.</P>
<Q><L>There is no Death like that which
Love gives us,</L>
<L>Nor a more quick Resurrection.</L></Q>
<P>The Count <HI>de Lausun,</HI> well sa∣tisfy'd
to have so exactly hit the
Critical Minute with this Lady, em∣brac'd
her at parting, and the next
Morning went to make Love at the
Feet of <HI>Mademoiselle,</HI> who was not
a little Jealous of his other Mistres∣ses,
and this was the reason why he
never made her the Confident of his
Amours.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O</HI>—<HI>s,</HI> who was
very easily put out of Humour, and
had lett the Marchioness of <HI>Monte∣span,</HI>
as we told you, in a very ab∣rupt
manner, did not pay her a Vi∣sit
for some time after, looking for
his Divertisements in Playing, and
in the Company of some of his Flat∣terers,
who to insinuate themselves
into his Favour, left nothing unat∣tempted
<PB N="214" REF="218"/>
to create a new Jealousie in
that Duke, by certain Stories they
told him concerning his Dutchess
—and the Count <HI>de Guiche.</HI>
These Insinuations prevail'd so far
upon the Duke, that he not only
set certain Persons to watch all her
Motions, but also became so for∣getful
of his high Rank and Extra∣ction,
as to bend all his Thoughts to
Revenge, whereof the poor Count
<HI>de Guiche</HI> soon found the Unhappy
Effects to his Cost, his good Fortune,
after having wrong'd him so long
with a favourable Gale upon the
Ocean of Pleasures, now turning
her Back to him.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O</HI>—<HI>s,</HI> whose De∣votion
extends to a degree of Bi∣gotry,
being one day at Mass at the
Chappel of the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> put his
Hand all over into the <HI>Holy Water,</HI>
rubb'd his Forehead with it, and
with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven,
made several Signs of the Cross:
The Dutchess of—who hap∣pen'd
to be there at there also with
<PB N="115" REF="219"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> whom he had
not seen since his last Adventure, but
now was come to hear Mass also,
could not forbear, as her Ill Stars
would have it, to Laugh at the
Duke, which he perceiving, but
dissembling his Resentment, went
out of the Chappel without speak∣ing
one word to her, directly to the
Queen Mother's Apartment, where
meeting with the King, he told him
all his Inquietudes, with Tears in
his Eyes. The Dutchess of—
who saw him go out, without speak∣ing
a word to her, or giving her his
Hand, as he used to do, but leaving
her to be Conducted out of the
Chappel by the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> told
him with a melancholy Air; <HI>Alas!
dear Count, all is undone: The Duke
it certainly very angry with me, I could
read it in his Countenance. I am rea∣dy
to run distracted at it, Madam,
What is to be done? I can't tell,</HI> re∣ply'd
the Dutchess, <HI>unless I desire you
to withdraw,</HI> The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI>
who always pay'd a blind Obedience
<PB N="216" REF="220"/>
to her Commands, having Con∣ducted
her to her Apartment, left
her with Mrs. <HI>Montalet,</HI> unto whom
she related her Grief. The Queen
Mother being touch'd to the Heart<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with the Duke of <HI>O</HI>—<HI>s</HI>'s Inquie∣tudes,
and his frank way of speak∣ing,
desired the King to talk with
the Marshal <HI>de Grammont,</HI> and to
send the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI>'s Son at
such a distance from Court, that it
might not be in his Power to appear
there again, which was done ac∣cordingly
some days after, the Duke
making in the mean time a great
noise, and putting out of the
Dutchess's Service two of her young
Ladies she confided most in, which
afforded no small matter of Affli∣ction.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> had no
sooner received the King's and his
Father's Commands, to absent him∣self
for ever from the Light of the
Divine Dutchess of—but he
run strait to the Marquiss of …
his most intimate Friend; who, as
<PB N="217" REF="221"/>
we told you before, had so often
forewarned him of his Misfortune,
and told him with Tears in his Eyes,
<HI>Oh! dear Friend, I am going to re∣ceive
the fatal Stroak, that will put
an end to my Life. This does not
surprize me, Sir,</HI> said the Marquis
with the same indifferency, having
got notice already of his intended
Exilement; <HI>How often have I spoke
to you about it, when you turn'd my Ad∣vice
into Ridicule; and told me with
a very contented Air, I was unacquaint∣ed
with that agreeable Variety, Love
and Ambition raises in the Heart:
Now see,</HI> said he jestingly, <HI>what glo∣rious
effects these two Passions have
produced in you? Now try whether
you are able to stem the Current; for
my part, I see not the least likelihood,
to avoid so dangerous a Blow. Alas!
I am utterly undone, my dear Friend,</HI>
reply'd he with a Melancholy Tone,
<HI>I see no means to save my self out of
so dreadful a Gulph; What is to be
done in so dangerous a Case as mine?
Nothing but Death can deliver me. A
<PB N="218" REF="222"/>
Man can't Die when he pleases,</HI> said the
Marquis with a Compassionate Air,
<HI>you argue like a Child; your best way is
to get out of the reach of the Court; your
Gallantry will always be remembred,
and you will be made sensible of what
it is, to touch a Person of so high a
Rank in the World, in so nice a point
as this.</HI> The Count was reduced
to such a Condition at the very
Thoughts of his Departure (which
was to be within 24 Hours) that he
was not sensible of what his Friend
advised him to, and his Heart being
too full of Affliction to give him
leave to return a suitable Answer,
he embrac'd him most tenderly, and
told him with a deep Sigh, <HI>Dear
Friend, must I part with thee for ever?
Don't be so much afflicted,</HI> answered
the Marquis giving him a Kiss, <HI>I will
endeavour by the Accession of my
Friends, to make your Peace in your
Absence, which perhaps may be of no
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong Continuance. Would it please
Heaven,</HI> reply'd he squeezing his
Hand, <HI>you may speak true, and prove
<PB N="219" REF="223"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good Prophet, how happy should I be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f you</HI> …. Some more Com∣pany
coming in, these two Friends
bid one another Farewel, and so
parted.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who had
taken his leave of his Father before
he went to his Friend, after having
spent a few Minutes in ruminating
upon his Misfortune, resolved not
to depart without seeing the Dutch∣ess
of—to effect which, he
ventured upon a thing which no Bo∣dy
but what was as Amorous as him∣self
would have undertaken. He
knew the Dutchess to have a great
Esteem for a certain <HI>Religioso,</HI> who
sometimes used to come to her:
The Count having disguised himself
under his Habit, went without any
more Ceremony to the Palace, where
in the height of his Misfortune he
had the Satisfaction of entertaining
his dear Dutchess for a considerable
time, and to tell her at length, every
thing a Man is capable of saying,
or feeling, when he is to be separa∣ted
<PB N="220" REF="224"/>
from what he Loves. <HI>Is it pos∣sible,
my dear Count,</HI> said she embra∣cing
him very tenderly, <HI>I should ne∣ver
see you again? Alas!</HI> continued
she with a Charming Voice, <HI>your
Acquaintance will cost me abundance of
Tears; and 'twill be very hard for me
to outlive, alas, that touches me to the
Quick. O! Madam,</HI> reply'd the
Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> throwing himself
at her Feet, <HI>how much do I stand in∣debted
to your Goodness, since you are
pleased to withdraw from me so preci∣ous
a Gift as your Love at the last mo∣ment?
But after all this,</HI> added he,
shedding some Tears he was no
longer able to retain, <HI>I am at the
Point of losing the most Agreeable and
most Charming Happiness of my Life;
which for the future will be indifferent
to me without</HI> …. The poor
Count, at these last words, found
himself so far overwhelm'd with his
Afflictions, that he fell into a
Swoon at the Dutchess's Feet, who
ordered Mrs. <HI>Montalet</HI> to throw some
fair Water in his Face, whilst she
<PB N="221" REF="225"/>
rubb'd his Temples and Hands with
some <HI>Hungary Water.</HI> This last Re∣medy
proved the most successful,
because the Dutchess her self had
apply'd it, and there is not a more
Sovereign Medicine in the World to
recover a Lover fallen into a Love
Fit, than the Fair Hand of his Mi∣stress,
which 'tis impossible for him
to resist, unless he be actually
dead.</P>
<P>The Count being recovered out
of his Swoon, fix'd his Eyes full of
Languishment, and a deadly Melan∣choly,
on the Dutchess of—
but continued for a considerable
time longer without speaking one
word: His Sighs, which on this oc∣casion
were the faithful Interpreters
of his afflicted Heart, delivered
themselves with much more El<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣quence
in this Dumb Language, than
the most Polite Expressions in the
World could have. At last the
Dutchess, tired with so long a si∣lence,
told him with a most Passio∣nate
Air, <HI>Lovely Count, have you lost
<PB N="222" REF="226"/>
the use of your Tongue? What makes you
silent at this Juncture when you should
make use of all your Strength to assure
me of your Heart's being mine for ever,
and to comfort me for your Absence,
by giving me assured hopes, that you will
never forget me. I am sensible,</HI> con∣tinued
she squeezing his Hands, <HI>that
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avy Afflictions are dumb, and that
little ones make a much greater noise:
O! most Divine Dutchess,</HI> cry'd the
Count quite transported, with Eyes
full of Languishment, <HI>then you will
Love me after I am gone? What good
Fortune is there like mine in the midst
of my most Cruel Exilement? O most
rigorous Fate, who snatcheth me, in
spight of all my resistance, from the
Feet of my Adorable Queen, and which
for ever deprives me of those dear and
sweet Moments I used to enjoy with
her: My Life will be odious to me,
so soon as I see my self absented from
you, and 'tis possible time will efface me
out of your Remembrance; a Remem∣brance
most charming and precious,
if I may be so happy, as to keep a place
<PB N="223" REF="227"/>
there for ever. Can you doubt, Count,</HI>
reply'd the Dutchess in a most ten∣der
and engaging manner, <HI>but th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I
shall continue to Love you after once
having known you so well? O! 'tis
a hard Task, my Dear,</HI> added she, <HI>to
withdraw ones Heart, after it is once
in your Power; one may try the utmost
of ones Strength in vain to recover it,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et it will remain the Conqueror and
triumph over it. In spite of my De∣stiny,
which will not permit me to see
you any more, I shall always bear an
implacable Hatred to all those that have
betray'd you, and been the occasion of
your Exilement: Rest assured, that if
ever it is in my Power to render you
more Fortunate, I will omit nothing
that may contribute towards it; and
that I never can forgive the King and
several other Lords, who have given
and procured this cruel Command. Ma∣dam,</HI>
answered the Count sighing,
<HI>you are sensible 'tis a considerable time,
since I foresaw this Misfortune, and
that I told my self I was not born for
the Enjoyment of so excessive a Happi∣ness;
<PB N="224" REF="228"/>
Envy could not look without a
Malicious Eye upon me, and has spit
out all his Rage and Venom against
even the most Innocent Actions of my
Life, in order to render me odious to
the Duke of—who ever since
hates me,</HI> as he told my Father the
Marshal <HI>de Grammont, no otherwise,
than if I were the greatest Villain on
Earth. The most violent Reprimands
my Father</HI> (exasperated against me
past all Reconciliation) <HI>gave me, were
like so many Stroaks that pierced to my
Heart; and I protest to you, I could
have wish'd rather to die on the Spot,
than to be forced to submit to so harsh
a Treatment: How, senceless, ambiti∣ous
Wreth,</HI> said he transported with
Rage, <HI>how durst thou have the Impu∣dence
to lift up thy Eyes to a Person
of so high a Rank in the World? I
thought it my best way to return him
no Answer, knowing my self guilty of
having raised my Thoughts too high.
But pardon, most Divine Dutchess,</HI>
continued this Passionate Lover kis∣sing
her Hands, <HI>pardon the Ambition
<PB N="225" REF="229"/>
of a second</HI> Jeanes <HI>whose Wings were
melted because he came too near the
piercing Beams of the Sun,</HI> said the
Dutchess, interrupting him with
a Smile, because she began to
be tired, to see the Count in so
Languishing a State, without mak∣ing
the least Motion of giving her
her last Farewel. Truly never did
a Man appear in a worse condition,
to act like a Man, than the poor
Count did upon this Occasion. I
can't tell whether his Religious Ha∣bit,
or the apprehension of parting
with his Mistress, had extinguish'd
in him that Natural Heat, which
most Gentlemen are sensible of when
they are in Love with a Fair Lady;
but certain it is, that his Incompa∣rable
Goddess, seeing him in such a
Condition, which very much deser∣ved
her Pity and Compassion, told
him more than once, he should thrust
his good Fortune as foreward as he
could, and that she would take care
to support it as long as she could;
unto which I suppose the poor

Count return'd no Answer, at least
not as far as ever I could learn. At
last the Dutchess of—taking
no great Satisfaction in his Dying
Conversation, gave him leave to de∣part,
telling him at parting, and
looking at him with a most Com∣passionate
Air, that she would for∣give
his small Faults both of the
Body and Mind, and that she would
Love him nevertheless, tho he had
been wanting in his …..
and in a thousand other things re∣quired
from a true Lover. The
Count ready to run distracted, be∣cause
he had no sooner apprehended
the Dutchess's meaning, began now
to feel some certain Motions of Ac∣knowledgment,
such as the Flesh
most commonly inspires into all A∣morous
Hearts, and would fain have
push'd on the Conversation to a more
sensible Point, but that the Dutch∣ess,
who began to be tired with his
Sighs and Tears, told him with a
seeming endearing Air; <HI>Don't stay,
Count, go, go, I am satisfy'd with your
<PB N="227" REF="231"/>
Passion; take care of your self, and▪
rely upon every thing I have promised
to you; be gone without any further
delay, least you should be catch'd here
by the Duke, and then your Case would
be more deplorable than ever.</HI></P>
<P>Within a Minute after the Count
was gone, the Duke of—paid
a Visit to the Dutchess of—
in her Bed Chamber, having not
spoken one word to her ever since
he left her the last time at Mass,
and the Dutchess, who was vex'd
to the Soul, whereof she knew the
Duke to be the chief Occasion, gave
him but a cold Reception, pretend∣ing
she intended to retire into her
Closet, to avoid his Company: But
the Duke who was extreamly fond
of her, seating himself near her,
and looking at her, <HI>what have I done
to you, Madam,</HI> said he, <HI>which de∣serves
your hatred, you shun me as if
I were your Enemy. You are not un∣acquainted
with it, Sir,</HI> reply'd the
Dutchess abruptly, <HI>I am surprized
how you can ask me such a question.
<PB N="228" REF="232"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f it is the Count</HI> de Guiche'<HI>s Absence,
Madam,</HI> reply'd the Duke smiling,
<HI>that puts you into so ill a humour, and
makes you so averse to my Caresses, I
will rather chuse to make him come
back cost it what it will; but what do
I say,</HI> added the Duke checking
himself, <HI>perhaps he is not gone yet.
You know that better than I,</HI> said the
Dutchess with a great deal of indif∣rency,
<HI>I don't question but he has rea∣dily
obey'd your Orders in every thing.</HI>
The Duke, who as often as he saw
the Dutchess, found her in a most
serious and pensive Posture, and who
had flatter'd himself, that after the
Counts Banishment from her sight,
she would shew more fondness to
him; when he found himself mista∣ken
in his hopes, he fell into a very
deep Melancholy, which continued
for a considerable time, nothing be∣ing
able to divert him, because he
observed the Dutchess's Indifferency
increas'd almost every Day. 'Tis
certain, since the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI>'s
Exilement, she never shew'd any real
<PB N="229" REF="233"/>
Tenderness to the Duke, whom she
did not Love very much before:
But this last Action having touch'd
her to the Heart indeed, she con∣ceived
a secret hatred against the
Duke and the whole court, tho she
did all she could to conceal it. How∣ever,
at last, as time wears out the
Remembrance of every thing, and
that even the greatest Passions don't
continue for ever, the Dutchess be∣gan
to forget the Tender Addresses
of the Count, and the Duke by de∣grees
accustom'd himself to dispence
with her Indifferency.</P>
<P><HI>One Day the Dutchess of—
being alone with the Dutchess</HI> de
Crequi <HI>(a Lady she loved extreamly,
and whom she made the Confident
of her Amorous Secrets)</HI> St Cloudi,
<HI>she began to talk to her concerning
him;</HI> 'tis certain, <HI>said she with a
Languishing Voice,</HI> that all Men are
Inconstant and addicted to Change, I
have not heard one word of the Count
<HI>de Guiche</HI> since his Departure: O!
ungrateful Man, <HI>continued she sigh∣ing,</HI>
<PB N="230" REF="234"/>
he has got some other Intrigues
upon his Hands; what is become of all
the Oaths his Treacherous Heart has
offer'd up to me, never to forget me,
after what I had done for him. Ma∣dam,
<HI>reply'd the Dutchess</HI> de Crequi,
'tis possible he dares not venture to
write to you under his present unfortu∣nate
Circumstances; you are in jest I
believe, <HI>answered the Dutehess of
—Laughing,</HI> as if this were
the first time he has run such a hazard?
Besides all this, Love knows how to
surmount all obstacles, and to open it∣self
an easie way, if supported by a real
Tenderness: But let us talk of him no
more, come we had better divert our
selves with your fair Cardinal; pray
let us know how matters stand betwixt
you and him, and whether you conti∣nue
to be constant to him; to tell you
the truth, <HI>continued she laughing,</HI>
I look upon the Cardinal as a very gal∣lant
Prelate, and the most charming
Person in the World; for he has a
way to accommodate every thiug to the
Will of Heaven, and his Precepts of
<PB N="231" REF="235"/>
Morality are very easie, would but all
the rest of the same Profession follow
his Footsteps, the Monasteries and the
Ecclesiasticks would not appear so odious
to the World as now they do: And
don't you believe, Madam, <HI>said the
Dutchess</HI> de Crequi <HI>with a pleasant
Air,</HI> that most of our Religious Men,
'tho never so reserved and austere in
outward Appearance, frame themselves
Moral Rules suitable to their own In∣clinations,
and relish the sensual Plea∣sures
at the same time when they pre∣tend
to pray for the poor Sinners. De∣votion
is the best Cloak in the World
whrewith to hide their Gallantry's. I
know one who always will not give his
Absolution to a young Penitent, unless
she bestows beforehand her Favours upon
him, which are discounted when he
gives her his Benediction, which, as
you may easily guess, must needs be ve∣ry
Holy. But my dear, <HI>said the
Dutchess of—interrupting
her with a smile,</HI> in what manner does
your lovely Cardinal impart his Bene∣dictions
to you, when he stays whole
<PB N="232" REF="236"/>
Days with you to perform his Devo∣tions.
O! Madam, <HI>cry'd the Dut∣chess</HI>
de Crequi <HI>with a seeming bi∣gotted
and pious Air,</HI> one may say he
is an Angel when he is in private with
one, the Charms of his Conversation are
beyond Expression, and very benefi∣cial.
I did believe as much, <HI>said the
Dutchess of—Laughing,</HI> but es∣pecially
when this good natur'd Legate
offers some Vows at the Feet of some
Female Saint, and prays her to be fa∣vourable
and propititious to him in his
Designs; I am apt to imagine there
are very few of these good Souls, who
are capable of refusing the Incence of∣fered
to them by so Holy a Man, and
of not Leaning to his Prayers with
pleasure, that would be no less than to
commit an unpardonable Crime. To
confess the Truth, Madam, <HI>said the
Dutchess</HI> de Crequi, without jesting,
that considering his uncommon Deport∣ment
in all his Actions, 'tis a very
hard Tryal, not to give ear and be∣lieve
him in every thing he says; I
don't believe, that among all the Cardi∣nals,
<PB N="233" REF="237"/>
there is one who is so Aimable
and less bigotted than he, every thing
is easie, every thing is frank with
him; but after all, you must be pretty
well acquainted with him, before you
can rightly known him. My Dear, <HI>re∣ply'd
the Dutchess of—with
an agreeable Air,</HI> you have drawn us
the Cardinal's Picture like an Accom∣plish'd
Person, and one without Faults;
How Fortunate you are to meet with so
many Charms and Merits centred in
one Man; their Sex is most common∣ly
no more than a Composition of Pride
and Dissimulation, subject to continual
Change, and in whom you dare not put
much confidence. I am very sensible
of that Madam, <HI>return'd the Dutch∣ess
of</HI> Crequi <HI>sighing,</HI> but I can assure
you, those Faults you speak of don't
belong to our Legate, it may be said of
him, that he is the <HI>Phenix</HI> among
Men, being the only one in his kind.
Then make the best, <HI>reply'd the
Dutchess of</HI>—of these incom∣parable
Qualifications of your <HI>Phenix,</HI>
and have a care he does not give you
<PB N="234" REF="238"/>
the slip, such a dainty Morsel as this
may be soon snatch'd from you, unless
you keep it lock'd up very carefully. I
take abundance of care of that, Madam,
<HI>reply'd the Dutchess</HI> de Crequi <HI>mer∣rily;</HI>
the place where he takes his rest,
and where we put him, is kept very
close, and the Entrance to it is very
small, and he is extreamly pleased with
his Quarters; which makes me believe
he will continue there for a great while.
<HI>The Dutchess of—who had
a mind to take a Walk, chang'd the
Discourse, and sung these Words as
she was rising from her Seat, and
looking at the Dutchess</HI> de Crequi;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The least chargeable Birds, and such
as are least fitted for Flight, are
in time tired with the Cage.</HEAD>
<P>The Dutchess <HI>de Crequi</HI> fully con∣vinced
of the Constancy of her Gal∣lant,
returned no Answer, but by a
Malicious Smile, and attended the
Dutchess of—in her Walks,
which proved very pleasant: As
<PB N="235" REF="239"/>
they were coming back, they saw at
a distance, some Horsemen and
Coaches, which were going to pay
them a Visit; this made them make
more haste home, where every thing
was in readiness for an agreeable Re∣ception
of that Illustrious Company,
of several Princes and Princesses, who
were come from Court sooner than
ordinary, to surprise the Dutchess
when she least expected them. A∣mong
these was the Prince <HI>de Conde,</HI>
who, tho' most Passionately in Love
with Madam <HI>de Chatillon,</HI> had never∣theless
a strong Inclination for the
Dutchess of—being a great
Admirer of her extraordinary Qua∣lifications;
so that in a little time
his Esteem began to turn into Love,
which appeared not to be displea∣sing
to the Dutchess of—be∣ing
willing to revenge her self at
this rate upon the Duke of—
and the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who she
actually believed had quite forgot
her. But alas! the poor Count, in
his Unhappy Exilement, had no o∣ther
<PB N="236" REF="240"/>
Thoughts but of his Adorable
Dutchess, to whom he Sacrificed
all the remainder of his Repose;
all his Sentiments were bestow'd that
way, which sometimes served to al∣lay,
in some measure, the Tedious∣ness
of his Solitude. At last, one day
being guite tired with thinking and
Vexation to hear no News from her,
he resolved to venture at the sending
of a Letter, to represent the true
Sentiments of his Heart, and to write
it under a disguised Name and Cha∣racter.
This Letter coming safely
to the Dutchess of—Hands,
she soon knew the Charming Style
of it, which was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="237" REF="241"/>
<HEAD>The Count de Guiche's Letter, to
the Dutchess of—</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“THere is no Punishment like
what I suffer, being deprived
of seeing you, every thing seems
insupportable to me in my Exile∣ment,
even not excepting my own
Person; and if, <HI>Madam,</HI> you have
any Compassion, you ought, out
of a Motive of Charity to bestow
it upon an Unfortunate Man, who
has Sacrificed every thing to please
you, and to secure to you a Heart
which will never cease to be yours.
O Heavens! who are Witnesses of
what Pains I undergo, Can any
Martyrdom be comparable to mine,
being deprived of the Object that
set my Heart on Fire; that most
dreadful Death would be prefer∣able
to those insupportable Inqui∣etudes,
which I feel both Day and
Night; I fear least, (but perhaps
<PB N="238" REF="242"/>
without reason) my most Adora∣ble
Dutchess should have forgot
and banish'd me from her Remem∣brance;
alas! this would prove
the finishing Stroak to put a Peri∣od
to my Life, which I linger out
for some time, but will soon be
lost, unless you support it, <HI>Madam,</HI>
by some agreeable Hopes which
will still receive its Native Vigour.
Pray don't refuse to give some
Consolation to the most Languish∣ing
and most Passionate of Men▪
who would think my self above
every thing that may be call'd
Great and Sublime, could he be
once more so Fortunate at one time
or other, as to tell you, <HI>Madam,</HI>
at your Feet, that nothing but
Death was capable to efface you
out of his Mind.”</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Count de….</HEAD>
<P>Now the Dutchess of—was
by this time sufficiently inclined
<PB N="239" REF="243"/>
to forget the Count, seeing every
day a World of new Admirers at
her Feet; she was nevertheless very
well pleased when she perused his
Letter, out of a piece of Vanity Na∣tural
to all Women, who when they
are to lose their Lovers; nay, tho
they are not very fond of their Gal∣lants,
they are always very Ambiti∣ous
of having a great number of
Admirers, and love to keep them as
long as they can. This was, as I
suppose, the true Motive which in∣duced
the Dutchess of—to
be pleased with the Count <HI>de Gui∣che</HI>'s
Letter; perhaps they might be
slender Remnants of kindness she
had preserved for him; but be that
as it will, she seem'd to be very well
satisfy'd with the Letter, nay, she
kiss'd and read it over several times,
and upon enquiry that she might
safely entrust the Bearer thereof
with an Answer, she went into her
Closet, where she writ to him in
haste the following Lines.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="240" REF="244"/>
<HEAD>The Dutchess of—Letter, to the
Count de Guiche.</HEAD>
<OPENER>My Dear Count,</OPENER>
<P>“TO tell you true, I did believe
you had forgot me for ever;
but now am convinced I was in
the wrong, and that I have been
unjust to call in question the Fide∣lity
of a Heart you preserve, as you
say, entirely for me. I suffer a
thousand Mortal Inquietudes since
you have been absent, a thing that
touches me to the Heart, and I do
all that lies in my Power to make
your Peace at Court. I desire you
<HI>Count,</HI> to rest satisfy'd of my good
Intentions for you, and of my de∣sire
of seeing you once more in my
Life. The Duke of—and
all the rest, whom I don't think
fit to name, have had their full
share of Vexation, by my Indiffe∣rency
towards them; I know it is
a Sin not to forgive our Neigh∣bour,
<PB N="241" REF="245"/>
and that it is a Precept of
Christian Morality we ought most
of all to put in practise; but I
know not how to bring my self to
do it; I am not able to banish
from my Heart, the hatred I have
conceived against these Enemies of
my Repose and Satisfaction. Fare∣wel,
<HI>dear Count,</HI> be satisfy'd that I
have always been very Affectionate
to your Interest, and to every thing
that concerns you ….”</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I give you leave to guess at the
Count <HI>de Guiche</HI>'s Satisfaction, when
he received the Dutchess of—
Letter, which revived him as it were
from the Dead, according to the u∣sual
Style of Lovers, and once more
raised his drooping hopes, which at
certain Intervals, were reduced to a
very low condition. Never did a
Man appear so well contented in the
midst of his Pain; his only delight
used to entertain his Melancholy
Thoughts in some Solitary Woods,
<PB N="242" REF="246"/>
and now he pitch'd upon the same
place, and spent several days suc∣cessively
in relishing the Pleasures of
his Love in his Imaginations, and
to recal to his Mind those happy
Moments he had enjoy'd at the
Feet of his Dutchess. These were
the daily Occupations of the Count
in his Exilement. But let us leave
him to his Imaginary Enjoyments,
and see whether the Dutchess of
—did in the mean while take
some more real Pleasures, such as
were more proper to give Satisfacti∣on
to her Senses. The Dutchess of
—seeing her self without a
Love Intrigue, soon resolved to en∣ter
upon another Engagement of
that nature; for the God of Love,
who is more Jealous of his Glory
than any other Deity, thought it not
for his Interest, to let so Fair a
Conquest slip out of his Hands, to
the great Detriment of his Empire;
the Lord <HI>Grave,</HI> and the Count <HI>de
Lude,</HI> did not sigh long in vain at
her Feet, but met with a favourable
<PB N="243" REF="247"/>
Reception at her Hands, in spite of
all the Duke's Envy and Jealousie,
which almost exceeded the Bounds
of Reason; but being tired with the
Dutchess's Indifferency, he amused
himself with his Coque<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es among
the Ladies, making his Addresses to
all that would but accept of them.
One day the Duke being more A∣morous
than commonly he used to
be, and entertaining the Baroness of
—he had a great Inclination in
the first heat of his Passion, to a∣scend
the Hill of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> and
visit the dwelling place of the Mu∣ses:
But this Lady, who had a great
many Gallants, who took up all her
time, and seldom fail'd to attend
her, would not suffer the Duke of
<HI>O</HI>—<HI>s</HI> to get footing in her Domi∣nions;
whereat he being entirely
dissatisfy'd, made him resolve to
take up once more with the Coun∣tess
<HI>d'Olone.</HI> This Lady being at that
time not over crowded with Gal∣lants,
was then lying upon a Green
Bank in a careless Nightdress; the
<PB N="244" REF="248"/>
Duke entring the Garden without
much Ceremony, and taking her by
the Chin, found it wet all over; <HI>O!
Madam,</HI> said he to her withdrawing
his Hand, <HI>who was it, that has water∣ed
your Grounds, it is overflowed eve∣ry
where, I intended to have planted
something there, but find it impractica∣ble?
Let not that hinder you, Sir,</HI>
reply'd she with a languishing Look,
<HI>from pursuing your Designs, we will
take care to drain it, and make it fit
to cherish the Plant you intend to plant
there.</HI> The Duke of <HI>O</HI>—<HI>s,</HI> whose
Inclinations were check'd by this
Accident, thought it his best way to
defer the Business to another more
convenient time, leaving the Ground
to be Cultivated by the Count <HI>de</HI>
—who was an excellent Gardi∣ner,
and who knew the Art of plea∣sing
her Ladyship, who was the Mi∣stress
of it. The Duke of <HI>O</HI>—<HI>s</HI>
had no sooner left the Countess, but
he return'd to his Palace, distracted
with variety of Thoughts, where
he gave an account of his whole
<PB N="245" REF="249"/>
ventures to the Prince <HI>de Conde,</HI> who
came to pay him a Visit; <HI>Did you
but know, dear Cousin,</HI> said he with
his usual Ingenuity, <HI>how far I was
disgusted at the Impudence of this Wo∣man,
which put such a Check upon me,
that it was impossible for me to come
near her; you would stand amazed at
it. O!</HI> cry'd he with a Scornful
<HI>Look,</HI> how nauseous is the Female Sex,
and how impotent are their Charms,
when once they have bid farewel to Mo∣desty
and Moderation, and have not
the power to refuse a good Turn. How,
Cousin, would you have a Woman stand
it out to the last Extremity in an A∣morous
<HI>Siege,</HI> reply'd the Prince <HI>de
Conde,</HI> Laughing as loud as he cou'd,
<HI>certainly you are of a different Opini∣on
from most People, who look upon
those that are pretty pliable as the most
Aimable and most Engaging. I don't
understand that,</HI> return'd the Duke
of <HI>O</HI>—<HI>s</HI> Smiling, <HI>I like a little
Opposition, when I make my Addresses
to a Lady, methinks it makes Love re∣lish
the better: There is something in
<PB N="246" REF="250"/>
what you say, Sir, but there is a consi∣de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able
difference betwixt the beginning
and the end of a thing,</HI> reply'd the
Prince Laughing, <HI>in point of Gallan∣try;
so soon as a Lady has let the
Mouse dig a hole in the Cheese, all
Dissimulation and Compliments are
out of Season: Vpon such Occasions as
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se I would have them follow the
Advice of my Female Acquaintance,
who seeing two Lovers that had a Ten∣derness
for one another, caressing toge∣ther
without coming to the Point, What
makes you thus trifle away your Time,</HI>
said she, <HI>since your Love is reciprocal.</HI>
The Duke, who is always starting
Difficulties, and very irresolute in
every thing, did still perfist in his
Opinion in opposition to the Prince
<HI>de Conde,</HI> till at last they parted.</P>
<P>The last having a mind to divert
himself with one of his Mistresses at
the Duke's cost, told her the Subject
of their Conversation, and this La∣dy
having not Discretion enough to
keep it to her self, communicated it
to some others of their Acquain∣tance,
<PB N="247" REF="251"/>
till at last it came to the
Duke's Ear, who ever since concei∣ved
a Grudge against the Prince <HI>de
Conde;</HI> and he being naturally of
an unequal and fickle Temper, he
likewise broke off with some of his
Friends, who Laugh'd in private at
his Folly. Some Months after, the
Duke, capricious even in his Devo∣tions,
made a new Vow to a certain
Saint he had made choice of, among
all the rest of these happy Intelli∣gences;
him he chose for his Patron,
and kept pretty constant to him for
a considerable time, if we may guess
at it by the vast number of Prayers
address'd to him; whereof we
thought fit to insert one, which
happened to fall into our Hands, a∣mong
some other Memoirs of the
Duke of <HI>O—s</HI>'s Life, written
with his own Hand.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="prayer">
<PB N="248" REF="252"/>
<HEAD>A Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yer to St. Remy, the Martyr.</HEAD>
<P>“GReat Saint, who illuminates to
the highest Degree, the Re∣bellious
and Vicious Eyes of the
Flesh, preserve my Soul, thro' thy
Goodness and Sufferings, from the
Temptations of the Devil, and the
piercing Sting of Sin, which com∣municates
its Poison to us poor
Mortals, and spreads within us a
Poysonous Scent, destructive to our
Salvation: This Mercy I hope for
from you, good Saint, whose Com∣passion
is infinitely beyond all
Bounds; not one of your Brother
Saints has hitherto been pleased to
give Ear to my Prayers, in such a
manner as I could have wish'd it,
either for Power or Good Will:
This has made me often change
my Patron, after having thrown
away upon them, abundance of In∣cense,
which I heartily repent of
sometimes: But as for you who
<PB N="249" REF="253"/>
are the Favourite of Heaven and
Angels, and beloved by the whole
Spiritual and Blessed Host, I don't
in the least doubt, but that you
will hearken to my Prayers, and
fill my Heart with Satisfaction and
Joy.” <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>By this well fram'd Prayer you
may see, that the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI>
takes abundance of care of the Wel∣fare
and Tranquility of his Soul, the
greatest Happiness a Man can enjoy.
The Catholick Religion teaches us,
that we must obtain Paradise by
good Works, and that without them
there is no Salvation; this makes
him sometimes tell his Intimate
Friends, that to forbear going into
the Wars, is a Charitable Action,
for fear you should kill one of your
own Kind, and this is his Reason,
why he does not appear at the head
of any of his Majesty's Armies; first
of all, for fear of being kill'd him∣self,
which is Self-Murther, according
<PB N="250" REF="254"/>
to St. <HI>Remy</HI>'s Doctrine, who expres∣ly
forbids it; and secondly, for fear
he should kill any Body else. These
are the specious Reasons which
has made the Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> lead
an Idle Life, and be useless to the
State. But to return to the Vow
he had made to his beloved Saint.
A few Days after the Conclusion of
<HI>Lent,</HI> our Duke, to make himself a∣mends
for several Weeks Devotion,
went abroad a Fishing for divers
Days successively, dress'd up like an
Apostle, in Company of some of his
Brethren, who wore a loose Gown,
as well as himself, and a Leather
Girdle, with many Knots in it, by
way of Penance. These Fishermen
row'd in several Boats upon the
<HI>Seine,</HI> some with Fishing Rods, o∣thers
with Casting Nets; After they
had for a considerable time row'd up
and down in the River, by good
chance they catch'd abundance of
Fish of all sorts in the Net, to the
great satisfaction of the Duke of
<HI>O—s,</HI> the Founder of the Feast.
<PB N="251" REF="255"/>
He return'd his unfeigned Thanks a
thousand times to St. <HI>Remy,</HI> and kis∣sed,
in the Presence of his Brethren,
his little Image he wore in his Hat
as well as they did, making a most
sincere promise to him, as <HI>Lewis</HI> XI.
did, who wore the Image of our
Lady in Lead, on the foremost part
of his Crown, that he would always
remember him as long as he lived.
The Feast being ended, each of these
Disciples return'd to his own home,
in his Apostles Garb. The Dutchess
of—seeing the Duke enter the
Palace under this Disguise (she be∣ing
a Lady of a Merry Disposition)
could not forbear Laughing hearti∣ly,
which the Duke full of his Zeal
perceiving, took very ill, and with
a Look of Indifferency, told her;
<HI>Madam, you pay but little Respect to
those that imitate the Saints: Do you
know that this loose Gown has a Ver∣tue
of curing several Distempers, and
keep us from Sinning. Then I don't
wonder, Sir, that you wear it,</HI> reply'd
the Dutchess Laughing more hearti∣ly
<PB N="252" REF="256"/>
than she did before, <HI>you that dread
so much the Temptations of the Flesh,
and a Habit of sinning in that kind,
and this I suppose is the reason that
makes you change your Inclinations and
Mistresses so often. 'Tis true, Madam,</HI>
answered the Duke in a milder Tone,
and with a Smile, <HI>If I were to fol∣low
the Advice of my Father Confessor,
I must be obliged to change oftner still,
than I do: The Good Father is so nice
and severe against customary Sins, that
at his rate, one must have a new one
every Month, or every Week. Truly,</HI>
reply'd the Dutchess Laughing a∣loud,
<HI>these Charitable Lessons of the
Religious Father, are enough to make
Men inconstant, if those that are guil∣ty
of that frailty of Loving the Fair
Sex, are either sincere or Fools enough
to let them know every thing they do,
or think. At that rate, Madam,</HI> re∣ply'd
the Duke with an angry Coun∣tenance,
<HI>you call Auricular Confession
a Folly; what would become of the</HI>
Catholick Religion <HI>without this Mor∣tification,
which curbs our Inclinations
<PB N="253" REF="257"/>
and hinders us from abandoning our
selves entirely to our Lust: I know
very well what I said,</HI> reply'd the
Dutchess interrupting him, <HI>my mean∣ing
was, that in a case of Gallantry,
or some other insignificant Trifles, one
need not be so sincere and open hearted
to ones Confessor; for their Inclinati∣ons
being very often on the wrong side
as well as our own, being sinful Men,
as well as the rest of Mankind, they
divert themselves with such like Con∣fessions,
at our cost.</HI> The Duke of
<HI>O—s</HI> who always paid a blind O∣bedience
to Religious Men, and the
Fathers of the Church, left the
Dutchess alone abruptly, and all the
time they were at Dinner would not
so much as say one word to her. He
was in the same Humour at Supper,
till the Dutchess breaking silence
first, ask'd how he liked the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Wine. <HI>'Tis admirable good, Madam,</HI>
reply'd he, scarce minding what she
said, and tasting only a little of it.
<HI>Father</HI> Amelot'<HI>s Health,</HI> return'd she
smiling, <HI>he is a Confessor that knows
<PB N="254" REF="258"/>
how to accommodate himself to the in∣constant
Temper of Men, who could have
thought that this Saint like Father,
could give such charitable Advice to his
Penitents, to change their Mistresses
once a Month, or once a Week; and
then surely,</HI> added the Dutchess cold∣ly,
<HI>they will commit no customary Sin,
nor of any great consequence.</HI> The
Duke of <HI>O</HI>—<HI>s,</HI> who found the
Dutchess in a Jesting Humour, would
not return her one word in answer,
but arose from the Table sooner
than he used to do, and shut him∣self
up in his Bed Chamber, without
making her the usual Compliments.
The next day following the Dutch∣ess
of—tired with the Duke's
Capricious Temper, had a mind to
divert her Domestick Vexations in
the Company of the Count <HI>de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ude,</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Grave:</HI> This last of
these two entertain'd her all that day
with abundance of Tenderness, and
represented his Passion to her in its
true Natural Colours; his Addresses
were not altogether received with
<PB N="255" REF="259"/>
Indifferency; for the Dutchess told
him, that if he proved as sincere as
he pretended to be, he might hope
to be believed. <HI>Can you question it,
Madam,</HI> cry'd the <HI>English</HI> Lord,
throwing himself at her Feet with a
most Passionate Air, <HI>what Mortal on
Earth could be guilty of such a piece
of Dissimulation to the Fairest Lady in
the World, unless, out of Respect, he
should not dare to discover his real
Sentiments. O!</HI> added he sighing,
<HI>I am perhaps too sincere for my Re∣pose.
Sincerity, my Lord,</HI> reply'd the
Dutchess with a tender Look, <HI>is s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣dom
blamed in a Lover, especially since
it is such a Rarity among Men at this
time. Madam,</HI> said my Lord quite
transported, <HI>this Qualification is not
so rarely to be met with in</HI> England,
<HI>as it is in</HI> France; <HI>our</HI> English <HI>Gen∣tlemen
take a Pride in being sincere
and faithful in all their Actions. Some
of them my Lord,</HI> reply'd the Dutch∣ess
of—Smiling, <HI>for I have
known others of that Nation, who are
not so nice in point of Conscience, and
<PB N="256" REF="260"/>
who will not be scrupulous to deceive a
Woman, as well as the</HI> French, <HI>who
have their Tears, Sighs and Complaints
at hand, whenever they are inclined to
weep, sigh and complain: You know,</HI>
continued she with a Charming
Air, <HI>the Duke</HI> de la Fayette? <HI>I be∣lieve
I have seen him a thousand times
Weeping at the Feet of a certain Fair
Lady, whom he pretended to Love,
from the very bottom of his Heart and
Soul, and Laughing within a Moment
after, as loud as he could, like a Fool.
Is not this an insupportable Piece of
Extravagancy, which would make one
Laugh at such Fools. I remember one
Day, this Lover being in one of his
pretended furious Fits, was going to
run himself through with his Sword,
which all the while remain'd immovea∣ble
in the Scabbard, had he not been
prevented by his good natur'd Goddess,
who had simplicity enough to run into
his Arms. A pretty Trick indeed,</HI> said
the <HI>English</HI> Lord, <HI>I suppose, Madam,
you may easily guess, all these Grimaces
were contrived only to get a Kiss o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="257" REF="261"/>
two from his Fair Mistress, who per∣haps
was well enough pleas'd with 'em.
Perhaps it may be so, my Lord,</HI> said
the Dutchess, <HI>but after all, 'tis cer∣tain,
that all these Faints are not plea∣sing
nor engaging, and that one single
grain of Sincerity, was a much better
Relish to the Pleasures of Love. Could
I be so Fortunate, Madam,</HI> reply'd the
<HI>English</HI> Lord, <HI>as to gain the least grain
of your Esteem upon that Score, I should
think my self the happiest Man on
Earth, and my Satisfaction would be
much beyond what I am able to express.
How do you talk, my Lord,</HI> reply'd
the Dutchess with an Engaging and
Endearing Air, <HI>what Time may pro∣duce,
and what you may hope for, that
Sincerity I require consists in this, that
you never say more than you actually
think. Will you give me leave, Most
Illustrious Dutchess,</HI> reply'd this Lo∣ver
embracing her Knees, <HI>to tell you
every thing I think when I am …
Yes, I allow you that freedom, my
Lord,</HI> return'd the Dutchess merrily,
<HI>let your Thoughts rove at Pleasure.
<PB N="258" REF="262"/>
The Sighs and Complaints of Lovers
ought to have their free course, for if
you stop the Current, they die on the
spot, and you know this would be very
cruel and too great a hardship upon the
poor Creatures.</HI> The Duke of <HI>O</HI>—<HI>s,</HI>
who had not spoke one word to the
Dutchess of—since the other
Night, had taken a Fancy of late,
to take every day a Solitary Walk
in the Wood, he happened to come
back from one of these Walks at
this time, attended only by a few,
and meeting with one of his Inti∣mate
Friends, who had more Malice
than good Sense, he was told by
him, That the Lord <HI>Grave</HI> had at∣tended
his Spouse the whole After∣noon,
which put him into a very bad
humour, and made him ask his
Friend, (rubbing his Forehead all
the while) whether he was there
still; <HI>yes, Sir,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>if you make
haste you will meet with him,</HI> so on he
went as fast as he could, hoping to
catch him in the Dutchesses Lodg∣ing
Rooms; but she, who had her
<PB N="259" REF="263"/>
Spies abroad as well as he, desired
him in good time to be gone, so
soon as a certain Signal was given
her that the Duke was coming home.
The Duke had no sooner set his
Foot within the Palace, but strait
he runs up to the Dutchesses Apart∣ment,
who was reading some Novel
for her Diversion; but his Head be∣ing
full of those Notions that were
told him by his Friend, he would
not stir out of the Room for a con∣siderable
time, and at last his Curio∣sity
went so far as to desire her to
let him have the Key of her Closet,
pretending he left something there
that he wanted. The Dutchess
who knew her Gallant to be out of
reach, frankly opened the Closet,
and seeing him peeping into every
corner, reproach'd him, tho in very
handsome Terms, with his Jealous
Temper; and the Duke was not a
little vex'd with himself, to have
miss'd his aim, and been too credu∣lous.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="264"/>
<HI>The next day the Dutchess of
—having a mind to divert her
self at one of her Country Houses,
within a few Leagues of</HI> Paris, <HI>took
the Dutchess</HI> de Crequi <HI>and the Coun∣tess</HI>
de Soissons <HI>along with her. The
Countess having told it to my Lord</HI>
Grave, <HI>he came thither disguised in
a Country Maids Dress, under pre∣tence
of presenting them with some
Flowers of the Field the Dutchess
of—much admir'd, and used
to have them distill'd into cooling
Liquors, she had made use of in the
Summer Season. The disguised Lord
took his Opportunity when the
Ladies were taking a walk in a fair
Meadow near the Banks of the</HI>
Seine, <HI>and the Dutchess of—
had seated herself on a little Hillock,
seeing this pretended Damsel come
towards them, told Madam</HI> de Crequi
<HI>who sat next to her,</HI> pray Dutchess
mind this pretty Country Damsel, how
prettily she carries her Basket of Flowers.
<HI>The</HI> English <HI>Lord, who was tollera∣bly
handsome, and very well shap'd,
<PB N="261" REF="265"/>
had contrived his disguise in so ex∣act
and natural a way like a Coun∣try
Maid, that the Countess</HI> de Sois∣sons
<HI>thinking she intended not to
come their way, called and asked
her whither she was going.</HI> Madam,
<HI>reply'd the disguised Lord with an
agreeable Air,</HI> I am to go to the next
Village, to carry to the Dutchess of
—this Basket of Flowers, she
had ordered to be gathered for her;
but I don't very well know the way to
the House, I should be much obliged to
you if you will shew it me. Here it is
my dear, <HI>said the Dutchess of—
smiling,</HI> come nearer. <HI>The Country
Maid presented the Flowers to her
with so good a grace and in so re∣spectful
a manner, that she was
charm'd with her extraordinary De∣portment;
but whilst she was Com∣plimenting
the Dutchess of—
the Wind, which happened to be
pretty high that day, tiffed up her
white under Pettycoat, and disco∣vered
her Green Silk Stockings, which
the Dutchess of—knowing
<PB N="262" REF="266"/>
to be my Lords;</HI> O! my Lord, <HI>cry'd
she taking him by the Hand,</HI> who
thought to have met you here in this
Country Disguise; truly you have been
too hard for me, I verily took you for
a Country Maid. This is a very pretty
Device enough, to surprize Ladies, such
a one as I should not have so much as
dream'd of. See and mind Ladies,
<HI>said my Lord in a very submissive
manner,</HI> what a true and sincere Love
is capable of undertaking. I believe it
my Lord, <HI>said the Dutchess of</HI>—
doubtless you have some Shepherdess or
other here near this Wood, you intend
to surprize in her Innocence, and so
you are come to see whether some Amo∣rous
Shepherd or other does not endea∣vour
to play the same Game with her
in your Absence. That Goddess, Ma∣dam,
that has brought me hither, <HI>re∣ply'd
this Lover with a deep Sigh,</HI>
is in a Station far beyond me, and wor∣thy
the Adoration of the Vniverse.
Then my Lord, <HI>reply'd the Dutchess
of—Laughing,</HI> it seems it is
no less than a Deity, that has known
<PB N="263" REF="267"/>
how to Charm you at such a rate; for
we know that formerly, Men used to
fall desperately in Love with the Cele∣stial
Powers. Thus <HI>Endymion,</HI> that
famous Astrologer, whom <HI>Ovid</HI> so fre∣quently
introduces in his Works, was
so passionately in Love with the Moon,
call'd otherwise <HI>Diana,</HI> that he got soon
acquainted even with the least Move∣ment
of that Planet. Do you question,
Madam, <HI>said the Dutchess</HI> de Crequi
<HI>coldly,</HI> that my Lord does not hope
for the same Advantages as <HI>Endymion</HI>
had in respect to <HI>Diana.</HI> I suppose the
secret Motions of his Goddess are as
well known to him as those of <HI>Diana</HI>
were to this Astrologer. As far as I
see, <HI>said the Countess</HI> de Soissons,
there is abundance of Learning and
Conjuration in Love, notwithstanding
its being a Passion which is natural to
the most ignorant; nay, the unrational
Creatures themselves teach to Love,
and a Man must not be of the Offspring
of <HI>Adam,</HI> if he loves not a Woman;
and a Female must not be a Woman, if
she is able to resist the Artificial Insinu∣ations
<PB N="264" REF="268"/>
of Men. For my part, <HI>said the
Dutchess</HI> de Crequi, <HI>interrupting her
and Laughing aloud,</HI> I am actually of
Opinion, that the <HI>Serpent</HI> who insinu∣ated
himself into the Womans good
Opinion in the Terrestial Paradise,
appeared to her under the Shape of a
Man, for otherwise I am apt to believe
she would not have been so weak, to give
credit to what he said, and to be thus
bewitch'd by his Discourse. I am of
the same Opinion, <HI>said the Dutchess
of—arising from the Ground,</HI>
this flattering <HI>Serpent</HI> made use of the
Deceitfulness of Men, to seduce the
Woman, the Sovereign Creator of every
Creature hath bestowed upon the first
Man, being Jealous and Envious of
both their Happiness. <HI>The</HI> English
<HI>Lord, who had hitherto kept si∣lence
out of Respect to the Ladies,</HI>
will you give me leave Ladies, <HI>said he,</HI>
to give you my Opinion, which is not
incongruous to what some Authors
have maintained long ago, That <HI>Adam</HI>
being very solitary one Day in the
Garden, and having an Inclination
<PB N="265" REF="269"/>
to try his Wife's Constancy and Resolu∣tion,
transform'd himself into the
shape of this cunning Devil. An ad∣mirable
Thought, <HI>cry'd Madam</HI> de
Crequi <HI>with a Smile,</HI> because Men re∣tain
to this day most of the nature of
Serpents, which you know have a long
Tail, the true Emblem of the Treache∣ry,
Dissimulation and Flattery of Man∣kind.
You had better told us, <HI>said
the Countess</HI> de Soissons <HI>in a Jest,</HI> that
this part has some resemblance to what
is most agreeable to the Ladies. <HI>The
Dutchess of—blush'd at these
words, and told her,</HI> Countess, as far
as I can see, 'tis not without reason
you have the Reputation of being a Lo∣ver
of Tails. <HI>Madam</HI> de Soissons <HI>did
not think fit to return the least An∣swer,
perceiving she had been be∣tray'd
by the Marquess</HI> de Varde, <HI>(an
intimate Friend of the Count</HI> de
Guiche'<HI>s) and some others of her Fa∣vourites,
when she had got the By-Name
of the Countess</HI> of the Tail.
<HI>But to return to our Ladies, these
went back to the Dutchess of—
<PB N="266" REF="270"/>
House, and took my Lord along
with them, without allowing the
liberty to lay aside his Country
Maids Dress, which they liked so
extreamly well, he acting his Part to
the Life, that he got abundance of
Kisses among the Ladies, who fan∣cying
him to be actually what he
represented, made him a thousand
Caresses, telling her she look'd very
pretty in her Straw Hat. Love be∣ing
a thing that is catching, and gains
ground before we are sensible of it,
it was the Dutchess de Crequi</HI>'s <HI>Mis∣fortune
to be infected with it, and
to fall in Love with the</HI> English
<HI>Lord, who stay'd two whole days
with them in his Country Habit, and
used the same freedom there, as if he
had act ually been a Woman; and
to colour the matter, they had given
her the Name of</HI> Nivette. <HI>Never
was</HI> Nivette <HI>so much Caress'd and
Kiss'd in all her Life-time, as within
these few days, till they went back
to</HI> Paris.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="271"/>
Here the Ladies related my Lords
Adventure to some of their intimate
Acquaintance, and how pleasantly
they had pass'd their time in the
Country in his Company, to the sig∣nal
regret of the Dutchess of—
who fearing it might come to the
Duke of <HI>O—s</HI>'s Ears, whom she
knew to be addicted to that Plaguy
Disease of Jealousie; the best Expe∣dient
she thought she could pitch
upon, to remove his Inquietudes up∣on
that account, was, never to see
my Lord, except at the Dutchess <HI>de
Crequi</HI>'s, who, as I told you before,
was in Love with him. The Dutch∣ess
of—in whose Heart he had
made no great Progress as yet, was
neither jealous nor vex'd at it, and
the Dutchess <HI>de Crequi</HI>'s Cardinal
having got scent of this new In∣trigue,
would not suffer her to re∣ceive
his Visits any longer. My Lord
was overjoy'd thereat, his seeming
Tenderness for her being only an
effect of his Complaisance, and ha∣ving
never made any suitable return
<PB N="268" REF="272"/>
to her Caresses: The Dutchess of—
who used to see him afterwards now
and then <HI>incognito,</HI> having a mind
to jeer him, <HI>My Lord,</HI> said she, <HI>why
have you left of Visiting</HI> Madam de
Crequi? <HI>She will sometimes when I
see her, tell me with a Languishing
Tone, that you are made to please a
Woman, that every Word of yours
strikes to the very Heart: Certainly,</HI>
continued she merrily, <HI>you have given
her a home stroke, because the poor Wo∣man
feels it to this day, such Serpents
as you, I find, are dangerous Crea∣tures,
they seduce a Woman at first
sight. Don't you know how open
hearted the Countess of</HI> Soissons <HI>was to
us concerning the Serpents Tail, I know
a very pleasant Story of this Lady, con∣cerning
this matter, but that Modesty
will not permit me to tell it, however I
should be well enough pleased if a cer∣tain
Gentleman in the World, I know,
would tell it you for your Diversion.
Who is this Gentleman, Madam,</HI> said
my Lord smiling? <HI>'Tis the Marquiss</HI>
de Varde, <HI>who you know is her head
<PB N="269" REF="273"/>
Gallant,</HI> said the Dutchess of—
<HI>a Rattlebrain'd Coxcomb, tho' in out∣ward
appearance he seems to be a Per∣son
of Discretion. Yes, Madam,</HI> re∣ply'd
my Lord, <HI>I am sensible he must
needs be a discreet Person, because he
reveals the Secrets of a Woman, which
must needs be of the greatest consequence
to her, if she pretends to Modesty, and
to be at ease in the point of Love.
Poor Lady,</HI> reply'd the Dutchess of
—like one surprized, <HI>she at
ease in point of Love. I don't believe
that her Heart was ever satisfy'd with
any one of her Lovers, tho' she has had
a good number of them; she is always
craving for more than falls to her share.</HI>
My Lord could not forbear smiling at
the Dutchess of—Malicious
Thoughts, and judging it not con∣venient
to tell her his mind upon so
odious a Subject, he thought it more
for his purpose, to change the Scene,
and to enter upon the Point of
what Torments he felt, and what
indelible Impressions her Fair Eyes
had made on his Heart. <HI>I see my
<PB N="270" REF="274"/>
Lord,</HI> said the Dutchess of—
with a Charming Air, and a Tender
Look, <HI>you are very ill, 'tis high time
to ease your Pain. Most Divine Lady,</HI>
reply'd he Kissing her Hand, <HI>Alas!
I can't live unless you take pity of me.
What is to be done, my Lord,</HI> said the
Dutchess of—with a pleasing
Air, <HI>to make you live a little longer?
You want the same Remedies you found
your self so well by some Weeks ago;
but you must consider, you were then in
a Womans Garb, and upon that Score,
received more Favours than you can ex∣pect
at any other time. Madam,</HI> cry'd
my Lord, with an Amorous Tran∣sport,
<HI>pray give me leave to reassume
the same Habit, that so I may receive
another Favour at your Hands. There
is no need, my Lord, you should change
your Dress from Head to Foot. Look
here,</HI> said she, putting one of her
Head-dresses on his Head, and gi∣ving
him several Kisses, <HI>this is e∣nough:</HI>
These being attended by a
thousand seeming Caresses and ten∣der
Expressions, the poor Gentleman
<PB N="271" REF="275"/>
was so far overcome by his Passion,
that he had drop'd down in a
Swoon, had he not supported him∣self
by the Table. Being recovered
out of his Love Fit, he said to the
Lady with a very deep Sigh he
fetch'd from the bottom of his
Heart; <HI>I must confess, Charming
Dutchess, that amongst the Pleasures
framed by Nature, Love is that which
charms and affects us the most sensibly.
Are you still in a condition to be sensi∣ble
of it. My Lord,</HI> reply'd the
Dutchess of—smiling. <HI>I know
not what answer to give you upon that
Head, Madam,</HI> added he, <HI>I have had
a taste of what is commonly call'd Lo∣ving,
but never relish'd the true Sweets
of that Passion till now. Pray, my
Lord,</HI> said the Dutchess with a
Sigh, <HI>what do you call Beauty? Is it
that which Tyranizes over our Hearts
and enslaves them? Alas! I find you
never have made a Tryal as yet of these
hardstips that atended a Tyrannizing
Passion, which puts her Chains upon us,
without letting us know for what. I
<PB N="272" REF="276"/>
will tell you frankly, my Opinion, Ma∣dam,</HI>
reply'd the <HI>English Lord</HI> with a
serious Air, <HI>nothing can be more true
than what you say; it happened once to
be my ill Fortune, to fall in Love with
a young Lady in</HI> London, <HI>without be∣ing
sensible why, for she was neither
Handsome nor Well-shap'd, nor Witty;
but she was Mistress of a certain agree∣able
Air, a</HI> Je ne scay quoy, <HI>which
made me Love her in spight of all my
Resolution to the contrary; and her
tender Caresses, wherein she was not
very sparing, so far entangled my
Heart in a short time, that I was no
more my own Master, but altogether at
her Devotion. This is exactly the
way, my Lord, to catch such Men as
are immediately taken with the deceit∣ful
Insinuations and Caresses of every
Woman they meet with,</HI> said the
Dutchess of—with a Melan∣choly
Air, <HI>some Women are like the</HI>
Sirens, <HI>who Enchant Men to their De∣struction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not very long before you came to</HI>
Paris, <HI>there was a certain Lady of
<PB N="273" REF="277"/>
Quality, whose Name I am obliged to
conceal, who pretended to be in Love
as much as possibly could be with a
certain young Gentleman, who as his
ill Stars would have it, being Charm'd
with the Tenderness of this Fair Lady,
who harbour'd more Cruelty in her
Breast than a Tygress, one day when he
was with her, and thought himself the
most Fortunate Man living, by the ex∣cess
of her Caresses, she had taken care
to give her Husband notice of his being
there, who caused him to be Massacred,
and to be thrown out of a Window;
can there be any, Treachery like this? I
am sufficiently sensible, Madam,</HI> re∣ply'd
the <HI>English Lord</HI> sighing, <HI>the
sincerity of a Womans Heart is not to
be measured by her Caresses; But alas!
what are we able to do to stand out a∣gainst
them? It is a certain Frailty
which draws us into a thousand Mis∣fortunes.</HI>
Their Conversation had
not ended here, had not the Dutch∣ess
of—looking accidentally
out of a Window, seen some of the
Duke of <HI>O—s</HI>'s Attendance com∣ing
<PB N="274" REF="278"/>
into the Palace; which made
her tell my Lord; <HI>O make haste to
save your self, the Duke of</HI> O—s
<HI>is not far off;</HI> which he did accord∣ingly,
kissing her Hand with a most
profound Reverence, and some deep
Sighs, which meeting with a favou∣rable
Reception from the Dutchess
of—she told him with a ten∣der
Look, <HI>Go, go, my Lord, it shall
be remembred to your Advantage;
as well as</HI> …. The Duke of
<HI>O—s</HI> who come in at that instant
in a pensive Condition, put the
Dutchess a little out of Countenance,
while her Lover went his way, as
well satisfy'd as possibly can be ima∣gin'd.
The Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> went
into the Dutchesses Bed Chamber
without speaking one word to her,
which made her say with a smile to
one of her Ladies, <HI>that the Duke had
got some new whimsy in his head.</HI> In
the Afternoon the Duke of—
who ever since his late Vow he had
made to <HI>St. Remi,</HI> had taken a di∣staste
at the World, but especially
<PB N="275" REF="279"/>
at the Fair Sex, (who never were
his best Favourites) got on Horse∣back
in company of 3 of his inti∣mate
Friends to go a Hunting with
him, and after that to pass away
some time at St. <HI>Clou,</HI> as merrily as
possibly they could, as such a di∣stance
from Court. These 3 Gen∣tlemen,
whose Names I will forbear
to mention here, had perhaps as
weighty Motives to absent them∣selves
from Court as the Duke him∣self
had: One of these Three had
had the misfortune to present to one
of the most Fantastical Ladies of
our Times, a piece of Meat at a
Feast which she did not like; and
the other having apply'd himself for
his Diversion to the Study of Chi∣rurgery,
had put a Tent in the
Wound of a Lady of Quality, which
did produce an unexpected Operati∣on;
and the third affected a sort of
neglect of every thing he saw, be∣ing
resolved to turn <HI>Man hater;</HI> so
happy an Union of Tempers could
not but make them very merry, and
<PB N="276" REF="280"/>
they were not sparing for delicious
Liquors or Meats to encrease their
Mirth; when one of these Members
of the Society of Reformation, in∣terrupted
their pious Conversations
which run upon the Excellency of
<HI>Bacchus,</HI> and told them with an Air,
which sufficiently discovered his Re∣solution
of falling out with the
World. <HI>O!</HI> says he, <HI>how happy are
we at this time, to be out of the noise
of the Court, and remote from these
Vanities which disturb the Hearts of
Mankind, and make them Slaves to
their Chimerical Notions: But,</HI> added
he sighing, <HI>a Man must be induced
with peculiar Graces from above, to
take his farewell of these Passions,
which Tyrannize over our Hearts, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntangle us into inestimable Errors.
Nothing can be more charming than to
confine all our desires to please him
who has given us our Being; let us
work out our Salvation with fear and
trembling, yet so as not to deprive our
selves of the Enjoyments of good Chear,
<PB N="277" REF="281"/>
or to spoil our Eyes with continual
weeping for our Sins.</HI> This last Opi∣nion
having the Approbation of the
Duke and his Company, they spent
the whole Night in Drinking, and
the next day they went abroad a∣gain
a Hunting. After Supper they
were diverted with a Consort of
Musick, such a one as was not very
suitable to check the Concupiscencies
of our Senses; and after this our
<HI>Penitential Brethren</HI> run roaring
thro' the Streets in the Apostles
Dress, like a Company of Mad-men,
knocking at every Door they pass'd
by. The Duke of—who
felt still some Remnants of the Re∣bellious
Flesh, being at some distance
after the rest, and espying a Light
in a little Window, drew nearer,
and happening to see through the
Glass a very handsome young Wo∣man,
he had not sufficient Power to
keep under these Carnal Commoti∣ons
of his vigorous Body, in spite
of all the Resistance and Addresses
<PB N="278" REF="282"/>
he was able to make to that Saint,
the Image whereof he wore in his
Hat, to <HI>protect him against all Tem∣tations
of the Flesh.</HI> But being inter∣rupted
and call'd for by the Duke
of <HI>O—s</HI> and his Companions, they
went to hear Mass in 2 or 3 Places
as soon as it was day break, and ha∣ving
dipt their Faces all over in <HI>Ho∣ly
Water,</HI> and fortify'd themselves
with a good number of Sings of the
Cross, they took a most plentiful
and delicious Breakfast, and after
this, taking a Walk in the Park,
and the Diversion of a set of Vio∣lins,
they retired into a Wood, with
these Marks of Tranquility and Ease
in their Countenances, as are com∣monly
observed in those who easily
set their Consciences at rest, their
discourse all this while running up∣on
nothing else but how to despise
the World, and to try the Conver∣sation
of Mankind. Being well
tired with these frivolous Reflecti∣ons,
the Duke of—who still
<PB N="279" REF="283"/>
retained in his Remembrance the
Fair one he happened to see the
Night before, took a Resolution to
go to the same Place again at the
same hour, and to try whether he
could not come to the Speech of her,
while the Family was asleep, which
he did without much difficulty;
for this pretty Girl had a Gallant,
whom she durst not see but in the
Night time, for fear of her Friends;
but so it happened by good Chance,
that missing to come that Evening at
the usual time, the Duke had an
Opportunity of talking to her; and
the young Wench, who thought no
otherwise by his Apostles dress, but
that he had been some honest Fryar,
who had lost his way, was so Cha∣ritable
as to take him in, and not
long after fell asleep: The Duke,
who saw her lie in a little Bed, being
mightily smitten with her Charms,
went after her into the Chamber,
and finding her half asleep, had
sufficient Time and Opportunity to
<PB N="280" REF="284"/>
commit some Amorous Robberies,
without the least resistance on her
side, imagining no otherwise than
that it was really her Gallant, who
used to entertain her thus all the
Night long. The Duke soon found
out her Mistake, (while he clasp'd
her in his Arms and Kis'd her)
when he heard her say; <HI>My dear</HI>
Troil, <HI>you Squeeze me to Death, but
your Caresses are very engaging;</HI> (this
being the Name of her Gallant) but
our Apostle, who was no Novice in
Gallantry, was not forward to un∣deceive
his Fair Companion, but
got as many Favours as he could of
his Fair unknown, who was not ve∣ry
covetous of them, being ignorant
upon whom she bestow'd them, be∣cause
<HI>in the Dark all Cats are Grey.</HI>
Day break now beginning to appear,
the Duke got out of his Quarters as
well satisfy'd as if he had been a
King, tho not without some regret
to see himself obliged to leave a
Place, which had afforded him such
<PB N="281" REF="285"/>
Enjoyments; for he own'd after∣wards,
that he never met with so
sweet and pleasant a Road in the
whole Empire of <HI>Venus,</HI> as this. The
Duke of <HI>O—s</HI> did also not fail to
take his own Diversions, and being
somewhat tired, fell asleep towards
Morning, when the Duke of—
came home and went to Bed, with
as much Privacy, as if he had been
there all Night: For the Count of
—who lay in the same Cham∣ber,
being so fast asleep, as well as
their Domesticks, as if they had ta∣ken
a Dose of <HI>Opium,</HI> no Body knew
of his coming into the House. In
the Forenoon the Duke went into
the Duke of—Chamber, and
finding him still in Bed, <HI>I don't ima∣gine,</HI>
says he, <HI>Sir, that the Road you
chose is that which is to lead you to
Glory:</HI> And the Duke was so frank
as to confess his Frailty in that kind,
telling him, That they must address
themselves in a peculiar Prayer to
the Pious St. <HI>Remi,</HI> to desire him,
<PB N="282" REF="286"/>
not to enter into his Book this Fault,
which was owing to human Frailty,
for want of sufficient strength to re∣sist
the Force and Temptations of
Sin: The Proposition meeting with
a general Approbation, our Penitents
were no sooner got out of Bed, but
upon their Marrowbones recited the
following short Prayer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="prayer">
<HEAD>The Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>“INcomparable Saint, the Fairest
and Brightest of all those that
dwell in Heaven; see here we are
at your Feet, most humbly beseech∣ing
you, not to call us to an ac∣count
for all the Sins of our Youth.
You are doubtless not ignorant,
Great Martyr, how Rebellious a
thing the Flesh is, and how diffi∣cult
a Task it is, to bridle it. The
Desires of Concupiscency are revi∣ved
in me daily, in spight of all
our Endeavours to keep them un∣der.
<PB N="283" REF="287"/>
Alas! Favourite of Heaven,
how often have we attempted to
check the Titillations of the Flesh,
which from time to time insinuate
themselves into our Hearts. The
Pleasures of the Senses are the dead∣ly
Enticements to Vice, which are
common to all Men, and will, good
Saint, entirely play the Masters o∣ver
us, unless you take pity of us
poor Sinners, and shelter us under
your Shade, which is the Refuge
of afflicted Souls.” <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Besides this short Prayer, they had
recourse also to other Mortifications
and Actions of Devotion, such as
the scourging of their Sinful Parts
with Rods: After this, they went
to Dinner, where they took care to
eat and drink, like Penitents, who
stood in need of good and comfor∣table
Refreshments, after their Pe∣nances.
The Afternoon was spent,
in making Reflections upon the tran∣sitoriness
<PB N="284" REF="288"/>
of Human Affairs, and up∣on
certain Points of Morality, as
also in making a serious Application
of their Penance, towards the ob∣taining
of their Salvation. Toward
the Evening the good Company, af∣ter
having embraced one another,
return'd to <HI>Paris</HI> every one to his
own home, in order to recollect in
their respective Retirements, what
Satisfaction and Vexation they had
received in their Progress; the Duke
of <HI>O—s</HI> protesting to them at part∣ing,
that he would from that Mi∣nute
begin to endeavour to procure
the Peace of his Soul, in hopes that
by the Pious and Wonderful Con∣duct
of his Life, he might obtain a
Place in the Calendar among the
Saints.</P>
<P>But the Dutchess of—who
had improved her Husband's Ab∣sence
to her own Advantage, had
pass'd her time pleasantly enough
with the Count <HI>de Lude;</HI> and the Sa∣tisfaction
she had taken in his Con∣versation,
<PB N="285" REF="289"/>
being such as served only
to whet her Appetite, she was re∣solved
not to let slip the next op∣portunity
that should offer, which
happen'd soon after: For the Duke
of—being at his Devotions in
the <HI>Chappel Royal,</HI> the Count <HI>de
Lude</HI> fail'd not to make a Visit at
the Dutchess's, who was as yet in her
<HI>Dishabilee.</HI> His Reception was very
favourable, and as soon as she was
Dress'd, she conducted him into a
large Closet, ordering her Women
(that were her Confidents) to tell
the Duke when he came home, that
she was gone abroad a Visiting. <HI>So
early,</HI> said the Duke not without
some Surprize when he was told so,
<HI>it is not late enough yet to be seen a∣bout
the Streets;</HI> and so went into
his Closet, and took a Book of De∣votion
to read in. The Dutchess
in the mean while being very unea∣sie,
while the Count entertain'd her
with the most Charming and most
Tender Expressions in the World,
<PB N="286" REF="290"/>
embracing her Knees with inexpres∣sible
Transports of Pleasure: <HI>Alas,
Count,</HI> says she with an engaging
Voice, <HI>we dread that most we do not
care to see: The Duke is Jealous to a
degree of Madness; and I should run
distracted, if he should hear that you
are here.</HI> My Lord <HI>Grave</HI> happen∣ing
to pass by that way in a Coach,
and espying the Count's Livery, be∣gan
to mistrust the matter, that he
was become his Rival, and was at
that very time with the Dutchess of
—which was a sufficient Mo∣tive
for him to pay a Visit to her
likewise; but the Dutchess was in∣visible
that Morning to every Body
else, but the Count <HI>de Lude,</HI> who
took his leave of her soon after, ha∣ving
first conducted her to the
Church of <HI>our Lady;</HI> whither she
went to hear a famous Preacher,
that was to Preach there that day.
The Duke seeing her come home∣ward,
being exceedingly troubled at
that time with his old Distemper,
<PB N="287" REF="291"/>
<HI>Jealousie,</HI> told her, while he was
rubbing his Forehead. <HI>Well, Madam,
how do you like Father</HI> Archangel'<HI>s
Sermon, have you received any Benefit
by his Moral Precepts, and by that
dreadful Judgment he denounced to
Sinners. I protest to you, Sir,</HI> reply'd
the Dutchess acting the Bigot to the
Life, <HI>I never heard a more Learned
and Judicious Man in all my Life:
Oh! what a most surprizing way he
had,</HI> continued she lifting up her
Eyes towards Heaven, <HI>to ravish our
Souls and raise them up to the Celestial
Paradise. Will you be pleased to tell
me, Madam,</HI> said the Duke, <HI>where he
took his Text? Yes, Sir,</HI> reply'd she
coldly, <HI>it was out of the Lamentations
of the Prophet</HI> Jeremiah, Chap. 3.
v. 10. <HI>where this Holy Man laments
his being abandon'd by Heaven.</HI> They
lived together after this for some
time in a tolerable State of Tranqui∣lity,
the Duke's Jealousie being
somewhat allay'd by the Dutchess's
dextrous Answer, when a Journey
<PB N="288" REF="292"/>
for <HI>Flanders</HI> was hotly talk'd of at
Court. the Dutchess of—be∣ing
at that time very desirous once
more to see her Brother King <HI>Charles</HI>
the II. of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> left the
Court at <HI>Lisle,</HI> attended by her own
Domesticks, and the Count de <HI>Lude</HI>
and my Lord <HI>Grave,</HI> who had also
an Inclination to take a turn into
<HI>England.</HI> The King of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI>
went to meet them at <HI>Dover,</HI>
and the Interview pass'd with ex∣cessive
Demonstrations of mutual
Tenderness, as if they had been
foretold, that this was to be the
last time they should see one ano∣ther.
Upon the coming back of
the Court to <HI>Paris,</HI> the Dutchess of
<HI>O—s</HI> fell into a very deep Melan∣choly,
which was taken notice of
by every body, for she shew'd in all
her Actions a certain carelessness for
all the Vanities and Pleasures of the
World; tho in the midst of this
Languishment, she continued to be
the Object of Adoration of all that
<PB N="289" REF="293"/>
beheld her, without producing a∣ny
thing but Indifferency on her
side. One day, the King, whose
Inclinations were still for her, ap∣pointed
a Ball on purpose to divert
her, and had taken her out to Dance
several times; she went into ano∣ther
Room, and desired something
to Drink, being excessive▪ dry:
A Glass of Lemonade was brought
her, which she took off very hasti∣ly,
and was supposed to be the
Cause of her Death.</P>
<P>During her Sickness, which was
of no long Continuance, she decla∣red
to all that had the Honour to
see her, That she was willing to
leave the World, without the least
regret.</P>
<P>The King, was highly afflicted at
her Death, and so was the whole
Court, at least in outward appear∣ance:
She was Interr'd at St. <HI>Dennis</HI>
among the Royal Tombs. While
the Court was in Mourning, no Di∣versions
were allow'd of there, un∣less
<PB N="290" REF="294"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were in private. The Duke
of <HI>O—s</HI> appear'd almost incon∣solable
for the Loss of his Illustrious
Spouse, not being able to forget her
for some time; till at last the Mar∣riage
that was proposed betwixt
him and the <HI>Elector Palatine</HI>'s
Daughter some Years after, put an
end to his Affliction.</P>
<P>The Court <HI>de Guiche</HI> soon after
writ a Letter out of <HI>Sweden</HI> to the
Marquiss <HI>de Varde,</HI> his most inti∣mate
Friend, concerning a Success∣ful
Amorous Intrigue he was enga∣ged
in, with one of the Gallantest
Ladies of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Court.</P>
<LETTER>

<HEAD>The Count de Guiche's Letter, to the
Marquiss de Varde.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Friend,</OPENER>
<P>“TIS high time to write you
some News concerning my
Pleasures as well as my Pains, and
to give you the true Pourtraiture
of <HI>Love</HI> here in <HI>Sweedland,</HI> which
has not the least share of that
Politeness and Pleasantness it has
with us. You must set before
your Eyes a good fat overgrown
<HI>Cupid,</HI> who seldom wounds the
Heart of a Woman here in the nice
Part. This Material God, acts
his Part here, barely out of a
Principle of Ambition or Inte∣rest;
and, as they move but very
slow in Love, their Gallants ne∣ver
taste the true Relish of Love
with these Ladies of the <HI>North,</HI>
till they have put them to vast
Expences, and received confi∣derable
<PB N="292" REF="296"/>
Presents: 'Tis not till
then, that they will grant
them the least Favour, which
amounts to no more, than to
Eat with them some Fruits, such
as this Cold Climate affords, or
to Read a few Songs to them;
in which they take more Plea∣sure,
than we do in all the Ra∣vishments
of <HI>Love,</HI> a thing they
are scarce well acquainted with;
for here you may look for <HI>Love</HI> in
<HI>Love</HI> it self. Now, I leave it to
you, to consider, how nicely this
way of making Love hits my In∣clinations
and Genius; neverthe∣less,
I am forced to take up with
what I can get, because there is
no better to be had. Adieu, my
Dear, you are sensible that I
am”</P>
