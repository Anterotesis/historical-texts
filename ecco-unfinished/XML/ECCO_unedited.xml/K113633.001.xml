<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM happy in having your permission to inscribe
to you this complete edition of the truly poetical
works of your late ingenious friend OLIVER GOLD∣SMITH.
They will prove a lasting monument of
HIS GENIUS.</P>
<P>Every lover of science must deeply lament that
this excellent writer, after long struggling with ad∣versity,
finished his mortal career just as his reputa∣tion
was firmly established, and he had acquired
the friendship of SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS, DR.
JOHNSON, MR. EDMUND BURKE, the DEAN of
DERRY, MR. BEAUCLERC, and MR. CUMBER∣LAND,
names which ADORN our age and nation.</P>

“In which to latest times tie artist lives.”</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Had Dr. Goldsmith understood the art of paint∣ing,
of which he modestly declares himself ignorant,
his pen would have done justice to the merits of your
pencil—he chose a nobler theme, by declaring his
ardent affection for the <HI>virtues of your heart.</HI></P>
<P>That you may long continue, Sir, the ornament
of your country, and the delight of your friends,
is the sincere wish of,</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF THE
LIFE AND WRITINGS
OF
OLIVER GOLDSMITH, M. B.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Memoirs, which were published in Lon∣don, soon after the death of Dr. Goldsmith, were several mistakes, with respect to our author's age, the time of his admission into the college of Dub∣lin, &amp;c. which are here corrected from accurate in∣formation.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>“THE life of a scholar,” Dr. Gold∣smith
has remarked, “seldom abounds
with adventure; his fame is acquired in
<PB N="ii" REF="9"/>
solitude, and the historian who only
views him at a distance, must be con∣tent
with a dry detail of actions by
which he is scarce distinguished from
the rest of mankind: but we are
fond of talking of those who have given
us pleasure, not that we have any thing
important to say, but because the sub∣ject
is pleasing.”</P>
<P>Oliver Goldsmith, son of the reverend
Charles Goldsmith, was born at Elphin,
in he county of Roscommon in Ireland,
in the year 1729. His father had four
sons, of whom Oliver was the third.
After being well instructed in the classics,
at the school of Mr. Hughes, he was ad∣mitted
a sizer in Trinity-college, Dublin,
on the 11th of June, 1744. While he
resided there, he exhibited no specimens
of that genius, which, in his maturer
<PB N="iii" REF="10"/>
years, raised his character so high▪ On
the 27th of February, 1749, O. S. (two
years after the regular time) he obtained
the degree of Batchelor of Arts. Soon
after, he turned his thoughts to the pro∣fession
of physic; and, after attending
some courses of anatomy in Dublin, pro∣ceeded
to Edinburgh, in the year 1751,
where he studied the several branches of
medicine under the different professors in
that university. His beneficent disposi∣tion
soon involved him in unexpected dif∣ficulties;
and he was obliged precipitate∣ly
to leave Scotland, in consequence of
having engaged himself to pay a consi∣derable
sum of money for a fellow-stu∣dent.</P>
<P>A few days after, about the beginning
of the year 1754, he arrived at Sunder∣land,
near Newcastle, where he was ar∣arrested
<PB N="iv" REF="11"/>
at the suit of one Barclay, a taylor
in Edinburgh, to whom he had given se∣curity
for his friend. By the friendship
of Mr. Laughlin Maclane and Dr. Sleigh,
who were then in the college, he was soon
delivered out of the hands of the bailiff,
and took his passage on board a Dutch
ship to Rotterdam, where, after a short
stay, he proceeded to Brussels. He then
visited great part of Flanders; and, after
passing some time at Strasbourg and Lou∣vain,
where he obtained a degree of Batch∣elor
in physic, he accompanied an Eng∣lish
gentleman to Geneva.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly a fact, that this inge∣nious,
unfortunate man, made most part
of his tour on foot.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>“Countries wear different appearances to tra∣vellers of different circumstances. A man who is whirled through Europe in a post-chaise, and the pilgrim who walks the grand tour on foot, will form very different conclusions. <HI>Haud inexpertus loquor.”</HI></P>
<P>Goldsmith's <HI>Present State of Learning in Europe,</HI> 1758.</P></NOTE> He had left Eng∣land
<PB N="v" REF="12"/>
with very little money; and, being
of a philosophical turn, and at that time
possessing a body capable of sustaining
every fatigue, and a heart not easily ter∣rified
by danger, he became an enthusiast
to the design he had formed of seeing the
manners of different countries. He had
some knowledge of the French language,
and of music; he played tolerable well
on the German flute; which, from an
amusement, became at some times the
means of subsistence. His learning pro∣duced
him an hospitable reception at most
of the religious houses that he visited;
and his music made him welcome to
the peasants of Flanders and Germany.
<PB N="vi" REF="13"/>
“Whenever I approached a peasant's
house towards night-fall,” he used to
say, “I played one of my most merry
tunes, and that generally procured me
not only a lodging, but subsistence for
the next day: but, IN TRUTH” (his
constant expression) “I must own, when∣ever
I attempted to entertain persons of
a higher rank, they always thought my
performance odious, and never made
me any return for my endeavours to
please them.”</P>
<P>On his arrival at Geneva, he was re∣commended
as a proper person for a tra∣velling
tutor to a young man, who had
been unexpectedly left a considerable sum
of money by his uncle Mr. S******.
This youth, who was articled to an attor∣ney,
on receipt of his fortune determined
to see the world; and, on his engaging
<PB N="vii" REF="14"/>
with his preceptor, made a proviso, that
he should be permitted to govern him∣self:
and our traveller soon found his pu∣pil
understood the art of directing in mo∣ney
concerns extremely well, as avarice
was his prevailing passion.</P>
<P>During Goldsmith's continuance in
Switzerland, he assiduously cultivated his
poetical talent, of which he had given
some striking proofs at the college of
Edinburgh. It was from hence he sent
the first sketch of his delightful epistle,
called the TRAVELLER, to his brother
Henry, a clergyman in Ireland, who,
giving up fame and fortune, had retired
with an amiable wife to happiness and ob∣scurity,
on an income of only forty pounds
a year. The great affection Goldsmith
bore for this brother, is thus expressed in
<PB N="viii" REF="15"/>
the poem abovementioned, and gives a
striking picture of his situation.</P>
<L>Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow,</L>
<L>Or by the lazy Scheld, or wandering Po;</L>
<L>Or onward, where the rude Carinthian boor,</L>
<L>Against the houseless stranger shuts the door;</L>
<L>Or where Campania's plain forsaken lies,</L>
<L>A weary waste expanding to the skies;</L>
<L>Where'er I roam, whatever realms to see,</L>
<L>My heart untravel'd fondly turns to thee:</L>
<L>Still to my brother turns, with ceaseless pain,</L>
<L>And drags at each remove a length'ning chain:</L>
<L>Eternal bleffings crown my earliest friend,</L>
<L>And round his dwelling guardian saints attend;</L>
<L>Blest be that spot, where chearful guests retire,</L>
<L>To pause from toil, and trim their evening fire;</L>
<L>Blest that abode, where want and pain repair,</L>
<L>And every stranger finds a ready chair;</L>
<L>Blest be those feasts with simple plenty crown'd,</L>
<L>Where all the ruddy family around,</L>
<L>Laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail,</L>
<L>Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale;</L>
<L><PB N="ix" REF="16"/>
Or press the bashful stranger to his food,</L>
<L>And learn the luxury of doing good.</L>
<P>From Geneva Mr. Goldsmith and his
pupil proceeded to the south of France,
where the young man, upon some disa∣greement
with his preceptor, paid him the
small part of his salary which was due,
and embarked at Marseilles for England.
Our wanderer was left once more upon
the world at large, and passed through a
number, of difficulties in traversing the
greatest part of France. At length his
curiosity being gratified, he bent his course
towards England, and arrived at Dover,
the beginning of the winter, in the year
1758.</P>
<P>His finances were so low on his return▪
to England, that he with difficulty got to
the metropolis, his whole stock of cash
<PB N="x" REF="17"/>
amounting to no more than a few half-pence!
An entire stranger in London, his
mind was filled with the most gloomy re∣flections
in consequence of his embarrass∣ed
situation! He applied to several apo∣thecaries
in hopes of being received in
the capacity of a journeyman, but his
broad Irish accent, and the uncouthness
of his appearance, occasioned him to
meet with insult from most of the medi∣cinal
tribe. The next day, however, a
chymist near Fish-street, struck with his
forlorn condition, and the simplicity of
his manner, took him into his laboratory,
where he continued till he discovered that
his old friend Dr. Sleigh was in London.
That gentleman received him with the
warmest affection, and liberally invited
him to share his purse till some establish∣ment
could be procured for him. Gold∣smith,
<PB N="xi" REF="18"/>
unwilling to be a burden to his
friend, a short time after eagerly embraced
an offer which was made him to assist the
late Rev. Dr. Milner, in instructing the
young gentlemen at the academy at Peck∣ham;
and acquitted himself greatly to
the Doctor's satisfaction for a short time;
but, having obtained some reputation by
the criticisms he had written in the
Monthly Review, Mr. Griffith, the prin∣cipal
proprietor, engaged him in the com∣pilation
of it; and, resolving to pursue
the profession of writing, he returned to
London, as the mart where abilities of
every kind were sure of meeting distinc∣tion
and reward. Here he determined to
adopt a plan of the strictest oeconomy,
and, at the close of the year 1759, took
lodgings in Green-Arbour-court in the
Old Bailey, where he wrote several inge∣nious
pieces. The late Mr. Newbery,
<PB N="xii" REF="19"/>
who, at that time gave great encourage∣ment
to men of literary abilities, became
a kind of patron to our young author,
and introduced him as one of the writers
in the Public Ledger,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During this time, (according to another ac∣count) he wrote for the British Magazine, of which Dr. Smollet was then editor, most of those <HI>Essays</HI> and <HI>Tales,</HI> which he afterwards collected and pub∣lished in a separate volume. He also wrote occasi∣onally, for the Critical Review; and it was the me∣rit which he discotered in criticising a despicable translation of Orid's <HI>Fasti</HI> by a pedantic school∣master, and his <HI>Enquiry into the Present State of Learning in Europe,</HI> which first introduced him to the acquain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce of Dr. Smollet, who recommended him to several literati, and to most of the booksel∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by whom he was afterwards patronized.</NOTE> in which his <HI>Citi∣zen
of the World</HI> originally appeared, un∣der
the the title of “Chinese Letters.”</P>
<P>Fortune now seemed to take some no∣tice
of a man she had long neglected.
<PB N="xiii" REF="20"/>
The simplicity of his character, the integ∣rity
of his heart, and the merit of his
productions, made his company very ac∣ceptable
to a number of respectable per∣sons;
and, about the middle of the year
1762, he emerged from his mean apart∣ments
near the Old Bailey to the politer air
of the Temple, where he took handsome
chambers, and lived in a genteel style.
Among many other persons of distinction
who were desirous to know him, was the
Duke of Northumberland, and the cir∣cumstance
that attended his introduction
to that nobleman, is worthy of being re∣lated,
in order to shew a striking trait of
his character. “I was invited,” said the
Doctor, “by my friend Percy, to wait
upon the Duke, in consequence of the
satisfaction he had received from the
perusal of one of my productions. I
dressed myself in the best manner I
<PB N="xiv" REF="21"/>
could, and after studying some compli∣ments
I thought necessary on such an
occasion, proceeded on to Northum∣berland-house,
and acquainted the ser∣vants
that I had particular business with
his grace. They shewed me into an
antichamber, where, after waiting fome
time, a gentleman very elegantly dressed
made his appearance: taking him
for the Duke, I delivered all the fine
things I had composed, in order to com∣pliment
him on the honour he had done
me; when, to my great astonishment,
he told me I had mistaken him for his
master, who would see me immediately.
At that instant the Duke came into the
apartment, and I was so confounded on
the occasion, that I wanted words barely
sufficient to express the sense I entertain∣ed
of the Duke's politeness, and went
<PB N="xv" REF="22"/>
away exceedingly chagrined at the blun∣der
I had committed.”</P>
<P>The Doctor at the time of this visit was
much embarrassed in his circumstances,
but vain of the honour done him, was con∣tinually
mentioning it. One of those in∣genious
executors of the law, a bailiff, who
had a writ against him, determined to turn
this circumstance to his own advantage;
he wrote him a letter, that he was steward
to a nobleman who was charmed with,
reading his last production, and had or∣dered
him to desire the Doctor to appoint
a place where he might have the honour
of meeting him, to conduct him to his
Lordship. The vanity of poor Goldsmith
immediately swallowed the bait; he ap∣pointed
the British Coffee-house, to which
he was accompanied by his friend Mr.
Hamilton, the printer of the Critical Re∣view,
<PB N="xvi" REF="23"/>
who in vain remonstrated on the sin∣gularity
of the application. On entering
the coffee-room the bailiff paid his respects
to the Doctor, and desired that he might
have the honour of immediately attending
him. They had scarce entered Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l-mall,
in their way <HI>to his Lordship,</HI> when the bai∣liff
produced his writ. Mr. Hamilton
generously paid the money, and redeemed
the Doctor from captivity.</P>
<P>The publication of his <HI>Traveller,</HI> his
<HI>Vicar of Wakefield,</HI> and his <HI>History of Eng∣land,</HI>
was followed by the performance of
his comedy of <HI>The Good-natur'd Man</HI> at
Covent Garden theatre, and placed him
in the first rank of the poets of the pre∣sent
age.</P>
<P>Our Doctor, as he was now universally
called, had a constant levee of his distrest
<PB N="xvii" REF="24"/>
countrymen, whose wants, as far as he
was able, he always relieved; and he has
often been known to leave himself even
without a guinea, in order to supply the
necessities of others.</P>
<P>Another feature in his character we
cannot help laying before the reader.
Previous to the publication of his <HI>Desert∣ed
Village,</HI> the bookseller had given him
a note for one hundred guineas for the
copy, which the Doctor mentioned, a few
hours after, to one of his friends, who
observed it was a very great sum for so
short a performance, “In truth,” replied
Goldsmith, “I think so too; it is much
more than the honest man can afford,
or the piece is worth; I have not been
easy since I received it; I will therefore
go back and return him his note:”
which he actually did, and left it entirely
<PB N="xviii" REF="25"/>
to the bookseller to pay him according
to the profits produced by the sale of
the poem, which turned out very consi∣derable.</P>
<P>The author addresses this poem to his
friend Sir Joshua Reynolds. He writes
in the character of a native of a country
village, to which he gives the name of
Auburn, and which he pathetically ad∣dresses.
He then proceeds to contrast the
innocence and happiness of a simple and
a natural state with the miseries and vices
that have been introduced by polished
life, and gives the following beautiful
apostrophe to retirement.</P>
<L>“O blest retirement, friend to life's decline,</L>
<L>Retreats from care that never must be mine;</L>
<L>How blest is he who crowns, in shades like these,</L>
<L>A youth of labour with an age of ease;</L>
<L><PB N="xix" REF="26"/>
Who quits a world where strong temptations try,</L>
<L>And since 'tis hard to combat learns to fly.</L>
<L>For him no wretches, born to work and weep,</L>
<L>Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;</L>
<L>No surly porter stands in guilty state,</L>
<L>To spurn imploring famine from his gate;</L>
<L>But on he moves to meet his latter end,</L>
<L>Angels around befriending virtue's friend;</L>
<L>Sinks to the grave with unperceiv'd decay,</L>
<L>While resignation gently slopes the way;</L>
<L>And all his prospects brightning to the last,</L>
<L>His heaven commences ere the world be past!”</L>
<P>The description of the parish priest
(probably intended for a character of his
brother Henry) would have done honour
to any poet of any age. In this descrip∣tion
the simile of the bird teaching her
young to fly, and of the mountain that
rises above the storm, are not easily to be
paralleled. The rest of the poem consists
of the character of the village school∣master,
<PB N="xx" REF="27"/>
and a description of the village
alehouse, both drawn with admirable pro∣priety
and force; a descant on the mis∣chiefs
of luxury and wealth; the variety
of artificial pleasures; the miseries of
those who for want of employment at
home, are driven to settle new colonies
abroad, and concludes with the following
beautiful apostrophe to poetry.</P>
<L>“And thou sweet poetry, thou loveliest maid,</L>
<L>Still first to fly where sensual joys invade;</L>
<L>Unfit in these degenerate times of shame,</L>
<L>To catch the heart, or strike for honest fame;</L>
<L>Dear charming nymph, neglected and decried,</L>
<L>My shame in crowds my solitary pride;</L>
<L>Thou source of all my bliss, and all my woe,</L>
<L>That found me poor at first, and keep'st me so;</L>
<L>Thou guide by which the nobler arts excel,</L>
<L>Thou nurse of every virtue, fare thee well.”</L>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="28"/>
The Doctor did not reap a profit from
his poetical labours equal to those of his
prose. The Earl of Lisburne, whose
classical taste is well known, one day at
a dinner of the Royal Academicians, la∣mented
to the Doctor his neglecting the
muses, and enquired of him why he for∣sook
poetry, in which he was sure of
charming his readers, to compile histo∣ries,
and write novels? The Doctor replied,
“My Lord, by courting the muses I shall
starve, but by my other labours, I eat,
drink, have good cloaths, and enjoy
the luxuries of life.”</P>
<P>During the last Rehearsal of his come∣dy,
intitled, <HI>She Stoops to Conquer,</HI> which
Mr. Colman thought would not succeed,
on the Doctor's objecting to the repeti∣tion
of one of Tony Lumpkin's speeches,
being apprehensive it might injure the
play, the manager, with great keenness
<PB N="xxii" REF="29"/>
replied, “Psha, my dear Doctor, do not
be fearful of <HI>squibs,</HI> when we have been
sitting almost these two hours upon a
<HI>barrel of gunpowder.”</HI> The piece, how∣ever,
contrary to Mr. Colman's expecta∣tion,
was received with uncommon ap∣plause
by the audience; and Goldsmith's
pride was. so hurt by the severity of the
above observation, that it entirely put an
end to his friendship for the gentleman
who made it.</P>
<P>The success of the comedy of <HI>She Stoops
to Conquer</HI> produced a most illiberal perso∣nal
attack on the author in one of the
public prints<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<HEAD>To DR. GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Vous vous noyez par vanitè.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE happy knack which you have learnt of puffing your own compofitions, provokes me to come forth. You have not been the editor of news-papers and magazines, not to discover the trick of literary <HI>humbug.</HI> But the gauze is so thin, that the very foolish part of the world see through it, and disco∣ver the Doctor's monkey face and cloven foot. Your poetic vanity, is as unpardonable as your personal; would man believe it, and will woman bear it, to be told, that for hours the great Goldsmith will stand surveying his grotesque Oranthotan's figure in a pier glass? Was but the lovely H—k as much enamoured, you would not sigh, my gentle swain, in vain. But your vanity is preposterous. How will this same bard of Bedlam ring the changes in praise of Goldy! But what has he to be either proud or vain of? The <HI>Traveller</HI> is a flimsy poem, built upon false principles; principles diametrically oppo∣site to liberty. What is the <HI>Good-natur'd Man,</HI> but a poor, water-gruel, dramatic dose? What is the <HI>Deserted Village,</HI> but a <HI>pretty</HI> poem, of easy num∣bers, without fancy, dignity, genius, or fire? And pray what may be the last <HI>speaking pantomime,</HI> so praised by the Doctor himself, but an incoherent piece of stuff, the figure of a woman, with a fish's tail, without plot, incident, or intrigue? We are made to laugh at stale, dull jokes, wherein we mis∣take pleasantly for wit, and grimace for humour; wherein every scene is unnatural, and inconsistent with the rules, the laws of nature and of drama, viz. Two gentlemen come to a man of fortune's house, eat, drink, sleep, &amp;c. and take it for an inn. The one is intended as a lover to the daughter; he talks with her for some hours, and when he sees her again in a different dress, he treats her as a bar girl, and swears me squinted. He abuses the master of the house, and threatens to kick him out of his own doors. The squire, whom we are told is to be a fool, proves to be the most sensible being of the piece; and he makes out a whole act, by bidding his mother lie close behind a bush, persuading her, that his father, her own husband, is a highwayman, and that he is come to cut their throats; and to give his cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in an opportunity to go off, he drives his mother over hedges, ditches, and through ponds. Three is not, sweet sucking Johnson, a natural stroke in the whole play, but the young fellow's giving the stolen jewels to the mother, supposing her to be the landlady. That Mr. Colman did no justice to this piece, I honestly allow; that he told all his friends it would be damned, I positively aver; and from such ungenerous insinuations, with∣out a dramatic merit, it rose to public notice: and it is now the <HI>ton</HI> to go to see it; though I never saw a person that either liked it or approved it, any more than the absurd plot <HI>of the Home's</HI> tragedy of <HI>Alonzo.</HI> Mr. Goldsmith, correct your arrogance! reduce your vanity; and endeavour to believe, as a man, you are of the plainest sort; and as an author, but a mortal piece of mediocrity.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>“ To the PUBLIC.”</HEAD>
<P>LEST it should be supposed that I
have been willing to correct in others
an abuse of which I have been guilty
myself, I beg leave to declare, that in
all my life I never wrote, or dictated,
a single paragraph, letter, or essay, in
a news-paper, except a few moral essays,
<PB N="xxviii" REF="35"/>
under the character of a Chinese, about
ten years ago, in the Ledger; and a
letter, to which I signed my name, in
the St. James's Chronicle. If the li∣berty
of the press therefore has been
abused, I have had no hand in it.”</P>
<P>“I have always considered the press as
the protector of our freedom, as a watch∣ful
guardian, capable of uniting the
weak against the encroachments of
power. What concerns the public
most properly admits of a public dis∣cussion.
But of late, the press has
turned from defending public interest,
to making inroads upon private life:
from combating the strong, to over∣whelming
the feeble. No condition is
now too obscure for its abuse, and the
protector is become the tyrant of the
people. In this manner the freedom
<PB N="xxix" REF="36"/>
of the press is beginning to sow the
seeds of its own dissolution; the great
must oppose it from principle, and the
weak from fear; till at last every rank
of mankind s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all be found to give up
its benefits, content with security from
its insults.”</P>
<P>“How to put a stop to this licenti∣ousness,
by which all are indiscrimi∣nately
abused, and by which vice con∣sequently
escapes in the general censure,
I am unable to tell; all I could wish
is, that, as the law gives us no protec∣tion
against the injury, so it should
give calumniators no shelter after
having provoked correction. The in∣sults
which we receive before the pub∣lic,
by being more open are the more
distressing; by treating them with silent
contempt, we do not pay a sufficient
<PB N="xxx" REF="37"/>
deference to the opinion of the world.
By recurring to legal redress, we too
often expose the weakness of the law,
which only serves to increase our mor∣tification
by failing to relieve us. In
short, every man should singly consider
himself as a guardian of the liberty of
the press, and as far as his influence
can extend, should endeavour to pre∣vent
it's licentiousness becoming at last
the grave of it's freedom.”</P>

<P>Notwithstanding the great success of
his pieces, by some of which, it is assert∣ed,
upon good authority, that he cleared
1800 l. in one year, his circumstances
were by no means in a prosperous situa∣tion!
partly owing to the liberality of his
disposition, and partly to an unfortunate
<PB N="xxxi" REF="38"/>
habit he had contracted of gaming, with
the arts of which he was very little ac∣quainted,
and consequently became the
prey of those who were unprincipled
enough to take advantage of his igno∣rance.</P>
<P>Just before his death he had formed a
design for executing an universal dictio∣nary
of arts and sciences, the <HI>prospectus</HI>
of which he actually printed and distri∣buted
among his acquaintance. In this
work several of his literary friends (par∣ticularly
Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr. John∣son,
and Mr. Garrick) had promised to
assist, and to furnish him with articles
upon different subjects. He had enter∣tained
the most sanguine expectations
from the success of it. The undertaking,
however, did not meet with that encourage∣ment
from the booksellers which he had
<PB N="xxxii" REF="39"/>
imagined it would undoubtedly receive;
and he used to lament this circumstance
almost to the last hour of his existence.</P>
<P>He had been for some years afflicted,
at different times, with a violent stran∣gury,
which contributed not a little to
imbitter the latter part of his life; and
which, united with the vexations he suf∣fered
upon other occasions, brought on a
kind of habitual despondency. In this
unhappy condition he was attacked by a
nervous fever.</P>
<P>On Friday the twenty-fifth of March,
1774, finding himself extremely ill, he sent
at eleven o'clock at night for Mr. Hawes,
an apothecary, to whom he complained
of a violent pain extending all over the
fore part of his head, his tongue was
moist, he had no cold shivering, and his
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="40"/>
pulse beat about ninety strokes in a mi∣nute.
He acquainted him he had taken
two ounces of Ipecacuanha wine as a
vomit, and that it was his intention to
take Dr. James's fever powders, which
he desired him to send him. Mr. Hawes
replied, that in his opinion this medi∣cine
was very improper at <HI>that</HI> time, and
begged he would not think of it; but
every argument used seemed only to ren∣der
him more determined in his own opi∣nion.</P>
<P>Mr. Hawes knowing that in preceding
illnesses Dr. Goldsmith always consulted
Dr. Fordyce, and that he had exprest the
greatest opinion of his abilities as a phy∣sician,
requested he might be permitted to
send for him. It was full a quarter of an
hour before Mr. Hawes could obtain his
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="41"/>
consent, as the taking Dr. James's pow∣ders
appeared to be the only object which
employed his attention; and even then
he endeavoured to throw an obstacle in
his way, by saying, that Dr. Fordyce was
gone to spend the evening in Gerrard∣street,
“where,” added he, “I should
also have been, if I had not been indis∣posed.”
Mr. Hawes immediately dis∣patched
a messenger who found Dr. For∣dyce
at home, and who waited on Dr.
Goldsmith directly.</P>
<P>Dr. Fordyce represented to him the
impropriety of taking the powders in his
<HI>present</HI> situation; but he was deaf to all
remonstrances, and unhappily persisted in
his own resolution.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxv" REF="42"/>
On Saturday morning, March 26, Mr.
Hawes visited his patient, he found him
extremely reduced, and hiis pulse was
now become very quick and small. When
he enquired of him how he did, Dr.
Goldsmith sighed deeply, and in a very
low voice said, “He wished he had taken
his friendly advice last night.”</P>
<P>Dr. Fordyce perceiving the danger of
Dr. Goldsmith's situation, desired Mr.
Hawes to propose sending for Dr. Turton,
of whom he knew Dr. Goldsmith had a
great opinion: the proposal being men∣tioned
to Dr. Goldsmith, he very readily
consented, and ordered his servant to go
directly. The doctors Fordyce and Tur∣ton
met at the time appointed to assist at
a consultation, which was continued twice
a day, till the disorder terminated in his
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="43"/>
dissolution, on the fourth day of April,

His friends, who were very numerous

<P>This Monument is raised
To the Memory of
OLIVER GOLDSMITH,
Poet, Natural Philosopher and
Historian,
Who left no species of writing untouched,
or,
Unadorned by His pen,
Whether to move laughter,
Or draw tears:
He was a powerful master
Over the affections,
Though at the same time a gentle tyrant;
Of a genius at once sublime, lively, and
Equal to every subject:
In expression at once noble,
Pure and delicate.</P>
<P>His Memory will last
As long as society retains affection;
<PB N="xli" REF="48"/>
Friendship is not void of Honor,
And Reading wants not her admirers.</P>
<P>He was born in the kingdom of Ireland,
At Fernes, in the province
Of Leinster,
Where Pallas had set her name,
29th Nov. 1731.</P>
<P>He was educated at Dublin,
And died in London,
4th April, 1774.</P></Q>
<P>As to his character, it is strongly illus∣trated
by Mr. Pope's line,
<Q>“In wit a man, simplicity a child.”</Q></P>
<P>The learned leisure he loved to enjoy
was too often interrupted by distresses
which arose from the openness of his tem∣per,
and which sometimes threw him
into loud fits of passion; but this impe∣tuosity
<PB N="xlii" REF="49"/>
was corrected upon a moment's
reflection, and his servants have been
known upon these occasions, purposely to
throw themselves in his way, that they
might profit by it immediately after; for
he who had the good fortune to be re∣proved
was certain of being rewarded for
it. His disappointments at other times,
made him peevish and sullen, and he has
often left a party of convivial friends
abruptly in the evening, in order to go
home and brood over his misfortunes.</P>
<P>The universal esteem in which his po∣ems
are held, and the repeated pleasure
they give in the perusal, are striking proofs
of their merit. He was a studious and
correct observer of nature, happy in the
selection of his images, in the choice of
his subjects, and in the harmony of his
versification; and, though his embarrass∣ed
<PB N="xliii" REF="50"/>
situation prevented him from putting
the last hand to many of his productions,
his <HI>Hermit,</HI> his <HI>Traveller,</HI> and his <HI>Deserted
Village,</HI> bid fair to claim a place among
the most finished pieces in the English
language.</P>
<P>The excellent poem of <HI>Retaliation</HI> was
only intended for the Doctor's private
amusement, and that of the particular
friends who were its subject, and he un∣fortunately
did not live to revise, or even
finish it in the manner which he intended.
The poem owed its birth to some preced∣ing
circumstances of festive merriment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>

at a literary club, to which the doctor
belonged, and who proposed to write epi∣taphs
on him. He was called on for Re∣taliation,
<PB N="xlv" REF="52"/>
and at their next meeting pro∣produced
the poem.</P>
<P>The last work of this ingenious author,
was “An History of the Earth and Ani∣mated
Nature,” in 8 vols. 8vo. for which
production his bookseller paid him 850 l.
<PB N="xlvi" REF="53"/>
The Doctor seems to have considered at∣tentively
the works of the several authors
who have wrote on this subject. If there
should not be a great deal of discovery,
or new matter, yet a judicious selection
from abundant materials, is no small
praise, and if the experiments and disco∣veries
of other writers are laid open in an
agreeable dress, so pleasing as to allure
the young reader into a pursuit of this
sort of knowledge, we have no small ob∣ligations
to this very engaging writer.</P>
<P>Our author professes to have had a taste
rather classical than scientific, and it was
in the study of the classics, that he first
caught the desire of attaining a knowledge
of nature. Pliny first inspired him, and
he resolved to translate that agreeable
writer, and by the help of a commentary
<PB N="xlvii" REF="54"/>
to make his translation acceptable to the
public.</P>
<P>It is not to be questioned that Dr.
Goldsmith, had he followed that plan,
would have marked out those inaccura∣cies
and extravagancies, into which an
easy credulity, or a want of attention, or
the little progress of science in the world,
in his age, had seduced his original au∣thor,
and are the blemishes of that inge∣nious,
inquisitive, and laborious writer.</P>
<P>The appearance of Mr. Buffon's work,
however, induced the Doctor to change
his plan, and instead of translating an
ancient writer, he resolved to imitate the
last and best of the modern, who had
written on natural history.</P>
<P><PB N="xlviii" REF="55"/>
The Doctor acknowledges to have the
highest obligations to Buffon, as far as
Buffon's work extend, and he could not,
we imagine, have chosen to himself a
better guide. The Doctor seems to pro∣fess
that from his first intention of a trans∣lation,
to his execution of this work, his
great object was to send out an agreeable
work, and, without flattery, this we think
he has effected.</P>
<P>We will not presume to decide whether
the adept will find himself enlightened,
or his information extended, but undoubt∣edly
the common reader will find his cu∣riosity
gratified, and that time agreeably
disposed of, which he bestows on this
work, and this seems to have been the
object of the writer; and an author who
has effected what he has proposed, is un∣doubtedly
intitled to all the praise that
<PB N="xlix" REF="56"/>
the nature of the work he has undertaken
can pretend to.</P>
<P>Every reader of taste has long regretted
that the poetical writings of this author
have hitherto been only published in a de∣sultory
manner, the collecting them toge∣ther
in a compleat and elegant edition, it
is hoped will be considered as a proper
tribute to the memory of this truly excel∣lent
poet.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writer of these memoirs is indebted for the principal anecdotes contained in them, to a gentleman who well knows their authenticity, and who long lived with Dr. Goldsmith upon the most friendly terms, and never felt any sorrow more sincerely than that which was occasioned by his death.</NOTE></P>

<L>DARK as the night, which now in dunnest robe,</L>
<L>Ascends her zenith, o'er the silent globe;</L>
<L>Sad melancholy wakes, awhile to tread,</L>
<L>With solemn step, the mansions of the dead:</L>

<L>The tributary wreath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of laureat bloom,</L>
<L>With artless hands, to deck a poet's tomb;</L>
<L>The tomb where Goldsmith sleeps. Fond hopes,

<L>No more your airy dreams shall mock my view:</L>
<L>Here will I learn ambition to controul,</L>
<L>And each aspiring passion of the soul:</L>
<L><PB N="lviii" REF="65"/>
E'en now, methinks, his well-known voice I hear,</L>
<L>When late he meditated flight from care,</L>
<L>When as imagination fondly hied</L>
<L>To scenes of sweet retirement, thus he cried.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“Ye splendid fabricks, palaces and towers,</L>
<L>Where dissipation leads the giddy hours,</L>
<L>Where pomp, disease, and knavery reside,</L>
<L>And folly bends the knee to wealthy pride;</L>
<L>Where luxury's purveyors learn to rise,</L>
<L>And worth, to want a prey, unfriended dies;</L>
<L>Where warbling Eunuchs glitter in brocade,</L>
<L>And hapless Poets toil for scanty bread:</L>
<L>Farewel! to other scenes I turn my eyes,</L>
<L>Embosom'd in the vale where Auburn lies,</L>
<L>Deserted Auburn, those now ruin'd glades,</L>
<L>Forlorn, yet ever dear and honour'd shades.</L>
<L>There though the Hamlet boasts no smiling train,</L>
<L>Nor spor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful pastime circling on the plain;</L>
<L>No needy villains proul around for prey,</L>
<L>No slanderers, no sycophants betray;</L>
<L>No gaudy foplings scornfully deride</L>
<L>The swain, whose humble pipe is all his pride.</L>
<L>There will I fly to seek that soft repose,</L>
<L>Which solitude contemplative bestows:</L>
<L><PB N="lix" REF="66"/>
Yet, oh fond hope! perchance there still remains</L>
<L>One lingering friend behind, to bless the plains;</L>
<L>Some hermit of the dale, inshrined in ease,</L>
<L>Long lost companion of my youthful days;</L>
<L>With whose sweet converse in his social bower,</L>
<L>I oft may chide away some vacant hour;</L>
<L>To whose pure sympathy, I may impart</L>
<L>Each latent grief, that labours at my heart,</L>
<L>Whate'er I felt, and what I saw, relate,</L>
<L>The sholes of luxury, the wrecks of state;</L>
<L>Those busy scenes, where science wakes in vain,</L>
<L>In which I shar'd, ah! ne'er to share again.</L>
<L>But whence that pang? does nature now rebel?</L>
<L>Why faulters out my tongue the word <HI>farewel?</HI></L>
<L>Ye friends! who long have witness'd to my toil,</L>
<L>And seen me ploughing in a thankless soil,</L>
<L>Whose partial tenderness hush'd every pain,</L>
<L>Whose approbation made my bosom vain:</L>
<L>'Tis you, to whom my soul divided hies</L>
<L>With fond regret, and half unwilling flies;</L>
<L>Sighs forth her parting wishes to the wind,</L>
<L>And lingering leaves her better half behind.</L>
<L>Can I forget the intercourse I shar'd,</L>
<L>What friendship cherish'd, and what zeal endear'd?</L>
<L><PB N="lx" REF="67"/>
Alas! remembrance still must turn to you,</L>
<L>And to my latest hour, protract the long <HI>adieu.</HI></L>
<L>Amid the woodlands, wheresoe'er I rove,</L>
<L>The plain, or secret covert of the grove,</L>
<L>Imagination shall supply her store</L>
<L>Of painful bliss, and what she can restore;</L>
<L>Shall strew each lonely path with flowrets gay,</L>
<L>And wide as is her boundless empire stray.</L>
<L>On eagle pinions traverse earth, and skies,</L>
<L>And bid the lost and distant objects rise.</L>
<L>Here, where encircled o'er the sloping land</L>

<L>And bow with reverence to wisdom's voice.</L>
<L>There, spreading oaks shall arch the vaulted dome,</L>
<L>The Champion, there, of liberty, and Rome,</L>
<L>In attick eloquence shall thunder laws,</L>
<L>And uncorrupted senates shout applause.</L>
<L>Not more extatic visions rapt the soul</L>
<L>Of Numa, when to midnight grots he stole,—</L>
<L>And learnt his lore, from virtue's mouth refin'd,</L>

<L>Or, as he traverses a dreary scene,</L>
<L>Bids every sweet of nature there convene,</L>
<L>Huge mountains skirted round with wavy woods,</L>
<L>The shrub-deckt lawns, and silver sprinkled floods,</L>
<L>Whilst flowrets spring around the smiling land,</L>

<PB N="lxii" REF="69"/>
<L>Such prospects, lovely Auburn! then, be thine;</L>

<L>Thus, spoke the Bard: but not one friendly power,</L>

<L>No eastern meteor glar'd beneath the sky,</L>

<L>Here paus'd the fell destroyer to survey</L>
<L>The pride, the boast of man, his destin'd prey,</L>

<L>To heap the graven pile, or laurel'd bust;</L>
<L>Since by thy hands already rais'd on high,</L>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A TALE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SECLUDED from domestic strife,</L>
<L>Jack Book-worm led a college life;</L>
<L>A fellowship at twenty-five,</L>
<L>Made him the happiest man alive;</L>
<L>He drank his glass, and crack'd his joke,</L>
<L>And freshmen wonder'd as he spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such pleasures, unallay'd with care,</L>
<L>Could any accident impair?</L>
<L>Could Cupid's shaft at length transfix</L>
<L>Our swain arriv'd at thirty-six?</L>

<L>O!—But let exclamation cease,</L>
<L>Her presence banish'd all his peace.</L>
<L>So with decorum all things carry'd;</L>
<L>Miss frown'd, and blush'd, and then was—married.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Need we expose to vulgar sight</L>
<L>The raptures of the bridal night?</L>
<L>Need we intrude on hallow'd ground,</L>
<L>Or draw the curtains clos'd around?</L>
<L>Let it suffice, that each had charms;</L>
<L>He clasp'd a goddess in his arms;</L>
<L>And, though she felt his usage rough,</L>
<L>Yet in a man 'twas well enough.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The honey-moon like light'ning flew,</L>
<L>The second brought its transports too.</L>
<L>A third, a fourth, were not amiss,</L>
<L>The fifth was friendship mix'd with bliss:</L>
<L>But, when a twelvemonth pass'd away,</L>
<L>Jack found his goddess made of clay;</L>
<L>Found half the charms that deck'd her face</L>
<L>Arose from powder, shreds, or lace;</L>
<L>But still the worst remain'd behind,</L>
<L>That very face had robb'd her mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Skill'd in no other arts was she,</L>
<L>But dressing, patching, repartee;</L>
<L>And, just as humour rose or fell,</L>
<L>By turns a slattern or a belle;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="77"/>
'Tis true she dress'd with modern grace,</L>
<L>Half naked at a ball or race;</L>
<L>But when at home, at board or bed,</L>
<L>Five greasy night-caps wrap'd her head.</L>
<L>Could so much beauty condescend</L>
<L>To be a dull domestic friend?</L>
<L>Could any curtain lectures bring</L>
<L>To decency so fine a thing?</L>
<L>In short, by night, 'twas fits or fretting;</L>
<L>By day, 'twas gadding or coquetting.</L>
<L>Fond to be seen, she kept a bevy</L>
<L>Of powder'd coxcombs at her levy;</L>
<L>The 'squire and captain took their stations,</L>
<L>And twenty other near relations;</L>
<L>Jack suck'd his pipe, and often broke</L>
<L>A sigh in suffocating smoke;</L>
<L>While all their hours were pass'd between</L>
<L>Insulting repartee or spleen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus as her faults each day were known,</L>

<L>LONG had I sought in vain to find</L>

<L>Design'd, no doubt, their part to bear,</L>
<L>And waft his godship through the air;</L>

<L>Denote the rage with which he writes,</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As there is nothing I dislike so much as news∣paper
controversy, particularly upon trifles, permit
me to be as concise as possible in informing a cor∣respondent
of yours, that I recommended Blain∣ville's
Travels, because I thought the book was a
good one; and I think so still. I said, I was told
by the bookseller that it was then first published;
but in that, it seems, I was mis-informed, and my
reading was not extensive enough to set me right.</P>
<P>Another correspondent of yours accuses me of
having taken a ballad, I published some ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ago,
<PB N="18" REF="87"/>
from one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Friar of Orders Gray. “Reliq. of Anc. Poetry,” vol. 1. p. 243.</NOTE> by the ingenious Mr. Percy. I do not
think there is any great resemblance between the
two pieces in question. If there be any, his ballad
is taken from mine. I read it to Mr. Percy, some
years ago; and he (as we both considered these
things as trifles at best) told me with his usual good
humour, the next time I saw him, that he had taken
my plan to form the fragments of Shakespeare into
a ballad of his own. He then read me his little
Cento, if I may so call it, and I highly approved
it. Such petty anecdotes as these are scarce worth
printing: and, were it not for the busy disposition
of some of your correspondents, the public should
never have known that he owes me the hint of his
ballad, or that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m obliged to his friendship and
learning for communications of a much more impor∣tant

<P>A
POEM.</P>
<P>FIRST PRINTED IN MDCCLXV.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="31" REF="99"/>
<HEAD>TO THE
REV. HENRY GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sensible that the friendship between us can
acquire no new force from the ceremonies of a De∣dication;
and perhaps it demands an excuse thus to
prefix your name to my attempts, which you decline
giving with your own. But as a part of this Poem
was formerly written to you from Switzerland, the
whole can now, with propriety, be only inscribed
to you. It will also throw a light upon many parts
of it, when the reader understands, that it is ad∣dressed
to a man, who, despising Fame and Fortune,
has retired early to Happiness and Obscurity, with
an income of forty pounds a year.</P>
<P>I now perceive, my dear brother, the wisdom of
your humble choice. You have entered upon a sa∣cred
office, where the harvest is great, and the la∣bourers
are but few; while you have left the field
of Ambition, Where the labourers are many, and
<PB N="32" REF="100"/>
the harvest not worth carrying away. But of all
kinds of ambition, what from the refinement of the
times, from different systems of criticism, and from
the divisions of party, that which pursues poetical
fame is the wildest.</P>
<P>Poetry makes a principal amusement among un∣polished
nations; but in a country verging to the
extremes of refinement, Painting and Music come
in for a share. As these offer the feeble mind a less
laborious entertainment, they at first rival Poetry,
and at length supplant her; they engross all that
favour once shewn to her, and, though but younger
sisters, seize upon the elder's birthright.</P>
<P>Yet, however this art may be neglected by the
powerful, it is still in greater danger from the mis∣taken
efforts of the learned to improve it. What
criticisms have we not heard of late in favour of
blank verse, and Pindaric odes, chorusses, anapests
and iambics, alliterative care and happy negligence!
Every absurdity has now a champion to defend it;
and as he is generally much in the wrong, so
he has always much to say; for error is ever talk∣ative.</P>
<P>But there is an enemy to this art still more dan∣gerous,
I mean Party. Party entirely distorts the
judgment, and destroys the taste. When the mind
is once infected with this disease, it can only find
<PB N="33" REF="101"/>
pleasure in what contributes to increase the distem∣per.
Like the tyger, that seldom desists from pur∣suing
man, after having once preyed upon human
flesh, the reader, who has once gratified his appetite
with calumny, makes, ever after, the most agree∣able
feast upon murdered reputation. Such readers
generally admire some half-witted thing, who wants
to be thought a bold man, having lost the character
of a wise one. Him they dignify with the name of
poet: his tawdry lampoons are called satires; his
turbulence is said to be force, and his phrenzy fire.</P>
<P>What reception a Poem may find, which has nei∣ther
abuse, party, nor blank verse to support it, I
cannot tell, nor am I solicitous to know. My aims
are right. Without espousing the cause of any party,
I have attempted to moderate the rage of all. I
have endeavoured to shew, that there may be equal
happiness in states, that are differently governed
from our own; that every state has a particular prin∣ciple
of happiness, and that this principle in each
may be carried to a mischievous excess. There are
few can judge, better than yourself, how far these
positions are illustrated in this Poem. I am,</P>

<L>My prime of life in wandering spent and care:</L>
<L>Impell'd, with steps unceasing, to pursue</L>
<L>Some fleeting good, that mocks me with the view;</L>
<L>That, like the circle bounding earth and skies,</L>
<L>Allures from far, yet, as I follow, flies;</L>
<L>My fortune leads to traverse realms alone,</L>
<L>And find no spot of all the world my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ev'n now, where Alpine solitudes ascend,</L>
<L>I sit me down a pensive hour to spend;</L>
<L>And, plac'd on high above the storm's career,</L>
<L>Look downward where an hundred realms appear;</L>
<L>Lakes, forests, cities, plains extending wide,</L>
<L>The pomp of kings, the shepherd's humbler pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="37" REF="104"/>
<L>When thus Creation's charms around combine,</L>
<L>Amidst the store, should thankless pride repine?</L>
<L>Say, should the philosophic mind disdain</L>
<L>That good which makes each humbler bosom vain?</L>
<L>Let school-taught pride dissemble all it can,</L>
<L>These little things are great to little man;</L>
<L>And wiser he, whose sympathetic mind</L>
<L>Exults in all the good of all mankind.</L>
<L>Ye glittering towns, with wealth and splendor crown'd;</L>
<L>Ye fields, where summer spreads profusion round;</L>
<L>Ye lakes, whose vessels catch the busy gale;</L>
<L>Ye bending swains, that dress the flowery vale;</L>
<L>For me your tributary stores combine:</L>
<L>Creation's heir, the world, the world is mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As some lone miser, visiting his store,</L>
<L>Bends at his treasure, counts, recounts it o'er;</L>
<L>Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill,</L>
<L>Yet still he sighs, for hoards are wanting still:</L>
<L>Thus to my breast alternate passions rise,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with each good that heaven to man supplies;</L>
<L>Yet oft a sigh prevails, and sorrows fall,</L>
<L>To see the hoard of human bliss so small;</L>
<L>And oft I wish, amidst the scene, to find</L>
<L>Some spot to real happiness consign'd,</L>
<L>Where my worn soul, each wandering hope at rest,</L>
<L>May gather bliss to see my fellows blest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But where to find that happiest spot below,</L>
<L>Who can direct, when all pretend to know?</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="105"/>
The shudd'ring tenant of the frigid zone</L>
<L>Boldly proclaims that happiest spot his own;</L>
<L>Extols the treasures of his stormy seas,</L>
<L>And his long nights of revelry and ease;</L>
<L>The naked negro, panting at the line,</L>
<L>Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine,</L>
<L>Basks in the glare, or stems the tepid wave,</L>
<L>And thanks his gods for all the good they gave.</L>
<L>Such is the patriot's boast, where'er we roam,</L>
<L>His first, best country, ever is at home.</L>
<L>And yet, perhaps, if countries we compare,</L>
<L>And estimate the blessings which they share,</L>
<L>Though patriots flatter, still shall wisdom find</L>
<L>An equal portion dealt to all mankind;</L>
<L>As different good, by art or nature given,</L>
<L>To different nations makes their blessings even.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nature, a mother kind alike to all,</L>
<L>Still grants her bliss at labour's earnest call;</L>
<L>With food as well the peasant is supply'd</L>
<L>On Idra's cliffs as Arno's shelvy side;</L>
<L>And though the rocky crested summits frown,</L>
<L>These rocks, by custom, turn to beds of down.</L>
<L>From art more various are the blessings sent;</L>
<L>Wealth, commerce, honour, liberty, content.</L>
<L>Yet these each other's power so strong contest,</L>
<L>That either seems destructive of the rest.</L>
<L>Where wealth and freedom reign, contentment fails;</L>
<L>And honour sinks where commerce long prevails.</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="106"/>
Hence every state to one lov'd blessing prone,</L>
<L>Conforms and models life to that alone.</L>
<L>Each to the fav'rite happiness attends,</L>
<L>And spurns the plan that aims at other ends;</L>
<L>'Till carried to excess in each domain,</L>
<L>This fav'rite good begets peculiar pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let us try these truths with closer eyes,</L>
<L>And trace them through the prospect as it lies:</L>
<L>Here for a while my proper cares resign'd,</L>
<L>Here let me sit in sorrow for mankind;</L>
<L>Like yon neglected shrub at random cast,</L>
<L>That shades the steep, and sighs at every blast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far to the right where Appennine ascends,</L>
<L>Bright as the summer, Italy extends;</L>
<L>Its uplands sloping deck the mountain's side,</L>
<L>Woods over woods in gay theatric pride;</L>
<L>While oft some temple's mould'ring tops between</L>
<L>With venerable grandeur mark the scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Could Nature's bounty satisfy the breast,</L>
<L>The sons of Italy were surely blest.</L>
<L>Whatever fruits in different climes were found,</L>
<L>That proudly rise, or humbly court the ground;</L>
<L>Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear,</L>
<L>Whose bright succession decks the varied year;</L>
<L>Whatever sweets salute the northern sky</L>
<L>With vernal lives, that blossom but to die;</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="107"/>
These here disporting own the kindred soil,</L>
<L>Nor ask luxuriance from the planter's toil;</L>
<L>While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand</L>
<L>To winnow fragrance round the smiling land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But small the bliss that sense alone bestows,</L>
<L>And sensual bliss is all the nation knows.</L>
<L>In florid beauty groves and fields appear,</L>

<L>And even in penance planning sins anew.</L>
<L>All evils here contaminate the mind,</L>

<L>For wealth was theirs, not far remov'd the date,</L>
<L>When commerce proudly flourish through the state;</L>
<L>At her command the palace learnt to rise,</L>

<L>The canvas glow'd beyond e'en Nature warm,</L>

<L>Commerce on other shores display'd her sail;</L>

From these the feeble heart and long-fallen mind</L>

<L>In happier meanness occupy the mind:</L>
<L>As in those domes, where Caesars once bore sway,</L>
<L>Defac'd by time and tott'ring in decay,</L>

<L>Yet still, even here, content can spread a charm,</L>

<L>No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal</L>
<L>To make him loath his vegetable meal;</L>
<L>But calm, and bred in ignorance and toil,</L>

<L>Honour, that praise which real merit gains,</L>
<L>Or even imaginary worth obtains,</L>
<L>Here passes current; paid from hand to hand,</L>

<L>But while this softer art their bliss supplies,</L>

<L>Nor this the worst. As nature's ties decay,</L>
<L>As duty, love, and honour fail to sway,</L>

<HEAD>TO
SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN have no expectations in an address of this
kind, either to add to your reputation, or to estab∣lish
my own. You can gain nothing from my ad∣miration,
as I am ignorant of that art in which
you are said to excel; and I may lose much by the
severity of your judgment, as few have a juster
taste in poetry than you. Setting interest there∣fore
aside, to which I never paid much attention,
I must be indulged at present in following my af∣fections.
The only dedication I ever made was to
my brother, because I loved him better than most
other men. He is since dead. Permit me to in∣scribe
this poem to you.</P>
<P>How far you may be pleased with the versification
and meer mechanical parts of this attempt, I do not
pretend to inquire; but I know you will object
<PB N="56" REF="121"/>
(and indeed several of our best and wisest friends
concur in the opinion) that the depopulation it de∣plores
is no where to be seen, and the disorders it
laments are only to be found in the poet's own
imagination. To this I can scarce make any other
answer than that I sincerely believe what I have
written; that I have taken all possible pains, in my
country excursions, for these four or five years past,
to be certain of what I allege, and that all my views
and inquiries have led me to believe those miseries
real, which I here attempt to display. But this is
not the place to enter into an inquiry, whether the
country be depopulating, or not; the discussion
would take up much room, and I should prove my∣self,
at best, an indifferent politician, to tire the
reader with a long preface, when I want his unfa∣tigued
attention to a long poem.</P>
<P>In regretting the depopulation of the country,
I inveigh against the increase of our luxuries; and
here also I expect the shout of modern politicians
against me. For twenty or thirty years past, it
has been the fashion to consider luxury as one of
the greatest national advantages; and all the wis∣dom
of antiquity in that particular, as erroneous.
Still, however, I must remain a professed ancient
on that head, and continue to think those luxu∣ries
prejudicial to states, by which so many vices
are introduced, and so many kingdoms have been
<PB N="57" REF="122"/>
undone. Indeed so much has been poured out of
late on the other side of the question, that, meerly
for the sake of novelty and variety, one would
sometimes wish to be in the right. I am,</P>

<L>I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,</L>
<L>Amidst the swains to shew my book-learn'd skill,</L>
<L>Around my fire an evening group to draw,</L>
<L>And tell of all I felt, and all I saw;</L>
<L>And, as an hare whom hounds and horns pursue,</L>

She, wretched matron, forc'd, in age, for bread,</L>

<L>To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,</L>

<L>Near yonder copse, where once the garden smil'd,</L>
<L>And still where many a garden flower grows wild;</L>
<L>There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,</L>
<L>The village preacher's modest mansion rose.</L>
<L>A man he was, to all the country dear,</L>
<L>And passing rich with forty pounds a year;</L>
<L>Remote from towns he ran his godly race,</L>
<L>Nor ere had chang'd, nor wish'd to change his place;</L>
<L>Unskillful he to fawn, or seek for power,</L>
<L>By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour;</L>
<L>Far other aims his heart had learn'd to prize,</L>
<L>More bent to raise the wretched than to rise.</L>
<L>His house was known to all the vagrant train,</L>
<L>He chid their wand'rings, but reliev'd their pain,</L>
<L>The long-remember'd beggar was his guest,</L>
<L>Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;</L>
<L>The ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud,</L>
<L>Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'd;</L>
<L>The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,</L>
<L>Sate by his fire, and talk'd the night away;</L>
<L>Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,</L>
<L>Shoulder'd his crutch, and shew'd how fields were won.</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="129"/>
Pleas'd with his guests, the good man learn'd to glow,</L>
<L>And quite forgot their vices in their woe;</L>
<L>Careless their merits, or their faults to scan,</L>
<L>His pity gave ere charity began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,</L>
<L>And even his failings lean'd to Virtue's side;</L>
<L>But in his duty prompt at every call,</L>
<L>He watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt, for all.</L>
<L>And, as a bird each fond endearment tries,</L>
<L>To tempt its new-fledg'd offspring to the skies;</L>
<L>He tried each art, reprov'd each dull delay,</L>
<L>Allur'd to brighter worlds, and led the way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beside the bed where parting life was laid,</L>
<L>And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd,</L>
<L>The rev'rend champion stood. At his controul,</L>

<L>The service past, around the pious man,</L>

<L>And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile.</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="130"/>
His ready smile a parent's warmth exprest,</L>
<L>Their welfare pleas'd him, and their cares distrest;</L>
<L>To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,</L>
<L>But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.</L>
<L>As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,</L>

<L>Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,</L>

<L>Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,</L>

While words of learned length, and thund'ring sound,</L>

<L>But past is all his fame. The very spot</L>

<HEAD>THE
HAUNCH OF VENISON,
A
POETICAL EPISTLE,
TO
LORD CLARE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THANKS, my lord, for your venison, for finer or
fatter</L>
<L>Never rang'd in a forest, or smoak'd in a platter;</L>
<L>The haunch was a picture for painters to study,</L>
<L>The fat was so white, and the lean was so ruddy;</L>
<L>Though my stomach was sharp, I could scarce help re∣gretting,</L>
<L>To spoil such a delicate picture by eating;</L>
<L>I had thoughts, in my chambers, to place it in view,</L>
<L>To be shewn to my friends as a piece of virtu;</L>
<L>As in some Irish houses, where things are so so,</L>
<L>One gammon of bacon hangs up for a show:</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="146"/>
But, for eating a rasher of what they take pride in,</L>
<L>They'd as soon think of eating the pan it is fry'd in.</L>
<L>But hold—let me pause—don't I hear you pronounce,</L>
<L>This tale of the bacon's a damnable bounce;</L>
<L>Well, suppose it a bounce—sure a poet may try,</L>
<L>By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, my lord, it's no bounce: I protest in my turn,</L>
<L>It's a truth—and your lordship may ask Mr. Burn.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Clare's nephew.</NOTE></L>
<L>To go on with my tale—as I gaz'd on the haunch;</L>
<L>I thought of a friend that was trusty and staunch,</L>
<L>So I cut it, and sent it to Reynolds undrest,</L>
<L>To paint it, or eat it, just as he lik'd best,</L>
<L>Of the neck and the breast I had next to dispose;</L>
<L>'Twas a neck and a breast that might rival Monroe's:</L>
<L>But in parting with these I was puzzled again,</L>
<L>With the how, and the who, and the where, and the
when.</L>
<L>There's H—d, and C—y, and H—rth, and H—ff,</L>
<L>I think they love venison—I know they love beef.</L>
<L>There's my countryman Higgins—Oh! let him alone,</L>
<L>For making a blunder, or picking a bone.</L>
<L>But <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ang it—to poets who seldom can eat,</L>
<L>Your very good mutton's a very good treat;</L>
<L>Such dainties to them their health it might hurt,</L>
<L>It's like sending them ruffles, when wanting a shirt.</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="147"/>
While thus I debated, in reverie center'd,</L>
<L>An acquaintance, a friend as he call'd himself, en∣ter'd;</L>
<L>An under-bred, sine-spoken fellow was he,</L>
<L>And he smil'd as he look'd at the venison and me.</L>
<L>“What have we got here?—Why this is good eating!</L>
<L>Your own I suppose—or is it in waiting?”</L>
<L>“Why whose should it be? cried I with a flounce,</L>
<L>I get these things often;—but that was a bounce:</L>
<L>Some lords, my acquaintance, that settle the nation,</L>
<L>Are pleas'd to be kind—but I hate ostentation.”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“If that be the case then, cried he, very gay,</L>
<L>I'm glad I have taken this house in my way.</L>
<L>To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me;</L>
<L>No words—I insist on't—precisely at <HI>three:</HI></L>
<L>We'll have Johnson, and Burke, all the wits will be
there;</L>
<L>My acquaintance is slight, or I'd ask my lord Clare.</L>
<L>And, now that I think on't, as I am a sinner!</L>
<L>We wanted this venison to make out the dinner.</L>
<L>What say you—a pasty, it shall, and it must,</L>
<L>And my wife, little Kitty, is famous for crust.</L>
<L>Here, porter—this venison with me to Mile-end;</L>
<L>No stirring—I beg—my dear friend—my dear friend!”</L>
<L>Thus snatching his hat, he brusht off like the wind,</L>
<L>And the porter and eatables follow'd behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="86" REF="148"/>
<L>Left alone to reflect, having emptied my shelf,</L>
<L>And “ nobody with me at sea but myself;”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the letters that passed between his royal highness Henry duke of Cumberland, and lady Grosvenor—12°. 1769.</NOTE></L>
<L>Tho' I could not help thinking my gentleman hasty,</L>
<L>Yet Johnson, and Burke, and a good venison pasty,</L>
<L>Were things that I never dislik'd in my life,</L>
<L>Though clogg'd with a coxcomb, and Kitty his wife.</L>
<L>So next day in due splendour to make my approach,</L>
<L>I drove to his door in my own hackney-coach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When come to the place where we all were to dine,</L>
<L>(A chair-lumber'd closet just twelve feet by nine:)</L>
<L>My friend bade me welcome, but struck me quite
dumb,</L>
<L>With tidings that Johnson, and Burke would not
come;</L>
<L>“For I knew it,” he cried, “both eternally fail,</L>
<L>The one with his speeches, and t'other with Thrale;</L>
<L>But no matter, I'll warrant we'll make up the party,</L>
<L>With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty.</L>
<L>The one is a Scotchman, the other a Jew,</L>
<L>They both of them merry, and authors like you;</L>
<L>The one writes the Snarler, the other the Scourge;</L>
<L>Some thinks he writes Cinna—he owns to Panurge.”</L>
<L>While thus he described them by trade and by name,</L>
<L>They enter'd, and dinner was serv'd as they came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At the top a fried liver, and bacon were seen,</L>
<L>At the bottom was tripe, in a swinging tureen;</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="149"/>
At the sides there was spinnage and pudding made
hot;</L>
<L>In the middle a place where the pasty—was not.</L>
<L>Now, my lord, as for tripe it's my utter aversion,</L>
<L>And your bacon I hate like a Turk or a Persian,</L>
<L>So there I sat stuck, like a horse in a pound,</L>
<L>While the bacon and liver went merrily round:</L>
<L>But what vex'd me most, was that d—'d Scottish
rogue,</L>
<L>With his long-winded speeches, his smiles and his
brogue,</L>
<L>And, “madam, quoth he, may this bit be my poison,</L>
<L>A prettier dinner I never set eyes on;</L>
<L>Pray a slice of your liver, though may I be curst,</L>
<L>But I've eat of your tripe, till I'm ready to burst.”</L>
<L>“The tripe, quoth the Jew, with his chocolate cheek,</L>
<L>I could dine on this tripe seven days in the week:</L>
<L>I like these here dinners so pretty and small;</L>
<L>But your friend there, the doctor, eats nothing at all.”</L>
<L>“ O—oh! quoth my friend, he'll come on in a trice,</L>
<L>He's keeping a corner for something that's nice:</L>
<L>There's a pasty”—“ a pasty! repeated the Jew;</L>
<L>I don't care, if I keep a corner for't too.”</L>
<L>“What the de'il, mon, a pasty! re-echo'd the Scot;</L>
<L>Though splitting, I'll still keep a corner for that. ”</L>
<L>“We'll all keep a corner, the lady cried out; ”</L>
<L>“We'll all keep a corner was echo'd about.”</L>
<L>While thus we resolv'd, and the pasty delay'd,</L>
<L>With looks that quite petrified, enter'd the maid;</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="150"/>
A visage so sad, and so pale with affright,</L>
<L>Wak'd Priam in drawing his curtains by night.</L>
<L>But we quickly found out, for who could mistake her?</L>
<L>That she came with some terrible news from the baker:</L>
<L>And so it fell out, for that negligent sloven,</L>
<L>Had shut out the pasty on shutting his oven.</L>
<L>Sad Philomel thus—but let similies drop—</L>
<L>And now that I think on't, the story may stop.</L>
<L>To be plain, my good lord, it's but labour misplac'd,</L>
<L>To send such good verses to one of your taste;</L>
<L>You've got an odd something—a kind of discerning—</L>
<L>A relish—a taste—sicken'd over by learning;</L>
<L>At least, it's your temper, as very well known,</L>
<L>That you think very slightly of all that's your own:</L>

<HEAD>SONG.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SUNG IN THE COMEDY
OF “SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<P>Sir, I send you a small production of the late Dr. Goldsmith, which has never been published, and which might perhaps have been totally lost, had I not secured it. He intended it as a song in the character of Miss Hard∣castle, in his admirable comedy of “She Stoops to Con∣quer,” but it was left out, as Mrs. Bulkley, who play'd the part, did not sing. He sung it himself, in private companies very agreeably. The tune is a pretty Irish air, called “The Humours of Balamagairy,” to which he told me he found it very difficult to adapt words; but he has succeeded very happily in these few lines. As I could sing the tune, and was fond of them, he was so good as to give me them, about a year ago, just as I was leaving London, and bidding him adieu for that season, little ap∣prehending that it was a last farewel. I preserve this lit∣tle relic, in his own hand writing, with an affectionate care. I am, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER>Your humble servant,
<SIGNED>JAMES BOSWELL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<L>AH, me! when shall I marry me?</L>
<L>Lovers are plenty; but fail to relieve me.</L>
<L>He, fond youth, that could carry me,</L>
<L>Offers to love, but means to deceive me.</L>
<L><PB N="108" REF="170"/>
But I will rally and combat the ruiner:</L>
<L>Not a look, not a smile shall my passion discover.</L>
<L>She that gives all to the false one pursuing her,</L>
<L>Makes but a penitent, and loses a lover.</L>

<L>IN these bold times, when Learning's sons explore,</L>
<L>The distant climates, and the savage shore;</L>
<L>When wise <HI>astronomers</HI> to India steer,</L>
<L>And quit for Venus many a brighter here;</L>
<L>While <HI>botanists,</HI> all cold to smiles and dimpling,</L>
<L>Forsake the fair, and patiently—go simpling.</L>
<L>Our bard into the general spirit enters,</L>
<L>And fits his little frigate for adventures.</L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="172"/>
With <HI>Scythian</HI> stores, and trinkets deeply laden,</L>
<L>He this way steers his course, in hopes of trading—</L>
<L>Yet ere he lands he 'as order'd me before,</L>
<L>To make an observation on the shore.</L>
<L>Where are we driven? our reckoning sure is lost!</L>
<L>This seems a rocky and a dangerous coast.</L>
<L>Lord, what a sultry climate am I under!</L>
<L>Yon ill-foreboding cloud seems big with thunder:
(<STAGE>Upper gallery.</STAGE>)</L>
<L>There mangroves spread, and larger than I've seen 'em—
(<STAGE>Pit.</STAGE>)</L>
<L>Here trees of stately size—and billing turtles in 'em—
(<STAGE>Balconies.</STAGE>)</L>
<L>Here ill conditioned oranges abound.—(<STAGE>Stage.</STAGE>)</L>
<L>And apples, oitter apples strew the ground:
[<STAGE>Tasting them.</STAGE></L>
<L>The inhabitants are canibals I fear:</L>
<L>I heard a hissing—there are serpents here!</L>
<L>O, there the people are—best keep my distance;</L>
<L>Our Captain (gentle natives) craves assistance;</L>
<L>Our ship's well stor'd—in yonder creek we've laid
her,</L>
<L>His honour is no mercenary trader.</L>
<L>This is his first adventure, lend him aid,</L>
<L>And we may chance to drive a thriving trade.</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="173"/>
His goods, he hopes, are prime, and brought from
far,</L>
<L>Equally sit for gallantry and war.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,
SPOKEN BY
MR. LEE LEWES,
IN THE CHARACTER OF HARLEQUIN, AT HIS
BENEFIT.</HEAD>
<L>HOLD! Prompter, hold! a word before your
nonsense;</L>
<L>I'd speak a word or two, to ease my conscience.</L>
<L>My pride forbids it ever should be said,</L>
<L>My heels eclips'd the honours of my head;</L>
<L>That I found humour in a pyeball vest,</L>
<L>Or ever thought that jumping was a jest.
[<STAGE>Takes off his mask.</STAGE></L>
<L>Whence, and what art thou, visionary birth?</L>
<L>Nature disowns, and reason scorns thy mirth,</L>
<L>In thy black aspect every passion sleeps,</L>
<L>The joy that dimples, and the woe that weeps.</L>
<L>How hast thou fill'd the scene with all thy brood,</L>
<L>Of fools pursuing, and of fools pursu'd!</L>
<L><PB N="113" REF="175"/>
Whose ins and outs no ray of sense discloses,</L>
<L>Whose only plot it is to break our noses;</L>
<L>Whilst from below the trap-door <HI>Daemons</HI> rise,</L>
<L>And from above the dangling deities;</L>
<L>And shall I mix in this unhallow'd crew?</L>
<L>May rosin'd lightning blast me, if I do!</L>
<L>No—I will act, I'll vindicate the stage:</L>
<L>Shakespeare himself shall feel my tragic rage.</L>
<L>Off! off! vile trappings! a new passion reigns!</L>
<L>The mad'ning monarch revels in my veins.</L>
<L>Oh! for a Richard's voice to catch the theme:</L>
<L>Give me another horse! bind up my wounds!—
soft—'twas but a dream.</L>
<L>Aye, 'twas but a dream, for now there's no retreating:</L>
<L>If I cease Harlequin, I cease from eating.</L>
<L>'Twas thus that Aesop's stag, a creature blameless,</L>
<L>Yet something vain, like one that shall be nameless,</L>
<L>Once on the margin of a fountain stood,</L>
<L>And cavill'd at his image in the flood.</L>
<L>“The deuce confound,” he cries, “these drum∣stick
shanks,</L>
<L>They never have my gratitude nor thanks;</L>
<L>They're perfectly disgraceful! strike me dead!</L>
<L>But for a head, yes, yes, I have a head.</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="176"/>
How piercing is that eye! how sleek that brow!</L>
<L>My horns! I'm told horns are the fashion now.”</L>
<L>Whilst thus he spoke, astonish'd! to his view,</L>
<L>Near, and more near, the hounds and huntsmen drew.</L>
<L>Hoicks! hark forward! came thundering from be∣hind,</L>
<L>He bounds aloft, outstrips the fleeting wind:</L>
<L>He quits the woods, and tries the beaten ways;</L>
<L>He starts, he pants, he takes the circling maze.</L>
<L>At length his silly head, so priz'd before,</L>
<L>Is taught his former folly to deplore;</L>
<L>Whilst his strong limbs conspire to set him free,</L>
<L>And at one bound he saves himself, like me.</L>

<HEAD>THE
LOGICIANS REFUTED.
IN IMITATION OF DEAN SWIFT.</HEAD>
<L>LOGICIANS have but ill defin'd</L>
<L>As rational the human mind;</L>
<L>Reason, they say, belongs to man,</L>
<L>But let them prove it if they can.</L>
<L>Wise Aristotle and Smiglefius,</L>
<L>By Ratiocinations specious,</L>
<L>Have strove to prove with great precision,</L>
<L>With definition and division,</L>
<L>Homo est ratione preditum;</L>
<L>But for my soul I cannot credit 'em.</L>
<L>And must in spite of them maintain,</L>
<L>That man and all his ways are vain;</L>
<L>And that this boasted lord of nature,</L>
<L>Is both a weak and erring creature.</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="178"/>
That instinct is a surer guide,</L>
<L>Than reason-boasting mortals pride;</L>
<L>And that brute beasts are far before 'em,</L>
<L>Deus est anima brutorum.</L>
<L>Whoever knew an honest brute,</L>
<L>At law his neighbour prosecute,</L>
<L>Bring action for assault and battery,</L>
<L>Or friend beguile with lies and flattery.</L>
<L>O'er plains they ramble unconfin'd,</L>
<L>No politics disturb their mind;</L>
<L>They eat their meals, and take their sport,</L>
<L>Nor know who's in or out at court,</L>
<L>They never to the levee go</L>
<L>To treat as dearest friend, a foe:</L>
<L>They never importune his grace,</L>
<L>Nor ever cringe to men in place;</L>
<L>Nor undertake a dirty job,</L>
<L>Nor draw the quill to write for Bob,</L>
<L>Fraught with invective they ne'er go,</L>
<L>To folks at Pater-noster Row:</L>
<L>No judges, fidlers, dancing masters,</L>
<L>No pick-pockets, or poetasters,</L>
<L>Are known to honest quadrupeeds,</L>
<L>No single brute his fellows leads.</L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="179"/>
Brutes never meet in bloody fray,</L>
<L>Nor cut each others throats for pay.</L>
<L>Of beasts, it is confess'd, the ape</L>
<L>Comes nearest us in human shape,</L>
<L>Like man he imitates each fashion,</L>
<L>And malice is his ruling passion:</L>
<L>But both in malice and grimaces,</L>
<L>A courtier any ape surpasses.</L>
<L>Behold him humbly cringing wait,</L>
<L>Upon the minister of state:</L>
<L>View him soon after to inferiors</L>
<L>Aping the conduct of superiors:</L>
<L>He promises with equal air,</L>
<L>And to per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm takes equal care.</L>
<L>He in his turn finds imitators,</L>
<L>At court, the porters, lacques, waiters,</L>
<L>Their master's manners still contract,</L>
<L>And footmen, lords and dukes can act.</L>
<L>Thus at the court, both great and small,</L>
