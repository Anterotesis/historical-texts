<HEAD>THE
EARL OF DOUGLAS,
AN
ENGLISH STORY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII.
king of <HI>England, George Nevill,</HI>
earl of <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> had the
misfortune to be suspected an
accomplice with <HI>William de la
Pole,</HI> earl of <HI>Suffolk:</HI> he was
seized, and committed to the
Tower, where he remained pri∣soner
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
some years; but having
incontestably proved his inno∣cence
was at length set at liber∣ty.</P>
<P>THE warmth of resentment
for a disgrace he so little deserv∣ed,
and the many disagreeable
consequences that attended it, af∣fected
him so strongly, that, if
with honour he could have dis∣engaged
himself from the duty
he owed his country, he would
gladly have finished his days in
<HI>France;</HI> but finding no plausible
pretext for leaving the kingdom,
he resolved, however, to have
his nephew, <HI>Roger,</HI> earl of <HI>War∣wick,</HI>
educated at <HI>Paris.</HI> This
young nobleman was the son of
a brother, lately deceased, whose
dying request recommended him
to his care. A very favourable
opportunity enabled him to exe∣cute
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
his plan. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was
now upon the throne. Mary,
his sister, was a finished beauty.
The king had artfully rejected
several advantageous proposals of
marriage from the neighbouring
monarchs, by a reluctancy to
part with so bright an ornament
to his court, till the duke of
<HI>Longueville,</HI> who was taken pri∣soner
by <HI>Henry,</HI> at the battle of
<HI>Spurs,</HI> endeavoured to negotiate
a match with the Princess <HI>Mary,</HI>
and his master <HI>Louis</HI> XII. The
<HI>English</HI> monarch listened with
rapture to the proposal, and the
<HI>French</HI> one was so charmed with
the lady's portrait, that he im∣mediately
dispatched an envoy,
who concluded both a peace and
a marriage within a fortnight,
and conducted the princess to
<HI>Boulogne.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
THE earl of <HI>Abergavenny</HI>
prevailed with this ambassador to
take his nephew as one of the
princesses pages, who not being
more than eleven years old, pas∣sed
unobserved in her train.</P>
<P>THE king sent the <HI>Count de
Angaulesme</HI> to receive the prin∣cess,
and espouse her by proxy.
This prince, whose person was
particularly pleasing, executed
his commission with so much wit
and gallentry, that the young
queen could not forbear letting
a sigh of tender recollection es∣cape
her.—The earl was not in∣sensible
to the charms of the
beautiful <HI>Mary;</HI> the flame was
kindled in his heart, which was
only awakened in hers; and pos∣sibly
he might have indulged this
amorous pursuit still farther, had
it not being checked in its course
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
by Chancellor <HI>du Pratt;</HI> who
tried to move him on the side of
interest and policy; but perceiv∣ing
these were things he regarded
with contempt, and that his
imagination was too much heat∣ed
to be guided by reason, he
ventured to trust him with the
new queen's attachment to the
duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> which at once
cooled his ardour.</P>
<P>THE king waited at <HI>Abbe∣ville</HI>
for his royal partner, where
their nuptials were celebrated
with the utmost magnificence.
Six weeks after their entry into
<HI>Paris, Louis</HI> died in the Palace of
<HI>Toumelles.</HI> The queen decla∣ring
herself not with-child, the
<HI>Count de Angaulesme</HI> ascended
the throne, by the title of <HI>Fran∣cis</HI>
I. She was permitted to mar∣ry
the duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who was
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
sent by <HI>Henry</HI> to attend the
queen into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> by his
uncle's order, continued at <HI>Paris,</HI>
and was honoured with the same
post he had enjoyed in the queen's
household. He attended at an
interview between the king's of
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> who were
indisputably the most accomplish∣ed
and gallant princes of the age:
their courts were equally bril∣liant
and magnificent. Tourna∣ments
and runnings at the ring,
in honour of the ladies, drew
from all parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> per∣sons
of the first fashion, to be
spectators, or competitors in these
royal amusement; and the camp
between <HI>Guesnes,</HI> and <HI>Ardres,</HI>
was called from its splendor, the
<HI>Pavillion of Cloth of Gold.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
AMONG the numerous beau∣ties
that graced the circle, the
countess of <HI>Lorge</HI> had the satis∣faction
of observing the looks
and admiration of the company
were not divided. Lady <HI>Eliza
Montgomery,</HI> her daughter, bore
the prize of beauty from all her
companions. The earl of <HI>War∣wick,</HI>
then turned of fifteen, was
so struck with her incomparable
beauty, he was ready to sink
when his uncle acquainted him
that <HI>Henry</HI> insisted on his taking
leave of the king of <HI>France,</HI>
with proper acknowledgments of
his kindness, and returning im∣mediately
to <HI>England.</HI> Not in
a situation to oppose the com∣mand
of <HI>Henry,</HI> or the will of
his uncle, the young earl, not∣withstanding
his regret, was o∣bliged
to obey, without the con∣solation
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
of convincing her of the
sincerity of his passion.</P>
<P>HE embarked in the royal
fleet, impressed with an idea of
the fair <HI>Eliza,</HI> so full of tender∣ness
and sensibility, as from the
moment of departure banished
tranquillity from his breast.</P>
<P>THE two monarchs separated
so mutually satisfied with each
other, that nothing was talked of
but the harmony and grandure
of the late congress. Amongst
the noblemen who had been
most lavish in expence on that
occasion, was the duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham</HI>
But Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI>
the king's favorite, having
learnt that, before he left <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
the duke expressed some
dislike to an expedition so un∣necessary
and expensive, resolved
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
to avail himself of that circum∣stance,
to compass his ruin;
considering him as an obstacle to
his ambitious designs. Accord∣ingly,
no sooner was the king
arrived, than the cardinal ac∣cused
the duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
of high treason. <HI>Henry</HI> surpri∣sed
and irritated, wrote to him
to come instantly and clear him∣self
of the accusation:—he was
put under an arrest the moment
he appeared, with his son-in-law,
the earl of <HI>Abergavenny</HI> and
though a loyal subject, the car∣dinal
gratified his vengeance.
The unfortunate duke lost his
head upon a scaffold; and Lord
<HI>Abergavenny</HI> was not released of
some months, with the entire
forfeiture of his estate.</P>
<P>MISFORTUNES, so heavy, in∣duced
him to send the earl of
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<HI>Warwick</HI> back to <HI>France,</HI> dread
lest the king's severity of tem∣per,
or rather the blind sub∣mission
he paid to <HI>Wolsey's</HI> opi∣nion,
should plunge his family
in fresh calamities, tempted him
to take the liberty of addressing
<HI>Francis</HI> I. to shelter his nephew
again under his protection. That
monarch graciously consented,
and the earl, constant to the
remembrance of Lady <HI>Eliza
Montgomery,</HI> was transported
with joy, to see her at court in
the rank of one of the queen's
maids of honour. His sole stu∣dy
was to gain her affection;
he devoted himself entirely to
her service; and his perseverance
flattered him, very justly, with
the hope of a tender return from
his amiable fair one.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
WOLSEY was setting all his
political engines at work to en∣able
him to wreak his fury on the
Emperor <HI>Maximilian.</HI>—He
wished to mortify the emperor
by engaging his master in a treaty
of marriage with <HI>Marguerite,</HI> one
of the madames of <HI>France.</HI> But
love was industrious in destroy∣ing
that machination. <HI>Henry</HI>
became passionately enamoured
of <HI>Anne Boleyne,</HI> daughter to
Sir <HI>Thomas Boleyne.</HI> appointed
maid of honour to the Princess
<HI>Mary,</HI> on her marriage with
<HI>Louis,</HI> and who was now return∣ed
to her native country: the
singular elegance of her person,
animated with a brilliant turn of
wit, enchanted the susceptible
monarch to such a degree, that
he fancied he could not exist with∣out
her—that all his happiness
was centred in her smiles.—The
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
resistance with which she repuls∣ed
his amorous solicitations, de∣termined
him to take her to his
throne: he omitted nothing to
prevail with the pope to dissolve
his marriage with Queen <HI>Cathe∣rine;</HI>
and the firmness of the
pontiff in refusing his consent to
this unjust action, inflamed him
so violently, that it became the
final cause of the reformation.</P>
<P>HENRY went to <HI>Boulogne,</HI>
where the royal family of <HI>France</HI>
met him, and repeated assurances
passed of reciprocal friendship.
The true motive of the king of
<HI>England's</HI> voyage was to com∣plain
of the pope's inflexibility,
and to engage <HI>Francis</HI> to solicit
his holiness to summons a coun∣cil
for the prosecution of his di∣vorce.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
THE earl of <HI>Warwick's</HI> soli∣citude
and attachment to the fair
<HI>Montgomery,</HI> had so strongly
convinced her of his merit and
affection, that she agreed to his
addressing the king and queen
for their consent. This lady,
since her mother's death, de∣pended
entirely upon her majes∣ty;
the earl was no longer un∣der
the guardianship of his re∣lations,
and the alliance he
sought was so honourable, that
it met with general approbation.
He obtained with facility from
his royal benefactress a gift, in
his estimation, preferable to the
universe itself! Their nuptials
were celebrated at <HI>Calais,</HI> and
nothing could exceed the diver∣sions
and splendour that accom∣panied
them: the two kings ri∣valled
each other in conferring
honours and presents on the no∣ble
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
pair, and they attended <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THE king's passion for <HI>Anne
Boleyne,</HI> augmented in propor∣tion
to the obstacles he had to
encounter. He married her,
and they were directly crowned
at <HI>Westminster;</HI> but when the
pope's bull was fulminated from
<HI>Rome,</HI> he grew frantic!—He
declared himself <HI>supreme head of
the church,</HI> and became the per∣secutor
of those whose doctrines
he had defended. Every day
was ushered in with the execu∣tion
of persons of all ranks and
sexes, in the cause of religion;
and his wrath extended to the
profanation of relicks, burning
those of <HI>Becket</HI> at <HI>Canterbury.</HI>
The earl of <HI>Exeter,</HI> brother to
Cardinal <HI>Pole,</HI> and <HI>Edward Ne∣vil,</HI>
Lord <HI>Courtenay,</HI> animated
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
with zeal and indignation, ven∣tured
to remonstrate to his ma∣jesty
on the severity of his con∣duct.
Their heads paid the price
of their temerity; and as the
earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was of near kin∣dred
to Lord <HI>Courtenay,</HI> he was
accused of disrespectful murmur∣ings;
which, however false,
made it necessary to leave the
kingdom with expedition, to a∣void
an ignominious death.—
Those branches of his family,
who were more anxious about
their lives and estates, than their
consciences and honours, con∣formed
with servile submission,
to the will of the sovereign.—
They embraced his religion,
and through policy, avowed
themselves the bitterest enemies
to the earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI> His
estate was confiscated—but
what touched him more than
all his afflictions, was the
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
necessity of a separation from
one of the most charming and
virtuous women in the world.
With her he left an only daugh∣ter,
named <HI>Julia,</HI> of two years
old: and, recommending in the
tenderest terms this precious
pledge of their union to her care,
he informed her of his resolution
to go to <HI>Venice,</HI> then at war with
the <HI>Turks;</HI> that the <HI>Pope,</HI> the
<HI>Emperor,</HI> and the <HI>Doge,</HI> had just
concluded a treaty against <HI>Soly∣man</HI>—
That now was the time
to acquire fame, or find a glori∣ous
death!</P>
<P>THE countess, drowned in
tears, could scarcely support her
spirits at this melancholy part∣ing,
from a husband so infinitely
dear! yet she would not exert
her influence to detain him, ter∣rified
as she was, with the dan∣ger
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
he was exposed to in staying
longer; and convinced that he
could hope for no advantages in a
country where his religion was
an insurmountable bar to prefer∣ment:
she was sensible the earl
was now at a time of life when
a man of spirit reproaches him∣self
for inactivity and ease; and
her virtue and fortitude, taught
her to approve what her love la∣mented.</P>
<P>A FAVOURABLE wind soon
wafted him to <HI>Venice;</HI> he was
received by the Admiral <HI>Capello,</HI>
with evident testimonies of es∣teem,
wakened by a former ac∣quaintance
with the house of
<HI>Warwick:</HI> he went with him to
<HI>Corfou,</HI> where they joined the
squadrons of the pope and the
emperor: a council of war was
held, when it was debated whe∣ther
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
they were strong enough to
bear down upon the enemy im∣mediately?
It was carried in
the affirmative. The <HI>Turks</HI> were
surprized at the impetuosity of
the confederates, and undeter∣mined
whether to engage or not?
When the intrepid <HI>Barbarossa</HI> re∣solved
to repair by some memo∣rable
action the disgrace he had
sustained in his former retreat
from <HI>Corfou.</HI></P>
<P>CAPELLO commanded the first
division, and the enemy was no
sooner in sight, than, inspired
with a noble emulation, he
crowded all his sail to attack
them: he repeated his fire so suc∣cessfully,
they were compelled
to retire. Prince <HI>Doria,</HI> perceiv∣ing
the advantage gained by the
<HI>Venetian</HI> admiral, advanced with
his squadron, apparently to se∣cond
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
the attack; but without
any discoverable reason, tacked
about, and retreated to <HI>Cape
Cal.</HI></P>
<P>THIS disappointent was very
sensibly felt by the allies, who
broke into loud complaints,
and the <HI>Turks</HI> observing them
slacken their sails, on a sudden,
came out of the Gulf, and formed
a line of battle; but the irreso∣lution
and doubts of the confede∣rates,
prevented an engagement,
so that <HI>Barbarossa,</HI> and the fa∣mous
Corsair <HI>Dragut Rais,</HI> had
time to gain the shore, whilst the
allies reflected with astonishment
on the glorious opportunity they
had lost: <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pello,</HI> and the Patri∣arch
<HI>Grimani,</HI> blushing with
shame and anger, got on board a
light frigate, and went in pur∣suit
of <HI>Doria,</HI> whom they in∣treated
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
to join in taking the ad∣vantages
fortune offered to their
acceptance. Let us go my lord,
said the <HI>Venetian</HI> admiral, let
us go where glory calls us; let
us attack our half-vanquished
enemies, who demonstrate their
fear by their flight.—I wait
but for your orders.—The cry
was now to engage. <HI>Doria</HI> a∣shamed
of being the only person
who retarded their eagerness,
gave orders to begin the fight,
and a second time retreated, in
the moment when all things
seemed to promise success.</P>
<P>DRAGUT RAIS, seeing two
<HI>Venetian</HI> galleys in the rear of the
fleet, at some distance, endea∣voured
to board them: the earl
of <HI>Warwick,</HI> unfortunately for
him, was in one of these vessels.
The resistance he made was the
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
admiration of both parties.—
Nature, exhausted by extraordi∣nary
efforts of courage, at length
sunk under superior numbers.
Some soldiers, who swam on
shore, carried with them the
news of his death The com∣manders
and officers who had
been witnesses to his gallantry,
were exceedingly afflicted; and
as fame redoubles her blast for
the conveyance of bad news,
and the countess of <HI>Warwick's</HI>
anxiety industriously sought eve∣ry
opportunity of information,
she was too soon acquainted with
her irreparable loss. This ten∣der
wife, unable to resist the
storm of grief, that assaulted her
in its most dreadful fury, was
sensible her last hour was ap∣proaching;
and having no far∣ther
attachment to the world,
after being deprived of what was
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
dearer to her than life, felt no
regret but in the thought of leav∣ing
her lovely infant, who in its
early dawn gave the promise of
exquisite beauty. The afflicted
mother caught her in her arms,
tears trickling down the lillies of
her cheeks, O, my dear <HI>Julia!</HI>
my sweet innocent! what will
become of thee! said the dying
fair one, where wilt thou find a
father's care? where a mother's
fondness! Alas! thy fath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r is
no more!—and thy mother is
thine but a few hours! I leave
thee at an age when thou standest
most in need of maternal affec∣tion—but
I trust that providence
will take care to guard thee from
dangers to which I leave thee ex∣posed.
—To the supreme pro∣tector
of all things I commit
thee. Saying this, she raised
her eyes towards <HI>Heaven,</HI> be∣seeching
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
its protection on the
smiling infant.</P>
<P>IN this agony of distress, the
earl and countess of <HI>Douglas</HI>
came to visit her, in her retire∣ment,
which she had never quit∣ted
since her lord's departure.
They were persons of uncom∣mon
merit, and had always been
regarded as their best friends;
there was even some affinity be∣tween
the houses of <HI>Douglas</HI> and
<HI>Montgomery,</HI> the former the most
illustrious family in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
but particular subjects of discon∣tent
occasioned the earl of <HI>Doug∣las</HI>
to settle in <HI>England,</HI> when
he married a daughter of the earl
of <HI>Bedford's,</HI> a woman of worth
and understanding; they were
both in very good favour with
the king.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26"/>
THIS interview was distress∣ful
beyond conception. Their
sighs and tears a long time denied
them the power of speech, and
when they beheld the situation
of the countess, their sorrow
had no bounds.</P>
<P>AT length, exerting his ut∣most
fortitude, the earl said all
he thought capable of soothing
her distress, if not of allaying its
poignancy. She pressed his hand
to her heart, and bursting into
sighs and exclamations, that must
have affected persons indifferent
to her woes. Ah! Sir, said she,
there is the mortal wound. It
is impossible for me to recover,—
let, us, I beg of you, waste no
more of the <HI>little</HI> time I have to
live. Heaven seems to have sent
you, turning towards the coun∣tess,
to contribute to my repose.
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
I have a favour to ask—if you
grant it to my request, I shall
die without regret; I know the
goodness and generosity of both
so well, I venture to assure my∣self,
I shall not be refused? O,
my dear madam, interupted the
earl and countess, with impetu∣osity,
depend!—be assured no∣thing
will appear difficult that
can afford you the least consola∣tion!
—Explain your wishes
with entire certainty of our com∣pliance?
Alas! resumed she,
how shall I be able to express my
gratitude, if your benevolence
leads you as I intreat, and even
hope it may, to receive my dear
child! and adopt her for your
own. This poor little one loses
every thing in me! she is on the
point of falling into the hands of
her uncles, who to make their
court to the king, will educate
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
her in his new doctrine. I am
well acquainted with your zeal
for the antient religion, and was
I to separate the motives of friend∣ship
for my husband, and the
regard you always expressed for
the interest of my child, the
consideration of the more mate∣rial
concerns of salvation, would
induce me to believe you will
take all imaginable pains to con∣ceal
her birth, and let her pass
for your daughter. Our blood
flows in the same channel, you
are not a native subject of the
king's; so that his severity can∣not
extend to you; and you Sir,
are the only person to whom I
can confide my darling treasure
without apprehensions for her
eternal happiness.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Douglas</HI> said every
thing that could be expected
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
from a man of refined generosity,
a tender relation, or a sincere
friend.—The countess assured
Lady <HI>Warwick,</HI> that the little
<HI>Julia</HI> should divide her affection
with her two children, <HI>Hyppoli∣tus</HI>
and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> or if there was
any distinction, she should be
still dearer. I can find no lan∣guage
expressive of my feelings,
replied Lady <HI>Warwick,</HI> how is
it possible to answer such ama∣zing
obligations! I accept for
my dear infant the kindness you
promise, and I beg leave to de∣posit
in your hands, madam,
what jewels I have, that they
may supply her necessities when∣ever
she may want them; do me
the justice to believe, that by
this legacy I do not mean to dis∣trust
your generosity, I am per∣suaded,
in that particular, as well
as in the expence of her educa∣tion,
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
you will omit nothing sui∣table
to her birth; but since I
have them, it would be injustice
to deprive her of what properly
appertains to her. In finishing
these words, she presented a small
casket that stood by the bed-side,
which contained jewels to the
value of six thousand pounds:
there is all that is left of a no∣ble
fortune, said she, letting fall
some tears, a very inconsidera∣ble
provision for a girl of family,
and who, I believe, will not be
deficient in spirit and sentiment;
but as virtue is the most solid
possession, I hope she will never
be deprived of that, which is
scarcely possible under your hos∣pitable
roof. As to the rest,
when she is of age to be trusted
with a secret, inform her, I con∣jure
you (madam) whose daugh∣ter
she is, shew her the pictures
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
of her parents, which I now
give you—let her know the ex∣treme
tenderness with which we
loved her—and engage her to
pay those honours to our memo∣ry,
which filial duty would have
suggested the observance of, had
not the Almighty thought proper
to take us to himself.</P>
<P>SHE ceased speaking; her
eyes bathed in tears, she em∣braced
her little daughter a
thousand times; then, stretching
her hands to the earl and coun∣tess
of <HI>Douglas,</HI> she bid them the
last adieu! It is time for you to
leave me, said she▪ in a fainter
voice, it will be late before you
get to <HI>London,</HI> and whatever sa∣tisfaction
I have in beholding
you, my friends, we must part!
—I am sensible my strength
declines;—I must employ all
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
that is left in preparing for the
last scene.</P>
<P>THE noble pair were so sunk
in grief, that they wept with∣out
being able to answer her, or
to resolve to leave her; but be∣fore
they could recollect how to
act, the dying mother, whoso
presence of mind was always un∣common,
expressed her uneasi∣ness
in what manner they could
convey her daughter without
being perceived by some or other
of the domesticks, which would
be hazarding their acquainting
her uncles where she was: af∣ter
a few moments reflection,
she determined to trust her con∣fessor,
a man upon whose secre∣cy
she could depend, and with
his concurrence, the nurse, who
was a good catholick, might
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
spread a report that she died of
convulsions.</P>
<P>AFTER these measures were
settled, they comforted Lady
<HI>Warwick</HI> with the most cordial
promises of care and tenderness
to the lovely orphan. They were
obliged to be cautious in enqui∣ries
after they left her, lest their
solicitude should awaken suspi∣cion
in the minds of her relations.
In about five days they received
intelligence from the confessor of
her death, and the place where
the child was secreted. The
countess of <HI>Douglas</HI> brought it
from thence, and what enabled
her perfectly to conceal the mys∣tery,
was the death of an infant
daughter of the same age that
had been nursed in the ccuntry.
When the little <HI>Julia</HI> was intro∣duced
into her mama's appart∣ment,
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
for so we must now call
the countess of <HI>Douglas,</HI> her son,
<HI>Hyppolytus</HI> was present, then se∣ven
years old, and remarkably
handsome and sensible. He ap∣peared
delighted with his new
sister; and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who was a∣bout
four, was not half so great
a favourite: this partiality en∣creased
daily; he was never easy
out of her sight. The emotions
of the heart are very apparent
during infancy, when the lan∣guage
of nature is only heard—
it spoke in a thousand little assi∣duities
towards <HI>Julia,</HI> who at
twelve years old promised a com∣pleat
model of perfection in
mind and person, that attracted
general admiration; her figure
was tall and genteel; her air ma∣jestic,
yet softened with modes∣ty
and sweetness. The lustre of
her fine black eyes dazzled the
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
beholders. The smiling graces
played round the roses of her
lips, and lilly whiteness of her
teeth and complection, the latter
tinged with the animated blush
of Guido's Aurora! Her fair hair
flowed in a profusion of natural
ringl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, setting off the delicacy
of her beauty. The fine turn of
her neck and feet, even exceed∣ed
that elegance peculiar to the
<HI>English</HI> ladies. Her movement
in walking and dancing, was in∣imitable.
Her voice was har∣mony
itself, enchanting the
listening ear. The manly beauty
of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was equally wor∣thy
of regard. His shape, his
features, his intelligent counte∣nance;
a noble frankness, con∣nected
with manners polite
and complacent, an understand∣ing
enlarged and improved;
—all these were so conspicu∣ous,
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
that to see him was to ho∣nour!
to esteem! to love. <HI>Lu∣cilla</HI>
had a great deal of wit and
chearfulness, and where <HI>Julia</HI>
was not present, would have
been allowed superior in charms
to most of her sex.</P>
<P>THESE three young persons
lived in the strictest friendship,
till at length <HI>Hyppolytus</HI> began to
lose his vivacity, and <HI>Julia</HI> to
fall into deep musing. They
could not bear the shortest sepa∣ration,
and would fly in search
of each other, but when found,
they would only suppress a sigh,
and be at a loss for words.</P>
<P>They would look whole hours
in silent languishment, and seem∣ed
lost in this innocent pleasure;
—when a sudden recollection
would mount the blood into their
cheeks. They would fix their
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
eyes on the ground in profound
meditation.</P>
<P>YET the days appeared too
short to satisfy their impatience
of seeing and conversing with
each other; and absence always
made them sensible their whole
happiness was centred in the
pleasure of meeting again. <HI>Lu∣cilla's</HI>
playful disposition often
tempted her to rally them. Bro∣ther,
said she, to <HI>Hyppolytus,</HI>
you love my sister better than
you do me; as her elder, I have
a right to be jealous;—but I
will honestly confess that I can't
complain of the justice of your
preference, for tho' I love you
very much, I verily believe she
loves you still more! Don't be∣lieve
her, <HI>Hyppolytus,</HI> said the
blushing <HI>Julia,</HI> we have both of
us an equal regard for you! And
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
why, my dear sister, will you
damp the joy I have, in hearing
that you love me? <HI>Julia</HI> was
too much embarrassed to reply,
and fell into her usual thought∣fulness;
whilst <HI>Hyppolytus</HI> was
silent from grief and chagrine;
and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who looked at both
with astonishment, was at a loss
to form any conjecture of the
cause.</P>
<P>IT happened one day, when
the earl and countess were at a
fine house of their's at <HI>Bucking∣ham,
Julia</HI> was walking with
her brother and sister by the side
of a lake, she had an inclination
to row to a little island in the
centre, to look at a swans nest:
no sooner had she expressed her
desire, <HI>Hyppolytus</HI> run with ea∣gerness
to unloose a small boat
tyed to the foot of a tree, and
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
rowing it towards his sisters,
took them in. But not knowing
how to manage the oars, they
were soon entangled amongst
the rushes; the ladies were
frightened at finding the boat
lean too much on one side,
and, in hopes of poising it, threw
themselves so suddenly on the o∣ther,
that it overset; and they
were in imminent danger of
being drowned. Had <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
been alone, he could easily have
saved himself, but in such situ∣ations
the effort to assist the per∣son
we love, banishes all selfish
considerations.—He thought of
nothing but his dear <HI>Julia,</HI> and
tenderness supplying him with
fresh strength and skill in swim∣ming,
he caught hold of her
cloaths, and drew her safe to the
little island, which was not very
distant: but there is no descri∣bing
the excess of his grief when
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
he saw her eyes closed, and her
face covered with a mortal pale∣ness:
—she was motionless, and
as we are apt to believe, what
we most dread, he did not doubt
her being gone for ever:—Ah
wretch that I am! said he, my
unskilfulness has caused her death!
she was breathless before I could
draw her from the water! <HI>Julia,</HI>
my dear <HI>Julia!</HI> what will be
my fate! Saying this, he caught
her in his arms in all the ago∣nies
of woe, and laying his cheek
to her's, his loud exclamations,
and streaming tears, soon reco∣vered
her from a swoon that fear
alone had occasioned.</P>
<P>OPENING her lovely eyes, and
fixing them upon those of <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
who in this moment felt
his own life renewed. You seem
deeply affected, my dear brother,
said she, can you think me wor∣thy
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
of being regretted by you?
Or ought I myself to regret leav∣ing
life? Ah, my dearest sister,
said he, embracing her, I beg
you not to recall to my remem∣brance
that we must ever part.
—If you knew the exquisite
torture I have suffered from this
apprehension, you would pity
me! Before <HI>Julia</HI> could reply,
they saw a boat, which the earl
of <HI>Douglas</HI> had sent to bring
them over the lake; for by a
peculiar providence in favour of
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> his lordship passed by at
the very moment the boat over∣set,
and his attendants jumpt in∣to
the water to save her, other∣wise
she must inevitably have pe∣rished;
for notwithstanding the
real tenderness of her brother,
his soul had been so engrossed by
<HI>Julia's</HI> danger, he never once
thought of his sister's!</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42"/>
On their landing, the earl and
countess reprimanded them with
some warmth on running such
hazards, and as <HI>Lucilla's</HI> sensi∣bility
was alarmed by her bro∣ther's
indifference on this occa∣sion,
she could not forbear ex∣pressing
a little resentment.—
“Indeed, said she, I had all the
danger to myself—When my
sister is in company, she may de∣pend
on my brother's care of
her, but as for me, I don't know
who I have to depend upon!”—
This reproach disconcerted them
bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h extremely; and at the same
time explained to Lord and Lady
<HI>Douglas,</HI> what inattention had
hitherto prevented them from
observing. They looked at each
other in a manner expressive of
surprize and vexation. They
had long disposed of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
in their own imagination, to the
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
only daughter of the earl of <HI>Ar∣gyle;</HI>
a rich heiress, and his near
relation. The earl purposed
sending <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
to wait upon the lady and win
her affection. There was also a
scheme to marry <HI>Julia</HI> to the earl
of <HI>Bedford,</HI> of the same family
with the countess, who had ex∣pressed
a very particular regard
for that young beauty.</P>
<P>THEY were no sooner alone
than they eagerly started their
doubts—Good God! can it be
possible, that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> enter∣tains
sentiments for <HI>Julia</HI> differ∣ent
from those of fraternal af∣fection.
They recollected a thou∣sand
circumstances that seemed
to reveal it—and it was resolved
between them, the countess
should take the first opportunity
of talking with <HI>Julia,</HI> without
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
the appearance of premeditation.
—One morning she went into
her daughter's appartments and
found <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> kneeling by
<HI>Julia's</HI> bed-side, who was still
sleeping. “You are grown a
a remarkably early riser Sir, said
the countess, in a severe tone,
but you might employ your hours
much more advantageously at
your studies, than in coming per∣petually
into your sister's cham∣ber!
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> retired very
sorrowfully; and the countess
addressing her daughters, told
them, that though they ought
to have the tenderest regard for
their brother, and as far as her
authority extended, she com∣manded
them to have it, yet she
did not think it consistent with
propriety and decorum, now they
were above the state of infancy,
to suffer too great familiarity.
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
That she always wished to cul∣tivate
the strictest friendship a∣mongst
her children, but that
the difference of sex required a
delicate degree of circumspection.
<HI>Lucilla</HI> declared her implicit o∣bedience.
<HI>—Julia</HI> looked upon
the ground and blushed: the
countess's reprimand augmented
her melancholy, which, how∣ever
great her solicitude to con∣ceal,
was but too apparent.</P>
<P>SHE spent part of every day
in her closet, and sitting one e∣vening
at the window, saw the
earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> coming up the
avenue, that led to the house.
She had always thought his con∣versation
disagreeable, but her
present disposition made her un∣able
to support the thoughts of it:
she hurried into the garden to a∣void
him;—and that being very
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
extensive, ran through the walks
to gain a little wood at the bot∣tom;
and still fearing the ser∣vants
might be sent in search of
her, she entered a grotto, not less
agreeable for its coolness, than
from the wild rock-work with
which it was ornamented, and
the elegant statues artfully dis∣posed
in niches at proper inter∣vals;
—a noble sheet of water
at one end, constantly sparkled
amongst the pebbles below, and
preserved the fresnness of the
moss that bordered the fountain.
Opposite was an alcove, covered
with woodbines, whose sweet∣ness
and shade were adapted to
the taste of the pensive <HI>Julia;</HI>
she here abandoned herself to the
most gloomy reflections; when
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> induced by pretty near
the same motives, came to seek
in the same place, and asylum
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
from the fatigue of entertaining
a large party of company who
were come to visit the earl.</P>
<P>HE threw himself on the ground
without seeing <HI>Julia,</HI> leaning his
head against part of the rock—
and remained for some time
plunged in unutterable sorrow.
—At length, breaking out at
once, “<HI>Julia!</HI> my dear <HI>Julia!</HI>
he exclaimed, since the passion
I have for you is forbid by <HI>Hea∣ven!</HI>
since I am guilty of a crime
in adoring you, and it is much
more eligible to me to die, than
cease to love you, I wíll die!—
the innocent victim of an invo∣luntary
flame I have not been
able to extinguish!”—In a tran∣sport
of despair, he drew his
sword, turning the point towards
his breast—when <HI>Julia</HI> shrieked
out, O, my brother!—holding
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
his arm, what means this frenzy?
what fatal madness has possessed
you? <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> abashed and
surprized, sunk down at her feet;
and after he could recover him∣self
enough to speak:—Sister,
said he, I am no longer master
of my secret;—chance has in∣formed
you of it;—what asto∣nishes
me is, that knowing the
just cause of my despair, your
compassion should desire me to
live.—I am undeserving of your
goodness, my dear <HI>Julia,</HI> how∣ever
involuntary my crime;—
notwithstanding I have omitted
no endeavours to regulate my af∣fection,
and restrain it within
the bounds of duty.—The bane∣ful
star that rules my destiny op∣poses
its influence to my efforts;
—finding resistance vain, I de∣termined
to put an end to my
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
woes by a violent remedy, when
you prevented me!</P>
<P>ALAS! replied <HI>Julia,</HI> alas my
brother! that star you com∣plain
of has extended its maligni∣ty
to me!—in being sensible of
your own misfortune, be sensible
of mine!<HI>—Hyppolitus</HI> I love!
—I love too well for a sister!—I
confess it—and hope to merit
part of your pity, by giving you
all mine;—and by resolving
never to see you more?—Yes,
my brother, I will retire to a
convent and conceal my shame
and misery from the world—I
would have even concealed it
from you, but where was the
possibility, in the situation I sur∣prized
you, of refusing this last
consolation? <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was so
enraptured with the sound of his
dear <HI>Julia's</HI> voice, that he had
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
lost his own. He continued in
silence at her feet, his eyes ri∣vetted
on her's.—In spite of ti∣midity,
he at length faltered out
these words,—I will not op∣pose
a resolution so generous;
whatever pain I suffer in loving
you for ever—in seeing you im∣mured
within the walls of a
cloister;—my heart will find a
degree of comfort in thinking
you will not be the wife of the
earl of <HI>Bedford.</HI>—Ah! interrupt∣ed
<HI>Julia,</HI> is he the only excep∣tion
you would wish to make?
Alas! my sister, rejoyned <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
do not oblige me to ex∣plain
myself further—but be as∣sured,
on my side, that I will ne∣ver
change my manner of life—
which, from the moment our
separation commences, will be
so deplorably miserable, as not
to be of long duration. <HI>Julia</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
could only answer by heavy
sighs—they both melted into
tears.—Brother said she, gazing
tenderly upon him, it is over,
we must meet no more.—Alas!
my dear <HI>Julia,</HI> it is a pleasure I dare
not, must not wish!—Let us strive
to conceal our unfortunate attach∣ment
from the world, resumed
she, and if possible, from our∣selves!
—Saying this she arose,
and went out of the grotto, with∣out
looking at <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who
beheld her depart without daring
to detain her.</P>
<P>HER depression of spirits would
not allow her to enter the draw∣ing-room
till very late, knowing
she should find the earl of <HI>Bed∣ford</HI>
there; and it was to her an
addition of misery to listen to a
declared lover, for whom she had
the most perfect indifference;
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
she carefully avoided any parti∣cular
conversation, and he re∣turned
to <HI>London</HI> the same even∣ing.
<HI>—Julia</HI> passed the night in
the utmost distress;—her amaze∣ment
was beyond expression,
when she reflected on her bro∣ther's
sentiments, and her own.
Good <HI>God!</HI> said she, weeping
bìtterly, what have we done to
deserve, young as we are, so ri∣gorous
a punishment? She rose
very early, without once closing
her eyes, drest herself with speed,
and knowing Lady <HI>Douglas</HI> was
in her closet, went in trembling,
and threw herself on her knees.
—This action surprized her:—
Well, <HI>Julia,</HI> said the countess,
tenderly, what occasions this sup∣plicating
posture?—Madam,
the desire of obtaining a favour,
which I venture to intreat you
will not refuse: I am now in
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
my sixteenth year,—I am your
youngest daughter, and can ex∣pect
no great fortune;—I don't
feel the least inclination for being
settled in the world, but have a
very strong one for a religious
life; so, my dear madam, if the
wish I have to go to <HI>France</HI> is
not displeasing to you, I beg you
will consent, and that you will
perswade my father; and then
either he or you will place me
in a convent. My child, said
the countess, a good deal affect∣ed,
have you sensibly considered
the consequences of this request?
It would be a sad affair if you
should deceive yourself by mis∣taken
appearances.—You are
yet so young, that you ought to
take more time in a matter of
such importance.<HI>—Julia</HI> re∣peated
with amazing fortitude,
that she had weighed every thing
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
very maturely, and was tho∣roughly
convinced she should ne∣ver
repent. Lady <HI>Douglas</HI> pro∣mised
to use her influence with
her lord, to engage his approba∣tion.</P>
<P>SHE did not delay a moment
to acquaint him with <HI>Julia's</HI> pe∣tition;
I accuse myself for be∣lieving
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and <HI>Julia</HI> are
in love with each other. The
poor child is far gone in another
passion;—she has a mind to be
a nun! and I come to con∣sult
with you, my lord, how we
are to act on this occasion? she
requests, that one of us would
fix her in a convent in <HI>France.—</HI>
I don't see, said the earl, we have
any right to refuse her this sa∣tisfaction!
but if she continues to
desire it, you madam, are the
most proper person to accompany
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
her. But one step is necessary
before all others, and that is, to
inform her who she is, as the
countess of <HI>Warwick</HI> recom∣mended
to us; and the confessor
whom she entrusted with deliver∣ing
her into your hands, is yet
alive, to attest it. Lady <HI>Doug∣las</HI>
very much approved the
thought, and reflecting on the
uneasy situation in which she
had left <HI>Julia,</HI> immediately
sent for her. My dear child,
said she, your father and I have
no other views than to render
you happy—he consents to what
you think will make you so;
and has appointed me to conduct
you to <HI>France;</HI> though with a
sensible concern to us both, that
we must be separated. <HI>Julia</HI>
expressed her gratitude in the most
affectionate terms, and after re∣turning
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
her most humble thanks
to the countess, withdrew.</P>
<P>ON returning to her chamber,
she was told by <HI>Lucilla</HI> that <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
wanted to speak to her in
his dressing-room. He is so al∣tered
added she, that I am very
much concerned to see him.—
My dear sister you are his con∣fident,
—pray omit nothing to
console him, for he seems to me
in deep affliction! <HI>Julia,</HI> ex∣tremely
affected with the scene
that had passed with her mother,
and still more with what she heard
from <HI>Lucilla,</HI> hastened to the
dressing-room, where she found
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> on a sopha, his face
covered with a handkerchief; at
her appearance he endeavoured
to rise, but his strength failed,
and he fell back on the sopha,—
<HI>Julia</HI> advanced, and taking one
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
of his hands, which she clasped
in her's, looked at him for some
time with eyes swimming in
tears. Brother, said she, when
able to speak, the situation I see
you in, penetrates my heart,—I
am already sufficiently wretched,
without your adding new afflic∣tions
to those I suffer. Alas!
how changed is your counte∣nance!
you are dying of grief,
whilst I wish you to live.—I in∣treat
you in the name of.—
Ah! my dear sister, interrupted
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> do not exert the em∣pire
you have over me by insist∣ing
on the preservation of a
wretched being—rather think
fate has decreed I must love you
for ever, and that I dare not op∣pose
its will.—That I am to
see you no more, and that it will
be criminal to endeavour to see
you.—Reflect on the horror
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
that threatens me; and suffer me
to take shelter in the grave,—
it is the only resource I have
left,—and the only one I wish to
find! My dear broth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, said
<HI>Julia,</HI> reason will recall you to
your duty;—time and necessity
will teach you to forget me.—
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> letting his head re∣cline
upon his breast, and with∣drawing
the hand <HI>Julia</HI> yet held,
did not answer a word.</P>
<P>SHE waited some time, and
finding this mournful silence still
continue, you are then determin∣ed
my <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> to indulge this
despair? you will not even speak
to me! Can you think me un∣worthy
of commiseration? can
you think me insensible to the
sacrifice I make? (He remained
silent, without lifting up his eyes)
—You are resolved to die my
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
dear <HI>Hyppolitus?</HI>—let it be so!—
let us die together,—I will no
longer oppose it;—but your
death must be speedy indeed if
it precedes mine! Ah! my adored
sister, he exclaimed, heaving a
deep sigh, allow me to be the
only victim!—You have, believe
me, granted enough to duty:
live my amiable <HI>Julia!</HI> why
should you wish to die?—And
may I not return the question?
—cruel <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> is it not
your obstinacy that kills me?
said she with indignation. <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
could not bear this re∣proach:
—he suddenly threw him∣self
at her feet, and kissing her
fair hand, at last said—be ap∣peased,
my dearest sister, I from
this moment resolve to pay an
implicit obedience to your will,
—and to convince you of it, I
will now take some nourishment,
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
for I had sworn to abstain from
food!—but promise to resign my∣self
to your disposal.<HI>—Julia,</HI> ex∣tremely
alarmed, called <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
and begged her to get something
for her brother to eat.—She would
have flown herself with eager∣ness
to supply him, but was in
too great disorder to be seen by
the family.</P>
<P>SHE repeated to <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> the
conversation she had had with her
mother,—the promise to carry
her to <HI>France,</HI> and the necessary
preparations making for the
voyage.—Though <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
eat very moderately, yet even
this caution did not prevent his
being seized with a violent fever,
of which he felt the first attack,
the evening of this distressful
day. <HI>Julia</HI> felt the keenest af∣fliction
in the miserable state she
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
was in, she failed not to give him
the most assiduous attendance;
and her eyes more then her words,
expressed to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> how
much she was interested in his
recovery;—but what at ano∣ther
time would have given him
the greatest consolation, only
served now, as fuel to his sor∣row,
—he would almost have
preferred the aversion of <HI>Julia</HI> to
the tenderness she discovered,
and the virtuous girl was torn
with the same conflicting senti∣ments.</P>
<P>THE report was soon propa∣gated
that <HI>Julia</HI> had determined
to be a recluse. Those to whom
she was the most indifferent, re∣gretted
it; and could not forbear
testifying their amazement that a
beauty so accomplished in mind
and person, should devote her∣self
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
to a convent! But amongst
those who lamented it most, was
the earl of <HI>Bedford.</HI> He waited
upon the earl of <HI>Douglas</HI> in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
where his family was, and
assured him the passion he had
for <HI>Julia</HI> was so ardent, and at
the same time so disinterested,
that if he would bestow on him
so precious a gift, he desired no
farther advantages,—that her
birth and his fortune united, were
sufficient to make <HI>Julia</HI> happy;
—that all his desires centred
in the felicity of her he adored,
and that he must be the most mi∣serable
of mankind without her.
My lord, replied to his com∣pliment
with all the politeness it
demanded; and then told him
he should reproach himself, was
he to deprive his daughter of the
liberty of her choice <HI>of life;</HI>
that though a monastery was
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
what he had a peculiar dislike to,
—yet he did not think he had a
right to oppose her inclination;
that his lordship could be no
stranger to the esteem and con∣sideration
he had for his person,
as well as for the house of which
Lady <HI>Douglas</HI> was a descendant;
that if he was able to transfer
his regard to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> his eldest
daughter, whose fortune was
more considerable, he should
think himself happy in the alli∣ance.
The earl thanked him as
much as grief would give him
leave, and retired very much mor∣tified
with the disappointment.
In the mean time Lady <HI>Douglas</HI>
had bought <HI>Julia</HI> every thing
necessary for her new vocation,
and acquainted her she might
take leave of her friends, as she
intended to be ready to sail
to <HI>France</HI> in two days.—
Whatever fortitude <HI>Julia</HI> had
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
collected it failed her in this ex∣tremity:
—she went to her bro∣thers
appartment,—her heart
ready to burst,—and tears in her
eyes;—he was gone to bed;—
she desired his servant to leave
the room, and when they were
alone sat down by the bed-side,
beholding him with a look where
sorrow was strongly painted, I
am come at last, said she, my
dear brother, I am come at last
to bid you an eternal farewell!
O fatal sound! an eternal farewell,
is that possible? She was silent, her
voice was stifled with sighs.—
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> crossing his arms,
and lifting his eyes towards <HI>Hea∣ven,</HI>
answered in a tone scarcely
articulated,—Alas! my <HI>Julia,</HI>
the moment is then arrived when
we must part! that moment so
terrible to my imagination!—
reason forbids me to persuade
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
you from a design which is the
source of all the misfortunes of
my life;—nay, I will, if it be
possible, conceal from your ob∣servation
the anguish in which
you leave me, lest pity should
subdue your fortitude.—Yes,
my dear sister, we must part,—
<HI>Heaven</HI> has decreed it.—Ah!
<HI>Julia! Julia!</HI> why am I your
brother? turning a side to con∣ceal
the tears that streamed from
his eyes, but <HI>Julia</HI> unwilling to
lose these marks of his tender∣ness,
begged him to look upon
her! Ah! do not envy me my
dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> said the affected
fairone, the only consolation that
is left? let me behold your sorrow,
—it cannot encrease mine,—
but my heart tells me will rather
sooth its violence.—O, cruel
virtue!—austere duty!—ten∣der
sensibility,—O, thou, who
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
hast filled that heart with senti∣ment,
it must not, dare not ac∣knowledge!
receive the sacri∣fice
I make of passion and liber∣ty!
I am going to immure
myself for the remainder of a
wretched life;—will not that
attone for self-reproach? After
thus giving vent to the excess of
her grief, she endeavoured to
rise, but her strength, at that
moment failing, she turned pale,
a sudden chillness seized her,—
she sunk down on a chair.—
What was the situation of <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
at this sight?—but she
soon recovered from her faint∣ing,
and casting an agonizing
look on the object of her woe,—
adieu! dear <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> adieu!
I have loved too much for your
repose and mine;—adieu! my
dearest sister, said he, embracing,
and moistening her face with his
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
tears:—you leave me the most
unfortunate and wretched of all
human beings;—death is my
only hope.—<HI>Julia</HI> hastened to
her chamber, and threw herself
on the bed.</P>
<P>GRACIOUS <HI>Heaven!</HI> what a
night to both! what a separation!
what violence to hearts so at∣tached!
yet elevated and pure,
their sentiments were incapable
of transgressing the laws that
duty required and enjoined.</P>
<P>JULIA, fatigued with having
passed the night in tears and
groans, was just fallen asleep
when her maid came to tell her
the countess wanted to speak
with her. She immediately rose,
and found her in her dressing-room
with the earl and a priest;
—the countess desired her to shut
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
the door, and sit down: my dear
child, continued she, we have a
circumstance to acquaint you
with that will greatly surprize
you,—“In regard to parental
love and tenderness, <HI>Julia,</HI> you
have had reason to believe your∣self
our daughter, but it becomes
necessary to reveal a secret that
regards you very essentially:—
you are no farther allied to us,
than by consanguinity between
your mother and us, who was of
the family of <HI>Montgomery.</HI> This
is <HI>her</HI> picture,—and this is that
of your father, <HI>Roger,</HI> earl of
<HI>Warwick,</HI> son to the earl of <HI>Sa∣lisbury.</HI>
There are likewise, six
thousand pounds in jewels, which
your excellent mother left in our
hands for you;—and Mr. <HI>Eaton,</HI>
who was her confessor, and with
her in her last hour, is the per∣son
she intrusted to deliver you
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
into our hands. It is now above
thirteen years.—At the time
when King <HI>Henry,</HI> infatuated
with a passion for <HI>Anne Boleyne,</HI>
threw off the papal supremacy;
he afterwards condemned to lose
her head, so great was his levi∣ty,
and inconstancy to those he
had loved the most.”</P>
<P>THE countess then related the
particulars of the death of the
earl and countess of <HI>Warwick,</HI>
and the motives that induced the
latter to request <HI>Julia</HI> might
pass for her daughter. Had you
been indeed our own (my dear
child I must and ought ever to call
you so) we could not have loved
you more:—keep this secret, and
take care of not communicating
it to any person. You see that
under the young King <HI>Edward,</HI>
the <HI>Catholicks</HI> have more to fear
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
than ever;—your own interest, as
well as the honour due to the me∣mory
of your noble parents, is
a tye upon your religious senti∣ments.</P>
<P>JULIA,—disordered,—alarm∣ed,
—transported with a joy she
strove to repress, falling at the
feet of the countess, tenderly
pressed her hands: “Madam,
said she, the obligations I owe
you are so much the more bind∣ing,
as I am not your daughter!
Had I been entitled to that ho∣nour,
nature might have prompt∣ed
you to give me the education
I have received; but thus cir∣cumstanced,
generosity alone
could engage you to bestow it.
Yet by this discovery, I lose all I
valued most, in being deprived
of appertaining to you,—you
cease to be my mother. Alas!
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
I have no one now to be∣stow
that fond appellation upon!
<HI>God</HI> forbid, said the earl, who
had been hitherto silent, <HI>God</HI> for∣bid
we should ever cease to be
your parents!—You will al∣ways
possess that place in our
hearts which your merit has se∣cured,
—and you ought my dear
<HI>Julia,</HI> always to regard this house
as your paternal one.—<HI>Julia</HI>
thanked him in the most grateful
terms, for this fresh proof of his
friendship.—All the wonders
she had heard were confirmed by
Mr. <HI>Eaton,</HI> who could not re∣strain
his tears in beholding <HI>Ju∣lia,</HI>
the exact resemblance of her
mother. In reality, she herself
was so struck with this resem∣blance,
when Lady <HI>Douglas</HI> pre∣sented
the picture, that she could
not forbear fancying they had
stole her likeness, unknown to
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
her. The earl desired <HI>Julia</HI> to
take the casket into her own ap∣partment,
which she declined,
begging they would keep it; he
told her as the jewels were her
own property, it was reasonable
she should wear them, but added
he, my dear daughter, it can
only be for a short time, since
we are to separate to-morrow,—
and you will soon assume a dress
very opposite to magnificence.—
<HI>Julia</HI> blushed at these words and,
retired in silence.</P>
<P>SHE flew into her closet, and
finding herself at liberty, gave
way to the pleasing emotions of
her joy;—my <HI>God!</HI> cryed she,
am I not the sister of <HI>Hyppolitus?
Heaven</HI> has wrought this miracle
to save me from impending ruin!
—O what a wretch had I
been if this discovery had been
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
made a little later? when an ir∣revocable
vow had robbed me for
ever of the hope of uniting our
destiny! How me heart re∣proaches
me for concealing it a
moment from my <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI>
I know a thing in which he is sen∣sibly
interested, and I delay the
communication! She ran to find
him, her eyes darting their
brightest lustre,—all animati∣on
and rapture;—whoever had
seen her two hours before, could
not have known her:—she en∣treated
<HI>Lucilla</HI> to accompany her
to pay a visit to <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> whom
they found so pale, dejected, and
languid, from the effects of the
fever, he could scarcely speak.
They enquired how he did? he
replied in a faint tone, very ill
indeed! looking with astonish∣ment,
as well as vexation, on
that appearance of gaiety, which
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
<HI>Julia</HI> was incapable of conceal∣ing;
for you, sister, it is unne∣cessary
to ask if you are in health▪
your countenance is a sufficient
indication;—your eyes denote
the most perfect satisfaction!—
I never had so much reason to in∣dulge
it, said <HI>Julia,</HI> smiling.—
What! you are going to leave
us for ever, and that is a subject
of peculiar felicity! yet, for pi∣ty's
sake, have at least the com∣plaisance
to restrain these emo∣tions
of joy, and do not insult
<HI>Lucilla's</HI> sorrow and mine;—
alas, you will depart but too
soon;—you will not be long
persecuted with our importunate
tenderness;—tomorrow is, I
think, the fatal day we must bid
one another an eternal adieu!</P>
<P>LUCILLA, observing <HI>Julia</HI>
made no reply, and seemed to
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
express, by a look of signifi∣cance,
she had something to say
to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> opened a window,
and leaning out, left them free
liberty of conversation. <HI>Julia,</HI>
fixing her eyes on <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
who appeared in the utmost dis∣composure
at her unexpected
chearfulness, what delightful
news have I to tell you, said
she, you will want faith to be∣lieve
its reality, it has so much
the air of a fictitious history. I
shall never doubt the truth of
any thing my <HI>Julia</HI> asserts, (replied
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> with impatience)—
but, my dear sister, what tale
can be pleasing to him whose
misfortunes are not in the power
of fate to remedy? Were I to
tell you I am not your sister,
would that afford you any satis∣faction?
He was silent, raising
his eyes to <HI>Heaven,</HI> with a look
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
that implied his incredulity.
<HI>Julia</HI> continued. I accuse my∣self
for suffering you to languish
thus, whilst I have it in my
power to relieve you. Know
then, my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> you
are not my brother! She then
gave a short detail of all she had
learned, and shewed him the
miniature and jewels.—Ima∣gination
cannot paint what pas∣sed
in the heart of <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>—
At first, excess of joy deprived
him of speech.—His eyes
alone, spoke the various emo∣tions
with which his soul was
agitated.—He held her hand,
which he pressed with extasy;
and remained a long time, as it
were entranced. At length, like
one who had passed from death to
life—Oh! my charming <HI>Julia,</HI>
he exclaimed, do not flatter my
grief! Can what I hear be pos∣sible?
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
Yet, how still more in∣credible
to believe, that eyes so
beautiful could kindle a criminal
flame! What exquisite plea∣sure
to abandon ones self to all
the transporting movements the
most ardent and respectful pas∣sion
can inspire! Yet, say you par∣ticipate
in my happiness! Thou
angel of my soul! say you are
touched with it! Ah! can you
doubt it my dear <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI>
You are too well acquainted with
the secrets of my heart to be ig∣norant
of the effect this miracu∣lous
turn of fortune has produced.
But, allow me to confess that
my joy is incomplete;—you
have long been destined for the
heiress of <HI>Argyle.</HI>—Our ine∣quality
in fortune! Alas! after
escaping dangerous rocks and
quicksands, we shall perish in
the port.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78"/>
NO <HI>Julia,</HI> said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> it
would be an indignity to fortune
to distrust her after what she has
done in my favour. The road
to happiness is open before us,
provided you, my dear <HI>Julia,</HI>
will act in concert with fortune?
And yet, brother (don't fancy I
will drop the appellation at once?)
what must be done to stop this
horrid voyage which is fixed for
to-morrow? consider every thing
is prepared, and think of my
perplexity! Illness, seems your
only plea, my <HI>Julia,</HI> the conse∣quence
of your surprize at being
informed of these extraordinary
events in which you are so deeply
interested. This might be a plau∣sible
pretext for a few days, but
my naturally healthy complexion,
will betray me; there is an ap∣parent
difference between the re∣ality
and affectation of sickness,
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
and I know not how to counter∣feit.
Let us begin by this me∣thod,
said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and we
shall have time to contrive some
other.</P>
<P>HERE <HI>Lucilla</HI> interrupted
them.—Pray good people, said
she, with a lively air, have a lit∣tle
consideration for me! do you
suppose it a very entertaining a∣musement
to divert my eyes with
the passengers in the street for
two hours? I am only too com∣plaisant
to you both! Ah <HI>Lucil∣la!</HI>
said <HI>Julia,</HI> taking her hand,
if you could keep the secret, how
pleased should I be to repay your
obliging behaviour, with the
strongest mark of confidence!
If I could keep the secret! re∣peated
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> with a smile,
you treat your eldest sister, abo∣minably;—a
little more re∣spect,
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
<HI>Julia,</HI> or I shall demand
justice of my brother.—The
judge is already inclined to pass
sentence against you, said <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
obliging her to sit by
him, I have no will but <HI>Julia's;</HI>
—where can I expect to find
an advocate then? I will plead
your cause against myself, re∣sumed
<HI>Julia,</HI> for presuming to
distrust your fidelity,—and for
the future will conceal nothing
from you. She then related her
story with the utmost frankness,
and whilst her penetration dis∣cerned
the advantage it would be
to engage <HI>Lucilla</HI> in their interest,
received on this occasion the
warmest professions of friend∣ship
from her amiable sister.—
When the first moments of sur∣prize
were over, the reflection
she was no more to call her by
that name, occasioned a burst of
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
tears.—Alas! said she, now
the tye of consanguinity is broke,
what reason have I to fear you
will deprive me of your affec∣tion
to place it on some more
worthy object? And in what
part of the world, my <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
said <HI>Julia,</HI> pressing her to her
heart, can I find that more wor∣thy
object?—I am well con∣vinced
it would be a vain pursuit.
—Forbear to suspect me of the
weakness of altering the senti∣ments
I feel for you.—No, my
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> be assured you will ever
be unrivalled in my friendship; I
have just given you an incontes∣tible
proof,—but I think it
time for us to retire, for fear of
being seen;—you know enough
of our present designs.—Adieu
<HI>Hyppolitus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82"/>
THE ladies instantly retired,
leaving him the most happy man
alive; so transported with the
great event, that his fever, which
anxiety had occasioned, needed
no other medicine than his pre∣sent
joy, and, notwithstanding
his extreme weakness, he left
his bed, much about the same
time <HI>Julia</HI> retired to her's, in pro∣secution
of the scheme they had
formed; she darkened the win∣dows
of her chamber, and entreat∣ed
<HI>Lucilla</HI> to assist in deceiving the
earl and countess in regard to her
illness, which was not very dif∣ficult
to accomplish. The phy∣sicians
not perceiving any fever,
and observing her countenance
indicated perfect health, were
at a loss what to prescribe;
<HI>Julia</HI> complained of excessive
pain in her head, and groaned
lamentably, whilst <HI>Lucilla</HI> asserted
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
her sister suffered so much all the
night, she was not able to close
her eyes. No person doubted
the truth, and the doctors at last
declared it necessary for their
patient to change the air, which
occasioned her immediate remo∣val
to <HI>Buckingham.</HI></P>
<P>THE happy <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> now
tasted that unreproved pleasure
which had been hitherto a stranger
to his heart; he abandoned it to
the refinements of the most tender
and delicate passion:—he did
not lose a moment in absence
from his belov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d mistress. As
the family were alarmed at her
sickness, and wished to facilitate
her recovery, they were industri∣ous
in studying to divert her,
which furnished <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> with
free liberty to converse with her
at all hours of the day.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84"/>
THE earl and countess were
under no apprehensions from
this intimacy, because they be∣lieved
her still determined to em∣brace
a religious life, and that
she only waited the return of
health to set out for <HI>France.</HI>
The earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> flattering
his hopes that by continual assi∣duities
he might prevail on <HI>Julia</HI>
to alter her resolution, made fre∣quent
visits at <HI>Buckingham,</HI> ne∣glecting
nothing he thought ca∣pable
of exciting her compassion;
but she treated him with such
cool indifference, as left him lit∣tle
reason to expect success; yet
the tender <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> could not
for bear expressing his apprehen∣sions
one day when he found her
walking alone in the little wood.
Introducing a conversation of the
earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> I know he ad∣dores
you, said he, that he glo∣ries
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
in being your captive, and
makes no secret to the world of
the honour he aspires to. I can∣not
be a witness to his intentions
without suffering great perturba∣tion;
—were you acquainted with
the chagrine attached to this
imaginary pretension, said <HI>Julia,</HI>
smiling, you would pity him: I
behave to him in a manner that
must soon disgust the most con∣stant
perseverance.</P>
<P>THEY continued walking, till
coming to the entrance of the
grotto, <HI>Julia,</HI> finding herself ra∣ther
weary, went into rest a few
minutes. Lady <HI>Douglas,</HI> who
had thought of some little em∣bellishments
that might add to
its beauty, had entered the grotto
by a different path, to consider
of them on the spot; seeing her
children earnest in discourse, her
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
curiosity was awakened to listen
to their conversation:—her mind
began to harbour some suspicions
that <HI>Julia</HI>'s disorder was feigned;
and she even feared <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
might be the cause of the objec∣tions
raised to her departure.—
She concealed herself behind
one of the niches in an obscure
corner of the grotto.</P>
<P>JULIA, sat down on a green
bank, and <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was going
to kneel at her feet, when she
cried out, I must not suffer you
to take that uneasy attitude, sit
here <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI> Ah charming
<HI>Julia,</HI> said he, have you forgot
that this is the very spot where
you preserved my life? must I
not kneel in testimony of my
gratitude? Alas! what a dread∣ful
hour do you call to my re∣membrance!
I ought never in∣indeed
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
to forget it.—I ought
much more than you to preserve
the memory of it, interrupted
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> for that moment so
sad in your account of time, was
charming in mine: it was then
I drew a confession from that
lovely mouth, you was not in∣sensible
to my ardour!—O, could
I find words to express the ef∣fect
that sweet confession pro∣duced
in my soul!—the wildness
of my despair, when I consider∣ed
myself your brother, and could
receive no advantage from a ten∣derness
on which my life depend∣ed!
—You would be more
strongly convinced of the excess
of the passion you inspired.
—Ah! my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> said
she, in a languishing voice, be
satisfied with the sentiments I
have in your favour, they are
such as I ought to wish less ser∣vent,
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
but my heart will not lis∣ten
to the remonstrances of rea∣son;
—and I dread some conse∣quences
fatal to our tenderness
were your relations to discover
it.—Relations who have des∣tined
you to your cousin, they
would certainly tear me from
your sight, and perhaps <HI>Hyppoli∣tus.</HI>
—Alas! perhaps your <HI>Julia</HI>
might never see you more!—
O my soul's comfort, said he,
forbear to disturb the sweetness
I now enjoy, with these alarming
predictions. Be persuaded I
will cease to live rather than cease
to be yours:—no power on earth
can force me to disavow these
sentiments. I am too well con∣vinced
of your constancy to
doubt any thing you say, resumed
<HI>Julia,</HI> but if your family should
insist upon my going to <HI>France,</HI>
and force me to take the veil,
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
what are we then to do?—Every
thing, said <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> with emo∣tion,
rather than submit to in∣justice!
—There are no extreme∣ties
I would not hazard.—What!
tamely see you sacrificed to the
misfortunes of your house, un∣der
the mean pretext that fortune
has refused her favours, when
<HI>Heaven</HI> has graced you with
every beauty, every virtue, that
can adorn its most perfect work!
to suffer you from so detestible a
motive, to be entombed in a con∣vent
abhorrent to your own
inclinations, and my peace?
No, rather may that <HI>Hea∣ven—</HI>
raising his voice with
indignation, and stepping for∣ward,
when perceiving the coun∣tess,
Good <HI>God!</HI> he exclaimed
aloud; <HI>Julia</HI> saw her at the
same instant, and they stood pe∣trified
with astonishment.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90"/>
LADY <HI>Douglas,</HI> who had no
longer any measures to keep, ad∣vanced
from the place of con∣cealment,
and looking on both
with eyes sparkling with rage,
I could not have thought <HI>Julia,</HI>
a girl of superior rank would so
indelicately have disposed of her
heart without the consent of those
on whom she depended! And
as for you, <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who are
well informed of our views for
your establishment, and have
rashly dared to form an attach∣ment
at the very instant every
thing is concluded for a marriage
with the heiress of <HI>Argyle!</HI> Say∣ing
this, she walked hastily a∣way,
without waiting a reply.</P>
<P>WHO can represent the situa∣tion
of the two lovers? never
had they experienced a more un∣fortunate
incident. <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
tenderly approaching his <HI>Julia,</HI>
she leaned upon his shoulder
weeping: what will be our fate?
Alas <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> how terrible
is the tempest breaking over our
heads! all I foresee terrifies and
distracts me! Ah! why did
they not suffer me to continue in
my error?—I should have been
now in happy ignorance, se∣eluded
from the world! O do
not regret the ray of bliss they
have bestowed.—My dearest
angel, our misfortunes are greatly
magnified by your fears! a small
exertion of fortitude will extri∣tricate
us from these difficulties,
and deliver us from the persecu∣tion
they threaten. <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
said she, I want neither reso∣lution
nor constancy, but my
duty is yet dearer to me than
my love,—be assured the latter
will never be listened to when
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
the former speaks. And who,
my charmer, requires any thing
of you incompatible with duty?
can there exist a passion more
pure and respectful than mine?
Be not alarmed with imaginary
fears, at a time when mutual af∣fection
is necessary to support us
against the <HI>opposition preparing.</HI>
Kissing her fair hand, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
discovered by sighs, and emoti∣ons
of tenderness and distress,
the tumult that raged in his soul.
It was already late.—Time, is
easily forgot in the society of
those we love: in <HI>Cupid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> dial,
hours are but minutes. They
sound it necessary to part, after
repeated protestations of eternal
constancy.</P>
<P>JULIA now thought herself
at liberty to indulge her reflec∣tions
at leisure, on the unlucky
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
adventure of the day, and her
future conduct to Lady <HI>Douglas:</HI>
she had no sooner retired to her
closet, than one of her women
came to acquaint her, her lady∣ship
desired to speak with her.—
At this message she turned pale,
and trembled as at the summons
of death. She found the earl
and countess with a very different
aspect from what they had ever re∣garded
her with:—<HI>Julia,</HI> said the
countess, your sentiments are so
opposite to that affection I flat∣tered
myself to have found in you,
I can no longer bestow the fond
appellation of daughter. Can
it be possible, that in return for
protecting and educating you as
our own child, you should be so
destitute of gratitude as to wish
to ruin the fortune of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
and tempt his heart to revolt a∣gainst
the obedience due to his
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
father and me? to kindle a pas∣sion,
you must be sensible, would
incur our displeasure! to deceive
us with a false pretence of re∣ligious
retirement, when you
was pursuing a plan to injure
your benefactors! Are those prin∣ciples
of rectitude and sincerity
we remarked and admired in
you, totally eradicated? or were
they only the shadow of virtues
you never possessed?</P>
<P>THESE reproaches penetrated
the heart of the fair <HI>Julia</HI> with
the most lively grief;—she was
so sensible of the remotest obli∣gations
of veracity and duty, that
she considered it as the greatest
outrage to her delicacy to be ac∣cused
of the breach of either.
The blush of modesty glowed
upon her cheek, which resent∣ment
of this severe reprimand
soon heightened to a deeper crim∣son.
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
Her downcast eyes were
for some moments fixed on the
ground, when suddenly raising
them towards the countess, she
answered with bashful, yet no∣ble
dignity: I can with truth as∣sure
you madam, ingratitude is
a vice I am unacquainted with;
and that the obligations I owe
you are deeply imprinted in my
memory, and on my heart. I
will even confess these sentiments
I have for <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> betrayed
that unsuspecting heart. I be∣lieved
I only loved him as a bro∣ther,
and I am incapable of deny∣ing
madam, what you already
know, that a too tender regard
made a more rapid progress, than
I would have suffered had it been
in my power to have foreseen it.
But I was conscious of the evil
when it was too late to seek a
remedy.—I saw <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> in the
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
same situation; he protested with
so much earnestness, his life de∣pended
on my resolve, that my
own frailty seconded by the singu∣lar
motives which interested me in
his happiness, rendered me un∣able
to refuse him some marks of
sensibility; and if any thing for∣tified
me in the indulgence I
have shewn to his attachment
and my own, it has been the
consideration of not being alto∣gether
unworthy your alliance.
It is true, madam, my fortune
is contracted, but immoderate
wealth does not always decide
the happiness of our lives; and
I have been taught to believe an
union of hearts is a more indis∣pensible
ingredient. I have the
honor of being allied to your
family as well as the daughter
of the earl of <HI>Argyl,</HI> whom you
had destined for the wife of <HI>Hyp∣politus;</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
and, do you think madam,
interrupted Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI> be∣cause
my son and you have given
way to mutual passion, it is a
sufficient reason for expecting
we should approve the connec∣tion?
and that we must necessa∣rily
coincide with your scheme
of happiness? But you have
paid too great a compliment to
the propriety of your sentiments!
and for the future, I must beg
you to consult your own satisfac∣tion
independently of mine, as
your choice is circumscribed ei∣ther
to marry the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI>
or retire to a convent;—there is
no medium between these two
propositions, examine which of
them is most agreeable, and let
us know your determination to-morrow.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98"/>
JULIA, shocked with so harsh
a sentence, withdrew; her heart
so oppressed with grief, that on
entering her chamber, where
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> expected her with im∣patience,
she sunk down in a
swoon,—<HI>Lucilla</HI> ran to her as∣sistance.
whilst <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was in
such an agony of distress, he
wanted it almost as much as his
dear <HI>Julia;</HI> it was a long time
before either were in spirits for
a recital of this dreadful con∣versation.</P>
<P>IT was now their eyes were
opened to the misfortunes pre∣pared
for them. Just <HI>Heaven!</HI>
cried <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> mournfully,
was I too much elated with my
happiness, that I must now see
the destruction of all my hopes?
but, continued he, what am I
saying,—my dearest <HI>Julia!</HI> if
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
your affection is unshaken, who
can separate our hearts? Be∣lieve
me, <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> said she,
looking tenderly upon him, that
nothing but death alone can se∣parate
them! I have taken my
resolution, and I promise you
never to change it. Not that I
am ignorant of what I have to
encounter: but misery itself will
be dear to me, if it is instru∣mental
in preserving your <HI>Julia</HI>
ever yours! Her faithful lover,
softened with gratitude and love,
said all that the most tender and
constant heart could dictate in
this trying circumstance. Both
were greatly embarrassed in con∣certing
a proper answer for
<HI>Julia</HI> the next day; at length
they agreed she should request
to stay longer at <HI>Bucking∣ham,</HI>
and if that was refused,
should give the preference to a
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
convent, where <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> would
find means to visit her. That
on no account should she listen
to any proposals from the earl of
<HI>Bedford,</HI> but refuse him in so ab∣solute
a manner, as to check all
future solicitations.</P>
<P>WHILST the lovers were thus
settling their plan, the earl and
countess of <HI>Douglas,</HI> were con∣sidering
how to prevent the con∣sequences
that were to be appre∣hended
from the violence of their
son's passion for <HI>Julia.</HI> Should
we carry her to <HI>France,</HI> said they,
he will undoubtedly pursue her;
love is naturally ingenious, and
the invention of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> will
not fail to inspire him with some
stratagem to see her;—nor can
we oblige her to take the veil
contrary to her inclination! The
most rational expedient is to re∣move
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> under pretence
of travelling: he may, perhaps,
by a long absence, forg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Julia:</HI>
she may possibly follow his ex∣ample;
and if the earl of <HI>Bed∣ford</HI>
perseveres, be prevailed upon,
in time, to marry him.</P>
<P>DETERMINED upon this me∣thod,
as most suitable to their
views, they sent <HI>Julia</HI> word by
her friend <HI>Lucilla,</HI> they would
allow her more time to consider
their proposal. This news a∣wakened
a glimmering hope,—
that the earl might not be insen∣sible
to their affection, and would
yet consent to make them happy.
—<HI>Julia</HI> communicated it to
her lover, but he could not flat∣ter
her in her belief—Ah! my
<HI>Julia,</HI> said he, I too well know
the character of those who op∣pose
our satisfaction, to imagine
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
they will long suffer us to enjoy
this serenity. My soul is alarm∣ed
with I know not what pre∣sentiment
that interrupts its re∣pose.
<HI>Julia</HI> could only answer
with her tears, which <HI>Hyppoli∣tus</HI>
mingled with his own; and
their sorrow left such traces on
their countenance, that Lord
and Lady <HI>Douglas,</HI> began to
dread its effect on their son's con∣stitution.
This hastened the
preparations for <HI>Hyppolitus's</HI> de∣parture,
his equipage was or∣dered
with the utmost secrecy
and dispatch, and when all was
ready, they sancied he would re∣ceive
some pleasure from the
magnificence of his appearance
in foreign courts, and the ge∣nerous
appointment assigned him.</P>
<P>THEY sent for <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> into
their appartment, and the earl
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
addressed him thus—My son, if
your mother and I consulted only
our own satisfaction, it certainly
would be more agreeable to keep
you with us, than to send you
the tour of <HI>Europe;</HI> but you
are at an age when your educa∣tion
requires finishing in other
countries, rather than your own.
It is now necessary to study their
manners and customs, and to
acquirethateasy politeness which
is caught rather than learned
from the conversation of well
bred men; and can only be at∣tained
by travel. We are per∣suaded
you will have peculiar
pleasure in finding us second an
inclination so natural for youth to
entertain. Your rout is settled
through <HI>France, Italy, Germany</HI>
and <HI>Holland;</HI> and after three
years absence, we shall hope to
welcome you with transports of
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
joy.—<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> trembled at
these words. The stroke of a
poniard could not have wounded
him more keenly. He was unde∣termined
what to say; one mo∣ment
he resolved boldly to de∣clare
his passion for <HI>Julia,</HI> (of
which they were so well inform∣ed)
and to assure them no power
on earth should separate them,—
and that if they chose to send
him abroad, it must be after
they had secured to him the hand
of <HI>Julia.</HI>—The next he was
struck with apprehensions that
this temerity would only draw
fresh persecutions on that adora∣ble
maid, <HI>Julia,</HI> and perhaps
occasion her to be removed where
discovery might be impossible.
—The conflict in his soul is
not to be described; Lord and
Lady <HI>Doulas</HI> discovered part of
it by the emotion and disorder
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
of his countenance;—but they
persevered in dissimulation, and
seeming not to observe his anxie∣ty—pursued
the discourse by ac∣quainting
him their care had
furnished all things requisite, as
they wished him to take the op∣portunity
of returning with the
<HI>French</HI> ambassador, Monsieur de
<HI>Bois-Dauphin,</HI> who was the earl's
particular friend, so that he
would only have two days to
take leave of his friends. <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
concealing, as far as pos∣sible,
the anguish, he felt, coldly
replied, he should obey, but that
measures so precipitate, gave his
journey rather the appearance of
exile, than travel. He bowed,
and left the room.</P>
<P>A SUDDEN recollection pre∣vented
him from speaking im∣mediately
to <HI>Julia,</HI> though his
feet had mechanically led him to
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
her appartment. He thought it
above all things necessary he
should first see the friend of his
heart, the earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and
concert with him what conduct
it was best to pursue. He set
out immediately for <HI>London,</HI> not
doubting the earl would serve
him on this occasion with the
same secresy and generosity he
had experienced on so many o∣thers.
He followed him into
the park, and found him walk∣ing
with Lord <HI>Northampton,</HI>
and Lord <HI>Percy.</HI> After the usual
civilities, he whispered his friend,
he had something of importance
to communicate.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> excused
himself to the two noblemen,
promising to see them soon on
the affair they were talking upon,
when, addressing <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>—
you have done me a singular ser∣vice
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
in drawing me from the
conversation in which we were
engaged.—Things are in the
greatest confusion.—The king's
illness is thought desperate, and
in this extraordinary crisis, par∣ties
are forming for the succes∣sion.
—Those noblemen who left
us, were persuading me to em∣bark
with them in favour of La∣dy
<HI>Jane Grey,</HI> her youth and
beauty would easily determine
my heart to support her interest,
but, as she is only niece to <HI>Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI>
VIII. it appears to me, the Prin∣cess
<HI>Mary</HI> has a more legal right
to the crown; so that I could
not avoid differing from them in
sentiments, when you joined us.
He continued this political dis∣course
without observing his
friend hearkened with impa∣tience
and inattention.—They
They left the <HI>Mall,</HI> and entered
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
a close walk which led to the
<HI>Mews;</HI> now we are at liberty, my
dear friend, said the earl, em∣bracing
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> What is the
matter? tell me how I can serve
you? You may serve me in my
dearest interests, said he, which
you will be sensible of, when I
tell you the distress I am involved
in, by my father's severity, all
my reliance is on your friend∣ship.
—My dear <HI>Sussex,</HI> I am
on the brink of desperation.—
I must leave <HI>England</HI> to-morrow
with the <HI>French</HI> ambassador—I
must leave <HI>Julia!—</HI> her whom I
adore,—on whom the happiness
of my life depends.—You are
too well acquainted with my sen∣timents
to make it necessary for
me to enlarge on my sufferings;
—but whatever may be the con∣sequence,
I am determined only
to feign a departure.—I will
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
send my servants to your seat in
the country, if you will give me
leave, and will lodge secretly
with you, that I may lose no
possible opportunity of seeing my
beloved.</P>
<P>DISPOSE of every thing that
appertains to me, as if it was
your own, said the earl; but let
me observe it will be extremely
difficult to deceive my Lord <HI>Doug</HI>-for
any length of time? If we
can deceive him but for a day,
that day will be employed in ga∣zing
on <HI>Julia!</HI> say only whether
you will assist me? Whether I
will! said the earl; the doubt
offends me; I flattered myself
my friend was better acquainted
with my heart. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> pres∣sed
him to his bosom, begging
pardon for this transient mark of
distrust, and thanking him in
the tenderest manner,—he then
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
took the hasty leave of a lover,
impatient to see the mistress of
his soul; but the earl would ac∣company
him part of the way,
on horseback.—Alas! said he,
if three hours appear an insup∣portable
absence, what would
become of me in three years! It
would be impossible for me to
exist.—No, I must die!</P>
<P>THESE faithful friends did not
separate till within sight of the
castle, where <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> perceiv∣ed
<HI>Julia</HI> at her window, who
signed to him to approach.—
He flew thither.—Where can
you have been, brother? said
she;—you had a long conversa∣tion
with the earl and countess;
—you call for your horse, and
ride off without letting me know
a word of the matter.—Ah,
<HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> are these demon∣strations
of affection? had I been
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
in your place, I think I should
have acted otherwise!</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> could not
condemn his own behaviour,
and might easily have justified
himself to his fair accuser, yet
the slightest anxiety that <HI>Julia</HI>
suffered, was calculated to alarm
him:—he felt the severity of these
reproaches, and was incapable
of answering immediately.—
When he was a little recovered,
he replied in a respectful tone,
It is I, my amiable <HI>Julia,</HI> who
have cause to complain of your
unkind suspicion!—Could you
entertain the most distant idea I
was capable of forgetting you a
single moment? Could you con∣demn
me on such a slight ap∣pearance?
O <HI>Julia!</HI> you <HI>little
know the excess of my love,</HI> thus
to accuse me! <HI>Julia</HI> had too
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
much tenderness to delight in
seeing him uneasy.—I acknow∣ledge,
said she, there is a spe∣cies
of injustice in the pain I have
occasioned you: alas; we are
unfortunate enough, without in∣geniously
devising new subjects
of distress! Let this seal my
peace with my charming mis∣tress,
said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> kissing her
hand, it must be confessed our
misfortunes are too formidable,
without any addition. My fa∣ther
is sending me abroad: he
inflicts the severest punishment
in separating me from you,—but
I have just been taking measures
for concealment in <HI>London;—</HI>
we must now contrive a plan for
meeting unsuspectedly.</P>
<P>HE repeated all that had pas∣sed
with Lord <HI>Sussex,</HI> and after
proposing and rejecting several
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
methods, they consulted <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
to whom they had no reserve
come hither sister, said <HI>Julia,</HI>
we want your assistance:—Your
invention is more at liberty than
ours to think of some eligible
expedient. She then explained
their situation. <HI>Lucilla</HI> rumi∣nated
a few minutes, and then
asked <HI>Julia</HI> if she had forgot
that the private staircase from
their appartment into the garden,
opened into a covered walk, at
the end of which, by the side of
the wood, was a little door into
the field? that it was only get∣ting
another key made, and they
might venture down this stair∣case
at night, without being per∣ceived
by the family, and <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
might let himself in at
the door.—Nothing can be
better, imagined said he.—I con∣fess
it, said <HI>Julia,</HI> but will it not
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
be an infringment of delicacy if
I should consent?—I have no
longer the plea of affinity to ex∣cuse
me.—In admitting visits
by night, I cannot think it will
be quite consistent with the rules
of decorum. Are you in a si∣tuation,
interrupted <HI>Lucilla,</HI> to
be so scrupulously nice? My
brother, it is true, is not your
husband, but he hopes in time
to have that honour; and I pro∣mise
you not to desert you in
these interviews;—and though
I have every thing to dread from
the anger of my father and mo∣ther.
I will freely expose myself
to its rage, to demonstrate my
friendship for you.—And what
will be my fate! thou mistress
of it? What will become of
thy <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> whose only mo∣tive
for staying in <HI>England</HI> is to
be ble<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with the sight of thee
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
sometimes? To refuse your
consent is to command me to de∣part.
—Ah <HI>Julia!</HI> is it you that
will banish me? Alas! you too
well know the power you both
have over me.—Yet, consider
the danger we shall be exposed
to! The very apprehension ter∣rifies
me to death.—They o∣mitted
nothing to reassure her,
and that very evening <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
took the impression of the key in
wax, and dispatched it to the earl
of <HI>Sussex,</HI> that a new one might
be finished before he left <HI>Buck∣ingham.</HI>
All was punctually ex∣ecuted;
and the day <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
took leave of his family, Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> accompanied him to
<HI>London:</HI> he once intended see∣ing
him on board the yatch, but
changed his design, and was con∣tented
with beholding him and
his equipage safe in the barge,
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
which was to row them thither.
After the most tender farewell,
he returned extremely happy in
the flexibility of his son's tem∣per.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS was introduced
to the ambassador, who was al∣ready
on board. As this gentle∣man
had a great regard for him,
he frankly explained that some
invincible reasons made it ne∣cessary
he should stay in <HI>England;</HI>
he opened his heart to him, and
conjured him to pity his distress∣ed
situation; he hoped the con∣fidence
he reposed would make
the impression Mounsieur de
<HI>Bois-dauphine's</HI> benevolence gave
him reason to expect: and ob∣serving
in his manner and coun∣tenance,
the most favourable dis∣position
to oblige him, he at
length imparted his desire to
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
prevail on him to write to the
earl his father, that his son was
taken ill at <HI>Dieppe;</HI> rather than
at <HI>Paris,</HI> because it might natu∣rally
be expected that the ambas∣sador,
and such of the <HI>English</HI>
nobility as resided there, would
give frequent intelligence of the
progress of his distemper; would
he favour him with such a letter,
he would take care it was put in∣to
the post-office at a proper
time. He owned his life de∣pended
on the success of his plan.
I easily comprehend the motive
of your conduct, my dear <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
said the ambassador,
smiling, you are in love! and in
compliance to your passion, I am
to expose myself to your fathers
displeasure!—I have not for∣got
I was once young myself,—
and a secret impulse attaches me
more cordially to your interest
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
than to the earl's.—Let us lose
no time in writing this letter.—
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> was charmed with
his compliance,—and thanked
him a thousand times for a ser∣vice
which appeared so essential
to his happiness.—He received
it,—bid adieu to Monsieur de
<HI>Bois-dauphin,</HI> got into a sloop
as he had sent away the barge
directly, and landed at the <HI>Tower</HI>
wharf, where the earl of <HI>Sussex</HI>
waited in his coach: there were
horses ready to carry the servants
to his country seat, under the
care of a gentleman in whom the
earl could confide. As it was
already very late, the two friends
retired to the appartment assign∣ed
for <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> unseen by any
in the house.</P>
<P>THIS lover, whose imagina∣tion
was devoted to his <HI>Julia,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
was sensibly touched with the
most poignant grief, at the
thoughts of being no longer un∣der
the same roof with her. I
would converse with her every
moment, said he to the earl, who
passed the night with him, I
could go in to her chamber twenty
times o'day:—notwithstanding
my mother's injunctions, we
found means to see each other
whenever we pleased:—but now
we are nine miles distant, and
though the space is nothing to
indifferent travellers, yet it ap∣pears
immense to a man despe∣rately
in love as I am:—add to
this, the precautions to be observ∣ed:
the fear of discovery.—the
accidents that can neither be
foreseen nor avoided, which dis∣concert
the best-regulated plans.
—You are indeed one of <HI>Cu∣pid's</HI>
truest votaries, interrupted
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
the earl, pleasantly, the extra∣vagance
of your passion creates
all these false alarms that disturb
you without the least foundation.
Are you insensible to the satis∣faction
of being in <HI>London</HI> in∣stead
of being tossed upon the
ocean in a yatch; which would
have transported you by this time,
I know not how many leagues?
Do you regard as an immate∣rial
advantage the ready obedi∣ence
you have found in the ser∣vants
Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> appointed
to attend you? particularly from
the gentleman appointed your tu∣tor
whose age and occupation gave
him a kind of right to be sur∣prized
at your return, and to
enquire the cause? Yet he has
been the first to set an example
of submission to the rest! I as∣sure
you I regard with wonder
the peculiarity of your good
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
fortune, and am very little
disposed to lament your situ∣ation,
since <HI>Julia</HI> in permitting
your visits, favours you, in my
opinion, with the most valuable
proof of her esteem.</P>
<P>You would infer from all this,
said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> impatiently, that
I ought to be in the most perfect
harmony of spirits? Ah! my
dear lord, if your heart was sus∣ceptible
of the delicacy of a real
passion, you would enter more
deeply into my sentiments; but
you are quite a male-coquet,—
engage the admiration of every
pretty woman by the fine things
you say to her, whilst your heart
remains unwounded. I have
frequently lamented this in∣sensibility,
as I should have
done any disgrace that had be∣fallen
you. And I have as often
wished you as free as myself, my
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
dear <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> You are per∣suaded
the supreme happiness of
life consists in an immoderate de∣votion
to one object.—On the
contrary, believe it more likely
to be found in general gallantry.
—I own the ladies have a
right to our homage, and by a
thousand little delicate atten∣tions,
we may merit a share in
their favour;—but ought never
to engage in serious attachments
that interrupt our felicity.—and
make us neglect our duty and
our fortune. <HI>Caesar</HI> was the
slave of the fair sex in peace, but
indifferent to them in war! He
had a new mistress as often as he
conquered a new province!—
Love in heroes should be no
more than an amusement.—
A degree of it is, I confess, ne∣cessary,
for the attainment of
that politeness peculiar to the
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
conversation of well bred wo∣men;
—they soften the ferocity of
our natures, and it must be ac∣knowledged
understand the re∣finements
of manners and beha∣viour:
—but I will always main∣tain
that the most dangerous thing
in the world, is an intoxication,
which renders us incapable of
every other pursuit, than a∣doring
a beautiful idol!—Per∣sons
thus infatuated, become a
burthen to their acquaintance,
as well as to themselves. They
renounce all the pleasures of
society. They sigh,—weep,—
are always unhappy,—often jea∣lous,
and ill-humoured. The
purchase of one happy moment
is at the expence of a million of
miserable ones, that precede and
follow it:—moments so intolera∣ble,
they keep the soul in rest∣less
agitation:—in fire.—For
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
<HI>God's</HI> sake, interrupted <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
a truce with your moralising:—
it is so severe, and your taste so bar∣barous
and unpolished, that two
more such conversations would
render me your inveterate enemy.
—It is impossible to express
my indignation at your defini∣tion
of true lovers. The earl
laughed excessively, and pro∣mised
his friend not to vex his
spirits any more, on condition he
would allow <HI>him</HI> to love accord∣ing
to his own fashion, without
presuming to find fault with his
levity.</P>
<P>DAY began to peep before
they had settled preliminaries;
they did not rise till late, and
when dinner was over, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
entreated his friend to go to
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> and whisper his re∣quest
to <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> that
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
they would repair to the gate in
the wood: he performed his em∣bassy
to admiration, and as he
was always an agreeable guest to
Lord and Lady <HI>Douglas,</HI> they
were extremely delighted to see
him. You come very oppor∣tunely
said the countess, to con∣sole
me for my sons absence, I
am very sensibly affected with it.
—It is a voluntary affliction,
madam, you had the power and
influence of detaining him if
you had thought proper! I
understand you, says she: you
think us wrong in sending him
abroad, but I assure you, though
we suffer greatly from this sepa∣ration,
it was indispensibly ne∣cessary;
one ought to subdue all
selfish tenderness for the advan∣tage
of a darling son.—After
three years travel, we shall see
him with redoubled transport.—
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
<HI>Lucilla</HI> and <HI>Julia</HI> were present at
this conversation, and the earl
of <HI>Bedford</HI> making his appear∣ance,—Lord
<HI>Sussex,</HI> could
only draw <HI>Lucilla</HI> apart, whilst
the earl was engaged in addres∣sing
<HI>Julia.</HI> All that regarded
the time of meeting, was settled
for the ensuing night, and the
earl shortened his visit to gratify
his friend's impatience. They
thought it necessary to disguise
their persons for fear of being
discovered on the road in wigs
of an opposite colour to their hair;
jockey caps tied close over their
faces, and horsemens coats, ans∣wered
the purpose. They left
<HI>London</HI> at ten o' clock. The
night was remarkably fine;—the
country still and tranquil; their
valet held their horses, whilst
they repaired to the little gate,
which they found unlocked.—
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
They entered the garden;
and the two ladies, who were at
no great distance, hearing their
steps, advanced to meet them.</P>
<P>THE joy of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and
<HI>Julia</HI> was inexpressible; after
some time spent in general con∣versation,
without quitting the
walk, they divided into parties:
—the lover gave his hand to
<HI>Julia,</HI> and the earl walked by
<HI>Lucilla.</HI>—Thank <HI>Heaven,</HI> our ab∣sence
has not been long, my
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> said the lovely <HI>Julia.</HI>
—You are again returned in spite
of their machinations to disunite
us! Had my heart been slightly
engaged, my charming <HI>Julia,</HI> I
might have found it more dif∣ficult
to overset their schemes,
but the passion you have inspired
is too strong not to be fruitful in
devices to oppose whatever ob∣stacles
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
they may contrive to part
us. You were no sooner gone,
resumed <HI>Julia,</HI> than the countess
was particular in her civilities;
and after honouring me with
some professions of friendship,
which rather surprized me, as
we were circumstanced, said
she had reason to believe I had
no intention of taking the veil;
and, as that was the case, she
thought it incumbent on her to
advise me, as the best friend and
relation I had in the world, to
consider the earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI>
proposal divested of prejudice:
that he was a man of honour,
family, and fortune. She as∣sured
me in few words, a con∣nection
with you was absolutely
impossible: that she would free∣ly
confess, I was the only cause
of their sending you abroad, and
that her lord was resolved never to
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
consent to your return till I was
disposed of.—And what was
your reply, my dearest love? said
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> with emotion: that
as to accepting the earl of <HI>Bed∣ford's</HI>
addresses, my inflexibility
was equal to Lord <HI>Douglas's:</HI>
that I begged her ladyship never
would renew the subject, for no∣thing
could conquer my aversion:
and as you were to travel three
years, I had some reason to hope
she would give me longer time
to determine my choice of life:
that it was of great importance
to me, and therefore could not
be too maturely considered.</P>
<P>LADY <HI>Douglas</HI> did not refuse
her acquiescence in these senti∣ments;
and as the earl of <HI>Bed∣ford</HI>
came to-day, whilst my Lord
<HI>Sussex</HI> was here, and began to
pester me with his love, I told
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
him I could no longer conceal
that his importunities had ex∣hausted
my patience:—hitherto
I had treated him only with in∣difference,
but now the case was
extremely altered, and I thought
it just he should know my objec∣tions
were insurmountable: if
he wished to make me unhappy,
the repitition of his visits would
effectually answer that purpose.
What madam, he exclaimed, do
you forbid me to see you? Yes,
sir, I earnestly entreat you not to
interrupt my repose.—Madam,
you throw me into dispair, you
deprive me of the only felicity of
my life. I love you to adoration!
What must be my misery if you
refuse to let me see you? My
lord, you will endeavour to sub∣due
a partiality troublesome to
me, and the source of unneces∣sary
vexation to yourself. Say∣ing
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
this, I left him, with all the
marks of anguish in his counte∣nance.
—O, my heart's trea∣sure!
how happy do you make
me! and how immense is my
debt of gratitude for such a sa∣crifice!
said the enraptured <HI>Hyp∣politus.</HI>
You are mistaken, re∣plied
<HI>Julia,</HI>—I make no sacri∣fice.
—I feel too great satisfac∣tion
in venting my spleen upon
this impertinent man, for you to
place it to your account, or be
under the least obligation.</P>
<P>TIME glided away in recipro∣cal
protestations of eternal fide∣lity,
and promises to meet as fre∣quently
as possible. The earl of
<HI>Sussex's</HI> servant was to ride through
<HI>Buckingham</HI> every morning, and
when he saw flower pots at <HI>Julia's</HI>
window, it was to be a signal for
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> to repair to the wood
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
at night. These points being set∣tled,
they found it necessary to
separate, but not before Lord
<HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Lucilla</HI> had repeatedly
informed them it was near break
of day.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS was not tardy
in sending the ambassador's let∣ter
to his father, with an account
of his illness, which disturbed
the tranquillity of the family, and
filled the earl and countess with
alarming apprehensions.—He
constantly dated his own letters
from <HI>Dieppe,</HI> sometimes inform∣ing
them he was better,—some∣times
worse,—as he judged most
convenient.—The intercouse
between <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
was entirely unsuspected for more
than two months.—They en∣joyed
the pleasure of seeing each
other frequently without the least
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
interruption;—but fortune apt
to be envious of the too great
satisfaction of lovers, thought it
time to molest them.</P>
<P>WHEN the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> re∣ceived
his sentence of dismis∣sion,
he quitted the castle in the
most poignant distress, with a
resolution to decline his addres∣ses,
and if possible forget the fair
cause of his wretchedness for e∣ver.
He collected every argu∣ment
capable of affording him
comfort; frequented publick di∣versions
more than he had been
accustomed, and sought with
diligence some irresistable beau∣ty
to captivate his heart. But
<HI>Julia's</HI> superiority was so con∣fessedly
apparent, and she gained
so much by comparison with o∣ther
women, that he despised
their charms, whilst reflection
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
added fresh fuel to his flame. It
burnt with a violence that im∣pelled
him to have resource to
desperate remedies; and the ex∣travagance
of a heated imagi∣nation
prompted him to carry
her off by force. I am certain,
said he to one of his friends, Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> would be pleased with
my alliance, as the countess is
my relation, and he has even
offered me his eldest daughter.
It is true he will not exert his
authority to constrain the unwil∣ling
hand of <HI>Julia,</HI> but when
once I am master of it, I shall not
find him an irreconcileable
enemy; so far from it, I know
he will use his influence to ren∣der
me happy.</P>
<P>THE design once formed, he
sought with eagerness to accele∣rate
its execution. He recol∣lected
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
the gardiner of <HI>Bucking∣ham</HI>
formerly lived in his family,
and knew him to be avaricious,
and bold enough to assist in such
an enterprize. He sent for him
directly, and after giving him
one bribe, and the promise of a∣nother,
ventured to open his de∣sign,
and consult him on the
proper measures to be pursued.
Your scheme my lord, appears
to me very feasible, said the gar∣diner,
I have the key to a door
at the extremity of the garden,
which leads through a covered
alley to a back stair case opposite
to <HI>Julia's</HI> chamber. I am very
certain the door is seldom fasten∣ed
on the inside, as I have often
passed it of evenings, when she
has ordered me to bring her
flowers and fruit, and you may
carry her off without any distur∣bance.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136"/>
THE earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> found
these circumstances favourable,
and having fixed a day, he went
to the gate, the gardiner had
pointed out, with two gentle∣men
on whom he could depend,
at about eleven at night. One
of these gentlemen led their horses
into a valley, unperceived, whilst
the earl and the other entered
the garden as silently as possible.
It was one of the nights of as∣signation
to <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and the
earl of <HI>Sussex.</HI> The ladies were just
opening the staircase door, but the
night being cloudy, imposed up∣on
their belief, that the persons
they saw enter, were no other
than the lover and his friend.
On their part, perceiving two
women,—they sought to con∣ceal
themselves, and were leav∣ing
the walk, when <HI>Julia</HI> ad∣vancing,
you testify very little
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
impatience my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> in
retreating when I am so near;—
you seem rather desirous to avoid
me.—What is the meaning of
this unusual coldness?</P>
<P>IN these unkind reproaches,
the earl hearing the voice of his
cruel mistress, was distracted that
words so sweetly pronounced,
were not addressed to him; yet
was not insensible to his good for∣tune
in finding her in the garden.
He did not reply, for fear of un∣deceiving
her,—and making a
sign to the gentleman with him
to seize <HI>Lucilla,</HI> and prevent her
cries, he caught <HI>Julia</HI> in his arms,
and being tall and strong, bore
her towards the garden gate, in
spite of her resistance, just as
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and the earl of <HI>Sus∣sex</HI>
arrived; who on entering the
walk, by a sudden gleam of the
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
<HI>Moon,</HI> recognized the person of
the earl of <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is no expressing the
feelings of <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI> Frantic
with love and rage, he drew his
sword.—The earl quitting <HI>Julia,</HI>
followed his example, whilst the
gentleman who secured <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
set her free, attacked Lord <HI>Sus∣sex.</HI>
They were all persons of
courage, and animated with the
cause they engaged in. The
ladies knew not what to resolve;
—to call for help was to discover
their dear <HI>Hyppolitus;</HI> and if they
waited the event, it might be fa∣tal
to him! Never could dis∣tress
exceed theirs!</P>
<P>THE gardiner who stood sen∣tinel,
not doubting but the clash∣ing
of swords would be heard in
the castle, ran thither, and upon
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
his report, Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> hasten∣ed
into the garden, at the mo∣ment
the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> receiv∣ed
a wound from <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and
was fallen on the ground. See∣ing
a number of people coming,
he told Lord <HI>Sussex</HI> they must
think of saving themselves; but
finding the garden door locked,
and all the avenues full of ser∣vants,
in this extremety they
forced their way into the garden∣er's
house, which they barri∣caded;
Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> ordered his
people to surround it, and pre∣vent
their escape, (for the two
noblemen were so completely
disguised, he had not the least
suspicion of their quality.</P>
<P>HE ordered the earl of <HI>Bed∣ford</HI>
to be removed to the castle,
and lest his wounds should prove
mortal, as there was great reason
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
to fear, and himself be censured
for the murder of so near a rela∣tion,
dispatched a messenger im∣mediately
to <HI>London</HI> for a justice
of peace and constables, who ar∣rived
at break of day; at the same
time the prisoners, having de∣bated
the matter, were come to
a resolution of forcing the doors
which were secured without:
the vigorous attempts they made,
at length succeeded, and in de∣fiance
of opposition, they fought
their way through the earl's ser∣vants,
and would infallibly have
escaped undiscovered, had not
the justice with his possé just then
encompassed them on all sides,
and Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> given the word
to knock them down, rather than
suffer them to pass. This severe
order convinced them their lives
were inevitably lost, if they did
not yield, and they rather chose
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
to submit, than sacrifice them-to
a rash temerity,</P>
<P>JULIA and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> lay half
dead at the foot of a tree, re∣garding
this sad spectacle with an
excess of grief that no words can
represent. They saw the illus∣trious
criminals led to the castle,
and followed almost involunta∣rily.
The countess waited in
the hall in the utmost anxiety:
their caps were no sooner taken
off, than she cast her eyes upon
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and exclaimed aloud,
O <HI>Heaven's!</HI> my son! and faint∣ed.
Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI> who had
not yet made the discovery, ap∣proached,
and was greatly shock∣ed
and surprized to behold his
son a prisoner in his own house,
when he thought him dangerously
ill at <HI>Dieppe.</HI> He was unable to
speak for some time, at last col∣lecting
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
himself, and regarding
him with eyes flaming with rage,
what metamorphosis is this?—
May I believe my eyes? Is it
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> I see? Tell me what
are your designs? You imposed
upon my credulity to think you
was in <HI>France</HI> at the very instant
you are disguised in my house,
and have maliciously assassinated
an acknowledged friend of our
family,—a relation of your mo∣ther's
;—a nobleman of rank and
power! Good <HI>God!</HI> what a ca∣tastrophe!
Your father finds you
so unworthy of his protection,
that he abandons you without
repugnance to the rigour of the
law.</P>
<P>JULIA, who had mixed in
the croud, no longer able to
command her passions, rushed
impetuously to the feet of the
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
earl,—O my father, she cried,
bursting into tears, if any one
deserves punishment it is me a∣lone!
since <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was o∣bliged
to fight to rescue me from
the fury of the earl of <HI>Bedford!</HI>
Without his assistance that vile
man had forced me away:—he
seized me in his arms, and was
dragging me with violence along:
—I received all the cruel treat∣ment
that a man base enough to
form such designs is capable of!
Retire <HI>Julia,</HI> said the earl, en∣deavouring
to restrain his anger.
I comprehend more than I wish
to know: retire with your sister
into your own appartment, and
take care not to leave it without
my orders.</P>
<P>THE unfortunate fair one,
concluding she was destined to
imprisonment, as well as her lo∣ver,
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
in passing <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> gave
him a look expressive of tender∣ness
and grief;—he grasped her
trembling hand, and though he
disdained to plead in his own de∣fence,
the distress of her he loved,
moved him to interrogate his fa∣ther:
—For <HI>Heaven's</HI> sake, sir,
what crime has <HI>Julia</HI> commit∣ted?
Is she to suffer for my
fault? How has her innocence
merited severity? Be silent,
rash youth, said Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI>
dividing their hands, forbear to
irritate me farther.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> contem∣plated
this scene in the utmost
despair. Lady <HI>Douglas</HI> when she
recovered, addressed him in a
manner that did not alleviate it.
What a dangerous friend are you,
my lord, to treat the folly of my
son with such unjustifiable com∣plaisance.
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
Alas! you see to what
wretchedness we are reduced:—
can there be a more deplorable
situation than the earl's and mine?
Yes, madam, said the earl of
<HI>Sussex</HI> with resolution, that of
your son is more worthy of com∣miseration!
The proof of obe∣dience
you demanded was too
rigid. Why would you insist
upon his absence, when you knew
how strongly his heart was en∣gaged?
To cure a passion we
disapproved, interrupted the
countess, we hoped that absence
would have wrought the effect
it does commonly in the hearts
of men; and if my son had not
found a friend so ready to com∣ply
with the frenzy of his pas∣sion,
I have not the least doubt
but <HI>Julia</HI> had by this time been
forgot.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146"/>
DURING this altercation, the
surgeons who examined the earl
of <HI>Bedford's</HI> wounds, came to
make their report to Lord <HI>Doug∣la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
that they had found three,
one of which they feared was
mortal. The justice immediately
demanded <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> might be
taken into custody, and commit∣ted
to <HI>Newgate;</HI> a proposal that
awakened all the feelings of pa∣rental
affection in Lord <HI>Douglas.</HI>
He answered he never could con∣sent
to give up his son, but was
ready to be bound in two thou∣sand
pounds security for his ap∣pearance.
His bail was accept∣ed,
and the officers of justice
took their leave. Lord and La∣dy
<HI>Douglas</HI> wished the earl of
<HI>Sussex</HI> had followed their exam∣ple,
whom they regarded with
resentment: but that generous
friend, feigning not to observe
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
the apparent marks of disgust,
which his sensibility felt, hesi∣tated
not to assure them he would
share the same fortune with <HI>Hyp∣politus!</HI>
He never would aban∣don
him;—and if he perished,
it should not be alone!</P>
<P>THE two friends were suffer∣ed
to remain in the same appart∣ment,
carefully secured; whilst
<HI>Lucilla</HI> and <HI>Julia,</HI> were equally
guarded in another.</P>
<P>WHEN Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> was sa∣tisfied
they could not escape, he
set out with his lady for <HI>London,</HI>
and drove directly to the coun∣tess
of <HI>Bedford's,</HI> who had been
long acquainted with her son's
attachment to <HI>Julia,</HI> and con∣sented
to his choice; but was
not yet informed of the melan∣choly
event at <HI>Buckingham:</HI> she
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
heard it with lively emotions of
surprize and concern. When
the earl had related all the cir∣cumstances,
You will perceive
madam, said he, a prosecution,
though it may involve us in much
trouble and perplexity, must in
the end, be productive of still
greater to yourself, when it shall
be proved that the earl of <HI>Bed∣ford</HI>
attempted to carry off <HI>Julia</HI>
by force, and that her brother in
affecting her rescue, dangerously
wounded the ravisher. The lat∣ter
alone will appear culpable.—
But if your ladyship will listen
to the cordiality of my proposal,
I will banish the painful object
from your sight, for three years,
and if <HI>Heaven</HI> hearkens to our
prayers in favour of your son's
recovery, and he still perseveres
in his passion for <HI>Julia,</HI> I en∣gage
my word to promote their
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
union to the utmost of my
power.</P>
<P>THE countess did not choose
to determine any thing till she
had first consulted her family and
friends; who no sooner heard of
the misfortune, than they came
to offer their assistance and advice,
and after a careful enquiry into
the circumstances, were of o∣pinion,
no further concessions
could be required; and were
even surprized at the generosity
of the earl of <HI>Douglas's</HI> offer, to
send his son abroad for three years;
as they were ignorant of the se∣cret
motive of his conduct.</P>
<P>MATTERS being thus ami∣cably
adjusted, the earl went to
<HI>Gravesend,</HI> where he heard there
was a vessel loading for <HI>Leghorn;</HI>
this, he thought a favourable op∣portunity
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
for <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> not
doubting the beauties of <HI>Italy</HI>
would soon make him forget
<HI>England,</HI> and his engagements
there. He settled all prelimina∣ries
with the captain, and find∣ing
he waited only for a fair wind,
which there would not be time
to advertize him of at <HI>Bucking∣ham,</HI>
he sent for his son to <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
the next day.</P>
<P>BUT what was the situation
of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who had every
thing to fear for the object of his
love and was well assured his father
would take the most infallible
measures to separate him from
her for ever! These afflicting
thoughts had plunged him into
the deepest despair, if his native
fortitude had not been superior to
calamity. He attempted in vain,
to bribe the servants to connive
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
at his escape; but was more suc∣cessfull
in prevailing on them to
disclose all they knew of his fa∣ther's
proceedings. They loved
and respected <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> as their
second master, and informed
him of his expedition to <HI>Graves∣and,</HI>
which he saw was a leading
step effectually to oppose his dar∣ling
wishes. He requested the
footman who attended him, to
convey a letter to <HI>Julia,</HI> and bring
an answer. After a little hesi∣tation
he consented, reflecting
that the secrets between a bro∣ther
and a sister, were not of a
nature to offend a parent. <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
on his side, hazarded
nothing from a discovery, as his
family already knew the extent
of his passion for <HI>Julia.</HI> He
wrote to her thus:</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152"/>
“CAN it be, my lovely <HI>Julia,</HI>
that the same walls, where I
first felt the influence of your
charms, where I have so of∣ten
heard the musick of your
voice;—where my soul has
hung in attentive rapture on
those tender,—those virtuous
sentiments that flowed from
your lips,—should now se∣clude
us from the felicity of
beholding each other? I am
the wretched cause of all your
sufferings!—I, who ere now
must have fallen a victim to
grief, if love had not com∣bated
despair! Alas! what
has my unhappy passion
to flatter me with, in the
moment I am on the brink of
losing you for ever? To what
horrors am I to be exposed;
—torn from the country you
inhabit? The racking thought
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
throws me into agonies that
your heart alone can by its
sympathetic feeling too pain∣fully
comprehend! But if
through this gloomy abyss
one ray of hope can penetrate
to chear my fainting soul, it is
in the certainty of my <HI>Julia's</HI>
fidelity and truth!—No, my
angel is incapable of betray∣ing
the man who holds all
things as nothing in compar∣rison
with her,—and who can
never acknowledge equal ex∣cellence
in any other of her
sex!—I confess to you
I think it unnecessary to make
fresh protestations of eternal
constancy, to one who knows,
and directs every motion of
my heart. No, my <HI>Julia,</HI> no,
it can never change;—it can
never cease to adore you!—
Opposed to all the inveteracy
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
and rage of the enemies of my
passion, that faithful passion
shall bid defiance to them all.
—write to me, my dearest
love, do not abandon thy <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
in this miserable state;
—thou who art the sove∣reign
arbiter of his fate;—
the only object of his desires,
—and of his vows.”</P>
<P>THE fair <HI>Julia</HI> was a long
time in reading these lines from
her dear <HI>Hyppolitus.—</HI> The tears
which incessantly streamed from
her eyes, prevented her seeing
the long-loved characters.—
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> though in want of con∣solation
herself, forgot her own
distress in that of her friend: for
Lord and Lady <HI>Douglas</HI> were ex∣tremely
angry with <HI>Lucilla,</HI> for
what they thought an unpardon∣able
compliance with <HI>Julia's</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
weakness. She pressed her to
answer her brother's letter, and
stop as much as possible those flow∣ing
tears, which in spite of all
her efforts to restrain them, blot∣ted
the paper before she could
finish these words:</P>
<P>“You are then going at last,
my dear <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> Your
<HI>Julia</HI> shall no more behold
you! O, there is no conceiving
my exquisite distress! Alas!
can that innocent tenderness
we indulged for each other
before we were sensible of its
danger, have irritated <HI>Heaven</HI>
against us? What possibility
is there of opposing this tor∣rent
of misfortune? I am
not only deprived of repose
and joy,—I am even deprived
of reason! Nothing can re∣concile
me to the thought of
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
absence.—Yet, notwithstand∣ing
the wildness of our grief,
—it is decreed we must part.
—Let us then, by a noble
exertion of fortitude, my dear
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> try at least to con∣quer
the rigor of destiny.—
Yes, we will be faithful to
our vows.—No power on
earth,—not death itself, shall
force me to break mine.—
Fear not,—our constancy will
triumph over every obstacle.
We shall meet again, my dear
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> where love shall
crown our wishes!—Adieu!”</P>
<P>ASSURANCES tender, and in∣teresting
as those of his amiable
<HI>Julia,</HI> never were more wanted
to calm the tumult of his bosom,
and enable <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> to support
the scene the earl was preparing,
who had likewise sent for <HI>Lucilla</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
and <HI>Julia,</HI> with Lord <HI>Sussex</HI> and
the countess of <HI>Douglas;</HI> when
they were all seated in the draw∣ing
room, the earl, after some
moments reflection, addressed his
son in the following words:</P>
<P>“IT is not with an intention
of loading you with those re∣proaches
you have but too justly
merited, that I admit you into
my presence.—And yet, <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
it is but too evident you
have withdrawn yourself from
the duty a son owes to his pa∣rents.
You have imposed upon
and deceived us by letters.—
You have yielded to the irregu∣larities
of your heart.—And
<HI>Julia</HI> is an accomplice in your
disobedience. But on this you
may rely, I call <HI>Heaven</HI> to wit∣ness,
that neither your mother
nor I ever will consent to your
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
marriage, whilst you pursue a
conduct so absolutely repugnant
to our inclinations, which ap∣pears
to us in a light so odious,
there is no extremity, however
violent, we would not have re∣course
to, rather than comply.
Though <HI>Julia</HI> is not our child,
the happiness or misery of her
life, depends greatly on our pro∣tection.
Be advised, ere it be too
late, submit to the tenderness of
parental authority; and set out
with a good grace for <HI>Florence;</HI>
where luckily for you, I have
friends who will think it a plea∣sure
to demonstrate their regard
for the father, by their civilities
to the son. You will probably
be well received by the illustrious
house of <HI>Medicis:</HI> and to con∣vince
you this is no chimerieal
expectation, I can inform you
that forty years ago, when I was
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
about your age and travelled as
I propose your doing, to im∣prove
my taste and understand∣ing,
chance presented me with
an occasion of rendering Cardi∣nal
de <HI>Medicis,</HI> since known by
the name of <HI>Leo</HI> the Xth▪ a piece
of service, not inconsiderable.”</P>
<P>“HE was the <HI>Pope's</HI> nuncio in
the army of the <HI>League,</HI> taken
prisioner in the battle of <HI>Raven∣nes,</HI>
by <HI>Gaston de Foix,</HI> and sent
under convoy to <HI>France,</HI> by the
Marshal <HI>Trivulce.</HI> Never was
man more chagrined than the
cardinal; his mind was totally
occupied with some method to
escape,—but all attempts were
so hazardous, that after experi∣encing
various disappointments,
he began to despair of success;
but his secretary found means of
applying to the brave <HI>Zacti,</HI> who
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
knew him, conjuring him to as∣sist
in the rescue of a man, illus∣trious
by his merit and misfor∣tunes.
I happened to be then
with <HI>Zacti;</HI>—he invited me to
be of the party. I accepted the
proposal,—and we arrived just
as the cardinal was stepping into
a boat to go on board, we easily
put those who escorted him to
flight: he instantly disguised
himself in a military dress, and
we attended him to the castle of
<HI>Barnabi Milespini.</HI> I took leave
of him, to return with <HI>Zacti,</HI>
who was my relation, and the
cardinal expressed his gratitude
and friendship to both, in the
strongest terms. And though
invested with the papal dignity a
year after, I may venture to af∣firm
without vanity, he has ever
retained a pleasing remembrance
of this voluntary assistance.—</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161"/>
You will have the satisfaction,
my son, through this channel,
to be treated with civility by <HI>Cos∣mo
de Medicis,</HI> who will introduce
you to the senator <HI>Alberti,</HI> his
cousin, of an antient family in
<HI>Florence,</HI> and my intimate friend.
Notwithstanding the great ine∣quality
in our years, our friend∣ship
has been cordial. <HI>Alberti</HI>
has been twice in <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Scotland:</HI> He is a member of
the noble <HI>council of eight,</HI> and a
man of such uncommon worth,
that all my anxiety will cease the
moment I know your under his
protection. I shall take care to
supply you with whatever can
promote your instruction or a∣musement;
—without wishing
you to suppose our separation is
desirable to your mother or me.
—You may see by the manner
I have compromised this melan∣choly
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
affair with the countess of
<HI>Bedford,</HI> that your leaving the
kingdom is a necessary and una∣voidable
condition; as the earl is
still in imminent danger. But
should you evade my determined
purpose, by staying in <HI>England,</HI>
or even by returning before the
expiration of three years, I will
be the first to deliver you into
the hands of justice; when per∣haps,
you will be more sensible
of the mortifications attending a
prison than of the remonstrances
of an indulgent parent. Your
liberty, my son, is restored, but
the enjoyment of it is reserved for
any other country than your own.
—If the earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> who has
been so faithfully attached to
your irregularities, will act like
a real friend, he will advise you
to submit; and that <HI>Julia,</HI> may
reccommend the same counsel
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
unconstrained we leave you to∣ther.”</P>
<P>WITH these words he left the
room without expecting a reply.
The countess followed,—whilst
the earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Lucilla</HI>
conversed at one end of the room,
leaving the lovers to express the
anguish of their hearts to each
other. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> pressed his
<HI>Julia's</HI> hand, whilst he kneeled
at her feet, gazing on her
with unutterable tenderness, and
breathing out his soul in sighs.
A language intelligible and ef∣fecting
to both.<HI>—Julia</HI> first
broke the mournful silence,—
Arm yourself against the malice
of fate, said she, my dear and
too unfortunate <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> If
our sufferings are ever so great,
the tender regard we have for
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
each other is still greater.—A
single event may change the sad
state of our affairs.—You must
leave <HI>England;—</HI> I see no way
to avoid it.—Let us submit
with propriety.—They will not
find it possible to succeed in di∣viding
two hearts pierced with
the same arrow. Before the three
years they talk of, are accom∣plished,
<HI>—Heaven</HI> will perhaps
in pity, shorten the term of ab∣sence.
—Ah! <HI>Julia,</HI> he ex∣claimed,
how violent is the ef∣fort
you make to support my
sinking courage! You are so∣licitous
to comfort me with dis∣tant
and uncertain hopes when I
am tortured with agony—torn
from the only blessing that is
dear to me.—My eyes are ri∣vetted
upon you.—Oh! it is
the last time!—Alas! my
<HI>Julia,</HI> I tremble at the destiny
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
which awaits you.—How will
you be able to endure life in a
place so hateful.—where you are
treated with such indignity.—
This distracting thought is a
source of mortal inquietude that
will follow me every where? You
are too ingenious in seeking fresh
subjects of torment. I shall be
here, my <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> as I should
be whereever I was, only occu∣pied
with your idea, indifferent
to all things else.—I shall be
insensible of the indulgence or
severity I may receive from
others.—You will write to me
my <HI>Julia?</HI> I wish, she replied,
you may receive all I write,—
you will never then be long
without that consolation. But
how are we to manage our cor∣respondence?
—The earl and
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> who were not so inte∣rested
in their own conversation
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
as to be inattentive to their un∣happy
friends, heard these last
words, they approached them,
and said that care was their pro∣vince,
that they would not keep
them in suspence concerning
their intentions, for they had
settled every thing to facilitate
their correspondence.—That
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> must inclose his letters
to the earl, who would deliver
them to <HI>Lucilla.—</HI> The cruel
moment of parting drew near.—
The fair one had employed a
jeweller to set a locket of her
hair in a true lover's knot, encir∣cled
with diamonds; below were
two hearts pierced with the same
arrow;—and this motto:
—“United for ever.” Accept
this, my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> said
she, you alone know its value.
He was transported at receiving
a favour he had not dared to re∣quest,
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
and devoutly kissed this
sweet pledge of his <HI>Julia's</HI> af∣fection:
The heart-rending a∣dieu
was repeated;—they em∣braced.
—The earl and <HI>Lucilla</HI>
mingled their tears in this af∣fecting
scene. In the height of
their distress, Lord and Lady
<HI>Douglas</HI> entered, and desired their
son to follow them; he appear∣ed
as much thunderstruck at
the command, as if it had been
unexpected. He cast a mourn∣ful
look on <HI>Julia,</HI> whose down∣cast
eyes were filled with tears.
<HI>Lucilla</HI> and his friend perceiveing
him involved in grief and irre∣solution,
took each of them an
arm, and led <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> down
the stairs. He took the tender∣est
farewell of his beloved sister,
and repeated several times that
the only ardent proof of friend∣ship
he wished her to give, was
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
to devote herself tenderly to <HI>Julia,</HI>
and cherish his image in her
heart.</P>
<P>HE departed, and <HI>Julia</HI> was
left at liberty to vent the grief
she had so long repressed, in bit∣ter
sighs and complaints. It
was in vain <HI>Lucilla</HI> essayed to
comfort her. The moment she
lost sight of her dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
she threw herself on the ground,
—resting her head on <HI>Lucilla's</HI>
lap, pouring forth such tender
expressions of woe, as would
have asswaged the sorrows of her
lover, could he have heard him∣self
so lamented. <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
absorbed in mournful and silent
grief, did not open his eyes till
they were on board the ship,
when he was to bid adieu to his
dear and generous friend, the
earl of <HI>Sussex.</HI> All his wounds
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
opened afresh, at the dreadful
separation.—This is the last
stroke,—my dear friend,—said
he, embracing him, we too
must part! However you may
imagine, that what I have alrea∣dy
been torn from, renders me
insensible of every other loss; I
have reason to believe, from the
feelings of my heart at this mo∣ment,
that the most ardent love
is consistent with the strongest
friendship!—Continue yours
for me, my dear lord, in justice
to these sentiments.—He was
unable to utter more,—and the
earl's agitation was so violent,
he could only embrace him with
streaming eyes, which demon∣strated
the excess of his regard so
evidently, that Lord and Lady
<HI>Douglas</HI> acknowledged their ob∣ligations
to him in their hearts,
notwithstanding the chagrine he
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
had given them in assisting the
measures of <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI> They
overwhelmed their son with
torrents of advice; but he was
so conscious that they were the
sole authors of the misery he suf∣fered,
he would not endeavour
to restrain his emotions, or con∣ceal
his sentiments, but burst in∣to
such pathetic exclamations, as
would have touched any heart
but that of an incensed parent.
The servants who attended him,
were new ones, for the earl and
countess were suspicious of those
sent to Lord <HI>Sussex's</HI> country
house.</P>
<P>HYPPPOLITUS gave him mo∣ney
to reward their fidelity, and
recommended them to his care.
—My lord took the greatest part
into his own family, and placed
the rest with his friends.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="171"/>
HIS lordship entered the barge
with the earl and countess of
<HI>Douglas,</HI> who did not choose to
leave him behind, lest a second
escape should be attempted.—
They had not yet lost sight of
the ship, when a brisk gale sprung
up,—the sales were spread,—the
guns fired,—and the helm was
steered for <HI>Italy.</HI> Plunged in
grief. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> gazed with
straining eyes and fixed atten∣tion
on the <HI>English</HI> shore, send∣ing
incessant sighs towards his
<HI>Julia:</HI> he wished some furious
tempest might force them back
into the port; nor had they been
more than five days at sea when
a violent storm arose, threaten∣ning
immediated destruction.
—The strength and diligence of
the sailors were insufficient to
work the ship,.—The masts
gave way;—the cordage cracked;
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
—the sails were rent in pieces;—
the mountainous waves burst o∣ver
the top of the vessel;—now
bearing her to the clouds;—
now precipitating her into the
vast abyss.—Terrified with ap∣proaching
death, every one pour∣ed
forth lamentable complaints
to <HI>Heaven,</HI> making vows of re∣pentance,
and regarding with
timid eyes the planks, every
moment in danger of splitting.
<HI>—Hyppolitus,</HI> alone, appeared
collected, and discovered no ex∣traordinary
emotion! More re∣solute
in danger than these men
accustomed to warring elements,
he prepared to receive the gloomy
tyrant with undaunted fortitude.
He sometimes even wished to
behold him as the only cure for
his misfortunes;—whilst the
presence of mind he retained,
and the humanity of his dispo∣sition
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
prompted him to give the
necessary orders for saving the
ship.</P>
<P>AT length the horrible tem∣pest
subsided. The <HI>Heavens</HI> be∣came
serene; the hail, and the
thunder ceased; and so sudden a
calm succeeded, that the sea
seemed only agitated by the
breath of gentle zephyrs. All
laboured with the utmost ala∣crity
to repair the damage sus∣tained,
nor was there any time
to lose, for scarcely was one
danger surmounted, when ano∣ther
yet more formidable, made
its appearance: this was the fa∣mous
Corsair <HI>Dragut-Rais,</HI> so
known and dreaded on that coast.
No sooner did the pyrate discern
the <HI>English</HI> vessel, than he pre∣pared
to engage; first sending a
summons to her to strike. It
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
was now that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> made a
truce with his sorrows.—He
replied as if he had been com∣mander,
and the order had been
addressed to him; and sent the
Corsair a haughty defiance.—
He animated the captain to a vi∣gorous
resistance; he encouraged
the soldiers and sailors;—and his
example sufficed to inspire with
courage those who were before
intimidated. The two ships, af∣ter
firing several broadsides at
each other, began to grapple,
and came to a close engagement
on the decks. It seemed as if
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was multiplied:—
he was every where to attack
and to defend;—inevitable death
was in his strokes.—He flew
with incredible swiftness from
the poop to the prow;—and in
an instant, without balancing
objections,—he was in the ene∣mies
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
ship,—and though sup∣ported
by only a handful of sol∣diers,
the sight of the danger to
which he was exposed, could
not stop him; and his intrepi∣dity
so intimidated the <HI>Turks,</HI>
that <HI>Dragut-Rais,</HI> after opposing
him gallantly some time, seeing
nothing in reversion but a speedy
death, or certain captivity,—
thought to find his safety in
flight. He availed himself of
the general disorder and confu∣sion,
to give the necessary orders;
nor was the execution difficult;
for the time <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was board∣ing
the enemy, he saw a single
man in his own ship, cutting
down all before him: he had
formed a rampart round him of
dead and dying bodies, and no
one dared to attack him. A
sentiment of emulation tempted
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> to engage so brave a
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
rival, he returned to the deck,
—and had just commenced a
combat, which had probably
proved mortal to both, when the
<HI>Corsair's</HI> vessel drew up her grap∣pling
irons, and hoisting all her
sail, was soon at a considerable
distance; with not less expedi∣tion
did the whole ship's crew
fly to part the brave combatants,
they had both received several
wounds; and he who was de∣fending
the <HI>Turk's</HI> banner, per∣ceiving
himself deserted, finding
submission the only part left;
chose to resign his sword to <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
as the most worthy of
being his protector. Behave to
me, said the stranger in <HI>English,</HI>
with the same lenity I have al∣ways
behaved to those of your
nation. They have had reason
to praise my generosity.—I hope
Sir, said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> you will ne∣ver
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
have cause to complain of
my want of it!</P>
<P>HE went immediately to the
captain, and required his parti∣cular
regard to a brave officer,
whose valour was worthy of ad∣miration.
The captain replied,
without your assistance, sir, we
should not have come off with so
much glory. I leave you the
intire disposal of the man who
has interested your benevolence.
—But I have one favour to re∣quest,
which is that you will at∣tend
to your own situation:—
you are wounded;—for <HI>God's</HI>
sake, suffer yourself to be taken
care of.<HI>—Hyppolitus</HI> returned
thanks for his polite cordiality,
and as he had lost a great quan∣tity
of blood, and was extremely
faint, it was thought proper he
should go to bed.—But scarcely
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
had he rested five minutes, when
anxiety for his captive occasioned
him to desire he might be ac∣commodated
with a bed in his ap∣partment,
where intreated him
to suffer his wounds to be ex∣amined
and dressed. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
had the satisfaction of hearing
they were not dangerous, and if
this had been his only affliction,
he had been soon relieved. But
no sooner was the <HI>warrior</HI> at ease,
than the <HI>lover</HI> was wretched.—
This melancholy kept him awake
several whole nights, and the
stranger heard him frequently ex∣claim
Oh, <HI>Julia, Julia,</HI> I have
lost all in losing thee: nothing
can ever console me in thy ab∣sence!</P>
<P>IT did not require the pene∣tration
<HI>Muley</HI> (the name of the
valiant soldier) possessed to find
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
out <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was in love, and
under the influence of some un∣happy
planet! <HI>—Muley</HI> had
passed the spring of life; but
his person was fine;—his fea∣tures
regular;—his sentiments
elevated;—his manners noble
and elegant.—I am unable to
comprehend, said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> one
day to him, how a man of a cha∣racter,
virtuous and beneficent;
of manners so opposite to such a
life, can make piracy his pro∣fession?
<HI>Muley</HI> fetched a deep
sigh, and said, we are not always
masters of our destiny! I agree
with you, that <HI>Heaven</HI> did not
originally intend me for a pyrate,
and that I am only so by the ty∣ranny
of <HI>Dragut-Rais!</HI> This
answer excited the curiosity of
<HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>—He who had been
uninfluenced by that or any other
passions but love and glory, since
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
he parted from his <HI>Julia,</HI> felt
an extreme desire to know the
history of <HI>Muley</HI> I know not
who you are, said he, but you ap∣pear
far above your station! If you
have confidence enough to trust
me, I shall be highly obliged to
you; and I promise you may se∣curely
rely on my secresy and
friendship. I have a right to de∣mand
both, replied <HI>Muley,</HI> em∣bracing
him; for I assure you I
am one of your father's best
friends.—My first care was to
enquire your name, and I con∣sider
it as a kind of miracle that
providence has delivered me in∣to
the hands of a son of the earl
of <HI>Douglas!</HI></P>
<P>WHILST he was speaking,
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> examined his counte∣nance
more attentively than he
had ever yet done, and sound a
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
certain similarity of air and fea∣tures
between him and his be∣loved
<HI>Julia,,</HI> that confounded his
imagination. Ah! do not longer
defer the pleasure I shall have in
knowing you! Sir, my name is all
you can recollect, resumed <HI>Muley,</HI>
and, perhaps, you may have some∣times
heard of my misfortunes:
I am the earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who
'tis believed perished in the <HI>Ve∣netian</HI>
service about fourteen years
since. At these words <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
broke into a loud exclamation of
joy, and was so transported, that
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was more
than a little astonished.</P>
<P>AFTER mutual congratulati∣ons,
on this discovery, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
conjured him to give a detail of
his adventures, as no person in
the world was more cordially in∣terested
in them than himself.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="182"/>
I SHALL soon gratify your cu∣riosity,
said the earl, I am a <HI>Ca∣tholic.</HI>
You know my family.
I married one of the most virtu∣ous
and beautiful women in the
world; but fortune jealous of the
happy domestic tranquility I en∣joyed,
separated us. I was un∣fortunately
included in a prose∣cution
against Lord <HI>Nevil,</HI> to
whom I was nearly related; and
the king, who brought him to
the scaffold, suffered himself to
be perswaded I had murmured
against his injustice. From that
instant I became the object of his
hatred; and to avoid being that
of his vengeance, I was reduced
to the cruel necessity of leaving
my country and my wife.—
With that best of women I like∣wise
left our only child, <HI>Julia,</HI>
then two years old, who was in∣finitely
dear to me. If the earl
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
had chanced to have cast his eyes
on <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> he must have re∣marked
the variations in his
countenance, at the mention of
a name so beloved; but engross∣ed
with the naration he was giv∣ing,
he proceeded thus:</P>
<P>I OFFERED my service to <HI>Ca∣pello,</HI>
the <HI>Venetian</HI> commander,
embarked with him to join the
fleets of the pope and emperor.
We attacked <HI>Barba-Rossa,</HI> I had
the command of a galley, which
more than once faced the Corsair
<HI>Dragut Rais</HI> with great advan∣tage
to us, and misfortune to him;
for I killed his brother, <HI>Zikin
Rais,</HI> dear to him as life. He
swore vengeance, and in prosecu∣tion
of it, when we were in the
gulph of <HI>Laita,</HI> and Prince <HI>Do∣ria</HI>
made that incomprehensible
retreat which astonished the world,
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
and for which no reason has been
assigned; <HI>Dragut Rais,</HI> inflamed
with rage, would not lose the
opportunity of engaging me.—
He knew my galley, and sur∣rounded
it; notwithstanding the
assistance I received from a <HI>Ve∣netian</HI>
vessel, I was so hemmed
in by the enemy, that resistance
was in vain; covered with wounds
I fell into the sea not unobserved
by <HI>Dragut-Rais,</HI> who gave or∣ders
to snatch me from instant
death, only to exercise his ven∣geance
in a thousand shapes for
depriving him of his brother:
he kept me chained at the bot∣tom
of the ship, where I endured
more than humanity can con∣ceive.</P>
<P>DEAF to all remonstrances,
and petitions, he would never
consent that I should try to pro∣cure
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
a ransom, four years were
already passed, when after a warm
contest, he obliged an <HI>English</HI>
ship to strike: all my sorrows
were renewed, when I saw my
countrymen as unfortunate as
myself. I enquired news from
<HI>England,</HI> and particularly if they
could give me any intelligence of
Lady <HI>Warwick?</HI> Amongst the
prisoners was a gentleman, whom
she had taken into her service af∣ter
our separation, and who re∣mained
in it till her death.—
A death ever fatal to my repose,
and which I bewail with unceas∣ing
tears.</P>
<P>The earl, suffocated with grief,
was a long time before he could
resume his story; at length, re∣covering
from the disorder this
painful narration had thrown
him into, he proceeded: I—
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
learned from this man, that my
wife, hearing the report of my
death, which she too easily be∣lieved,
was so affected she sunk
under the blow, surviving it only
a few days. This cruel recital
was followed by that of my child's
death, that dear infant! The
only attachement I had to life
after the loss of her mother.—
This was the completion of my
woes. I no longer felt the hard∣ship
of captivity.—I became in∣sensible
to all the mortifications
the <HI>Corsair</HI> could impose.—His
peculiar pleasure was to keep my
apprehensions of the effects of
his anger always awake.—That
was now impossible;—for my
indifference to good or bad for∣tune
was so perfect, that the
sweetest consolation I had, was
to remain in a damp dungeon
loaded with irons, and still more
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
with misery; expecting the le∣nient
hand of death to close my
eyes. How severe were my re∣proaches
for leaving my wife and
daughter! If thy goodness, O
my <HI>God!</HI> had spared but one,
there would be a ray of hope to
support me! Alas! I have lost
all! without being ranked a∣mongst
the living, I am a wretch
not yet numbered with the
dead!</P>
<P>IT would be trespassing on
your patience to dwell any longer
on the recital of my sufferings.
Let it suffice that at the expira∣tion
of eight years, of horrible
imprisonment, <HI>Dragut Rais</HI> one
day remembered me.—For I
am convinced he had for some
time totally forgot I existed.—
He commanded me to be re∣leased
from my dungeon; and
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
when I breathed the fresh air,
and saw the light of day, I faint∣ed.
Come, come, <HI>Warwick,</HI>
said he, resume thy courage. I
have determined to restore your
sword; but it is on condition thou
swearest by the oath sacred to
<HI>Christians,</HI> to use it in my de∣fence,
against all those I shall at∣tack.
without choice or exception
of persons or nations? If thou
wilt consent, said he, presenting
me his hand, thou shalt not be
less honoured than myself.—
Thou shalt share my command,
—and divide my fortune.—As a
proof, I will adopt thee by my
favourite name, <HI>Muley,</HI> and pre∣sent
thee with a robe like my
own? The offers you make are
not sufficient to tempt me, I re∣plied;
your riches I despise;—
and the equality of command,
you rank so high, is below my
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
acceptance! But if the services
my sword can render may pur∣chase
liberty, tell me in what
time you will grant it; and what
ransom you demand? It shall
cost thee six thousand crowns at
the end of ten years, during
which period thou shalt serve me
with fidelity. I agreed to his
proposal, which must excuse my
behaviour in the late action. My
honour was pledged, and I could
not dispense with the obligation;
though my ardent wishes were
in your favour. But <HI>Heaven</HI> in∣spired
you with courage;—you
forced <HI>Dragut-Rais</HI> to fly,—and
have abridged the period of my
captivity. I judged it imprudent
to discover myself, as a wrong
interpretation might be given to
my being found in arms against
my country. The opinion I
have of the goodness of your
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
heart, assures me you will answer
my expectations by making a
proper use of the secret I entrust
you with.</P>
<P>I ESTEEM it a singular hap∣piness,
replied <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> that
without being intimately known
to you, I am thought worthy
of your confidence; a mark
of esteem▪ which I will ne∣ver
abuse; and I have the satis∣faction
to assure you, my dear sir,
you could not have bestowed it
on any person who has it more
in their power as well as incli∣nation
to repay the favour, by
informing you of joyfull and sur∣prizing
events in which you are
extremely concerned.</P>
<P>HE then gave him a faithfull
relation of all that regarded the
lovely <HI>Julia;</HI> and though he did
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
not declare his love, the passion∣ate
turn of his expressions, the
portrait he drew of her charms,
and the earl's recollection of the
deep sighs and exclamations he
had heard in the night, were e∣vident
proofs to him, that <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
adored his daughter.</P>
