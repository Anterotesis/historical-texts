<HEAD>A <HI>Spectators Address</HI> TO THE WHIGS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Present Amusement of the Town, is wholly occasion'd by the late Villainous Assassinati∣on of Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> by Monsieur <HI>de Guiscard;</HI> nor is it strange that the Allarm of this Action has been so great; the Circumstances of the Criminal, the Manner of it, the Person Assassinated, the Place, all concur to Amuse us. No Age in the World, no History gives us an Account of a Precedent to this Story. A Privy Counsellour in Council, at the very
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Table, with Circumstances rather Bru∣tal than Manly, by Surprize, with a Weapon casually taken up, without Pro∣vocation, without View of Escape, and for ought we can see, without any pro∣posed End to himself.</P>
<P>Nothing indeed ought to appear strange in the Manner, when a Man of Honour and Birth can stoop to be an Assassine, the Vilest and Worst kind of Murtherer.</P>
<P>There are some Circumstances how∣ever in the Case, which seem to call for our Remark; and which respect not so much the Murtherer, for he Merits nothing and seems to have put himself below or beyond a Generous Pity, that a Man will often afford an Enemy; all I shall say of him is, relating to the following Parti∣culars, only to Remark, that he was a <HI>French</HI> Man, a Papist, and a Spy to the <HI>French;</HI> and this I Note, because I shall have occasion to mention it again.</P>
<P>I make no Apology for Directing this Letter to the Whigs, other than this, (1.) That they seem to be a little more Al∣larm'd at this Attempt, than their Notion of this Gentleman, ever since his las<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Advancement, as well as before, gave us reason to expect. (2.) That they seen to be concern'd to have their Characte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> clear'd from the Guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI> You must allow you have not been Famous, generally speaking, for abundance of good Treament in the Case of the Gentleman we speak of; many a Stab has been aim'd at his Honour and Reputation; and such has your Heat been in the Matter, that sometimes it has transported you beyond what we call Decency: This makes the more Moderate among you jealous and concern'd, lest the true Odium of this abominable Fact should lye at your Door, and therefore I say in the <HI>Second</HI> place, you are con∣cern'd to clear your Reputation and your Character, as to the Guilt of the Fact. But Count <HI>Guiscard</HI> has done it for you, he has put a short End to the Enquiry, what sort of People were concern'd in this Murther. Now it remains, since you are happily clear'd of all Suspicion as to the Fact, that you may be in a Friendly Way reminded of your former Mistakes, about Persons and Things in the Publick Affairs; in which you must Pardon your Neighbours, if they think you have been Mistaken, and in which this Horrid Fact, however Villainous in it self, may have this good Effect, that it may Open your Eyes to your own Interest, and to the Interest of your Countrey.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
1. Here is an undoubted Testimony; (for the Testimony of an Enemy is allow∣ed the most Authentic) that this Gentle∣man, whether by a steady Zeal, or per∣haps more direct Measures, is so far from being, as some of you have Sug∣gested, a Friend to the <HI>French</HI> Councils, and Interest, that they Esteem him the most Dangerous Enemy they have; One whom they would run the greatest Hazards to Destroy; and 'tis no Affront to Truth nor to your Wisdoms, to say, that all of you were not always of that Opinion.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Testimony is Undoubted; Murther and Assassination can be no Counterfeit. I am loth to reproach some Gentlemen, in endeavouring to suggest that the Person now Wounded in Dete∣cting a Traytor, had once before Disco∣vered a Treason of the same kind, and received all the Reproaches of the Guilt you could throw upon the Traytor him∣self; What Unjust Methods were Used with the Traytor to bring him to Accuse his Master, either by Fear of Death, or Hope of Life and Reward, is no Secret to the World: and how this Gentleman run the Hazard both of his Life and his Honour on that Account is also well known. You saw the Man Dye with his
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Justification in his Mouth, and yet shall I reproach your Charity in saying, you would not Believe. Heaven has now in the just Defence of his Honour and Inno∣cence, given another Instance; an In∣stance that leaves no room for Suspicion, unless you'll suppose Mons. <HI>Guiscard</HI> had a mind to make a Jest of his own Life, for according to <HI>Hudibras,</HI>
<Q><L>He that Hangs or Beats out's Brains,</L>
<L>The Devil's in him if he Feigns.</L></Q></P>
<P>Heaven gave you Evidence of the Inte∣grity of this Honourable Person, from the Penitent Mouth of a Criminal he had De∣tected. The Devil has now given up the Cause, and having joyn'd a Confession to it, no man will ever be able to Open his mouth against it more; wherefore I shall take no Pains to add any thing to such a Testimony. But directing my self to you, Gentlemen, that were before male-contents in this matter, I would persuade you to look a little into Public matters with a more im∣partial View than you were used to do, &amp; tell us, had the horrid Blow been struck home, and the Murtherer finished his De∣vilish Design, what had your Circumstan∣ces been, and what had been the Conditi∣on of this Peaceable Nation at this time? Whose hands in all probability had we fal∣len
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
into, and what Confusions would all things have been in among us, at such an unsettled settling Juncture as we are in? How had the Restraint upon the Vio∣lence of Mens Tempers on both sides been taken off # and the Ballance which has been held by his Prudence between the Fury of Parties been thrown up? the Na∣tion had been given up to the Fiery Spi∣rits of a few Men who must have Fought it out, the Victors had met with no Check to their Heat, nor the Vanquish'd any Refuge but Despair▪</P>
<P>Then it would have appear'd, that the Safety of this Island lies in a happy Medi∣um between all our Extreams, between the Madness and Extravagancies of the State Lunatics of the Nation; and that this Person alone, had found out the way to hold the Scale between you; you would then have seen, you were not turn'd out to be Destroy'd, but to be Preserv'd from your own Folly, that would have Destroy'd you; that the New Ministry were not brought in to be Furies and Tyrants, but to prevent their being any such thing as Furies &amp; Tyrants among us.</P>
<P>And if you can in your Cooller thoughts reflect a little upon things with Judgments Unbyass'd, &amp; laying aside the Chagrin and Regret at the late Changes, you may see
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
that <HI>His Wisdom</HI> overthrew a Manage∣ment, Partial to the highest Degree; that Haughtily Engross'd Government it self, even in the Hands of the very Queen, Besieg'd the Throne, Used their Soveraign as a Royal Prisoner, and Her Subject, as Dependent upon Party; <HI>a Management,</HI> that under the Pretence of keeping up Credit, Concealed the Circumstances of the Na∣tion from us, till we ran Seven Millions in Debt, and knew nothing of the mat∣ter; <HI>a Management,</HI> that pretended to have Money Crowded upon them fa∣ster than they wanted it, that fill'd up every Fund, and commanded every Loan, and Glory'd in bringing down Interest of Money to 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> at the same time that the Poor Creditors of the Govern∣ment gave 22 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Discompt for Mo∣ney on the Governments Bills.</P>
<P><HI>His Wisdom</HI> overthrew <HI>a Management</HI> that made a Prey of the War, and a Pro∣perty of the Army; <HI>a Management,</HI> that however▪ Successful in the Field, left us every Year farther from a View of Peace than it found us; <HI>a Management,</HI> that made the Enemy the Stronger for every Loss, and us the Weaker for every Gain; <HI>a Ma∣nagement,</HI> that has twice Lost <HI>Spain</HI> by Con∣quering it, and Ruin'd the Army in <HI>Flan∣ders</HI> without a Battel; <HI>a Management,</HI> that
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
tended directly to ruin the Confederacy by Encreasing it; &amp; neither knew what to take by a War, or what to accept by a Peace.</P>
<P><HI>His Prudence</HI> has Cur'd the Suspicions &amp; Jealousies Artfully spread amongst the Confederates; and has Satisfied them in the Queen's measures; Disappointed those that expected separate Treaties and se∣parate Peace would have follow'd our Alterations, and have shew'd the Hero, who we thought would have quitted the Service in Disgust, that his own Interest, his Countries Advantage &amp; his Mistresses Glory, might still be in his Power, if he knew how to Practise what his Duty to them all Call'd for, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to Submit to Reason and the Commands of his Sove∣raign.</P>
<P><HI>His Prudence</HI> has kept Quiet, &amp; brought to Temper the Heats &amp; Passions of Par∣ties, and not suffer'd the Two Sides of Whig and Tory to meet together in a Storm; but letting them both run on, and spend their Fury in their proper Channels, causes them to Ebb Gently, &amp; lose themselves Insensibly in the Great Ocean of Moderation.</P>
<P><HI>His Conduct</HI> Rescues the Church from Danger, Protects the Dissenters in their Toleration Liberty, preserves the Ʋnion
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
from the Infractions of <HI>Jacobites</HI> and the <HI>Pretender;</HI> Quiets the Minds of the Peo∣ple in Matters of Religion and the <HI>Han∣nover</HI> Succussion.</P>
<P><HI>His Management</HI> restores Credit, con∣firms p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Funds, raises New, banishes the Peoples Jealousies about the Spunge; raises Money in spight of Pretences of be∣ing Exhausted; Pays an Immense Debt, and prevents the Clamours of the People at continued Deficiencies.</P>
<P>This is the Man that has been Assassi∣nated in the very Discharge of his Duty to the Nation, and in the Vigorous Pur∣suit of the Grand Enemy of <HI>Britain.</HI> It remains, to Enquire by Who, and by what Councils such a Thing could be Concerted?</P>
<P><HI>Church men</HI> could not be Guilty of so Foul a Deed; besides, Assassination is no Church of <HI>England</HI> Practice, He has laid the greatest Obligations imaginable on the Church of <HI>England;</HI> has been the Patron of the Clergy, the Restorer of their Convocation Liberties, the Deli∣verer of them from their Fears, and has been the Hand that has given them the Ascendant over their Brethren. The Church of <HI>England</HI> men could neither be so Ungenerous, or so Ungrateful.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<HI>Dissenters</HI> could not be Guilty of it; for his being in the Ministry is the Only thing they have left for all the Quiet &amp; Calm they Enjoy. They Owe to him the Protection the Crown affords them; and his Hand alone has kept off the Hands of their Enemies from Violating their Toleration; They must therefore be Distracted if they did it.</P>
<P><HI>Torys</HI> could not do it; for he has shared the Management of the Nation without Distinction, to Them as well as to other Men; it is by him they are Protected in the Exercise of that Power they Enjoy; and whenever he pleases to withdraw from them, they can no longer Support themselves; they must be worse than Mad if they did it.</P>
<P><HI>Whigs</HI> could not do it; for he is the only Barrier that Defends them from the Attacks of the High-flyers, who like the <HI>Philistines,</HI> would be too strong for them▪ Nor could they Protect themselves from Fines, Forfeitures, Indictments, Impeach∣ments, &amp;c. if those things had not been Restrain'd by his Moderation. The Whigs then must be abandon'd of Common Sense if They did it.</P>
<P>Nothing but <HI>Jacobites, Papists</HI> and <HI>French-men,</HI> cou'd rationally come into such a Piece of Work; and there we find
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
it fix'd. A Testimony to the Glory of his Family and Person, That he has been pur∣suing the only fatal Measures to overthrow the <HI>French</HI> Interest; and that as the Par∣liament express it in their Address, It is for his Zeal against the Enemies of the Go∣vernment, that he has incurr'd the Hatred of all the Friends of Popery and Faction.</P>
<P>Let who will be Blind to the Merit of Vertue, its Enemies always bear Witness for it. The Clamour of Popery, Tyranny &amp; the Pretender, has made a Loud Noise in the Mouths of a Discontented Party. But this Confutes the Malice of that Sug∣gestion; it is Evident, Popery and French Power, were not so Low before, but they had some Hopes; but now they see their Ruin Inevitable: Former Men might mean Well, tho' they miss'd the Method; but these appear Right, both in the De∣sign and the Means; and this is Testi∣fy'd by Dint of Knife, That if the Life of this One Person is not some how or other Cut Off, the Cause of <HI>France</HI> is Ruin'd, and the Hopes of a Pretender Blasted for Ever.</P>
<P>What greater Testimony to the Inte∣grity of a Minister of State, in this Court, can be obtain'd than the Malice and Rage of the Enemy; an Enemy, made Desperate by his Keen and Well-poin∣ted Pursuit, of the Proper Methods to
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Destroy them? What greater Testimony of his Ability, as well as Resolution, to push at the Grandeur of the Enemy, than that they Single him out as the M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k of their Rage; as the only Man that is a Terror to <HI>French</HI> Councils; a Discoverer of <HI>French Spies,</HI> a Waking Centinel to his Country, to give the Alarm against the Surprize of <HI>French</HI> Treachery, &amp; a Steady Bulwark against <HI>French</HI> Power.</P>
<P>These just Remarks, may, it is hoped, open Mens Eyes, and remove the Dark∣ness of Prejudices from those that could not judge who were, or who were not, the Friends of their Country; and thus the Wound given this Faithful Counsellor in his Breast, may be a Healing to the Wound in the Breast of our Mistaken People; which caused them not rightly to Know, or Value, their most Faithful Friends.</P>
<P>It is Confess'd 'tis hard, that Men of Honour, and Steady Principles, must run the Risque of the Fury and Rage of the Enemies of their Country, to Convince that very Country of their Fidelity; &amp; Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> must be Stabb'd by a Villainous French Papist, to convince us, that he is Sincerely applving himself to, and taking right Measures in the pulling down of <HI>French</HI> Tyranny.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
But Wise and Impartial Men will now open their Eyes, and see better who are Friends to the <HI>British</HI> Nation, who Pro∣tectors of the Protestant Interest, who Faithful to their Country &amp; their Queen; Those that by Confusion of Councils re∣vive the Hopes of the Enemy; or those, who by Steady and Wise Steps, make them in Despair fly to Villany, Murther and Assassination.</P>
